<PRE>TURN IT UP
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>Small-time drug dealer Diamond (Pras from the rap group The Fugees) has 
aspirations.  He  wants to trade in his life of guns and drugs for a 
music contract.  "I want to be legitimate," he says earnestly to his 
music manager and fellow coke-dealer, Gage, played by real-life 
hip-hopper Ja Rule.  "I want to earn some respect."</P>
<P>An admitted perfectionist when it comes to creating his sound, Diamond 
has a much more flexible attitude when it comes to ethics.  Using his 
shiny guns, he is happy to waste anyone gets in his way.  But even he 
has limits.  The morality test that separates the men from the boys or, 
in case of TURN IT UP, the vicious killers from the really vicious 
killers, involves an innocent, Spanish-speaking, pregnant woman who 
witnesses Diamond and Gage murdering a bunch of other dealers.  In a 
minor moral moment, Diamond insists that Gage let her go.  One wonders 
what was it that tipped the scales in her favor.  Would the pregnancy 
alone have been enough?  Probably not, since Diamond argues with Gage 
that not only is she pregnant but, since she doesn't speak English, she 
couldn't turn them in.</P>
<P>Even if the script by the director, Robert Adetuyi doesn't work as a 
morality tale, it does form the basis for some interesting set pieces to 
demonstrate Adetuyi's skills in staging scenes.  Handsomely lit and shot 
by cinematographer Hubert Taczanowski, the movie is a real treat for the 
eyes.  Your ears, however, may complain that there's little for them.  
When the actors aren't speaking, they strut upon the stage with 
impressive verve.  But when they start reading their lines, you realize 
how vacuous the script is.  Even ignoring its propensity for non-stop 
profanity, there is little to admire about it.  With miniscule plot and 
character development, the script leaves the visuals to carry the movie.  
And that's asking for some pretty heavy lifting.</P>
<PRE>What do we learn of the characters?</PRE>
<P>Well, Diamond is a freedom-loving man who refuses even to give his 
girlfriend his cell phone number, equating that to the umbilical cord 
that once bound men to their mothers.  Gage has a succinct statement of 
human desires.  He says that all we want is "money, drugs and hos."  
Gage is aghast when a big record producer named Mr. White -- yes, he is 
-- wants to hear a demo tape before hiring Diamond.  The audacity!</P>
<P>This much can be said.  After enduring many ugly bad movies, I, for one, 
appreciate having a bad movie that it is at least handsomely filmed and 
competently directed.  </P>
<P>TURN IT UP runs 1:23.  It is rated R for strong violence, language and 
some drug content and would be acceptable for high school seniors and 
older.</P>
