<PRE>Varsity Blues ***
Starring James Van Der Beek, Jon Voight
Directed by Brian Robbins
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Many a film have been showing us the different aspect's of what high schools
are in all different parts of the U.S. Whether is be four guys trying to loose
their virginity, the ugly duckling turning into a swan, or the longtime love of
Dawson and Joey, filmmakers are finding more ways to showcase this four year
portion of our lives. </P>
<P>But this is West Canaan, Texas. Football rules all, the coach is evil, and the
police are stupid. Lance Harbor (Paul Walker) star quarterback for the Coyotes
(he has a huge billboard that says that in front of his house) is being pushed
by the venomous coach Kilmer (Voight, who's performance here should go right
next to his in Anaconda) to play even though he's letting off scar tissue by
the minute. He permanently damages his leg during the middle of the game.</P>
<P>The replacement is Johnathan Moxon (Van Der Beek) he's more interested in
reading Slaughterhouse Five than he is looking through the football plays. He
has a couple of plays of his own and he decides to try them out, besides he's
not going to play football ever again anyway. Kilmer doesn't like the fact that
he's not listening to him and tries to jeopardize his scholarship to Brown. It
all leads up to the big game, will they win, will they lose? (Yawn..).</P>
<P>The movie starts out as if it could be a well-drawn out thoughtful look at high
school sports, however this couldn't happen because MTV Productions is on the
label and the director is the co-creator of Kenan & Kel and All That. So they
fill in the cracks with countless scenes of uneeded nudity and profanity. While
the first half provides incredible insight, the second is a predictable sports
movie. So for that I give it *** stars.</P>
