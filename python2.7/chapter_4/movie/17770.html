<PRE>RUN LOLA RUN
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>In an age of sardonic titles, writer and director Tom Tykwer's RUN LOLA
RUN (LOLA RENNT) refreshingly means precisely what it says.  Lola,
played with unbounded energy in an utterly captivating performance by
Franka Potente, does exactly that, run almost the entire movie.  And
we're not talking about merely some yuppie jogging -- Lola looks like
she's in training for Olympic sprints.  Well, she would if it were not
for her black combat boots, her sea green, checked pants, her powder
blue tank top and her piece de resistance, hair dyed bright
reddish-orange.</P>
<P>With heavy music that pulsates to the same fast-paced beat as the
storyline, the movie literally flies by you.  One blink in this SLIDING
DOORS on steroids, and you've missed two scenes and three key events.
In fact, the story's funniest parts happen in little subplots that zip
by so fast that they are almost impossible to follow.  Suffice it to say
that this is a enormously fun film that will not put you to sleep -- in
fact it has the effect of several large cups of heavily caffeinated
coffee.</P>
<P>"The ball is round," a man declares in the film's opening.  "The game
lasts 90 minutes.  Everything else is theory."  He then kicks a soccer
ball into the heavens, and movie is off and running like a sprinter
after the blast from a starter's pistol.  With MTV-style jump cuts,
split screens and light-speed zooms, Mathilde Bonnefoy's editing and
Frank Griebe's cinematography are two of the stars of this hyperactive
motion picture, with heavy emphasis on the word "motion."  There is even
an animated version of the ever-running Lola that makes a few
appearances.</P>
<P>As we meet Lola, she is answering the phone.  It seems that she just
missed a very important rendezvous, in which she was supposed to pick up
her boyfriend, Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu), a bagman for some very bad
dudes.  He panicked when she didn't show up and left his bag of 100,000
deutsche marks on the subway, where a homeless man took it.  If Manni
doesn't come up with 100,000 marks from somewhere by the time the bad
guys return in exactly twenty minutes, his life will be in jeopardy.</P>
<P>Lola tells Manni not to worry; she will come up with the money by the
deadline.  He warns her that, if she doesn't, he will rob the
supermarket across the street.  Lola then literally bolts out of her
apartment and down the stairs before she ever has much of a plan in
mind.  One thing is certain, she doesn't have time for slow means of
transportation, such taxis or bikes, instead she runs like the wind,
which gives the whole movie a wonderfully free and energetic spirit.
(One can just imagine the casting of the part.  After sprinting non-stop
for blocks, please halt and read these lines.)</P>
<P>Along the way, we meet a host of minor characters with my favorite being
her father, a banker.  You've heard of families who complain that all
the father ever does is work.  Well, her father has a rather unusual
solution, which is one of many delicious little stories in this black
comedy.  The story is structured into three wholly contained alternative
versions of what could have happened after Lola heard Manni's plea.</P>
<P>If you've ever been inclined to shake your head when you see someone
with hair the color of a piece of fruit, this movie may disabuse you of
that notion.  As Lola, Franka Potente is as likeable and charming as
they come.  Even so, one still wonders what she looks like in her
natural hair color.  One thing is certain; her look in this movie is a
perfect match for her character.</P>
<P>RUN LOLA RUN runs a blisteringly fast 1:21.  The film is in German with
English subtitles.  It is rated R for some violence and profanity and
would be fine for teenagers.</P>
