<P>Of all of David Lynch's films, I find myself ranking "Blue Velvet" on
a lower meter. It's a good, blazingly original film that is also
wholly uneven, obscene and tasteless to the core. The latter terms are
not meant as a critique - Lynch at his best is always obscene and
tasteless. But I also find "Blue Velvet" to be underwhelming, as say
compared to "Eraserhead" (his greatest film) or the neo-noir/horror
picture "Lost Highway." It's just that their themes are more complex
and disturbing than this perverse take on suburbia.</P>
<P>"Blue Velvet" was released back in 1986 and was highly controversional
for its time, mainly due to graphic scenes of torture and sex. There
was also much talk about the sequence where Isabella Rossellini
(Ingrid Bergman's daughter) is naked and publicly embarrassed, while
teeth marks and cigarette burns cover her entire body. There is no
question that Lynch has always had trouble protraying women in a
positive light (take a close look at Patricia Arquette forced
stripping at gunpoint in "Lost Highway"), but this particular sequence
is pure misogyny serving no purpose in the entire film. Consequently,
Rossellini also endures several beatings by a helium-sniffing psycho
named Frank (a truly classic performance of psychotic rage by Dennis
Hopper). There are also numerous close-up shots of ants and
cockroaches littering the screen as if they were aware of something
beyond our knowledge. Of course, the wonderful opening scenes of the
film, including the shot of ants scowering the e!  arth, suggest an
evil lurking beneath a conservative town of white picket fences, rose
gardens, people mowing their lawns, etc.</P>
<P>The story in "Blue Velvet" revolves around a potential murder mystery
that is never quite explained or resolved (at least, not to my liking
though Raymond Chandler's novels are often so complex that even he did
not know what they were about). Kyle MacLachlan plays a college
student named Jeffrey, who is visiting his picture-postcard hometown,
Lumberton. One day, he discovers a severed human ear on an open
field. He contacts the police and then decides to investigate on his
own. This all leads to the apartment of a distraught singer (played by
Rossellini), who occasionally sings "Blue Velvet" at a
nightclub. Enter the deranged killer Frank who tortures and humiliates
the poor singer, and the scenes between the two of them are as
startling and effective as any other scene in the film. They contain a
raw, vicious power that is unparalleled in the history of cinema, but
they are often tempered with a joke or some sly humorous poke in the
arm. There is such an intense buildup of em!  otions that eventually
Lynch throws it all away by winking at the audience - in effect
saying, hey, this is not as bad as it looks. This reminds me of a
similar scene in "Wild at Heart" where a similar psycho played by
Willem DaFoe humiliated and sexually teased Laura Dern to the point
where it was lessened by an unnecessary joke.</P>
<P>As Jeffrey veers further into this S & M world with the help of a
policeman's daughter, Sandy (Laura Dern), things get much weirder
especially when Dean Stockwell shows up as a Kabuki transvestite. Both
Stockwell and Hopper must hold the record for spouting more
obscenities on film than Eddie Murphy.</P>
<P>"Blue Velvet" is a fascinating, intriguing film but it is not
completely successful. The elements of the mystery are so warped that
I gave up after a while trying to follow it. It is true that some of
Lynch's later work was more confounding and that it did not bother me
much, but this mystery is actually more conventional and, dare I say,
realistic so I did expect to be able to follow it. The performances
are mostly shouting matches, especially between Hopper and Rosselini
though their scenes lend the necessary realism to their strange,
sexual bond. Kyle MacLachlan and Laura Dern merely react than act,
except for one exquisitely subtle scene at a cafe. I also think the
music by Angelo Badalamenti is far too offputting, though the songs by
Julee Cruise enhance the theme of a town with dark secrets ready to
explode. Plus, the uplifting ending negates the darkness that preceded
it, though I did like the shot of the bird with a wasp in its
mouth. That shot actually adds a sly perv!  erse touch, but I could
have lived without the annoying sappiness of it all.</P>
<P>For whatever strange reason I cannot comprehend, I still liked "Blue
Velvet" because nobody has ever produced or directed anything like it
prior to its release. There isn't anything you can easily compare it
to. It is definitely Lynch's wildest endeavor and, somehow, strangely
compelling. Being a huge Lynch fan, I will probably look at the film
again ten years from now, and perhaps call it a masterpiece as many
have. For now, this is just fairly good Lynch fare.</P>
