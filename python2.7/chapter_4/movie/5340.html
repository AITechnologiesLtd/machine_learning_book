<PRE>               A film review by Ralph Benner</PRE>
<PRE>                Copyright 1996 Ralph Benner</PRE>
<P>        Nothing written by Pauline Kael during her reign as America's
bitch supreme is more embarrassingly lacking of her usual perception and
foresight than her review of 1976's NETWORK entitled "Hot Air," which can
be found in her collections "When the Lights Go Down" and "For Keeps." The
expected salient observations are made: that the movie has a crummy,
hurried-up look, that the late Paddy Chayefsky's prophetic screenplay is
scatterbrained, and that William Holden's a marvellous camera subject once
he decided that he didn't need movie goddess tricks to cover up his age.
(Panicky Warren Beatty should follow suit.) You can't fault personal taste
either: if a movie doesn't appeal to her, it just doesn't appeal. However,
as readers of her criticism are well aware, Kael never let simplicity get
in the way of her "crow bar" examinations. "Hot Air" is an excoriation of
Chayefsky's supposed case of the N.Y. hates, with the boob tube used as
his central metaphor. As you read the first paragraph of this lengthie,
your radar is swirling: My God, how can she miss what's so obvious? She
discerns the author's rant on television, then blows it by using his
hatred-warning against him. Crashing blindly into her own rhetoric, she
berates, "Television, he says, is turning us into morons and humanoids."
Not buying what has come to fruition, she asks, thousands of words later,
what is inherently answered in her question: when Howard Beale tells
viewers to scream, "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this any
longer," she reduns: "Is the viewers' obedience proof of their sheeplike
response to TV or is it evidence that the Prophet has struck a nerve -
that the public is as fed up as he is?" Kael somehow missed that it's
both. She commits her own coup de grace when foaming about this:
"Chayefsky, it seems, can be indignant about people becoming humanoids,
and then turn a somersault and say it's inevitable and only a fool
wouldn't recognize that. And he's wrong on both counts. There are a lot of
changes in the society that can be laid at television's door, but
soullessness isn't one of them. TV may have altered family life and social
intercourse; it may have turned children at school into entertainment
seekers. But it hasn't taken our souls, any more than movies did, or the
theatre and novels before them." Attacking Chayefsky for exactly what
television has done -- for being the very instrument that has robbed us of
our collective soul. Movies, theatre and books rarely alter a nation's
psyche because they require discrimination of purchase and effort in
assimilating. If not the omnipresent box, what then could have mugged us?
Corrupt politics? Pervasive amorality and violence? The contemptible
phoniness and hate of God squads? Not without the power of television.
Years ago, in "Movies on Television," the second article she penned for
The New Yorker before becoming one of its critics, Kael enunciated the
stunningly false principle that all we get from the box is television. The
piece a failure for the same reason "Hot Air" is -- her love of movies
(and books, jazz, classical music and theatre in descending order) had,
for too long, prevented her from acknowledging what so many recognized
even before NETWORK: that television is IT. You can't reject or fight TV's
promiscuous invasiveness by denying its power, which is in devouring all.
It's the black hole of Earth -- nothing escapes. The sad fact is, we've
all become little Dianas. Only our hots aren't generated by ratings, like
Diana's, but by trash, scandal and hate. Psycho Dan Rather wrote years ago
that "the camera never lies." In spite of wanting to believe the truism as
safeguard against ever lowering thresholds of standards, today we ask:
does the camera ever tell the truth?</P>
