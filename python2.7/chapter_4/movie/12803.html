<P> All genres of storytelling must establish and define the reality in which
 their stories take place. This challenge is even more difficult and thus more
 crucial to satire, where in the "comedy" lies mostly in style and theme. It is
 these basic principles upon which "The Truman Show" is based - the story of a
 reality within a reality, but neither are defined well enough to create for
 theme or substance. It's certainly clever, but not executed as such.</P>
<P> Entertainment in the 1990s has become more and more polarized. The big-budget
 movies and TV shows have continued to inflate in all aspects. More emphasis is
 placed on style over substance - who needs acting and writing when you've got
 special effects? Some efforts have been made to counter this inflation, most
 notably a rapid increase in independently-produced comedy and drama which
 claim to be driven by minutia of some sort, but with some exceptions, have
 exploited their "hooks" the same way the blockbusters exploit their budget. </P>
<P> Perhaps this film serves as some kind of ultimate alternative to the major
 forms of entertainment. It presents us with an antithesis of fiction -
 reality.  Truman Burbank (Carrey), has been on television every day since his
 birth (hence the title) and has never suspected as much. We're invited to
 experience everything he does since there's no way of truly knowing what could
 happen. He lives in a small coastal town where everyone either directly or
 indirectly affects him since they're all actors who have been told what to do,
 but must improvise what they say and how they do things. </P>
<P> What would it be like to watch an ordinary person? One would think it would
 be boring, after all, isn't that the point of entertainment - to escape
 reality? Jerry Seinfeld said it best, "Everyone on TV is doing something
 better than you. You never see people sliding off the edge of the sofa with
 potato chip crumbs on their face." But this film would have us believe that
 would be completely fascinating, or at least in its reality. Viewers are glued
 to their television sets afraid to miss anything, while the corporation behind
 the project basks in the continued success of the show. Unfortunately, it is
 in this aspect the film is severely flawed. Little attention is given to the
 kind of world which would not only condone the whole idea of the show, but be
 enthralled by it. The few viewers we see are of the exaggerated, cartoonish
 sort, which does keep with the overall attitude, but there's no authenticity
 to anyone's motivation. The show's creator and director, known only as
 Christof (Harris), seems to care about Truman, yet he never hesitates to
 exploit him, even to the point of killing him, just because he can.</P>
<P> Another major flaw is in the storytelling itself. It's obvious as soon as the
 film opens what the premise is (as if the massive promotion hadn't already
 given it away). There's no sense of mystery since Truman is clued into the
 truth of his reality right from the get-go, and thus the plot is all about
 Truman's awareness of his situation and his attempt to escape it. The story
 would have worked better if we were just as clueless as Truman and had to
 figure it out too. Instead, everything is obviously phony, but it would have
 been interesting to see that phoniness presented as a reality.</P>
<P> Truman's world is that of "Nick At Nite" combined with every commercial ever
 made, which creates for many comical and satirical situations such as Truman's
 friend Marlon (Emmerich) who's always coming by with a six-pack of beer and
 says things like "it doesn't get any better than this," and his wife Meryl
 (Linnley) who only says bubbly, encouraging things to him. Besides losing his
 "father" in a boating accident as a child, his life has been peachy.</P>
<P> It would seem only natural for themes about the mass hypnotism of television
 and the media to crop up, but the film doesn't take advantage of the
 situation. Truman is a prisoner, and this idea of imprisonment by the media is
 one of the film's predominant themes, but it's not as powerful as could be due
 to the jumbled script. There's just not enough motivation to justify the idea
 of "The Truman Show;" why it was created, why it is successful, why any of the
 cast or crew members are involved with the show, and most importantly, why the
 show has run smoothly for 30 years without Truman catching on.</P>
<P> Not to say that "The Truman Show" is without resonance. It is interesting and
 thought-provoking due to its premise, but premise alone isn't a bankable
 niche. </P>
