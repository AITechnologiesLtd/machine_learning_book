<P>In many ways Roberto Benigni's "Life is Beautiful" is a courageous 
motion picture. After all, I don't believe anyone in the past has had 
the audacity to set a comedy against the backdrop of the very serious 
Holocaust, nor would anyone want to. By creating such a light-hearted 
tone for a film about one of the most cruel and heartbreaking periods in 
recent history, it would be easy to offend viewers, especially those 
whom have a personal connection with the Holocaust. Benigni, however, 
who directed the film and stars in the lead role, somehow succeeds at 
such a genre-bending convention (or unconvention, if you think about 
it), finding just the right balance between humor and drama so that the 
film in no way is condescending to the subject matter.</P>
<P>The film begins as the Jewish-Italian Guido, a happy-go-lucky fellow 
(Benigni), arrives in a postcard-perfect Tuscan village where he stays 
at his uncle's home and obtains a job as a waiter at a nearby ritzy 
restaurant. Almost immediately, Guido runs into, or shall we say is hit 
by, the beautiful, kind schoolteacher Dora (Nicoletta Braschi) when she 
accidentally falls from a barn. After a pleasant and rather mystifying 
meeting, fate seems destined to bring the pair together when he runs 
into her a few more times (literally, when he crashes his bike, and 
figuratively, at the school where she works). The first hour of "Life is 
Beautiful" is a winning, sweet, and often funny romantic comedy, and 
Benigni constantly reminded me of the old comic greats Buster Keaton and 
Charlie Chaplin.</P>
<P>Seven years pass and we discover that Guido and Dora are now married and 
have a young son (Giorgio Cantarini). All is well in their lives, and at 
the bookstore Guido owns, until anti-semitism slowly begins to make 
appearances in the village, first by having store signs put up saying, 
"No Jews or Dogs," and then by having their own home torn apart. 
Ultimately, Guido and his son are taken away to a concentration camp and 
are split apart from Dora, who is forced to go with the female 
prisoners. Through the horrors of the Holocaust which are only briefly 
shown in a shocking and haunting image of a mountain of dead bodies, 
Guido keeps his spirits up and tells his son that everything is only a 
game, and if they are the first people to reach one one-hundred points, 
they will win the grand prize: a real, life-size tank to ride home on.</P>
<P>For its first hour, "Life is Beautiful" is a film full of magic, 
recalling the days of those '40s and '50s musicals. In its romantic 
story involving Guido and Dora, the film contains an undeniable 
innocence that is rarely seen in today's films, and as our protagonist, 
Guido (effervescently played by Benigni) is a pure charmer.
In its second half, the film becomes more tricky, since it was up to 
Benigni to keep the picture's light tone while still being realistic 
about the life of a Jew in a concentration camp. When taking into 
consideration Steven Spielberg's brilliant 1993 Holocaust drama, 
"Schindler's List," the Holocaust in "Life is Beautiful" is like a walk 
in the park. No on-screen violence is depicted, although there are hints 
of the gas chambers that look like showers, but on the other hand, the 
film not once actually treats the Holocaust as a joke. Instead, the 
picture attempts to portray a hopeful and spirited man that 
unfortunately happens to be a Jew in the 1940's and therefore is sent 
away to what is basically a horror show. If the film had actually become 
heavy on violence and brutality in this section, then the tone would 
have been ruined. It is clearly due to Benigni's artistry in filmmaking 
that he is easily able to mix these two differing elements so that it is 
neither too goofy or too sad.</P>
<P>"Life is Beautiful" honestly only missteps once, but it is in this flaw 
that detains the film from being a possible contender as one of the ten 
best of 1998. The penultimate sequence took a sudden u-turn into the 
realms of a sort of fantasy and, without giving it away, I found its 
last plot development to be entirely unbelievable and abrupt, as if 
Benigni was trying to rush to a quick conclusion so that the film would 
be over. Perhaps if the running time had contained an extra ten minutes, 
these occurrences would not have been so difficult to swallow. As it 
remains, the unfortunate ending takes away the possible greatness "Life 
is Beautiful" so clearly held, but the film is still an achievement, 
particularly because of Benigni, who took an almost impossible concept 
and brought it vibrantly to life.</P>
