<PRE>              STAR WARS: THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (THE SPECIAL EDITION)
                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>**** (out of 4 = excellent)
1997, PG, 130 minutes [2 hours, 10 minutes]
[fantasy]
Starring: Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Harrison Ford (Han Solo), Carrie
Fisher (Princess Leia), Billy Dee Williams (Lando Calrissian), James Earl
Jones (voice of Darth Vader), written by George Lucas, Leigh Brackett,
Lawrence Kasdan, produced by Gary Kurtz, directed by Irvin Kershner.</P>
<P>"The Empire Strikes Back" will always be considered the best or the worst of
the "Star Wars" trilogy. Unlike the other two films, there is no major
victory here and bad things happen to the heroes. On the other hand, this
film contains the greatest amount of detail, continues the definition of The
Force and the universe, and establishes a vivid mood, all of which can be
just as moving as the swashbuckling adventure.</P>
<P>Truly the most notable improvement for the special edition re-releases of
these films is their images on a big screen and digital surround sound. I
don't remember seeing this movie in theaters back in 1980, so I have
essentially become four years old again as I am able to view this film as it
was meant to be seen. </P>
<P>I noticed many things happening around the perimeters and in the background
that had either been cut or unfocused before. Also, the sound and sound
effects editing are greatly improved with this edition; you can hear pieces
of debris hitting the ground; people talking in the background; and every
footstep on the metal floors.</P>
<P>Unlike the special edition of "Star Wars," this print does not contain as
many additions. The first major enhancement occurs early in the film as Luke
Skywalker is held captive by the snow monster. In the original version the
monster scene seemed like a bit of a cop-out, but now it actually has some
meaning to it. When Luke uses his lightsaber to defeat the monster, it
doesn't seem so "implied" anymore because of the detail.</P>
<P>One of the best aspects to this film is its mood and atmosphere, especially
that of Yoda's swamp planet Degobah and Lando Calrissian's Cloud City. Cloud
City was already a beautiful, blissful place and although only a few
enhancements are added here, they are profound on a subconscious level. When
the Millennium Falcon arrives, it is shown flying throughout the entire city,
and we can see people and buildings in the background; it no longer looks
like a studio set at all. When characters walk by windows, we can see
activity happening outside, instead of just still pictures. In fact, of the
greatest enhancements only lasts a few seconds - as Lando uses a public
address system to warn the population to flee the city, we see hundreds of
people stop in the streets, in the halls, and in their homes to listen.</P>
<P>Luke's Jedi training is one of the most important elements in all of the
films, and the words of Yoda are so simple and yet so profound at the same
time. I have heard The Force is a Hollywood disguise for New Age philosophy,
but I doubt it. This is a completely different universe and its ability to
define such a complex place through relatively simple methods is nothing
short of genius.</P>
<P>"The Empire Strikes Back" could be seen as the best of the trilogy for its
definition of its reality and great designs. Or it could be seen as the worst
of the series because of its sad tone and choppy storytelling (I always
wondered how Luke knew where to find Han and Leia out of the entire galaxy
and how Darth Vader knew Luke was coming). But it's the fascinating story
that makes this a great film. (2/24/97) (6/11/97) [see "The Empire Strikes
