GONE WITH THE WIND
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>There are few films that represent such thankless task for
any reviewer like GONE WITH THE WIND. This epic melodrama,
directed in 1939 by Victor Fleming, should be viewed less as
a movie and more like an institution. Unlike any other piece
of seventh art, it actually became the essential part of
popular culture in this century. And this shouldn't surprise
anyone, since GONE WITH THE WIND looks larger than all the
other movies, almost in the same proportion in which an
average movie looks larger than real life. Its epic
222-minute length (this is the longest movie the author of
this review has watched in cinema) is only partly
responsible for such impression. The images of this film are
the most recognisable, the scenes are most memorable, the
protagonists are the most iconic and the lines are the most
quoted. Another example of its greatness is the fact that
the official "making of" documentary has more than two hours
of length. More than 60 years after its premiere, there are
still new generations of viewers ready to be enchanted by
its mythical quality. Thus the popularity of GONE WITH THE
WIND is perpetuated and it remains the most popular and most
beloved film of all times, almost destined to beat any
similar competition in near future, STAR WARS and TITANIC
included. Such enduring movie phenomenon also attracted
attention of thousands of critics and film scholars in the
last 60 years, so it is next to impossible to write anything
original about it.</P>
<P>The plot of the film, based on the novel by Margaret
Mitchell, begins in Georgia at the eve of American Civil
War. Scarlett O'Hara (played by Vivien Leigh) is a 16-year
old and stunningly beautiful daughter of wealthy
slave-owning aristocrat, equally unimpressed by armies of
young suitors and news about impeding crisis. Her heart
belongs to Ashley Wilkes (played by Leslie Howard), young
and handsome son of the neighbouring plantation owner.
Scarlett is devastated when she hears that Ashley intends to
marry his plain cousin Melanie Hamilton (played by Olivia de
Havilland). This news coincides with the official
declaration of war and Ashley, like all the other Southern
aristocrats of his generation, decides to join the ranks of
Confederate army. Scarlett, in the desperate attempt to stay
close to Ashley, marries Melanie's clueless brother Charles
(played by Rand Brooks) who would also join military ranks
only to succumb to pneumonia before any actual fighting.
Soon afterwards Scarlett decides to go to Atlanta and live
with Melanie who would greet her with open arms, blissfully
unaware of Scarlett's feelings towards Ashley. In the
meantime, Scarlett has caught attention of Rhett Butler
(played by Clark Gable), estranged son of Southern
aristocrats, who, unlike the rest of his generation, seems
unchained by the unwritten codes of Southern honour and
conventional morality. He is convinced that Scarlett shares
some of those traits and their relationship would be forged
in the dark days following Southern defeat, Northern
occupation and post- war Reconstruction.</P>
<P>GONE WITH THE WIND is often viewed as the best example of
filmmaking in the Golden Age of Old Hollywood, the period
marked by the lavish period productions, film studios
resembling ancient empires and stars having god-like powers
over the audience. There were certainly better or more
important films created in this period, but none of them
managed to perpetuate its magic through the decades. The
main reason probably lies in the fact that GONE WITH THE
WIND, unlike any other similar project of the period,
gathered the best Hollywood talents and almost anyone tried
to give at least some kind of contribution, starting with
four different directors and four different screenwriters,
all guided by the determined hands of producer David O.
Selznick. It seems that all those Hollywood people
subconsciously knew that their world is going to end in a
decade or two, and were driven by the desire to leave the
lasting mark on the motion picture. Result of their efforts
is a film that is the everlasting monument to the bygone era
of filmmaking.</P>
<P>The choice of talents for this film was nearly flawless. Two
main actors seem almost born for this role. Clark Gable
might have been not so enthusiastic about his role of Rhett
Butler, but the audiences and the critics through the
decades thought otherwise - his suave, cynical but charming
black sheep of Southern aristocracy seems convincing despite
not having recognisable Southern accent. British actor
Leslie Howard, cast as Ashley, was even less comfortable in
his role of Southern aristocrat, but he still delivers the
goods, successfully hiding an indecisive wimp under the
illusion of "noblesse oblige". But the greatest acting
achievement belongs to Vivien Leigh, British actress being
cast as Southern belle against all odds. Her skills in
displaying various emotions in a character that changes
through the years are evident, as well as her determination
to master the Southern accent. Vivien Leigh's zeal for this
role was awarded by "Oscar", and that zeal was again evident
in another "Oscar" calibre performance in A STREETCAR NAMED
DESIRE twelve years later. Olivia De Havilland was almost
equally impressive as less complex but almost equally strong
character of Melanie. Supporting actors were also very good,
including Hattie McDaniel in the "Oscar"-awarded role of
Mammy, Scarlett's slave nanny.</P>
<P>Superb acting talent was followed by superb production
values. Costumes and architecture of 1860s South are
painstakingly recreated, with William Cameron Menzies
enjoying benefits of special effects quite convincing for
that time. Suggestive photography and memorable images
(Scarlett watching the sunset, panoramic view of defeated
Southern army, destruction of Atlanta) follow the grand
scope of emotions. And the music by Max Steiner is also
excellent; its main theme is as legendary as the other
elements of film, still very recognisable, unlike any other
1930s film with the exception of musicals.</P>
<P>Like any other great movie, GONE WITH THE WIND left at least
some viewers unimpressed by its magic and some very eager to
point to its flaws. The most common and most obvious
objection to this film is its content, unacceptable for this
time and age. GONE WITH THE WIND, a movie responsible for
many popular misconceptions about American Civil War, gives
rather biased and, in many ways, historically inaccurate
portrayal of those crucial times of American and world
history. Margaret Mitchell's novel, influenced by the
romanticised and revisionist view of the Southern Lost
Cause, paints the Old South as a fairytale land of old,
chivalrous ideals and social harmony which fell prey to
evil, materialistic barbarians from the North. In this film
Southern blacks are quite content to have same rights as
cattle, and the phrases like "simpleminded darky" don't seem
insulting to them. Today's viewers, especially those who
adhere to the dogma of Political Correctness are easily to
tempted to look at GONE WITH THE WIND the same way they
would look at Hollywood movie about Third Reich based on the
writings of Joseph Goebbels. On the other hand, revisionist
and racist elements of the film are at least toned down with
the film's general humanism. Black character of Mammy works
as Scarlett's conscience, and the actress playing her broke
racial boundaries by being first black person to receive
Academy Award. (Ironically, the same actress was legally
forbidden to attend movie's premiere in the racially
segregated Atlanta cinema, which should gives another reason
to appreciate this film in its proper historical context.)
GONE WITH THE WIND also partially accuses Southern
aristocracy for the jingoism that contributed to the war and
future Southern misery. And the scenes of hundreds and
thousands of men being wasted in futile carnage suggest that
nothing, not even the Lost Cause of the Old South, justifies
war. This pacifist message, on the other hand, also
corresponded with the isolationist sentiments, so dominant
in late 1930s USA.</P>
<P>The less obvious flaw of the film is somewhat hidden by its
epic length. In the first hours of the film, characters and
their interaction is interesting because of the clear
historical context and important events in the background.
The plot doesn't simply revolve about Scarlett's romantic
dilemmas - she has some more important task to perform, like
staying alive and making sure that those around her survive
the hard times. But once the war and post-war hardships are
behind Scarlett, GONE WITH THE WIND in the last hour or so
degenerates into pure melodrama, closer to daytime soap
operas than to anything we usually associate with "larger
than life" movies. Thankfully, the ending, despite all its
sappiness, wraps it all up. Few memorable lines and the
everlasting image at the end restore the epic character of
GONE WITH THE WIND, great film so unlike its title.</P>
