<P>Starring David Byrne, Chris Frantz, Jerry Harrison, Steven Scales. Not
Rated (nothing offensive).</P>
<P>As music films go it seems to be an accepted fact that Stop Making Sense
is second to none. The Talking Heads concert film has been out of
circulation for a long time, but it is now getting a theatrical
rerelease on its 15th birthday. On a dazzling restored print it's all
the better: an electrifying rock experience. Jonathan Demme's (The
Silence of the Lambs) film has it all: great music given a backbone of
top-notch camerawork and editing.</P>
<P>The music is courtesy of Talking Heads, a popular Rock/New Wave band
evidently proclaimed by some to be the most influential of the 80s. Its
lead singer David Byrne is that rare breed: a stage presence both
enigmatic and energetic. Most of the fun of Stop Making Sense comes from
watching Byrne's on stage antics as he and his band jubilantly plow
through 15 of their own songs. The songs, I admit, are not all
superlative: some are redundant and others just didn't appeal to me, but
as a whole I was impressed with the Talking Heads' (whom I've never
heard before I first saw the original version of the film a couple years
ago, by the way) repertoire.</P>
<P>This is an unusual concert film. There are barely ever any audience
reaction shots or music video intercuts: the camera focuses solely on
the band. It's very much a better movie for it; these kinds of songs are
better watched than listened to and frequent cuts away from the action
would have heavily distracted from the kinetic performance the Talking
Heads put on. Jonathan Demme made sure the film would be pure with no
artificial tricks (now accepting thank-you notes for not saying
"flavors") by the camera or by anything else.</P>
<P>The highlight of the show is a number called "Once in a Lifetime".
Byrne, looking unnervingly like Gregory Peck in To Kill a Mockingbird,
sings the Talking Heads' most distinctive song; a hypnotic intercutting
of a wonderful melody and something I can only describe as chanting. The
lyrics, too, are something to think about. They come off as gibberish at
first but, like most of their work, after a little pondering, they begin
to make sense.</P>
<P>If I put in a CD and listened to the music of the Talking Heads for 90
minutes, I would be bored. If I watched a 90 minute Talking Heads music
video I would be bored. Stop Making Sense, while simple, enchanted me.
It's just like watching a concert, yes, but what a concert it is! I've
never seen a musical group put on a better show and I've never seen a
show's spirit captured better than this.</P>
<P>See it. See it now. See it while you have the benefit of the big screen
and the surround sound. See it while you have the opportunity to watch
it as it was meant to be, with a brand new, restored print. Don't let
the "concert film" idea throw you off; most "regular" films can only
dream of being as good as Stop Making Sense.
