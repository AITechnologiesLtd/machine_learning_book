4 Little Girls (1997)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 42 </PRE>
<P>"4 Little Girls" is a Spike Lee production and his first
documentary.  The film is about a 1963 terrorist bombing 
of a church in Birmingham, Alabama by segregationalists,
killing four black children who were attending Sunday 
school. </P>
<P>"4 Little Girls" is like no other Spike Lee film.  He
stays behind the camera, and the political, social and
racial aspects of the bombing are downplayed.  The focus
of the documentary is on the victims, their short lives,
and their family members and friends who continue to 
grieve to this day. </P>
<P>Through the 1950s to mid-1960s, Birmingham was one of the 
most segregated city in the South.  Many members of the
police force were also members of the Klan.  The 1963
church bombing was the twenty-first for the city.  The
hate-filled segregationist that was responsible was
well-known, but was not put on trial until 1977.  He had
committed many such bombings, but moved with impunity
because segregation was the law of the land.  Even the
state Governor, George Wallace, was a hard-core segregationist, 
and is shown in an old video clip blocking the entrance to a 
school, surrounded by state guardsmen. </P>
<P>The political conflict between the segregationists and
civil rights leaders such as Dr. Martin Luther King, and
the demonstrations led by young adults (one scene has
police turning fire hoses on them) are the most interesting
parts of the documentary.  I would have graded this documentary
higher had this subject been the film's focus. </P>
<P>Instead the focus is on the four girls killed in the church 
bombing.  There are exhaustive interviews with friends and 
family.  When a friend breaks from telling a rembrance to sob, 
the camera makes certain to capture the lengthy moment of 
private grief for permanent video preservation.  The mother 
shows her daughters' scout uniform, her dolls, her toys.  
These scenes, drenched in grief, are significant only because 
the daughter was brutally murdered, and the murder itself is 
significant primarily as a milestone in the struggle for equal 
rights. </P>
<P>One element that bothered me about the documentary is the 
depiction of the four victims as young children.  Three of
the four were fourteen years old: teenagers, not little girls.  
The fourth victim was eleven.  The reverend Jesse Jackson 
refers to them as "innocent babies."  Certainly they were 
innocent, and no one of any age deserves to die in an act of 
terrorism, but they were not babies.  Bill Cosby has a brief 
scene where he states that the victims could have been Harvard 
graduates and could have become doctors.  Well, they could have 
become U.S. Presidents, but it isn't necessary to speculate
about their future in order to get across the tragedy and 
injustice of their deaths. </P>
<P>I know that I come across as insensitive by criticizing 
"4 Little Girls."  I realize that I may be the only person who
has seen it and not given it a very positive review.
However, I believe that it is wrong to raise the grade of a 
film because of its subject, no matter how important. </P>
