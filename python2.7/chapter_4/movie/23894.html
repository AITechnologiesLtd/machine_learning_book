<PRE>JOE GOULD'S SECRET
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>Stanley Tucci should stick to acting.  As a director, he lets JOE
GOULD'S SECRET run down like a tape player with a rapidly dying battery.</P>
<P>Although admittedly not as bad or as ambitious as his last movie, the
audacious failure called THE IMPOSTORS, this latest movie of Tucci's
hasn't much to recommend it other than its period sets.  There is a
sterling supporting cast (Patricia Clarkson, Hope Davis, Steve Martin
and Susan Sarandon), but they are so underutilized that they hardly
count.  Imagine arranging for Steve Martin to be in your movie and then
giving him a throwaway part.  What a waste.</P>
<P>The movie, set in the 1940s, is based on a true story of a writer for
The New Yorker, Joe Mitchell (Tucci), who finds an eccentric
motor-mouth, Joe Gould (Ian Holm), who he thinks would make a wonderful
subject for an article.  This disheveled Bohemian spends his time in
restaurants and art galleries begging, claiming that he is collecting
for the "Joe Gould Fund." He says that he is working on an oral history
of the city that already encompasses over a million words.  The tome
contains the random thoughts of the people he meets.</P>
<P>Ian Holm, who looks like Robinson Crusoe in a Goodwill suit, overacts
with a vengeance.  When a waitress complains about Joe's emptying an
entire bottle of ketchup on his food, he jumps up on his chair and
screams out, "I'm no ordinary person!  I'm Joe Gould!"  Holm's
performance, although cute at first, quickly becomes repetitive and
irritating.  With each successive picture, Tucci increasingly encourages
his actors to overdo it and aims too often for camp.</P>
<P>Yes, Joe has a secret, but, not only is it easy to guess, it's also not
very interesting.  The first half hour of the picture is worth
recommending, but after that, you're better off giving up rather than
staying with it.  Like the Cheshire cat, the movie slowly fades away.
But, rather than leaving only a smile, all the movie leaves are some
pristine-perfect period automobiles and other set decorations.</P>
<P>JOE GOULD'S SECRET runs 1:44.  It is rated R for some language and brief
nudity and would be acceptable for teenagers.</P>
