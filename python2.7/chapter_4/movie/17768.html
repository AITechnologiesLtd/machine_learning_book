<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>     I've been putting off this review for a long time.  I saw it at
Waterworks Cinemas in Pittsburgh about three weeks ago and haven't gotten
around to reviewing it until now: three days after it won several academy
awards.  Why?  Like with Saving Private Ryan, I have an incredible
difficulty having my words do justice to this film.</P>
<P>     Life is Beautiful centers around Guido (Roberto Benigni), a Jewish
waiter.  The first half, a hilarious and uplifting story, concerns his
wooing of Dora (Nicoltette Bruschi, real-life wife of Benigni), an
upper-class girl engaged to a man she does not love.  The second half, both
terribly sad and terribly joyous, concerns Guido's, Dora's, and their son
Joshua's internment at a death camp during WWII, during which Joshua is told
by his father that `it is all a game' in order to emotionally shield him
from the holocaust.</P>
<P>     In the opening of the movie, Benigni lets his comedic talents shine:
the first scene seems directly derived from the classic comic bit about the
brakes of a car failing, with a twist put in.  As the car speeds through a
village expecting the king and as Benigni tries to wave people out of the
way, they wave back, mistaking him for their ruler.  Very quickly the actual
plot appears, when Dora and Guido meet while they are fixing the car's
brakes at a farm.  Dora has been stung by a wasp on the leg and Guido
gallantly offers to suck the poison out.</P>
<P>     Watching these first scenes, you almost forget that the film's plot
concerns the holocaust.  Schindler's List bombarded you from frame one with
harsh imagery, giving you a generally depressed feeling about it, but Life
is Beautiful opts to take a comedic approach (no small effort) and makes you
feel good instead.  I would think that approach number two is the better one
(not to call judgment on a better film), for Schindler's List drowns you in
pessimism until the end, where as Life is Beautiful gives you a fair mix of
optimism and realistic pessimism.</P>
<P>     The first half showcases brilliant screenwriting as each joke is more
well-placed than the last, and often just as funny.  Benigni is willing to
do kid's humor of broken eggs in a hat, the adult humor of sucking the wasp'
s venom out, and the tongue-in-cheek humor that dots Benigni's conversations
with his uncle (Giustino Durano).  Benigni and Bruschi draw on past
collaboration with The Monster and Johnny Toothpick in order to create a
near-perfect bond between the two.</P>
<P>     When the film hits phase two it seems to take an abrupt turn to the
serious: the third scene you are greeted with has Joshua asking his father
why a sign says `No Jews or Dogs'.  Even then, Guido tries to shield his son
from the world around him by telling him that they just don't want Jews in
their shop or Dogs in their shop, promising to place a sign in his shop
tomorrow that says: `No Spiders or Visgoths.'</P>
<P>     The next day, Guido and Joshua are shipped off to the concentration
camp.  Dora, unwilling to leave her husband, demands to be put on the train
with them.  Even inside of the camp, Guido is unwilling to inform his son
that anything bad is happening.  He tells him instead that the camp is part
of an elaborate game.  The object is to get a thousand points and the winner
gets a real tank.</P>
<P>     Life is Beautiful is a strange contrast to the pessimism often seen in
movies.  For one, you love the characters so much that you want everything
good for them, despite the circumstances.  For two, you are given a positive
message to leave with instead of a negative one.  For three, the movie has
the ability to make you laugh, smile, and cry, both from tears of joy and
grief.  Make sure you see it.  If you can't watch it in theatres, then rent
it when it comes out, but see it.  See it because, as the movie will tell
you, life truly is beautiful</P>
