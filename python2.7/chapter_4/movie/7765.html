<P>     When Bille August searches for a new project, he rarely looks for 
something that isn't a challenge.  His ambitious films have included the 
acclaimed PELLE THE CONQUEROR (based on the novel by Martin Andersen 
Nexo), THE BEST INTENTIONS (from a script by the legendary Ingmar 
Bergman), THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS (based on the novel by Isabel 
Allende), and SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW (based on the novel by Peter Hoeg).  
In some ways, August's JERUSALEM (which he actually completed before 
SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW, although it's only now receiving U.S. 
distribution) is like an cross between Lars von Trier's BREAKING THE 
WAVES and something by Bergman.  Set against a backdrop that the great 
Swedish director would find familiar, JERUSALEM takes a sober, 
unflinching look at the issues of faith and piety -- subjects that von 
Trier tackled in his controversial film. </P>
<P>     JERUSALEM is a dramatically rich and rewarding motion picture 
featuring a number of deeply-realized characters.  August uses his 
canvas to explore not only issues of faith and spirituality, but more 
human matters, such as betrayal, lust, and longing.  As is often the 
case with movies possessing great melodramatic sweep, the gap between 
success and failure is a narrow one; August bridges it skillfully by 
getting us to empathize with several key characters.  The resulting 
rapport is vital to our appreciation of the film. </P>
<P>     Although the events of JERUSALEM take place one-hundred years ago, 
at the end of the nineteenth century, they are relevant today, when an 
increasing number of fringe religious groups are making the news.  One 
of many things that this film excels at is examining the development of 
a cult, both from an internal and an external perspective.  August is 
careful to remain non-judgmental in his approach to the subject, and 
this results in a balanced, cliche-free exploration of how fringe sects 
are born and why apparently well-adjusted men and women join them. </P>
<P>     JERUSALEM opens in a small Swedish mountain village where Christian 
fundamentalism is the rule of life.  We are introduced to the 
protagonists as children, then watch them grow quickly into adulthood.  
There's Ingmar (Ulf Friberg), the taciturn, hard-working, orphan son of 
the village hero, and Gertrud (Maria Bonnevie), the daughter of one of 
the village's most pious residents.  Ingmar is closer to Gertrud than he 
is to his own sister, Karin (Pernilla August), who is a decade older and 
married.  Once Ingmar is of age, he decides that he wants to marry 
Gertrud, but, to do so, he must head north and work at a sawmill to earn 
enough money to support a family.  He is gone for a long time, and 
Gertrud begins to doubt if he will ever return for her. </P>
<P>     Meanwhile, a charismatic stranger named Hellgum (Sven-Bertil Taube) 
arrives in the village, performing apparent miracles to go with his 
fire-and-brimstone doctrine.  In a short time, he has amassed a loyal 
following who separate themselves from the rest of the townspeople, 
wanting to avoid contamination.  Karin and her husband become 
"Hellgumists", and Gertrud is about to join when Ingmar returns and 
declares his love for her.  Shortly thereafter, Hellgum departs for 
Jerusalem, where he intends to set up a paradise on earth for his 
followers, who are to wait a short while then come after him.   </P>
<P>     JERUSALEM works on two levels -- first, as a dissection of the kind 
of religious behavior that can be regarded as extreme, and, secondly, as 
an exploration of how human passion can ebb and flow and turn bitter in 
the face of "divine" pressure.  The film uses two distinct points-of-
view -- that of Ingmar, the logical, rational thinker, and that of 
Gertrud, who acts from the heart.  During the course of the movie, both 
undergo traumatic transformations as they cope with who they are, what 
they believe, and how powerfully capable they are of hurting each other.  
In the end, JERUSALEM pursues redemption, but not in a traditional 
sense.   </P>
<P>     In concert, the actors and August do marvelous jobs of letting us 
into the minds of the characters.  We don't see the Hellgumists as 
fanatics; instead, we understand why they believe as they do.  The same 
is true of Ingmar, who commits at least one vile act in his quest to 
obtain a lifelong goal.  In fact, there are several minor characters who 
become far more three-dimensional than the protagonists in countless 
lesser films.  Give credit to Pernilla August (the director's wife, who 
previously appeared in his THE BEST INTENTIONS), Ulf Friberg, Sven-
Bertil Taube, and especially Maria Bonnevie, whose tortured portrayal of 
Gertrud is one of JERUSALEM's strengths.  Also worthy of note is Lena 
Endre, whose role as Barbro earned her a Swedish Best Supporting Actress 
award.  Anyone looking for a familiar face will recognize that both Max 
von Sydow and Olympia Dukakis have small roles. </P>
<P>     JERUSALEM has a few flaws that keep it from becoming a truly 
transcendent three hours.  The beginning and, to a lesser extent, the 
ending are erratically paced.  This could be the result of the heavy 
editing that was necessary to condense a Swedish TV miniseries into a 
theatrical release of manageable length.  Additionally, there are times 
when the storyline strays a little too deeply into the realm of 
melodrama.  Overall, however, these are minor blemishes upon an 
otherwise remarkable and thought-provoking motion picture which rewards 
viewers with an experience that is both emotionally and intellectually 
enriching.  </P>
