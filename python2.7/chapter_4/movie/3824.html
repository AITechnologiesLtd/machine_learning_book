<P>     Director Ron Howard makes nice, fuzzy movies like BACKDRAFT and
THE PAPER.  They're "human" films, with an emphasis on gung-ho over
grit.  Cast in point: the absorbing APOLLO 13, which recounts the
real-life problems of a 1970 moon shot that left three astronauts
(played by Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, and Bill Paxton) stranded in space.
Though a bit too much in places, the story of how NASA got its boys
back home is some of the best dram you'll likely see this year.</P>
<P>     The core story, with its fine acting and great special effects, is
the draw here.  The characters could be a bit more human, or, at the
very least, Paxton could've cried "we're all gonna die, man!"  (THE
RIGHT STUFF is still a better portrait of these pioneers.)  There is
one good in-joke: Roger Corman has a cameo as a congressman.  If the
three guys in the capsule don't have much in the way of personality,
said deficiency never gets in the way of the action.  The efforts of
the NASA guys on the ground (spearheaded by a cool Ed Harris) gives
fresh meaning to the idea of "old-fashioned American ingenuity."</P>
<P>     The rest of APOLLO 13 is all overdone, of course, with Kathleen
Quinlan (as Hanks' astronaut's wife) spending all of her time looking
distressed, while James Horner's string-section tries very hard to
overpower the DTS Digital sound effects.  Sigh.</P>
<PRE>ITO NOTE:  Speaking of O.J., a great, related video pick is CAPRICORN 
           ONE (1978), the story of a faked Mars mission and the     
           government conspiracy behind it.  Guilty/not-guilty starred    
           alongside Elliot Gould, James Brolin, Hal Holbrook, Sam 
           Waterston, and Telly Savalas flying a biplane. Check it 
           out.</PRE>
<PRE>BOTTOM LINE:  A blast.</PRE>
