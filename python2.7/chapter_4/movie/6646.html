<P>     Bio-pics have been a Hollywood staple about as long as there has been
a Hollywood, but recently an entire sub-genre seems to have popped up
based on the tragic romances of real-life figures.  Beethoven in IMMORTAL
BELOVED, Dora Carrington in CARRINGTON, C. S. Lewis in SHADOWLANDS,
Picasso in SURVIVING PICASSO and Richard Feynman in INFINITY all have been
given solemn film treatments which play the "tortured/emotionally
repressed artist" card for all they are worth.  Some of these films worked
and some did not, but many of them inspired the question of whether we
would care all that much about the people involved if one or both of them
were not famous.  THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD is a polite, well-acted drama which
covers the same ground several times over in an hour and forty-five
minutes.</P>
<P>     THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD opens in west Texas in 1933, where a young
student and part-time school teacher named Novalyne Price (Renee
Zellweger) meets Robert E. "Bob" Howard (Vincent D'Onofrio), a friend of
her then-boyfriend.  Bob is a successful writer of adventure tales for
pulp magazines -- many featuring a creation named Conan the Barbarian --
and Novalyne's own aspirations toward being a writer lead her to turn to
Bob for advice.  The two become friends and frequent companions, but Bob
has difficulty returning Novalyne's affections as he focuses on his
writing and caring for his sickly mother (Ann Wedgeworth).  Over the
course of two years, Novalyne and Bob share an evolving relationship in
which Novalyne is one of the only people allowed inside Bob's tangled
emotions.</P>
<P>     THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD manages to stay fairly involving for much of its
running time largely thanks to the strong performances of the two leads.
Vincent D'Onofrio makes Bob Howard a complicated mix of Texas bluster and
buried pain, a fellow who lacks the emotional vocabulary to respond to
Novalyne's feelings.  Director Dan Ireland captures him vividly as he
describes Conan's world to Novalyne, and in his verbal accompaniment to
his own composition; Howard's fantasy world becomes his great escape from
his own life.  Renee Zellweger does nice work with a tough part, a woman
who is attracted to the teller of tall tales then finds herself unable to
"civilize" him.  She walks a fine line between anachronistic liberation
and discomfiting masochism, yet generally finds the right note of earnest
frustration.  Together Zellweger and D'Onofrio make an intriguing pair, a
couple of kindred spirits who nevertheless are quite obviously wrong for
each other.</P>
<P>     Therein lies THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD's fundamental flaw as a romantic
drama:  it is never really possible to root for the protagonists to end up
together.  Michael Scott Myers' script is based on an autobiographical
memoir by Novalyne Price Ellis, who clearly was deeply affected by her
friendship with Bob Howard.  As honestly felt as it might be, however, her
story lacks a narrative push.  Novalyne and Bob spend a lot of time
together, argue over philosophical differences, then make up; this process
occurs once then repeats three or four times.  The interaction between the
two is pleasantly interesting, but it isn't enough to sustain a story in
which neither character ends up changing very much.  The sad fact is that
the story might have been simply Novalyne's attempt to work through some
guilt issues (Howard committed suicide in 1935), and THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD
is affectionate without being compelling.  When Novalyne pronounces late
in the film that she was happy to have known Bob Howard, you don't doubt
her sincerity.  You just wonder why that sentiment warranted a feature
film.</P>
<P>     The only time THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD flirts with truly intriguing
material is when it focuses on Bob's relationship with his mother, played
with pallid possessiveness by Ann Wedgeworth.  There is an intense Oedipal
sub-text to Bob's obsessive need to care for his mother, and a scene in
which he changes her sweat-soaked nightgown after a feverish night is both
subtle and daring.  There is so much more going on in that relationship
than in the one between Bob and Novalyne that you wish Ireland or Myers
had recognized it.  But this is Novalyne's story, so she is always front
and center, static though she might be.  Don't expect a love story in THE
WHOLE WIDE WORLD.  At most it is a "like" story, and might have been
ignored politely if one of the two likers had not created Conan the
Barbarian.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 pulp afflictions:  5.</PRE>
