<PRE>Mission To Mars (3/10)</PRE>
<PRE>"You've got ten seconds."</PRE>
<P>"OK. Astronauts go to Mars. Encounter strange alien forces. Fate of crew
unknown. Rescue mission sent to Mars. Meet aliens."</P>
<PRE>"How much."</PRE>
<PRE>"Ninety million."</PRE>
<PRE>"Deal."</PRE>
<P>It probably wasn't quite like that, but I shudder to think that people
with the intelligence to tie their own shoelaces might actually have sat
down and thought this thing through. However Mission To Mars made it to
the screen, the result is a film which is not only as offensively stupid
as Armageddon, but which in an attempt to be spiritually uplifting has
an alien encounter even more crass and syrupy than the one which ruined
The Abyss. But the saddest part of all is that it's a Brian De Palma
movie. I've grown up watching his films, and although he has never
achieved the same artistic credibility as his fellow New Yorker Martin
Scorsese, he has always been a fine technician, as demonstrated in films
such as Carrie, The Untouchables, and the under-rated Blow Out. He has
also made a near masterpiece in Carlito's Way, but his technical skill
can't protect him from making the odd stinker, such as Body Double and
The Bonfire of the Vanities. And now Mission To Mars.</P>
<P>The film is crammed full of implausibilities, such as the re-boot of the
spacecraft's entire computer system, and the astonishing and quickly
glossed-over way the astronauts of the rescue mission, seemingly doomed
themselves, make their way to the Martian surface. Perhaps the funniest
is the survival of an astronaut who has lived for a year in a scrappy
windblown tent on the Martian surface - his oxygen and food being
provided by a few houseplants. Even if you buy this, the climate on Mars
might pose some other difficulties that are completely overlooked. Off-
hand, I don't know what the pressure and temperature of the Martian
atmosphere are. I'll just check. Temperatures vary from around minus 120
to minus 20 Fahrenheit and atmospheric pressure is around 0.7 percent of
Earth's. That took about three minutes to find out. Looking stuff up in
books. It's obviously a lost art in Hollywood. </P>
<P>Does scientific accuracy on movies matter? It depends. When the
spacecraft whoosh past us in Star Wars and the explosions roar, we can
forgive the film-makers for adding the sound effects because they
presumably took the view that the silence of space would detract from
the excitement. Scientifically inaccurate, but fair enough. Often,
however, getting the science right is as easy as getting it wrong and
will only help the dramatic impact of the story. There are no real
excuses for howlers like those in Mission To Mars. A message is coded in
the form of a DNA sequence. (The coding method used is ludicrous, but
we'll let that pass.) On seeing a few turns of the resulting DNA double-
helix displayed on a monitor, an astronaut concludes straight away that
the genetic information is "missing the last two chromosomes". OK, so
the writers don't have a clue about biology, and maybe neither do the
majority of moviegoers, but to get this sort of thing so hopelessly
wrong is pure laziness and is insulting to everyone.</P>
<P>If you can fight through the boredom and embarrassment, you'll find much
of the film strangely familiar. The opening sequence is straight out of
Apollo 13, and the references to 2001: A Space Odyssey are too many to
be accidental - the shape of the spacecraft, the rotating living module,
the dull but precise voice of the computer, the word-for-word reference
to "voice-print identification", and the astronauts in a white room
during their alien encounter. A knowing reference or two is fine, but
this is all a bit much.</P>
<P>The score by the once-great Ennio Morricone is simply awful - when it
isn't crashingly inappropriate it's spacey wallpaper for the ears. The
only thing in the film's favour is the lovely photography by long-time
De Palma collaborator Stephen H. Burum. In fact, his photography is so
good, it almost made the film worth watching. Despite the wonderful
images he has produced, I suspect he won't be introducing himself at
parties as the guy who shot Mission To Mars.  Neither can I see Tim
Robbins or Gary Sinise looking back on this movie as a high point in
their acting careers, although they are to be congratulated for managing
to keep a straight face throughout.</P>
<P>The biggest, but prettiest, heap of interplanetary hooey you'll ever
see.</P>
