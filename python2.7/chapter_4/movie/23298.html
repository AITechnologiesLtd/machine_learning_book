<P>         There's nothing about Michael Chabon's popular novel "Wonder
Boys" that screams "movie material." Its lead character is an English
professor, not a cop or a scientist. In place of a plot, Chabon simply
lays out the events from one bizarre weekend, including an accidental
murder (of a dog), a robbery (of a jacket that once belonged to Marilyn
Monroe), the breakdown of two marriages and lots of drug-taking.</P>
<P>On top of that, most of the characters are either writers,
editors or college administrators, not exactly the kinds of professions
that make for exciting viewing.</P>
<P>Smartly, when director Curtis Hanson and screenwriter Steve
Kloves ("The Fabulous Baker Boys") were putting together the film of
"Wonder Boys" they didn't try to impose a storyline or goose the action
quotient. Instead, they've simply taken most of the book's essence and
transferred it lovingly to the screen. Kloves' adaptation is so
faithful, in fact, that even the Alfred Stieglitz portrait of Georgia
O'Keeffe hanging over student Hannah Green's bed -- a throwaway
descriptive detail in Chabon's novel -- turns up in the movie.</P>
<P> What also surfaces is one of Michael Douglas' strongest
performances of the past decade. As an actor, Douglas has always been
strongest when playing disturbed (and often disturbing) men, as he did
in "The War of the Roses," "Falling Down" and, unforgettably, in his
Oscar-winning turn in "Wall Street." And Grady Tripp, the focal point of
"Wonder Boys," has plenty to disturb him.
 On the personal front, his wife has left him and his 20-year-old
boarder Hannah (Katie Holmes) seems anxious to take her place.
Meanwhile, Sara (Frances McDormand), the chancellor at the Pittsburgh
college where Grady teaches, has just told Grady she's pregnant with his
child. Plus, there's the matter of James Leer (Tobey Maguire), the
spooky, gifted young writer who has seemingly attached himself to Grady.</P>
<P>         Professionally, Grady is in a funk because it's been seven
years since his last novel and he can't come up with an ending to his
sprawling new manuscript, which now stands at 2611 typewritten,
single-spaced pages. That worry is compounded by his old friend and
editor Terry Crabtree (Robert Downey Jr.), who's told Grady his job at
the publishing house is hanging by a thread and could disappear if the
new book is not a major success.</P>
<P> All these major and minor crises collide in the course of 72
hours and the quiet chaos they bring is beautifully orchestrated by
Kloves' script and Hanson's smooth, easygoing direction. There's
flintiness as well as warmth in McDormand's Sara, while Holmes brings
her usual earthy radiance to Hannah. In Maguire's tricky eyes you can
see the wheels of James' slightly warped mind grinding away. Only Downey
seems slightly flat.</P>
<P> "Wonder Boys" can best be described as a lighthearted dark
comedy which never pushes too hard in either direction. Like many a lost
weekend, it's frequently puzzling while it's going on but surprisingly
pleasant to look back on. James Sanford</P>
