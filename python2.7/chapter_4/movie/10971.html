<PRE>The Replacement Killers</PRE>
<PRE>by Fred M. Hung</PRE>
<P>Though born and raised stateside, I was fortunate enough to watch Hong
Kong action movies growing up.  And though my definition of the ultimate
hero is more Jack Ryan than Jackie Chan, I can still appreciate the
slickness of Chow Yun Fat.  Naturally, I was excited when I heard of his
debut in the American mainstream market in The Replacement Killers. </P>
<P>The plot is rather wafer thin.  Fat is an assassin who refuses to kill
his mark, a detective's son, and in doing so condemns himself to the ire
of his underworld employer.  To aid in his escape, fat solicits the aid
of forger Mira Sorvino.  </P>
<P>The atmosphere, however, is very Michael Mann-esque slick.  In addition
to Chow Yun Fat's smooth demeanor and solemn expressions, The
Replacement Killers is a cinematic exercise in mood setting.  Peter
Collister has filled every frame with midnight blues and metallic grays
enhanced by a neon-lit background.  The firefight sequences are
choreographed to a dance, with every draw and trigger pull an extension
of the characters themselves.  What Fat does not speak, he more than
expresses with the use of twin 9mm Berettas.  </P>
<P>Yet although the plot is thin, the not all the characters are not
completely uni-dimensional, close but not quite.  Fat's, John Lee, is
one of few words.  His dour face suggests a tortured soul beyond the
cool veneer.  His movement and form is so graceful, he becomes almost
mythological.  Fat certainly has presence, and while that is sufficient
to carry him through this film, his future projects could make better
use of his incredible acting range as yet not witnessed by Hollywood.  </P>
<P>Sorvino, though incredibly arresting and alluring, is wasted here.  Her
Meg Coburn attempts to be both Lee's grounding in sanity and firepower
assistance amidst the chaos.  Though Sorvino gives more than a valiant
attempt to breathe life into Meg, the plot does not give her room to
maneuver.  </P>
<P>The supporting actors, Jurgen Prochnow, Michael Rooker and Danny Trejo,
are all underutilized.  Prochnow impressed everyone as the stolid and
lonely captain in Das Boat.  Rooker was much more animate in
Cliffhanger, Sea of Love, and Days of Thunder, as was Danny Trejo in
Heat.  Being relegated to supporting roles notwithstanding, their
characters should have been more significant.  </P>
<P>The Replacement Killers, like Ridley Scott's Black Rain, is definitely
competent entertainment and not as mind-numbing as it easily could have
been.   Antoine Fuqua attempts to make no social commentary and only a
token address to morality, and thus the audience will find no dose of
profundity.  What the audience does find is Fat and Sorvino, radiating
ambiance behind a glossy backdrop of Los Angeles.</P>
