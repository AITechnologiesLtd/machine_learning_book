<P>Imagine Tennessee Williams penning a script for NBC's Must See TV
lineup and you'll have some idea of what director Robert Altman's
"Cookie's Fortune" is like. Though Altman is best known for such
incisive films as "Nashville," "The Player" and "Short Cuts,"
"Fortune" finds him in a mellow mood; it's a tale as easygoing and
eccentric as its characters.</P>
<P>What the movie does have in common with most of Altman's other works
is a mightily impressive cast, led by a delightfully batty Glenn
Close, the sweetly low-key Julianne Moore and the terrific Charles
Dutton, arguably the closest thing to a normal person Anne Rapp's
screenplay can come up with. So skilled is Altman at bringing out the
best from the people he works with that even the usually bland Liv
Tyler and Chris O'Donnell don't seem out of their league acting
alongside Close and Dutton. Though it's the screen equivalent of
cotton candy, "Fortune" is made with a very high grade of sugar.</P>
<P>The story is set in Holly Springs, Miss., where the suicide of kooky
Cookie Orcutt (Patricia Neal) triggers one sticky situation after
another. First, her nieces Camille (Close) and Cora (Moore) rearrange
evidence to make it look like Cookie was murdered since "nobody in
this family commits suicide - it's a disgrace," huffs Camille.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the women's meddling makes Cookie's old friend Willis
(Dutton) the most likely suspect and spoils his plans to cook up some
catfish enchiladas as a homecoming dinner for Emma (Tyler), a wanderer
who's just returned to town after some hard times in the big
city. Waiting for her with open arms is Jason (O'Donnell), a dopey but
kind cop who is assisting in the investigation into Cookie's demise.</P>
<P>"Fortune" is practically a catalog of quirks, from Cookie's garish
lavender sneakers and junk jewelery to Willis' protestation that he
never drinks "before Tom Brokaw."</P>
<P>The presiding wacko is Camille, an amateur writer and director nervy
enough to rewrite Oscar Wilde's "Salome" - and give herself a
co-authorship credit - for a church production, and so demented she
demonstrates Salome's Dance of the Seven Veils with a roll of toilet
paper and moves into Cookie's house hours after discovering her
body. "You'd think the police could at least take their stupid crime
tape with them when they leave," she crabs as she tramples evidence
under foot.</P>
<P>Altman's last film, the failed fashion industry expose "Ready To
Wear," was crucified for its formlessness and self-indulgence, and
from the evidence presented here, he must have taken those criticisms
to heart.  Though "Fortune" goes on a bit too long and includes a
couple of running gags that wear thin, for the most part it's a tight
little story that never leaves the audience behind. The lunacy proves
surprisingly contagious.</P>
