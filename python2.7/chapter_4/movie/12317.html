<P>Every so often in this industry, there is a project or talent that
creates a buzz. The title of that project takes on a mystique that
drives it through the rounds of dinner -talk, industry screenings and so
forth and so on. Occasionally these little films live up to their hype,
but most time they do not. For every good film screened at film
festivals around the country, hundreds may never see release outside of
a direct to video release. With the upcoming release of Lance Mungia's
"Six String Samurai", filmgoers are in for a rare and delectable treat.</P>
<P>The plot is a complete fabrication, creating its our history for it's
bizarre plot. In 1957, World War 3 has broken out. The last surviving
outpost of civilization is LOST VEGAS (!). The leader of the free world
is Elvis (the KING!). Our story picks up forty years later. The King is
dead and the quest is on for a new King. Every Rock and Roller with a
guitar from across the country makes their way to Lost Vegas to claim
the throne. One of these guitar-carrying warriors is a Rastafarian
looking heavy metal guitarist known as Death. He is systematically
killing off rivals to the throne. The other is Buddy (Jeff Falcon), who
carries his samurai sword, duck taped to the back of electric guitar.
Buddy is a man of few words. But, his actions speak volumes. But his
journey takes a decided turn when an 8-year-old boy joins him.</P>
<P> "Six String Samurai" is without a doubt one of the most original and
thoroughly surprising films of the past decade. While the plot is rather
episodic and slow at points the film more than makes up for it with its
goofy charm. This is film that not everyone will enjoy, but neither was
it meant to. 'Six String Samurai' comes from the same subversive
attitude that gave us such marvelous independent epics as 'Death Race
2000', 'Repo Man', 'Vanishing Point', and even 'Faster Pussycat, Kill,
Kill'.</P>
<P>The film belies its low budget origins by using some of the most
dazzling cinematography since 'The English Patient'. Kristian Bernier's
camera work is inspired. Death Valley has not looked this mystical and
majestic since John Ford. Almost every scene shines like a frame from a
David Lean epic. This is no faint praise. Considering what resources Mr.
Bemier had to work with, we are witnesses to a vital and wondrous new
talent. His work here rivals Dean Cundey's (Jurassic Park, Escape from
New York) best in terms of pure cinematic magic.</P>
<P>Director Lance Mungia carries the film with a flair that brings to mind
such diverse talent as Russ Meyer, Paul Bartell, and even John
Carpenter. Being his first feature film, it does have a raw edge, but
that edge gives this film a comedic drive that is sourly lacking from
the majority of films today. It would be a shame to see this talented
individual dropped into the direct to video market. The script for "Six
String Samurai' while being episodic, plays like a peyote inspired road
picture. There are moments of pure comedic joy in this film, with laugh
out loud hilarity. The action set pieces are staged and executed with a
style that is exhilarating. At a time when Hollywood is aping everything
from Hong Kong filmmakers, its refreshing to find a film that tries to
create it's own style. Yes, there are moments of Wu Shu style martial
arts, but they are used sparingly. The weapon of choice here is the
sword (as one character points out late in the film "We havent had
bullets since 1959"). So many techniques and styles are used in filming
the fight scenes that some of the references may be lost on most film
historians. You can be certain; you will see loving tributes to both
Akira Kurosawa, and Kenji Misumi (Lone Wolf & Cub).</P>
<P>Jeff Falcon, who plays Buddy (Holly?), has made a career in Hong Kong
working on over 15 films. Including "Inspector Wore Skirts." where he
had the fortune of getting whacked on the head with a Chinese pole by
Wei Yin Hung (My Young Auntie /1980). His performance in 'Six String
Samurai' is a caricature of the Sergio Leone "Man Without A Name"
anti-hero. Now playing the part of a man carrying a Gibson 335 guitar,
wearing Bifocals taped in the centerpiece, trudging across the desert
wastes is as daunting a performance as one can possibly imagine. While
the character of Buddy is written as an enigma, Mr. Falcon brings a
comic sensibility to the performance that is charmingly refreshing. But,
what we really what to see are the fight scene. Any film that has its
hero carrying a Samurai Sword had better have some fight scene. And
fight scenes it has. Copious fights scenes. Each one more inventive than
the one preceding it. Mr. Falcon may be the best screen fighter in the
U.S. since Charles Bronson in 'Hard Times' (1975).</P>
<P>The only week part of the film is the performance by Justin McGuire as
THE KID. While the performance is not necessarily bad, it is
indifferent. Since this is Mr. McGuire's first film, this can be excused
as just inexperience. However, Justin McGuire does exude a charm in some
scenes that contradicts his inexperience. Not having much dialogue in
this film, Mr. McGuire has to communicate with his eyes and body
language, which he does well.</P>
<P>To end up, "Six String Samurai" is a joyous celebration of movie making
by a team of filmmakers that were hell-bent on creating something unique
and special. It would be lest than flattering to say that they have
succeeded.
On a scale of ***** "Six String Samurai" rates ***=.  A charming example
of guerrilla filmmaking, And a loving tribute to a form of cinema that
has been missing for far too long.</P>
