<P>     WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT is a biographical sketch of the life
of Tina Turner (played by Angela Bassett), concentrating on the years
between the late 1950s and the early 1980s.  The focus is primarily on
Ms. Turner's disastrous marriage to Ike Turner (Larry Fishburne), the
man who created her career while nearly destroying her life.  Her
struggles to escape from under his abusive thumb and make it on her own
fuel this surprisingly effective film.</P>
<P>     Going into the movie, I have to admit that I wasn't optimistic.
It's all-too-easy to put together an exploitative film based on the
life of a well-known musical figure or group, and foist it on an
unsuspecting public.  Oliver Stone proved with THE DOORS that just
because someone in the music business is surrounded by controversy,
that doesn't mean that his or her life will translate into an enjoyable
motion picture.  However, where I found the story of Jim Morrison's
life to be dull and pretentious, I discovered energy and passion in
WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT.</P>
<P>     The music scenes are electric.  Superbly acted and choreographed,
they are some of the best of their kind to be found in any recent
movie.  While the voice of Tina Turner covers all her own songs, it's
impossible to tell that Angela Bassett's voice is being dubbed out.
Laurence Fishburne does his own singing.  The choice of music for the
soundtrack is also noteworthy; many of the songs will be familiar to
even those who have had limited exposure to Ike and Tina Turner.</P>
<P>     Punctuating the film's energized performances are several darkly
violent scenes.  These are frighteningly intense and starkly graphic,
not because they are especially bloody (although blood is in evidence),
but because the participants do such an excellent job at bringing to
the surface highly- believable emotions during the circumstances.
Often, abuse scenes are over-dramatized, but WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH
IT avoids that trap.  The goal of realism is attained.</P>
<P>     Angela Bassett, who was Betty Shabazz in MALCOLM X, plays an
outstanding Tina Turner.  Physically, she bears only a passing
resemblance to the singer (this is reinforced when Turner makes a brief
appearance in the final moments of the film during a concert), but she
has the mannerisms, vocal patterns, and explosive energy captured
perfectly.</P>
<P>     Larry Fishburne was already widely-known and well-respected coming
into WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT, but his performance as Ike Turner
will enhance his reputation.  He gets to play the hero and the
villain--the slickly charismatic singer transformed by jealousy and
drugs into a brutal beast.  Any Jekyll and Hyde personae demands
ability and range, both elements of which Fishburne exhibits.  His Ike
Turner has many facets, transcending the level of the common "bad
husband" (much as his character in DEEP COVER gave that movie more
substance than the script strove for).</P>
<P>     WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT is an exceptionally-paced movie.
Credit director Brian Gibson for this.  He avoids the tendency of
biographies to get mired in irrelevancies.  The film, nearly two hours
long, seems much shorter than its running length.  Gibson also manages
to neatly transition his project through the turbulent decades of the
sixties and seventies, effectively capturing the essence of those
eras.  It's not just the costumes and hairdos that reflect the times,
but the attitudes of the participants as well.</P>
<P>     You don't have to be a Tina Turner fan to appreciate this movie,
but no matter how you feel about her music, WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH
IT cannot fail to impart an impression of her courage and inner
strength.  Although ultimately a triumphant story, this biography
doesn't see its subject through rose-colored glasses.  It takes
chances, and that's why the movie works.  Visually impressive and
aurally dazzling, WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT is a great alternative
to some of the bloated, overbudgeted summer films.</P>
