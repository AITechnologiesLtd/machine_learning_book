<P>
Because of our current heat wave and my not wanting to really run the
AC in my apartment -- it only affects the bedroom, so having a climate
controlled living room TV session would require heroic efforts on the
part of my two little fans and severe damage to my Con Ed bill -- I
went to the local 2nd run movie house this Saturday.  Choices: "Twin
Dragons" or "Shakespeare in Love".  Not wanting to see a bad Jackie
Chan, I saw "Shakespeare".  About 30 minutes into the showing, I was
kicking myself for not seeing it when it first came out</P>
<P>The fanciful conceit is that Shakespeare is going through a severe case
of writer's block.  Called on to produce a comedy with at least some
pirates and a dog, he starts "Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter"
but doesn't get very far.  Things start clicking when he meets Viola De
Lesseps.  The comedy is transformed into the tragedy "Romeo and
Juliet".  This new play reflects and is reflected by Will and Viola's
brief affair: scenes are borrowed from Shakespeare's courtship of the
lady; she disguises herself as a man and acts as Romeo in the
production; passages from the draft inspire their lovemaking.  The film
is very good at visually entwining the play and the affair,
intercutting between rehearsals scenes and bedroom scenes.</P>
<P>There's, of course, trouble, or else "Romeo and Juliet" may well have
ended up as a comedy with a dog in it.  Fundamentally, Viola is the
prize in a marriage alliance.  Her wealthy merchant family intends to
marry her off to destitute nobility to secure a title for themselves.
The nobleman in question, of course, is a bastard (figuratively) more
interested in cash and dowry than in the anachronistically feminist
Viola, who goes to great lengths to break the taboo of women as actors;
young boys had played the women's roles.  It's for the love of poetry
and prose and the stage that she dons the wig and mustache and binds
her breasts.</P>
<P>The film's writers, Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard (Stoppard having that
high-brow cachet going for him), laced their script with scholarly
Elizabethan references.  I know a couple of them mainly because I've
read reviews on the film a while ago -- the boy fascinated with
stabbings is apparently a playwright from the period who specializes in
gore, the George Romero of his day.  The disguise of Viola as a boy is
in the long tradition of Shakespearean women dressing up as young men,
with "As You Like It" and "Twelfth Night" as prime examples.  There's
also the Superman/Clark Kent eyeglasses-as-disguise thing going:
Shakespeare doesn't recognize Viola, even though her boy disguise is
ridiculously thin.  This happens often in his plays.  I'm sure other
reviews can fill in on these touches.</P>
<P>Shakespeare's phrases are woven so thoroughly into the fabric of our
language that we're surprised when we look through Bartlett's and find
that many of the common sayings and clever quotes that we toss off come
from Shakespeare.  One wonders how Shakespeare must have looked brand
new.  One wonders how the first audience to see "Romeo and Juliet" may
have reacted.  This film should get bonus credits for evoking these
bits of wonderings.</P>
