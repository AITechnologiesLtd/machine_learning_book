<PRE>                          RETURN TO PARADISE
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Wow!  Pretty tough to imagine this
          not being the best film I see this year.  Three
          buddies committed a crime in Malaysia, two left the
          country, and one was caught.  If neither of the
          free buddies go back to stand trial the caught man
          will hang.  Whoever goes back will be volunteering
          for prison under horrible conditions.  An
          intelligent film about very tough moral decisions
          and their consequences.  Rating: 9 (0 to 10), high
          +3 (-4 to +4).  A very heavy spoiler after the
          review discusses the issues this film raises. This
          is a very good film but some of its issues cannot
          be discussed without disclosing plot twists.</PRE>
<P>     This is an adult film in the literal meaning.  It is a film that
does not sugar coat its view of reality.  Things do not happen in this
film because of wishful thinking the way they might in a Frank Capra
film.  RETURN TO PARADISE is a film without a safety net.  It asks the
right questions and does not provide the viewer with pre-digested
answers.  In A FEW GOOD MEN there are some interesting issues raised,
but there are giant neon signs telling the viewer which side to
sympathize with on the issues.  Independently of the Jack Nicholson
character's ideas, the script makes him an insulting male chauvinist.
The film entirely sidesteps the issue of whether Nicholson might be
correct about defense, he clearly is a villain.  RETURN TO PARADISE
also raises issues.  But it is not a morality tale.  It does not tell
the viewer what the answers are. There are no neon signs.</P>
<P>     Tony (David Conrad), Sheriff (Vince Vaughn), and Lewis (Joaquin
Phoenix) are having a good time together in Malaysia.  They are
drinking beer, seeing the countryside, getting into trouble, and
smoking cheap hashish.  They throw out the hashish they have not used
when Sheriff and Tony have to go home.</P>
<P>     Flash forward two years.  Sheriff is a limousine driver, and Tony
is an architect.  Lewis has spent the last two years in a Penang
prison.  Now the Malaysian government is going to hang Lewis as a drug
dealer unless he can prove he was only a user.  To do that he has to
produce the people who shared the drugs with him.  Informally the
Malaysian government says that they will give a total of six years
prison time to the one or two people who show up and will commute
Lewis's term.  Lawyer Beth (Anne Heche) is in New York and has the job
of convincing Sheriff and Tony to go and take their prison sentences so
Lewis will not be executed.  But how does one weigh the greater evil
when the prison is so bad that six years may be tantamount to a death
sentence or perhaps be enough to permanently unhinge the prisoner.</P>
<P>     Vince Vaughn and Joaquin Phoenix are perhaps better known as the
leads of CLAY PIGEONS.  Here they have a very different moral
relationship but their fates are similarly connected.  Anne Heche of
SIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS is the lawyer stuck with the task of getting two
men to give up years of their lives to save the life of someone they
hardly know.  The script is based on the film FORCE MAJEURE by Pierre
Jolivet. The original English language script was written by Bruce
Robinson  who wrote what I considered the best film I saw in the 1980s,
THE KILLING FIELDS.  And here he is connected with the best film I have
seen thus far in the 1990s.  Wesley Strict rewrote the script.</P>
<P>     RETURN TO PARADISE is a rare film experience.  It is an
intelligent and adult look at people making hard choices in the real
world.  I give it a 9 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +3 on the -4 to
+4 scale.</P>
<P>     Heavy spoiler.... Heavy spoiler....Heavy spoiler...</P>
<P>     If this film were only about the heavy price Sheriff and Tony were
being asked to pay to save Lewis's life, this would be a very good
film.  But it goes much beyond that.  Unfortunately one only realizes
the other issues of this film toward the end and I cannot discuss them
in the main body of may review.</P>
<P>     If one were to ask if freedom of the press is a good thing or a
bad thing, I think most of us would vote in favor.  We give the press a
broad range of freedoms in this country in the hopes that it will help
to topple dictators, or better yet never letting them get started.  We
do not want to let the government limit our freedom of expression, our
First Amendment rights.  If I were asked what is the downside of giving
this much power to the press the first example that comes to mind is
that we are giving the press the right to publish how to make dangerous
devices.  There have been issues in the past of magazines wanting to
publish instructions for building your own atomic bombs.  It is also
very timely that this film comes out just as a media barrage is
toppling a President.  There are certainly good arguments that the
press has overstepped its bounds.</P>
<P>     Our First Amendment really hamstrings us in controlling dangerous
information.  There are laws that may let us use restraining orders,
but deep down the First Amendment has given all the big guns to people
who want to make information available, for better or for worse.  In
the case in RETURN TO PARADISE it was a lost cause from the beginning.
The international press was going tell the world about Lewis's case.
That would anger the Malaysian government and they would punish Lewis.
Any nobility on the part of Sheriff and Tony would be misplaced.  (And
that really is something we rarely see in film.  The ethical thing to
do is rarely shown as being useless and pointless.)  As soon as the
press got hold of the story, it was out of the main characters' hands.
Lewis was going to die, not because of his crime, but because the
founding fathers felt the press had to be unrestrained.</P>
<P>     Another issue is raised in the film, that that we are much more
tolerant of drug use in this country than the rest of the world.  The
Malaysian judge has a very good point.  In his country children are
free from the risk of drugs.  Malaysia has a much lower risk of crime.
Our lax attitude on drug enforcement also has a heavy price.  We walk a
middle ground between either legalizing drugs or treating drug use as
harshly as the Malaysians do.  We are afraid to do the former and do
not have the stomach to do the latter.  And that middle ground of
shadow tolerance is also what kills Lewis in this film.</P>
