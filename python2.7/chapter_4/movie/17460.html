<P>THE GOVERNESS  (director: Sandra Goldbacher; cast: Minnie Driver, Tom
Wilkinson, Florence Hoath, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Harriet Walter, 1998
GB)</P>
<P>A heavy going and at times annoying, but, nevertheless, embroiling
drama. Minnie plays a Jewess in 1800s London, whose father is murdered
and leaves the family impoverished. She refuses to marry a rich man
chosen by her mother, instead she seeks employment and takes a job on
the Isle of Skye, Scotland, in order to support her family. She hides
her Jewish identity because a Christian is requested by the household.
Religion acts as an inhibiting and possessive experience throughout the
film, as the first time director weaves a tale of alienation and sexual
liberation in a Puritan type of setting.</P>
<P>The film opens powerfully as the Jewish ritual in the temple is shot in
chiarasco. It is easy to realize how difficult it is to break from one's
religious traditions if you are raised and indoctrinated with it. Minnie
has left her world of cities and Jewishness for a hostile gentile world
she cannot fathom. The starkness and loneliness of this rural area
leaves her agonized and deracinated. She subsequently finds romance with
the master of the house, the intellectually gifted Wilkinson (searching
for a method to make the photographic image permanent), who is a bit of
a prude and a bigot, though not as much as his bored wife (Walter) is,
who idly chatters about escaping her lonely world for one of culture. In
this perplexing type of atmosphere, Minnie is struggling to find who she
is, constantly put off by the foreign Protestant countryside and the
restictive family she is isolated with.</P>
<P>The flaws in the film are that the direction is at times unfocused, as
too many scenes are awkwardly shot and difficult to watch and
comprehend. There just seems to be too much internally going on for any
follow-up scenes to uncover all the loose ends that remain untied. The
Protestant family is way too complicated to gloss over its 19th century
life style. The film is too long and boring at times; and, the love
affair was not credible considering the lack of passion (these lovers
were just not a believable match);  and, the film hammers out too many
far reaching religious themes that it cannot properly address.</P>
<P>But the acting and cinemaphotography are superb. Everyone performs with
stagelike perfection. Minnie was alluring in her role as a governess. It
makes sense that her romance does not work, that her lies are uncovered,
and that she returns to her Jewish roots, vulnerable and ready to find
herself again. I, especially, was intrigued by her botanical walk scenes
with the repugnant young girl she tutors (Florence), as she forms a
genuinely warm relationship with her despite the child's obvious faults.
Her sexually explicit scenes with Wilkinson added to the religious
tremors of the film and the sense of her alienation, but since I did not
find their passion convincing, it was difficult for me to believe that
their relationship would have taken place.</P>
<P>THE GOVERNESS  is an absorbing, marvelously acted film, but not
necessarily an entertaining one.</P>
