The Road to El Dorado</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Rich rain forest green, as brilliant as those iridescent plankton at the
bottom of the ocean. And deep blue like the ocean too, pure crystal like
Linda Carter's eyes. Contrasted and balanced by crimson shadows cracking the
digital landscapes like a rainy day dawn casting blood-red beams across the
bottoms of surly purple storm clouds.</P>
<P>This may just be the first animated feature that's worth seeing for the
landscape scenery alone: a breath-taking crying waterfall, a flock of pink
and red butterfly flowers fluttering from the jowls of a grizzly cave. But
that doesn't mean there isn't a fun story. There is. Miguel and Tulio, best
buddies in light-hearted con set off for the riches of El Dorado - the city
of Gold! But greed, the mighty Cortes and his army, godly admiration of the
masses, and of course, a woman, challenge their friendship and purpose.</P>
<P>Most of the chatter between Miguel and Tulio (Kevin Kline and Kenneth
Branagh) is clever and charming (on an adult level), although the picture
relies upon it just a little too long leaving a lull or two for us to endure
between action sequences. At the same time, Cortes' mighty army, along with
Rosie Perez as the Eldoradan love interest are underused, leaving the
picture less 3-dimensional than it could have been. In fact, Rosie's sparse
dialogue would barely rival this paragraph in length. Having Rosie in a film
and not giving her a fiery speech of at least 30 seconds in length would be
like forcing Jennifer Lopez to wear a bra.</P>
<P>But I still liked this film! The action scenes charge and roll like bulls
through the streets of Pamplona. Kline and Branagh are more often charming
than not while the paint and pixels DreamWorks set swirling on the screen
effectively whirl excitement both aesthetically and physically inside their
viewers. The film's vivid wonder and wholesome story are sure to leave an
impression.</P>
<P>Despite its title, this isn't a "road" picture, but I suppose "Waterways to
El Dorado" didn't quite chime. Enjoy.</P>
