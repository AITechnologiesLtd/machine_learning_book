<P>   In Warren Beatty's far superior (if obviously more
commercial) picture "Bulworth," the title character ends up
with a philosophy about race relations in America.  To
paraphrase Bulworth's view without the vulgarity, "If blacks
and whites would just get together and make babies, one with
the other, the race problem could be solved in a generation
or two."  "Bulworth" was permeated with a rap score just like
James Toback's decidedly indie film "Black and White," but
Toback's somewhat improvised and disappointingly edited
commentary on race relations is so pretentious and
convoluted that the viewer could not be blamed for thinking
that his principal motive in making it was simply to get down
with the 'hood.  Featuring an impressive cast including Elijah
Wood, Mike Tyson, Ben Stiller, Brooke Shields, Jared Leto,
Robert Downey Jr. and supermodel Claudia Schiffer, "Black
and White" wastes them one and all with dialogue that
pushes for comedic and sometimes poignant effect, but the
director's reach far exceeds his grasp.  </P>
<P>   Toback appears to believe that racial relations are not
going to be solved Bulworth style but that there may be hope
for relief from prejudice and hatred in the way the current
generation of young people are erasing geographical, sexual
and racial boundaries.  In this belief he appears to amend
New York Times political writer Thomas Friedman's view that
even national boundaries themselves are swiftly being
ignored in an increasingly globalized world.  Yet there are
indications even within the film that what the young white
people are doing is nothing more than a phase, and that the
more prescient among them know that they're just kids who
will inevitably shuck off their fascination with hip hop and with
their emulation of black dress, walk and talk.</P>
<P>   Featured at the 1999 Toronto Film Festival where as least
some in audience considered "Black and White" one of the
pleasant surprises, the movie is an ensemble piece in the
Robert Altman tradition but without much of that great
director's talent in evidence.  Opening with an attention-
getter--an interracial threesome getting it on in the park (with
the women kissing each other while caressing a black male)--
the film shifts hither and thither to embrace various scenarios. 
One such scenario recalls August Wilson's play that takes
place during the 1920s, "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom," except
that in this case the white record producer is not interested in
exploiting a black group's talents but rather in questioning
whether he should deal at all with a guy who has a criminal
background.  Rich Bower (Power) enjoys the central role if,
indeed, there is a hub, as a gangster who is trying to make
an honest go of things via his talents with rap.  But when a
white dude sets up a night club on his uptown turf, he gets
mean (if not lean) and demands seventy percent of the take--
a command that he and his group back up with guns.  </P>
<P>   Robert Downey Jr. appears as Terry, a bisexual who is
married to a woman who wears the family pants, Sam
(Brooks Shields).  While Sam gets brashly into people's faces
filming a documentary about the convergence of black and
white culture among the young, Terry comes on to several
males--including Mike Tyson, who plays himself--in displays
that are meant to be hysterical but which are obvious and fall
flat.  The only absorbing action in the 100-minute movie--
which pushes fiction about as far as it will go before it
crosses the border into documentary--involves a police
detective (Ben Stiller) who was once a gangster but who
seeks redemption behind a badge and even a new name. 
Trapping a star basketball player, Dean (Allan Houston of the
New York Knicks) into accepting a bribe with the aim of using
him to get the goods on gang boss Rich Bower, he finds that
his action leads not to his redemption but to the murder of a
young man he had grown to like.</P>
<P>   Teachers in the audience may envy the role of Casey
(Jared Leto, who looks dashing in his platinum blond hair and
black sweater), as he instructs a highly articulate class in
what appears to be a great learning experience but is, in fact
nothing more than the standard sort of rap session that
passes for education in some of New York secondary
schools.  All in all the film--which in a brief time tries to
embrace sexuality, experimentation with identity, and humor--
succeeds in none of the above thanks to limp direction and a
script that's as mushy as a scoop of overcooked grits.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 100 minutes.  (C) 2000
