                       A film review by John Schuurman
                        Copyright 1997 John Schuurman</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Scott Hicks. Written by Jan Sardi. 
PG-13</PRE>
<P>This movie is about fathers and sons and the pain we pass along as the
generations go by. The film is based on the true story of Australian
pianist David Helfgott (Geoffrey Rush). In it we never actually meet
Helfgott's father's father. All we see is his severe portrait on the
wall (a portrait that is virtually a character in the film judging by
the furtive way the camera and the characters give it worried glances).
And all we hear is the one story about him -- told several times. The
story is told as a ritual exchange between David and his father, Peter
Helfgott. Peter (Armin Mueller-Stahl) tells the story. It seems that he
loved music as a boy. He saved and saved his money and bought a
wonderful violin. He asks his son: "But what happened to my violin?" </P>
<P>David's ritual answer, "The father smashed it."  </P>
<P>"You are a very lucky boy, David. A very lucky boy. Say it."</P>
<PRE>"I am a very lucky boy."</PRE>
<P>Presumably, this exchange is to impress David with how much different
(and better) his father is than his grandfather was. But we don't
believe it. This is the sins of the father visited upon the children to
the next generations. This is just smashing of another sort. </P>
<P>The defining moment in this exquisitely painful and hopeful movie is
when this story ritual is broken by David. He refuses to furnish the
expected answer -- instead he turns away, the father slumps off -- and
the cruel cycle is stopped. </P>
<P>This is how it happens: David (played beautifully by Alex Rafalowicz as
the boy and by  Noah Taylor as the teenager), the son of Peter
Helfgott, the son of his father Helfgott, possesses a prodigious gift
for playing the piano. But he is also possessed by his father and is as
smashed by the father's monstrous love as was the storied violin. </P>
<P>Peter is a Polish-Jew who survived but lost all of his family in the
concentration camps of the Holocaust. Both a child of that dark night
and of his father, Peter is now driven by the demons of fear and pride
and sorrow.</P>
<P>The universal cry of survivors of the Holocaust is "Never Again!" Peter
Helfgott lives out that wail in an oppressive and feverish attempt to
never again lose his family. And yet, pride and anger drive him to try
to conquer the very world to which he fears losing them. He rants, he
bellows, he loves far too deeply. He hugs and he beats his son with the
same sad but ferocious ineptitude. He at once drives the young David to
"Win, you must always win, David," and at the same time when
opportunities come for the boy to study abroad in the great music
schools, he denies his permission and blessing. Finally, when David
determines to go despite Peter's threats of eternal punishment, he
disowns David and bans him from any further contact with the family.</P>
<P>And all the while David is going quite mad. He goes to the Royal
College of Music on scholarship where his genius further emerges under
the care of his tutor, played joyously by the ninety-two year old Lord
John Gielgud. While at the Royal College he takes on the riotous "Rach
3", Rachmaninoff's Third Concerto for Piano in D minor. That massive
piece proves his glory and his undoing. He collapses and breaks down
while in performance of it. </P>
<P>When we see him as an adult. He is back in Australia, his speech is
full of chattering non-sequiturs, his behavior is bizarre but disarming
(if you don't have to clean house after him), and though quite
harmless, he has been institutionalized for years (no family). </P>
<P>It is only after twenty or more years of estrangement that his father
Peter enters his life one last time. He again tries to exert the old
control, again the suffocating embrace, and again the story of the
violin. "You are a very lucky boy, David. Do you know what happened to
my violin?"</P>
<P>Averted eyes. Silence. And a turn away. And only then David can begin
anew. Still crazy, but with some understanding women, able to put
together a life. </P>
<P>David chatters throughout the film about his "ridiculous tragedy." </P>
<P>I guess it is both ridiculous and a tragedy. But it is a very old one
-- and dug in very deep. It is one that makes me tremble. The sins of
the fathers handed down. Fathers to sons. Fathers to sons. How to stop
the cycle? What can arrest the methodical twists of this history? Can
we really change? </P>
<P>David's surname "Helfgott" means, "With the help of God." David calls
it a ridiculous name. It seems to me it is our only hope.</P>
