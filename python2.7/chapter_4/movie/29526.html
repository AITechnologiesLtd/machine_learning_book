<P>Here's the set-up. The comfortable suburban life of Ruby Baker (Leelee 
Sobieski) and her kid brother Rhett (Trevor Morgan) is destroyed when 
their parents die in a car crash while celebrating their 20th 
anniversary. Soon after, per the terms of a trust, the kids are sent to 
live with their folks' well-to-do friends Erin Glass (Diane Lane) and 
her husband Terry (Stellan Skarsgard) in a striking glass home on the 
Malibu shores. </P>
<P>At first, everything seems peachy. The Glasses purchase suitably hip 
clothes for Ruby and two, count 'em, two videogame systems for Rhett. Oh 
sure, they make the teens share one bedroom, but they assure them that 
it is a temporary measure. Then the estate lawyer (Bruce Dern) informs 
Ruby and Rhett that they are collectively worth $4 million. </P>
<P>Soon, Ruby begins to notice things. Terry and Erin fight a lot. 
Overheard conversations indicate that Terry may be in debt to some very 
nasty men. Erin periodically gets a glassy-eyed stare and her medicine 
cabinet looks like the controlled substances shelf at Walgreens. Terry 
drives like a lunatic and has a tendency to lean in close to Ruby, far 
too close. Could it be that the kids' new guardians are not as pure as 
they appeared to be? </P>
<P>Well, of course. "The Glass House" is a thriller aimed at teens and, for 
a while, it looks like it just might work. Once Ruby realizes that there 
is trouble in Pepperland, a nice cat and mouse game develops between her 
and the Glasses. But the story degenerates steadily and finally becomes 
just another horror show with a psycho chasing adolescents. Such a 
shame. </P>
<P>Having Leelee Sobieski (I still think of her as Helen Hunt Jr.) face off 
against Stellan Skarsgard is a great idea. She is one of the smartest 
young actors working today and he comes off as both intelligent and 
scary even when cast in a sympathetic part. But what's the point of 
shipping the brother and the wife to separate parts of the house for 
much of the film, with the boy plugged into videogame nirvana and the 
wife in a chemical one? </P>
<P>Further, why in the world did the Glasses make two teenagers share one 
bedroom in the first place? Con artists with a plan as elaborate as the 
one concocted by this pair would surely know that the importance of 
keeping up appearances. And Terry Glass would certainly make a better 
attempt at suppressing his dirty old man impulses. </P>
<P>Ah well, another week in 2001, another new release that starts off 
strong, then goes straight down the drain. What a lousy year. </P>
