<PRE>KNOCK OFF (M).
(Tristar/Village Roadshow)
Director: Tsui Hark
Stars: Jean Claude Van Damme, Rob Schneider, Lela Rochon, Paul Sorvino
Running time: 90 minutes.</PRE>
<P>Like the recent Chinese Box, most of the action in Knock Off
takes place against the background of the hand-over of Hong Kong to
China after a century of British rule.  However, the lack of immediacy
here doesn't seem to matter too much with this tired, unconvincing and
rudimentary plot.  Rather than a poignant love story set against a
backdrop of the clash between cultures, Knock Offis a mindless and
unconvincing B-grade spy thriller that offers fading action star Jean
Claude Van Damme one final opportunity to salvage his career from the
scrap heap.</P>
<P>Van Damme's status as an action hero reached its pinnacle with
Time Copand the Die Hardclone Sudden Death.  Since then it's been
largely downhill, with a series of increasingly dull, mindless and
gratuitously violent action films.  The muscles from Brussels has
placed his career in the hands of a number of influential Hong Kong
action directors (John Woo, Ringo Lam, and Tsui Hark, but they have
been unable to reverse his declining box office fortunes.</P>
<P>In Knock Off, Van Damme plays Marcus Ray, an exporter and
wholesaler for an American jeans company, based in Hong Kong.  He and
his partner Tommy (Rob Schneider, from Judge Dredd, etc) accidentally
find themselves mixed up in a terrorist scheme to smuggle small but
very lethal bombs into the US.  Sinister forces are planting the
bombs, which burst into green flame, inside toys, clothes and other
consumer goods and shipping them to America.  Ray finds himself up
against the CIA, the Triads and the Hong Kong police as he tries to
unravel the complicated international plot.</P>
<P>This below par effort has been written by Steven E De Souza,
who has previously written some of Hollywood's best action thrillers
of the past decade - Die Hard, and Die Hard 2, etc.  There's plenty of
action scenes, but the film is undermined by Tsui Hark's cold,
clinical choreography and visual flourishes.  Hark, who previously
directed our hero in the ludicrous Double Team, brings his own
distinctive style to the film.  He uses close-ups, a constantly moving
camera, and lots of unusual angles to bring an illusion of kinetic
energy to the material.  Unfortunately, his unnecessarily flamboyant
visual style somehow removes any genuine sense of excitement and
suspense.</P>
<P>Van Damme's performance is more wooden and unconvincing than
ever, and he seems uncomfortable with the more comic elements of the
script.  Even Schneider's desperate attempts to breathe some humour
into proceedings with a series of throw away one liners fall flat.</P>
<P>Knock Offis a disappointing and muddled actioner that marks a
new low in Van Damme's declining career.  At this rate, Van Damme will
join the ranks of those other faded action stars whose films now
regularly disappear straight on to video (Dolph Lundgren, Rutger
Hauer, etc).</P>
