<PRE>THE SIXTH SENSE</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Brian Takeshita</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  *** out of ****</PRE>
<P>Imagine you are a little kid who could see ghosts.  These ghosts
torment you day and night, some merely frightening you, others causing
real bodily injury.  You need help, and who do you want to come to
your rescue?  Why, Bruce Willis, of course.</P>
<P>Willis plays Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist who just received a
certificate from the city of Philadelphia for his work.  However, not
everyone shares the city's benevolent view.  One of his former
patients, now grown up, breaks into Crowe's house, berates him for not
being able to save him from his problems so many years ago, and
proceeds to shoot Crowe, then himself.  One year later, Crowe is a
shadow of his former self, with a flagging marriage and a washed-up
career.  However, his next assignment is to help young Cole Sear
(Haley Joel Osment), a boy with problems very similar to his failed
patient.  If Crowe can help little Cole, perhaps he may gain
redemption for his earlier mistake.</P>
<P>M. Night Shyamalan's THE SIXTH SENSE starts out on the wrong foot.
Crowe and his wife (Olivia Williams) have just gotten home from the
awards ceremony and are admiring the certificate's frame.  His wife
hugs him, looks into his eyes, and then spouts some of the most
expository dialog I've heard in a long time.  I'm paraphrasing, but
it's something like, "You're a successful child psychologist who has
pioneered revolutionary techniques in helping children overcome their
hidden problems."   Whoa, why don't we just have a STAR WARS-like
title crawl to fill us in on all the details?  Or how about a freeze
frame of Crowe, with his description subtitled underneath?  It'd be
kind of like what they used to do in those Road Runner cartoons:
Malcolm Crowe (Genius Childus Helperus).  The one saving grace about
this scene is it doesn't last very long, since Crowe's old patient
shows up and soon puts us out of our misery.</P>
<P>After the shooting and a jump ahead to the following year, it would
seem that the film's pace is doggedly slow, taking nearly 40 minutes
to get into gear.  Out of courtesy to the filmmakers, however, I blame
this on the movie's marketing.  Every trailer and commercial shows us
Cole saying, "I see dead people," and pumps us up for some kind of
horror extravaganza, when in reality, it's not until well into the
film that Cole confesses his unique ability.  All the build-up and
precursors would have been effective if we did not know this fact, but
as it is, we're just waiting around for over a half an hour, saying to
ourselves, "All right, where's the dead people?  I wanna see walking
corpses, dammit!"  Okay, maybe I'm overstating it a bit, but you get
the picture.</P>
<P>Luckily, once we start seeing Cole's apparitions, the film picks up a
lot of steam and we're taken along for the ride as Crowe must decide
whether or not this otherworldly manifestation is merely a product of
Cole's imagination, and how he can help the child in any case.  This
is not to say THE SIXTH SENSE turns into an effects-laden tour de
force, however.  Instead, our glimpses of the ghosts are separate and
isolated, satisfying our curiosity and giving us the occasional scare
while not turning the film into just another one of those horror
flicks the industry has been churning out so furiously.  It is simply
evident that writer/director Shyamalan has a good sense of pacing, not
allowing us to be overwhelmed with sensory overload.  Happily for us,
he puts the human story in the forefront, rather than relegating it to
the wings as computer generated images take center stage.</P>
<P>When the scares do come, they are wonderfully effective.  Some of them
catch you totally off guard, while in other cases they are the climax
to painfully suspenseful sequences.  It's nice to know that the art of
frightening is alive and well outside of the slasher movie, and you
don't have to rely on guts, blood, gore, or special effects to still
scare the heck out of an audience.  This film will do quite fine
without them, thank you very much.  Especially in a season where we've
had films like THE HAUNTING, which was 100% effects and constant
scares, and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, which was a zero effects
production with a film's length of build-up to a two minute payoff,
it's refreshing to see a film that makes a compromise between the two
extremes and does so with proficiency.</P>
<P>Bruce Willis once again shows us that he's not to be lumped into the
same category of those image-only action heroes.  When called for,
this guy can really act.  He takes it a bit over the top at a couple
of points, but for the most part he does a fine job garnering our
sympathy for his character.  Toni Collette as Cole's mother, Lynn,
also deserves recognition.  Lynn truly loves her son, but must cope
with a problem she does not understand.  Piling on the pressure is the
fact that her husband ran out on her years ago, and she must hold two
jobs in order to pay rent and send Cole to a private school.  Taking
on this role, Collette performs admirably and perhaps only once allows
her Australian accent to slip in.  However, the real surprise in this
film is young Haley Joel Osment.  This kid performs with a level of
experience beyond his years, able to convey the genuine fear he
experiences on a daily basis as well as the suspicious apprehension he
feels toward Crowe.  By movie's end, this young actor has run the
gamut of emotions, all of which are completely convincing.</P>
<P>To be sure, THE SIXTH SENSE has its share of loose ends, but the
overall film is still quite solid.  Along with the suspense and
scares, you also get some really touching moments and even a bit of
humor.  I won't give away a whole lot, but something happens at the
end that will even make you look back on the whole film.  And when a
movie leaves me thinking about it after I've left the theater, that
scores points in my book.</P>
