A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Deepa Mehta</PRE>
<P>Written by: Deepa Mehta, based on the book CRACKING INDIA by Bapsi Sidhwa</P>
<P>Starring: Maaia Sethna, Nandita Das, Aamir Khan, Rahul Khanna</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
EARTH is a coming of age story and a love story set in 1947, in India, just
as the British colonialists are about to pull out and divide the greater
territory of India into mostly Muslim Pakistan and mostly Hindu India. The
story is seen through the eyes of Lenny (Maaia Sethna), a pampered, 8-year
old rich girl who initially has no idea what is happening. Lenny follows
around her beautiful nanny Shanta (Nandita Das), who is being wooed by a
group of male friends and suitors of differing religions and ethnicities,
since their city is initially a multicultural mosaic of Hindus, Muslims,
Parsees, and Sikhs. </P>
<P>The upcoming partition of the territory gives rise to a creeping ethnic
tension, and soon the good-natured ribbing of the past gives way to
overpowering forces of chaos and strife. Through it all, Lenny sticks by
Shanta, who comes to symbolize colonial India itself: torn by competing
lovers and visions, lusted after by good men and evil men alike. </P>
<P>Opinion:
You've seen epic-type love stories: LAST OF THE MOHICANS; TITANIC; WEST
SIDE STORY; et cetera. EARTH is one of the better ones. On the minus side,
the deliberate plate-breaking scene seems a little precocious for an
8-year-old kid (to be metaphorically pondering separatist movements), and
maybe 10 minutes of extra scenery can be edited. But there are a heck of a
lot more positives. </P>
<P>Canadian/Indian director Deepa Mehta does a brilliant job resurrecting the
look and the inflamed passions of 1947. EARTH is visually spectacular and
haunting, with good music, scenery and acting. Its themes of true love,
chaos, and racial strife resonate as strongly today in 1999 as they do in
the movie setting of 50 years ago. EARTH the kind of movie you see, think
about, and see again, because it's an excellent love story and because
there are no easy answers.</P>
<P>One theme of EARTH is the idea of multiculturalism as a personal, moral
decision. As an example, these days it's considered okay to encourage
people to prepare for high tech culture: i.e. to study English, math, and
computers, and get rewarded with big money scholarships and high-paying
jobs. There are people who prefer alternate culture in the form of low tech
lifestyles and hobbies, but it's unethical to persecute them. We no longer
stomp to their doors carrying torches and hatchets, to hustle them to
draconian internment camps and relocation centers, imprison their leaders
for "reeducation," torture their spokesmen, rape their women, burn or
confiscate their homes, or declare them enemies of national unity until
they conform to high tech culture. 1947 or 1999, no matter what country we
live in or how it is partitioned, we all have a moral choice whether to
live together and actively encourage common culture and standards yet
tolerate multiculture (majority rule, minority rights); or, on the other
hand, to create a common culture through the ruthless and deliberate
extermination of rival culture on our turf, i.e. through ethnic cleansing,
genocide, intimidation, and repression. </P>
<P>Does passionate, individual true love conquer all, or do big, epic forces
get in the way? See the movie. Then get the video and watch it back to back
with SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. Powerful film, recalling a powerful and relevant
era enable us to openly discuss human nature and hopefully avoid repeating
mistakes of the past.</P>
