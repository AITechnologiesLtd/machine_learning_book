Susan Granger's review of "X-MEN" (20th Century Fox)</PRE>
<P> Based on the best-selling comic books, this live-action
allegory about persecution and tolerance revolves around an awesome
team of black leather-clad mutants who become reluctant
superheroes. For the X-uninitiated, wheelchair-bound Prof. Charles
Xavier (Patrick Stewart) is the world's greatest telepath who runs a
secret school where gifted youngsters are taught by Storm (Halle
Berry), Cyclops (James Marsden) and Jean Grey (Famke
Janssen). Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Rogue (Anna Paquin) are the
newcomers. The adversarial evil Brotherhood - Sabretooth (Tyler Mane),
Mystique (Rebecca Romjin-Stamos), Toad (Ray Park) - is led by the
strongest and most powerful mutant ever known, Magneto (Ian McKellen),
who captures a conservative U.S. Senator (Bruce Davison) in his
determination to get respect by whatever means necessary. Director
Bryan Singer ("The Usual Suspects," "Apt Pupil") enjoys dark character
studies, keeping the comic-book action taut. And he's obviously been
influenced by "Matrix" effects.  The Cerebro, a chamber in which
Xavier's psychic abilities are enhanced, is fascinating, as is
Magneto's Lair and the Map Room, where a six-foot diameter table made
of steel pins rises to form a 3-D topographical map of New York
City. The Rogue Effect, which drains a person's life-force, is
impressive and there's an incredible, high-energy, destructive
sequence at the Statue of Liberty. With her scaly blue skin and red
hair, Mystique is eye-candy as a shape-shifter, transforming herself,
including fingerprints and voice, into anyone with whom she comes in
contact. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "X-Men" is a cool,
mythic 7. Die-hard Marvel Comic fanatics may quibble with these movie
mutants but fans are out there and they will come.</P>
