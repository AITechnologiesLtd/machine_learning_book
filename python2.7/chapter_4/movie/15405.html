<P>Actor turned writer/director Peter Berg says his mantra during the making 
of "Very Bad Things" was "Death before boredom." It shows. Extremely 
gruesome and packed with violence, "Very Bad Things" is most certainly 
not boring. The film has a relentless forward thrust, an energy that 
keeps the proceedings as involving as they are bloody, until it runs out 
of gas near the end. The film has too much of a conscience to fully 
succeed as a black comedy and is too farcical to fully succeed as a 
straightforward horror film, but damn if it isn't perversely entertaining 
most of the way along. </P>
<P>The Tarantino-influenced black comedy, about a bachelor party gone 
horribly wrong, desperately wants to be a boy's club version of "Heathers,
" but doesn't know how to get there. Berg hops all over the place, from 
humorous nihilism to blunt-edged social commentary. His finished product 
plays essentially as a messy curiosity, albeit a fascinating one. </P>
<P>It begins with a trip to Las Vegas. Kyle Fisher (Jon Favreau) is days 
away from marrying Laura (Cameron Diaz), a young woman obsessed with 
creating the perfect wedding ceremony. Determined to satisfy his fiancée, 
he continues working on wedding arrangements by car phone, even as his 
buddies urge him to relax and enjoy the ride to Las Vegas for his 
bachelor party. </P>
<P>Kyle's pal Robert (Christian Slater), a real estate agent and 
motivational book zealot, has assembled everything necessary for a night 
of gambling and debauchery; from liquor and cocaine to a beautiful hooker.
 Joining in the revelry is family-man Adam (Daniel Stern), his tightly-
wound brother, Michael (Jeremy Piven), and Charles (Leland Orser), an 
introspective cipher. </P>
<P>Things go swimmingly until Michael, during an over-enthusiastic session 
of stand-up sex, accidentally impales the prostitute on a bathroom coat 
hook. The shaken men debate what to do, with Robert arguing for a quick 
disposal of the body in the desert. He dismisses all legal and moral 
issues, coolly stating "this is just a 105 pound problem that has to be 
moved from point A to point B." With strong reservations, the others 
agreed to the plan, only to have matters further complicated when a 
security guard arrives and spots the corpse. Ever the problem-solver, 
Robert uses a corkscrew on the guard, removing the witness and doubling 
the body count. </P>
<P>The rest of the story follows the men on their damage control mission, 
with as many plot twists and turns as the aforementioned corkscrew. Each 
man reacts to the group decision in different ways, ranging from crushing 
guilt to gallows humor. Meanwhile, Laura continues her steamroller 
preparations for a wedding that will happen, no matter what.</P>
<P>With an actor at the helm, it's not surprising that the impressive cast 
of "Very Bad Things" is given considerable room to stretch. Christian 
Slater and Cameron Diaz have the juiciest parts, with Slater entertaining 
as a character who is essentially an older version of the sociopath he 
played in "Heathers." Diaz is a hoot as the marriage-at-all-costs bride 
to be. Her steely determination reminded me of Debbie Reynolds' ceremony-
fixated character from "In and Out," only much more ruthless.</P>
<P>Jeremy Piven is excellent as Michael, imbuing him with a great manic 
energy. The character is an explosion waiting to happen and Piven, known 
for his intense portrayals, perfectly captures Michael's hair-trigger 
emotions. Daniel Stern is less successful as Michael's brother, Adam, 
delivering a performance as a borderline hysteric that rarely varies in 
tone (incidentally, with all due respect to the intricacies of genetic 
coding, there is no way in hell those two guys could be brothers). As 
Charles, the sketchiest of the men, Leland Orser projects a jittery 
quality that keeps his character interesting. </P>
<P>Which brings us to the groom. Jon Favreau, who scored a hat trick with 
"Swingers," is an extremely appealing actor, but oddly bland here. Kyle 
would have been more effective had Favreau cut back on the mealy-mouth 
squishiness and given the guy a little more oomph. Of course, all of the 
actors faced a challenge with their roles. After all, how do you play 
characters who are supposed to be tragic, despicable and funny all at the 
same time?</P>
<P>There are some big laughs in "Very Bad Things," although not as many as 
there could have been. Berg can't decide whether he's making a full-out 
tasteless farce or a noirish horror story involving real feelings, and 
refuses to commit to either. The potential impact is muted by the film's 
constant shifts in tone. One moment we're watching a character break down 
in heartfelt grief and shame over his actions, the next moment we're 
listening to one-liners about dismembered bodies. Berg punches so many 
contrasting emotional buttons that the whole system finally short 
circuits. The film's closing shot, intended to either provoke reflection 
or provide one last sick laugh, drew no response whatsoever from me. By 
that point, I just wanted to go home. </P>
