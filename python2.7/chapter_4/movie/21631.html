<P>Susan Granger's review of "THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH" (MGM/UA)</P>
<P>When you go to a James Bond film, you're looking for escapist
fantasy - and that's what you get in this 19th installment in the
long-running, most successful film franchise in cinema
history. Directed by Michael Apted, the adventure begins with a
sensational, action-packed opening sequence in Bilbao, Spain, where
Bond (Pierce Brosnan) is attacked by a sexy sniper, setting the plot
into motion. Bond's mission, this time, is to find the notorious
international terrorist (Robert Carlyle) responsible for the death of
a British oil tycoon in an explosion in M16 headquarters. This
formidable villain has a bullet lodged in his brain, rendering him
unable to feel pain. To track him down, Bond is assigned as a
bodyguard for the tycoon's beautiful daughter, Elektra (Sophie
Marceau), who is building an oil pipeline through some of the most
dangerous territory on the globe. And his only ally in remote
Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea is a nuclear weapons expert,
Dr. Christmas Jones (Denise Richards), whose name leads to one of the
funniest last lines of a movie in years. Suave Pierce Brosnan embodies
007, delving into the emotional depth of his relationships, and Denise
Richards is amusingly absurd as a scantily clad rocket
scientist. Desmond Llewelyn returns as Q, with amazing high-tech
gadgets, including a speed-boat and BMW, and John Cleese is introduced
as R, his inept assistant. Judi Dench is back as M with Samantha Bond
as Moneypenny. "Orbis non sufficit," Latin for "The world is not
enough," is the Bond family motto (On Her Majesty's Secret Service,
1969). For James Bond fans, on the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, The
World Is Not Enough is a spectacular, fun-filled 10, packed with all
the excitement you expect - and more.  It's a jaw-dropper, so buckle
up for a wild ride!</P>
