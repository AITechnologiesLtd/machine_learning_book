<P>     The story told in SPEECHLESS is not unlike the one played out
during the real life 1992 Presidential campaign when the romance
between James Carville (Democrat) and Mary Matalin (Republican) crossed
party lines.  Those who saw THE WAR ROOM or any of the news shows
documenting the relationship will doubtless find something familiar in
this Michael Keaton/Geena Davis coupling (although, to be fair,
SPEECHLESS was written while Ronald Reagan was still in the Oval
Office).  Nevertheless, an unwelcome ingredient has been added to this
fictional account of rival political speech writers falling in love:
hogwash.</P>
<P>     SPEECHLESS is overplotted and underwritten.  Every situation is
straight out of stock, with no room for variation or originality.  The
two leads--Kevin Vallick (Keaton) and Julia Mann (Davis)--meet, are
attracted to each other, find out they're on opposite sides of the New
Mexico senatorial campaign, spend half the movie sparring with each
other, then eventually get together.  It's the "Taming of the Shrew"
romantic comedy formula.  Opposites, after all, are supposed to
attract.</P>
<P>     Alas, too much of SPEECHLESS feels hopelessly forced.  The
dialogue isn't memorable, the verbal jabs are mostly bland, and the
romance is only sporadically engaging.  You probably have to go back to
1992's THE CUTTING EDGE to find a recent mainstream romantic comedy
with the same basic plot structure.  That film, however, possessed a
certain amount of style and subtlety.  SPEECHLESS' approach is more of
the sledgehammer variety.</P>
<P>     As with this past summer's Nick Nolte/Julia Roberts flick NOTHING
BUT TROUBLE, perhaps part of the problem is that SPEECHLESS spends too
much time concentrating on other things (politics) when it should be
exploring the characters' relationship.  No one really cares which
candidate wins the race--that particular plot element should have been
permanently relegated to the background.  The only worthwhile scenes
are the cute ones involving Kevin and Julia arguing or making up.</P>
<P>     In any romantic comedy, the individual performances are far less
important than how the leads work as a team.  Keaton and Davis have
enough chemistry to generate a few sparks, but they're a pale shadow
of, say, a Tracy and Hepburn.  Bonnie Bedelia and Christopher Reeve are
along for the ride to provide relationship complications, and both are
woefully underused.  As for Ernie Hudson... why bother getting a
familiar name for that thankless part?</P>
<P>     Ultimately, most problems in SPEECHLESS come back to the script,
which, in addition to displaying a remarkable unwillingness to vary the
familiar, has a major believability problem.  The "grand" climax, while
vintage Hollywood, is so silly that it's more likely to cause snickers
of laughter than sighs of longing.  For SPEECHLESS, if suspension of
disbelief was a rubber band, it would have snapped long before the
closing credits.</P>
