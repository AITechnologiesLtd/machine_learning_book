                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Well, Cronenberg is back, and after a couple of misfires like
CRASH, M. BUTTERFLY, and well, pretty much the last ten years of his
oeuvre, he's got a solid flick with EXISTENZ.  In fact, I'd say it's his
best work since 1983's VIDEODROME.</P>
<P>     The story is straight outta modern/near-future pop culture: Using a
"bioport," you can jack your body and mind into an immersive game
world--a world served up by a handheld bio-engineered creature called a
"game pod" that is essentially a blood-pulsing Nintendo.  There are no
computers in the film: just the mutated organisms that are Cronenberg's
trademark.  And oh does he put them to good use.</P>
<P>     Leigh is Allegra, not an allergy medication, but rather the
designer of the hottest games on the planet. And eXistenZ stands to be
her masterpiece.  The object of the game-as is the case with all games
that become the centerpiece of movies--is to learn the object of the
game.  And in this instance, it turns out that some anti-game "Realists"
are on Allegra's tail, so she has to head inside eXistenZ to ensure
everything's kosher, with helpful Jude Law as a sidekick.</P>
<P>     Or so we are led to believe.  EXISTENZ the movie quickly becomes a
game within a game within a game within etc....  Not only are we unsure
of what's real and what isn't, neither are the characters. 
Unfortunately, this conceit kinda gives away the whole film, making it
overly simplistic and cliched for what I'd expect from Cronenberg. 
Frankly, THE MATRIX did it better.</P>
<P>     Still, EXISTENZ is a good ride.  But eat before you come.  The
meals on display here are for presentation only.</P>
