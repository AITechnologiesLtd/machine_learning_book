<P>Mike Barker's "Best Laid Plans" is an example of effective film
noir. A dark subject matter, plenty of moral dilemmas, good dialogue,
and stylish direction which makes for an entertaining, twisty
90-minute diversion.</P>
<P>Two buddies, Nick(Alessandro Nivola), who works at a recycling plant,
and Bryce(Josh Brolin), a high-school teacher, are meeting for a few
drinks at a local bar in Tropico(a small town in an unnamed state that
looks like Nevada). Nick has been living in Tropico his entire life,
and is depending on the inheritance which he will now receive, since
his father has just died. Bryce is fortunate enough to be
house-sitting for a wealthy family, and is looking forward to a bright
future.</P>
<P>All that is changed when Nick gets a phone call from Bryce after
midnight, asking him to come over to discuss a huge problem. A
woman(Reese Witherspoon) whom he met at the bar, and then had sex
with, accused him of rape. She also happens to be downstairs, tied up
in rope and handcuffed.  Bryce seems to be hazy about what exactly
happened, but he knows that a rape charge would ruin his career and
perhaps send him to prison.</P>
<P>Ted Griffin's script then flashes back three months, and although I am
tempted to let you in on some of the twists that occur after the
initial setup, I'm doing you a favor by letting you witness them on
your own. However, if you aren't paying attention to certain moments,
then some plot complications will fly over your head. It's called
challenging cinema.</P>
<P>"Best Laid Plans" won't grab you in the way that "The Usual Suspects"
does, but it is a fine homage to the way film noir used to be made;
with multilayered characters, strong-willed women, and people who
pretend to be something that they're not. "Best Laid Plans" is
sometimes rough-around-the-edges, but being Mike Barker's first
American film, it is quite an achievement.</P>
<P>Alessandro Nivola(Pollux Troy in "Face/Off") makes quite an impression
as the good-natured guy who gets corrupted by money, and Reese "Is
There Anyone Better" Witherspoon once again displays sheer talent in
her role of the girl who displays her love through the things she'll
do for her lover.</P>
<P>The look of "Best Laid Plans" reminds me of Paul Thomas Anderson's
"Hard Eight", and Danny Cannon's "Phoenix", and the tone of these
films is also similar. It's nice to see a well-made character-driven
suspense-thriller, especially when it has a cast of young
people. Nothing much goes awry in these "Best Laid Plans".</P>
