GODZILLA     1998
Reviewed by Pierce Dalton
2 stars (out of 4)</PRE>
<P> The new motion picture experience about Godzilla is as flat as the city of
Tokyo after Godzilla rampaged through it in 1958.</P>
<P> A big budget, under written, overly hyped piece of boredom, Godzilla was
written and directed by the same team as 1996's Independence Day.</P>
<P> Now ID4 was not great movie.  It wasn't even a good one.  But, it did have a
sense of awe and wonder, not found in Godzilla.</P>
<P> The story, if I can remember the crucial parts, is about the creation of a
giant lizard mutated after years of radiation near a nuclear power plant.  The
lizard grows, leaves its footprints in the ground at various villages (which is
the best scene of the film), and swims its way to New York City.</P>
<P> I really don't have to say what happens next.  All I can do is ask questions. 
(a) Why did Godzilla pick NYC out of all the Atlantc? (b) Can the beast really
swim thousands of miles within a couple of days? (c) Will this film sink the
careers of Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin?</P>
<P> That last question isn't that important to the film's view point.  But it is
important for the film's grounds.  ID4 was crap, but made a lot of money. 
Godzilla, only slightly worse, is crap, but dropped like a rock at the box
office last spring after a mediocre opening of $55 million.</P>
<P> Oh, I forgot the actors.  Matthew Broderick, Jean Reneo, Hank Azaria.  They
are all wasted.</P>
<P> The reason I give Godzilla two stars is because of its style.  The film is
much more visually spectacular than ID4 in the cinematography department, yet
ID4's special FX were better.  That may not make much sense, but, it does to
me.</P>
<P> This Godzilla needs to be put to sleep.</P>
