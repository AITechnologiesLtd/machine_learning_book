<PRE>Barry Lyndon (1975)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 93</PRE>
<P>Director Stanley Kubrick followed the success of "2001: A Space
Odyssey" and "A Clockwork Orange" with a film that was perhaps
even more daring.  "Barry Lyndon" was a three hour costume
drama set in the 18th century, without sufficient action
to interest male viewers, and without sufficient love interest
to satisfy women viewers.  The film starred expressionless
Ryan O'Neal, who had been derided since "Love Story" despite
a quality performance in "Paper Moon."  Meticulously filmed
entirely utilizing natural light, "Barry Lyndon" was beautiful
to look at, but was a flop at the box office.  Even some critics
weren't kind, calling the film tedious and lifeless; perhaps
more a series of still life paintings than a conventional film.</P>
<P>But "Barry Lyndon" is outstanding.  It is not as great as
"Dr. Strangelove", but it could be Kubrick's second best film.
Besides the gorgeous visual appeal of the cinematography and
costumes, the story is highly compelling, even with the narration
curiously revealing plot spoilers.  While the viewer never
likes the characters, one can identify with them, and what
happens to them seems as natural and inevitable as if preordained
by the stars.  Redmond Barry's ultimate failure, propelled by
hunger for respect and the title of Lord that he doesn't merit,
seems a fitting punishment for treating people as mere stepping
stones to glory.</P>
<P>Redmond Barry (O'Neal) is first seen as an idealistic,
courageous young Irishman.  Tricked into leaving home by
relations anxious to be rid of the meddlesome youth,
he enlists in first the English, then the Prussian
Army.  His courage survives better than his morality,
and he eventually manipulates his way into a favorable
marriage with lovely, sad-eyed Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson).
He shamelessly dissipates the Lyndon family fortune in
attempt to buy the title of Lord, making an enemy of
his dislikable stepson (Leon Vitali).</P>
<P>While "Barry Lyndon" was nominated for 7 Academy Awards,
including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted
Screenplay (credited to Kubrick, based on William Makepeace
Thackeray's novel), the film only won for its most obvious
strengths.  John Alcott won Best Cinematography, Leonard
Rosenman for the low-key score, and the sets and costumes
(of course) won Oscars.</P>
