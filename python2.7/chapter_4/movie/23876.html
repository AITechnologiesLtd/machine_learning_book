<PRE>A Change of Heart
Return to Me</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>"It's a shame we gotta put roofs on 'em," architect, builder, handsome, rich
successful, eternally nice guy, David Duchovny utters the film's opening
line as he stands atop a partially constructed building. His sentence ends a
gentle, patiently tightening aerial shot from a blimp high above Chicago.</P>
<P>It's a sweet introduction, but here's a better one: close shot on Duchovny
donning a bloodstained white tuxedo standing disengaged and expressionless
as he peers through a hospital's emergency ward doors. Flashback: Duchovny
as teen on first date with future wife, first kiss, first marriage, wife at
her job with great ape at the zoo, at a zoo fund-raiser supporting wife's
projects, at night in the car afterwards - headlights jump the double yellow
and approach full speed. Back to present day: Duchovny gets the bad news as
a group of organ donor personnel jog past toting a full thermos. Roll
opening credits. Return to Duchovny, one year later, trying to re-start his
life while grieving the death of his wife.</P>
<P>That necessary background info could be filmed creatively in three minutes
(okay, maybe five). Instead, "Return to Me" spends what seems like 25
minutes just to establish Duchovny's love of his wife. This still isn't a
great sin, the problem is that it lacks life. Feeling more like a necessary
burden for the filmmakers than entertainment; moviegoers deserve better. If
we're going to spend a good fraction of the film on "prerequisite
information" it should at least be compelling. This one's tragically typical
littered with the trite, example: "There's my husband with Sidney the ape;
my husband's the one on the right." However, I quite enjoyed the conclusion
of this sequence (which ends visually as my suggestion begins); Duchovny,
bloodstained, peers blankly into surgery ward while soundtrack continues the
song "Return to Me" but minus the music, simply acappella. It's a chillingly
lonely affect.</P>
<P>The real story (which is quite interesting) starts when a sickly and dying
Minnie Driver receives David's dead wife's heart (via transplant - not the
US post) restoring her to health, much to the delight of her loving
grandfather Carol O'Connor. Driver is an excellent actress, Duchovny is also
charming with his subtle emotionalism, and director/actress/writer Bonnie
Hunt delivers a strong performance as Minnie's best friend. But it's
O'Connor's big heart and loving charisma that anchors the film (despite his
goofy Irish accent).</P>
<P>Mostly a love story (David soon enough meets Minnie), with comic relief,
(James Belushi is a lot of fun as beer-bellied, Joe Average, dad), the
picture also relies on suspense. What will happen when Minnie tells David
about her operation? Will they realize whose heart is where? If and when
they do, will it prompt a change of heart?</P>
<P>The family sequences are so warm and full, they'll leave you sure that these
writers have kids of their own. Aside from the pale intro sequence, the film
has heart and humor.</P>
