<P>     It seems like only a few weeks ago -- probably because it was -- that
I was inveighing against the slew of "fill-in-the-blank, but with
teenagers" movies.  Still they show no sign of abating, with a
shudder-inducing sub-category creeping to the forefront:  Shakespeare, but
with teenagers.  Leading the charge (which will include a version of
OTHELLO later this year) is 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU, the under-20 set's
"Taming of the Shrew."  By all rights it should have been as incredibly
heinous as other recent juvenile jaunts, but it's actually kinda cute on
occasion.  Though still too concerned with cozying up to its audience's
sensibilities, 10 THINGS at least offers a blueprint for how to make such
material a bit more appealing.</P>
<P>    The setting is modern-day Padua High School of Seattle, where a
cunning plan is about to unfold.  New student Cameron James (Joseph
Gordon-Levitt) has become infatuated with beautiful, popular Bianca
Stratford (Larisa Oleynik), but he's thwarted by more than clashing
cliques.  Bianca's overprotective father (Larry Miller) has forbidden her
from dating until older sister Kat (Julia Stiles) does likewise, and Kat
is known as an ill-tempered girl with no interest in ordinary teen
pursuits like dating.  Cameron comes up with the creative solution of
finding someone to woo Kat, someone like mysterious loner Patrick Verona
(Heath Ledger).  Naturally the hard-edged Kat proves a tough shrew to
tame, until both prospective lovers begin to let their guard down.</P>
<P>     10 THINGS gets a leg up on most of its genre cousins simply by
putting people on the screen who can act a lick.  Julia Stiles is a
charming, smart and fresh presence as Kat, giving here attitude a little
something more than _just_ attitude; Australian actor Heath Ledger makes
for a nice foil with his combination of hulking presence and sensitivity;
and David Krumholtz has a solid comic relief role as Cameron's nerdy
comrade.  The adult roles are also satisfying for a change, primarily
because they aren't used simply as walls off of which teens can bounce
insults.  While Larry Miller obsesses as the Stratford' girls' teen
pregnancy-obsessed papa, Daryl "Chill" Mitchell gets a few funny scenes as
an angry English teacher and Allison Janney composes explicit romance
novels as guidance counselor Ms. Perky.  I actually found myself chuckling
at most of these characters instead of wishing desperately that they'd
just go away.</P>
<P>     Much of the credit for that should also go to writers Karen McCullah
Lutz and Kirsten Smith, who give the dialogue a bite that goes beyond
insult humor and high school patois.  Some of the best lines are
unprintable -- including Patrick's curiosity over why Bianca is so
desirable -- but they all seem to have been given at least a little
thought.  While the situations are teen-film predictable -- a party scene,
a prom scene, plenty of threats and posturing -- occasionally the writing
emerges to deliver an unexpected laugh.  It's not brilliant, but it's a
sharp step up from stupid.</P>
<P>     As likeable as parts of 10 THINGS aare, it's hard to get overly
enthusiastic about it.  Veteran sit-com director Gil Junger, making his
feature debut, slaps on a generous coat of sit-com glossiness, leaving
little room for the truly acidic wordplay of a "Taming of the Shrew."
It's a warm and fuzzy sort of teen film with some welcome positive
messages about independent thought and valuing depth of character, yet it
still rarely rises above the level of the blandly generic.  It might have
had a chance if so many sub-plots hadn't been packed into a tight
94-minute package, short-changing them all with shallowness.  Still, it's
enough of a surprise to find a teen film that doesn't overstay its welcome
instantly, let alone deserves more fleshing out.  It's enough to give you
hope that there's actually a good movie to be made in 1999 "...with
teenagers."</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 shrew maneuvers:  5.</PRE>
