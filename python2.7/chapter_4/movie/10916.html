The Replacement Killers (R) ***</PRE>
<P>Hong Kong action star Chow Yun-Fat is a living legend, and it's about time
that mainstream America found out.  The ever-charismatic Chow will
certainly have no trouble winning new fans with his English language debut,
Antoine Fuqua's brisk, explosive The Replacement Killers.</P>
<P>In comparison to the dark, complex collaborations with John Woo (who
executive produced) that made Chow an international superstar, Replacement
is not exactly the sturdiest of vehicles.  The entire storyline of Ken
Sanzel's thin script can be summed up by its title.  Chow plays John Lee, a
hitman who wants out of a contract with his mob boss employer (Kenneth
Tsang), who hence dispatches "replacements" to kill him and his ally, a
document forger named Meg Coburn (a game Mira Sorvino, running around in an
open shirt).</P>
<P>The plot is just the glue that holds together what is essentially one long
series of wildly choreographed gunfights, which is far from a bad thing.
Fuqua, whose slick style is best described as a cross between Michael Bay
and (of course) Woo, wisely lets Chow be Chow--in other words, do all the
things that makes him the coolest actor around.  Throughout the film, I
found myself breathing sighs of relief as the outrageous derring-do from
the Chow I know and love appeared onscreen--sliding on floors, flying
through the air, rolling around and flipping, firing from each hand.  Early
on, though, Fuqua makes a serious miscalculation by having Chow hold a gun
with both hands (believe it or not, Columbia Pictures reportedly brought in
someone to teach trigger-happy Chow how to shoot a gun), and his discomfort
is obvious.  But there is only one scene where he does so, and soon after
Chow is allowed to ease into his normal routine.</P>
<P>As well as Chow is serviced by The Replacement Killers, it still only
scratches the surface of his talent.  His dour role erases all traces of
his appealing sense of humor; Fuqua, perhaps caught up in his reverence for
the man, takes Chow's character a bit _too_ seriously, sometimes eliciting
an odd chuckle from the audience.   And the depth of his dramatic range is
only hinted at in the silent, subtly acted scene where Lee cannot go
through with what is to be his last hit. But I suppose all depth will
have to be reserved for when Chow reunites with Woo (which he is slated to
do in the forthcoming action comedy King's Ransom).  Until then,
Replacement will do.  It delivers all the mayhem and thrills one would
want--and expect--from a popcorn action film and serves as a perfectly
adequate American introduction to the living legend that is Chow Yun-Fat.</P>
