<P>     Quite a bit has happened in the year since JUDY BERLIN premiered at
the 1999 Sundance Film Festival, and won director Eric Mendelsohn the
Dramatic Competition Directing Award. One co-star, Edie Falco, has become
a household name as long-suffering mob wife Carmela Soprano on HBO's "The
Sopranos." Another co-star, Madeline Kahn, lost her battle with ovarian
cancer. Perhaps most significantly, AMERICAN BEAUTY became a critical and
popular success with its cynical take on the facade of suburban bliss. It
doesn't take long for a film's entire context to change. Could JUDY BERLIN 
avoid feeling instantly, jarringly out-of-step?</P>
<P>     In the case of JUDY BERLIN, such concerns probably seem silly,
since its style is already so surreal and timeless. His black-and-white
tale takes place during one eventful fall day in the Long Island town of
Babylon, during a solar eclipse.  30-year-old aspiring filmmaker David
Gold (Aaron Hornick) is back in town staying with his parents Art (Bob
Dishy), the grade school principal, and Alice (Madeline Kahn), a flighty
housewife. Art is the object of desire of teacher Sue Berlin (Barbara
Barrie), and the affections may even be requited. David, meanwhile, runs
into his old high school classmate and Sue's daughter Judy (Edie Falco),
who is ready to leave that very night for Los Angeles to pursue her dreams
of an acting career.</P>
<P>     If JUDY BERLIN looks and plays like a suburban spin on a Woody Allen
ensemble comedy, it shouldn't be surprising; Mendelsohn spent years as an
assistant costume designer for Allen films. Essentially it's a character
study, exploring the submerged longings of its suburban denizens that come
to the surface only when the eclipse causes time to stand still. Alice
wanders the streets, playing at exploring an alien world; a retired
teacher (Bette Henritze) in the early stages of Alzheimer's also wanders
in a search for something familiar. The veteran cast members deliver some
superb performances, particularly Kahn in a very funny yet very sad piece
of work, and Barrie as the not-well-liked teacher with an unknown inner
life. JUDY BERLIN manages to hit some effective comic notes while always
staying true to the small, very personal desires of even its peripheral
characters.</P>
<P>     Mendelsohn's main characters, however, fare less well. The title of
the film tells us to focus on the interaction between David and Judy as 
the thematic center, and, unfortunately, the center doesn't hold. David
exists primarily as a stand-in for the filmmaker -- the frequent, nudgy
references to the fact that we're watching a story that's going to be
turned into a film don't help matters -- and Hornick doesn't do enough
with what is there. Edie Falco, meanwhile, shows a wonderful range in a
character light years removed from Carmela Soprano. It's a very
entertaining performance as an endearing character, but Judy is more a
symbol of possible escape than a fully-realized person. While David's
mopey self-loathing may ultimately come in for affectionate mockery, that
doesn't make it any easier to latch on to him as a protagonist, or to care
about the fate of David and Judy's relationship.</P>
<P>     Even when he fumbles one of his sub-plots, Mendelsohn keeps JUDY
BERLIN enough on the sweet side of bittersweet that it remains appealing.
He seems to find the suburbs far from a soulless place hiding dark
secrets, but rather a place like any other where people suspect the best
moments may already have passed them by. The look (Jeffrey Seckendorf's
black-and-white cinematography) and sound (Michael Nicholas's piano and
harpsichord score) may contribute much to JUDY BERLIN's sense of
timelessness, but the story itself plays a significant role. The
characters in the film spend much of the running in place because they're
always looking behind them. How refreshing to find a film that suggests 
there's something to look forward to -- even in the suburbs.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 eclipse joints:  7.</PRE>
