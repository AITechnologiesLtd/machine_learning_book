The Opportunists</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>There's a scene in this slow emotionally reserved film that well describes
how audiences may feel about it. Christopher Walken (who's wonderful) has
been prompted via financial desperation and a small group of slimy
near-do-poorlies to come out of "normal life" and start cracking safes
again. In this particular scene, Walken is practicing on a few combination
locks while the group looks on.</P>
<P>Now, one might ask themselves, "Why are they watching him so intent, neatly
seated?" Ironically, this is the same question I asked of myself about the
film. And why does he want them to watch him? Again, what has the filmmaker
here for me to see (other than a good performance by Walken)? And in their
one last appreciation for my condition, the three thugs, initially excited
about seeing this man open locks ... fall asleep all over each other.</P>
<P>The film opens slowly while introducing us to the characters in the first
third. The second third, picks up the pace to leisurely at best. And just
when a shimmer of anticipation sparks interest, offering a ray of hope that
the pace will finally click into gear, the third third is completely absent.</P>
<P>There's nothing else overly incompetent about the picture. In fact, the
dialogue is quite strong, acting creditable and cinematography fine to
midland - it's just the pace and point.</P>
<P>One viewer who found the film interesting enough, still commented, "If I
were going to give this film a grade, it'd have to be an incomplete."</P>
