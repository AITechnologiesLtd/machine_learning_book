<P>American Pie is a guilty pleasure at its best, and an outrage at its 
worst. The film is indisputably funny; due to a script filled with 
hilarious and memorable quotes, and the forthright use of sexual 
content. However, the same sexual aspects push the movie's R rating 
closer to "adults only" than the target teenage audience, and the often 
predictable nature of the work plays as a spoiler as well.</P>
<P>Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), and 
Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) have three weeks left in their high school 
careers and all face a probable realization of their worst nightmare: 
graduating a virgin. The last straw for them comes when their friend 
Sherman, long considered a semi-geek, announces his introduction into 
manhood. Realizing that prom will be their last chance in high school to 
achieve their goal, the four friends make a pact to help each other and 
get the job done, no matter what the cost.</P>
<P>Candidates for the group's goal include a choir girl named Heather (Mena 
Suvari); Kevin's long time girlfriend, Vicky (Tara Reid); Nadia (Shannon 
Elizabeth's), a foreign exchange student; and some assorted other 
females. The guys also have friend Jessica (Natasha Lyonne, who is 
fabulous) to help out and give advice when things get way too bazaar.</P>
<P>The funniest part of the production is a sub plot focusing on Jim in 
particular, his relationship with his Dad, and a certain act of 
disparity he commits involving an apple pie. But it is Jim giving a live 
broadcast over the internet that wins the funniest scene contest.</P>
<P>The MPAA issued American Pie an R rating. However, the film is more 
deserving of an NC-17 rating that the user friendly R mark. Some of the 
more offensive scenes include masturbation with a sock, a condom, and 
the aforementioned baked goods. The movie also highlights two premature 
ejaculations, some dirty magazines, oral sex, regular sex, nudity, 
mention of masturbation with a musical instrument, the consumption of 
male bodily fluid, and an entire plot focussing on sex. If this film 
doesn't merit an NC-17 mark, then the MPAA needs to start asking itself 
what does.</P>
<P>One thing American Pie is not lacking is memorable quotes and moments. 
As the four friends agree to make a pact to lose their virginity, the 
audience is treated to the most uproariously funny speech since John 
Belushi addressed the Delta fraternity in another Universal film, 
National Lampoon's Animal House. This memorable speech ends, of course, 
with "We will get laid!" And Natasha Lyonne has wonderful advice for her 
friend who wants to experience her first time in the perfect 
setting-"it's not a space-shuttle launch. It's sex!" And some of the 
greatest dating advice ever "Just ask 'em questions and listen to what 
they have to say and (explicative)."</P>
<P>Unfortunately, American Pie does have some predictable aspects. The 
production also has the dubious accomplishment of being a high school 
comedy with a plot that leads to the prom, something that has become 
nearly synonymous with 1999. Perhaps the most predictable "surprise" of 
the movie is the revelation of a certain character's prevarication that 
became central to the plot. But to the credit of the film, the four 
central character's fate is unknown until the film ends.  </P>
<P>American Pie opens with a scrambled video. It is obvious that the video 
is pornographic and a teenager is getting his "jollies" from it. 
Ironically there may be no better metaphor for the film itself. It is an 
entertaining work that seems to have gotten scrambled somewhere in the 
process, but teenagers will still enjoy every last moment, just as most 
older audiences will as well. </P>
