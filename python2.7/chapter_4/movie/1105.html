<PRE>                                DOC HOLLYWOOD
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1991 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  A good director turns out his most
     commercial but least interesting film.  Michael Caton-Jones,
     the director of SCANDAL and MEMPHIS BELLE, tells the story of
     a big city doctor stranded in a small town in South Carolina
     who finds himself bewitched by the locals.  Pleasant but
     predictable.  Rating: 1 (-4 to +4).</P>
<P>     This whole film is something of a riddle and the riddle is what is
Michael Caton-Jones doing directing a film like this?  First, Caton-Jones is
British and DOC HOLLYWOOD is about small-town life in South Carolina.  That
cannot be a subject about which Caton-Jones is particularly expert.
Probably the closest Caton-Jones has ever been to the American South is
watching reruns of "The Andy Griffith Show."  That television show's
Mayberry has more than a passing resemblance to Grady, South Carolina.  But
Caton-Jones worked on ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS in a minor but formative capacity.
He went on to direct SCANDAL and MEMPHIS BELLE.  Each of these films was set
a generation or so back.  Each had notable actors but no big stars.  Each of
these films took something of a risk presenting what could have been an
unpopular viewpoint.  (An interesting piece of trivia: Mandy Rice-Davies
played in ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS, Bridget Fonda played in DOC HOLLYWOOD, and in
SCANDAL Bridget Fonda played Mandy Rice-Davies.)</P>
<P>     The story of DOC HOLLYWOOD is far from original: big-city boy meets and
falls in love with a small-town of interesting and eccentric characters.  I
have seen that plot attributed to Frank Capra, though I myself cannot think
of a single Capra film with a plot that seems to me all that similar to DOC
HOLLYWOOD.  I will, however, point out that this film has a strong
similarity to Bill Forsythe's LOCAL HERO.  I would claim that LOCAL HERO is
by far the better film, but if I were from Scotland I might well prefer a
film to show me exotic South Carolina.  The title is a nickname for
Dr. Benjamin Stone (played by Michael J. Fox), who is headed for a lucrative
cosmetic surgery practice in Beverly Hills when an accident and the damage
it causes forces him to spend some time in Grady, South Carolina.  You can
probably figure the plot from there.  Boy meets town.  Boy hates town.
Audience loves town.  Boy meets girl.  Girl hates boy.  Audience loves girl.
Boy loves girl.  Girl starts to like boy.  Boy starts to like town.  Boy,
girl, and town live happily ever after.  Together.  Audience leaves happy.</P>
<P>     I can be as silly as the next guy and I liked the town and laughed at
the jokes.  The town is likable.  The town is lovable.  What's not to love
about a town where blacks and whites, men and women, city folk and rednecks
all sashay together in perfect harmony, where never is heard a bigoted word
and nobody looks twice at gays.  This Southern town is the Ku Klux Klan's
worst nightmare come to life.  And the plot doesn't bear much thought
either.  One of the characters pays a minor podiatry bill with a pig whose
value is probably ten times the size of his debt.  He could easily have sold
the pig, paid his bill, and had a big piece of change in his pocket.</P>
<P>     Then there is the incredible stretching Michael J. Fox.  He has a lot
of scenes together with female lead Julie Warner.  Somehow when you see
full-length shots of the two of them she is perhaps an inch taller than he
is.  In every close-up she has to reach up to a Michael J. Fox who has a
good two or three inches on her.  This film is willing to find endearing all
sorts of eccentricities which Grady, South Carolina, accepts without batting
an eye, but would rather create a distraction than break the taboo that the
boy has got to be taller than the girl.  The film has people joke about how
short Dr. Stone is, but of course he finds a soulmate who is even shorter.</P>
<P>     DOC HOLLYWOOD is entertaining and pleasant but the audience gets none
of the value of seeing itself through someone else's eyes that they would
get from a Louis Malle film such as ATLANTIC CITY.  I rate it a flat +1 on
to -4 to +4 scale.</P>
