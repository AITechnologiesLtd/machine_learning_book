                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1993 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>95 min., R, Action, 1992
Director: Kevin Hooks
Cast: Wesley Snipes, Bruce Payne, Tom Sizemore, Bruce Greenwood,
      Elizabeth Hurley, Robert Hooks, Ernie Lively</P>
<P>     Bruce Payne is a British terrorist who is wanted for several plane
bombings.  The FBI catch Payne and transport him by plane to stand trial
in another state.  Payne, and a gang of his terrorists who have been
strategically placed on the plane, take over the plane and hold all the
passengers hostage.  Payne didn't count on passenger 57, Wesley Snipes,
who is one of the best terrorist annihilators in the business.</P>
<P>     PASSENGER 57 is the newest action film out, and will be battling
with Steven Segal's newest film UNDER SIEGE.  I feel that UNDER SIEGE is
better, but this film is definitely worth going to see.  I suggest this
film to fans of "shoot 'em up" action films.  Others will most likely
find this film a big waste of time and money.  I highly recommend
watching this film in the theaters, for it will be much more spectacular
there.  On a scale of zero to five, I give PASSENGER 57 a four.
PASSENGER 57 is rated R for explicit language and violence.</P>
<P>     PASSENGER 57 reminded me somewhat of the AIRPORT movies of the 70's
in which a plane full of people got involved in a tragedy.  That is
about as far as the similarity goes.  There are a few others, but to
disclose them could spoil the movie.  Bruce Payne gives the best
performance in the film.  He fits his role perfectly and is half the fun
of seeing the film.  Wesley Snipes, although he doesn't give the best
performance, is able to handle the film.  This not a dramatic film, so
great performances are not needed (look at Sylvester Stallone, Arnold
Schwarzenegger, and Steven Segal).  He can walk around with a gun in
this picture, and that is all he really needs to do.  Wesley Snipes can
do excellent performances, like in NEW JACK CITY, so I guess he decided
to take it easy in this film.</P>
<P>     The special effects for this film are very well done, and look real
good on the big screen.  The scenes involving the plane and the carnival
will most likely not look quite as good on a small television set, but
other than that, I think the rest of the movie will translate very well.
The film is well written and has all the standard action film equipment:
one very evil bad guy, one super-good good guy, one bimbo (for what ever
reason they are thrown in for), and several people who can die well.</P>
