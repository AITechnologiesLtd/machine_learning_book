<P>"Wishmaster" is a worthless excuse for a movie, horror or otherwise. It's a
cross between "The Monkey's Paw" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street", as we
learn about evil genies and their desire to take over the world. They can
only cause harm however when you ask them to grant you a wish. Of course,
whatever you wish for has some sort of sick and twisted spin on it, to only
benefit the evil genie (Andrew Divoff).</P>
<P>The film is your typical horror nonsense, lots of gore and screaming just
for the sake of having gore and screaming. The script is standard and the
acting is fair at best (Divoff, if he's using his actual voice, is pretty
interesting though). And fans of the genre will most likely enjoy seeing
various actors from other horror films in cameos here and there.</P>
<P>When the story begins we're in the middle ages, and a wizard or something is
battling these evil forces. The wizard manages to gain the upper hand, and
encases the evil into a brilliantly beautiful red gem. Why do that? Why put
pure evil in something which is bound to gain attention from people? Why not
encase the evil in a dirt clump or a rat dropping? No one's going to pick up
a rat dropping and polish it, breathe on it, and talk to it. This is the
type of stupid "movie logic" we're dealing with here. Just wish that you'll
never have to sit through this, like I did. [R]<HR>       The Jacksonville Film Journal -- Film Reviews by Chuck Dowling
