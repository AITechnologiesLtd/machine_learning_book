<PRE>ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>Spanish writer and director Pedro Almodóvar (WOMEN ON THE VERGE OF A
NERVOUS BREAKDOWN) loves to create movies featuring a cornucopia of
colorful characters.  In ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER he throws in everything but
the kitchen sink.  (Actually, for all we know, the sink may be there but
dressed up as something else.)</P>
<P>ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER (TODO SOBRE MI MADRE) has everything from a
pregnant, HIV-positive nun, Sister Rosa (Penélope Cruz), to a
transsexual, Agrado (Antonia San Juan), who has a female top and a male
bottom.  There's also a lesbian actress, Huma Rojo (Marisa Paredes),
with a drug addicted girlfriend, Nina (Candela Peña).</P>
<P>Soon after the movie opens, the story's protagonist, Manuela (Cecilia
Roth), loses her teenaged son, Esteban (Eloy Azorín).  As he chases
after Huma and Nina's taxi, he is killed by another car.</P>
<P>Her son's death sets Manuela off on a journey to locate his father, with
whom she lost contact after her son's birth.  Given the rest of the
plot, you probably will not be surprised to learn that her ex-husband is
an ex-man, now woman, named Lola (Toni Cantó).  It gets even more
complicated and convoluted.</P>
<P>One's enjoyment of the story depends on whether all of this quirkiness
is enough to sustain your interests.  After a while, I just got tired of
all of the overly cute twists and turns in the plot.  Some of the acting
is good, but that's about it.</P>
<P>ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER runs 1:45.  The film is in Spanish with English
subtitles.  It is rated R for sexuality including strong sexual
dialogue, language and some drug content and would be acceptable for
older teenagers.</P>
