<P>One way to determine how great a movie is, would be to calculate its
re-watchability quotient. I have seen this film over thirty times since its
inception, and have no qualms about watching it another hundred times in my
lifetime. It's a classic romantic comedy that is impeccably written,
wonderfully acted and beautifully shot under a fantastic musical umbrella of
love, fate and supreme friendship.</P>
<P>PLOT:
After College, two strangers named Harry and Sally drive from Chicago to New
York together and garner very little interest in each another. Five years
later, they meet again in an airport, with even less sparks flying this time
around. It isn't until another five years goes by, that Harry, now divorced,
and Sally, just getting off a five-year relationship, become friends, and
ultimately...much better friends.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
This film is the ultimate romantic comedy for all those people who don't
think that they will ever find anyone that is right for them. It isn't based
on the notion of the proverbial "love at first sight", but rather about the
more typical love that grows between two people who spend a lot of time
together, support one another through thick and thin, depend on each other
as best friends, and ultimately care more about each other than anyone else
in the world. Reminiscent of Woody Allen's ANNIE HALL (8/10), this is the
movie that sent Meg Ryan into cute, romantic, comedy movie star heaven, and
confirmed Billy Crystal as a viable romantic lead. The script is an
excellent breakdown of timeless conversations between the sexes ("Can men
and women ever be friends without sex getting in the way?" and "Will a
one-night stand with your best friend ultimately ruin your friendship?"),
witty repartee between the two leads, and a beautifully constructed love
story that is carefully assembled over time, and gently eases you into the
wonder of that thing called love.</P>
<P>This movie also offers one of the most romantic soundtracks that you'd ever
want to hear via a career-launching effort by Harry Connick Jr., an endless
array of picturesque scenes featuring the wonderful world of New York
Christmas at its best, quotable dialogue galore, and solid supporting
performances from Bruno Kirby and Princess-Leia-for-life, Carrie Fisher. The
only complaint that I have about this movie is that it is only ninety
minutes long. Other than that, it delivers a timeless tale of a charming
couple falling in love, intercut with various couples relating their own
accounts of l'amour de leur vie, with humor laced through every scene, and a
tangible sense of hope for all those who still believe in great friends,
fate and love.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
The lady who says "I'll have what she's having" in the infamous Meg Ryan
"faking an orgasm" scene is none other that Estelle Reiner, director Rob
Reiner's own mom. Rob's daughter with former wife and director in her own
right, Penny Marshall (Laverne from TV's "Laverne & Shirley"), also stars in
this film as Emily. She is dating Harry in one scene at Jess and Marie's
home. Penny Marshall and Rob Reiner were married for eight years from 1971
to 1979.
Screenwriter Nora Ephron went on to write and direct two very similar, but
not nearly as good, romantic comic tales called SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE
(6.5/10) and YOU'VE GOT MAIL (5.5/10). Her script for WHEN HARRY MET SALLY
nabbed her an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay at the 1989
Academy Awards. It lost to Tom Shulman's script for DEAD POET'S SOCIETY.
Notice how the last names of the two main characters are reflective of their
attitudes in life. Billy Crystal as Harry BURNS, and Meg Ryan as Sally
ALBRIGHT.
There is one scene in which Billy Crystal's character can clearly be seen
reading Stephen King's MISERY, which would ultimately be director Rob
Reiner's next picture.
This film surprisingly grossed close to $93 Million at the box-office, and
was one of Barry Sonnenfeld's last as a cinematographer as he went
on to direct such films as the two ADDAMS FAMILY flicks, GET SHORTY
and MEN IN BLACK (7/10).
The "real-life" couples featured in the intercut scenes telling their
stories of love, are actually actors.</P>
