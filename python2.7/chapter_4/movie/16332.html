<P>Wayne Wang's most recent feature, "Chinese Box," is best described as an
intriguing mess: several strong performances amid some interesting themes
don't quite manage to form a coherent whole. It's somewhat frustrating to
watching because the film feels like it could have been much better.
Still, there's plenty to enjoy as it is.</P>
<P>With the handover of Hong Kong to China in mid-1997 impending, Jeremy
Irons, as a British writer/journalist named John, learns he is dying of
leukemia--in fact, dying at a rate that means he'll disappear from the
scene at about the same time the British will. The obvious allegory is,
unfortunately, not as well developed as it might be; at least, much of the
plot doesn't seem to support the allegory in any intelligible way. The
film follows his relationships with two Chinese women--Gong Li's
prostitute-turned-nightclub-owner Vivian, and Maggie Cheung's feisty
street hustler Jean. Oddly, though, the stories of the three individuals
are arguably more compelling than the relationships between them: Vivian,
though she has made her way out of prostitution, is nonetheless barred by
her past from marrying her businessman lover, and must resort to sending
home fake wedding pictures. Jean hawks pirated videos and pines for her
British boyfriend--yet, when he surfaces and acknowledges that he has
forgotten her completely, she shrugs it off after a moment and goes back
to work. And John, onetime writer of a tome called "How to Make Money in
Asia," is forced by his illness to see the reality of Hong Kong, even as
he fades away from it. His unrequited love for Vivian never seems fully
realized, since the two characters don't get to interact much until the
end of the film--and, oddly, John's scenes with Jean have more life.</P>
<P>Irons, as usual, fills out his part nicely; he makes the audience believe
in his illness, seemingly becoming paler and more gaunt over the course of
the story, and, like the British presence, increasingly muted and
insubstantial. (Hmmm. Maybe that allegory worked after all.) Cheung,
erstwhile action-movie star, is a burst of energy in a sometimes languid
film; more self-possessed and more savvy than the other two leads, she is
the only one who seems to have a clear direction. Li's icy aloofness will
be familiar to those who know her from past efforts, mostly under the
direction of Zhang Yimou: "Raise the Red Lantern," "Ju Dou," "To Live,"
and "Shanghai Triad," as well as "Farewell My Concubine" and "Temptress
Moon", saw her refining her imperious air. But this is the first role
speaking mostly in English, and at times she struggles to make herself
understood (though at other times she comes through with what sounds
almost like an American twang). (One scene where she tries to imitate
Marlene Dietrich's voice has something of a self-referential quality.) And
it's difficult for the audience to connect with her character, since the
film is played mostly through Irons's eyes and Irons doesn't really
understand her himself. Still, Li has a subtly expressive face that makes
her enjoyable to watch, even though enigmatic.</P>
<P>Wang's quasi-documentary style does not serve him well here. Much of the
dialogue was drowned out by background noise; Li's lines in particular,
which would have been difficult to understand in the best of
circumstances, take some repeat listening to decipher. The shaky-camera
technique, though it imparts an air of realism, becomes tired and
distracting after a while. Though there are moments when the handheld
camera works well--following Cheung down an alley, for example--it more
often calls attention away from the lead actors and onto the director.
Aside from a few moments at the beginning and the end, moreover, the
political element hardly makes it into the film, which is unfortunate
because the documentaryish angle might have served Wang well there.
Instead, the love story becomes the bulk of the plot--and considering how
little development that story receives, the film sometimes slows almost to
a halt. With lesser actors than these three, it could have been rather
wearying.</P>
<P>There are things to enjoy about "Chinese Box," but the movie as a whole
needs some work. If you're a Gong Li or Jeremy Irons fan, give it a shot.</P>
