<P>Statistics differ and are unreliable. Still, the champion fictional
character in movies is Sherlock Holmes, with about 200 films, followed by
Dracula (ca.150), and the Frankenstein monster (ca.100). Figures for
Tarzan, though most confusing, probably exceed 100 if the count includes
parodies, oddities and the many productions made in India.</P>
<P>The original "Tarzan of the Apes" (1918) was Elmo Lincoln  (born Otto Elmo
Linkenhelt,1899-1952) who went on to more T-movies, then to just bit parts.
The first major  sound-era Tarzan --and still the most popular --was
Johnny Weissmuller (Peter John Weissmuller, 1904-1984)). Both men were
Americans (Indiana-born Lincoln's first profession was as an Arkansas
cop).Weissmuller was born in Pennsylvania --although one source  says it
was in Rumania, near Timisoara, and from parents of Hungarian nationality.
It is said that he was a sickly boy who took up swimming on the advice of a
doctor. He studied at the  University of Chicago, became Olympic swimming
champion (5 gold medals) at the 1924 and 1928 games, held a profusion of
world records and had already acted before he made his first T-movie,
"Tarzan, the Ape Man" (1932). It was a big hit, and,to this day remains one
of the best Tarzan films.</P>
<P>Tarzanophiles rate the 1934  sequel "Tarzan and his Mate," with Weissmuller
and Maureen O'Sullivan, as the premier Tarzan movie. A recent re-viewing on
AMC confirms this judgment. The film is vibrant. Some of the special
effects may be transparent, but several others are quite sophisticated and
others yet, impressive even today: such as the mutliple prides of lions and
the face-offs between explorers and beasts. And of course there's the
lovely, initiative-taking O'Sullivan, as a sexy and thinking Jane. She is
glimpsed more than once in the buff, something unusual in those days of
restrictions by the Hollywood Code.</P>
<P>I believe, though not all critics do, that the summit of screen Tarzanism
came with he 1984
"Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes." It was revisionist,
perhaps even post-modernist, humanistic, ecological, sociological, touching
and  technically a tour-de-force.</P>
<P>Enough of prolegomena. In the just-released "Tarzan and the Lost City,"
John Clayton, Lord Greystoke (a.k.a. Tarzan) is in 1913 Suffolk, about to
wed Jane, when he is sent by telepathy a vision, a cry for help by his
never-forgotten African friends. He takes the first boat to Africa.</P>
<P>The natives are the victims of depredations,violence and murder in the
hands of merciless whites led by Nigel Ravens. Ravens, though just vaguely
shown as a scientist-explorer-mercenary,is clearly a  vile, shifty-eyed
plunderer who will do anything for riches, from capturing animals to
killing humans for precious stones or gold. His ultimate aim is to find the
lost city of Opar with its legendary treasures.</P>
<P>After a six-week voyage, Greystoke is in Central Africa (shot in South
Africa). Soon after, Jane surprises him by showing up. She carries a nice
wardrobe and her brother's pistol. Much smooching ensues. It will continue
punctuating the action, which is politically correct as the blacks are
good,the Europeans bad, save for a friend of Tarzan's who, of course, has
to die.</P>
<P>The adventures that follow totally lack credibility, even by Tarzanian or
cartoon standards. Minor examples: Tarzan breaks in two a heavy rifle on
his knee; poisoned by a snake, he lies unconscious, is covered by a huge
swarm of bees, recovers magically; he takes Jane to their old tree-house
where they dance the Blue Danube Waltz played on an intact phonograph.The
record is scratchy, then swells into DTS multi-stereo. The bad 'uns get a
machine-gun but miss the couple, while pistol-packing Jane hits
bull's-eyes, among the other abundant bull in the story. When trekking with
the baddies, as their captive, she suddenly appears with a fresh, clean
blouse. Etc.</P>
<P>The film is muddled, incoherent in writing, editing. continuity and
staging, heavy-handed in every way. And the characters talk at the other
characters, not to them.</P>
<P>With the discovery of Opar, which is like a Mayan pyramid, dumbness
skyrockets. Anything arbitrary or preposterous goes. The tale switches
gears into magic. Special effects take over. Morphing reigns: statues into
drum-beating automatons, statues into warriors, bones into warriors (and
vice-versa), something into a colossal cobra, the movie's audience into
somnambulists.</P>
<P>Casper Van Dien (Tarzan) is an American whose main claim to fame was in
"Starship Troopers";   Brit Jane March (Jane) debuted in Jean-Jacques
Annaud's "The Lover," her only good film to date. Van Dien is homo sapiens
pectoralis. March is toothsome, and then some. Considered from any point of
view, "TLC" is a messy pot-pourri whose only  interest is  some beautiful
vistas and many impressively painted tribesmen. The initials TLC could have
also stood for Tender Loving Care, but there's none of it lavished on the
movie.</P>
