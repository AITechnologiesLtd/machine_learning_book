<P>   It is a fact well established that people travel exclusively to
impress their friends.  Knowing that, it's surprising that New
Yorkers will vacation merely in Puerto Rico and the English in
Benidorm.  Could you not better arouse the envy and
admiration of your buddies back home by making Nepal your
destination?  After all, why fool around with Bunker Hill when
you gaze at Mount Everest--even try your skill at climbing a
mile or so?  But think about this.  Many people have tried to
climb to the summit and died.  At least one adventurer lost
both of his hands to frostbite.  When stormy weather comes
and the wind-chill favor falls to one hundred degrees below
zero, you may wish you had gone to Disneyworld instead.  </P>
<P>   But if you're still game to try, you have this consolation:
your body will help you to adjust.  If you ascend gradually, the
number of red cells in your body will double so that you can
acquire more oxygen.  (If you tried to go from sea level to
the top in one fell swoop, you'd be unconscious in minutes,
dead shortly thereafter.)   On the other hand, as you
approach the summit, don't expect to be able to think straight,
to jog to the top, to sleep or even eat.  Mother Nature uses
every trick in her book to prevent you from reaching your
goal, and to prove this, MacGillivray Freeman Films has put
together a spectacular, forty-five minute film which no mere
printed material could possibly replicate.  "Everest," one of
the most impressive nature film ever released, is on display
on the 77-foot screen of New York's Sony IMAX theater and
will be screened, presumably at additional IMAX locations. 
Filmed in 2-D and thereby requiring no special devices for
viewing, "Everest" makes a good case for reserving half of
IMAX screens for pictures using this less adventurous
technology.  What you lose from bypassing the in-your-face
highlight of the 3-D machinery you gain in lightness of head
and the familiar border separating you, the audience, from
them, the performers.  "Everest," in fact, has its own three-
dimensional look that conventional screens are quite unable
to imitate.</P>
<P>   Filmed in Utah, New Hampshire, Colorado, Baja California
and Nepal, "Everest" answers the question posed by the
magazine "Nineteenth Century" during the 1870s, "Can Mount
Everest Be Climbed?" In a brief historical footnote, we learn
that New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Sherpa mountaineer
Tenzing Norgay reached the summit May 29, 1953.  Like the
breaking of the four-minute mile by an Australian runner
decades ago, this breakthrough led to several successful
expeditions between then and now, though the feat is hardly a
piece of cake.  Though seven hundred people have reached
the top, one hundred fifty died trying.</P>
<P>   The expedition team which filmed "Everest" was led by
David Breashears, who signed Ed Viesturs to the team--a
man who not only had reached the summit twice before but
did so without extra oxygen.  Also joining the team were
Viesturs's wife, Paula, who not unwisely thought that this was
a strange sort of honeymoon; Jamling Tenzing Norgay, who is
the son of Tenzing Norgay (Hillary's guide in '53); and Araceli
Segarra, whose goal was to become the first Spanish woman
ever to reach the top of the world.  To train for the trip, the
Viesturses rode their bikes across some Utah canyons, in
itself an expedition far too dangerous for most people to
undergo as a sudden flat or an improper turn would lead bike
and rider down a slipper slope.  The viewer is already given
the treat of this spectacular rocky scenery right here in our
own country, a setting that could perhaps be surpassed in
resplendence only by Mount Everest itself.  </P>
<P>   David Breashears's camera tracks the climb from base
camp to the higher levels, focusing on points of singularly
high drama, particularly on the Khumbu glacier--a moving
waterfall of ice, considered the deadliest place on the
mountain because ice blocks can shift and swallow a climber. 
Though the presentation is essentially a travelogue--a
uniquely magnificent one at that--"Everest" underscores some
plot points particularly in its visual description of the plight of
one of the climbers, who had left his pregnant wife in New
Zealand to make the ascent and died during a fierce storm. 
Spectators in the IMAX audience are given the actual
struggle to save his life, as climbers from the safer base
thousands of feet below radioed him to try to assure the
hapless adventurer that everything would be all right.  In the
film's climactic moment, Segarra is shown at the moment she
becomes the first Spanish woman to reach the top of the
world.</P>
<P>   At a special invitational screening, the world's second such
event, the audience were treated to a brief conference by
Breashears and Viestura, who answered questions from the
audience, the most poignant being "What do you do with the
bodies of those who die in the attempt?"  "There are no
formal burials," explained the director, "As there is now way
that the extra weight can be supported."  Victims are left
where they are, at best covered up by those who discover
them.</P>
<P>   Getting to the top of nature's most impressive giant is
awe-inspiring enough.  Getting there while toting some of the
heaviest and most sophisticated cameras yet known--
instruments which will not quit at 40 below--is imposing.  In
short, "Everest" is not your usual set of travel photographs
that you carry back to bore your friends and relatives with.</P>
