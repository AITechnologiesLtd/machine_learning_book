<PRE>Hungarian Fairy Tale (1987)</PRE>
<P>(also known as Hol volt, hol nem volt; Hungarian with English subtitles,
black and white) </P>
<P>I read a description of this film in 1989, and I had dreamed of seeing it
ever since. So, I was very excited to see the movie on the Walter Reade
Theatre's schedule for *Somewhere in Europe*, a festival of Hungarian
films from a variety of decades.</P>
<P>The problem with a dream come true is that the dream is often better than
reality, and that you are better left with your illusions. </P>
<P>*Hungarian Fairy Tale* is the story of Andris, a boy whose father is
absent and whose mother is tragically killed in a street mishap. Andris
Orban "knows" his father's name--but it is the name that a bureaucrat
chose for him. According to the director (who was present at the
screening), there actually was a law in Hungary that demanded a fake name
be given to children conceived out of wedlock when the father was unknown
or unnamed. As is often the case in the old Eastern bloc, lies have a way
of ripening and coming to term when you least expect them to. So, upon the
death of his mother, Andris decides to seek out his father in the small
town where his birth certifcate says he can find him. This seems a better
idea than being sent to a state-run orphanage.</P>
<P>The film starts out strong, with dreamlike scenes of the first moments of
romance between Andris's parents. They meet at a performance of the Magic
Flute, where she has just sung her solo. The black and white scenes of the
couple walking around Budapest at night are really spectacular.  Also, the
scenes of Andris hiding out inhis apartment, and hoping his mythical
father will show up there are very stirring and tense.</P>
<P>But then Andris goes to the small town where his father is supposed to
live. He winds up hungry, and holds up a woman in her own home for food. 
Meanwhile, the bureaucrat who signed Andris's certificate is having a wee
nervous breakdown, and starts collecting all the papers he processed and
burns them.</P>
<P>It is possible that cultural differences have made this highly allegorical
film difficult to understand and enjoy. The significance of a bureaucrat
and his victim in communist Hungary is probably more potent for a native
audience. However, the big problem, I think from any standpoint, is the
odd finale. Why the three principal characters wind up together is not
easy to figure out. Also, the really awful special effects at the symbolic
ending really mar the film. It's almost like watching two different films
when you contrast the chase scenes at the end to the romantic, richly
photographed finale. </P>
<P>The best performance is clearly that of David Vermes, who plays Andris.
Maria Varga performance as his mother Maria is also very touching and
loving.</P>
<P>Add a star if you know Hungarian; half a star if you really are familar
with Hungarian 20th Century history. </P>
