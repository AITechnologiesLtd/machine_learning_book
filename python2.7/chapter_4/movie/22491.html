Bicentennial Man</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Patiently directed (occasionally too patiently), "Bicentennial Man" is warm
and cuddly, but not the over-the-top kind of comedy or intensity we've come
to expect from Robin Williams. Which probably accounts for at least some of
the negative reaction to it. The schmaltz factor remaining in tact, the tale
becomes kind of an E.T. matures and falls in love story. Not too exciting
for kids, but not bad for we -- more matured types.</P>
<P>Spanning a couple hundred years (hence the title) in a smidgen over two
hours, we follow the "life" of Android "Andrew" from his introduction to the
Martin family in 2005. Andrew shows a propensity towards art and culture
(fixing an old record player and mellowing to Mozart) not common (or
explicable) to Androids of his series. Able to simulate expression with
blinking eyes and raise-able brows, Andrew personifies man's own quest to
understand and better express himself as he seeks humanity.</P>
<P>The film raises interesting questions regarding humankind's ability to
assimilate (on a mass scale) appliances that become too human. But, it's
main point is Andrew's quest and ultimate ability to fall in love.</P>
<P>Outstanding performance by Wendy Crewson as she plays two or three members
of the Martin family over three generations. All others are fine as is the
script and direction, though this gently paced movie drags at a point or
two.</P>
