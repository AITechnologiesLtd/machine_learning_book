<P>     You've been dining for weeks on haute cuisine with designer
ingredients and frou-frou presentations; suddenly you find yourself
munching a roadhouse cheeseburger, and nothing ever tasted so good.
This, in essence, is the appeal of the indie thriller phenomenon "The
Blair Witch Project".  To a public sated with the billion-dollar
effects of modern cinema tech, there's something irresistible about
this bare-bones little horror story, shot on 16mm and high-8 video,
without any special effects, on a budget you could carry in your
pocket in coins.
     "Blair" is a faux documentary (the hip word is "mockumentary"; I
offer "crockumentary").  It purports to be footage shot by a trio of
student filmmakers (Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, and Joshua
Leonard) that was discovered a year after they disappeared in the
Maryland woods while shooting a documentary about a legendary
child-killing witch.
     Heather, Josh, and Mike start off in high spirits, recording each
other in the car and the motel room.  They interview locals and
explore sites connected to the folklore.  Then they head into the
woods with backpacks, a map, and a compass in search of an old
graveyard.  The seem to have plenty of film and an endless appetite
for shooting it.
     But soon they're hopelessly lost, and this is where the
creepiness creeps in.  Fear comes at them from two angles -- the
growing terror of being lost in the woods, and the encroaching horror
of the witch lore.  They begin to hear things -- real, or hysterical
suggestion?  They begin to find things -- ominous ritualistic-looking
bundles of sticks and piles of stones.  Something's out there...is it
supernatural, or psychotic?  Tempers flare, nerves crack.  Things get
very, very bad.  Then they get worse.
     Point-of-view is the inspiration that makes this movie click.
Everything we see is recorded by the young documentarians on their
16mm b&w production camera and the color camcorder brought by Heather
to document her documentary.  We're there with them -- there's no
omniscient crew, no other reality behind the camera.  It's all
subjective, hand-held, grainy and jerky.  On the upside this provides
immediacy; on the downside, it can make you a little nauseous, and you
welcome moments when the screen goes black and there's only audio from
the DAT recorder.
     "Blair" is a welcome antidote to gore, gadgets, explosions, and
computerized excess.  But despite the internet-orchestrated hype, it's
not the scariest thing you've ever seen.  It lives and dies on
credibility, and having committed themselves to the first-person
camera, the filmmakers find themselves in the awkward position of
having to keep the camera rolling when circumstances make it almost
impossible to believe.</P>
