<P>PLAYING BY HEART by DeWyNGaLe    Rating: A-</P>
<P>Going into this movie, I didn't know anything about it except for the cast
members, and that it was about couples and what they go through.  The only
reason I went to see this movie was because of the large cast, and I am very
glad I did go.  The cast consists of Gena Rowlands, Gillian Anderson, Sean
Connery, Angelina Jolie, Ryan Phillippe, Jon Stewart, Jay Mohr, Anthony
Edwards, Madeline Stowe, Dennis Quaid, and Ellen Burnstyn.  Playing By Heart is
about many couples, and what life is like in the real world.</P>
<P>Gena Rowlands and Sean Connery play Hannah and Paul, a couple that has been
married for forty years.  Paul and Hannah are constantly fighting, and things
aren't really working out between them.  Hannah finds out some secrets that
Paul has kept from her all his life and becomes extremely angered with him. 
Gena Rowlands and Sean Connery do excellent as their characters.  Although they
are extremely undeveloped, you could still get a good feel of how the
characters were.</P>
<P>Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillippe play Joan and Kennan, two wild and crazy kids
who have been through a lot.  Joan and Kennan both go to dance clubs in their
spare time, and that is where the two first meet.  Ryan and Angelina click on
the big screen.  Keenan has been through a lot through his life, including the
death of the only woman he has ever loved.  Joan also has been through a lot of
heartache in her life as well.  Angelina Jolie gives the best performance of
the large cast, stealing every scene she is in.  With her wild outfits and her
one-eyed cat, and Kennan's blue hair and unique habits, this couple becomes the
most fun to watch.  The two characters get the most screen time, and their
characters are well developed. </P>
<P>Gillian Anderson and Jon Stewart play another couple.  Gillian Anderson plays
Meredith, a play director, and Jon Stewart plays Trent, an architect.  Meredith
is the type who isn't into dating or anything like it.  She is still upset
about her previous marriage, when she found out her husband was gay.  Trent is
there to try to help her, but she becomes angered even more.  It was
interesting to watch Gillian Anderson on the screen outside of the X-Files
series.  She did a good job of acting, and she should have a successful movie
career.  Jon Stewart does a good job as well, but the performance was somewhat
disappointing.  I think that he was miscast in the role of Trent.</P>
<P>The other two couples are involved in the film are Mildred (Ellen Bunstyn), and
her son, Mark, (Jay Mohr) who has AIDS, and the other couple is Gracie,
(Madeline Stowe) and Roger. (Anthony Edwards) These two couples didn't get much
screen time, and weren't developed very much at all.  The other character in
the film hanging around is Hugh, played by Dennis Quaid.  Quaid gives a funny,
outstanding performance.  Hugh doesn't accomplish much throughout the film,
except for going from bar to bar lying to everyone he can.</P>
<P>Playing By Heart is a realistic movie, not a love fairy tale that couldn't
exist in real life.  The movie was very true to life, and I admired that.  The
ending was also extremely well done.  Endings can be one of the most important
parts of the film, because it is the last impression of the movie you get, and
Playing By Heart's ending certainly was great.  I don't know what it was about
Playing By Heart that got me, but it worked.  It is a very touching story of
what you can go through in life.  It wasn't pure drama though, in fact, there
were many very funny scenes throughout the film.  Willard Carroll, director of
this film, hasn't had many motion picture credits as of yet, but hopefully he
will deliver some more wonderful pieces of work.</P>
<P>The Bottom Line- Playing By Heart has a little something for every age, even
teenagers.        </P>
