<PRE>                                BIRD ON A WIRE
                                  [Spoilers]
                       A film review by Robert Dorsett
                        Copyright 1990 Robert Dorsett</PRE>
<P>     BIRD ON A WIRE is the latest star vehicle for Mel Gibson and Goldie
Hawn.  It features Gibson as Rick Jarmin; Hawn as his ex-wife*, Marianne
Graves.  To cut a very long, convoluted story short, Gibson's in the
Federal Witness  Protection Program.  He has been forced to transfer
from invisible job to invisible job over a fifteen-year period; part of
his cover has been to pretend that he's dead.  He runs into his wife
(who is now a high-powered attorney) one day, much to her surprise.
Coincidentally, someone who doesn't like him wants him dead, and spends
a great deal of time trying to do just that*.  Gibson is forced to use
her, and, in the ensuing chase, they get to rekindle their earlier
romance.</P>
<P>     The story is very, very weak, and has little more than Hawn looking
cute and Gibson posturing.  There are numerous allusions to Gibson's
gluteus maximus; it quickly gets boring after a while.  The rest of the
film amounts to gasoline explosions, car chases, lots of noise, the
inexplicable bad guys, and jokes about the conflict between Gibson's
working-class character and Hawn's refined character (And Guess What:
Love Triumphs!  SURPRISE!!!).  YAWN.</P>
<P>     There are numerous product placements: BMW, Four Seasons, Apple
(including an obscene user interface on a Mac; I don't know why Apple
let them do that--looks like a PC), etc.  I guess they didn't manage to
get an American Express or Visa endorsement, but every time Hawn says
"my gold card," her face is away from the camera--don't be surprised if
it's dubbed in when it comes out on video tape.  :-)</P>
<PRE>     DOWNER</PRE>
<P>     If you want to see yet another film with Gibson as a Sex Symbol,
Hawn as a Giddy Flake, and Carradine as a Bad Guy with an Attitude, SEE
THIS MOVIE.  I, however, was bored out of my mind (and judging by all
the heads propped on hands near the end, everyone else was, too).  Skip
it: 5/10 (two stars).  It's worth about a buck: if you must see it,
catch it on cable or video.</P>
<PRE>* SPOILERS</PRE>
<P>     I may have been dozing, but didn't they technically say that Gibson
ran off at the altar?  If so, how could Hawn be the self-described
grieving widow (hotel scene)?  Am I missing something in their use of
idiom?</P>
<P>     And the entire premise of the the movie: why the hell were these
people after Gibson in the first place?  Why waste the time or effort?
And why would the people the ex-DEA people were doing a deal with want
Gibson dead?  The story has holes one can drive a truck through.  I can
buy Carradine's character wanting Gibson dead, but wasn't he just a
minion, and unlikely to sway the Organization to his point of view?
Revenge apart, why waste time on someone who ceased being a threat
fifteen years previously, and who obviously wants to be left alone (as
evidenced by the lack of contacts with the feds)?</P>
<P>     The flying scenes were stupid.  Enough said: the
real-plane/helicopter scenes were quite different from the flying
models.  When are filmmakers going to realize that models just don't
look like the the real thing?  I was interested to note, though, that
the helicopter had a G (Great Britain) prefix, while the airplane had
an N (American) prefix.  Where was this thing filmed?  </P>
<P>     The whole zoo scene was idiotic.  I kept on thinking: "Don't they
feed those animals?"  And why should the animals pass up fresh, bloody
bait (at the end) to continue to snap at Gibson dangling from the
foot-bridge?  And why would the animal go after Hawn's jacket, when she
throws it away, when it has a nice, plump side of meat in front of it?
:-)</P>
<P>     Lastly, the movie seems to be intended for television: virtually no
profanity, and surprisingly little physical violence.  Only one Good Guy
got waxed; the rest of the film showed Rick and Marianne being *very*
careful not to actually *hurt* the people who were trying to bury them.
Gibson as pacifist?  Yeeeesh...</P>
