<PRE>DIE HARD: WITH A VENGEANCE (1995)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2001</PRE>
<P>There are plenty of people who have good reasons to hate
terrorists, and American filmmaker John McTiernan is one of
them. In 1993 his film THE LAST ACTION HERO had to have its
publicity campaign redesigned because of the first WTC
bombing. Two years later, McTiernan's film DIE HARD: WITH A
VENGEANCE, the third instalment in the series started by
1988 DIE HARD, suffered at the box-office because the US
public after Oklahoma City bombing didn't appreciate a plot
dealing with mad bomber blowing half of New York city.
Today, after New York has suffered even worse terrorist
outrage in real life, watching of DIE HARD: WITH A VENGEANCE
is probably unbearable for American audience.</P>
<P>The protagonist of third DIE HARD film is still New York
policeman John McLane (played by Bruce Willis), reluctant
hero who always happens to land in the wrong place at the
wrong time, wreck various terrorist schemes and saves his
family in the process. This time McLane is in worse shape
than in previous two films - wife left him, he had started
to drink, and, as result, is expected to be kicked out of
NYPD. His career is, at least temporarily, rescued by a
terrorist who targeted McLane himself - after the series of
bombings all over New York City, police receives a call by
someone who calls himself Simon (played by Jeremy Irons) and
wants to play game with the detective. McLane must complete
the series of bizarre and often life-threatening tasks, and
Simon would in exchange give the locations of various
explosive devices scattered all over New York City. McLane
is in his quest joined by black storeowner Zeus (played by
Samuel L. Jackson) and two of them slowly discover the true
motive of Simon's actions and diabolical plan that lies
behind the whole mayhem.</P>
<P>Seeing that DIE HARD created whole new sub-genre of action
films, McTiernan and his scriptwriter Jonathan Hensleigh not
only abandoned the DIE HARD formula, but also turned it
upside down. Instead of having action at a single, usually
claustrophobic location, they scatter it all over town and
forcing protagonists to rush from one location to another.
This was an excellent opportunity for numerous exciting and
breath-taking action scenes in which McTiernan again showed
his great talent for this brand of filmmaking. For a while,
viewers are so overwhelmed with spectacular on-screen action
that they forget the fact that the main character is reduced
to cardboard cut-out of himself, at least compared to two
previous films. Some supporting characters are much better,
though - Samuel L. Jackson brings a lot of "buddy buddy"
dynamic to the relationship between Zeus and McLane, while
British actor Jeremy Irons obviously has a lot of fun
playing suave and deadly villain, although he can't compete
with Alan Rickman in the first film. Unfortunately, the film
looses pace in the last segments, the action, albeit
spectacular, is rather predictable and the film nearly
collapses in the finale. The ending, that could have been
perfect with Bad Guys winning (and thus leaving the room for
further sequels and providing McLane with adequate
archrival), is totally uninspiring and lacks any kind of
catharsis seen in previous two films. However, although DIE
HARD: WITH A VENGEANCE represents a huge disappointment for
all those who had expected high standards of original film
(and even compared to 1990 sequel), it is still a good
example of a talented action director displaying his talents
in an entertaining way. It is a shame that for millions of
people this film is not as entertaining as it was only five
weeks ago.</P>
