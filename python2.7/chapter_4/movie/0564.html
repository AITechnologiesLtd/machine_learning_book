<P>     LA PASSION DE JEANNE D'ARC is Dreyer's critically acclaimed film that used
the texts of Joan of Arc's trial to portray her inquisition and execution.
While I can't say that I was riveted by this film through its entire length, I
was constantly amazed by camera-angles, realistic "you-are-there" newsreel-
style footage, and the restraint on facial expressions used by the actors.  (It
is not completely without hammy acting, though.)  Joan is particularly
impressive, as portrayed by Maria Renee Falconetti; she plays Joan as a
frightened young woman, confused by the church's hatred for her, but courageous
(and finally, courageously resigned) in her faith.  This was apparently
Falconetti's only film role; she certainly made the most of it.</P>
<P>     The film is certainly designed to make the viewer sympathize with Joan,
but it does it through lighting, music and close-ups of the characters' faces.
Again, the film is not without sneering, complacent villains, but Dreyer tends
to concentrate on their ignorance, rather than any evil stereotypes.  There are
also some rather strong scenes while Joan is being weakened by bleedings (the
audience seemed to visibly shudder as one).</P>
<P>     This film was thought to be lost for decades; the British National Film
Archive restored this print, which was recently discovered in a Norwegian
mental asylum.  (!! This must have been something of an inspiration to the
inmates.  One wonders if it was next to a print of ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S
NEST....)</P>
<P>     For general film viewers, this may well be too dry; but one doesn't have
to be a cinema scholar to appreciate how pioneering Dreyer was in many of his
celluoid story-telling.</P>
