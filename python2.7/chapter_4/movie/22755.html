<P>Pedro Almodovar made several shorts in 1974-79 and 13 features since 
1980 ("Dark Habits,'' Matador,'' "Women on the Verge of a Nervous 
Breakdown,'' "High Heels," etc.)  Though in Number 14    Almodovar 
seems to be gentler and kinder, it is no 180-degree departure from 
his past work. The enfant terrible of Spanish cinema, whether on the 
surface or below it, has always been kind,  gentle and humorous, and 
"Mother" has a lot of humor. It also has a lot of sadness, but it is 
mostly overcome by spunk, love and women's solidarity. For this is a 
movie  about women, dedicated to them, and placing them on some 
--admittedly weird--pedestals --and a paean to motherhood.</P>
<P>Enchanting, Argentina-born Cecilia Roth plays Manuela. In Madrid, she 
is a nurse, a coordinator of transplants in a hospital, and the 
single mother of Esteban. The mother-son relationship is beautiful in 
its friendship and affection. The boy, charming, smart, gifted, 
precociously cultured, wants to be a writer. He's already keeping 
notes.  Manuela has told that his father died before Esteban was 
born, but she keeps mum about anything regarding that man. She has 
old photos of herself where one-half is torn off. It is clear to the 
young man that the missing part portrayed his father. Esteban is 
curious.</P>
<P>On his 17th birthday Manuela and her son watch on TV the film "All 
About Eve." Inspired, Esteban titles his notebook "All About my 
Mother."</P>
<P>The two go to the theater. The much-admired Huma Rojo plays Blanche 
in "A Streetcar Named Desire." After the show, as Esteban rushes in 
the rain to get the star's autograph, he gets killed by a car. With 
black irony, Manuela is asked for permission to transplant his heart.</P>
<P>The movie is so rich in characters and episodes that detailing them 
would be a disservice to potential viewers.  Simplifying  the story, 
I will say that Manuela, after an 18-year absence from her native 
Barcelona, returns to find the boy's father, to tell him that he had 
a son, that the son always thought of his father. For the latter, 
also named Esteban, was alive (but not well), and had become Lola.</P>
<P>You have to stay alert to figure out who the characters are, and 
what, including Manuela in her earlier days. Let's just state that 
the milieu in which Manuela will move in Barcelona is one of 
prostitutes, transvestites, transsexuals and other "exceptional" 
cases. Yet it remains an essentially warm and loving circle, partly 
because of a line quoted from "Streetcar," about 'the kindness of 
strangers.'</P>
<P>Coincidences abound in the movie, but do not distract or detract. 
Manuela's quest for Lola starts with a meeting of an old friend, the 
transsexual prostitute Agrado, which roughly translated means "I 
please." This in turn leads to  pretty young nun Rosa, who cares for 
destitute prostitutes. Rosa is the alienated (but not in the usual 
way) child of a mother who paints fake Chagalls, and a father who has 
Alzheimer's or something like that. He's totally out of it.</P>
<P>The plot then adds the presence of the "Streetcar" troupe that is now 
playing in Barcelona; the connections of, first Manuela, then Agrado, 
with the thespians; the lesbian affair between Huma (the name means 
roughly "chainsmoker") and Nina, who plays Stella. Says Huma:" Nina 
is addicted to heroin, I am addicted to Nina." Then comes the 
revelation that Rosa is pregnant (by, guess who? Lola! ) and 
HIV-positive.</P>
<P>This is melodrama --down to the near-miraculous happy ending two 
years later.-- barefaced and proud of it. In American cinema the 
German-born Douglas Sirk was notorious  for his melodramas. Wild and 
woolly Almodovar runs circles around Sirk and such. He is enamored of 
Hollywood melodramatic films (cited among other filmic references) as 
well as Latin American movies of that type. It may sound like a 
penchant for pop culture, but then I remember that the great 
critic-scholar of theater Eric Bentley declared (if my quotation is 
right) that "Melodrama is the essence of theater."</P>
<P>Melodrama with twist after twist, including something that the rich 
American cinema ignores to the point of destruction: literacy and 
culture. Not only film references abound, but literary ones nicely 
worked in: Tennessee Williams, Truman Capote, Boris Vian...</P>
<P>"Mother" is theater of emotions, but it is not judgmental. Nor is it 
"classical" in format. It is shot with Almodovarian avant-garde 
techniques, camera angles and tricks, garishly pleasant colors. 
Almodovar plays a game of Chinese boxes, with film-within-film, 
videos, TV, with symbols within the hyper-realistic context. Think of 
how the transplants, in their own remote way also evoke esthetic 
surgery and transsexual operations.</P>
<P>The word "tolerance" is never spoken but the notion is there, all 
over, not as a plea but as a necessity for life.</P>
<P>What is really surprising is the tolerance of today's Spain vis-a-vis 
subjects that once were taboo. After its Civil War, General Francisco 
Franco ruled the country from 1939 to his death in 1975. Censorship 
and self-censorship reigned in that prudish, conservative nation. In 
the last part of Franco's life, a number of movies appeared which 
--like many Polish films--used on-the-face-of-it politically 
innocuous themes, but in reality had camouflaged sub-texts, 
metaphors, symbols which the savvy audiences understood. Then Spain 
exploded after Franco's demise. I still remember kiosks with 
astounding arrays of "girlie" if not porno magazines. Even so, it 
took Almodovar (who is homosexual) to become the most influential 
agent provocateur in cinema, to the extent that today, a major, 
sexually outspoken film like "Mother" (which was awarded Best 
Director at Cannes 99) is accepted without second thoughts in Spain 
but would have trouble in the United States.</P>
