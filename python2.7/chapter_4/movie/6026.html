<PRE>                             BREATHING LESSONS
                       A film review by Ralph Benner
                        Copyright 1996 Ralph Benner</PRE>
<P>        If Joanne Woodward and James Garner, two of our most ingratiating 
performers, aren't enough to save the Hallmark Hall of Fame version of 
Anne Tyler's BREATHING LESSONS, then no one could. There's something about 
Tyler's work -- this Pulitzer prize winner and THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST -- 
that doesn't translate easily to the screen, and I think it has to do with 
Tyler's temperament as a writer: she loves the quirkiness of ordinary 
lives, and works gallantly via labored cadence to bring to her characters' 
fits, foibles and idiosyncrasies an enriching emotional humanity; she is 
the Little People's champion. Part of the fought-for joy in reading Tyler 
is the supreme confidence of her dialogue -- like when in TOURIST Sarah 
drops the neutrons on Macon, exploding with "You're ossified. You're 
encased. You're like something in a capsule." But it's also this kind of 
revelatory scolding that makes many of us fight extra-hard to get into her 
books: she can be a very chilly experience, a strange mix of Ann Beattie, 
Gail Sheehy's "Passages" and a whole lot of William Inge -- without the 
Freudian sexology. This is what's scary about Tyler's success -- she gets 
acclaim for seeing us as "lovably" muffled, psycho as well as 
sociologically. Tyler once said about the movie version of THE ACCIDENTAL 
TOURIST that there wasn't anything more to get out of it because there 
wasn't anything more to her characters. That's what's troubling about most 
of them -- they're not fleshed out, they're Word Perfect stuffocated, 
oozing with add-ons as seductive filler.  In "On Movies," 
Dwight Macdonald wrote a series of reviews under the chapter title 
"Kazanistan, Ingeland, and Williams, Tenn." If writing today, he'd update 
it to include "Tylerville" because she's got woman problems, too. What may 
be more surprising than anything else is that the literary set hasn't 
discovered that what they praise Tyler for -- her gentle touch, her 
compassion, her "inexhaustible observations" -- conceal what I think is a 
psychologically worrisome, perhaps subconscious dislike: her treatment of 
her female creations. Almost always the central women characters are 
mind-numbing chatterboxes; while steering clear of the monsters Williams 
knew how to breathe fire into -- because it would be unthinkable of her to 
ever allow her ladies to knowingly inflict psyche damage -- she revives 
Inge to a rather uncomfortable degree: they're wired to be "The Lights at 
the Top of the Stairs." We're supposed to see them as life forces beyond 
their everyday ordinariness, that when they touch other lives, they touch 
us. Unlike Tyler's legion of fans and the Pulitzer prize committee, I'm 
not moved, I'm annoyed. How could so many lovers of TOURIST not see that 
Muriel, the angel-catalyst to Macon's renewal, is most probably 
responsible for her son's psychosomatic illnesses? In BREATHING LESSONS we 
get genteel, interfering Maggie trying to get her daughter-in-law and 
granddaughter back into the fold, but not before a myriad of flashbacks 
(cut for the TV version), not before attending a funeral, not before a few 
rather stupid car accidents (the second of which is blessedly altered for 
the film) and not before a few embarrassing roadshow "little people" 
numbers. With some exceptions, Tyler doesn't seem to show affection for 
modern women; she's trapped in a time-warp.</P>
<P>        And no actress these days is more likewise trapped and more 
regularly miscast than Joanne Woodward. She's obviously the first choice 
among women authors to play educated scatterbrains and nincompoops -- her 
Maggie in BREATHING LESSONS, coming a short time after her Vinnie Miner in 
the TNT production of Alison Lurie's Pulitzer prize-winning FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS. Pulitzer prize winning male authors get her too: she did the 
smell-of-rot movie version of Paul Zindel's THE EFFECT OF THE GAMMA RAYS 
ON THE MAN-IN-THE-MOON MARIGOLDS and the highly theatrical TV version of 
Michael Cristofer's THE SHADOW BOX, both directed by Woodward's husband 
Paul Newman. She got stuck in the boo-goo of Inge's COME BACK LITTLE SHEBA 
in a TV adaptation, co-starring a very badly miscast Laurence Olivier. 
Newman directed her in yet another unnecessary remake of William's THE 
GLASS MENARGIE, which hadn't a prayer with that thing called Karen Allen 
as Laura. (I'm trying hard to remember Woodward in a recent or fairly 
recent performance that wasn't pre-"encased" -- her doctor in SYBIL, her 
braless sass in SHADOW BOX, perhaps parts of DO YOU REMEMBER LOVE? Have to 
go back thirty six years to recall a screen performance that really caused 
sparks to fly -- THE LONG HOT SUMMER and a year before that, in her 
memorable THE THREE FACES OF EVE. That's a long time to be idle.) Even 
more than in the remake of Inge's LITTLE SHEBA, Woodward in BREATHING 
LESSONS is Estelle Parsons as Shirley Booth; all the fussy, busy tricks 
and ticks are prefabbed "Hazel." The harder Woodward works at pulling off 
what are essentially unactable scenes, the more disbelieving she gets: 
she's watchable in the worst way -- compulsively. </P>
<P>        Tyler's men seem never to be excessive verbalizers; instead, 
they're the quiet good men who tolerate the super-exasperating nonsense of 
the women in their lives. In BREATHING LESSONS, James Garner is a chronic 
user of Ann Landers-isms -- "Wake up and smell the coffee." More in the TV 
version than the novel, there's a touch of Andy Rooney in Garner; with a 
bad dye job but looking quite fit, he's less picture framer than retired 
newscaster, and he makes it seem absolutely natural to bring out a deck of 
cards in a church and play Solitaire. In thinking it over, BREATHING 
LESSONS is rather like an Andy Rooney essay -- elongated and without the 
humor. But Rooney would never have stood for the fact that, at the end, 
the film makers change Maggie's psychological need for ice cream to 
yogurt. Ira-Rooney would drop a Landers -- "Wake up and taste the fudge 
ripple."  </P>
