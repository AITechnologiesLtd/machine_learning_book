<PRE>Yellow Submarine (1968) 90m</PRE>
<P>One-of-a-kind animated fantasy by the Beatles - well not exactly: they 
contributed the music, but the story and voice acting was done without their 
involvement.  The animated Fab Four are asked to help save Pepperland, a 
musical paradise, from occupation by the music-hating Blue Meanies.  It's a 
magical world, and so can be reached only by magical means, viz. the 
submarine of the title.  Consider the year of the production, the recently 
released 'Sgt Pepper' album's flirtation with the drug culture, and the 
basic concept of a dimension-traveling submarine, and you'll see why the 
"trip" takes up most of the story.  The submarine image dominates the film's 
psychedelic world so comfortably that you may forget that it was originally 
derived from a children's song.  The Beatles may have suspected this 
juvenile treatment for the cartoon early on, which explains why one of their 
songs written specifically for the movie was a children's chant ('All 
Together Now').  While it's great to see animated sequences to classic 
Beatle songs - like prototypical music video clips - it's the newer material 
that synthesizes best with the look that the film-makers were striving for.  
'Only A Northern Song' and 'It's All Too Much' point the way to SUBMARINE's 
potentially wilder side; and while the script throws in 'Lucy in the Sky 
with Diamonds' the rest of the Beatles extant catalogue just doesn't have 
the 'acid' sensibility to promote a complete head trip.</P>
<P>It's probably a good thing, however.  Nothing dates more badly than an era, 
and while YELLOW SUBMARINE is recognizably the product of the late 60s it is 
not dependent on it.  There are the prerequisite acknowledgements to 
flowers, butterflies, and love but this is saturated with so much visual 
innovation and wall-to-wall puns that the entire film could just as easily 
be a contemporary construct paying a postmodern homage to the era (in fact 
YELLOW SUBMARINE has already been emulated in video clips by Michael Jackson 
and Oasis).  The entertainment value of the film is probably unquestionable 
if you're a Beatles fan, or an animation fan, or ideally both.  Children 
raised on cartoon slapstick and rocket-paced visuals may be a little 
bewildered by the film's reliance of wit over action, but it'll do them 
good.  Adults will find more to enjoy in the script's many conundrums and 
wall-to-wall puns, many of which refer to Beatles lyrics.  Film starts to 
wind down near the end - the Chief Blue Meanie gets really tiresome - but at 
least you know it's all bound to finish with a song.  It's a credit to the 
art direction by Heinz Edelmann that this feature has retained its entirely 
distinctive look decades later.  The soundtrack was digitally overhauled on 
the film's 30th anniversary and re-introduced in cinemas to stunning effect 
- now awash in an ocean of huge, crystal-clear sound, SUBMARINE's voyage is 
truly complete.</P>
