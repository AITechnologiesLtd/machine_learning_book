<PRE>                                 LIMBO
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A failing economy and times of stress
          in Alaska take their toll on an ex-fisherman, a
          singer, and her daughter.  John Sayles wrote,
          directed, and edited LIMBO with a good feel for
          dialog and character.  He holds off a long time
          before revealing where the plot is going, leaving
          even the viewer in limbo. Rating: 7 (0 to 10), +2
          (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Limbo is "a place or state of restraint or confinement; an
intermediate or transitional place or state; a state of uncertainty."
The essence of limbo is being between this and that.  Limbo is waiting.
One knows what has passed, but not what is coming.  John Sayles has
constructed LIMBO like a fractal pattern of limbos within limbos.
Alaska is in limbo politically.  And within Alaska the town of Port
Henry is in limbo economically.  And within Port Henry most people are
within a state of limbo in their personal lives.  As the film opens a
major chapter has just ended in the life of Donna De Angelo (played by
Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio).  When the film closes a major chapter in
her life is about to start and there is complete uncertainty as to what
that chapter will hold for her.  The film covers that period of limbo.
It also covers a limbo in the life of Joe Gastineau (David Strathairn),
once a fisherman that he can no longer be and waiting for the next
chapter in his life.</P>
<P>     LIMBO begins with a 1950s travelogue showing what wonderful times
it is in Alaska.  The film has faded, but not as badly as the local
economy.  Hard times have hit in Port Henry, Alaska.  With demand
vanishing for canned salmon the local economy is slowly dying.
Factories are closing one after another.  A few wealthy people plan the
next big thing for Alaska with more enthusiasm than wisdom.  ("Think of
Alaska as one big theme park.")  Within Port Henry people are trapped
between the old and the new.  Their old jobs, mostly in the local
salmon canning plant, are coming to an end.  There may be a future for
Port Henry or there may be just oblivion.</P>
<P>     Donna has for years stayed without commitment with one man and
then another.  In her singing career she does the same.  Currently she
has a not very good job singing in the local saloon.  She has a
troubled daughter, Noelle (Vanessa Martinez), who has seen her father
only twice.  Unknown to her mother, Noelle has a friend and confidante,
Joe Gastineau, and in spite of his much greater age Noelle is starting
to think of him in romantic terms.  Joe used to be a fisherman, but for
his own reasons wants to stay away from the water--not an easy feat in
Alaska.  Donna is sour on all men and barely notices when she meets Joe
that he may in fact be something special.  Still, the two of them build
a relationship.</P>
<P>     For most of the film Sayles lets the story drift along without any
obvious direction.  We just spend time with the three main characters
getting to know them very well.  Noelle is very intelligent but
completely alienated from her mother and is rebelling purely by being
morbid.  The film delves into her relationship with her mother as Donna
and Joe become increasingly serious about each other.  Eventually all
three relationships will be tested by hard realities of survival in the
Alaskan wilderness.</P>
<P>     This is a film that has been wisely cast.  David Strathairn and
Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio are two very fine actors who rarely get the
public attention they deserve.  Certainly they are far more talented
than many actors with much more bankable marquee value are.
Mastrantonio even does her own singing in this film.  Strathairn has
the quiet, likeable stage presence of a Henry Fonda.  Kris
Kristofferson is along with a small role as the bush pilot Smilin'
Jack.</P>
<P>     Sayles's story is an enigma and a curiosity.  It very clearly is
an independent film, because it does some things and goes some places
that are more intelligent than profitable.  Not everyone will be
pleased by some of the decisions that Sayles makes, but on reflection,
it is just those decisions that are the point. I give LIMBO a 7 on the
0 to 10 scale and a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
