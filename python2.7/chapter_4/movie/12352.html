<PRE>WOO
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>     With the mark of true talent, Jada Pinkett Smith, who was Eddie
Murphy's girlfriend in the recent remake of THE NUTTY PROFESSOR,
manages to shine in the otherwise dismal movie WOO.  With her
infectiously happy smile, the beautiful actress has enough spunk and
confidence to rise above the material.  Although not quite enough to
make the movie enjoyable, her performance does give some respite to the
audience, who has to endure every black and male stereotype in the
book.</P>
<P>     As the movie opens, a sexy and mini-skirted Woo (Smith) sashays
down a busy Manhattan sidewalk.  Men left and right trip and fall as
they gawk at her.  She is going to get advice on how to find her Mr.
Right from her transvestite psychic named Celestrial.  As Celestrial, a
performer known as Girlina overacts like the rest of the supporting
cast.</P>
<P>     With only the knowledge of his zodiac sign, Woo sets off to find
her man.  When a blind date named Tim, played by the wholesome-looking
Tommy Davidson from BOOTY CALLS, turns out to have the good fortune to
have been born in the right time frame, she figures she has her man.
After a scene in which Tim practices various come-on lines to arouse
who he thinks will be a reluctant date, she walks into his apartment,
sticks a joint in his mouth and starts taking off his pants.  And this
all happens in the initial two minutes after she first meets him.</P>
<P>     Much of the movie is devoted to Tim's three sexist buddies, played
by Duane Martin, Darrel Heath, and Michael Ralph.  They make catcalls
at every woman they see.  Mixed with their disparaging remarks on the
woman's anatomy, they stick out their tongues to make sexually
provocative gestures.  Think ANIMAL HOUSE on steroids.</P>
<P>     As written by David C. Johnson and directed by Daisy von Scherler
Mayer, the picture, with its heavy slapstick, feels lifted from some
raunchy cable sitcom with a heavy laugh track.  No gesture is too crude
to include and no situation too cliched.  When Tim takes Woo to a fancy
restaurant, you could predict that someone will soon slip and fall
resulting in a big food fight, and you'd be right.  And when Tim tries
to light some incense in his bathroom, you know something will catch on
fire - this time it's the toilet paper roll.</P>
<P>     Although most of the jokes go nowhere, one that does work involves
Tim's prize possession, his car, which is guarded with all kinds of
anti-theft devices. He returns from a nightclub to beep the car open,
only to find that, like the Cheshire cat, all that is left in the
street is a trace - the car's beeper. It still beeps back even the
object it was protecting is gone forever.</P>
<P>     "This is funny; this is funny," Tim tells Woo at one point.  "This
is funny?" she queries.  "What does that mean?"  She doesn't know, and
neither did the makers of this movie.</P>
<P>     WOO runs just 1:25.  It is rated R for profanity and sexual
situations and would be fine for older teenagers.</P>
