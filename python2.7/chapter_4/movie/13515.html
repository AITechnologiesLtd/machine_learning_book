A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Martin Campbell </PRE>
<P>Written by: 
John Eskow, Terry Rossio, and Ted Elliott. The character Zorro first
appeared in Johnston McCulley's serialized 1919 pulp fiction novel THE
CURSE OF THE CAPISTRANO. </P>
<PRE>Starring: 
Anthony Hopkins, Antonio Banderas, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Casey the
stallion</PRE>
<PRE>Ingredients: 
Romance, masked swordsman, old master training young guy to be a
swashbuckling superhero.</PRE>
<P>Synopsis:
The story takes place in 1800s California, then a part of Mexico. A
haggard but aristocratic martial arts master named Don Diego (Anthony
Hopkins) used to be the sly swashbuckling sword fighting superhero named
Zorro ("fox" in Spanish). After 20 years of languishing in an awful
prison the nobleman Don Diego finally escapes only to find out that his
infant daughter Elena, now a beautiful young woman (Catherine
Zeta-Jones), has been raised by his mortal enemy Don Rafael (Stuart
Wilson). Elena wrongly believes that she is Rafael's daughter, when in
fact Rafael murdered Elena's mother, Don Diego's wife.</P>
<P>Realizing that he is too old to destroy Don Rafael alone, Don Diego
trains a young bandit named Alejandro to inherit his superhero legacy
(the mask of Zorro), a job description which entails championing the
poor and sending corrupt colonial aristocrats scurrying fearfully back
to their haciendas with their tails between their legs - - through the
use of superior swordsmanship, horsemanship, and the whip. </P>
<P>Similar to a James Bond movie, Alejandro/Zorro romances the bad guy's
girl, invades the rich guy's party, sneaks into the compound at night to
tangle with guards, gets into a stunt-filled chase (with horses), and
discovers how the bad guy plans to get the gold and take power. THE MASK
OF ZORRO even ends with a pop theme song. The difference is, James Bond
normally discovers the bad guy's master plan after getting captured and
tied up with the heroine, but Alejandro/Zorro does not. Also, James Bond
takes place in modern times, while the setting of THE MASK OF ZORRO is
colonial Mexico.</P>
<P>Will swashbucklers Don Diego and Alejandro save the girl and thwart Don
Rafael's greedy, power-hungry plan?</P>
<P>Opinion:
Zorro is a  character similar to both Robin Hood and Batman. Like Robin
Hood, Zorro champions the oppressed poor in a bygone era ruled by the
greedy rich. Like the popular Batman (or the earlier Scarlet Pimpernel),
Zorro has a secret identity whereby he poses as an affable aristocrat by
day but avenges injustice by night. Laughing at the thrill of danger,
Zorro shames the bad guys by defeating them and scratching big
embarrassing Zs onto their skin with his sword. </P>
<P>When I was a kid, my siblings and I used to play Zorro with kite sticks
all the time. As a Zorro fan from way back, I find THE MASK OF ZORRO
enjoyable because it seamlessly weaves together action, romance, and
drama. Banderas in particular is excellent with the blade. His charm and
skillful swordplay, along with a more awkward slight tendency to slouch
and sideways forward roll, make him completely believable as a
Zorro-in-training. The other characters are good as well, from the sexy
but innocent Zeta-Jones to the elegant but out-of-breath Hopkins as the
paunchy, graying master. Aside from the dashing swordplay, an extra
choreography treat involves a tango-like ballroom sequence between the
dashing Alejandro and a passionate Elena. </P>
<P>In THE MASK OF ZORRO attention to detail can be found in every facet of
the film, from the crisp, flamenco-style music and Spanish guitar, to
the period scenery, and design of the swords. The man responsible for
the excellent sword choreography in THE MASK OF ZORRO is swordsman Bob
Anderson. Anderson, who has been a swordmaster in Hollywood films for 45
years, is the man inside the Darth Vader costume in the STAR WARS movies
sword duels. He was also responsible, as swordmaster, for the exquisite
THE PRINCESS BRIDE and HIGHLANDER battles. Livestock coordinator Corky
Randall should also be commended for the detailed chase scenes and
horsemanship stunts in THE MASK OF ZORRO. </P>
<P>The beginning of THE MASK OF ZORRO and the end of the film are very
exciting. THE MASK OF ZORRO comes very close to being a fantastic,
sweeping epic, but the middle sags slightly because the part where the
good guy stumbles upon the bad guy's master plan seems a bit stretched
out. In the middle - - for all Zorro's climbing around and detective
work - - he finds out that politician Don Rafael's earthshakingly evil
master scheme is to merely to make California an independent country by
purchasing it from Mexico. That doesn't seem like much of an evil idea,
considering that today the state of California's economy is larger than
that of every country in the world but five. So, as far as nefarious
master schemes go, Californian independence is too tame. Only twenty
minutes later, when Don Rafael decides to mercilessly kill off
imprisoned slaves, does the situation get dire enough to propel ZORRO.
This extra time causes the middle to appear stretched. But soon the
action starts back up again. Once the blades start flashing and the
protagonists rush to the rescue, all is well.</P>
