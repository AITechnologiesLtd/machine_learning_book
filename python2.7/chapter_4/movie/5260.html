<P>     BILL & TED MEET HAMLET just as well could have been the title of
ROSENCRANTZ & GUILDENSTERN ARE DEAD, Tom Stoppard's clever film adaptation
of his popular play.  In the original Shakespearean version of the story,
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern were minor characters (childhood chums of
Hamlet), appearing in only a couple scenes.  Stoppard's gimmick is to
retell HAMLET entirely from their point of view.  These two meandering
medieval misfits take center stage, and their verbal banter and petty
squabbles are a nonstop source of amusement.</P>
<P>     Stoppard imaginatively weaves Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's
misadventures into the general HAMLET story line by having them wander in
and out of scenes lifted directly from Shakespeare.  The result is an
inventive mixture of old and new.  Happily, Stoppard's witty script and
assured direction get first rate support from the cast, especially Gary
Oldman, whose droll performance as Rosencrantz is sublimely entertaining.
Oldman and co-star Tim Roth have created two truly exasperating nitwits ...
who also happen to be irresistibly endearing.</P>
