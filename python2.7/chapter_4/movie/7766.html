<P>     Reteamed for the first time since the LETHAL WEAPON sequels, Joe
Pesci and Danny Glover play a pair of New Jersey numbnuts, headed to the
Everglades for their annual pre-Thanksgiving fishing trip.  There, they
promptly lose their car, then their boat, then another boat, etc. etc.
A pair of unfunny opening gags is an early indicator that director
Christopher Cain (THE AMAZING PANDA ADVENTURE, THE NEXT KARATE KID)
can't set up slapstick to save his life.  Pesci and Glover, however,
have an innocent charm that endures when the physical comedy doesn't.
(Much in the same way that Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow anchored the
otherwise awful ROMY AND MICHELLE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION.)  Ok ok ok ok,
you won't split your sides, but you may enjoy the less-frantic moments.
Like when the two stooges are set upon by a smooth-talking salesman at a
boat yard.  Or when they're giving babes the "killer look." With
appearances by Carol Kane (as Pesci's wife!), Louise Fletcher, Rosanna
Arquette, and, in one of the year's most curious cameos, Willie Nelson
as an avenging angel fishing instructor.</P>
