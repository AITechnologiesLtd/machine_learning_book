<P>IN SHORT: An all-singing, all-dancing, all-sensational revamp of a play
first staged in 1596.</P>
<P>As I've written it before, you could put Shakespeare's words through a
meat grinder, add an egg and some bread crumbs, whack it into palatable
little meat loafs and serve with a nice chianti and you still would have
to double over backwards to do serious harm to his stories. That's why
said stories still work four hundred plus years later. It's also a
matter of fact that the full text of his plays can take hours to unfurl,
when orated from the stage (or screen. Rent Kenneth Branagh's uncut
Hamlet if you want to test your endurance levels -- and we liked KB's
version, btw). So here we have Love's Labour's Lost, Branagh's audacious
take on one of Shakespeare's simplest stories; his version owing as much
to vaudeville and the Marx Brothers as it does to certain stylish movies
of the 1930's and 40's.</P>
<P>What Branagh does to Shakespeare is something that is so simple, and
simply outrageous that we hunkered down to an early morning screening
'cuz we had to see his adaptation of Love's Labour's Lost with fresh
eyes. Now, remember that we don't compare to Source Material, not that
our knowledge of Shakespeare extends very far, which allows us to avoid
the purist view which may liken Branagh's take as the first sign of
Armageddon. It's not.</P>
<P>Like Richard III a couple of years back, LLL is set in the World War II
time period, here with France preparing for war. In the neighboring
country of Navarre, the King (Alessandro Nivola) has decided that war is
for sissies and has issued a proclamation that all men of his kingdom;
in this case specifically himself and his three closest courtiers, shall
devote themselves to intellectual study and spiritual enhancement. This
means a full day's fast each week, food every other day, and only three
hours of rest before returning to their study of all things wise and
wonderful.</P>
<P>Oh, one more thing. No women. Not to talk to, to consort with, to wine
and/or dine and/or ... you know ... for three years. Penalties for
breaking their solemn vows include having your tongue ripped out, or
more major stuff. And while, Longaville (Matthew Lillard) and Dumaine
(Adrian Lester) acknowledge their Word of Honor by signing their names
to the Proclamation, Berowne (Kenneth Branagh) hesitates, pointing out
that "the Princess of France is an intelligent woman and you may need to
negotiate treaties with her" (I'm paraphrasing badly), so a lack of
tongue could prove to be a problem. Besides, he sings to the King while
cueing an offscreen orchestra, "I'd Rather Charleston". Yes, sings. The
women will eventually respond (I won't dance. Don't Ask Me) as the men
find themselves smitten by the Princess (Alicia Silverstone) and her
Court (Emily Mortimer, Carmen Ejogo and Natascha McElhone). Love's
Labour's Lost is a randy comedy where the boys must sneakily communicate
with the girls -- their chosen messenger is an illiterate clown named
Costard (Nathan Lane, mixing Harpo Marx and Senor Wences into one
racoon-coated personage) who delivers the right letters to the wrong
people -- which evolves into a bittersweet romance mode as the
inevitable war reaches the border of Navarre.</P>
<P>Until that point, though, the flick is packed with just about every song
worth remembering from any Fred and Ginger movie. The songs by George
and Ira Gershwin, Irving Berlin and Cole Porter, among the best known
names all take the place of pages of dialog that has been excised. All
of 'em, unlike most musicals, fit with their placement and move the
story along. If you're old enough to know what came before rock 'n'
roll, there's not a dud song in the bunch. What remains, according to
the notes, is about 30% of the original play and, frankly, had I not
read that in black and white I wouldn't have known it.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Love's Labour's Lost, he would have
paid...</P>
<PRE>$7.00</PRE>
<PRE>A perfect '30's musical.</PRE>
