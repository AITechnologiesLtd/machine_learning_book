Reviewed June 13, 1999.</P>
<P>There's a long, unfortunate story behind "The Curve." Originally titled "Dead 
Man's Curve," the film premiered at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival, was 
eventually picked up by Trimark Pictures, and the director, Dan Rosen, was 
promised a theatrical release. Time ticked by, its name was changed, and it 
finally ended up bypassing theaters for home video in March, 1999. But 
there's still one more catch: even on video, it is only available at 
Blockbuster (which is where, of course, I rented it), although the DVD is 
available everywhere. Sound strange? I thought so too. </P>
<P>"The Curve" is an inauspicious thriller set at a Maryland college that, like 
1998's dumb comedy, "Dead Man on Campus," takes off from the urban legend 
that if your roommate commits suicide, you automatically receive a 4.0 GPA 
for the semester. Tim (Matthew Lillard) and Chris (Michael Vartan) despise 
their roommate, Rand (Randall Batinkoff), both for his cruel attitude and 
emotionally abusive way he treats his girlfriend, Natalie (Tamara Craig 
Thomas), who has just discovered she is pregnant. When Rand finds out about 
his oncoming child, he explodes, giving Tim and Chris a fairly good chance to 
murder him and make it look like a suicide. Spiking his alcohol with rat 
poison, Rand, sure enough, dies, and Tim eagerly pushes him off a cliff. 
Although Chris does need the 4.0 since he is hoping to be accepted to 
Harvard, he gradually grows with guilt, and it soon becomes apparent that Tim 
may very well be setting him up to take all blame for the murder, even though 
Rand's body has yet to be found. And Chris is even more outraged when he 
finds Tim trying to take advantage of his girlfriend, Emma (Keri Russell).</P>
<P>"The Curve" is a thoroughly despicable mystery-thriller, a film that 
eventually gets so over-to-the-top and convoluted it quickly becomes 
ludicrous. It's the type of movie where you're never quite sure who the 
characters are, or their intentions, until the "shocking" climax. This 
tried-and-true plot device sometimes works ("The Usual Suspects," "Clue: The 
Movie"), but more often than not risks the posssibility of going so far over 
the deep end to completely lose its audience. That is one of the major 
downfalls of "The Curve." As plot twist after plot twist gathers on top of 
each other, up until the very end, I did not feel a sense of shock (even 
though I admittedly didn't see some of it coming), but instead felt simply 
jerked around. It's OK to want to be unpredictable and surprising, but there 
comes a point when the shocks stop becoming effective and turn into a great 
annoyance.</P>
<P>The characters in "The Curve" are rarely who they say they are, but some of 
the performances are adequate enough. Matthew Lillard doesn't do as much of 
his usual comedic schtick as usual, but also does not turn in nearly as 
impressive a performance as in "SLC Punk!" Michael Vartan ("Never Been 
Kissed") is the only actual character that is successfully developed beyond 
merely being a pawn to the plotting, and is believable as a young man who is 
desperate to get into Harvard, but not enough to want to turn to murder. Keri 
Russell (TV's "Felicity") is fine as Vartan's grilfriend, but her 
thought-to-be intelligent character makes a u-turn at the midway point and 
becomes nothing more than a floozy. Randall Batinkoff does nothing with his 
villainous character of Rand, but it isn't entirely his fault since the 
screenplay only calls for him to be a one-dimensional jerk. None of the other 
performances make any impression, with the only other central character, 
played by Tamara Craig Thomas, a passive "object" who takes the abuse from 
Rand and does nothing about it. Sure, there are people like this in the real 
world, but writer-director Dan Rosen should have written at least one of his 
female characters to be a strong individual.</P>
<P>Ultimately, "The Curve" is so concerned about its plot that it doesn't pay 
much attention at all to its characters, and therefore, the film only comes 
off feeling even more empty-headed. I enjoy a good thriller as much as the 
next person, but this film is ridiculous and often even inane. Rosen has made 
a technically pleasing independent film, with competent cinematography and a 
memorable music score. It's too bad his film was treated so neglectfully by 
its studio and sent straight-to-video, but after seeing it for myself, I 
honestly blame them for only one thing: picking up the film's distribution 
rights in the first place.</P>
