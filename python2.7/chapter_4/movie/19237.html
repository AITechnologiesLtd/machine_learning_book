<P>Hollywood has been buzzing about American Pie for months, with early
rumors comparing it with There's Something About Mary and claiming that
it "pushes the envelope" with regard to outrageousness. They were wrong.
It doesn't push the envelope: it throws the envelope at you, and damned
if it doesn't work.
This is unquestionably a teen film but the plot is enough to make
parents wince: a group of high school seniors make a pact that each of
them will lose their virginity by graduation time in order to avoid
potential embarassment in college. There's barely a few weeks left and
for most of them it looks like prom night is their last hope. Each of
them tries to devise their own plan to reach their goal, and some of
those plans have unexpected consequences.</P>
<P>Of course there has to be some experimentation before they get to the
real thing, so one of the protagonists asks "what third base feels
like," and the response he gets is "like sweet warm, apple pie." When he
comes home and finds a delicious looking apple pie on the kitchen table,
what happens is anyone's guess. In another, equally gross scene, another
one of the characters "inherits" a sex bible, made by high school
seniors for high school seniors and passed down each year to another
deserving candidate. He learns something new to try on his girlfriend
called "The Tongue Tornado", which I won't (and can't) describe here.</P>
<P>First time director Chris Weitz (who co-wrote the film with brother Paul
Weitz, the two also wrote Antz, one of last year's best films) first
throws every trick in the book at you, then he throws the book and then
starts hurling random objects (including that envelope I mentioned
earlier) at the speed of a very large rabbit on steroids. He invariably
gets the audience hooting, applauding and -- oh yeah -- laughing their
hearts out. His jokes are disgusting and juvenile but also hilarious,
even though we're not often proud of what we're laughing at. That, too,
can be taken as a virtue: it takes talent to make us laugh at something
we find vulgar, profane and gross.</P>
<P>The acting is of no importance in a movie like this, but what is present
here is more than passable. Newcomer Jason Biggs is palatably insecure
in what is probably the most significant role in the movie. Natasha
Lyonne (whom we first saw in Slums of Beverly Hills) is delightful in a
disappointingly minor role.</P>
<P>I'm not quite sure that I like the ending of American Pie. It's
needlessly shallow, and I predict that Conservative activist groups will
never let the filmmakers hear the end of it. But despite the movie's
eventual fallacy, there is no ignoring its merits. It's a hilarious,
affectionate look at teenagers' obsession with sex. While it's not
exactly substantial and thematically sound, it'll sure as hell do.</P>
<P>What we have here is one of the rudest and crudest films I've seen this
side of Pink Flamingoes. What we have here is one of the funniest films
I've seen this side of the Austin Powers franchise and some of Mel
Brooks' work. What we have here is a rollicking comic delight, an eye-
popping gross out and a terrific summer film.
