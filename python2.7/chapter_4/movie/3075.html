<PRE>                        INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  Anne Rice adapts her own sensual
     vampire novel to the screen in a lush and languorous
     adaptation.  The film features an amazing acting job by
     Kirsten Dunst and one nearly as good by Tom Cruise.  The
     pacing is slow with a touch of Tennessee Williams tone,
     the photography is beautiful.  Overall a fine adaptation
     of the novel.  Rating: +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     It seems a natural to write a vampire story from the point of view
of the vampire and to really explore what it must be like to be a
vampire.  It must have been done in pulp fiction, though I am not
specifically aware of any such story.  Fred Saberhagen tried it in 1975
with THE DRACULA TAPE.  But the idea became a sensation with 1976's
INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE by Anne Rice.  This smoky, sensual novel of
the relationship between the new vampire Louis and the sublimely amoral
Vampire Lestat struck a responsive chord with readers.  Since then Rice
has become second only to Bram Stoker for popularity of her vampire
fiction.</P>
<P>     Neil Jordan has directed the new film version of INTERVIEW WITH
THE VAMPIRE.  At first look, it seems a long stretch from his popular
MONA LISA and THE CRYING GAME.  In fact, viewers who like this film
should also see his earlier COMPANY OF WOLVES and vice versa.  Each is
a unique, dreamlike, and Freudean exploration of the supernatural.
That film was a very creative retelling of Little Red Riding Hood as a
sort of sexual werewolf story.  The two films should almost be seen as
a pair.</P>
<P>     The story begins in 1791 as Louis (played by Brad Pitt) is a
plantation owner who has lost his family and thinks he has nothing left
to live for.  What he gets is not death but instead is undeath, the
gift--if "gift" is the right word--of the Vampire Lestat (Tom Cruise).
The two take up living together--if "living" is the right word--on
Louis's plantation as Lestat helps Louis through the hardest transition
of his life--if "life" ... well, you get the idea.  Much of the story
is just how Louis adapts to his new state.  Eventually Louis is fed up
Lestat's indiscriminate killing of humans.  He would leave, but Lestat
binds him by making the eleven-year-old Claudia a vampire and the third
member of the family.  Now Claudia will forever have the body of a
child--well, a child with an impervious body and sharp teeth--while her
mind matures to that of an adult.</P>
<P>     The pacing Anne Rice's story, fairly faithfully rendered since
Rice herself scripted, is paradoxically both slow and fast.  Years seem
to go by very quickly to immortals who never change.   But the story
has an almost Tennessee Williams feel of characters working out deep
emotional problems.  (Williams, incidentally, started out in the horror
genre himself.  Some of his plays, like SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER, still
show the hand of the horror writer.  This film may well represent the
sort of thing he might have written had he continued.)  The story give
us a sensory portrait of how the world is different for the Undead.
Much of the film is just concerned introspectively with the condition
of being a vampire and with the inter-relationships of the vampires.
Lestat accepts his condition and happily goes about the business of
killing.  Louis is more moral and detests his parasitic inclinations.
Claudia is torn between the ways of the two.  This is not to say that
the entire film is cerebral.  There certainly is some action and the
plot does advance.  But Jordan intentionally makes plot second to
style.  His story is told with dramatic visual style which takes full
advantage of moody settings in New Orleans and Paris.  The photography
is by Philippe Rousselot, who is known for atmospheric pieces like
DIVA, HENRY & JUNE, and SOMMERSBY.</P>
<P>     As far as to acting, I would say honors to all, but  the most
amazing acting award goes to Kirsten Dunst as Claudia.  Anna Paquin won
an Oscar for far less interesting acting in THE PIANO.  I do not know
the age of Dunst, but she has to play all the emotions of an adult
woman in the body of an eleven-year-old.  It sounds like an impossible
casting job.  Amazingly, Dunst has an adult's acting talent while she
still looks the part of a child.  I would not surprised if we end up
hearing a lot of her in the years to come.  Of course there was the
whole brouhaha over Tom Cruise in the role of Lestat.  Rice was at
first very vocal against the casting choice, then later claims to have
said that she liked Cruise in the role.  I went through the same set of
emotions.  This is a major departure for Cruise and he plays Lestat
with just the right air of flippancy.  It is hard to understand how
anyone saw it initially, but Cruise is just about perfect for Lestat.
Brad Pitt as Louis is fine, as the sometimes bewildered and sometimes
vengeful, but always well-intentioned vampire who at least nominally
the main character.  In smaller roles we have Christian Slater, Stephen
Rea (who was also in Jordan's CRYING GAME) and Antonio Banderas.
Whatever faults the film has, it is not in the acting.</P>
<P>     Neil Jordan seems to make one good film after another on the theme
of the sub-culture of people who live outside normal society.  As his
films go, this is not one of his best efforts.  But as far as an
exploration of the world of the undead, Anne Rice has nothing to
complain about.  This film get a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
