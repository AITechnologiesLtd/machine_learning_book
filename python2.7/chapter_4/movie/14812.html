<P>  Remember that song from Pal Joey, "I'm wild again/
Beguiled again/ A whimpering, simpering child again, /
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I"?  Director Griffin
Dunne probably does and so do the scripters of his movie
"Practical Magic," but in ways they may not entirely relish. 
The lead performers are bewitched, but the audience are just
bothered and bewildered.  "Practical Magic," adapted by
Robin Swicord from a novel by Alice Hoffman, is a Halloween
movie with amorous themes but is such a hodgepodge that it
serves as neither an effective, Charles-Addams-style spoof of
the supernatural genre nor a convincing romantic comedy. 
The story centers on a family of witches who have difficulties
both in falling in love and in keeping the objects of their
affection happy or even alive.  What emerges is a vehicle for
the talents of Sandra Bullock as the quieter witch and Nicole
Kidman as her more aggressive sister in a film that will
probably be called by detractors and supporters alike a "chick
flick."  While men play a role, two are portrayed in
cartoonishly undeveloped ways: a simpleton and a homicidal
maniac are the caricatures while a third, an earnest detective,
is found to have unexplained and similarly underdeveloped
mystical authority of his own.</P>
<P>   The story opens in a promising way, as a group of Puritans
gather around the figure of a 17th century woman on the
gallows about to be hanged as a witch.  She magically
escapes the perils of the rope, but when her lover fails to
meet her as promised, she pronounces a curse on all males
who enter into the romantic circle of the family for generations
to come.  Two twentieth century progeny, Aunt Jet (Dianne
Wiest) and Aunt Frances (Stockard Channing) are intent on
passing the gift of practical magic to their nieces, Sally Owens
(Sandra Bullock) and Sally's sister Gillian (Nicole Kidman).
The devil-may-care Gillian embraces the incantations while
Sally rejects the prerogatives fearing that she will never meet
the man of her dreams.  Gillian, basking in her pull over men,
embraces an evil drifter, Jimmy (Goran Visnjic), who turns out
to be a homicidal woman-beater and whose domineering
behavior leads to a fearful crime bringing in police detective
Gary Hallet (Aidan Quinn).</P>
<P>   Blandly portraying the abuse the women take from the
townspeople who rightly suspect them of being different from
them (i.e. witches), director Dunne attempts to infuse the story
with comic moments which simply fall flat.  A regular meeting
of the women who are provincial enough to feel great
excitement over their place on a figurative tree is prosaic,
while a concluding scene featuring a band of women dressed
in the black Halloween garb of sorcerers floating from the
rooftop to the earth is unimaginative.  The exorcism spectacle,
in which a company of the town's women cast their spells on
the writhing Gillian to wrest a dead man's spirit from her body
puts the special effects team to work with little consequence. 
Nor do we thrill to see the ghostly body of the corpse
complete with vampiric contact lenses, an image that
filmmakers persist in using in movies about the bloodsuckers.</P>
<P>   Sandra Bullock has a fan club but in my mind is neither
particularly appealing nor a great performer.  She is
outclassed by the more fiery and alluring Nicole Kidman but
their roles in this film are so foolish and ineffectual that they'll
have to use quite a bit more practical magic to enchant an
audience.</P>
