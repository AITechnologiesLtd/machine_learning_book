<PRE>                           MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1993 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>                From Branagh and his wife comes MUCH ADO,
                The Shakespeare comedy of love and tricks.
                Just sit and see the pleasant Tuscan view
                As folks play out romantic politics.</PRE>
<PRE>                Keanu Reeves seems vaguely out of place,
                And Washington is not the usual hue
                Don Pedro has been cast.  But give some space
                To Branagh while he does his MUCH ADO.</PRE>
<PRE>                With Branagh's hand this seems a modern play;
                The pace is fast and Shakespeare pleases much.
                His comedy still works for us today,
                Uneven though it is with Keaton's touch.</PRE>
<PRE>                In short I'd say this Branagh MUCH ADO
                To no surprise doth earn a high +2.</PRE>
