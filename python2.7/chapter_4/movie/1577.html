                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>120 min., R, Comedy/Action, 1992
Director: Richard Donner
Cast: Danny Glover, Mel Gibson, Joe Pesci, Rene Russo, Stuart Wilson</P>
<P>     Danny Glover and Mel Gibson are back (unfortunately Glover's cat
and Gibson's dog aren't for some unexplained reason).  Glover is going
to be retiring soon, and doesn't want to mess anything up.  The two come
across a case that is being hidden by Internal Affairs.  They join with
Gibson's female equivalent, Russo, from Internal Affairs, to catch a cop
killer.</P>
<P>     LETHAL WEAPON 3, although it is not as good as LETHAL WEAPON or
LETHAL WEAPON 2, is fun to watch, although it has little substance.  I
recommend this film to fans of the LETHAL WEAPON series.  I don't think
that you will be disappointed.  On a scale of zero to five, I give
LETHAL WEAPON 3 a four.  LETHAL WEAPON 3 is rated R for explicit
language, adult situations, and violence.</P>
<P>     LETHAL WEAPON 3 will soon be coming to video, and most likely that
is the only way left to see it.  This is one of those films that will be
most spectacular on the big screen, so if you have a chance to see it
in the theater, it is worth it.  The story isn't as well written as in
the first two, but Gibson and Glover have enough charm to carry the film
with no problem.</P>
<P>     One thing that I didn't like very much was Pesci's annoying
character, which worked in the second film, but didn't work as well
here.  I think that the film is just using his current star power to
bring more people to see the film.  Not much was gained by his character
(although he did have some great moments) and somebody else probably
could have carried the role.</P>
<P>     The way this series is going, I don't think that there will be a
LETHAL WEAPON 4 (but they may surprise me).  There is a lot more drama
mixed in with the action, and a little less comedy.   There is a heavy
anti-gang message through the film.  The beginning title was creatively
done and I liked it.   Unfortunately, those who end up seeing the film
on video (when it comes out) will miss the full impact of it.</P>
<P>     One new addition to the film was Rene Russo, who acted off Mel
Gibson perfectly.  A lot of the comedy comes from this pair.   Glover's
retiring jokes began to get tiring by the end of the film and I think
that 1/3 of them should have been edited out of the film.  The Mel
Gibson and Danny Glover combination works out great.</P>
