<P>   "Shaft" was the subject of a debate in the Online Film
Critics Society forum that brought almost a record number of
responses.  A white male who is, I suspect, of a liberal
persuasion, wondered, "What is John Singleton aiming for
with his update of the lowly (by my standards) 'Shaft'? And
why would a black filmmaker want to reinvigorate the
blaxploitation genre, when it was clearly not a highpoint for
African-American cinema?  In my opinion, Singleton should
keep on doing what he does best.  Making truthful films about
real African-American life."</P>
<P>   The liberal was skewered by a white woman whose politics
I is further to the left.  "You shouldn't be so hasty to
take social entities out of context.  Blaxploitation may not be
high art, but it was groundbreaking as far as African
American cinema goes.  Just ask any African-American who
was around at the time when 'Shaft' came out.  After decades
of enduring movies in which blacks were ridiculed and
dehumanized--experiences which they have described as
making them leave the theaters in shame, self-hatred and
embarrassment--they finally had their own cinema.  And their
own heroes who prevailed against white racism.  Singleton
likely became involved in this project to honor and pay
homage to his own racially visionary roots."</P>
<P>   To which a third member responded, "I myself am black,
and I don't think blaxploitation is a low point, au contraire. 
These are cool movies, dammit!  Is there a cooler, badder
actress in movies than Pam Grier, black or not? 
Blaxploitation is not about art, quality filmmaking or depth, it's
about music, clothes and attitude!  As movies, films like
Dolemite or Superfly are mediocre at best, but man are these
dudes electrifying!  I for one am looking forward to seeing the
new 'Shaft,' with  Sam 'my middle name is attitude'
Jackson."</P>
<P>   Watch "Shaft" and see the first speaker's faux-PC attitude
go up in smoke.  Sure, there's a market for movies about "the
way black people really live today," but there's nothing
negative about so-called blaxploitation flicks. With Samuel L.
Jackson in the most charismatic good-guy role of this year,
"Shaft" is director/co-writer John Singleton's resoundingly
imaginative reinvention of the 1971 heavy sex-and-violence
groundbreaker, which featured Richard Roundtree in the title
role as Shaft.</P>
<P>   Now, three decades later, Mr. Attitude returns, this time
taking advantage of some of the cinematic tricks learned
since the original.  Happily, Singleton restrains himself on the
f/x, providing Shaft with only a single obviously faked image
as he announces his resignation from the sluggish justice
establishment by flinging his badge at the judge--who had just
provided absurdly low bail for a rich preppie accused of
homicide.</P>
<P>   As sleek as "Mission Impossible 2" but a lot more fun,
"Shaft" opens on a note of high adrenaline as we are
introduced to the larger-than-life hero against the background
of Isaac Hayes's winning theme song, knocked out in much
the style it was tendered in the seventies.  Shaft is on the
scene during an investigation into the sudden beating death
of a black man (Mekhi Phifer) and, through flashbacks
provided from the man's girl friend we learn that preppie
Walter Wade Jr. ("American Psycho"'s remarkable Christian
Bale) had provoked the guy by making racist remarks
astoundingly unsubtle considering Wade's class and
education.  Shaft busts the perp, whose first utterance to the
cop is "Do you know who my father is?" to which Shaft
responds, "No...do you?"  Much of the story's script follows
witty, easy-to-catch bon mots on this level, which is just part
of the fun in store for the audience.</P>
<P>   The movie moves along at a staggering pace that if a
Thesaurus posited an antonym for "Waiting for Godot," this
would be the choice.  Not only is the writing first-rate for the
genre, evoking predictably frequent merriment from its
audience, the tempo brisk, the outdoor scenes taken in
Brooklyn by photographer Donald E. Thorin authentic in look,
but most important the performances joyfully elicited from
Jackson, from Christian Bale, and especially from the
multi-talented dancer and stage actor Jeffrey Wright as a
comically vicious villain are right on the money.</P>
<P>   Singleton draws solid work from an ensemble representing
every shade of human personality, from the corrupt cops-on-
the-take Jack Roselli (Dan Hedaya) and Jimmy Groves
(Ruben Santiago-Hudson), determined to gun Shaft down and
get their hands on some big bucks; from the affable but
ditzy Rasaan (Busta Rhymes) who is there for Shaft when his
driving skills are needed; and from the Vanessa Williams in
the relatively bland role of narcotics officer Carmen.</P>
<P>   Gratifying as Samuel L. Jackson is, decked out in a long
leather jacket that virtually announces his wiseass attitude,
even more so are the performances of Christian Bale as
Walter Wade Jr. and especially Jeffrey Wright as Peoples
Hernandez.  Wright performs as the feudal lord of his mostly
Puerto Rican neighborhood who in one of the movie's
precious scenes tries to persuade the equally tough and wily
Wade to line up some upscale white customers for his heroin
trade through his connections and even to hang out with him
in the posh neighborhoods and restaurants of Manhattan's
Upper East Side.  Peoples Hernandez has got to be
"American Psycho"'s Patrick Bateman's major competitor for
most complex and absorbing villain of the year as he shows
various sides to his personality: his intense love for his
mowed-down brother which leads him masochistically to
inflict knife wounds on himself, his attention to an infant in his
arms in his downscale, ramshackle apartment, his negotiating
almost coyly with the preppie to give him access to the "best
people" on the Upper East Side, and flat-out rage against
Shaft against whom he ultimately focuses his vast energy.</P>
<P>   While the cell phones and street gang attire remind us that
the setting is contemporary, hip moviegoers will recognize a
70s cop-movie style to the production, which is backed up by
a dynamic, funky soundtrack.  Though a summer movie, this
"Shaft" is blessed by a marriage of all the elements that
make the genre fun: witty script, charismatic acting by the
good guys and knaves alike, superlative lensing, and a pace
that virtually dares any in the audience to fidget just once in
their seats.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running time: 98 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
