<P>     This is not a date movie, especially if it's a first date.  Oh, it
will give you an endless source of conversational topics, all right,
but WHAT HAPPENED WAS... is almost guaranteed to warp your view of the
entire experience.  The Samuel Goldwyn Company is advertising this as
"an adventure in romance."  More often, however, it feels like some
sort of insidious means of torture.</P>
<P>     The intense feeling of discomfort generated by WHAT HAPPENS
WAS...  is the result of the movie's careful attention to detail.
Everything seems true-to-life, distorted only slightly by Noonan's use
of camera angles and lighting.  The conversation is frequently
interrupted by awkward pauses and the two principals are constantly on
edge, each of them trying to come up with words to fill the aching void
between them.</P>
<P>     Based on Noonan's stage play, this two-person film is a simple
character study that finds its dynamics through the interplay of a very
unpleasant first date.  Jackie (Karen Sillas) and Michael (Tom Noonan)
know each other from the office, but on a personal level, they discover
that they're both basically clueless.  Jackie's image of Michael is far
from the reality, and Michael doesn't even recognize Jackie's
attraction to him.  In that sense, this is a true "blind" date.</P>
<P>     Noonan, who has made a career out of playing the bad guy (LAST
ACTION HERO, MANHUNTER), goes against type with Michael, a
meek-as-they- come paralegal.  Karen Sillas is great as Jackie, a
lonely executive assistant (or, in Michael's words, "Is that what
they're calling secretaries these days?") who is made to appear
slightly menacing as a result of Noonan's choice of lighting.  (Is he
perhaps mocking the FATAL ATTRACTION syndrome?)</P>
<P>     At the start of WHAT HAPPENED WAS..., Michael's character is the
most interesting.  He's smart, witty, and seems to have it all
together.  His opposite, on the other hand, is nervous, flustered, and
indecisive.  During the course of the film, however, a role-reversal
takes place causing our attention to shift more and more towards Jackie
as the layers of her personality are peeled back, onion-like.  The
psychological revelations about these two, and the manner in which they
are uncovered, illustrates a willingness on Noonan's part to take his
story in a refreshingly unorthodox direction.</P>
<P>     The key sequence in the film involves Jackie opening up through a
disturbing "children's story" that she reads to Michael.  It's here
that the audience starts to see the genuine people behind the
carefully constructed, socially acceptable masks.  All sorts of
unsettling things happen during this scene, and the overall tone
undergoes a palpable shift from offbeat comedy to drama.  Nervous or
not, the laughter is over.  Circumstances have become a little too
poignant.</P>
<P>     WHAT HAPPENED WAS... is a talky film, but the dialogue is scripted
with an ear for how people really speak.  Ordinary actions take on
extraordinary significance with nearly one-third of the film spent at
the dinner table.  Later, the pair retires to the living room where
Michael sits nervously in a chair while Jackie strikes a pose designed
to seduce him.</P>
<P>     For something billed as a lightweight romantic comedy, WHAT
HAPPENED WAS... wades through some surprisingly deep waters.  There's
an ending, but no conclusion, and the most obvious unanswered question
has more to do with what is yet to come than with what has already
happened.</P>
