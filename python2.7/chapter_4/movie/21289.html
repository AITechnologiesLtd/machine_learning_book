<P>IN SHORT: A great film. Like nothing you've ever seen, or even conceived
in your wildest film fantasy dreams. . .</P>
<P>Unless you dream of Cameron Diaz as a plain Jane, frizzy haired brunette
who is bound, gagged and locked in a cage with a diaper wearing,
psychologically damaged chimpanzee named Elijah while her puppeteer
husband inhabits John Malkovich's head as said actor has sex with said
husband's business partner and lust object. . .</P>
<P>Way beyond anything conceivable, right? Once again the pairing of a
first time screen writer (Charlie Kaufman) and first time big screen
director (Spike Jonze) have floored this critic. Being John Malkovich
works so brilliantly that every outlandish gag or situation makes
perfect sense. The hard part for me is figuring out how much to tell you
without a) spilling too much and b) sounding like I'm out of my mind for
recommending something that sounds insane.</P>
<P>>From the opening titles, in which you see puppets manipulated in ways
that are physically beautiful and poetic, to the matter of fact
introduction of a building with a 7&frac12;th floor and beyond, almost
every scene in Being John Malkovich pushes the envelope in how it tells
its story. Jonze, best known as a video director, doesn't let his vid
chops get in the way of telling the story. Kaufman manages story
elements that are so disparate that you never figure out how they relate
to each other until it's too late.</P>
<P>We start with puppeteer Craig "not based even remotely on anyone in
Cranky's birth family <g>", Schwartz (John Cusack), who demonstrates
notable chops with his string-ed creations. Problem is, his puppet plays
use themes that are classic and very adult and, well, parents are more
likely to pop him one in the mouth than put coins in his beggars bucket.
The breadwinning part of this basement apartment inhabiting pair is
Lottie (Cameron Diaz) who works in a pet shop and provides tender loving
care to the wounded, traumatized and otherwise deficient animals she
brings home. Needing cold hard cash, Craig takes a job as a file clerk
in the LesterCorp office on the 7 ½ th floor of Manhattan's
Mertin-Flemmer office building.</P>
<P>There's a very funny joke hidden in that last piece sentence, made even
funnier in the film as Kaufman's script makes no effort to milk it for
all it is worth. Most of the jokes and absurdities in Being John
Malkovich are laid out in a matter of fact style that, if you go with
the proverbial flow, you'll find yourself sucked into the hilarity of it
all.</P>
<P>That needs more explanation: One day at work, Craig drops a file behind
some cabinets. After moving them, he discovers a boarded up doorway in
the wall, with a tunnel on the other side of it. The tunnel, gooey messy
thing that it is, transports Craig into the mind of John Malkovich,
actor, 2 time Academy Award™ nominee and so on and so forth. After about
fifteen minutes of FirstPersonPOV, Craig gets ejected from JM's head and
dumped on the side of a highway in New Jersey.</P>
<P>Lust Object Maxine (Catherine Wheeler), who is attractive to both men
and women and knows it, also works on 7 ½ . Craig, smitten, reveals the
existence of the "portal". Maxine writes up a business plan, getting
real folks to pay $200 a pop for the opportunity to experience life from
the first person point of view of Malkovich. The money comes rolling in.
Maxine also seduces the real victim, Malkovich who, when he gets wind of
the scheme, goes headfirst down the tunnel. What John Malkovich sees
while "being" John Malkovitch is so blisteringly funny that . . . well,
that's all you need to know. The movie still has an hour to go, with a
pair of love triangles yet to come. It gets better all the way to the
end.</P>
<P>Outstanding in supporting roles are Mary Kay Place as LesterCorp's
receptionist, who suffers from what can only be called dyslexia of the
ear and Orson Bean as her horny as hell, 105 year old boss. [The first
words out of Bean's mouth when he sat for CrankyCritic® StarTalk were
"betcha thought I was dead!" -- click for more with Bean, Malkovich,
Cusack, Diaz (and the rest...)<LINK HERE>]. Across the board,
performance and script and direction are all noteworthy</P>
<P>The next time Barry Diller buys a down on its luck company, Cranky's
gonna buy stock. USA Films hasn't had a major dud yet, and it's getting
so bad their publicists are laughing at me when I come calling, saying
"You're not so Cranky!" I hate that . . .</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Being John Malkovich, he would have
paid...</P>
<PRE>$7.75</PRE>
<P>Oscar nomination level. Yeah, you'll be seeing this level as we get
closer and closer to statue time. We rarely see one film a year that
sets a new high mark or, to use a cliche, breaks the mold. Being John
Malkovich is the second of this year. Unlike "Run Lola Run," no
subtitles are required.</P>
