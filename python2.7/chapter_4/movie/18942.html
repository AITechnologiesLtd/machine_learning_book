THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: *** (out of ****)
Paramount / 2:00 / 1999 / R (sexual perversity, rape, glimpses of nudity,
violence, language)
Cast: John Travolta; Madeleine Stowe; James Cromwell; Timothy Hutton;
Clarence Williams III; James Woods; Rick Dial; Leslie Stefanson 
Director: Simon West 
Screenplay: Christopher Bertolini; William Goldman<HR>"The General's Daughter" garners its stripes for passionate performances,
a gold star for slick suspense and a medal of honor for the highly
intriguing, relatively tasteful portrayal of a scenario that would seem to
drip with pulpy sleaze. Also earned is a demerit or two for a notably
sluggish beginning and an anti-climactic finale, but even these
bewildering bookends aren't enough to get an otherwise gripping military
murder mystery a dishonorable discharge from theaters. </P>
<P>An occasionally seedy, always adult-oriented agenda is announced the
precise moment "Daughter"'s ball gets rolling, following an unnecessarily
lengthy intro that allows viewers to meet and greet John Travolta in
another sterling dramatic turn. He plays top warrant officer Paul Brenner,
assigned by the army's Criminal Investigation Division to sort through
some sticky business involving an arms buyer on a Georgia base. During his
stay there, the general's daughter (Leslie Stefanson), a captain herself,
turns up dead -- and naked, spread-eagle, tent-staked to the ground and
apparently sexually assaulted. You can probably wager a guess as to
whether or not this movie is your cup of tea already. </P>
<P>To help him look for leads, Brenner gets paired with a rape specialist
(Madeleine Stowe) with whom he shares a romantic history. The resulting
rekindled-relationship subplot takes up less time than initially
suspected, but still feels tacked-on -- especially while rushing to a
happy resolution over the closing credits. Perhaps it stems from a need to
make sure viewers exit "The General's Daughter" reassured that the world
ain't such a bad place after all, because the material that constitutes a
majority of the preceding two hours certainly suggests the opposite. It's
a monstrously depressing story, really. </P>
<P>Our protagonists' sleuthing unearths a slew of unsavory revelations from
the victim's past, as well as many shady supporting types. James Woods
clashes masterfully with Travolta as the deceased's enigmatic mentor,
their scenes more explosive than those that contain actual firearms.
Ex-"Mod Squad"-er Clarence Williams III is weird and sweaty as a colonel
intensely loyal to his superiors. Even the notion that the girl's
decorated father (James Cromwell) isn't beyond suspicion won't be news to
fans of the twisty genre. But unsettling shocks are delivered in the
ultimate disclosures of this supremely unusual parent-child bond -- and
it's probably not what you're thinking. </P>
<P>Sure, "The General's Daughter" is messy in ways most thrillers are: logic
holes, ill-used actors (here, the horribly underrated Timothy Hutton as a
helpful MP) and a weak send-off that botches the actual perp's identity
and motive. But the movie still resonates strongly, particularly the
potent posthumous development of the title character and the solid acting
from Travolta, Woods and Stowe. Stowe overcomes her female-tagalong role
by commanding one of Daughter's most attention-capturing moments: her
shrewd locker-room grilling of a cadet who's concealing important
case-related secrets. </P>
<P>Director Simon West cut his teeth on 1997's "Con Air," a
testosterone-heavy Simpson-Bruckheimer actioner, and brings similar
stylized visuals to "The General's Daughter" -- meaning that chopper
blades spin in glorious slow-motion and nary an edit lasts longer than 10
seconds. This odd choice pays off, making edgier scenes seem less
exploitative. But why does West plop a statistic over the ending
fade-to-black that estimates the number of women in the armed forces at an
empowering high? Uh, if "Daughter" was supposed to inspire females to be
all they can be, it needs major rewrite.<HR> 1999 Jamie Peck

"Here it is at last, the first 150-minute trailer. Armageddon' is cut
together like its own highlights. Take almost any 30 seconds at random,
and you'd have a TV ad. The movie is an assault on the eyes, the ears, the
brain, common sense and the human desire to be entertained. No matter what
they're charging to get in, it's worth more to get out." Roger Ebert on
"Armageddon"</P>
