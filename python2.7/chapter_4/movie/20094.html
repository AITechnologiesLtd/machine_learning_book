<P>LISBON STORY (director/writer: Wim Wenders; cinematographer: Liza
Rinzler; cast: Rudiger Vogler (Phillip Winter), Patrick Bauchau
(Friedrich Monroe), Vasco Sequeira (Truck Driver), Teresa Salgueiro
(herself), Manoel de Oliveira (himself), 1994-Ger/Port)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Phillip Winter (Vogler) plays a soundman who travels by car to Lisbon to
work on a silent film of the director Friedrich Monroe (Bauchau).
Because of car problems he arrives late and Monroe can't be found.
Phillip takes it on himself to continue working on the film, while
falling in love with a sensual singer (Teresa), who is the lead singer
for the group Madredeus. He then goes touring Lisbon with some of the
kids working on Monroe's film. The kids fool around with their cameras,
taking pictures of everything that catches their fancy, as he starts
putting together the director's unfinished work, while he makes himself
at home in the director's unique apartment. While Winter is cruising
Lisbon in search of sounds to match Friedrich's abandoned images, the
film creates the urban portrait of Lisbon that he believes Monroe's film
calls for.</P>
<P>One thing becomes apparent, Wenders has very little feel for comedy, all
his efforts to evoke Buster Keaton type comedic skits fall flat. The
film rambles pointlessly on-- and when he catches up with Bauchau, these
scenes of dialogue get pretentious, as if they were trying to say
something heavy about images and the making of movies, but are really
saying very little.</P>
<P>What was praiseworthy about the film, was the singer, Teresa Salgueiro
(herself), and the moody songs she sang, she reminded me of a Greek
rebetika singer, singing her heart out. The sensual Portuguese sound of
a musical group called Madredeus, becomes the crux and the life-force of
the film.</P>
<P>The travelogue tour of Lisbon, a city that is easy to look at because of
its beautiful colors and tranquil streets, should come as no surprise,
since this commercial film was sponsored by the city, as a way of
boosting tourism. Wenders contrasts the splendid structures of the old
city with the more modern Lisbon, not taking sides which one he likes
better.</P>
<P>The great Portugese filmmaker Manoel de Oliveira makes a cameo to
deliver a sermon on films, asking, "What use is the universe?" A
profound question for this lightweight travelogue to probe, as this
conversation seems forced, not happening with the mood of the film;
nevertheless, some good ideas about the values of the older films are
discussed here, the main point being that we need artists so that they
can imitate God.</P>
<P>I just didn't see much of a story in this somewhat diverting travelogue
about Lisbon, that would compel me to find this semi-documentary as
anything but a mildly interesting travelogue.</P>
