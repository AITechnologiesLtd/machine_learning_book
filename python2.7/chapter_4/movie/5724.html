<PRE>                             BRAVEHEART
                       A film review by Magus
                        Copyright 1996 Magus</PRE>
<PRE>Starring Mel Gibson</PRE>
<P>OK.  I just saw this movie a few days ago.  Why so late?  I missed it in the 
theatres mainly cause I was worried about its length.  I have missed it on 
video for a while since there is never a copy at the local Blockbuster.  But a 
few days ago, and after my friends convincing me to see it, good old 
Blockbuster had a copy.  So was the movie spectacular enough to win the 
numerous Oscars it did?  Read and find out...</P>
<P>Braveheart has a lot good things going for it.  One is the surprising fact 
that the 3 hours go by relatively quickly.  Another is the wonderful scenery 
and the stirring music in the background.  Yet another is the solid acting.
So what WAS the problem with the movie?  A generally ho-hum plot.</P>
<P>OK.  I know that Braveheart was "based on a true story".  I have never read 
anything on William Wallace (Mel Gibson's character).  But the plot has no 
surprises in it.  Nothing is very original about it.  But the stuff that is 
there is watchable at least.</P>
<P>The plot basically begins when William Wallace is a kid and his father is 
killed in an attack on the English.  William Wallace lives in Scotland and the 
evil King of England is ruling over Scotland.  The Scotland peasants want 
their freedom.  William Wallace then gets a visit from his uncle who tells 
Wallace to come with him.  William basically has no choice since he only lived 
with his father, so he goes with his uncle and it is implied that he learns 
sword fighting skills as he grows up.</P>
<P>Then the film continues on to when William Wallace is grown up.  The rest of 
the film deals with Wallace gathering more people in his army of peasants and 
engaging them in huge epic war battles.  It has your standard lost loved-one 
and double crossing along the way.</P>
<P>Overall I would reccomend Braveheart to Mel Gibson fans or to people who loves 
battles where thousands of people charge against eachother and fight on huge 
fields.  Or if you want to see a violent war epic with some drama thrown in.</P>
<PRE>I give Braveheart *** out of ****.</PRE>
