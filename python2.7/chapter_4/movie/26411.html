THE LADIES MAN
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Because THE LADIES MAN has one of the worst trailers in recent memory, 
the more I saw the trailers, the less I looked forward to the film's 
screening.  When it finally came time for the screening, I could barely 
force myself to go.  It turned out to be one of biggest and most 
enjoyable film surprises I've had in some time.  Whereas the movie is no 
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, it is extremely funny and wonderfully 
sweet, although with quite a raunchy brand of humor.</P>
<P>Directed with good comedic timing by Reginald Hudlin and written 
uproariously by Tim Meadows, Dennis McNicholas and Andrew Steele, THE 
LADIES MAN stars Tim Meadows as Leon Phelps.  Leon is a radio talk show 
host who likes to help people with their sexual difficulties.  A mixture 
of Dr. Ruth and Howard Stern, Leon throws out advice a mile a minute, 
most of it unprintable.</P>
<P>The movie is like an African-American version of PRIVATE PARTS as it 
relates Leon's life story.  With the wild wackiness of AUSTIN POWERS, 
the movie tells us of Leon's childhood as an orphan raised by buxom 
bunnies in a Playboy Mansion look-alike with a Hugh Hefner clone as his 
surrogate father.  Having an Afro hairstyle from age 1 on, Leon is a guy 
who has been forever stuck in the 70s.  His radio show's advice comes 
from his long experience as a ladies man, having had sex with half of 
the women in town.  Maybe more.</P>
<P>Although this material could be crude and offensive, instead it is crude 
and funny, thanks to Meadows's eminent likeableness.  With his little, 
disarming lisp, and his broad smile, he is such an easy guy to love that 
you can understand women falling for him, even if he isn't the 
handsomest guy on the block.  A side-joke concerns his private part, 
which causes a blinding light when unleashed, and his butt, which has a 
smiley tattooed on it.</P>
<P>One of the reasons for the film's surprising success is the casting of 
Leon's sidekick.  His radio producer and work companion, Julie, is 
played with charm and spunk by Karyn Parsons.  She is one of the few 
women in his life with whom he hasn't slept.  </P>
<P>After being thrown off of his popular radio show due to viewer 
complaints and management who hates him -- again, shades of PRIVATE 
PARTS -- Leon goes from rejection to rejection as he and Julie apply for 
jobs at other stations.  After promising Julie that he'll clean up his 
act, he finally lands a job at a small religious station.  His first 
guest is a nun who talks about assuming a missionary position and 
traveling to Bangkok.  Sweating profusely, Leon looks in danger of 
short-circuiting his brain as he fights back bawdy responses to the 
comedic softballs she unknowingly throws at him.</P>
<P>The supporting cast is well utilized.  Billy Dee Williams, playing a 
bartender, serves also as the story's narrator, giving Leon's story a 
fairy tale rendition.  Will Ferrell plays Lance, the leader of a support 
group (VSA - Victims of the Smiling Ass) of husbands whose wives have 
been caught dallying with Leon.  A Hummer driving, Greco-Roman wrestler 
who has a proclivity for heavy body oil and other wrestlers, Lance turns 
out to be quite a song-and-dance man.  One of the film's delights is a 
long dance number with the VSA men that seems straight out of an old 
Rodgers and Hammerstein musical.  It is well choreographed, tuneful and 
funny.  (I'd trade this one number for all of DANCER IN THE DARK.)</P>
<P>The people, including Julie's parents, who take Leon's advice, end up 
happier and with a much better love life.  So it is with the movie.  Go 
in expecting little and you may find the movie as charming and funny as 
I did.  Our half-full audience certainly laughed like a packed one.</P>
<P>THE LADIES MAN runs a lightening fast 1:24.  It is rated R for sexual 
content and language and would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
