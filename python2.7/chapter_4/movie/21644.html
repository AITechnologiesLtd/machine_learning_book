<P>Susan Granger's review of "THE OMEGA CODE" (Providence Entertainment)</P>
<P>Onward, Christian filmmakers! Heavily promoted by the Trinity
Broadcasting Network, the largest Christian TV organization in the
country, this religious thriller is an end-of-the-world suspense story
based on the book of Revelation. Written by Stephan Blinn and Hollis
Barton, it manages to be a non-violent story about Armageddon,
crediting to Hal Lindsey (The Late Great Planet Earth) as "prophecy
consultant." The muddled plot revolves around Casper Van Dien as a
Tony Robbins-like motivational speaker who, along with European Union
Chairman, played by Michael York, seems to be trying to secure a world
peace agreement. Only, a secret Biblical code falls into the wrong
hands, putting the world's future at stake. Not surprisingly, Van Dien
will have to accept Jesus Christ as his Lord and Savior in order to
save civilization as we know it. Produced by Matthew Crouch, son of
TBN's president, Paul Crouch, the film is designed to alert Hollywood
that there's an audience for clunky spiritual entertainment. They may
be right from a religious perspective but film-making is an art that
these zealots have yet to master. Casper Van Dien (Starship Troopers)
is handsome but unconvincing, as is Catherine Oxenberg as a talk show
host. Michael York's such an obviously sleazy megalomaniac that it's
not credible that he's a trusted diplomat. Only Michael Ironside
emerges with dignity intact. Rob Marcarelli's direction is flat and
unimaginative, the computer graphics are juvenile, and the delusional
absurdity includes having Van Dien discover his house is bugged and
then verbally discuss his "secret" plans. On the Granger Movie Gauge
of 1 to 10, The Omega Code is a timely but ploddingly dull 3. I'd
advise you not to pay for this preachy, blatant brain-washing;
instead, tune in - free - to TBN.</P>
