<PRE>      !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<PRE>Shakespeare can be fun.
Shakespeare can be weird.
And Shakespeare can be done, well,..... like only crazies can do it, like
Peter Greenaway.</PRE>
<P>BUT IS NOT WILLIE SHAKESPEARE FOR THE MASSES.</P>
<P>And in many ways, Shakespeare's works are perfect for the movie screen,
because his characters think, dream, and have visions, in other words, have
such a visual acuity, that it actually can be shown in the celluloid, where
it can not on the stage.  One can make all the wishes, dreams, and visions,
really  live in any character's mind--- and the play gets better and
stronger still.</P>
<P>And the way the director shows this freedom, is with as much nakedness as he
can get away with, under the boundaries of good taste, and possible
censorship.  The nakedness here is an excellent symbol of the freedom of
mind and word, which Prospero wants, and keeps under wraps at almost all
times. It is a really good analogy for the whole play, and one that most
people are afraid to tackle.  And Greenaway does, like no other.   And in
one film he manages to ditch down the drain all the good actors who were
capable of helping you see a truth through their perfect diction........and
done by a true master of diction himself, SIR JOHN GIELGUD.  It is truly
beautiful at times, and odd at others, but the end result, is an evening
that ends with one wondering what is it exactly that we have just seen, and
what exactly was it about, and how, and how does it all come together...???
All in all, the very thing which film has forgotten under the guise and
direction of people who only do and show entertainment, instead of art.</P>
<P>In his island, Prospero rules.  There he has all the arts to his disposal,
and the ability to make anything happen.  And there he also has the ability
to outgrow himself, thus making possible his ascension as a magician of good
capabilities, which is all well and fine within the confines of the play
itself.   And in this island every nymph, satyr, and angel that has ever
lived owes it to be a part of a man's vision.</P>
<P>The film moves back and forth between images and pictures from Renaissance
texts to actual image on the screen, thus also blending the creativity, and
avid curiosity, of a time that has appeared very boring in the history
books.  The books on magic and any kind of experimentation was plentiful,
and the likes of DaVinci, were a part of it.  And Prospero wants to be in
league with the best of them.</P>
<P>Aside from the fact that this film is really unusual, and not specially made
for everyone to see and learn about Shakespeare, it is without any doubt a
very serious, dare I say Busby Berkeley- like, show about the thinking
of a man who has much depth......and we are let into his chambers of mind
and depth, to learn about him, and his world.</P>
<P>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FILM IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED IN TRULLY MODERN
ADAPTATIONS OF SHAKESPEARE'S WORK.  IT IS EXCELLENT.  JOHN GIELGUD REALLY
DESERVES A MENTION FOR AN OSCAR AT LEAST........HE IS ONE OF THE VERY BEST,
and his eloquent delivery, so gentle, so powerful, so clear, will leave you
gasping....the words are so alive.....</P>
<P>THE BEST GREENAWAY FILM YET, and for once it isn't psychotic, or sickening.</P>
