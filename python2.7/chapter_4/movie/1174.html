                                [Spoilers]
                       A film review by John Locke
                        Copyright 1991 John Locke</PRE>
<P>     Coming on the heels of GOODFELLAS, a film destined for the Hall of
Fame, I expected Scorsese's CAPE FEAR to check in at a notch or two
below.  Boy, was I shocked.  CAPE FEAR is the first Scorsese film I've
seen that I would describe as downright bad.  It has some of the
director's cinematic panache and it's minimally competent.  The acting
is fine.  DeNiro, in particular, gives great cretin, but that's no
revelation.  The soundtrack is great, a rework of Bernard Herrmann's
from the original CAPE FEAR.  But here's where the film falls apart:</P>
<P>    * Overall, the plot assaults you with improbabilities at every
      turn.  Very little rings true here.  However, there are some nice
      characterizations--the teenage daughter, for one--that would
      have been at home in a better picture.</P>
<P>    * DeNiro's near indestructible psychopath, Max Cady, is absurd.
      He's more like the Terminator than a man, programmed to destroy
      and impossible to stop.  Scorsese seemed to be copping the James
      Cameron style of false endings and phoenixes.  Cady is beat up
      with pipes and chains, doused with boiling water, lit on fire,
      thrown into a a raging river, and he just keeps coming back for
      more, as if none of it mattered.  This works if you're using
      monsters; with a man it's just stupid.  I couldn't wait for the
      damn thing to end.</P>
<P>    * Nick Nolte plays the Dustin Hoffman character from STRAW DOGS, or
      maybe one of Charles Bronson's revenge freaks.  He's the educated
      man who has to come to grips with his own savage potential in
      order to defend his family.  Utterly unoriginal.  Scorsese tries
      to dignify the pulp by making psychological connections between
      Nolte's lawyer and Cady.  The effort is strained in the context
      of the ridiculous story.</P>
<P>    * This movie loses big by coming out so soon after THE SILENCE OF
      THE LAMBS, a vastly superior thriller.  Both films aim for the
      same kind of psychological intensity.  The difference is this.
      You can retroactively analyze SotL and realize that Lector is
      perhaps an impossible character, but while the movie is running
      he takes over the screen.  He's completely compelling.  But Max
      Cady doesn't deliver enough intensity.  He seems ridiculous and
      impossible while the movie is going on. (One of the tricks in
      CAPE FEAR was very similar to a trick in THE SILENCE OF THE
      LAMBS--when Cady disguises himself as the maid.  Because the trick
      was so effective and memorable in SotL, I saw it coming from a
      mile away in CAPE FEAR.)</P>
<P>Rating: $1.50 on the $0.00 to $6.25 scale (popcorn not included).</P>
