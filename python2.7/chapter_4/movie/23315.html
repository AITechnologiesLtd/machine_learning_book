Topsy-Turvy (8/10)</PRE>
<P>Lars von Trier makes a science-fiction epic. Tim Burton makes a romantic
comedy. Hardly less shocking is the idea of Mike Leigh, the master of
bitter-sweet contemporary kitchen-sink dramas such as Life is Sweet and
Secrets and Lies, making a period piece with musical numbers and
involving historical characters. But he has, and has done it
wonderfully. Leigh's admirers can rest easy that despite the beautifully
realised Victorian costumes and interiors, the usual Leigh elements are
there - the wry sad humour, the pain of disappointments profound and
mundane, and the delight in people and their idiosyncrasies.</P>
<P>In Topsy-Turvy, Leigh uses the first production of Gilbert and
Sullivan's The Mikado to explore his familiar themes. After the
lacklustre reception of their Princess Ida, composer Sullivan (Allan
Corduner) states his intention to abandon the musical theatre for his
more serious symphonic work. Librettist Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) seeks to
persuade him to change his mind and produce yet another opera at the
Savoy theatre for Richard D'Oyly Carte (Ron Cook), but Sullivan is
unimpressed by Gilbert's stale ideas for the new opera and it looks like
the legendary partnership is over. Gilbert then visits a Japanese
cultural exhibition, and the seed of the idea for The Mikado is sown in
his mind.</P>
<P>Despite his ambitions as a serious composer, Sullivan is a bit of a
party animal, while Gilbert, in contrast to his delightfully funny
lyrics and dry wit, is a fairly joyless soul whose only moments of
spontaneity occur in private. Leigh manages to explore the complexities
of his characters in ways that few other film-makers can match. Leigh's
films are scripted, but the script is the result of lengthy rehearsal
sessions which are largely improvised. This gives his films a
distinctive combination of spontaneity and discipline. Both lead
performances in Topsy-Turvy are a joy, as are the supporting turns,
particularly that from Leigh regular Timothy Spall. During the
preparation for The Mikado's first performance, we are treated to
several musical numbers from the show. You do not have to be a Gilbert
and Sullivan buff to enjoy the songs' hilarious, and utterly British,
interplay of stoicism and eccentricity. </P>
<P>There is a moment in Topsy-Turvy which is even more of a departure for
Mike Leigh than the historical setting and the music: the camera moves
in under Gilbert's face and tilts up to look at him from below as he
beams with joy at the moment his is struck by the inspiration for The
Mikado. For Mike Leigh to actually draw attention to the camera in this
way is astonishing. Maybe he'd just watched The Matrix and came over all
funny. Steady on, there Mike. </P>
<P>Topsy-Turvy is a long film, and could perhaps have benefited from a bit
of tightening-up here and there, but it is nevertheless delightful and
confirms Mike Leigh as one our national cultural treasures. (8/10)</P>
