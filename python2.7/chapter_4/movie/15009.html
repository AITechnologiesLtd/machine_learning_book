<P>Grand Prix winner at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival, "Life Is 
Beautiful" offers ample rewards to those viewers willing to submit to 
the peculiar vision of writer, director and star Roberto Benigni. The 
Italian artist has crafted an often lyrical light romance that 
abruptly transforms into a deeply moving tale of survival. Despite 
the film's radical shift in tone, Benigni's message never wavers: 
life is beautiful if you make it so. While we cannot always control 
the circumstances around us, we can govern our individual responses. 
Each person has the capacity to create his or her own internal 
reality. It's just a matter of willpower.</P>
<P>The film, in Italian with English subtitles, begins as a romantic 
farce. Guido (Benigni) is a Jewish drifter who stumbles through 1939 
Fascist Italy, using his wits and clownish charm to get by. When told 
of a philosopher's belief in the strength of human will, Guido takes 
the remarks literally and begins to practice "willing" things to 
happen. In short order, he successfully courts the beautiful Dora 
(Nicoletta Braschi, Benigni's real-life spouse) and builds a thriving 
business and happy life for his family, blissfully ignoring the 
growing anti-Semitism around them.</P>
<P>Then in 1945, the final days of World War II, authorities take Guido 
and his five-year-old son Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini) into custody, 
herding them onto a train bound for a concentration camp. When Dora 
hears the news, she races to the train station and insists that she 
be put onboard as well. Even though she is not Jewish, Dora refuses 
to leave her family. </P>
<P>At the camp, Guido concocts a story to shield his son from the 
horrific reality around them. He tells Giosue that it's all an 
elaborate game. The goal is to accumulate 1000 points. Giosue's eyes 
widen as he hears of the prize; a real tank, ever so much better than 
the toy he used to play with. The child listens intently as his 
father explains the mechanics of the game. The men in uniform will 
pretend to be very mean. The child must hide when his father 
instructs him to do so, and never complain about the lack of food or 
harsh conditions, because complainers will be disqualified and sent 
home. As their existence grows increasingly difficult, Guido 
encourages his son to take heart, because more and more people are 
dropping out and they are growing much closer to winning the game.</P>
<P>While the constant threat of death hovers in the air, Benigni avoids 
explicit imagery. ''As a comedian,'' he told the L.A. Times, ''I 
couldn't do like Spielberg with 'Schindler's List' and show the 
violence directly. It's not my style. My style is to evoke and let 
people use their imaginations. Sometimes the horror can be even more 
powerful that way.'' </P>
<P>The idea for the story sprang from Benigni's childhood. His father, a 
soldier imprisoned for two years in a German labor camp, was obsessed 
by his memories of the ordeal and frequently told his children about 
the nightmarish camp. Eventually, his wife convinced him that he was 
scaring the children, so he started telling the tales in a lighter 
way. ''He found funny things to say, even when dealing with these 
painful circumstances,'' said Benigni. ''The way he was telling the 
stories is exactly what I have done in my story.'' </P>
<P>The film's title came from Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky, who 
wrote that he believed ''life is beautiful,'' even as he sat trapped 
in a bunker, waiting for Stalin's agents to assassinate him. Benigni 
found the statement profound, saying ''I fell in love with this 
simple phrase, 'Life is beautiful.' Even with darkness all around us, 
we can still find beauty. That is true strength.''</P>
<P>Benigni's film is beautiful as well, although the going is often 
difficult. While the first half of the story has a certain charm, the 
pratfall comedy is more ingenious than funny, and Benigni's mugging 
gets old fast. The performer has been called the Robin Williams of 
Italy, and, like Williams, his comedic grandstanding frequently 
becomes overbearing. Thankfully, the lyricism of the story outweighs 
his lack of subtlety.</P>
<P>Nicoletta Braschi is adequate as Dora, although she lacks the depth 
necessary to convincingly express the emotions beneath her 
character's brave actions. As Giosue, young Giorgio Cantarini is a 
real charmer, interacting flawlessly with Benigni. When he questions 
his father's story, fearfully stating ''A man was crying. He said 
they make buttons and soap out of us,'' the effect is devastating. </P>
<P>Of the supporting cast, Horst Buchholz is memorable as a riddle-
obsessed German doctor, providing one of the film's most poignant 
moments late in the story; Giustino Durano is haunting as Guido's 
uncle, and Aaron Craig does America proud in a brief appearance as a 
benevolent U.S. soldier.</P>
<P>It's not easy to sit through ''Life Is Beautiful.'' Between Benigni's 
mugging, the often flat comedy, and the structure of the piece, it's 
actually quite hard. But those up to challenge will receive ample 
dividends. Benigni's unique concept and wonderful message about the 
human spirit makes this awkward, ungainly film well worth the trouble.</P>
