<PRE>                            THE TRIGGER EFFECT
                       A film review by Edwin Jahiel

<P>"The Trigger Effect," screenwriter David Koepp's first feature as a 
director, hooks you strongly at the start. Later, when slowness, 
loose ends and diffusion lessen the power of the hook, there is still 
evidence of tight collaboration between the writer-director, his 
cinematographer (crisp work), editor, production designer and 
others.</P>
<P>Koepp has said that his inspiration was the late 1970s BBC 
documentary series "Connections," written, directed and 
"performed" by that fascinating man, James L. Burke. It is 
abundantly clear that the connection to "Connections" is used with 
dexterity in "The Trigger Effect."  </P>
<P>The opening shot is of coyotes devouring their prey at night. You 
may think this is in the wilderness, but then, in quick succession 
the next shots are of a large power plant, of a busy mall on a Friday 
night, of its multiplex and of the inside of a theater. Connections 
are imaginatively made between animals, technology and humans.</P>
<P>Knowing nothing of the movie, as soon as the second shot appeared 
I thought that the old Latin saying "Homo homini lupus" (Man is a 
wolf to man) was the direction the film would take. It did, with a 
vengeance. The mall sequence is a tour-de-force, a single, 
continuous four-minute Steadicam shot in which strangers bounce 
off each other  in such uncivil ways that within humans not only 
are connections shown but the disconnections too. </P>
<P>Inside the theater we witness unpleasantness between some black 
and some white customers, as Annie gets insulted while her 
husband Matt remains timorously silent. There's also something 
disconnected between those two, and quietly reinforced by the cold 
look of the parking structure they go to after the show.</P>
<P>We follow them to their upscale home in some suburb of (unnamed) 
Los Angeles. The house, bristling with burglar alarms, is in a state 
of disconnection with itself, because of messy renovations in 
progress. There is tension between husband and wife, the kind of 
gradual alienation that can set in a marriage. It is manifested by 
several subtle yet telling details.</P>
<P>They find their baby girl feverish and in pain with a recurring ear 
infection, for which there is no more medicine left.  A sudden 
blackout affects the whole city, at the very least.. Every activity 
and machine connected to electricity comes to a halt, including 
broadcasts. Matt drives to a store where the lifeless tills make 
only cash acceptable. He has no prescription for the child's drug, 
there's no way to call the doctor. Matt, after an altercation with 
the unpleasant pharmacist, returns home empty-handed. Later 
though, in a decision which cannily combines paternal anxiety and a 
show of newfound machismo, Matt goes back to the store and steals 
the drug in a good, suspenseful sequence.</P>
<P>There's commotion in the chic development, with neighbors 
grumbling, advising, consulting and showing more un-neighborly 
selfishness than mutual help.</P>
<P>Subcontractor Joe, Matt's oldest friend, visits and stays. He adds to 
the tension as, in more subtle ways yet, we see that best buddy or 
not, manual worker Joe is disconnected from the high-earning  
(profession unknown) yuppie Matt. Also because Joe is single, of 
the "marriage is living death" school, with a succession of 
girlfriends and with an eye on Annie.</P>
<P>What is not subtle is the blatant way the film keeps underlining 
Annie's sexuality at every turn. When the threesome sit by the fire,  
the wife, after a drink or two, loses her inhibitions and engages in 
not so oblique sexual talk.</P>
<P>Matt and Joe go out and buy a shotgun which, expectedly, has 
tripled in price. By the next morning, an intruder has been shot dead 
(How the cops were contacted remains a mystery). Annie gets 
closer to Joe. All talk of leaving town. (A sure way to guarantee 
looting). It is at this juncture that the movie begins to lose points 
by becoming too much ado about not enough danger.</P>
<P>It might have been a study in new stresses added those of "normal" 
life. The pharmacy bit , for example, could have been extended to a 
blackout's other problems. But writer-director Koepp cannot shake 
off a penchant for the sensational. Never explaining the source, 
extent or estimated length of the blackout, he treats it like a 
mythical plague that brings out the wolf in humans.</P>
<P>David Koepp has co-authored the quirky "Apartment Zero,"  "Death 
Becomes Her," "Jurassic Park," "Mission: Impossible," "The Paper," 
"Toy Soldiers." His solo scripts are "Bad Influence," '"Carlito's Way,"  
"The Shadow," and " The Trigger Effect." He can be good, but does he 
like "strong" and hyperbolic situations!</P>
<P>Here he continues going over the top on Sunday, the third day of the 
crisis, when thousands of cars take to the road in an eastward 
exodus. The trip, the encounters (some wildly coincidental), the 
fear of the unknown and of strangers, lead to misunderstandings 
and irrational violence, as well as to a too neat, Hollywoodish, 
goodie-goodie rapprochement between individuals and races, while 
heroicizing Matt. All this is too much deja vu and in far too slow a 
tempo.  </P>
<P>Metaphors and symbols, past a certain number, encumber the 
picture.  Like most movie people, Koepp sees life through 
Californian glasses. Those of us who have been through much longer 
blackouts --though, granted, not in a megalopolis -- can testify 
that the resulting inconveniences can also make people helpful and 
kind in this "we're in it together" situation. But then, ugly sells 
more tickets than nice, and, 'tis true, Los Angeles is not angelic. </P>
<P>What is universally valid for developed countries is our modern 
dependence on technology. But let's not go overboard and whole-hog, 
and read the movie as a denunciation of dehumanization by 
technology. Machines, gadgets and alternating current may spoil us  
or become counter-productive fixations. They can render us 
helpless when they abandon us. But they have also improved 
immeasurably the quality of life, work, health, leisure and have 
added (including Cyberspace) incalculable benefits to our existence. 
It's too late to become Luddites.</P>
