MAD MAX
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1998</PRE>
<P>Most people would agree with Wes Craven's saying that
"sequels suck", yet there are some notable exceptions to the
rule. One of such exception is MAD MAX 2 a.k.a. THE ROAD
WARRIOR, one of the most successful and influential movies
of the last decade. So, the logical question arises: if the
sequel is so revered, is the original also good or even
better? Answer to that question lies in MAD MAX, Australian
1979 action movie that launched the careers of director
George Miller and today's Hollywood megastar Mel Gibson, as
well as a commercial boom of Australian cinema in 1980s.</P>
<P>Although the opening title puts the plot of this movie in
the near future, on the surface the world looks pretty same
as today's. The only difference is in decline of the public
services, including law enforcement, that opened way to
psychopathic biker gangs to make the roads and countryside
their undisputed realm. The small, yet dedicated police
force is using their powerful, and in the same time
obsolete, machines in a losing battle to prevent the law and
civilisation from becoming distant memory. The best among
them is Max Rokatansky (Mel Gibson), supreme killing machine
on the road, whose skills are again proven in a deadly
confrontation that leaves escaped cop-killing biker
Nightrider (Vince Gill) dead. However, Max is in a same time
dedicated family man, and after seeing too many of his
colleagues hurt or killed in a futile struggle, he
contemplates quitting and takes his wife and son to the
vacation. Unfortunately, the bikers led by Toecutter (Hugh
Keays-Byrne) had already marked Max as a target because of
Nightrider's death and they kill his family in the process.
Having nothing else to live for, Max returns to the road,
but this time not as policeman, but avenging maniac, using
all of his abilities to track and kill bikers, even in the
vast areas abandoned by legal authority.</P>
<P>In many ways, plot of MAD MAX looks like a combination of
vigilante cop thriller and B-western. Many also argued that
mild futuristic motives serve only as an excuse for hour and
half of brutal non-stop violence. On the other hand, even
those critics that question movie's originality praise
Miller for the talent he showed in his great cinematic
debut.  MAD MAX was made on a ridiculously small budget
(being edited by Miller himself, in his own bedroom), yet it
didn't look cheap. On the contrary, some of the stunts and
action scenes are spectacular and breathtaking. Small budget
also worked into the movie's advantage; being forced to use
second-hand equipment as props, Miller painted the picture
of industrial decay in order to illustrate the declining
state of future civilisation.</P>
<P>Miller's visions of near future, that would be even more
developed in next two MAD MAX visions, have been actually
inspired by current events. The great fuel crisis of 1973
suddenly showed great, and until than unthinkable,
vulnerability of Western civilisation. The loss of faith in
progress and technology coincided with the great moral void,
left by the breakdown of traditional social values in the
1960s. Miller, and many like him, feared that the fall of
industrial institutions would lead to anarchy and new
barbarism, because society wouldn't be able to protect
individual, now forced to live without any moral compass.
Such ideas were already explored in JEREMIAH, cult comic
book by French artist Hermann, whose influence, together
with MAD MAX movies, would later incite whole sub-genre of
post-apocalyptic movies. Anyway, original MAD MAX fell in
line with a whole series of dark, dystopian science fiction
movies that were very popular in late 1970s and early 1980s.</P>
<P>Apart from dark tone that corresponded with pessimistic feel
of the time, MAD MAX succeeded also because it was good
movie. Mel Gibson was well-cast in the role of at least
nominally civilised policeman that later turns into
homicidal maniac, not very different than those he tried to
stop. Gibson very effectively portrays his gradual slide
into madness, and such experience would later serve him very
well in his later role as Martin Riggs in LETHAL WEAPON.
Other actors were also good and gave a lot to well-drawn and
strong characters, like psychotic Nightrider, evil
Toecutter, cool yet dealy Bubba Zanetti (Geoff Parry) or
stoned Johnny the Boy (Tim Burns) that would stick long in
our memory, despite their relatively short appearance in
this relatively short film. Sadly, among them, only Steve
Bisley, who plays Max's larger-than-life friend and
colleague Jim Goose, got some name recognition in later
years. Character of Jesse, Max's wife, was somwhat
undeveloped and the family scenes seemed a little bit
stereotyped, with the cheerfulness and sentimentalism that
is unnecessary contrast towards the dark and pessimistic
tone of the whole picture. Brian May's score, on the other
hand, was good, yet not as powerful as some other science
fiction soundtrack of that era. But, on the whole, MAD MAX,
despite being slightly inferior to its more influential
sequel, is still very effective piece of cinema, that can
entertain us despite forcing us to think about some
unpleasant topics.</P>
