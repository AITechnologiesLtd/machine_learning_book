<PRE>Dinosaur (2000)</PRE>
<P>I read a review of the latest Disney animated film DINOSAUR in which the 
writer stated the faces of the animals were amazingly expressive without 
seeming human.</P>
<PRE>Come on!</PRE>
<P>The whole conceit of almost any animated fare starring animals is that they 
must be humanized.  Personification is the name of the game.  In this film 
we do see compelling animation, the sad and happy expressions of the lemurs 
who adopt a baby herbivore (Aladar, voiced by D. B. Sweeney), and even the 
fierce grimaces of the leaders of the herd (Kron, done by Samuel E. Wright, 
and Kron's right-hand man Bruton, voice of Peter Siragusa).  Wonderful 
animation – computer-generated images superimposed upon enhanced backgrounds 
filmed at real places around the globe.  But these creatures talk and laugh 
and play: there's an ugly/cute anklyosaur that plays a doggie-like role.  
And Aladar's Modern-age thinking goes against the theories of most 
behavioral scientists:  how many dinos do you think disregarded their 
survival instincts to help out differently-abled brachiosaurs and 
triceratops?</P>
<P>So, we have to suspend just as much disbelief as we do in watching other 
animated adventures.</P>
<P>This adventure starts with a carnivorous dinosaur, horned and fierce, 
charging into the nesting ground of herbivores.  Dinosaurs of various 
species scatter, and Aladar's egg is the only one not crushed from his 
mother's particular nest.  We watch the egg change hands a few times,  from 
an egg-sucking thief who drops it in the water, to the pterodactyl that 
drops it into the forest over an island far out into the sea.</P>
<P>On this island Aladar hatches and grows up among a family of lemurs – 
animals that did not actually exist during the Mesozoic era.  We witness the 
typical shenanigans that go on among the young ones – the playful 
monkey-like lemurs as well as the huge Aladar.  It's not hard to tell that 
the newest animation techniques are the only original element in this film.  
Clearly, we have seen the plot many times.  Think THE LAND BEFORE TIME, or 
even the TARZAN films for their themes of exile, selflessness and personal 
redemption.  Disney was firing on all pistons when they produced THE JUNGLE 
BOOK; here they have let go another film that is pleasing to look upon but 
not very deep, another JUMANJI.</P>
<P>The meteor shower is quite an accomplishment, the gigantic and fiery rocks 
slamming into the sea around the island, causing the animals to flee to the 
mainland for their lives.  Also eye-catching are the vistas through which 
Aladar and his small, shaggy family travel – moonscapes as well as lovely 
meadows and ranges of real mountains.  When they meet up with the herd led 
by the grouchy Kron, the characters trudge through what looks like the Old 
West, plains cracked by dryness, canyons and rocks everywhere.</P>
<P>Perhaps the film would be more compelling with stronger conflicts.  What's 
going on here is that a couple of cousins of the T-rex are stalking the 
herd, which consists of an amalgam of dinos, the rear brought up by Joan 
Plowright's Baylene and Della Reese's Eema, a couple of aged but still game 
beasts who appreciate Aladar's kind and gentle approach toward migration.  
Will the herd, and particularly the crusty but lovable oldsters, elude the 
drooling, evil carnosaurs?  Secondarily, will Aladar survive threats from 
the leader of his own pack, Kron, whose sister he seems to be falling in 
love with?  The sister, Neera, by the way, is voiced by Julianna Marguiles, 
in a competent but unremarkable performance.</P>
<P>Music is also unremarkable, from the pen of James Newton Howard.  Most of it 
seemed transparent, accompanying the action scenes well enough.</P>
<P>The actors do wonders in this thinly-plotted work.  Besides the main 
characters listed above, Max Casella does a nice comic turn as a lemur 
called Zinni.  Ossie Davis plays a cantankerous grandfather lemur, Yar, his 
raspy voice imbued with character.</P>
<P>Who is the most likely audience for DINOSAUR?  Children.  It is rated PG for 
some scenes of violence, but these are used to suggest the realities of 
living in a world dominated by carnivores.  Nowhere do we glimpse anything 
too graphic – only one long-range killing, a couple of fight scenes, the 
skeletal remains of a fallen dinosaur.  Modern kids will not be scared.  
This film has gotten a lot of hype, and indeed its trailers looked slick and 
awesome.  But the movie as a whole is a collection of clichés bound together 
by some very nice animation (though even some of this looks plastic and 
fake-y).  Disney's best bet was releasing it now, in May, so that it would 
not be buried by the hopeful blockbusters of summer.</P>
