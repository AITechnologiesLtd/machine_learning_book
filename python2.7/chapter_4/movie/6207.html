                         That Thing You Do (1996)
                   A film review by Ben Hoffman
                    Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>          Tom Hanks says that he made the film to "protect my sanity."
He traveled all over the world promoting FORREST GUMP and it was
getting him down.  Wanting to do something different, he yearned for
"something creative" other than acting.   Having seen "The Compleat
Beatles" documentary, and being aware of the many, many band groups
back in the 1960s who had but one hit record and then disappeared, he
decided he'd like to write and direct a film about these "one hit
wonders."</P>
<P>          This then is a kind of compilation of many such groups as
Hanks saw them.  There is Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott) whose dull
life as a salesman in his father's hardware store is brightened by the
set of drums he plays after working hours.  This puts him in another
world.  When a group called The Wonders loses its drummer (remember
an ill Ringo being replaced temporarily with someone called Jimmy
Nichols?), Guy is ready to accept their offer to play the drums with
them.   Their identifying tune, "The Things You Do" shoots to the top
of the charts  and soon they are on their road to fame and fortune, or
so it would seem.</P>
<P>          Hanks uses some new actors to make up The Wonders.  There
are, in addition to Scott, Johnathon Schaech, Steve Zahn and Ethan
Embry.   The part of Faye, Jimmy's girlfriend, (Liv Tyler) is
portrayed by a very pretty blonde.  Guy's girlfriend, Tina, is played
by Charlize Theron.  Hanks himself has the role of an executive at a
record company (The Play-Tones) who manages the band.</P>
<P>       While the film is entertaining enough and does portray the
times, (the period of JFK being assassinated, of the VietNam war, etc.)
I found nothing special.  However, it does have some nice music and
it is recommended to anyone who lived through that era of the 60s.</P>
