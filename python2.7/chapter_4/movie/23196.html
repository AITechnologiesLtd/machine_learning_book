<P>People who say that money is the root of all evil have never had any.
So says Jim (Ben Affleck), the trainee whip at the J.T. Marlin
brokerage firm.  Jim is a millionaire.  You, too, will be millionaires
if you come on board, Jim tells an entire roomful of nineteen and
twenty year old guys, and they believe him.  His passionate speeches
and promises of fast money are what draw them in.  The huge houses,
big screen televisions, and expensive cars in the parking lot are what
keep them there.  Among the believers is Seth (Giovanni Ribisi), a kid
who runs a back door casino in his apartment.  Watching these scenes
is all too reminiscent of the brand of cult behavior you'd find at a
recruiting session for a pyramid scheme...  I've seen friends fall
prey to this brand of seductive half-logic, shut themselves off, and
turn into propaganda-spewing sales robots.  Let me assure you, it's
not a pretty sight.</P>
<P>The J.T. Marlin firm is what's known as a chop shop; they use
high-pressure sales tactics to push stocks that don't exist on
faceless people over the telephone.  Its members quote David Mamet's
Glengarry Glen Ross and Oliver Stone's Wall Street as if they were
reading from the Bible, and take every word from these films with
their irony and sarcasm detectors held in the off position with a
piece of duct tape.</P>
<P>To my surprise, there's been an inordinate amount of internet-fueled
backlash against how the characters are trying too hard to sound hip
and cool, and all they accomplish is that they wind up sounding like
posers.  All I can say to that is, well... duh.  Boiler Room shows us
an entire stock-market subculture that's traded individuality for a
quick buck; it presents us with figures that have ceased being people
and have become simple tools to perform a job.  They smack of
phoniness, and we witness through their pathetic attempts at "romance"
and snap bar fights how they can't function in society, but only
amongst themselves and in the context of their work.  There are themes
at work here that are addressed in David Fincher's Fight Club... only
these brokers aren't fighting to break free from societal chains, but
rather to keep themselves from losing them.</P>
<P>Most of the J.T. Marlin family chooses to shut its eyes and plug its
ears against the obvious fact that the firm isn't exactly on the up
and up...  senior broker Chris is one of them (Chris is well played by
Vin Diesel, who also stars in this week's Pitch Black, and the guy
displays an undeniable charisma in both of these films.)</P>
<P>But unlike the others, Seth soon begins to understand the grotesque
machine he has become a part of, and he does not like what he sees.
When his sense of ethics kicks in, he's torn between the huge amounts
of money he stands to make and the fact that he just screwed over a
family man in order to make that money.  He toys with the old
soldiers' adage of "just obeying orders" to try and justify it to
himself, but he eventually realizes he simply can't go on living like
that.</P>
<P>This is where Boiler Room makes its most effective move.  The film
genuinely complicates Seth's motives by making him a kid who, when all
is said and done, simply craves the approval of his father.  This
layer of the movie adds a welcome dimension to what easily could have
been another exercise in tired, generic ethics.  The treatment of
Seth's girlfriend Abby (Nia Long) is another refreshing piece of the
picture.  Their romance seems genuine, the potential interracial
political correctness is held at bay; and as Seth's moral center, she
doesn't simply offer the good and righteous answers - her views are
often as skewed as his own.</P>
<P>My only complaint comes at the end, and it's a trap that too many good
films tend to fall into.  Boiler Room goes a long way to demonstrate
the wrongs Seth has done and how he feels about it - through
interjecting scenes of the people whose lives Seth has destroyed, as
well as through Seth's own actions.  But then the movie decides to
spell out in big, bold letters what we already know, and a character
essentially delivers a sermon on what the audience has already been
effectively shown.  So a note to filmmakers: Subtlety and subtext are
wondrous things, put faith in the intelligence of your audience, and
trust that you got your message across.  Please, I'm begging you,
don't beat me over the head with it.</P>
