<P>   When I reviewed the worst comedy of the year 2000--"An
Everlasting Piece," a political satire like this one--I received a
nasty e-mail from its scripter and principal actor, Barry
McEvoy, who said: "I'm disappointed.  What I wanted to do
was to make a film that was original.  I wanted to make a film
that dealt with the issues in Northern Ireland in a way that
was brave and unlikely.  Obviously what I was getting at was
either a complete failure or wasted on you."  "An Everlasting
Piece," whose writer uses humor purportedly to show the
irrationality of friction between people of different ethnic
groups, may have had his heart in the right place, but
virtually every sally fell flat, mired in its utter banality and
predictability.  Now along comes a film that purports to
satirize American politics in the way Mr. McEvoy sent up the
politics of Northern Ireland. "Company Man" exceeds even
McEvoy's work in its pointlessness, its vapidity, its
unequivocal grade-school humor.  Not a single gag works. 
"Company Man" must simply have been an embarrassing
experience for the fine ensemble of actors who look so
confounded by its emptiness that one hopes they at least had
a good time clowning around with its frantic physicality and
witless waggery.  Incredibly, the screenplay was co-written by
a man from whom we expected more, Douglas McGrath, who
also penned the rich and stunning 1994 bauble "Bullets Over
Broadway," about a serious 1920s playwright who sells out
when offered a chance to direct his latest work on Broadway.</P>
<P>   Nothing's wrong with the premise.  "Company Man" intends
to deride the travesty of the U.S.-sponsored Bay of Pigs
invasion designed to overthrow the Castro government during
the early 1960s and even to segue into the Vietnam debacle
to prove that in the of foreign policy our government hadn't
learned from experience.  But the punch lines are so ungainly
that audience members who are good sports enough to sit
through the mercifully brief picture might actually hope for
some TV-style laugh track to save the actors the chagrin of
pausing and hearing only silence to reward their aspirations
to amusement.  Would you find the statement coming from a
high government official "good press is more important than
human life" particularly striking and original?  Or, when Alan
Cumming in the role of ex-Cuban president Batista, talks
about materials used to decorate his palace which came from
the Shah of Iran, says, "Do you know the Shah--very nice
man," do you congratulate yourself for being clever enough to
catch the inside political humor?  If so, this could be the
picture for you.</P>
<P>   The plot revolves around the CIA's hiring of a milquetoast,
Greenwich Connecticut high-school grammar teacher
(Douglas McGrath in the role of Allen Quimp) to head up a
plot to assassinate Fidel Castro.  He is retained because--as
he himself realizes--he would be the least likely person to be
identified as a spy.  Unfortunately, because of his need to
impress the community with his importance, he reveals his
secret identity to his wife Daisy (Sigourney Weaver) who in
no time informs everyone in the town.  Daisy, a bourgeois
matron who longs for a bigger house and a restaurant table
that is not adjacent to the kitchen, sees a chance for her own
15 minutes of fame.  She will write a scathing novel based on
her husband's heroism in his battle against the forces of
Communism that have overtaken Havana.</P>
<P>   Attempts by Denis Leary as a cynical officer stationed in
Cuba and by Ryan Phillipe as a Russian dancer who is able
to defect when a high school student in a drivers' education
program zooms away from a KGB agent do nothing to save
this movie.  John Turturro, acting in his standard macho role
by repeatedly rehearsing his plan to eradicate the Cuban
leader, mirrors Mr. McGrath's customary correction of the
grammatical errors of the colleagues he meets in his new job
in the Central Intelligence Agency.  Feel free to skip the film
and get your evening's superior entertainment by parsing sentences.</P>
