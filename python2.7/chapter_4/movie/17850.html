<P>                  SERGEANT YORK [1941]
           A retro reveiw by: Richard Matich
I once thought of Sergeant York as a great movie. I now
think its just a good movie. I have every right to
change my mind, especialy when I think I have been
wrong about an opinion or an idea. I try to keep an
open mind. Why is this film so heavily regarded by
some? You must put the film into the proper historical
context. It opened to a world on the brink of war
[WWII]. Some in the country were nuetral. Some,</P>
<P>however,  knew a fight with Germany, Italy, and Japan
was just a matter of time. Now that we have established
the time of the film's release, we can review the story
itself. Classic film "good guy" Gary Cooper is exellent
as the backwoods hero Alvin York. York became one the
greatest war heros of all time. The Collin Powell, or
Dwight Eisenhower type of "living legend" of his day. A
simple man thrust by circumstances beyond his control
into heroic actions. York saved the lives of his fellow
comrads in the</P>
<P>first world war, and also managed to capture enemy
soldiers. But the film over simplifies York's story.
All the action of valor happens much to quickly to seem
real, and there is little payoff from it. The movie
ends without the rousing finnish I expected. What had I
hoped to see before the end? I still do'nt know. I
might never come up with an answer to that question.
Cooper plays York well enough though. He even</P>
<P>made me respect his charecter York's not wanting to
fight because it would sacrafice his princibles of
kindness and passifism. Alvin York was never a man cut
out to be a soldier, and yet the ironic twist comes
when he becomes the big hero. Somewhat, however, I
question the truthfulness about the York story. The
Sergeant himself was part of the making of the movie.
He helped with the realism of the</P>
<P>events. I'll bet he did! I believe he could be accused
by some of "suger coating" his life for the silver
screen. Would'nt somebody you know do the same thing?
Remember that film is forever! My theory about the
movie's realism may never be proven [or be true at
all], yet the movie rings false. Very false! Perhaps
that is my problem with the "payoff" I was illuding to.
Howard Hawkes directed, and its not his best directing
by a long shot!</P>
<P>We were clamouring for heroism and patriotism at that
tumultous time in our history. I just wish we had
clamoured for a piece of our collective  history that
was beyond resonable doubt about its actually having
happened.</P>
