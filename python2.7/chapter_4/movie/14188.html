<PRE>Saving Private Ryan</PRE>
<P>It was to my detriment that I waited six weeks before finally seeing
_Saving Private Ryan_.  In the interim, I've heard a synopsis, strong
views pro and con, warnings of its graphic nature, and the candidates
for Oscar noms.  Superlatives ("the best war film ever made") are used
extravagantly, and there is this unwritten pressure to follow the media
frenzy.  Oh woe.  If only I had seen this afresh, with no pap.  Fat
chance.</P>
<P>That said, the best way to describe _Saving Private Ryan_ is by use of
analogy.  _Saving Private Ryan_ is to _Schindler's List_ is what _The
Lost World_ was to _Jurassic Park_.  It is a gorier, drawn out excursion
of elements made better in a prior film.  Lucky for Spielberg, _SPR_
doesn't suck like _Lost World_ did.  But Oscar contender?  I dunno.</P>
<P>Tom Hanks stars as Captain John Miller, a dedicated everyman, given the
task to find Private Ryan, so he could be released from duty.  Ryan's
three brothers had all died in the war, and the mother is in terrible
grief.  Such a move, reasons General George C. Marshall (Fargo's Harve
Presnell), should boost morale.</P>
<P>Should, but doesn't.  There's immense resentment amongst the ranks in
Miller's unit, most prominently voiced by Private Reiben (excellently
played by Ed Burns).  Does it make sense for an entire unit to risk
their lives in order to save one man?  Doesn't every other soldier there
have a mother too?</P>
<P>It's a good question, but remains unanswered.  Which puts the film in a
catch-22:  had the film been based on a real event, then a greater theme
of following unjust orders for a just cause would have genuine merit.
Because it's fiction, it's just a plot device, and a lame one at that.</P>
<P>The purpose of this plot device is to show, in vivid detail, the
atrocities of World War II.  Does it succeed?  Well... yes and no.  The
violence in the film is unlike any other World War II film ever made.
But violence doesn't equal realism.  I repeat: _Violence Does Not Equal
Realism_.</P>
<P>An example of this is in the opening sequence, mirrored after D-Day.
Two men are hiding underwater.  Two bullets (and _only_ two bullets)
glide down from above.  Two hits, in both chests.  Sure, it's
ultra-violent, it's relentless, and it's exhausting.  War is hell.  But
was that moment in cinema history realistic?  Me-thinks not.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the stars of the film could have waltzed in wearing loud
neon-colored bulls-eyes on their helmets.  They're just not going to be
hit.  Oh sure, the red-shirts next to them will, including one who takes
off his helmet, to study the bullet that missed him.  Not a good idea.</P>
<P>The D-Day scene has some interesting camerawork that sets it apart from
(but not superior to) that in _Glory_, _Apocolypse Now_, or _Platoon_.
I liked the eerie slow-motion in real-time effect, which gave a vivid
impression that we were seeing through Tom Hanks' eyes.  We are also
treated to the documentary-verite style of having the camera zig-zag
everywhere, sometimes with splatters of blood on its lens.  If nothing
else, these get some kudos.</P>
<P>Further, the opening sequence is also much gorier than any D-Day
sequence before.  But gore is gore.  Gore does not advance the plot,
increase the tension, or make a better film.  It just weakens the
stomachs of those who would otherwise want to see this film, but won't.
Meanwhile, Fangoria connoisseurs can see where Spielberg lifted his
ideas:  lessee... the intestines hanging out is from _Scream_, and the
man searching for his arm is similar to _Re-Animator_, only the effect
in those films was far more devastating...</P>
<P>Other finer plot points lifted from other films:  there's that
sharpshooter who prays and quotes Scripture before pulling the trigger.
There are elements of _Pulp Fiction_ and _Desperado_ in there.  Tell me,
if you see the Spielbergian shot of an extreme close up from the barrel
of a gun to the eye of the sharpshooter, just to hear him quote a Psalm
("Thou O Lord are my high tower"), do you think he's gonna miss his
target?</P>
<P>Then there's the cowardly everyman, Corporal Upham, who's played vividly
by Jeremy Davies (_Spanking the Monkey_).  The buzz is that he's a
sure-thing Oscar contender.  But his opening scene, where he clumsily
knocks down everything in his path and offers to bring a typewriter to
the mission, is among the worst acting and writing I have seen this
year. Perhaps Spielberg could not resist injecting some humor in the
film, which didn't need any.</P>
<P>The other strong supporting-Actor Oscar contender (they say) is Tom
Sizemore, who plays Captain Miller's gruff assistant, Sergeant Horvath.
Sizemore is okay, but nowhere near the perfection he reached in _Heat_.
Nah.  The best acting in the film is Hanks (a deserved given), with a
close second being that of Ed Burns.  Burns is resentful, thoughtful,
outspoken, tough, and dependable.  Most importantly, he's _real_.</P>
<P>Along the way, there are also nice cameos by Dennis Farina, Paul
Giametti, and Ted Danson.  But I secretly wished that the invisible
shield that surrounded a highly compensated cameo should've been lifted,
and the actor been shot at and died.  Particuarly Danson.  (No such
luck.)</P>
<P>Lastly, it is an unfortunate casting choice to have Matt Damon, fresh
off of _Good Will Hunting_ fame, play the title role.  Had he been an
unknown character actor, as he was when he was cast, there would have
been real suspense in the search.  No dice.  A scene where they find
another "Private James Ryan" is totally useless and from the
Screenwriter's Guide for Curing Writer's Block.  With an unknown actor
in that role, there would have been genuine tension, because you _just
wouldn't know_.</P>
<P>Damon is the only actor in the troupe who did not undergo a vicious
basic training beforehand.  It should come as no surprise that compared
to the rugged, tired, frustrated faces of his pursuers, Damon appears to
be out from walking his dog.  Maybe such a contrast would've worked.
Not here.</P>
<P>I don't want to give the wrong impression.  _Saving Private Ryan_ is a
pretty good movie.  Unfortunately, it's the masquerading as THE GREATEST
WAR MOVIE EVER MADE that's bothering me.  It has too many Spielbergisms
and cliches and screenplay distractions to merit that honor.  In the
final sequence, we see an old man revisiting the gravesite of a fellow
soldier, saying to his wife, "Tell me I've been a good man." I am not
impressed.  Sorry.</P>
<P>It's hard to place superlatives, but for my money, the best war film
ever made is a toss-up between _Paths of Glory_ and (if you have the
patience) _Gettysburg_.  Search for them.  Those are needles in a stack
of needles (at your video store).</P>
