<PRE>Blade</PRE>
<PRE>Starring Wesley Snipes and Stephen Dorff
Directed By Stephen Norrington
Running Time: 2 hours.</PRE>
<PRE>(New Line Cinema)</PRE>
<P>Wesley Snipes both stars and produces in this silly action flick. Snipes
plays 'Blade,' a half man, half vampire who's goal in life is to avenge the
death of his mothers by blowing the hell out of the blood suckers. In the
opening scenes, we can see he does this with particular gusto. Blade somehow
gets involved with rebel vampire Deacon Frost (Dorff) who feels that vampire
should take over the world. Blade tries to stop this, with help from
scientist friend Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) and female co-star
Karen (N'Bushe Wright. Yes, that is her name.) Blood, guts and explosions in
follow, all wrapped up in a big MTV type package.</P>
<P>The main problem with Blade is the fact that it's too tied up in it's own
stupid mythology, and this bogs down the whole film. While the audience is
waiting for the next mass homicide by Blade, we're instead 'treated' to
Frost and co. babbling on about some mystic vampire chronicle, and how the
blood beast (or something) will take over the world. I suppose this is all
fine if you're a fan of the Marvel comic, but the average audience member
may want some more bang for his/her buck.</P>
<P>When the action comes, it's pretty good, directed in a hyper kinetic, 'music
video' way. Unlike some other movies, where hyper kinetic means
'unwatchable,' the British director Norrington handles it all pretty well.
This film is not really for the faint of heart: there's a lot of blood
spurting, and in a homage to Scanners (1981) there's a few heads blowing up
in particularly graphic (yet obviously fake) way.</P>
<P>The performers are O.K, with Snipes seemingly having a good time as the
larger than life hero. However, he's a bit too serious for his own good in
this movie, and comes across as a bit boring. Dorff is much more fun as the
bad guy, even if he is a bit one note. He's suitably evil, however.
Kristofferson delivers a 2D performance, and Wright is pretty good in the
action babe role. Overall, the cast is slightly weak. While in other action
movies this wouldn't be so bad, because there's so much script in Blade, the
character flaws show up more. And in some cases, characters appear without
being explained at all!</P>
<P>The film also suffers from a overlong running time, and the fact that the
action is too far and few between. It's a shame, because when the action
does come up, it's well handled and pretty exciting. Had the film been less
concerned with the story, and more with the action, Blade could of been a
far more enjoyable movie. Sadly, though, Blade gets too bog down in plot,
and is nothing more than an average film.</P>
