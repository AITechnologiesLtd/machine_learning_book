<PRE>You and Your Truffles!
Chocolat</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony </PRE>
<P>Delicious cinematography tops this creamy small town tale about a 
non-conformist spirit who opens up a temptingly luscious chocolate shop 
during the Holy Lent season in a rigidly religious French village. </P>
<P>Though a variety of not necessarily French accents abound, it's an 
English speaking film. After initially stirring up some sticky thick 
first third acting, the performances sweeten. Likewise, the pace picks 
up during the second half. Lena Olin is standout marvelous as Josephine, 
the town kleptomaniac. </P>
<P>The good-hearted, but nomadic Chocolate-maker/spirit-lifter asks another 
drifter, "Did you ever think about belonging somewhere?" </P>
<P>His response takes little thought, "No, you end up caring what people 
think of you." </P>
<P>The film's only fault lies in its light fluffy center. Though the 
characters are all very lovely and endearing ... they seem far away. 
They don't reach into our hearts and choke us up. </P>
<P>Filmed so gorgeously, the term eye-candy rolls apropos in the mouth. At 
times the script dips a bit into the too cute; but for the most part 
this is a solid, even Disney story. In fact, it reminded me a great deal 
of Disney's "Balloon Farm." "Chocolat's" last shot even includes a 
dangling balloon. A strong B+. </P>
