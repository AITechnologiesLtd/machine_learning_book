<P>_Down_to_You_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)</P>
<P>        When Miramax's publicity department announced that their youth romance
_Down_to_You_ would not be screened in advance for critics because they
were running behind in getting prints finished, it was easy to peg that
excuse as a bunch of hooey.  After all, this _is_ January, the
traditional dumping ground for cinematic refuse.  While I don't think the
film is quite at that low level, it does suffer from a big problem--one
that is, interestingly enough, suggested by Miramax's no-screening
reason: in terms of content, the film feels unfinished itself.</P>
<P>        First-time writer-director Kris Isacsson does have his basic components
in place.  The heart of the film is the love story--told in heavy
flashback--between two New York college students, aspiring chef Al
(Freddie Prinze Jr.) and artist Imogen (Julia Stiles).  Their love is
first love--meaning passionate, impetuous, and in many ways immature. 
For the most part, what is not immature is Isacsson's honest portrayal of
such a type of relationship.  This being a standard-issue Hollywood
romance, it's not a spoiler to say that Al and Imogen are destined to end
up together.  Adding authenticity to such a convention is the unforced
rapport between Prinze and Stiles.  Yet as easily as their chemistry
convinces that these two do belong together, one does get the sense that
these two characters aren't quite ready to make the commitment to match
their natural compatibility.  They're human, but they're also quite
young, and thus prone to do things that make little sense, least of all
to themselves--and Al and Imogen hold true to that fact.</P>
<P>        While Al and especially Imogen come off as real people, their supporting
cast is sketchy at best.  Selma Blair is wasted in a throwaway role as a
porn star attracted to Al; Rosario Dawson is similarly squandered as
Imogen's flaky friend Lana.   At one point, Al gets on the outs with his
actor/also-porn-dabbling friend Monk (Zak Orth), but one never gets a
clear idea of who Monk is and how close he is with Al that it's
impossible to care.  The background players that remotely make any
impressions are those used for cheap comic relief: Al's workout-happy
roomie Eddie (Shawn Hatosy) and Al's TV chef father (Henry Winkler).</P>
<P>        But even those two fail to serve their real purpose: they really aren't
all that funny.  Then again, neither are all of the stabs at comedy in
_Down_to_You_.  This being a PG-13 film, the numerous porn and sex gags
are not only dumbed-down but played-down, thus rendering them pointless. 
In fact, all the attempts for laughs feel pointless, for they serve to
distract from the real matter at hand--the Al/Imogen romance. 
_Down_to_You_ feels unfinished largely because Isacsson never decided
what he really wanted to make: a straight romance, or a romantic comedy. 
As such, we have a love story whose charm is often undercut by silly
would-be comedy such as one character's attempted suicide by shampoo
ingestion.</P>
<P>        Like its title, _Down_to_You_ ultimately comes down to one person, and
that is Stiles.  As she demonstrated in _10_Things_I_Hate_About_You_, not
only is she an actress blessed with beauty and real presence, she also is
quite talented; she is able to suggest a depth to Imogen not necessarily
written in Isacsson's script.  She is also able to bring out a charm in
her co-star that I had never before seen in his other films.  I look
forward to seeing her in a real movie, for underachieving fluff such as
_Down_to_You_ fail to serve this promising new star any justice.</P>
