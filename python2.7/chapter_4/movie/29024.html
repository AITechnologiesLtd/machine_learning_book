<PRE>BROTHER
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>The first American film by writer, director, editor and star Takeshi Kitano, an
enormously popular Japanese version of Clint Eastwood, BROTHER could be referred
to as THE LONELINESS OF THE LONG DISTANCE GUNNER.  Like Eastwood's spaghetti
Westerns, the stylistic violence is the movie, and the plot is close to
non-existent.  The difference is that BROTHER is more violent, much classier and
absolutely fascinating.  As a director, Kitano has a gift for framing and
staying with a scene, and his editing choices are impeccable.</P>
<P>As the story opens, Yamamoto (Kitano, who goes by the acting name of Beat
Takeshi) is about to be a man without a country.  After a war breaks out between
two Japanese Mafia families, Yamamoto ends up with a Mafia death sentence
hanging over him.  He solves the problem by fleeing the country and going to
live with his kid brother, Ken (Claude Maki), in L.A.  Ken and his buddies,
including Denny (Omar Epps), are a bunch of two-bit drug dealers.  This is
completely unacceptable to Yamamoto, who almost single-handedly gets his brother
and his buddies to the top of the gangster chart.  With his pensive stare, his
slight facial twitch and his droll, macabre humor, Yamamoto is a walking time
bomb that explodes at random intervals.  In no time at all, he initiates two
major drug wars.</P>
<P>Rather like an opera, the dramatic and melancholy score sweeps us into the
frame.  Kitano loves to have the camera linger over facial close-ups.  Not a fan
of dialog, he likes to let the setting tell the tale.  But when words are
necessary, he prefers to keep them to a minimum.  Yamamoto, for example, in his
most emotive moment, says calmly, "We'll all die."  He does this with his
biggest smile of the movie, which is little more than a grin.  </P>
<P>BROTHER is a breathtakingly beautiful but graphically violent film that isn't
for everyone.  But, if you're a Kitano fan, you'll be very satisfied.</P>
<P>BROTHER runs 1:54.  The film is in English and in Japanese with English
subtitles.  It is rated R for pervasive strong violence, language and brief
nudity and would be acceptable for older teenagers.  </P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 12, gave it just one *, saying that it was a bloodbath
without a plot.</P>
<P>The film is playing in limited release now in the United States.  In the Silicon
Valley, it is showing at the AMC and the Century theaters.</P>
