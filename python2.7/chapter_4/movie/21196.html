<PRE>Old Geezer on a Lawnmower
The Straight Story</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Alvin Straight is seventy-three. He has bad eyes and hips. The state won't
issue him a driver's license, he refuses a walker opting for two canes and
he's too stubborn to have anyone drive him. Yet, his brother has had a
stroke in Wisconsin and he's bound and determined to get there.</P>
<P>"Alvin you're not thinking of riding this lawnmower to Wisconsin, are you?"
the mower salesman asks. Later Alvin puts it this way, "You're a kind man,
talking to a stubborn man."</P>
<P>This Straight story is also a slow one. The roaring pace (that's loving
sarcasm) of America's rural states, namely Iowa, add a carefully harvested
flavor to this simple robust tale. For example, a scene in which Alvin
purchases a "grabber" from a local hardware store takes a full two minutes
to blossom. It just goes to show you what patience and a good sense of humor
can yield.</P>
