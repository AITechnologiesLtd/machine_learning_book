<PRE>         Review: Species II (1998) -- By Robert B. Marks</PRE>
<P>     Just when we Science Fiction authors and fans thought that
we were finally making headway in Hollywood with such films as
the grossly underrated _The Postman_, the Hugo Award winning
_Contact_ and the excellent _Dark City_, there comes a film that
shows us where we stand.  _Species II_ is one of those films.</P>
<P>     Even watching it on pan-and-scan video (a rare occurrence
for me, but a friend picked it out), I came out feeling insulted
and dirty.  You see, not only am I a Speculative Fiction writer
(albeit unpublished, but that will change soon), but I also
consider myself an intelligent part of the human race.</P>
<P>     _Species II_ was simply awful.  However, in a Hollywood
which just doesn't understand SF (and to realize the full extent
of this misunderstanding, read Harlan Ellison's 1974 article
_Somehow, I Don't Think We're in Kansas, Toto_), awful is
somewhat forgivable.  However, _Species II_ is more than just
awful.  It is awful and blatantly misogynistic.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the best example to represent the entire film is the
first scene with Natasha Hendridge.  She plays Eve, a more docile
version of Sil from the first movie.  And, the first time the
audience sees her, she is strapped naked into a chair, being
lowered into a vat of corrosive gasses.  This is later described
by a general as "accommodations fit for a queen".</P>
<P>     And it only gets worse.  The plot, like in the first film,
is virtually nonexistent.  The first manned mission to Mars
returns, and two of the three astronauts (one male, one female)
are contaminated by a soil sample which takes over their DNA. 
This soil sample, by the way, contains alien DNA which comes to
life after accidentally thawing, having been dead for millions of
years (huh?!).</P>
<P>     They return to Earth, and are then put into a sexual
quarantine for 10 days (that's right; diseases don't bother the
powers that be, but they can't let their astronauts have sex). 
Even before this is over, the male astronaut goes on a rampage of
sex and violence befitting a bad slasher porn movie.  Every time
he couples, his mate immediately begins to swell and have a fully
developed eight-year-old burst out of her belly.  And just to
make sure we haven't missed the point, the corpses are often
shown in all their gory detail.  Also, the female half-alien
astronaut, predictably, dies in the same fashion (after all,
she's a woman and she has sex; can't let her live in this movie).</P>
<P>     Soon this trail of corpses is noticed, and Michael Madson's
character joins the biologist from the first film (who, by the
way, apparently has had a 180 degree change in her
characteristics) in trying to hunt down this sexual predator. 
The audience is then subjugated to a bunch of inconsistent
characterizations, stupid ideas (such as re-activating Eve's
alien attributes), and generally poor plot.  Not to mention
idiotic science and generally unexplainable events (two examples:
a researcher gets killed by a blood puddle for no apparent
reason, and a soil sample thaws spontaneously itself without
anybody noticing).</P>
<P>     And, to make matters worse, the film ends in such a way that
there will definitely be a sequel.  So, what begins with
scientific stupidity and poor plotting, ends without actually
wrapping anything up.</P>
<P>     All in all, _Species II_ was an offensive and unintelligent
film.  But I can say one good thing about it: it was better than
_Plan 9 From Outer Space_.  But not by much.</P>
<P>     So, the final score: 0/5; absolutely nothing redeemable
about this one.</P>

And I am but a lonely wanderer, / With time as my only home.
