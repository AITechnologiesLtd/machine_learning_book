<P>First things first – Live Nude Girls Unite! isn't a sequel to Live Nude
Girls, the 1995 sex comedy with Kim Cattrall and Dana Delany (thank
God).  Unite! is actually a documentary about a struggling lesbian
stand-up comedian who becomes a peep show dancer to make ends meet.
While the film starts out as a goofy demonstration of women using their
`feminine powers' (read: stripping for men) to get ahead in life, the
film quickly focuses on the strippers from a small San Francisco parlor
who launch a six-moth battle to become the first unionized strip club in
the country.</P>
<P>Julia Query (her stage name) moved from New York City to San Francisco
at 27 to become a writer and a comedian, but quickly found that it just
wasn't paying the bills.  She needed a job that paid well but had
flexible hours, and found it at the Lusty Lady Theatre.  Sure, Julia
could have made more money if she performed in stage shows or gave lap
dances at other clubs, but she couldn't dance (luckily, there's a pole
for her to hold on to at the peep show).  And the Lusty Lady was run by
woman managers, so it seemed like a perfect fit for the daughter of a
Jewish doctor well known as an activist for safe prostitution in New
York.</P>
<P>Before long, however, Julia found out that the club wasn't all it was
cracked up to be.  The management discriminated against, among other
things, race, age and hair color.  There was no sick pay and no health
insurance, and missing a shift usually resulted in termination.  There
was a growing concern that the dancers were being filmed by patrons
through one-way mirrors in each private booth.  In general, the girls
were getting paid less and less to do more and more, and there was an
increased sense of danger to boot.</P>
<P>At the mere mention of the word `union,' the club's management hired
anti-union lawyers to break up the possibility of the dancers banding
together.  Unite! follows the trials and tribulations of the lengthy
battle to unionize the club's strippers.  There's also an interesting
subplot, where Julia tries to hide her stripping (and lesbianism) from
her distinguished mother.</P>
<P>Co-directed by Query and Vicky Funari, Unite! is a film that would make
Michael Moore proud.  It effectively blends serious subject matter with
a deft comedic edge.  There's something very funny about seeing a wall
of time cards with names like Velvette, Ginger, Sapphire and Isis, not
to mention hearing the strippers chant, `Two, four, six, eight – don't
go in to masturbate' while picketing the club.</P>
<P>1:10 – Not Rated but contains nudity and adult language</P>
