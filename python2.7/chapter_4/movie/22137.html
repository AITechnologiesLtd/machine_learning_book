<PRE>Godzilla
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Matthew Broderick; Jean Reno; Maria Pitillo; Hank Azaria & Kevin
Dunn</P>
<P>The advertisements said that size does matter. I guess that's a bit of an
irony considering the size of this film's budget. Even with all of the money
that was obviously spent on this movie, Godzilla will probably go down as
one of the biggest disappointments of all time. Don't get me wrong, the
special effects are impressive -- what there are of them. But this movie
spends way too much time on the characters discussing strategies for
stopping the overgrown iguana and not enough time actually fighting the big
lizard. This movie could have been called Matthew Broderick as opposed to
Godzilla. Because Broderick gets way too much screen time in relation to the
big guy. When Godzilla is on screen, it is always dark and raining, so the
special effects never really come across as being that spectacular. For
those that don't really care about special effects shots, Godzilla has a
decent story line. It's just that Godzilla was marketed as a big budget
special effects picture, so when you notice the decided lack of spectacular
effects, it can be a bit of a disappointment. Add to that the fact that
Matthew Broderick, who is a great actor, just isn't the first person you
think of as the lead in an action film.</P>
<P>Nuclear testing in the South Pacific has genetically altered the native
lizards in the area and created what may be a new species. And a very large
species at that. Godzilla has lived under the sea in the area for years but
is now running out of food, so he is venturing out of hiding to find a new
food supply. His search eventually leads him to New York City
(coincidentally, the place where he can do the most damage). Broderick is a
scientist working for the US government who is brought in when Godzilla is
first discovered. He is supposed to try to figure out exactly what they are
dealing with. He then assists the powers that be in their battle to save New
York City from the big lizard. The search for Godzilla in New York is then
the focus of most of the movie. They never seem to know quite where he is at
any given time -- a point that undoubtedly saved the producers millions
since they didn't need to spend any money on special effects shots.</P>
<P>As I said, Broderick is a good actor, just not somebody who would be my
choice to headline a summer blockbuster movie. That having been said, he
does a pretty good job. As does Jean Reno, playing a mysterious man who
seems to keep showing up at the scene of Godzilla's destructive actions. The
good acting on the part of the leads really doesn't make up for the so-so
writing and the disappointingly scarce special effects.</P>
<P>Godzilla's creative team of Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin were also
responsible for Independence Day, another film that was short on story but
big on effects. I guess they figured this time that they would go short on
both story and effects. The end result is that they don't have nearly the
film in Godzilla that they had in Independence Day. Godzilla is not a truly
bad movie, but it never even comes close to living up to its enormous hype.</P>
