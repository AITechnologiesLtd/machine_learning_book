<P>     The story of WIDE SARGASSO SEA is a prequel to Charlotte Bronte's
classic JANE EYRE.  It tells what happened before the events of that
novel, explaining in some detail the history behind the mad West Indian
wife that Rochester (Nathaniel Parker) keeps locked away in the attic.
When Rochester is first introduced, he is a fortune hunter, and
Antoinette Cosway (Karina Lombard) is the object of his attention.  She
has a sizeable land holding in Jamaica that he wants to make his own,
so he entices her into marrying him.  For a while, the couple seems
genuinely happy, but eventually an ugly secret from Antoinette's
past--one that may also foretell her future doom--comes to light.</P>
<P>     WIDE SARGASSO SEA, faithful to the novel from which its story is
taken, is a beautifully photographed, wonderfully sensual, and
poorly-paced motion picture.  The first half-hour moves along nicely,
but then the film bogs down and by the last fifteen minutes (which go
by in blur), WIDE SARGASSO SEA has become virtually stagnant.</P>
<P>     Director John Duigan knows what he's doing when it comes to using
a setting to convey feelings.  WIDE SARGASSO SEA is a vibrant movie,
one of images and passions.  His sweltering 1840s Jamaica is perfectly
rendered as the backdrop for the tumultuous relationship between
Antoinette and Rochester.  Duigan manages something difficult--getting
an audience sitting in a cool movie theater to feel like they're in the
tropics.  Equal credit must go to cinematographer Geoff Burton, who
displays talent for the visuals of this film.</P>
<P>     Even with its uneven tone, WIDE SARGASSO SEA might have been a
success had stronger performers been hired in the leading roles.  While
both Karina Lombard and Nathaniel Parker are pleasing to look at,
neither is capable of delivering dialogue with any consistent degree of
realism.  With the characters not being realized with full power, the
storyline becomes plodding, and the movie threatens to grind to a
halt.</P>
<P>     As a romance, this movie is mildly successful.  As a tragedy, it
isn't nearly as good.  The fatal wedge in the marriage (the likelihood
that Antoinette will eventually become as insane as her mother) seems
overplayed.  One must remember that this is not a a contemporary
society and insanity was thought of much differently, but the film has
trouble presenting solid character motivation during its second half.
The relationship between Antoinette and Rochester, which was developed
with great skill, is torn down with far less concern for detail.</P>
<P>     There are a lot of sex scenes in this film, but nothing to earn it
an NC-17.  BASIC INSTINCT was as explicit, and perhaps THE LOVER even
more so--with one caveat.  There is a shot of full-frontal male nudity
in WIDE SARGASSO SEA.  That apparently is a no-no for a movie wanting
an R.  As a result, this film gets the dreaded NC-17.</P>
<P>     WIDE SARGASSO SEA is has a strong beginning.  By the time the
pacing becomes a problem, the viewer is engrossed enough that he or she
is unwilling to let go just because the story is moving slowly.  It
isn't that this is a bad movie, because it's not.  Rather, it's a
question of how powerful it could have been with lead performers who
could bolster--rather than mute--the strength of the main characters,
because the interest in Antoinette and Rochester is exclusively what
pulls the audience through the flatter parts of the story.</P>
