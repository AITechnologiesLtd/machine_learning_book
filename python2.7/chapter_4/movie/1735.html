<PRE>                   CHILDREN OF THE CORN 2: THE FINAL SACRIFICE
                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     Garrett (Terence Knox), a reporter for the WORLD ENQUIRER tabloid,
has come to Gatlin, Nebraska to investigate the mass murder of adults
by children.  It soon becomes apparent that the evil inhabiting the
corn fields is not dead, and that the vacant-eyed children are ready to
go to work again.  Aided by Red Bear (Ned Romero), Garrett must attempt
to uncover the deadly truth before another town falls victim.</P>
<P>     PET SEMATARY TWO.  THE LAWNMOWER MAN.  SLEEPWALKERS.  Now CHILDREN
OF THE CORN TWO.  These are the films of the past year to bear Steven
King's name in one capacity or another.  Although Mr. King disavows
any responsibility for all but one (SLEEPWALKERS), the movies are all
remarkably similar and unacceptably bad.  </P>
<P>     Personally, I don't believe that Hollywood has forgotten how to
make good horror films.  Rather, I think that the filmmakers would
rather go with the blood-and-gore formulas (because they sell) instead
of putting some effort into an inventive movie that might go nowhere.
However, judging by the audience reaction to this movie, that strategy
may be reaching the end of the line.</P>
<P>     Actually, watched in the right frame of mind, CHILDREN OF THE CORN
TWO can be a reasonably entertaining film--as a comedy (unintentional,
of course).  A good example of when something "horrifying" turns out to
be funny occurs early in the movie.  A man sitting in his van gets
killed by a flying corn stalk.  Javelin-like, it crashes through the
front windshield to impale him in the throat.  Tough things, those corn
stalks.</P>
<P>     The acting also provides another source of amusement.  Bad dialogue
can always be funny, but when it's uttered by respectable actors, it
turns sad.  However, in this case, the words fit the people speaking
them.  Take a look at the list of names above and see if you recognize
any of them.  Unless you're a relative, I doubt that the answer will be
yes.</P>
<P>     To be fair, there is one actor who does an adequate job.  His name
Ned Romero, and, while he wouldn't fit in with the American Indians
from DANCES WITH WOLVES, he seems to have a good time walking around 
spouting a combination of mystical wisdom and contemporary one-liners.  
This mysticism is another part of the movie's problem, since it only
manages to further confuse things.</P>
<P>     There are more plot threads and characters dropped, ignored, and
other- wise forgotten about than in any recent film.  Even the execrable
LEPRECHAUN wasn't as guilty as this.  In short, what little attempt
there is at creating a story ends up making no sense whatsoever.  </P>
<P>     The special effects are either cheap and cliched, or downright
silly.  I'm not entirely sure why they're there in the first place,
unless it's to spend a few more dollars on a project that, by having
any budget, was given too much.  With the number of high-tech movies
out these days, there's no reason to demonstrate effects that were
state-of-the-art several years ago.</P>
<P>     There's plenty of blood and gore.  After all, that's part of the
formula.  As I mentioned, some of the death scenes are quite funny.
The corn-stalk killing is one, and there's another where a man dies of
a bloody nose in the middle of church.  Of course, the
fire-and-brimstone preacher doesn't realize something is wrong until
the poor man is lying on the floor with blood fountaining all over.</P>
<P>     While I caution keeping a wide berth from CHILDREN OF THE CORN TWO,
there is an exception.  If you can wait the few months it will take for
it to come out on video, gather a large, rowdy group together, and
watch it on TV where you can yell at the screen all you want.  It may
turn out to be an entertaining experience.  On the other hand, if you
try to watch this as a serious film, you'll likely wish you were the
one to get impaled by the corn-stalk.  That way, at least you'd be out
of your misery a few minutes into this disaster.</P>
