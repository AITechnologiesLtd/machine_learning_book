<P>So you've been waiting for ages for a decent cannibal movie to come along,
eh? Well, wait no further, this one's got all the blood and horror that you
could sink your teeth into. Robert Carlyle of THE FULL MONTY and
TRAINSPOTTING (9/10), and Guy Pearce from L.A. CONFIDENTIAL
(6.5/10) (He was the square cop) star in this entertaining plate of human
hors d'oeuvres. Bon appetit!</P>
<P>PLOT:
A cowardly soldier is sent to a small village of eight in response to his
weak character. One night, a strange man falls among them with tales of
starving folks in the mountains eating one another for survival. It is only
when the villagers actually go into the hills to investigate, that they find
more than what they bargained for.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
An extremely original tasty feast of suspense, disgust and human delicacies.
If you've been waiting for an original movie to come to dinner this year,
wait no longer, because this film's got a solid premise, great actors, an
entertaining and gory story, and all the trimmings of a cannibal
movie...with laughs! This movie starts off slooooow, but once it gets going
about thirty minutes in, it doesn't let up until the last bone is licked
dry. It's even got an eerie DELIVERANCE-type, addictive score that takes the
edge off the serious tip of the film, without ever losing focus of the
drive, interest and human drama engaged in this film about men who eat one
another!!! Overall, this movie is played pretty seriously, but you can't
help but find yourself laughing at some of the extraordinary situations
presented to some of these men. Now that's finger-lickin'-good!</P>
<P>This movie is not for those who are faint of heart. In fact, I noticed a few
people shuffling out during my screening. But for all those of you who are
sick of seeing Hollywood churn out one old TV-show-into-a-movie after
another, enjoy a little bloody fun, and don't have a problem with people
discussing the benefits of eating human beings, you will most certainly
relish this flick. You might never look at a piece of steak the same way
again, but that's beside the point. All in all, this movie does take its
time to get started, slow pace and all, but once the eating begins, it's all
about sitting back, belching enjoyably, and trying to take your eyes off the
screen. Look mom, there's an arm! And there's a leg! Fun for the whole
family. Well, maybe the Addams Family.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
When this movie's first director, Milcho Manchevski was fired from the set
by Fox 2000 (as reported in Premiere magazine, May 1998), star Robert
Carlyle is reported to have personally requested that director Antonia Bird
be brought on to the project. A few months later in May 1998, shooting
resumed with Bird at the helm. Carlyle had starred in two earlier films
directed by Bird called PRIEST and FACE.
