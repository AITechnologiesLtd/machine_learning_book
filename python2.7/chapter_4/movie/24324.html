<P>_The_Big_Kahuna_ (R) *** (out of ****)</P>
<P>_The_Big_Kahuna_ is based on a play (_Hospitality_Suite_ by Roger Rueff,
who also wrote the screenplay), and first-time feature director John
Swanbeck doesn't hide that fact.  Aside from a couple of location
(Wichita, Kansas) establishing shots and fleeting detours into the
outdoors, the film is set in (as the title of the original play implies)
a hotel hospitality suite that serves as the venue of philosphical debate
between three industrial lubricant salesmen: hotshot Larry (Kevin Spacey,
who also produced), veteran Phil (Danny DeVito), and neophyte Bob (Peter
Facinelli).  Not exactly the most promising jumping-off point for an
exciting, thought-provoking drama, but that's exactly what
_The_Big_Kahuna_ evolves into. As the bickering trio's arguments shift
from business practices to how one should practice one's life in general,
Rueff's script freely confronts thorny issues of loyalty, morality, and
religion.  No easy answers are offered, but enough food for thought is
given to nourish just about any conclusions the audience may arrive at.</P>
<P>_The_Big_Kahuna_ is pretty much all talk, but the three actors bring to
the words fire, feeling, and meaning.  Spacey does a good job, but the
role of a sarcastic, flamboyant slickster is one he can easily do while
comatose.  Swanbeck is able to draw out surprising range and poise from
Facinelli, who had previously done little of note in such timeless
classics such as _Supernova_ and _Can't_Hardly_Wait_; the deeply
religious--but _not_ fanatical--Bob is the crux of the story, and
Facinelli  proves able to handle the demanding task.  His performance is
a revelation, but it's not the best; that distinction belongs to
DeVito's.  Usually called on to play the wacky person in the mix,
DeVito's world-wise and -weary Phil is a beautiful work of gentleness and
subtlety.  In a film of large ideas and screaming voices, his center of
calm speaks the loudest.</P>
