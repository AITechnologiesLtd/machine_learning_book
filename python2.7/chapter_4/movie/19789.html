<PRE>MUPPETS FROM SPACE have the funk</PRE>
<P>  In the quasi-biblical prologue to the new Muppet film, Muppets From Space,
the great Gonzo shows up just in time to be rejected from Noah's ark. He
doesn't know what species he is, and he doesn't have a female counterpart, and
basically, he's screwed. Now, one of the many important theories that I have
introduced to the field of film studies is the Puppet Rule of Comedy, which
states that some things are automatically funny as all hell when done by
puppets. One example is in Bride of Chucky, when Chucky and Tiffany make out in
front of a fireplace. Another example is in Muppets From Space, when the Old
Testament Gonzo flings his arms to the heavens and screams "Nooooooo!!!" 
  This sequence sets up a joke I will not give away, which involves Noah being
a cold hearted bastard. Watching this unfold I thought, "Good god, this is
going to be the subversive Muppet movie." But that initial impression was
wrong. The real purpose of this film is indicated quite bluntly by the next
scene, in which the entire cast of Muppets gets up in the morning and gets
ready for the day to the tune of the funk anthem "Brick House." That's right -
Muppets From Space is the funky Muppet movie.
  In an elaborate series of puppet tricks and sight gags that includes Animal
seemingly about to take a piss only to bathe himself in a toilet, the Muppets
get all the way live, get their groove on and - shit, god damn - they get off
their asses and jam. As the vocals kick in with "She was a brick - house…" Miss
Piggy steps onto the screen, sporting a modern do that, if it weren't on a foam
rubber pig, might look kinda fly. I don't know. The storyline is set in motion,
the characters are introduced and they all stay on beat. You might find
yourself nodding your head or maybe shaking your elbows a little bit.
   Unfortunately, the movie doesn't maintain this kind of energy throughout. On
the other hand, it does keep the funk anthems coming, from "Get Up Off Of That
Thang" to "It's Your Thang" to "Shining Star" (both the original and a remix by
those master architects of Paul's Boutique, the Dust Brothers).
  The actual storyline does not involve funk, but rather a Close
Encounters-like quest for Gonzo to reunite with his newly discovered alien
ancestors. They send him messages in his breakfast and strike him with
lightning, and he and various human weirdos converge on the agreed upon
coordinates for an alien encounter that, of course, involves a popular Kool and
the Gang song.
  The story isn't very strong. The original Muppet Movie is a classic largely
because you can tell that Jim Henson and his collaborators passionately
believed in their message. They really were thrilled to pieces to be pursuing a
dream with their friends, and though the movie is dripping with cornball
sentiment it never once feels false. It's the real thing, and it makes my eyes
tear up a little every time I see the ceiling inside the soundstage rip open to
reveal the real sky - "Life's like a movie, write your own ending, keep
believing, keep pretending, we've done just what we set out to doooooo…" 
  Subsequent Muppet movies, including the new one, don't come close to
duplicating this kind of enormous and overpowering warmth, so you don't really
believe in the stories. You don't care about Gonzo's quest the way you did
about Kermit's, and the villains along the way aren't as amusing - Jeffrey
Tambor doesn't work as well as a hammy main villain as he does with the dumb
sidekick roles he is known for. There are some enjoyably hokey (but weakly
executed) cameos and a good share of funny jokes, but the movie sags in the
middle. Kermit and Fozzy aren't given a whole lot to do, and Gonzo isn't as
funny when he's being sweet and sad as we remember him when he was a crazy
stuntman high on his own showmanship.
  On the other hand, there's a really good balance between old and new Muppets.
The filmmakers make good use of characters from the short lived mid '90s Muppet
Show revival, Muppets Tonight. The George Clinton-looking Clifford makes an
appearance, and there's a very funny cameo by the Italian lounge singer who's
name escapes me and his chimpanzee pal Sal. One of the best puppets is another
Muppets Tonight character, Bobo the bear, who portrays Jeffrey Tambor's
assistant Rentro. Everyone else plays themselves, which is a step in the right
direction. Recent Muppet movies, in which the Muppets acted out stories like
Treasure Island, didn't seem to work as well as the first three Muppet movies.
  The character who steals the show is Pepe, a heavily accented fluffy orange
thing who Miss Piggy calls a shrimp but who refers to himself as a king prawn.
He's another character from Muppets Tonight, and I hope we'll be seeing more of
him. 
  In fact, Pepe is crucial because he's the character who gets most deep into
the funk. During the end credits, we hear him board the Mothership to team up
with George Clinton for a remake of Parliament's "Flashlight." The dense
keyboard grooves aren't quite as slippery-slick this time around, and without
as much backing, it's clear how much more strained Clinton's voice is now than
it was in his youth. But this is still a song that can force you to dance, and
it's funny as hell to hear Dr. Funkenstein interacting with this goofy prawn.
And that in itself pretty much sums up the movie.    </P>
