***Big Daddy opens on June 25, 1999***</PRE>
<P>Adam Sandler's latest film, Big Daddy, is an unreal one that is
candy-coated with humor lifted from Sandler's previous hit, Billy
Madison, while possessing a theme of romance common to his other smash
hit, The Wedding Singer. Further amplifying the overall lack of
reality is technical faultiness, and universally poor acting, save one
supporting role.</P>
<P>Sonny Koufax (Adam Sandler) is a 32-year-old law school graduate
throwing his life away. Despite the relative success of his friends
from law school, Sonny is going nowhere in life and seems to
procrastinate everything to the nth degree. Admittedly, he hasn't been
up before 11 AM in "like 10 years" and supposedly filed for social
security at age 30.</P>
<P>The only reliable constants in Sonny's life have been girlfriend
Vanessa (Kristy Swanson) and roommate Kevin (Jon Stuart). When Kevin
prepares to move to the Far East, and Vanessa informs Sonny that their
relationship is on the rocks, Sonny becomes desperate for something to
bring stability back to his pathetic life. So when the opportunity
literally knocks at his door, he becomes a temporary parent to
five-year-old Julian (Cole and Dylan Sprouse), as part of a grander
scheme to win Vanessa over.</P>
<P>This film is a collaboration of the romance from The Wedding Singer
and the humor from Billy Madison, both financial hits for
Sandler. When Sonny realizes that Vanessa is out of the picture for
good, and starts chasing Layla (Joey Lauren Adams), the supposedly
perfect girl, the parallels to The Wedding Singer cannot be
ignored. Ever more apparent are the similarities to Billy
Madison. Both are films focusing on an adult who hasn't fully reached
his potential in life, played by Adam Sandler. Also, both feature
several scenes in a school. But most obvious are the countless
big-boy-urinating-with-little-kid-in-awkward-place jokes that are
common to both productions. Coincidentally, both films also feature a
cameo from longtime Sandler friend, Steve Buscemi.</P>
<P>Extremely poor acting, for the most part, further degrades Big Daddy's
believability. Adam Sandler was near perfect in his previous comic
productions, and should be credited fully for their success. He was
also one of the undisputed forces behind his romantic film, The
Wedding Singer, and its success. However, just as Ben and Jerry's
tasty chocolate ice cream stains the company's beautiful shirts upon
contact, Sandler's multiple talents don't homogenize either. The
outcome is a lame Sandler who never fully explodes into his uproarious
vocal humor because he is constantly trying to be a sweetheart in love
at the same time. This is best highlighted in a scene where he learns
of and meets Vanessa's new boyfriend at the same time. Quickly
realizing him to be an older man, Sandler launches into a series of
age based jokes. Yet they simply aren't funny, probably due to the
restraint necessary as a result of Julian being in the room, thus
making Sandler hold back as he attempts to display affection
simultaneously.</P>
<P>Jon Stuart's wonderful talents as a standup comedian simply don't
translate into the ability to act well in this movie. His biggest
fault may well be his habit of overemphasizing each line, as comedians
of his nature do in order to receive laughs on each punch line. This
makes him sound very much like someone deliberately reading off cue
cards, and forgetting to actually act in the process. The finest
example of this is when Stuart's character, Kevin, is in the airport
preparing to board a plane when Sonny notifies him via cell phone that
Julian has appeared out of nowhere. As he steps to the side of the
plane's boarding line and volunteers to come back to assist Kevin, he
sounds more like R2-D2 than a grown man trying to make an important
decision.</P>
<P>Big Daddy's one positive asset is Joey Lauren Adams' acting. Despite a
harsh sounding accent, she delivers a very solid, funny, and romantic
performance as the second love in Sonny's life. She even manages to
stay clear of the negative force that Sandler brings, and truly stand
out on her own. This is best exhibited in a scene pitting both of them
in a public laundry facility.  Sandler chokes on the aforementioned
deadly combination of comedy and romance, while she sticks strictly to
the latter trait and actually makes the scene worthwhile in doing so.
Chief Lighting Technician Petr Hlinomaz's inconsistency from scene to
scene further harms any feeble remains of believability that Big Daddy
may still have. Several of the film's scenes revolve around putting
Julian to bed, and occur in his bedroom. The first scene of this
nature depicts a pitch dark room that even requires a nightlight for
the young child. Not only does the nightlight disappear in the
following scenes, but the room seems to get lighter and lighter as
these scenes progress.</P>
<P>Numerous little things continue to subtract from the reality that the
film attempts to posses during its 95 minute life span. These include,
but surely aren't limited to, scenes where Sonny throws himself in
front of a moving car and fails to display so much as a bruise;
Sonny's ability to find a full scuba diving outfit and change into it
in a matter of seconds; and the ability for a grown man and little boy
to urinate on the side of a building whenever they feel the urge, and
never encounter any reprecussions.</P>
<P>As Big Daddy opens, the screen is black. Then, over the next hour and
a half, unrealistic, hard to believe, poorly acted, and technically
deficient scenes run across the screen. One performance carries with
it a ray of light, but the movie is otherwise a waste of time, a waste
of money, and a waste of 35mm film. Perhaps things would have been
better had the screen stayed black.</P>
