                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>*** (out of 4 = good)
1994, R, 110 minutes [1 hour, 40 minutes]
[drama]
starring: Paul Newman (Donald "Sully" Sullivan), Dylan Walsh (Peter
Sullivan), Bruce Willis (Carl Roebuck), Jessica Tandy (Miss Beryl), Melanie
Griffith (Toby Roebuck), produced by Scott Rudin, Arlene Donovan, written and
directed by Robert Benton, based on the novel by Richard Russo.</P>
<P>The problem with making films based on novels is that the films tend to have
a "novel" mood to them. They often seem more like actors reading straight
from the book and not feature films. "Nobody's Hero" does an excellent job in
capturing the essence of a "Great American Novel," but does this necessarily
make for a great film?</P>
<P>The story opens just before Thanksgiving in North Bath, N.Y., a small town
in the mountains covered in snow. We meet Donald "Sully" Sullivan (Newman),
and old-timer who is the town wiseass and the local mooch. He lives with Miss
Beryl (Tandy), an elderly woman, and is trying to sue his (former) employer,
Carl Roebuck (Willis) and his Tip Top Construction company, for injuries he
sustained from "work-related duties."</P>
<P>Sully seems to be desperate for cash in any way he can get it. He vows he
will never work  again, yet he can't help but go back and ask for something
to do.  Roebuck is a no-nonsense guy and knows  Sully is a good worker, but
also a slacker. Roebuck cheats on his wife but doesn't try too hard to keep
it a secret. Whenever Sully and Toby Roebuck (Griffith) see each other they
talk about how they should get back at Carl by having an affair of their own.</P>
<P>Right away the film has that "novel" atmosphere to it, where all the
characters are representations of classic personalities and themes. The
problem is they are portrayed in such a way the film almost assumes we can
understand and relate to the characters and the events, especially when it
comes to the relationship between Sully and Toby.</P>
<P>Sully meets his adult son Peter (Walsh), whom he hasn't seen since he left
his family when Peter was a child. Sully can't explain why he did it, and he
doesn't expect Peter to forgive him either. A pretty interesting relationship
begins to unfold between the two as they start to get to know each other.
They actually become close friends, which is quite interesting to watch. </P>
<P>Peter and his wife have a fight which causes her to leave and take one of
the kids with her. So Peter and Sully start to work together, scavenging
pieces of an old house in which Sully grew up in. The chemistry between Walsh
and Newman is great, they really do seem like father and son even though they
are just getting to know each other. We also see Sully taking care of his
grandchild, and Peter asks why he cares, to which Sully replies, "Well, I
gotta start somewhere."</P>
<P>Not much else happens in terms of plot. There is a subplot about a
prospective amusement park to be built near the town, but it has little to do
with the relationships between the characters. In the end Sully has grown and
matured, but he is still basically the same (the more things change the more
they stay the same).</P>
<P>So a typical novel has been made into a rather typical movie, but a pretty
good movie nevertheless. It certainly is interesting to see how these small
towns operate and to watch these characters interact with each other.
"Nobody's Fool" is a good movie about American life in a manner we don't see
that much. </P>
