<PRE>DEEP BLUE SEA
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR></PRE>
<P>Rating: *** (out of ****)
Warner Bros. / 1:45 / 1999 / R (language, shark-attack gore)
Cast: Thomas Jane; Saffron Burrows; Samuel L. Jackson, LL Cool J;
Stellan Skarsgård, Michael Rapaport, Jacqueline McKenzie; Aida Turturro
Director: Renny Harlin
Screenplay: Duncan Kennedy; Wayne Powers; Donna Powers<HR></P>
<P>For director Renny Harlin, it's good to go back in the water. Four years
after his pirate debacle "Cutthroat Island" drowned at the box office
and sank a studio - Carolco Films - Harlin is again plundering a mostly
oceanic setting in "Deep Blue Sea." The surprising result: a movie with
bite, and not just because this loud-and-proud thriller plays very much
like "Jaws" on crank. A set-up that sounds supremely goofy still allows
for plenty of monster-flick fun, from the game performances to the gory
special effects to the grisly body count.</P>
<P>Forgive "Deep Blue Sea" of its wince-inducing exposition, which makes it
seem destined for straight-to-video oblivion: Scientists aboard a
floating laboratory in the Pacific, desperately searching for an
Alzheimer's cure, have genetically enhanced mako sharks for their groovy
brain tissue, only the test subjects turn on them after inadvertently
gaining supersmarts from the experiment. Silly mortals. It's not nice to
fool Mother Nature, especially if Mother Nature is 25 feet long, 8,000
pounds heavy, irritable, fast and hungry.</P>
<P>These fierce fishies escape following an early mishap involving a
gurney, a helicopter and wet walkways that reduces the principle cast by
nearly a third and can also stand among the finest sequences Harlin has
ever helmed - which is saying a lot, given that he's also overseen some
uniquely eye-popping stunts in "Die Hard 2," "Cliffhanger" and "The Long
Kiss Goodnight." The rest of "Deep Blue Sea" takes the form of a
"Titanic"-"Jurassic Park" hybrid as our rag-tag team of heroes avoids
snack status while escaping from their slowly submerging facility.</P>
<P>Character players like Michael Rapaport, Aida Turturro and Stellan
Skarsgård are guaranteed goners as various nondescript hands, while the
great Samuel L. Jackson - the movie's sole recognizable name - caps his
stint as the study's bigshot bankroller with his typical dramatic fire.
He and Oscar always seem to be mentioned in the same breath, but not
this time. The real stories here the scary computer-generated and robot
beasties, thrilling wall-to-wall carnage and a breakthrough performance
from indie find Thomas Jane.</P>
<P>Jane - built, blonde and a Baltimore native to boot - makes for one
memorable action figure, especially in scenes where his stoic but
charismatic wrangler faces danger and returns a champ. He's the guy
audiences will most want to see pull through without becoming human
sushi, though LL Cool J rates a close second. As a religious cook who
knows his way around a kitchen, this amiable rapper-cum-actor does for
"Deep Blue Sea" what he did for "Halloween: H20" last summer - energize
an effective creep show with a comic dimension.</P>
<P>But the ringmaster of this crafty creature feature is still Harlin. He
knows when to comfortably cater to genre conventions - death-defying
dangles, close shaves, situation-appropriate kiss-off lines - and when
to stray from cliches, as evidenced by several tricks and treats thatll
take many viewers by surprise. The pinnacle of these - a sudden,
terrifying attack not, for once, foreshadowed by a stinging musical
score or a tracking camera shot - is delicious, disorienting and
altogether unexpected, just like the sum of "Deep Blue Sea."<HR></P>

"Here it is at last, the first 150-minute trailer. ‘Armageddon' is cut
together like its own highlights. Take almost any 30 seconds at random,
and you'd have a TV ad. The movie is an assault on the eyes, the ears,
the brain, common sense and the human desire to be entertained. No
matter what they're charging to get in, it's worth more to get out."
-Roger Ebert on "Armageddon"</P>
