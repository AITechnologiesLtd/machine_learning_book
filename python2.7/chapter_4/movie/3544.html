<PRE>                          CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1995 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     God, I love Tom Clancy stories.  I went to see CLEAR AND PRESENT
DANGER with high expectations and was never disappointed.  I had read
the book a few years ago when it first came out in hard cover.  I could
swear I had seen this movie before because some of the places, like in
the drug lord's home, were exactly as I had imagined them from the
book.  Heavy deja vu.</P>
<P>     Simply stated, the plot involves Latin American drug lords, covert
operations, the president, the CIA, and most of all, Jack Ryan
(Harrison Ford).  In it we have a government official testifying to
congress about something that turns about to be totally false.  After
watching the recent hearings into the tip of the Whitewater iceberg,
this show could not have been more up-to-date and relevant.  Deja vu
again.</P>
<P>     The movie is filled with several action scenes that keep you on
the edge of your seat.  My favorite is the one on Ryan's first trip to
Columbia.  Great tension.  Watch for the excellent editing by Neil
Travis and as he cuts back and forth between the good guys and the bad
guys.  The cuts and the action seem to speed up right along with your
own increased heartbeat.  The directing by Phillip Noyce showed a real
understanding on how to bring a Clancy movie to the screen with maximum
tension and suspense.</P>
<P>     Other than Clancy's story, what makes this movie really click is
Harrison Ford.  I found myself reflecting on how smart it was for the
studio to drop Alec Baldwin after the first Clancy movie (THE HUNT FOR
RED OCTOBER) and replace him with Ford playing Ryan.  Baldwin is fine
in pretty boy roles (his best was in MIAMI BLUES), but he is out of his
depth playing Ryan who is a complex and always highly vulnerable
character.</P>
<P>     Some of the supporting characters were great.  My favorite was
William Defoe as the CIA operative.  One of his best roles I think.
Anne Archer was wasted on the other hand.  She played a wife who was
basically "there."</P>
<P>     My only complain with CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER was that at 2 hours
and 16 minutes, it was way too short!  There was a lot of material that
was included but stuck in too abruptly by the screenwriters, John
Milius, Donald L.  Stewart, and Steven Zaillian, and not developed
enough.  A good example is the part of the FBI leader's secretary.  4
hours would have been perfect, but it would not have made much money.
3 hours would have been a better compromise I think, but then again, I
am not a multimillionaire movie mogul so why should they take my
advice.</P>
<P>     It is rated PG-13 for violence, and I agree with the rating.  I
think teenagers will love this show as did I.  I highly recommend it
and award it *** 1/2.<HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</P>
