BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>One of the great paradoxes of American history is in the
fact that Hollywood in 1950s - era usually associated with
Cold War hysteria, McCarthy witch hunts, demonisation of any
nonconformist thought and Hollywood blacklists -brought many
great, groundbreaking films that actually challenged
self-righteous view of USA as the greatest nation in the
world. Those films exposed some dark, unflattering truths
about American society by pointing towards some burning
problems previously swept under the carpet. One of those
problems was, of course, racism as most visible violation of
noble American ideas about equal rights for all of its
citizens. Racism was also responsible for the most shameful
episode in the American involvement in WW2 - forced
internment of Japanese Americans. One of the first Hollywood
films to speak about this embarrassing issue was BAD DAY AT
BLACK ROCK, 1955 thriller directed by John Sturges.</P>
<P>The film begins in 1945, few months after the end of WW2.
Black Rock is small Arizona town, so small and insignificant
that passenger train never stops there. When it stops it is
big news, especially when the passenger stepping off is
mysterious one-armed stranger named McCreedy (played by
Spencer Tracy). McCreedy's presence alone is enough to cause
suspicion by townspeople and open animosity by local cowboy
goons. McCreedy would earn even more hostility when he
starts inquiring about Japanese farmer who used to live in
Black Rock before the war. Reno Smith (played by Robert
Ryan), rich farmer and the only real authority in town, is
especially upset over stranger's inquiry. McCreedy is being
told that the Japanese farmer was "relocated" after the war,
but he suspects something more sinister and that some
townspeople, including Smith, had something to do with it.
His suspicions are validated when he realises that Smith and
his goons don't want him to leave Black Rock alive.</P>
<P>BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK is often referred as companion piece
to HIGH NOON. Those two films have many things in common -
setting in small Western town, populated with hypocrites and
cowards; lone protagonist who would risk his life over noble
principles; suspense created with certainty of inevitable
showdown; relatively short length. Unfortunately, John
Sturges could hardly compete with directorial skills of Fred
Zinnemann while screenwriter Don McGuire couldn't repeat the
complexity of Carl Foreman's HIGH NOON script and its
characters. BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK looks promising in the
beginning, though. Sturges withholds information from the
viewers. When McCreedy steps off the train, dressed in
black, his presence is menacing and his motives unclear.
Spencer Tracy excellently plays this character by slowly
building our confidence with grace, dignity, intelligence
and confidence. It is real pleasure watching how Tracy
outsmarts those who want to trick him and how he handles
those who want to intimidate him. By showing growingly
hostile reaction of the people like Smith and always
reminding us of the hopelessness of McCreedy's situation,
Sturges slowly builds the suspense. Unfortunately, it all
begins to fall apart in the second part of the film, when
the mystery is revealed and all sides begin preparations for
inevitable final conflict. Instead of action, we are given
sermons and McCreedy, who is shown as man who can take care
of himself, actually talks his way out of bad situation.
Some of the lines spoken by characters are powerful, but
unrealistic, hardly expected from people who spent all their
lives as ordinary, blue-collar inhabitants in small desert
towns. That is especially so with character of Smith, played
by Robert Ryan, who seems somewhat too refined for simple
redneck bigot. Final showdown is also ruined with
unnecessary melodramatic plot twist.</P>
<P>Perhaps the worst flaw of BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK is lack of
courage in handling whole embarrassing affair with Japanese
Americans in WW2. Don McGuire uses euphemism of "relocation"
for the event that was actually nothing less than
state-sponsored ethnic cleansing (Interestingly enough, when
Croatian and Serbian intellectuals in early 1990s propagated
ethnic cleansing as the only solution of Yugoslav crisis,
they also used euphemism called "humane resettlement").
Racism, that was the prime motivating factor of such event,
is never attributed to the system itself; instead, racism
and bigotry is something that should be attributed only to
few rotten individuals like Smith. General population, which
gave tacit support to ethnic cleansings and holocausts of
this world, either by looking the other way or enjoying the
fruits of someone else's dirty work, is actually forgiven in
this film. McGuire, on the other hand, redeems himself by
using this opportunity to expose rarely seen economic
motivation for racial, ethnic and religious hatred - Smith
did what he did because he wanted someone else's property.
What is really sad about this film is the fact that the
events portrayed in it don't belong to dark pages of history
- BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK can still teach us a lot about the
world we still live in.</P>
