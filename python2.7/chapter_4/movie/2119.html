<P>     It's New York City in the 1870s, a society ruled by expectations
and propriety, where a hint of immorality can bring scandal and ruin.
This is an America every bit as Victorian as her contemporary England.
Into this world arrives Countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer), a
woman who has spent much of her life in Europe and is now escaping from
a disastrous marriage.  Her initial adult meeting with Newland Archer
(Daniel Day-Lewis) is sedate--he is engaged to her cousin May (Winona
Ryder)--but there is a subtle fire smouldering from the first glance.
From that point on, Archer's dilemma becomes painfully clear--proceed
with what society deems proper and marry the rather vapid May, or allow
his heart and passions to carry him far from the realm of what is
conventionally acceptable.</P>
<P>     I rarely discuss the Oscar potential of a film, the Academy being
notably fickle, but THE AGE OF INNOCENCE is ripe for not only a best
picture nomination, but perhaps the award itself.  It's difficult to
say, considering the possible contenders (REMAINS OF THE DAY, for
example, isn't out yet, and MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING shouldn't lightly be
ignored), but this movie certainly has to be in the running.</P>
<P>     Martin Scorsese has made a reputation out of making movies that
show a profound perceptiveness of human nature through their images of
toughness and violence.  On the surface, one would be hard-pressed to
find a story more unlike RAGING BULL and GOODFELLAS than THE AGE OF
INNOCENCE, which seems better suited to a Merchant-Ivory production.
However, Scorsese has placed his indelible stamp on this picture, not
only through the camerawork, but in the potent tension that builds
between the three complex main characters.  For while blood has often
been Scorsese's method, the characters, and what exists between and
within them, have always been his ends.</P>
<P>     THE AGE OF INNOCENCE is a sumptuous motion picture, a feast for
the senses.  The colors are vivid, from the red and yellow of roses to
the flashes of crimson and white that transition scenes.  The powerful
score moves along with the story, in perfect counterpoint to the
visuals--never intrusive, but always effective.  The scenes of
artfully-prepared meals are enough to make mouths water, and it's
almost possible to smell the pungent aroma of cigars.  In these
elements of the film, Scorsese was ably assisted by contributions from
composer Elmer Bernstein and cinematographer Michael Ballhaus.</P>
<P>     Even had the story been a throw-away, this movie would have been
worth seeing simply for its splendor.  The set design and costumes are
flawless, and the audience is legitimately transported to the
nineteenth- century (through the help of Troy, NY, where the principal
filming was done, and the Philadelphia Academy of Music, which doubled
as a New York opera house).  This is not some mere token attempt to
conjure up images of times past; Scorsese has put so much effort into
the illusion that those who didn't know better would be willing to
swear that he had discovered a time capsule.</P>
<P>     There are so many memorable images in this film that it's tough to
pick out a few, but three stood out most prominently for me:  the Saul
Bass opening credits with their unfolding flowers; a panoramic view of
a snowy New York in the 1870s; and a long, lingering shot of a
lighthouse, a sailboat, and Michelle Pfeiffer in silhouette.</P>
<P>     Of course, there is a story, and an impressive one at that.  All
the action is character-driven, and there's very little to satisfy
those who demand a fast-paced picture, but the currents of THE AGE OF
INNOCENCE run deep and dangerous.  The movie eschews the formulas of
Hollywood and succeeds brilliantly on its own merits.</P>
<P>     Adapting from the 1921 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Edith
Wharton (who also wrote ETHAN FROME, a similar story of love and loss,
which reached American screens earlier this year), Martin Scorsese and
Jay Cocks have managed to successfully incorporate the complex conflict
of emotion against societal pressures which lies at the heart of THE
AGE OF INNOCENCE.  Those watching the movie will understand that it is
no easy task to resurrect a code of behavior long dead and buried.</P>
<P>     Each of the actors, whether their parts are major or minor,
deserves praise aplenty.  There isn't a single instance of overacting
in this film, every role being carried out with unrivaled aplomb.  Even
those with decidedly limited screen time, such as Jonathan Pryce and
Robert Sean Leonard, manage to make an impact--and that's not an easy
task considering the puissance of the main three performances.</P>
<P>     Daniel Day-Lewis never fails to impress, even when he appears in a
poor film.  For the most part, however, he has chosen good roles, and
his presence in a movie often lifts the production to another level.
Would LAST OF THE MOHICANS have been as stunning without him?  Would MY
LEFT FOOT have been as poignant?</P>
<P>     Day-Lewis immerses himself in the character of Newland Archer, and
it's no great stretch for the audience to accept him.  This is not
merely a good performance--it's an unforgettable one.  Yet even
considering what Day-Lewis has done, he does not upstage either of his
leading ladies--at least not too often.</P>
<P>     I have never subscribed to the widely-held belief that Michelle
Pfeiffer is a ravishing beauty.  In fact, in THE AGE OF INNOCENCE, she
looks rather plain (an impression that, in my opinion, heightened the
impact of the story).  Ellen is exotic, certainly, but beautiful?
Nevertheless, there is no denying the stirring, heartfelt passion of
Ms. Pfeiffer's performance.  Outstripping anything she has done in the
past, the role of Ellen can truly be considered a pinnacle.</P>
<P>     Winona Ryder isn't as good, but that's nothing to be ashamed of.
This is a far better actress than the one we saw in DRACULA.  There's
no wringing of hands, no tears, and--most thankfully of all--no
instances of going over-the-top.  Ms. Ryder's May is quiet, demure, and
easily relegated to the background--just as she should be.</P>
<P>     Often, voiceovers detract mightily from a motion picture, but
Joanne Woodward's narration of THE AGE OF INNOCENCE serves only to
increase the viewer's enjoyment of the film.  It's appropriately
placed, perfectly worded, and reveals subtleties that the visual
medium cannot easily convey.  Instead of standing out, Ms. Woodward's
speeches blend seamlessly in.</P>
<P>     There are few films this year that I recommend as heartily as THE
AGE OF INNOCENCE, which has the rare distinction of being more of a
cinematic experience than a simple movie.  Something that transcends
the medium like this shouldn't be set aside for viewing on the small
screen.  For those who expect more from their films that a lot of bangs
and flashes, THE AGE OF INNOCENCE is not to be missed.</P>
