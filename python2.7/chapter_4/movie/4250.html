<P>     The most imaginative part of MALLRATS comes with its opening
credits, which are blatantly sexual comic book pictures--and that's
not too imaginative either.</P>
<P>     The biggest laugh in MALLRATS, from an audience of 11-12-year-olds
assembled in rows 15 and 16, came when the two protagonists-buddies
consult a fortune teller who bares her top and exhibits three nipples.
(Number Three, of course, is a fake, but the boys are taken in).  Even
then, it was only size 4 or 5 laughter on a scale of 1 to 10.</P>
<P>     The view of American youth in MALLRATS tries to be funny, which it
isn't.  It might have been a satire of slackers and mall culture but it
isn't that either.  It's plain dull and just a series of nails in the
American coffin.</P>
<P>     The filmmaker is Kevin Smith, whose feature writer-director debut
was CLERKS, an original, plotless comedy of people in and around a
convenience and a video store.  The absurdist, slice-of-life,
desultorily conversational and pointedly scatological CLERKS was a hit,
though I had my reservations about it.  MALLRATS, done in the same
spirit and with some of the same actors (Smith himself playing Silent
Bob), is a flop.</P>
<P>     It has something of a plot, vague and disjointed.  T.S. (notice
the scatology of the name) (Jeremy London) has been dumped by his
fiancee Brandi (Claire Forlani) for reasons too dull to mention.
Brodie (Jason Lee), has been dumped by his girl Rene (Shannen Doherty)
because, in bed,  he is more interested in video-games than in sex.
(Let's not even talk about love).  The two men (men?) find solace in
doing what any red-blooded idiots will do.  They go to the Mall.
There, a subplot has them trying to sabotage that day's forthcoming
game show, a kind of Dating Game, which is produced by Brandi's father,
a youthful but bald creep.</P>
<P>     The movie's comedy is below sitcom level, the dialogue, action and
characters are of no interest, except perhaps to people under twenty
with a mental age under six.  Since those people neither read film
reviews nor put any credence in adult judgments, MALLRATS might just
have a career, even though it is exceptionally thin and dull in every
way.</P>
<P>     The best that can be said is that, at the mall, Smith places a fat
young man who stares at a sort of pointillist painting which, looked at
with concentration, reveals a sailboat.  But the poor fellow stands
there and stands there and can't see a thing.  Not a bad gag, though
thoroughly milked.</P>
<P>     Another "funny" item is about a fifteen-year old girl who is
presumably so bright that she's a senior.  She is writing a book about
orgasms and researches by sleeping with men right and left and
videotaping the activities.  Her language is raunchy even by  Kevin
Smith standards, standards that use the alphabet from the A-word to
perhaps some Z-word, though the N-word is not heard.</P>
<P>     The fun and games are uncoordinated and slipshod.  The film might
have used updated Marx Brothers strategies instead of applying a
para-CLERKS style which relies on frail crutches instead of tempo,
energy or the occasional witticism.</P>
<P>     There are also other inconsistencies.  In her letter of
resignation, so to speak, Brodie's girl lists his defects.  Brodie
thinks that "callow" is the only nice thing in the letter, yet he will
occasionally use a hi-fallutin' word.  We also think for a long time
that Brodie and Co. are high-schoolers, but are told at the end that
they are college students.</P>
<P>     Somehow, comic-book author and icon Stan Lee shows up, gives sage
advice to Brodie.  It might have been amusing, it is merely
artificial.  And here and there are tentative take-offs, but these do
not take off.</P>
