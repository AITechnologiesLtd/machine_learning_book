<P>A masterful French rib-tickler is the best farce of the year. It  has 
also earned a major BQ award by the BBNMM Foundation -- which has no 
statutes, dues, newsletters or meetings. BQ stands for 
Brevity+Quality. Its symbol is a burrito, a small donkey.. BBNMM 
means Bring Back the Ninety Minute Movie.</P>
<P>Hollywood remakes of films are big business. Most of those are of 
earlier Hollywood movies. Next come French movies, especially 
comedies. Within this category, Francis Veber--the playwright, 
scriptwriter and film director-- has been involved in a record number 
of remakes. He directed some of them: The Toy, The Goat, Three 
Fugitives, etc.  He Americanized several of his own scenarios  : A 
Pain in the A... became Buddy, Buddy; The Tall Blond Man with One 
Black Shoe became The Man with One Red shoe; La Cage aux Folles 
became The Birdcage; My Father the Hero kept its title;  Les Comperes 
became Father's Day, and others.</P>
<P>Francis Veber's play Le Diner de Cons was a boulevard play in Paris 
(roughly, the equivalent of a Broadway), and a huge hit.  Opening in 
1993, it had a run of hundreds of performance over two-plus years to 
four (depending on the source). Jacques Villeret played Mr. Pignon, 
as he does in the film version. The movie adaptation is almost 
totally faithful to the stage-play which it airs out minimally and 
sagaciously.</P>
<P>The film was also a smash-hit in France in 1998.  Its huge public 
came second only to Titanic's. It is almost ironical that this 
unspectacular, David-sized farce, was the main competitor to a 
behemoth, a Goliath among productions.</P>
<P>The major difference from stage to screen is that the American title 
was toned down to The Dinner Game. The French title translates as The 
Dinner of Idiots.  Literally "con" has a sexual meaning but it is 
used overwhelmingly with no vulgar connotation, since its  stands for 
"a fool, an imbecile, a creep, an idiot, an obnoxious man" and such. 
"Game" will do nicely, however.</P>
<P>The game --said to have been played by some in real life-- is this. A 
bunch of well-heeled, aging yuppies and practical jokers (farceurs, 
in French), meet regularly for dinner. They keep on the lookout for 
some poor benighted soul, a dum-dum, nitwit,  fool of some kind who, 
unsuspectingly, will entertain them at his expense. Whoever 
discoverers the biggest fool wins a prize. It is a cruel game, but 
then farce can be a cruel genre.</P>
<P>Publisher and man about town Pierre Brochant thinks that he has found 
the ultimate idiot in the person of Francois Pignon. (Pignon, is a 
funny name in French, and  discreetly symbolic, like those of some 
other characters. This aspect is lost on non-native speakers but 
that's of minor importance).</P>
<P>Pignon is employed at the Finance Ministry, which also, like our IRS, 
is in charge of taxes. This means that it deals with tax-evasion  and 
cheating, which makes it a menace to the perpetrators. But short, 
stout and moon-faced Pignon is a nice, sweet, simple fellow whose 
pride and joy is the building of scale models of important buildings, 
statues, bridges and the like, with matches and glue.</P>
<P>Brochant invites, sight unseen, the naive,  overwhelmed Pignon who 
comes to Brochant's ritzy apartment, so that the publisher can take 
his discovery to the group dinner. But hours before Pignon's arrival, 
Brochant, while playing golf, badly twisted his back and can hardly 
make it to the reunion. How sad! (Although the un-realism of farce 
makes  even back-sufferers laugh).  Pignon turns out to be better 
than anyone's wildest dreams, a world-class champion among fools.</P>
<P>The two men will never make it to the dinner. Brochant, after his 
initial amazement and hilarity at the little man's personality, will 
attempt repeatedly to get rid of him. Not only the bad back tortures 
him, but also Mrs. Brochant's call that she had left her spouse.</P>
<P>The news spread fast, followed by other, often hilarious 
complicationss that involve other characters too. All this in the 
presence of Pignon whom Brochant simply cannot shake off. Solicitous, 
kind-hearted, understanding Pignon whose own wife had abandoned him 
two years ago, is bent on being helpful. But whatever this 
well-meaning born bungler does or says -- to anyone --only worsens 
the mess and the confusions.</P>
<P>At various points, Brochant willy-nilly uses the services of his 
guest. Yet as soon as something positive emerges from this odd 
couple's collaboration, it is transformed by the well-meaning Pignon 
into a new screw-up.  Eventually, when he discovers to his utter 
sadness the truth about his dinner invitation, he generously 
continues his attempts to assist Brochant, whose meanness is exposed 
and who begins to feel guilty.</P>
<P>Pignon, in short, is that old and none-too-rare character, a Holy 
Fool. But clever Veber, instead of lapsing into sentimentality keeps 
his cynical-satirical edge alive to the very last scene.</P>
<P>Essentially the movie is "simply" about two men,  a speakerphone and 
an answering machine. Not so simply, in a main setting which is not a 
bit claustrophobic, it adjoins to the two anti-heroes a handful of 
perfectly and economically used comparses</P>
<P>Most memorable is Cheval (horse, in French) Pignon's colleague and 
friend, a sanguine, jolly fellow enlisted to help Brochant-- but he's 
also a bloodhound tax inspector ... and Brochant has not declared his 
collection of art.</P>
<P>( Could the name Cheval also be an in-joke, a reference to the 
real-life postman Cheval whose "naive" sculptures remind you of 
Douanier Rousseau's paintings and Antoni Gaudi's work?)</P>
<P>Veber's inventiveness is superb. He is clearly an inheritor of that 
greatest of all farce playwrights, Georges Feydeau (1862-1921)  whose 
wild comedies of La Belle Epoque (mostly bedroom farces and variants, 
and still revived in France and abroad), are the funniest imaginable. 
These are merciless yet un-cruel satires, splendidly timed and 
dialogued, minutely plotted, absurdist within realistic frames, and 
built with the precision of the best Swiss chronographs.</P>
<P>At his best, Veber shares those traits. Also like Feydeau, even when 
dealing with potentially scabrous set-ups and send-ups, he maintains 
a certain elegance, old-fashioned yet updated to late 20th century 
mores and manners but neither vulgar nor gross-out, the way film 
comedy increasingly is.</P>
<P>Though well subtitled, The Dinner Game's dialogue cannot have the 
full humor and impact of the spoken lines. Nor is the opening song 
untransalted. And, on the phone,  Pignon's "Belgian" accent 
--something the French think is most funny-- as he pretends to be a 
movie producer (don't ask), of course does not come through to 
non-Francophone audiences. In my case, the only unbelievability was 
the easy parking of cars before Brochant's chic building -- a miracle 
in choked up Paris.</P>
<P>There is, however, a mother lode of reparteee, gags, and qui pro quos 
that come through with absolute clarity. The proof of this is that 
Veber plans a Hollywood version of the picture, as The Schmuck's 
Dinner, most likely starring (shudder) Robin Williams.</P>
