<P>"Say it! Say that you love me! You better make me
believe it. Your life depends on it."</P>
<P>Starring Angelina Jolie, Antonio Banderas, Thomas
Jane. Directed by Michael Cristofer. Rated R.</P>
<P>It's been a while since Hollywood has come out with a
really good, sultry, steamy, shameless melodrama. I'm
not a fan of the genre, but an occasional entry can be
a terrific guilty pleasure. So I found myself looking
forward to Original Sin, the year's most bad-mouthed
studio release. But while it's sultry, steamy and
shameless, it is not, unfortunately, really good.</P>
<P>The story concerns Luis Vargas (Antonio Banderas), a
rich coffee merchant who has procured a mail-order
bride from Delaware. When the woman, named Julia
Russell (Angelina Jolie), arrives, Vargas is surprised
to find that she looks nothing like the picture he
received. Russell covers himself by saying that, since
she is quite the looker, she sent a picture of her
sister to make sure that her man wasn't interested in
her solely because of her "pretty face." This is hint
number one that Julia is Not What She Seems, and it is
followed by a mysterious trunk that she just can't
open, a sister she neglects to write to, and a
mysterious private detective who appears out of
nowhere. Of course, Luis is too dense to pick up on
any of this.</P>
<P>The only suspense generated here isn't whether Julia
will take the money and run, it's how soon she will do
it. Turns out that it's about halfway through, and
Luis's complete astonishment at that point is truly
laughable. There have been idiotic protagonists
before, but I think this transcends all boundaries.</P>
<P>This is about when the movie stops being at all
interesting, even in a cheesy so-bad-it's-good way. To
have effective melodrama, you need at least one
character that the audience can identify with; in the
heated, violent confrontations between the two
pro/antagonists that occur in Original Sin's second
half, I disliked them both. Jolie's character is a
scoundrel and Banderas is a vengeful jerk, and a dense
one at that. Their mental tug-of-war is rendered
pointless, because I would just as soon see their
hotel room on fire with them in it than see either one
of them win.</P>
<P>It doesn't help that director Michael Cristofer (Body
Shots) isn't really competent; his camerawork too
often resembles an actual daytime soap opera (I don't
know if he has any experience in the field, but this
wouldn't be out of place at 1 pm on ABC). He does
things like cutting between different shots of the
same scene from the same angle, a bizarre eye-roller
of a camera trick that pretentiously calls attention
to itself. And when he does it during a sex scene,
it's downright absurd.</P>
<P>But for all its shortcomings -- and there are
countless -- Original Sin does have a redeeming
factor, and it's a big one. Angelina Jolie can make us
believe the most farfetched dialogue and rise above
any material she is given. There's also, of course,
the fact that she provides a reason for just about
everyone on the XY side of the chromosomal map to
shell out eight bucks.</P>
<P>Aside from that, nothing to see here. I can't sit here
and write that I was bored -- I was either laughing
derisively, awaiting Cristofer's next demonstration of
ineptitude, or ogling at the aforementioned member of
the cast -- but this isn't a good movie by any stretch
of the imagination. I'm still hard-pressed to tell you
to stay away. </P>
