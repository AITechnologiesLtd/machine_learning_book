MEMENTO
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>A disease like diabetes can be treated with insulin, but, for a severe 
short-term memory loss problem, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce, L.A. 
CONFIDENTIAL) turns to more unusual aids than drugs, namely Polaroid 
pictures, a ballpoint pen to write notes on his skin and a mass of 
memory-jogging tattoos.  </P>
<P>Christopher Nolan's MEMENTO is easily the most bizarrely original film 
since BEING JOHN MALKOVICH.  Opening with the Polaroid picture of a 
murdered body, the movie shows the photo slowly undevelop and shoot back 
into the camera.  This turns out to be the ending of the story.  The 
movie skips backwards and forwards thereafter with pieces of scenes 
being repeated, showing more context each time.  The viewers find 
themselves absolutely mesmerized as they piece together this film which 
is like a jigsaw puzzle of an Escher print in which pieces keep 
disappearing and reappearing.  Flaunting its ambiguity, almost every 
scene is open to alternate interpretations.  And each new scene adds 
combinatorial possibilities to the explanations of previous scenes.  
People who like puzzles will adore this movie, as will all moviegoers 
who relish intelligent scripts that challenge their gray matter.</P>
<P>One of the many questions that the film poses is whether Leonard killed 
the right man, the man who raped and murdered his wife and who caused 
his infamous accident.  After the blow to his head caused by his wife's 
murderer, Leonard has a short-term memory that lasts only seconds.  He 
remembers everything before the accident but nothing after.  This makes 
a man who knows who he was but not who he is.  It also makes him prey to 
the unscrupulous.  Spit in his beer, or much worse, and a minute later 
he will remember nothing about the incident.</P>
<P>Leonard takes pictures of his car and his motel so that he will be able 
to find them.  On these visual note cards, he also makes important 
written notes to himself.  On Teddy's (Joe Pantoliano) picture, for 
example, he reminds himself not to believe his lies.  He no longer 
remembers what caused him to record this warning and how accurate it 
might be.  His body is a walking billboard of personal reminders to 
himself.  In mirror image across his chest, he has written, "John G. 
raped and murdered my wife."  And on his arm, he has tattooed, "Don't 
answer the phone."  As Leonard says, "Memory is treachery."</P>
<P>Told in heavy narration, the most common question Leonard finds himself 
asking is, "Where am I?"  One of the places he finds himself waking is 
in the bed of Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss, THE MATRIX), whose place in his 
life changes as rapidly as does Teddy's.  Trying to fit these two into 
Leonard's story becomes a fascinating exercise for the audience as the 
story keeps doubling back on itself.</P>
<P>Although an edge-of-the-seat thriller, it is frequently quite funny.  
Leonard wakes in his cheap motel one morning to find a gun in the drawer 
next to the Gideon Bible and a guy tied up in the closet.  When Teddy 
asks him about whether the gun belongs to him or the guy in closet, 
Leonard says, "Must have been his.  I don't think they'd let someone 
like me own a gun."</P>
<P>The film also contains an intriguing back story about Leonard.  It seems 
that before he went bonkers, he was an insurance investigator.  One of 
the claims he looked into was from the wife of a guy named Sammy 
(Stephen Tobolowsky), who had the same type short-term memory loss 
problem that Leonard developed.  Serving both as a story in its own 
right and as a mechanism to explain Leonard's illness, this is one of 
the best subplots in a long time.</P>
<P>Although it is a brilliantly conceived and executed movie, there are a 
few disappointments: the ending is a bit of a letdown and the film would 
have been crisper if the storyline had had a few less iterations.  These 
are minor quibbles, and this is the sort of picture that is so 
engrossing that you'll want to come back and see it again soon.  
Probably a couple of times more.</P>
<P>MEMENTO runs 1:48.  It is rated R for violence, language and some drug 
content and would be acceptable for most teenagers.</P>
