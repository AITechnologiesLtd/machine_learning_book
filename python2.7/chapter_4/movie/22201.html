<PRE>54
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Ryan Phillippe; Salma Hayek; Sela Ward; Breckin Meyer & Sherry
Stringfield</P>
<P>54 focuses around the character of Shane O'Shea, played by Ryan Phillippe,
and how his life takes a dramatic turn after he becomes an employee of New
York's infamous nightclub, Studio 54, during the 1970's. The fictitious
story of the Phillippe character that is quite weak, but the interesting
look at the fact-based events at the club more than made up for the
weaknesses of the main character. I actually didn't expect a whole lot going
in, so I was very surprised at how good 54 really was.</P>
<P>Mike Myers is brilliant as Studio 54's owner, Steve Rubell -- I had to
actually remind myself a couple of times that I was watching Myers and not
the real Steve Rubell. Salma Hayek and Neve Campbell fans will be
disappointed. While both actresses are featured prominently in the ads for
the movie, their parts are really nothing more than fairly minor supporting
roles. The film's unlikely star, Phillippe (I Know What You Did Last
Summer), is not a bad actor, although I'm not sure if he would have been
able to carry the movie if it weren't for the 70's atmosphere. It kept my
attention most of the time, thereby minimizing the possibility of catching
any deficiencies in his performance. Also helping Phillippe was the fact
that the entire supporting cast was strong. While Myers and Campbell have
limited roles in this film, they do add significantly to it. Hayek isn't bad
for the most part, but there are a couple of scenes where she is a bit
painful to watch.</P>
<P>I have to admit it -- I actually enjoyed listening to all of the 70's disco
music. I feel I should be attending some sort of group therapy session after
owning up to that. Although I am happy to say that I still think that
everybody in the seventies had to be on some serious drugs for them to
actually go out in public dressed like they did. I must say that after
watching 54, I really wished that the club were still open. It looked like
it was a hell of a party. I think 54 captured the reason the club became the
hot spot that it was during the late 70's and early 80's. Sure, the
fictitious story of Phillippe's character was not great, but just the
atmosphere and look of the movie really did make me feel as though I was
actually there experiencing the party times at 54 during a more carefree and
swinging era. I'm sure another Mike Myers' character, Austin Powers, would
have approved. Worth checking out if only for the interesting look into the
world of the beautiful people in the 70's.</P>
