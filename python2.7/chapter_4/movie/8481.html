<PRE>A movie review by Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>Family film entertainment like any other form of movie presentation is judged
differently by different people and while some films aimed directly at
children are unappealing to older teenagers and full grown adults, I must
admit that as an adult I absolutely loved 'Air Bud'.
Cynics who believe that family films are too cute to be considered 'serious'
entertainment are entitled to their opinion but 'Air Bud' is an extremely
well crafted movie with an admittedly worn out but sometimes refreshing
reminder that dog really is man's best friend. There are no special effects
in this movie using computer generated pretender devices but rather a golden
retreiver with a snout for sinking basketballs with a ration of close to
100%.  I'm sure he's missed a few shots in real life but in the movie he has
a talent that is harnessed in the right place at the right time.</P>
<P>The film begins with a clown (Michael Jeter) who uses his feeble skills in an
attempt to entertain children but he is terrible at his profession and
birthday parties only become perky when he introduces kids to his golden
retreiver, Buddy who performs tricks to the delight of the youngsters.  He is
a cruel and abusive owner and Buddy's cage falls off his pick up truck on the
way home one day and Buddy is free and becomes adopted by a young boy named
Josh (Kevin Zegers).  Their friendship unfolds rather slowly until trust is
developed and Josh begins to play with Buddy using his basketball.  The
procedure is simple: toss a ball to Buddy and his snout will knock the ball
up and into the net everytime.  Josh is also trying to make it on the
school's basketball team and doesn't have much luck with a hard edged coach
who is eventually fired and replaced by the school's janitor who used to be a
pro basketball player for the New York Knicks back in the 1950's.  Buddy
becomes the team's mascot as Josh joins the team and the new coach teaches
values and principles to Josh which he applies accordingly.</P>
<P>Actor turned director Charles Martin Smith (you remember him as Toad in
'American Graffiti' and as the accountant Oscar Wallace in 1987's 'The
Untouchables') does a wonderful job capturing expressions from the dog's
every move and builds a bondable story utilizing the animal to stand out from
all the humans.  It's intelligently made and can be enjoyed by the youngest
child and the oldest adult.  It's a movie free of corporate advertising and
marketing at fast food restaurants and that's rare for a Disney production so
they deserve high marks for this one and it's probably the best Disney
production since 1994's 'Angels in the Outfield'.  In a summer of explosions,
special effects and rare family entertainment, 'Air Bud' is a pleasant,
harmless and emotional comfort which is no classic but is a film that I hope
becomes passed down along with other quality films such as 'Babe', 'Aladdin'
and 'The Lion King'.</P>
