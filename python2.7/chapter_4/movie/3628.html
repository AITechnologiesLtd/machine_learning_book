<P>     The title of this film, THE ENGLISHMAN WHO WENT UP A HILL BUT CAME 
DOWN A MOUNTAIN, is so long that it can function as a plot synopsis in 
its own right.  "The Englishman" in question is British cartographer 
Reginald Anson, played by Hugh Grant with his usual aw-shucks charm, and 
"the hill/mountain" is Ffynnon Garw, a 984-foot high protuberance in the 
Welsh terrain.  In 1917, as World War One is winding to a conclusion, 
Anson arrives in Wales with his commanding officer, George Garrad (Ian 
McNeice), to survey Ffynnon Garw's height.  When the mountain is 
measured at less than the 1000 feet necessary for official recognition 
as more than a hill, the locals are up in arms.  Horrified by the 
thought that the "first mountain in Wales" might be considered anything 
less than grand, they decide to build a twenty foot high dirt mound at 
the summit, then get the measurement repeated.  As an inducement to keep 
the two Englishmen in town until the construction is complete, a young 
woman, Betty of Cardiff (Tara Fitzgerald), is called upon to use all her 
wiles and charms.  And, just in case Betty isn't persuasive enough, the 
visitors' car is sabotaged.</P>
<P>     It's rare that a movie owes this much of its success to its 
director and stars.  The storyline for THE ENGLISHMAN isn't all that 
dynamic and the screenplay is rather bland.  However, using the acting 
skills and natural charisma of Hugh Grant, Tara Fitzgerald, and Colm 
Meaney, director Christopher Monger has compiled a wonderfully droll 
comedy.  For the most part, the humor is witty, not laugh-aloud funny.  
Chuckles and smiles can be expected, but not explosive guffaws.  THE 
ENGLISHMAN is low-key in all aspects, from the comic elements to the 
love story.</P>
<P>     Frankly, Grant and Fitzgerald (who were also paired in John 
Duigan's erotic SIRENS) do a lot more with the relationship than the 
script provides.  Without the chemistry between them, this part of the 
movie would have been a complete throw-away, limiting the production's 
appeal.  Love, after all, makes for the perfect icing on Ffynnon Garw's 
cake.</P>
<P>     The supporting cast, comprised primarily of character actors, is 
solid.  Colm Meaney, best known to American audiences from his work in 
two STAR TREK series, plays a self-serving pub owner who advocates 
adding to the mountain so he can sell beer to the thirsty workers.  
Kenneth Griffith is wonderful as the crotchety old reverend who sees 
Ffynnon Garw's height as a matter of theological importance.  Ian 
McNeice finds the right mix of pomposity and superciliousness as Garrad, 
and Robert Pugh plays a far less menacing role than the one he took on 
in PRIEST (where he was an incestuous father).</P>
<P>     THE ENGLISHMAN is framed as a true story told to a child and, as 
was the case with THE PRINCESS BRIDE, this is the best way to establish 
the somewhat fanciful narrative.  The picture has some things to say 
about the importance of community and the desultory effects of war, but 
its primary concern is lightening the heart's burden -- a job at which 
it is eminently successful, regardless of how mountainous the task 
proves to be.</P>
