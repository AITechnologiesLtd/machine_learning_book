<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Double Oscar nominee Atom Egoyan's (The Sweet Hereafter) latest film
begins with a great long shot that travels through the sumptuously
appointed first floor of a mansion before it finally comes to rest on a
man preparing an intricate dish along with a French cooking show on TV.
The portly man is Joseph Hilditch (Bob Hoskins, Cousin Bette), the
overseer of a large industrial kitchen in England, and the giant home
was owned by his deceased mother Gala, who also happens to be the French
chef on the television.</P>
<P>We learn that the friendly Hilditch (think Ed Asner with a weave) is a
stickler for the fine art of cuisine, chasing away the salesman of a
vending machine company because his product would result in the loss of
jobs.  Hilditch explains that food needs to be prepared by human hands.
Each evening, Hilditch cooks a gourmet meal in his mother's kitchen
while watching videotapes of her television show.  There is a huge
stockpile of brand-new kitchen appliances at his disposal, each bearing
a picture of Gala (Arsinée Khanjian, Irma Vep and Egoyan's real-life
wife).  We see flashbacks of a chunky young Hilditch playing second
fiddle to his mother's career.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, a young, pretty Irish girl named Felicia (newcomer Elaine
Cassidy) has just traveled from her native County Cork to Birmingham,
England.  She's alone, pregnant and has no identification.  Felicia's
excursion has one singular mission – to find the love of her life and
father of her child, Johnny (Peter McDonald, I Went Down).  The problem
is that Felicia only knows that Johnny may have a manufacturing job
somewhere in Birmingham.  We learn through several flashbacks that
Felicia's father (Gerard McSorley, The Boxer) has threatened to disown
her if she left home for Johnny, an Irish lad that jumped sides and
joined the British Army.  Think of the widow-peaked Felicia as a
physical cross between Olivia Williams, Molly Parker and Parker Posey.</P>
<P>The forlorn Felicia meets the congenial Hilditch, who offers to help the
lass find her dreamboat.  I won't reveal the payoff, but if you raised a
red flag at the thought of a man that watches videotape of his dead mom
while living in her house, you'll get the idea.  The result is a twisted
mixture of Remains of the Day and The Silence of the Lambs.  Hoskins is
completely believable as the helpful gentleman with a big secret, and
the love-blind Cassidy portrays sufficient innocence in her titular
role.  Is Hoskins' performance good enough to nab an Oscar nomination?
They thought so in Cannes, where the film was overly praised earlier
this year.  Expect a big push from Journey's distributor Artisan – the
studio is rolling in cash after The Blair Witch Project.</P>
<P>Egoyan, who adapted the screenplay from William Trevor's novel Fools of
Fortune, slowly builds up the suspense in the film without using
gimmicky tricks or graphically depicting violence.  And the effect is
downright creepy.  His use of ‘50s music – especially Malcolm Vaughn's
`You Are My Special Angel' – helps to add to the glowing, dream-like
quality of the film.  Credit cinematographer Paul Sarossy (Affliction)
for much of Journey's radiance, as well as Egoyan's transformation
between the lush, green scenes in Ireland to the sooty gray of
Birmingham's industrial factories.</P>
<P>1:56 - PG-13 for mature thematic elements and related disturbing images</P>
