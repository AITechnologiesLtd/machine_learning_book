<PRE>                        SAVING PRIVATE RYAN 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                      Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
               4 out of 4 for the war epic of the century</PRE>

Director: Steven Spielberg.</P>
<P>This true to war epic must be seen by every generation, to remind us why
we must settle our differences diplomatically, without resorting to
violence. Steven Spielberg once again amazes us with his ability to tell
a story, this time, without manipulating the viewer's emotions. This
movie attempts to explore the soldier's personal, emotional and physical
conflicts in battle, when conscience is constantly being checked by the
questionable acts of war. War has a tendency to blur the fine line
between what is considered right and wrong, mixing black and white into
an awful looking grey. The haunting images of men been slaughtered on
Omaha beach, will not only leave one shell shocked, but it will linger
in your memory for many years to come. There will probably never be
another movie that makes a more poignant point about the value of human
life – even if it is for one man – Private Ryan. This is a movie about
ultimate sacrifice, with no greater love than when one man, or should I
say several men, lay down their life for their brother.</P>
