<PRE>"Moulin Rouge"</PRE>
<P>There has been a hype preceding Baz Luhrmann's latest opus that has helped
to infuse interest in the budding Australian film industry. Fox Studios,
Sydney has bellied up to the bar in a big way to bring us the director's
own vision of turn-of-the-century Parisian nightlife in "Moulin Rouge."</P>
<P>"Moulin Rouge" is a jam-packed musical extravaganza utilizing brilliantly
conceived, complexly produced sets providing the viewer with a visual
cornucopia of images. There is so much going on during the high-octane
musical numbers, I could only think of Peter Greenaway's stunning sets in
"Prospero's Books" by way of comparison. The numerous, imaginative dance
routines are done with the director's patented hyperkinetic editing, giving
the film the feel of Gilbert and Sullivan on acid.</P>
<P>Luhrmann's frenzied form of filmmaking was evident in his stylish and fun
"Strictly Ballroom." He took it a step further (and faltered horribly) with
his annoying "William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet" that must have had the
Bard rolling in his grave. The helmer continues to follow his own vision in
his best work to date. Not that "Moulin Rouge" is a great film, mind you.
The are cracks in the kitsch that keeps this extravagant musical from
greatness.</P>
<P>The story, by Luhrmann and Craig Pearce, covers no new ground with poor,
struggling poet, Christian (Ewan MacGregor), attracted to the big city
lights of circa-1900 gay Paris where the diminutive artiste, Henri de
Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo), and his cronies befriend him. The gang
soon introduces the naïve Christian to the pleasures and debauchery of the
infamous Moulin Rouge, a notorious nightclub owned by a surrealistic emcee,
Zidler (Jim Broadbent). There the gullible budding poet is introduced to
the charms of the beautiful star of the show, Satine (Nicole Kidman), the
most famous courtesan in Paris.</P>
<P>Zidler wants to make the change from nightclub shill to legitimate theater
owner and uses Satine to lure the wealthy Duke of Worcester (Richard
Roxburgh) to invest in his venture. The selfish, arrogant aristocrat lusts
after the beautiful chanteuse and agrees to pay for the business transition
- if he gets Satine in the bargain. The deluded Zidler and ambitious
Satine, who hungers to be a legit actress and no longer a highly paid
whore, agree, but overlook one major snag. Christian falls for Satine and
vice versa. Oh, yeah. Satine suffers from consumption. You take it from
there, keeping in mind this is a romantic tragedy.</P>
<P>Luhrmann almost overwhelms you with his frenetic dance numbers that utilize
a plethora of pop music songs delivered in operatic-style. The list is long
and starts with "The Sound of Music" begun, first, as narrative but soon
breaking into song as Christian conceives the heart of the musical play
that will launch the new Moulin Rouge. This is where the flick is both at
its best and its worst (though "worst" is a bit harsh).</P>
<P>There is a Bob Fosse influence to Luhrmann's proceedings as he combines
1900 Can Can burlesque with the modern musical poetry of "Roxanne," "Like a
Virgin" and "Smells Like Teen Spirit." Elton John's "Your Song" is the
flagship tune that epitomizes the romance between Christian and Satine.
"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend," a string of "love" songs (that's
song's with "love" in the title, Alex) - "In the Name of Love," "Silly Love
Songs," "All You Need Is Love" - "Up Where We Belong" (from "An Officer and
a Gentleman) and David Bowie's "Heroes" all get attention to varying
degrees. The all male "Like a Virgin," led by Broadbent, is good fun.</P>
<P>The myriad of musical numbers and references are, as I said, overwhelming
with the cleverness and single-minded wit of its auteur. For Luhrmann, more
is better as he batters you with a visual bombardment that weaves the
varied of songs into the fabric of the film.</P>
<P>There are actors up there on the screen and credit must be given to Kidman
and MacGregor for terrific musical performances. Each did their own singing
and both are first-rate, especially MacGregor, whose pipes could earn him a
living as a crooner. Jim Broadbent gives a wild and colorful perf as
Zidler, while Richard Roxburgh puts a Simon Legree spin on his sinister and
dispicable Duke. The rest of the cast provides a "Cabaret" level of
choreographic splendor to the striking dance numbers.</P>
<P>More is not always better and, sometimes, it is best to give the audience a
little time to chew on things a bit. The frenetic pace of "Moulin Rouge" is
a blessing and a bane, but it is certainly the vision of its maker. I give
it a B.</P>
