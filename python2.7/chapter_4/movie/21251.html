<P>Filial love, autobiography, pride in craftsmanship, family relations, 
labor ethics and changing times coalesce in "Mac," the first feature 
directed by John Turturro.</P>
<P>As an actor Turturro made his mark in several films, notably in three 
by Spike Lee and two by the Coen brothers. His major breakthrough 
came in the latter's "Barton Fink," for which he received the Best 
Actor Award at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival. The following year, 
also at Cannes, Turturro won the Camera d'Or (Golden Camera) prize 
for "Mac", as best first film.</P>
<P>"Mac" is inspired by the life and the values of Turturro's own 
father, a first generation Italian immigrant who was a carpenter 
before he became a contractor, and with whom John worked on summers 
and vacations.</P>
<P>The film had been Turturro's project since 1980. The movie script 
evolved into a play (co-written with playwright Brandon Cole) of 
which many scenes were staged by Turturro in various small New York 
theaters. But no film producer could be found until Nancy Tenenbaum 
("sex, lies and videotape"),  who had turned down the project several 
times, met with Turturro and, impressed, not only took over the 
production, but talked him into directing the movie.</P>
<P>"Mac" opens in Queens, at the wake for Papa Vitelli in 1954 
(Turturro's father actually died in 1988), who leaves three sons, Mac 
(Turturro) the oldest, Vico (Badalucco), and Bruno (Capotorto) the 
junior.</P>
<P>Of the three, Mac is like a reincarnation of the old man, and 
inherits from him the principle that "There's only two ways of doing 
things. The right  way and my way. And they're both the same." The 
principle involves uncompromising standards of workmanship that, in 
Mac's case, turn into a veritable obsession.</P>
<P>The brothers go to work for contractor Olek Krupa who practices 
shortcuts -- beams spaced too far apart, fewer nails used, and the 
like. Mac's brothers, though disapproving, accept the status quo, 
especially as they have other fish to fry: Vico is a girl-chaser and 
Bruno an aspiring artist as well as a ladies' man.</P>
<P>Mac however eventually rebels (quite violently) and like his Papa and 
Turturro's own goes from carpenter to independent contractor, with 
his brothers. The film follows the work and travails of the outfit in 
the style of "verismo,"  roughly the Italian term for naturalism, 
which in the 1940s led to the neo-realism of Italian cinema and in 
turn influenced Italian-American  directors like Scorsese or Coppola.</P>
<P>Unadorned reality permeates the film. The price of this authenticity 
is that the characters are not fabricated, hence are not particularly 
interesting. But this is made up by the suspense inherent in the 
building trade, with the menace of financial debacles, physical 
dangers, graft and abuses. There are major accidents and lesser 
irritations, like a worker named Joey who is a real Sloppy Joe but is 
protected by his Union representative.</P>
<P>The culmination of Mac's idealistic tunnel-vision is the building of 
four finely-honed houses. The tragedy is that they won't sell, for 
reasons explained in the movie.</P>
<P>More than his brothers, it is Mac's girl, later his wife Alice 
(Katherine Borowitz, Turturro's wife in real life) who counsels and 
encourages him, shows good sense and genuine flair for business 
deals. I cannot tell whether this character is invented or, like much 
in the movie, comes from models. But
strong Alice is a refreshing change from the submissive movie spouses 
of Italo-Americans, before and after the 1950s.</P>
<P>To his credit, Turturro does not overplay his ethnic hand. The 
Sicilian-American atmosphere is inescapable, with macho boys, heavy 
accents, underlit, furniture-choked interiors. But colorfulness per 
se is avoided: no pasta, no cutesy sentiments, no shouts (except for 
the unseen, probably senile mama who screeches from her room), no 
family feuds, no Mafiosi.</P>
<P>At the same time, the predominantly Italianate teams of workers 
include other races and ethnicities. Characteristics are kept, the 
melting pot is more of a mixing pot,  and there is often a true 
feeling of proletarian solidarity.</P>
<P>As the Vitelli Bros. business develops in lurching fashion, comes 
dangerously close to bankruptcy and then bounces back modestly. 
Mac's perfectionism gradually alienates his brothers. They finally 
quit the partnership and the Old World standards, while joining, so 
to speak, the post-war half of the century, a time of sellers rather 
than builders. The disgusted Mac sums up the1950s boom while 
unwittingly prophesizing the excesses of the 1980s : "There are men 
who can do, and men who can talk."</P>
<P>I wonder whether or not Turturro has been remotely affected by films 
like "On the Waterfront" of 1954, the year when "Mac" begins, or 
better still, Italian movies like Francesco Rosi's classic exposé of 
crooked real-estate developers, "Hands Over the City" (1963), with 
Rod Steiger.</P>
<P>Yet no matter what the influences "Mac" is not  derivative. 
Throughout, it remains an actor's movie, with a stress (sometimes an 
over-stress) of closeups of faces, something that might also be 
called a TV technique, yet a system that great filmmakers such as 
Ingmar Bergman can render totally cinematic.</P>
<P>Initially rather slow, the tempo later picks up, notably when Mac 
passionately and heedlessly overbids against his former employer; 
when at last virtue is rewarded by the sale of all four houses; or 
when,  in a scene of  near-Shakespearean pathos, the other brothers 
go their own way.</P>
<P>Also to Turturro's credit, the picture, unlike Mac's building, does 
not attempt to be a "well-made" film with all the rough spots sanded 
down, all characters explained, problems solved, and questions 
answered.</P>
<P>The driven Mac , undoubtedly a pain to live with, is not particularly 
appealing. But the message is. As Turturro said in a 1992 interview: 
" This is a very American film, very large in spirit, that says: to 
build something means something -- and that the most important thing 
a person can do is leave a mark on the world in a simple but 
significant way."</P>
