<PRE>"Gone in 60 Seconds"  --  Fast Cars but A Story that
Stalls
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>This is a note to the marketing execs of this film. 
Stop promoting it by taking out television and
newspaper ads.  Instead, concentrate your advertising
dollars in such magazines as Car & Driver, Motor
Trend, or Hot Rod.  "Gone in 60 Seconds" is the kind
of film to which car enthusiasts will flock. 
Featuring a bevy of exotic cars and high performance
vehicles, it gives you a chance to see seldom seen
top-of-the line cars that you could only dream of
owning.  However, to the rest of us non-enthusiasts,
which is about 98% of us, this is a film that is need
of a tune-up.  Its cars move faster than the story and
their sleek looks are more memorable than any of the
characters.</P>
<P>The film would have you believe that it stars Nicolas
Cage, Angelina Jolie, and Giovanni Ribisi.  But its
real stars are the Porsches, Ferraris and
Lamborghinis.  And there are plenty of them.  An auto
theft ring led by Kip Raines (Ribisi) is targeting
these beauties and a few other specialty cars.  Kip
has been hired by a local crime boss who is not the
kind of man that believes in mercy or forgiveness. 
Kip feels up to the task and accepts the difficult
job.  However, he's young, brash, and lacks the
experience to pull off such a hefty assignment. 
Eventually, one of his 'boosts' goes awry.  The police
discover and confiscate Kip's stolen cars.  Although
he eludes the police, he still must answer to the
crime boss, who promises Kip an agonizing death unless
he can deliver.</P>
<P>Nicolas Cage plays Kip's older brother, Memphis, who
was a legendary car thief in his own time.  Now, he
makes an honest living, but is forced back into a life
of crime in order to save his brother.  Memphis must
steal 50 cars in 4 days; otherwise his brother will be
killed.  He quickly begins to assemble his team.  They
include, among others, trusted friend (Robert Duvall),
and former love interest Sway (Angelina Jolie).  They
do some homework to locate the needed cars and they
ready themselves for a one-night blitz where they hope
to pull off a daring string of auto thefts.</P>
<P>For Memphis and his crew, stealing cars is like taking
candy from a baby.  They easily open locks, hot wire
ignitions, disarm alarms, bypass circuitry and remove
other theft-deterrent devices with surprising ease. 
However, Memphis still must contend with some serious
issues if he is to succeed.  A dogged detective
(Delroy Lindo) knows that he's up to no good and has
deployed surveillance teams out to watch over several
of the vehicles targeted for theft.  Competing car
thieves who do not welcome Memphis's reappearance want
him to leave town.  And, to be able to make the
deadline, all of the thefts would have to go smoothly,
which is virtually impossible.</P>
<P>The only fun part of the film occurs in the last 25
minutes as Memphis races against time and a squadron
of police cars to deliver the last car.  This is
actually an impressively designed chase sequence,
taking us through congested city streets and a
construction zone where our hero has to dodge various
debris and even a wrecking ball.  But "Gone in 60
Seconds" is remarkably slow for a film that seems like
it will showcase lots of chase sequences and the
charisma reminiscent of "Smokey and the Bandit." 
Sadly, with its goofy and underwhelming
characterizations, this film starts to feel more like
"The Dukes of Hazzard."  </P>
