<PRE>                               JUDGE DREDD
                       A film review by Sue Roberts
                        Copyright 1995 Sue Roberts</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Danny Cannon
Starring Sylvester Stallone, Armand Assante, Diane Lane, 
      Rob Schneider.</PRE>
<P>     If only Fritz Lang could see this picture.  He would be thrilled
with the modern METROPOLIS.  Exaggerated angles, individual lines of
dialog, (one could almost see the speech bubbles) and a dangerous pace
all conspire to make this the first film to bring the art form of comic
illustration to the screen.  One could feel every line of the drawings
leaping to life.</P>
<P>     Sly Stallone obviously enjoyed working on this one and indulged in
some serious timing on the humour.  It says a lot for his performance
that he competed with the scale of production design and won.</P>
<P>     Cannon certainly kept the pages turning!  I waited ninety minutes
for them to get to the quiet bit and it never came.  At the culmination
I had only one question: "Er, excuse me, is that IT!!!  Well do, you
think we could just run the sequel NOW?"</P>
