<P>     Here's the faint praise with which I ultimately damn THE GOVERNESS:
while I was consistently interested in the film, I'm not sure I could tell
you what the point of it all was.  Certainly I could outline the plot,
which centers around a young Sephardic Jewish woman named Rosina Da Silva
(Minnie Driver) in 1840s London.  When her father dies suddenly, leaving a
mountain of debt, Rosina is obliged either to marry or find employment of
her own.  The high-spirited girl opts for the latter course, posing as a
Gentile named Mary Blackchurch in order to work as a governess for a
Christian family called Cavendish on Scotland's Isle of Skye.  There she
finds herself drawn to patriarch Charles (Tom Wilkinson), a reclusive
scientist, even as his son Henry (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) becomes fascinated
with Rosina/Mary.</P>
<P>     From there, however, things start to get a little murky.  We know
that Rosina is a stranger in a strange land; will the central conflict be
a clash of cultures?  We know her young charge Clementina (Florence Hoath)
is a trouble-maker; will the story follow their growing mutual affection?
We know that Rosina has dreams of performing on the stage; will we find
her getting lost in the real-life performance she is forced to undertake?
We know that Mrs. Cavendish (Harriet Walter) feels suffocated by her
isolated country life; will she and Rosina act as counterpoints in a study
of acceptable female roles, or bond over their shared pining for the city?</P>
<P>     The answer to these questions and more is a resounding "sort of."
The bulk of the narrative is devoted to the developing relationship
between Charles and Rosina, a relationship hinged on a provocative irony:
though Rosina loves Charles for his ability to appreciate her mind (when
he invites her to assist in his research), he only knows her as the
fiction she has created.  Yet all the rich background provided by
writer/director Sandra Goldbacher teases without adding up to enough.  In
the long run, it's virtually irrelevant that Rosina is Jewish; all she
really needs is some sort of dark secret to hide from the Cavendish
family.  The Rosina-as-actress angle disappears after the first act,
shortly followed by the conflict between Rosina and Clementina (dismissed
in one threatening tug of the pigtails).</P>
<P>     Most disappointing of all is the lack of interest Goldbacher shows in
developing her secondary characters.  Mrs. Cavendish, a potentially
touching portrait of repressed longing, instead becomes comic relief
described as though "she had a lemon stuck up her bottom."  Even more
mysterious is young Henry, whose obsession with Rosina may be an act of
rebellion, or perhaps a fleeting adolescent crush, or perhaps some mixture
of the two.  In any case, it certainly doesn't mean enough for a lingering
scene of Henry writhing naked in the surf to provide anything more than
the film's _second_ gratuitous penis shot.  Driver's strong, sensual
performance as Rosina and Wilkinson's turn as the conflicted Charles do
fill in plenty of gaps, but it's tough to get caught up in a romantic
square composed of one real woman, half an identifiable man, a pale and
petulant enigma, and a stick figure wrapped in a shawl.</P>
<P>     All the time that might have been spent sorting out their motivations
is spent instead on a metaphor so massively obvious you might trip over it
on your way out into the lobby.  Charles' major scientific investigation
involves photography, particularly how to hold the transient images which
fade over several hours.  Leaving aside Rosina's Forrest Gump-like
discovery of the darkroom and the concept of saline solution developing,
the entire photography angle feels like one long attempt to distinguish
between our two principal characters -- she wants to capture human faces
(i.e. she's vibrant and alive), he is interested only in inanimate
objects (i.e., he's cold and reserved).  What we don't see is what this
has to do with any of the other cultural or sociological tidbits 
Goldbacher drops along the way.  Driver's Rosina is a compelling enough
presence that you'll want to put the pieces together, but you'll find far
more ambition than resolution.  THE GOVERNESS fairly drowns in context
desperately seeking some content.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 blue Skyes:  5.</PRE>
