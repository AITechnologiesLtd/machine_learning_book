<P>     Jackie Chan as James Bond???  Take away the superspy guns and 
gorgeous women, and that's exactly what JACKIE CHAN'S FIRST STRIKE 
(released internationally as POLICE STORY 4) offers fans.  It's all 
here:  cool cars, neat gadgets, and globetrotting adventure (locations 
include Hong Kong, the Ukraine, and Australia).  In fact, given Chan's 
undeniable gift for mixing physical comedy and nimble, no-holds-barred 
action, one might reasonably expect FIRST STRIKE to out-Bond Bond, 
except for one small detail -- this movie lacks even the semblance of a 
plot. </P>
<P>     But the virtual absence of a story isn't the biggest problem.  
After all, no one could claim that movies like MOONRAKER or A VIEW TO A 
KILL are pinnacles of narrative complexity.  Rather, the chief flaw 
evident in FIRST STRIKE is that the script spends too much time trying 
to explain the inexplicable.  Since very little makes sense in the first 
place, why waste nearly an hour dragging down an otherwise-enjoyable 
film with pointless exposition?  The unfortunate result is that 
significant chunks of FIRST STRIKE end up being extremely boring.  
Instead of watching Chan twist his body into pretzel-like shapes and 
kick butt, we're forced to listen to bad guys talk about why they're 
doing what they're doing. </P>
<P>     So what is the story?  It has something to do with Jackie, a Hong 
Kong police officer, getting involved with a CIA mission in the Ukraine.  
He ends up on the trail of a shady figure who's trying to sell a nuclear 
missile to the New Russian Mafia.  Jackie soon becomes a marked target, 
especially once he makes contact with Tsui (Jackson Lou), the man with 
the missile, and his sister, Annie (Chen Chun Wu).  Jackie's mission 
takes him from the frozen wastes of the Ukraine to Australia, where he 
finds creatures far more deadly than the koalas that inhabit his hotel 
suite. </P>
<P>     As always, the stunts are the centerpiece -- the real reason to sit 
through so much useless, extraneous material and painful, dubbed 
dialogue.  A brief snowmobile chase is followed by a snowboarding 
sequence that's accompanied by pseudo-Bond music.  Later, there's an 
amusing fight with a traditional Bond-type "big guy" (Jaws without the 
teeth) that ends with Chan jumping from ledge to ledge near the top of a 
high rise hotel.  The best sequence is an extended fight that has Chan 
using everything at his disposal -- chairs, tables, ladders, and even a 
scaffolding -- to fend off several martial arts opponents.  Finally, at 
the end, there's an underwater battle that not only has Chan outdueling 
human opponents but a shark as well.   </P>
<P>     As always, the stunts are precisely choreographed, and the mistakes 
can be seen in the end-of-the-film outtakes.  However, editing during 
the rest of FIRST STRIKE borders on inept, further muddying an already 
chaotic storyline.  More than once, I found myself wondering what the 
hell was going on.  There's no denying that Chan excels at what he does 
-- transforming generic fights into brilliantly creative, often funny 
explosions of comic-book style violence.  In fact, he's so much fun to 
watch that it's almost worth sitting through the banal parts of the 
movie to enjoy him at work.  But, on balance, it may be better to wait 
for the videotape for this particular excursion.  That way, if boredom 
sets in, the next good scene is only a quick fast-forward ahead.   </P>
