<PRE>FIRESTORM
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>You always have to be careful with the first official studio release out
of the gate each year.  They're obviously films for which the studios
have no great hopes (having missed both the deadline for  Academy Award
eligibility and the big box-office holiday season).  Combine that with
Howie Long's first starring action role, and you've got a doozy of a
movie that, while not as bad as it could have been, isn't a very good
film.</P>
<P>Howie stars as an ace smokejumper (a firefighter who parachutes into
forest fires unreachable from the ground).  In the slightly contrived
opening scenes, we witness his heroism in action, as he, and his mentor
(played by Scott Glenn) attempt to rescue a small girl and her dog from
an oncoming forest fire.</P>
<P>William Forsythe plays the bad guy, a mass murderer who has several
million dollars tucked away to help fund his jailbreak.  He (and five
convict cohorts) manages to get selected for firefighting duty when a
woodland blaze just happens to ignite nearby. His escape plan bets a lot
on the laxity of the guards, but (since there must be a movie) luck is
with him.  Soon the now-escaped convicts are masquerading as Canadian
firefighters. Why Canadian?  Who knows, eh?  Along the way they pick up
a pretty birdwatcher (Suzy Amis) to be their hostage.</P>
<P>Enter Howie Long.  He's called in to help fight the blaze, and when he
spots the group of "ground pounders", apparently lost, he parachutes in
to help.  When he discovers their true identity, he is the only thing
standing between them and escape, and the only hope of help for the
hostage.</P>
<P>Long's acting talents are above those of, say, Steven Seagal, but not by
much. Although his delivery is mostly flat and wooden, he's a likeable
hero, and there are some hints here and there that he may get better.</P>
<P>The script doesn't help him out any, however.  All too often, it veers
into the realm of the unintentionally funny.  The dialogue is strictly
B-movie material, and the plotting relies too heavily on coincidences to
be believable.</P>
<P>Long's co-stars are a mixed bag.  At least they're all comfortable in
their respective roles. Forsythe has the scenery-chewing villain down
cold, down cold, and Scott Glenn is always enjoyable to watch, even when
he doesn't seem to be stretching his talents (as is definitely the case
here). Suzy Amis plays peril pretty well, but isn't given much more to
do.</P>
<P>Some of the nature and wildfire shots are interesting, but many are
rather bland.  You'd think that the director, Dean Semler, a former
cinematographer, would at least produce a film with interesting
visuals.  That's not the case. There's a lack of originality to nearly
all the sequences...we've seen this stuff before.</P>
<P>It's not the most auspicious start to 1998, but it could have been worse
(just think back to 1996's debut, Bio-Dome). However, after a month of
Oscar-caliber pictures, a movie like Firestorm at least gives you some
perspective on how good those movies really were.  In fact, there's a
good chance that some of them are still playing near you...</P>
