<P>PLOT:
Two teachers at a local community college discover a meteor fallen to 
earth which may contain a growing alien organism. They try to keep it 
secret, but it isn't long before the government is all over it and 
Mulder, oops, I mean the two teachers, must work alongside a goofy 
teenager and a klutzy scientist in order to get to the bottom of things.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
An "okay" movie with some very cool, colorful alien creatures, a few 
laughs here and there, good performances from its leads, but ultimately 
nothing to go nuts over. I'm guessing that they were going for a MEN IN 
BLACK-type of thing here, but this film isn't as funny or as original as 
the latter. It does however feature a more interesting mE9lange of =
actors. Duchovny playing the straight man to perfection as usual. 
Orlando Jones finally getting a semi-decent role in which to showcase 
his obvious comedic talents. Seann William Scott, well, just acting like 
he does in all of his roles and doing it in a very funny way! And 
Julianne Moore...good for you, girl, stretching those acting muscles as 
a goofy scientist. All four worked very well in their respective roles, 
as well as their camaraderie (especially Duchovny and Jones). In fact, 
their chemistry is probably the main reason why I wasn't too bored with 
the first half of this film, which lacked a certain energy and moved a 
little too slow, in my opinion. Once the aliens got into the picture 
(literally), things did jazz up during the film's second half, but even 
then, it was never to a point where I was blown away or anything.</P>
<P>The movie also delivers some B-movie elements, like its last 15 minutes, 
which just screamed THE BLOB and films of that sort. A little 
blue-screen action was also a little obvious. It's the kind of movie 
that you will most likely enjoy while watching and then completely 
forget about an hour after you leave the theater. Which isn't 
necessarily a bad thing, just an observation. It will definitely not 
crack the pop-culture barometer as GHOSTBUSTERS did all those years ago, 
but you can certainly do worse with other films playing out there right 
now (now is that a solid recommendation or what?!? :) The film's also 
got some pretty neat "boo" scare moments and even a shot of Duchovny's 
ass (God knows that I've been waiting years for that!). In the end, I 
guess that I was expecting a "meatier" script with bigger laughs, more 
action and more moments of suspense, but ended up with something a 
little less ambitious. This is a simple movie, with sci-fi and comedic 
elements mixed within a little story and great performances. Not the 
best movie that you'll see this year, but certainly not the worst. 
Wow...I'm really "selling" this one, eh? Sheesh...what can I say, the 
film was somewhat entertaining while I was there, but not all that 
memorable looking back. In others words, it's a toss-up boys and 
girls...!</P>
