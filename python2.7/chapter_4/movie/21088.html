<PRE>JOE THE KING
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<PRE>Dysfunctional families are in.</PRE>
<P>Writers and directors figure that the more the adults scream obscenities
at the kids, the more the films will gain the sympathy of the audience.
If the kids do their own share of cussing, then even better because it
will reflect on the kids' upbringing.  And, if the filmmakers can get an
A-list star (Val Kilmer in this case) to attach himself to the project,
they can easily find a studio to green light its production.</P>
<P>So it is with JOE THE KING by actor Frank Whaley in his debut as a
writer and director.  The movie has an underdeveloped script that feels
like an uncompleted outline.  Not much happens in this coming-of-age
story, save one incident.</P>
<P>The opening section, shot comically with wide-angle lenses, is so
unbelievable that it made me think that the movie was going to be a
parody, not the grippingly realistic drama that it was billed to be.  In
it, a third-grade teacher (Camryn Manheim) needlessly ridicules poor Joe
Henry (Peter Tambakis).  Then for the sin of not giving the right
answer, she pulls down his pants and spanks his bare bottom in front of
the entire class.</P>
<P>When we meet Joe's father, Bob (Kilmer), he, too, has been lambasted by
one of the school's teachers.  He's an alcoholic and the school's
janitor.  As he cowers in the shadows, the teacher lambastes him for his
drinking.  A born loser, he owes almost everybody in town money.</P>
<P>After a few minutes, the movie skips ahead 5 years, when Noah Fleiss
plays Joe as a 14-year-old and Max Ligosh plays his year older brother,
Mike.</P>
<P>Joe works late every night at a local restaurant.  He's also a thief,
but the story treats this so inconsequentially that you almost don't
notice.  Joe is an abused kid so we are supposed to be sympathetic, not
critical.</P>
<P>The movie's central characters are all miscast.  As a semi-illiterate,
blue collar worker, Kilmer is never credible.  The two boys playing his
sons have the good looks and perfect skin of photographic models.  They
show the intelligence and demeanor of prep school students, not children
below the poverty line.  Karen Young, as the boy's mother, phones in her
performance, bringing nothing to her role.</P>
<P>"There are good people, Joe, and then there are guys like me," his
father says in perhaps his only cogent thought in the story.  "Don't get
caught on the wrong side of this equation."</P>
<P>For all the movie's problems, one can't help but feel sorry for Joe.
Too bad his story was just sketched for us.  With a different cast and a
more finished script, we could have gotten to know him.</P>
<P>JOE THE KING runs 1:40.  It is rated R for language and abusive
situations and would be acceptable for teenagers.</P>
