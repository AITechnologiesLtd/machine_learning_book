<P>     TOPSY-TURVY is not a bio-pic in the conventional sense of the term.
It's a bio-pic in the Mike Leigh sense of the term, which may be
redundant. However, it may not even be appropriate to call it a Mike Leigh
film in the conventional sense of the term. Leigh has spent most of his
career on contemporary character studies, structuring scripts out of
character improvisations. One does not think of period pieces when one
thinks of Mike Leigh, nor would one likely think of him as the ideal
film-maker to look behind the scenes at the creation of Gilbert &
Sullivan's "The Mikado." How would this fashioner of human drama approach
the fashioning of light opera?</P>
<P>     As it turns out, he does so with detail, detail and more detail --
occasionally to nerve-wracking excess. The story opens in 1884, where
"Princess Aida" -- the latest creation of the immensely popular team of
lyricist William S. Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) and composer Arthur Sullivan
(Allan Corduner) -- is receiving tepid notices for the excessive
familiarity of its themes. Gilbert responds defensively, retiring to write
his latest fanciful libretto, while the ailing Sullivan resolves never to
write light opera again. He is persuaded to reconsider when Gilbert
attends a Japanese exposition and comes up with one of his most original
ideas in years. But the concept for "The Mikado" is only the beginning of
the arduous process of staging it.</P>
<P>     When TOPSY-TURVY finally hits its stride, with Gilbert's visit to the
exposition, it's an extraordinarily entertaining piece of work. Leigh
dives into the pre-production process with gusto, exploring every possible
element of a theater company's work. The rehearsal scene, in which Gilbert
attends to the details of pacing and the inconvenient absence of two
actors, is hilarious even in its attention to the mundane; a scene of
Gilbert using Japanese women as advisors for cultural authenticity has a
similarly unexpected charm. Leigh even finds drama in the finances of
theater, creating a nice scene in which the theater's manager (Ron
Cook) negotiates salary with featured performer George Grossmith (Martin
Savage). You know a film-maker is doing something write when he can wring
comedy out of a wardrobe session, and drama out of whether or not a song
will be cut from the production.</P>
<P>     It would be easy to embrace TOPSY-TURVY unreservedly if Leigh seemed
to know what to cut from his own production. Even at 160 minutes, the film
never seems tedious; it does, however, seem unnecessarily meandering.
There are detours into Sullivan's European trip to recharge his batteries,
brief explorations of Gilbert's contentious relationship with his mother
and a late surge of sympathy for Gilbert's perpetually abandoned wife
(Lesley Manville). Leigh also goes overboard in the inclusion of musical
numbers, giving us full-scale recreations of at least a half-dozen songs
from three different productions. While the inclusion of some Gilbert and
Sullivan work would seem necessary as context, Leigh takes too much
liberty with the length and breadth of his musical interludes. By the end
of TOPSY-TURVY, you may feel you've sat through "Princess Aida" and "The
Mikado" in their entirety.</P>
<P>     In most films, the extra weight would probably have sunk the whole
endeavor. Blessedly, TOPSY-TURVY is that rare film that gets better with
every passing minute, building to that enchanting final hour of
preparation for production. Still more blessedly, Leigh has put together
another superb cast to give the scenes as much bite as possible, including
Leigh veterans like Alison Steadman (LIFE IS SWEET) and Timothy Spall
(SECRETS & LIES). Most blessedly of all, he has Allan Corduner and Jim
Broadbent in his lead roles giving two of the best performances of the
year. Broadbent's Gilbert has a bit more to work with -- and hence the
showier part -- but Corduner's more amiable, artistic integrity-bound
Sullivan is a delight as well. Leigh covers a lot of ground in TOPSY-TURVY
-- perhaps, ultimately, too much -- but he has the good sense to come back
around to the good stuff. The result is a biography as singular as Leigh
himself: messy, insightful and, of course, very human.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Leigh'ed operas:  7.</PRE>
