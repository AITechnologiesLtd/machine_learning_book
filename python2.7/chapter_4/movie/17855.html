Directed By Joseph Rubin

<P>Return to Paradise is a grim thriller that tries hard to impress, but is
somewhat flawed. Sheriff (Vaughn), Lewis (Phoenix) and Tony (David Conrad)
are three friends who spend time in Malaysia drinking, having sex, and
smoking lots of hash. Tony and Sheriff eventually leave, but Lewis, an
Greenpeace activist, stays to help introduce urangutangs back to the their
habitat. However, he is shortly busted by the police, and his stash o' hash
is found. Back in Brooklyn, Beth (Heche), Lewis's lawyer, appears from
nowhere, telling Sheriff and Tony that if they don't come back to Malaysia
and accept some of the blame, Lewis will be hung. Sheriff and Tony then have
to make the moral decision.</P>
<P>Return to Paradise falls into the dreaded trap: it's an 'okay' movie. That
is, there is nothing particularly special about it, but nothing truly awful
either. The performances are fine, and Anne Heche, after her 2.D characters
featured in Six Days Seven Nights and Psycho, has a potentially better
character to work with, and  the chemistry  with Vaughn works well. Although
the film seems somewhat disinterested with Heche's character on occasion,
she plays the role well enough. Vaughn is great as Sheriff, delivering a
fine performance. His transition from a stubborn 'no, I'm not going' to
seriously thinking about it is well played and delivered, but again the
script just doesn't do enough justice, and Vaughn himself makes the
character work. It's up to Phoenix, as the most underwritten character in
the film, to give the best performance, and nearly all of his scenes have a
harrowing reality about them, especially the unexpected, and scary, ending.</P>
<P>But although the actors are great, the characters themselves act, and talk,
like soap opera stars. The script and story are sometimes surprisingly
amateurish, the sort of thing you'd expect to be on television late night
with the title 'Return To Paradise: The True Story of Lewis.' The ending,
although harrowing, is somewhat unbelievable, and there is a tacky sex scene
thrown in between Heche and Vaughn, which doesn't help the movie at all. And
the final scene, a reunion between Heche and Vaughn, is overplayed and
irritatingly sloppy, almost strangling the audience to emit some kind of
emotion from them. It's a shame, because when the scenes work, they really
work, and the gritty realism of some of the scenes give the idea that this
film could of been much better than it actually is.</P>
<P>The direction is good, although it works far better during the second part
of the film, in Malaysia. The prison scenes are unsettling, and work well.
But there's some problems with the pacing, and the film seems really long
winded at some points, almost as if it were padding. But generally, like
everything else in the movie, the direction is just good,  not brilliant nor
pathetic.</P>
<P>Return to Paradise is a admirable attempt, but something is missing to make
it an truly engaging epic. There is enough entertainment on offer, but
occasionally this largely well made movie just does some things hopelessly
wrong. The film raises some interesting questions, and pulls some surprises,
but overall it seems like it's underachieving. It's worth watching for the
strong performances of the cast, but Return to Paradise is a T.V drama that
tries to be a lot more, but doesn't always succeed.</P>
