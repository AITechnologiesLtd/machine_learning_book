<PRE>                        FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL
                       A film review by Sue Roberts
                        Copyright 1994 Sue Roberts</PRE>
<PRE>Director: Mike Newell
Script by: Richard Curtis</PRE>
<P>Features: Hugh Grant, Andie MacDowell, Kristin Scott Thomas, 
          Simon Callow, David Bower, Corin Redgrave, James Fleet, 
          John Hannah, Charlotte Coleman and Rowan Atkinson.</P>
<P>     I feel the formula for British weddings is fundamentally bizarre
(archaic tradition meets nouveau riche aspiration) and as this movie
sets out to show, the comic possibilities are endless!  The real joy of
Richard Curtis' script, however, is the accuracy with which the events
are portrayed.  It starts off with something simple, the "howling up
the motorway in an unsuitable vehicle and changing when you arrive"
gag.  Well, I ask you, who hasn't?  Judging by the way the 2000 or so
audience present fell about, and the exact nature of their shrieking
laughter as events unfolded, a lot of the audience were seeing their
past life flash before them.  On a more serious note the wonderful
timing and the somewhat bemused delivery, reminded one of Buster
Keyton.</P>
<P>     The director, Mike Newell, has managed to bring out the and
flavour of this script beautifully by ensuring all of the balancing
acts within it are given room to breathe.  The counterweight to the
gloss of all those weddings being the devastating loss of a friend
loved by everyone.  A reminder that one may enter this world with
nothing, but may leave with rather more.  Simon Callow's dancing was
particularly memorable!</P>
<P>     The more subtle dichotomy between the American (Andie McDowell)
who marries for money expecting it to be the key to eternal happiness,
and the wealthy aristocrat who would settle for anyone and is eternally
rebuffed evokes the gap between British and American ideas.</P>
<P>     To shed some light on the character of Charles (Hugh Grant).  Once
upon a time in England, cricket was played by gentlemen who turned up
on the day of the match, tossed on a set of flannels, strolled
nonchalantly onto the green and scored a century.  Blood might have
been sweat, but the critical thing was to make it appear effortless,
and imply that it was, of course, a fluke!</P>
<PRE>     This still applies to rugby.  My husband played rugby with him at
school.</PRE>
<P>     The director was both clever and fortunate to pick a team of
actors who worked so well together to make this film into an
outrageously funny piece of entertainment.</P>
