<PRE>A WASTE OF TIME</PRE>
<P>Will a black man ever receive a fair trial from an all-white jury in a 
Southern US state? Will Sandra Bullock ever run out of hair to flick out 
of her eyes, and can John Grisham write a book that doesn't have the 
word "CONSPIRACY" flashing metaphysically across every one of its pages?</P>
<P>These, and other similarly urgent issues, are some of the things that 
will fascinate in A TIME TO KILL, the latest book-turned-movie from John 
"It's just you the reader and me the hero against the FBI, the entire 
American judicial system, and the Darn Way Things Just Are" Grisham.</P>
<P>In poverty-baked Missisippi, a tiny, sweet black girl is tortured, raped 
and left to die by a group of racuous, evil White Boys. Arrested and 
waiting for trial, they are then assailed and shot point blank by the 
girl's father, Carl Lee Hailey, played by a glowering Samuel Johnson.  
Enter the (by now) much talked about Matthew McWhatisname, Mr Esquire 
Magazine cum Guess Jeans Good Looks, as the young, white GoodHearted 
lawyer friend who takes on Hailey's defence, Jake Brigance.</P>
<P>Throw in Kevin Spacey as the dead confident prosecutor with a shakey 
Southern accent (if Sandra Bullock puts in the only believable 
performance of the whole cast, it must surely be because she doesn't 
have to Sound Southern), Donald Sutherland as Brigance's mostly drunk 
now but previously brilliant mentor, a mean, twisted Keifer Sutherland 
as the rapist's brother who's main purpose in the story is to Make Sure 
There's Trouble, and a burly, amoral Oliver Platt as Brigance's oily, 
wise-cracking sidekick for good measure, and you pretty much have the 
whole story. For extra insurance, the film's makers have thrown in the 
darkly beautiful Sandra Bullock in the role of, in her own words, 
"brilliant law student," who rushes down for the summer to help Brigance 
with his case. </P>
<P>Finally there's Ashley Judd, Brigance's young wife, whose main job seems 
to be walking around the Brigance's new house in tank tops and sweating 
a lot, and his achingly cute blonde daughter. Both comprise a nice White 
parallel to the Black Hailey's own loving family, and form the empathic 
comaparison between the successful Brigance and the misfortunate Hailey.
One of Brigance's main concerns is that if he were Hailey, he would have 
done exactly what he did.</P>
<P>If I seem preoccupied with identifying "character types" and Plot 
Structures, it's only because that's how the movie seemed to work the 
whole time. While most of the characters were nicely etched out and the 
script is generally well-written, I got the feeling that the movie was 
more interested in presenting issues to its audience than actually 
working them out. For example, there are the scarey KKK scenes that 
bring out the powerful weirdness and danger of racism, but that don't 
seem to amount to anything in the conclusion, the will-they-won't-they 
thing between Bullock and McConnaughy that abruptly concludes without 
one iota of resolution, and the this-case-is-breaking-up-my-family 
schtick that Brigance has to go through that culminates in a scene that 
I can only describe as surreal. </P>
<P>In the end, although there are a lot of things going on in A TIME TO 
KILL, nothing really happens. The film is hardly a courtroom thriller, 
because McConaughey spends more time arguing with his wife, drinking 
tequila with Bullock, and taking long meadow walks with Sutherland than
actually preparing for, or even doing anything, in court. His final 
courtroom summation is feeble and maudlin, and cannot convince an 
audience well-versed in the verbal maneuvering of David Kelley drama 
series (Picket Fences and L.A. Law), or even previous courtroom movies 
that turn on racial or social issues like TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD or 
MURDER IN THE FIRST.</P>
<P>Conclusion: although somewhat interesting, I didn't think this movie was 
worth $7.</P>
<P> The Flying Inkpot Rating System:
 * Wait for the TV2 broadcast. 
 ** A little creaky, but still better than staying at home with Gotcha! 
 *** Pretty good, bring a friend. 
 **** Amazing, potent stuff. 
 ***** Perfection. See it twice.</P>
