<P>THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR is an attractive, stylishly-made remake of an
attractive, stylishly-made 1968 film which starred Steve McQueen and Faye
Dunaway.  Both films feature a playful but intelligent cat and mouse game
between the two leads.</P>
<P>In the remake, Pierce Brosnan (TOMORROW NEVER DIES) is cast as the title
character originated by Mr. McQueen.  Thomas Crown is a multi-billionaire
for whom $100,000 is merely pocket change to be squandered on an
impossible golf bet.  The high stakes of the "shark-infested" corporate
waters in which he swims has lost its challenge.  He has bested every
business opponent he has come across.  There is no more excitement in his
life.  No more heights of which to climb.  So what is a man to do?  Of
course!  Risk everything by turning to a life of crime.  He's not in it
for the money.  He just wants (needs?) the adrenaline rush.</P>
<P>After cleverly pulling off an art museum heist where he absconds with a
million dollar Monet, he crosses paths with Catherine Banning (Rene Russo,
TIN CUP), a smart and sexy insurance investigator who immediately senses
that Crown is her culprit.  Not being confined to police procedures, legal
niceties, or for that matter, common sense, Banning seductively confronts
Crown with the fact that she knows that he stole the painting.</P>
<P>As the two main characters begin to weave an intricate dance... Setting
traps, springing traps, avoiding traps... They become inexplicably drawn,
both physically and emotionally to one another.  Trust and honesty become
major stumbling blocks to them as they each consider the possibility of
entering into a romantic relationship with their opponent.</P>
<P>Mr. Bronsan's cool 007-like demeanor works well for this "man who has
everything."  He plays Crown as someone who has clearly become accustomed,
even bored, with the finer things of life.  That he does so without
turning in a boring performance is noteworthy.</P>
<P>Ms. Russo's character is a bit more enigmatic.  Banning's investigation
seems to be more intuitive than anything else, having as she does a
special prescient ability to somehow sense the truth.  By allowing herself
to get emotionally attached to Crown, her judgment begins to break down,
rendering her helpless to get a read on his true intentions.</P>
<P>Denis Leary (SUICIDE KINGS) does a fine job in his supporting role of
police detective Michael McCann who, from the onset, is obviously
outmatched by both Crown and Banning.  Faye Dunaway, who played the female
lead in the original film, is given a extraneous and meaningless role as
Crown's therapist.</P>
<P>Director John McTiernan (DIE HARD) has crafted a polished and
entertaining romantic suspense thriller.  Like the original (which won an
Academy Award for Best Song by composer Michel Legrand), the remake boasts
a wonderful score, this time by composer Bill Conti.</P>
<P>The biggest difference between the two versions may be most noticeable in
our modern day tolerance of more sexually explicit scenes.  "The Kiss," as
it was come to be known, between Mr. McQueen and Ms. Dunaway has been
replaced by an extended nude coupling of Mr. Bronson and Ms. Russo.
Personally, I look back fondly on the days when filmmakers could
communicate the physical desire of their characters without taking the
clothes off their performers.</P>
<P>Of course, it should be noted that Thomas Crown, with all his billions,
was still fundamentally empty and lost.  His money did not buy him the
peace of heart which he desired.  His life, despite his wealth, became
meaningless and dull, which is why he foolishly began breaking the law by
stealing precious artwork from museums.</P>
<P>Financial wealth is never the culmination of our dreams.  It is not the
answer to our prayers.  It is not the final goal of a godly man or woman.
There are riches that will satisfy but they won't be found in a bank
balance.  Spiritual riches are found in one's heart.</P>
