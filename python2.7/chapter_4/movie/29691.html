<PRE>THE LADY AND THE DUKE (L'ANGLAISE ET LE DUC)
A film review by Jeremiah Kipp
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>"Through a spyglass, I could see everything."  King Louis XVI was
beheaded on January 21, 1793, but instead of visualizing this act of
regicide, legendary auteur Eric Rohmer's The Lady and the Duke observes
from afar.  Consider it a view to a kill made abstract.  A proper
British (yes, British) gentlewoman, Grace Elliott (Lucy Russell), and
her loyal maidservant gaze from a lofty terrace in Meudon at the
glistening city of Paris, where raucous crowds seem tinier than ants. 
The maid narrates what little she sees of the execution through her
telescope (often muttering, "I don't know,") as the sound of cheering
patriots and revolutionaries echoes through the air.  What we don't see
might not be able to hurt us.  Just close your eyes and think of
England.</P>
<P>During times of revolution, the aristocracy may feel a false sense of
calm in their parlor halls, discussing tumultuous events over glasses of
sherry until the walls cave in on them.  Adapted from Elliott's memoirs,
Journal of My Life During the French Revolution, Rohmer's latest
artistic tour-de-force may seem far removed from his domestic comedies
(Tales of the Four Seasons, etc.), a period film set during the most
violent changes in French history.  Resisting the temptation for
grand-scale theatrics, much of The Lady and the Duke is about quiet,
decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine
how to proceed as the world implodes.</P>
<P>Grace Elliott makes for an unlikely protagonist: a headstrong, snobbish
blueblood, one unprepared for the machinations of history that sweep her
along.  A foreigner who accepts the French King as her own, Grace's life
seems defined by fancy attire and lively political debate with her
former lover, the King's hot-blooded cousin, Prince Philipe, Duke of
Orleans (Jean-Claude Dreyfus).  The times are changing, though, and the
gears inch ever closer toward violence.  During The September Massacres
of 1792, she is encountered by a procession of rioters brandishing the
head of the Duke's sister-in-law on a stake.  Rohmer makes a harsh
transition from tranquil, old fashioned, almost stagy parlor scenes to
the swell of an angry mob.  In doing so, he achieves what Braveheart and
The Patriot could not: the face of death.  When Grace sees her friend's
disembodied head on a pole, Rohmer's attention drifts from the societal
change to one woman's reaction shot, laden with hot tears.</P>
<P>Grace finds herself taking in a fugitive from justice, sheltering him
from the mob.  Through her relationship with the Duke, she seeks a
passport for this one activist's escape.  Grace doesn't even understand
her own actions (and the Duke reacts in stunned disbelief at how she
places herself in such danger).  She endures persecution from
Robespierre and his gang of thuggish equalizers, ceaseless police
monitoring, house searches, even a brief imprisonment for harmless
international correspondence.</P>
<P>Maintaining her stiff upper lip and pampered life (her imperious
attitude to the servants never changes), she becomes a heroine through
circumstance.  The events themselves are intrusions upon her person, her
home, and therefore her values.  Aristocracy proves a glass house, one
that can barely withstand the upheaval of stones.  The Duke is called to
vote on the King's punishment, and despite his hours of deliberation
with friends and advisors, talk means nothing in the face of bloody
action (or futile inaction).</P>
<P>The episodic structure creates a wobbly, jarring detachment from the
events of the French Revolution, which serves as metaphor but also
disconnects potential audience identification.  Lazy viewers (and
critics) may also complain that knowledge of French history is required
for enjoyment of The Lady and the Duke.  That's foolery, but brings up
the valid criticism that Rohmer's characters occasionally become
didactic.  Rohmer's imperfect but assured push toward the future remains
staunch and notable for casting a cautious eye upon the past while
taking bold steps forward into an uncertain future.</P>
<P>What may arouse interest in The Lady and the Duke outside of foreign
film enthusiasts with literary and historical passions is Rohmer's use
of cutting edge digital technology as a means of exploring the theme of
artifice as safety net or coping mechanism.  The actors were filmed
against a bluescreen, then placed against painted backdrops recreating
the vastness of 18th century Paris.  This recreation calls attention to
itself in every shot, a Technicolor dream of fanciful buildings and
wide-open streets.  It looks as phony as Titanic, but unlike James
Cameron's debacle, The Lady and the Duke plays with the notion of false
security in those walls of stone.  Why?  They aren't real.  The very
foundation Rohmer's characters stand upon is false, and in their
groundlessness they must discover themselves, in all their insubstantial
glory.</P>
<P>Screened at the 2001 New York Film Festival (feature coming soon).</P>
