Rated R (wartime violence)</P>
<P>The serious specialties and interests of the key 
makers of  "Courage Under Fire" almost guarantee 
quality in this film. Edward Zwick  journalist, 
editor (The New Republic, Rolling Stone), worked on 
TV (features, co-creating "Family," 
"thirtysomething," "My So-Called Life") and directed 
"About Last Night," "Glory," (where Denzel 
Washington figured prominently ), "Legends of the 
Fall." </P>
<P>Vietnam veteran  Patrick Sheane Duncan is the 
writer-director of the excellent Vietnam film "84 
Charlie Mopic," produced and wrote several episodes 
of HBO's "Vietnam War Story," co-wrote and directed 
the documentary series "Medal of Honor." He has 
other credits too, including the script of "Mr. 
Holland." </P>
<P> "Courage" is a fine film, although  I wonder 
whether or not it will remain in our memories. Few 
movies, even good ones, do, for complex reasons. In 
"Courage," Denzel Washington plays tank commander 
Lt. Col. Serling who, during the Gulf War, leads his 
men in a night attack. The men are very macho, 
slightly Hollywoodized. The Allied Coalition is not 
referred to--granted that this war was led by the 
US. This was my passing thought as, somehow, I 
remembered "Objective Burma"  which had the Brits 
howling that in their very own theater of war,  
Errol Flynn and Co. were depicted as the major 
fighters! </P>
<P>Just nit-picking. Another nit is that in the thick 
of a well-shot and choreographed battle, we see 
Arabs on camels improbably taking in the sights from 
atop a high sand dune. My last nit is that our 
soldiers speak of Ay-rabs and Eye-raqis, the way GIs 
said Eye-talians in WWII. </P>
<P>During the fray's confusion, the Colonel gives an 
order that results in the death of one his friends. 
Friendly fire has always been one of the tragedies 
of combat -- and seldom mentioned in movies.</P>
<P>Cut to the post-Gulf Pentagon where Serling, though 
exonerated, drags the burden of a terribly guilty 
conscience. His superior, General Hershberg, orders 
him to review the case of Capt. Karen Walden (Meg 
Ryan), a Medevac pilot posthumously nominated for 
the Medal of Honor for her "courage under fire."  A 
female soldier so honored is a first, one that 
reflects on the new army and public relations. It is 
also press and political fodder as well as 
vote-getting from feminists. (An obnoxiously 
opportunistic White House staffer seems to rejoice 
at all this). </P>
<P>Serling is expected to produce a quick rubber-stamp 
for the nomination, but, taking his job seriously 
(doubly so because of his own trauma), he 
investigates  conscientiously among the survivors of 
the Captain's crew-- and keeps running into 
inconsistencies, gaps and   contradictions. </P>
<P>The situation has been compared to that of the 
famous "Rashomon" You can see why, yet the 
connection is tenuous. In the Japanese classic four 
unconnected people told different stories of the 
same event because of different perceptions and 
memories. In "Courage,"
it is the interpretations that are different, for 
reasons I will not reveal. All the while, flashbacks 
illustrate the many faces of Capt. Walden, each one 
as told by  a different interviewee. (It's of course 
a good old device. See "Citizen Kane" for its best 
illustration).  </P>
<P>Denzel Washington is more than a star. He is one of 
our top actors and in his unassuming ways, a screen 
presence. His facial and body expressions fill very 
well a small but powerful range of feelings: private 
pain, a deep belief in the honor of the Army, a 
dedication to truth. Even when almost commanded to 
drop the investigation, Serling remains like a quiet 
bulldog that won't let go. His methods are simple, 
both logical and intuitive, efficacious. Although he 
is no Hercule Poirot or Lieutenant Columbo, he has 
Columbo's double-checking mindset. When, like Peter 
Falk, he says casually: "OK. One more question," you 
can see that he is on to a new clue.</P>
<P>There are moments of highly-charged emotion, yet on 
the whole the film does not come through as really 
engaging or affecting. I can't tell exactly why on a 
single viewing, but I believe that this is caused by 
the movie's very polish and high production values, 
the neat, predictable outcome, and the ambitious 
editing that zig-zags more than necessary.  </P>
<P>Would-be impassive yet warm Denzel Washington 
carries the movie  with the help of  Matt Damon who 
excels in a nuanced role stretching from jocular and 
naive to tortured soul. Lou Diamond Phillips has a 
melodramatic, over-the-top but effective part. The 
acting by most others is, at a minimum, competent. 
Reviewers have split into  I-hate-Ryan and 
Ryan-is-great camps. Again, after just one screening 
I can't really take sides but my impression of Meg 
Ryan was that she did all that was expected of her. </P>
<P>In spite of people lying to, and authorities leaning 
on Serling, this is a decent picture in the moral 
sense. Essentially it is the story of a suffering 
man,  of a woman he never met, and of convincingly 
shown reactions of soldiers under extreme pressures. 
The battlefield events are well-handled, done with 
technical virtuosity but without gung-ho heroics or 
graphic and gratuitous violence. The political and 
the women-in-arms aspects are incidental. At the 
same time, there is a solid subtext that could bear 
the title of a famous 19th Century French book, 
"Military Grandeur and Servitude."</P>
