<PRE>                                NOBODY'S FOOL
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Paul Newman, Jessica Tandy, Bruce Willis, Dylan Walsh,
           Melanie Griffith, Pruitt Taylor Vince.
Screenplay/Director:  Robert Benton.</P>
<P>     Maybe it's envy, maybe it's years of Hollywood trying to sell
every pretty boy or gorgeous girl as the Next Big Thing, and maybe
it's some combination of the two.  For whatever reason, both
moviegoers and critics alike seem to have incredible difficulty
acknowledging that attractiveness and talent could go hand in hand.
Paul Newman was nearly sixt before it became widely acknowledged
that there was more to this guy than his famous blue eyes; he could
actually act.  When he won as Best Actor in 1987 for THE COLOR OF
MONEY, it was widely considered a lifetime achievement award, but
apparently Newman had at least one more trick up his sleeve:
NOBODY'S FOOL, a small, quiet drama driven by Newman's delightfully
weathered lead performance.</P>
<P>     Newman plays Donald "Sully" Sullivan, an often-unemployed
construction worker living in the sleepy upstate New York town of
North Bath.  After suffering an on-the-job knee injury, Sully's days
are largely spent playing poker, bantering with his landlady
(Jessica Tandy) and trying to squeeze some compensation out of the
construcion company's owner Carl Roebuck (Bruce Willis).  But during
this holiday season, there are other opportunities.  In town for
Thanksgiving is Sully's son Peter (Dylan Walsh), a son he's had an
uneasy relationship with since Sully left the family when Peter was
a baby.  Peter is having marital troubles of his own, and when Peter
stays in town with his own son, Sully has the chance to look back on
his life and begin to take on some degree of responsibility for it.</P>
<P>     Writer/director Robert Benton has a gift for making low-key,
relationship-based films (KRAMER VS. KRAMER, PLACES IN THE HEART),
and NOBODY'S FOOL is a worthy heir to that tradition.  Benton uses
his snow-covered locations beautifully, practically turning North
Bath into one of the characters in the story.  In many ways,
NOBODY'S FOOL is as much about North Bath as it is about Sully.
This is a town where everyone really does know everyone else, where
local disputes are settled by a judge (Philip Bosco) who addresses
people by their first names, and where a guy like Sully, to all
outward appearances a loser in life, is still treated with a basic
respect for his independent mind.  When a local banker attempts to
bring a theme park to North Bath, it is a demonstration of a
fundamental misunderstanding of what the town is about:  a sense of
family.</P>
<P>     That connectedness makes the relationships between characters
in NOBODY'S FOOL a rare joy.  There is not a mean-spirited moment to
be found, because even the characters who don't get along treat each
other as fellow humans.  Sully's feud with Carl is one of the few
external conflicts in the film, manifested primarily in a game of
stealing a snow-blower back and forth, but even that exchange is
essentially good-humored.  It's one of the things that makes Sully
so appealing as a character:  as ornery as he can be, he always
treats people decently.  His paternal relationship with sadsack
co-worker Rub (Pruitt Taylor Vince) is a pleasure to watch unfold,
and a simple moment when Sully helps a senile older woman back to
her home is handled without an ounce of condescension.  It's
ironic--and perhaps part of the point of NOBODY'S FOOL--that the one
relationship which seems forced is that between Sully and Peter.
Still, there's something strangely satisfying about a meeting
between an estranged father and son which doesn't include a shouting
match or tears.</P>
<P>     However, the main reason Sully is so appealing is Paul Newman.
He has reached a point in his career where he doesn't really play
characters any more; instead, he slips into them like the flannel
shirts Sully favors.  That is in no way meant to belittle what
Newman does as an actor.  The fact is that he makes it all look
effortless, as though he's really been Sully all his life, and
someone just happened to turn the camera on at this moment.  The
background for the character (an abusive father, his own abandonment
of his family) seems almost tacked on so the movie seems to be about
something more, but Newman doesn't really need it.  What we are
watching is the story of a man who is somehow coming to terms with
all the choices he has made in his life, and choosing to move
forward rather than stand in place.  It's Newman's gift that he can
do all that with a well-placed sigh and a twinkle in those eyes.</P>
