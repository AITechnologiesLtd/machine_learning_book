<PRE>LETHAL WEAPON 4
A film review by Andrew Hicks
Copyright 1998 Andrew Hicks</PRE>
<PRE>(1998) **1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        I don't know if there's ever been any fourth installment of a 
movie series that's been truly worth watching (um, BATMAN AND 
ROBIN?), and from the beginning it's obvious that LETHAL WEAPON 4 
won't improve upon its predecessors. It's a disappointment, too, 
because the first three movies in the series were good, sometimes great 
action comedies. This one only reinforces the theory that two decent 
sequels is all anyone can hope for, which doesn't bode well for the DIE 
HARD 4 that will no doubt be forced upon us in the years to come.</P>
<P>        That's not to say LETHAL WEAPON 4 isn't fun at times. 
Watching cops Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Murtaugh (Danny Glover) in 
action again, even if they're starting to look a little old for this kind of 
movie, is like hanging out with old friends after a long absence. It's 
good to see them again, but things aren't the way they were.</P>
<P>        In essence, this movie is little more than a reunion of LETHAL 
WEAPON characters. There's the loudmouth accountant-turned-P.I. (Joe 
Pesci) and the sexy karate chick (Rene Russo, also well into her forties 
now), and the familiar Murtaugh family. The movie ends in a series of 
nostalgic photo album shots from this and earlier LETHAL WEAPON 
movies, so at least it knows the main thing going for it is the 
familiarity of moviegoers.</P>
<P>        About the only thing new in LETHAL WEAPON 4 is Chris Rock, 
as Chris Rock. He plays Butters, a detective secretly married to 
Murtaugh's daughter. A lot of the movie's comic relief scenes revolve 
around Butters kissing up to his unknowing father-in-law, who thinks 
he's coming on to him. So there's that inevitable sitcom standby, where 
one person's confession is completely misinterpreted by the other 
person, leaving a knowing audience to chuckle. It goes back to the "I 
Love Lucy" days, and is about as recycled as Pesci's "they f*ck you 
with the cell phone" speech.</P>
<P>        Some of it is funny, though. I forgave some of the reused 
elements just because I loved the characters, which I think was the 
filmmakers' aim. And the movie is still pretty good because the action 
is more or less original. The traditional Opening Scene That Has 
Nothing To Do With The Plot has a psycho with a flamethrower and a 
machine gun out on a city street, torching and shooting everything in 
sight. The difference with part four is that the two leads don't seem to 
take any of the unrealistic action seriously, which spoils any illusion of 
danger. The solution to the torch guy is to have Murtaugh undress and 
flap his arms like a chicken to distract the guy, which may actually be 
too silly for a Leslie Nielson movie.</P>
<P>        The rest of the plot isn't much more serious. There's the 
FATHER OF THE BRIDE II gimmick of dual pregnancies, this time with 
Murtaugh's daughter ("Pleasee let the father be black") and Russo, still 
shacked up with Gibson but without marriage on the mind. The morals 
of these action movie heroes, I tell you... The crime side of things 
involves some Chinese gangsters (headed by badass fighter Jet Li, 
whose maiden name was Ski) who are smuggling illegal aliens in at 
$35,000 a head and are printing up some counterfeit money to buy 
the criminal Four Fathers. Or something like that; forgive me for not 
having a press kit to explain all these convoluted plots to me.</P>
<P>        Rest assured any pause for dialogue is just a momentary lull 
of action. And since LETHAL WEAPON 4's strong suit is its action, it's a 
good thing there's plenty of it. Like I said, the characters don't take it 
seriously, so there's no chance we will. Everyone's a lot more glib here 
than in the other movies in the series, and that's usually not a good 
thing. Think of how smug everyone was in HUDSON HAWK and you can 
imagine how good a LETHAL WEAPON 5 would probably be.</P>
