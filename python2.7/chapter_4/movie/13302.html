                             The Opposite of Sex
                    A movie review by "Average Joe" Barlow
                             (c) Copyright 1998</PRE>
<PRE>STARRING:   Christina Ricci, Lisa Kudrow, Lyle Lovett, Martin Donovan,
            Ivan Sergei
DIRECTOR:   Dan Roos
WRITER:     Dan Roos
RATED/YEAR: R/1998</PRE>
<P>        Actress Christina Ricci closes a door on her life in Dan Roos'
brilliant new film, "The Opposite of Sex."  Gone forever are the days of
Wednesday Addams and "That Darn Cat"; here, Ricci delivers a performance
that is strong, confident, memorable... and more adult than we have any
right to expect from an actress her age.  (The end credits actually carry
a message assuring that "No minors engaged in any sexual activities during
the filming of this movie.")
        To say that sixteen year-old Dedee, the character Ricci plays, is
a bad seed would be a gross understatement.  She's sassy, mean, tough,
and so resentful of her parents that she hurls stones and obscenities at
the coffin during her stepfather's funeral.  She chain-smokes, has no real
friends, and is so fond of the physical aspects of life that when she
suddenly finds herself pregnant, any number of boys/men could be the father.
        Hating the atmosphere at home, Dedee flees to the house of her rich
gay brother, a man she has seen exactly once in her life.  Putting on her
most pathetic-looking face, the manipulative Dedee weepily asks to stay.
Her brother Bill (Martin Donovan), taken in by her charm and apparant
helplessness, caves in at once.  Poor Bill doesn't realise that he's making
the biggest mistake of his life.
        All goes well until the restless Dedee takes a liking to Bill's
boyfriend Matt (Ivan Sergei).  The two forge an uneasy friendship, with
the homophobic Dedee trying to convince Matt that he'd enjoy sex with a
woman if he'd only try it.  Dedee offers him her body, and eventually
Matt sucuumbs... giving Dedee the opportunity to name Matt as the father
of her child.  Matt, who isn't exactly the sharpest stick in the bunch,
believes her completely.
        All this takes place in the first few minutes of the film; the
rest of the movie depicts Bill and his friend Lucia (Lisa Kudrow) chasing
Matt and Dedee across North America as her pregnancy develops.  Along the
way the characters will fall in and out of love with each other, commit
felonies, and wonder what the hell they're doing.  As well they should.
        That capsule summary may make the film sound like nothing more than
an empty-headed teen-comedy, but the film is more than this-- much more.
It's closer to "Taxi Driver" than "Cannonball Run."  Roos presents us with a
movie as heavy on satire as darkness.  This is a staggeringly funny film,
but an underlying intelligence runs through it, thanks to the outstanding
screenplay.  It's an undeniably dark and twisted ride... yet it also
contains the highest joke-to-scene ratio of any movie since "Clerks."  The
movie's split-personality is a big part of its charm.
        The film is narrated by Dedee, and she constantly reminds us that
we shouldn't like her.  She knows she's a bitch and couldn't care less.
"I don't have a heart of gold, and I don't grow one by the end of the movie,
okay?" she warns in the opening voice-over, and it's true.  But amazingly,
Dedee never feels like a caricature or stereotype.  Ricci plays the role
with all her heart, giving us a memorable character that manages to grow
and change over the course of the movie despite her best efforts not to.
Dedee will never be Mother Teresa, and that's fine, but neither is she a
one-note heroine/villain.  The life Ricci brings to the role has to be
seen to be believed.  There's already talk of an Oscar nomination for her,
and I couldn't agree more.
        Ricci is obviously getting the most attention of the film's cast,
but she's not the only one doing admirable work.  Just try not to smile at
the amiable Carl (Lyle Lovett), a shy policeman who only has eyes for
Lucia... who in turn only has eyes for Bill... who's still in love with
Matt... who ran off with Dedee... who feels alone.  Moments like these are
exactly why the film works so well: love is not always a wonderful thing.
It frequently hurts, disappoints, offends, and frustrates.  Carl is easy to
love; Lovett's portrayl conveys the sense of longing we've all felt,
wanting someone who doesn't know we exist.  "Real" moments like this are
what make the movie soar.
        This is admittedly not a film that has much use for political
correctness; it will offend as many as it thrills (indeed, it already has).
But if you're not bothered by a movie that challenges you, get to a theater
immediately.  This is by far the best film I've seen this year.</P>
