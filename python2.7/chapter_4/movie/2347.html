<PRE>                                SHADOWLANDS
                     A film review by Alex Lopez-Ortiz
                      Copyright 1994 Alex Lopez-Ortiz</PRE>
<P>Starring: Anthony Hopkins, Debra Winger, Edward Hardwicke, John Wood,
          Michael Denison, Joseph Mazzello
Screenplay: William Nicholson
Director: Richard Attenborough</P>
<P>     Some people might construe SHADOWLANDS to be a movie about
C. S. Lewis, the Christian writer. Nothing further from the truth.
SHADOWLANDS is the portrayal of an intense romance between a troubled
man (C. S. Lewis, British writer and philosopher) and a caring woman
(Joy Davidman Gresham, American poet).</P>
<P>     Why then, the reader may ask, use historical names and places if
the film is not to dwell on the historic figures?</P>
<P>     Because C. S. Lewis, being the powerful writer that he was, left a
written trail of his feelings and tribulations during the seven year
period for which he knew Joy.</P>
<P>     In other words, the movie is a real story and it feels very much
so.  That is the strength of the film. One feels moved by both the joy
and the pain endured by Jack (as C. S. Lewis was known to his family and
friends) and Joy. There is genuine tragedy and happiness in this film.</P>
<P>     The script, superbly recreates and quotes C.S. Lewis, and it is
through beautiful dialogue and prose that we learn of the feelings
between the two of them. Brief references to Lewis's work and credo let
the viewer share on C.S. Lewis's perspective on the events at hand.</P>
<P>     Debra Winger and Anthony Hopkins perform flawlessly, and the rest
of the cast, with their sober performances let "Jack" and "Joy" shine
in the screen as they should.</P>
<P>     Photography, while unobtrusive, is no less refined than the rest
of the movie. Attenborough (and his director of photography) brings
about a sequence of gray/yellowish tones that accurately portray the
landscape and moods of Old Blighty and especially the post-war period.</P>
<P>     SHADOWLANDS is, in a nutshell, an experience not to be forgotten.</P>
<P>     I could say more, but I would only be repeating commendations
already made in this newsgroup by Berardinelli (SHADOWLANDS.2331) and
Renshaw (SHADOWLANDS.2332).</P>
<PRE>Rating: 9.1 out of 10</PRE>
