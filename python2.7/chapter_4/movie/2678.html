<P>     There seems to be a common failing amongst the last decade's
screen versions of the exploits of comic book-type heroes.  Most of
these genre movies--BATMAN, DICK TRACY, THE CROW, and now THE SHADOW -
have been visually impressive (stunning, even), but lacking in the
character department.  Who is Bruce Wayne, really?  Or Dick Tracy?  Or
Lamont Cranston?</P>
<P>     Given its due, THE SHADOW probably does the best of the
aforementioned movies in creating a personality for its title
character, but it still makes one yearn for the not-so-distant days of
Christopher Reeves' SUPERMAN, when there was more than the shell of a
man beneath the cape.  Alas, style has supplanted substance, and all
this sort of film seems to need is a brooding atmosphere into which the
avenging angel can swoop.</P>
<P>     THE SHADOW tries to say something about the human condition ("Who
knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men?  The Shadow knows."), and
it has an interesting reason for why its title character is who he is.
Back in Asia during the early 1930s, Lamont Cranston (Alec Baldwin) was
an evil drug lord, given to slaughter and debauchery until a priest
shows him the error of his ways and forces redemption upon him.</P>
<P>     By 1939, Cranston has returned to New York and, as the Shadow, is
busy cleaning up the city's criminal element.  However, while the thugs
and mobsters of Manhattan don't offer much threat to someone who can
"cloud men's minds," danger arrives in the person of Shiwan Khan (John
Lone), the last descendant of Genghis and Cranston's psychic equal.
Khan's stated goal is to conquer the half of the world that his
ancestor failed to, and in order to do this, he plunders the United
States' scientific laboratories, where he comes up with a pair of
brilliant scientists (played by Ian McKellen and Tim Curry) and sets to
work building an atomic bomb.  Meanwhile, not only is Cranston having
difficulty trying to locate Khan's hideout, but his identity has been
uncovered by Margo Lane (Penelope Ann Miller), the daughter of one of
Khan's captives.</P>
<P>     The most interesting element of THE SHADOW is understanding what
gives Cranston his powers: the harnessing of the evil in his own
heart.  With Khan, we get to see the antithesis--someone who allows
that evil free reign.  Ultimately, of course, the two must clash to see
which facet of power has the greater strength.</P>
<P>     THE SHADOW's problems have nothing to do with the basic premise;
rather, they are flaws in execution.  The setup promises something more
invigorating than it delivers.  The entire "use the atomic bomb to hold
New York hostage" plotline is trite.  There's nothing especially
interesting about it, or the man behind it.  As a villain, Shiwan Khan
lacks a certain flair.  Although John Lone's portrayal is anything-but-
understated, Khan still doesn't seem all that impressive or
threatening, even as he gets closer to achieving his desire.  He's just
another megalomaniac with unusual powers.</P>
<P>     Alec Baldwin's portrayal of the invisible avenger is suitably
creepy (although his makeup job could have been a little more
impressive), but his version of Cranston is dull.  Much as was true for
Michael Keaton in BATMAN, the costume seems to bring out the
performance.  Penelope Ann Miller looks very fetching in her gauzy 30s
costumes with their plunging necklines, but her role is essentially the
thankless one of the hero's love interest.  Tim Curry and Jonathan
Winters are kept relatively in check in supporting roles.  Veteran
British actor Ian McKellen is vastly underused.</P>
<P>     Will the Shadow be back?  As always, box office take will be the
determining factor.  If there is a next time, it might be intriguing to
further examine those dark forces prowling Cranston's heart instead of
having him chase around a warrior with delusions of godhood.  Or,
failing that, the producers could do something that would render plot
and all attempts at subtlety void:  bring in Jack Nicholson to play the
bad guy.</P>
