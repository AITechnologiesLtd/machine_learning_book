<P>The British woman Anna Leonowens (1834-1914) did exist. When she was 
24, her husband -- a Major of the Indian Army-- died.  She lived in 
Singapore with her two children when, in 1862 (she was then about 28) 
she accepted the offer of Siam's King Mongkut, to come to the palace 
in Bangkok and educate his many, many children. She was a teacher 
here for five years. Later she wrote two books about her experience. 
In this century, Margaret Landon, an American who had spent over ten 
years in Siam, upon her return  to the USA wrote articles about Mrs. 
Leonowens. Later (1941), in an  amalgam of biographical and 
historical facts, plus fiction, she published  a novel based on 
Anna's life. This became the 1946 film, "Anna and the King of Siam" 
with Rex Harrison in his first American movie and Irene Dunne.</P>
<P>Then came the Rodgers and Hammerstein Broadway musical "The King and 
I," from the Landon novel. Yul Brynner, in his first leading role, 
was the King. Later yet, the stage musical became a movie musical, 
also with Brynner (who won one of the films 5 Oscars) and  Deborah 
Kerr.</P>
<P>The December 1999 release is mostly Instant Visual Gratification. 
Extremely lavish, beautifully produced, staged and photographed, it 
was filmed in Malaysia and not Thailand, which has officially banned 
all Anna/King movies. Still, at two-and-a-half hours it is even 
longer than "The King and I" which was stretched out by song and 
dance.</P>
<P>Thailand is the modern name of Siam, as most people know. Or do they? 
A newspaper article today reports: "A survey out last month found 
that among 500 students ages 12 to 17 from across the country, 
one-third reported learning about the war in school. The study, 
commissioned by the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, shows that nearly 
one-third couldn't correctly identify Vietnam's continent; 3%, or 15 
students, named North America." And that:"...when veterans ask 
students who won the war, as many as half say the United States, even 
though one- to three-quarters have relatives who fought."</P>
<P>The basic story is the confrontation of East and West and the 
friendship (more exactly what the French call an "amitie amoureuse") 
between the king and the governess. I will not waste space by 
summarizing a plot familiar from the earlier versions to many.  Anna 
is put in charge of the King's boys and girls, 58 of them in this 
version. His Majesty has several dozen wives and concubines, and this 
in Bangkok which today is the sex-for-hire capital of the world. 
However, nowhere do we even glimpse a bare breast, or a soupcon of 
lovemaking.</P>
<P>The monarch is played by Chow Yun-Fat, a superstar of Hong-Kong 
action films. Except for his approving an execution --but what's a 
beheading or two compared to contemporary screen mayhem?-- the 
demi-God Mongkut is portrayed by Mr. Chow (or is it Mr. Yun-Fat?) as 
a good-looking, fine speaker of English and above all as a sensitive 
and truly sweet man. As in real life, the King tries to initiate 
opening Siam to the West.</P>
<P>Anna arrives in Siam with her lively son Louis, a boy not impressed 
by titles or ceremonials. She does bring with her a sort of jingoism 
(though the term was not born until 1887), which could be summed as 
"There's one right way, It is the British way."</P>
<P>But then, this is a 1999 movie. It has to be Politically Correct. Not 
only is there no hint of the old Britannia's disrespect of WOGs 
(Worthy Oriental Gentlemen, a supercilious appellation), but Anna 
with miraculous speed learns some Siamese, quickly appreciates the 
strange new ways and quirks, fully (well, almost fully) understands 
the people and their land. While always polite, she is outspoken, a 
true Women's Libber.</P>
<P>Jodie Foster does this with cool, elegance, a pointy face and a 
reserve that make her hidden feelings quite British. British too is 
her accent. Having read somewhere a denigration of that accent 
(critics will say anything)  I checked out some reviews from 
London--where the movie is in 42 theaters. The critics confirmed that 
her Brit-speak was very good.</P>
<P>Now, except for the splendid production values, Mr. Yun-Fat steals 
the show in ways which are subtle compared to those of Rex and Yul. 
Those two got much mileage from their theatricality. They were, in 
their way, little Caesars vis-a-vis all, including Anna. Rex was a 
pre-echo of his autocratic Professor Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady." 
His main weapon was his voice. Yul's was his physical energy and 
bluster. Both were clearly enjoying their rather comic, "fun" roles. 
But here, the King is a thoughtful fellow, a thinker even, vigorous 
yet on the  gentle side -- and a crypto-romantic. He calls attention 
to himself more by quietness than by flamboyance.</P>
<P>Countering much of Anna's political correctness is the portrayal of 
Britain's expansionist policy. Queen Victoria is not yet Empress of 
India (1876) but her country's imperialism is woven into the story, 
notably through a crass merchant, Mr. Kincaid, and politely haughty 
diplomats, especially a Lord played by Mister Superjowls, Geoffrey 
Palmer, familiar as Lionel in the TV series "As Time Goes By."</P>
<P>The theme of British interventionism runs throughout, but in a 
spasmodic, un-rounded way. It starts with attacks by killers who 
would destabilize the Siamese monarchy. Presumably, they come from 
neighboring Burma, which is a pawn of Perfidious Albion. This leads 
to a murky political subplot, with surprises which are essentially 
unnecessary, distracting, implausible--in fact silly-- and  clichés 
such as blow-them-ups found in action flicks. The movie's ending is 
downright soupy.</P>
<P>The bad guys are initially called "death squads," which is an 
anachronistic expression. There is no lack of anachronisms or 
historical goofs. In the film, at his first ever European-style 
reception for foreigners, the King's brood sings "Daisy, Daisy" years 
before the bicycle built for two became a reality. His Majesty, in 
his first ever dance (he had been a monk for many years), and, mind 
you, a dance with a European woman, proves a fine, agile waltzer. He 
offers elephants to the American President, receives a letter of 
thanks from Abraham Lincoln, who mentions the battle of Antietam 
(September 1862)  as causing 70,000 deaths, whereas these were closer 
to 27, 000.</P>
<P>Yun-Fat's Monkgut is infinitely nicer than the man depicted in the 
real Anna's journals. These are full of inventions as well as self 
aggrandizements.  His flirtation with Anna --whom he addresses as 
"Ma'am" while the other notables say "Sir" to her--is the biggest of 
all fabulations and anachronisms. In reality, Mongkut (1804-1868) was 
58 when Anna entered his service. In reality too, research has 
concluded that Anna never even met the King; that she was a teacher, 
not a governess; that, that, that ---ad infinitum....</P>
<P>There are, in many languages, sayings to the effect that people who 
come from far away can be major liars. Anna's diaries, written when 
Siam was still a "terra incognita" to most of the world, overflow 
with fabrications. It is not surprising that the understandably 
touchy Thailand of today has banned successively all the movie 
versions of Anna's "story," and have been particularly offended at 
the portrayals of King Mongkut. The current movie, coming in the age 
of the Internet, has caused a furore and a flood of messages from all 
sources. Thai ones, including protests by students; non-Thai, 
including exposes by researchers.</P>
<P>The only sensible way to consider the problem is to look at all the 
Anna-King movies as fantasy-fiction.</P>
<P>In version #3,  over and above all else, the spectacle is the thing. 
It was a huge undertaking which also involved  Oscar-worthy blending 
of photography, special effects and computer-generated images. From 
the palace to huge statues, from the grandest barges since 
"Cleopatra" to small, labor-intensive throwaway details, this is a 
paean to imagery, whether invented or not.. I'd love to see the 
movie's out-takes.</P>
<P>If the sights are painstakingly cultivated, the sounds lag behind, as 
they often do in films today. Inauspiciously, the opening has a 
muddle of conflicting noises, music and speech. The truly colossal 
list of end-credits rolls to a dumb, jarring, irrelevant and horrible 
song written by George Fenton and two other culprits. "How Can I Not 
Love You" is sung in an awful Junior High voice.</P>
