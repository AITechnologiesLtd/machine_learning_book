[video] "12:01"
A Postview, copyright p-m agapow 1997</PRE>
<P>A well-meaning but bumbling clerk (Silverman) takes a shine to
one of the scientists (Slater) at his workplace but she is gunned
down in front of him.  Mysteriously, that night he is flung back
in time to replay this day endlessly.  He investigates a sinister
experiment at the heart of both the murder and his time travel.</P>
<P>Previously, this Richard Lupoff story was filmed as a terrific
and much blacker short feature, also called "12:01" (1990) and
starring the wonderful Kurtwood "can you fly Bobby?"  Smith.
(Highly recommended, if you can get your hands on it.)  It also
bears a close resemblance to "Groundhog Day", of which it has
been called the flipside (cv Leonard Maltin).  As the two were
released in the same year, it's difficult to see how much
influence there could have been.  But "12:01" (1993) seems to
have snipped out the noir and nihilism of "12:01" (1990) and
substituted the romanticism of "Groundhog Day" without the
morality tale aspects.</P>
<PRE>Confused?  Me too.</PRE>
<P>"12:01" (1993, that's this one, okay?)  lumbers itself with
enough liabilities it's a wonder it ever recovers.  Jonathan
Silverman (remember?  "Weekend at Bernies"?  1 and 2?)  attempts
to scrap up enough charisma before the bank forecloses on his
acting career.  Helen Slater ("Supergirl") wrestles with
blandness.  Martin Landau as the head of the research laboratory
is left to chew the scenery.  Add one murder plot, some
artificial urgency, a sprinkle of dumb coincidence and allow to
simmer.  Serve lukewarm.</P>
<P>But while "12:01" never quite lives up to its predecessor, it
manages some competence of its own.  There is a consistent logic
behind the time loop and Silverman's slow realisation of what is
going on and his subsequent reaction are scripted with some care.
(Some care.  Some dumbness and also some care.)  A modicum of
pacing and a lack of the saccharine that (for me) ruined
"Groundhog Day" helps make what could have been a disaster into a
minor but diverting story.</P>
<P>Wonderful it ain't, but it passes muster.  [**/ok] and one of
the better episodes of "Space 1999" on the Sid and Nancy scale.</P>
