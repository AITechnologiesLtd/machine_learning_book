Grade:  F</PRE>
<P>You know something, Christmas is not about presents.  It's about over-hyped 
holiday films with lots of merchandising and product tie-ins.  At least that 
would seem to be the message of "The Grinch," which has been advertised since 
last Christmas and whose logo is currently plastered all over stores.  
Hollywood expects us to ignore this cynical greed as the movie scolds us 
about losing the true spirit of the season.</P>
<P>You know the plot:  there's this evil furry green guy called the Grinch (Jim 
Carrey) who lives on a mountain overlooking Whoville.  Down below all the 
Whos are preparing for their Whobilation, but the Grinch is determined to 
steal their Christmas.</P>
<P>The movie is, of course, a live-action version of the beloved children's 
book, which was previously adapted into a 1966 TV special by Looney Tunes 
animator Chuck Jones.  It's rare that a big budget Hollywood release is 
shamed by a thirty-year-old half-hour cartoon, but that's the case when 
Jones' version is compared to Ron Howard's.  The TV Grinch hit all the right 
notes:  Boris Karloff's soft, deep narration; Thurl Ravenscroft singing "Mr. 
Grinch"; Max the dog weighed down by the gigantic antler tied to his head; 
and the Grinch's wide, toothless grin.</P>
<P>By contrast, the movie hits one sour note after another.  First, there are 
the numerous bad choices that Jeffrey Price and Peter Seaman made in padding 
out the short book into a 105-minute movie.  Young wide-eyed Cindy Lou Who 
(Taylor Momsen) is depressed about the misplaced priorities of her parents 
(Bill Irwin and Molly Shannon) during the holiday season.  She begins to 
sympathize with the Grinch, who turns out to be surprisingly sympathetic.  
Cindy Lou discovers that the Grinch turned tearfully away from Whoville in 
grammar school when he was publicly humiliated while expressing his love for 
the prettiest girl in the class, Martha May Whovier (played as an adult by 
Christine Baranski).  Are we expected to like the Grinch, hate the Whos, and 
want him to steal Christmas?  The Grinch isn't even the villain here; that 
role is filled by the corrupt Mayor of Whoville (Jeffrey Tambor) who was the 
Grinch's rival for Martha's affection.  Not only are the characters 
needlessly complex, but the once-simple plot becomes so convoluted that the 
actual theft of Christmas seems like an afterthought.</P>
<P>The casting choices aren't any better than the screenwriting decisions.  Jim 
Carrey seems woefully miscast.  While his face is so supple that the rubber 
make-up seems superfluous, Carrey brings nothing else to the role.  His 
accent keeps changing; I assume he was shooting for Karloff, but he ends up 
sounding like a weird slurry of Richard Nixon, Sean Connery, and Cartman from 
"South Park."  Not knowing what else to do during his many scenes alone in 
the Grinch's home, Carrey falls back on his stand-up comedy and clowns around 
Ace Ventura-style.  Needless to say, his wise-cracking antics don't quite fit 
the character of the Grinch, who is an embittered loner filled with hate.</P>
<P>Little Taylor Momsen brings little to role of Cindy Lou except big eyes and a 
cute smile.  She would have been fine if Cindy Lou was limited to her 
original purpose in the Seuss story (finding "Santa" in her living room 
stealing the tree).  However, the expanded script makes Cindy as important as 
the Grinch, and Momsen is not up to the challenge.</P>
<P>Bottom Line:  When you're stealing Christmas (movies), leave this one behind.</P>
