<PRE>CRIMSON TIDE (1995)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2001</PRE>
<P>In the week following WTC bombing, many commentators
couldn't fail to notice that America, same as many other
countries in history, had its military prepared to fight the
past rather than the future war. Same thing can be said for
Hollywood, since in many 1990s films Russians continued to
be convenient villains and the source of greatest danger for
Western world, all that despite the collapse of Soviet
Empire and its would-be successors being pathethic losers
unable to restore the Evil Empire even in their back yard.
One of such examples can be found in the plot of CRIMSON
TIDE, 1995 submarine thriller directed by Tony Scott. The
story begins with civil war erupting in Russia and
anti-Western rebels seizing nuclear base in Vladivostok.
American nuclear submarine "USS Alabama", commanded by old
and experienced Captain Frank Ramsey (played by Gene
Hackman), is sent to Pacific in order to watch over the base
and retaliate in case of rebels launching nuclear strike on
America. In the last minute his XO is replaced by Lieutenant
Ron Hunter (played by Denzel Washington), intellectual whose
humanist ideas of waging war create discomfort in
no-nonsense Captain. Two of them are going to settle their
differences, at least temporarily, as their vessel
approcahes hostile waters and gets engaged in conflict with
Russian renegade submarine. As a result, the communication
equipment is damaged, but not after receiving the order to
launch nuclear strike. This order was, however, followed
with another one, which is interrupted and can't be
deciphred. While Captain Ramsey wants to follow the order
and launch the strike, his XO is convinced that the next
message represents the cancellation of the original order.
Not wanting to risk start of nuclear exchange over
communication failure, Hunter starts a mutiny aboard the
submarine.</P>
<P>CRIMSON TIDE is not the film that should enter Top 100
lists, but it nevertheless represents one of the brighter
spots in the career of Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson.
The reason for that can be found in the script by Michael
Schiffer that manages to rise above the cliches and
predictability of action film formula, and this
accomplishment is even more impressive when we consider that
CRIMSON TIDE in its original form became the object of
script-doctoring by numerous writers like Robert Towne,
Steven Zaillian and Quentin Tarantino. Usually the
screenwriting by committee produces disastrous results, but
not this time. The suspense and the action in this film is
clearly constrained within the framework of the plot and
terrible dilemma facing the main characters - whether to act
and risk starting nuclear holocaust or show restraint and
allow mother country to be anihillated. Even more
interesting thing about CRIMSON TIDE is that this film
doesn't take sides in this debate - both viewpoints are
shown to be valid and justifiable under the circumstances.
Good direction by Tony Scott and strong acting performances
by Hackman, Washington and numerous character actors (among
which Viggo Mortensen and George Dzundza are the most
impressive) guarantee that this film is going to be as
entertaining as it was thought-provoking. Even the usual
Hollywood cop out ending and sometimes too boring musical
score by Hans Zimmer aren't enough to diminish generally
positive impression given by this film, one of the rare
1990s action films that is going to be as engaging now as it
was half a decade ago.</P>
