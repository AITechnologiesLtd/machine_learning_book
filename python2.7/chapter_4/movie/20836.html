<P>On the way home from a recent movie screening, a friend of mine was
telling me about the sorry state of modern cinema. I remarked that I'm
looking forward to so many different movies this autumn. He replied
that the only flick he was looking forward to was "Black Cat, White
Cat", from the director of "the all-time greatest film", "Time Of The
Gypsies".</P>
<P>His recommendation and the film's title intrigued me, so I rented
myself a copy of Emir Kusturica's "Gypsies". It took a while for the
film to grab me, but once it did I was mesmerized beyond belief.  The
film, about a young man who rebels against his Gypsy ways in order to
make a fortune, was both funny and powerful. Once the end credits
finished rolling, and I was still glued to my chair, Kusturica had
worked his way into the "favorite directors" section of my mind.</P>
<P>In 1995, Emir Kusturica won the Palme D'Or at Cannes for his overlong
epic "Underground", which told the tale of 50 war-torn years in his
native Yugoslavia. However, when he was attacked by the French press
for being not sufficiently anti-Serb, he publicly vowed to give up
filmmaking. But luckily, a couple of years later he was convinced to
embark on a documentary about Gypsy musicians, and that documentary
has turned into the fictional "Black Cat, White Cat".</P>
<P>Like all of Kusturica's films, this one is centered around a quirky
wedding ceremony. A man named Matko (Bajram Severdzan) has engineered
a failed train robbery, and to repay his debt to the wealthy Dadan
(Srdan Todorovic, from "Underground"), he must force his unwilling
son, Zare (Florijan Ajdini) to marry Dadan's tiny sister. The result
is the uneven, rollicking Gypsy fun that has become Kusturica's
trademark.</P>
<P>All his films have complicated plotlines, but the story is never the
point.  Kusturica's films are about culture, and the ironic effects it
has on our daily life. Music is always a big part of Gypsy culture,
and these tunes in "Black Cat, White Cat" do not disappoint.</P>
<P>Because "Black Cat, White Cat" features less drama than Kusturica's
other productions, I was expecting to be disappointed. But this film
is a spirit-lifter; one that will entertain you with its farcical
comic sensibility.</P>
<P>In the end, this wild party is a bit long, but I was sad to leave this
world of Gypsies, mobsters and overall quirkiness. "Black Cat, White
Cat" is a fine, joyous work, and a wonderful slice of Gypsy life. But
before you rush out to see it, rent "Time Of The Gypsies", and let me
know what you think.</P>
<P>note: Emir Kusturica won the Silver Lion Award for Best Director at
the 1998 Venice Film Festival.  That award is well deserved.</P>
