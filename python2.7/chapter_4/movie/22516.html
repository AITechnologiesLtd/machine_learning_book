<P>It is hard to imagine that a movie which includes abortion and incest as
prominent plot devices could be so sensitive, so delicate, so insightful
and yes, even so enjoyable.  Somehow, THE CIDER HOUSE RULES manages to
keep an even keel in the face of the harsh subject matter and allows a
substantial amount of heart to shine through.</P>
<P>Set in the 1940's, the film tells the story of a unique young man named
Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire, RIDE WITH THE DEVIL).  An orphan, twice
rejected as an infant by possible adoptive parents, he grows up in the
care and under the tutelage of Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine, LITTLE
VOICE), father figure to the orphans of St. Cloud, obstetrician or
abortionist to the unhappily pregnant women who come there seeking his
help.</P>
<P>Figuring that as long as Homer was going to stay at the orphanage, he
might as well be of use, Dr. Larch begins teaching him all he knows about
obstetrics.  Soon Homer is delivering babies like a professional.  He
refuses to perform abortions, instead wondering why the couples just
didn't behave more responsibly.  Larch, too old and experienced to have
such youthful ideals, marvels that Homer "continues to have such high
expectations of people."</P>
<P>Such is the result of an insulated upbringing.  Though skilled in certain
medical procedures, Homer remains woefully naive and ignorant about most
everything else.  He finally figures that in order to find his place in
the world, he must go out into it.</P>
<P>Befriending a young couple who had come to see Dr. Larch, he hitches a
ride with them and parlays that into landing a job as an apple picker with
a group of black migrant workers at the orchard where they lived. Thus,
Homer begins his worldly instruction, with new friend Candy Kendall
(Charlize Theron, THE ASTRONAUT'S WIFE) a willing tutor.</P>
<P>Tobey Maguire is well cast yet again as an inherently good man who is
seeking answers to life's questions... many of which he was unaware needed
to be asked.  He demonstrates a quiet strength and thoughtful curiosity
that is both warm and appealing.</P>
<P>Michael Caine is, in a word, brilliant as the caring caretaker of these
orphans, many of whom he helped to bring into the world.  Calling them
"princes of Maine, kings of New England" in his ritualistic goodnight, Mr.
Caine manages to communicate the love and commitment Larch has towards
these children without becoming maudlin or saccharine.</P>
<P>Delroy Lindo (A LIFE LESS ORDINARY) has many powerful moments as Mr.
Rose, the strong and charismatic leader of the apple pickers whom Homer
joins.</P>
<P>Director Lasse Hallstrom (WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE?) and
screenwriter/novelist John Irving (THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP), who
adapted his own work for this movie deserve much of the credit for the
balanced approach to the sensitive subject matter.  Regardless of one's
personal stand on the divisive matter of abortion, it is hard to imagine
anyone becoming offended by the evenhanded treatment used by these
filmmakers.</P>
<P>The title is a reference to a list of rules posted in the quarters of the
illiterate apple pickers.  Figuring the rules didn't apply to them since
they didn't have a hand in writing them, they decide to ignore the list
and make up their own rules as they go along.  Dr. Larch, in his own way,
acts similarly.</P>
<P>There is a danger in that line of reasoning.  God has also given us a set
of rules.  Unlike the list posted in the cider house, God's rules, if
followed, promise us benefits beyond our imagination.   And yet, many
continue to ignore His "rules" preferring to make up their own as they go
through life.</P>
<P>"Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own
understanding." Proverbs 3:5 [KJV]</P>
<P>Just as a builder follows a designer's blueprint or a conductor follows a
composer's score, why shouldn't we follow the rules of life given to us by
life's architect for our own blessing?</P>
