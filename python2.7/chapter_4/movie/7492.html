<P>     LEO TOLSTOY'S ANNA KARENINA, Bernard Rose's (IMMORTAL BELOVED) 
attempt to bring the great Russian novel to the screen, is, in its own 
way, as flawed and unsuccessful as its illustrious predecessors.  As an 
unabashed fan of the novel, I have never been impressed by Hollywood's 
tepid attempts to film it.  Even with luminaries like Greta Garbo and 
Vivien Leigh in the title role, the stripped-down story has barely 
resembled its inspiration, looking instead like an overplotted, costume 
melodrama.  ANNA KARENINA is not unfilmable (a 10-part BBC mini-series 
made during the '70s was quite good), but, given the time constraints of 
a theatrical feature, it's next-to-impossible to make an effective 
adaptation.  Rose's brave-but-disappointing attempt reinforces this 
belief.  400,000 words cannot be condensed into two hours.</P>
<P>     The storyline for ANNA KARENINA is widely-known, so I won't spend 
much time recapping it here.  The title character, Anna (Sophie Marceau) 
is a vibrant, young Russian noblewoman trapped in a passionless marriage 
with a much older man, Karenin (James Fox).  She begins a disastrous 
love affair with a dashing army officer, Count Vronsky (Sean Bean).  
Ultimately, the liaison threatens to destroy four lives:  Anna's, 
Karenin's, Vronsky's, and that of Anna's young son.  This story unfolds 
in parallel with the less tragic ordeal of another Russian couple:  
brooding Konstantine Levin (Alfred Molina) and flighty Kitty 
Shcherbatsky (Mia Kirshner).  Levin is desperately in love with Kitty, 
but she is indifferent to his attention, preferring instead to 
concentrate on men like Vronsky.  </P>
<P>     Rose's boldest stroke in this version is to leave in the 
Kitty/Levin subplot, rather than excising it (which is what happens in 
most adaptations).  This decision is two-edged.  While retaining Levin's 
story provides the overall tale with greater balance and depth, it eats 
up valuable time and dilutes the focus.  What works in the book doesn't 
necessarily succeed on screen, and the result is a choppy and uneven 
motion picture.  In fact, everything in ANNA KARENINA races by in a 
blur.  Character development is almost nonexistent as time pressure 
forces Rose to push on without giving the audience an opportunity to 
digest what's happening or get into the protagonists' heads.  There are 
times when ANNA KARENINA seems not like a filmed version of the 
Cliffnotes, but of the abridged Cliffnotes. </P>
<P>     I have several casting quibbles, as well.  French actress Sophie 
Marceau (BRAVEHEART) is a cool, regal beauty -- not the right type at 
all to play the hot-blooded, passionate Anna.  Marceau is a good 
actress, but she's wrong for this role, and her icy rendering of Anna 
leaves viewers largely unconcerned about the fate of the character.  
Likewise, Mia Kirshner (EXOTICA) as Kitty and Alfred Molina (THE PEREZ 
FAMILY) as Levin are miscast.  Kirshner's North American accent is out-
of-place, and Molina never properly captures Levin's deep-rooted 
melancholy.  Sean Bean (GOLDENEYE) fares somewhat better as Vronsky, 
although there are times when his performance is on the stiff side.  The 
only truly successful job is turned in by James Fox (THE REMAINS OF THE 
DAY), who essays a sympathetic and entirely human Karenin.</P>
<P>     Despite the problems with story, characterization, and acting, ANNA 
KARENINA is far from a complete bust.  Visually, it's nothing less than 
stunning (with outside locations filmed in Russia) -- the most eye-
catching motion picture since Kenneth Branagh's HAMLET.  Ballroom 
interiors, landscapes, and even close-ups of faces leave the viewer 
entranced.  At one point during the movie, when Karenin remarks, 
"There's so much splendor here.  One's eyes are bedazzled," he might 
have been talking about the look of the film.  The soundtrack, which 
features the work of Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff, and Prokofiev, is 
equally arresting.  </P>
<P>     Had the script for ANNA KARENINA matched the production values, 
this movie would have been a rousing success, but that's not the case.  
Once, near the very end, as a broken Vronsky reflects on what has 
transpired, the movie finally allows us to feel for a character, but, as 
the saying goes, it's too little, too late.  LEO TOLSTOY'S ANNA KARENINA 
has its good points, but there's nothing here to warrant such an 
extravagant remake.  For anyone who really wants to enjoy the story, 
with its rich characters, stimulating ideas, and wrenching tragedy, a 
copy of the paperback book should cost about as much as a movie ticket, 
and will provide a more lasting and worthwhile investment.</P>
