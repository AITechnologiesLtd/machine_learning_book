<PRE>                              JAYA GANGA
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     "Some write with words, others with silence," reflects the
mysterious woman by the river Ganga (Ganges).  (The movie JAYA GANGA is
like that.  It speaks as much with its silence as its words.)  The
woman is dressed in flowing golden robes and is the first of many
enigmas in the mystical tale called JAYA GANGA.  Her name is Zehra, and
she is beautifully acted with just the right touch of playfulness by
Smriti Mishra.</P>
<P>     JAYA GANGA is written, directed and produced by Vijay Singh, who
is the author of the book by the same name.  "Ganga has become a
strange obsession in me," he says in the press kit.  "I do not know the
hows and whys of it.  All I know is that Ganga is a beautiful woman
inhabiting my mind."  His movie is his way to pay homage to the river
he loves.  He calls it his "Ganga-fixation."</P>
<P>     Movies that work by the magical spell they weave on the viewer are
difficult to give justice to in a review.  I will try, but this is a
movie that must be seen to be appreciated and understood.</P>
<P>     This romantic road picture takes place along the Ganga.  The
central character, Nishant, is an Indian writer living in Paris.  He is
played by Asil Rais as a serene man who, nevertheless, is driven to
make his pilgrimage.  Nishant journeys to the Ganga and takes an
adventure along it from its source to the sea -- traveling by bus, boat
and foot.  Much of the story is based on a mystery that I will not
reveal so that you can fully savor it yourself.</P>
<P>     As he travels, his mind will venture back to almost surrealistic
images from his Parisian life.  Eventually, he will find Zehra, and his
life will be forever changed.  Surprisingly, she comes from a brothel,
and he will have to bribe her way out.</P>
<P>     There are just enough contrasting vignettes of poverty and
corruption to force the viewer to realize that the picture is to be
taken seriously and not just as a fantasy.  Typical of these is the
rural post office where the only worker has sold the measuring weights
so he cannot take letters until the person wishing to mail them can
find some other place to get them weighed.  Even then, the postal clerk
is too busy to be bothered since he is engrossed in listening on his
cheap radio to a soccer match.</P>
<P>     The star of the show is not one of the two nominal leads, but the
river itself.  The cinematography by Piyush Shah is incredibly
beautiful.  One ceremony shows them sending lit vessels down the Ganga
at night, and Shah films it reverentially with all of the awe the scene
is due.  In contrast, the daytime sequences of the river, as it cuts
deep gorges into the snow capped mountains, look like a travelogue for
a four star wilderness adventure.  The pictures of the temples along
the way are golden hued paeans to India.</P>
<P>     The romance between Zehra and Nishant is believable but is
secondary to Nishant's quest and his obsession with the Ganga.  A
lovely little picture to be savored, not analyzed.</P>
<P>     JAYA GANGA runs 1:34.  It is in Hindi and French with English
subtitles.  The movie is not rated, but would probably be PG-13.  There
is a brief scene of sex in the distance that can barely be seen through
a curtain.  There is no profanity, nudity, or violence.  I recommend
the film to you and give it ** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
