<PRE>TOMB RAIDER
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 2001 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>no stars (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        Tomb Raider.  Fun?  Exciting?  Challenging?  Given the unprecedented
popularity (especially among teenage boys) of the video game that sports an
uber-buff, pistol packin' babe who raids, well... tombs, you have to
believe it's these three things and more!</P>
<P>        "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider," the big screen variant of said video game,
which features a pumped-up Angelina Jolie (the Oscar® winner for "Girl,
Interrupted" no less) in the title role is, however, none of these things.
It isn't fun, it isn't exciting, and the only challenge is seeing how long
you can stay in your seat (I suffered through to the bitter, bitter end;
the wife opted for Barnes & Noble at the 45-minute mark).</P>
<P>        Directed by Simon West with the same subtlety he brought to "Con Air,"
"Tomb Raider" is an empty-headed, big budget bore.  The story borrows
unintelligently from that mother of all turkeys "Hudson Hawk" (the same
hokum about planetary alignments and sacred stones that, when brought
together, well... who the heck cares?) and it makes "Super Mario Bros."
(Bob Hoskins' ill-advised career move) look like "Rocco and his Brothers"
(that classic of Italian neo-realism).</P>
<P>        I'll go out on a limb here and say I suspect there's actually more
character development in the video game than the movie proper.</P>
<P>        This is where the Jolie defenders/video game nuts jump in and say this
movie isn't about character development it's about kicking serious butt (or
bum, since Ms. Croft hails from England's green and pleasant).  With lips,
breasts, and biceps all inflated to the max, Lara Croft is all about
posturing, and Jolie has a hard time simply standing still without trying
to look tough.</P>
<P>        OK, let's forget challenging.  Shouldn't "Tomb Raider" be, at the very
least, fun and exciting?  Shouldn't our butt-kicking heroine also encompass
the sophistication of, say, James Bond with the wit of Indiana Jones?
There's no humor to be found anywhere in "Tomb Raider," even though it
tries hard from time to time.  Even "The Mummy Returns" didn't take itself
too seriously.  The villain here is noticeably lacking, the special effects
are ridiculously overblown and unnecessarily complicated, and the script is
non-existent.</P>
<P>        To liven things up (perhaps), Jolie's live father Jon Voight puts in a few
minutes as Lara's dead father Lord Croft; talk about a stretch.  One thing
I hadn't expected from the film is that Jolie affects a slightly better
English accent than her Pa (although I suspect that thin-looking moustache
he's forced to wear gets in the way some).</P>
<P>        Unsuccessful?  Not entirely.  If anything, "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider" makes
you want to check out the video game itself to figure out exactly what all
the fuss was about.</P>
