SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by E. Elias Merhige</PRE>
<PRE>De Vargas    R   90 min</PRE>
<P>     In his twilight years, sitting around the old actors' home, Willem 
Dafoe is not going to have to complain "I never got to really go over 
the top."  As Max Schreck, the ghoulish actor who created the 
unforgettable vampire in  F.W. Murnau's silent classic Nosferatu (1922), 
Dafoe pulls out all the stops, and he does it with a cackling, 
irresistible glee that goes straight for the jugular. </P>
<P>     Shadow of the Vampire is writer Steven Katz and director E. Elias 
Merhige's riff on the making of Nosferatu, the first vampire movie and 
still the creepiest.  You get a bit of a history lesson with the price 
of admission; up to a point the movie draws on the facts of that 
landmark production.  Murnau was denied permission to adapt Bram 
Stoker's Dracula by the author's widow, a problem he solved by changing 
the title and rechristening his vampire Count Orlok.  Murnau also 
revolutionized movie-making by taking his camera out of the studio and 
going on location.  The names of the cast and crew are faithfully 
observed, as is the look of the period, down to the actors' makeup and 
the dusters and goggles worn by Murnau and his henchmen.</P>
<P>    And then there's Schreck, and here the filmmakers let the dogs of 
their imaginations run free.  Murnau's background was with the great Max 
Reinhardt's Berlin Staatstheater, and so was Schreck's, as far as we 
know.  In Shadow, Murnau (John Malkovich) tells his company that the 
actor he has hired to play Count Orlok is from Reinhardt's theater, but 
this guy is from Berlin the way the Coneheads were from France.  He's a 
disciple of Stanislavsky, Murnau says to explain why the actor is not 
around for the studio scenes; Schreck has traveled ahead to the Czech 
location to steep himself in the atmosphere, and he will only be seen in 
makeup and character.  (The name Schreck translates as "fear" or 
"horror".) </P>
<P>     There's some self-consciousness to the exposition in the early 
scenes, which often happens when the filmmakers have a menu of 
information to serve.  But there are also generous helpings of clever 
writing and some marvelously atmospheric visual schemes, with the good 
easily outweighing the awkward.  There is also sound philosophy.  When 
the producer complains that the locals who will fill the background 
roles don't know how to act, Murnau replies "They don't need to act; 
they need to be."  And "We are scientists engaged in the creation of 
memory, but our memories will neither blur nor fade" is an observation 
that carries a twist of pathos now that so many early films have 
deteriorated beyond repair. </P>
<P>      Shadow is more delicious fun than classic horror.  It's an 
allegory of the filmmaking process, but it doesn't let anything so 
abstract get in the way of its entertainment.  Merhige and Katz seize 
hold of their idea and drive it with clear-eyed relish from start to 
finish.   </P>
