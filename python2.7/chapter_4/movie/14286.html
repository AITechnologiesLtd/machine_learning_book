<P>    The second movie to come out this month which uses the
game of poker as a metaphor for con games, "Hit Me"
features a performer who possesses anything but a poker
face.  His expressions and body language reflect his feelings
so robustly that if he indulged in the game he'd be wiped out
in four hands.  What is so obviously a handicap in cards is no
hindrance to the story.  In a hotel bellhop's role, Elias
Koteas's portrayal of the hapless Sonny may be stagey but is
appropriate, even invaluable, for realizing director Steven
Shainberg's intention.  Shainberg, in his debut as a director,
wants to portray nothing less than the turbulent emotions of
every American worker who is frustrated by the confines of
dead-end job.  For both humorous effect and unsubtle
sketching of inner anger, he exploits the talents of Mr. Koteas,
known hitherto to a discerning audience for his work in Atom
Egoyan's movie "Exotica" and to less perspicacious fans who
enjoyed his farcical machinations in Steve Barron's murky
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles."  In "Hit Me," Mr. Koteas
effectively combines the poignancy of a man ready to grasp at
any straw to make a better life and the whimsy of a
Chaplinesque character caught up in the modern-times
scheme that's way over his limits.</P>
<P>   Scripter Denis Johnson's comic drama of romance and
double-dealing takes us inside a decently-appointed by fraying
Tacoma, Washington hotel which has just been demoted to a
two-star establishment.  Bellhop Sonny (Koteas) may look to
any patron the typical uniformed servant who wheels the
room-service cart robot-like on his appointed rounds.  We in
the movie audienc know better.  The guests may see him only
as he politely delivers the goods but we watch outside the
door, as he gesticulates wildly to no one in particular in
emulation of the activities inside one room, screwing up his
face in disgust and mouthing curses at his exploitative
employer at the next station.  On one of his rounds, he is
plunged into an adventure which he intially greets with mixed
delight, but one which will immerse him even further into the
despair of a man who sees his home life as even more
discouraging than his job: Sonny takes care of a mentally
retarded, 450-pound brother Leroy (Jay Leggett).  When an
attractive hotel guest, Monique (Laure Marsac), slashes her
wrists while Sonny is still in her room, he saves her life.  But
seemingly betrayed by the Montreal-born woman of his
dreams soon thereafter, he agrees to take part with his friend
Del (Bruce Ramsay) in a bold theft of $500,000 left by some
big-league poker players in the hotel safes.</P>
<P>   Director Shainberg shifts his focus regularly from hotel to
hovel, effectively portraying the despair that has allowed
Sonny to risk all in a reckless plan which would allow him to
reinvent his life.  What Sonny did not count on was the way
the best-laid plans are often trumped by life and how
unprepared he is in his confrontations with Lenny Ish (Philip
Baker Hall), a high-roller in the approaching card game with a
decidedly philosophic approach to life.  Hall, who is
traditionally cast in the role of mentor to callow young men
who are down on their luck, is both amusing and convincing
as a cool hoodlum whose ruthlessness belies his composed
attitude. He who cunningly portrays a man whose
conservative beliefs conform to the view that social classes
are rigid.  As a fellow who is so comfortable with himself that
even his bleakest pronouncements come out as avuncular
advice, he embodies the cynical view that most people are
vain dreamers, bound to stay forever in their current social
and economic levels.  </P>
<P>   In its noir cynicism, "Hit Me" is the diametrical opposite of
saccharine films like "Simon Birch."  Shainberg and Johnson's
God does not endow humble people with the competence to
save the world.  His unassuming people will continue as meek
individuals while audacious human beings will proceed to
exploit the long-suffering.  In his bellhop's embodiment, Elias
Koteas gets the message: accept the world and embrace
whatever beauty you can in your own echelon.  "Hit Me"
delivers mounting tension, combining action scenes with
trenchant episodes, adding up to captivating cinema.</P>
