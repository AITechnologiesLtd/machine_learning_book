<P>     It seems that in a period detective story, it's a prerequisite for
the the main character to narrate the proceedings.  In DEVIL IN A BLUE
DRESS, writer/director Carl Franklin apparently intended this conceit
as a tribute to the Dashiell Hammett/Raymond Chandler school of
cinematic potboilers.  Denzel Washington's running commentary is
peppered with genre-specific cliches, and this voiceover aids
atmosphere-building as much as story advancement.</P>
<P>     Yet beneath all the trappings--a sultry woman in blue, dead
bodies, smoky back rooms, shoot-outs, and blackmail--DEVIL IN A BLUE
DRESS addresses the kind of subject matter that most crime thrillers,
in their quest for pure (often prurient) entertainment, avoid.  Easy
Rawlins (Washington), the lead character, is black, and this is 1948
Los Angeles, where segregation and racism are the accepted way of
life.  As the film progresses, it becomes evident that skin color is
more than a background issue--it's the first thing anyone notices, and
can break careers, shatter marriages, and end lives.</P>
<P>     Easy's not a typical private investigator--he's a bit naive and
doesn't own a gun.  He's not a detective by trade, but he's out of work
and has a mortgage to pay (he's one of the few property-owning blacks
in this time and place), so when a man of dubious connections named
DeWitt Albright (Tom Sizemore) offers him $100 to locate Daphne Monet
(Jennifer Beals), Easy agrees.  He doesn't realize what he's gotten
himself into.  Daphne is the girlfriend of the richest man in LA (Terry
Kinney), and there are a lot of people--including one talented
knife-wielding gangster--looking for her.  In a short time, Easy has
become implicated in two murders, has been offered money by just about
everyone involved, and has become a key player in a political contest
where the path to victory is paved with dirty tricks and smoking guns.</P>
<P>     If the resolution of DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS is a little flat, the
lack of startling revelations or unexpected twists can be forgiven
considering the material's depth.  Capable of being viewed on more than
one level, this picture has narrative texture.  While DEVIL IN A BLUE
DRESS never develops the taut momentum of Franklin's previous effort,
ONE FALSE MOVE, it maintains audience involvement, especially after the
first, somewhat slow, half-hour.  And, to keep the noir elements from
becoming too pervasive, the movie is sprinkled with humor.</P>
<P>     After portraying a one-dimensional action hero in VIRTUOSITY,
Denzel Washington is back to a character with some versatility.  Easy
isn't much of an acting challenge, but Washington's mix of charm and
intensity creates an appealing personae.  Vulnerable and mysterious,
Jennifer Beals (still best known for FLASHDANCE) is effective in the
unlikely role of a femme fatale.  The supporting performances,
including a brilliant turn by Don Cheadle as Easy's violent friend, are
strong.</P>
<P>     The most interesting element of DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS is not the
whodunit, but the "whydunit."  Finding the guilty parties isn't as
involving as learning their motivation, which is buried in society's
perception of racial interaction.  By uncovering the truth behind this
mystery, Franklin illustrates that some attitudes have indeed changed
for the better over the last forty years.</P>
