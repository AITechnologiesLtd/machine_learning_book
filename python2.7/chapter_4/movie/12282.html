Danish with  subtitles. No rating.</P>
<P>The third feature by Bille August (b.1948) is a very good  work on young
people in suburban  1964 Denmark . I'm resisting labeling their particular
stages of growth as "coming-of-age," since the male protagonists  are
beyond that stage, and the female leads have already achieved their own
relative maturity.</P>
<P>Twist And Shout starts out at the end of 1963 but  is mostly set in 1964.
At first it makes you think that  it will be a straight teen -age romance
with , as background, the early stages of  Denmark 's  Beatlemania. The
kids literally twist and shout to the Liverpudlians' pieces, form their own
groups, even adopt Beatles garb. Middle-class  adolescents Bjorn (Tonsberg)
and Erik (Simonsen) are best friends . Both are perfectly nice, normal
boys. Bjorn is an extremely good-looking, vivacious extrovert who attracts
girls. Erik is a homely, shy introvert, for good reason. In  Gothic- novel
fashion,  he has a dark secret -- a deranged mother who for years has been
kept under wraps, lock and key at home following the strict  orders from
Erik's dour, overbearing father, who also  browbeats his son into a joyless
life.</P>
<P>Blonde, wealthy Kirsten thinks that there is an understanding between her
and Bjorn. So does Eric, who though smitten with Kirsten is too decent and
timid to do anything about it . When  Bjorn falls in love with  a new girl,
Anna (Soeberg), a peeved Kirsten pretends a momentary interest in Eric,
only to penetrate his secret . Later she heaps derision on him at a party
she's giving, throws out Bjorn and Anna.</P>
<P>For those two, head over heels in love, it is a happy time, until Anna has
a horrid backroom abortion, paid for  in part by money that Bjorn,
swallowing his pride, borrowed from Kirsten. The mental and physical  pain
jolts Anna to  break with Bjorn .Though still very much in love, Bjorn, for
whom Anna had been an ideal and a leader,  accepts his fate dumbly, more
like a boy than like a man. Kirsten gets him  back on the rebound, and with
sales pitches from her family, a listless, unconvinced Bjorn becomes
engaged to her...</P>
<P>The movie has a two-part structure. Its first half deals primarily with
Bjorn and Anna. It is sunny, even though Erik's family problems lurk behind
it. What the lovers do is gay, amusing, and not always like the first-love
cliches of their American counterparts. They sit in adult cafes and drink
tea; Anna tries to initiate rocker Bjorn into the beauty of  the music of
Bach, an unknown name that the boy can't  even pronounce correctly. When
Anna goes on a short trip, Bjorn worries and has visions of his girl doing
a lascivious strip-tease. With the abortion though,  the tone becomes
somber, and along with Bjorn's confusion, Erik's own comes more and more to
the forefront. His life as a dog culminates with the boy discovering , in
morally ambiguous conditions, the real nature of his father, and rebelling.</P>
<P>The choice of actors and their performances are excellent.  (Lars Simonsen
(Erik) was voted Best Actor at the Moscow Film Festival.) They also help to
fill gaps in the story and to camouflage improbabilities. Handsome Bjorn's
looks   are like a cross between the angelic Tadzio in Death In Venice and
Jacques Perrin in  Girl With A Suitcase --if your memory goes that far
back. Anna  is most appealing in behavior and physique. The actress playing
her is only 20, but Bjorn looks so much  younger that Anna would be more
convincingly paired off with a more mature man. Kirsten looks like a young,
prim  and calculating Eva Marie Saint. She is so different from Bjorn that
you may wonder what hold she has on him. The explanation, I believe, is
that  the actors playing Bjorn and Kirsten  were also in Bille August's
preceding movie. Zappa, set in 1961, was indeed a coming-of-age film, in
which Kirsten was already Bjorn's girlfriend, with plans for their future.</P>
<P>Both films were co-authored by Bjarne Reuter, a specialist in novels about
adolescents. He must be the S.E. Hinton of Denmark. The scriptwriters may
be assuming in Twist And Shout some  familiarity with the earlier movie,
but even beyond this, they are a bit murky about what's going on. The
explanations for the father's   incarceration of his wife, his refusal to
see a doctor or to place her in an institution, are feeble. (There are
perhaps vague intimations of films like Gaslight, where a husband tries to
drive his wife insane.)  The father explaining to his son that mother has
suffered from post-partum depression which became agoraphobia (fear of
crowds) after she gave birth to the boy, is an improbable "revelation,"  to
say the least. The lady must be close to 50, the boy is not  retarded, yet
he's lived all his life dumbly accepting matters and with no knowledge of
the facts?  There are other murky areas, such as Anna's  family  background
and her sexual past: she initiates sex with Bjorn in a way that hints at
previous experience, but she is dumbfounded when she finds out she is
pregnant.</P>
<P>What  papers over many of the film's cracks, in addition to the appeal of
its young actors,  is its technical skill and above all, the fact that this
is a guilt-edged movie. In Zappa, the responsibility for the kids' troubles
was laid squarely at their parents' doorstep. In the new film too, with
additional types of guilt. Erik's father is guilty of harshness and
puritanical hypocrisy. He makes his son feel guilty for practically
everything, especially his being embarrassed by a mother whom
nonetheless, he cares for lovingly when father isn't looking.  Bjorn feels
guilty vis-a-vis Anna, which explains in part his acceptance of her
decision to break. Anna's mother, to whom the girl appeals for help, is
monstrously guilty of indifference. The guilt may extend to Anna's unseen,
absentee (and illegitimate?) father. Kirsten's parents are guilty of having
spoiled their daughter. And so on...</P>
<P>Gaps and incongruities notwithstanding, this is a fine film. Most of it
makes suspension of disbelief fairly easy, so that you can concentrate on
the more valid parts of the joys and sorrows of adolescence. It is  helped
too by a good soundtrack, both of  pleasant period pop and of classical
music that you would never find in an American teen-age movie.  A
comparison with  some parts of the current  Dirty Dancing, set in 1963,
with its own youth,  rock-and-roll, ballroom dancing, abortion, and
parents-children  relations,  can tell you much about differences and
similarities between Danish and American attitudes and moviemaking.</P>
