<PRE>"Pay It Forward" Noble in Thought but Not in Deed
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>In "Pay It Forward" (based on Catherine Ryan Hyde's
recent book), a melodrama brimming with cynicism, we
see that bad things happen to good people.  What's
worse, the more good you do, the more you'll get
punished for it.  </P>
<P>Victimized most by this odd paradox is 7th grader
Trevor (Haley Joel Osment).  He performs these
magnanimous acts of kindness because his erudite
Social Studies teacher, Mr. Simonet (Kevin Spacey),
has challenged the classroom with an extra credit
assignment: "come up with an idea to change our world
and put it into action."  The unusually benevolent
Trevor comes up with a pyramid-like scheme of
'pay-it-forward' where he'll perform an act of
kindness for three strangers, and they, in turn, must
do the same.  But in a cynical world where strangers
are more likely to be considered enemies rather than
friends, charity is looked upon with suspicion.  Even
worse, kindness may yield cruel consequences. </P>
<P>Appropriately set in Las Vegas, where losers outnumber
winners 20-to-1.  "Pay It Forward" makes it clear that
the world is full of problems, from wife battering to
drug addiction to a wanton need for violence.  Yet,
amid this chaos, there are glimmers of hope that shine
through.  This beacon of optimism centers on Trevor
and his 'pay it forward' idea.  For example, he
invites a homeless man (James Caviezel) to come over
and sleep in the garage.  He also hopes to save his
friend from a brutal beating by a group of bullies. 
Each provides a valuable lesson, challenging us to
overcome our suspicion towards others and to risk
leaving our comfort zone.</P>
<P>Trevor also tries to make a love match for his mom
(Helen Hunt) and Mr. Simonet.  Most of the film
centers on this plot component.  His mom is an
irresponsible parent who frequently drinks herself to
sleep after pulling double-shifts as a waitress at a
strip club.  Meanwhile, Mr. Simonet suffers from a
scarred psyche that confines him to the prosaic life
he now leads.  The two are given a chance to explore
their pasts, their hopes, and to come to terms with
their personal struggles.  But their story seems
familiar and only partially engaging.  Of course, it's
a pleasure to watch Hunt and Spacey perform.  She
gives a gritty and strong performance as the alcoholic
mom.  Spacey is adept at portraying the vulnerable and
wounded man.  And Osment shows us that his
Oscar-nominated turn in the "Sixth Sense" was no
fluke.  </P>
<P>But their performances could not hide the film's
shortcomings.  It's stylistically bland and the
screenplay is weak.  The story lingers much too long
on the Mom/Mr. Simonet element, creating an odd sense
of imbalance.  With so much of the film focused on
this, its original premise becomes supplanted by a
love story.   It also teases the audience with an idea
that it wants to like, but then gets mired in a tone
that's continually dispirited and even weepy.  The
message contained within is that the world is a ball
of blighted hope.  For Trevor, a mere 12-year old, a
small beacon can get easily snuffed out when there is
so much to filter through.   Consequently, the film
tempers its feel-good tone with rejection, sorrow, and
defeat.  The ending is shamelessly treacly, and
whether you'll accept that payoff depends on your
tolerance for "Patch Adams."  Ultimately, this film
presents noble thoughts, but doesn't fulfill its
promise.</P>
