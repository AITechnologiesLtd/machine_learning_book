<PRE>`Tarzan' – Lord of the Animated Jungle
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>After watching Disney's latest animated offering, there were a couple
of points that stayed with me from the moment that I left the theatre
up until now as I sit in front of my computer.  The most striking was
the terrific animation and level of detail that we've come to expect
from Disney animators.  The beautiful waterfalls and the indigenous
wildlife of the lush African forest are vividly brought to life.  And
there are three notable scenes that highlight the level of detail at
work.  The first features Kala (voiced by Glenn Close), a mother
Gorilla who saves young baby Tarzan from the jaws of a hungry leopard. 
Another involves a battle between a now-grown-up Tarzan versus the
leopard that almost killed him as a child.  And another scene features
Tarzan saving a prim, young, lass named Jane (voiced by Minnie Driver)
from a pack of hungry beasts.  He swings from vine to vine and slides
up and down an array of branches with the same look and feel of an
Olympic bobsled run.  This is nothing less than impressive.</P>
<P>`Tarzan' is about an orphaned baby that is raised in the wilds by
gorillas.  Kala cares for and adores him like her own son, but her mate
and leader of the gorilla pack, Kerchack (voiced by Lance Hericksen)
doesn't accept him.  He's different from the others, and as the ugly
duckling, Tarzan has to convince the protective Kerchack and even his
own gorilla play pals that he does belong among his simian siblings.  
Yet as Tarzan grows older, he does notice innate differences between
himself and his mother.  He becomes further confused after meeting
Jane, the first human that he encounters.  He sees that he has
physiologically more in common with Jane than he does with his gorilla
family.  Questions of self-identity and measures of self-worth are
brought forth, and now Tarzan wonders what his true calling is.  Trying
to sort out his loyalties and learning more about himself are
‘family-values' elements at which Disney storytelling excels.  Kids can
relate easily to this situation.  And I think that most kids will also
enjoy the clumsy antics of Tarzan's elephant friend, Tantor  (voiced by
Wayne Knight) and the sardonic wit of Terk (voiced by Rosie O'
Donnell). </P>
<P>But the film has a definite feeling of maturity to it.  Another
subplot, although less intriguing, involved Jane's fellow travelers. 
One of them is her father (voiced by Nigel Hawthorne) who is on a
scientific trip to study the gorillas.  The other traveler is Clayton,
He purports to be their bodyguard, but he secretly wants to find these
gorillas and to capture them for a pretty penny.  This rogue is as oily
as they come.   He senses Tarzan's attraction to Jane and exploits his
feelings in order to gain knowledge of the gorillas' secret nesting
area.  Boo!  Hiss!</P>
<P>I have grown used to Disney films as being feel-good adventures filled
with humor, song, and color.  And maybe that's why Little Mermaid still
ranks as my favorite among all of the Disney animated films.  This film
(and I think recent Disney animated features in general) has purposely
tried to be more adult-oriented.  For example, many songs in the film
are created by contemporary popmeister Phil Collins, while the colors
of the film are noticeably paler than Aladdin or Beauty and the Beast
or even Pocahontas.  Tarzan is surprisingly weighty and Disney films
are definitely maturing.  But my mind is still humming `Under the Sea.'</P>
