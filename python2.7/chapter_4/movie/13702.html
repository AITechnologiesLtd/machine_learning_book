<P>   At first sight you'd hardly guess that Shohei Imamura, who
directs "The Eel," was also at the helm of "Black Rain." 
"Black Rain," a quietly moving story, deals with the effects of
the Hiroshima bombing on one Japanese family over a period
of five years.  Ultimately, though, you realize that "The Eel"
follows a similar trajectory.  Like its predecessor, it is quiet,
slow moving, and involves bloodshed and redemption.  Unlike
the black-and-white forerunner, though, "The Eel" is filmed in
vivid color, an unsullied view of the Japanese countryside.  It
is warm and dignified, its symbolism never overshadowing the
telling of a simple story of a man who commits an awful
crime, climbs into his own shell for years, and is brought to
life by the love and loyalty of a woman.</P>
<P>   "The Eel," which won the Palme D'or prize when it
appeared at the Cannes Film Festival in 1997, is based on
Akira Yoshimura's novel "Glimmering in the Dark."  The story
begins in 1988, centering on office worker Takuro Yamashita
(Koji Yakusho) who one day receives an anonymous letter
accusing his pretty wife of committing adultery during
Yamashita's frequent absences from his well-appointed
suburban home.  Yamashita deliberately cuts a nightly fishing
excursion short to return to his residence, where he catches
his wife in the middle of a sexual act with a young stranger. 
He stabs her brutally and, in his blood-soaked fishing outfit,
he turns himself in at the local police station.</P>
<P>   We see only a moment's glimpse of the man--on the last
day of his eight years' incarceration--but are informed that
during his stretch he talked to no one except his pet eel, a
sea creature who "listens to what I say" and "never tells me
what I don't want to hear."  Attached to a probation officer
who is a priest, he is warned to stay out of trouble.  He opens
a barber shop, business picking up only after he has rescued
a suicidal woman, Keiko Hattori (Misa Shimizu), on the brink
of death who then joins him as an associate in the business.  </P>
<P>   Shohei Imamura, who directs "The Eel" ("Unagi" in
Japanese), does not claustrophobically limit his camera to the
man and his lovely new partner, but frequently cuts to an
assortment of oddballs who inhabit the scene. Chief among
the curious characters he depicts is a trash collecter, once in
prison with Yamashita and now envious of his success, often
drunk on sake, who reveals the man's past to his associate. 
He introduces us to Keiko's nutty mother, who is prone to
break into flamenco at the earliest strum of a guitar
(uncharacteristic for Japanese culture) and to a gangster who
claims the money which really belongs to the demented
woman.  Yet another peculiar personality is a man who tries
to attract UFOs to the town by drawing first a Star of David on
the grounds outside the shop, later incorporating the barber
pole and an elaborate piece of machinery to attract the aliens.</P>
<P>   While "The Eel" won one of Cannes' most prestigous
awards last year and is effectively emotional, quiet, and
leisurely paced, it is prominent more for its competence than
for any leap to artistic heights.  At best Imamura unfolds the
story behind the redemption of a man whose prison term
seems unusually light considering the brutality of his crime
and who has been granted an envious relationship with a
Buddhist priest. It also portrays a Japan which is not like the
Utopia which Thomas Moore once outlined and which is
prominently featured in the Cinderella movie "Ever After." 
Japan is apparently a place which, like the U.S., has a fair
share of oddballs, criminals, love-starved and guilt-ridden
people.  Perhaps no one can evoke this palette as well as the
wonderful performer Koji Yakusho, whose astonishingly
popular "Shall We Dance?" is more enjoyable and--for all its
lightness-more emblematic of the conflicts underlying today's
Japan.</P>
