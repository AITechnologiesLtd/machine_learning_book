<PRE>DOUBLE INDEMNITY (Paramount)
Directed by Billy Wilder</PRE>
<P>         In the dazzling "Double Indemnity," Fred MacMurray's Walter
Neff is the kind of velvet-tongued cynic who used to be described as
"hard-boiled": He's a top-flight insurance salesman who makes the
mistake of calling on Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck), whose
ice-colored hair hints at the cold blood in her veins. Pretending to be
concerned about her oilman husband (Tom Powers), Phyllis enlists
Walter's help in getting an accidental death policy on him, and a few
meetings later, Walter is eagerly helping Phyllis come up with an
air-tight plan to kill off her spouse and collect on the policy's double
indemnity clause, the extra money to be paid if he dies under
extraordinary circumstances, such as falling from a moving train.</P>
<P> What Walter doesn't count on is the brilliant mind of boss
Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson), a claims manager who also happens to
have world-class deductive powers. By the time Phyllis confesses to
Walter she's "rotten to the heart," he's already in far over his head,
both with her and with Phyllis' lovesick stepdaughter Lola (Jean
Heather).</P>
<P> For the generation that grew up thinking of MacMurray as the
kindly father-figure on "My Three Sons" and Stanwyck as the regal
matriarch of "The Big Valley," it's a jolt to see them playing such
devious, money-hungry types. But though Stanwyck and MacMurray (try
counting how many times he calls Phyllis "babe") both shine under Billy
Wilder's crackling direction, "Indemnity" is stolen by the fast-talking
Robinson, who turns what could have been a colorless supporting role
into a showcase. Though largely dark and foreboding in the classic
film-noir style, "Indemnity" does provide a few giggles when seen today
-- imagine a time when drive-ins served beer, secretaries didn't mind
being called "sweetheart" by their bosses and people were free to smoke
while perusing the aisles of the local Piggly Wiggly. James Sanford</P>
