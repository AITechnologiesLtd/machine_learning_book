<PRE>Cop Land (15)</PRE>
<PRE>        Starring Slyvestor Stallone, Ray Liotta, Harvey Kietal
and Robert De Niro
A Miramax picture</PRE>
<P>Stallone attempts to 'act' in this cop drama. The film is set
in a neighbourhood pratically built by Kietal, who's
nephew (played by Michael Rappaport) is involved in a car
crash and killing of two black youths. Keital dosen't really
want to get involved in anything, gets rid of Rappaport,
and Stallone and De Niro try to work out what the hell is going on. 
This film should be brilliant. It sounds like a great plot, the
actors are first grade, and the supporting cast is good
aswell, and Stallone is attempting to deliver a good
performance. However, it can't hold up. Although the
acting is fantastic (even Stallone isn't bad) the directing and
story is dull and long winded </P>
<P>Some scenes go on for too long, with nothing really
happening in them. In fact, the only scenes that do work
are action scenes, which I suspect Stallone was trying to
avoid. In this film, serious means dull. The dialogue is
warbling, and basically just repeats the same points over
and over, no matter who is delivering them. The plot,
which has potential, is wasted, again just being cliched
after a while. In fact, the only thing that does keep the film
going is Kietal and De Niro, both delivering their usual
good performances. However, Stallone, although not given
much to say, gives a good performance. 
However, it's not all that bad. As said above, the action
scenes are well done. Theres also a very good ending,
which uses the cinemas sound system well. In fact, the last
10 minutes of this 2 hour film are one of the best endings
of 1997. If only the rest of the film was as good as the
ending. </P>
<P>Cop Land, then, turns out not to be a power house film,
but a rather dull, and not every exciting film. Hugely
disappointing, and I can't really recommend it. </P>
<PRE>Overall Rating=** out of *****   </PRE>
