<P>     In 1954 Queens, New York, three brothers - Mac (John Tuturro),
Vico (Michael Badalucco), and Bruno (Carl Capotorto) - after having a
few bad experiences working for others, decide to band together and
create their own construction business.  The building of four houses is
a painstaking process that pushes the relationships of the close
brothers to the breaking point.</P>
<P>     Credit should go to John Tuturro for exploring a subject -
carpentry and house building - that is not often seen in films.  Not
only does MAC tackle this issue, but manages to make it vital and
interesting.  The best parts of the film are those that show the
various stages of starting a new business and building the houses.  If
only the interpersonal relationships between the brothers had been
handled as deftly and with as much feeling.</P>
<P>     There is no doubt whatsoever that MAC was a labor of love for
Tuturro.  The film took twelve years to reach its final form, and
Tuturro was involved every step of the way.  MAC is dedicated to and
loosely based on the life of Turturro's father, a first generation
Italian American carpenter.  The writer/director/actor has put his
heart and energy into this movie and, while the product is flawed,
there is still enough here to make viewing of this film worthwhile.</P>
<P>     MAC is a visual feast.  Rich images abound and great care is paid
to detail.  The opening credits are especially impressive - as well as
indicative of the quality of the rest of the film - as booted feet
stalk through mud and concrete is smoothed over.  Throughout the entire
film, this flair is never lost.</P>
<P>     At times, Tuturro handles the relationships between the three
brothers well, but not always.  Too often, he goes for melodrama and
directs with a heavy hand.  It doesn't take the audience long to
understand the tensions coursing under the surface, but Tuturro insists
on hammering the point home over and over again.  He does it so often
that, in addition to being repetitious, the entire subject becomes
tedious and uncomfortable.</P>
<P>     Perhaps I would have felt differently had I gotten the impression
of real affection between the brothers.  However, although it's
apparent that the Vitellis are a close-knit family, there are few - if
any - demonstrations of brotherly affection.  My problems with the
disintegration of the relation- ship are partially grounded in an
inability to completely accept what Tuturro takes for granted.</P>
<P>     Tuturro's acting is inspired.  He goes over-the-top on a couple of
occasions, but he infuses this film with an energy that it's badly in
need of.  The explosiveness of his performance is in stark contrast
with the gray, rainy nature of the setting.  This is definitely one of
the film's saving graces.</P>
<P>     At its heart, MAC is a story about integrity and taking pride in
one's work.  As the title character proclaims, "You know what I think
happiness is?  To love your job...  If you hate your work, you hate your
life."  The specific focus of this film may be on an Italian American
family of carpenters, but the message is universal.  This is not a
great film - the character inter- action is often shaky - but the
production is energetic in getting its message across.</P>
<PRE>                            Rating: 7.6 (B, **1/2)</PRE>
