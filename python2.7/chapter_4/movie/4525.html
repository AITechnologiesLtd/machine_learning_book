<PRE>                                12 MONKEYS
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This is a complex and disturbing
          science fiction story that will not be to most
          people's taste.  Mixing time travel and
          schizophrenia in a film that is much too often
          painful to watch.  12 MONKEYS is by turns violent,
          revolting, contrived, and intelligent.  This is a
          film that is good without being recommendable.
          Rating: low +2 (-4 to +4).  A plot description of
          "La Jetee" follows in a spoiler section.  Be warned
          that it could be a spoiler for either film.</PRE>
<P>     The virus attack that started in December of 1996 has killed all
but a small remnant of civilization who live in 2035 in underground
hi-tech steel bunkers.  In the bunker under Philadelphia it is like
living in a prison for everyone but prisoners.  Convicted criminals are
kept caged in steel boxes and moved in and out by cranes when they are
chosen to "volunteer" for hazardous tasks.  Prisoner James Cole (Bruce
Willis) is picked to volunteer to collect biological samples on the
surface.  This mission leads to a more important mission, being sent
back in time to 1996 to collect fresh virus samples.  Instead, through
miscalculation, he ends in 1990 where he is almost immediately thrown
into a mental institution.  His doctor is psychologist Dr. Kathryn
Railly (Madeleine Stowe), an expert in of all things, prophecy.  He is
put under the mentorship of a hyperkinetic schizoid Jeffrey Goines
(Brad Pitt) whose most harmless delusions are of being the son of a
famous man.</P>
<P>     12 MONKEYS is a film of great flaws and of at least moderate
virtues.  There are far too many places where the film wanders far
beyond the realm of believability.  In one scene Railly goes visiting
dangerous and unstable men in prison wearing a provocative short skirt.
Admittedly the character had not planned for this at the beginning of
the evening, but it is unlikely she would do it, even so.  Some of the
coincidences that move the plot along are incredibly contrived.  This
is a film that even for strong science fiction film fans will be one
that is better to have seen than to be seeing.  Director Terry Gillium
made BRAZIL a downbeat film to watch, but at least one with its
whimsical side.  For this film he has removed just about all the charm
and created a nightmarish past and present, and an especially bleak
future.  His images grate like steel claws scratching on a blackboard.
The entire film is an assault on the emotions and the senses.  For
example, this is just the film for all those people who have been
waiting years to see Bruce Willis drool, bleed, spit, and eat spiders.
That is just the kind of film it is.  Much of the story takes place in
mental institutions or alleys of homeless schizophrenics.  There is
little that is uplifting or exciting about the film, though there are
some intriguing science fictional ideas, particularly about causality
and time travel.  There are several nice ironic time travel paradoxes.
The screenplay is provided by David Peoples (who co-authored
BLADERUNNER) and Janet Peoples.  Rarely does a film bear a credit for
being inspired by another film, but 12 MONKEYS is inspired by Chris
Marker's 29-minute film "La Jetee," which originally ran on a double
bill with ALPHAVILLE.</P>
<P>     Willis and Pitt each give disturbing performances.  Willis is not
a great actor, but he is better than he often appears.  And this film
certainly gives him more opportunity than most of his action films to
create a character.  Mostly this film gives him an opportunity to show
bewilderment.  Brad Pitt has been getting some attention for his wildly
gesticulating mental patient.  He is adequately strange, but nothing
world-class.  Madeleine plays someone considerably more normal than the
two male leads and as a result has a much less flashy role.  She is
much harder to notice by contrast, proving than in an insane world a
sane person appears not insane but only unmemorable.</P>
<P>     12 MONKEYS is a pretentious and self-indulgent piece of oppressive
and cheerless filmmaking, but for mavens of time travel stories it
delivers the goods.  I rate it a low +2 on the -4 to 4 scale.</P>
<P>     Spoiler...Spoiler...Spoiler...Spoiler...Spoiler...</P>
<P>     "La Jetee" is a short film made up almost entirely of still
photos.  The following is a synopsis:</P>
<P>     It is a post-holocaust Paris in which survivors live underground.
The underpinnings of reality and causality have been blown away.  H is
haunted by the image of a woman's face that he cannot get out of his
mind.  It becomes an obsession.  Because it has weakened his hold on
the present, a scientist thinks that he can actually send H traveling
in time (similar to SOMEWHERE IN TIME).  H goes back in time to an
incident in his past where he thinks he may have seen the woman on a
jetty.  Something bad (I forget what) happens while he is on the jetty,
and he is killed.  The last thing he sees before his death is the image
of a woman's face, the same image that brought him to his death.</P>
