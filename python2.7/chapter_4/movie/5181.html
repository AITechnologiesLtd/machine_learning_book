<P>     It's not every day that we get to see a reworking of CASABLANCA,
much less one that (a.) is adapted from a comic book and (b.) stars
Pamela Anderson Lee.  Ms. Lee, a.k.a. "the Baywatch babe," a.k.a.
"you're looking rather buoyant this evening," plays the title character,
a bounty-hunting bar owner who lives in a (near) future where civil war
is being waged between the Nazi-looking Congressionals and the
underground Resistance.  They all come to Barb's place, though, because
she doesn't take sides.  That is, until a former lover-- and Resistance
alley-- steps out of the past and into her bar.  Sound familiar?</P>
<P>     There's more, of course, including a fat man who rides in a bucket
loader, a pair of contact lenses that fool retina scans, and, oh yeah, a
rocket-firing motorcycle.  (Trust me: it sounds more exciting than it
is.) BARB WIRE has a great "look," but director David Hogan doesn't
deliver a decent action sequence until the end.  And don't expect any
Bogarts or Bergmans, either; most of the cast appears to have been hired
for "assets" other than their acting abilities.  (Calm down guys, this
stuff doesn't even qualify as *soft*-core porn.  Just cleavage cleavage
cleavage and only the *occasional* peek behind curtains number one and
two.) No, there isn't much to this movie beyond the, uh, obvious, but if
you love CASABLANCA, and you can stomach Pamela Lee's hissed-through-
clinched-teeth line readings, then this may be the matinee for you.</P>
