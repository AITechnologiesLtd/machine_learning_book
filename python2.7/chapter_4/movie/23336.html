SPARTACUS (1960)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>1950s weren't the happiest of times for Hollywood talents
with leftist sentiments, since in the atmosphere of Cold War
hysteria many were considered to be Communists. Many of them
were blacklisted by studios and forced to take pseudonyms in
order to earn their living. It took great courage for
executive producer Kirk Douglas to defy the Blacklist and
hire a screenwriter from such blacklist. It took even more
courage to use his talent to make adaptation of the novel
written by radical leftist Howard Fast. And, to add insult
to injury for any hysteric anti-leftists in these times, the
subject of the film was life of a man who was considered one
of great Communist martyrs and role models. It all happened
in 1960 with SPARTACUS, the film that finally ended the era
of Hollywood black lists and thus became one of landmark
events in the history of American cinema. Unfortunately, its
historical importance barely corresponded with the quality,
and today it is often considered to be "the worst film ever
directed by Stanley Kubrick".</P>
<P>The novel, as well as the film, is based on the events that
took place in the first part of 1st Century B.C. Once
democratic Roman Empire became the wealthiest and most
powerful nation of the world, but with the wealth came
corruption and widespread use of slavery. One of such slaves
is Spartacus (played by Kirk Douglas), tough Thracian who
was sentenced to spend the rest of his life working in
Lybian mines, but even in such terrible conditions he didn't
cease to defy his captors. Slave trader Batiatus (played by
Peter Ustinov) thinks that such fighting spirit could be
used, so he buys Spartacus for his gladiator school in
Capua, Italy. Spartacus is there being subjected in intense
combat training and also develops feelings for slave girl
Varinia (played by Jean Simmons). One day the school is
visited by powerful Roman politician Marcus Licinius Crassus
(played by Laurence Olivier), and Batiatus, in order to
entertain two of his lady companions, organises four of his
best gladiator fighting to the death. In one of such fights
Spartacus is defeated but his opponent Drabba (played by
Woody Strode) decides to spare his life and instead
sacrifices his own in vain attempt to escape. Spartacus is
deeply moved by such event and when his beloved Varinia is
being sold away, his personal anger leads to spontaneous act
of rebellion that would be joined by all of the gladiators.
Soon gladiators overwhelm their guards and the news of their
revolt begins spreading like wildfire. Spartacus and his
rebels begin plundering rich slave-owners' estates and
thousands of escaped and liberated slaves join his band.
Spartacus would use his combat skills and experience, as
well as his charisma, to organise them into fighting force
able to handle any Roman army sent after them. Spartacus
begins his campaign towards port city of Brundisium, where
he would find to transport slaves outside of Italy into
freedom. In the meantime, slave revolt has some important
political consequences in Roman Senate. While Crassus wants
to use it as a pretext to impose his personal dictatorship,
his main rival, liberal senator Crassus (played by Charles
Laughton) wants to use the revolt as way to foil such plans
and save the Republic.</P>
<P>SPARTACUS had a lot of potential to be one of the greatest
films of its era, and the big box-office success and few
"Oscars" prove that. Unfortunately, it failed in being
anything more than historical spectacle because people
behind the project had rather different creative visions.
For screenwriter Dalton Trambo this historical story was an
excellent opportunity to comment on the social condition of
1950s America, not so subtly disguised in his vision of 1st
Century B.C. Roman Republic. Both countries were most
powerful in the world, but their old republican institutions
and democratic virtues had been corrupted by social
injustice and class exploitation, and in both cases
ambitious politicians were threatening to use society's
paranoia in order to install their own personal
dictatorship. It isn't very hard to imagine character of
Crassus being inspired by Senator Joe McCarthy.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, when Stanley Kubrick replaced director
Anthony Mann after his quarrel with Kirk Douglas, it turned
out that Kubrick's vision was quite different. Kubrick,
being perfectionist, checked the historical data about
Spartacus and concluded that Trambo, just like many PC
filmmakers of today, sacrificed historical accuracy for the
sake of delivering political message. For example, many
important details of Spartacus' campaign and his multiple
attempts to lead slaves out of Italy, as well as infighting
and desertions within his own ranks, remained outside the
script. Furthermore, Trambo's idea to make huge contrast
between rich, decadent and utterly depraved Romans on one
side, and their hard-working, clean-cut and noble slaves was
definitely not in line with Kubrick's own more pessimistic
and misanthropic view on human affairs. After unsuccessful
attempts to change the script, Kubrick lost interest in the
film and did his job as "hired gun".</P>
<P>This becomes evident when we compare first third of the
film, which was directed by Mann, with the segments later
directed by Kubrick. The segment directed by Mann is the
best in the film, because it deals almost exclusively with
Spartacus and the events that led to revolt. The audience is
being subjected to all harsh realities of the life of slaves
and gladiators, and action dominates the words. But as soon
as the plot is removed from the gladiator school and Kubrick
takes over, film loses momentum. Spartacus and his
gladiators are reduced to cardboard characters, and even
charisma of Kirk Douglas can't make him as sympathetic as in
the first segment of film. Hollywoodised romance between
Spartacus and Varinia also doesn't help, being injected in
the plot only to give some bright overtones to the dark, yet
corny finale. In this segment, bad guys in the form of
Romans are more interesting than the slave protagonists.
Charles Laughton is simply grand as shrewd, cynical,
hedonistic yet kind-hearted Roman Senator. In the case of
Crassus, screenwriters obviously didn't know how to
reconcile or explain the sharp contrast between Crassus'
insistence on old Roman values on one side, and his
depravity and ruthless dictatorial ambition on the other.
But Laurence Olivier still shows his great talent by making
this badly written character memorable. Finally, Peter
Ustinov justly deserved his "Oscar" for the role of Batiatus
- his character, despite being involved in one of the most
deplorable professions of slave trade, comes out as nice guy
at the end, not because of some sudden virtue, but because
of his humanity. Tony Curtis as slave Antoninus, singer of
songs we hear spoken as plain text, on the other hand,
played his role very badly, and his character would be
remembered simply as the dark object of Crassus' bisexual
desire.</P>
<P>Script and characterisation problems aside, SPARTACUS is
very attractive film because it doesn't lack spectacle. In
the latter part of film, Kubrick obviously tried to
compensate the lack of movie's quality with quantity - there
are plenty of mass scenes with many interesting details and
good use of colour photography by Russell Metty.
Unfortunately, the most spectacular scene - the final battle
between Spartacus and Roman legions under Crassus - is a
failure. We actually don't see why and how the slaves had
been beaten and Kubrick's effort to direct some 8,500
Spanish soldiers hired as extras weren't justified. After
the last climactic battle, we are presented with its tragic
aftermath, and subjected to many extra minutes of historical
inaccuracy and pointless melodrama. The music by Alex North
is also somewhat disappointing and explains why Kubrick in
his later films relied mostly on non-original soundtrack.</P>
<P>For some people three hours spent in front of SPARTACUS
might seem wasted, but despite being much overrated, this
historical epic can be quite entertaining. It is especially
interesting because of the insight given into one important
and splendid era of American motion picture industry, as
well into the early career of Stanley Kubrick.</P>
