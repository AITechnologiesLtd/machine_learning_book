<P>     If this is what it's really like to spend a couple days in the San 
Fernando Valley during the hottest time of the year, then, like W.C. 
Fields, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  Actually, for a movie that's so 
precise about time (one of the characters is constantly using a 
stopwatch), the title's a little inaccurate.  Unless I'm completely 
confused about when things started and stopped, it's not so much 2 DAYS 
IN THE VALLEY as it is about twenty-four hours.</P>
<P>     What we have here is actually four individual stories that 
occasionally intersect, often in the most odd and unpredictable of ways.  
One of the best aspects of 2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY is the clever manner in 
which the narrative has been assembled.  While things aren't nearly as 
elaborately-connected as in PULP FICTION, I like the way paths cross, 
characters just miss each other, and everything comes together during 
the climactic ten minutes.  While the plot of 2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY isn't 
a masterpiece of intrigue or intricacy, it kept me involved and 
entertained, and that's about the best you can hope for from this sort 
of motion picture.</P>
<P>     The film opens with two hitmen, Desmo (Danny Aiello), an old-timer 
who's washed up, and Lee (James Spader), a cool-as-a-cucumber sociopath, 
staking out the house where a notorious womanizer, Roy Foxx (Peter 
Horton), is making the moves on his ex-wife, Becky (Teri Hatcher).  
Desmo and Lee have a contract to kill Roy, but who's paying the bill?  
And, unbeknownst to Desmo, Lee is preparing a little surprise for him 
once the night's work is done.  In the end, Desmo ends up alive and on 
his own, and is forced to take hostages.</P>
<P>     Meanwhile, a wealthy art dealer, Allan Hopper (Greg Cruttwell), 
suffering from an acute case of kidney stones, has to be rushed to the 
hospital.  His personal assistant, Susan (Gleanne Headly), brings him 
home afterwards.  To reward her for her loyalty over eight years of 
service, he offers to pay for breast implants and liposuction, claiming 
that if she took care of herself, she might get a man.</P>
<P>     Two vice cops, Alvin (Jeff Daniels) and Wes (Eric Stoltz) are 
staking out a Japanese massage parlor, intending to bust the employees 
for illegal sexual activities.  However, when Wes goes inside to get a 
first-hand experience, he feels sorry for the girl who services him, and 
walks out without making an arrest.  Alvin, who's going through a series 
of tough personal problems, is furious at his partner, who shows more 
interest in playing homicide detective than doing his job.</P>
<P>     Finally, there's Teddy Peppers (Paul Mazursky), the Emmy-Award 
winning director of ARTHUR'S LAST HOPE.  But that was four years ago, 
and, since then, he's had nothing but bombs.  His life is a wasteland 
and his finances are in disarray.  So, after finding a woman (Marsha 
Mason) who's willing to take responsibility for locating a new home for 
his beloved dog, he decides to end it all with a gun.  Fate intercedes, 
however -- but not just in Teddy's life.  In one way or another, the 
wheels of destiny bring nearly all of these characters together, 
although not always at the same time and in the same place.</P>
<P>     2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY has a penchant for the outrageous, with 
generous helpings of dark and ironic humor.  There are a number of 
laugh-aloud lines, but the film works best when the comedy is of the 
"wink-wink-nudge-nudge" variety.  For example, there's a scene where 
Alvin and Lee, cop and killer, are parked side-by-side at a traffic 
light.  Then there's an incident where a bystander saves Allan by 
hotwiring a car to transport him to the hospital.  Or, in one of my 
favorite scenes, Dosmo, ever the cordial hostage-taker, offers to cook 
pasta for his captives.  </P>
<P>     Teri Hatcher fans will be pleased.  The actress has a fair-sized 
chunk of screen time, and, although she keeps all her clothes on, she 
gets involved in a nice little cat fight with a statuesque blond, 
Charlize Theron (who does not keep all her clothes on throughout).  Most 
everyone in the cast does a good job, but the standouts are Aiello, who 
is hilarious as the toupeed, down-on-his-luck, dog-fearing hitman, and 
Spader, playing against type, as his emotionless partner.  Keith 
Carradine, Louise Fletcher, Austin Pendleton, and Lawrence Tierney all 
have cameos.</P>
<P>     I enjoyed 2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY.  It's pure entertainment -- nothing 
too serious, nothing too deep -- with an artistic sensibility.  It's 
rare for movies these days to recognize that their audience has an 
intelligence, and even more unusual for them not to talk down to us.  2 
DAYS does both.  So, if you're looking for some smart fun, John 
Herzfeld's feature is a worthy choice.  And you don't need two days -- 
just two hours.</P>
