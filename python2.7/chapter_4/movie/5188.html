In French with subtitles</P>
<P>     Maybe I just don't understand the French sense of humor.  After 
all, they think Jerry Lewis is a comic genius.  Whatever the reason, I 
rarely find "lowbrow" French comedies more than passably watchable (and, 
in the case of LITTLE INDIAN, BIG CITY, not watchable at all).  THE 
VISITORS, which was released three years ago, drew huge crowds across 
its native land, outgrossing the imported JURASSIC PARK.  The French 
loved it -- a sentiment that I definitely do not share.</P>
<P>     It's curious that, for all the French outcries against American 
imports, this particular home-grown hit has "Hollywood" written all over 
it.  Strip away the subtitles, and the result is the kind of mediocre 
comedy that major American production companies turn out with alarming 
regularity.  THE VISITORS is a "least common denominator" motion picture 
-- largely mindless, sporadically funny, and creatively handicapped.</P>
<P>     When THE VISITORS scored big in France, Miramax Films immediately 
snapped up the U.S. rights.  That's when the problems started, because 
Miramax couldn't figure out how best to market it.  At one point, they 
were poised to release a dubbed version, but it was pulled back at the 
last minute (considering the audience response to the dubbed LITTLE 
INDIAN, BIG CITY, it was probably a wise move).  Now, finally, Miramax 
has decided on a simple strategy -- add subtitles, but don't change 
anything.  So, after three years, THE VISITORS will reach American 
theaters.  It's not worth the wait.</P>
<P>     The opening is promising.  THE VISITORS starts with a send-up of 
grandiose French costume dramas, introducing us to a series of armored 
knights and damsels in distress.  One of the former is Sir Godefroy, the 
Count of Montmirail (Jean Reno), a renowned warrior.  When he saves the 
king's life, he is given permission to marry the woman of his choice, 
Lady Frenegonde (Valerie Lemercier).  Unfortunately, after drinking wine 
laced with a witch's hallucinogenic, Godefroy mistakes Frenegonde's 
father for a bear, and kills him.  Frenegonde then enters a convent,  
unwilling to marry the man who killed her father.</P>
<P>     For help, Godefroy goes to the local wizard, who proposes a way of 
changing history.  By drinking a potion, Godefroy can go back in time 
and alter what happened.  Unfortunately, the wizard gets the ingredients 
wrong, and the knight, along with his faithful retainer, Jacquasse 
(Christian Clavier), ends up nearly 1000 years in the future, in 1992.  
There, these two "fish out of water" embark on a series of misadventures 
that puts CROCODILE DUNDEE to shame.</P>
<P>     Some viewers will undoubtedly notice superficial similarities to 
MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL and TIME BANDITS.  However, while those 
films steered a bizarre premise in wonderfully unexpected, comic 
directions, THE VISITORS uses comparable ideas in the service of a banal 
plot with cheap jokes.  There were times when I thought I was watching a 
cross between ERIK THE VIKING and DUMB AND DUMBER.</P>
<P>     There are some hilarious moments, such as when Jacquasse first 
encounters a car, or when Godefroy and Jacquasse attempt to discern how 
the various conveniences of a modern bathroom function.  And there are a 
few attempts at the more intellectual approach of lampooning 
Shakespearean language with lines like "It stinketh", "Let's splitteth", 
and "Holy scrotums!" (Incidentally, these lines work a little better if 
you understand the original French.)  Unfortunately, the good parts of 
THE VISITORS are isolated, and it's debatable whether the rest is worth 
wading through to get to them.</P>
<P>     For those who are convinced that all films emerging from France are 
snobbish, elitist, and artistically upscale, THE VISITORS will quickly 
change that impression.  Subtitles excepted, American audiences won't 
find much here that they couldn't unearth in 50% of the titles currently 
playing in mainstream multiplexes.  Ultimately, it's this conformance to 
mediocrity that brings down THE VISITORS.</P>
