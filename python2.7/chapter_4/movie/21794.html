<P>James Bond is back in yet another mission to save the world from evil.</P>
<PRE>The Review</PRE>
<P>    There aren't many film series that make it past the third sequel or
so. And of the handful that come to mind (Police Academy, Hallowe'en,
Friday The 13th), only James Bond has managed to stay interesting and
successful. While the other series suffer from a lack of star power,
repetitive situational comedy or poor efforts, Bond has never failed.
The lead actor switches help; when Roger Moore's run was starting to
sag, even Timothy Dalton's presence helped, though not for long. A
strong reliance on testosterone-fuelled explosions and sex has given the
series a large set of fans which shows no sign of abandoning ship. The
only problem with Bond is the fact that this, the 19th film in the
series, suffers from an obvious lack of originality. Basically,
everything has been done. Boat scenes? Check. Ski scenes? Check. Outer
space scenes? Check. You name it and Bond has done it. This gives The
World Is Not Enough a been there, done that feel, and makes for a
forgettable cinematic experience.</P>
<P>    Does this sound familiar? A bald, facially-scarred villain wants to
re-shape the globe using a nuclear weapon. It should, because not only
did classic Bond baddie Ernst Bloefeld try this, so did Dr. Evil from
the Bond-parody Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery. With
nothing new left to try, director Michael Apted is forced to take Bond's
adventures from the past, and make them better; he does not succeed.</P>
<P>    The story, involving a nuclear bomb, some oil pipelines, and several
beautiful women is as pointless as it is poorly written. The point of
Bond is to remind us once again that he is "the gentleman spy" and that
he can get out of any situation. Yet there is a sense of desperation
about the film, as if the pantheon of writers involved in the project
were worried that there wasn't enough "Bond-ness" to go around. So
instead of a ski chase where he is pursued by other skiers, he is chased
by ultra-cool para-choppers. Instead of a thrilling boat chase, we get a
thrilling boat chase followed by a short trip through city streets and
cafes, where in the real world he would kill easily five to ten people
with his actions. Instead of simply being debonair with the ladies, he
beds not one, not two, but three of them, including Denise Richards, who
is 27 to Brosnan's 46. Some of the action sequences are undeniably
interesting, but it has all been done.</P>
<P>    The acting is what you would expect from a Bond film. Sophie Marceau
does a better job as Elektra than she did previously opposite David
Spade in Lost & Found, though this does not say much. Marceau has a
monotone way of speaking that gets irritating after a short while, and
does not fit the part very well. As Dr. Christmas Jones, Richards plays
a nuclear physicist (the concept of which is laughable) and you just
know her unorthodox name garners a few lame jokes in the film. Richards
is a dreadful actress in my opinion and (I never thought I would say
this of anyone in a Bond film) her lack of acting ability hampers the
film greatly. Brosnan is in usual form, as are Judi Dench and Desmond
Llewelyn in their returning roles as M and Q (John Cleese makes a cameo
as R). Robbie Coltrane is amusing a Russian caviar gangster, while
Robert Carlyle (of Ravenous and The Full Monty) joins a long list of
over the top Bond villains as Renard, a terrorist who has a bullet
lodged in his brain with gives him super-strength and pain tolerance.</P>
<P>    About the only things that impressed me about this film were the
opening credits sequence and the music. After the traditional shot of
Bond centred in a gunman's sights, the title appears and we are treated
to an appealing mosaic of flowing oil droplets which form female
silhouettes while a song by rock band Garbage plays. While in no way
revolutionary, the special effects display is intriguing and one of the
few things about the film that didn't remind me of something else. The
score by David Arnold takes the classic Bond theme song and gives it an
electronica-laced overhaul, giving several scenes a musical boost.</P>
<P>    The bottom line with this film is simple; if you are a devoted Bond
fan, go see the film, you will probably like it. If you have hated every
Bond film you have ever seen, then do not go see this one, it is more of
the same. This is an old series which is in need of another boost
(luckily Pierce Brosnan has declared this his final Bond, opening the
door to another new face and some new ideas). One can hope that that
boost will come soon, before Bond starts to sink, the way Batman did
after his first film.</P>
