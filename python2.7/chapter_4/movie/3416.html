<PRE>Me: *** (out of four stars) Rhonda</PRE>
<P>     After a successful run in Australia last year, and with much
critical praise heaped upon it, MURIEL'S WEDDING opens into medium
release this weekend in North America.</P>
<P>     Muriel Heslop is a withdrawn, overweight young woman living in
Porpoise Spit, Australia.  She is often the target of her father's
frequent rants at the family, and drowns out her feelings of inadequacy
with ABBA music and fantasies of marriage.  Her self-loathing is such
that only being wed shall she prove herself to be a success; marriage
will transform her into a new person who is respected and admired.
After her four cliquey friends dump her, Muriel plots to follow them to
a resort where they are celebrating the honeymoon of one of the girls,
and MURIEL'S WEDDING unfolds from there.</P>
<P>     Toni Collette plays Muriel in a winning performance, conveying
both the sadness of her character and her desperate eagerness to be
accepted.  Collette gained a frightening 43 pounds in order to play the
chubby title character.  She has a natural screen presence and exudes
charisma, easily winning the audience over with an honest, painful
performance.  Collette basically carries the film, appearing in almost
every scene.</P>
<P>     Muriel's father, Bill "The Battler" Heslop, is portrayed by Bill
Hunter as a slick politician/developer.  While chumming around with
young fans and crowing 'you can't beat progress' (his slogan), Bill
labels his family as worthless and embarrassments.  Rachel Griffiths
plays Rhonda, who becomes Muriel's cheeky new friend in the film.  She
has good chemistry with Collette, and the film suffers when Griffiths
is off-screen.  Muriel's tormenters, played by Pippa Grandison, Rosalind
Hammond, Belinda Jarrett and Sophie Lee, are two-dimensional
caricatures, all saucy, vain and bumblingly spiteful, though that is
probably due to Hogan's scripting</P>
<P>     MURIEL'S WEDDING is essentially a genre teen comedy with more
intelligence and a lot of charm.  Hogan's use of ABBA tunes (which
virtually comprises the entire soundtrack) is interestingly
appropriate, although its repetitiveness tires after awhile.  Hogan's
script is right on the mark in terms of proportionately mixing comedy
with Muriel's earnest quest for acceptance, and the gorgeous scene with
Muriel window-shopping beautifully illustrates the wonder that marriage
has for her.  The glaring pastel colours worn by the performers is an
interesting touch.  MURIEL'S WEDDING features a fine performance by
Toni Collette and a charming, if a bit too straightforward and
conventional story by P.J. Hogan.  On my four star scale, I give
MURIEL'S WEDDING three stars.</P>
