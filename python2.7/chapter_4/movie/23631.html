The Insider (8/10) </PRE>
<P>Based on events on the early 1990s, The Insider tells how CBS television
producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) persuaded tobacco industry whistle-
blower Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe) to break the confidentiality
agreement he had with his ex-employer and spill the beans on the
management's knowledge that their product was indeed addictive, despite
their sworn public declarations to the contrary. Getting the interview
with Wigand taped was only half the battle, and the film shows the
further struggles Bergman had persuading CBS to air it.</P>
<P>Michael Mann's film finds high drama in telephone calls and faxes, and
his distinctive slick visual style, which was a large part of the appeal
of his TV series Miami Vice, is evident here, although the flashiness
has evolved to take into account the (literally) broader canvas and more
leisurely pace of film. For example, as in his films Manhunter and Heat,
characters are shown in long contemplative silence, framed off-centre in
widescreen fields of garish colour. At times the style threatens to get
in the way of the content, but Mann mostly manages to keep himself in
check.</P>
<P>Al Pacino has in recent years tended to chew the scenery in histrionic
fits, but here he turns in a more carefully controlled performance,
perhaps his best since The Scent of a Woman. But it can't beat Russell
Crowe's terrific performance as the tormented executive. A complex
character, Wigand comes across as a decent principled man without being
particularly likeable. Crowe put on weight for the part, and it is
astonishing that this is the same actor I'd seen in a trailer for
Gladiator a few days earlier. </P>
<P>The Insider has proved controversial largely because the names of the
individuals and corporations have not been changed in this
dramatisation, and a few feathers were understandably ruffled. In
particular, Mike Wallace, the 60 Minutes front-man played by Christopher
Plummer, objected to the way he is portrayed failing to back up
Bergman's attempts to convince the CBS suits to broadcast Wigand's
interview. The tobacco company involved was also miffed, and insisted
that the film include a disclaimer pointing out that the source of the
death threats against the Wigands was never established. </P>
<P>How accurate the film is in its details is open to question, but it
seems that the film successfully communicates the broad truth of the
case. Does it really matter? I think it does. All The President's Men,
with which The Insider is bound to be compared, was a similarly talky
but compelling tale of investigative journalists persuading reluctant
witnesses to reveal their inside knowledge of the dirty dealings of
powerful interests, in this case political rather than corporate. Such
films can have a dramatic influence on public perceptions of such
events. Although I've read Woodstein's book, my memories of what
Watergate was all about come mainly from watching Robert Redford and
Dustin Hoffman. Probably the same is true for many US citizens, for whom
these events are not just the stuff of casual interest but form an
important part of recent history. I think filmmakers have a
responsibility with material of this sort, and The Insider and All The
President's Men are both honourable films which discharge this
responsibility. At the other extreme, Oliver Stone's JFK is an example
of the damage that can be done by a talented but misguided filmmaker
meddling with sensitive historical material.</P>
<P>Tackling a tricky subject head-on, The Insider is a stylish and
compelling drama with two excellent lead performances, confirming
Michael Mann as one of mainstream Hollywood's most interesting
filmmakers.</P>
