<PRE>Ran (1985)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 88</PRE>
<P>In 1957, Japanese Director Akira Kurosawa borrowed
from Shakespeare's "Macbeth" for his film "Throne
of Blood".  Nearly three decades later, Kurosawa
returned to the setting of medieval Japanese armies
at war, this time adapting plot elements from
Shakespeare's "King Lear".  "Ran" is the Japanese
symbol for chaos, an apt description of the story:
the disintegration of a family dynasty through ambition,
treachery and war.</P>
<P>Elderly warlord Hidetora Ichimonji (Tatsuya Nakadai)
decides to cede power to his eldest son Taro (Akira Terao).
Middle son Jiro (Jinpachi Nezu) approves, but youngest
son Saburo (Daisuke Ryu) objects, suggesting that the family
will be destroyed by the rival ambitions of the older
brothers.  Hidetora banishes his impudent son, but his
prophecy quickly comes to pass.  Hidetora is turned out
by his sons, becomes lunatic, and hides in the countryside
aided only by court jester Kyoami (Peter) and loyal servant
Tango (Masayuki Yui).  Meanwhile, Taro's wife Kaede
(Mieko Harada) uses Taro and Jiro in her machinations for
revenge against the Ichimonji family, leading to a
disastrous war with Saburo's soldiers and allies.</P>
<P>As in "Throne of Blood", the destructive ambitions of
the warlords are stoked by the schemes of a woman (Kaede).
The battle scenes, the sets, and the cinematography
are all excellent.  Just one complaint: there must
be a hundred warriors shot down from their horses,
but not once does a horse fall.  I am not advocating
cruelty to animals, but medieval marksmanship couldn't
have been that good!</P>
<P>Hidetora has two distinct personalities: the bold,
ruthless warlord, and the lost, cowardly madman.
It is to Nadakai's credit that he plays both roles
well.  His character's wild mane of white hair
perfectly matches his pathos.  The effeminate
supporting character of Kyoami is the most interesting:
the court fool can say things that, if said by others,
would be treasonous.  But it is advice worth
considering.</P>
<P>With the help of the Internet Movie Database,
I did some quick research on Kurosawa.  Sixteen
films that he directed have received at least
fifty votes.  All sixteen films average between
8.0 and 8.9 (out of 10), an extremely impressive
record of consistency.  Kurosawa, who was 75 years
old at film's completion, also edited and co-wrote
"Ran" (with Hideo Oguni and Masato Ide). It was
at the time the most expensive Japanese film ever
made.  It was nominated for four Academy Awards
(unusual for a foreign-language film) including
Best Director and Best Cinematography
(Takao Saito, Masaharu Ueda, Asakazu Nakai).</P>
