<P>        DR. AKAGI--a farcical tragedy about (in no particular order) a blue
whale, grave-robbing, a nuclear bomb, hepatitis, a Dutch spy, a morphine
addict, a microscope, an arc lamp, a bayonet-wielding granny, and the fate
of virgin boys in battle--is reputedly the final film by the great Japanese
director Shohei Imamura.  If so, he goes out with a bang--not that a
whimper was ever likely.  It is not his definitive work, but it is
representative of his vision of human life as anarchic, fertile, harsh,
communal, bawdy, and, above all, resilient.</P>
<P>        World War II is nearing its end.  The small Japanese town of Hibi
is not what you would call strategically important, and it experiences the
war at a distance, in radio broadcasts and air-raid sirens.  But the
psychic stresses the community feels are no less painful, and the people of
Hibi mostly cope by means of the usual opiates--sex, drugs, alcohol--but
while the opiates are usual, the people are not, including a drunken
priest, a cynical morphine-addicted doctor, a
prostitute-turned-doctor's-assistant (latest in a long line of pragmatic,
carnal, emotive Imamura heroines), and so on.  They are vividly portrayed,
in the round, and the anguished sense that they use their vices as
desperate survival strategies, as ways of both coping with and escaping
from war-time reality, is moving.</P>
<P>        Then there is Dr. Akagi, who stands apart.  Our first sight of him
is revealing.  He is running, as he often does, from one patient's home to
the next.  He is immaculate and comic in a pristine white suit and shirt,
knee-length black stockings and bow-tie, legs pumping furiously as a jaunty
jazz theme plays on the soundtrack.  The mock pomposity of this first
impression is apt: there is something both absurd and admirable about
Akagi, in his futile devotion and his fruitless heroics.</P>
<P>        A middle-aged widower with a son serving in the army, he is
unsparing of himself in his attention to his patients, but he also
diagnoses all of them with hepatitis, and is affectionately mocked as a
charlatan and "Dr. Liver."  Nevertheless, he is beloved.  He never seems to
heal anyone, but he persists: if he did not, he might have to think about
his son, his wife, the war, things for which there is no diagnosis, no
prescription.</P>
<P>        He is fond of telling anyone who will listen that hepatitis will be
the next epidemic to sweep Japan, if preventive measures are not taken.  It
soon becomes clear that while Akagi truly believes he is talking about
swollen livers, what the film is talking about is something else.
Hepatitis is what happens when the body can no longer process its toxins
properly, and, metaphorically, that is what is happening to Japan:
destructive energies are not being contained, but are running rampant
through the country, manifest as participation in the war.  Every patient
whom we see Akagi treat is treated for hepatitis (except, significantly,
his one foreign patient), but what he is really trying--and failing--to
treat is the underlying sickness of Japanese society.</P>
<P>        When the nuclear bombs fall, in the end, as they must, it is the
ultimate symptom of the sickness.  The bomb may be dropped by America, but
the blame, in DR. AKAGI, must be shouldered by Japan: the nuclear attack is
the fatal consequence of the disease of war, the disease Japan refused to
treat.  It is a harsh message, and beneath the vital profuse energy that
fuels the film, there is anger and sadness: anger that no one cured the
sickness, sadness because maybe it couldn't be cured anyway.</P>
<P>        DR. AKAGI is a busy movie: there's a lot going on, a lot of people,
a lot of plots.  It tries, with considerable gusto, to bring life to each
character, each story, but it takes on too much.  It is crammed full of
life, only to become something of a mess.  Perhaps that is the necessary
price of any attempt to show life as chaotic and haphazard, but in DR.
AKAGI the disordered shapelessness of the film almost cripples its central
thrust.</P>
<P>        Then there is the ending, which, despite its uneven execution, is
laudable for its audacity, and memorable.  While his earlier (and better)
BLACK RAIN was an unusually sober and gravely respectful look at the
aftermath of the nuclear bombing, Imamura here frames a response to the
bombing that is characteristic of his work as a whole.  He provokes a sense
both of pathos and preposterousness, as his characters look upon the rising
mushroom cloud and discuss it in terms that are utterly banal and wildly
inappropriate.  He strives to wed the sublime to the ridiculous, but some
risible special effects disrupt the complex discordance of tone, the
attempt to shape the conflicted impulses of the film into something great.
It is an attempt that fails, but not by much.</P>
