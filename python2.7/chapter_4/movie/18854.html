<PRE>Both videos reviewed by Jon Turner</PRE>
<P>Disney has recently released two new videos on May 26, it's 11th masterpiece,
The Adventures Of Ichabod & Mr. Toad and another direct-to-home sequel, The
Brave Little Toaster To The Rescue.  The question is, which one is good and
which one isn't?  You'll find out here.</P>
<PRE>THE ADVENTURES OF ICHABOD & MR. TOAD</PRE>
<P>Before I go into detail about this movie, there are a few things you should
know about it.  This film was created at a time when the studio was troubled. 
Walt was still around, but World War II had caused his studio to lose its
momentum that always gave its films, such as Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs,
Pinocchio, Fantasia, Dumbo, and Bambi.  Because of money shortages (and the
Latin market cut off), Walt Disney and his staff had no choice; they couldn't
make another full-length feature, so they decided to do a multi-feature film. 
In other words, a compilation of various cartoons that had been in production
before, during, or after the war.  Two of these compilations were multi-feature
films, Make Mine Music and Melody Time.  The other two were double-feature
films, Fun And Fancy Free and the very film that I just mentioned earlier, The
Adventures Of Ichabod & Mr. Toad.</P>
<P>Don't be fooled by the title.  This was originally supposed to have been
called Two Fabulous Characters, but Walt probably thought the name would be a
disgrace.  The Adventures Of Ichabod & Mr. Toad is two famous stories given the
typical Disney treatment, Kenneth Grahame's The Wind In The Willows and
Washington Irving's The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow.  Both featurettes were well
received by the public and critics.  Leonard Maltin, in his The Disney Films
book, particularly praised The Wind In The Willows for featuring "some of the
finest work the studio ever did".  This may be stretching things too far, but
The Wind In The Willows is nevertheless an entertaining, well-executed cartoon,
and it holds well to this day.</P>
<P>For those of you who don't know, here is how the story goes:  It's about a
toad, J. Thaddeus Toad, squire of the famous Toad Hall.  Now he has three
friends, Ratty, Moley, and Angus MacBadger.  Now Toad is not your average
every-day man; he has a tendency to get into manias–manias that cause him to be
in greater debts than ever (near bankruptcy, in fact).  One particular mania
riding is a gypsy's carriage with a happy-go-lucky horse, Cyril.  As they ride
along the countryside singing, "We're merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily on our
way to nowhere in particular" they cause damage everywhere.  This is SO
shocking, in fact, that Ratty and Mole literally have to lock him up to prevent
something much worse happening.  Of course, this is exactly what happens.  Toad
gets obsessed with getting a motor car (even if it is stolen by a gang of
crafty weasels, which in this case, it is), and trades Toad Hall for it–an act
that results with him arrested and put on trial.  All seems hopeless until
Winky, a pompous bar tender is called on to testify.  Only he can tell the
truth, but he tells a different side of the story: "You tried to sell me a
stolen motor car."  Toad lands in jail, but Cyril bails him out, and there is a
long, extended escape scene which includes a train chase.  The chase ends when
Toad jumps off the train into the river below (as they are passing over a
bridge, leaving the cops behind).  After getting himself out of the water (this
is never shown, so I have no idea how he gets out of there with his ball 'n
chain), he heads to his friends, who have discovered, courtesy of MacBadger,
that Winky is actually the leader of the weasels whom Toad traded Toad Hall for
the motor car.  They plan to get the deed back from Winky so they can prove
Toad's innocence.  It isn't easy.  They have to sneak in the back way of Toad
Hall and battle the weasels to retrieve the deed (by the way, this scene is
awesome, and strikingly staged; running around on the floor, swinging from the
chandeliers–don't try this at home!–, and literally dropping in on a snoring
Winky to retrieve the paper).  Eventually, they succeed, and Toad is proven
innocent.  You might think that Toad may be, as the narrator (Basil Rathbone)
tells us, a "new toad", but that is not the case.  He has found a new
mania–airplanes.</P>
<P>To call The Wind In The Willows, as Maltin did, the finest piece of work ever
to be done by Disney may be stretching things too far, but there is much to
enjoy in this film.  There is a great cast of characters, and a couple of
amusing scenes.  One such amusing scene in particular is when Ratty starts
yakking away at Toad on his foolishness.  And how does Toad respond?  By
holding his hands over his ears, that's how! (As he does this, the soundtrack
becomes muted; a very nice touch).  It is moments like this (and the
unforgettable characters) that make The Wind In The Willows worth a look.  I
give it a ****1/2 out of *****.</P>
<P>The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow, on the other hand, is another story.  While it is
equally well staged, it is a trifle lackluster.  The problem might be in the
choice of Bing Crosby as the narrator.  He was, at the time of the film, a
popular choice during the Depression area.  However, to this day, he comes off
as lame and annoying.  He goes a little bit too far in narrating the story
(he's too over dramatic), and his singing (or what you would call it), along
with his humorous occasional "bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-boo-boo-boo-boo" don't help
much.  However, at the scene of the Halloween party at Van Tassel where tough
bully Brom Bones tells schoolmaster Ichabod Crane (who, by the way, has a habit
for snitching a few foods here and there) the story of the dreaded Headless(!)
Horseman, things do start to get more interesting.  Why is Brom telling Ichabod
such a terrible story?  Both of them are in love with the beautiful (and over
exaggerated) Katrina Van Tassell.  Ichabod has succeeded in sweeping Katrina
off her feet (not literally), and Bones is none too happy about that.  So to
buzz Ichabod off, he scares him to death with this tale, through song (one of
the more bouncy ones in this featurette).  Things REALLY get creepy when
Ichabod starts to ride home across his trusty steed, Gunpowder, where the sky
is dark, the forest menacing (the crickets chirp "Ichabod", and the frogs croak
"Headless Horseman".  Really scary, all right)…  and Mr. Headless himself, with
a horrifyingly evil laughter, and a scary, black costume, red cape, and black
steed.  This is where things REALLY get more exciting; there is a spectacular,
long, extended chase scene in which Ichabod tries to outrun the Headless
Horseman.  How can he escape this monster?  He must cross the bridge of Sleepy
Hollow, for, as Brom Bones has told him, "Once you cross that bridge, my
friends, the ghost is through–his power ends!"  When he FINALLY makes it across
the bridge, the Headless Horseman does not become powerless, his head (a
pumpkin) is whirled across the bridge, which explodes into a raging fire.  The
next morning, we see Ichabod's hat and a shattered pumpkin, but we don't see
Ichabod anywhere!  What happened to him?  Was he really spirited by the
Headless Horseman?  Or is he still alive, and married to a wealthy widow in a
distant county?  Whatever the answers, Bones succeeds in winning Katrina's
heart, and takes her to the altar.</P>
<P>Who are we rooting for in this story?  That is the most puzzling question one
could ask of The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow.  Ichabod Crane barely says anything,
he just hums, trips across limbs, and try to win over the ladies.  Brom Bones
is too mean-spirited to be a sympathetic character; he plays tricks on Ichabod
everywhere he goes.  None of the characters in this sequence are well defined,
so it becomes difficult for us to feel happy or sad when this darkly
entertaining tale comes to a close.  Also, as mentioned before, Crosby spends
too much time showing off rather than seriously telling the story.  All that
said, The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow benefits greatly from its long, extended,
hair-raising, heart-thumping climax, and for that, if not anything else, I
enjoyed it.  I give it *** out of *****.</P>
<P>My average rating for The Adventures Of Ichabod & Mr. Toad is ***1/2.  It's
not the best feature Disney has every done, but if you're a diehard
Disney-Masterpiece collector fan (I certainly am–I own almost every single film
Disney released on video, if you pardon me for bragging) it's yet another must
buy for your Disney collection.</P>
<P>THE BRAVE LITTLE TOASTER TO THE RESCUE</P>
<P>Disney is really going nuts on its Brave Little Toaster franchise.  The
original The Brave Little Toaster, based on a children's novella by Thomas M.
Disch, was a delightful animated piece of entertainment with hilarious
characters, such as the brave little toaster himself, a bright lamp, a
wisecracking radio, a sweet electric blanket, and a grumpy vacuum cleaner (They
have personalities of their own).  It was so enjoyable, in fact, that it won
the 1988 Parents' Choice Television Award.</P>
<P>It was followed, ten years later, by a direct to home video sequel, The Brave
Little Toaster Goes To Mars.  While it did have its moments, such as the
as-always funny characters, and gag lines "Houston, we have a problem!", the
whole film wasn't as much as enjoyable or delightful as it was silly and
formulaic (a toaster and appliances going to Mars?!  How ridiculous!).  It was
almost like a "cheap deal", and not anywhere near half as good as the original.</P>
<P>Now, Disney has released another sequel, The Brave Little Toaster To The
Rescue.  My guess is, is that they are trying to make another trilogy, like
they did with Aladdin.  What made the Aladdin trilogies enjoyable where the
fact that it took a lot of effort and heart to bring them to life.  The Toaster
direct-to-home-sequel, however, was a "cheap deal".  This one had me suspicious
since I was ticked off by the previous sequel, but this was a turnabout of
expectations:  this one is surprisingly decent.  It's not really a "sequel",
but a prequel to the Mars movie.  It's more exciting, it has more heart, and
while it falls far short of being as good as the original movie, this is still
a great improvement over the first sequel.</P>
<P>It starts out with Rob and his girlfriend, Chris, driving towards college
(with a catchy song playing), explaining that he can't wait for their
graduation and anniversary (Anniversary?  Anniversary about what?  Even Rob
doesn't know that).  He drops Chris off and heads towards an informatory
hospital, where his beloved appliances, Toaster, Blanky, Kirby, Lampy, and
Radio, who come to life when no one else is around, via the toys in Toy Story,
are awaiting his return (He is their master, after all).  After some by play,
Lampy jumps out of the window (with the help of Radio, who is pretty funny in
his own way, considering that this isn't Jon Lovitz).  He then "freezes" in his
lamp position when he arrives at the Master's dormitory, where Rob works on
some sort of assignment.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the appliances back home hear complaints about "abandonment" from
the cranky rat, Ratso (from the unbelievably stupid Mars sequel).  It is hear
we meet some new characters.  One is a mother cat named Maisie, who worries
that the first thing her kittens will see is Ratso (there is some by play about
this).  Another is a tiny Chihuahua, Alberto, whose leg is busted.  There is
also a snake, Murgetroid, who spittles every time he hisses ("I'd recommend
steering clear of such words with too much s-s-s-sibiliance, pal," comments
Ratso, when he gets spitted on by the snake.)  Finally, there's a wise man in
the group, in the form of a monkey, Sebastian (not the crab).  Anyhow, the room
is a mess from a party last night (they invited party friendly Dobermans over
to have some fun), and they have to, as Radio states, "mambo out of this mess".
 This they do, while breaking into song, where the animals reminisce when they
first met Rob, with the exception of Sebastian (while Ratso covers his ears, as
the most anti-song fans probably will; I enjoyed the song, though).  Ratso runs
away, after reminding the appliances that they are "too old" for the Master,
and that he only takes Lampy with him because he can "do something useful". 
Blanky makes a fuss about it, although Toaster tries to reassure everyone that
they are high closest friends.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Robby is working away on his computer, when he is interrupted by
the abrupt appearance of his assistant, Mack, who is pretty jealous about Rob
(he even wants to have Chris).  When Chris comes about, something terrible
happens:  electricity goes off for some reason, and Rob's newly completed
animal-thesis work is completely erased on the computer!  He blames the
computer for this, and he and Chris go off to fetch Charlie, who can probably
help out (after some by play the computer says that he SHOULD have saved it,
which he didn't).  This is to no avail; there is a virus affecting the computer
systems, now Rob won't be able to graduate!  Even a little reassurance from
Chris won't help.</P>
<P>At the same time, the appliances learn from Sebastian that there is a testing
laboratory where the humans there were cruel to him (so THAT explains his
broken arm!).  The appliances reassure everybody that the master will take care
of him (even though Ratso doesn't trust him).  Then, everybody goes to bed,
after a little bit of "late-night humor" from Radio.</P>
<P>Rob is still depressed about his lost file, but Chris states that his file is
just "hiding".  Rob is not any happier when she tries to use Kirby to clean up
the kitty litter (Kirby gets a sick stomach afterwards), and Chris responds by
walking out on Rob.  This is a bad day for Rob:  He's lost both his thesis AND
his girlfriend–and his RAT!  (Ratso is heading towards the basement, avoiding
stampeding rats "Hey, I'm walking here!" he shouts at them.)  Rob decides to
write a better, newer report, even if it takes him a whole day.  Mack comes by
and Rob leaves him in charge of the house.  This is a bad mistake, because Mack
plots to send the animals to the testing laboratory in exchange for money. 
"I'm so bad!" he says.</P>
<P>Lampy returns, who tells them how sad the Master is.  The appliances vow to
help out, but they don't know how to use any computers.  Sebastian helps out
("Monkey see, monkey do"), after they get him up onto the chair.  (Listen to
Radio's wisecracks during this scene, they are really funny)  The computer
comes to life, and of course, there's another enjoyable (or annoying to those
of you who hate songs) song about computer technology and the internet.  It
echoes the gospel songs in Hercules, but it's more tolerable.  After that, the
computer gets a virus (beginning to crash), and starts to show secret
passwords, one which is ANIMAL TRANSPORTATION!  They all pull out the plug just
as it crashes.  Sebastian then tells them that the animals are going to be sent
to Tartarus Laboratory, which he was talking about earlier.</P>
<P>We cut back to Rob and Chris (who has forgiven him, by the way), and we learn
that he has to retype all 612 pages (including the title page), and that he
remembers the anniversary of when he first met Chris.  Still, it's a bad day
for him.</P>
<P>It's a bad day for the animals, too, for they don't want to leave (although
I'm sure Ratso wouldn't mind).  Leave it to Toaster to think of a plan.  Ratso
mentions that he saw a malfunctioning (er, sneezing) computer in the basement. 
Mack comes by, and locks the animals in their cages (he also mentions that at
midnight tonight, they're history).  The appliances free Ratso and head to the
basement, save Kirby (he's too big to fit, and he'll be the perfect guard for
the animals).  He fails to save the animals, from Mack, however.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the appliances head to the basement where they discover the
computer, who is ancient and doing loud sneezes.  His name is Wittgenstein, and
he thinks he's useless, or outmoded (he's been down there 4,999,450,852,312
nanoseconds, ever since transistors were invented).  He explains this through a
song, which is the weakest in the film (although funny to this reviewer).  His
light bulbs break as he sings, thanks to a couple of sparks.  He also explains
that he knows of Mack's evil plan to transport the animals to the factory, and
that he had been trying to warn Rob (so THAT explains his computer crash!). 
Unfortunately, as he mentions, he is not PC compatible.  He also explains that
he's made of tubes, and that one of his tubes is busted, which is his only life
source.  Ratso and Radio set off, or rather gallop off, to find a replacement
in the camp storage supplies.  After much difficulty, they manage to find one
last tube, but they break it buy getting into a fight.  However, Wittgenstein
still manages to mention that the animals are being transmitted.  And he dies,
and Radio takes the blame; he takes out his last circuit to help Wittgenstein. 
Wittgenstein is saved, thanks to Radio's self-sacrifice, and is able to print
out a plan for the appliances (boo-boo proof), and alert the master about
Mack's plan.</P>
<P>The animals have been loaded into the truck, and Rob is after them with Chris,
while Toaster and the others chase after the truck on a table top piloted by
Kirby powered by Wittgenstein's modem.  There is a long, extended chase scene,
which of course, works out okay.  Maisie appears to be dead, but of course,
she's all right.  Ratso cries out of happiness in this scene.</P>
<P>Afterwards, the master finds Radio and tries to find a new circuit for him,
while Wittgenstein recovers Rob's thesis report and gets it printed.  The
kittens open their eyes, and Ratso is the first thing that they see!  They even
play with him.  This scene is so sweet.</P>
<P>Rob and Chris leave, secure with the fact that the animals will be taken to
well taken to new homes where they will be looked after.  Ratso comes along
with the master and mistress.  But what about Radio?  Well, his circuit is
restored to him, thanks to Chris.  By the way, Rob has also asked Chris to be
his wife.  How happier can this ending be?</P>
<P>If you think The Brave Little Toaster To The Rescue will be just as bad as The
Brave Little Toaster Goes To Mars, think again!  The exciting, emotional story
and the hilarious characters, including the show stealing ones, along with a
little more drama and action to top it all off, make this sequel good
entertainment.  Still, while not as good as The Brave Little Toaster, this 3rd
movie is pleasant enough for what it is.  And for that, I give it ***1/2 out of
*****.  Whether you want it for your collection is another question, but its
definitely one to rent, especially if you're a Toaster fan.</P>
<PRE>CONCLUSION</PRE>
<P>Both videos are splendid entertainment to come from the folks at Disney. 
Let's hope they continue to release good entertainment titles…</P>
