PG-13 (sexual situations, language)</P>
<P>The Warner Bros. logo now comes with the music of Casablanca's "As 
time goes by" aka "you must remember  this..." Wrong tune for Three 
to Tango. a would-be romantic comedy-farce. Time goes by 
interminably. And , later, you couldn't remember this flick if you 
tried.</P>
<P>The story:  Oscar (straight) and Peter (gay) are friends, architects 
and associates. They need badly a contract  with tycoon Charles, for 
a cultural center in Chicago. Most unlikely circumstances -- forced, 
reinforced by competitors, and unfunny-- make Charles believe that 
Oscar and Peter are a gay couple.</P>
<P>Married Charles has a girlfriend (mistress, in older English), glass 
sculptor Amy.who has many males flitting around her. Charles, feeling 
safe with the falsely gay Oscar, directs him to keep an eye on her. 
Desperate for the architectura; contract, Oscar plays along and 
accepts the task. And with  200 % predictability, Oscar falls for Amy 
while she, in a state of sexual confusion, falls for him. The rest is 
not, but should have been, silence.</P>
<P>The title Three to Tango is a dumb, irrelevant variant of  the 
expression "it takes two to tango." The  opening credits are an 
irrelevant  montage of jazz music (not even tango!) and boogie-woogie 
dances. The closing credits of sung jazz are irrelevant.</P>
<P>TTT is one big humus pile of irrelevancies. Its plot tries, feebly, 
to work in tolerance of gays;  it succeeds, stongly, in making them 
somewhat caricatural or indifferent at best. The overall ambiance has 
something vinegary about it.</P>
<P>Today's "celebrity" cult has reached the stupidest levels, as the 
public gorges itself with anyone who's appeared on a screen, or had 
his name in the media, her face photographed, their private lives 
mentioned in print, on the air, on voice-mail or bathroom graffiti. 
It is this public that the movie is targeting, with actors from TV.</P>
<P>One of the many weaknesses of this is that people who are not glued 
to television can hardly differentiate among the thesps. It's another 
world from that of Bogie, Errol Flynn, Wayne, Tracy, of Irene Dunne, 
Bette Davis, Kate Hepburn, or later McQueen, Hoffman, Newman, Peck 
and such. Or even from that of the many familiar faces of character 
actors in the studios' stables. There are still stars and sub-stars 
that get immediate recognition, but these are fewer and fewer as the 
performers more and more look alike, unmemorable, un-striking and 
interchangeably generic. Such is the case of the cast in TTT, with 
only Oliver Platt standing out -- and this because of a hideous beard.</P>
<P>The film advances in lead-footed steps. It is like one of those of 
those old diving suits with heavy boots that were shown in movies in 
the days before the snorkels of Captain Cousteau. The actors are 
unattractive --and so are their roles. Not one performer is above 
dumbness level, or interesting  as playerr or as character. I know 
that some people think that Neve Campbell is super-cute on TV. Could 
be, but in this film I find her and her nasal voice, unexciting.</P>
<P>The dialogue is undernourished. The attempts at humor are cheap, as 
typified by a spectacle of twin vomiting, by scenes of irrelevant, 
vague "comparses" such as Oscar's and Peter's pals who are no more 
than wooden furniture sitting on furniture. Or by a tacky metaphor of 
Oscar in Amy's workshop, blowing glass which she tries to shape.</P>
<P>Logic is one-dimensional. Why Amy finds herself falling for Oscar 
(gay or not) is a mystery, unless you decide that two such 
nonentities make a good match. Why Amy is (or was) in love with the 
insufferable Charles makes no sense. Why does free-spirit Amy who's 
moved in with Oscar (she owed rent), have to stay in the tub under a 
blanket of soap-bubbles; why she asks visiting Oscar to turn around 
when she emerges from the water; why this modesty of the bygone Code 
days; why is she incalculably less sexy than Claudette Colbert as the 
latter bathed in asses' milk in  C.B. De Mille's 1934 Cleopatra 
--these are among the many unanswerable questions.</P>
<P>I did not laugh once. Some audience members did so a number of times. 
My curiosity made me search the Internet for viewers' reactions. 
Several were enthusiastic, albeit ungrammatical -- as is Platt's "for 
Oscar and I" -- mostly because Campbell and Perry "were so hot." 
Well, I'm sure that Eskimos think it is hot when the temperature 
stands at 20 degrees F.</P>
<P>Any good spots? Perhaps, if you have a magnifying glass. No, make 
this the Mount Palomar telescope.</P>
