<PRE>                               GLADIATOR
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     "Joey, do you like movies about gladiators?"  Hey, who doesn't!?</P>
<P>     The awe-inspiring trailers for Gladiator may have you dreaming of
Spartacus and Ben-Hur, but you may be surprised to find this film in
reality a less palatable mélange of Braveheart and Mad Max: Beyond
Thunderdome.  This isn't altogether a bad thing, but those expecting a
new Roman epic that will stand the test of time (like Spartacus and
Ben-Hur) are in for some surprises.</P>
<P>     The currently hot Russell Crowe stars as Maximus, "the general who
became a slave" who begins the film as a commander so high in the
echelons of the Roman army that the aging Caesar Marcus Aurelius
(Richard Harris) hand-picks him to become the next Caesar... instead of
his own son Commodus (not pronounced Commode-us, played by Joaquin
Phoenix).</P>
<P>     Joaquin Phoenix's appearance in a movie always means trouble, and
sure enough, dad is soon dead, Commodus is Emperor, and Maximus is off
to execution.  It's a roundabout road (that lasts 150 minutes) to get
from general to slave and slave to gladiator.  From there, Maximus ends
up in Rome at the Colosseum (you know: THE Colosseum), threatening to
overthrow the Emperor and return power to the Republic.  And here we
are, 1600 years before the American Revolution.</P>
<P>     Gladiator's finest hour comes when the gladiating begins (though
this is a good 60 minutes into the picture).  And we are talking serious
carnage.  Bloodletting.  Decapitations.  People severed in two.  Dirty
fighting.  Joey would like this movie.</P>
<P>     Shot in an aggressive yet vaguely annoying chop-chop style,
Gladiator borrows heavily from the camera style Spielberg used in Saving
Private Ryan's battle scenes:  Print every other frame of film twice,
and run at regular speed.  This casts everything in a dreamlike quality,
which sometimes works in the film but gets old due to overuse and
overall poor lighting.</P>
<P>     Then there's the chit-chat of Gladiator's "plot," a threadbare bit
of political intrigue, with Commodus worried sick about Maximus's rise
to popularity via the mob crowds at the pit, Connie Nielsen's Lucilla
(Commodus's sister), also worried sick in fear that her son will be
killed... blah blah blah.  I zoned out whenever one of these weepy
people took the stage, waiting for the fighting to start again.  You
know, with the chariots!  And the tigers!</P>
<P>     There's something Jerry Springeresque about Gladiator, but Crowe
lends a lot of legitimacy to the proceedings.  Less effective is
Phoenix, who invites you to believe he is an actual Emperor of Rome.
This turns out to be impossible, as Phoenix comes across as, well, River
Phoenix's little brother.  There's also the little issue that Gladiator
stretches the boundaries of "historical fiction" to new and impossible
lengths, which almost goes without saying.  Almost.</P>
