<P>I am not sure what I expected from this feature-length version of the cult
animated series but certainly not the high-voltage blast of laughs I got from
this "redneck mountain town." South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut is a spry
surprise: a delightful, profane and inventive film guaranteed to offend, upset
and, most significantly, incite laughter from many audience members. </P>
<P>Our good old cardboard cut-out buddies, Cartman, Kyle, Stan and Kenny are back
- this time, they are giddy trying to get in to see an R-rated film called
"Asses of Fire," which stars two movie stars, Terrance and Phillip. Naturally,
they can't get in so they bribe a homeless man into buying them tickets. After
seeing the profane film, the South Park kids litter their mouths with
four-letter words and objectionable phrases galore. Their parents are outraged
and insist on causing a media stir by claiming that the movie is dangerous, and
this all results in a war with Canada and a face-to-face encounter with Satan
and Saddam Hussein!</P>
<P>"South Park" does not shy away from delivering on its promise as indicated by
the title. The movie is bigger (there's a deliciously hellish Inferno
sequence), longer (a bit too long even at eighty minutes), and uncut (and proud
of it, too). There is enough here to draw ire from all social groups concerned
with demeaning values, deteriorated morals, and bad taste in the cinema
offerings of today. In a sense, the creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone comment
on such issues by making a movie about them (apparently, they fought long and
hard with the MPAA over maintaining an R rating for this movie). This is a
great, postmodernist hook for "South Park," and it is possible that the series
could be enlivened greatly with such inventiveness. </P>
<P>There are many good jokes concerning Winona Ryder, Bill Gates, the Baldwins,
the Internet and the litter of adult websites, electric-shock V-chips,
abortion, Satan and Hussein's romp in the hay, the question of censorship,
parental responsibility versus the media's towards the young, etc. Is this a
comedy or a political film? Both, and it was smart and timely for the creators
to invest such interest in today's post-Littleton, Colorado issues. Name one
other recent film with this much political commentary.</P>
<P>"South Park" runs out of steam after a while partly due to the numerous
song-and-dance numbers (some are funnier than others). The characters are still
quite engaging (the mortal Kenny is still my favorite) and the situations are
clever and involving (the attempt to save the movie stars from possible
execution is hilarious). I may draw some ire for saying this but "South Park"
should be seen by kids under 18. It is important and addresses many issues with
wit and obscenities galore. It is a film of the times, it is about us, and it
is about how we live now. Whoever thought a cartoon could have this much
potential? </P>
