<PRE>                               THE SAINT
                       A film review by Jun Yan
                        Copyright 1997 Jun Yan</PRE>
<P>        I have not seen such an idiotic screenplay for quite a while and
therefore had a hard time adjusting to it in the first half of this movie.
What puzzles me most is that so much money was put in this totally
brainless thing, why couldn't they have written a remotely tolerable
story?!  </P>
<P>        The film starts with an unconvincing and over-the-top of the
origin of Simon the magician as an unhappy and oppressed boy in a Catholic
school.  Years later, this kid becomes not only the best "independent"
international thief around, but the most charming womanizer.  Somehow, he
gets intangled into a sticky Russian business to steal a cold fusion
formula from the beautiful physicist at Oxford.  The bad guys want the
formula and the girl, so does the Saint.  You can guess the rest.  </P>
<P>        Both Val Kilmer and Elizabeth Shue are good-looking people and
dedicated actors, which made their presence on the screen all the more
comical and ridiculous.  I'm not saying scientists cannot be cute blond
young women, but Shue's Emma Russell was so silly and neurotic that could
not pass for a high school freshman girl who desperately tries to fit in.
Her insecurity was so severe that I suspect she realized very clearly how
far her performance was from a real scientist.  The script did not help at
all.  All her speeches about her scientific breakthrough were so
completely stupid that it was just laughable.  Surrounded by all the high
tech toys carried by Val Kilmer (which were not that impressive anyway),
guess where she hid her secret formulas that might solve the energy
problems of the whole world?  They were written on 6 small pieces of paper
and she hid them in her bra!!!  Wow.  She's truly an "old fashioned" girl,
isn't she?                         </P>
<P>        It must have been great fun for Kilmer to switch from one disguise
to another and from terrible British accent to stumbling Russian English.
But the problem is the same as that facing the hero Simon -- sometimes he
was lost as to who he was playing and what disguise to use.  In quite a
few occasions, he appeared to be just as confused as the audience.  </P>
<P>        The portrait of Russia and villains in this movie were totally
ridiculous and implausible as well as the plot.  It's even hard to enjoy
it as a totally bogus fantasy because it seemed to take itself quite
seriously.  The special effects and stunts were just as crude and childish
as the story.  The characters were worse than cartoonish -- they were
dumber than the Jim Carey/Jeff Daniels duo!  There was no chemistry
between them and the relationship was in the least bit touching or
convincing.  I can hardly believe how poor the quality is in every
aspect of this movie.  It's degrading and insulting to Russian people,
scientists, and any viewer who has half a brain.  </P>
<P>        The only two good things about this film were the beautiful views
of Europe and the physical appeal of Kilmer, who was terribly good-looking
here (which you can hardly miss with such a self-indulging performance).
I read somewhere that Kilmer's an extrememly intelligent guy.  Well, I
guess one can't believe everything s/he reads.  </P>
<P>        "The Saint" is like a big, stupid joke that pretends to be
intelligent and stylish.  What can be worse than that?  I'm glad I didn't
pay $7 for this crap.  No choice but to give it an F. </P>
