<P>>From the creators of the creepy SHALLOW GRAVE (8/10) and the great
TRAINSPOTTING (8.5/10) movies, comes A LIFE LESS ORDINARY. This movie
is, well, if you don't mind me saying so...a little less than ordinary.</P>
<P>PLOT: 
The plot has Robert getting fired from a corporate heartless company,
kidnapping the daughter (Celine) of said firm almost involuntarily,
hitting the road with the whining spoiled brat, and being sought after
by two "angels" sent down by Gabriel the Saint, who are supposed to
attempt a love connection between the polar opposite pair.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE: 
Nothing special here. The plot line is pretty thin and unoriginal. The
ending is all but given away by the poster of the film itself. The lame
angels, played surprisingly by Delroy Lindo and Holly Hunter, are
annoyances more than anything. Even Danny Boyle's most original style
seems to have taken a back seat
here. And to think that he turned down the fourth installment of the
ALIEN series for this shite.</P>
<P>Overall, I did not care about either of the characters enough to get
into the movie one bit. Some scenes were semi-funny (when Robert is
calling in the ransom request), there's a bit of style in the first ten
minutes or so but then it disappears, the soundtrack is pretty slick,
and the acting is passable, but overall
the movie just didn't have enough originality or drive to muster any
kind of enthusiasm from this big Danny Boyle fan (and that's saying a
lot).</P>
<P>Oh yeah, I almost forgot the best part of the movie which takes place
during the closing credits. A claymation rendition of the couple
travelling through their adventures is much more interesting than
anything in this entire picture. </P>
<P>Little Known Facts: 
Ewan McGregor has starred in all three of Danny Boyle's feature films.
John Hodge has written all three of Danny Boyle's feature films.
Andrew McDonald has produced all three of Danny Boyle's feature films.
Ewan McGregor will play the young Obi-Wan Kenobi in the prequel to the
STAR WARS series.
Holly Hunter stands 5"2, and once shared a house (on and off) with
directors Joel Coen and Sam Raimi, writer/producer Ethan Coen and
fellow actresses Frances McDormand and Kathy Bates.<HR>Visit JoBlo's Movie Reviews
