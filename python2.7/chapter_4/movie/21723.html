<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>This delightful indie one-up of Anywhere But Here features better acting
leads and a slightly meatier, more realistic story.  Like the Susan
Sarandon/Natalie Portman vehicle, Tumbleweeds features a single mother
and her teenage daughter leaving a small rural town to find their
fortune in Southern California.  They even pick furniture out of rich
folks' trash, too.</P>
<P>In Anywhere, the Augusts' departure from Bay City, Wisconsin was a
well-planned move about which friends and family knew.  In Tumbleweeds,
the Walkers' move from West Virginia literally happens in the middle of
the night.  Mother Mary Jo (Janet McTeer, Wuthering Heights) has a
knock-down/drag-out her current boyfriend while screaming for asthmatic
daughter Ava (Kimberly J. Brown, The Guiding Light) to pack up her
things.  No stranger to midnight uprooting, Ava quickly stuffs her
belongings into a bag and the duo hit the road in a car with both broken
head and taillights.</P>
<P>Although she seems a bit scatterbrained, Mary Jo has a plan.  An old
high school sweetheart in Missouri (or `Misery,' according to Ava) with
an automobile dealership has extended an open invitation to Mary Jo, who
envisions a better life of lavish extravagance and new cars.  But things
don't work out quite as nicely as she planned, so Mary Jo and Ava take
off again, aiming their beat-up vehicle towards the Golden State.  Ava
wants to head for San Diego, which they do despite Mary Jo's fears that
it will fall into the ocean.</P>
<P>Mary Jo has a pattern of bailing instantly at the first sign of failure,
leaving a trail of bad jobs and awful relationships with pathetic men.
She is also the type that falls in love with anyone that makes eye
contact with her.  Her intentions are good but not always well thought
through, as Mary Jo often puts her daughter's life secondary to her own
affairs of the heart.</P>
<P>With a mother as crazy Mary Jo, Ava seems even more jaded and discontent
than Anywhere's princess-y Portman, which makes her character than much
more effective and sympathetic.  She seeks stability and a father
figure, wanting to stay in one place long enough to establish roots in
school and develop normal relationships with her peers.  Ava's greatest
fear is that Mom will want to book town before her big role in the
school's production of Romeo & Juliet.</P>
<P>Written and directed by Gavin O'Connor (Comfortably Numb), Tumbleweeds
offers a glut of wacky characters, from Mary Jo's perverted boss to her
quirky co-worker that enjoys coffee enemas.  But the film is still a
very touching and very realistic portrayal of a relationship between an
idealistic mother and her levelheaded daughter.  The Tony Award-winning
McTeer is British, which makes her brilliant turn as a Southern belle
who grew up way too quickly all the more impressive.  Her Oscar-worthy
performance is as good as any you will see this year.  The precocious
Brown is nearly as good, creating an extraordinarily convincing
pragmatic character.</P>
<P>1:44 - PG-13 for adult language, adult situations and a scene of
domestic discord</P>
