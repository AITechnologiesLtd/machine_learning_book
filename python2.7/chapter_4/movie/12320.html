I just added the first installments of an idiotic film journal.
Don't forget to recommend a movie in the 'Can't Miss' section!)</P>
<P>I'm pooping on my own party here: THE BIG HIT lifted my spirits in a
way I didn't expect it to. Honestly, I didn't
expect it to lift my spirits at all, on the basis of the trailer (next
time, preview-copy writers, please refrain from trumpeting 'by the
creators
of Broken Arrow') and a general wariness of '90s hitman-chic: though I
sort of liked THE BIG HIT, one more movie
about loveable "cleaners" and I'll be psychotically climbing a
Hollywood water tower or two. THE BIG HIT,
despite being choice time-filler/killer, is a bit too self-aware
of--yet not clever enough in handling--its own
fashionably ironic core to be recommended.</P>
<P>Wahlberg stars as Melvin Smiley, ostensibly the leader of a team of
assassins who so wants to be universally
adored that he lets people walk all over him between jobs: a cohort
(Phillips), wrongfully claims Smiley's bonus pay,
and Smiley doesn't object; one of his girlfriends (Lela Rochon) is
practically extorting him to support her own illicit
affair; another girlfriend (Christina Applegate) invites her obnoxious
parents down for the weekend against his
wishes. Eventually, Smiley's insecurity makes him the target of
someone else's fix: in agreeing to look after
Phillips' kidnap victim (the adorable Chow-- mayhaps it's the private
school uniform), his own boss--the victim's
godfather--orders Smiley dead.</P>
<P>The script for THE BIG HIT plays as if it was written by a sixteen
year old. One hitman (Bokeem Woodbine)
explains that he only discovered masturbation in his twenties, and a
running gag has him constantly flexing and
pumping the muscles of his right arm. An old Chinese businessman has
lost his life-savings financing the most
expensive film ever made: a trashy drama written, directed by, and
starring himself, entitled, amusingly, "Taste
The Golden Spray". The shooting and fighting sequences--and everything
in between-- essentially satirize the
hokiest Hong Kong action movies, but without subtlety or focus. Asian
directors such as John Woo, Ringo Lam, et.
al, ushered an era into their homeland: rendering virtually all their
characters expendable, they rediscovered
the poetry in a gun-battle not seen since the heyday of Sam Peckinpah.
The copycats, the bubble-gum wacky killers
on the lam movies are what THE BIG HIT more closely resembles--
rather, parodies--and only one scene really
stands out as genuinely sharp: a Mexican stand-off, recently fodder
for the likes of Eastern-inspired Tarantino,
here takes place at a kosher dinner, with drunken Elliot Gould
vomiting on the killers between rounds.</P>
<P>Most Jackie Chan movies are crowd-pleasers precisely because they
simultaneously send- up the Martial Arts
genre yet stand out as fine examples from it. THE BIG HIT features a
few ridiculous, choppy gunfights and an
immature script to connect the scenes. Had it been either more
action-packed or intelligent, it would amount to
more than just spoofing and riffing. As it is, the performances are
engaging, and it's fast-paced enough, but a big hit
I suspect it will not be.</P>
