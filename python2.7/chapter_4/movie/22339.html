Liberty Heights</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>A warm fuzzy film with a touch of blues for realism. Great script,
beautifully shot, and nicely acted. I especially enjoyed the quirky
friendship between the confident older Jewish brother and the rich daredevil
James-Dean-type gentile.</P>
<P>But there's other interesting story lines of equal importance including the
younger Jewish brother and the well-to-do "colored" girl from school. "Hi,
I'm Ben, I'm in your homeroom."</P>
<P>Set in 1954, the film holds true to the period.</P>
