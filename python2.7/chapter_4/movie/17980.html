<P>"The Other Sister" (1999) - Diane Keaton, Juliette Lewis, Giovanni Ribisi</P>
<P>        "The Other Sister" features Juliette Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi
playing characters with unspecified mental disabilities. Since this has
little bearing on the fact that it's a very good movie, it will only be
mentioned twice more during this review.</P>
<P>In part, "The Other Sister" is about a character most of us can
relate to: the overprotective parent, in the form of Diane Keaton. Lewis
has spent most of her life away from home at a boarding school, but
finally comes home. She has to re-adjust to her sisters ("a dedicated
underachiever and a gay workaholic," quips Keaton), her parents, a new
school, a whole new environment.</P>
<P>Keaton thinks she knows what's best for all her daughters, while
her more laid-back husband (Tom Skerritt) is generally willing to let them
make their own mistakes.</P>
<P>Lewis and Ribisi, both outcasts of a sort, meet and go through all
the traditional courting rituals, right down to a Halloween dance at their
trade school (where the always-ambitious Lewis is studying to become a
veterinary assistant).</P>
<P>That's right, it's a love story. That means it's bright, generally
cheerful, and we all know how it ends. It's also very well done, invoking
only a few of the cliches inherent to the genre. The unique nature of the
leads' roles even allows humor in some surprising places (watch for the
"sex talk," the ongoing references to "The Graduate," or the comic-erotic
use of marching band music).</P>
<P>"The Other Sister" is blatantly formulaic, from the requisite
overbearing parent to the "falling in love" montage. But everyone on
screen practically oozes charm, such that when the expected complication
in the relationship comes up, we know on a gut level that everything will
be alright.</P>
<P>Matching the positive mood of the movie, the technical credits are
about two notches above average. Visually, the film is as bright as its
irrepressible characters, and the soundtrack, featuring everyone from
Savage Garden to Alison Krauss, is similarly uplifting without being
obtrusive.</P>
<P>In fact, it's hard to find anything even remotely depressing
happening on-screen. This movie is uber-cheerful, making it almost
impossible to not like it. It somehow pulls this off without making it
obvious that it's happening.</P>
<P>"The Other Sister" was made by Touchstone Pictures, a part of
Disney. So it's not unfair to say that its depiction of mental retardation
is about as accurate as "Aladdin's" depiction of the Middle East. But this
is the only real failing in an otherwise excellent movie. This sin, while
arguably a large one, can be forgiven since the rest of the movie is so
darned uplifting.</P>
