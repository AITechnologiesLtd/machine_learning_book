<PRE>                       WE'RE BACK! A DINOSAUR'S STORY
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1993 Scott Renshaw</PRE>

<P>     For the first time in several years, Disney does not have a new
animated release for the holidays, as The House the Mouse Built instead
readies THE LION KING for summer 1994.  Into that void steps WE'RE
BACK! A DINOSAUR'S STORY, hoping to rake up some of the family
entertainment dollars now available for the taking.  If I didn't know
how long animation takes to produce, I'd swear Universal had thrown it
together in a few months just for that purpose.  WE'RE BACK is sadly
uninspired kiddie fare, perhaps moderately diverting for elementary
schoolers but likely to be a tedious 70 minutes for their parents.</P>
<P>     WE'RE BACK is the story of four dinosaurs subjected to a unique
experiment by time-traveling scientist Captain NewEyes (voice of Walter
Cronkite).  Rex the Tyrannosaurus rex (John Goodman), Elsa the
pterodactyl (Felicity Kendal), Woog the triceratops (Rene Levant) and
Dweeb the apatosaurus (Charles Fleischer) are all given an
intelligence-enhancing grain and invited to the future to fulfill the
wishes of children who want to see a real dinosaur.  They agree, and
find themselves in modern day New York where they meet two lonely
kids:  cocky Louie (Joey Shea) and poor-little-rich-girl Cecilia
(Yeardley Smith).  They also meet Captain NewEyes' evil brother
Professor ScrewEyes (Kenneth Mars), whose scary circus threatens both
children and dinosaurs.</P>
<P>     From a story standpoint, WE'RE BACK is a mess.  It seems to
have no idea what it wants to be--fast paced adventure, goofy comedy,
dark mood piece--so it throws a little bit of everything into the stew
in the hope that something will work.  But the chase sequences are only
interesting thanks to gut-churning computer effects, the comedy is limp
and the scarier segments, which are the best, come far too late.  There
is even an attempt at a musical production number, a lively enough
James Horner-Thomas Dolby composition called "Roll Back the Rock," but
it strains so hard to be charming that it's an effort to watch.  The
schizophrenic tone is not necessarily a problem for a 7-year-old
attention span, but the lack of continuity gave me a headache.</P>
<P>     Visually, the film fares only slightly better.  The prehistoric
setting is appropriately gloomy, but we only see it for about a
minute.  Most of the film takes place in a New York colored in oranges
and golds, and it's just not at all interesting to look at.  Professor
ScrewEyes' circus is dark and creepy, but it is a real missed
opportunity.  Directors Dick and Ralph Zondag could have gone for a
real PINOCCHIO-style funhouse of frights, but they just let the circus
sit there full of unexplored potential.  They manage to pull out one
truly arresting image, involving a flock of crows, but the film is
almost over by that time.  Nothing in WE'RE BACK captures the eye or
the imagination.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the fatal flaw in WE'RE BACK is a collection of characters
which might almost scrape together a personality between them.  Disney
built its empire on carefully created and memorably performed
characters, but screenwriter John Patrick Shanley turns in as bland a
bunch as I can imagine.  John Goodman does a half-hearted Bing Crosby
impression as the affable Rex, Charles Fleischer simply recycles Roger
Rabbit as Dweeb, and Felicity Kendal and Rene Levant are each thrown a
token character trait as the other dinosaurs.  Walter Cronkite and
Julia Child seem to be present only for the novelty of doing trademark
lines to animation, and Jay Leno is genuinely annoying as Captain
NewEyes' alien sidekick.  The kids are not bad, nicely performed by
Joey Shea and "The Simpsons'" Yeardley Smith, but the only real fun
comes from Martin Short as a frustrated clown in the scary circus.  His
antics are as random as everything else, but at least they were funny.</P>
<P>     As if the slipshod Disney knockoffs (the contract signing from THE
LITTLE MERMAID, zoom-ins on the wide-eyed heroine) weren't bad enough,
WE'RE BACK gives in to insipid moralizing.  Uncle Walt had more respect
for kids than that.  It's too bad when parents' only matinee options
are as monotonous as WE'RE BACK.  Better to rent FREE WILLY again.</P>
<PRE>     Or wait for THE LION KING ... seven months and counting.</PRE>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 dino-snores:  3.</PRE>
