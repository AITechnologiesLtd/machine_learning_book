<P>HAPPY TOGETHER
 By Harvey Karten, Ph.D.
 Kino International/Golden Harvest
 Director:  Wong Kar-wai
 Writer:  Wong Kar-wai
 Cast: Leslie Cheung, Tony Leung Chiu-wai, Chang Chen
   Immersion in another culture can work differently for
different people.  For some, the experience is broadening, for
others constricting.  For some, the ordeals are invigorating, for
others, enervating.  Heinrich Herrar, Brad Pitt's character in
"Seven Years in Tibet," changed from a narcissistic Nazi to a
Buddhist mensch with a deep regard for a culture of
nonviolence during his trip from Austria to Lhasa.  But Lai
Yiu-Fai (Tony Leung Chiu-Wai) and Ho Po-Wing (Leslie
Cheung), at best have mixed reactions from their expatriate
life in Argentina.  At worst, they grow so bored and lonely that
they become desperate for meaning.  "Happy Together," a
somewhat ironic title, deals loosely with an off-on relationship
of Lai and Ho, a homosexual pair from Hong Kong living in
Argentina.  The picture bears the signature of its independent
director, Wong Kar-Wai, whose "Chungking Express" deals as
well with lovesickness, obsession, and the peccadilloes of
relationships in a modern world.  Like that 1994 film, "Happy
Together" is light and offbeat with much activity centered on
restaurants, though instead of dividing his film into two
tangentially related stories, director Wong this time simply
brings in a third character midway into the tale.  The
homosexual element, which caused the films to be banned in
some Far Eastern states, is soft-pedaled, though a sizzling
and comic scene which opens the movie announces the
relationship of its principals in no uncertain terms.
   The $4.2 million release has no plot to speak of but is
instead an existential, even postmodern take on the difficulties
which people have in sustaining a connection.  Lai (Tony
Leung Chiu-Wai) and Ho (Leslie Cheung), two travelers from
Hong Kong, are on their way to the mystical Iguazu Falls on
the Argentine-Brazilian border, a symbol of renewal much as
the red rocks of Sedona, Arizona are a drawing point for New
Age folks in the States.  Symbolically, they get lost on the
way, ultimately leading a major argument and their going
separate ways.  Though Ho comes across at first as a
confident, frivolous fellow, he surfaces as the one who is hurt
more by the detachment than the serious Lai.  Lai takes a dull
job as a doorman at a tango bar while Ho hires himself out as
a hustler.  Spending a good deal of time trying to patch up
the bond, Ho is finally welcomed back by Lai when he
appears at Lai's door after having been beaten up by a client. 
Strangely enough, though, there is no sex in the new
affiliation, though Lai has become fonder of Ho than ever
before, even hiding his passport to make sure he does not go
home.  
   Midway, director Wong introduces Chang, who works in a
kitchen with Lai.  Though Chang is straight and naive, the two
become fast friends, but when Chang leaves for his home in
Taipei, Lai faces his own desire to leave the Spanish culture
for his native Hong Kong.
   In the film's seminal shot, cinematographer Christopher
Doyle sums up the experience of living as an expatriate by
showing Hong Kong as an upside-down city in the eyes of the
travelers who are, in effect, on the opposite side of the world. 
This visual says reams about the effect of living in a culture
not ones own and goes a way toward explaining why
immigrants everywhere, however prosperous, often talk with
longing of their "country."  
   Given the near-invisibility of plot, what gives the film its
staying power is Mr. Doyle's startling photography . Using
high-contrast film and shifting regularly from black-and-white
to color, Doyle tries his darndest to keep us involved even
when the circular activity threatens to exhaust the audience. 
There's a terrific closing sequence as Lai rides Taipei's newly-
built rapid transit, contrasting effectively with the remoteness
he feels when he visits "the end of the world" in Argentina's
Tierra del Fuego.  The movie will appeal to those who can
accept that its kicks come from the optics rather than the
narrative, but it likely to be off-putting to a constituency who
may wander into it thinking that "Happy Together" is a gay
film and to straights who may wonder what the fuss is about. 
Not Rated.  Running Time: 93 minutes.  (C) 1997 Harvey
