<P>THE WINSLOW BOY (G).  
(Columbia Tristar)
Director: David Mamet
Stars: Nigel Hawthorne, Rebecca Pidgeon, Jeremy Northam, Gemma Jones, Guy 
Edwards, Matthew 
Pidgeon, Colin Stinton, Aden Gillett, Sarah Flind, Alan Polanski
Running time: 110 minutes.</P>
<P>In 1912, The Winslow family is shattered when their 13 year
old son Ronnie (Guy Edwards) is expelled from naval college after
being convicted of stealing a five pound postal note.  His father
Arthur (Nigel Hawthorne) believes in his innocence and is prepared to
gamble the family's reputation and wealth on establishing his
innocence and righting an obvious injustice.  He hires Sir Robert
Morton (Jeremy Northam, from Emma, etc), one of the country's leading
attorneys, to fight the legal battle.</P>
<P>While the trial is at the centre of the film, the court room
action itself takes place off screen.  This gently paced but incisive
drama concentrates on exploring the effects the trial and the public
notoriety has on this very proper wealthy family.  The Winslow Boy is
also a discreet romance, as the film explores the slowly attraction
that develops between Morton and Catherine (Rebecca Pidgeon), Arthur's
independent minded, suffragette daughter.</P>
<P>Terence Rattigan's 1940's play, based upon a real life trial
that shook up pre-war England, would seem like unusual material for
director David Mamet, the most contemporary of American playwrights.
Mamet is best known for his acerbic and hard hitting explorations of
the American dream turned sour (Glengarry Glen Ross, etc) rather than
sedately paced period pieces.  However, he directs with unusual and
unexpected restraint and insight - and there's not a harsh four letter
word in sight.</P>
<P>The performances from the ensemble cast are all uniformly
flawless.  Hawthorne has rarely been better, and is excellent in a
seemingly tailor made role as the prickly, but determined and
surprisingly sympathetic patriarch.  Pidgeon (Mamet's wife, also seen
in the recent The Spanish Prisoner) delivers an understated
performance that succinctly captures the passion and essence of her
enlightened character.  Northam brings a quiet strength and dignity to
his role as the lawyer who challenges many of the accepted precepts of
British justice.</P>
<P>This beautiful and intelligently crafted film has class
stamped all over it.  More importantly though, it also has a sense of
passion and warmth that seems to be missing from the period films from
the Merchant Ivory team.  Mamet's meticulous attention to the period
detail beautifully recreates Edwardian London, and Benoit Delhomme's
cinematography is simply sumptuous.</P>
