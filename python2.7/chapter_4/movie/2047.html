<PRE>Review:                The Muse        </PRE>
<P>Starring:        Albert Brooks, Sharon Stone, Andie MacDowell, Jeff Bridges, etc.</P>
<PRE>Directed by:        Albert Brooks</PRE>
<PRE>Review by:        Joy Wyse, the SILVER Screen Critic</PRE>
<P>According to the dictionary, a Muse is one of nine nymphs generally
represented as young, beautiful, and modest virgins, distinguished as the
peculiar protectresses of the fine and liberal arts.  There is another
definition: A loophole; a means of escape.  I'm not sure which definition
applies here.</P>
<P>This is certainly an Albert Brooks film.  He stars in it.  He directed
it.  And, he wrote it with Monica Johnson.   I'm surprised that he didn't
try to portray the Muse, as well.  Luckily, he didn't because Sharon Stone
gives a delightful performance as the title character.  Is Sarah really a
Muse?   Is she a lunatic who imagines she is a Muse?  Is she a con artist
pretending to be a Muse?   To Steven Phillips (Brooks) and all the other
`blocked' writers who cross her path, is she a gift or an albatross?  I
got the feeling that Jeff Bridges, as writer Jack Warrick, was `palming'
her off to his pal, Steven, so that he could get out from under the
expense of satisfying her costly and unrealistic demands.  Bridges (and
his character) deserved much more screen time.  Steven's wife, Laura,
(McDowell) is justifiably amazed that her husband can be so gullible and
is unbelievably tolerant of his behavior.  However, the bedroom scene
between the two women is one of the funniest of the movie.</P>
<P>The numerous cameos throughout the film were wonderful but they lost
their impact when they were showed over and over in the television
previews.  Although the rating is PG-13, it's not a movie for youngsters,
because they wouldn't enjoy it, not even with the brief nude scene that
gives it that rating.  I probably won't even watch it again when it gets
to television.   I'm being generous giving it a C.</P>
