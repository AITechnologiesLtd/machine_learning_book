<P>     CAMP STORIES manages the extremely difficult task of making 1993's 
dumb comedy-drama INDIAN SUMMER look intelligent, thoughtful, and 
original.  This inept coming-of-age story is easily the worst camp film 
ever filmed -- and I'm not forgetting about the abysmal MEATBALLS 
series.  At least those movies never made a pretense of being anything 
other than bad.  CAMP STORIES seems to think that having a moral makes 
it somehow worthwhile, when, in fact, it's close to  unwatchable.  And 
I'm not sure who the intended audience is:  viewers under twelve will be 
bored out their minds; viewers over that age would need a frontal 
lobotomy not to be insulted by what passes for a plot.</P>
<P>     It's the summer of 1958 (somehow, writer/director Herbert Beigel 
must have missed the fact that the '90s are reviving the '70s, not the 
'50s), and high school student David Katz (Zachary Taylor) is hoping to 
spend the next eight weeks sitting in his local movie theater, watching 
daily matinees.  Like any true film buff, he doesn't mind viewing FROM 
HERE TO ETERNITY several dozen times.  Unfortunately, his parents have 
other ideas.  They ship him off to Camp Ararat, near Stroudsburg, 
Pennsylvania.  It's an orthodox Jewish camp that helps transform 
children into responsible adults by eliminating all possible sources of 
pleasure from their lives.  </P>
<P>     There's a power struggle going on among the camp's leaders.  Shlomo 
(Jerry Stiller), the camp's founder, is on death's doorway, and has to 
hand Ararat over to one of two men:  the meek and kindhearted Moshe 
(Paul Sand) or the hard-hearted disciplinarian, Chiram (Ted Marcoux).  
David, who is viewed by Moshe as a "good kid", but by Chiram as a 
troublemaker, becomes a pawn in their low-key battle.</P>
<P>     Not only is the plot muddled and paced worse than a snail race, 
it's essentially one lame cliche piled atop of another.  We have the 
usual camp friendships and rivalries, the detested leader, the secret 
girlfriend, etc.  It's all very familiar and executed with alarming 
ineptitude.  Nothing in this story is remotely interesting, especially 
since it's child's play to guess everything that's going to happen.  And 
the poor writing isn't just limited to plot details -- the dialogue is 
stilted and insipid.  It's hard to believe that any actor would be 
caught dead saying some of these lines.</P>
<P>     Then again, most of these actors give performances worthy of a 
corpse.  The only one who's even adequate is Zachary Taylor.  Everyone 
else, from recognizable names like Elliot Gould to no-namers like Kris 
Park, either shows no evidence of acting talent or doesn't care enough 
to do more than what's required to take home a paycheck.  It's 
embarrassing to watch these performers stumble through their one-
dimensional roles.</P>
<P>     There are other problems with CAMP STORIES, including the music and 
cinematography, both of which border on awful.  In fact, there's nothing 
that this film does even remotely well.  Herbert Beigel probably had 
good intentions -- tell a story about being true to oneself -- but the 
execution is unspeakably poor.  At one point, David comments that his 
life is "like a bad movie."  Unfortunately, we don't need him to tell us 
what's perfectly obvious.</P>
