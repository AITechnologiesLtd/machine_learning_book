<PRE>Chan and Chan again
Twin Dragons</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>We stereotype Kung Fu plots as contrived excuses to display a lot of cool
martial arts fighting scenes. Oddly, I felt that "Twin Dragons" showed off a
lot of cool fight scenes as an excuse to display a good plot. Yeah, I was
really into the story. I didn't expect that from Jackie. The fight scenes,
though way cool, even seemed to distract me at times.</P>
<P>The black and white opening sequence embodies the humor and action we've
come to expect from the adorable Jackie Chan. It quickly depicts the "twins
separated at birth" story.</P>
<P>One Jackie grows up on the streets as kind of a nice guy thug; the other
Jackie having the privilege of a loving rich family becomes a turtlenecked
artist/composer/conductor type. Midway, the twins' lives intercept as they
find themselves trying to live the life of the other -- and kissing the
wrong women too. It's as cleverly coordinated as his stunts and charmingly
compelling to boot!</P>
<P>The only major flaw is a lull created by a rather typical "pre-climax" fight
scene. The real "climax" fight scene that followed it would have been plenty
for me. Still, a great time over all.</P>
<P>Starring Jackie Chan and Jackie Chan.
Directed by Tsui Hark and Ringo Lam.
Produced by Teddy Robin at Dimension/Distant Horizon/Media Asia.
Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>Grade..........................A-</P>
