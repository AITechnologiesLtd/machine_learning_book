<PRE>IN SHORT: For da boys.</PRE>
<P>Three out of four ex-girlfriends would have sent murderous stares my way
after watching The Whole Nine Yards, to which I would have calmly
replied, "Hey, I sit through Ralph Fiennes flix for you . . ." (you can
figure out who the RF equivalent was fifteen years back. My brain
doesn't work that good).</P>
<P>At least, at the screening I attended, all the laughter came from the
guys. All the bewildered looks, on the way out, came from the ladies.
For this flick is a another sort of comedic spin off a mob movie genre,
with Bruce Willis parading that sort of smirk that passes for a smile
when he tries to be funny. Don't mistake me, he is funny . . . in a sort
of straight man way opposite co-star Matthew Perry (of teevee's
Friends), who pratfalls and double-takes his way through all the best
gags.</P>
<P>Make no mistake, this is a funny movie in which almost every character
wants another character dead. Sometimes more than one. Everyone, that
is, except for Perry, who spends most of his time trying to figure out
how to keep the killing from happening. Without giving too much of a
convoluted story away, these are the players:</P>
<P>Jimmy Jones aka Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski (Willis), a contract killer
who has just settled into a suburban Montreal home. Tudeski is on the
run from Chicago mob boss Janni Gogolak (Kevin Pollak), Gogolak's
enforcer Frankie Figs (Michael Clarke Duncan). His neighbor is a Chicago
born dentist, Nicholas "Oz" Oseransky (Perry) and his Canadien born wife
Sophie (Rosanna Arquette). Sophie is, to be kind, a bitch who won't give
her husband a divorce until she bleeds him dry.</P>
<P>Oz recognizes the hitman. The wife packs him off to Chicago to find the
mobster and arrange a "finder's fee" for turning The Tulip over. Oz has
no intention of tracking down Gogolak but, through circumstances
unknown, Gogolak finds him.</P>
<P>Which brings us to The Tulip's unhappy not-ex Cynthia (Natasha
Henstridge), a permanent "guest" on the Gogolak estate. Cynthia is
considered disposable by both her host and her hubby because, and you
know it always comes down to the money, at stake is a bank account with
$10 millions in it. Finally, there's Oz' cute and perky receptionist
Jill (Amanda Peet) whose character offers the biggest, and funniest,
surprise of the bunch.</P>
<P>The Whole Nine Yards is like a kitchen sink of what's been funny before.
There are the occasional fart and other bodily function gags; a frenetic
pace and judicious nudity; some horrible accents (especially Arquette,
though her exaggeration may be part of the joke); some big surprises
from the characters -- who they really are and why they do what they do.
It is an in one ear and out the other, simple comedy. Matthew Perry's
pratfalls hold it all together and, as I wrote up top, make it work for
us guys.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to The Whole Nine Yards, he would have
paid...</P>
<PRE>$5.50</PRE>
<P>Dateflick. The Whole Nine Yards is Fairly Painless in the theater and a
sure winner for beer bashes, when it hits vid.</P>
