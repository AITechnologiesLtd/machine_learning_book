<PRE>The Thin Red Line</PRE>
<P>_The Thin Red Line_ is a war film, based on the series of events that
led to the takeover of the island of Guadecanal.  It has an all-star
cast, an epic running time, many intermingling stories, and stunning
cinematography.  The film+s strengths are that it is stunningly
beautiful, and that it is deeply philosophical.  It+s weakness is an
incoherence that starts slow, and builds throughout the film.</P>
<P>If I have been slow in reviewing this film, here+s why:  For the longest
time I+ve waited for it to hit my area.  Now that I+ve seen it, my only
desire is to see it again.</P>
<P>Usually, that would be a blurb of great praise.  Not here.  I would want
to see it again so that maybe then, I would "get it."  It seems to be
very poetic, very visual, very philosophical, deeply complicated, and
too abstract.</P>
<P>But it+s not fair for me to criticize the film for going over my head at
points.  It+s not fair for me to complain that I could not keep up with
the rhythm of Terence Malick+s direction.  He may have made it a little
harder to follow, a little less dumbed down, but I wasn+t bored. (Okay,
I was bored a little towards the very end).</P>
<P>The film isn+t overtly graphic like _Saving Private Ryan_, but there are
some strong violent moments.  It+s more concerned with the deeper,
underlying issues of man versus nature.  Of man in a tribal state, being
more peaceful than the "civilized" counterpart.  There+s one phenomenal
image where a tribesman walks through the bushes, totally oblivious to
the infantry walking towards him.</P>
<P>There are many of these phenomenal images.  The only thing that is
lacking is the glue of a concrete story.  But it+s not that the story
doesn+t exist.  The story takes on many forms, affects many characters,
and doesn+t assume that we need to have it all explained for us.  It+s
not conventional, it+s not Hollywood, and it+s not dull.  I could only
hope that repeated viewings will improve my moviegoing experience.</P>
