<P>   "Under the Skin" is more likely than not to get under yours. 
The low-budget indie is by Carine Adler, known for TV scripts
for Britain's Channel Four and for the movie "Fever" starring
Katrin Cartlidge.  The picture features a thoroughly
professional use of hand-held camera with frequent jump
shots, sudden lunges, contrasting imagery of bright and clear
city with dank, dissolute back alleys, an understated sound
track of disco and classical music, and best of all a radiant
performance by the nineteen-year-old Samantha Morton in a
challenging role.</P>
<P>   Writer-director Adler forgoes the complexities of plot in favor
of a psychological study, but does not forget to throw in ample
suspense, unpredictability, and the ambiance of the English
city of Liverpool where it was shot.  Ms. Morton inhabits the
role of Iris, who resents the preference of her mother (Rita
Tushingham) for sister Rose (Claire Rushbrook) and, being
relatively ignored at home, she is lonely and hungry for
conversation from the men whom she meets.  When her mom
dies and is cremated mere weeks after being diagnosed with
an aggressive brain tumor, Iris seems unable to grieve, a
process which scripter Adler obviously believes is important
before a survivor can get on with her life.  Her incapacity to
feel sorrow leads her to nurse a steadily rising repressed
anger, which she takes out mostly via a series of desperate
sexual encounters--much to the regret of her pregnant, stable,
middle-class sister and her sister's reliable husband, Frank
(Mark Womack).</P>
<P>   The picture falters only when Adler recalls the mother in a
brief episode of magic realism, but the director more than
compensates for showing off Ms. Morton in a riveting
performance.  Her melancholy is so visceral that she may well
tempt the movie audience to call out with the most
understandable advice--that she stop her promiscuous
behavior and simply sit in her room until she can make her
peace with her anguish.  Such counsel, however, would
deprive us of surveying her episodes with a variety of men,
from her fairly boring boyfriend Gary (Matthew Delamere) who
would rather study than talk to her to the handsomest, Tom
(Stuart Townsend), who easily dispatches her to the ecstasy
she seeks, to one particular sleazeball who humiliates her
after repeating the words that should alert anyone in her right
mind, "Trust me."</P>
<P>   Doubtless it was Morton's performance that allowed this
movie to devour the competition from eighteen others at the
Edinburgh festival where it won the Michael Powell Award for
Best British Feature though it cost a mere one million dollars. 
The film is delightfully freighted with heavy sensuality, some
deadpan comedy, and a character whose loneliness should
strike a chord in all of us--as none in the audience is likely to
be a complete stranger to its anguish.  Not Rated.  Running
time: 85 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten 1998</P>
