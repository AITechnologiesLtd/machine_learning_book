<PRE>                           GOJIRA (1954)
                  A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This is the original film that
          started the series almost fifty years old.  It
          also surprises by being a fairly intelligent
          look at some very serious themes.  Certainly it
          is the most adult of any monster film ever made.
          Made with a minimum of resources, this film
          still packs quite a wallop.  Rating:  8 (0 to
          10), high +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     With the release of GODZILLA 2000, there have been a number of
reviewers mentioning the first Godzilla film, both the Japanese
version GOJIRA and the re-cut American version GODZILLA, KING OF THE
MONSTERS.  The web has, however, very few reviews of the original
film.</P>
<P>     GODZILLA really has to be seen as two very different films.
You have to see the film as it was released in the United States,
and you have to see through that to the original Japanese film.  The
Japanese film, made as an imitation of THE BEAST FROM 20,000
FATHOMS, turned into a fairly serious allegory of the close of the
Second World War and the fear of nuclear weapons.  This was in part
because of timing.  The film was made just after a Japanese fishing
boat had strayed into the waters where the hydrogen bomb had been
tested.  The fish they caught were radioactive but were still
allowed to be sold in Japan.  When the Japanese found out that
dangerous radioactive fish had been sold to unsuspecting citizens
they blamed the United States and they called the incident Americas
third atomic attack on Japan.  The script is also is an exploration
of the theme of the responsibility of the scientist to the world and
an indictment of the developers of the atomic bomb.  So the plot of
BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS, the indignity over the fishing incident,
and festering anger over the use of nuclear weapons in the war all
came together into a story of a primordial evil coming out of the
sea.</P>
<P>     The American version crudely interpolates American reporter
Steve Martin (played by Raymond Burr) into the story.  The scenes
with Burr are obviously of a different film stock and have no
overlapping characters whose faces are seen.  Actually the
characters of Emiko Yamane is both in scenes with Martin and
without, but when she is with Martin her back is to the camera and
her blouse is a different plaid.  Clearly another woman stood in and
the filmmakers could not quite match the blouse material.  Martin
appears to be in several of the key points of activity as the
Japanese react to the attack of the monster, without ever really
participating much in the action except to throw in occasional
comments like "I can't believe what just happened."</P>
<P>     For the plot here I will describe the American version, though
there are some differences in order of events.  (For example, the
Japanese version is not told in flashback like the American version
is.)  The film opens looking at the destruction that has been
wrought on Tokyo.  It looks like it was intended to suggest that a
nuclear blast has taken place.  That was probably not the intent of
the original film, since it does not have this opening sequence.
Journalist Martin was on his way by plane to cover another story.
During a layover in Japan to visit a school friend, Dr. Serizawa, he
is called in and questioned if he saw any anything unusual from his
plane.  Ships from the Japanese fishing fleet have been
disappearing.  Sometimes they get off distress calls that say
mysterious things like the "ocean has exploded."  (That is actually
a very powerful image, by the way.)</P>
<P>     Soon the mystery seems to be centering around Odo Island, near
to all the disasters.  There the natives have worshiped a terrible
god who has lived in the sea.  They call him Godzilla.  Scientists
go to Odo Island to discover if there could be some connection
between the island and the disasters.  While they are there
something very like a storm destroys half the island.  But it is a
funny kind of a storm that is oddly destructive.  It destroys their
helicopter as if it were a toy (which with the low-budget special
effects is exactly what it looks like).  The natives think the
island was attacked by their deity.</P>
<P>     A ship full of scientists, headed by Emiko's father,
paleontologist Dr. Yamane (Takashi Shimura), comes to investigate
the island and discover radioactive remains from the storm.  Finally
the island deity shows himself in clear weather, a four-hundred-foot
dinosaur, a survivor from two million [sic] years ago.  (The
Japanese version says he is two hundred feet.)  He has lived in the
sea for all human memory, but now nuclear testing has goosed him up,
made him radioactive, and he wants to wreak revenge on the world.</P>
<P>     Godzilla dodges the depth charges of the Japanese fleet and
makes his way to Tokyo harbor.  Then he comes ashore twice, laying
waste to the city in two very nicely filmed sequences.  Up to these
sequences we have seen little of the monster and after we will see
little, but these two sequences are supremely powerfully filmed.</P>
<P>     Meanwhile we learn that Emiko has been promised to Dr. Serizawa
but is actually in love with Ogata, a young navy officer.  Serizawa
has his own problems and is not very interested in Emiko.  He has
developed a powerful weapon that could kill Godzilla, but to use it
would mean revealing it to the world.  Being a moral Japanese,
unlike immoral American scientists, he believes that the discoverer
has responsibility to be certain that his discoveries are not used
for evil purposes.  Serizawa has revealed the weapon to Emiko and
she has told Ogata.  Serizawa must weigh his fears against what
Godzilla is already doing to Tokyo.  (Ogata argues that Serizawa
should use the weapon.  You have your fears, which may become
reality.  And you have Godzilla, which is reality.)  Serizawa must
resolve his moral dilemma.</P>
<P>     Sometimes the lack of a budget can work in the favor of a film.
GODZILLA certainly benefits from the low budget of some of its
production.  The scenes of the attacks on Tokyo have a sort of
crudeness that in black and white, a little fuzzy, gives them an
almost documentary quality.  Scenes of the great beast are almost
always shot from a low angle, looking upward.  Why this approach was
abandoned in later Godzilla films is unclear, but the size of the
creature is emphasized in a way that would be difficult in a color
film.  Filming in color at eye level just does not convey the threat
and no other film has ever made a giant monster as frightening.</P>
<P>     Some of the best effects were found by chance.  The model steel
towers melted under the hot studio lights.  They were remade and the
effect of their melting was combined with an aerosol spray in
Godzilla's mouth to create the effect that his fiery breath was
causing the damage.  The sound of the great beast's heavy footfalls
were created by a drum.  I personally never associated the drumbeats
as being anything but mood music, but the sound works that way.  On
the other hand, the sound of stroking the strings of a large cello-
like instrument with a leather glove, then slowing it down and
playing it backwards, acts as the groans of Godzilla.  It sounds
like steel girders giving way in hell.  The effect is just about
perfect.  The musical score is crude with its military marches, but
somehow they seem to work.</P>
<P>     When the effects work they are terrific, when they do not work,
they do not work.  All too often the effects are just a bit on the
cheesy side.  There are scenes when we are obviously looking at a
hand-puppet.  Even that would not be so bad, but we then see what is
supposedly a photograph of what we had just seen and it looks
nothing like the puppet version.  There was a similar problem in THE
BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS.  Another problem is with the Godzilla
suit itself.  Godzilla has what can best be described as an A-line
figure.  He has very heavy massive legs and gargantuan feet, but his
trunk is not commensurately large.  His legs also have and
unfortunate tendency to have folds on a way that a jacket might but
an arm would not.  The crudeness of the filming conceals the fact
that Godzilla has external ears in a way that reptiles do not.  The
producers at Toho thought that people would assume Godzilla was deaf
if they did not give him obvious external ears.  Of course a parrot
has no external ears and hears well enough to repeat sounds he
hears.  The film also features a traveling matte of a view directly
into the face of the beast as seen from Tokyo tower.  It is one of
the worst jobs of matting I ever remember seeing.  Some of Bert I.
Gordon's matte jobs look good by comparison.  In most scenes the
beast is shown moving in slow motion to accentuate his size, but
when he bats away missiles, he moves at normal speed and spoils much
of the illusion.  However, it should be remembered many of
Universal's classic films have their moments when they do not show
consummate visual craftsmanship.  DRACULA, for example, has some
very silly scenes including a silly scene of a bee coming out of a
bee-size coffin.  In some ways we cannot be really sure where some
of the errors crept in.  We are told a disaster at sea occurred at
3:30 AM, but when we saw it earlier the crew was on the deck and the
sun was shining.</P>
<P>     Where THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS had just showed its monster
in the streets and people running from it, GOJIRA looks more at the
emotional effect on people.  What made it to the American version is
fairly effective, but what was cut out are some very impressive
scenes.  In one scene of the Japanese film only, a mother sits at
the base of a building near where the monster is rampaging.  She
sadly tells her children that they will all be with their father
soon.  This tone is surprisingly bleak for a monster movie.  The
whole population of Tokyo seems to mourn the great losses wrought by
Godzilla.  Themes of sacrifice, honor, and suicide seem to accent
the bleak tone of this film.  Other imaginative scenes include a
view of the monster ravaging Tokyo with a cage of birds seen in
silhouette in the foreground.  In other scenes we see Godzilla
walking and the dust his huge feet kick up.</P>
<P>     It is never easy to judge acting ability of someone who is
speaking in a language you do not know.  This film does have the
second-best-known international actor from Japanese film.  Dr.
Yamane is played by Takashi Shimura, the star of films like IKIRU
and THE SEVEN SAMURAI.  Unfortunately the actor who dubs his lines
in the American version is not very good.  Particularly noticeable
is his inability to pronounce the word "phenomenon" which he says
"phenonemon."  To have such an educated man making that silly
mistake is unintentionally humorous.</P>
<P>     This is a film with some very nice visual imagery and it has
become a favorite film.  It is not so much a good film as a weak
film with some very good moments.  The American version I would have
to give only a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.  The Japanese version
is probably a high +2 film.</P>
<P>     It should be noted that also that this is the most influential
film ever made in Japan.  It was Japan's first international
cinematic success.  It spawned the Japanese genre of "kaiju" films.
"Kaiju" is Japanese for "monster" and the continuing Godzilla
series, Japanese anime, and even Pokemon are direct descendents of
this film.</P>
