<P>In this year's July the American Film Institute (AFI) chose David Lean's
war picture "The Bridge on the River Kwai" as number 13 on its list of
the 100 greatest American movies. Not to mention that "The Bridge on the
River Kwai" is a British picture, the AFI's decision expresses in the
first place the same lapse of taste that the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences showed in 1958 by giving Lean's film seven Oscars.
Much better movies came away empty-handed in those days, among them
Lumet's "12 Angry Men", Wilder's "Witness for the Prosecution" and
Kubrick's "Paths of Glory" (the latter wasn't nominated in any
category).</P>
<P>"The Bridge on the River Kwai" is set in Burma in 1943. A batallion of
British soldiers in Japanese war captivity is forced by the Japanese to
build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the River Kwai. But
the British commanding officer, Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness),
insists - corresponding to the Geneva Conventions - that his officers
needn't work as simple workmen. Struggling toughly, Colonel Nicholson
forces the Japanese commandant, Col. Saito (Sessue Hayakawa), to give
way in this respect. Afterwards Colonel Nicholson assiduously commits
himself for the building of the bridge. He considers it an opportunity
to raise his men's morale, and he wants to prove superior British
capabilities to the Japanese. But the British High Command sends a few
soldiers who shall destroy the bridge, among them the American Shears
(William Holden) - an escapee from the Japanese prison camp - and the
British Major Warden (Jack Hawkins).</P>
<P>The film is racist in a certain sense because the Japanese people are
presented as intellectually inferior to the British. For example, in the
filmmakers' opinion the Japanese seem to be incapable of building a
bridge.</P>
<P>Lean's picture partly succeeds in showing the madness of war. But the
movie opportunistically avoids a really consistent and clear treatment
of this theme. This is probably one of the reasons for the picture's
popularity. But unfortunately it also hinders "The Bridge on the River
Kwai" from being a real anti-war film. Much helped by Alec Guinness'
superior performance, there's at least the interesting study of Col.
Nicholson, a man possessed by the idea of being a hero. Although you can
find some ironic dialogue concerning the military spirit in the film,
David Lean doesn't really question the military "logic" as Stanley
Kubrick does in "Paths of Glory". Lean seems rather fascinated by the
military hierarchies. This is also perceptible in the conversations
between Col. Nicholson and Col. Saito. It is symptomatic of the film's
attitude that Shears, who doubts the military logic, is such a cynical
an unpleasant person. The audience is supposed to applaud Col.
Nicholson's perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall
work on the bridge or not. The spectators are supposed to neglect the
risks Nicholson takes for his men. (The plot systematically by-passes
these risks.)</P>
<P>Lean's direction is quite effective, but didn't deserve the Academy
Award it earned. (Compare the direction in "The Bridge on the River
Kwai" with Sidney Lumet's amazing and more subtle work in "12 Angry Men"
and Wilder's achievement in "Witness for the Prosecution".) The film is
well-photographed too and has an apt score. There is also no denying
that the picture is suspenseful. But the characters often seem little
more than a plot device.</P>
<P>"The Bridge on the River Kwai" is cynical, especially in the both
dramatic and implausible showdown. The filmmakers are obviously more
interested in clichés than in the characters of the film.</P>
<P>"The Bridge on the River Kwai" could have become an important
anti-militarist motion picture and an interesting study of complex
characters with clashing interests. But it hasn't. The formal cleverness
of Lean's film and its suspense can't obscure the fact that it is
questionable in its contents. There are, of course, worse films, but I
also know far better ones.</P>
