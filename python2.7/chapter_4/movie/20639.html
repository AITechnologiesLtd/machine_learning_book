GROUNDHOG DAY
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>At first glance, GROUNDHOG DAY looks like a film that
epitomises the worst in today's Hollywood - the lack of
originality and total reliance on "high concept". The plot
is "borrowed" from a short SF story by Richard A. Lupoff,
then turned into TWILIGHT ZONE episodes, short film by
Jonathan Heap and, finally, passable but forgettable TV
thriller by Jack Sholder. But this 1993 comedy, directed by
 noted SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE comedian Harold Ramis is
actually something very rare in today's Hollywood - a film
that is in the same time very funny and very humane,
thought-provoking yet entertaining. Because of that the
authors of GROUNDHOG DAY should be forgiven for their use of
not so original idea.</P>
<P>The film begins in Pittsburgh television station, where
weatherman Phil Conners (played by Bill Murray) receives yet
another routine and boring assignment - he must go to small
town of Punxsutawney and cover Groundhog Day, the
traditional event where a local mascot, groundhog named
Phil, indicates the length of remaining winter day. Conners,
self- centred misanthropic, is so disgusted with the task
that he decides to make life miserable for his producer Rita
(played by Andie MacDowell) and cameraman Larry (Chris
Elliott). To make things even worse for him, the unexpected
blizzard grounds the crew in the small town. When he wakes
up the next day, he suddenly realises that the people are
saying the same lines, using the same gestures and that the
same events are happening all over again. He is stuck in the
time loop and he is forced to relive Groundhog Day again and
again for, its seems, all eternity. Stuck in something
resembling personal hell, Phil must find a way to adapt to
the new situation.</P>
<P>Supernatural comedy as a sub-genre more often than not
produced weak, mediocre and formulaic movies in modern
Hollywood. Humour in such comedies was lame, storylines
cliched and predictable, and it usually degenerated into
self-serving special effects bonanza. But, it wasn't the
case with the GROUNDHOG DAY, mostly because the movie had
employed the talents already experienced in such areas. The
director and co-screenwriter Harold Ramis had already proved
himself by writing a screenplay for GHOSTBUSTERS, a similar,
although more spectacular product of that genre. For this
film, he was joined by Danny Rubin and the result was very
intelligent and tight script. The best thing two of them did
was to get rid of any scientific, para-scientific or magical
explanations for the personal time warp - which would
probably look corny and unconvincing. Instead they
concentrated on the practical matters and explored the ways
an average man like Phil would cope with the situation. And
it was done superbly. Movie that covers the same situations
and dialogues over and over again was in great danger of
being repetitive. But the script prevented this - after
being introduced to the main storyline in first, "normal",
segment, we see how even the smallest of details could
branch a whole new and interesting chain of events.</P>
<P>What makes this film especially funny is the great talent of
Bill Murray, one of the best comedians in modern Hollywood.
The entire movie rested on his shoulders. While all other
actors had rather simple roles to repeat, his character was
the only one being the aware the utter repetitiveness of his
existence and thus the only one who was changing through the
entire movie. It was really fine to see the different ways
he reacted to the situation - anger, disbelief, despair and
final acceptance - all that through the subtle gestures or
one-liners. What makes his character even more humane and
likeable, despite his more than obvious flaws, is a fact
that the he is faced with perpetual dilemmas and that he
takes different courses of actions, many of them the same
ones some of us would take in his place. And, finally, we
see him change and change for the better, which, of course
would reward both him and the audience with a happy ending.</P>
<P>The other actors and their performances were, as someone
should expect, shadowed by Bill Murray's role and reduced to
bit parts. Andie MacDowell as his attractive producer Rita
was, of course, good in her role, but the chemistry between
Murray and her wasn't particularly engaging, making their
romantic subplot somewhat too formulaic. And the editing in
this very well directed film should have been better -
Phil's mood change from manic to suicidal seems a little bit
too sudden. But, despite those minor flaws, GROUNDHOG DAY
deserved its reputation of a surprisingly good film,
reputation that gives it a serious potential to be regarded
as 1990s classic by future filmophiles.</P>
