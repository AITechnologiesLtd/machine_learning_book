<PRE>Traffic
A film review by Max Messier
Copyright 2000 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>How do you fight a war when the people that you love are the enemy? 
When the conflict is in your own neighborhood, or your own house?  Such
is the dilemma in the exceptional new film about the drug trade in the
United States and Mexico, Traffic.</P>
<P>A harrowing and thought-provoking film, Traffic revolves around three
intertwining stories of cops, thugs, victims, enforcers, politicians,
and the judicial system.  The film is based on a British Channel 4
miniseries called Traffik, which traced a drug route from Pakistan
through Europe and to Great Britain.  Laura Bickford, one of the
producers for Traffic, was attracted to the original miniseries because
of the intersecting stories, the social commentary on drug usage, and
the implication of The System itself being the major perpetrator of drug
addiction.</P>
<P>The film revolves around three disparate stories, which Soderbergh
handles with aplomb.  One story centers on Tijuana State policeman
Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) and his partner, Manolo, caught in a
web of political corruption centered on the Mexican drug trade.  Del
Toro is a standout, delivering a subtle, powerful performance rich with
authenticity.</P>
<P>A second story centers on Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), the U.S.
President's newly appointed drug czar whose daughter Caroline (played by
newcomer Erika Christensen), an A+ student, develops a drug problem that
turns from occasional use to severe addiction.  This story focuses on
the impact of drugs on the nuclear family and the general inability of
the family to protect itself.  Douglas and Amy Irving (as Wakefield's
wife) turn in wonderful performances as quiet, concerned parents who are
powerless to stop their daughter's fall into drug use.</P>
<P>Finally, the third story revolves around the actual purveyors of drugs
and the law enforcers determined to put them out of business.  The story
is anchored by Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones), wife of major San
Diego drug baron Carlos (Steven Bauer). Unaware of her husband's illicit
business, she enlists the aid of her husband's attorney Arnie Metzger
(Dennis Quaid playing a slime ball) to get him out of jail -- even if it
means taking over the business.</P>
<PRE>All of these stories add up to make Traffic one of the best films of
2000.</PRE>
<P>Soderbergh's deft directing and cinematography work give each section of
the film a unique look and feel.  The Mexican landscape is overexposed
and enriched with sepia tones.  The home of Douglas and the government
agencies are a cool-blue color in sharp contrast.  San Diego has a warm
glow to its environment and its population.  Whenever characters from
each of the stories intersect, things get really spicy.</P>
<P>Traffic tackles tough situations and still delivers a solid, complex
tale filled with thrilling moments and heart-wrenching drama.  The film
doesn't deliver a solution for ending the war on drugs, but it does
offer insight into the business.  As a tale about the most
self-destructive part of society, Soderbergh has created nothing short
of a masterpiece.</P>
