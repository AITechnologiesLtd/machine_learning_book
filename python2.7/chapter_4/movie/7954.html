<PRE>                           NATURAL BORN KILLERS
                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>**1/2 (out of 4 = OK)
1994, R, 117 minutes [1 hour, 47 minutes]
[drama/satire]
starring: Woody Harrelson (Mickey Knox), Juliette Lewis (Mallory Knox),
Robert Downey Jr. (Wayne Gale), Tom Sizemore (Jack Scagnetti), Tommy Lee
Jones (Warden Dwight Muclusky), written by Quentin Tarantino, David Veloz,
Richard Rutowski, Oliver Stone, produced by Jane Hamsher, Don Murphy, Clayton
Townsend, directed by Oliver Stone.</P>
<P>I should have expected more (or maybe less in this case) from Oliver Stone.
"Natural Born Killers" tries to combat the evils of society by portraying
them in a very bizarre manner. It is an orgy of hyper editing and surrealism,
like a music video acted out. Unfortunately, it tries a little too hard to be
too many things at the same time. </P>
<P>Like many other films, this is an attempt to go inside the mind of a maniac
and try to understand how it works. In this case the mindset is shared by
Mickey and Mallory Knox (Harrelson, Lewis), who are two crazed mass
murderers, but because of the unusual reality the story takes place in, they
don't seem much different from everyone else, which the film's essential
theme.         </P>
<P>The story of these two psychotic lovebirds is a strange one. Most of the
viciousness and insanity are implied. We can't comprehend why Mickey and
Mallory love each other or why they do what they do, it's all just mood. The
problem is the surrealism becomes a hindrance after a while, almost causing
for a state of vertigo.</P>
<P>Perhaps it is Mickey and Mallory's attitude that is so disturbing. They
aren't insane, they can tell right from wrong, but the fact they blatantly
choose to do evil deeds is shocking. People say we have become desensitized
to violence and obscenity, yet there has to be at least one thing in this
film that will disturb every viewer in some way. </P>
<P>At one point the two are in need of help and are taken in by an Indian
family. Unfortunately, Mickey ends up destroying his only chance for
salvation. This is the only time the two feel any remorse, but the scene is
so short and shallow it doesn't nearly have the impact it intends to have.</P>
<P>The "normal" people of this reality are represented by Wayne Gale (Downey),
a tabloid journalist who is obsessed with the two, and like to exploit them.
He chronicles their actions and makes his living by sensationalizing them.
He does it so well, the media and the entire country fall in love with their
nihilism. Kids wave banners that say, "Kill me next Mickey!" and other
strange things. Eventually, Scagnetti (Sizemore), a tough cop who seems just
as corrupt and wicked as the murderers, corners them and sends them to jail.
Here is where the real exploitation begins and where the film takes a turn
for the worse.</P>
<P>Gale gets an exclusive interview with Mickey in jail, live, and right after
the Superbowl. Up until this point the film had been original in its
surrealistic storytelling style and bizarre reality. By the end it becomes a
standard action movie as the two escape and hold Gale hostage. The ending
itself is a little too allegorical and not exactly true to the nature of the
film.</P>
<P>Some of the last scenes show some clips of the Menedez brothers and O.J.
Simpson trials. I felt this was completely unnecessary and pretty much killed
the entire point of the film. Most films are about drawing your own
conclusions, but this swoops down with an actual "answer."</P>
<P>Still, for all its strangeness, "Natural Born Killers" is an interesting
film to watch. The direction and editing are second to none, but the actual
script itself needed improvement. </P>
