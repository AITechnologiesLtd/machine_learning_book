<PRE>KISS OR KILL</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: ** (out of ****) </PRE>
<P>October / 1:35 / 1997 / R (language, sexual perversion, nudity, violence)
Cast: Matt Day; Frances O'Connor; Chris Haywood; Barry Otto; Andrew S. 
Gilbert; Barry Langrishe; Max Cullen 
Director: Bill Bennett 
Screenplay: Bill Bennett </P>
<P>With "Kiss or Kill," Aussie director Bill Bennett tries to fashion a hip 
film noir with attractive leads, alluring scenery and a complex plot 
involving sex and murder. Unfortunately, the results are middling at 
best. It really says a lot that the movie's best sequence -- two cops 
casually conversing over breakfast, which, by the way, is extremely 
similar to the John Travolta-Samuel L. Jackson diner dialogue near the 
end of "Pulp Fiction" -- has absolutely nothing to do with anything. 
Jackson's "Fiction" hitman character claimed that personality goes a long 
way. Well, this movie has none. </P>
<P>"Love and Other Catastrophes" alums Frances O'Connor and Matt Day play 
drifting grifters Nikki and Al. She's a flirty lass who hangs out in 
bars, bats her eyes at wealthy-looking patrons and escorts them up to 
their hotel rooms where she spikes their drinks; he, brooding and 
secretive, lets himself in and helps her make off with whatever valuables 
they can steal. When one mark accidentally dies after being drugged, 
Nikki and Al panic and make off with his briefcase, which they're sure 
contains some kind of worthwhile bounty. Not quite -- its contents 
actually consist of a tape that explicitly reveals a renowned sports hero 
(Barry Langrishe) to be a pedophile. With the police and several other 
seedy types on their trail, the criminal lovebirds hit the road. </P>
<P>There are many directions "Kiss or Kill" could go at this point, and the 
filmmakers attempt to cover them all with equal parts disturbing 
suspense, black comedy and romantic drama (with a couple of repressed 
flashbacks and blazing explosions thrown in for good measure). The mix 
might have worked had any of these characters been tightly-written, but 
they're not -- we don't know about them, we don't care about them. In 
similar movies, the supporting cast can be quirky enough to steal the 
stars' fire, but here they're just as dull. Incredibly strong, appealing 
performances from Day and O'Connor aside, there's little meaty enough 
here to sink your teeth into. </P>
<P>Because "Kiss or Kill" utilizes the seemingly-foolproof, twisty elements 
of the crime caper, one might be tempted to call it a triumph of style 
over substance. But discounting glamorously dusty outback scenery, the 
movie's look is a headache-inducer thanks to sledgehammer editing. An 
example scene construction: Cut to Nikki opening a house door to walk to 
a car trunk, cut to Nikki at the car trunk, cut to Nikki walking back 
through the house door. I've heard of keeping things moving, but this is 
absolutely irritating. </P>
<P>"Kiss or Kill" does boast a few interesting nuances -- like Nikki and 
Al's growing distrust of each other -- but overall, the more turns the 
plot takes, the more distancing and dull it becomes. Eventually, a 
particularly engaging setup is wasted to serve annoying contrivances. 
Perhaps the most telling flaw of "Kiss or Kill" is divulged in its 
production notes -- a majority of the film's dialogue and interaction 
were improvised. Maybe Bennett will use an actual script next time. </P>
