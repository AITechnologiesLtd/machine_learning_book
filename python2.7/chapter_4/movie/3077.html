<P>     Francis Ford Coppola's DRACULA.  Mike Nicols' WOLF.  Kenneth
Branagh's FRANKENSTEIN.  Suddenly, horror of the old genre (as opposed
to the '80s slasher flicks) is back with a vengeance.  The latest, and
arguably the most ambitious, to enter this potentially-lucrative market
is a cinematic version of Anne Rice's INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE.</P>
<P>     As was true with CRONOS earlier this year, INTERVIEW WITH THE
VAMPIRE makes some modifications to common vampire mythology (as made
popular in DRACULA and perpetuated in countless horror books and
films).  The fangs are still present, as are the insatiable bloodlust
and fear of daylight, but no longer will religious trappings hold the
undead at bay, and a stake through the heart has lost its
effectiveness.</P>
<P>     The film begins and ends in present-day San Francisco, with Louis
(Brad Pitt), a two-century old vampire, telling his story to a
fascinated interviewer (Christian Slater).  His tale opens in 1791
Louisiana, just south of New Orleans, where Louis falls victim to the
vampire Lestat (Tom Cruise).  Given a choice between death and eternal
life as one of the undead, Louis chooses the latter, a decision he will
forever regret.</P>
<P>     Louis cannot kill with the impunity of Lestat, but to sate his
hunger, he must feed, and the blood of animals is not enough.
Eventually, he pierces the neck of a grief-stricken young girl named
Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), whom Lestat then curses with his unholy form
of resurrection so that she can be a surrogate daughter to both himself
and Louis.  For a while, they are one "big, happy family."  But all
things come to an end, and Claudia's growing resentment of Lestat fuels
a bloody confrontation.</P>
<P>     When INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE works, it's as compelling and
engrossing a piece of entertainment as is available on film today.
When it falters, the weaknesses seem magnified.  Fortunately, under the
care of director Neil Jordan (THE CRYING GAME), instances of the former
are more frequent that those of the latter, although the film
noticeably stumbles during two key sequences (a needlessly drawn-out
exploration of life as a vampire in Paris and the illogical, dumb
conclusion).  Despite the ups and downs of the second half, however,
the first hour is classic horror at its most grotesque.  In the best
tradition of the GRAND GUIGNOL, INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE revels in
its graphic and horrifying bloodiness.</P>
<P>     Tom Cruise's Lestat is not a consistent villain, nor does he come
across as particularly multi-dimensional, but there are times when his
screen presence commands attention.  More effective is Brad Pitt's
Louis, who captures the audience's sympathy by fighting against losing
his conscience (although his constant wallowing in self-pity becomes
tiresome).  Most arresting of all is young Kirsten Dunst, whose
charisma is such that she continually steals scenes from her older and
more experienced co-stars.  Also featured are Antonio Bandaras (as the
ancient vampire Armand), Stephen Rea (in what is little more than a
cameo), and Christian Slater.</P>
<P>     As is true of many vampire stories, there is an erotic
undercurrent to INTERVIEW.  Here, explicitness is replaced by
innuendo.  While sex is rarely in the background, it's never on screen,
either.  Homoeroticism, the Electra Complex, and pedophilia are all
hinted at.</P>
<P>     As horror films go, INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE has the right
look.  Atmosphere may not be everything, but its importance cannot be
understated.  With its gothic settings, superlative makeup (by Stan
Winston), and sterling miniatures work, this film can claim visuals
nearly on par with those of Kenneth Branagh's stylish FRANKENSTEIN.
There are other parallels between these films, not the least of which
is their equally erratic pacing.  However, INTERVIEW's plot is probably
more coherent and its characters somewhat better realized.  There are
flaws to be found here--even for those not specifically looking--but
for the simple horrific pleasure offered, they can be set aside, if not
entirely ignored.</P>
