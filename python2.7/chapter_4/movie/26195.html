<P>   At one point in this movie--quite an unusual one if only
because one cannot place its genre squarely into the
category of American musicals or European tragedy--the
principal character, Selma (Bjork) declares that she is not
afraid of going blind.  She has seen everything.  And boy,
has she ever.  She has observed not only the beauty of her
adopted country, America--its trees, lakes, mountains, even
its railroad trains--but she has been witness to the adversities
of life as well.  Little does she know just how much more
catastrophic her life will become as she has not only lost her
job and most of her sight: she may have to give up her
obsessive goal to get her son an operation to save his own
sight, her chance at what could have been a developing
relationship with a good albeit weak-willed man, and even her
very life.  Selma is a saintly person in the manner of director
Lars von Trier's principal played by Emily Watson in his
wonderful "Breaking the Waves."  Von Trier, once again 
following the Dogme rules of avoiding the usual
appurtenances of Hollywood filming such as an ever-present
soundtrack and dramatic lighting, follows the characters
around with a hand-held camera to give his picture the rough
texture that symbolizes the bleak, working-class lives of the
Washington State community.</P>
<P>   The story is simple enough to follow and is hardly the
reason that "Dancer in the Dark" is bound to compete with
"Shadow of the Vampire" as the most talked-about film of the
year.  Selma, a homely woman who often appears mildly
retarded, is an immigrant from Czechoslovakia who in 1963
has found work on a cutting machine in a factory.  Her thick
glasses will soon be of no help to her as she is swiftly going
blind.  To save her young boy, Gene (Vladica Kostic) from
the same difficulty, she is saving money to give the lad an
operation by his 13th birthday.  Selma has only two things
going for her: one is her friendship with another emigre on
the factory floor, Kathy (Catherine Deneuve) and with her
landlord, a policeman named Bill (David Morse) who lives
with his spendthrift wife, Jean (Cara Seymour).  The other is
her rich fantasy life.  She has apparently come to America
not only to get her son the eye operation he needs but
because she believed that this entire country is inhabited by
people perpetually performing as though they were in a
Hollywood musical.  This latter fantasy is what gives von
Trier's movie its delightful originality, putting "Dancer in the
Dark" on the cutting edge of innovative cinema.  Though
Selma is a member of a drama group which is about to stage
the laughably sugary and banal "The Sound of Music," her
fancy takes her into a territory mined more by contemporary
stage composers like Stephen Sondheim than by Rodgers
and Hammerstein.  Every so often--encouraged in some
cases by the rhythmic beat of the machines on the factory
floor or the choo choo choo of the local railroad train--Selma
sweeps herself away into flights of fancy encouraging all
those surrounding her (in her own mind) to join in.  Since the
lyrics, which were composed by Sjon Sigurdsson and the
director himself, are sometimes drowned out by the din, and
the original music of the lead performer, Bjork (who is also
famed in Iceland for her song), is likewise submerged, the
audience is unable to feel the impact of the Brechtian
commentary.  Nor is the choreography particularly inspired.</P>
<P>   Nonetheless the movie, which won the Palme D'Or at the
recent festival at Cannes, evokes the life of drudgery and
soulless existence of factory work in rural America while
Bjork's performance as a woman who is sinking both
physically and emotionally into a morass of adversity, is
utterly heartbreaking.</P>
<P>   Bjork and Deneuve are supported well by an ensemble that
includes David Morse as the perennial cop and Peter
Stormare as the aspiring boy friend.  Lars Von Trier shows
himself once against as a director with imagination, one who
continues to push back the boundaries of cinema, eschewing
the fatuous feel-goodism endemic to Hollywood movies for
real-life, emotionally gripping drama.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running time: 134 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
