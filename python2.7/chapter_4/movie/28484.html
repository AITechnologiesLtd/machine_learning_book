<P>   Remember this one from English class?</P>
<PRE>In London town where I was born,
And where I got my learning,
Sweet William Green took to his bed,
For love of Barbara Allen.</PRE>
<P>   Strangely enough medieval ballads like this one were among
my favorite memories from college sophomore English class and
what's more I think they could be appealing even to high school
kids because a good deal of them are blood-curdling.  Poisoning
and suicide by lovers ("Barbara Allen"), stabbings of fathers by
their sons ("Edward"), drownings on the high seas because of
predicted storms ignored by seamen ("Sir Patrick Spens") pop up
among other casualties.  Then again, a modern kid would want
the ballads set to rap and that would kind of destroy the lovely lilt
that always undercut the subversive nature of the words.  In
Maggie Greenwald's exquisitely sensitive and sincere film
"Songcatcher," the title character laments the fact that people
today may read the words to the songs,  but what good are mere
statements without the music that makes them soar?  Ms.
Greenwald, whose previous and largely ignored film "The Ballad of
Little Jo" (about a woman in 1866, disgraced by her out-of-
wedlock baby, who runs to the West and like Yentl pretends she's
a man), comes across once again.  With the help of "Little Jo"'s
music composer David Mansfield Greenwald has fashioned a film
that's a revelation.  With a superlative cast acting  the roles of
mountain people who react to a city slicker in their midst,
"Songcatcher" could forever alter your impression of hillbillies.</P>
<P>   Filmed on location in the western mountains of North Carolina
north of Asheville, "Songcatcher" centers on Janet McTeer in the
role of Dr. Lily Penleric who, upon being passed over in 1907 for a
promotion to full professor of music (in favor of a male outsider)
becomes a feminist albeit in a less aggressive manner than did
Suzi Amis's title character in "The Ballad of Little Jo."  She quits
her job and heads for the hills, aiming to capture Appalachian
music from its source and that music's relationship to the Scotch-
Irish ballads that were anonymously composed between 1200 and
1700 and passed on through the generations.  Taking up
residence in a snug wooden cabin with her schoolteacher sister
Elna (Jane Adams), she is well on her way to writing her book
when she hears the words to several ballads beautifully performed
by a teenage girl, Deladis Slocumb (Emmy Rossum).  Lily realizes
straight away that these ballads are in the pure form not yet
known by so-called outlanders (those who do not live in these
Appalachian communities).  She transcribes the notes and
records the songs on a primitive cylinder to be placed by one of
those Victrolas you see in the RCA ads now and then.</P>
<P>    Two other people change her life as dramatically.  One is Viney
Butler (Pat Carroll) in an Earth-mother role, shotgun in hand, who
knocks the city out of Lily by commanding her to assist in a bloody
childbirth. The other is a man with whom she becomes
romantically involved--kept apart for a while as Tom Bledsoe
(Aidan Quinn), wants her off the property because he considers
her writing and recording to be an exploitation of his people.</P>
<P>   "Songcatcher" is a happy combination of captivating music
sung by the local L'iL Abners either a capella or to the
accompaniment of banjos and fiddles and splendid ensemble
acting, the performers enacting the types of disputes that even
citizens in big cities are a part of--intellectual theft, exploitation by
capitalists, Bible-thumping gay bashers to cite a few.  McTeer
does a super job, wide-eyed throughout a good deal of the
proceedings as she watches a manager of a mining company
buying up land at Depression prices from the poor denizens, and
again in the middle of a fiery confrontation that erupts when one of
the villagers discovers her sister, Elna, in flagrante with her
teaching partner and lover, Harriet Tolliver (E. Katherine Kerr).</P>
<P>   I took issue with two points, however minor.  In one case, the
educated mining company manager holds that Johann Sebastian
Bach's music is superior to folk songs.  Lily responds that this is
like comparing apples and oranges "to the detriment of both
traditions."  Contrary to her rejoinder, one could hardly say that
the simple, repetitive melodies of the mountain people, however
lovely, can compare with the profound variations of, say, the
Brandenburg concerti or the Passacaglia and Fugue in B minor. 
In another segment of the story, Tom tells Lily that the outlanders
will never be interested in the music of the mountain people
because they consider hillbillies "dirty and illiterate."  Well...in fact
for all the goodness in their hearts, for the most part those
depicted in "Songcatcher" simply are.</P>
<P>   I was hoping that at some point in the 109 minute picture, Lily
would explain why these medieval ballads (which she erroneously
calls "ancient") are so bloody in contrast to the purely romantic
songs of, say, the U.S. during the 1950's as performed on TV in
"Your Hit Parade."  These cavils aside, "Songcatcher" is an
absolutely graceful and enchanting look at music that is so pure
you may just come away wishing that all the punk rock, acid rock
and even rock 'n' roll could just disappear so that we can at least
return to the innocence and charm of the folk era that informed
the generation of Pete Seeger, the Weavers, and the like.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running time: 109 minutes.  (C) 2001 by
