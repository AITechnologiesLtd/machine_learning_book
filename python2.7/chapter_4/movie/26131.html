<P>   The pleonastic title of this Taiwanese film reminds me of a
play by August Wilson that was staged off-Broadway some
time ago, "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom"--about the exploitation
of black musicians by white music producers.  Throughout
the play, the lead musician opened each number with "A one,
and a two, and y'all know what to do."  The director of "Yi Yi,"
who, by the way, garnered the well-deserved best director
award at the last Cannes Film Festival, stated in an interview
that the title serves double-duty (evidently enough).  While "Yi
Yi" literally means "one one," or "individually," a looser
translation is "a one and a two," the typical introduction to
jazz numbers--signifying here that nothing really serious is
going down.  In fact, what stands out from the direction of
this family saga is director Edward Yang's taking a complex,
generational family story which, if directed in the U.S., would
come out something like George Stevens' "Giant," serving it
to us as though the narrative really deals with only one or two
people.  Wang is like the shortstop at Wrigley Field who
makes a complex double-play seem like second nature,
requiring no effort at all.</P>
<P>   Patience, viewers.  During the first half hour, Wang throws
a stack of characters at us that could make you think that
heavy going's ahead.  How is he going to sort out this pot
pourri so that we absorb the characteristics of each person,
and then again, is this going to be one of those avant-garde
works that will continue through its almost three-hour length
like a loosely structured Robert Altman movie?  Not at all.</P>
<P>   There is a genuine focus and a sincere theme to the whole
tale.  The central figure, known as NJ (Nien-Jen Wu) because
people in the computer industry get American-style
nicknames, is undergoing a mid-life crisis, or more accurately,
a malaise.  In his mid-forties he is worried.  He is beginning
to wonder whether he has made mistakes early in life that
messed him up to such an extent that he will never be able to
retrieve the essence he probably sought as a teenager.  NJ is
a partner with a reasonably successful computer firm that
may go bottoms-up because it is not keeping up with the
times.  He needs to support his wife, Min-min (Elaine Jin), his
teenage daughter Ting-ting (Kelly) and his eight-year-old lad
Yang-yang (Jonathan Chang).  (The duplication of names is
further evidence that no matter how heavy the going, Wang
does not intend for us to take his story too seriously.) 
Because NJ looks honest, he is asked to negotiate a deal
with a Japanese designer, Ota (Issey Ogata)--but at a bad
time.  His mother-in-law (Tang Ru-yun) is in a coma and not
expected to live; his teen is involved in her first love affair
with a skinny kid named Fatty (Pung Chang Yu), and he has
just run into an old sweetheart, Sherry (Ko Su-yun) whom he
had stood up some twenty years ago, arranges secretly to
travel with her to Japan, and ponders a new life with this
woman who still wails about his leaving her in the lurch.</P>
<P>   The central narrative in itself may be nothing huge to write
home about, but Mr. Yang's power is in his close observation
of details.  He patiently holds several visuals for a minute or
more to give us in the audience a brief break between
dramatic scenes but more important to emphasize images of
high emotion to the characters.  He points out to the pride of
his U.S. audience the hold that American culture has on the
Taiwanese, shown by the Batman and Robin poster on the
eight-year-old's wall and the H&H (New York) bagels shop to
which the teens repair on dates if they have not already
booked tables at McDonald's.  Carefully foreshadowing items
that will assume importance later on, he has his A-1
cinematographer Yang Wei-han capture the beauties of
nature, particularly the cloud formations that come crashing
together yielding thunder and lightning--as though to show
that in life, the loveliness and the tempests are intertwined.  
Opening on a scene involving the wedding of NJ's brother-in-
law A-Di (Chen Hsi-sheng) and his pregnant partner Hsiao
Yen (Hsiao Shu-shen), Wang demonstrates how the
Taiwanese are at least as boisterous as any in a similar
situation in the U.S. when the drinks are freely flowing.</P>
<P>   Of particular charm is the dialogue conducted in English
between the Japanese game designer and NJ as they meet
first in Taipei and then in Tokyo, the clever Japanese in effect
taking the role of a guru to NJ in much the way that a
spiritual leader comforts NJ's wife after she has had a minor
breakdown.</P>
<P>   Despite the frequent loitering visuals and the occasional
monologue, "Yi Yi" moves smoothly along, and though we
can guess the fate of the comatose grandmother, Wang
throws in a smart twist involving NJ's business that, together
with the get-togethers and break-ups of the individuals
speaks volumes about the ways we are regularly betrayed
and seem never to learn from our miscalculations.  Dialogue
is in Mandarin, Hokkien and English with English subtitles.</P>
