                              G.I. JANE 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon

<P>Some valid points are made in this movie about the role of women not
just in the defence force, but also in society. Why do some men feel the
need to open a car door for a woman, to pull out a chair for her at the
dining table, or to give up a seat on the bus for a mother? Why is there
an undeniable urge to want to protect the 'weaker' sex? Do they really
need protecting? Somehow the thought of my father and brother tussling
in hand to hand combat on a battlefield puts knots of worry in my
stomach, yet if it were my mother and sister should I be more concerned?
Could these feelings be the result of my over sensitive conditioning by
society?</P>
<P>The Navy SEALs encompasses the toughest training program there is in
defence force of the United States. One woman (Demi Moore) is asked by a
Senator (Anne Bancroft), to undertake the training thus forever changing
the limited role and positions of women in armed combat. Moore is at
first given preferential treatment by the corps, to account for the
gender differences. Namely, steps to help climb a wall, a longer time
limit to complete tasks and separate barracks and showers. Which is not
unreasonable considering women are physiologically smaller, though no
less intelligent than their male counterparts. However, Moore realises
that she needs to go head to head with the males if she is to gain any
respect from them.</P>
<P>The numerous scenes of bone breaking drills are as gruelling on the mind
as on the eye. One begins to huff and puff just watching these men being
pushed to the upper limits of human endurance. The most shocking scene
is during a role played hostage interrogation. When Moore the leader of
her group is battered, bashed and simulated raped in front of her men,
in a attempt to break their code of silence. It is here that the
commanding officer makes a solid statement - "She isn't the problem, we
are." Meaning that the weakness lies not with the mettle of the female
soldier, but in the heart of the male counterpart who cannot endure
watching the torture of the fairer sex.</P>
<P>So perhaps society may need to change it's thinking towards women, and
their right to defend their country in armed combat. However, since
peace is predominant in the majority of the civilised world, there may
not be any need to make a hasty decision about sending women into
battle. In the mean time, I will continue to open car doors, pull out
chairs and sacrifice my seat on a bus for women. I will also go into
battle first before allowing my mother and sister to take up arms.
Hopefully, there will also come a day when there are no battles left to
be fought or won, and the only issue remaining regarding sexual equality
is who should carry the baby.</P>
<P>This Ridley Scott movie is more melodrama than standard war flick,
dealing with gender roles rather than actual combat. Not his best work,
although thought provoking enough to keep the viewer interested. Moore's
testosterone charged male characterisation is amusing. She has
undoubtedly been taking tough guy lessons from husband Bruce.</P>
