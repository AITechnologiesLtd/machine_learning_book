<PRE>SCREAM</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Chris Casino</PRE>
<PRE>***1/2 out of **** (Pretty good)</PRE>
<P>Director: Wes Craven, Writer: Kevin Williamson, Neve Campbell, David Arquette,
Courteney Cox, Drew Barrymore, Henry Winkler.</P>
<P>I was anxious to see this for a long time. A friend of mine recommended this to me 
because he has a crush on Neve Campbell, and he wanted to prove that she's as hot as he 
thinks he is. He proved it for me all right, but the reasons I enjoy this film go way 
beyond that.</P>
<P>SCREAM treads on familar ground, horror movie with, as star Neve Campbell puts
it,"Some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl who can't act who's
always running up the stairs when she should be running out the front door."
It's very familar, your typical horror film.</P>
<P>So why, you may ask after watching it, does it seem so new and original?</P>
<P>Because it treats itself as if it hasn't been done before, and thus the viewer
is disilusioned into believing that it is not old, familar tired stuff.</P>
<P>This raises another question: How does it do this?</P>
<P>Simple: The characters. They're not your typical stupid horror film victims who
don't know what the hell to do when being chased by a guy in a ski mask and a 
machette. They are horror fans, they know how stuff happens in a horror
movie, they know what to do and what not to do, and that makes it scary, and
even funny at certain times.</P>
<P>You can tell this just by watching the opening scene where Casey Becker (Drew
Barrymore) is making popcorn, getting ready to watch a video, and some guy
who sounds like a killer calls her up to play a game with her that involves
horror movie triva that, if she gets it wrong, will get her and her boyfriend killed.
She knows what to answer when he asks her horror film questions, she just can't
answer his final question,"What door am I at?" And that gets her killed. That
scene works because in a normal horror film, half the things that happen in that
scene would never happen.</P>
<P>The plot is typical horror stuff: Sidney Prescott (an impressive Neve Campbell), 
an attractive young high school student who's mother was killed a year ago
tommorrow, is being stalked by a killer who's previously murdered one of
her classmates (Casey, naturally), and everybody in this small, California
town is a suspect, including Sidney's boyfriend, Billy Loomis.</P>
<P>But as I said before, these people know how horror movies work, and that's what
makes it so appealing. That and the references to horror movies, like when
Casey says,"The first (NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET) was scary, but the rest sucked."
which is obviously director Wes Craven (who does a good job of poking fun of
the genre that made him a legend) patting himself on the back as he directed the first 
NIGHTMARE movie and none of the others, and when Tatum, Sidney's friend, mentions 
the director, Wes Carpenter, which is obviously an homage by writer Kevin
Williamson to not only Craven, but also director John Carpenter.</P>
<P>The cast is well chosen, Neve Campbell pulls off a good heroine (and unlike most
horror film heroines, she *can* act), Drew Barrymore does a good Janet Leigh impression 
for what little time she has in the film, and David Arquette is impressive. Also
good (and funny) in his role is Henry Winkler ("The Fonz") as the school principal.</P>
<P>I took half a point off for the unnecessary (albeit limited) appearance by FRIENDS'
Courteney Cox as reporter, Gail Edwards, Sidney's rival because she covered her 
mother's disappearance. I hate that show, I hate those actors. They're untalented, 
overexposed, and overpaid, IMHO, and I would think Wes Craven is smart enough to know 
those actors are overexposed enough, but I suppose he isn't.</P>
