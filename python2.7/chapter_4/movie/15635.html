SCHINDLER'S LIST
A film by Steven Spielberg
Starring: Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes
Written by Steven Zaillian
Based on the novel by Thomas Keneally</PRE>
<P>    At the end of Steven Spielberg's emotionally draining masterpiece, 
one gets the true feeling of the depth of man's inhumanity, especially 
to other men.  There is a deep sense of fear and dread that follows a 
viewing of SCHINDLER'S LIST, a feeling that a viewer is about to be 
bombarded with the horror of a time long gone, yet oddly familiar.  
SCHINDLER'S LIST is one of those truly rare films which aspire to 
something more than filmed entertainment: it aspires to be something 
truly powerful, to depict something brutally horrifying and find the 
inner beauty deep inside it, somewhere.  It begs to search the souls of 
men to find the evils and the goods, and tries to explain, give some 
rationale as to man's most tragic failings.  It is a film about how men 
can fall to their most inner hatreds, and how some special men can 
overcome their many failings to emerge as intensely flawed heroes.  In a 
sense, SCHINDLER'S LIST depicts the personal journey of one man, and the 
massive journey of one race, as they both somehow interweave through the 
fates of history's most brutal massacre.  There is that deep sense of 
ominous foreboding, as if we know this story, but the brutal realities 
of it being displayed on screen disturb us, make us vomit and retch, and 
cleanse us of the inner demons which cause man to do such crimes.  And 
yet, there is a flicker, a barely noticeable candle of hope in the 
deepest despair, there is a shining example of what man can be, instead 
of what he often is.  SCHINDLER'S LIST probably probes man's fate in the 
world more than any film since possibly 2001. </P>
<P>The film, on a personal level, concentrates on the remarkable story 
of Oskar Schindler (Neeson), a German businessman, a womanizer, drinker, 
chain-smoker, greedy, self-centered member of the Nazi party.  Schindler 
is lazy, conceited, and finds joy in the one thing that shall make him 
the most money: war.  He is a classic example of the "war 
profiteer".  At the start of the film, Schindler purchases an enamel 
factory, through which he wishes to make pots and pans for the German 
army, as well as armaments if necessary.  He decides to employs Jews in 
the ghettos of Poland, due to their cheap labor cost, and works with 
Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern (Kingsley) to find Jewish partners to 
gain investors and make his supplies.  Stern comes up with the ingenious 
idea to save those who have no "essential" skills: teachers, 
musiciens, rabbis, and the handicapped, and labels them as 
"essential workers", allowing them to work in Schindler's 
factory.  During the film's middle portion, Spielberg shifts his focus 
from Schindler to the Holocaust in general, and in particular to 
Commandant Amon Goeth (Fiennes), who is in charge of the ghetto, and 
later moves all the Jews to a forced labor camp.  Schindler becomes 
close friends with Goeth in order to have his factory run even within 
the walls of the camp, but he slowly sees the monstrosities committed by 
the Nazis to his workers, and to others.</P>
<P>During moments of the second act, Spielberg focuses on children.  
There are unforgettable moments of power when Spielberg shows the 
inhumane cruelty suffered by innocent children, and the changes that 
happen to these little boys and girls, no older than 10 or 11.  
Spielberg has often been accused of oversentimentality: there is one 
portion, when he colors the coat of a girl as she is walking through the 
ghetto, intercutting with Schindler watching her.  It can be said that 
this is a "Spielbergian" touch of audience manipulation.  
However, Spielberg isn't looking for that: he is demonstrating, in 
frightening terms, the intensenly personal effects of the Holocaust.  So 
often, 11 million people are reduced to a number.  Spielberg is able to 
cast every single one of those 11 million people, including the millions 
of children, into real people in one devastating shot where the red coat 
is on a conveyer belt full of dead bodies.  It is a stunning example of 
how truly atrocious this time period was.</P>
<P>The third act is where Schindler creates his list.  The flawed war 
profiteer has chosen to stop the madness that has been unjustly going 
on.  He spends his entire fortune, bankrupts himself, and literally 
purchases 1000 lives from Goeth.  He takes these 1000 people away from 
the death camps, and puts them to work in his factory, saving them from 
the horrors that were to happen to them.  Kingsley delivers history's 
judgement of Oskar Schindler in a moving scene: "He who saves one 
life, saves the world entire."  It is a touching moment in a film 
full of intensely touching moments.  By this time, the audience has been 
purely devastated in immense heartache: there is no more that can be 
done to further impact a viewer.</P>
<P>When SCHINDLER'S LIST was profiled on AFI's top 100 list, the 
reviewer said that SCHINDLER'S LIST was able to capture death more 
realistically than anything ever before seen.  Death is so realistic 
that it touches the viewer dramatically.  Surely, the brilliant decision 
to film in black and white is a reason, and for that Spielberg and 
Janusz Kaminski have to be thanked.  It is a stunning example of 
cinematography never before experienced on screen.  The script, by 
Hollywood's premier writer of serious fare, is ingenious, deftly mixing 
in humor at times to give the audience the further impression that this 
was real, that this actually happened.  John Williams turns in his most 
moving and haunting score, with sounds that are simply breathtaking.  
The repeating melody is as tragic and somber as anything ever before 
composed.</P>
<P>The perfomances are downright exquisite.  Neeson makes his career 
with a stunning performance that lifts him into the stratosphere of 
great actors.  Kingsley is absolutely magnificent, but the true 
discovery is Ralph Fiennes's dramatically scary turn as Amon Goeth.  
This is one cold-hearted killer, with a complicated, twisted 
personality.  Fiennes is so scary that I still have nightmares of Amon 
Goeth, coming with his gun to shoot me in the snow, make my blood just 
sink into the white surface, like ink spilled on a page.  It is one of 
the century's most horribly frightening, disgustingly repulsing, truly 
brilliant performances. </P>
<P>SCHINDLER'S LIST is as raw, as punishing, as brilliant, and as 
hopeful as film has ever been on screen.  It is a brutal example of what 
film can do, pushed to its highest limits and taken to its most extreme 
bounds.  It is without a doubt Steven Spielberg's greatest acheivement, 
and one of the greatest films of all time.  Remarkably clear, poignantly 
devastating, and lovingly portrayed by a filmmaker who knows the true 
power of his art, SCHINDLER'S LIST is the best film is a generation, and 
one of the most inspired pieces of art in history.  Magnificent.</P>
