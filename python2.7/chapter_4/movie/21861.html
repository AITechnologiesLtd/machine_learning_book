<P>"A bear in his natural habitat... a Studebaker." --Fozzie Bear, The
Muppet Movie </P>
<P>What do you get if you cross a bug-eyed, banjo-strummin' frog, a
wisecracking bear, a love-struck pig with delusions of grandeur, a
brilliant script, astonishingly catchy music, and cinematography that
occasionally borders on magic? Well, in this state you'd probably get
arrested... but that's okay, because you'd also get one of the most
charming and endearing films to claw its way out of the 1970s. </P>
<P>The continuing appeal of The Muppet Movie is easy to understand after
a viewing or two. It's a fun film, featuring some of cinema's
loveliest melodies (both the musical score and its mesmerizing
signature tune, "Rainbow Connection," were nominated for Oscars). But
"fun" doesn't necessarily equate with "greatness," and it's not the
only justification for the film's continued popularity. It touches a
nerve with viewers. Its simple message ('Believe in yourself, and
nothing is beyond your reach') is one we all want to believe... and in
the hectic '90s, with weekly political scandals and perpetual conflict
in the Middle East, we can all use some quality time with the Muppets
and their values. </P>
<P>Kermit the Frog (voiced by the late Jim Henson) is a simple fellow. He
lives in a swamp, and passes the time by singing songs and catching
flies, yet somehow he feels unfulfilled. A passing fisherman (Dom
DeLuise), who moonlights as a Hollywood agent, encourages the talented
frog to consider a career in show business. Kermit is still hesitant,
until the agent mentions that Kermit's talent could entertain millions
of people. Wanting nothing more than to share his gifts with the
world, Kermit sets off for Hollywood (by bicycle, no less! The sight
is a visual marvel!) to seek his fortune. Along the way, he meets a
number of other friends, all of whom have the same dream. The most
significant of these are the amiable Fozzie Bear (voiced by Frank Oz),
whose dream of being a stand-up comic is not at all hindered by the
fact that his act isn't the least bit funny; the lovely Miss Piggy (Oz
again), who falls hard for the dapper Kermit; and the strange
turkey-like Gonzo (Dave Goelz) a plumber who dreams of being... well,
a plumber. But having nothing better to do, he tags along for the
ride. </P>
<P>And what a ride it is! The Muppet Movie is not just another 90-minute
kiddie flick, like so many of today's so-called family films. No, this
one is the real thing: a warm comedy, with a message that actually
says something significant to its audience; as such, it can be enjoyed
by parents and kids alike. As with their spiritual ancestors, Rocky
and Bullwinkle, the Muppets' humor is sophisticated enough to offer
smiles and laughs to all ages. Kids will laugh at Gonzo's physical
stunts, while Mom and Dad will smile at the clever verbal jokes and
visual gags that sail right over Junior's head (the piano player who
looks just like Elton John, the recurring "hare krishna" motif, etc). </P>
