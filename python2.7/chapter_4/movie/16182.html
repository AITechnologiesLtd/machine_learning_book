<PRE>Review:                THE THIN RED LINE</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:        Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, Jim Caviezel, Ben Chaplin,
                Adrien Brody, George Clooney, John Cusack,
                Woody Harrelson, John Travolta, etc.</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by:        Terrence Malick</PRE>
<PRE>Review by:        Joy Wyse, the SILVER Screen Critic</PRE>
<P>There are not very many veterans of World War II alive today and those
are at least seventy years of age.  To most viewers of The Thin Red Line
the battles of Guadalcanal seem to have merely lasted a few days instead
of the long, bloody, dragged- out siege that it was.</P>
<P>Director Malick has tried to convey the futility of war through the eyes
and reactions of the soldiers, particularly those of Private Fife who has
come to love and appreciate the native life of the pre-battle islanders. 
Using flashbacks Malick jumps from savage shooting to children swimming
underwater, and back again.  There are too many of these cutaway shots.  A
little symbolism goes a long way.</P>
<P>Many of the `stars' who appear are nothing more than cameos.  John
Travolta, portraying the General in charge, looks surprisingly reminiscent
of John Hodiak, a handsome star of the WWII era.  George Clooney has but
one scene as well.  It is said that his role was longer, but was cut. 
Bill Pullman is there, too, but don't blink or you'll miss him.  He says
nothing.</P>
<P>One of the best vignettes is by Woody Harrelson as a well-trained and
dedicated career soldier.  His act of heroism is so well enacted that it's
almost overlooked for what it is.</P>
<P>Others have lauded Nick Nolte, as the psychotic colonel who is determined
to secure the `hill' despite the costs, as an Oscar caliber role.  It is
almost one-dimensional, however, and Sean Penn'' portrayal of the sergeant
serving under his command, is much better.</P>
<P>Some of the best acting is from the unknown actors.  Adrien Brody, Jim
Caviezel and Ben Chaplin are standouts.  Their characters seem a bit
confusing at times as they resemble each other and all those uniforms are
alike.  Even the officers forego wearing insignia.  It is especially
difficult to identify some of the voice-over narration.</P>
<P>Several of the scenes are unusually disturbing such as the American GI
who carries pliers with him to extricate gold teeth from the dead…and
dying. And there are the dogs feasting on the corpses.</P>
<P>It is very long, needlessly long and so I only give it a B-. I don't want
to see it again, and neither does my husband, a WWII veteran.</P>
<PRE>SEE YOU AT THE MOVIES.</PRE>
