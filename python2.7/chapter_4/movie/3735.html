<PRE>                             BATMAN FOREVER
                       A film review by Rob Furr
                        Copyright 1995 Rob Furr</PRE>
<P>     You know, it's a darn good thing that BATMAN FOREVER isn't dull.
We'd be suffering through eight million reviews, all using the same "It
certainly *felt* like forever..." gag, and if that happened, I'd be
forced to flee the country and watch no movies younger than thirty
years.</P>
<P>     That's the best place to start a review of BATMAN
FOREVER--whatever else you can say about it, it certainly isn't
dull.  If anything, at times, a little dullness would be a good
thing, just so that the audience would have time to grasp the latest
complication.  I mean, THE DRAUGHTSMAN'S CONTRACT this ain't, but it
has more stuff actually happening in it than any three other summer
movies I can name (So far, anyway.) There's the Riddler's origin,
there's Two-Face's story, there's Robin's origin, there's the
obligatory Batman/Blonde In A Black Outfit love story, there's action,
there's street combat, there's chase sequences, ritzy parties, Jim
Carrey's stand-up routine, and, amazingly enough, a giant blender with
fins (we'll get to that later).  There is, to be blunt, so much stuff
happening that, even at an approximately two-hour running length, the
movie bulges at the seams, to the point where aspects of the plot, such
as it is, whiz past unnoticed because something else is already shoving
its way forward for its second-and-a-half of screen time.</P>
<P>     Not only is there a lot happening in the plot, there's a lot
happening visually.  I'll be frank--the original BATMAN is a hard act
to beat, in terms of production style--it is, as far as I'm concerned,
the only movie Tim Burton's ever done where his Gothic obsessions work
(they certainly didn't in BATMAN RETURNS)--and BATMAN FOREVER doesn't
beat it.  It doesn't even try to do so.  Burton chose to model his
Gotham on Gothic elements, on shades of gray, on noir and
Piranesi--this more recent Gotham is full of strong primary colors, and
more humanistic design.  It's still recognizably the same city as
Burton's, but the Gotham we see in BATMAN FOREVER looks like it's
actually been lived in, like it *could* be lived in.  There's no space
for humanity in Burton's Gotham, but there is in this one.
Furthermore, BATMAN FOREVER succeeds at doing what DICK TRACY only
dreamed of doing.  Not only is BATMAN FOREVER's Gotham more colorful
than Burton's, it's more faithful to the Gotham of the comic books--it
*looks* like what comics look like after they've been projected in the
theatre of our imagination.  The camera often swoops around buildings,
it falls down, it moves as fast and as smoothly as the comic reader's
eye seems to (yes, eye movements are actually rather jerky and
sudden--but it doesn't seem that way to the person behind the organic
camera...).  The production design in BATMAN FOREVER seems designed to
have something on the screen at all times that captures the eye, or
leads it, or draws the viewer's attention in or moves it aside.  Just
as it seems at times to be overplotted, it may even be overdesigned.
At the very least, it demands a second viewing, for the simple reason
that familiarity with the most obvious objects on screen will allow the
observer to see everything else crammed into a single frame.  There
are, of course, occasional false notes in the production design, the
most obvious of which is, er, the giant blender with fins.  I can't
really explain why there's a giant blender with fins, not without
spoiling the climax of the movie (although I think it's not exactly a
spoiler to mention that, not only is it a giant blender with fins, it
eventually becomes a giant *exploding* blender with fins.)</P>
<P>     I'm now forced to divide my critical response, which is
appropriate, considering that Two-Face is in this movie.  I can respond
to BATMAN FOREVER on its own terms, and I can respond to it based on
the fact that I've been reading BATMAN and DETECTIVE for decades.  Own
terms first, I suppose.</P>
<P>     This is a very funny movie at times.  There are the gags and lines
that we've all seen and heard in the promos and trailers--but those
are, amazingly enough, neither the funniest of the gags nor all of the
lines.  Jim Carrey, furthermore, is not the funniest actor in the film,
either.  This should come as no surprise to those of us (all, what,
three?) who saw Val Kilmer in TOP SECRET!, but for those who haven't:
Val Kilmer can be very funny when he wants to be, and, quite often in
this film, he wants to be.  Carrey, on the other hand, does his
standard schtick.  Okay, it was funny at times on IN LIVING COLOR, it
was funny in ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE, and it was even funny in THE
MASK, but honest to Pete, we've *seen* him posture, we've *seen* him
twist that rubber face of his around, and, okay, yes, he's moderately
amusing in BATMAN FOREVER, but the novelty's worn off.  Tommy Lee Jones
is also ... less interesting than he should be.  Apparently someone
handed him a copy of all the scenes from BATMAN with Jack Nicholson in
them and said "See this? That's your role.  Oh, but you only have to
put makeup on half your face.  Ciao." As a villain, he's okay.  Which
is, sadly, not enough (fortunately, the movie doesn't rest on his
shoulders.)</P>
<P>     Which brings us to the really unique point of BATMAN FOREVER.
This is the first Batman movie (of the recent three) where Batman/Bruce
Wayne is more interesting than the villain(s).  I was shocked.  A
Batman movie where BRUCE WAYNE gets screen time? And it's a
*believable* Bruce Wayne? Holy smokes, wake the kids, call the
neighbors.  After the disastrous (and misnamed) BATMAN RETURNS (Batman
didn't return--he didn't even get any screen time) I fully expected
this to be another villain-based outing, where Bruce Wayne and his
blonde-in-black would be relegated to about fifth in order of
importance.  Fortunately, I was wrong.  The protagonist is really the
protagonist for once.  Wow.</P>
<P>     (And now, my reaction based on the fact that I've been a Batman
fan since before Batman was cool again:)</P>
<P>     This is Two-Face?  Huh?  Since when was Two-Face like *this*?
Threw *me* for a loop, I can tell you.</P>
<P>     On the plus side, though, BATMAN FOREVER is more aware of the rest
of the Batman phenomenon than any previous film.  Concepts and scenes
are taken directly from BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, references are
made to, for instance, Metropolis and other parts of the DC Universe,
it occasionally slyly pokes fun at itself and its predecessors. (I will
bet you *any* amount of money that you will *not* expect (unless
someone tells you) what Robin says as the two heroes first encounter
the Riddler's base at close hand.  Whee!)</P>
<P>     (This concludes my fan-based reaction.  Thank you.)</P>
<P>     At any rate, since any plot summary would take too long, and,
besides, you already know the important bits, I'll skip the
play-by-play and go straight to the box scores:</P>
<P>     BATMAN FOREVER was a surprise.  Not only did it have, amazingly
enough, a real, live plot, not only did it have mostly original
production design, not only did it have decent acting all around
(except for, sadly, the two villains,) it had more fun with itself than
Burton ever allowed his films to have.  On the Furr Scale (I rate films
based on ambition as well as quality: you can't rate a film like EVIL
DEAD II on the same scale as LAWRENCE OF ARABIA without acknowledging
the fact that the two movies were trying to do different things.  EVIL
DEAD II was a four-star one-star film:  a very, very good movie that
didn't aim very high, while LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is a four-star four-star
movie: a very, very good movie that aimed very high.  ROBOCOP is a
three-star three star movie (pretty good, aimed pretty high,) and
HEAVEN'S GATE is a one-star four star movie (a rotten movie that aimed
high.)) I'll call BATMAN FOREVER a three-star three star movie.  As
long as you don't expect the bad guys to carry the film, and as long as
you can keep up with the film's rapid and diffuse plotting, you should
have a blast.</P>
