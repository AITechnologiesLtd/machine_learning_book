<PRE>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A>
"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>There's something admirable about a film that manages to entertain
despite not making any sense at all.  As you sit through films like Gone
in 60 Seconds, your brain practically screams, `Get up and leave before
you rot me away!' but the message never quite makes it down to your
feet.  Somewhere in between your head and toes, something happens that
makes you sit there with a dopey grin on your face for two hours before
getting up and admitting `Geez, that was pretty good.'  Personally, I
blame the sneaky epiglottis for intercepting the brain's warning
message, but I have no concrete proof of this.</P>
<P>Seconds is about a retired car thief named Randall "Memphis" Raines
(Nicolas Cage, Bringing Out the Dead) who is temporarily drafted back
into a life of crime when his younger brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi,
Boiler Room) ends up in hot water with a local bad ass with an English
accent and a fetish for handcrafted wooden furniture.  The Brit is
Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston, eXistenZ), and he turns down
Memphis' offer of $10,000 for Kip, instead making the older Raines
brother agree to boost fifty specific automobiles in four days to
prevent him from becoming an only child.</P>
<P>It doesn't take long to set up the film's premise (about fifteen
minutes), and I settled back in my seat under the assumption that I was
in for a good hour-and-a-half of car boosting and the hilarious hijinks
attendant thereto.  But Seconds doesn't go down like that.  While the
bottom of the screen reminds viewers that there are only seventy-two
hours remaining in Memphis' deadline, he has a touchy-feely breakfast
with Kip.  Wait a second.  Kip?  Why the heck would Calitri let Kip go?
Couldn't he just skip town with Memphis and his $10,000 and leave
Calitri and the car-jacking business behind them?</P>
<P>Memphis blows the next few days visiting his mom (Grace Zabriskie, Twin
Peaks) and trying to put together a team of top-notch car thieves.  He
starts with the man that taught him everything he knows: former
chop-shop owner Otto Halliwell (Robert Duvall, A Civil Action).
Together, Memphis and Otto complete the rest of their lawbreaking
lineup.  The ranks include a mechanic/bartender named Sara "Sway"
Wayland (Angelina Jolie, Girl, Interrupted), a mute morgue attendant
called `The Sphinx' (Vinnie Jones, Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels),
and a driving instructor named Donny Astricky (Chi McBride, Mercury
Rising).  Memphis also reluctantly agrees to let Kip's gang assist in
the heist.  The Gen-Y brigands include Scott Caan  (Ready to Rumble),
James Duval (Go), T.J. Cross and William Lee Scott (Black & White).</P>
<P>Memphis and his criminal comrades plan to steal all fifty cars in one
twelve-hour period.  And not just any twelve-hour period, but, of
course, the twelve-hour period immediately before the deadline (I
shouldn't complain – I waited until the morning of my 12th grade English
class to write my final thesis, even though I had months to complete the
project).  To make matters worse, Memphis and crew are being pursued by
two cops (Delroy Lindo, Romeo Must Die, and Timothy Olyphant, Go), as
well as a rival gang of car thieves that actually complained that
Memphis stole the fifty-car job out from under them.  <Scratch head.>
Okay, let me get this straight:  They're willing to do Calitri's heist,
but he insists on using a rusty ex-thief and his band of miscreants
instead?</P>
<P>You know that the heist is going to go down to the wire, which begs the
question `Why didn't they start earlier?'  There's the mandatory chase
through the L.A. River Aqueduct (which, at this point, is used only for
filming Hollywood chase scenes), and the big shoot-‘em-up action finale
is so ridiculously unbelievable that I couldn't help laughing out loud.
And don't get up and leave when the big chase scene is over, because
you'll miss Jones' hysterical, out-of-the-blue line, which is probably
the best since Alyson Hannigan's `One time, in band camp…' confession in
American Pie.</P>
<P>There are so many things in Seconds that just don't make sense, and I'm
not sure I even have the space to list all of them here.  Like when the
bandits break into a warehouse full of about fifty rare, expensive cars,
and the five that they need to boost are all lined up behind one another
for easy removal.  And how do you explain that each thief gets back out
on the streets after they drop off the car they've just stolen?  Seconds
isn't even sure what city it's supposed to take place in, mentioning
Long Beach several times, but filming multiple scenes in San Francisco
in addition to the Los Angeles suburb.</P>
<P>Seconds is also full of all of the spastic editing, plot-holes and lack
of female characters that you come to expect from a Jerry Bruckheimer
(Armageddon) produced summer blockbuster.  In addition to inciting the
audience to root against the police and for the criminals, Seconds also
features a couple of pretty bad racial stereotypes (black people can't
swim and Asian women can't drive).</P>
<P>Seconds was directed by Dominic Sena (Kalifornia) and written by Scott
Rosenberg (ConAir), who adapted the script from a little-seen 1974 H.B.
Halicki film of the same name (it spawned a sequel called The Junkman
eight years later).  Despite its many flaws, Seconds is still worth the
price of admission just for the unique and diverse casting, which
includes big-name stars, regulars in independent cinema, a British
soccer star and – get this – three Oscar winners (Cage, Jolie and
Duvall).</P>
<P>1:52 - PG-13 for violence, adult situations and language</P>
