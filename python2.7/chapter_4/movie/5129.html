                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  ***  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1990)</PRE>
<P>        In 1983, Paul Brickman took the world by storm with his directorial
debut, RISKY BUSINESS.  Seven years later, the director finally has a new
movie to unleash on the world, and after a 7 year wait, it had better be
good.  And MEN DON'T LEAVE is pretty good, or at least sort of pretty good.
The movie is exceptionally funny: it's funny when it's supposed to be
funny and, unfortunately, it's also funny when it's not supposed to be
funny.</P>
<P>        Jessica Lange plays a plain housewife whose husband dies in an
accident, leaving her with two sons to raise and a $63,000 debt to pay off.
What is a single, unskilled mother to do?  The answer: sell the pickup
truck, sell her beautiful country home, and move to Baltimore where she has
been offered a job in a gourmet food shop.  Lange quickly discovers that
life in the big, bad city is no picnic.  First of all, her apartment is
small and stuffy.  Second, she has an incredibly bitchy boss.  Third, her
temperamental 17-year-old son is having an affair with a nurse who is in
her 20's.  Fourth, she is growing apart from her 10-year-old son; he would
rather sleep at his friend's house than at home.  It's enough to make a
struggling mother depressed and lethargic; it's enough to make her stay in
bed for five days straight.  It's enough, at times, to make you laugh when
you're not supposed to.  In fact, the audience at the preview screening
came down with a collective case of the giggles, due in part to Lange's
histrionics and in part to some strategically timed sneezing by someone in
the fifth row.</P>
<P>        If I seem to be mocking the film, it's because, however
well-intentioned, it simply asks you to swallow too much melodrama.  The
script, by Brickman and Barbara "Big Chill" Benedek, tries to emulate TERMS
OF ENDEARMENT, but it never quite makes it.  The humor is right on target,
but the drama is slightly off-kilter.  Part of the problem is that Lange
isn't always convincing as the somber, dysfunctional mother, and you
sometimes have trouble feeling sorry for her.</P>
<P>        Fortunately, the supporting cast is magnificent and keeps the film
from crumbling.  Joan Cusack is delightfully goofy (as usual) as the nurse
who likes to "help people."  Cusack is quickly becoming Hollywood's
definitive eccentric and one of its best character actors.  Arliss Howard
gains our sympathy as Lange's persistent suitor, a sensitive musician who
sees past her melancholy exterior.  The real stand-outs, however, are Chris
O'Donnell and Charlie Korsmo.  The two young actors are deeply moving as
Lange's sons, Chris and Matt, who are having a tough time grappling with
their father's death and with the culture shock of moving to Baltimore.
Korsmo, as 10-year-old Matt, will simply break your heart.  He falls under
the influence of a tough city kid and becomes a burglar, stealing VCRs to
raise money for lottery tickets.  The film is extremely effective when it
shifts its attention from Lange to the two boys.  In fact, the powerful
finale strikes an emotional chord and turns the audience into a symphony of
sniffles.  MEN DON'T LEAVE is a solid, entertaining melodrama, but it's not
the profoundly moving masterpiece it wants to be.</P>
