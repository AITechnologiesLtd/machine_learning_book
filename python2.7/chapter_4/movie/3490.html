<PRE>                          WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     This makes for a very light romantic comedy.  If you are not
looking for anything deeper,  you will find it entertaining.</P>
<P>     Poor but winsome Lucy (Sandra Bullock) works as a cashier at an
elevated station in Chicago, about as dull a job as one could find.
The only bright spot in her day is the handsome man she sees each
morning as he is about to board his train.  They've never spoken; in
fact he does not even know she exists. That is the extent of Lucy's
love life.</P>
<P>     Because Lucy has no real excuse not to work on holidays she is
always talked into doing so; other cashiers have family with whom to
celebrate but for Lucy one day is like the next ... except this day
unexpected things happen.  The man she has a thing for, the one who
shows up every day, is Peter (Peter Gallagher).  For him it turns out
to be a different kind of day, too, as he gets mugged and pushed onto
the tracks.  Lucy races out of the booth, jumps onto the tracks and
saves Peter (and herself) by rolling away from the oncoming train.
Peter, however, ends up in a coma.</P>
<P>     At this point a comedy of errors begins to occur.  Lucy visits
Peter but not being family, she is not allowed to see him.  A nurse
mistakenly surmises that she is his fiancee and allows her into the
room.  When his family arrives, the nurse innocently introduces Lucy as
Peter's fiancee.  He is still in coma.</P>
<P>     Jack (Bill Pullman) is Peter's suspicious brother. Their father is
played by Peter Boyle, the mother is Micole Mercurio, and Glynis Johns
is the grandmother.  Jack Warden is Peter's Godfather.  Everyone
(almost) is overjoyed with Lucy.</P>
<P>     Like all romantic comedies, this one has its twists and its happy
ending.  Sandra Bullock looks lovely and wistful and cute and the
camera keeps focussing on her until I was ready to cry "enough!" But
that is only a small complaint.  It is not IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT but
for light comedy it suffices.</P>
