<P>In Brief: An awful lot better than I thought it would be. Definitely
designed to appeal to an elite taste, but it's well written, well performed
and quite charming nonetheless.</P>
<P>Just the other week I reviewed ROMY AND MICHELLE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION, and
this week it's CLUELESS. You might well worry about the fact I've been
watching too many "chick flicks", but the main reason is it's cheaper to
watch and review videos that my sister has hired than it is to pay for my
own ones! So, that's my reasoning. :-) To be honest, I didn't think
CLUELESS sounded particularly interesting, and I wasn't expecting a great
deal from it.</P>
<P>I was actually pleasantly surprised with what I saw. This could easily have
been a feature film version of the dreaded CLARISSA EXPLAINS IT ALL -- a
rather excruciating US 'sitcom', for those of you blissfully ignorant,
about an annoying all-American teen girl stereotype. One first glance the
two looked startlingly similar. CLUELESS is about…yup, an all-American teen
girl stereotype, living in Beverly Hills. But, mercifully, the film is a
full hundred-percent less irritating and stilted than the aforementioned
series, and actually quite well-written and acted.
But like I said, it was treading near potentially dangerous territory.
Films about airhead American teenagers who have a lot more money than
brains have become something of a cliché, based on some sort of parody of
American teenagers in general. It was a novelty when this whole sub-genre
began (a lot inspired by BILL AND TED, perhaps?) but as with all things
cinematic, over-use tends to generate boredom. Luckily Clueless is a cut
above the rest, largely due to clever, sharp scripting with just the right
degree of self-indulgence to draw you into the story.</P>
<P>That said, it's not a film that'll appeal to everyone. It's obviously
targeted at teenage girls (my seventeen year old sister loves it), and I
don't suppose anyone over twenty-five will get much out of the film. I'm
not a girl, but I am a teenager, so I guess I fall into part of that
demographic! And I did, as I said, rather enjoy the film. I've certainly
been exposed to far worse in my time.</P>
<P>Alicia Silverstone does a marvellous job breathing charm and wit into a
potentially unsympathetic role, and she's a joy to watch. Other standout
performances include that of Dan Hedaya as Cher's grumpy father, who's a
delight to watch (Cher: "Daddy, this is my new friend Tai…" Daddy: "Get out
my chair!") and veteran character actor Wallace Shawn as Cher's lovelorn
teacher. </P>
<P>The last twenty minutes or so get a bit too bogged-down by focussing too
much Cher's love-life, forsaking the happy-go-lucky wit of the film's first
hour or so, but it still remains an enjoyable, well-performed and rather
endearing diversion. Worth a look, though - not to be ageist or anything -
it'll probably appeal more to the younger generation.</P>
