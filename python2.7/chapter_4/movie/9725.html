<PRE>Rebel Without A Cause
Director: Nicholas Ray
Starring: James Dean, Natalie Wood, Sal Mineo, Jim Backus
Approx Running Time:</PRE>
<P>Rebel Without A Cause spoke to an entire generation of young men and women,
struggling with thier own identities, while living in the confining 1950s. It
taught them how to speak for themself, laugh at authority and wear blue
jeans. But that generation is now in control of this country. They are in
their 50's now, long since moved on from their teen years, and they should
have taken Rebel Without A Cause with them.</P>
<P>James Dean's most breakthrough film, the picture that would have made him one
of the biggest stars in history (and three films alone almost put him there),
does not stand the test of time. Frankly, I don't see how it even stood at
all during the 50's, for bad filmmaking has always been bad. Nicholas Ray
does some interesting things with the camera, has some thought-provoking
metaphorical and symbolic aspects, but fails from a directorial standpoint,
as does the film's screenwriter with his ludicrous story.</P>
<P>The biggest problem with Rebel Without A Cause is what it asks us to accept.
The film opens with Jim Stark (James Dean) being hauled into a juvenile
detention center for public drunkedness. He is a lost and confused soul
because his mother dominates his immasculine father. The next day, he begins
school, and the major events of the film unfold. This is where the tall tale
begins. Jim matures from new kid on the block to punk veteran in the course
of one day. We see him snubed by the pretty girl on campus (Natalie Wood) in
the morning. He's challenged to a knife fight by mid-afternoon, and he gets
the girl and becomes Mr. Cool Rebel by midnight. The tough-guy character of
Buzz is a violent punk, but he comes off like a pussycat. Right before the
Chicken Race, he tells Jim how much he likes him personally, though just
hours before they were slashing each other with switchblades. Judy (Wood) is
Buzz's main squeeze, but when he dies in the Chicken Race, she immediately
falls for the now-cool Jim Stark. By midnight, she is professing her deep
love for him.</P>
<P>Though James Dean gives a fantastic performance, he and all the other teens,
save for Sal Mineo, look more like they are ready to graduate from college
than from high school. Because of that, Mineo, the only one who does look
like a high schooler doesn't fit in! He too gives a fine performance as a
crazed, confused youth, looking for normalcy and a family life.</P>
<P>Basically, all three main characters, Jim, Judy and Plato (Mineo) are looking
for a family that they can't have except with each other. Jim has a weak
father (Jim Backus, who looks stunning in a frilly kitchen apron) who won't
take a stand against his wife. Judy doesn't get the affection she needs from
Daddy, and Plato is being raised by a housekeeper. But only Plato's rage and
confusion is understandable. We never meet his parents, because neither of
them is around for him. But Jim's parents are quite normal (with the average
family quirkiness) He could do a lot worse. But there is never any foundation
laid for his emotional problems. He is reckless, but why? Because his loving
parents aren't quite loving enough? Because the film essentially takes place
in a 24 hr. period, we never get a feeling of why he is the way he is. </P>
<P>The unrealistic time frame and lack of proper character development make me
wonder why this is regarded as one of the most woderful films of the 50's.
One should only see this film for Dean's performance and perhaps to see what
all the hoopla is about. Should you happen to check it out in it's newest
form, Warner' Bros. widescreen editon, you may be interested in the 25 minute
trailer that shows parts of a TV show hosted by Gig Young. It has behind the
scenes looks at the filming (though the "behind the scene" part is very
stagey) and contains interviews with Jim Backus and James Dean. But by all
means, if you havn't seen it, view this "classic" and come to your own
conclusions.</P>
<P>1 1/2 out of 4 stars
