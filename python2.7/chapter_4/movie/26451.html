Ventana) and Jeremy Piven (Detective Steve Menteer). PG-13.</P>
<P>Fact. American cinema is increasingly youth-oriented as well as 
youth-depicting. Fact. The increase of independent films keeps adding 
to "youthism" in subjects, characters and film-makers.  Fact. Mature 
characters are getting more and more rare. Fact. Older characters are 
even rarer. Fact. Among the summer flicks of 2000 A.D. "Space 
Cowboys" was a relative rarity for its starring a bunch of old (and 
well-known) actors.
Fact.  On slim evidence, the addition of "The Crew" and its senior 
citizens has caused many to speak of a tendency-- which is a non-fact.</P>
<P>Though not too numerous, movies starring old people have always 
existed. Think of geezer films (several with George Burns or Walter 
Matthau, whether together or not) such as Kotch, The Sunshine Boys, 
Going in Style, Where's Poppa?, Wrestling Ernest Hemingway (with 
Robert Duvall and Richard Harris), Going in Style, Grumpy Old Men, 
the recent (1999) The Straight Story, etc.. plus action movies --from 
cop stories to classic, elegiac westerns like The Man Who Shot 
Liberty Valance, Ride the High Country or John Wayne's swan-song The 
Shootist.</P>
<P>In conclusion, "The Crew" is not as noticeable for its cast's age as 
it is for being a truly bad film about old fellows. These are a 
quartet of four wiseguys (gangsters) from New Jersey, old pals and 
collaborators whom the too- lengthy opening sequences (with other 
players) first depict as they were in their prime.</P>
<P>Those scenes make the mistake of trying to show them both as jolly 
goodfellows and as ruthless killers,  two ingredients that simply do 
not blend. Then the  film jumps ahead to today. The foursome, oddly 
still together,  is in unhappy retirement at Miami's South Beach. 
They all have physical and pecuniary problems aggravated by the 
contrasts with the swinging, shapely and moneyed youths of the place. 
Dreyfuss (whose real age is 52) is somehow the unelected leader of 
the group, where the others' ages run from 60 to 65.</P>
<P>Their day-to-day life includes touches often lifted from other movies 
and, in the new context, not especially funny. (Yes, I forgot to 
mention that "The Crew" is , in theory, a comedy). When the shabby 
hotel they inhabit becomes a candidate for going upscale --disastrous 
news for the four --the group takes measures which escalate and 
involve quid pro quo. These, in turn, lead to Latino drug lords, the 
local police, and other complications,  not the least of which is 
that Dreyfuss's long-lost daughter is now a cop who just happens to 
get in touch with the crew.</P>
<P>There are some possibilities of acceptable comedy, but the overall 
movie lacks that minimum coherence which -- if you follow my drift -- 
can make  incoherence funny. Instead we get the equivalent of 
disconnected scenes by mediocre standup comics. The  individual gags 
which, in theory, might have worked, get lost in the plethora of 
confusion or forced situations.</P>
<P>Among its capital offenses the movie is steadily vague about its 
characters. These are supposed to be Italian-American hoods as their 
names (plus other signals) indicate, but they come through as vaguely 
Judeo-Italian or Italo-Jewish, down to mannerisms, body and language 
English, expressions, vocabulary, references and so on. The makers 
must have tried very hard to attain this messiness.</P>
<P>Expensive scenes and sets are also wasted, as are, without
exception  all the main characters,  all one-dimensional, from 
headliners to most of the supporting cast. Jennifer Tilly plays a 
prostitute (" the leisure profession " she calls it) with a 
formidable decollete which may be by now her tiresome trademark. 
Laini Kazan, looking wonderful at age 60, has the best of the 
supporting roles.  Though also forced, her performance recalls (very 
distantly) her scene-stealing in 1982's My Favorite Year.</P>
<P>If all sexagenarians were like Lainie, life could be beautiful. But 
what the movie suggests more than anything else is that when you 
reach 60 the best thing you could do is vanish from the face of the 
earth.</P>
