<P>       Retrospective: H.P. Lovecraft's Necronomicon (1992)</P>
<PRE>                        By Robert B. Marks</PRE>
<P>     I am pleased to declare that I discovered H.P. Lovecraft a
short while ago when, out of curiosity, I picked up a copy of his
Dream Cycle.  After finding it to be excellent fiction, I was
hooked: I am now a Lovecraft fan.</P>
<P>     So, when I noticed H.P. Lovecraft's Necronomicon: The Book
of the Dead on a rental outlet shelf, I just had to have a look. 
I was expecting to see some well done Lovecraftian horrors from
the dawn of time, and perhaps even a bit of Cthulhu.  I was both
pleased and disappointed.</P>
<P>     The movie opens with H.P. Lovecraft entering a monastery
with the intention of looking at the Necronomicon, which is under
guard.  As he does so, the odd things which happen around him
serve as a frame for three stories.</P>
<P>     The first story is about a man who returns to his ancestral
home in America and finds a will from one of his ancestors.  The
will talks about how the Necronomicon helped him to resurrect his
dead wife, and the man decides to do the same, only to end up
awakening Cthulhu instead.</P>
<P>     The second story is about a reporter who discovers that
inside a house is a woman who has lived for sixty years without
aging.  The key to this secret of immortality, which is (of
course) found in the Necronomicon, turns out to have a very heavy
price for the reporter.</P>
<P>     The third story is a particularly gruesome tale where a
pregnant cop finds herself in an abandoned building searching for
her partner, who has been carried off by "the butcher".  When she
follows the trail, she finds herself being fed to a monster from
the dawn of time.</P>
<P>     Sadly, the movie very liberally adapts the stories written
by H.P. Lovecraft, and a great deal of style is lost.  However,
the first two are done quite well.  As a Lovecraft affectionado,
I was picking out bits and pieces of what I had read earlier.  I
was particularly impressed with the first story, which could have
been taken word for word from a Lovecraft tale.</P>
<P>     The linkage story, with H.P. Lovecraft reading the
Necronomicon, was a joy.  Not only did it fit nicely into the
Cthulhu mythos, but there were unseen monsters, tentacled horrors
(aside: for some reason Lovecraft had an obsession with two
things: tentacles and cats; cats I can understand, but tentacles
have always puzzled me), and Lovecraft makes a close escape with
the Necronomicon and the knowledge that there are horrible things
around us that we could never imagine.</P>
<P>     It is the third story that rains on the parade.  While
Lovecraft wrote of million-year old horrors, and the monster in
this story is as old as the dinosaurs, graphic dismemberment of
central characters was not something Lovecraft ever practiced. 
The story starts well and is very suspenseful, but once the main
character is betrayed, the story simply becomes a mindless
gorefest with little to do with anything Lovecraft ever wrote.</P>
<P>     The movie also has another failing: it explains very little. 
When I saw it, I saw it with some friends who had never been
exposed to any of Lovecraft's writings.  So, while I was enjoying
the tidbits of Cthulhu and other Lovecraftian horrors, they were
watching the screen in mystification.  This is a film that
actually should have a reading list attached: reading The Call of
Cthulhu before seeing the film helps it make sense, but without
some prior knowledge of Lovecraft, the viewer is lost.</P>
<P>     So, the rating: Necronomicon is not bad at all, with some
strong performances and horrific creatures from the dawn of time
(but, sadly, no cats).  However, the gruesome ending to the third
story and the lack of explanation pull the movie down
considerably, and might even turn people off of a brilliant
writer.  So, the final score is 3/5, with one warning: read The
Call of Cthulhu before you see it.</P>
