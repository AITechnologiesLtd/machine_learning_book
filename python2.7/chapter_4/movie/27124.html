<P>It's a shame that the movie studios had to give away this film's ending in
the trailer. An utter shame. I would have liked to been surprised by what
happened. I would have wanted to go in knowing as little as possible about
the circumstances surrounding the end of this movie, but nooooo, they
wouldn't hear of it. Ugh, I hate when studios mess up my movie experience
like that. Oh well, all the same, I still went to see this movie hoping to
enjoy it, even with the knowledge about its conclusion. I hope that anyone
who goes to see this movie knows as little as possible about the film. It
would be to your advantage. Trust me.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A man consumed by time in his own day-to-day life gets into a major plane
crash, leaving him stranded alone on an island. The movie basically follows
his journey as he attempts to survive and escape the lonely clutches of
island life.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Can a movie that spends about 80% of its runtime alone on an island with one
man actually not be boring? You bet. Especially when it manages to make you
feel as though you are stuck on that very island with him. Here we have a
movie that does not play by the rules of Hollywood. There are no major
sweeping scores or soundtracks. There are no cute supporting players, or
breakout performances by the latest ingenues coming out of Tinseltown. This
film puts you through one of the most authentic plane crashes ever witnessed
on the big screen, and then just as effectively, strands you on an island
with a man just like any other. The journey you take with that person is an
interesting one, and one that held my attention throughout. I honestly
expected to be bored at some point. I was waiting for the whole stint on the
island to weigh down on me or for me to begin counting the number of people
in my theatre, but I thoroughly enjoyed the premise of this film and the
gradual manner in which they allowed its story to build. The film is also
loaded with ironies, of which I am a big fan. But with any film such as
this, chances are that not everyone will be a fan. There is obviously very
little dialogue in the movie, and you're basically living day-by-day with
Tom Hanks, so if he or his predicament doesn't interest you, you're not
likely to care much about any of the film. But it worked just dandy for me.
It's just too bad that I knew how it was gonna end up because of the crappy
trailer that the studios put together (read my complete tirade above),
otherwise the story might've held some suspense in it for me as well.</P>
<P>On the downside, I didn't really get too emotional about the movie. Hanks'
character was interesting to watch, mesmerizing to follow and fulfilling to
witness growing, but I didn't feel much for him, or anyone, at the end of
the movie. Was I supposed to? I think so. I think the story is supposed to
show us how we really don't take the time to appreciate the little things in
our lives, and even though the film does give you a real sense of that, the
relationship element didn't really gel for me. Having said that, the film
still comes through as one of the more original movies of the year, and the
direction by Zemeckis is top-notch. See the movie for its realistic
portrayal of life alone on an island, the terrifying plane crash, the
various adventurous escape attempts by Hanks and even for his performance,
which despite being mostly non-verbal, comes through once again. BTW, the
FedEx company should be nominated for Best Supporting Actor in this film.
Wow. Has there ever been a product placement used so entirely as part of a
movie? Incredible.</P>
