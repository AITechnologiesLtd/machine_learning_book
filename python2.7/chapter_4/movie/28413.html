<P> Disneyís new animated adventure, Atlantis: The Lost Empire, suffers
from a lack of focus.</P>
<P> The feature is an uneasy mix of comedy and action thriller, with a
violence quotient higher than the usual Disney fare.</P>
<P> The body count alone should make parents think twice before allowing
the young ones to visit Atlantis.</P>
<P> Yet the movie seems aimed at them, but the storyline and situations
appear to be tilted toward an older audience.</P>
<P> The toll ó though no actual deaths are shown ó is high. The feature is
riddled with explosions that claim scores, but it all happens so quickly
that the youngest viewers may not even comprehend the consequences.</P>
<P> This is not your fluffy, cuddly Disney. No singing teacups, wacky wort
hogs or talking apes, here.</P>
<P> At about 93 minutes, Atlantis begins rather slowly, building up to the
action sequences. A lot of dialogue and exposition may cause the
youngsters to squirm until the story picks up steam.</P>
<P> The animation, of course, is top-rate. After all, this is Disney. The
composition is multilayered and the water looks so real you think you
might be able to go for a swim. But it lacks the majestic sweep of The
Lion King or the magical texture of Beauty and the Beast.</P>
<P> Atlantisí hero is Milo Thatch, a dreamer who wishes to follow in the
steps of his famed explorer grandfather. His obsession is the lost
continent of Atlantis. Milo claims he knows its location, but, of
course, his ideas are ridiculed at every turn.</P>
<P> An old friend of his grandfatherís ó honoring a wager made with the old
gent ó finances an expedition. The plot thickens as the groupís leader
has a hidden agenda, a point that may be too subtle for some in the
audience to immediately pick up on.</P>
<P> Of course, Milo unknowingly leads his band of craven mercenaries to
Atlantis, and that is when the plot kicks in at full throttle. A battle
sequence involving bi-planes, a hot-air balloon and futuristic-looking
Atlantian airships is exciting ó even if it does feel borrowed from
George Lucas ó but, again, itís a lot of death and destruction.</P>
<P> Atlantisí saving grace is the vocal talent of Michael J. Fox as Milo.
He is a milquetoast-like hero, favoring brains over brawn. He is
childlike and overly enthusiastic about fulfilling his dream of
discovery.</P>
<P> Fox is able to convey all this, making Milo a most likable young chap.</P>
<P> Other voices lending themselves to the proceedings include James Garner
as Commander Rourke, the expedition leader; Cree Summer as Princess Kida
of Atlantis; Leonard Nimoy as the King of Atlantis; Phil Morris as Dr.
Sweet, Jacqueline Obradors as Audrey, the group's precocious mechanic;
Don Novello, basically reprising his Father Guido Sarducci, as
explosives expert Vinny; the late Jim Varney as Cookie; and most
notably, Florence Stanley, as Mrs. Packard, the droll, chain-smoking
communications operator.</P>
<P> Though set in 1914, Atlantis is a very PC outing, with individuals from
every color and gender represented.</P>
<P> Atlantis pales in comparison with some past Disney efforts, most
notably Tarzan and The Lion King. The film does offer some spectacular
animated sequences, but overall it lacks a certain spark. It's a bit
hollow and flaccid.</P>
<P> One clue to the filmís ultimate problem is the number of credited
writers. While the screenplay is credited to Tab Murphy, story credit is
given to co-directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale as well as Joss
Whedon, Bryce Zabel, Jackie Zabel and Murphy.</P>
<P> The very young will view Atlantis as eye-candy, while the older kids
and adults will probably appreciate the storyline and pyrotechnics.</P>
<P> But this is one effort that lacks that fabled Disney magical touch.</P>
