Reviewed March 21, 1999.</P>
<P>As with 1995's "The Bridges of Madison County" and 1997's "Midnight in 
the Garden of Good and Evil," actor-director Clint Eastwood has 
successfully adapted a well-recieved novel to the screen, this time it 
being Andrew Klavan's "True Crime." Although unread by me, this film 
version is a taut, if somewhat overstuffed, suspense-drama, that is 
worlds better than a similar Eastwood picture that was also adapted from 
a novel, 1997's "Absolute Power."</P>
<P>Eastwood stars as crackerjack newspaper reporter Steve Everett, a man 
pushing his late-60's who nonetheless is always getting involved with 
much younger women, and cheating on his wife, Barbara (Diane Venora). 
When a well-liked young colleague of his (Mary McCormack) is in a car 
accident after drinking-and-driving and is killed, Everett finds himself 
getting her original job of interviewing Frank Beachum (Isaiah 
Washington), a black man on death row for a crime he claims he didn't 
commit, only hours before his planned execution that night. Looking 
through the case records, Everett finds that there were two witnesses 
during the fateful day when Frank allegedly went into a convenience 
store and shot and killed the female worker there, who happened to be 
six months pregnant. One of the witnesses only saw Frank run out of the 
store, while the other walked in to only see him holding the gun, but 
neither heard the shot. While investigating the store, Everett discovers 
that the witness' story of seeing Frank with a gun was impossible since 
there was a large stand of potato chips blocking his view. Convinced 
Frank really is innocent, Everett only has a small number of hours to 
find out what actually did happen, so that Frank will be saved from his 
impending death.</P>
<P>As with the superior "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil," one of 
the delights in "True Crime" is Eastwood's, as well as screenwriters' 
Larry Gross, Paul Brickman, and Stephen Schiff, effortless handling of 
the wide array of character, from those already mentioned, to Beachum's 
grieving wife (Lisa Gay Hamilton), Everett's precocious, neglected 
daughter (Eastwood's real-life daughter, Francesca Fisher-Eastwood), and 
Everett's fast-talking editor (James Woods) and edgy co-worker (Denis 
Leary). The treasure of watching these characters is in the writing, 
which might only give some of the people a handful of scenes, but is 
able to develop each one enough so that we feel we know them. On the one 
hand, the many characters and stories swarming around occasionally 
become slightly unbelievable since the movie takes place within a 
24-hour period, but on the other hand, they are very well-done. One of 
the unexpected subplots that snuck up on me and acquired a heartbreaking 
pay-off involved Everett's rocky relationship with his wife, played by 
Venora in an assured, precise turn. All performances, in fact, are 
memorable, but the others that stand out include Washington, who doesn't 
make one false note in portraying a man terrified of dying, and yet 
knows he must be strong for his wife and daughter; Hamilton, who was 
also wonderful in last year's "Beloved"; and Michael Jeter, as one of 
the witnesses who firmly believes Beachum was holding a gun...or does 
he?</P>
<P>At the center of everything is Eastwood in his first screen appearance 
in two years, and he really is very good here, although I did have some 
problems with the way his sex life was portrayed. Portrayed as 
irresisitible to all women, even those still in their teenage years, 
Eastwood has significantly aged recently, looking even slightly older 
than his actual age of 68. Unlike Robert Redford, who is now in his 70's 
and still could pass for a good-looking fiftysomething, Eastwood holds 
no such scrutiny in a plot contrivance that I could have done without.</P>
<P>Another irksome matter, though one that might have stood out even more 
in the hands of a less-professional filmmaker, is the story itself. So 
many similar movies have been made recently about the exact same subject 
(1995's "Dead Man Walking," 1996's "Last Dance," 1996's "The Chamber") 
that there could virtually be a new film genre invented. Even if 
intelligent and effective, Eastwood might have been better off choosing 
a more original premise for a movie he was going to spend at least a 
year of his life on.</P>
<P>Despite its commonplace storyline and a few small qualms, "True Crime" 
is a respectable film, particularly in its unequivocal details involving 
the characters and genuinely unpredictable outcome (even though the very 
last scene didn't quite sit well with me). Clint Eastwood is a true 
craftsman, as he usually proves with each of his directing jobs, and it 
is due largely to his expertise in character and dialogue that "True 
Crime" rises above its tried-and-true plot outline.</P>
