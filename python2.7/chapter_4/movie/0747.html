<PRE>                             THE GUARDIAN
                    A review in the public domain
                            by The Phantom
                      (<A HREF="mailto:baumgart@esquire.dpw.com">baumgart@esquire.dpw.com</A>)</PRE>
<PRE>     In her review of April 27, Janet Maslin writes in the New York Times: </PRE>
<PRE>        When seeking professional childcare help, never hire anyone who
        thinks she is a tree.  This is the lesson of THE GUARDIAN, and
        it's hard to find fault with, although that cannot be said for the
        film otherwise.</PRE>
<P>     Well.  The Phantom must say that he has always been an admirer of the film
reviews in the New York Times; unlike the simple-minded thumbs who "review"
films on television, the Times' reviewers are critics in the best sense of the
word, and their reviews are always well considered and informative.</P>
<P>     So one can understand how flattered the Phantom felt when he read the lead
paragraph of Ms. Maslin's review.  Yet it behooves him to ask, "Now, who's
reading whose reviews here?"  Alas, if only the Phantom got Ms. Maslin's free
preview tickets, let alone her salary....  But for him it is enough to know
that he has found another phan on the staff of his favorite daily.</P>
<P>     Though clever, Maslin's lead paragraph is also very misleading.  To be
fair, the Phantom never expects accurate reviews of horror films from the
Times, but Maslin seems to have missed the point of THE GUARDIAN.  Like most
horror films, THE GUARDIAN doesn't exist to teach us a lesson (unless one
thinks that "Don't go in the basement" is a lesson).  Instead THE GUARDIAN
exists only to entertain and to scare us, and in that capacity it does a very
good job indeed.</P>
<P>     So let's start with a brief summary.  THE GUARDIAN is yet another in a
long line of mainstream "adult" horror films.  Like THE EXORCIST (also by the
director, William Friedkin), THE OMEN, and more recently, CHILD'S PLAY, THE
GUARDIAN is a horror film designed to appeal to those people who would not
otherwise go to a horror film.  And while it's not nearly as successful THE
EXORCIST or THE OMEN, it works about as well as CHILD'S PLAY (though whether it
does as well at the box office remains to be seen) -- in other words, it's not
a classic, but it's pretty good in it's own way.</P>
<P>     The story is fairly simple, if a tad unusual.  Imagine, if you will, that
the Druids were right -- that trees really do have spirits and can exert
influence over people and the world around them.  Now imagine that one of these
Druids is also a nanny.  Still with me?  OK, now to complete our mental
picture, imagine that one of the trees -- an *evil* tree -- demands human
sacrifices, particularly *infant* sacrifices.</P>
<P>     Certainly by its very nature, THE GUARDIAN gives THE FIRST POWER a run for
its money as this year's silliest horror film.  But although it sounds fairly
outlandish, once you buy the premise, THE GUARDIAN is a lot of fun.  Unlike THE
FIRST POWER, THE GUARDIAN starts out silly and stays that way -- in general,
the Phantom prefers films that work like this, rather than ones like THE FIRST
POWER, that start out sensible and promising and end up in a big muddle.</P>
<P>     THE GUARDIAN begins with a bit of explanation -- it seems that the
producers don't believe that their audience would understand what Druids are
without three or four screens worth of explanation.  Unfortunately, the
preamble reminded the Phantom of nothing less than a cross between the
Stonehenge sequence from THIS IS SPINAL TAP and the disclaimer at the beginning
of SCARFACE.  Briefly, the producers want to be sure that everyone understands
that the Druids were an ancient religious sect that worshipped trees, and that
while most Druids (and, presumably, most trees) are fine, upstanding members of
their communities and/or forests, some are just bad seeds -- real rotten apples
-- trees and disciples that have gone over to the Dark Side.  The Phantom
apologizes in advance if he didn't get this part exactly right, but he thinks
that this was the general idea.  Why these trees are evil is never explained --
perhaps they're tired of being turned into press releases and fax paper, or
maybe they've been cheated out of their residuals for THE WIZARD OF OZ -- but
honestly, neither the Phantom nor the twelve-year-olds he was surrounded by
required further explanation.  Evil trees?  No problem!  Once you buy into
pizza-eating turtles and stunt-nuns, your tolerance for cinematic silliness
goes way up.</P>
<P>     Now, the Phantom would normally take some time here to further describe
the plot, but in this case it's hardly necessary, and in fact it might possibly
spoil the film for some.  THE GUARDIAN is not a film that is loaded with
surprises, so the Phantom would feel worse than usual if he gave some of them
away.</P>
<P>     Disappointed?  Oh, all right then, let's give some of them away anyway.
Here goes.  Couple hires nanny, nanny cares for infant, nanny communes with
evil tree, nanny takes infant, couple chases nanny -- you get the idea.
Surprised?</P>
<P>     Well, surprisingly, there *are* some surprises.  For one, there are
several OMEN-like killings done with 90s-style special effects and gore.  For
another, the film doesn't plod along in TV movie-of- the-week fashion -- the
editing, camera work and cinematography are all top-notch.  Friedkin hasn't
lost his touch since his days of directing Linda Blair amidst buckets of pea
soup: THE GUARDIAN looks and feels a lot like the EXORCIST did, and the Phantom
enjoyed that expert look and feel more than he did almost anything else about
the film.  The Phantom was particularly disappointed with Maslin's review in
this respect: she complains that Friedkin concentrates too much on "things
decorative" and sets up shots in forests and meadows so that "viewers are apt
to notice wildflowers in the foreground."  Oh dear.  Isn't that the point?
This film *is*, after all, about evil Druids, so one would think that placing
the characters in the context of the wildlife surrounding them would be
important.  Much better this than the relatively uninspired camera work of THE
FIRST POWER, to pick on our favorite silly horror film yet again.</P>
<P>     For film buffs, Friedkin has also scattered several "inside" references
throughout THE GUARDIAN -- the Phantom caught at least three -- and as the film
progresses it also becomes obvious that Friedkin is nearly as big a phan of
EVIL DEAD as is the Phantom himself (the "basement" scene in particular is
strikingly reminiscent of one of the scenes in EVIL DEAD).  Phans who want the
inside track should pay particularly close attention to the radio programs that
are "overheard" on occasion.</P>
<P>     And those who are not into gore for gore's sake may want to consider
playing peek-a-boo during some scenes; the Phantom himself was surprised at how
far some of the violence went, especially given the supposed "mainstream"
nature of this film.  Unlike, say, HELLBOUND, which was never intended to
appeal to non-horror phans, THE GUARDIAN appears on the surface to have been
designed to appeal to people who don't normally appreciate a good
dismemberment.  To be fair, it never gets nearly as bad as HELLBOUND -- in
fact, the gore-level is about on a par with one of the OMEN sequels (though
nary a priest is wrapped in plastic and set on fire) -- but there are a few
scenes that would do Romero proud.  These trees don't kill people by dropping
acorns on their heads, you know...</P>
<P>     The acting is adequate (with the exception of Jenny Seagrove, whose
performance as the evil nanny is not in the least wooden*), and baby Jake is
definitely cute, even though he is portrayed at times by (in Maslin's words) "a
screaming pile of towels."  The special effects are generally well done, and
although Friedkin seems to have used the same backlot forest that was featured
in LEATHERFACE last year, the meadows are scenic and the film does its best to
imbue what are, after all, just a bunch of plants with evil and ill-meaning
intentions.</P>
<P>     The Phantom really recommends this one, phans; despite its astoundingly
silly plot, and despite some of the negative reviews it has garnered, THE
GUARDIAN is a good, solid 90 minutes of fun with enough scares to keep even the
most jaded horror-film buff on his toes.  It's worth catching before it makes
its Blockbusters debut.</P>
<P>*Yes, all right, that one was a bit of a stretch.  Just be glad the
 Phantom couldn't come up with a good pun for "druid."</P>
