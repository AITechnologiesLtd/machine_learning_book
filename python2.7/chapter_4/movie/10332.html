                        TOMORROW NEVER DIES 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon

<P>In the secret place of every man's heart, there lies a fantasy to be
perfection incarnate. In this fantasy the gentleman is a distinguished
soldier, a polished diplomat and an insatiable lover all rolled into
one. Immaculately clothed, ingeniously armed this warrior/lover creation
of Ian Fleming emerges once again after forty year of immortal
existence. Bring out the caviar, serve the champagne and watch the
spectacular display of destructive fireworks caused by Bond, Mr James
Bond.</P>
<P>It must be Bond's legacy to taste every woman from every walk of life.
If women could be compared to fine food, then my favourite Bond dishes
would be the delectable Honey Ryder submerged in layers of chocolate,
the Pussy Galore dipped in whipped cream, and Alotta Fagina with Alotta
Fagina - sorry that's a missing page from my Austin Powers cook book.
Like any good Bond film, this movie begins with the usual culinary
delights of finger food appetisers, before moving on to the spicy main
course. Terri Hatcher, better know as Superman's girl, tries her hand
with Bond, but only lasts a good undressing and bedding before being
murdered by a jealous husband. Having served the purpose of a cocktail,
the next course is the perfect example of exquisite oriental cooking,
the sort that wriggles and sizzles on your plate. I'm referring to the
sumptuous Michelle Yeoh. I freely admit to being a sucker for woman in
dark leathers with multitalented use of their hands and legs. I haven't
been this fascinated by the thinking/fighting woman well, since Bambi
and Thumper decided to go group action with Bond.</P>
<P>Once again, the question asked is how does this James (Pierce Brosnan)
compare with the other Bonds? Well he's not as manly as the heartthrob
Connery of the sixties, not as clean cut as the single dimensional Moore
of the seventies, and not as emotional as the ordinary Dalton of the
eighties. Brosnan is like the corporate executive of the nineties
deciding he needs a bit of Rambo in his life. So far he's doing a good
job interpreting the nineties Bond and should hold together for another
decade.</P>
<P>The plot surrounds events of news making ground breaking news. Evil
Media Mogul Elliot Carver (Jonathon Pryce) has decided that there is no
better news than bad news, and the best publicity usually comes from
oneself. Why wait for heaven and hell to arrive when you can create it
yourself. Now that the Soviet Union is no longer considered a serious
threat to world peace, the Chinese have become unwitting victims for
beginning WWIII with the British. Carver's plan basically surrounds the
use of stealth boats downing naval vessels of both sides and
antagonising all concerned.</P>
<P>In summary, TOMORROW NEVER DIES is what every Bond film should be. A
mixture of light-hearted humour sprinkled over the noisy, undertones of
special effect driven action, with a coating of classy babes to help the
food go down with as little indigestion as possible. My compliment to
Cubby Brocolli for once again bringing as back the Bond that every man
wants to be.</P>
