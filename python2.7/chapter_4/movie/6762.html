<P>This documentary film (which I have affectionately dubbed LITTLE BIG
BUG) observes a day and a night in the lives of a bunch of bugs in a
pre-selected field in Aveyron, France.  The extraordinary point of the
film and, of course, the reason to see it, is that the cameras get right
down into the grass -- not to mention into the honeycomb, inside the
ants' storeroom, and behind the dragonfly in flight -- to give us a bug's-
eye view (and, occasionally, a bird's-eye view) of life.</P>
<P>A lot of things happen in a day, to humans as well as to bugs, and
this film captures the essentials common to both species:  Birth, 
death, dinner, sex, fights, weather, physics, and endless grooming.
Birth is fascinating because quite often it includes re-birth in the form
of the emergence of a winged insect from its cocoon.  Death and 
dinner are inextricably entwined, inasmuch as there is generally a 
causal relationship between the two throughout the film.  Sex ranges
from a ladybug quickie to a stately, erotic, lovely encounter between
two snails.  The fights are cool because, at this range, you might as
well be watching GODZILLA vs. ANY LAND-BASED CREATURE.
The weather aspect is interesting because the film examines the effect
of "massive" raindrops falling not only on a single ladybug sitting on
a blade of grass, but also on a crowd of skeeters floating on the
surface of a pond.  The physics aspect is great fun as the camera
observes a beetle confront and ultimately solve the problem of contin-
uing to roll uphill a ball of dung that has become stuck on a stick.
(Rest assured that the Sisyphean nature of this task has not been lost
on the filmmakers.)  In fact, the physics of water and air play out in
unusual and enlightening ways throughout the film, and your name
doesn't have to be Dr. Science for you to figure them out.  Finally,
the grooming pays off because these bugs *look marvelous* -- sleek,
shiny, and beautifully colored.  Moreover, they are set in gorgeous
backgrounds of foliage and flowers designed to make them look
their best.</P>
<P>The film took three years to complete and an additional six months to
edit.  Apparently, some of this time was spent creating and perfecting
the photographic technology to complete the picture.  To say that the
film makes extraordinary use of close-up photography is a redundancy.
Additionally, the film uses time-lapse and slow-motion photography to
great effect.  Finally, the film makes outstanding use of feature film-
making techniques.  The work of Jean Renoir and Theo Angelopoulos
came immediately to mind as I watched particular shots.</P>
<P>There are several reasons why this film is eminently watchable by all
but the most diehard bug hater.  First, because these are beautifully
photographed bugs in a natural, clean, lush environment, rather than
an ugly bunch of cockroaches living in filth, the disgust factor is
eliminated.  Second, because most of the bugs are shot almost
exclusively in close-up, and therefore appear to be larger-than-life
size, the creepy-crawly factor is kept to a minimum.  Third, because
the bugs are *never* shown attacking humans or other non-insect life
forms, the fright factor is eliminated.</P>
<P>Overall, this is a delightful and witty anthropomorphic film with
mercifully low cute and gross-out quotients.  Its displays of humor
and, occasionally, high comedy, are tempered by the overriding
intelligence and compassionate empathy that pervade the film.
The film has great respect for its subjects, and at no time does it
laugh at them.  Moreover, the film's use of music, both instrumental
and vocal, only serves to enhance the expression of its viewpoint.
In a very sweet, conclusory touch, the end titles list and describe
the creatures in the film under a heading that translates as "With
the participation of, in order of appearance:"</P>
