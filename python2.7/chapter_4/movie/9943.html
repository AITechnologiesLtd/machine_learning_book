<P>     I'm sure that someone could -- and will -- come up with an
explanation for all the pseudo-science involved in the premise for ALIEN
RESURRECTION.  I'm sure there is some reason to accept why the cloning of
Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), apparently dead at the end of 1992's
ALIEN3, allowed Evil Military Scientists to produce an alien queen.  I'm
sure there is some reason why that same cloning process turned Ripley into
a human/alien hybrid with memories of her previous life.  I'm sure there's
some reason why the same alien queen which had been producing eggs could
suddenly become viviparous.  I'm sure there is some reason why I should be
able to yank "willing suspension of disbelief" from the jaws of "oh,
_please_."</P>
<P>     The thing is, ALIEN RESURRECTION didn't give me much reason to care
about what those reasons might be.  Screenwriter Joss Whedon spends plenty
of time on the particulars of the situation -- the aforementioned Evil
Military Scientists and their unholy experiments, a close-knit band of
space pirates delivering cryogenically frozen hosts for the alien eggs, a
mysterious woman (Winona Ryder) with a secret -- without realizing that
we're really here to watch Ripley battle aliens.  And that would be the
same Ripley who became an action icon in three previous films, not the
vaguely sinister approximation served up here.  All the effort to make
Ripley's return "realistic" still adds up to a cargo hold full of question
marks and an emotional vacuum at the film's center.  Call me crazy, but if
a writer's going to push the limits of credulity, I'd prefer him to say,
"ALIEN3 was just a dream.  Now here's Ripley, here's some aliens, here's a
space ship...go!"</P>
<P>     And go they eventually do, in some wild and truly bizarre set pieces.
Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (DELICATESSEN, CITY OF LOST CHILDREN) has a
genuine visual flair which inspires some sharp sequences, notably an
underwater escape for our protagonists which leads into an alien trap.
Unfortunately, he devotes most of his creative energy to coming up with
new and innovative ways for the aliens to treat the heads of their victims
like unsightly facial blemishes.  ALIEN RESURRECTION is frequently a bath
of viscera, a collection of graphic deaths rendered in glorious,
gratuitous detail.</P>
<P>     It all contributes to the impression that ALIEN RESURRECTION is a
"moment" film -- a bunch of neat ideas for individual scenes so
impersonally rendered that they never add up to a coherent narrative.  As
a film, it's never boring, featuring a typically whacked-out performance
by Brad Dourif as one of the scientists, a clever instance of alien
teamwork and self-sacrifice, and a potent encounter between Ripley and a
laboratory full of abominations.  It's also never compelling in a way we
should expect when a character has this much cinematic history.  By the
time its climactic confrontation rolls around -- involving a creature
resembling the evil doppleganger of the Pillsbury Doughboy -- ALIEN
RESURRECTION has become flat-out ridiculous, a big violent joke at the
expense of viewers expecting a real story about Ellen Ripley.  I can't see
most fans of the series walking away from this experience satisfied.  More
likely, the'll walk away muttering, "oh, _please_."</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Ripleys, believe it or not:  5.</PRE>
