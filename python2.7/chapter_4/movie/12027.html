<P>It wasn't quite clear, as Director Brad Silberling opened his nearly
two-hour love story CITY OF ANGELS, what image he wanted to give the
elite corps of men and women that trod the Earth as God's messengers.
The image, although not strictly important on an internal basis,
unintentionally becomes important because of the American public's
fascination with angelic beings. As Scott Adams, the creator of
'Dilbert,' writes: "It's statistically proven that a ninety-pound woman
can lift a Chrysler minivan off of her trapped husband with enough
adrenalin"; and usually when she does, the tabloids and talk shows are
run amok with stories of angels coming to the rescue. And what about the
all-too-familiar story of someone retrieving their developed film from
Walgreens or K-mart to see superimposed images of the risen Jesus or the
Virgin Mary? There's no denying the attachment to angels, so Silberling
has to be very careful with what he does. Whatever he did, though, it
turned out all right. </P>
<P>Silberling, whose last feature film was about another less-than-human
being (CASPER), sets up a solid romance between Nicolas Cage and Meg
Ryan. Cage, who had previously starred in two senseless but enjoyable
action films (CON AIR and FACE/OFF), gets to show a loveable innocence
that helps his character into the audiences' hearts. Ryan, last heard as
the voice of Anastasia in the movie of the same title, is present in the
same spunky manner. Her curly mop of frosted blond hair and willingness
to break into ear-to-ear smiles gives her a seat with the audience as
well. Even though the characters are hard to deny, they end up taking a
while to get together. This displeases the audience, especially after
one or two surprising plot turns, and it slows down a movie that was
otherwise moving at a comfortable speed. </P>
<P>The movie has a great narrative hook, and through it we learn of Seth
(Cage). An angel, Seth can only be seen by the dying, delirious, and of
course, his fellow angels, of whom there are quite many. The rather
spooky group inhabits (no surprise) the city of angels, Los Angeles,
sitting on skyscrapers, the Hollywood sign, Dodger Stadium, and other
civic landmarks. They cannot taste, smell, or touch, but they know no
fear, no hunger, no pain, and they hear music in the sunrise (a
particularly poetic twist). Seth, unlike many other angels, longs to be
human, and his desire is urged onward when he falls in love with Maggie
(Ryan), a beautiful heart surgeon. With the consoling words of his best
friend Cassiel (Andre Braugher) and the help of a patient at her
hospital (Dennis Franz), Seth comes to the threshold of his decision
between remaining an angel forever, or being with Maggie as a human
forever. </P>
<P>Along with that thought-provoking decision, CITY OF ANGELS also displays
some interesting themes, of which some are laughable and others are very
intense. Although there's nothing deep about the movie - it's bread and
butter romance between man and woman - the level of intelligence is
elevated by the plot intricacies that develop as a result of Seth's
angelic state. The movie frequently shows us that Seth can hear a
human's thoughts as he passes by them, and it's surprising just how real
the scripted thoughts are. Following Seth in and out of the city also
allows the spectacular cinematography: the angels are almost always
accompanied by grand, sweeping views of Los Angeles. It takes skilled
postproduction efforts to pull all of that down into a meaningful movie,
and it's been done here. Granted, it gets windy in parts, but there's
nothing too mushy or too corny about this romantic drama for anyone not
to like it.</P>
<P>FINAL AWARD FOR "CITY OF ANGELS": 3.0 stars - a good movie.</P>
