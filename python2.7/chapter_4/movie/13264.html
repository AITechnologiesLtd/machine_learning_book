<PRE>REVIEW: The Apostle
By Luke Buckmaster (<A HREF="mailto:bucky@alphalink.com.au">bucky@alphalink.com.au</A>)</PRE>
<P>Cast: Robert Duvall, Miranda Richardson, Farrah Fawcett, John Beasley,
Walter Goggins, Rick Dial, Billy Joe Shaver, Billy Bob Thornton, June
Carter Cash, Todd Allen
Director: Robert Duvall
Screenplay: Robert Duvall</P>
<PRE>>From 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
2 and a half stars</PRE>
<P>Robert Duvall has approached dangerous ground with The Apostle.  Not
necessarily dangerous as far as ethnical and religious themes are
concerned, but rather his skill behind the camera.  Respectable actors
have had mixed results as directors in the past; Billy Bob Thorton
managed to hit the right note with last years Sling Blade, as did Mel
Gibson with Braveheart.  On the other side of the spectrum, Kevin Spacey
made the frivolous and rather dull Albino Alligator, and now Duvall has
failed to show substantial talent as a director with his gutsy attempt
at a character study.</P>
<P>Duvall plays Euliss "Sonny" Dewell, an intriguing Pentecostal preacher
with a wandering eye for women and booze. Flawed, yes, but he is
completely devoted to his faith and his church.  Perhaps a little too
devoted, since he clubs a younger man of the cloth (Todd Allen) on the
head with a baseball bat after he assists in taking the church away from
him.  Realizing that he's gone too far, Sonny flees town and seeks
refuge in Bayou Boutte, Louisiana.  He dubs himself as "The Apostle
E.F," and starts a new church named "The One Way Road to Heaven" with
the assistance of retired preacher Reverend Blackwell (John Beasly).</P>
<P>In its worst moments, The Apostle will serve as a reminder of how much
potential it had. But nowadays many films seem to thrive on potential
alone - recent examples Deep Impact, Welcome to Sarajevo and Sphere all
have fascinating concepts, but their finished product didn't quite go
the distance.  Such is the story with The Apostle, which has potentially
riveting subject material but is over worked and indefinable.</P>
<P>I never quite understood what Duvall's motives were - is he trying to
show us ironies of the Christian faith?  Is he giving us a lesson on
redemption, or merely pointing out that even devoted men have flaws?  Or
is the entire film just a study of human behavior?</P>
<P>None of these themes are explored adequately, no doubt due to Duvall's
lack of experience as both a director and a writer.  To his credit, he
does approach the film impartially and honestly; making clear that his
intentions are not to shock, intimidate or offend.  But even from a
technical view, it was evident to me that he simply doesn't have the
skill, or experience to handle such a hefty workload as anything except
an actor.  Many camera shots look second-rate and novice, and some
scenes go way, way too long (especially his final preaching message).</P>
<P>Still, The Apostle is far from a disaster.  Duvall's riveting, Oscar
nominated performance is amongst the best of his career, and
occasionally the film delivers some memorable moments.  In particular, a
scene in which Sonny converts a racist troublemaker (Billy Bob Thorton,
in a cameo role) is amongst its finest.</P>
<P>After being disappointed by The Apostle's lack of quality and distinctly
clouded motives, my message to Duvall is clear: let the actors do the
acting, and the directors do the directing.  Unless, of course, he
somehow manages to create another Sling Blade.</P>
