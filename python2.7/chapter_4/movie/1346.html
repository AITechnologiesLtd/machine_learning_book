<PRE>                                WHITE SANDS
                       A film review by Carolyn Ford
                        Copyright 1992 Carolyn Ford</PRE>
<P>     WHITE SANDS is about an Estancia, New Mexico sheriff (Willem Dafoe)
who is trying to discover who killed a man found near the town.  Also
found with the dead man is a briefcase containing half a million
dollars.  Along the way, he gets entangled with the FBI, goes
undercover, and gets involved with Mickey Rourke and Mary Elizabeth
Mastrantonio.  I went to see  this because I grew up in northern New
Mexico, and heard it had a lot of good New Mexico scenery.  It does have
good scenery, but that's about it.  From the commercials, it looks like
it's going to be an action-packed adventure, which I think it was
supposed to be.  I'm having a hard time putting my finger on what didn't
work with this movie.  It seemed more like an outline or idea for a
movie.  There was plenty of blood and guts, killings, and  nasty people,
but somehow it just didn't involve me.  Thinking back through the plot,
it seems like it should have been exciting, but when it was over, I was
surprised, because I was still expecting the climax.</P>
<P>     The scenery, as I said, was beautiful, if you like New Mexico,
which I do.  However, they did play fast and loose with the size of the
state.  New Mexico is a huge state (even though many people don't even
realize it *is* a state), and you just don't bop down to White Sands
from Santa Fe for the afternoon.   Albuquerque is a long way from Taos,
etc., etc., and they seemed to make these trips back and forth with no
time delay at all.</P>
<P>     Another one of my big complaints is that Hollywood seems to think
that New Mexico is beautiful desert and mountain scenery populated by a
bunch of Texans.  Dafoe's character didn't suffer from this, but
incidental characters (Santa Fe locals and such) always seemed to talk
with Texas accents.  And they had country music playing in the lobby of
La Fonda hotel!  Give me a break!  They play more jazz and new-age type
music there, and Santa Fe is not real big on country music.  Hollywood
seems to think of "Southwest" as "Texas Cowboys."  Not that I'm slamming
Texas (after all, I live here now) but New Mexico is *completely
different*!</P>
<P>     Anyway, I can't recommend this movie based on plot, but it's a
pretty picture, and Mastrantonio's character has an absolutely gorgeous
house.</P>
