<P>Miss Congeniality  * * * out of * * * *
Starring: Sandra Bullock, Michael Caine, Candice Bergen, William Shatner, 
Benjamin Bratt, Ernie Hudson, Heather Burns.
Directed by: Donald Petrie
Running Time: 109 minutes
Rated PG-13: sexual humor, language, violence.</P>
<P>Movies are made to entertain, some movies are made to give messages, Miss 
Congeniality goes into the entertain category, its a very funny, well made, 
well acted comedy that is quite predictable, but so enjoyable and so fun to 
watch that in the end you forgive all it's flaws. Sandra Bullock gives one of 
her best roles to date, possibly outdoing her role in "While You Were 
Sleeping". </P>
<P>Gracie Hart is a 30-ish FBI agent, she is single and doesn't have much of a 
love life, when the FBI is trying to figure out the riddles a serial killer 
is sending them, Gracie tries her best as well, they find out that it has to 
do with the Miss United States Pageant, and they want to get their best agent 
to go undercover, and save the girls from this killer. Of course the person 
they pick is Gracie Hart, at first she is doubtful about it, but after she is 
made up by stylist Victor Melling (Michael Caine), they don't think twice 
about it.</P>
<P>Now Gracie Hart must become a lady, and try to blend in with these girls the 
best she can, making friends, and making enemies. The shows two hosts Stan 
Fields and Kathy Morningside (William Shatner and Candice Bergen) are a bit 
skeptical at first, but soon find out Gracie may be able to pull it off. With 
a lot of misadventures and plenty of laughs in between, "Miss Congeniality" 
pulls itself off with its cleverly written dialogue and great performance by 
Sandra Bullock.</P>
<P>Of course "Miss Congeniality" has it's share of flaws, first it is very 
predictable, and the ending is awfully conventional. Aside from these major 
flaws, the movie presents for plusses than minuses. There was times where I 
laughed out loud, which is almost a rarity these days, and the last time I 
laughed even close to this hard was in last summers "Scary Movie". </P>
<P>The characters are well written out, and the supporting cast Benjamin Bratt 
as Gracie's love interest Eric Matthews, Michael Caine as the flamboyant 
Victor Melling, William Shatner in a great and funny role as Stan Fields, and 
Candice Bergen in full force as Kathy Morningside, along the great Sandra 
Bullock this is definitely a great cast. Donald Petrie's direction really 
shows especially in the end, with the climax of the pageant. </P>
<P>In the end "Miss Congeniality" is a rewarding romantic comedy, with a flair 
to it. There is never a dull moment in the film, and the jokes come fast and 
furious, and the dialogue very clever and funny. Just don't think too much of 
it, because "Miss Congeniality" is one of the best comedies of 2000.</P>
