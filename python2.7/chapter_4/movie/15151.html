<P>_Velvet_Goldmine_ (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>After the disco debacle that was _54_, early signs seemed to indicate that
Miramax was about to commit another cinematic crime against a 1970s music
movement, glam rock, with Todd Haynes's _Velvet_Goldmine_.  The air of
anticipation surrounding it became something decidedly mixed once the film
premiered at Cannes, leaving audiences either hot or cold and garnering the
prize for "Best Artistic Contribution"--which sounded like a (pardon my
brusqueness) bullshit consolation award if I ever heard one.  But after
seeing the film, the Cannes award doesn't seem so bogus after all;
_Velvet_Goldmine_ is a true feast for the senses, a strange but ceaselessly
fascinating barrage of music and imagery.  The problem is, that's all it
is--words, pictures, and sound, with nothing in the center to hold it all
together.</P>
<P>For those of you unfamiliar with it, glam rock was a Brit-centered '70s
music movement, which, ironically enough, had just about nothing to do with
music itself.  Unlike disco, there is no distinct sound to glam rock; the
term was more a description of an attitude and a mode of dress: flashy
costumes, high platform heels, glitter makeup, and a general look of
androgyny--with the ambiguous sexuality to match; in short, sort of a
"flamboyant bisexual chic."</P>
<P>Unlike _54_, which didn't seem to have a clue as to what disco was,
_Velvet_Goldmine_ nails the glam rock milieu.  Haynes revels in all its
gaudy, garish glory, and not just by showcasing a lot of elaborately campy,
vampy musical performances by his central character, fictional glam rock
pioneer Brian Slade (Jonathan Rhys Meyers, who does his own singing).  The
air of bold excess extends to the equally glittery visual style created by
Haynes, cinematographer Maryse Alberti, and editor James Lyons, which
employs quick edits, dreamlike imagery, and an appropriate air of
surrealism--after all, it was a time of almost surreal sexual freedom,
openness, and self-indulgence.  (One scene has Haynes reverting to his old
_Superstar:_The_Karen_Carpenter_Story_ tricks, staging one scene entirely
with dolls.)</P>
<P>Haynes has an obvious affection for the era, and perhaps it is that
passion for the glamour that distracted him from coming up with a
compelling story.  _Velvet_Goldmine_ traces the rise and fall of Brian,
whose life and mysterious disappearance is investigated in 1984 by reporter
Arthur Stuart (Christian Bale), who has tried to live down his days as a
glam rock groupie.  Ironically, though, the more Arthur and, in turn, the
audience learns more about Slade, the more it becomes clear that,
underneath all the makeup and sequins, he's not a very interesting
personality--that is, if he even has one.  He sings and dresses up, but it
is never clearly defined who he exactly is.  Taking much more vivid shape
are the people in his life, such as American glam rocker Curt Wild (Ewan
McGregor, also providing his own vocals), with whom Brian has a sordid
sexual relationship; Brian's greedy manager Jerry Devine (Eddie Izzard);
and especially Brian's bitter American, Brit-wannabe wife Mandy (Toni
Collette, in the film's best performance).  Another writing misstep is the
clunky, forced way Haynes directly ties Arthur's past to Brian's; it would
have been less contrived if Arthur were simply a fan on the fringes.</P>
<P>Haynes does achieve what he sets out to do with _Velvet_Goldmine_, which,
according to the press notes, is to make "a valentine to the sounds and
images that erupted in and around London in the early 1970s."  But he
should have also thought to make something more than an affectionate
valentine--in other words, a fully realized and developed film.</P>
