<P>     Despite his reputation as one of America's foremost "serious"
filmmakers, Oliver Stone's name under the "director" caption does not
guarantee a good movie.  I learned that lesson while enduring the
seemingly-endless tedium of THE DOORS, and was reminded of it during
some of the long, drawn-out portions of JFK.  However, nothing that
Stone has directed--or misdirected--prepared me for the grotesque
mess that is NATURAL BORN KILLERS.</P>
<P>     Reportedly, Quentin Tarantino (who is credited with the story) was
upset by the treatment accorded his idea.  His reaction is
understandable.  While it's impossible to tell what kind of movie this
would have been served up "straight," it's a safe bet that it couldn't
have been worse.  In its current form, NATURAL BORN KILLERS is treading
uncomfortably close to EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES territory, and
that's not a good place for a movie to be.</P>
<P>     As a satire on the media's infatuation with violence and
murderers, NATURAL BORN KILLERS hits the bullseye.  The problem is,
this is a one- note movie.  It repeatedly hammers home the same point
until the audience is bludgeoned into senselessness.  MAN BITES DOG
attacked the subject with more finesse and wit.</P>
<P>     Then there are the visuals--a virtual cornucopia of photographic
tricks.  Stone frequently switches not only from color to
black-and-white, but from one film stock to another.  He uses a variety
of angles and filters.  Animation, slow motion, fast motion, rear
screen projection--he doesn't miss a gimmick.  At times it becomes
difficult, if not impossible, to focus on the story with all that's
going on.</P>
<P>     Used sparingly, these sorts of devices can be very effective (see
ZENTROPA for an example).  Stone, however, doesn't know the meaning of
moderation or subtlety, and opts instead for something that is
excessive and self-indulgent.  It's as if he wants to shout out the
statement:  "Look at what I can do!  I'm an artist!"</P>
<P>     Ultimately, the story doesn't carry much importance.  Mickey
(Woody Harrelson) and Mallory (Juliette Lewis) are serial killers whose
wake is littered with fifty-two bodies.  They slaughter just about
anyone they meet, although at each massacre they leave behind a single
survivor.  The Law, in the person of Jack Scagnetti (a character
mentioned in Tarantino's RESERVOIR DOGS and played here by Tom
Sizemore), is after the pair, but with no more fervor than the media.
Spearheaded by Wayne Gayle (Robert Downey Jr.), AMERICAN MANIACS (a TV
program profiling serial killers) is hot on Mickey and Mallory's trail,
with ratings as the prize.</P>
<P>     The actors aren't much more crucial than the plot, dwarfed as they
are by the camerawork.  Everyone is over-the-top, especially Tommy Lee
Jones (as a sadistic warden) and Robert Downey Jr.  Woody Harrelson and
Juliette Lewis are adequate as Mickey and Mallory, although neither is
required to do anything more imposing than act out a comic-book like
character.</P>
<P>     There are some clever bits here and there.  The I LOVE MALLORY
sitcom parody (featuring Rodney Dangerfield and Edie McClurg) is
amusing--and a little sinister, especially considering how the laugh
track is manipulated.  The use of clips from old shows like LEAVE IT TO
BEAVER works, as do some of the animated inserts.  The soundtrack's
blend of more than seventy musical cues provides a balanced
counterpoint to the visual blitz.</P>
<P>     However, the good parts of this film, meager as they are, can't do
much to help.  Message or not, NATURAL BORN KILLERS is an example of
narcissistic film making.  Next time, Oliver, try to restrain
yourself-at least a little.</P>
