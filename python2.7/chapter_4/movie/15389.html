<P>REVIEW:  My Best Friends Wedding
By Luke Buckmaster (<A HREF="mailto:bucky@alphalink.com.au">bucky@alphalink.com.au</A>)</P>

<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece): 4
stars</P>
<P>Weddings, one of the most treasured events in human life, have proven to
be immensely popular on the silver screen.  Just look at the record of
unbridled (get it, un-bridled) successes throughout the last decade -
Father of the Bride I and II, Muriels Wedding, Four Weddings and a
Funeral, the list goes on…</P>
<P>However, My Best Friends Wedding skillfully departs the tedious track
record of two people falling in love and getting married in love-a-dove
feel good films.  Instead the movie takes an entirely different angle of
holy matrimony, show casing not only two peoples love for each other but
also for another who regrets having lost her one true love.</P>
<P>It's a story of jealousy.  The charming and charismatic Julianne (Julia
Roberts) is a restaurant critic with a short attention span for most
things in life - whether that is lovers, food or friendship.
Determined, wearisome and courageous, she is the modern working class
woman with an attitude.</P>
<P>Not long into the film we are exposed to Julianne's almost selfish but
adorable character, and in no time she finds herself caught in an
intriguing situation of mixed emotions and life long secrets.  It seems
that Michael, her best friend since early high school years, has just
decided to get married.  Julianne is not in any way pleased for him, as
she suddenly realizes that she has loved the man for 20 years - and has
"four days to break up a wedding and win her man.".  But the cocky
Julianne has some lessons to learn….</P>
<P>Michael's fiancé Kimmy Wallace (Cameron Diaz) is quickly realized by
Julianne as being "irritatingly perfect", and with good cause - she's
beautiful, polite, understanding and entirely lovable.  And to further
Julianne's problems, Kimmy asks her to be the bride's maid minutes after
meeting her.  Whilst this may be nice and rosy, Julianne still has a
mission to achieve - and she's not about to give up.</P>
<P>Until this point (as you may have noticed), the film doesn't take itself
too seriously, but the best jokes are still to be seen as the plot takes
its most interesting turn upon the arrival of Julianne's gay friend
George (played by the appealing Rupert Everett).  Advising her in
moments of need, George confronts Julianne with the most important
question yet: "Do you really love him, or is this just about winning?"</P>
<P>The scenes to follow are lovely, clever slabs of comedy and romance
including a sing-a-long restaurant scene bound to put anyone in
stitches.</P>
<P>When watching this film, I couldn't help but keep my eyes glued to the
screen in the hope for more quality gags; something that it does with
class and poignancy.  But before too long, a familiar critical factor
put my mind into fearful overdrive.  This was, of course, the
all-important ending.  After all, the entire movie was of such a high
standard that a disappointing ending would have been disastrous to the
film; and Australian director P.J Hogan (Muriels Wedding) was faced with
a do or die situation.  Fortunately, he was able to conquer up a
skillful and very beneficial (and very unexpected) ending, without a
bias towards the film's protagonist.</P>
<P>If most Hollywood pictures turned out as rock solid and well rounded off
as this one, us critics wouldn't have nearly as much to say, and if we
would the chances are it would be something pleasing.  For Jerry Maguire
fans, you'll love this film, and for those put off by the feminine
sounding title rest assured - there's definitely something special in
the air.</P>
<P>Witty, charming and funny, My Best Friends Wedding is a definite winner.
However, one over riding question still remains: do I have the
confidence to recommend this film to my friends and family through
sickness and health, till death do us part?  I do.</P>
