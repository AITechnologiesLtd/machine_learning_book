                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1993 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  This film of military history contains
     more authentic military history than any other film I have
     ever seen.  The film itself is more than four hours and very
     little seems to be fiction.  Perhaps a little is
     speculation, but the highest proportion of time is
     reenactment of the most important battle in United States
     history.  Rating: +3 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>     As usual when I see an historical film, I will go home afterward and
pick up many historical accounts of the event and pick holes in what I have
seen on the screen.  I have not yet read Shelby Foote's account of the
battle of Gettysburg (which is about 120 pages), but I have read several
shorter accounts.  What I have discovered is that the film contradicts no
account any more than the accounts contradict each other.  And that is not
surprising since by all accounts writer/director Ronald F. Maxwell, after
basing his script on a Pulitzer Prize winning novel, THE KILLER ANGELS by
Michael Shaara, allowed his small army of historical experts to be tyrants
over the production of the film.  What made it to the screen is what the
experts agreed happened.  What STAR WARS was to the special effects film,
GETTYSBURG is to the historical film.  Nobody who sees the film and later
reads account of the battle can come away without the feeling of having
witnessed the battle already and without remembering a flood of images from
the film.  As far as how well the actors look and dress like people of the
Civil War the film gets an A+.  For the degree to which each major actor
looks like the actual person he is portraying the grade is a not-too-shabby
B+.  (The opening credits show the original and the actor and invite
comparison.)  Why not higher?  Well for example at the time of his most
familiar photographs, Lee had a fuller beard than Martin Sheen sports.  That
is the sort of variation you get.  Of course nobody mentions how full Lee's
beard was at the time of Gettysburg so perhaps I am underrating the film.
But if I can find no less picayune quibble than the length of a beard in a
254-minute historical film, I am not just impressed, I am floored.</P>
<P>     The actors are often familiar, if you can make them out under the heavy
beards typical of the Civil War period.  (The presence of women,
incidentally, is limited to a count of two and a screentime of about six
seconds.)  But actors seem to be chosen more for proven acting ability than
for marquee value.  The players include Tom Berenger as Lt. Longstreet,
Martin Sheen as Gen. Lee, Stephen Lang as Maj. Gen. Pickett, the late
Richard Jordan as Brig. Gen. Armistead, Jeff Daniels as Col. Chamberlain,
Sam Elliot as Brig. Gen. Buford, and Kevin Conway (whom I thought had been
dead for at least a couple years) as the what I would guess was an
interpolated character, Sgt. Buster Kilrain.</P>
<P>     Gettysburg was the climax of the Civil War as Midway was the climax of
the war in the Pacific.  And I found myself comparing this film to the film
MIDWAY as I watched it.  MIDWAY is only five minutes longer than half of
GETTYSBURG's length, yet for that film a whole fictional plot of "human
interest" was added about an American commander's son in love with a
Japanese-American woman.  Apparently the filmmakers thought that so much
history was too much for the viewer.  In GETTYSBURG with the exception of a
few conversations to broaden the characters, and a rhetorical speech added
here and there, what we see is all documented history and ironically the
film is more and not less compelling as a result.</P>
<P>     From the point of view of the film five men were responsible for the
South going from a winning war to a losing war with this one battle.  For
the North, Buford created the strategy and Chamberlain defended the weak
flank.  For the South, Jeb Stuart chose to raid rather then reconnoiter,
Ewell failed to attack at a strategic moment, and Lee's ego told him to
fight the battle even on the enemy's terms because winning would almost
certainly bring the end of the war.  Of these the most screen time is
devoted to Chamberlain who, torn with self-doubt, shows himself to
nonetheless represent both heroism and decency.</P>
<P>     GETTYSBURG was reportedly made as a television mini-series and at some
point was redirected to the big screen.  It will certainly lose much of the
impact of its huge cast when translated to the small screen.  In incredible
list of historical reenactment societies apparently volunteered to act as
extras and to reenact the battle.  The men participating in Pickett's charge
form a very long wall that will not be nearly as impressive when the flanks
are cut for television's aspect ratio.  On the other hand, getting the film
on video will allow the stopping of the film and reading from historical
sources about the various actions being depicted.  My initial reaction to
the film was that it must have cut out a lot of what was really happening to
concentrate only on Buford's defense of the high ground the first day,
Chamberlain's defense of the flank the second day, and Pickett's charge the
third day.  The first source I saw that described the battle in any detail
listed three important actions and they were exactly the ones chosen by the
filmmakers.  This engaging film is almost a textbook about the battle and
because at the same time it is so enthralling, this is one of best and
perhaps in some respects is the best historical feature film ever made.
Nothing quite like this has ever been done at this length and done this
elaborately, so it is all the more impressive.  My rating is +3 on the -4 to
+4 scale.</P>
