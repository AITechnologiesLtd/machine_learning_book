<PRE>                               LOST HIGHWAY
                       A film review by Marty Mapes
                        Copyright 1997 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>*** (out of 4) LOST HIGHWAY uses a technique that other films have used
before; namely it starts and ends in the same place. But LOST HIGHWAY is
not a loop; it is a Moebius strip, turning itself inside out before
coming back to the beginning.=20</P>
<P>One part of the story involves a man who kills his wife (Bill Pullman
and Patricia Arquette); the other part of the story involves a young kid
of a mechanic who gets caught up with a powerful mobster and his moll
(Balthazar Getty, Robert Loggia, and Patricia Arquette, again).=20</P>
<P>Much debate has raged over the "plot" of this movie and every critic I
have read so far has dismissed the connection between the stories as
unsolvable. Later in the review I propose a solution to the story, as
suggested by my dear sister.=20</P>
<P>Realizing before I went that I might not "get" the movie, I tried to
keep an open mind while watching it. The first thing that struck me was
that the characters were two dimensional. Pullman's character =97 Fred
Madison =97 lives in an expensive-looking house in what appears to be L.A.
His job? He's an avant-garde saxaphone player. His wife Renee apparently
does not work.=20</P>
<P>Forgive me for being cynical, but a saxophone player cannot make enough
to afford a $300,000 house, let alone support two people, at least not
without selling out. But then he wouldn't be avant-garde, would he?=20</P>
<P>Okay. I can forgive the movie some 2-D characters. In fact, the dry,
crisp 2-D cops were an amusing touch to the movie. I understood that the
movie was not about characters but about mystery. There is one character
who, though he may be 2-D, is very interesting. He is Mystery Man
(Robert Blake) and he is extremely creepy. He has an evil intensity
about him and somehow, he is part of the key to the connection between
the two stories.=20</P>
<P>As I continued to watch I kept noticing how great the cinematography
was. When movies switched from mostly black & white to mostly color, one
of the greatest losses was the richness, depth, and texture of shadows.
Bruce Kawin says in HOW MOVIES WORK, "In color, shadows are in danger of
being washed out or of appearing as patches of muted color." LOST
HIGHWAY has neither problem. Lynch and cinematographer Peter Deming have
taken control of light and created a film with the range of color and
the depth of black & white.=20</P>
<P>A few examples spring to mind. Early in the film, Fred walks away from
the camera down a dark hallway into the bathroom. He eventually
disappears into the blackness of the screen. The shots of the highway at
night make such a good use of black that you can't tell where theater
ends and the screen begins. When the cops are searching the Madison
home, the orange walls show not muted tones of color, but clearly
defined shadows.=20</P>
<P>As withCRASH, the story doesn't make a lot of sense by itself and some
examination of the tone and emotion is required to appreciate what is
happening. The tone of LOST HIGHWAY is set, not with music, like CRASH,
but with the visual elements of colors, textures, and shadows. The tone
of LOST HIGHWAY is mysterious, vaguely ominous, and frightening by means
of the unknown.=20</P>
<P>Without much in the way of a story, I still recommend this movie for its
tone and its look. And if you like a good mystery, see the movie and try
to piece it all together. I felt it wasn't worth the effort to try to
put it together when nobody has come up with an "answer."=20</P>
<P>Having said that, let me present my sister's interpretation of the
"plot." If you think she's got something here, or if you know why she
can't be right, please email me your comments. I'll publish any
responses I get on my page (<A HREF="http://net.indra.com/~mmapes">http://net.indra.com/~mmapes</A>). Here's the
the theory of how the story works in a literal chronology.=20</P>
<P>The literal story starts when Renee/Alice (she's the same person) is
forced to strip for Mr. Eddy at gunpoint. She realizes she likes it and
gets sucked into the world of pornography and violence. Notice that she
and Mr. Eddy are making out at a party, watching a "death porn" film.=20</P>
<P>She is later introduced to Pete (the young mechanic), whom she seduces,
uses, and kills. She kills him when they both arrive at the burning
beach house with Mystery Man. Mystery Man represents murderousness; he
embodies the ability to commit murder ("I don't go where I'm not
invited").=20</P>
<P>Alice becomes Renee, seduces Fred, and marries him. She says the same
line to him that she said to Pete (something about getting a job; "just
a job" at a certain club). Fred looks into this (though not on screen)
and learns that his wife is not only a porn star, but that she is a
monster who uses men, seduces them, and kills them. In a way, Fred is a
victim, just like his Moebius-strip counterpart Pete. But Fred catches
on to her game and sets out to murder his monster of a wife (he meets
the Mystery Man at the party; he is ready to commit murder). He carries
out his deed and is sentenced to death.=20</P>
<P>At the end of the movie (not the timeline) Fred speaks in the intercom
TO RENEE that Dick Laurent is dead. He's really saying: "I'm on to you;
I know what you are and I have put a stop to it."=20</P>
<P>I can think of one unanswered question if this is the "solution"; when
did he kill his wife, relative to when he killed Mr. Eddie/Dick Laurent?
Still, this could be a small detail in the larger picture. Also, other
stylistic elements must be discarded as red herrings, but I think she's
on to something here.=20</P>
