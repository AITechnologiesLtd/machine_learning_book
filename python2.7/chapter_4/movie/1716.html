<PRE>                        THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1993 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>120 min., R, Comedy, 1992
Director: Jonathan Lynn
Cast: Eddie Murphy, Lane Smith, Sheryl Lee Roth, Joe Don Baker,
      Victoria Rowell, Grant Seud, Kevin McCarthy, Charles S. Dutton,
      Victor Rivers, Noble Willingham, James Garner, Della Reese,
      Sarah Carson</P>
<P>     Con man Eddie Murphy sees that the way to make money is to become a
congressman.  When Florida's congressman, James Garner, dies, Murphy
runs for his seat under name recognition.  When Murphy wins the
election, he starts to have a field day in Washington, D.C.</P>
<P>     1992 was a great year for fans of Eddie Murphy.  In the summer he
put out the film BOOMERANG (which is now on video cassette) and then
just recently he put out the film THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN, which is
up to his excellent standard.  I highly recommend THE DISTINGUISHED
GENTLEMAN to all fans of Eddie Murphy.  On a scale of zero to five, I
give THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN a five.  THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN is
rated R for explicit language, adult situations, and adult humor.</P>
<P>     This film has been said by some people to be better than BEVERLY
HILLS COP.  I don't agree with that.  I still feel that BEVERLY HILLS
COP is Eddie Murphy's best film.  However, Eddie Murphy doesn't let his
fans down.  This film is written with the trademark Eddie Murphy humor
that keeps up from beginning to end.</P>
<P>     This is one of those films that it doesn't matter whether you see
it in the theater or not.  I think that a film always looks better on
the big screen, but with the amount that movies are costing these days
some people may want to wait for this film to be released on video
cassette.  However I recommend that big fans of Eddie Murphy see this
film in the theater.</P>
<P>     Eddie Murphy's supporting cast is excellent; especially Charles
S. Dutton ("Roc", ALIEN^3), who plays a minister (and has hair on his
head).  I think that Charles S. Dutton is an great actor and makes
anything that he is in better (he was one of the best things about
ALIEN^3).  Kevin McCarthy also added a lot to the film.</P>
