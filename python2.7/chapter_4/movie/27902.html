<PRE>FAITHLESS
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 2001 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Even though I attended film school in the early '80s, I'm loath to admit
that I never saw an Ingmar Bergman until *after* I graduated (odd really;
works by the great angst-focused Swedish director--"Cries and Whispers,"
"Persona," and "Wild Strawberries" to name but a few--would tend to
populate most film studies curricula).  That movie was "Fanny and
Alexander" and I loved it.  Yet to this day, for similarly inexplicable
reasons, it remains the only Bergman movie I've seen (I've seen a few Woody
Allen Ingmar Bergman movies but that's not quite the same thing).</P>
<P>As it happens, "Fanny and Alexander" was the penultimate theatrical film
to be directed by Bergman.  The 82-year-old filmmaker is still alive,
living a semi-reclusive life on a remote island in the Baltic Sea and
winding down his days with the occasional stage and television directing
stint and, I daresay, long walks on the beach.</P>
<P>"Faithless" is the latest film to bear Bergman's name, but he didn't
direct it, and he doesn't even turn in a cameo (although he wrote it and
*is* in it, so to speak).  Erland Josephson plays Bergman as a whiskery,
white-haired old gentleman who, as the film opens, is summoning up a muse
to provide inspiration for a story he wishes to relate.  A difficult
chapter from Bergman's own life, it seems--how the legendary director once
had an affair with an actress, and how that affair, like a lie once told,
spread like a cancer through his private life. </P>
<P>Bergman asked Liv Ullmann, with whom he had worked many times, to direct
"Faithless" and the actress-turned-director's take on the story is deep and
delicately crafted.  In the film, Lena Endre plays Marianne, a 40-year-old
woman who begins a casual affair with her husband's best friend, David
(played by Krister Henriksson).  Since Marianne's husband Markus (Thomas
Hanzon) is a world-famous classical conductor and therefore often on
different continents, things start out easy and carefree--"perfect"--but
soon enough the deceit and the duplicity start to take their toll.  Adding
another level of complexity to the situation is the fact that Marianne and
Markus have a young daughter, Isabelle (Michelle Gylemo).</P>
<P>"Faithless" is a characteristically fine piece of filmmaking with all of
the actors excelling in their roles (especially Endre, who plays a women
put through the emotional ringer).  Rather than choosing a straightforward
narrative, however, Bergman uses the somewhat contrived plot device of
having Endre's character (as an apparition) help the filmmaker reconstruct
scenes from a marriage, and the result is a dilution of the honesty that is
served up so well in the central story.  It's not enough to spoil one's
"enjoyment" of the film, but the structure is occasionally at odds with the
emotional core of the drama. </P>
<P>Hats off to the film's screenwriter, however.  Bergman's words, even via
translated subtitles, are powerful and uncompromising and seem to sidestep
many of the clichés found in your standard tale of infidelity.  Clearly
this is a filmmaker who understands the raw range of emotions that
accompany guilt and dishonesty.  Once Markus discovers the cheating lovers
(since, like the perfect crime there is no perfect affair), he sets in
motion a harrowing series of events that test the mettle of Marianne,
David, and we, the audience.</P>
<P>I've still only seen the one Ingmar Bergman movie but, after watching the
shattering "Faithless," I now feel as though I've seen two.</P>
