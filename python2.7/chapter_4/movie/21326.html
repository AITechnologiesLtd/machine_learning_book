<PRE>Bringing Out The Dead Review</PRE>
<P>  With a few exceptions, Martin Scorsese has generally been a favorite director
of mine. With such classics like Raging Bull, Goodfellas and my personal
favorite Taxi Driver, I usually am interested in what his latest project will
be. Bringing Out The Dead may not be up to par to Taxi Driver, but it's by far
his best film since Goodfellas, which might be a relief for hard-core Scorsese
fans.
  If you know Scorsese, there's not much of a plot to his films, because he
likes to explore the characters to his films, like in Taxi Driver, which had a
huge impact on critics. In Bringing Out The Dead, his characters aren't
explored that deeply. Cage's character in this film was deeply disturbed. He
wanders the streets of New York in an ambulance with his fellow medics, as they
rescue dying patients. The first stop is with an old man, who we see throughout
the film. When the old man arrives at the hospital, Cage gets acquainted with
the man's daughter (Patricia Arquette). For some reason Cage runs into her
often, as he runs back and forth in his ambulance. When he's out on the streets
he is haunted by patients he couldn't save. It's like ER in hell for Cage, as
he experiences these horrifying moments on a regular basis. 
  You would think that seeing dead patients would spark more interest for the
viewers, but quite frankly that never occurs. The whole film I was waiting for
something more, but unfortunately Schrader never delivered. It's not like
Scorsese to keep the pace steady the full time. I was quite disappointed by the
film's effort. It should have changed direction, or at least had a unique
climax. 
  On the brighter side the acting was the only enlightening feature that kept
the film flowing. Even though the film was displeasing, Nic Cage still managed
to perform his part rather well. If anyone looks like he's been through hell,
it's him. Those depressed eyes, and dreary look really added to the atmosphere
that Scorsese was shooting for.
The other supporting actors added some enjoyable tones as well. John Goodman is
the serious partner, Ving Rhames the religious one, and Tom Sizemore is as
crazy, if not crazier than Cage. Despite Sizemore's hostility towards others, I
couldn't help but be intrigued by what could possibly posses such cruelty
towards injured or sick patients. Pretty disturbing if you ask me.
  Martin Scorsese turns in a typical directing approach. Some noteworthy
remarks I had were the camera angels, as they speed past the ambulance so that
we get the same rush that the characters feel. There's also some twisted side
shots of the ambulance going down a dark alley. He does this a few times, and
it's quite appealing for those interested in technical uses.
  Like Goodfellas, Scorsese continues to put out a rocking soundtrack with
tunes by the R.E.M, The Clash and Van Morrison. You have to applaud at his
choice of music, because oddly enough, these songs fit the film perfectly. He
definitely chooses wisely.
  Although "Bringing Out The Dead" is a let down, fans will enjoy it's attempt.
Some may hate it's never-ending story, but others may like what it has to
offer. Not for people with low attention spans.</P>
