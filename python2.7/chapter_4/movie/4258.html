<PRE>                          CRY THE BELOVED COUNTRY
                       A film review by Martin Rich
                        Copyright 1995 Martin Rich</PRE>
<PRE>Directed byDarrell James Roodt</PRE>
<P>     This story of two men from the South African countryside, one
white and one black, and their sons entangled in the same violent
events in Johannesburg, is one of the most famous and memorable
accounts of apartheid.  The novel was written by Alan Paton, a white
South African teacher, just after World War II, and filmed by Zoltan
Korda in 1951.</P>
<P>     So it was perhaps inevitable that, with the demise of apartheid
and the opening up of trade with South Africa, one of the first films
to be released to an international market would be a new version of
CRY, THE BELOVED COUNTRY.  It received its European premiere at
the London Film Festival last weekend and will go on release in the US
in a week's time.</P>
<P>     On the strength of its showing in London, the new film deserves to
succeed.  It works brilliantly at many levels beyond its portrayal of
apartheid.  There is the bewilderment of the black priest at the centre
of the film, when he first sees how his family live in Johannesburg.
There is the subtlety of the issues when a white man is murdered--but
the white man apparently embroiled in a racial dispute is actually a
liberal, and regarded by friends as a faint curiosity, for his
sympathetic treatment of the "natives."  There is the contrast
between collective violence, and bigotry, and racism, and the
acceptance and optimism shown by the individual characters.</P>
<P>     The playwright Ronald Harwood started working with CRY, THE
BELOVED COUNTRY, a few years ago when Johannesburg's Market Theatre
looked into the possibility of a stage version.  This was the idea that
evolved into Harwood's screenplay for the new film.  This is relevant,
partly because it is a reminder that the idea behind the film actually
predates the South African elections, partly because occasionally the
dialogue can appear formal and understated, in a way that suggests the
script's origins for the stage.</P>
<P>     Nevertheless the style of dialogue is appropriate to the story,
and the leading players--James Earl Jones and Richard Harris--invest
their roles with a good deal of humanity which is crucial to the
narrative.  And the whole film looks and sounds great: visually it
makes the most of the beautiful rural surroundings and their contrast
with the teeming city.</P>
<P>     It isn't always comfortable viewing, but its emotional power is
immense.  And its reminder, of quite how complex perceptions of good
and evil actually are, is as important as ever.</P>
