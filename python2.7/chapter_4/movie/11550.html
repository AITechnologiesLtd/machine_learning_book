<P>   If the eponymous goody-two-shoes of Kevin Costner's "The
Postman" gives you a warm, fuzzy feeling inside, "Junk Mail"
is the antidote.  In this Norwegian entry helmed by Pal
Sletaune in his feature directorial debut (Norway's Academy
Award submission), Roy (Robert Skjaerstad) is a letter carrier
who reads other people's mail, throws out what he doesn't
feel like carrying, and is disliked by everyone.  He's nothing
like Isabelle Huppert's character, the vile letter carrier in
Claude Chabrol's "La Ceremonie," because in his debut as a
feature film director, Pal Sletaune keeps a light touch on his
story, making even one dastardly, violent criminal into the
object of humorous pathos.</P>
<P>   The movie is an corrective, as well, for those who believe
Norway is a kind of Shangri-la, a nation not bothered by
outsiders since 1945, a fairy-tale land of fjords and happy
salmon where everyone has a lovely, gingerbread home. 
Sletaune's people are not munchkins: the neighborhoods
could make any tourist scream in dismay.  The part of Oslo
which his cameraman, Kjell Vassdal, focuses on is as seedy
as Times Square, featuring run-down housing with barely-
running water, neighborhood bars patronized by losers, and
dark corner inhabited by barbarous muggers and the forlorn
homeless.  You wouldn't expect a civil servant, a postman, to
live in a tenement in this district: you'd figure he's have a flat
more like the spacious one inhabited by the good-looking
woman, a dry cleaner, whom he meets and who changes his
life.  Roy (Robert Skjaerstad), is a pathetic postman, a
morose mailman who leaves his dirty dishes in the sink for
weeks on end, eats whatever is available, which is likely as
not to be canned spaghetti, and like a terrier, puts in his
mouth assorted objects he comes across which belong to
other people--chocolate, Kellogg's Frosted Flakes, even
sedative capsules.</P>
<P>   Roy is not a nice person.  Verbally abused in the mail room
(one bully of a co-worker taunts him by asking rhetorically,
"What are you good at?"), he takes out his frustrations by
regularly dumping half the mail in a subway tunnel and
opening and reading what looks like love letters.  When he
picks up a set of keys left in a mailbox by its attractive owner,
Line (Andrine Saether), he enters her home and falls upon an
adventure which alters the course of his life.</P>
<P>   Combining humor and anguish with suspense and danger,
Pal Sletaune's movie--which was co-written by Jonny Halbert
and which won the International Critics Week award at the
1997 Cannes Festival--is a decidedly small one of the kind
you'd see on an artsy TV channel.  Acted with deadpan grace
by Robert Skjaerstad, with a fixed, bemused look by Andrine
Saether as the hard-of hearing Line, and with comic charm by
the criminal George (Per Egilaske), "Junk Mail" is a modest
effort, predictable in its outcome, with a script that at times
seems improvised (and in fact was developed from a series of
improvisations by the performers).  It introduces Robert
Skjaerstad to a wide public, an actor who resembles Dustin
Hoffman in "Midnight Cowboy," and shows us the seamy side
of Norway's principal city.  Per Egil Aske's role as George is
hard to swallow, though.  The man is a violent criminal who
almost kills a security guard in order to gain possession of a
key (which the guard swallows), yet turns into a guy who
resembles Curley or Moe in his comic escapades.  "Junk
Mail" is, perhaps by its own admission, not a first class movie
but a pleasant enough parcel suitable for some laughs and
insight into a region of Europe less traveled than others.  Not
Rated.  Running time: 80 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten 1998</P>
