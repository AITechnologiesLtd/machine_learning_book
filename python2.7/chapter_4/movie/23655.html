<P>Black humor seems to be, among other characteristics, in the genes of 
director (and writer and actor) Roman Polanski -- but that's a 
speculation. What is certain is that his childhood and youth were 
marked by dark events. He was born in Paris (1933) in a Jewish-Polish 
family which, in 1936, made the wrong choice of returning to Poland. 
That's where the German attack of September 1, 1939 started World War 
II. In 1941 Roman's parents were sent to a concentration camp where 
his mother died. The boy escaped the Cracow ghetto, meandered in the 
country taking refuge in Catholic families. His  survival would make 
a fascinating film, but as a filmmaker Polanski has referred directly 
to the savagery of war in just one short movie.</P>
<P>How he became a major cineaste is also a fascinating tale. I'll skip 
it, except to say that three aspects of his "oeuvre," anguish, 
alienation and absurdism, were often accompanied by a sense of the 
comedic (cf. the parody "The Fearless Vampire Killers or: Pardon Me 
But Your Teeth Are in My Neck")</P>
<P>In America Polanski's fame came with  the Hollywood movie "Rosemary's 
Baby" (1968).  The following year, his pregnant wife  Sharon Tate and 
others were murdered by the Manson "family" In 1974 came the triumph 
of "Chinatown" and in 1977 the scandal (the statutory rape of a 
13-year old model) which had Polanski flee to Europe. His subsequent 
films there were the hit "Tess"; " Pirates" which justly bombed; the 
underrated, Hitchcockian "Frantic"; the quirky "Bitter Moon"; the 
powerful "Death and the Maiden."</P>
<P>"The Ninth Gate" may not be epoch-making, but it is better than it 
may seem at first sight, especially if one does not view it simply as 
"horror" (the wrong pigeonhole), but as a black humor fantasy. Bear 
in mind that the film is a simplification of a novel otherwise 
impossible to adapt.</P>
<P>New York City's Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is a kind of book detective, 
an agent with impressive knowledge who searches for valuable rare old 
books. He's also a con-meister who tries to buy cheap and resell very 
high.</P>
<P>The opening sequence (after a marvelous list of credits) is of A+ 
caliber. Corso visits a wealthy but naive couple to appraise the 
collection of their old father, now a wheelchair-bound vegetable. In 
the process, Corso purchases for himself a rare "Don Quijote" for a 
ridiculously low sum. Note how the old man's face -- he is aware of 
the book's value but is unable to communicate-- expresses his 
feelings. This is one of the several good moments of the film, 
details that keep it going through thick and thin.</P>
<P>New York is shown in "film noir" terms, disturbing, ominous. It was 
terrifically recreated in European studios. Corso is summoned by a 
client, zillionaire Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) who has a haughtily 
sinister side and whose name recalls Transylvanian vampirism. Balkan 
is a high-power  demonology lover whose collection (protected by high 
tech) of books on Satan is world class. He has recently bought "The 
Nine Gates of the Kingdom of the Shadows" from another collector, the 
aged Telfer who then hanged himself. That's a priceless book, with 
nine etchings, published in Venice in the mid 1600s. The story goes 
that its author Aristide Torchia (who signs his engravings AT) was 
assisted by Satan and paid for this on the stake.</P>
<P>Balkan has tried some magic via the book (some sort of Renaissance 
voodoo? ) but it didn't work. Knowing that the volume is one of three 
extant, he commissions Corso to examine the other two books,  in 
Portugal and in Paris, for a huge fee --undisclosed and regularly 
increased. He  trusts him with his copy which, wrapped in chamois and 
placed in a leather bag will accompany Corso's every step. (The bag 
may someday go for thousands at a movie memorabilia auction)</P>
<P>For safety, Corso deposits the volume at his collaborator Bernie's 
rare-book shop. The defly deftly sketched relationship of the two men 
is one of the several reasons to see the movie.</P>
<P>The investigation begins. It is high powered. It is also high camp. 
If you take the film and its mumbo-jumbo seriously, you're on the 
wrong track. Polanski's tongue-in-cheek treatment spills out all over 
the place.</P>
<P>Does the plot make sense? No. Is it amusing? Yes-- in spite of Bernie 
getting mysteriously killed and hung just as in one of the volume's 
etchings. Enter the young and sexy widow Liana Telfer  (Lena Olin) 
who is after the book her late husband had sold Balkan.</P>
<P>As in private eye thrillers she tries seducing Corso. No need to 
alert you to   her raised skirt, but do notice the thigh's cabalistic 
tattoo of a snake biting his own tail. Vigorous sex terminates when 
Corso gets bumped on the cranium. It's Hollywood film noir again. 
Except for a clever shot of the man coming back to life with his eyes 
double printed on the film. Another striking, fugitive moment.</P>
<P>The search for the two other copies escalates. It leads to Spain, 
Portugal and France. Corso is indefatigable, shows extraordinary 
stamina and remains unruffled. Johnny Depp is remarkable in the cool 
way he plays his part, even more impertubably than the three major 
Philip Marlowes: Bogart, Mitchum and Dick Powell. And like the 
private investigators of old he punctuates his sleuthing with smoking 
Lucky Strikes and drinking scotch. The permanent joke however is that 
Depp, hairdo, mustache, goatee and glasses is a dead ringer for a 
more manicured Leon Trotsky!</P>
<P>Involved in his search is a pretty, nameless and most mysterious 
young woman (The Girl) played by Polanski's wife Emmanuelle Seigner. 
She pops up all over the map, does strange things, keeps super-cool, 
rescues Corso more than once and joins forces with him. I cannot 
reveal more.</P>
<P>More pleasantries include twin brothers  Ceniza (the name 
symbolically means ashes) Spanish book specialists played by one 
actor (great special effects); a Dennis Rodman-like goon; a one-armed 
old Baroness in a wheelchair. A passionate bibliophile, she competes 
with hated Balkan, owns another copy of the book, has a forbidding 
secretary (the latter is used as a nice red herring ). Corso, in a 
devilish hurry, opens the outer door to the Baroness's place --but he 
does not shut  it. A mistake, as film fans will attest.</P>
<P>The good moments are many, especially when they deal with books, 
their inspection and their collectors' passion. Corso's discoveries 
of etchings initialed LCF (Lucifer) are sort of silly fun. But the 
film does suffer  from unclarities and disorientations. When the 
investigator takes a cab to Victor Fargas -- an impoverished 
Portuguese aristocrat who owns one of the "Nine Gates," the road 
looks like a typical tree-lined French one. Fargas's English accent 
is an un- Portuguese hybrid. Later,to follow another car, Corso 
instantly and incredibly hijacks a half-million dollar sports 
convertible that a super-wealthy Arab and his Parisian chick have 
left for hotel personnel to park. The chase is fun and funny, but 
leads to an improbable chateau which is hosting a huge coven of high 
society witches, all unlikely devil-worshippers about to have an 
orgy. Balkan puts an end to this.</P>
<P>Starting with the fast car, the film goes downhill even faster. It 
reaches a nadir with ridiculous episodes in another, far more ancient 
castle, and with  an idiotic finale of sex. Even the original score 
by  Wojciech Kilar.and the intelligent photography by Darius Khondji 
(*see note below) looks like a silly add-on. The third half-hour of 
the movie is a mess, but two out of three ain't bad.</P>
<P>* Darius Khonji.  Born in Tehran, Iran, to an Iranian father and 
French mother. Studied film at New York University. Among his 
credits: Delicatessen ,  The City of Lost Children , Stealing Beauty, 
Evita, Alien: Resurrection, In Dreams, The Beach.</P>
<P>In The Ninth Gate his imaginative camera-work avoids the horror 
genre's oft-used mists, soft-focus tricks or SFX gimmickry. Instead, 
it keeps a sharp, often deep focus and making his shots realistic and 
his lighting match the sets.</P>
