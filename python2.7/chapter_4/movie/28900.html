<PRE>RUSH HOUR 2
A film review by Blake French
Copyright 2001 Filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>I enjoyed the original Rush Hour, the 1998 action comedy that grossed
more than $250 million worldwide.  Through its central characters,
played by Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan, the film provided audiences with
a fresh, exciting combination of action and outrageous comedy.  Although
not a great film, and certainly not worthy of a sequel, director Brett
Ratner admirably stitched together two immensely different characters,
finding a charismatic delight in the diversity of Tucker and Chan.</P>
<P>Unfortunately Ratner does not find the same joy in Rush Hour 2, an
occasionally amusing comedic adventure that leaves us with a profoundly
annoying Chris Tucker fighting for attention while Jackie Chan fights
one-dimensional Chinese villains with his bare fists.  The film contains
some neat action sequences, a great third act, and the most hilarious
outtakes I can remember - but the clash of genres feels intrusive and
awkward.  I wanted more excitement, more character dimension, and a
whole hell of a lot less of Chris Tucker's irritating mouth.</P>
<P>In this sequel, Chan and Tucker reprise their roles as Chief Inspector
Lee of the Royal Hong Kong Police and the all-American LAPD detective
James Carter.  As the movie opens, the two buddies arrive in Hong Kong
for a much needed vacation but receive the biggest case of their careers
almost immediately.  An explosion has killed two U.S. customs agents who
were investigating producers of counterfeit money, and the police
suspect the mastermind behind the scheme to be Ricky Tan (John Lone, in
a very effective performance), the head of the deadliest gang in China.</P>
<P>Although it pisses Carter off, Lee accepts the case -- for personal
reasons, perhaps.  Enter the seductive secret service agent Isabella
Molina (Roselyn Sanchez), billionaire hotel owner and Tan associate
Steven Reign (Alan King), and a sexy but dangerous Hu Li (Crouching
Tiger, Hidden Dragon's Zhang Ziyi), and you have the unpredictable
formula for Rush Hour 2.  Jumping from one locale to the next, Carter
and Lee find adventure at a local massage parlor, a bar, a casino, an
extravagant hotel, and even a luxurious yacht.</P>
<P>Good action sequences and energetic performances don't fuel the movie's
plot, which is often rambling and meaningless.  Rush Hour 2 tries to
pass its plot off as serious, but it's hard to play along when Tucker
can't even play roulette without making a fool of himself.  This is not
supposed to be a stark drama, but after a while, we want relief from the
nonstop comic relief.</P>
<P>Tucker doesn't steal his scenes; instead he steals our attention away
from them.  Chris Tucker is a talented, energetic comedian.  In
moderation, he can be very effective.  Unfortunately, in Rush Hour 2, he
appears in almost every scene and quickly outstays his welcome.  In Rush
Hour, he was an appreciated comic relief.  Here, I just wanted him to
shut up.</P>
