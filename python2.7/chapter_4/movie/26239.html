<PRE>BEAUTIFUL
A film review by Robert Strohmeyer
Copyright 2000 filmcritic.com

<P>     Few things simultaneously sicken and seduce the feminist spirit in
quite as thorough a way as an American beauty pageant.  Now an
inextricable fixture on our cultural landscape, the pageant defines,
glorifies, and objectifies Woman as a prescription for all time.  An
evening spent watching the Miss America proceedings on TV is like a
psychosexual time warp, dragging us back to a kinder, simpler time when
the female of the species need not worry itself over difficult issues
like voting or wearing shoes.  So it was not without a sense of irony
that I walked down the cinema for a screening Sally Field's Beautiful.</P>
<P>     Irony is the central force of Field's representative pageantry, and
in the tradition of Drop Dead Gorgeous, it is no disappointment.  But
this is also a human story, about women in search of identity and
belonging.</P>
<P>     Mona (Minnie Driver) is a dubious beauty queen, having spent her
entire life contesting--against all reason and likelihood--for the crown
of Miss American Miss.  Though not graced with especially striking looks
from the outset, and born into a household that makes Hee Haw look
glamorous, Mona's years of determination and artificiality are finally
paying off.  She has become Miss Illinois.  Now, if she can keep her
false persona straight, she stands a chance of winning the crown.  And
if it weren't for the untimely suicide of her best friend's convalescent
patient and the disqualifying existence of her 7-year-old daughter
(played by Hallie Kate Eisenberg, that annoying little girl from the
Pepsi commercials), victory might be simple.</P>
<P>     Fortunately for moviegoers, life is not so simple.  But equally
unfortunately, much of this tale's delivery is bogged down by an
incongruous sense of vision.</P>
<P>     At the story's outset, it is compelling and funny.  Young Mona is
precocious and endearing as she struggles to grow up and prove her self
worth in the shadow of her alcoholic mother.  Her drive to win beauty
pageants is a believable compulsion, though fraught with ridiculous
overtones.  But, by the time Driver steps in to play the role, Mona has
become little more than a caricature.  She is absurd and unloving,
one-dimensional in her desire to win pageants and incapable of basic
human emotion.  This lack of humanity makes the character fundamentally
boring to watch, in spite of Driver's obvious talent.</P>
<P>     Eisenberg, however, is--though I so hate to admit it--quite good in
her role as the young Vanessa (except for the argument scenes, in which
her shrill screaming was more deafening than interesting).  Once we've
made it through the long, irritating period of watching how far Mona's
personality has degenerated, Eisenberg's performance as the story's
conscience-bearer is a much-needed refreshment.  Too quickly, though,
does this spiral into an uncontrollable finale of cheesy feminist
messages.</P>
<P>     Sally Field's direction is, for the most part, above par.  But this
film is disappointingly short on substance.  In the end, mothers and
daughters may bond over many of the movie's funnier, heartwarming
scenes, but most moviegoers will do well to wait for the DVD.</P>
