<P>It is a telling sign of how times have changed when the William Castle horror 
flick from eons ago, "House on Haunted Hill," passes for restraint in this 
jaded, anything-goes era of cheap thrills and gory violence. Sadly, this 
gore-laden remake of the original classic is another example of why the 
horror genre is dying - bloody thrills are never a substitute for character 
or plot. </P>
<P>Set in the 90's, we now have Stephen Price (Geoffrey Rush), a rich amusement 
park expert who knows how to draw screams from his customers, and relishes 
and prides himself on the visceral thrills he creates. His beautiful yet 
conniving wife, Evelyn (Famke Janssen), is having a birthday and Stephen 
plans to hold the bash at the House on Haunted Hill, formerly a mental asylum 
where the bloodiest, most savage murders took place this side of the Charlie 
Manson moon. Evelyn is not receptive to Stephen's morbid plans, nor to his 
inviting five unknown guests to spend the night at this house for 1 million 
dollars each. The catch is that they have to spend the entire night, no 
matter the consequences. </P>
<P>A splendid premise, as it was in the original, but the five-person group is 
hardly inviting company. There is Eddie Baker (Taye Diggs), a former athlete, 
Melissa Marr (Bridgette Wilson), a videographer who is fascinated by the 
house and its interiors, Donald Blackburn (Peter Gallagher), a doctor with a 
hidden agenda, and Sarah (Ali Arter), impersonating her boss with an agenda 
to just get the dough. </P>
<P>Since these five characters barely ignite our interest, we are left with 
Price and his wife, but their obscene shrewdness is a far cry from Vincent 
Price. Put simply, Rush overacts to the nth degree yet Janssen at least would 
have a field day if she was cast in a remake of "Double Indemnity" - she has 
fire, passion and a heart of coal. The dynamic Famke puts the rest of the 
cast to shame. </P>
<P>The house at least has some character but the shots of the interiors and the 
hallways are rendered so darkly that it may as well be Freddy Krueger's 
boiler room. Contrast this house with its 1958 counterpart, and at least the 
latter was somewhat inviting yet a sense of dread enveloped the place. Oh, 
my, how I miss the glory of black-and-white.</P>
<P>The biggest difference between the original and this remake is the 
introduction of the asylum and the horrors that once inhabited it. There is a 
curious 1931 prologue with Jeffrey Combs ("Reanimator") as some mad doctor 
who conducted grisly experiments, shown in docu-style, black-and-white 
footage. Sadly, none of this is really followed up on. Instead, we get 
high-pitched screams and fits, lots of canted angles, and a few gory deaths, 
not to mention a highly laughable special-effects monster that would barely 
scare Sigourney Weaver's Ripley. No wit, no scares, no purpose, and as with 
most recent remakes, no need.</P>
