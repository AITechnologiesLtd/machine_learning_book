<P>The second Jackal-based film to come out in 1997 (the other starring
Bruce Willis was simply entitled THE JACKAL), this one stars Aidan
Quinn and Donald Sutherland, and is directed by a man who hailed from
JoBlo's own alma matter, Concordia University in Montreal, Canada. The
story is based on the exploits of the real terrorist known as the
Jackal, but does not pretend to be 100% factual.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Naval Officer Ramirez (Quinn) gets called upon by the CIA to
impersonate the international terrorist known as the Jackal, in order
to put an end to the actual militant's radical activities. He is chosen
for this role because he physically resembles the real terrorist to a
tee. Ramirez reluctantly agrees to take part in this "assignment", and
soon finds himself wrapped up in a true web of international terrorism,
intrigue and double-personality syndrome (which does not sit well with
his uninformed wife and kids back in the States.)</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Great premise is executed with enough style and thrills to keep the
piece interesting throughout its close to two-hour runtime. Admittedly,
I wasn't a huge fan of any of the main actors in this film, and didn't
expect much from this movie beforehand, but surprisingly it did have
its thrilling moments, as well as a mostly plausible and absorbing
story line. The first hour is mostly just a build-up of things to come,
and does offer a great characterization of the Jackal, but the second
hour is the one that really cranks in the cool scenes and a sweet
ending.</P>
<P>Quinn was adequate in both roles as Naval Officer Ramirez and the real
Jackal, but didn't offer anything extraordinary, in my opinion.
Sutherland and Kingsley seem to be playing the same role that they've
played in both of their respective careers of late, but nonetheless,
appeared to relish the cold-heartedness of their chosen characters. I
didn't like performance put forth from Quinn's wife in this flick, but
then again, she doesn't show up in most of the film, so that wasn't so
bad.</P>
<P>I did however enjoy director Duguay's interesting style and cinematic
vision. This thriller could easily have been boring during many
sequences, but Duguay always seemed to find something interesting to
show the viewer. I thought that was neat. Having said that, I didn't
think the first hour needed to be as long as it was, and the film did
have me tinkering on the bridge of believability when the "fake" Jackal
met with the "real" Jackal's girlfriend without much retrospection on
her part, but all in all, not too many complaints in a movie that could
easily be enjoyed by all those who take pleasure in the spy and
terrorist thriller genre.   </P>
<P>Little Known Facts: 
Ben Kingsley's real name is Krishna Banji, he stands 5"8, was born in
Scarborough, England, and won the Best Actor honor in 1982's Academy
Awards presentation for the title role he portrayed in GHANDI.
Many scenes from this film were actually shot in Montreal, Canada
(JoBlo's haven of restfulness).
Donald Sutherland has fathered actor Kiefer Sutherland, is Canadian,
and apparently still owns a place in the North of Montreal.<HR>Visit JoBlo's Movie Reviews
