<PRE>                                    DESPERADO
                        A film review by Christopher Null
                         Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez seem to have two things in
common: an affection for old surfer-style tunes, and an unconditional
love of blood.  Both play heavy parts in Rodriguez's eye-popping new
flick, DESPERADO, the $8 million sequel to his $7,000 first feature, EL
MARIACHI, which lives up to the hype surrounding it.</P>
<P>     In DESPERADO, Antonio Banderas takes the role of the mariachi with
no name who leads a charmed life while everything around him dies.
This sequel is the story of his quest for revenge against the men who
killed the woman he loved and shot him in the hand.  El Mariachi
travels from town to town with a guitar case full of ultra-powerful
weapons, in search for tough guy Bucho, leader of the thugs.  As he
closes in, things get bloodier and bloodier until the final showdown
where everything is revealed.  Along the way, he encounters Carolina
(Salma Hayek), his newfound love interest, who saves his life more than
once through some impromptu surgeries.</P>
<P>     Banderas is simply incredible in his role as the man of few words
and many bullets.  Steve Buscemi, Cheech Marin, and Tarantino all have
solid supporting parts, mainly for much-needed comic relief, and Hayek
is passable in her role, although her romance with Banderas seems a
little forced.  (I suspect meddling from the studio gave birth to the
steamier scenes).</P>
<P>     While the black comedy of DESPERADO is good, Rodriguez is still a
better director/editor than writer, and the wickedly cool gunplay
sequences are clearly the prime reason to see the film.  Although not
for the faint of heart, the seriously gory fights that El Mariachi gets
into are spectacularly arranged and innovatively photographed, and they
bring new life to the action movie genre.  Unfortunately for other
action filmmakers, Rodriguez has raised the stakes and is clearly now
"the one to beat."  He even manages to work in an anti-drug message for
the kids in the audience.</P>
<P>     DESPERADO is faithful to the backstory of EL MARIACHI, and even
Carlos Gallardo, the original man in black, returns as Banderas's right
hand man.  The only thing missing is the best "character" from the
original: the dog, who rode off into the sunset with Gallardo at the
end of EL MARIACHI.  I guess you can't have everything.</P>
<P>     For raw entertainment value, DESPERADO is one of the best bets to
come along in months.  Be warned, though: there's enough blood here to
fill a swimming pool.  And on the big screen, you'll feel like you're
swimming in it.</P>
