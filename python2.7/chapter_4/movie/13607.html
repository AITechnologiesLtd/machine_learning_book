SUPER FEATURES:   The story</PRE>

<P>ERMO is one of those films that we just about expect to see in the western
countries. And, really, it may signal either a commentary on the outside
world, or it may display something about human nature and its fickle way and
style.</P>
<P>It is a story that can best be described as "keeping up with the Jones' and
doing it a step better".</P>
<P>Ermo, is a young married housewife that is a bit frustrated, because her
husband is disabled and she has to do the work. She spends much of her time
making noodles and taking them to town to sell them. In comes up a
neighbour, whose own wife he doesn't get along with. And he helps her go to
town to sell her stuff.</P>
<P>Ermo's child is constantly going to the neighbor's house to watch TV,
something that irks her to no end, and she resolves to get the biggest TV
that she can find. And instead of selling noodles, she ends up getting
another job and also giving away blood for various causes.</P>
<P>And although most things in this film happen accidentally, like the blood
giving, it is clear that Ermo is decided that she is going to go one up on
her neighbour. And she will do whatever it takes to get there.</P>
<P>And get there she does. And the whole town is now parked in her house
watching TV, and her disabled husband is no longer made fun of, except
lightly.  And the film ends in a note that is disconcerting to say the
least, although it may not mean anything. Ermo got it, but did not expect to
catch the "snow" on it in the middle of the night, when the stations are
signed  off.</P>
<P>It is a really well done, and written satire in many aspects, and it spares
no ideas when it decides to make fun of the people that are so dedicated to
the world of television. But above it all, the film, is really a knock on
the new life style, that is TV ridden, and not work oriented. Everything
seems to be planned that way. Work so hard to get to this point?  It becomes
a subtle statement about an empty society, and it is presumed that the  west
is looked at this way..... but the people are seeing this stuff in a totally
new light, and this time in color, although we were never shown the
neighbor's TV, which is obviously smaller.  To them, the outside is a  brand
new world.</P>
<P>While this is not a great film, with outstanding values in production like
Zhang Yimou, or Chen Kaige, it still is a sign that the vitality of the
Chinese film industry has been active, and not wasting its time. And it
should hit a much more lucrative larger market, as soon as China learns  to
work with the west a little better, through Hong Kong, if this is the
path that it takes.</P>
<P>Other than that, this is a nice film where the eccentric live, and the poor
come and watch. But it has some rather nice moments. And the dedication to
its goal, in Ermo's mind are worth the sight.</P>
<P>Very enjoyable film, although there really is nothing fancy, or artistic
about it... it just is.</P>
