<P>If there's one thing in common about all of Hollywood's major studios,
it's that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more.
Although Twentieth Century Fox and New Line Cinema have spawned
subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion
pictures (Fox Searchlight and Fine Line respectively), it's obvious
there's no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at
the theater. So when a movie like Gary Ross' PLEASANTVILLE comes along,
wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of
fine production, it's a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the
cineplexes. </P>
<P>Although the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and
lighthearted, PLEASANTVILLE should not be mistaken for a no-thought
movie. Quite the opposite is true, in fact, as Director Ross skillfully
brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the
screen. The story, both about the joys of living life to the fullest as
well as the social ills of segregation, captures the essence of
statement-making in the cinema. Not in recent memory has a movie carried
such weight of theme into widescale distribution, and even if mass
audiences fail to see the ingenuity of Ross' work, it is still a
testament that his picture was considered worthy enough. Kudos to both
he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture. </P>
<P>It stars Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon as two nineties teenagers
who, through quite a bit of luck, find themselves zapped into a fifties
sitcom named "Pleasantville." Maguire, as the reserved Bud Parker, is
perfect for the pseudo-world; but the rebellious Mary Sue (Witherspoon)
is not at all made for the father-knows-best times. It's not long before
she sets the town of Pleasantville on end, and begins to teach the
townspeople - in a quite unlikely way - what life is *really* like. Soon
hues of color creep into the black and white world, and while some
embrace the change in the passion of realism, others fear the
strangeness. At one end is a soda shop owner-turned-painter named Mr.
Johnson (Jeff Daniels) and at the other end is a close-minded mayor
(J.T. Walsh) and his chamber of commerce; but the two sides are simply
fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town. </P>
<P>Fine performances are turned in all around. Maguire and Witherspoon are
effective as the leads, but the true complements go out to Jeff Daniels
and J.T. Walsh (in his latest and final posthumous performance). Daniels
brings an atmosphere of awe, inspiration, and hope to his character,
whereas Walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness - almost to the
point where you can sense Gene Hackman's envy. For Daniels, it's his
most commendable performance of the last three years - or more - and for
Walsh, it's a complementary exclamation point on a fine career. Also of
lesser note is the supporting role by Joan Allen, and in viewing the
entire cast works well together from start to finish. There's not much
to dislike about PLEASANTVILLE, and its dynamic nature makes it the
perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who don't.</P>
