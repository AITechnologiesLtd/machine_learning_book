<PRE>FIGHT CLUB
Directed by David Fincher</PRE>
<P>         "The first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight
Club," says ringmaster Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), addressing a group of
eager young men who've assembled in the basement of a seedy bar to beat
each other senseless. "The second rule of Fight Club is you do not talk
about Fight Club."</P>
<P> Ah, but rules were made to be broken, and it's a safe bet
everyone who sees director David Fincher's brutal, stylistically
brilliant "Fight Club" will have something to say about it. Given the
current climate of political correctness, most of those comments will be
negative, denouncing the movie for glamorizing violence and terrorism or
shaming the script's anti-everything stance.</P>
<P> Those with long memories will recall there was once another
picture which earned the same kinds of criticisms when it was first
released: Stanley Kubrick's 1971 masterpiece "A Clockwork Orange." If
"Orange" was a bitter answer to the "all you need is love" message of
the late 1960s, "Club" is a brass-knuckled slap in the face to yuppiedom
and its "greed is good" mantra.</P>
<P> Chuck Palahniuk's 1996 novel was compared in some critical
quarters to J.G. Ballard's "Crash" in its depiction of outsiders brought
together by shared passions for pain. But Ballard's characters were
cryptic and mostly voyeuristic, while "Fight Club" is made up of
everyday people, the same kinds of educated, mildly successful guys
you'd find in any office building or apartment complex.</P>
<P> One of them is our nameless narrator (Edward Norton), a recall
coordinator for a major car company. He's a drab, joyless, constantly
exhausted drone who finds his only fulfillment in life comes from
crashing support group meetings, such as those for victims of testicular
cancer or "incest survivors."</P>
<P> When he crosses pathes first with chain-smoking "tourist" Marla
Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) and then with the mysterious soap salesman
Tyler Durden, our hero begins to rethink his entire life and to wonder
why he's let himself be defined by the IKEA and Crate and Barrel
furnishings decorating his condo. "The things you own end up owning
you," Tyler tells him.</P>
<P> Fight Club, the new outlet for the narrator's built-up
hostility, is an exclusive society in which the members pummel each
other with their bare fists; black eyes, shattered jaws and broken teeth
are this club's equivalent of the secret handshake. But what begins as a
bloody good time eventually mutates into something bigger and more
dangerous as Fight Club organizer Tyler becomes increasingly messianic
and starts giving out "homework assignments" to his devotees.</P>
<P> "We have no Great War, no Great Depression," insists Tyler.
"Our great war is a spiritual war, our great depression is our lives."
The sermonette resounds with the Fight Club followers, and it's likely
to ring a familiar bell with many of the twenty- and thirtysomethings in
the audience. The movie is quite astute in recognizing and capitalizing
on the resentment felt by a large portion of our blue-collar and
white-collar workforce, the people who live paycheck to paycheck and
badly want to believe that a new car or a larger wardrobe will magically
change their circumstances.</P>
<P> Even if you can't accept its message, "Fight Club" may still
draw you in through Fincher's spellbinding scene compositions and clever
use of digital animation and extreme close-ups. Like all his work, the
film is dark and moody -- the actors are almost always seen in
half-light or shadows or varying shades of black -- but at the same time
there's a feverish urgency in the storytelling. Although the movie is
almost two and a half hours long, it seems to whiz past your eyes like a
graffiti-covered subway train.</P>
<P> After seriously damaging his credibility with wooden
performances in "The Devil's Own," "Seven Years in Tibet" and the
sleep-inducing "Meet Joe Black," Pitt rebounds spectacularly here,
turning Tyler into a hustler who's equal parts smarm and charm. Carter,
speaking in a brittle accent reminiscent of Judy Davis, is engagingly
batty; listen for the song she sings on her way out of Tyler's
dilapidated house.</P>
<P> Norton, however, is flat-out amazing in the kind of part most
actors would dismiss as being unplayable. He's required to be the
movie's moral center, as well as milk humor out of bizarre situations
(such as a soon-to-be classic moment in his boss' office) and undergo a
near-complete personality transformation in the course of the action.
Norton does it all, and much more, subtly conveying his attraction to
Tyler and his disillusionment with what he sees as the perversion of his
dream.</P>
<P> That's important because anyone who pays attention will see the
movie is not an endorsement of anarchy, but a warning about what can
happen in a world full of confused, angry men without any positive role
models to follow. Yet Fincher's film will probably be condemned by many
of the same moviegoers who turned mindless schlock like "Double
Jeopardy" (in which we're asked to root for Ashley Judd's character to
track down and kill her husband) and "The General's Daughter" (which
turns a rape victim into a dominatrix before giving us a lengthy
depiction of her murder) into major box office hits. If it does nothing
else, "Fight Club" should serve to point out the hypocracy of the
general public, which begs for gun control and stricter enforcement of
movie ratings one moment and drops its kids off at the video store to
pick up "The Matrix" the next. James Sanford</P>
