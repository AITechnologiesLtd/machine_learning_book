<P>     David and Diana Murphy (Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore) are the
ideal young couple.  They have everything--love, affection,
companionship--except money.  Their combined meager income is just
enough to keep them afloat, but when the recession hits and David loses
his job, they go under.  Needing fifty thousand dollars to satisfy
their creditors, but possessing only five, they go to Vegas to get the
rest at the tables.  There they meet John Gage (Robert Redford), a
billionaire businessman who throws around millions like pocket change.
Gage is instantly attracted to Diana and, in an attempt to lure her
away from her husband, makes a proposal: he will give David one
million dollars for one night with his wife.</P>
<P>     Director Adrian Lyne, best known for bringing FATAL ATTRACTION to
the screen, is at the helm for INDECENT PROPOSAL.  One of the key
elements of the 1987 Glenn Close/Michael Douglas thriller--obsession--
is present here, albeit without the tension and violence that gave
FATAL ATTRACTION its spark.  Here, a similar-yet-different situation is
examined from another perspective.  Gage goes after Diana not with
knives and threats, but with kind words, generous gifts, and moving
tales of his youth.</P>
<P>     There are undercurrents of a fabulous movie in INDECENT PROPOSAL,
but too few of them surface.  The plot is littered with small
implausibilities and several too-obvious plot devices.  There are also
moments of manipulation that are so obvious that the director should
hang his head in shame for thinking to bring tears to the eyes of the
viewers through such a lack of subtlety.</P>
<P>     The story is divided into three parts:  the setup, the "act," and
the aftermath.  Despite a somewhat confused sense of time early in the
film, most of the first part works.  We get a real sense of character
and the relationship between Diana and David comes across as genuine.
Woody Harrelson, who often doesn't seem up to his role, gives his best
performance in the first forty minutes.</P>
<P>     The second part of the story is equally as good, owing in large
part to strong performances by Demi Moore and Robert Redford.  Redford,
no longer the sex symbol he once was, manages to do an effective job as
a jaded, lonely man who wants nothing more than to capture the one
thing that has eluded him for his entire life: love.</P>
<P>     Would that the last hour of the film was as good as the first.
The two major flaws in the story come during this section, one at the
beginning and one at the end.  It's difficult to imagine the characters
doing some of the things they do, and obvious that the demands of the
story are forcing them to act differently from what we expect.  It's
almost impossible to believe that a marriage as strong as that between
David and Diana could be put under this much pressure by something
that, in its essence, is simple.</P>
<P>     I suppose the message of the movie is that money can't buy love,
but that message gets so muddled during the second half of the film
that we're not sure what to believe by the end.  The last few scenes
are a distinct let-down as the writer resorts to a hard-to-believe quick
fix to conclude things.</P>
<P>     Another problem is that the characters overexplain things.  From
the voice-over narration to the incessant unnecessary commentary,
nothing is left to the viewer to figure out on his or her own.  Any
time there could be a misinterpretation of what has gone on, someone
will say something to clarify matters.  For a movie that is supposed to
be a "thinking romance," this one doesn't have a high opinion of who's
supposed to be doing the thinking.</P>
<P>     As I mentioned earlier, while Moore and Redford hold their own
nicely, Woody Harrelson has trouble once his role requires more from
him than smiles, kisses, and tender stroking.  He goes through all the
motions, but the force of emotion necessary for us to empathize with
David is absent.  As a result, we see what happens but don't form a
necessary bond with him.</P>
<P>     INDECENT PROPOSAL begins with a premise that, while not new, can
be interesting to explore.  The movie gets off to a good start, but the
need to mold the story into a recognizable Hollywood "type" hurts its
chances of saying or being anything better than mediocre.  Director
Adrian Lyne may not be remaking FATAL ATTRACTION, but the same
audience-pleasing mentality is evident in the surprisingly-stagnant
INDECENT PROPOSAL.</P>
