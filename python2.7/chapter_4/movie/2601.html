                                   by
                           Gary Michael Dault</PRE>
<P>     A widow's peak is what you'd usually call that little dart of hair
pointing down to your eyebrows--Count Floyd had a serious one, for
example--but in the case of John Irvin's new film, WIDOWS' PEAK, is a
place.  A literally named place, too: a hill overlooking a small Irish
town named Kilshannon, upon which are situated a number of houses
solely inhabited by a gaggle of widows.</P>
<P>     Of these assorted widows, one takes precedence.  The formidable
Mrs. Doyle-Counihan (Joan Plowright) is a well-to-do matriarch who
does not suffer fools gladly, not even her rather foolish son Godfrey
(Adrian Dunbar), the only man permitted to live up on Widows' Peak.
Godfrey is a highly eligible bachelor, mostly because he is virtually
the sole candidate.</P>
<P>     Mrs. Doyle-Counihan's chief amusement, in addition to keeping
tabs on the community, is being driven about Widows' Peak and
Kilshannon in her regal Rolls-Royce, piloted by her salty,
cigar-smoking female chauffeur (chauffeuse?).  Mrs. D-C waves airily
at the villagers as if she were the Queen--which, in Widows' Peak, she
is.</P>
<P>     Let's see now.  There's only one other outsider (Godfrey is an
outsider because of his sex) allowed to live in the otherwise
widow-dense village: the quietly mysterious and oddly
vulnerable-seeming, penniless, middle-aged spinster Miss O'Hare (Mia
Farrow).  Everyone seems to keep a motherly eye on Miss O'Hare, for
reasons that are unclear for quite a long time.</P>
<P>     Be patient, now--just a teeny little more plot.  Miss O'Hare
suddenly starts receiving the courtship overtures of Clancy, the town's
dentist (Jim Broadbent).  Into this not very volatile mix comes, all
the way from America, the glamorous war-widow Edwina Broome (Natasha
Richardson).  Slim and sleek in her creamy Chanel suits, capped teeth
as white as tiny refrigerator doors, lips as red as a wicked witch's
apple, hats as wide as open umbrellas, her blonde hair tumbling down
from her hairpins just often enough to make your chest tighten whenever
it happens--she's lovely, is Mrs.  Broome (a new Broome sweeps clean),
and really, she's too much for Widows' Peak.</P>
<P>     She's certainly too much for Miss O'Hare, who appears to despise
her (Mrs. Broome appears to despise her back).  And when Godfrey
predictably falls in love with the beautiful Americanized English
widow, she's almost too much for the redoubtable Mrs. Doyle-Counihan.</P>
<P>     So then this is ENCHANTED APRIL again?  All cloche hats (this is
the '20s), champagne, beautiful motor cars, flirting and shy,
gentlemanly declarations of affection?</P>
<P>     No, WIDOWS' PEAK is a mystery story.  A funny, charming, witty
mystery story, murder and mirth in equal measure.</P>
<P>     Now this is difficult to manage.  So difficult that, as delightful
as much of WIDOWS' PEAK is, there is a lot of warping and distorting of
the action and even of the nature of the personalities involved in
order for the mystery to happen.  The script of WIDOWS' PEAK--which is
that increasing rarity, an original work--is by Irish writer Hugh
Leonard.  Leonard is a clever bloke--he's a novelist and playwright as
well as a screenwriter and prolific writer of fodder for television.
His best known work is probably his play DA, a considerable success on
Broadway in 1978 (where it won Leonard a Tony Award).</P>
<P>     Having established Leonard's cleverness, it must now be said that
WIDOWS' PEAK is just a little bit too clever.  Sure, the plot is
devious enough to keep you happily befuddled until the very end--which
is nice--but when you look back over the journey, it all seems pretty
incredible.  In fact the more you ponder it, the more unsatisfying and
unlikely the whole thing becomes.  In the end, it's the charm you go
for, not the revelation.</P>
<P>     One of the problems lies in the casting.  Natasha Richardson and
Joan Plowright seem fine (Natasha's accent wavers all over the place
but then I guess it's supposed to), but Mia Farrow feels wrong.
Originally, back in the early '80s when Hugh Leonard was trying to get
WIDOWS' PEAK produced, there was talk of Farrow and her mother, Maureen
O'Sullivan, taking the parts of Mrs. Broome and Miss O'Hare
respectively.  And now Mia plays the part originally intended for her
mater.  Quel irony.</P>
<P>     The trouble is--and it's a kind of tribute to Mia Farrow's
enduring ingenue good looks--that she doesn't look old enough or act
old enough to be this impecunious middle-aged spinster.  Wearing a
mothy old cardigan with holes in it is not a sufficient indication of
genteel poverty.  And she's much too perky to seem the age she's
playing.</P>
<P>     Then again, I cannot abide Mia Farrow's acting under scarcely any
circumstances at all.  For me, she's ruined every Woody Allen film
she's been in except for BROADWAY DANNY ROSE and HUSBANDS AND WIVES
(where she was expected to be as flat and two-dimensional as she
otherwise always is).  And here in WIDOWS' PEAK, La Farrow is flat,
tremulous and vague--with that trademark look of utter vacuity in her
eyes that frequently seems to get mistaken for depth of feeling or
something.  Anyhow, WIDOWS' PEAK would fare better without her.</P>
<P>     Director John Irvin, best known probably as an action director for
such films as HAMBURGER HILL (1986), GHOST STORY (1981) and Arnold
Schwarzenegger's RAW DEAL (1985), does well enough with WIDOWS' PEAK,
proving that, despite being saddled with Ms Farrow, he can still muster
a light touch.</P>
