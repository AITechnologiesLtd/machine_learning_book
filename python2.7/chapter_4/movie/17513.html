<PRE>A REVIEW OF "TRUE CRIME"
by Ryan Ellis</PRE>
<P>give me a buzz on the ol' e-lines, <A HREF="mailto:iluvmick@hotmail.com">iluvmick@hotmail.com</A></P>
<P>The decade of the '90s has not been infinitely wonderful for
Clint Eastwood. The Hollywood icon followed "Unforgiven" with "In
The Line Of Fire", then did some sub-par films like "Absolute
Power" & "Midnight In The Garden Of Good And Evil". Those first
two films are much, much better than the second two or even "A
Perfect World". So it's safe to say that Eastwood has slipped in
the latter part of the decade after a couple of near-brilliant
pictures. The decade ends with his latest, "True Crime", a
thriller with plenty of ups & downs. Not quite a top-notch
effort, this film is watchable more for Eastwood's fine acting
than his acceptable, yet standard, directing.</P>
<P>Eastwood stars as Steve Everett, a crack reporter for the Oakland
Tribune who is long in the tooth and living on reputation. To
give this movie a nice dose of humanity, Everett is written as a
thoroughly flawed character (aren't we all thoroughly flawed
characters?). He's a recovering alcoholic who cares only about
himself in his quest for self-fulfillment. Despite having a
wonderful family--an attractive wife & an adorable daughter--he's
a philaderer too. Basically, he's a real person with real
problems. And he's a person who has his own journalistic
standards. After all, Everett resigned from a prestigious
newspaper when his bosses wouldn't print some juicy details he
digs up about the mayor while working in New York. Eastwood plays
this character very well, making us like him even though he's
such a selfish rascal.</P>
<P>Everett is rumbling through life in Oakland, carrying on in an
affair with his editor's wife and also trying to score with a
young female reporter. After that young reporter dies in a car
accident, Everett is assigned to fill in for her and do a fluff
interview with a young black prisoner, Frank Beachum (Isaiah
Washington), in San Quentin. Beachum is scheduled to be put to
death by lethal injection that night for the shooting murder of a
white pregnant woman in a convenience store. Editor Bob Findley
(Denis Leary) phones his own home to discover Everett just
dressing after a tryst with Bob's wife. He gives the assignment
to the notorious old reporter, partly hoping Everett will screw
up and get himself fired. And going against orders by not just
writing a low-key human interest piece, the man with the "nose"
snoops around to see if young Beachum really is guilty or not.</P>
<P>On his odyssey of fact-finding, Everett has an unfortunate
incident with his cute little daughter at the zoo, interviews a
key witness who has dubious information about the murder, and
struggles through the tense situation at work. Meanwhile, Beachum
sits on death row, awaiting a fate he may or may not deserve. He
claims he's innocent of the murder, but cannot offer any evidence
to clear his name. In fact, only Everett and Beachum's family
even care about whether or not this man is innocent since Beachum
has been sitting on death row for 6 years. It's old news to most
people, including the lawyers and witnesses involved. Everett's
snooping reveals surprises and other clues, eventually leading
him to believe that maybe Beachum is indeed innocent. His only
task is to find some kind of proof. In a bubble-gum, car-chasing,
action finale Everett races to try and beat the clock and find
that elusive proof.</P>
<P>"True Crime" is a manipulating film. It tugs at the heartstrings
by making us like a man who may in fact be a murderer. It makes
us like Everett too, even though he's not an upstanding citizen
and everything he does is either selfish or rebellious. Even the
prison employees are likable since they are not portrayed as
typical movie monsters who inhumanely brutalize the criminals.
The most obvious heartstring puller, though, has to be the
portrayal of both Beachum's daughter and Everett's daughter. Who
can resist such innocence and sweetness? These young girls
provide a direct contrast to the ominous task of a (legal) murder
that is looming at 12:01 that night. So the manipulating is
tolerable because it isn't overly sentimental, yet Eastwood dares
you to dislike the likable main characters.</P>
<P>The script is solid, if predictable. It provides a good analysis
of the whole death penalty process. Also, we get a small glimpse
into the fast-moving politics of a newspaper office. James Woods
plays the Senior Editor, Alan Mann, in his typically dynamic way.
He's got the best lines and gets some good laughs. The only major
contrivance is that this one reporter could discover so many
clues that no one else could find after 6 years! He may be a good
reporter, but if a team of detectives and lawyers can't figure
out some of the things that Everett does, maybe we need a brand
new justice system! I can't reveal an even bigger contrivance in
the picture because it would give away the ending. Still, the
script delves pretty deeply into these characters considering
that the majority of the movie takes place in a 24-hour period.
Call this a day-in-the-life of a scoundrel reporter and a nice
guy "murderer".</P>
<P>Eastwood's direction is okay, but to call this a walk in the park
would be understating it. It's verrrrry deliberate pace almost
undermines the script and its characters before the long-awaited
climax. It's a long 2 hours to watch this film, but a fulfilling
2 hours all the same. Perhaps an extra few seconds comes from
Eastwood's use of slo-mo a couple of different times. This is
notable because he said he didn't like slo-mo during the American
Film Institute's "100 Years, 100 Movies" show last year and
rarely uses the technique. It's also ironic that this is set in
Oakland because Eastwood has set so many films in the city right
across the bay--San Francisco.</P>
<P>Since "True Crime" is a quiet thriller with "whodunnit"
overtones, it isn't for all tastes. I predicted the final result,
but I still had plenty of thinking to do along the way. It's a
thinking man's movie. Along with some social commentary about the
death penalty, Eastwood has crafted a film that doesn't claim to
have all the answers--mostly about marital and work troubles.
Eastwood should also be commended for not stereotyping the black
"murderer" or Beachum's family. Isaiah Washington is muted and
doesn't exactly remind one of Denzel Washington, but he's
sympathetic and likable in his role. Ultimately, the final
pay-off isn't monumental and that keeps this film from being an
instant Eastwood classic. "True Crime" is a solid film with
interesting characters--a pretty nice counter to all those teen
films out there right now!</P>
<P>USELESS TRIVIA--Clint Eastwood's daughter in "True Crime" is his
real daughter as well. The adorable girl's mother is Frances
Fisher (who also appears briefly in this film). Mother Fisher
appeared in "Unforgiven" with Eastwood. Make the connection...</P>
