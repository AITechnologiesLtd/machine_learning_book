<PRE>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 69</PRE>
<P>"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" was originally a
successful play by Tennessee Williams, who had
earlier created a sensation with "A Streetcar
Named Desire".  For the film adaptation,
some changes had to be made to get past Hollywood
censors, and to prevent Paul Newman from
playing a character with homosexual overtones.</P>
<P>Newman plays Brick, a former football hero who
has become an angry alcoholic.  His wife is
Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor), an aggressive Southern
belle whose frequent attempts to seduce Brick
are always rebuffed.  They are visiting the
mansion of Brick's father Big Daddy (Burl Ives),
a wealthy, domineering man who has terminal
cancer.  Brick's grasping brother Gooper (Jack
Carson) is also at the mansion, along with his
pregnant, obnoxious wife Mae (Madeleine Sherwood)
and their bratty little kids.</P>
<P>Although one would imagine that Big Daddy's
estate would go to his wife Ida (Judith Anderson)
upon his death, the plot has the brothers'
families battling for the estate.  Big Daddy
despises Gooper and his family, but is also
unwilling to cede everything to his other son,
whom along with his marriage is deeply troubled.
Also, the terminal nature of Big Daddy's illness
has not been disclosed to him, and both he and
his wife are in denial.</P>
<P>The story provides the frame for a script loaded
with impassioned speeches and vicious arguments;
the final outcome amazingly creating a happy ending
with Newman's personal demons apparently cured.
While never boring, the intense drama is sometimes
overblown.  Newman constantly drinks but, except
for the opening scene, is never drunk.  It is also
difficult to believe Taylor's faith in her
embittered husband, and that she would repeatedly
throw her gorgeous self at him despite his rejection.</P>
<P>The film achieved strong commercial and critical
success despite its excesses.  It was nominated
for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture,
Best Actor (Newman), Best Actress (Taylor), Best
Director (Richard Brooks), Best Adapted Screenplay
(Brooks and James Poe), and Best Color Cinematography
(William Daniels).</P>
