<PRE>RATING:  ***  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1991)</PRE>
<P>        DEFENDING YOUR LIFE is an imaginative vision of the afterlife from
the twisted mind of writer-director Albert Brooks, who also stars in the
comedy.</P>
<P>        After dying in a car crash, on his birthday of all days, Brooks
wakes up in Judgement City, a satirical rendition of purgatory where higher
beings evaluate the lives of newly deceased earthlings.  Brooks has five
days to convince two judges that he's worthy of passing on to higher plains
of existence.  Enter Rip Torn as the slick lawyer who defends Brooks in
court against prosecutor Lee Grant.  During his "trial," Brooks must view
episodes of his life on a movie screen, and these scenes are both
hysterically funny and painfully poignant.  It's impossible to resist
chuckling (and cringing) at Brooks as he and Torn try to explain away his
cowardly behavior on earth.  Torn, in particular, is in vintage comic form,
and he walks away with the picture.</P>
<P>The movie also features Meryl Streep, appealing as the love-interest, and
Shirley MacLaine, who pops up in a hilarious cameo.  While the film is
uneven, many of its gags are priceless.  Take, for example, the food in
Judgement City: it's always the most delicious you've ever tasted ... and
it's also CALORIE-FREE--so chow down!</P>
