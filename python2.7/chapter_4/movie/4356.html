<PRE>                        LENINGRAD COWBOYS GO AMERICA
                       A film review by Lons Ponschock
                        Copyright 1995 Lons Ponschock</PRE>
<PRE>A film by Aki Kaurismaki
Stars a truly International Cast
(1989) PG-13, 80 mins.
Cameos Jim Jarmusch, Duke Robillard</PRE>
<P>     It's got accordions in it.  There's cool points for that.  And
subtitles but not many and ... what else?  Oh yeah, the hair.  The
hair is really good.  And the shoes are excellent: just the right
touch.</P>
<PRE>    LENINGRAD COWBOYS is a hoot.</PRE>
<P>     If Richard Lester (A HARD DAY'S NIGHT, HELP!) were Finnish, he'd
be Aki Kaurismaki.  And remember, we have a lot of Finnish brethren and
sistren around here.  I run into the Valmet folks all the time.  Here
is an example of Finnish humor at it's most deadpan farcical best: a
Monty Python meets the Flying Burrito Brothers.</P>
<P>     The Leningrad Cowboys are a rock 'n' roll band.  They sometimes
play accordions, but mostly they are a rock 'n' roll band.</P>
<P>     Trust me, LENINGRAD COWBOYS is a lot of fun ... a road movie with
music and Jim Jarmusch (MYSTERY TRAIN, A NIGHT ON EARTH) in a used car
lot.  The band goes from Russia to New York, New Orleans, Texas and
finally Mexico where the accordions and all that come in handy again.
I have tried to explain my love of accordions often whether it be
Conjunto, Zydeco or Oompah music, but alas, accordions are apparently
for discriminating tastes.</P>
<P>     I usually watch these vids by myself.  The sign of a good vid is
if you can pop your fingers and laugh out loud by yourself.  A really
good film like this one will remove all the inhibitions associated with
self-entertainment. ;-)</P>
<P>     Well-directed with a style bordering ... no, right *in* the country
of the absurd LENINGRAD COWBOYS GO AMERICA could be a modern classic if
somebody saw it besides me.  I guess it's the kind of show that is not
recognized by the slackers because it is too low brow and not
appreciated by the "film buffs" because ... well ... no one else saw it
*before* them.</P>
<PRE>    So have I given you enough reason to go rent this piece?</PRE>
<PRE>    I hope so.</PRE>
<P>     You can watch it and then amaze your friends with your subtle cool
taste and international erudition.  But mostly it's just plain good
fun.</P>
