<PRE>HAPPY ACCIDENTS
A film review by Jeremiah Kipp
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>My filmcritic.com colleague Norm Schrager nailed Session 9, Brad
Anderson's throwback to spooky horror films from the 70's.  It worked as
an eerie homage without being self-referential or smugly postmodern. 
Genre aficionados will acknowledge the similarities in tone to Stanley
Kubrick's The Shining and George Romero's Dawn of the Dead without being
taken out of the engrossing narrative (i.e., a psychologically addled
waste management team clears out an abandoned lunatic asylum;
unspeakable dread ensues).  In a double-whammy for 2001, Anderson shoots
and (mostly) scores again with his eclectic riff on time-travel episodes
from The Twilight Zone, appropriately titled Happy Accidents.</P>
<P>Much like Session 9, the cards are played very close to the vest here. 
Is boyish, eccentric "Sam Deed from Dubuque, Iowa" a futuristic voyager
from the year 2470 or just your run-of-the-mill psychologically
disturbed nutcase let loose on the present-day streets of NYC?  As
played by wonderful character actor Vincent D'Onofrio (Full Metal
Jacket), it's up in the air whether or not we should accept his detailed
monologues about life after the polar ice caps have melted.  The
question proves to be moot, at least for a time.  Even if the whole
thing proves to be a creative delusion, one agrees with the character
judgment passed down on him by his new girlfriend, Ruby (Marisa Tomei):
"He's a freak, but he sure tells a good story!"</P>
<P>Neurotic Ruby thinks she may have found True Love after a series of
nightmarish dating disasters (the Junkie, the Fetishist, the Artist, the
Frenchman, etc.), but isn't quite sure how to handle "Sam Deed" when he
starts explaining the barcode on his arm, his elaborately constructed
fake identity, his pathological fear of dogs, his ability to speak five
different languages, and his mission to change a crucial moment in time
that may have ramifications on time's alternate realities.  (Don't
ask.)  It's all a bit much to take in.  Ruby's close friend Gretchen
(cuz ya can't have a love story without the token friend, though Nadia
Dajani invests the thankless role with warmth) chalks it up as a sexy
role-playing game, but her cautious therapist (Holland Taylor) warns her
that co-dependency is rearing its ugly head again and she's in over her
head with yet another doomed relationship.  Who ya gonna believe?</P>
<P>Despite her winning an Academy Award, Marisa Tomei has always struck me
as an annoying and unwelcome screen presence, one that undermines the
pleasure of watching Happy Accidents.  Her brassy New Yawk attitude
never really meshes with her desperate desire to appear "cute" to her
adoring fans.  Being loud and flashing a (disingenuous) smile does not
necessarily equal "substantial and sexy."  It takes more than a crack
team of hair and wardrobe people to imbue her with personality.  Then
there's that damned voice, which strains to be oh-so-adorable.  Look,
this stuff is purely subjective.  Some people feel this way about
Richard Gere, others cannot bear to watch Robin Williams' hyperactive
schtick.  For my money, it's M. Tomei with a bullet.</P>
<P>Happy Accidents is a romantic comedy filtered through Twelve Monkeys
(or, more appropriately, Chris Marker's La Jetee, especially with those
still framed "memory" photographs Anderson employs as a stylistic device
throughout).  Modern Manhattan is filmed with an otherworldly, vaguely
alien eye with a color scheme oddly reminiscent of Logan's Run.  As the
stranger in a strange land, D'Onofrio walks slightly out-of-step,
wonderfully affable but often inscrutable with his wayward expressions
and bemused detachment.  This is science fiction told mainly via the
power of suggestion (though it often falls into the sci-fi trap of
having entirely too much forced exposition -- we want deeds, not words!)</P>
<P>At least twenty minutes too long, Happy Accidents eventually gets around
to a race-against-time scenario that puts "Sam Deed" to the Ultimate
Test.  No movie can live in ambiguity forever, but Anderson seems
terminally unable to provide satisfactory conclusions to his otherwise
well structured recent narratives.  (Let's pretend the loathsome and
predictable Next Stop Wonderland never happened, shall we?)  There are
also some slow, repetitive stretches as Ruby and Sam go over the same
arguments again and again over whether or not he's crazy.  The premise
is strong enough to sustain interest, but it's enough to throw a nod in
the general direction of Rod Serling for wrapping up his ideas in
half-hour time slots, commercials included.</P>
