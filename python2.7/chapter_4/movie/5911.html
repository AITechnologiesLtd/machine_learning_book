<PRE>                             CARLITO'S WAY
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<PRE>         [This is one of my golden oldies reviews - written years
          ago when I was just getting started and never posted.
          I stand by the conclusions, but in most cases many details
          are missing that I would normally include today.]</PRE>
<P>     I know I should have liked CARLITO'S WAY, but it just did not work
for me.  Granted there was a lot of dreamy music as you watched an old
time drug dealer played by Al Pacino trying to go straight.  His
performance was good albeit it fairly monotonous.</P>
<P>     Sean Penn was in it, and was wonderful as a drug taking, evil
lawyer.  This type of role is usually overacted, but Penn, who has been
done for overacting on too many occasions, was believable and
fascinating.  It MIGHT be worth going to see the show to see Penn's
performance, but I don't think so.</P>
<P>     The director was Brian De Palma.  He is a director who is willing
to take risks and his work product shows it.  He has directed some of
the best (THE AGE OF INNOCENCE, UNTOUCHABLES, BODY DOUBLE, SCARFACE,
and WISE GUYS) and some of the worse (RAISING CAIN and BONFIRE OF THE
VANITIES).  I would put CARLITO'S WAY as a so-so show, I give it **,
but I do not recommend it.</P>
<P>     Overall, I just could not care about these people.  They could
live or die; I didn't care.  If you do go, besides Penn's role to
enjoy, there are wonderful rain scenes in New York.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
