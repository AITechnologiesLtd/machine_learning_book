BAISE-MOI
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>Some people like to smoke after sex, but Manu (Raffaëla Anderson) and 
Nadine (Karen Bach) like to kill people afterwards.  BAISE-MOI (RAPE 
ME), which has the dubious distinction of being literally banned in 
France, could be a strikingly effective public service announcement 
against the dangers of casual sex if it weren't for the fact that Manu 
and Nadine like to murder strangers, male and female, indiscriminately 
even if no sex whatsoever is involved.  The reactions to the film are 
likely to be as widely varied as at our screening in which one guy 
laughed constantly, apparently seeing the film as a humorous THELMA & 
LOUISE DO PORN, and another woman remarked to me afterwards that a film 
like this could ruin sex for you forever.  A hyperviolent film which 
features real, not simulated, sex, it does have its erotic moments, the 
shocking rape scene not being one of them.  "We're useless," one of the 
women says to the other.  "Where are the witty lines?"  Amen.</P>
<P>BAISE-MOI runs 1:17.  The film is in French with English subtitles.  It 
is not rated but would be NC-17 for graphic, real sex, graphic violence, 
drug usage and language.  It would be acceptable for college students 
and older.</P>
