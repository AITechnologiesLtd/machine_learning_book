<P>The Austrian accent. The bulging biceps. The memorable punch-lines
uttered right before he empties an entire magazine into a swarm of
foolish villains. When it comes to pure action satisfaction, Arnold
Schwarzenegger is the man of the hour. The imposing star of such
blockbuster hits as `Terminator 2: Judgment Day', `Predator' and `True
Lies', Arnold has become a reliable synonym for the action genre. Of
course, when I say ‘reliable', I'm not including such hazardous bombs as
`Jingle All the Way' and the downright humiliating `Batman and Robin'.</P>
<P>In fact, since the fourth sequel in that misbegotten action series,
Arnie has taken a leave of absence from the silver screen. Just in time
for the year 2000, the millennial thriller `End of Days' marks his
delayed return. Here, Schwarzenegger plays struggling ex-cop Jericho
Cane (sounds almost.... biblical), who finds himself in the midst of an
enormous Satanic dilemma as the new millennium approaches. When I say
Satanic, I mean Beelzebub himself - who has arrived in New York City to
search for a mortal bride, which will signal the birth of the
Anti-Christ and the end of all human existence. All of this must happen
in the final hour before the year 2000 - don't ask me why. Ask
screenwriter Andrew W. Marlowe (`Air Force One'), who must have been
exposed to some mind-altering substance while penning this ridiculous
action film.</P>
<P>`End of Days' is a film written with remarkable stupidity. The plot is
tied messily together with absurd coincidences and dialogue that seems
to be extracted from out-takes of an Ernest movie. Many scenes border on
unintentional amusement, and a few shatter that barrier with ease. And
yet, there was a moment in `End of Days' when I just gave up on the
idiotic script and decided to embrace all of the Satanic shenanigans for
simple fun. This moment arrived when Jericho is greeted in his apartment
by an uninvited Lucifer, who has taken over the body of a Wall Street
banker in his attempt to hunt down the chosen bride. Inhabiting his new
body (which, coincidentally, is the wonderful Gabriel Byrne), Satan
tries to tempt Arnold with erasing a terrible memory from his past. It's
really a terrific scene, giving Byrne the chance to flash his demonic
charisma, and offering Satan a few snappy punch-lines (particularly when
he claims The Bible is merely an `overblown press kit').</P>
<P>This is Marlowe's one great scene of exchanging dialogue, and from
there, `End of Days' never looks back. Taking the ball is director Peter
Hyams, who knows how to frame a well-choreographed action sequence to
near perfection, and does so in a pair of extravagant scenes that
include all the usual Arnold ingredients: rapid gunfire, colossal
explosions and lots of physical exertion on the part of the star. The
stand-out is probably an impressively mounted and exciting chase on a
subway, in which Arnold protects Satan's bride-to-be (Robin Tunney) with
the man himself in hot pursuit. Frankly, I am sick and tired of hearing
all that crap about Hyams' tendency to be a ‘hack'. The man cannot build
characters, and he rarely derives a solid performance out of an actor,
but his photography is stylish and his technical approach is often
effective. His last film, 1996's creature feature `The Relic', is quite
the possibly the most underrated monster movie in recent memory.</P>
<P>Here, Hyams once again teams with special effects guru Stan Winston (who
also did creature effects for `The Relic'). Unfortunately, although
somewhat nifty, a large portion of the CGI work in `End of Days' is
disappointing and choppy. The only truly effective moment is the final
showdown in an abandoned church, where Winston's creature effects are
put to the test. Arnold himself is not given much room to function with
the character of Jericho, although a few amusing one-liners help matters
immensely. Playing the wisecracking partner Chicago, Kevin Pollack is
used specifically for comic leftovers, but as always, he's a good fellow
to have around. The one true performance that warrants a second
examination is Gabriel Byrne's, who is smashing fun as Satan's human
transport.</P>
<P>I suppose `End of Days', although thoroughly mediocre, is somewhat fun
in the end. It's likely to impress Arnold fanatics and action buffs who
don't mind the gratuitous gore and insanely moronic screenplay. I
enjoyed certain aspects of it - like the scene where Jericho has the
living tar beaten out of him by a little old nanny (Mariam Margolyes),
which is embarrassing for Arnold despite the fact the nanny is a
superpowered minion of Satan.
The action was cool. A few of the performances were enjoyable. For a
Y2K-based thriller, `End of Days' could have been so much more
intelligent and explosive - the showdown of Arnold and Satan should have
been classic. As is, it's merely ridiculous, embarrassing fun.</P>
