<PRE>                                   ANDRE
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1995 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     ANDRE is a kid's show based on a true story.  It is set in late
50s/early 60s in a remote fishing village in Maine.  The Dad (Keith
Carradine) makes his living as an admitted inept harbor master.  He is
more interested in animals than doing the labors of a harbor master.
His wife (Chelsea Field), 2 daughters (Tina Majorino and Aidan
Pendleton) and a son (Shane Meier) form the rest of this Brady Bunch
type family.</P>
<P>     The show gets its only interest from a seal (the famous Andre)
that the family adopts as a pup to nurse it back to health when he
loses his Mom to a fishing net.  The only reason that Andre became
famous is that he in turn adopted the family and would not leave.  His
fame went so far as to include an appearance on, what else, the Ed
Sullivan Show.</P>
<P>     The acting is all straight forward as is the script (by Dana
Baratta  based on the book "A Seal Called Andre" by Lew Dietz and Harry
Goodridge) and the directing (George Miller).  This is your
traditional, lets play it conservative and do nothing that could upset
or offend anyone sort of show for little tykes.  The movie takes no
chances.  Other than the obligatory, lets make them think someone is
going to die scenes, it is a sugary sweet show.  I found it frequently
boring, but never offensive.</P>
<P>     On a more positive note, the narration by Annette O'Toole is
lovely - very melodic.  Then again, O'Toole is such a beautiful
actress, I really missed seeing her in the flesh.</P>
<P>     For it being a true story, for the wonderful seal (he IS really
cute), and for the absolutely wonderful ending scene (I came close to
crying in a show that almost put me to sleep), I rate ANDRE **.  I give
it a mild thumbs down, and recommend it only to people under 13.  My
5-year-old boy liked ANDRE, and he gives it a thumbs up, I should point
out.  The movie runs 1:35.  The MPAA rates it PG for reasons that
totally escape me.  THE LION KING was more PG than this show which is
clearly a G.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
