<PRE>                            BREAKING THE WAVES
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>The ads say "On over 75 Ten Best lists," to which I say that I would
hate to believe that is true..  This endlessly boring film took almost
165 minutes before, thankfully, it came to an end. What is it with
editors who will not cut long dull scenes, who will not delete
unnecessary action?   What is it with critics who go wild over
pretentious films?</P>
<P>Breaking the Waves is about miracles and having chats with God; Bess
(Emily Watson) talks to God and from what she is saying and at what she
is smiling, He apparently is on the same channel.  However, the advice
He seems to be handing her is really not very good, ungodly, and gets
her into an awful lot of trouble.</P>
<P>Bess, who has a sweet expressive face, lives in a small town in
Scotland.  She marries. Hwr husband (Stellen Skarsgard) works on a ship
at sea doing something with pipes and oil (?).  When an accident occurs
and Bess's husband is paralyzed, bedridden and with a prognosis of his
never being able to walk again nor really improving, Bess takes it very
hard.</P>
<P>Wife Bess is one loyal woman, always at his bedside. When her husband
says he would like her to have sex with "someone" and then come back
and tell him about it, it would be as if he and she had had sex.
Sure.  First Bess says she cannot do that but then she hits on the
doctor.  He very ethical will not touch her.  While she lies in the
nude on a mattress, inviting him, he tells her to get dressed.   But
there are many others in the city, on ships, in bars, on a bus, who
accept her offers.</P>
<P>Bess is doing this for her husband who, it is quite obvious to even
this layman, is on his deathbed.  As Bess tells everyone, she is not
making love, she is only offering a sacrifice for her husband, hoping
God will work a miracle.</P>
<P>Also stars Katrin Cartlidge, Jean-Marc Barr and Udo Kier. 
Directed by Lars Von Trier.</P>
