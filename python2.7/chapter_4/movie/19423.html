<P>The controversial "Crash" is the darkest and most twisted film to come out of
David Cronenberg in years. The film stars James Spader as a commercial
producer, James Ballard, who is married to a attractive, sexy woman, Catherine
(Deborah Kara Unger). They indulge in their own sex fantasies: James has sex
with his female assistants, and she carresses the cold surfaces of jet
airplanes with her nipples. Then James gets into a fatal car accident and kills
a passenger. The driver, Helen Remington (Holly Hunter), survives and becomes
attracted to James. They start having sex in almost any wrecked car they find.
Helen introduces James to Vaughan (Elias Koteas), the high priest of auto
wrecks who recreates famous car crashes such as James Dean's and Jayne
Mansfield's. Then they meet Gabrielle (Rosanna Arquette), a cripple who has a
huge gash on her leg resembling a vagina. James and Catherine get sucked into
this weird cult where a car crash or a video of a car crash equals sexual
pleasure.</P>
<P>"Crash" is not an easy film to watch nor should it be. It shouldn't be
dismissed as pornographic either since there are no gratuitous sex scenes - it
isn't erotic or thrilling, just plain twisted. My interpretation of it is that
these people need to feel pleasure in their sexual encounters and they do it by
getting into car wrecks - it feeds their drive and lust. There are really no
performances in this movie, the actors just simply react to each other with
looks and glances and sexual gestures (Hunter seems out of her element in her
less than hypnotic stares). You will not identify with any of these people or
remotely like them. So why see this movie? Because it is challenging,
stimulating and provocative. The tears in Catherine's eyes at the end of the
film indicate that this sex game may have gone too far. Like Cronenberg's
"Videodrome" and his recent "eXistenZ," it will make you feel icky, unsatisfied
and uneasy for days on end. </P>
