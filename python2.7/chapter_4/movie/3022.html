<P>Pulp (pulp) n.  1.  A soft, moist, shapeless mass of matter.  2.  A book 
containing lurid subject matter, and being characteristically printed on 
rough, unfinished paper. </P>
<P>     "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the
inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is he
who in the name of charity and goodwill shepherds the weak through the
valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and a finder
of lost children.  And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my
brothers.  And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my
vengeance upon thee."
          - Jules' version of Ezekiel 25:17</P>
<P>     The danger of having as successful and explosive a debut as
RESERVOIR DOGS is that expectations are invariably high--sometimes
unrealistically so--for the follow up.  Quentin Tarantino, however,
has managed the near-impossible:  improve upon the extraordinary.  PULP
FICTION shows what can happen when a talented and accomplished
filmmaker reaches his apex.</P>
<P>     This film is one wild ride.  An anthology of three interconnected
stories that take place in a modern-day Los Angeles tinted by echoes of
Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, the movie impresses in every
possible way.  Writer/director Tarantino has merged film noir with the
gangster tale and pulled them both into the '90s.  As definitive as
Francis Ford Coppola's GODFATHER saga was for the '70s, so is PULP
FICTION for today's generation.</P>
<P>     Some have wondered whether Tarantino can create women of strength
and independence equal to his men.  PULP FICTION supplies the answer
with a resounding affirmation.  Both sexes are rendered with similar
depth and insight.</P>
<P>     PULP FICTION's three tales are structured to intersect and overlap
at key points, even though they are not presented in chronological
order.  Tarantino arranges his initial scene to dovetail with his final
one in a remarkable example of closure.  Those confused by the
structure will see everything clearly once the final line is spoken.</P>
<P>     "Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife" is the first story.
It opens with Vincent (John Travolta) and Jules (Samuel L.  Jackson)
out on a hit for their boss, Marsellus (Ving Rhames).  Along the way,
Vincent confesses that he's uneasy about an upcoming job--taking out
Marsellus' young wife Mia (Uma Thurman) while the main man is out of
town.  The source of the nervousness lies in a story circulating that
Marsellus had a man thrown out a fourth story window for giving Mia a
foot massage.  One wrong step and Vincent could find himself in deep
trouble.</P>
<P>     "The Gold Watch" is about a boxer, Butch (Bruce Willis), who is
handsomely paid by Marsellus to throw a fight.  Only at the last moment
does it become more profitable to renege on the deal.  So, along with
his French girlfriend, Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros), Butch goes on the
run, hoping to live long enough to spend some of the fortune he has
suddenly gained.</P>
<P>     "The Bonnie Situation" ties together a few loose threads.  It also
introduces Harvey Keitel as a suave problem-solver named Wolf and
Quentin Tarantino as Jim, a man worried that his wife will come home
from work to find a dead body in a blood-spattered car in his garage.
Sometimes, it appears, helping out Marsellus is not without its
complications.</P>
<P>     As was the case in RESERVOIR DOGS, Tarantino's crisp dialogue
sparkles.  The vulgarity-laced monologues and conversations ripple with
humor and are ripe with points to ponder.  Foot massages, hamburgers,
comfortable silence, a gold watch, pot bellies, divine intervention,
and filthy animals--all these and more receive the writer's attention
as he presents meaningless issues in an intensely-fascinating and
almost lyrical fashion.  Who else (except perhaps David Mamet) can make
profanity sound so poetic?</P>
<P>     For anyone who thought they knew the breadth of Bruce Willis' and
John Travolta's acting ability, a surprise awaits.  Whether it's an
effect of the script, the direction, or something else, these two turn
in surprisingly strong performances.  And they're not the only ones.
Uma Thurman, Rosanna Arquette, Ving Rhames, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth,
Amanda Plummer, Eric Stoltz (who has a Tarantino-related triple play
with PULP FICTION, KILLING ZOE, and SLEEP WITH ME), and the director
himself are all excellent.  And then there's Samuel L. Jackson, who
seems to get better with every outing.  His is the standout in a sea of
standouts.</P>
<P>     All the details are executed to perfection.  Ironies abound in the
smallest situations.  One death is caused by, of all things, a
poptart.  And it takes a director of rare talent to find the humor in
an ugly, bloody situation.  Mixing the original with the derivative,
Tarantino pushes PULP FICTION in directions that are both anticipated
and unexpected.</P>
<P>     Relentless in its pace, PULP FICTION is as exhausting as it is
exhilarating.  Yet there is considerably more to this film than a SPEED
with good actors.  In between all the shootings, Mexican standoffs, and
other violent confrontations exist opportunities to explore various
facets of the human experience, including spirituality (witness Jules'
fondness for a pseudo-Ezekiel passage).  With this film, every layer
that you peel away leads to something deeper and richer.  It's a rare
film that can say that, and a rarer one that can do it in the manner
that this one has.</P>
