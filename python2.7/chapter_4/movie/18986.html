<P>I don't appreciate it when a thriller manipulates the viewer into
thinking the plot is interesting, when in fact it's ludicrous. In the
case of The General's Daughter, the plot is more than capable of
intriguing you to a certain point. But at this juncture in the story,
the movie begins to fall apart like a crumbling cookie. This predictable
summer thriller is only sporadically involving, and that is
unfortunately not enough to compensate for all of it's detailed flaws.</P>
<P>Get past one moment early on where John Travolta exercises his southern
accent, and you're likely to survive this entire movie. Travolta plays
Criminal Investigations Divisions officer Paul Brenner, who's working
undercover at a military base when another situation arises: the
apparent rape and murder of a young female officer (Leslie Stefanson).
It turns out that the victim is the daughter of General Joe Campbell
(James Cromwell). Let the investigation begin.</P>
<P>With the assistance of fellow CID investigator Sarah Sunhill (played
rather on-the-sidelines by Madeleine Stowe), Brenner uncovers what
appears to be an intricate and bizarre homicide case. Things begin to
get marginally engrossing when we meet Colonel Moore (James Woods), a
former commanding officer of the deceased who has a few secrets up his
sleeve. Woods submits another scene-stealing performance here as he
oozes authority, surrounded by clouds of smoke emitted from his cigar.
With echoes of his supporting role in True Crime, in which he duked it
out with Clint Eastwood in enjoyably profane verbal exchanges, he makes
every moment believable. Here though, the intense dialogue comes care of
confrontations with Travolta, as the two send mindful, knowing glares
across the room. There are many scenes such as this in The General's
Daughter, in which the veteran cast performs splendidly under pressure,
but the circumstances that tie these meetings together are difficult to
absorb.</P>
<P>Director Simon West (Con Air), shows a watchful eye of delivering a
stylish looking thriller, but he fails miserably when it comes to the
intellectual part of it. The General's Daughter is, more often than not,
a predictable and unexciting mess. It does not help matters that the
plot is virtually actionless, dragging it's heels all the way at a
mind-numbing snails pace. A few brief action scenes, marvelously handled
in the editing department, show that the movie could have delivered such
a more proficient package. From a director who does such a great job of
staging explosions and miraculous stunts, I suggest West should stick
with mindless, rip-roaring action features and attempt to avoid future
projects like this.</P>
<P>Still, the movie is certainly not without it's merits. The acting is
very good from the majority of the experienced cast. The performances
range from commanding (Travolta) to electric (Woods) to stiff-as-a-board
(Cromwell, who doesn't show off his real talents here). Madeleine Stowe
manages to hold her own for a while, but as the female lead in an
action-thriller, she doesn't pull through sufficiently.</P>
<P>One of the problems with the execution is that it's very predictable.
>From minute one, I had few doubts about the identity of the killer in
question. The script even unwillingly points him out for us, using
familiar techniques to hide his guilt until the unmasking toward the
end. In all fairness, we've seen many of the devices used in The
General's Daughter put to greater effect in other films.</P>
<P>The secrets behind the girl's mysterious death are explained gradually,
but by the resolution we have tunneled through so much malarkey that it
feels unnecessary and surprisingly silly. The General's Daughter is not
a terrible movie, and it is involving enough to sustain a viewer's
attention span for a certain period of time. But it just could have been
so much better.</P>
