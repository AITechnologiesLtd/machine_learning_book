<PRE>The "Kids" Are Alright</PRE>
<P>To tell you the truth, "Spy Kids" was not what I had
originally intended to review.  I actually bought a
ticket to see a more sophisticated spy thriller called
"The Tailor of Panama."  There were still about 15
minutes before that film was to begin, so I decided to
sneak into an adjacent theatre to kill some time.  I
didn't expect to stay too long because the idea of
watching a pre-teen brother and sister team lurch
their way through a mission to save the world seemed
like an agonizing idea.  Surprisingly, the first 15
minutes established a fair amount of pace and showed
the promise of entertainment and imagination.  And
before I knew it, I had actually stayed and watched
the whole movie.  Thinking back, I'm glad that I did.</P>
<P>It certainly wasn't the acting that fueled this story.
 Since the target audience consists primarily of
pre-teens, this film feels more like a revved up
bedtime story with cartoonish characters rather than a
polished thriller.  After all, the heroes are a
12-year-old girl named Carmen (Alexa Vega) and her
younger brother Juni (Daryl Sabara).  Both possess a
spunky likableness without the saccharine demeanor of
that kid from the "Home Alone" films.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the villain, Fegan Floop (Alan Cummings),
is a popular children's television show host.  He
resides in a magnificent palace whose interior seems
to be lifted from the blueprints of Willie Wonka's
Chocolate Factory.  There, he carries out his
diabolical plan and controls his army of clumsy
minions who are literally all thumbs.  But no matter
what you think of pre-teen spies and fanciful
villains, you'll find this overall movie watching
experience enjoyable.</P>
<P>Gregorio (Antonio Banderas) and Ingrid (Carla Gugino)
Cortez are former super-secret agents.  Now wed, they
have retired to raise their children, Carmen and Juni.
 They have never told their children about their past,
hoping to put that life behind them.  But they are
called back into action when fellow operatives start
disappearing and Fegan Floop and his minions
are…uh…fingered.  But years of inactivity result in
their quick capture.  With their parents now
prisoners, it's up to Carmen and Juni to save them and
the world. </P>
<P>For much of the movie, its pretty straightforward as
the kids use is a bevy of wildly inventive gizmos to
make their way towards Floop's stronghold while
dodging his various henchman.  Yet the film is
unexpectedly flashy in its use of quick edits, giving
this James Bond-for-kids film grown-up hipness.  There
are many amusing moments as well, such as the
inevitable bickering between the siblings and the
general state of ineptness of Floop's minions.  It
also exhibited a continued spirit of imagination,
featuring special effects that made this film seem
more expensive than its reported price tag of $35
million.</P>
<P>"Spy Kids" is a fine family film.  It not only
provides 90 minutes of entertainment, but it also
effectively forwards the notion of family, teamwork,
brotherhood, and the importance of children.  Like
Gregorio and Ingrid who worked hard to successfully
balance their family life with their lives as agents,
the film also works hard to find the right balance
between an easy-to-digest film for kids and an
entertaining film for adults.  This mission is
adequately accomplished.  "Spy Kids" nicely combines
fantasy and fluff with several laughs and several
valuable lessons.</P>
