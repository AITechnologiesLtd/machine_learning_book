<PRE>                               COMMANDMENTS
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     So how many of the Ten Commandments have you violated today?
Harry Lucia (Anthony LaPaglia) brags that, "I break 5 or 6 commandments
every day before lunch."  But have you ever felt the need to break them
all?</P>
<P>     Who among us hasn't blamed God for some misfortune that has
befallen us.  In the movie COMMANDMENTS, Harry's brother-in-law Seth
Warner (Aidan Quinn) has had so much trouble lately with The Almighty
that Seth seems ready to file suit against Heaven, Inc.  Instead, he
devises a different punishment for God, the systematic breaking of
every one of his commandments.</P>
<P>     "I am not crazy," Seth tells us.  "I know the difference between
bad luck and divine inspiration."  Some of us have had bad days, but
Seth's problems are much more cataclysmic.</P>
<P>     One idyllic day, Seth and his wife Karen (Joanna Going) go to the
beach.  While Seth peacefully falls asleep on the sand, his wife goes
out for a swim.  When he awakens, his wife has vanished.</P>
<P>     After a search turns up nothing, Seth becomes a hermit in his home
while waiting for some sign from God as to whether Karen is alive.
Many weeks later, he gets a message of sorts when a tornado strikes his
brownstone but leaves all of the other homes in the neighborhood
unharmed.  When he returns to work, his boss fires him.  After being
struck by lightning, he gives up and turns on God.  He prepares a list
of all the commandments so he can check them off as he commits each
sin.</P>
<P>     Harry, whose frequent narration forms the story's glue, is an
investigative reporter.  When he tells his editor, Gordon Bloom (Jack
Gilpin), about Seth's plan, Bloom thinks it can get front page
coverage.  Afterall, the story has it all -- "death, sex, and God."</P>
<P>     Writer and director Daniel Taplitz's intelligent script starts as
a broadly written black comedy, but by the end he has subtly
transformed the story into a poignant drama.  His rich characters are
worth the audience's attention, and the compelling acting by the three
leads, Courteney Cox plays Harry's wife Rachel, draw us into the story.
Most plots are rehashes of some other story, but the COMMANDMENTS is
fresh and surprising throughout.</P>
<P>     Seth finds that some commandments are easy to break (idolatry),
some are hard (murder), and some are fun (adultery).  The way the
script sets up the circumstances, each becomes an interesting vignette.
Some, such as bearing false witness, are handled quite imaginatively.</P>
<P>     There is no mystery about whom Seth will commit adultery with.
The genuine chemistry that builds between Seth and Rachel becomes the
best subplot in the film.  ("Am I a commandment to be broken?" she
inquires when he starts coming on to her.  "Yes," he says.  But she
wants to know, "Is that all?"  He simply replies "No," and with that
settled, their love making can begin.)  Very erotic, but with almost no
nudity, their romance comes alive with just a few scenes.</P>
<P>     The show builds to its chief conundrum -- how will the hardest
commandment, murder, be broken.  I will give no hints.</P>
<P>     Harry, being the most likely murder target, is interviewed by his
editor.  "For the record," Gordon says, while pushing a microtape
recorder in Harry's face.  "If you were murdered, how would that make
you feel?"</P>
<P>     A strangely satisfying show, that has to be experienced to be
appreciated.  My wife and I view this as a little gem of a picture.</P>
<P>     COMMANDMENTS runs a very fast 1:26.  The film is rated R for
non-explicit sex, brief nudity, and a little violence.  COMMANDMENTS
would be fine for teenagers.  I recommend this funny and ultimately
touching story to you and give it ***.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
