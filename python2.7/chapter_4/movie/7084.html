<PRE>                               IF LUCY FELL
                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1997 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>If Lucy Fell (1996) 1/2 out of ***** - Cast: Sarah Jessica Parker, Eric
Schaeffer, Ben Stiller, Elle Macpherson, James Rebhorn.  Written and
Directed by: Eric Schaeffer.  Running Time: 94 minutes.</P>
<P>I want to know who in their right mind though that this film would appeal to
anyone on the planet.  Two whiny, pathetic losers (Parker and Schaeffer) make
a death pact to jump off a bridge if neither of them find true love by age
30.  JUMP!  PLEASE!</P>
<P>Star-writer-director Schaeffer should not have been allowed to even come
close to a movie set, let alone be allowed to make this totally predictable,
unfunny, waste of an hour and a half of anyone's life.  The characters in
this film are so ridiculously fake and pathetic that you, along with me,
will be praying that they die in the end.  JUMP!  Schaeffer's character is
such a complete dork, and Elle Macpherson actually finds him attractive,
especially after he keeps making himself look like a complete dork.  His
first words to her are "I have herpes."  Ah, I can hear her heart melting.  I
can't even write the "romantic" things that he says to her as they are about
to make love (just the fact that he's about to make love to her is utterly
ridiculous), all I can say is that even if Brad Pitt was saying those things
to a woman he'd have his privates kicked up into his stomach.  Only Stiller
manages to get a laugh or two.  He's just as much of a freak and a loser as
the rest of the characters, but at least he's a slightly amusing freak.</P>
<P>Well you see Parker and Schaeffer are roommates.  Get it?  Boy-girl?
Roommates?  Gee, I wonder if they realize with 5 minutes left in the film
that they actually love EACH OTHER and end up together in the end?  I really,
really wonder.  I desperately wanted them to jump.  Needless to say, it was
not a happy ending to me.</P>
