<PRE>AFFLICATION (1997)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Copyright 1998 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>Affliction takes a man with a messed up life and tears it to shreds. </P>
<P>>From the opening of Affliction you know that this is not a Hollywood-type
film. The mellow opening with its seemingly still pictures of a quiet town
is a masterful way of settling the audience into the groove of the film.
And it also serves to start the film off on a happy note – a note that
doesn't last long in Affliction. As the film goes on, we hear an eerie
narration done by Willem Dafoe. </P>
<P>Rolfe Whitehouse (Willem Dafoe) narrates and speaks about his brother, Wade
(Nick Nolte), who is the policeman in a small town. Rolfe lives in Boston
and is not the main character of Affliction. Wade is the focus of the film.
Wade is a loser, plain and simple. He's a man who's taken all the wrong
turns in life – many times taking the wrong turns twice. Wade and Rolfe
grew up as abused kids -- taking both verbal and physical abuse from their
father (James Coburn). Wade was more affected than Rolfe.</P>
<P>Wade's troubles include a job he hates, a daughter from his divorce that
hates him, and a dad who lives too close and is still quite abusive. Wade
does have better parts in his life, like his girlfriend Margie (Sissy
Spacek). As the film moves on, the troubles start to compound on Wade. The
flashpoint of the trouble start when Wade's friend Jack takes a rich man
out deer hunting. Something goes wrong and the rich man is killed. Jack
says it was an accident, Wade thinks different.</P>
<P>Though the death is the flashpoint, it is not the focus of the film. The
film concentrates on the characters. Wade being the biggest of them and
later on in the film Wade's dad is added. These two characters are so well
written that the film would have been engrossing even with out the hunting
accident. What we see is that abuse comes in vicious cycles – as we can see
how the cycle goes from Wade's father to Wade.</P>
<P>I'm not accustomed to seeing Nolte in dramatic roles, so it took me a
little to get used to him as Wade. But, once I accepted him as Wade,
Nolte's performance was brilliant. Nolte was able to make me sympathetic to
him throughout the film – which at points was hard since as the film
progresses, his character becomes more and more withdrawn from reality. The
character of Wade is what characters in Hollywood should be like. Fleshed
out and well-written, Wade shows that a movie doesn't have to rely solely
on special effects to be engaging.</P>
<P>Coburn as Wade's father is one of the scariest, most unpredictable
characters in the film – and in recent memory. Coburn turns in a
wonderfully textured performance as Wade's father.</P>
<P>The one small thing that felt out of place in Affliction was a short car
chase in the middle of the film. Is it some sort of requirement to have a
chase in every movie? But, this is a small shortcoming when looking at the
film as a whole.</P>
<P>The script by Paul Schrader is wonderful in its characterizations.
Schrader, working off of Russell Banks' novel, gives us characters that we
can follow and feel for. Schrader has put together a film that studies the
lives of many people and shows us what consequences come from their
actions. He humanizes Wade, a man who is spiraling down to an unknown point.</P>
<P>Affliction is not a happy film. It is depressing and gloomy by the end.
But, at the end we come to understand what it is like to be a man who has
made all the wrong turns in life and ends up at a point where there's no
turning back. Director/writer Paul Schrader has put together a character
study that will haunt the audience. Kudos to Schrader for not putting
together a Hollywood-type happy film and going his own way while making
Affliction. I read in an article where James Coburn says that Affliction
will not be a film that will have people lining up to see it. I agree that
this film with its limited distribution will not have people lining up to
see it. But, Affliction is a Don't Miss film. If you miss Affliction in the
theatres, Don't Miss it on video.</P>
<P>[Rated R for Violence and Language. Running Time: 113 Minutes]</P>
