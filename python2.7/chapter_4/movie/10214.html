<PRE>Review of:
DRACULA: DEAD & LOVING IT (1995)
Starring: Leslie Neilsen, Amy Yasbeck, and Peter MacNicol
Directed By: Mel Brooks</PRE>
<P>Mel Brooks has done a lot of films- this one being the most recent.  Sometimes 
they are great and sometimes they flop big time.  The main problem with 
DRACULA: DEAD & LOVING IT is that it relies on the fact that the viwer has 
knowledge of DRACULA from the film with Bela Lugosi, the 1990 remake with Gary 
Oldman, the novel itself, as well as a decent vampire lore knowledge to get a 
majority of the jokes.  I fit into this category, but those who don't would 
think the film is lame.</P>
<P>The plot follows the Bela Lugosi version exactly which was actually based on a 
play and is not that similar to the original book by Bram Stoker.  It begins 
with Renfield going to Count Dracula's castle to have him sign a deal to get 
land in London.  Peter MacNicol (the mad painter in GHOSTBUSTERS 2 and the 
American guy in BEAN) does a great job as Renfield.  At the start he is 
mediocre, but when he becomes insane the best performance of the movie comes 
out.  Renfield is perfect while having the little quirks that make a memorable 
character.</P>
<P>As for the other characters...  Mel Brooks does a good job as Van Helsing.  
Leslie Neilsen was a little miscast for the title role of Dracula since 
everyone is used to seeing him in the NAKED GUN movies.  He does an OK job, 
but is he a convincing vampire?  No, but he isn't trying to be either.  Amy 
Yasbeck, last seen in Mel Brooks' film ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS as Maid 
Marion, is fine for the role of Mina.  So the cast works fine with eachother 
and the script has some good lines.</P>
<P>Some of the lines, like I said before, require knowledge of prior Dracula 
films.  This line for example:</P>
<P>(A bat flies down and poops on the stairs)
Dracula: Creatures of the night...  What a mess they make...</P>
<P>See what I mean? It doesn't really work as a visual gag, yet the line itself 
is a pun on the line "Creatures of the night...  What music they make" done by 
Bela Lugosi in the original Dracula film.  The humor hits and misses.  The 
best scene involves when Van Helsing and Harker (played by some guy on the 
show WINGS) go to execute Lucy in her Nosferatu form.  I saw this film first 
in a theatre and rather liked it, yet the audience laughs were far and few 
between.  Renfield is great, as is the decent instrumental music score, but 
the film doesn't work because of the way the humor is done...  Mel Brooks 
hasn't made a horrid film, he just has done much better.</P>
<PRE>Pros:</PRE>
<PRE>+ Good acting by Peter McNicol as Renfield
+ Lots of cameos
+ Good music
+ Mel Brooks style humor</PRE>
<PRE>Cons:</PRE>
<PRE>- Humor is hit and miss
- Humor requires knowledge of previous Dracula films
- Pacing could use some work</PRE>
<P>Overall, I give Dracula: Dead and Loving it **1/2 out of ****.  If you are a 
fan of vampire films or a fan of Mel Brooks film, go and rent it.  Others 
should rent some of the funnier Brooks films like SPACEBALLS, BLAZING SADDLES, 
YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, THE PRODUCERS, and ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS.
This film IS better than MEL BROOKS' HISTORY OF THE WORLD: PART I.</P>
