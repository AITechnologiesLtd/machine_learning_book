<PRE>MONTEREY POP
A documentary review by Rachel Gordon
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>For those of us who weren't yet born when the 1960's rock 'n' rolled
around, Monterey Pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music that
influenced our parents to be hippies.  From Otis Redding to Jimi
Hendrix, Janis Joplin to the Mamas and the Papas, and Jefferson Airplane
to The Who, this documentary is jam-packed with contagious energy.  But
I give fair warning that I will reveal the ending, which does not do the
rest of the film the justice it deserves.</P>
<P>Shot in 1969 at an outdoor concert that precluded Woodstock, the film
defies the stereotype of the general population at the time.  Sure, some
have painted their faces and smoke joints, but D.A. Pennebaker (The War
Room, Moon Over Broadway) surprisingly chooses to show a broad spectrum
of the audience.  No matter who is watching, it all comes back to the
talented musicians that stir your soul.</P>
<P>The excitement starts before the music even begins.  A young girl is
cleaning thousands of seats and when asked why by an interviewer, she
replies that she feels lucky to do so.  There are moments of organized
craziness as John Phillips, leader of the Mamas and the Papas and one of
the concert organizers, tries to get in touch with Dionne Warwick.  And
when one band is tuning up, a member remarks, "Finally, a decent sound
system!"</P>
<P>You can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show
isn't about vanity, it's about playing the music you love to those who
have an appreciation for it, a two-way street.  This interaction between
audience and performer continues throughout the film and becomes
infectious to the audience.</P>
<P>It's impossible to tear your eyes away from Janis Joplin as she belts
out her ballad about love being a ball and chain.  And while the lyrics
to "Wild Thing" may not be all that complicated, watching Jimi Hendrix
mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as Otis Redding
singing about love.  Even if you don't recognize every band you see on
stage, you can imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public
sitting in those seats.</P>
<P>The only drawback to the film is the ending, which unfortunately I must
reveal.  All the other bands, big names then and still today, got
approximately 7 to 10 minutes of screen time.  In contrast, the last
band on camera, a wholly forgettable one, gets an entire 18 minutes of
screen time.  For a film that's only 78 minutes long, that's too large
of a chunk, especially when previous acts are much more stimulating.</P>
<P>All in all, Monterey Pop is a precious, rare look at a time period that
still holds sway over us.  The variety of music, as well as the
beautifully shot performances, are easy to become immersed in.  If there
was ever any question as to why most of these bands were so popular,
this is quickly dispelled.  It's almost depressing to think that music
this moving doesn't get made much anymore.  Instead we're stuck with
*Nsync, the Backstreet Boys, and Jennifer Lopez, all of whom should have
stuck with modeling.</P>
