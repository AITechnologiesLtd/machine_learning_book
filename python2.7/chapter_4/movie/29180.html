<PRE>THE OTHERS
----------</PRE>
<P>Grace (Nicole Kidman) lives alone in a rambling mansion on the Isle of Jersey 
with her two light-allergic children Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James
Bentley) after her servants mysteriously disappeared one night.  The year is 
1945 and her soldier husband Charles (Christopher Eccleston, "Elizabeth") 
hasn't been heard from in over a year.  After three servants arrive looking
for work, strange things begin to happen in writer/director Alejandro
Amenabar's "The Others."</P>
<P>Grace is very religious and becomes angered when her daughter Anne upsets
Nicholas with tales of a young boy whom she says comes into their
room at night.  Grace doesn't believe in the supernatural and brands Anne
a liar, making her read the bible aloud in the hallway until the girl admits
her sin.  The new housekeeper Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan, "Waking
Ned Devine"), is more receptive to Anne's stories, though, and questions
the harshness of Grace's punishment, especially when Anne hasn't relented after
three days.  After all, Anne has hinted to Mrs. Mills that her mother
may have once gone mad.</P>
<P>Grace accuses Mrs. Mills and the mute Lydia (Elaine Cassidy, "Felicia's 
Journey") of leaving doors open (they must be locked so as not to allow 
potentially life-threatening light to enter the room) and says Lydia makes a 
racket upstairs.  But when Grace hears thuds that set the chandelier to 
swinging while she can see the two women outside, she's forced to investigate. </P>
<P>Anne tells her that 'the others' are in an attic room, and Grace discovers 
shrouded furniture, whispering voices and even a 'book of the dead' that panic 
her.</P>
<P>Things take stranger turns and it's unclear what agenda the three servants,
who showed up unbidden claiming to know the house, have, if any.  Grace asks
the gardener, Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes, "Those Magnificent Men in Their
Flying Machines") to search for a graveyard on the grounds and sets 
out to fetch the parish priest.  But she becomes enveloped in blanketing 
fog and instead finds her shell shocked husband dazedly coming up the road.</P>
<P>Alejandro Amenabar ("Open Your Eyes") has taken a page from "The Innocents"
and created a spooky, psychological, gothic ghost story of a time gone by.
The children's odd ailment gives him the opportunity to create an eerie
mood with dark, shadowy rooms and corridors lit only by the candles and 
lanterns carried by his characters.  Religious symbols, from a covered
status of Jesus to Anne's communion dress, become sinister.  Creaking doors, 
whooshing drapes and unexpected footfalls make one shiver.  Amenabar's score 
is also effectively old-fashioned.</P>
<P>Kidman walks a line between being overly strict and warmly maternal.
Mounting fear shines from her ever-widening eyes.  The performance tends 
toward brittleness, however.  Young newcomers Alakina Mann and James
Bentley are both superb, childlike and innocent on the one hand, almost
eerily pale and borderline creepy on the other.  Anne is willful and
rebellious while Nicholas is terrified and trusting.  Fionnula Flanagan
keeps us off balance with her caring housekeeper who just might know more
about the strange goings on that she's letting on.</P>
<P>While anyone who's seen a lot of movies should have no trouble at least
partially figuring out the 'surprise' twist ending, "The Others" is still an 
enjoyable, well made thriller for those who like things that go bump in
the night.</P>
