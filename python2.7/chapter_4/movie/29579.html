<P>To crudely semi-plagiarize from Entertainment Weekly, who in their right
mind would expect anything but good things from William Goldman's
adaptation of a Stephen King novel directed by Scott Hicks (Shine) and
starring Anthony Hopkins?  Of course, Hollywood has been able to muck up a
seemingly unmuckable roster in the past (Sphere comes immediately to mind)
but please let me tell you now, this is no Sphere.  This is a treasure.</P>
<P>People potentially put off by "adaption of a Stephen King novel" obviously
haven't been reading him lately.  Let me give you some perspective:  did
you like Shawshank Redemption, Stand By Me, The Green Mile, maybe even Apt
Pupil?  This is the King on display here, softened even more by the deft
hand of William Goldman.  Goldman speaks Kingese as well as Frank Darabont
does, and my frequent readers will recognize that as high praise indeed.
He shows without telling in an effortless, non-lingual way, and it's
delightful.  The late Piotr Sobocinski is the cinematographer, and this is
indeed a glorious swansong; everything is beautiful, everyone is carefully
placed in the frame, every visual detail is crisp and perfect, like the
best parts of a favorite memory.</P>
<P>Before the show began, I told my companion that I knew I had read this
book, it was on my shelf, I could picture the cover, but I had zip of an
idea what it was about.  The maddeningly vague ad campaign was no help
either.  As soon as Hopkins' hands curled around his paper shopping bags, I
remembered the whole thing, and I was just so glad to be there.  I
understand why the ads and even the publicity copy is so vague - how do you
describe it?  If you haven't read the book, you would only be attracted by
the pedigree.  When my boyfriend asked what the movie was about when I came
home, streaked in tears, I would only have been able to explain it by
ruining it.  So I said, it's just great.  As I am telling you now:  go
forth, and reward the studio for making this movie.</P>
<P>Many of King's best works (It, Stand By Me, for example) depend on his
brilliant, gleaming adoration of childhood friendships, notably around age
11-14, when the mind is the most open and innocence and curiosity and
everything are just budding but have not ruined the mind.  This film is no
exception.  It's wonderful.  I cried, more than once, as did my very
cynical (as a rule) male companion.  This is one of those films where,
actually, very few happy things happen, yet the feeling walking home is one
of uplifted wonder and melancholy joy.</P>
<P>Anthony Hopkins' eyes can see forever.  There are many unanswered questions
with regards to his Ted Brautigan, but we believe him and believe in him
because of his eyes.  Mychael Danna's music (he also did The Sweet
Hereafter and the Ice Storm) is hauntingly delicate, like the film itself.
Our copy actually broke 80 minutes into the film - we weren't budging,
despite missing 10 minutes and being told we'd have to wait 30 minutes.
The whole room was transfixed - what would happen next?  Lovely.  Anton
Yelchin is young Booby Garfield (David Morse is him grown up - take close
look at all his props, they say so much about his character) and he is
lovely, very open and natural and sweet and real.  Mika Boorem (I
recognized her, belatedly, as the child Ally McBeal, but she has a good
resume) is also dreamlike in her perfection as the best gal pal.</P>
<PRE>Full Price for sure.</PRE>
