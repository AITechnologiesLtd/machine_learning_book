<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>Charles Dickens did it first, of course, and also did it best. His 1843 "A 
Christmas Carol" was, to my knowledge, the earliest major work in which a 
character finds redemption and turns his life around after witnessing 
other lives and times -- some real, some merely possibilities. Next came 
Frank Capra's classic 1946 film "It's A Wonderful Life", which spun the 
concept only slightly by having as its protagonist a truly good man, who 
is shown what the world would be like if he never existed.</P>
<P>"The Family Man" is another slight variation on the themes embraced by 
Dickens and Capra. The main character this time around is Jack Campbell 
(Nicolas Cage), who is a bit of a cross between Ebenezer Scrooge and 
George Bailey. Jack is "a credit to capitalism" according to his boss -- a 
pragmatic businessman who handles multi-billion-dollar mergers and his 
latest romantic conquest with comparable skill. Things could have been 
different. In 1987, Jack left his college sweetheart, Kate (Tea Leoni), 
for an internship in London. Despite his promises, he never returned.</P>
<P>But Jack is not a bad man. On Christmas Eve, he intervenes in a 
convenience store hold-up, talking the culprit (Don Cheadle) out of the 
store. During their conversation, Jack professes that he is missing 
nothing from his life, which gets a rise out of the would-be robber. The 
next morning, Jack wakes up to discover his life has changed. Somehow, he 
has been married to Kate for the past thirteen years, has two kids and a 
dog, and sells tires for a living. Again encountering the man from the
convenience store, Jack learns that he is being given a glimpse of the 
life he could have led, for reasons he is supposed to figure out for 
himself.</P>
<P>"The Family Man" hews predictably close to the structure laid out by 
Dickens. Jack is initially hostile toward his fate, refusing to accept a 
life of changing diapers, mixing chocolate milk, and hawking the BF 
Goodrich line. Gradually, he warms up to this life, learning that, even 
though his life with Kate is missing many of the perks of his "real" life, 
it is nonetheless richer in more important ways. Where "The Family Man" 
differs from its predecessors is that it is far less obvious how this new
understanding will affect Jack once he returns to his normal existence.</P>
<P>In some ways, this is "The Family Man"'s chief flaw. Unlike Scrooge or 
Bailey, both of whom were heading down indisputably dark paths, it's not 
all that obvious that Jack Campbell needs saving. There is something 
rankling about the film's implicit assertion that, because his life is not 
middle-America-perfect, Jack has made poor decisions. Sure, his existence 
might not be ideal, but it's not so terrible either. It leaves one to 
wonder why Cheadle is wasting his time with somebody like Jack when there 
are other people in the world in far more desperate need of divine 
intervention.</P>
<P>But despite its clunky execution, "The Family Man" resonates with 
undeniable warmth. Despite the thematic problems it creates, the movie's 
refusal to paint Jack as a Scrooge-type villain creates a refreshingly 
original feeling. This is not simply "A Christmas Carol" (or, for that 
matter, "It's A Wonderful Life") all over again, but an altogether 
different take on the concept. Jack is neither a blackguard nor a hero, 
but a regular guy caught in a seemingly untenable situation.</P>
<P>As a result, there is a certain authenticity to the scenes of Jack 
becoming accustomed to his parallel life. His relationship with "his" 
children, his attempts to engage in interests he himself never possessed 
(bowling, for example), and the occasional intrusions of his actual life, 
all strike a genuine chord. It's enough to make you wonder how we might 
react under comparable circumstances. By the end of Jack's "glimpse", the 
movie has convinced us that this other life is the ideal Jack should have 
been striving for, even if, objectively, that is not necessarily the case.</P>
<P>A large part of this is due to the splendid performances by Cage and 
Leoni, who demonstrate terrific on-screen chemistry. They make it clear 
that Jack and Kate are meant to be together, no matter what sacrifices 
had to have been made to accomplish it. One of "The Family Man"'s true 
delights is the slow revelation of all the little things that make this 
parallel life so gifted -- alternate-Jack's wedding anniversary surprises, 
for example, or the circumstances under which he came to work at the tire 
store. It is difficult not to be moved by Jack's gradual realisation of 
his deep, long-denied love for Kate, and this makes the viewer's knowledge 
of the impermanence (as Cheadle puts it) of Jack's experience all the more 
lamentable.</P>
<P>The screenplay, by David Diamond and David Weissman, has plenty of charm, 
even if it does occasionally indulge in its share of kitsch. A predictable 
scene in which Jack tries to change the baby's diapers, for example, is an 
excursion into unnecessarily sitcom-level humour which mercifully does not 
go on for too long. For the most part, though, Diamond and Weissman do a 
good job of balancing comedy and drama. They also successfully maintain 
the reality of Jack's alternate life, not demanding too much suspension of 
disbelief in the way other characters react to Jack's strange behaviour. 
Helmer Brett Ratner is even-handed in his direction, rarely letting the 
movie get too corny and providing some beautifully touching moments as 
well.</P>
<P>Sentimentality is a tough thing to pull off in movies. Handled well, it
can make for a memorable cinemagoing experience. Handled badly, the result 
is often a thoroughly rotten work of film. "The Family Man" is not 
perfect -- it certainly won't supplant "It's A Wonderful Life" as a staple 
of holiday viewing -- but it is one of the more successful sentimental 
films in recent memory. It's a movie that's difficult to watch without 
smiling, frequently. To do otherwise would be positively, well, 
Scrooge-like.</P>
