<P>"Meet Joe Black," directed by Martin Brest (1992's "Scent of a Woman"), 
is a 170-minute remake of 1934's "Death Takes a Holiday," which ran 
78-minutes, and so judging from this, it might seem as if "Meet Joe 
Black," is an overly robust, needlessly long film, but it didn't seem 
that way at all. On the contrary, the film is a sleek, good-looking, and 
entertaining romance.</P>
<P>Set during the last week before his 65th birthday, wealthy media tycoon 
Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) awakens in his New York mansion to sharp 
heart pains, and a mysterious, godly voice repeating the word, "yes." 
The next morning, after he is transported to Manhattan by helicoptor to 
go to work, with his physician daughter, Susan (Claire Forlani), she 
stops in at a coffee shop and strikes up a conversation with a handsome, 
smooth talking man (Brad Pitt). They are smitten with each other, but 
coming out of the cafe, he is hit and killed by a car, unbenownst to 
Susan. That night, Bill gets a visitor at his door in the form of the 
man at the coffee shop. The only difference is that, as he explains, he 
is Death, who stole Pitt's body and has come to take Bill away after he 
visits the world in human form for the first time to see how it feels. 
When Susan sees Pitt, now called Joe Black to hide his identity to 
everyone else, she realizes something is different about him, but begins 
to fall in love with him nonetheless. And as Joe follows Bill around and 
begins to learn things about the world, as well as care for Susan, 
everything inevitably is leading up to Bill's gala birthday party, which 
will be his last night before he dies and is lead away by Death. </P>
<P>"Meet Joe Black," reminded me somewhat of "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," not 
because of the story, but because the film is easily divided into two 
categories: scenes of schmaltzy melodrama, and moments of extraordinary 
power and honesty. Although the film could have easily been trimmed to 
two-and-a-half hours, "Meet Joe Black," really did not seem overlong to 
me. The pacing is slow and deliberate, to be sure, but it was never 
boring, and felt more true-to-life because of this. In fact, I got a 
great satisfaction out of watching the scenes unfold. Sure, they were 
drawn out a little bit, but it's better than watching the constant 
freneticism of a Jerry Bruckheimer action movie.</P>
<P>Going back to what I was saying before about the film being divided into 
two categories, "Meet Joe Black," sometimes would attempt to suck out as 
much sentimentality as possible just to get its audience to cry, and 
near the conclusion, the music swelled up so much that it began to feel 
too sappy for my taste. </P>
<P>But then, there were scenes that were so truthful and real that I felt 
like applauding the filmmakers. Due to its length, at least one thing 
can be said for the film: all of the six central characters were written 
superbly into flesh-and-blood people. Each character was given scenes 
that really caused me to care about them, right down to the supporting 
ones. The greatest satisfaction I can get while watching a film is 
getting involved in the scenes and dialogue unto themselves, as if they 
were all separate short films. If these type of scenes are strung 
together, however, it can turn into genuine dynamite, and that is what, 
"Meet Joe Black," did.</P>
<P>Brad Pitt, who usually chooses more unconventional roles (not counting 
1989's slasher film, "Cutting Class"), proves here, like he has done in 
previous films, that he is more than just good-looking. Playing two 
different characters here, as the guy in the coffee shop, and Joe Black, 
he was truly endearing and likable. Anthony Hopkins, one of the best 
actors of this generation, is outstanding, as he has to juggle a 
character that seemingly has everything, but is forced to deal with his 
realization that his time on Earth is quickly coming to a close. Claire 
Forlani, in her first starring role, is a fresh new talent to look for 
in the future. She always seems to be filled with deep thoughts swarming 
around in her head, and has a lot of chemistry with Pitt. All of these 
performances are wonderful, and yet, the one performance that I thought 
surpassed all of the others was Marcia Gay Harden, who deserves a Best 
Supporting Actress Oscar nomination. Harden is given perhaps the most 
touching scenes in the film, as Bill's neglected older daughter, 
Allison. The most heartbreakingly true scene in the whole picture, in my 
opinion, involves the conversation between Allison and her father, as 
she tells him that she has always known she wasn't his favorite 
daughter, but remained happy because she still knew that she was loved 
by him. Harden flawlessly hits the right mark in every one of her 
scenes, and this is certainly her best film role since 1993's 
little-known gem, "Crush," not to be confused with the 1993 Alicia 
Silverstone thriller, "The Crush."</P>
<P>Judging from the many astonishing moments in the film, "Meet Joe Black," 
could have easily been one of the very best films of the year, if not 
for its occasional attempts at extreme mawkishness, and the ending, 
which felt a little bit far-fetched. Without giving anything away, the 
film might have left a more lasting, genuine impression if the last 
three minutes had been completely cut out. It was one of those frequent 
attempts at a happy ending that simply did not pay off. While not 
forgetting its faults, "Meet Joe Black" still remains a success, due to 
its intelligence and unforgettable performances, and is one of the 
better films of the 1998 Fall season, along with "Living Out Loud," and 
"Pleasantville." Unlike most big-budget Hollywood ventures, "Meet Joe 
Black," takes its time, does not hurry its story, and instead of 
condescending to its characters, refreshingly sees them as flawed, but 
sincere, three-dimensional people.</P>
