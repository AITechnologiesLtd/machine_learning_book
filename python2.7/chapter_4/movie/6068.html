<P>     Whenever I hear an actor talk about needing to "stretch," I generally
feel the need to stretch my legs very far in the opposite direction.  I do
not mean to suggest that actors are not artists who seek out new
challenges.  It is simply that those who usually make the biggest noise
about moving beyond one type of role in which they have been successful
are also those who have lingered in that one role for a very good reason.
Hugh Grant had become so familiar as a stammering, self-effacing light
comedian that one would be forgiven for suspecting that was all he had in
him.  As evidence to the contrary, witness EXTREME MEASURES, a solid
Hollywood thriller in which Grant takes to the role of suspense hero like
a producer to a sequel.</P>
<P>     Grant plays Dr. Guy Luthan, an emergency room surgeon in a New York
public hospital who has grown accustomed to the chaos and life-or-death
judgments which come with the job.  He thinks he has seen everything,
until a homeless man is brought in one night experiencing unexplainable
symptoms.  The man's sudden death piques Guy's curiosity, but when he
begins looking for autopsy records, he finds that the body has
disappeared; further, the man's records seem to have been purged from the
hospital's computer files.  Guy smells a conspiracy, but before he can
investigate further he is framed for drug possession and fired from his
job.  His life in a shambles, Guy does the only thing he can do:  throw
all his energy into finding out who is behind the frame-up, and how it is
connected to the research of Dr. Lawrence Myrick (Gene Hackman).</P>
<P>     As a rule, the Hollywood suspense thrillers of recent years have been
a rather sorry lot, and I believe that one of the reasons has been that
constant attempts to shock are being substituted for the creation of
mounting tension.  Director Michael Apted has made some of the more
intriguing character-based suspense yarns of recent years (THUNDERHEART,
BLINK), and EXTREME MEASURES has a way of getting under your skin.  It is
an exceptionally well-paced film, with Guy's dilemma growing
incrementally; its effect is based on watching Guy get deeper and deeper
in trouble, rather than watching him hurtle from one life-threatening
confrontation to the next.  There is also at least one completely
unexpected turn which seems to put Guy in an impossible situation, and a
fight in an elevator which might truly bring you to the edge of your seat. </P>
<P>     Anchoring it all is Hugh Grant, who appears determined to go all the
way in becoming "the next Cary Grant" by playing a Hitchcockian man who
knew too much.  Grant is exceptionally convincing as an ER surgeon,
approaching every crisis with a matter-of-fact professionalism and
confidence.  It is tempting to play such characters as arrogant, and in
the case of EXTREME MEASURES it would be even more tempting so that the
story could be based around a lesson about playing God.  But Guy is simply
a scientist whose basic curiosity gets him into a completely unexpected
mess, and there is such a consistency to Grant's performance that his
comic and dramatic moments merge seamlessly.  It is an eye-opening piece
of acting, and all the more challenging because Grant has to carry nearly
every scene.</P>
<P>     If there is one major frustration in EXTREME MEASURES, it is that
Apted and screenwriter Tony Gilroy don't handle the conspiracy at its
center very well.  It is obvious what is going on far too early,
particularly if you have seen any of the trailers which essentially give
everything away.  That detracts from the process of discovery, and might
make you impatient as you simply wait for Guy to figure out what you have
known for over an hour.  The conclusion tries to shove far too much into
far too little time -- a physical showdown; the outlining of a moral
dilemma; the attempt to flesh out Hackman's role, which is really a
glorified cameo -- resulting in a thriller which sags exactly when it
should be peaking.  It is fortunate that the preceding ninety minutes is
so energetic and involving.  It is even more fortunate that Hugh Grant is
so well-suited to his role, and that it proves not to be such a stretch to
think of him in a lab coat rather than just a morning coat.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 research Grants:  7.</PRE>
