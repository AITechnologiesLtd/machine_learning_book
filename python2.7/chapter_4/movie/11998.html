<P>One of the five finalists for the Oscar for Best Foreign Film, this entry
from Macedonia does not wait to let its position and feelings known. This
film starts with powerful music and developments to get
directly into the meat of the story.</P>
<P>The film is told in three parts, and we find that the ending of the story is
in actuality the start of the first story.  However, the photographs in the
second and third stories are about the very first story.  So we end up with
what might be a cyclical story, but in essence is not.  The priests discuss
the continuity of the world and how things are cyclical.  And for these
people, and their families, the only cyclical thing is death, and senseless
killing.  The law in the hands of whoever feels he is in charge.</P>
<P>Macedonia has some intricate problems with the Albanians, and it is
something which has lasted several hundreds of years, and has never been
fixed.  On top of it, the Albanians do not have a homeland per se, because
their space is occupied by the Macedonians.  The usual religious
divisions are clear.  We have the Christian fashion and the Moslem fashion.
The indication in this film, is that the Moslem fashion is basically
uncivilized, and runs its own rules.  The Christian fashion
adheres to its own biblical stuff, taken from the BOOKS.  Which is the first
part of the story.  It is called WORDS. And it already depicts how the
chants and the words of the religious structure already are
failing in its desires and tasks.  They do not stand by the young man,
regardless of his culpability.  Fate brought the young girl to his room,
rather than another priest's.</P>
<P>The second story, exploits a photographer and his editor ( lover as well, it
seems ), and his desire to go home and get away from the wars.  He has just
been in Bosnia, where things are not exactly peaceful.  His editor and him
can not get it together, she is still married to an Englishman, and the
whole thing ends up in a tragic disaster for her.</P>
<P>And the third story, is the best.  The photographer comes home to his own
people.  But they are still caught up in the lawlessness of their own
country.  And while he means well, and to rescue the
daughter of the woman he would have married, were circumstances a bit
different ( she is a servant and second class citizen now ), he is now faced
with the same problem that we saw in the first story.
The family structure is meaningless, in light of the political decisions
that everyone has come to make and live by.</P>
<P>The brutal film then follows the young girl that has managed to save her
life, and we are back at the start.  Things are indeed cyclical.  But does
it really matter.? No.  No one learns their lesson.  The viciousness, even
between family members, has fostered for so many years that nothing seems to
be able to end it. The sad point, and the film kinda drops it quietly, when
Alexandr dies ( he has a smile on his face ), is that the best solution is
for all this thing to come to the saddest ending of all.</P>
<P>SHOULD SEE
