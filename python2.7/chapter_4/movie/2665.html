          - Timon the meerkat</PRE>
<P>     Disney has done it again!  Surprised?  Forget the cross promotions
and tie-ins-from-hell, the strengths of THE LION KING are many and you
could waste an entire afternoon going over the giddy delights of this
full-length animated feature. Rich imagery, colorful characters, and
timeless themes are just some of the reasons to roar about THE KING.</P>
<P>     The story--an agreeable blend of HAMLET, BAMBI, and THE JUNGLE
BOOK--introduces Simba, a young lion lad whose father, Mufasa, is
king. But when the king is crowned by his scheming brother Scar, young
Simba is led to believe that he caused his father's death.  Simba flees
the kingdom, instilled with the guilt that will inhibit his return as
an adult.  The cub pairs with a pair of jungle johns--Pumbaa the wart
hog and Timon the meerkat--who teach Simba the bare necessities,
including their philosophy of "no worries"--a mantra that will prove
quite convenient for Simba to run away from responsibility.</P>
<PRE>     And you thought this was just a cartoon.</PRE>
<P>     THE LION KING borrows the best from "big three," incorporating the
anachronistic humor of ALADDIN, the somber splendor of BEAUTY AND THE
BEAST, and the youthful vigor of THE LITTLE MERMAID.  (Not to mention
almost *all* of BAMBI.)</P>
<P>     There's action and adventure and, of course, music.  Glorious,
sweeping music from a score (by Hans Zimmer) that, oddly, is better
than the songs (by Tim Rice and Elton John). These tunes lack the
obvious wit of previous partners Alan Menken and Howard Ashman and,
with the exception of the "Be Prepared" (sung by Irons), are little
more than agreeable filler.</P>
<P>     The characterizations are some of the most diverse that Disney's
done to date. No humans are on hand, for a change, and no one flies
solo ala Robin Williams. Not even second-half scene-stealer Nathan Lane
as Timon.  Best of the best is Irons as Scar, who takes his place in
the long-standing line of memorable Disney villains.</P>
<P>     The film stumbles a bit in the art department.  Some of the
segments--such as a computer-aided stampede of wildebeest--are
breathtaking to behold. Other, less-involved scenes use simple
backdrops that are almost eyesores by comparison.  The entire final
sequence, for example, looks almost unfinished.</P>
<P>     THE LION KING is an enthusiastic sign that the Disney *still* has
room for improvement. Sure, THE KING is a grand entertainment and is
easily one of the best films so far this year.  But add better songs
and more computer graphics and *then* we'll see something the likes of
which we've never seen before.</P>
<PRE>PARENTS:  King Mufasa dies a violent death in the film.  Should you take
          the young ones to this?  To see or not see?  That is the
          question that I cannot answer. (I cried in *every* scene.)</PRE>
<PRE>BOTTOM LINE:  Once again, one of the best films (so far) this year is
              from Disney.  THE LION KING is grand entertainment. Go
              have a good cry.</PRE>
