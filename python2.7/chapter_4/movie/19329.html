<P>   Based on writer-director Rick Famuyiwa's life in the upper-
middle class California suburb of Inglewood (hence the title),
"The Wood" is a sporadically funny buddy movie about three
men who meet in junior high school, and carry on their
friendship through high school and beyond--ultimately getting
together yet again at the wedding ceremony of one of the
pleasant young men.  Famuyiwa's comedy features an all-
black cast (just two white faces appear briefly in the entire
movie).  Unlike "Waiting to Exhale" and "The Color Purple"
man-hating is conpicuously absent except on a comic level;
unlike "Dead Presidents" and a host of 1970s blaxploitation
films there is no violence to speak of.  And except for a
single use of the term "whiteboy" used without hostility, the
story elicits no racial animosity of even a single mention of
racial conflict. If Rick Famiyiwa's tale is truly autobiographical,
he is interested primarily in evoking the sweet memories of
life with his two good pals over the period of more than a
decade.  Since the African-Americans in the story are for the
most part upper middle-class, the subtext running throughout
is that if you have money, you don't face the devastating
problems associated with growing up in poor neighborhoods.  </P>
<P>   As in Neil Simon's play "Plaza Suite," the movie hones in
on a person who gets high anxiety on a wedding day.  Unlike
Mr. Simon's bride--who hides in the bathroom until she is
coaxed out by her friends and neighbors--the groom, Roland
(Taye Diggs, whom you'll remember for his role as Angela
Bassett's muscular playboy in "How Stella Got Her Groove
Back")--drinks himself into a stupor at the home of a former
girlfriend to reconsider his resolution.  The wedding which is
to take place between Roland and Lisa (Lisaraye) is used as
a framing device.  Most of the movie deals with the hopes
and fears of the trio of male buddies when they were teens,
though Famuyiwa frequently flashes to the present to
punctuate the close bond felt by the three men.</P>
<P>   As the trio reminisce, they are brought back at first to the
meeting between the 14-year-old South Carolina exile Mike
(Sean Nelson) and the two who take the greenhorn in to
show him the ropes: young Slim (Duane Finley) and young
Roland (Trent Cameron).  At first bewildered by the hipness
of California after his childhood in Winston-Salem, Mike is to
grow from an awkward lad who had never danced (much less
kissed a girl) to the winner of two macho bets he makes with
his new pals--which become the source of much of the
comedy.  Hoping to fit in with his new acquaintances, Mike
bets that he will have the guts to pinch the booty (butt) of a
classmate, the gorgeous Alicia (Malinda Williams).  He later
ups the ante when he joins the others in betting who will be
the first boy to lose his virginity (though apparently the fellows
are willing to trust one another on this one).  The story's
funniest scenes occur as Steve Bernstein's camera focuses
on each of the three would-be studs as he races the others in
the separate bedrooms.</P>
<P>   For better or worse, "The Wood" never takes on the
vulgarity of "American Pie," which is based on a similar
wager, or the caustic tone of "Cruel Intentions," which centers
on a bet that one Casanova will successfully deflower a
confirmed virgin.  Instead, "The Wood" is most engaged in
illustrating the value and resilience of friendship, appending
the insight that the bond between males is more secure than
the attachment between the sexes.  While Mike, Slim and
Roland remain the best of buddies throughout, none of the
three is still hanging out with his school-time girl friend,
though Mike may just get a second chance when he runs into
his high-school confidant and lover at the wedding.</P>
<P>   While the ensemble perform their roles flawlessly, the
characters are far more interesting as teens than they are as
more-or-less proper and reasonably responsible adults. 
Omar Epps as the older Mike appears to be the writer's alter
ego, at times even facing the camera as though he were
acting on the stage narrating a few details for the sole benefit
of the audience.  Richard T. Jones as the adult Slim and
Taye Diggs as the adult Roland complement Epps'
performance reliably in this pleasant but ultimately mild take
on the altogether small problems faced by people with
money.  </P>
