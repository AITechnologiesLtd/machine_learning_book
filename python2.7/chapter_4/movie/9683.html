<PRE>DAYLIGHT</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Brian Takeshita</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  ** out of ****</PRE>
<P>An explosion in an underwater tunnel connecting Manhattan and New
Jersey leaves the few survivors trapped and nearly inaccessible.  One
man, Kit Latura, can save them.  The problem is, Kit used to be head
of the Emergency Medical Service, but these days he is a driver for a
car service.  What happened?  Trying to effect a rescue, he made the
wrong call and got people killed.  Only the immediacy of the crisis
can jolt him back into action.  Sound familiar?  A few years ago, a
film starring Sylvester Stallone and based on a similar premise was
called CLIFFHANGER.  A couple of years before that, another movie
based on the same idea was called DEMOLITION MAN.  Stallone was in
that one, too.  This movie is called DAYLIGHT.  Hey, Kit Latura is
played by....Sylvester Stallone!</P>
<P>Ever see THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE?  Apparently so did Leslie Bohem, who
wrote the script for DAYLIGHT, since the survivors are all patterned
after characters from the 1972 movie.  We have Madelyne (Amy
Brenneman), a frustrated playwright who's purpose is to be scared when
Stallone needs to look strong, and to get into trouble when we need a
lady in distress, much like Pamela Sue Martin's Susan.  We have Steven
(Jay O. Sanders) the brute who is there to question everything Kit
does, just like Ernest Borgnine's Mr. Rogo.  There's Eleanor and Roger
Trilling (Claire Bloom and Colin Fox), an elderly couple who realize
the importance of having each other.  Did someone say Shelley Winters
and Jack Albertson?  Let's not forget George (Stan Shaw), the police
officer who knows his way around the tunnels.  It's good Stallone has
this guy, just like Gene Hackman had Roddy McDowell as the steward who
knew his way around the ship.</P>
<P>The borrowing from THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE goes beyond the supporting
characters themselves.  Even some of their fates are the same.  Oh,
and don't even get me started on plot points.  The disagreement on
which way to go, swimming underwater to find an exit, getting the
medallion out to the loved one (okay, in this case it's a bracelet),
they're all there.  Halfway through the movie, I wondered if DAYLIGHT
were a remake.</P>
<P>I should mention a key element which made the supporting characters of
DAYLIGHT different from the ones in THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE.  With few
exceptions, the characters in DAYLIGHT are all unworthy of our
sympathy.  Madelyne is fed up with New York due to the roaches and
rats in her apartment and her constant rejections from potential
producers, but the last straw comes when the married man with whom she
is having an affair can't get out of his marriage.  Oh yeah, I really
feel for her.  Eleanor and Roger's biggest concern is why their
Weimaraner won't breed.  Sure, poverty in New York City's streets
needs to take a powder and make way for the dog.  You get the idea.
At least you cared what happened to Red Buttons and Carol Lynley.</P>
<P>Stallone's performance in this film is much like the premise:  The
same as in previous movies.  Not to say it's a bad thing.  Stallone
has always been a convincing action hero and has played that kind of
part a lot better than the comedic roles he's tried in order to flex
those acting muscles.  It's just that we're not seeing anything new
this time around.  The supporting cast, on the other hand, turn in
lackluster performances of stock characters.  They might as well have
phoned it in.</P>
<P>The action itself is all stuff we've seen before.  Much of Stallone's
hanging from the tunnel ceilings looks a lot like he wants to prove he
can still climb like in CLIFFHANGER.  There's a scene with Stallone
and Brenneman in an underwater vortex which looks a great deal like
the last few minutes of TWISTER.  The most contrived of all scenes,
however, is the set up for Stallone's famous slow motion run away from
danger.  It's usually from an explosion or collapsing building or some
other such catastrophe, which invariably culminates in a leap toward
the camera.  Pained yell is optional.  In DAYLIGHT, Stallone runs from
a rolling flammable liquid trailer.  It's not really in slow motion,
but he's running in three and a half feet of water, so the illusion is
thus created.  Yes, yes, he makes the leap, but instead of toward the
camera to spirit himself that extra distance from danger, he leaps to
the side!  One wonders, "Why didn't he do that when the trailer was
much farther away?"  To create a false sense of tension, stupid.</P>
<P>One thing that caught my eye was how director Rob Cohen handles the
tunnel explosion.  Unlike anything I've seen before, this film
actually takes you into the explosion and keeps you there while the
fireball rolls over the unfortunate motorists.  Its debatable whether
or not what we see is an accurate representation, but the visual of
the whole thing is rather intriguing, and the notion of incineration
from the heat or asphyxiation from the fire's consumption of oxygen is
equally horrifying.  However, that was the only part of the movie that
was innovative.  Oh, in case you're about to tell me that flooding a
compartment in order to free yourself from Davy Jones' Locker is also
innovative, I refer you to AIRPORT '77.</P>
<P>Overall, DAYLIGHT is not a bad movie for what it is, which is two
hours of, well, Stallone.  You don't go into one of his movies
expecting great social commentary, so as long as you keep that in
mind, you can actually enjoy it.  I must, however, give credit to this
film for actually making me believe that the death-defying dog didn't
defy death after all.  You see, the dog in question was thought to
have died in the explosion, but soon comes trotting out from the
wreckage when called.  Fair enough.  But then, when the band of
survivors has to swim underwater to relative safety, the dog
(seemingly) does not make it.  I thought, "Wow, they killed the dog
after all."  Only after another tragedy does the dog resurface,
unscathed.  I'm beginning to think that dogs, not cats, have nine
lives.</P>
