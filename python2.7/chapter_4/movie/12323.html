<PRE>                        BLUES BROTHERS 2000 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                       1 :-(  for the missing fun</PRE>
<P>Cast: Dan Aykroyd, John Goodman, Joe Morton, J. Evan Bonifant, Nia
Peeples, Aretha Franklin, James Brown, B.B. King
Director: John Landis
Screenplay: Dan Aykroyd and John Landis
Music: Paul Shaffer U.S.</P>
<P>No sequel, can hope to bare, an inherent a cult classic as THE BLUES
BROTHERS, as brilliant a heir. There was something unique about the time
it was made, in the era of the early 80's, when the world was crying out
for something loud, original and immensely destructive to hit the
screens. The reply to this call of the wild was of course, THE BLUES
BROTHERS.</P>
<P>It is almost 20 years since the original hit the screens, but the world
is not howling for the likes of BLUES BROTHERS 2000. Why? Maybe it's
just the way of the times. This isn't an awful movie by any means, it
just lacks that cheeky sparkle of John Belushi. Dan Ackroyd is back, a
lean-n-mean, slim-n-trim, Elwood Blues. He's good and this is probably
his best role for some time, but he cannot carry this movie alone. John
Goodman, is Mighty Mack who sings the blues true, but even he cannot
fill the shoes of the missing Belushi. The other newcomer is a
twelve-year-old orphan, Buster Blues (J. Bonifant), who plays the
harmonica like mother's milk, but really he should be sucking on a
breast instead of hanging with the dudes.</P>
<P>Look, if you're here to listen to the music, then you've come to the
right cinema. Let's face it, there's no one who sings, plays, thinks
blues better than the likes of Aretha, James, Eric, Stevie, Charlie,
Billy, Lou, Joshua, Travis, Jimmie, Wylie, Grover, Paul, Steve, Donald,
Murphy, Lou, Tom, Allan, Matt and the BLUES BROTHERS, all jamming
together for a grand finale. Well, that's a dream come true for lovers
of soul.  However, for the rest of the world, this is not the ecstatic
reunion of home coming queens. So perhaps in another twenty years, there
may be a more successful resurrection of BLUES BROTHERS 2020 – something
more in keeping with Beverly Hills 90210?</P>
