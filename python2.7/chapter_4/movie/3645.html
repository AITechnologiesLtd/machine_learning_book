<P>     Controversy is swirling around BANDIT QUEEN, likely to be one of 
1995's most discussed features.  Supposedly based on the real-life 
experiences of a modern Indian folk hero named Phoolan Devi, the 
authenticity of the film's script is now under attack by none other than 
the subject herself.  Devi has not only disavowed her autobiography, but 
has filed a lawsuit to keep BANDIT QUEEN from being released in Indian 
theaters.  At this point, there is enough confusion surrounding the 
factual accuracy of the movie that its claim to be "a true story" should 
be accepted with reservations.  Nevertheless, regardless of its 
historical veracity, BANDIT QUEEN is an excellent examination of caste 
discrimination, human suffering, and the role of women in India's 
changing culture. </P>
<P>     Two phrases encapsulate the backdrop against which this story 
unfolds.  The first is a quote shown on-screen at the film's start:  
"Animals, drums, illiterates, low castes and women are worthy of being 
beaten."  The second is a statement by Phoolan Devi's father:  "A 
daughter is always a burden..."  It is into this male-centered culture 
that Devi is born in the late 1950s.  Her entire life from the age of 
eleven, when she is married to a much older man, is devoted to fighting 
for the rights of women and striking blows against a viciously 
prejudiced social structure. </P>
<P>     After running away from her husband, Devi is captured and abused by 
bandits.  Eventually, she joins a gang, and it isn't long before her 
reputation as a Robin Hood-like figure becomes known across India.  She 
exacts revenge on those who betrayed her, becoming the chief instigator 
of 1980's Behmai Massacre, where 24 men are killed.  The authorities 
prove unable to capture Devi, and she remains on the loose until 1983, 
when a deal with the Indian government brings about her surrender. </P>
<P>     The picture of human indignity and suffering painted by BANDIT 
QUEEN is on par with that  of SCHINDLER'S LIST.  As the Nazis treated 
the Jews like animals, so too do the upper caste Indians regard those 
born into poverty and squalor.  Compared to some of the indignities 
experienced by Devi, death would have been quick and merciful.  Multiple 
rapes and public humiliation are only a few of the torments she must 
endure, and each atrocity further hardens her heart.  When it comes, 
Devi's revenge is indeed a dish best served cold. </P>
<P>     Making the film was an undeniable challenge for director Kapur, an 
upper-caste Hindu who, along with writer Mala Sen, based as much of 
BANDIT QUEEN on interpretations of what Devi didn't say in her diaries 
as on what she did say.  There is also no doubt that the movie will have 
a vastly different impact in its country of origin than in the West, 
where we bring a foreign cultural perspective to a viewing.  But there's 
no question that this is the sort of picture capable of causing waves of 
world wide contention, regardless of how true or untrue particular 
elements are.  Fiction can often have as much impact as fact, especially 
if it is well-grounded in reality.   </P>
<P>     Tightly-paced, powerfully-written, and well-acted, BANDIT QUEEN is 
a first-rate adventure movie.  Like SCHINDLER'S LIST, there is no 
political diatribe here.  Actions and events are allowed to define the 
social climate.  The film manages to grip the audience in a way that no 
preachy commentary ever will.  Devi, as strikingly portrayed by actress 
Seema Biswas, becomes real, and it doesn't take long for us to feel her 
seething rage at the mountain of injustices rising above her.  It is 
uncomfortable to sympathize with someone who becomes so ruthless and 
uncompromising, but that is the gut-wrenching path along which director 
Kapur drags us.  BANDIT QUEEN is not for the squeamish, or for those who 
prefer not to be challenged or unsettled by a motion picture.  Because, 
whatever your feelings about the movie or its protagonist, BANDIT QUEEN 
will not leave you apathetic.  </P>
