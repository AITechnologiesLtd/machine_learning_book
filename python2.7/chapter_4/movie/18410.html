<PRE>Orgazmo (1998)
***1/2 out of *****</PRE>
<P>Cast: Trey Parker, Matt Stone, Dian Bachar, Michael Dean Jacobs, Ron
Jeremy, Lloyd Kaufman
Written and Directed by: Trey Parker
Running Time: 94 minutes</P>
<P>Crude, low-budget comedy from Matt Stone and Trey Parker, the creators
of Comedy Central's smash hit "South Park".  Filmed before "South
Park" became a big hit, but released after Stone and Parker's summer
1998 effort BASEketball, Orgazmo tells the tale of Joe Young (Trey
Parker), a mormon on a trip to Hollywood who gets mixed up in the
adult film industry after knocking on the wrong door.  Eventually,
Young becomes both a superstar in the business, as well as a crime
fighting superhero.</P>
<P>Orgazmo is certainly crude (it's rated NC-17), but nothing in the film
really offended me in any way.  It's definately low-brow humor from
start to finish, but even low-brow humor can be done well.  Of course
I could have done without seeing the "T-Rex" character or the rampant
shots of naked male ass... which yes, I understand is part of the
overall joke of the film, but still...</P>
<P>You'd probably never think that a parody of both porn and of martial
arts films would be cohesive enough to be entertaining, but Orgazmo
manages to pull it off.  Sure with these kinds of movies most of the
jokes are hit and miss, but enough of the jokes work here, therefore
making it a pretty entertaining flick for fans of Parker and Stone.
