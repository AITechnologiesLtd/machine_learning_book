FATAL INSTINCT
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>Deluge of so-called psychological and "erotic" thrillers
that started in 1987 with FATAL ATTRACTION and reached its
peak in 1992 with BASIC INSTINCT, simply had to inspire at
least one Hollywood parody. This task was given to Carl
Reiner, director who had done the similar job in his 1982
film-noir parody/homage DEAD MEN DON'T WEAR PLAID. Eleven
years later result of his efforts was comedy FATAL INSTINCT
(which incidentally shares the name with 1991 erotic
thriller starring Michael Madsen).</P>
<P>Protagonist of the film is Ned Ravine (played by Armand
Assante) who works as policeman at day and as defence
attorney at night, often defending the clients he had
arrested himself. He is happily married man, although his
cheating wife Lana (played by Kate Nelligan) plots to kill
him for insurance money. In the same time he must deal with
the romantic advances by seductive blonde Lola Cain (played
by Sean Young) and personal problems of his secretary Laura
Lincolnberry (played by Sherilyn Fenn) who escaped from
abusive husband. Another of his problems is Max Shady
(played by James Remar), ex-convict who wants to settle some
old scores with detective/lawyer.</P>
<P>Reiner definitely knows how to make a comedy, but his
scriptwriter David O'Malley missed the target. FATAL
INSTINCT indeed tried to parody best known late 1980s and
early 1990s thrillers, but those scenes are mixed with the
scenes in which the objects of parody come from classic film
noires of 1940s. This anachronistic combination doesn't look
very believable and only strengthen the impression that
O'Malley and Reiner ran out of ideas. Jokes are mostly lame
and not particularly funny, additionally limited with the
filmmaker's need to tame the humour to PG-13 levels. Actors
are more than fine, including Armand Assante in one of his
rare comedic appearances, and Sean Young again exploits her
psychotic bitch routine. Unfortunately, like many genre
parodies of 1990s Hollywood, FATAL INSTINCT too is rather
forgettable film, totally meaningless to those who were
spared from the objects of its parody.</P>
