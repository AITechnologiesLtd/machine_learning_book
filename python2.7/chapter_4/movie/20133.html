<P>Seeing as I am not an academic, I refuse to write a paper on the merits of
free-access to a film online. That will not, however, stop me from writing
several reviews on the subject. Once again my target is RigorMortis
productions, creators of the Monty Python-esque short film L'Auto, done
entirely in English. Why? Mostly this is because all of the other films I'm
finding online are not registered with the IMDB, and I am clueless as how to
do so. Anyone reading this review who knows how to do so, please tell me so
that I may report other movies of absolutely no budget.</P>
<P>In the case of Les X-Files, you can't quite say it's enjoyable. You can't
quite say it's good, either. But you can't quite say it's bad. Like all
reviews that are truly subjective and honest, I'll present you with good
points and bad points:</P>
<P>Unlike L'Auto, a movie with a French title done in English, Les X-Files is a
movie with a French title done in French, which basically means that unless
Parle vou France? Means anything special to you, forget understanding this
movie. When I watched it, part of me thought: OK, this is commentary on the
inexplicable and nature of Chris Carter's conspiracy theory cult hit, The
writer had to do for French class. Point down: scratch higher meaning.</P>
<P>The humor is more tongue-in-cheek. Since you can't understand French, it's
left to the physical and musical aspects to understand the film. Anyone who
has seen the Season 5 finale of "The X-Files" will get the plot, so they can
then appreciate the wonderful tongue-in-cheek that is shown when "Mulder"
drives her car to where "Diana" was shot to the theme of "Hawaii Five-O".
Come to think of it, maybe you don't.</P>
<P>Believe it or not, I am actually going to say that the acting was better,
despite the fact that I didn't understand a word. You can actually tell
looking at the faces of the talented and nearly all-Double X-chromosome cast
what they're trying to get across, which various soap opera actors and
actresses, despite "professional" experience, fail to do (in my humble and
wise-ass opinion, they come across looking like they're trying to fart and
not make a sound on "Days of our Lives"). Talking to the head of
RigorMortis, he acknowledged and concurred with my viewpoint.</P>
<P>And, yes, people, I do think Roberto Benigni deserved Best Actor, so can the
women who saw Sleepless in Seattle and think that Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan
should star in every movie and should win all Academy Awards please shut up
about the debate.</P>
<P>Another good point comes in the fact that everyone involved, including the
director, had a sense of humor over the entire thing: the note that he has
at the download page for this film is "Note from the Director:</P>
<P>Please do not e-mail for a translation of the film. It's presented in
French, a language that I don't speak. The only word that I can recognize is
"Une Vache," which means Cow. This film is proof that you don't have to
speak a foreign language to direct a foreign language film."</P>
<P>    Les X-Files makes me hope for the movie industry in general that the
people who run companies like RigorMortis, who act in films such as Les
my girlfriends.<HR>_____________________
