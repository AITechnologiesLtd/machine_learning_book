<PRE>A film review by Chris Loar</PRE>
<P>_Clean, Shaven_ is a minor miracle of a movie; it's risky and
innovative, and yet it's not esoteric, since the director's aim --
to put you inside the head of a schizophrenic man -- is
immediately obvious, and the occasionally obscure way the
story unfolds is no impediment to understanding what the
film is really about.  This is a film that almost no one will
enjoy watching, exactly -- and yet it's hard to imagine
anyone walking away from it unaffected.  It's not an easy
or a pleasant film to watch, but it will repay the effort many
times over.  Because while it is, on the one hand, a
fascinating and utterly horrifying trip into the mind of a
schizophrenic man, it's also a story about loneliness,
isolation, and the vast spaces that lie between ordinary
people.</P>
<P>The story revolves around the efforts of a schizophrenic man,
Peter Winter (played with astonishing power by Peter Greene)
to locate his daughter.  Along the way, we meet several lesser
players -- Peter's mother, his daughter, and Jack McNally,
the detective who is pursuing him on suspicion of a brutal murder.
We follow Peter as he is released (or escapes) from a hospital
and steals an ancient, decrepit car.  We remain in large part
attached to Peter's point of view, and Kerrigan makes good
use of all the arthouse techniques at his disposal -- eerie
close-ups on mundane objects combine with bizarre sound
effects and half-intelligible dialogue offscreen, and even the
rather ordinary processes of shaving and pouring cream into
coffee become genuinely disturbing.</P>
<P>What makes Greene's performance so compelling is the
fear and desperation that bleed into his every gesture,
each twitch, each blink of a wide, terrified eye.  Peter
is profoundly alone -- cut off not just from other people
but from the stability of daily reality that we all take for
granted.  The film's most startling effect is to take all
these fairly stock film techniques and transform them
into something that helps us experience some of that
isolation and fear.</P>
<P>This effect is intensified by the enigmatic way in which
the story unfolds; the film provides us with nothing
especially stable to cling to, either, except for Peter's
terrified presence.  We identify with him because we
have nothing else to cling to.  Peter, unfortunately,
doesn't have anything to cling to but a damaged
photograph of his daughter.  In his loneliness and
despair, he's drawn to her -- perhaps the only person
alive to whom he feels any sense of connection.</P>
<P>Intercut with Peter's search are sequences, often no less
disturbing, that focus on the secondary players.  These
characters are, in their own ways, no less alone than
Peter, and the fact that they are "normal" makes their
isolation is all the more unsettling.  In various sequences
we see Peter's mother biding her time alone in her large
house; Peter's daughter waiting by herself for her adoptive
mother to pick her up after school; Detective Jack McNally
drinking alone in a noisy bar.  Each of these scenes is
created using the same cinematic tools that create Peter's
reality -- an erratic soundtrack, disorienting close-ups --
and the consistency of this technique emphasizes the
isolation that these characters all have in common.</P>
<P>Ultimately, Kerrigan's emphasis on loneliness and
what keeps us apart feels utterly hopeless.  The
movie creates a feeling that nothing can be
accomplished, that serious human contact -- real
intimacy -- is impossible, or at least rare.  Even the
most poignant emotional connection made between
characters in this film -- the powerful, immediate bond
between Peter and his daughter in the movie's final
scenes -- seems to founder on misunderstandings and
incompatible illusions.  I'm not at all sure I like that
hopelessness, particularly after the film has taken such
pains to show us that we can get inside another person's
head -- that while every man may be an island, we're all
capable of building bridges.  But that's a minor quibble.
The film's real achievement resides in helping us see
the world through the eyes of men and women who feel
alone; in that achievement lies something unbearably hopeful.  </P>
