<PRE>                             SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW
                       A film review by Michael Redman
                        Copyright 1997 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Julia Ormond (Smilla) is in her chilly element as a Greenland Inuit
loner now residing unhappily in Copenhagen. Her only friend is a young
boy who lives in her apartment building. When she finds him dead from a
fall from the roof, it is the beginning of a mystery.</P>
<P>The film is heavy in atmospheric mood and engrossing. For the first
two-thirds that is. Then things get weird and the movie jumps sideways
into an "X-Files" story.  The switch from a riddle involving corporate
cover-ups (seems to be all the rage) to a science fiction plot is a bit
too much to take and the film falls apart at the end.</P>
<P>Wonderful cinematography and settings do their best to keep interest
alive and succeed although it would have been nice to have watched the
ending to the film that I saw the beginning of.</P>
