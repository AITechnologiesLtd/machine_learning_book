<PRE>Adam's Rib (1949)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 66</PRE>
<P>"Adam's Rib" is a comedy starring Spencer Tracy and
Katherine Hepburn, one of many films that they made
together.  The film is well cast and well directed,
with a fairly good script.  The script does resort
to petty bickering, and some of the characters
should have been made more sympathetic.  The script
also makes unnecessary points about gender equality.</P>
<P>The story has Tracy and Hepburn as a married couple.
Tracy is a Prosecutor, Hepburn an attorney, and they
end up on opposite sides of an attempted murder trial.
Judy Holliday is the not-too-bright defendant, having
shot her negligent husband Tom Ewell after catching
him with floosie Jean Hagen.  Hepburn's defense
relies on the dubious assumption that a husband would
be found innocent of such a shooting, and thus
convicting Holliday would be a sexist double standard.
The Tracy/Hepburn marriage is strained by Hepburn's
zealous defense, and also by obnoxious composer
David Wayne, who has the hots for Hepburn.</P>
<P>This comedy has two love triangles, Holliday-Ewell-Hagen
and Tracy-Hepburn-Wayne.  One problem is that all
members of the first triangle are unsympathetic,
and that justice would be served by locking them
all indefinitely in the same jail cell.  The second
love triangle is more interesting, especially since
Hepburn subtly encourages Wayne's behavior.  Movie
audiences at the time may have taken a pool as to when
Spencer would finally punch Wayne.  He does so, at about
the ninety minute mark, and certainly no jury would
convict him of assault.</P>
<P>The point being made by the Ruth Gordon/Garson Kanin
script is that there is little difference between the
sexes.  During the trial, Hepburn puts three women
on the stand.  They have no relevance to the case,
except that they have all succeeded in "masculine"
fields.  Hepburn makes a circus of the trial, enraging
Tracy.  Tracy is clearly the more sympathetic of the
protagonists.</P>
<P>The basic story is good, and served as a premise for
an "Adam's Rib" television series in 1973.  The script
received an Oscar nomination, and the New York Film
Critics Circle awarded Judy Holliday their Best Actress
award.</P>
