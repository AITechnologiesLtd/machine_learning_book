<P>"Off to the movies we shall go,
Where we learn everything that we know,
'Cause the movies teach us what our parents don't have time to say."
from "Mountain Song," written by Trey Parker and Marc Shaiman</P>
<P>So begins the animated musical "South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut," 
which starts off strong, sags quite a bit in the middle, but comes back 
for a rousing finale. The big-screen version of the popular TV series is 
staggeringly profane and very funny, although it may prove troublesome to 
those gentle souls offended by non-stop swearing, bathroom humor, 
sacrilegious remarks and jokes about "family values," small town 
Americana, Heaven, Hell, the movie ratings system, racism, abortion, 
menstruation, rednecks, gays, Christians, Jews, Canadians, doctors, 
homeless people, fat people, the military, the Presidency, Saddam Hussein,
 Bryan Adams, Anne Murray, Celine Dion, Alanis Morissette, Winona Ryder, 
Brooke Shields, the Baldwin Brothers, Bill Gates and Jar Jar Binks. Give 
creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone credit, though: they treat Olympic 
skater Brian Boitano with the utmost of respect.</P>
<P>A word of warning to parents: Even if you allow your children to watch 
"South Park" on TV, do not let them see this movie without first 
screening it yourself. "Bigger, Longer and Uncut" is a comedy for adults 
that takes full advantage of its "R" rating. </P>
<P>In fact, parents who fail to adequately monitor their children are key to 
the film's plot. After eight-year-old twerps Stan Marsh, Kenny McCormick, 
Kyle Broflovski and Eric Cartman take in a screening of "Asses of Fire," 
an R-rated movie starring their favorite TV stars, Canadian comics 
Terrance and Phillip, they emerge from the theater with a broader 
vocabulary, courtesy of their newly uncensored heroes. When the children 
of the sleepy little Colorado town of South Park begin swearing like 
longshoremen, their parents wildly overreact, leading to the United 
States declaring war on Canada. </P>
<P>As happens weekly on the TV version of "South Park," Kenny dies horribly, 
only this time we follow him into the afterlife. Rejected from Heaven, 
Kenny plummets to Hell, where he overhears a conversation between Satan 
and his lover, Saddam Hussein. To save the world, Kenny must return to 
Earth and somehow prevent the pending execution of Terrance and Phillip.  </P>
<P>While the animation for the big screen "South Park" remains as 
delightfully crude as the original, co-writers Parker, Stone and Pam 
Brady use their new forum to create a lavish send-up of animated musicals.
 The 12 songs lampoon everything from Broadway style show stoppers to 
cheesy power ballads. Highlights include "Uncle Fucka," an obscenity-fest 
from Terrance and Phillip, "Blame Canada," a brassy offering from the 
parents, the peppy "Kyle's Mom's A Bitch" and "Up There," a terrifically 
hokey "inspirational" number from Satan himself, complete with the Dark 
Lord breaking into a falsetto during the overwrought climax, as a choir 
swells behind him. </P>
<P>The songs, with lyrics by Parker and music by Marc Shaiman, are hilarious 
dead-on parodies, but for a film only 82 minutes long, a dozen tunes are 
a bit much (although I can't imagine cutting even one of these nasty 
little ditties). Surprisingly, Chef (Isaac Hayes), the one character who 
routinely croons on the TV series, doesn't sing a note here. </P>
<P>After a powerhouse beginning, "Bigger, Longer and Uncut" suffers from a 
flaccid midsection. The boys organize "La Resistance," a children's 
crusade to rescue Terrance and Phillip, while Kenny counsels Satan about 
his codependent relationship with Saddam Hussein. Both storylines are 
sporadically amusing, but fail to sustain the riotous tone established 
earlier in the film. Thankfully, everything builds to an ending that 
almost recaptures the energy level of the opening. And, as an added treat,
 fans get to clearly see and hear little Kenny for the first time.</P>
<P>At once a scattershot satire and a feature-length dirty joke, "South 
Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut" is a hoot, a spirited, invigorating 
exercise in tastelessness. Some fans will bemoan the musical format, 
while social observers will likely wail that the film is another example 
of how far our culture has fallen. To both groups, I can only quote the 
immortal words of Eric Cartman: "Screw you guys, I'm going home."</P>
