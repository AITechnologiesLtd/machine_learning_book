<PRE>VALENTINE</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * 1/2</PRE>
<P>Directed by: Jamie Blanks
Written by: Tom Savage (novel), Donna Powers, Wayne Powers, Gretchen J. 
Berg, Aaron Harberts</P>
<P>Remember the boy who everyone teased back in elementary school? Well 
thirteen years later he sure remembers all those girls who gave him the cold 
shoulder. Kate Davies (Marley Shelton), Paige Prescott (Denise Richards), 
Dorothy Wheeler (Jessica Capshaw), and Lily Voight (Jessica Cauffiel) have 
just learned that one of their old chums from school has been brutally 
murdered. Said chum had received a threatening valentine signed J.M. only 
moments before the attack. The girls get to thinking, and decide it could 
just be that kid, Jeremy, whom they all (except the kindly Kate of course) 
used to tease. Now suspicions are running rampant as the girls try to decide 
who Jeremy could really be. Is it Kate's drunken boyfriend Adam (David 
Boreanaz)? Or how about Dorothy's latest beau, Campbell (Daniel Cosgrove)? 
Or possibly one of the hundreds of fellows Paige has seduced over the years? 
Whoever it may be, the girls are getting knocked off one by one, and they'd 
better find out soon.</P>
<P>My theory remains sound. There is a direct correlation between the number of 
writers on a movie, and how bad the movie is. One writer, you're in good 
shape; two, you should still be alright; three, things are looking bleak; 
four, don't hold your breath waiting for that Oscar; five, you might as well 
entitle the movie "Bomb." Jamie Blanks' (previously responsible for 
unleashing <i>Urban Legend</i> on unsuspecting audiences) <i>Valentine</i> 
nestles itself nicely between those last two options. It's not a complete 
bomb, but it's about as close as you can get before crossing the line. 
Nearly all the requisite brainless teen slasher movie elements are present: 
talentless actors, talentless director, cardboard characters, predictable 
deaths, painful dialogue. The only things this movie is missing which most 
slasher flicks contain are cheesy gore and cheesier laughs. The latter is 
most confusing, since some modern slasher flicks have a certain amusing, 
self-referential wit; and the others have a certain irritating self 
referential wit. <i>Valentine</i>, on the other hand, is strangely somber 
and laughess. The characters appear dreary and depressed even before the 
murders start, and that tone doesn't let up.</P>
<P>Critiquing the acting "talents" in your average slasher movie is an utterly 
pointless endeavor at best, yet I feel compelled to subject myself to it 
once more. What better place to start than with a quick description of 
Denise Richards' (<i>Wild Things</i>) unique interpretation of acting? 
Actually, in all seriousness, Denise doesn't do too poorly this time around. 
Of course, that could be because the majority of her co-stars are somehow 
even worse than she, but I'll leave that decision up to you. Next up we've 
got Jessica Cauffiel (<i>Urban Legends: Final Cut</i>) in a slight part, and 
I'm happy to report that she gives a slight performance. I won't subject you 
to a description of Jessica Capshaw's (<i>The Love Letter</i>) vain attempts 
at pretending to act, suffice to say she's in desperate need of coaching, 
practice, or a new career. Marley Shelton (<i>Sugar & Spice</i>) is 
adequate.. I suppose.. in her own limited sort of way. I do realize it's 
asking too much for really good performances in a teen slasher flick, but 
what can I say, I'm greedy. I won't bother talking about most of the male 
actors since none of them are given any development beyond "I wanna have 
sex!" The only exception is David Boreanaz (TV's "Angel"), woefully miscast 
but still able to give a pretty fair performance.</P>
<P>You'd think four writers and a novelist would be able to think of something 
resembling an original death scene. Instead we get situations like this 
(warning, minor spoiler): guy goes down to cellar to light pilot light. He 
can't get it lit, and we know the killer is down there. What follows is 
about three minutes of this fool trying to light one match without blowing 
it out while the soundtrack implies a creeping terror is right behind him. 
Then... just when he gets it lit.. the killer hits him in the back with an 
axe and leaves. That's it. Gee guys, how much time did you spend thinking 
that one up? I wish I could say there was one death scene which stands out, 
but they all meld together in one mesh of stupidity. We're treated with four 
or five of these frankly lame murder scenes before the whole thing comes 
together in an ending which is likely to leave you scratching your head for 
about five or ten minutes before you decide you just don't care. Don't 
bother trying to figure out who the killer is, the writers are gracious 
enough to make this more than a little obvious for the mystery impaired.</P>
<P>Being the nice guy I am, I feel compelled to point out the film's 
highpoints, few and far between though they may be. There's a vaguely 
amusing scene between Dorothy and her new step-mother (who it turns out is 
about Dorothy's age); there's a funny little line where Kate, referring to 
Adam, says "Sure, he's no Angel."; and granted, some people will no doubt 
enjoy the death scenes for no other reason than that someone dies in them. 
Otherwise, the film is bland, boring, pointless, and the definition of 
everything I've come to expect from modern Hollywood horror writers. If you 
loved the intellectual challenge of such films as <i>Urban Legend</i> and 
<i>I Know What You Did Last Summer</i> you'll no doubt get a kick out of 
this one, no matter what I might say to try and discourage you. Always 
worthy of mention in a slasher flick is the score, which in this case 
consists of little more than that foolish "Ka-drum!" sound whenever the 
audience is supposed to be startled by something like a person walking 
suddenly in front of the camera. <i>Valentine</i> runs an irritating 96 
minutes. I'd recommend the film to those who, for reasons I will never fully 
comprehend, enjoyed last fall's god awful <i>Urban Legends: Final Cut<i>, 
and give the film a slightly generous two and a half out of five stars.</P>
