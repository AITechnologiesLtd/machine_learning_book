Reviewed March 13, 1999.
One of the things I noticed most while watching acclaimed-director James 
Foley's ("At Close Range," "Glengarry Glen Ross," "Fear") first foray 
into the action genre, "The Corruptor," is that there were a lot of 
subtle signs of disappearances throughout, most notably filmmaking 
skill, intelligence, and even one of the fundamental things you need to 
survive: a brain. Chinese action star Chow Yun-Fat made his U.S. film 
debut last year in "The Replacement Killers," and although no award 
winner, at least it contained style and the much-needed appearance of 
the wonderful actress Mira Sorvino. Unfortunately, the style of the 
former film is replaced in "The Corruptor" with generic, deadeningly 
boring shoot-outs, and in place of Sorvino is the less-talented Mark 
Wahlberg who, like everyone else, sleepwalks through his role. 
Wahlberg stars as Danny Wallace, a young, caucasian cop who is partnered 
with Nick Chen (Yun-Fat), a detective in the 15th Precinct's Asian Gang 
Unit, to stop a gang war in Chinatown between the Fukienese Dragons, and 
the Tongs, led by Henry Lee (Ric Young). Wallace and Chen are basically 
the polar opposites of each other (aren't they always?), but gradually 
become good friends (don't they always?).
And that's it. That's the highly "intricate" story of "The Corruptor," 
which could have saved a lot of people the time and money if the 
filmmakers had realized this exact same premise has been done so many 
times before, and better, that it was pointless to make it again. To pad 
out the excruciatingly long 111-minute running time for such a one-note 
film, screenwriter Robert Pucci (who doesn't deserve to work in Holywood 
ever again) has opted to include a smattering of one-dimensional, 
cliched sub-plots, including one involving Wallace's money-grubbing 
father (Brian Cox), and another in which the two central characters' 
identities come into question. Although I had to dig pretty hard for 
this compliment, there is one (but only one) element that I felt had 
potential, and that was the relationship between Chen and a sweet 
prostitute named May (Maria Mitiko) whom he wants to get out of danger. 
Of course, this chance of adequacy was stripped to the bare minimum of 
involvement and development, and Mitiko, a promising new face, showed a 
lot of potential in a five-minute role (if that).
Aside from that ridiculously small distraction, "The Corruptor" really 
is a brain-dead action movie of the worst type, one without thought or 
excitement. All of the characters were thoroughly unlikable and 
uninteresting, and so when the main characters' lives were put into 
danger, I found myself wondering why director Foley would think that we, 
the audience, would even remotely care about what was happening. There's 
no time to get acquainted with anyone and no apparent screenplay to help 
us in even trying to. Like most of the recent reprehensible Jean-Claude 
Van Damme and Steven Seagal movies, "The Corruptor" is constantly on 
auto-pilot from anything resembling believability or originality, and so 
far Yun Fat has not in any way impressed me with his action star status. 
Although not a fan of Jackie Chan, at least you can always see that he 
is giving his own 200% in everything he does.
One of the most annoying elements of "The Corruptor" is in the 
stereotypical way that the villains are presented. Not only are we not 
given the chance to know the villains by name, but I was never really 
sure exactly what their goal was, except that there was an on-going war 
between the two gangs. At any rate, by the half-hour mark, I had already 
begun to understand the manner in which they were treated. It never 
failed: in every single scene in which the "bad guys" appeared, a 
repetitive, loud rap song would burst onto the soundtrack; I guess that 
was Foley's way of introducing them. Bad Guy = rap music. Okay, got it. 
If anything, this is the first movie I can remember seeing in which one 
of the baddies points a gun at a man, to which the targetted man 
responds, "no, hold on," and pulls out his own gun and shoots himself in 
the head!
As for the supposedly shocking twist during the climax, my b.s. detector 
was sounding off like a steam engine. This same "twist" is now being 
recycled over and over in every other action/cop movie nowadays, and so 
there's no use in hiding the secret. Suffice to say, either Chen or 
Wallace isn't who he says he is, and their newfound buddy-buddy 
relationship suddenly is put at stake. 
"The Corruptor" is a film that is so constantly struggling for ideas 
that it really is quite amusing when you think about it. Here we have 
director James Foley, a man who has made good films in the past, paired 
with Chow Yun-Fat and Mark Wahlberg (so very good in "Boogie Nights"), 
who most likely wasted at least a year of his life bringing this 
no-brainer to the screen. Someone should have really spoken up during 
the pre-production stage and broken the news that this was not a movie 
that was exactly begging to be made. With all of the rainforests being 
torn down and people dying of hunger in the world, it boggles the mind 
at why New Line Cinemas actually had the nerve to waste millions of 
dollars on a piece of wretched trash like this.</P>
