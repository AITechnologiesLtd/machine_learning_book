<P>So many students strive to get into schools such as Harvard of Princeton, but
they just don't get the good grades.  So many students would do ANYTHING to
reach their goal of getting into this schools.  Legend has it that if your
roommate commits suicide, the remaining roommates will get an automatic 4.0. 
Chris (Michael Vartan) and Tim (Matthew Lillard) are two guys who really want
the 4.0 to get into Harvard.  How far will they go to get their 4.0?</P>
<P>Chris and Tim are also roommates with Rand, played by Randall Batinkoff.  The
two scheme to murder Rand, make it look like a suicide, so they can supposedly
get their 4.0.  They have heard this rumor many places, and they are willing to
take the chance to find out.  Rand is a very, very mean person.  He treats his
girlfriend Natalie, played by Tamara Craig Thomas, like she doesn't matter at
all.  She is very afraid of him, and she especially afraid now that she must
tell him she is pregnant.  She does tell him, and he becomes enraged.  That
night would be the last night of Rand's life.  Tim and Chris give Rand a bottle
of rat poison, making him think that it is beer.  Rand drinks down the poison,
and then dies.  Now, Tim pushes him off of a mountain with a suicide note near
the site to make it look like he killed himself.</P>
<P>It does not take long until the suicide note is found, but the body isn't
found.  The police question Chris and Tim about Rand to try and find any
information.  Feeling extreme guilt, Chris is having a very hard time,
especially with his girlfriend, Emma, played by Keri Russell.  She wants to
know more, but he will not even speak with her.  Will he give in?  Will Tim
turn Chris in?  Will Chris turn Tim in?  Will they turn themselves in?  All of
these questions were running through my mind while watching this slick suspense
film.</P>
<P>The events in The Curve are very surprising, original, and fun.  The plot
sounds much like Dead Man on Campus, but that is not the deal with this film. 
This film is a very serious one, with not many laughs.  There are many twists
and turns that make this film different from most films.  The ending in
particular is completely unpredictable and satisfying.  It is a terrific,
suspenseful ending that I could never predict would happen.  Hands down to Dan
Rosen who wrote this wild ride.  The sound really stood out in the film.  It is
quite eerie and it really adds to the feel of the film.  The way the movie is
filmed is also great.  All of the technical aspects, as well as the acting and
directing aspects are very well done. </P>
<P>The performances in The Curve are very good.  Matthew Lillard gets to play
another creepy role, just like in 1996's Scream. (A+) He is very strange in
this film as well.  I like him in this sort of role, rather than the roles he
has been playing in comedies such as Senseless and She's All That.  Michael
Vartan is fantastic as Chris, who has extremely mixed emotions about the entire
murder and the 4.0.  Michael Vartan was also superb in Never Been Kissed, where
he co-starred with Drew Barrymore as a teacher who fell in love with his
student.  Keri Russell also gives a great performance.  She should be a good
actress in the horror department of the film.  Tamara Craig Thomas is also
realistic, especially coping with the death of her boyfriend.  Some very strong
supporting performances came from smaller roles, such as Bo Dietl and Anthony
Griffith who play two detectives investigating the case.</P>
<P>The Bottom Line- I might just have to curve that A- into an A.</P>
<P>*Note- The Curve premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in early 1998.  It was
decided the film would not be released widely.  It is now available at
Blockbuster Video only, and for rent only.  See you at the video store!   </P>
