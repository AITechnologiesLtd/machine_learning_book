<P>        A twice divorced, unemployed mother of three young children,
Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) struggles to be taken seriously.  But
when she lands a job as a secretary in the small law firm run by Ed
Masry (Oscar winning veteran Albert Finney) she eventually gains
respect as the key player in a multi- million dollar law suit against
a giant energy corporation.</P>
<P>Masry has been in the business for years and thinks he has
earned a little bit of peace and quiet.  He has become a little set in
his ways after years of dealing with civil matters and trivial
litigation.  But even he finds himself actively involved when Erin
discovers that a power company has, for several decades, been
polluting the water supply of a small town and lying about it.  Erin
investigates why real estate records for the sale of houses within the
town also contain private medical records.  Eventually she rallies the
townsfolk together in a frustrating effort to sue the power company.</P>
<P>It is a David versus Goliath like struggle in which the
underdog eventually triumphs.  Victory also enables Erin to break away
from that stereotype in which most people have neatly pigeon holed her
for so long.  Erin Brockovich is based on a true story, and although
it takes a few liberties along the way, it is, for the most part, an
involving tale.</P>
<P>Steven Soderbergh's direction is a tad manipulative, as he
takes great pains to make us feel sympathy for the small town victims
of the faceless corporation's greed.
 There are few subtleties to be 
found in this film, as Soderbergh (the superb crime film Out Of Sight, 
etc) tends to paint everything in 
broad strokes.  But the script, from Susannah Grant (Ever After, etc) and 
Soderbergh, contains plenty of 
winning humour and is not without its charms.  </P>
<P>When the film explores Erin's troubled and unconventional
personal life it becomes bogged down and occasionally repetitive, and
many within the audience will become restless during these scenes.
However, while depicting Erin's tenacious paper chase through the
daunting amount of documents and legal technicalities and her patient
attempts at gathering evidence, the film works a treat.</P>
<P>Like a few other recent films based on true stories about an
unlikely triumph against the odds (The Insider, The Hurricane, etc),
Erin Brockovich becomes a compelling and inspiring drama that should
please audiences.  Like its appealing heroine, Erin Brockovich should
also effectively change a few misconceptions about Roberts' abilities.</P>
<P>Comfortable with roles in lightweight romantic comedies,
Roberts has sometimes struggled with the demands of portraying more
dramatic characters.  However, she finds a role that perfectly suits
her here, and delivers one of her best performances for quite some
time.  She delivers a warts and all characterisation of a woman
unafraid to speak her mind and exploit of her sexuality in getting
what she wants.  Her well rounded and complex performance captures
Erin's prickly nature, her hidden strengths, her driven nature, yet
also hints at the vulnerability and insecurity that lies just below
the surface.</P>
<P>Finney is also superb as her initially blustering boss, who
originally underestimates his unusual new employee, but gradually
grows to admire and respect Erin's ability.  Aaron Eckhart (In The
Company Of Men, etc) makes the most of the lesser developed role of
George, the bikie who befriends Erin and her kids, but is driven away
by his own inability to cope with her growing sense of confidence and
assurance.  The real Erin Brockovich contributes a brief cameo as a
waitress in a restaurant early in the movie.</P>
