# [film] "Dark City"
A Postview, copyright 1998 p-m agapow</PRE>
<P>In grand pulp tradition, a man (Sewell) wakes up amnesiac in a hotel 
room with a dead woman.  Terrified he flees into the shadowy city, 
pursued by a puzzled cop (Hurt), his supposed wife (Connelly) and a 
group of mysterious figures cloaked in black, none of whom have 
Australian accents.  There's a deranged doctor (Sutherland) in there 
too.</P>
<P>The pursued amnesiac murderer is an oldie but a goodie, a hook around 
which one could build a tight and twisty plot.  But that's not what 
happens here.  The most mysterious thing about "Dark City", is why the 
plot starts shrouded in such mystery and then so easily gives up its 
secrets to lumber into a comic book action plot.  Was this intentional 
or has the writer and director (Alex "The Crow" Proyas) misjudged his 
audience?  I suspect the second, but let's look at the good things 
first.  (As always with mystery films, one must speak elliptically on 
certain plot points so as to preserve the surprise for viewers - even 
if the filmmakers don't find the surprise useful.)</P>
<P>>From the opening scenes, Proyas' visual style draws you in.  Our hero 
awakes in a bathtub, the camera drinking in a lazily swinging naked 
lightbulb, a syringe loose on an intricately tiled floor, a bundle of 
clothes folded loosely on a chair.  Later, we move through the 
Escher-like streets of the city to where a singer sways slowly in 
front of a microphone as her band plays in the darkness just outside 
the spotlight.  The dark city itself is a kind of painting, a 
composition carefully constructed for each shot.  Indeed, the actors 
do not so much move through each scene as just stand carefully within 
them.  Movement would disrupt the careful placement and so characters 
are more part of the scenery than part of the plot.</P>
<P>Although this objectifying of the cast is often bad, within "Dark 
City" it works.  William Hurt as the laconic police lieutenant is 
playing little more than a cliche, but this cliche belongs here and is 
done very well.  Likewise, Jennifer Connelly's role could best be 
described as "The Girl" and wouldn't go astray in dozens of other 
movies.  Nor does it go astray here.  Kiefer Sutherland, who was 
nearly due for lifetime membership in the Bad Movie Actors Guild 
(whether you read it as "BAD movie ACTORS" or "BAD MOVIE actors") here 
turns a surprisingly good job as the oddly pathetic collaborator Dr 
Schreber, struggling pathetically against his controllers.</P>
<P>But this returns us to the plot.  The sad fact is that the mystery is 
all but over 40 minutes into the film, leaving nothing but the visual 
style.  After the teasing open scene, the director is in a tearing 
hurry to explain it all to us, with a disastrous opening monologue 
which all but tells you what's going on.  (Even one of the poster 
blurbs gives the secret away.)  So by the halfway mark, the battle 
lines are drawn and all that remains is for our hero to go mano a mano 
with the bad guys.  And you don't seriously think that he's going to 
lose, do you?  This is mighty little to hang the rest of the film on.  
Actually it's surprising that Dark City works as well as it does given 
that thinness of its plot.  Some viewers might complain that "Dark 
City" is illogical.  Given the immense levels of technology and powers 
dealt with, it's more "a-logical".  Anything could happen.  It's more 
fantasy than science-fiction.  This tends to underline the 
arbitrariness and lack of mystery.</P>
<P>"Dark City" is thus a bit of a mixed bag, the product of a single 
person's vision that perhaps needed some tempering by an outside point 
of view to bring it to full fruition.  However, just on the basis of 
the first half and visuals I'd rate it [***/interesting] and Peter 
Greenaway on the Sid and Nancy scale.</P>
