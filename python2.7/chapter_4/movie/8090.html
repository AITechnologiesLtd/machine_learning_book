Batman & Robin (1997)</PRE>
<P>Well, what everyone has had to say about this movie, and
about all the movies that have come before this one in the series, is all
true. The villains are more interesting than the heroes. Even the sets and
the costumes and the gadgetry are more interesting than the actors. But,
there is no stopping the moneymaking machine of the 1990s--the <B><I>Batman</I></B>
series.</P>
<P>Everything you need to know about the movie are easily
seen in the movie's subway posters--the heroes are Batman, Robin, and Batgirl,
and the villains are Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy. As in the other three installments
of this series, the villains are much more interesting than the heroes.
Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger, who gets top billing) is grieving for
his terminally ill and cryogenically preserved wife, who has some disease
he is trying to cure. Meanwhile, he is stealing diamonds to power the suit
that keeps him at a requisite freezing temperature, and that power his freezing
machines.</P>
<P>Across town, dowdy Dr. Pamela Isley falls into a pit of
botanical toxins and becomes Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman), who uses pheromone
dust to entrance men and get them to fight over her. Both Thurman and Schwarzenegger
are entertaining, and are the main show, as far as I'm concerned. The characters
are written quite shallow, and spend far too much dialog on idiotic sexual
innuendo than anything else.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, at stately Wayne Manor, there is trouble. Bruce Wayne/Batman
(George Clooney) is having trouble getting ward Dick Grayson/Robin (Chris
O'Donnell) to reign in his teenage hormones and stop taking so many risks.
Faithful Butler Alfred (Michael Gough) is dying, and his niece Barbara
Wilson/Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone) has popped in for a visit by day, and
borrows motorcycles at night to go hellraising and drag racing. All of
this is basically a lot of noise signifying ...? Nothing. </P>
<P>George Clooney is the third Batman and is supposed to be
a kinder, gentler Batman. Less brooding, but just as uninteresting as Michael
Keaton and Val Kilmer were in the title role. The movies are quickly approaching
the same level of silliness the television series displayed. (Viveca Fox
plays &quot;Ms. B. Haven&quot;--har har.) Again, the sets are marvelous
and moody and evoke silent screen classics like Fritz Lang's <B><I>Metropolis</I></B>.
But, after spending about $40 in eight years, enough is enough already.
This latest installment is just a lot of chase scenes set on a gargantuan
metropolitan set with outrageous villains and uninteresting heroes. Robin's
teen tantrums left me uninterested, and we don't see nearly enough of Alicia
Silverstone as Batgirl. Perhaps in the next chapter, which is supposed to
feature &quot;The Joker's Wife&quot; and actresses are lining up already
to win the role...</P>
