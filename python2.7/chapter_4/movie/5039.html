<P>     Is forced hilarity hilarious?  That's the question to ponder while
watching (enduring?) this edgy romantic comedy from SPANKING THE MONKEY
director David O. Russell.  Nothing is particularly relaxed (or sacred)
about this story of a young married man (Ben Stiller) who drags his wife
(Patricia Arquette), his baby, and his adoption- agency contact (Tea
Leoni) on a cross-country search for his biological parents.  The
dialogue, the characters, even the camera work itself is frantic.  Too
frantic.  The humor, like everything else about the movie, ends up
feeling forced.  Sure, the presence of such seasoned supporting players
as Mary Tyler Moore and George Segal (and Lily Tomlin and Alan Alda) is
nice.  As is the film's very frank sense of sexuality.  (The subject of
fellatio is, ah, a running gag.) Most of it, though, just isn't very
funny.  FLIRTING WITH DISASTER, *indeed*. </P>
