<P>A woman serial killer thriller? Sure sounds interesting on paper, doesn't
it? Ashley Judd as the sexy, noir lead, prancing around in all her goodies,
with "nice guy" detective Ewan McGregor fast on her tail. Toss in ex-90210
staple Jason Priestley in a role which was given to my good friend "The
Arrow" before the Priest got the gig, playing a smelly psycho with a bad
attitude, and it seems as though all systems were ready to go. But then
again, I guess quality is all in the eye of the beholder, isn't it?
Hehehe...</P>
<P>PLOT:
A sultry woman with a dark past is tailed by a British Intelligence agent
who can't get over the loss of his daughter, and suddenly finds himself
obsessed with his investigative subject. And while the path of her murders
begins to cover several cities, the man's obsession with the mysterious lady
starts to take over his entire life.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Ashley Judd is one purty lady with some significant talent as an actress and
sexy seductress, but this movie bites as a whole. Few thrills, even less
action, a loud soundtrack and over-the-top symbolism don't make up for the
fact that the script has very little substance or anything interesting and
new to say. Thankfully, I am a fan of style and this film has got plenty to
spare. It's also got a pretentious air which prevents it from becoming
anything more than a second-rate surreal "thriller" with some solid
performances from the leads, decent locale shots and a bogus ending. Did I
believe or buy into any of the simplistic motivations that the characters
expressed as their raison-d'etre in this film? Absolutely not! And having
Ewan's lost daughter float in and out of scenes as a reminder of why he is
the way he is, wasn't exactly subtle or entertaining. Now does Ashley Judd
"work" as a jet-setting femme fatale with a propensity for the ol'
knife-in-the-back scenario? Absolutely, in fact, she's one of the strongest
points in this muddled movie, which expects you to tag along with some guy
who becomes obsessed with a serial killer, and then care about what happens
to either one of them!</P>
<P>Problem with films like this is that despite their many bad points,
including plot holes which just seemed to make matters worse, they do
sometimes contain serviceable qualities. Which is why I never tend to favor
the inclusion of many 0/10's in my reviews. Much like the philosophy in my
real life, I like to judge all films according to the merits of its final
product, but not without acknowledging the separate parts that go into
creating that compilation. In other words, I try to see some good in
everything, and despite not enjoying this movie as a whole, I liked some of
the camera-work, truly enjoyed Jason Priestley's spirited cameo, was never
really bored and definitely toss kudos the way of Judd and McGregor. Does
the ending suck? Yes. Does the movie try too hard to be cool, dark, sexy and
deep without having much to say? You bet. All in all, I would say that this
cinematic mess is a nice try, but no cigar. See it for Judd, her sexy
character, McGregor playing the shy guy, the shot of Judd's boobies, or K.D.
Land trying to act. But don't see it if you're looking for a deep character
study or thrills, cause the only reason you'd find yourself at the edge of
your seat in this flick, is to beat a hasty retreat to the exits.</P>
