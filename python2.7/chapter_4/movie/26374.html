<P>Have you ever wanted to be someone else? How about..John Malcovich?
Well, maybe you can…</P>
<P>Original. If I would choose one word to describe this film, I would
choose this one. I can guarantee you that you have never seen anything
like that before. Forget formulas, physics and scientific
discoveries. The world is not what it seems!</P>
<P>Craig (John Cusack) is a talented puppeteer, whose ingenious art is
uninteresting in the modern world. He lives in a small apartment with
his wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz), whose passion for animals invaded the
house. Unappreciated and ignored, Craig decides to switch professions
to make a living. He is then given the opportunity to work as a file
clerk in a Manhattan building. It should also be explained that the
floor of his office building is 7 1/2 . Squeezed in between the
seventh and eighth floors, it's only about 5 feet high, which means
everybody walks around stooped. This adds to the comic weirdness and
the disorientation that are the film's motor.  What follows is one of
film's trippiest pieces of surrealism. Once there, he discovers a
portal that literally sucks him into the mind of John Malkovich. For
brief, virtual-celebrity bursts, he takes in the universe through the
actor's eyes but only for 15 minutes, and then, for some reason, he
gets spit out onto the New Jersey Turnpike. Experience over. But these
15 minutes of borrowed celebrity are about to change his life,
especially when he finds he can repeat it at will by reentering the
portal. What clinches the arc of change is Craig sharing his discovery
with two women - his wife, and Maxine (Catherine Keener), who works in
an office down the hall and has caught Craig's eye. This unexpected
discovery gives them many interesting opportunities. When Maxine hears
about the portal, she manipulates Craig, using his feelings for her to
earn some money by selling trips into John Malkovich's head. In no
time, there's a never ending line of people who, unsure they'll ever
get their own 15 minutes of fame, are eager to pay to get inside
Malkovich...</P>
<P>And then of course the obvious question: Why Malcovich? Perhaps
because Malcovich is exactly that - a symbol of the American dream. A
common man that has made it to the top and thus stands for everything
that modern society requires - glamour, fame, money and automatically
happiness. But it doesn't really matter why exactly Malcovich. We're
all dying to be someone else.</P>
<P>Charlie Kaufman's screenplay is incredibly funny, a sort of modern
visualization of 'Alice in Wonderland' , cheerfully presenting the
universe as God's own pinball machine. But it is also filled with
global questions and heavy philosophy. Several very serious and
frightening themes are posed. Kaufman takes some satirical whacks at
celebrity worship and New Age self-absorption -- "Don't stand in the
way of my self-actualization as a man," Lotte tells Craig. A strange,
paranoiac reaction which occurred to Craig's wife after entering
Malcovich, pretty much the same experience as looking into multiple
mirrors. The film has layer upon layer of things to say about
identity, image, the cult of celebrity, appearance vs. reality, modes
of communication, mass entertainment, contemporary values,
manipulation and even the quest for eternal life. And love as a form
of insanity. It is a frightening tale about the loss of identity, as a
sacrifice to the American dream. We live in a world where everyone
struggle to become the ones that our society idolizes, downplaying the
individuality, until it completely disappears. A society where who you
are is never good enough, and you simply have to be someone else. The
obvious question is of course whether it make your life any
better. According to society it should. But will it?</P>
<P>John Cusack must certainly be one of the greatest actors of his
generation and Cameron Diaz is a funny choice as the sweet, but
physically unattractive Lotte. Cast against type in a completely
different and strange role, Diaz simply shines. Catherine Keener is
likewise a bold and successful choice, looking incredibly right for
the part. Yet, and I know that it sounds strange; it is John Malcovich
who is the star of this film. Playing with a sense of self-parody,
Malcovich portrays a version of John Malcovich that we all probably
imagine, a certain stereotype of a celebrity's life. There is no real
John Malcovich. He is just a vessel, a suit, a mask that anybody can
put on. For Malcovich as an actor this means that he has to copy the
other actors' interpretation of their characters. It seems so easy and
so believable that you never doubt the strange events unfolding before
your eyes. It is a completely different illustration, that makes an
incredible impact on the mind and soul. First-time director Spike
Jonze presents this absurd material in a muted, naturalistic visual
style - unhurried. And the idea of changing bodies becomes as common
as breathing. Look for several amusing cameo roles, such as Charlie
Sheen and Brad Pitt. The film is a hilarious comedy, a demanding
drama, a terrible tragedy. A philosophic, frighteningly prophetic
tale, a dark parody on society, a meditation on human nature. A film
that seems completely against the classic Hollywood entertainment
style and above the familiar 'copy-and-paste' traditions. In simple
words: this is by far one of the greatest achievements of the year and
one of the most original films of this decade.</P>
