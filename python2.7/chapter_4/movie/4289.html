<P>     James Bond is back, thought not exactly as we remember him.  Sure,
the girls and gadgets are all there.  As are the pithy one-liners and
the over-the-top stunts.  Check.  What's missing is the level of
technical polish that has best-characterized the 31-year-old series.
Thrilling, but tiring; Bonded, but bloated, GOLDENEYE is only a
half-success.  (Half shaken, not stirred?) Director Martin Campbell
(CRIMINAL LAW, NO ESCAPE) has loaded the post-Cold War story with
*plenty* of delightful bits, ranging from Bond's sexy showdown in a
St.  Petersburg steambath, to a tank/car chase through those same
Soviet streets.  (The plot involves quite a bit of vehicular traffic,
actually.  Even the old Aston Martin makes an appearance!)</P>
<P>     The problem is that these scenes, the best scenes, never gel into
a cohesive whole.  GOLDENEYE is an exciting, episodic film that lacks a
singular vision.  For that reason, it's difficult to properly gauge
Pierce Brosnan's performance as Ian Fleming's master spy.  He seems to
have more verve than his most-recent predecessor, Timothy Dalton, but
the overstuffed story never gives the actor any room to breathe.  It's
fight, dash, scowl, kiss, repeat.  Over and over and over again.</P>
<P>     Too much action is only one of the problems in GOLDENEYE.  The
absurd opening--involving, among other things, the bungee jump shown
in the trailer--sets the precedent that nothing in the story shall be
taken seriously.  Nothing new there.  The trouble comes when Campbell
tries to insert real drama into this classy, cartoon reality.  It
doesn't work.  Equally uncomfortable is the amount of graphic violence
that we're shown.  Bond is quite the indiscriminate killer in this one,
and that harder edge isn't effectively balanced by the bigger, sillier
stunts.</P>
<P>     Other problems include Derek Meddings' too-obvious miniatures, a
boring score from Eric Serra, and a wandering POV that strays too far
away from our favorite secret agent.  The laughs are there, though,
thank God, and the supporting cast is impeccable.  Some of the surprise
scene-stealers include Jon Don Baker, as Bond's cranky American
contact, Robbie Coltrane (!), as an ex-KGB heavy, and Famke Janssen, as
the Russian villianess with killer thighs.  Literally.  Peter Lamont's
production design is also very good.  The best visual metaphor of the
year may just be Bond's nighttime meeting in eerie junkyard
(graveyard?) of fallen Russian monuments.  Startling.</P>
<P>BOTTOM LINE:  For the Bond franchise, and for Brosnan, it's a start.  </P>
