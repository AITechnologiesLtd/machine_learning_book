<PRE>"Lethal Weapon" Packs Lots of Fire Power
by Homer Yen
(c) 1998</PRE>
<P>Just how inseparable is the team of Sgt. Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and
Sgt. Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover)?  Let's just say that when one
partner asks the other partner to strip to his boxer shorts and then
further asks him to run out into the middle of the road, flapping his
arms while feverishly cackling like a chicken just to create a
distraction, his partner actually does it!</P>
<P>The familiar Lethal Weapon family is back, including Rene Russo, who is
now the expectant mother of Riggs' child and Joe Pesci as the
soprana-like, foul-mouthed former accountant who has decided to become a
private eye.  New to the team is Chris Rock, also a fast-talking, up and
coming detective.  Trouble seems to follow the two veteran detectives
where ever they go, and in this film, that is no exception.  Even when
they are just taking a leisurely boat ride, they somehow manage to
collide with a freighter ship.  We here some ominous music, which clues
us that a confrontation is about to happen.  Gunfire ensues, and when
it's all over, the detectives want to learn more about this freighter by
questioning a Chinatown crime lord.  </P>
<P>Although they don't know what they're looking for, their inquisitiveness
causes the bad guys to take some action.  And there's plenty of action
here for two movies.  Led by fighting sensation Jet Li, whose martial
arts skill is nothing less than impressive, he does what he can to make
sure that no one finds out what they are up to.  Li is ruthless in his
approach, will kill anyone just to make a point, and develops enormous
disdain for the two detectives.</P>
<P>There are terrific car chases, explosions and gunshot galore.  It's a
summer action recipe followed to the letter, and the result is nothing
less than pure, unadulterated summer fun.  But even too many explosions
can get boring.  To counter that, we are treated to several amazingly
choreographed fight sequences with Jet Li.  Luckily, he'd rather fight
hand-to-hand instead of firing off guns.  Meanwhile, when the detectives
aren't reloading their guns or running from fireballs, they're engaged
in sophomoric banter and silly conversations that provide a nice
diversion from the hail of bullets.  Everybody gets in on the shtick.
Russo screams during her delivery, the crime lord has a few funny bits
when he's being interrogated while being given laughing gas, and Pesci
and Rock are very funny as they go at it discussing the drawbacks of
having cellular phones.  Gibson and Glover are always in sync and the
film moves at a brisk pace to get to the final and terrific mano a mano.
Score one for the Old Guard.</P>
