<P>"I'm in the mood for love/ simply because you're near me/ funny, but 
when you're near me/ I'm in the mood for love."</P>
<P>Earlier generations certainly know this famous Dorothy Fields/ Jimmy 
McHugh song,  launched when Frances Langford sang it in her feature 
debut "Every Night at Eight" (1935) --which is about a musical trio ( 
Alice Faye, Patsy Kelly and Langford) singing at a radio station. It 
became a staple in World War II when diminutive Frances, a major 
fixture of Bob Hope's USO show, warbled it to the military all over 
the map.</P>
<P>Cleverly, while the movie has many tunes, it uses only the title and 
not the song itself. It was chosen late in the film's development. 
 From its initial idea to the end of production, In the Mood for Love 
underwent many metamorphoses and its making was interrupted several 
times (with a gap of almost a year).  Among the reasons for this: the 
Asian financial crisis; the almost simultaneous filming of another 
feature (the futuristic "2046"); the fact that the two pictures had 
some mutually influencing elements which resulted in a kind of ping 
pong of changes; director Wong Kar-wei's constant re-thinking the 
film; and last but not least, his working without a script.</P>
<P>  In 1962 the British crown colony of Hong Kong was 35 years away from 
reverting to China. Around that time there was a major influx of 
people from mainland China, notably Shanghai. It put a huge strain on 
housing the newcomers.</P>
<P>The movie opens with Mr.Chow renting a room for himself and his wife 
in a cheerful, crowded and dilapidated house. At the same time, 
Mrs.Su does the same for herself and her husband. The new tenants 
have adjoining rooms. We do not see their spouses, who both 
incessantly take business trips. The movie spells out few facts, so 
that the audience has to be on its toes and infer a great deal.</P>
<P>The beautiful Mrs. Su wears a succession of gorgeous dresses, 
craftily color-coded. Handsome Mr. Chow is elegant in his many 
changes of impeccable suits. When I first saw the movie there were 
raised eyebrows about the contrast between chic apparel and shabby 
dwellings, but this is explained by Hong Kong's huge housing shortage 
in the early 60s.</P>
<P>It is inevitable that during the absence of their peripatetic mates, 
Su and Chow will meet, chat in restaurants or noodle  shops 
(noodlerias?), feel mutual attraction. Su works in the office of 
businessman Mr. Ho as his secretary as well as  something like a 
general manager. (We only see briefly just one other employee, an 
errand boy). I repeat, the movie skimps on traditional orientations 
and explanations in favor of its overwhelming subject, "A Man and a 
Woman."</P>
<P>Mr. Ho has a wife and a mistress. Su is not only aware of this but 
imperturbably sets up appointments for Ho and the younger woman, 
covers for him, and has her husband bring back from his trips abroad 
duplicate gifts for Ho's two ladies.</P>
<P>Chow is a journalist. The film's minimal information and parsimonious 
clues reveal this to us slowly. Only much later do we learn that Chow 
is a newspaper's editor.</P>
<P>Over a restaurant the new twosome realize that his wife and her 
husband are lovers. In most scenarios this would give our couple 
carte blanche for carnal knowledge, but here neither the man nor the 
woman "wants to be like them." So the movie intensifies its ballet of 
hesitancies. That's the film's core. It is done with sympathy, 
exemplary delicacy and discretion and underplayed micro-changes. The 
principals meet and meet and meet while repeating "we should not be 
seen together."</P>
<P>This unusual love story goes hand in hand with the acute estheticism 
of its director and its ace cinematographers. Comings and goings, in 
contrast to the protagonists' sartorial elegance, are set in often 
chiaroscuro interiors, in narrow streets with picturesque rain, with 
a stress on walls that have the beauty of decay. The cautious 
symbolism here is reinforced by the soundtrack. Nat King Cole is 
heard doing a number of Latin versions of familiar love songs. (His 
Spanish is fine, a tad Argentinean.  Clue: he says Jo for Yo). There 
are other songs, as well as a too repetitious theme for meowing 
strings.</P>
<P>The terms "Mood" and "Love" are in this work's bloodstream. They are 
expressed without the need for running dialogue. Understatement is 
the order of the day along with major pauses and silences. The 
director made many cuts in the original footage shot, so as to weed 
out and "purify" the movie. This is minimalism as well as an unusual 
form of film asceticism that recalls the strategies of some great 
filmmakers, such as Ozu and Robert Bresson.</P>
<P>At age 5,  Wong Kar-wei had moved with his parents from Shanghai to 
Hong-Kong. The recreation of the times is both economical and 
precise. As the old houses exist no longer, the shooting was mostly 
done in Bangkok.</P>
<P>The director says that he was influenced by Jean-Luc Godard and the 
French New Wave of the 60s. (But certainly not by the anything goes, 
hippie 60s in the USA as well as Europe). Among his Godardian 
techniques is the avoidance of shot -reverse shot in conversations; 
not always showing one of the interlocutors; platitudes spoken by 
some older people; the absence of a script. But contrary to Godard, 
this bittersweet story never ventures outside its one and only 
subject, does not go from the inner self to the outside, but instead 
keeps the camera rock-steady to lead us from out to in, from the 
images to the soul of the characters.</P>
<P>Is this an Asian "Brief Encounter?"  Is there closure? I won't let 
the cat out of the bag.</P>
<P>The actors are perfect. Maggie Chung's and Tony Leung's careers began 
in the early 1980s. They are mega-stars in Asia, and have made a huge 
number of films. (Ms. Chung did 12 features in 1988!) "In the Mood" 
is their fifth feature directed  by  Wong Kar-wei.</P>
<P>At the Cannes Film Festival (2000) Tony Leung won for Best Actor. The 
two cinematographers and the production designer were awarded the 
Grand Technical Prize.</P>
