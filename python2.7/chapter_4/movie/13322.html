<P>     In contemporary popular art, there's a very fine line between sheer
brilliance and head-smacking pretentiousness.  It's a line most visionary
film directors flirt with on a regular basis, to the point of tying said
line into the occasional sheepshank knots.  It almost seems as though, for
all their periodic misfires, film-makers like David Lynch, Terry Gilliam
and Stanley Kubrick have no choice but to take you places no one else can
or will take you.  Every true film lover relishes the moment of discovery
when a film suggests the emergence of a challenging new voice.  You
suspect that even though the film you are watching may not be great, the
creative mind behind it could be.</P>
<P>     Darren Aronofsky's debut feature PI may not be a work of pure
originality -- the echoes of Lynch's ERASERHEAD are too distinct -- but I
can virtually guarantee you won't see anything else like it this year.
The subject, amazingly enough, is theoretical mathematics, centering on a
reclusive math savant named Max Cohen (Sean Gullette).  Max lives in a New
York apartment on the verge of swallowing him whole, a jungle of wiring
and circuitry powering his supercomputer Euclid.  His obsessive goal is
proving that there is a mathematical pattern in every complex system, a
theory he tests by attempting to develop a perfect method for predicting
the behavior of the stock market.  Euclid responds to Max's programming by
spitting out a 216-digit number, a number Max initially believes to be
useless.  That's before his mentor (Mark Margolis) drops oblique hints as
to the number's relevance, before a Hassidic scholar (Mark Margolis)
suggests that the number is the key to understanding the mind of God, and
before a group of homicidal stock brokers seem prepared to do anything it
takes to get their hands on the number.</P>
<P>     At its core, PI is an Icarus fable of a man reaching for knowledge
beyond his capacity to handle it, with a side order of cyber-era isolation
cautionary tale.  Aronofsky uses voice-over narration effectively to get
us inside Max's seizure-wracked head (with superb musical assistance from
Clint Mansell of Pop Will Eat Itself), showing us the world as an
actualized paranoid fantasy viewed through a self-imposed cage of
computers.  PI might have been a frighteningly engrossing character study
if only Sean Gullette had been able to match the intensity of the
material.  His Steven Wright-as-computer geek demeanor suggests a typical
socially-challenged nerd more often than a man spinning into madness;
though he didn't need to bug out his eyes and foam at the mouth, he did
need to place Max close enough to the edge for us to see the bottom from
there.  Gullette's competent but distant performance lowers the stakes of
PI's twisted conspiracy theoretics.</P>
<P>     It's only when you step back from the narrative of PI that you
realize what a singular universe Aronofsky has created.  Yes, he does
stretch too hard at times to achieve his Lynchian vibe -- grainy
black-and-white photography, a mysterious sticky substance, blinding
flashes of light and a brain covered with ants do not necessarily a
profound statement make.  But who else would construct a psychological
thriller around large number theory, Wall Street and the Kaballah?  Who
else would create visuals as distinct as Max's techno-organic apartment,
or make an audience squirm so violently at the do-not-try-this-at-home use
of a certain power tool?  And who else has demonstrated the cinematic
instincts to turn a scene of a man writing down numbers into something
more tension-packed than a dozen Hollywood chase scenes.  The most obvious
antecedent may be Lynch, but even Lynch's hypnotic images have rarely been
this kinetic.  Though Aronofsky may have been limited by finances,
available talent or technical constraints, he has created a work which
leaves you hungry for what he could do next.  PI is the creation of that
one film-maker in a hundred who seems unlikely to make movies by the
numbers.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 beta pi's:  7.</PRE>
