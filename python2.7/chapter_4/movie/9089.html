                     JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH 1996
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
                        1 :-(  for too much peach</PRE>
<P>Cast: Paul Terry, Joanna Lumley, Miriam Margoyles, Pete Postlethwaite;
and the voices of Richard Dreyfuss, Susan Sarandon, Simon Callow, David
Thewlis, and Jane Leeves Director: Henry Selick Producers: Denise Di
Novi and Tim Burton Screenplay: Karey Kirkpatrick, Jonathan Roberts, and
Steve Bloom based on the book by Roald Dahl</P>
<P>As a great fan of any Roald Dahl work and adaptation to screen, I was
greatly disappointed with the results of 'James', when compared to the
other recent adaptation of 'Matilda'. Perhaps the stick-like animated
figures used for the most part of this movie, was what I found the most
annoying and dissatisfying. One would expect Burton and Dahl to go hand
in hand, as one has a tendency to paint dark moodiness and quirkiness
into his characters and movies, whilst the other had an unhappy
childhood which is reflected in the penniless 'Charlie', the
disadvantaged 'Matilda' and the orphaned 'James'. However, this union is
not to be.</P>
<P>'The Nightmare Before Christmas' effects on 'James' elegantly highlights
Dahl's darker side, but somehow mutates that fine connection between
fantasy and reality which makes Dahl believable and likeable. The
cartoon stick figures have made this movie pure fantasy, and even a
child with the greatest imagination will have great difficulty putting
'James' into perspective when compared to 'Charlie' or 'Matilda'. Then
again this is one of Dahl's taller tales, I mean - giant, flying
rhinoceroses swallowing parents, flying to New York on a giant peach
pulled by 100 seagulls, and magical green crocodile tongues - really! I
have to admit that when I read the novel as a child, I believed every
word and remain to this day fascinated by the story of 'James'. Then
again a child's imagination is so much more creative and magical than
anything Hollywood could ever offer.</P>
<P>So I was disappointed by the look and portrayal of this story. 45
minutes into the movie I felt like ripping Mr Centipedes legs off, I
wanted to divide Earth Worm into quarters, there was an incredible urge
to grind Mrs Ladybug beneath my heels, followed by the desire to swat Mr
Grasshopper and to 'Mortein' Ms Spider. I couldn't remember so much
bickering aboard the crew of the Giant Peach. James looked anorexic and
anaemic, and I had an incredible urge to insert a peripheral venous
catheter and transfuse the poor lad with blood and parenteral nutrition.</P>
<PRE>THE SICK BOY AND JAMES by TMT Voon</PRE>
<P>Unwell,  I watched 'James' with a raging fever,
I had taken the day off to help the clouded mind recover,
Perhaps against my better judgement,
I thought 'James' would be the best medicine.
So my analysis may appear virally septic,
But I really did feel that 'James' would make me feel better,
Instead I needed peaceful slumber,
For watching this movie sure made me despise it.</P>
