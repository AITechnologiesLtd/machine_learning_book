 Eyes Wide Shut (1999) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Tom Cruise, Nicole 
Kidman and Sydney Pollack. Directed by Stanley Kubrick.</P>
<P> Eyes Wide Shut is an examination of betrayal.</P>
<P> Director Stanley Kubrick's final film looks at the consequences of 
marital infidelity.</P>
<P> He does so by scrutinizing this premise: Is it being unfaithful to your 
spouse if you fantasize about having an affair with another person?</P>
<P> This is the issue that is raised by William Harford (Tom Cruise) and his 
wife, Alice (Nicole Kidman), who have been married  happily, it seems  
for nine years.</P>
<P> William is a successful doctor. Alice, who used to manage an art 
gallery, now stays at home and takes care of the couple's daughter.</P>
<P> After attending a party at the home of their friend, Victor Ziegler 
(director Sydney Pollack), in which two women come on to William and a 
charming gentleman named Sandor Szavost tries to seduce Alice, the 
couple return to their lavish apartment and get on with their lives.</P>
<P> The next night, as the two are sharing a joint, Alice asks William if he 
was tempted by the women. William says he wasn't because he loves Alice 
and being faithful is one of the tenets of marriage.</P>
<P> Alice, a bit high, then admits to her husband that a year ago, while on 
vacation, she fantasized about having sex with a naval officer she 
spotted in the hotel at which they were staying.</P>
<P> William is most upset by this revelation and cannot cope with the fact 
that his wife  even for an instant  contemplated being unfaithful.</P>
<P> This starts William on a dangerous and self-revealing course that leads 
him through the dark sexual underbelly of New York's elite.</P>
<P> Kubrick's movie is sexually frank, provocative and disturbing.</P>
<P> The director, who co-wrote the script with Frederic Raphael, was 
inspired by the 1920s novel Traumnovelle by Arthur Schnitzler. </P>
<P> And as in most Kubrick works, the technical aspects of Eyes Wide Shut 
draw you into his world.</P>
<P> At times he uses his camera like a voyeur, eavesdropping on his actors 
as they discuss the intimate details of their relationship.</P>
<P> In the scene where Szavost tries to seduce Alice on the dance floor, the 
camera continuously circles the two.</P>
<P> Kubrick's use of colors, especially yellow in the opening party 
sequence, also helps set the tone of the film.</P>
<P> The director's use of music also heightens the drama. The discordant 
notes of the minimalist piano piece "Musica Ricerata, II," mixed with 
such divergent tunes as "Baby Did a Bad Bad Thing" by Chris Isaak as 
well as such standards as "I'm in the Mood for Love" and "I Only Have 
Eyes for You," are the exclamation points as Kubrick's story moves 
along.</P>
<P> Kubrick has never really been known as an actor's director. When you 
think of his films, you think of the "Dawn of Man" or the space station 
sequences from 2001 or Slim Pickens riding the atomic bomb near the 
finale of Dr. Strangelove.</P>
<P> In Eyes Wide Shut he has encouraged and succeeded in getting Cruise and 
Kidman to bare themselves emotionally.
Cruise, because of his looks, has always been underrated as an actor. But 
time and again, in such films as The Color of Money, Born on the Fourth 
of July and Rain Man, he has proven he is a performer of subtlety and 
depth.</P>
<P> Here he adds a vulnerability and a sense of uncertainty that makes his 
odyssey all the more desperate and poignant. </P>
<P> You feel sorry for William because you know he is not sure what he is 
searching for.</P>
<P> He also uses Cruise's looks to question his sexuality. In one scene, a 
bunch of New York toughs harass Cruise's </P>
<P> William as he is walking down the street, thinking he is gay. In another 
sequence, a gay hotel clerk gives "Bill" some needed information because 
he is infatuated with his looks.</P>
<P> William can't find his answers if he is not sure of the questions. Is he 
seeking revenge? A few times he comes close to cheating on Alice, but at 
the moment of crossing that line, providence continually intervenes  
whether it be the ringing of a telephone or a knock at the door.</P>
<P> Kidman, like her husband, also has been somewhat underrated because of 
her beauty. But in films such as To Die For, Flirting and The Portrait 
of a Lady, her dramatic and comedic talents have overshadowed her 
beauty.</P>
<P> That also is true in Eyes Wide Shut. Kidman opens her self up, allowing 
the audience to see the insecurities and doubts that exist below the 
surface in every marriage.</P>
<P> Eyes Wide Shut, at two hours and 40 minutes, is a movie that takes 
patience. It is an intimate, interior story, a truly mature and adult 
exercise. It is Kubrick examining an emotional terrain few filmmakers 
have had the courage to tackle.</P>
<P> And while many may feel the movie is obvious, plodding and a bit dull, 
others will find it riveting, intense and sensual. You can count me in 
the latter group.</P>
<P> Eyes Wide Shut will not be remembered as Kubrick's finest film, but it 
will be regarded as his most adult venture.</P>
