<PRE>                         OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY (Rated R)</PRE>
<P>- Starring Danny DeVito, Penelope Ann Miller, Gregory Peck,
           Piper Laurie, and Dean Jones</P>
<P>     OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY is a slightly humorous version of Oliver
Stone's WALL STREET.  OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY is the story of a corporate
raider, played by DeVito, who wants to buy out a company.  He's so
ruthless that he is nickname "Larry the Liquidator."  The company DeVito
wants to buy goes by the name of New England Wire and Cable (as in
TELEPHONE wire and cable).  (There are even some obvious plugs for AT&T
phones!!)  The company is situated in a sleepy little town of Rhode
Island.  Trying to stop him are the chairman of the board of NEW&C,
great actor Gregory Peck, his wife, Piper Laurie, and their lawyer,
Penelope Ann Miller.  Miller and DeVito fight it out for who should keep
the company: DeVito, who will do anything to "help his stockholders," or
Miller, a clever business lawyer who will do almost anything to save the
old company and its employees.  The difference between this movie and
WALL STREET is that DeVito and Miller have a love interest.  Or is it a
lust interest?  </P>
<P>     Good performances are had by all, especially by DeVito.  DeVito has
a knack for nasty roles.  From RUTHLESS PEOPLE to THROW MOMMA FROM THE
TRAIN, he has delivered well.  Peck makes a short role interesting.  His
impressive speech at the annual shareholder's meeting is a notch in the
case against "liquidators."  Penelope Ann Miller gives a sultry but
otherwise okay role.  She's been cast in better roles, such as in THE
FRESHMAN.  Unfortunately, the movie was slowly paced with occasional
humor thrown in by DeVito.  The payoff at the end of the movie was not
really worth it either.   I'd give this movie this movie a "B" for
effort (on acting) but a "C" for execution.  The director, Norman
Jewison,  has directed better in other movies.  Jewison thought the
romance between DeVito and Miller was enough to carry the movie.  It
doesn't.  It isn't complex and neither is the plot revolving DeVito's
intended buy-out.  </P>
<P>     I'd rate this movie on a scale on 1 to 4 stars, a generous 2 stars
for the good, but not great acting.  OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY is rated R for
language, and adult situations, but no violence.</P>
