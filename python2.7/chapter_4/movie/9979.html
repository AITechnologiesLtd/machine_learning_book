<P>TO WONG FOO, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING! JULIE NEWMAR opens up with a parade of
drag queens on stage, dancing and frollicking to music. It strongly resembles
THE BIRDCAGE, not to confuse that TOO WONG FOO came first. The plot is
quickly unraveled as Vida Boheme and Noxeema Jackson (Patrick Swayze and
Wesley Snipes, respectively) tie for first place in a drag queen contest,
their prize being a trip to Hollywood. Naturally the two are thrilled, but
the more sympathetic one, Vida, takes pity on Chi Chi (John Leguizamo), an
amateuristic drag queen who's feeling quite a bit of self pity, and invites
him along.</P>
<P>TO WONG FOO doesn't take long to get to the goods, but it's somewhat boring
getting there so you still might feel anxious. The fun takes off when the
three "queens" end up stuck in the incredibly small town of Snydersville with
a broken down Chevy. They're forced to stay the weekend, and obviously become
a conspicuous group of flamboyantly dressed "women". Vida, Noxeema, and Chi
Chi end up teaching the women of the town how to be more independant, and the
men of the town how to be more gentlemanly. While the culture clash becomes a
close-knit family, the sherrif of a nearby town is on a hunt for these
"perverts". Apparantly he's not too happy about the embarrasing situation he
was left in after pulling them over with more-carnal-than-legal intentions.</P>
<P>Patrick Swayze is defintely the one who stands out in this film. While his
character may not be overly wonderful or impacting, he still put a lot into
it and does a fabulous job, as subtle as it may come off. TO WONG FOO is
pretty predictable even if it is predictable in a more wild-than-usual way.
Still, it's enjoyable and is worth seeing on video. While I only give it * *
1/2, it's a hearty * * 1/2!</P>
