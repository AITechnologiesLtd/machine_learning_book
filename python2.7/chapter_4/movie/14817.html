<PRE>       THE CELEBRATION
       --------------------------------------------------------------
                                                            GRADE: B</PRE>
<P>       CELEBRATION trots out that old chestnut, the "dark family
       secret," to enliven a birthday party for the 60-year-old
       patriarch of a large Danish clan. Director Thomas Vinterberg
       has signed onto the Copenhagen-based Dogme 95 collective of
       filmmakers, agreeing to a "vow of chastity" that precludes
       the use of props and constructed sets as well as any optical
       effects, special lighting, post-synchronized sound, or
       anything but handheld camerawork. The result is an edgy
       picture that's all the more impressive for what it does
       within its rigid aesthetic, but ultimately delivers less than
       it promises.</P>
<P>       Ulrich Thomsen is Christian, one of three adult siblings
       arriving at the party. Sister Helene and brother Michael are
       regarded by the family as somewhat less successful than
       Christian. The fourth, absent sibling is Diane, Christian's
       twin, who drowned herself in one of the house's bathtubs just
       two months previous to the gathering. Christian remains
       shattered by the loss, not least because he was the only
       family member not to receive a final telephone call or letter
       from his beloved sister. When Christian stands to make a
       speech, it's not to celebrate the family but rather to
       excoriate it, bringing some troublesome demons out of the
       past and into the harsh light of the present.</P>
<P>       Despite the nature of Christian's revelations -- he claims
       that, as children, both he and his sister were the unwilling
       objects of dad Helge's incestuous sexual desires -- the
       unflappable gathering is not scandalized, but merely taken
       down a notch for a moment or two. Dad denies the allegations,
       and Mom makes a point of Christian's active imagination and
       his difficulty separating fantasy from reality. Sullen and
       increasingly intoxicated, Christian plans to intensify his
       attack on the facade of normalcy that the family hides
       behind. In denial, Michael eventually responds to the
       allegations by dragging Christian out of the house
       altogether.</P>
<PRE>       All this is played out shrewdly and with a keen eye for
       social comedy. The film is overall witty and absorbing, the
       performances are on-target, and a few scenes here and there
       are astonishingly lucid. I was especially fond of a moment
       when Christian, having been beaten up and thrown into the
       dirt outside of the house, stands up and totters away from
       the aggressors as though his spirit has been broken before
       breaking into an awkward run for the door. Best of all, the
       kitchen staff (including Pia, who has a long-standing crush
       on Christian) is in on the elder brother's plan. The cooks
       and servants ensure that Christian will have a captive
       audience by rifling the coat pockets of the dining guests,
       stealing their car keys and tossing them in the freezer.</PRE>
<P>       Also effective is the sense that the house is haunted, not
       literally but figuratively, by the ghost of a suicide. And
       more upsetting than any of the talk about incest and suicide
       is the scene where, after Helene's black boyfriend arrives at
       the party, Michael leads the revelers in an effortless
       rendition of an old racist drinking song about a "black
       Sambo." For a few moments, Vinterberg extrapolates the
       blissful ignorance of this family to some larger
       cross-section of Scandinavian culture, and that's where the
       movie sinks its teeth in.</P>
<PRE>       In the end, though, the film seems like much ado over not
       much at all. Maybe it's just that we've been subjected to so
       many tales of incest and sexual abuse coming to light that
       using yet another variation as a story hook doesn't carry as
       much dramatic weight as it should. For whatever reason,
       Christian's pain seems more abstract than real, embodied as
       it is in the lovely memory of his beautiful sister, one that
       is wisely shared with the audience toward the end of the
       film. Moreover, the decision to shoot with available light on
       a bare-bones location may be in accordance with the Dogme 95
       vows, but the result is as much a tentative theatrical
       exercise as it is the disciplined, uniform filmmaking called
       for by the collective.</PRE>
<P>       Finally, I've got to say that this tactic of shooting on
       video and then transferring to film is starting to wear me
       out. Popularized by fellow Dogme signatory Lars von Trier,
       who used it to good, semi-documentary effect in BREAKING THE
       WAVES, I'm sorry to see it exalted in the supposedly
       truth-finding work of Dogme 95 filmmakers. While the effect
       can be striking, it's also distracting to see video artifacts
       blown up and exhibited on a big movie theater screen in a way
       that should be anathema to filmmakers seeking truth at 24
       frames per second. In other words: "Congratulations, Mr.
       Vinterberg. You have succeeded in making your film look more
       like television."
