<P>Plot: In 1290 B.C. the Egyptian high priest Imhotep is sentened to a death 
too horrible to be described for daring to seduce the Pharaoh's mistress 
Anck-su-namun. In 1926 Evelyn Carnovan, a librarian at the Cairo Museum of 
Antiquities, comes across a map leading to Hamunaptra, the forbidden Ancient 
Egyptian city of the dead. Rescuing adventurer Rick O'Connell who promises 
to lead her there from the hangman's noose, she sets forth on an expedition 
to find Hamunaptra, although they find themselves in a race against a rival 
American expedition. But the attempts of both parties to be the first to 
discover the lost city end up reviving the mummified remains of Imhotep. 
Imhotep needs the human organs of a number of victims in order to regenerate 
and unleashes the twelve Biblical plagues as he attempts to claim the 
necessary victims, incarnate his beloved Anck-su-namun in the body of Evelyn 
and unleash a blight of evil across the Earth.</P>
<P>The mummy film is maybe one subgenre more than any other that is condemned 
to B programmer status simply by its theme. The 1932 Boris Karloff ‘The 
Mummy' was a genre classic which, albeit cast a little too much in the 
shadow of the 1931 Bela Lugosi ‘Dracula', was given enormous eerie 
atmosphere by director Karl Freund. But the subsequent mummy sequels 
produced by Universal - ‘The Mummy's Hand' (1940), ‘The Mummy's Tomb' 
(1942), ‘The Mummy's Ghost' (1944) and ‘The Mummy's Curse' (1944) - turned 
the title character into a clumsy bandaged-wrapped zombie wholly lacking in 
threat, before reaching the ignoble nadir of ‘Abbott and Costello Meet the 
Mummy' (1955). England's Hammer Studios remade ‘The Mummy' in 1959, along 
with a package of other classic Universal horror films. There the character 
was effectively fed through the dynamic polarization of Victorian reason 
versus animal passion that the early Hammer films effectively represented. 
But alas subsequent Hammer mummy films - ‘Curse of the Mummy's Tomb' (1964) 
and ‘The Mummy's Shroud' (1967), with the arguable exception of ‘Blood from 
the Mummy's Tomb' (1971) - failed to escape the B programmer curse. And 
outside of the English-speaking world, the mummy's career path was well and 
truly on a long downward spiral, most notably being pitted in the ring in 
Mexico's ‘Wrestling Women vs the Aztec Mummy' (1964) and Santo vs the Mummy 
(19) , while Spain offered gore-drenched efforts like ‘Vengeance of the 
Mummy' (1972) and ‘Dawn of the Mummy' (1981). It can almost be said that the 
most effective mummy films are those that escape B programmer status by 
virtue of subsuming themselves into some other type of genre. The only other 
halfway effective mummy film has been the underrated ‘The Awakening' (1980) 
which dropped all bandaged-wrapped terrors and created an often subtle story 
about possession while modelling itself on the supernatural killings 
set-pieces of ‘The Omen'. (It was also the first mummy film in fifty years 
to actually shoot on location in Egypt).</P>
<P>The latest remake of ‘The Mummy' endeavours to abandon most connections to 
the mummy B movie and happily conflates the genre into a high adventure film 
a la the Indiana Jones series. If the 1932 version of ‘The Mummy' was born 
out of the emergent romantic horror film created by Universal's ‘Dracula' 
and the 1959 ‘Mummy' was pitted in the British fight with morality and 
society over animal instinct, then the 1999 ‘Mummy' is born out of the 
modern action-adventure spectacle and the CGI creature movie post-‘Jurassic 
Park'. This ‘Mummy' quickly abandons any connection with the shuffling 
bandage-enwrapped creatures of yore and the new mummy becomes a much more 
dynamic figure whose abilities are writ on an epic canvas - it talks, it is 
a black sorcerer who transforms into flurries of sand, blasts sandstorms out 
of its mouth, raises armies of the undead and animated scarab beetles, while 
wielding the Biblical Plagues of Egypt (which have in a complete about-face 
been placed in the service of a great Egyptian force of evil rather than in 
the service of the Almighty wishing to free a slave race from the Egyptian 
yolk).</P>
<P>The ‘Mummy' remake has been an oft-mentioned go-project for most of the 
1990s under directors such as Mick Garris and Clive Barker. Indeed when 
Anthony Perkins died in 1992 he was in the midst of shooting a subsequently 
abandoned remake. The director finally settled on, Stephen Sommers, debuted 
with the teen comedy ‘Catch Me If You Can' (1989) and followed with the 
acclaimed 1993 ‘The Adventures of Huck Finn' before making the underrated 
1994 live-action remake of ‘The Jungle Book' which, although it bore more in 
common with Edgar Rice Burroughs than Rudyard Kipling, had a beautiful sense 
of epic jungle adventure to it. However Sommers disappointed with 1998's 
‘Alien'-at-sea clone, ‘Deep Rising'.</P>
<P>Sommers though has a talent for crafting epic adventure. In ‘The Jungle 
Book' Sommers created an adventure-movie version of India that was more 
fabulous and more mysterious than the real India could ever hope to be and 
in ‘The Mummy' similarly creates a more fabulous and mysterious than the 
real Egypt adventure movie version of Egypt. The film is filled with 
incredible vistas of sandstorms, lost cities seen both in the fabulousness 
of their heyday and the spleandour of their ruins, treasure chambers, 
booby-trapped tombs. No sky ever seems merely blue but boils with coloured 
clouds and larger-than-real-life CGI moons. And Sommers has an ability to 
direct satisfyingly kinetic action set-pieces - shootouts with hordes of 
charging horsebound Bedouins, fights aboard burning ships, adventurers 
attempting to combat mummies with machine-guns and swords, biplanes racing 
against giant face-shaped sandstorms and a full-tilt ‘Evil Dead'-styled 
climatic set-piece up against zombified mummy priests.</P>
<P>But for all that Sommers' film crumbles into a lightweight popcorn munch 
without substance whose taste is immediately forgotten when one leaves the 
theatre. When one looks at it, it stirs no more and no less than the sum of 
the elements that ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark' assembled, yet ‘Raiders' became 
an instant classic while ‘The Mummy' falls well short of such stature and 
will probably barely even be remembered by the end of the summer. The 
difference is more akin to that between ‘Raiders' and ‘Indiana Jones and the 
Last Crusade' - where, by the time of the third of the Indiana Jones film, 
the sheer panache and kinetic inventivity of the first film had become 
ham-fisted slapstickery. Sommers great failing here is to play far too much 
towards common denominator audience-pleasing humour. The two leads make flip 
quips the whole way through and what few moments of horror there are drowned 
out by ‘Army of Darkness'-styled gags with skeletons playing football with 
their heads, with Weisz accidentally knocking down a domino line of library 
shelves and the like. Sommers is working with a one-dimensional script and a 
less-than-serious attitude toward it by he and the principals is something 
that causes the film's suspension of disbelief to fold at the knees.</P>
<P>Neither do the leads work. Brendan Fraser comes with too much baggage as 
casting as an amiable lunkead in comedies like ‘Encino Man' (1992), 
‘Airheads' (1994), ‘George of the Jungle' (1997) and ‘Blast from the Past' 
(1999). There is no depth to his character at all - we, for instance, never 
learn what he, an American, is doing adventuring in Egypt in the first 
place. A handsome stalwart leading man type such as Harrison Ford or Tom 
Selleck would have carried this part in their sleep but Fraser's goofy 
eye-rollings strip the character of any heroic stature. Similarly Rachel 
Weisz plays the fruity British accent up but, as always, she gives an awful 
performance and is not at all believable as a period woman. Arnold Vosloo 
has a certain sinister presence as the title character while John Hannah 
makes for irritating comic relief. But again the 
less-than-single-dimensionality of the writing makes the parts seem even 
slighter. Even more unforgivably most of the Arabic characters in the film 
seem written as comic foil racial caricatures where anybody of Arabic 
persuasion is portrayed as craven, greedy and stupid.</P>
<P>Eventually the film's persistent spectacle and sheer dynamism carries it to 
a certain level of likability, albeit entirely forgettable likability. You 
can't deny that Sommers directs action well, but neither can you deny that 
the miscast leads and a far too broad audience-pleasing sense of humour 
entirely deflates it as a film. Its lack of belief in its own seriousness is 
the dividing line between a forgettable popcorn film and what could have had 
the makings of a classic.</P>
