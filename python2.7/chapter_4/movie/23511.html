<PRE>A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>A well made period piece is often a tough sell for audiences. Most of these
films are highly dramatic and offer little in the areas of excitement or humor.
Mike Leigh's new film Topsy-Turvy which explores Gilbert and Sullivan in a
career slump breaks all of those rules. Blending a mix of colorful sets, great
music, genuinely funny scenes and dialog, and wonderful performances, this
movie keeps you interested for it's entire 160 minute length.</P>
<P>Famed playwright composer duo Gilbert (Broadbent) and Sullivan (Corduner) have
just opened their latest production, Princess Ida, at the Savoy theater in
England. The audience immediately proclaims it another hit, but the newspaper
theater critic says otherwise. This critic says he sees no progress in artistic
development coming from them, and says he cannot recommend the play. Sullivan
feels the same way, he's tired of using the same music again and again and
wants to write a grand opera, one so fantastic it will blow people away. </P>
<P>But there are concerns as to their future. The contract with the Savoy says
that they must produce a new play when asked, and while Gilbert has one already
written, Sullivan refuses to compose for he believes it's a rehash of what's
been done before. Gilbert is hard set in a writer's block and doesn't know what
to do. All of this changes when Gilbert is dragged by his wife to a local
Japanese exhibition. He is appalled and intrigued at the same time about the
native way of life there. This inspires him to write a grand play, The Mikado,
a play sure to woo Sullivan back and draw large audiences. But at what price
will it take to get the play onstage?</P>
<P>Another wonderful film that shows the lives of the actor. Offering much more
behind the scenes process than All About My Mother did, it really gives us an
idea of how much work went into these plays. The script was written with these
scenes in mind, and original musical composer Carl Davis (Sullivan himself is
also credited) adds some enchanting music to go along with them. This gives the
film an upbeat pace, despite many of it's sad undertones. The star of the film
has to be the woman (who's name escapes me) who researched the time period for
the film. There are many great touches that really give us a feel for the era,
including a very humorous scene in which Gilbert uses a telephone, which were
just being introduced in their time. Leigh does a wonderful job of shifting the
focus throughout the movie. For the first hour we are drawn into Sullivan's
problems and by the 100 minute mark, we have nicely switched over to Gilbert's
troubles. Other examples of this include the plights of various Savoy players
who've been in all the plays the two created. Much of the humor is bittersweet,
and really keeps this thing chugging along. While the length is an issue for
some, so many of the scenes are carefully selected that you never get bored
with redundant information. The only scene I thought was unneeded was an early
scene where Sullivan watches two bare breasted women perform some type of
mini-musical. If this scene had been removed, it easily could have achieved a
PG-13 rating. And you haven't seen anything until you see Gilbert pretending to
be a Japanese Samurai warrior.</P>
<P>All of the actors (and actors playing actors) really bring their characters to
life. Towards the end, I found myself forgetting that this was a movie, that
while fact based, was not entirely true. I felt like I was there, watching the
entire thing happen. Another great film to add to Mike Leigh's filmography, and
another great film that might change the way period pieces are made. This is
fun, energetic, and at times exciting, bravo Gilbert and Sullivan, I give you a
standing ovation.</P>
