<PRE>                              PRIVATE PARTS
                       A film review by Walter Frith
                        Copyright 1997 Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>Shock jock Howard Stern's rise to stardom in the radio business is profiled
in 'Private Parts'.  The picture is based on Stern's best selling novel and
literally traces the earliest days of his life as a child growing up on Long
Island to his rise and eventual success as a media phenomenon.  Despite
intense controversy over Stern's vocal tactics which include topics dealing
with just about everything explicit and sexual in society, the choice is
easy, like him or hate him.  Those who hate Stern need to simply tune him out
but his fans (who have been criticized by media analysts as 'undesirables')
have launched his program to national syndication for well over ten years.</P>
<P>The central focus of 'Private Parts' is not just Stern's dealings in the
media but rather on his personal life as we see him go through college to his
humble beginnings at radio stations in Detroit, Hartford, Washington D.C. and
New York City.  All the while the movie centres on Stern's relationship with
his wife Alison (Mary McCormack).  The movie strives to inform us that Stern
isn't who he seems to be on the radio but that it's all just an act and that
he's really a decent, loyal and loving husband and father of three.</P>
<P>Unfortunately for the audience, the entire film is dull, flat, repetitive at
times and makes its point and yet continues to bash us over the head with
Stern's antics.  Director Betty Thomas ('The Brady Bunch Movie') is not the
best person qualified to sit at the helm of this very intense and mesmerizing
adult subject matter.  The movie is disappointingly tame for Howard's true
fans and for the rest of us, we wonder exactly what the point of the entire
picture is since it seems to have a split personality.</P>
<P>Filmmaker Ivan Reitman ('Stripes', 'Ghostbusters', 'Twins', 'Kindergarten
Cop', 'Junior') is in the producer's chair for this one and along with
screenwriters Len Blum and Michael Kalesniko they have made what isn't
necessarily a bad film, just one that isn't very exciting and Stern's fans
should be patient as I'm sure the next film ( if there is one) will be much
jucier and at par with what Howard Stern's career is really all about.  There
is an interesting rumour circulating that may interest a lot of movie fans.
 'Batman and Robin' which is the fourth chapter since 1989 in the story of
the Caped Crusader is due out June 20th and if 'Private Parts' does well at
the box office, there's talk of approaching Howard Stern in the hopes of
casting him in the fifth chapter as one of the film's villains.  I'm not
kidding!!!</P>
