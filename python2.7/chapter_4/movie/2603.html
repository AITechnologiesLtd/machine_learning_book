<PRE>                               THE FAVOR 
             Starring Harley Jane Kozak, Elizabeth McGovern,
                      Bill Pullman and Brad Pitt. 
             Screenplay by Sara Parriott and Josann McGibbon. 
                    Directed by Donald Petrie.  (AA)
                                   by
                               Michael Leo</PRE>
<P>     THE FAVOR, a sex comedy that's been hovering in distribution limbo
for several years, offers a new solution to the problems of middle-aged
boredom and extramarital sex.</P>
<P>     It goes like this: thirtysomething housewife Harley Jane Kozak
loves husband Bill Pullman, but longs to consummate her relationship
with high-school sweetheart Ken Wahl.  (He never made it to home base.)
She wants to both relive the past, and rewrite it.</P>
<P>     So she persuades her pal, Elizabeth McGovern, who's involved with
Brad Pitt, to seduce Wahl, report back on the experience and settle the
matter by proxy.</P>
<P>     Now the glitch: the deed is done, but Kozak is outraged to learn
from McGovern that the earth moved.  Kozak's sense of deprivation
becomes more, not less, acute.  And so begins a series of sexual
misunderstandings that are traditional and tireless within the genre of
bedroom comedy.</P>
<P>     THE FAVOR has scattered chuckles and is generally amiable.  How
droll you find it may rest on your tolerance for Kozak, who plays a
self-obsessed manipulator who treats other folk like extensions of
herself--not quite a roaring sociopath, but she'll do until one comes
along.</P>
<P>     My limit was tested when, after pushing her chum to be her sexual
stand-in, interfering in the romances of others and driving her genial
husband nuts, she justifies her actions by explaining that she wanted
to feel "like a babe" and "get that rush you had when you were 16."</P>
<P>     Oh, please.  What about parental interference, the insufferable
teachers, the embarrassing, inexperienced sex and the zits that
sprouted like weeds?  Is "16 forever" such a great deal?</P>
