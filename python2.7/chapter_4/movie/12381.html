<PRE>                            ETHAN FROME 1993
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                   2 :-) :-) for great sexual tension</PRE>
<P>Starring: Liam Neeson, Patricia Arquette, Joan Allen
Director: John Madden
Producer: Stan Wlodkowski
Screenplay: Richard Nelson (based on the novel by Edith Wharton)</P>
<P>Edith Wharton must be the mistress of sexual angst. THE AGE OF INNOCENCE
carried such enormous, buried sexual tension, intricately suffocated
beneath layers of silk and corsets, that one can not get an erection
without hurting themselves. With ETHAN FROME, the issue of forbidden
love once again pops its curious head.</P>
<P>Times are harsh and the winter is bitterly unforgiving, like most of the
townsfolk when it comes to ETHAN FROME (Liam Neeson). A young pastor
arrives in town and with genuine Christian charity, extends his hand in
friendship to the crippled, outcast Frome. The movie opens like Emily
Bronte's WUTHERING HEIGHTS. Frome like Heathcliff has a tragic story to
both hide and to tell. The viewer is then taken on a fascinating journey
leading to this man's demise. Ethan Frome was once married to a sickly
woman called Zeena (Joan Allen), whom he did not love. In the background
of this loveless marriage, is the presence of a young, beautiful girl
called Mattie (Patricia Arquette), and this is their story.</P>
<P>I can not say I enjoyed the ending, which came as a shock more so than a
surprise. Wharton is renown for her depressing tone and style of
writing, so the morbid finale is at least in keeping with her character.
Once again, a large amount of unreleased sexual tension is generated
between Mattie and Ethan. The feeling is wonderfully heightened by the
presence of a frigid wife and winter; the bleakness of life and love,
forcing these two characters into each other's arms. Even when the
tension is finally released, the lovemaking is silenced to the hush of a
flame flickering nervously on a shallow wick.</P>
<PRE>Brilliantly directed and acted.</PRE>
