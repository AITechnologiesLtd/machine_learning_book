<PRE>SWEET AND LOWDOWN
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>SWEET AND LOWDOWN, written and directed by Woody Allen, tells the story
of Emmett Ray, the world's second greatest jazz guitarist.  This legend
in his time is played with boyish charm by Sean Penn.  Told in
talking-head documentary style by jazz historians, the movie paints a
vivid portrait of an artist who never really existed.</P>
<P>Emmett, who fainted the two times he ever witnessed his better play,
lives an itinerate lifestyle.  He may be well known among jazz
aficionados, but his propensity to show up for work drunk, late or not
at all causes much grief for the owners of the clubs that book him.  In
order to get by, he does a little pimping on the side.  He also steals,
but that's just because he's a kleptomaniac.</P>
<P>One day, the relationship-challenged Emmett meets an unlikely date on
the boardwalk, a laundry worker named Hattie (Samantha Morton).  A
homely, sad-sack of a woman, Hattie has no figure and no voice.  She had
lost the ability to speak due to an illness, and she can't even write
legibly to compensate for it.  Perhaps the only reason that Emmett is
attracted to this woman, whom he ridicules as a "dumb, half-witted
orphan," is that she likes sex as much as he.  More likely, it's because
she demands so little of him.  She goes on the road with him, acting in
the capacity of a wife, although they never marry.</P>
<P>Late in the story, Emmett is swept off his feet by a striking
ex-debutante and would-be writer, Blanche (Uma Thurman).  Blanche may
have the looks that Hattie doesn't, but she shows neither the love nor
the loyalty.</P>
<P>The stories are pleasant enough but not exactly compelling.  Sometimes
there are even different versions of the same story.  Other times, a
speaker will tell a story but question the veracity of the person he
heard it from.</P>
<P>Thanks to Fei Zhao's radiant cinematography, the picture looks terrific.
Shot in warm tones of burgundy and gold, the foreground contrasts nicely
with the cold, gray, overcast skies.  In a movie in which so little
happens -- Emmett likes to wile away his time shooting rats at the dump
and watching trains -- the visuals provide much of the enjoyment.  The
script is remarkably bereft of memorable lines and lacks much of Allen's
signature comedic punch.</P>
<P>The movie's fatal mistake is the remarkably underwhelming playing by
this putatively famous guitarist.  Although the film's jazz background
score is lush, Emmett's playing isn't.  The song he plays most often
isn't likely to wow audiences in the first place -- "I'm Forever Blowing
Bubbles."  Why couldn't they have come up with more impressive musical
choices for such a jazz great?  When Emmett plays, it's quite pleasant
but rarely more than that.</P>
<P>SWEET AND LOWDOWN runs 1:35.  It is rated PG-13 for sexual content and
some substance abuse and would be fine for teenagers.</P>
