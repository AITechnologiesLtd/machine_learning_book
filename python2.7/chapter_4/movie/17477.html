<P>Rushmore is one of the most brilliantly funny and moving films I've
seen in years, and easily one of the best pictures of 1998.  Directed by
Wes Anderson, and written by Anderson and Owen Wilson, Rushmore shows
the trials and tribulations of young Max Fischer, including his love for
an older woman (Olivia Williams) and his childish sparring with a
millionaire (Bill Murray).  There isn't a failed comic moment to be
found in Rushmore, but it works ultimately because the characters are so
real and likable.  Schwartzman, Murray, and Williams all shine in their
roles, and you're certain to leave the theater smiling.</P>
