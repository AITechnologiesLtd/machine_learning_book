<P>     After playing a dying woman in both HOWARDS END and LITTLE ODESSA, 
Vanessa Redgrave has focused her skills on something a little lighter.  
A MONTH BY THE LAKE, the frivolous-yet-sluggish romantic comedy from 
director John Irvin (WIDOWS' PEAK), gives her an opportunity, no matter 
how ephemeral, to lay aside her serious reputation and become immersed 
in a story whose only real issue is whether two late-middle-aged Brits 
of vastly different temperaments can fall in love.</P>
<P>     The entire film takes place at a vacation resort on the shores of 
Italy's Lake Como during the late Spring of 1937.  Away from this 
breezy, idyllic paradise, rumors of war are growing, but they rarely 
intrude on the vacation of Miss Bentley (Redgrave), who is a regular 
visitor to the lake.  This is a time of peace before an unspeakable 
tragedy--a period when everyone knew what was coming and did their 
best to seize a few months of happiness before the world was plunged 
into darkness.  Yet it isn't the growth of fascism that makes this year 
different for Miss Bentley--her father has only recently died and she 
has just ended a 14-year affair with a married man.  The only other 
English citizen at the hotel is Major Wilshaw (Edward Fox), an upright, 
uptight ex-British officer on his first visit to Como.  He and Miss 
Bentley strike up a friendship but, while she is interested in 
tentatively pursuing something deeper, he holds back, his eye having 
been caught by a young, flirty American nanny (Uma Thurman) who enjoys 
leading him on just to see how big a fool she can make of him.</P>
<P>     The first half of this film drags.  The coy sparring between Miss 
Bentley and the major can't sustain the viewer's interest by itself, and 
there's little else going on.  Trevor Bentham's script is smart, dry, 
and, too often, stagnant.  Aside from a few droll comic interludes 
(including a very funny tennis match), it takes a long time for A MONTH 
BY THE LAKE to get moving.  When it does, it's enjoyable in the way that 
most intelligent romantic comedies are enjoyable, but there is an 
obvious start-up penalty.</P>
<P>     As is often the case, no matter what kind of role she plays, 
Redgrave steals the show.  Buoyant and cheerful, Miss Bentley is an 
instantly likable character--far from the sort of stodgy fifty-
something Englishwoman abroad one might expect.  While it took an 
ENCHANTED APRIL to unwind characters played by Joan Plowright and 
Miranda Richardson, Miss Bentley is carefree before she ever arrives at 
Lake Como.  </P>
<P>     Edward Fox plays Major Wilshaw as a somewhat laughable, pompous 
bore.  Yet, even though the character often comes across as fatuous, Fox 
knows when to reign in the comic element.  There is a touching moment 
late in the film when Wilshaw shows that, as thick as his emotional 
armor is, the proper thrust can still penetrate it.  This scene, which 
takes place during a magic show, is A MONTH BY THE LAKE's most serious, 
as well as one of its finest.</P>
<P>     Uma Thurman, fresh from the glitz of PULP FICTION, intentionally 
overplays her role as an American hussy.  Taking a cue from the WIDOWS' 
PEAK performance of Natasha Richardson (Redgrave's daughter), Thurman 
turns her Miss Beaumont into the perfect caricature--someone whose 
only two purposes are to add comic flair and romantic complications to a 
relatively static plot.  Without Miss Beaumont, nothing would have 
happened between Miss Bentley and Major Wilshaw, and without Thurman, 
nothing would have happened in this movie.</P>
<P>     Romance for the over-fifty crowd is a rare commodity in motion 
pictures.  Judging by the average Hollywood take on the matter, one 
might easily assume that it's rare for someone with gray hair to fall in 
love.  A MONTH BY THE LAKE has a different view of the world, and one of 
the chief pleasures of this film is watching two aging, uncertain 
characters bumble their way into a relationship.  It's unfortunate that 
it takes so long to set up the situation, as the most lasting effect of 
this slow start is to dampen the eventual payoff.</P>
