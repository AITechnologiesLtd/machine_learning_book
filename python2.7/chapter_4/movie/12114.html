<PRE>The object of my affection
can change my complexion
from white to rosy red
Anytime she holds my hand,
tells me that she's mine
There are many girls who can thrill me
and some who can fill me
with dreams of happiness
But I know I'll never rest
until she says she's mine ...........................</PRE>
<P>The title "The Object Of My Affection," is familiar to connoisseurs of old
pop music, from the eponymous song of long ago. The movie's sound-track,
pleasant and mercifully not as busy as most, includes a few nice oldies,
notably the 1929 "You Were Meant  for Me," performed twice, by Sting and by
Gene Kelly. But surprise! "The Object..." is, sadly, nowhere to be heard.</P>
<P>A good semi-surprise is that the film's several gay men are portrayed in
anti-"La Cage aux Folles"ways. The gays are treated in a straight fashion:
no special traits, intonations, mannerisms, flamboyance, queenly demeanor
and the like. Just people. In fact, ordinary beings. But then, ordinary
people can often be uninteresting too, and that's the main rub in this
movie.</P>
<P>George, a New Yorker like most others in the cast, teaches first grade in a
posh, private school. He gets dumped by college professor and would-be
writer Robert Joley, his companion for four years. Helpfully, Nina, who
counsels teen-age girls, places at George's disposal a room in her
apartment. The two become fast friends, "fast" meaning both quickly and
strongly.</P>
<P>Nina's boyfriend Vince, a civil rights lawyer and occasionally her
colleague, seems to be a decent fellow, but eventually the couple comes to
a parting of the ways, somehow catalyzed unwillingly by George's presence
and Nina's ever-growing affection for him, an acute state of mutual loving
friendship. This almost climaxes when Nina starts initiating sexual
relations. Perhaps, at this point, the story could become "A Bisexual is
Born," (or reborn) but the odd couple is saved by the bell, that of a
ringing telephone.</P>
<P>When Nina finds out that she pregnant by Vince, she decides to raise the
child with George. It looks like a good plan, until George, after a long
period of uninvolvement with other men, meets Paul, an actor who lives with
much older Rodney, a Brit in New York .</P>
<P>Rodney gets rather little screen time, but Nigel Hawthorne plays him
beautifully: as a theater critic with a bite, and as an aging man who loses
his lover.  He does it with admirable economy, wit, wisdom, contained
fatalism and pathos. After the movie is forgotten, Hawthorne will not be.
The actor is reunited here with director Nicholas Hytner, the British stage
person whose film debut was "The Madness of King George."</P>
<P>The other supporting roles, all very peripheral, range from tiny to
sub-sketchy, with semi-caricatures reserved for such as senior citizens
taking ballroom dancing lessons,  and especially for a funny Alan Alda
("the most powerful literary agent in the world") and his current wife. She
is also Nina's older stepsister and self-appointed matchmaker. Recurring
bits of a daft older lady on the ground floor of Nina's building are
blatant padding.</P>
<P>The main performances (Nina's and George's appealing duo; Vince's
uncertainly written part)  are pretty good, but missing in strong
personalities. There's a lack of energy all over, in characters and filmic
rhythm, in spite of some lively or colorful scenes. The film is slow. Not
that it drags, bores, or requires suspension of disbelief. Yet its approach
is scattershot as it touches on comedy, romance and downplayed drama,
without getting any strong mileage out of any of those.</P>
<P>A paradoxical curiosity. Those who know about the prudishness of the old
Hollywood Code are aware of how far movie frankness has come. In an early
scene, counselor Nina is discussing boys with her girls. Says one about a
new male acquaintance: "What he wants is to [verb deleted] me." Nina's calm
response: "The point is, do you want to [verb deleted] him?" It is odd how,
within in a film where the openly sexual premises are not a bit scabrous in
1998, this dialogue jars.</P>
<P>On the whole, "The Object of My Affection" is the object of your attention.
It holds it, but not your rapt attention. The viewer remains distanced and
uninvolved. To put it simply, the movie just does not excite. But it does
make for an agreeable, entertaining 110 minutes.</P>
