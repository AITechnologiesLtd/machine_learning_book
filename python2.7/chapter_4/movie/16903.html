<P>_200_Cigarettes_ (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>As much fun as they may be to make, and as interesting as the assembled
talent often is, multi-story and -character ensemble films have a built-in
problem: all the stories and characters never hold the same amount of
interest.  While Robert Altman has shown that it is possible to come up
with a consistently engaging pastiche of narrative threads, more often than
not similar efforts by others come out wildly uneven.  Such is the case
with Risa Bramon Garcia's somewhat amusing but underachieving
_200_Cigarettes_.</P>
<P>Within the loose narrative framework of people finding their way to one
big Big Apple bash on the Eve of 1982, Garcia and screenwriter Shana
Larsen, both first-timers, do come up with one completely successful plot
thread: that of platonic friends/roommates Kevin (Paul Rudd) and Lucy
(Courtney Love).  Kevin is depressed over his recent breakup with
performance artist girlfriend Ellie (Janeane Garofalo, as hilariously
acerbic as ever) and the fact that it's also his birthday, and Lucy wants
to cheer him up and make him forget about Ellie--in any way she can.  Right
off the bat one can see where this storyline will lead, but the terrific
pairing of Rudd and Love makes it never less than involving.  Love is
particularly impressive, displaying a warmth and vulnerability that is as
delightful as it is surprising; her performance here--in tandem with her
breakthrough work in _The_People_vs._Larry_Flynt_--reveals Love to be the
real thing, actingwise.</P>
<P>Unfortunately for Garcia and Larsen--and even worse for us--there is one
huge dud of a storyline involving two Long Island teens, Val (Christina
Ricci) and Stephie (Gaby Hoffmann), who get lost on the mean streets of the
East Village.  Along the way, they hook up with a couple of punk rockers,
Tom (Casey Affleck) and Dave (Guillermo Diaz).  It's always nice to see
Ricci onscreen, but her talents are wasted in this story, which is an
absolute waste of time--it's not funny; there is no payoff whatsoever; and
only two of the characters play notable roles in Garcia and Larsen's grand
scheme.  Making this thread even more unbearable is a truly grating
performance by Hoffmann, who is actually given more to do than Ricci.</P>
<P>The other stories in the hodgepodge that is _200_Cigarettes_ are varying
degrees of just-passable, with some of the actors turning in standout
character work.  Dave Chappelle is amusing as a slick cabbie who taxis many
of the characters around town.  Ben Affleck is a hoot as an incredibly
square bartender who catches the attention of many a patron, most notably
starving artist friends Caitlyn (Angela Featherstone) and Bridget (Nicole
Parker).  Martha Plimpton is nicely neurotic as the big party's harried
hostess, but she's saddled with a tedious thread revolving around her ex's
(Brian McCardie) sexual inadequacy.  But the one person, other than Love,
who makes the strongest impression is newcomer Kate Hudson, who plays the
purehearted Cindy, who spends her New Year's Eve with Jack (Jay Mohr), whom
she doesn't know is quite the ladies' man.  Hudson is effortlessly likable
and charming, but Garcia and Larsen too often have her engage in cheap
pratfalls and other acts of clumsiness.</P>
<P> "Clumsy" can also describe the way Larsen chooses to close out the film,
with a hamfisted monologue about how people "hide" behind cigarettes--as if
she were somehow required to explain her title (as if the virtually
non-stop lighting and puffing weren't explanation enough).  Yet as
heavy-handed as that touch and statement is, it also pretty much sums up
_200_Cigarettes_: what's good about it is hidden behind the smoke of
mediocrity.</P>
