<P>There have been Merchant-Ivory costume dramas with more of a pulse than
"The Mod Squad," a self-consciously "hip" cinematic rendering of the old
TV series still looked upon fondly by so many baby-boomers. Well, said
"Squad" certainly won't be a pleasant viewing experience for them or
anybody else, maybe even the teen target audience the movie has been
geared towards. A contemporary take on this decidedly '70s show doesn't
exactly seem unwarranted, but one wonders if the mold it accumulated
while waiting on the shelf didn't transform into a full-blown case of
botulism.</P>
<P>How curious that the film begins by defining both mod and squad,
insisting that the latter is a group of people working together and then
contradicting this definition by keeping its titular trio apart for a
sizeable chunk of the running time. They are Julie, Pete and Linc,
reformed delinquents working undercover for the LAPD (exposition put out
of the way so fast that you're likely to be lost from the opening
moments on), and they are respectively played by Claire Danes, Giovanni
Ribisi and Omar Epps, talented actors each deserving of better than
this.</P>
<P>Their plight involves standard cop-corruption stuff, as our would-be
protagonists catch wind of an internal cover-up after their superior
(reliable Dennis Farina, one of the best things here and gone so
quickly) gets killed and framed for drug trafficking. They pout a lot
and eventually get cracking to expose this convoluted conspiracy using
surveillance tactics that would impress the Hardy boys and Linda Tripp
but few others. When you're supposed to be asking, "What's going to
happen next?", you'll instead entertain thoughts like "Who are these
people and why should I care?" or "Aren't thrillers supposed to contain
thrills?"</P>
<P>Not that Danes, Epps and Ribisi don't give it a shot. Danes can do the
troubled teen thing in her sleep, as evidenced by "My So-Called Life,"
but she's saddled with a mysterious-boyfriend (Josh Brolin) subplot so
see-through you begin to seriously question her so-called intelligence.
Ditto for Ribisi's ("Saving Private Ryan") looney loose cannon, though
at least he performs with a wild-and-crazy vigor that occasionally
demands attention. But Epps - poor Epps. Epps ("Higher Learning") is so
short-changed he's reduced to literally waiting around for a bad guy to
chase him.</P>
<P>All this sloppiness can be attributed to the screenwriters, one of whom,
Scott Silver, is also the director. They must think that if they dress
up their stupid story in such spiffy trappings (the look of the film is
really quite impressive), it'll somehow pay off, but this "Mod Squad"
plods anyway. Characters are non-existent; present are just some
good-looking young things modeling cool Levis and cooler attitudes. Plot
hardly escapes confusing convention. And the one genre element you'd
think would be show up in generous portions - a few nifty explosions,
some fights, any kind of action whatsoever - only rarely makes it to
this dull gabfest.</P>
<P>All those quick to put down last month's inept but serviceable "My
Favorite Martian" update need to take a step back. Here's a
small-to-big-screen translation that really should've stayed in its
former incarnation, "Mod" or not.<HR></P>

"It presents as comedy things that are not amusing. If you think this
movie is funny, that tells me things about you I don't want to know."
