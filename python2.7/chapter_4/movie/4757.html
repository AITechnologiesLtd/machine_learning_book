<PRE>                SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND (1978)
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks

<P>        Obvously, no one has ever put the Bee Gees in the same
league with the Beatles, but for some reason, Barry, Robin and
Maurice (the Brothers Gibb) seem to think they can take on the legend
of the Fab Four. Like the other zero-star features in this book, SGT.
PEPPER is an absolutely dreadful, horrendous movie, especially for
Beatle fans. As someone who owns and enjoys the Abbey Road and
Sgt. Pepper albums, the elevator music renditions of such classics as
"Here Comes the Sun" (a.k.a. "Here Goes Our Career") and "Lucy in
the Sky With Diamonds" (a.k.a. "Guys in Leisure Suits With No
Talent") are more than painful.</P>
<P>        It's not just the Bee Gees doing frightfully bleak covers of
Beatle songs in this movie. Co-star Peter Frampton (oh boy) gets into
the act, along with George Burns' serious take on the song "Fixing a
Hole" (you'll laugh yourself silly during this number), Alice Cooper,
who thinks he's the voice of Satan in a remake of the effeminately
psychadelic "Because," Aerosmith with "Come Together" (if you're
wondering why Aerosmith agreed to be in this movie, just remember it
was during their heavy drug use period), Earth, Wind & Fire with a
disco version of "Got to Get You Into My Life," and Billy Preston in a
banana-yellow leisure suit, singing "Get Back" (sample lyric: "Maurice
was a man who thought he was a woman").</P>
<P>        The absolute worst remake in the movie (besides the fifteen
Bee Gee-Frampton numbers) is Steve Martin's version of "Maxwell's
Silver Hammer," a song from the Abbey Road album about a young
man who kills people with a hammer. Martin's version, unlike the
"Dentist" song from Little Shop of Horrors, ruins the spirit of the song,
where he voices the lyrics of the song instead of singing them, a clear
sign of absence of talent (Just think of all the times Madonna has done
that).</P>
<P>        The "plot" here has Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
(consisting of Frampton and the Bee Gees) getting discovered, signing
a contract after an orgy (You haven't lived until you've been to a PG
Bee Gee orgy), and rocketing to stardom (in that alternate world where
Frampton and the Bee Gees are considered talented). Meanwhile, the
movie's villain Mean Mr. Mustard (just like the song) is out to steal
their instruments (just like they stole the Beatles' songs), so they won't
be able to make their musical magic. Like they can't find another
synthesizer and drum machine at the shop around the corner. Other
characters from Beatle songs include Mr. Kite (George Burns), Lucy
(in the sky with diamonds) and Strawberry Fields (I'm serious).</P>
<P>        In addition to the bad Beatle remakes, Frampton and The Bee
Gees try to come off as the world's most successful ladies' men (i.e.
Robin sitting on a pool diving board, singing "She's so Heavy!" while
stroking the legs of two beautiful women), but instead look like the
gayest foursome on the earth. At least the producers had the good
sense to change the line in the song "Here Comes the Sun" from,
"Little darling, it's been a long, cold, lonely winter," sung by
Strawberry Fields to Frampton after a literal roll in the hay, to "Little
Peter, you've really got a little peter." No, not really, but don't you wish
they did?</P>
<P>        Even worse are the costumes in the movie. During one
sequence, the Bee Gees are riding in a hot air balloon in aviator
costumes (which, in itself, is dreadful) when they are hit by a bolt of
lightning. Suddenly, they're all dressed in costumes strangely
reminiscent of the Power Rangers. Oh great, the Mighty Morphin Bee
Gee Rangers.</P>
<P>        Perhaps the most ironic sequence is a fight between Steven
Tyler of Aerosmith and Peter Frampton, where Frampton actually
wins. Well, Frampton never made it into the 80's, much less the 90's,
and we all know Alicia Silverstone never would have agreed to appear
in the music video for "Show Me the Way." Aerosmith is still going
strong, while Frampton is working the fry bin at Hardee's outside of
Pittsburgh.</P>
<P>        This movie is a huge embarrassment for everyone involved
(yes, even Frampton and the Bee Gees). Once you get over laughing at
the sheer idiocy of all these people thinking they're the Disco Beatles,
you'll still have to sit through almost two hours of falsetto Bee Gee
Beatles songs. Trust me, you won't make it through the movie. No one
makes it through the movie. I did, of course, but I'm the movie critic
and, believe me, it wasn't in one sitting.</P>
