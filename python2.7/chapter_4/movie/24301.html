<P>"American Psycho" opens by presenting us with a plain white screen and 
proceeds to drop big red things down across the opening credits. Then 
red stuff is smeared across the screen -- it's blood, right? After all, 
this is a movie about a serial killer, isn't it? Our anticipation grows 
as a big knife is raised, ready to slash its next victim, which turns 
out to be . . . a piece of meat. Whoops. All that red stuff was nothing 
but pieces of fruit and some sauce, and we are not looking at a 
conceptualized murder; we are looking at food preparation. This opening 
credit sequence is a fine precursor for what "American Psycho" will 
eventually become: This is a film out to give you exactly what you don't 
expect. It's not going to be an easily consumed slasher flick. "American 
Psycho" wants to subvert your expectations -- to make you think.</P>
<P>Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a hotshot young Wall Street 
executive. Patrick is handsome and successful. He gets chauffeured 
around in a limo, lives in a cavernous, posh apartment, and throws money 
around like confetti. He also has a problem: He kills people. Not right 
away; he's busy trying to make himself appear successful to his 
coworkers by getting fancy new business cards and attempting to score 
reservations at the most exclusive European restaurants. But Bateman is 
frustrated. He still gets one-upped by a fellow exec who looks just like 
him (Jared Leto), he is still bored with his socialite fiancE9e (Reese =
Witherspoon), and his extramarital lover (Samantha Mathis) has grown 
cold and drugged-out. So he takes out his aggression by committing 
violent murders, usually in the comfort of his own apartment while 
philosophizing about the virtues of commercialized 80's music (Huey 
Lewis, Phil Collins). Patrick likes to kill prostitutes mostly, but 
he'll take a coworker or a homeless man if it suits him. Possible 
problems surface when a private detective (Willem Dafoe) is hired to 
look for one of his victims, and this detective may or may not suspect 
Patrick of the murder.</P>
<P>"American Psycho" was based on the novel written by Bret Easton Ellis, 
one that drew controversy at the time of its publication for its graphic 
descriptions of brutal murders and perceived misogyny. It was considered 
"unfilmable." Despite such sentiment, director Mary Harron has managed 
to produce a film version, and she's made a fairly coherent work out of 
it too. If there is a misogynist streak in this version of "American 
Psycho," it's of the deeply satirical variety: Harron doesn't glorify 
Bateman's murders, but rather presents them as the deeds of a sad, 
repressed man who turns to murder as his only recourse against a 
stifling world. This is satire of consumer culture at its best. The film 
jabs at the vast emptiness caused by defining oneself by comparison to 
others, as Bateman does, eventually letting his jealousy push him over 
the edge. A colleague has a superior business card? Invite him to your 
house and kill him! Frustrated with your more conventional sexual 
conquests? Invite prostitutes in and kill them too! The analogies are 
not lost on Harron: Bateman even holds a chainsaw over his crotch in one 
of the later (and more over-the-top) scenes, and black comedy abounds in 
the early going. Witness Bale dissecting the finer points of "Hip to Be 
Square" while preparing to take an ax to a man's head (also witness his 
hilariously stiff dance moves)-never has Huey Lewis seemed so profound. 
The aforementioned "pissing contest" involving business cards is also 
extremely well-done, and very funny, unless you're the sort of person 
who actually *can* explain why eggshell is preferable to off-white.</P>
<P>Christian Bale delivers a whale of a performance, one that may not be 
fully appreciated until the film has run its course. Playing a weird 
hybrid of Tom Cruise and Jim Carrey (with a little Malcolm McDowell 
thrown in for good measure), he initially appears to be underacting, 
then overacting. But afterward comes a realization that he delivered a 
perfectly modulated, very carefully planned performance, one that 
managed to consistently jibe with Harron's ever-shifting objectives. 
It's important to realize that Bale is not so much playing a person as 
he is a representation of a specific kind of person, one who has put 
material gain above all else. His facial ticks and voice inflections are 
meant to confuse initially and illuminate afterward -- many of the 
choices Bale makes don't appear to have a clear meaning until after the 
end credits begin to roll. Bale is also surrounded by a capable 
supporting cast, including Dafoe, Leto, Witherspoon, Mathis, and Chloe 
Sevigny as Bateman's insecure secretary. Their performances generally 
range from "good" to "excellent," and their efforts help the film a 
great deal.</P>
<P>It's important to realize that Harron's film is one that requires a 
certain investment from the audience to be effective. It is not enough 
to sit back and demand entertainment from "American Psycho." Only the 
attentive viewer will be rewarded, and nowhere is this more evident than 
in the final suggestion that none of Bateman's murders actually 
happened. This is not certain-the script (by Harron and Guinevere 
Turner) is ambiguous enough to allow for multiple possibilities-but it 
helps to explain certain formerly inexplicable occurrences. No one hears 
Bateman comment about wanting to kill people or being in the business of 
"murders and executions, mostly" (a model hears it as "mergers and 
acquisitions," and I'll leave interpretation of the wordplay up to you). 
But maybe no one hears because he never actually said it. That would 
also explain why no one in his apartment building complains about 
screaming women running down the halls while chased by naked men with 
chainsaws, and why our boy Patrick is somehow able to blow up a cop car 
with a handgun. The argument over whether or not Bateman imagined all 
his murders is not, as some critics have suggested, pointless. An 
entirely new dimension is added to the film once you consider Patrick a 
repressed loser who only wishes he were someone as cool as a serial 
killer. It better supports a point Harron seems to be making here: A 
person need not be a murderer to be a "psycho." He just needs to be 
insane. Bateman's crisis isn't resolved either; by film's end, he still 
hasn't escaped from his shell. This is not an exit.</P>
<P>"American Psycho" has its share of problems: It repeats itself too much 
and seems to consider itself far more important than it actually is. I'm 
also wondering why it had to be set specifically in the 80's. The satire 
is universal enough to be applied to many a time period, so specificity 
only makes the film feel dated. It would probably have been better to 
set "American Psycho" in an invented world that doesn't actively suggest 
any particular time or place, a la "A Clockwork Orange" or "Fight Club." 
Still, "American Psycho" must be given attention despite its problems. 
It's deeper than it appears, far less bloody than advertised, and also 
begs an interesting question: Does all that 80's music help make one a 
better murderer? Notice how Patrick Bateman only actually succeeds at 
(or imagines succeeding at) killing someone after listening to music. 
Considering his taste, it's not surprising. Heck, if I listened to Phil 
Collins every day, I might be about ready to kill someone too.</P>
