McHale's Navy (1997)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 21</PRE>
<P>"McHale's Navy" is transparently a screen adaptation of the 
mid-1960s U.S. television show, but it has more in common
with the "Police Academy" movie series of the 1980s.
It attempts to be a comedy, but does not succeed.
Nothing is funny, nothing works, and lots of things blow
up.  Too bad the producer's house was not among them.</P>
<P>"McHale's Navy" stars Tom Arnold, whose character is despised
by the Navy brass, but beloved by the common sailor.  He is
a profiteer who somehow gets caught up with fighting "the
second best terrorist in the world" (Tim Curry).  To prove
how bad he is, Curry kills several people for no obvious reason.
These deaths are supposed to be funny.</P>
<P>I do have something nice to say.  The tropical locale where
this film was shot looks like a terrific place to take a
vacation.</P>
<P>Ernest Borgnine has a cameo, and serves as a dubious link
to the old television show, which was much better and knew
enough not to involve world terrorists in situation comedy
plots.  Many talented actors are wasted on this hopeless 
project.  I will do them a favor and not mention them.</P>
