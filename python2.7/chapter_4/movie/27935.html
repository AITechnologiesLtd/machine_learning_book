<PRE>GET OVER IT
By Pete Croatto

<P>Get Over It at least has one thing that a lot of other high school
movies don't:  earnest, affable leads.  It also has all of the key flaws
that make going to teen movies so risky:  an almost unbearable goofy
streak, a plot with the strength of a newborn fawn, and bland supporting
characters.</P>
<P>The movie makes the same mistakes over and over and eventually drains
one's patience, but yet I stuck around because the leads played kids I
would have liked to know.</P>
<P>Kirsten Dunst (Bring It On) plays an intelligent, friendly musical
talent, who for reasons never explained in the movie, helps a schoolmate
(Ben Foster) win back the girlfriend (Melissa Sagemiller) who dumped
him.  Dunst coaches him through an audition for the school musical,
which stars Sagemiller.</P>
<P>But nothing comes easy.  Dunst and Foster start falling in love, while
Foster still has the hots for Sagemiller, who is seeing her co-star
(Shane West).  Meanwhile, events conspire to force Foster to star
opposite the two girls he has feelings for.</P>
<P>Dunst and Foster (a real-life couple) are perfect for the leads.  He has
a very appealing, laid-back charm, while she displays a sweet, concerned
demeanor that makes her such a good pal here.  Together, they're fun to
watch.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, most of their (and the movie's) appeal gets lost among
the stupid activities that dominate the plot--a chronically humping dog,
punch spiked with vomit, a trip to a sex club.  Screenwriter R. Lee
Fleming seemingly wants his teenage audience constantly occupied, an
insulting and disrupting tactic.</P>
<P>By going the crass route, Fleming neglects developing most of the
supporting characters.  Foster's friends (Colin Hanks and "Thong Song"
crooner Sisqo) don't have personalities.  They're just extras with more
face time.  Dunst's friend (Mila Kunis from That 70's Show) appears to
have been cast simply because they needed at least one more attractive
girl to get the green light from Miramax.</P>
<P>Foster's sex therapist parents (Swoosie Kurtz and Ed Begley Jr.) are
also poorly written.  They readily accept their son's sexual/social
adventures.  Boring.  It'd be funnier if the parents were completely
shocked at everything their son did.  The only effective supporting
actor is Martin Short, who plays his typically unhinged self as the
school musical's obnoxious director.</P>
<P>Here he's doing a variation of his flamboyantly blunt talent agent from
The Big Picture, but it's still fun to watch him dance like a Backstreet
Boy and to perkily tell Dunst of her performance: "Yes, it's just not
very good."</P>
<P>Short's production of A Midsummer Night's Dream (think Grease meets
Shakespeare) is one of the movie's bright spots, as is a musical number
featuring Foster walking in lovelorn shame as singer Vitamin C and an
array of characters dance to "Love Will Keep Us Together."</P>
<P>Those moments of bubbly charm come in fits and starts, and the wait
requires lots of patience.  Either that or a predilection for watching
dogs hump objects.</P>
