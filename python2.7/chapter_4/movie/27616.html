<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Offbeat film director Alan Rudolph (ChooseMe) makes films that require
an acquired taste to fully enjoy. In this fluff piece, which the
director calls a "screwball noir," it suffers mostly because its mixture
of being a formula noir tale and a comic farce is overtaken by its
forced comedy and a story that has little drama in it, but it perks up
at times because of the charming performances by all concerned and the
constant barrage of wacky dialogue.</P>
<P>Trixie (Emily Watson) is a simple-minded square espousing innocence with
her wide-eyes, but by her constant misuse of language through the use of
malapropisms, she becomes a comic figure. She came from Chicago with her
misplaced Midwestern accent to be an undercover lakeside resort casino
security guard somewhere in the Pacific Northwest. She is chewing the
fat even when she's chewing gum, romancing a confused young lustful man
and while on a murder case is desperately trying to overcome her lack of
knowledge about romance.</P>
<P>Through her overnight casino job she meets those who the story revolves
around. She befriends a lounge comic Kirk (Nathan Lane), who offers her
platonic-paternal counseling. His shopworn act of imitating celebrities'
well-known sayings, is the pits. Dex (Dermot Mulroney) is a young Romeo
bumbler who picks her up in the casino and arouses the young virgin's
sexual interest. Dawn (Lesley Anne Warren) is a kept woman, enamored by
her own sexiness though not particularly liking sex and, on top of that,
is a pill-popping, mediocre pop-country singer. Red Rafferty (Will
Patton) is a sleazy real estate developer and a small time gangster, who
keeps Dawn as his mistress and has Dex as his lackey attendant. The
femme fatale role falls to the spurned lover of Dex, the one who had his
child, barfly Ruby (Brittany Murphy). Senator Drummond Avery (Nolte) is
the incarnation of a white-maned politician who is both lecherous and
corrupt, and he is the partner of Red in debauchery and in smelly land
deals. He is in the habit of excusing his indiscretions by pointing out
other politicians who had affairs on the side, like Ike and FDR and how
that didn't prevent them from doing their job.</P>
<P>The film starts off in an amusingly pleasant way, as Trixie's banter is
laced with continuous malapropisms such as, 'By hook or ladder,' 'He
smokes like a fish,' and 'Nobody is human.' But this one-joke idea of a
film soon starts to wear thin and the laughs become harder to get, as
her malapropisms come with every sentence she utters and eventually
bring the film down.</P>
<P>The film's strongest scene is set on Red's boat, where violence and a
possible sense of an orgy happening clouds the pleasure cruise. It
culminates in Trixie attacking Red for pinching her and of Dex coming to
her aid, and of them getting kicked off the boat by the hired thugs Red
employs.</P>
<P>When Dawn disappears, Trixie tracks her down and learns of a videotape
she has of a sexually incriminating act, which she has hidden and is
using it as a means of blackmail for money. After Trixie locates the
tape, Dawn is thrown out of the hotel window she had been hiding out in
and Trixie decides that she must solve the murder. To do this, she joins
the martini drinking senator in the upscale restaurant he frequents and
from there on the film turns into a suspense story, as Trixie begins to
unravel the mystery of the murder. Unfortunately, the picture itself
also unravels.</P>
<P>This is an actor's picture, where they are given every chance to do
their thing, even if it results in over-acting. Emily Watson is featured
in every scene and makes the best of what she's given to work with. Nick
Nolte hams it up and unmercifully chews-the-scenery whenever he can,
especially when ranting about his impoverished childhood and the
peccadilloes of other politicians. The film was mildly enjoyable, but
could have been much better if Rudolph tried to put a coherent story
together instead of just going for cheap comedy.</P>
