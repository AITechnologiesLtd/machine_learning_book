                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>105 min., PG, Comedy, 1992
Director: Frank Oz
Cast: Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn, Dana Delany, Peter MacNichol,
      Robert B. Shull, Laurel Cronin, Julie Harris, Donald Moffat</P>
<P>     Steve Martin first meets Goldie Hawn at a party and then later
waitressing at a restaurant.  He gets invited into her house and tells
her about a house he owns that is empty.  The next day, unknown to
Martin, Hawn moves into the empty house.  She starts making up stories
about her and Martin to explain why she is there.  Martin is in love
with Dana Delany, who is in the town that the house is located in.
Martin finds out what Hawn has done and tries to use her to get Delany.</P>
<P>     I saw HOUSESITTER the weekend that it opened and am just getting
around to finishing my review on it.  HOUSESITTER is a very funny film
and is well worth seeing.  I don't know whether to recommend that you
see it in the theater or wait for the video.  The film will lose nothing
on video, but if you can't wait to see it you would be better off going
to the theater to see it.  I give HOUSESITTER a four on a scale of zero
to five.   HOUSESITTER is rated PG for adult situations and explicit
language.</P>
<P>     HOUSESITTER is the first of two films coming out this summer with
Goldie Hawn, the second is DEATH BECOMES HER.  I have always been a fan
of Goldie Hawn's films and sometimes of Steve Martin's, so I hurried out
to see this one.  Both Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin did a great job
acting.  They were both funny, but not in an obnoxious sort of way, like
Steve Martin sometimes is.  Dana Delany does a great job in her
supporting role and adds a lot to the film.  The two bums, Robert B.
Shull and Laurel Cronin, I think, were excellent.  Peter MacNichol's
character was, in my opinion, a very annoying character, but then again
that is all MacNichol seems to play.  Steve Martin's father, I don't
know who played him, was excellent  and very convincing.  The jokes in
this film were, for the most part, hidden under the surface and just sat
there allowing you to laugh if you caught it and if you missed it there
is another waiting just around the turn of the film reel instead of
forcing you to laugh like slapstick comedies do.</P>
<P>     The film is well written and doesn't have many holes in it.  It
definitely keeps you entertained.  The characters are interesting and
well molded.  They seem to come alive on the screen and do their own
things.  The sets and locations are great.  The town where the house is
located looks like any little town and is simple in its ways.  The house
itself I don't think was well designed, however, at least I wouldn't
want to live in it (maybe it's just me).</P>
