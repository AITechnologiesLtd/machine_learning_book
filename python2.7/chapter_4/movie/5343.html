<PRE>                         THE HORSEMAN ON THE ROOF
                         (LE HUSSARD SUR LE TOIT)
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>     THE HORSEMAN ON THE ROOF (LE HUSSARD SUR LE TOIT) is an exercise
in style.  It is a fast action tale of a devastating 1832 cholera
epidemic in the south of France.  Secondarily, it is both a romance and
a horror show.  It is billed as a romance because it has two beautiful
stars who hang out together in the show, but no more.  Equally well, it
is macabre since it has more needlessly gruesome dead bodies than any
morgue.  In close-ups the characters vomit a lot, usually all over
themselves, and after the hundredth corpse, you may feel like throwing
up as well.</P>
<P>     The local doctor tells us, that this is the "worse epidemic ever"
and shortly thereafter he dies.  Let me warn the squeamish again that
if you go to this show, you will see scores and scores of dead bodies.
I am not talking about removed shots from fifty feet away.  These are
close-ups of pale white people with congealed blood on them and the
look of absolute terror on their faces.  In one scene a large black
bird begins to peck the eye out of one of the corpses.</P>
<P>     When the director (Jean-Paul Rappeneau) is able to get away from
pestilence and death, his picture is gorgeous.  The cinematography by
Thierry Arbogast is full of steel blues and grays.  Especially lovely
are the sequences of the towns at night and of the mountains.  If you
are a fan of swashbuckling sort of tales, you may like the hectic pace
and all of the little adventures the director puts his stars through.
The costumes (Franca Squarciapino) and the music (Jean-Claude Petit)
are both lush and beautiful.  The sound (Pierre Gamet and Jean
Gouldier) is particularly impressive in the huge noise created by a
group of cavalry rushing from out of nowhere in a dense forest.</P>
<P>     The plot of the show is that Angelo (Olivier Martinez) is a 25
year old Italian army colonel and would be revolutionary.  He is being
hunted by the Austrian secret police.  He meets a beautiful young woman
named Pauline de Theus (Juliette Binoche).  Together they search for
Pauline's husband.</P>
<P>     Angelo writes frequently to his mother who "is a duchess that
talks only of revolution."  In one letter he tells her, "Mother, you
always wanted me to be more reckless.  Today, you would have been proud
of me."  She would not be so proud of his acting which is non-existent.
Olivier Martinez is a man handsome enough to be a model, but I saw no
evidence of any acting talent.  He has a striking pretty brown tabby
cat who does know how to act.  I liked the cat better than any of the
actors or actresses in the film.</P>
<P>     Juliette Binoche can be a wonderful actress, see for example,
DAMAGE, THREE COLORS: BLUE, and THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING among
others.  Here, she gets poor guidance from the director I guess because
she shows little emotion and spends most of her time in vacuous smiles.
The chemistry between the two leads, who theoretically are falling in
love, is not believable.  For that matter, neither are the action
sequences.  In one, Angelo fights off twenty soldiers merely by making
sure the sun gets in their eyes.</P>
<P>     Overall, the script (Jean-Claude Carriere, Nina Companeez and
Jean-Paul Rappeneau based on the novel by Jean Giono) is a mess.  There
are fist fights, fighting armies, murders, plague, fires,
revolutionaries, lost husbands, romances, and lots of people whom it is
hard to figure why they are there at all.  If you were watching the
show at home, you would be constantly rewinding the tape in vain to try
to figure out what is happening.  Confusion is this show's middle name.
To make it worse, everyone in the picture moves with such a high
nervous energy that it leaves you exhausted.</P>
<P>     Finally, one piece of trivia.  They had only one way to treat
cholera back then.  They poured alcohol all over the body and rubbed
vigorously in order to stimulate the circulation.</P>
<P>     THE HORSEMAN ON THE ROOF runs way too long at 2:10.  I saw all of
it, but it is so repetitious that if I had left after only thirty
minutes, I would not have missed anything.  The picture is in French
with English subtitles.  The film is rated R.  There is brief nudity,
no sex, but lots of extremely horrific pictures of people dead or
dying.  This is a very intense show that is only for people with strong
stomachs.  If teenagers want to see it, make sure they can handle the
gore.  I liked the pretty parts of the picture, but otherwise it left
me cold so I can not recommend it and can only give it * 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
