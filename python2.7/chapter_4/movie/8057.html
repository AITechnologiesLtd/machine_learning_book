                       A film review by Phil Brady
                        Copyright 1997 Phil Brady</PRE>
<P>Well, I had ducked both Pocohantas and The Lion King, so continued
U.S. citizenship required that I go see the latest Disney animation,
Hercules. Not that I wasn't looking forward to it..the promos made it
clear that this was much lighter fare than recent Mouse droppings. And a
happy film it is. An opening scan of  Grecian urns is accompanied by the
grave tones of  a Charlton Heston voiceover, but before he gets into it,
he is interrupted. "Too boring!", says a group of Muses, stepping down
from their picture on an urn. Graciously, Chuck accedes to our new
narrators, who form a rockin' Greek chorus (and anyone who's seen The
Little Shop of Horrors can tell you: hip black chicks make the very best
Greek choruses).</P>
<P>The basic story is normal for this franchise: coming-of-age for a
not-so-typical youth. Greek mythology meets Damn Yankees is the
high-concept blurb. Herc's quest to become a hero and return to Olympus
is thwarted by the plotting Hades and Meg(ara), but you can see Joe, Mr.
Applegate and Lola quite clearly. Meg works for Hades, in a standard
seduction/soul-acquisition gig, but as she brings down Hercules, she
falls in love with him. With apologies to Ray Walston, James Woods makes
a much funnier Hades.  Memorable for playing many jittery, dangerous
heavies, Jimmy's real persona is funny, and very close to the Hades
character, and Hades is played as a stand-up comic trying to take over
the universe. "What is this, a crowd or a mosaic?", he asks when his
opening joke bombs. His sarcastic exasperations over his minions'
failures are very funny, and it's nice to see that Bobcat Goldthwait has
found his niche, as a wretched goblin in service to Hades.</P>
<P>Additional casting gems are Danny DeVito as a not-so-Yoda mentor to
young Hercules, and Rip Torn as Zeus. The movie makes a parody of its
own genre, showing merchandising run rampant when Hercules becomes
famous. When Zeus tells Herc that he isn't a hero yet, he protests: "But
I'm an action-figure!" Priceless is a scene where an incredulous Hades
notices that Bobcat is wearing "Herc-Air" sandals. Can't say much about
the music, though. It gets us from this scene to that scene, but all of
it was forgotten ten seconds later. They shoulda stolen some of the Damn
Yankees' music, too. The designated single, "Go the Distance," meanders
around, bumping into things. Michael Bolton does a cover over the
closing credits, but methinks the coast is clear for a non-Disney Oscar
in the music category.</P>
<P>Hercules was a very enjoyable film, and although I didn't leave the
theater humming the music, I can sing its praises.</P>
