<PRE>                  THE STAR MAKER (L' UOMO DELLE STELLE)
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     THE STAR MAKER (L' UOMO DELLE STELLE) is an Italian film and one
of the 1995 Academy Award nominees for best foreign film along with ALL
THINGS FAIR (Sweden), ANTONIA'S LINE (Netherlands), DUST OF LIFE
(Algeria), and O QUATRILHO (Brazil).  It is by the director (Giuseppe
Tornatore) of the widely acclaimed and Oscar-winning Cinema Paradiso.
It is a great little story of a movie talent scout and huckster who
scours poor but picturesque Sicily enticing the locals with the promise
of great riches.</P>
<P>     Sergio Castellitto plays the con artist known as Joe Morelli or
Dr. Morelli.  He is supposedly an agent for the studios in Rome, and
Joe plays his part with great gusto stopping everyone and inspecting
their faces from all sides.  He finds them all worthy, of course, and
invites them to pay for a screen test promising them that the bigwigs
in Rome will get back to them in a month, after he is long gone of
course.</P>
<P>     The movie starts with a scared and terrified guy trying out in
front of the camera.  From offscreen the talent scout sticks his hand
in to pat him on the back and reassure him with a simple, but forceful
"very good."  Soon we cut to a scene with Joe driving through towns in
Sicily in an old beat up truck with big loudspeakers on it which booms
out with, "We are here to offer you a fantastic future!"  Soon the
whole town is practicing the last lines of GONE WITH THE WIND.  Some do
it straight, "Afterall tomorrow is another day," whereas other
embellish it or localize it.  There is one especially funny scene with
some old tough guys rehearsing Scarlet's lines to each other.</P>
<P>     Joe has the whole town convinced that they will be the one to get
rich.  He is treated like a god, and people dote on his every word.
Usually, he cons people out of their hard earned money without remorse,
but sometimes his conscience gets the better of him.  To one person he
tells, "movies are a new business.  I don't want to disappoint you,"
but most people he makes feel sure that they will be the one picked to
be the next movie star.</P>
<P>     Like a Woody Allen movie, the first thirty minutes or so of the
picture is filled with scores and scores of people doing short screen
tests.  Some people are fun to watch and some are incredibly boring and
repetitive which is one of the major downfalls of this format when it
is carried on for so long.  These scenes needed much stronger editing
by Massimo Quaglia.  Instead, he keeps too many scenes in and just
makes them too short and choppy to conserve time.</P>
<P>     Joe sees a dead body floating down a river, but the locals ignore
it since it is a Mafia hit.  Later, he runs into bandits who want to
kill him.  How he avoids death makes for a fantastic scene.  Joe is
confused and frighten by all of this.  A local physician whom he gives
a lift tells him, "We all understand things when it is too late."</P>
<P>     One of the major problems with the film is that the script by
Fabio Rinaudo and Giuseppe Tornatore is too talky.  The images and the
plot are more than enough to carry the show, yet many scenes have way
too much dialog which amount to little.  The simpler scenes are by far
and away the best.  Overall, I thought the script was the weakest part
of the film and was badly in need of rework.  It needed to be much more
focused.</P>
<P>     Eventually Joe falls in love with a woman named Beata (Tiziana
Lodato) so he refuses to take her money for the fake screen test.
Beata has a simple view of the movies, "I like love stories where
everybody kisses and are happy ever after."  Lodato is a great, but
simple actress who plays her part with great sensuality and feeling.
Quite a compelling performance.  Sergio Castellitto gives a sweet
performance, but I thought Lodato upstaged him with a smaller role.</P>
<P>     THE STAR MAKER has two parts.  A long, fanciful, funny, and
hopeful part switches to a morose shorter part.  I thought the first
part worked well, but the writer seemed to run out of energy and ideas
toward the end.  The first part is imaginative and unique; the last is
pure formula.  Overall, I thought the plot and the concept were better
than the execution.  It could and should have been much better, but I
certainly enjoyed it, and I hope to see both of the leads again,
especially Tiziana Lodato.</P>
<P>     The picture is beautifully filmed by Dante Spinotti with sets of
tremendous natural beauty.  There are beautiful brown and yellow stone
buildings in ruins and near ruins.  The Sicilian countryside manages to
outshine most of the people in Joe's screen tests.</P>
<P>     THE STAR MAKER runs 1:48.  It is in Italian with English
subtitles.  It is rated R.  It has sex, full frontal nudity, bad
language, and some violence, but would be fine for any teenager.  Flaws
and all, I liked the film, and I think you will too so I am giving it a
thumbs up and awarding it ** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
