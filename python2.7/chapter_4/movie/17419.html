<P>PLOT:
A nerdy College professor believes that the perfect relationship between a
man and a woman should be based entirely on matters other than physical
attraction and sex. He decides to prove this theory to himself by choosing a
physically unattractive woman as his companion. She also seems to agree with
his theory but ultimately falls into the traps of the human heart.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Pleasant film with an interesting premise managed to keep me entertained
through all of its lengthy runtime, which is a little over two hours, with
some funny lines, original points of view on relationships, and a simple but
applicable musical score. One of the only problems that I had with this film
was the casting of Barbra Streisand as the "ugly ducking" woman. <spoiler
ahead> I would have rather seen an actress that would really have been able
to alter herself much more for the ending, since I didn't find Barbra's
changes to be more than just cosmetic. And to show her exercising in padded
clothes, and then svelte in a tight black dress, is not a terribly
convincing way to fool us into believing that she'd lost weight. Other than
that, the film is fun to watch if you're interested in seeing this theory
put into practice (This exercise was quite frustrating to Mrs. JoBlo), some
fluffy romance, and an overly nerdy professor performance put forth by Jeff
Bridges. Pierce Brosnan also has a throwaway role in this movie, and Lauren
Bacall, despite her decent performance, showed me nothing worthy of all
those Oscar calls back in 1996.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Dudley Moore was originally cast in the role that went to George Segal.
"Creative differences" were cited for his reason for leaving.
This film is a remake of the 1958 French film LE MIROIR A DEUX FACES.</P>
