<PRE>IN SHORT: Feh.</PRE>
<P>Cranky has seen it before . . . when an kidlet audience heartily laughs
at "serious" (and non-comedic) lines coming out of a character's mouth
and still walks out saying they "liked" the film, that means I'm way too
old to be doing this job. That's as good a way as any to analyze Gossip,
which brings to the big screen a visual style that crosses teevee's NYPD
Blue and Miami Vice and takes a story grounded in reality and shoots it
off into the absurd like a skyrocket on the Fourth of July. That it has
a 1950s-ish stylish look to it can be attributed to producer Joel
Schumacher and that it looks like telly is no diss on episodic NYPD Blue
director Davis Guggenheim. What it is is what it is, and that is
nonsense.</P>
<P>Gossip is the story of students Derrick (James Marsden), Jones (Lena
Headey) and Travis (Norman Reedus) who, as part of their end of semester
final project for Professor Goodwin (Eric Bogosian), start a rumor about
a classmate to see where it leads. The rumor is that the very rich and
very pretty Naomi (Kate Hudson), whose rep for saying "no" to all the
boys on campus is the stuff of legend, got insanely drunk at a party and
put out for current would-be beau, coincidentally named Beau (Joshua
Jackson). The rumor, as rumors are wont to do, runs speedily out of
control and the next thing you know, Naomi has filed date rape charges
against Beau. And people start dying.</P>
<P>If Gossip had stayed on that course, it might have turned into something
interesting. As it throws gimmick and plot twist at you, again and
again, it quickly loses any sense of rhyme or reason. One of the
principal trio has old baggage re: Naomi to resolve. One may be a
psychotic sociopath. One is flat-out called a liar by the police
detective (Sharon Lawrence) investigating the "rape". One flat out lies
to the cop (Edward James Olmos) that shows up at the door. And all but
one may be scamming everyone else. That's five characterizations for
three characters and we haven't even begun to delve into the backgrounds
of Naomi and Beau . . .</P>
<P>What it all means is that, if you're still around nineteen or so, you
might buy into the big surprise plot twist and story revelations that
mark the conclusion of this piece o' junk (pretty much the reactions of
the audience I sat with). If so, answer the follwing question before you
dissmail Cranky: Why possible motivation did [you-know-who #1] have for
setting up [you-know-who #2] (said motivation must lie before the rumor
at the center of the piece starts getting spread, else any answer you
can come up with makes no sense whatsoever). While the kidlets are
working on that, let's talk about why films that try to look like NYPD
Blue don't seem to work on teevee, despite inflated budgets that allow
for the breakage of every piece of glass in sight.</P>
<P>It's 'cuz we see it every week on NYPD Blue which, even on its bad
weeks, still manages to cram a full story into less than an hour. Given
the luxury of a larger time frame writers Gregory Poirier and Theresa
Rebeck, basically, thought way too much and delivered a story that
collapses under the weight of its own cleverness (and explaining that
means giving away the end of this story, which we don't do). Personally,
we don't like walking out of a flick thinking "huh?" and we sure don't
like it when a director and/or writer falls back on visual gimmicks like
a lingering camera, as if to scream "BAD GUY! HERE'S THE BAD GUY!" And
to tell you that that lingering camera bit is just a deception layed on
top of a deception would mean we're breaking the rule about not tipping
the end. Sort of.</P>
<PRE>Oops. No loss.</PRE>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Gossip, he would have paid...</P>
<PRE>$2.00</PRE>
<P>Pretty actors and half a story. Wait and rent.</P>
