Running time: 86 minutes.</P>
<P>The spirit of ET runs through this charming story of an
unlikely friendship between a young boy and a giant mechanical robot
from space.  The Iron Giant is based on a story originally written by
Britain's Poet laureate, the late Ted Hughes, after the death of his
wife Sylvia Plath.  The story was then turned into a rock opera by Who
guitarist Pete Townshend, which explains his involvement as one of the
producers of this marvellous and enormously enjoyable animated tale.</P>
<P>The film is set in 1957, and is suffused with the Cold War
paranoia, suspicions of Russian supremacy in space, and fear of both
nuclear war and invasion from another planet.  The action of the story
takes place in the picturesque sea side town of Rockwell, which
immediately brings to mind both the famous illustrations for the New
Yorker magazine as well as the town of Roswell, famous for its UFO
landing.</P>
<P>Ten year old Hogarth Hughes (voiced by Eli Marienthal) has
been raised with a healthy imagination, fuelled by a diet of horror
movies and fantasy comics, and has a penchant for adopting stray pets.
One night while home alone he ventures outdoors to investigate the
sudden interference with his tv reception.  Suspecting an alien
invasion, he cautiously follows a trail of debris into the forest.  He
finds the eponymous robot trapped by electrical cables, and rescues
him.  Thus begins an unusual friendship between an impressionable
young boy and a friendly, but misunderstood, alien creature who has no
memory of its origins.</P>
<P>When a suspicious and sinister government agent (voiced by
Christopher McDonald, currently seen in tv series Family Law, etc)
comes to investigate reports of strange nocturnal sightings in the
area, Hogarth conspires with local junkyard owner and aspiring artist
Dean McCoppin (Harry Connick jr) to hide the robot.  But when man's
basic instinct and its natural urge to destroy that which he does not
understand takes over, the scene is set for a climactic showdown
between the friendly robot and the army bent on saving the world, at
any cost.</P>
<P>Although the animation is not quite in the same league as
recent state of the art features like Toy Story and its ilk, The Iron
Giant is still very good, and a lot of care has been taken in creating
the look of the film.  Unlike some Disney animated features, which
espouse old fashioned family values, The Iron Giant is surprisingly
modern in some of its attitudes - e.g. Hogarth's mother (voiced by
Friends star Jennifer Aniston) is single and works as a waitress in a
road side diner.
 </P>
<P>Director Brad Bird, a veteran of animated series The Simpsons
and King Of the Hill, explores some important themes and issues here,
and the film is full of positive values.  Bird even manages to include
a strong anti-guns message, as well as lampooning some of the nuclear
warning messages prevalent during the height of the Cold War.</P>
<P>Even the characters have more depth than one normally
encounters in a cartoon, and the story is surprisingly moving and
touching.  This is largely due to the wonderful script from Tim
McCandlies, who gave us the underrated Dancer, Texas a couple of years
ago.  Bird has assembled a strong vocal cast, including John Mahoney,
Cloris Leachman, and Vin Diesel (from Saving Private Ryan), who
provides the voice of the iron giant.</P>
<P>As with films like A Bugs Life, Toy Story and Babe, animated
films are not just purely aimed at children anymore.  They are not
patronising to adult audiences.  Instead, the best children's films
have a strong story, wonderful characters and explore important ideas
and themes that have crossover appeal to broader audiences.  Along
with the wonderful Stuart Little, The Iron Giant provides superb
entertainment for audiences of all ages during the holiday season!</P>
