<P>Never underestimate the gullibility of the American Psyche. We want
our ghosts.  We need our government cover-ups and conspiracies. We
lust for an Extraterrestrial implant. And a lot of us really expect to
win the lottery. From this collective wanting of something unique and
otherworldly, comes the current flavor of the month "The Blair Witch
Project", a marvelously adept film representation of the old shell
game. Much hype and effort has gone into creating the "legend"
surrounding this film. There are individuals who earnestly believe in
the story of three film students who have mysteriously disappeared.
But for all the attentive hyperbole and inventiveness, what does the
movie have to offer. That is an interesting question, because without
the hype or the backstory (or the ingenious marketing strategy), 'The
Blair Witch Project' would not be as successful at raising the hackles
of most of it's viewers.</P>
<P>The film opens on a black screen. Fading up is the (now) famous
tagline for the film:</P>
<P>In October of 1994, three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods
near Burkittesville, Maryland, while shooting a documentary.</P>
<P>One year later, their footage was found.</P>
<P>With what has been seen before in the news reports about the film and
the mock documentary, this opening credit manages to create an air of
foreboding.</P>
<P>The film is basically a reconstruction from the discovered Video, Film
and Audio recordings of Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams and
Joshua Leonard who have left home for Burkittesville, Maryland to
shoot a short documentary on the legend of the Blair Witch. We see
some interesting interviews with some of the locals of Burkittesville,
talking about the legend and the history of the curse.</P>
<P>As the three filmmakers march into the woods, tensions begin to
mount. Being ill prepared for any real camping experience, the three
young people are soon lost and bickering amongst themselves. This
slowly escalates into terror, as during the nights they are wakened by
strange noises, that seems to emanate from all around them.</P>
<P>As their terror and anxiety grows, Heather Donahue tries valiantly to
remain in control of the small group.  Unfortunately, her growing
self-doubt and insecurity is fuels by the constant bickering from both
Joshua Leonard and (especially) Michael Williams. When they loss (?!)
their map, all reason is lost. The students wander aimlessly in
circles, returning to the same campsite that they had left earlier
that morning.</P>
<P>That night after much noise and chasing of unseen visitors, Joshua
disappears.  Now Heather is seized with fear. Michael now has to serve
as the leader, something he seems suddenly capable of doing.  Again,
more noises during the night, followed by the discovery of a strange
totem left outside of their tent, which is tied together with remnants
of Joshua's clothing. Concealed inside are the visual remains of
something possibly human, possibly animal. Now all hope expires as
Heather has a breakdown, confessing to her video camera that she is
responsible for what has happened.  The film climaxes with the
discovery of an abandoned house, it's interior walls covered with the
dirty (bloody?) handprints of children.</P>
<P>What "The Blair Witch Project" has managed to do, with no lack of
inventiveness, is to re-invent the marketing champagne for
movies. Since the development of the Internet, motion picture
companies had used the World Wide Web as another marketing tool. You
can download trailers and bios of your favorite stars and view behind
the scene video clips from any number of movies. What has happened
with the "Blair Witch" is the creation of an advertisement that seems
not to be an advertisement.  The film in and of itself is remarkably
well done, in an amateurish cinema verité method. Unfortunately,
the constant videotape use calls into question the rational of the
participants. Why would you continue filming yourself washing your
hand in a stream to remove the blood from it, as it revolts you. Most
people would at least put the camera down (or drop it). But not
Heather, she is the consummate filmmaker. Willing to die (literally)
for her art. The use of the actors themselves as the camera men is not
so revolutionary, having been used to frightening effect in the little
seen film "THE LAST BROADCAST" (1998). The mock documentary style has
been a staple of Italian gore/cannibal films since the early 70's. But
what makes the 'Blair Witch' so involuntary is that there seems to be
no real direction of the actors. One does buy into the mythology after
a while, and being so immersed in this universe, can help but be
dragged along.</P>
<P>As a horror film, "The Blair Witch Project" is unique in that at a
time when prosthetic effects and cosmetics have become so realistic,
this film eschews them in favor of the old Val Lewton approach. What
you don't see is psychologically more terrifying than anything
visual. Your imagination can fill in the blanks much more clearly than
any effects master could. The Mise-En-Scéne of the woods decorated
with the totems hanging from every branch is remarkably foreboding,
giving the viewer a level of unease that cannot be easily shaken
off. Also the music by Tony Cora is along the lines of the subtle
tones and noises used in Tobe Hooper's 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre',
(another film that plumped the psychological well for it's
effectiveness)</P>
<P>Now, let's get one thing straight. No one really died here. In fact
Michael Williams is currently working on another film (a big budget
item). Heather has also been cast in another project. These young
people are professional actors.  The mythology of the 'Blair Witch' is
a complete fabrication. This is the stuff of urban legends. We've all
heard stories of headless ghosts wandering through wooden glades, or
businesses built on possible Indian (or Spanish) burial ground. All
nice little stories to help the kids get a poor night's sleep.  What
Directors Daniel Myrick & Eduardo Sánchez have done here is create
a marvelously deft psychological test for the masses. Without the
attentive mythology and aggressive hype, their film would not be
anywhere near as accessible or successful.</P>
<P>On it's own; the film is painfully slow. There is far too much 'shaky
cam' work being done, giving many viewers a disorienting
experience. For the most part this works in raising expectations from
the viewers that something is about to happen. The film is riff with
false starts. While the editing is remarkable efficient, it sometimes
works against itself, as whenever we jump from video to 16 millimeter
film and back within a short scene. But again, this has the desired
neurological effect of persuading the viewer. The film almost becomes
an inkblot or Thematic Apperception Test with it's continual viewing
of the woods, especially at night when the lack of light and
preponderance of shadow creates it's own images. Most interesting of
all is that the film is presented in an aspect ratio of 1.33:1,
basically the same ratio as your television set. This gives the film
another level of psychological immediacy, making the film seem
real. We're used to seeing films projected on a big, wide screen. This
film instead creates a field of view that is limited from the start,
as the peripheral area of the screen is blank. Whether this film will
work as well on home video is a question that waits to be answered.</P>
<P>This is a hard film to review. One cannot separate the promotion of
the film from the film itself. They are so intertwined with one
another as to be symbiotic, feeding off of each other. It will be
interesting to see the promotion that is used to market the film's
video release.</P>
<P>So on a scale of one to five stars, "The Blair Witch Project" gets two
ratings.  The film itself gets only 2½.  But the promotion,
mythology and film together get a 4. "The Blair Witch Project" is not
so much a film, as it is what the title really implies. It is a
PROJECT!</P>
