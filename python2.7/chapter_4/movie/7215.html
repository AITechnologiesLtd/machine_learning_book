<P>    CRASH is about a bunch of over-sexed Canucks who get their jollies
from colliding cars.  Yup, it's explicit.  Yup, it's vintage David
Cronenberg, with all those scars and wounds and reshaped flesh.  As a
study of sexual fetishes, though, the story needs at least *some* sem-
blance of a reality base.  (And, perhaps, an explanation of why there
are no such things as traffic cops in Canada.) We're thrown into a world
of weird people doing weird things and, without even a remote sense of
which way is up, it's nearly impossible to get oriented enough to get
involved.  Winner of a Special Jury Prize at last year's Cannes Film
Festival.</P>

<PRE>Notes
=====</PRE>
<P>    CRASH was screened at the Rialto, in Raleigh.  We were greeted by
the sweet smell of sawdust, from the previous day's installation of a
brand-spanking-new screen.  And, oh, doesn't that Dolby Digital system
sound good on the trailer for SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW?</P>
