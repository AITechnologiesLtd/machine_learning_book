<P>First he wrote a book about it. Then Bob Dylan wrote a critically 
acclaimed song about it. Now Academy Award winning director Norman 
Jewison and Academy Award winning actor Denzel Washington have a made a 
movie about it. The man is Rubin "Hurricane" Carter and the story is one 
of such power that it puts the knock-out punches he delivered as a prize 
fighter to shame.</P>
<P>"Here comes the story of the hurricane." (Did you really think I would 
make it through this review without quoting Bob Dylan?) Rubin Carter 
(Denzel Washington) was the champion of the world, having lost but a 
handful of fights and delivering forceful flurries of punches that would 
floor his opponents. But he was also black, something that didn't 
stand well in the eyes of a certain police officer (Dan Hedaya). When 
two black men wreak murderous havoc on a bar one night in the 1960's, 
Hurricane and another man soon find themselves in prison for a crime 
they didn't commit. The film ventures away from the other man and 
focuses on Hurricane; his way of coping with prison ("innocence is 
highly overrated commodity"); his refusal to give in ("I've committed 
no crime. A crime has been committed against me") and his eventually 
giving up ("I'm dead. Just bury me please"). Then, when hope was all 
but lost, a young and once underprivileged black boy, being raised and 
schooled by an upper-middle class Canadian family, stumbled upon the 
aforementioned autobiography. With the help of his new Canadian family, 
Lesra Martin (Vicellous Reon Shannon) looks to free the champion of the 
world in the biggest fight Hurricane will ever step into .</P>
<P>The Hurricane spends little time on Rubin Carter's childhood and 
instead focuses intensely on the very interesting time he spent in the 
boxing ring, in prison and in court. Boxing brings enjoyable sporting 
moments, while prison offers deep intellectual insights and court 
provides (SPOLER!!!) a heartbreak early-on and a sure-to-make-you-smile 
moment at the film's end.</P>
<P>Most of the film is spent in prison, however. Recently, The Green Mile 
painted a particularly rosy and black and white view of jail with 
extraordinarily kind guards and inmates minus the few rotten apples who 
are 100% rotten. Here things are more complex: some guards are nice, 
some are cruel and one particularly kind inmate professes wicked ways. 
But Hurricane isolates himself from the beginning when he gets 90 days 
in the hole for refusing to wear prison-issued garments.</P>
<P>Denzel Washington gives yet another kick-ass performance in a year when 
many great acting jobs will unfortunately lack recognition due to high 
quantity. The supporting cast also comes up strong with Dan Hedaya as a 
bigoted police officer and youngster Vicellous Reon Shannon as a 
curiosity driven, justice seeking boy in the champ's corner.</P>
<P>Simply put, The Hurricane is a knock-out punch.</P>
