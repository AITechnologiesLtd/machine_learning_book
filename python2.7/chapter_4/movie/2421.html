<P>     Mike Leigh has always been known as a creator of exceptional,
insightful character studies.  Often, his films do little more than
trace activities in the life of a person or persons over a several-day
period--that he manages to make such seemingly-mundane stories so
involving speaks highly of his talent.  However, whereas comedies such
as LIFE IS SWEET and HIGH HOPES showed Mr. Leigh's whimsical side,
NAKED is anything but charming.  This film is brutal and raw, and its
sense of humor comes with a serrated edge.</P>
<P>     We meet Johnny (David Thewlis) on the benighted streets of
Manchester, pinning a woman against a building as he rapes her.  Then,
threatened with bodily harm, Johnny takes off for London, to find his
old girlfriend Louise (Lesley Sharp).  Their reunion is
less-than-affectionate, and propels Johnny into a violent and
self-destructive sexual relationship with Louise's flatmate Sophie
(Katrin Cartlidge).  It doesn't take long for Johnny to start feeling
trapped by his new lover's unexpected dependence, and he takes to the
streets, wandering through the backways and alleys of the city's
underprivileged districts (where a rat is always less than thirty feet
away), meeting an assortment of people even more bizarre than himself.</P>
<P>     There are so many thought-provoking themes and issues addressed by
NAKED, that it's impossible to mention them all, let alone do them
justice, in the space of a movie review.  Johnny, who may have the
appearance of a tramp, has the heart and mind of a philosopher, and
isn't afraid to express his views.  In line after line of energetic,
dazzling dialogue delivered at a rapid-fire pace, we are exposed to the
lead character's views on why everyone is bored; the importance of
cliches; the interrelationship between the past, present, and future;
the Apocalypse; evolution; God's relationship to man; and life in
general.  He's not particularly choosey about his listeners, entering
into conversations with the vacuous Sophie, a middle-class guard named
Brian (Peter Wight), a lonely woman who he initially observes from afar
through a window, and a man putting up posters.</P>
<P>     A reckless, restless intensity pervades NAKED as it follows Johnny
on his odyssey through London.  The film's mood and tone change
suddenly and frequently, but never radically.  It could be argued that
the running length is a little on the long side, but it's hard to
figure which scenes could have been cut.</P>
<P>     Don't expect a happy ending, or a happy anything, for that
matter.  As true-to-life as NAKED is, it hides nothing.  Brutality
abounds, from the thugs that attack innocent pedestrians on nighttime
streets to the hidden lifestyle of the rich Jeremy (Greg Cruttwell),
whose sadistic sexual excesses are presented in such a manner as to
leave little to the imagination.</P>
<P>     David Thewlis didn't get his deserved Oscar nomination, but his
work here is extraordinary, and possibly better than that of any of the
five nominees (including Anthony Hopkins).  Mr. Thewlis creates an
amazing character--someone with a keen intellect and ugly appetites,
who can be reviled, understood, and respected.  He and writer/director
Leigh have clearly established a rapport (they previously worked
together on LIFE IS SWEET and a Channel Four short film THE SHORT AND
CURLIES) that yields astounding results.</P>
<P>     NAKED is one of those rare, powerful motion pictures that refuses
to slip easily from memory.  Its images and themes linger long after
the viewer has left the theater, and the most stark of these are
commonly the most disturbing.  Those in search of escapism should not
look to this motion picture, but anyone willing to assume the risk of
facing the ugliness of Johnny's world will find a startling,
gut-wrenching, eye-opening film.</P>
