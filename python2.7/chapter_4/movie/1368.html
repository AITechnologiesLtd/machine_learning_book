<PRE>                               LETHAL WEAPON 3
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1992 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     LETHAL WEAPON 3 is a film directed by Richard Donner, written by
Jeffrey Boam.  It stars Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Rene Russo, Joe Pesci,
and Stuart Wilson.  Rated R, for violence and profanity.</P>
<P>     LETHAL WEAPON 3 is the latest installment in the highly profitable
series that teams Mel Gibson and Danny Glover as cops, buddies, and a
union of opposites.  The formula has been milked again in a cynical,
mechanistic, and pointless way that is at the same time the very epitome
of the art of the Hollywood movie.  The highest levels of
professionalism here are thrown away again and again in the pursuit of a
mindless entertainment.  It succeeds in doing exactly what it sets out
to do; millions will flock to see it and walk out satisfied and replete.
It is my unhappy fate to be no longer able to be cajoled by this
particular machine.  I have enjoyed the earlier installments, although
the second less so than the original; I wanted to enjoy this one, but
for the most part I found myself uninvolved and distantly removed from
the fast-paced action, the mayhem, the ludicrous story, the male
bonding, certainly from the low-level homophobic jokes, from the love
stories (man meets dog, man meets sergeant), the multiple and
violent--but poetically justifiable--deaths, the tightly edited fights
and shoot-outs.  It was all so perfunctory, so antiseptic, so unhuman.</P>
<P>     Of course, one has to admire the many skills so willingly exercised
in pursuit of ticket sales; these are men and women who know exactly
what they want and how to get it.  They are whores, but they are
handsomely paid whores.</P>
<P>     For one example, take the presence of Joe Pesci in this movie.
Pesci's here because he was the best thing about LETHAL WEAPON 2.  He
has nothing to do with the story; in fact, the script expends what
little cleverness it possesses in finding ways to get Pesci out of the
way.  His is not a character, it's a marketing ploy (as Jeff Shannon
remarked in the Seattle Times).  He's about as functional as the opening
scene's exploding (imploding?) building; we've been seeing that in
trailers for months, it links to the exploding toilet opener in the
earlier installment; it makes no sense and has nothing to do with
anything that follows, but as a marketing device it is so successful
that it is reprised after the credits with another one.</P>
<P>     For another example, the stars cannot help but impress with their
talent.  Mel Gibson as Riggs is as sexy and funny as ever he was.  He
knows how to have fun and how to share the fun with us, whether that fun
is kidding Murtaugh his partner, risking his life in another grandstand
play, or seducing a guard dog or another (female) cop.  He does lose me,
a little, when he stops having his fun and tries to be honest, tender,
and caring; he has a scene with Murtaugh that is faintly embarrassing
for its paint-by-numbers approach to emotional honesty, as well as its
bottled-in-bond approach to men loving men.</P>
<P>     Gibson has a scene with Rene Russo in which these two, who begin as
adversaries-by-default--one of the hoarier cliches in cop movies--are
one-upping each other in the display of battle scars.  Never mind that
this scene was played out with more stripping and less sex in MOUNTAINS
OF THE MOON between Patrick Bergin as Sir Richard Burton and Bernard
Hill as Dr. Livingstone.  It is funny and sexy here, and fans of
underwear ads get a good peep at Gibson.  Russo is, in fact, the
freshest, most interesting element in this movie.  She's tough and
brutal; naturally, Riggs is going to be attracted to her.  They have a
pretty good scene in a men's room, too.  If there's a LETHAL WEAPON 4
(and who is so bold as to rule that out?), I look to Russo to get more
air time, to be finessed into a new partnership with Riggs.</P>
<P>     Mel's scene with the killer dog is almost as funny a seduction, by
the way, as his scene with Russo.  If not quite as believable.</P>
<P>     Danny Glover as Murtaugh presents a problem to a disgruntled
reviewer.  Glover has presence, there's no mistaking it.  He lends
dignity and weight to even the fluffiest role merely by taking it.
Murtaugh is not a challenging characterization for Danny Glover, but he
manages to make the character more impressive than he ought to be.  The
role is as mechanical as Gibson's.  The bonding scene is just as phony
from Murtaugh's side.  But Glover can kid us into accepting fluff for
substance and that is a major skill.  He pushes buttons, Murtaugh's and
ours.</P>
<P>     The entire movie is a matter of very sharp people pushing buttons.
I keep thinking of the scene in THE PLAYER about getting rid of the
writers.  Just plug in the formulas.  It's all the same, ain't it?  The
point is selling tickets, right?  LETHAL WEAPON 3 is a monster of
efficiency; most of the people who see it will love it; ticket sales
will exceed the GNPs of many third-world countries; everyone is happy.
Forget that everyone in the movie is prostituting him or herself.
Forget that everyone in the audience is the john.  The pace is
everything; keep up the pace and we will never have to think about any
of this.</P>
<P>     I am really sorry to go on like this.  But it is so disheartening
to see the waste, the cynicism of turning intelligence and talent into
machinery.  And for those of you who will write "Get a life.  This is
just a movie."  You are right, of course.  I should just plug myself
into my slot and surrender to the wonder of it all.  I regret that I
cannot do that any more.</P>
<P>     If you're of a mind to, you will enjoy LETHAL WEAPON 3.  As Euell
Gibbons used to say when he prostituted himself for a cereal commercial:
"Many parts are edible."  I won't recommend it, however; I won't need
to.  Some of you will not be able to stay away, and why should you?</P>
