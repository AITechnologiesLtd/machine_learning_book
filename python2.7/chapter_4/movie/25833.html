<P>This movie was doubly interesting to watch for me since I was one of the few
to see an early test screening of the film back in January. The original cut
of the film that I was shown didn't include any special effects, lacked a
score and needed a bit of tightening up. All in all, it was an okay popcorn
flick, and after having seen the completed version, I must say that I stick
close to my original interpretation of the film. It doesn't cut into any new
ground, gets a little convoluted and serious at times, but overall, gives us
plenty of action for the sake of action, and if that's what you're looking
for, you will likely get a pop out of this corn.</P>
<P>PLOT:
An undercover UN agent who is an expert at expediting "international
relations" gets caught in over his head when a Chinese ambassador's
assassination leaves him as the ultimate fall guy. Running away from
everyone including the Chinese triad and the FBI, the fugitive hooks up with
a translator girl who attempts to help him find the real masterminds behind
the slaying, and clear him of all wrong-doings.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Despite its pretentious title, convoluted plot and overly serious tone, I
chose to enjoy this film as an action-packed popcorn ride starring badass
Wesley Snipes kicking butt all over the place, and by God...it worked! I do
wish they would have cut about 20 minutes from this film and maybe even cut
some of its dreary political dialogue, but I liked the movie despite some of
its shortcomings, because it delivered a typically intense Snipes as a
pretty cool James Bond/Ethan Hunt wannabe. So don't go into this movie
expecting an terribly interesting plot (you forget it all minutes after you
walk out of the theatre), Oscar-caliber acting (Anne Archer walking the fine
line between acting and over-acting) or unpredictable happenings (I guessed
the "bad guy" about 12 minutes into the film). Go into this movie with the
intention of seeing some pretty cool action scenes, plenty of gun play,
Wesley kick-boxing everybody in sight and Maury Chaykin thankfully present
as the much needed "comic relief".</P>
<P>This film is violent, packs a punch and doesn't really let up, save for a
couple of downtimes in the middle. The director's style is slick, very
lively, a man who obviously enjoys the over-the-head shots and doesn't mind
utilizing the infamous MATRIX bullet zoom effect for added wattage either.
The high tech game is another one that generally appeals to me, so enjoy I
did the many cooky technological gadgeteries utilized by Snipes in his
pursuit of the bad guys. It's funny because I actually feel like I'm
defending this movie in my review and I guess that could only mean one
thing...yup, guilty-pleasure syndrome!! Perhaps it's because I know that
deep-down inside the film won't hold up under closer scrutiny, doesn't leave
much room for unpredictability and washes its clothes in the same machine as
many of the others, but what can I tell you...I enjoyed it! So if action is
what you're looking for, this flick should just about cover your bases. And
the reason I haven't mentioned either Michael Biehn or Donald Sutherland in
this review is because either one doesn't really have much to do in this
film. But love it or leave it, I think we can all agree that Wesley Snipes
is one charismatic actor who continues to hold your attention, no matter
what the circumstances. And the Art of this Review is coming up with a
typically idiotic play on the title way of finishing it off... :)</P>
