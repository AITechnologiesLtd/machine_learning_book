<P>THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT does for sex magazine publishers
more or less what ED WOOD did for bad filmmakers.</P>
<P>That is to say, it's a whitewash. But what a charming
whitewash, and for what a good cause. THE PEOPLE VS.
LARRY FLYNT is an epic American saga, the tale of a young
entrepreneur (er, strip club owner) who starts his own
publishing venture (er, Hustler magazine) to forge a place in
American discourse for his own home-spum philosophy (his
principal contribution to the visual grammar of pornography
seems to have been the "beaver shot"). The theatrical trailer
promotes this one as a drama, and the newest TV spots present
it as a comedy, and they're both right. Much of LARRY FLYNT
has a cheerily surreal bent to it, which actually enhances
the impact of the stuff that's played straight. It's far from
the last word on free speech and dirty magazines, but LARRY
FLYNT scores points for engaging the issues in the first
place.</P>
<P>After an odd, mannered prologue showing young Larry's
beginnings as a Kentucky hillbilly, the movie concentrates on
his rise from Ohio strip-club owner to Los Angeles publishing
magnate. He begins publishing the Hustler newsletter to
promote his clubs, and stakes all his savings on turning the
modest handout into a nationally distributed magazine. The
first issue tanks disgracefully, but just when all seems
lost, Flynt comes into possession of nude snapshots of Jackie
Onassis sunning herself on a Mediterranean vacation. Sales go
through the roof, and Hustler becomes an American
institution.</P>
<P>The movie has conflict -- Flynt's efforts run afoul of local
authorities, and he will eventually wind up in the Supreme
Court, appealing a lower court's judgment against him for
publishing a satirical ad suggesting that Jerry Falwell had
sex with his mother. The movie has romance -- Flynt falls in
love with the grungy-gorgeous Althea Leasure, a new face in
his club who turns out to be a more savvy publisher than
Flynt himself. And it has tragedy -- overzealous prosecuting
attorneys drag Flynt through the judicial mud, a
fundamentalist sniper puts him in a wheelchair for the rest
of his days, and his lovely Althea turns out to be a diseased
junkie, unable to kick the same painkillers that eased
Flynt's unbearable paralysis.</P>
<P>Terrific performances, sharp direction, and broad comedy --
THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT has everything except a 
sense of why Flynt has been so reviled, and what drove him on in the
face of revulsion. As played by Woody Harrelson, Flynt is no
traditional hero, but he's not really an object of scorn,
either. When he explains that a Hustler front-cover image of
a woman's naked body being fed through a meat grinder --
probably the most effective image ever co-opted by the
anti-porn movement -- is meant as a symbol of his born-again
sensitivities (he was briefly converted after having dinner
with then-President Jimmy Carter's sister, Ruth Carter
Stapleton), it's hard to tell whether the movie is taking him
at his word or if it's just unwilling to call its protagonist
on the carpet for using misogyny to sell magazines.</P>
<P>It's easy to take a perverse delight in watching Flynt wheel
around the bedroom of his Bel-Air mansion, watching on
security cameras as federal marshals swarm the building after
he releases a videotape of the FBI's cocaine sting operation
against John DeLorean. And no matter how lowbrow Flynt's
sense of comedy, it's hard to fault him for dragging the
beatific Falwell portrayed here (by Richard Paul) through the
mud. Even when Flynt hurls invective and vegetables at a
judge from his wheelchair, he's not much more offensive than
your crazy Grandpa (his speech impediment makes him talk like
Jimmy Stewart). Only in one scene, where Flynt delivers a
sermon of sorts in front of a giant screen montage
alternating naked girls with wartime atrocities, does the
film really suggest that he may be as looney as the opposing
forces.</P>
<P>Courtney Love is marvelous. In the film's early scenes, she
plays a worldy stripper who nicely balances Flynt's lack of
grace. Later, when she portrays the shambling wreck that
echoes some pointed media coverage of her own life, she
doesn't embarrass herself. Oliver Stone has described her
casting as "the great battle of this picture," but how much
riskier is it to cast Love as Flynt's wife than to cast, say,
Madonna as Eva Peron? Her haunting, girlish performance
doesn't quite deliver on the same level as her songwriting
(Hole's 1994 LIVE THROUGH THIS was an astonishing album), 
but it's a remarkable debut, and she'll likely earn the respect
of even those who can't stand her music.</P>
<P>Edward Norton is nearly as good in the pivotal role of Alan
Isaacman, Flynt's longtime attorney (in the movie, the
character is actually a conglomeration of different real-life
lawyers including Isaacman) who explains to the Supreme Court
-- and thus to the movie's audience -- why even lowbrow
speech deserves full Constitutional protection. Bright and
savvy to a fault, Norton almost helps us forget that he's
preaching to us in a scene that could easily have fallen flat
on its face. But after Norton articulates the argument in
response to probing questions from the justices, the court's
unanimous decision in favor of Flynt really feels like a
triumph.</P>
<P>Cameos by political strategist James Carville, TV journalist
Donna Hanover (who happens to be Mrs. Rudy Giuliani), a
Memphis judge, an NYU law professor, and Flynt himself (as a
Cincinatti judge) add character to this free speech circus,
which is part historical drama and part broad satire. I guess
I prefer my satire a little more narrow, since I would rather
have seen a lot less of the Jerry Falwell impersonator. And a
reference to infamous financial shyster Charles Keating would
have seemed a slyer commentary on "decent" citizenry had the
point not been hammered home with an insert of the guy's name
tag in close-up. Too often, LARRY FLYNT nudges your shoulder,
making sure you "get it."</P>
<P>But for the most part, Milos Forman proves himself once again
to be a skillful director who guides winning performances and
makes the most of his well-chosen material without
overpowering it -- certainly this production breaks ranks
with his previous films. More than AMADEUS or ONE FLEW 
OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, LARRY FLYNT is of a piece with 
ED WOOD, the previous film from screenwriters Scott Alexander 
and Larry Karaszewski. Both films romanticize their protagonists,
but ED WOOD clicked as Tim Burton's valentine to a
down-on-his-luck ancestor. LARRY FLYNT has no such sense of
closure. Instead, the film offers congratulations to the
First Amendment. Poets and pornographers alike, Forman wants
to say, we're all in this together.</P>
<P>On the one hand, the film goes to great lengths to distance
itself from Flynt's accomplishments. "I don't like what Larry
Flynt does," Isaacman tells a courtroom at one point in the
film. "I never bought Hustler, and I doubt I ever will,"
Forman says in the press kit. But on the other, the movie
never shows us what was so distasteful about the magazine.
Shots from your typical Hustler pictorial would likely earn
this movie an NC-17, but when Harrelson's Flynt breaks
taboos, it's in a playful way. In one scene, he urges a model
to spread her legs a little wider. Althea playfully suggests
sexualizing THE WIZARD OF OZ. Flynt publishes a cartoon
featuring Santa Claus sporting a gigantic erection. And so it
goes. Still, there must have been more to Hustler than that.</P>
<P>Flynt's whole career seems to be predicated on his feeling
that the working class deserves pornography without
pretension -- "Playboy," he anounces to a roomful of
compatriots, "is mocking you." But the film never expands on
those feelings in any meaningful way, and the early scenes
speed by without showing us enough of that feisty, subversive
spirit. "All I wanted to do was make some money and have some
fun," Flynt has said, and the movie seems willing to leave it
at that. And maybe that's the point -- whether Flynt was a
hero, a pioneer, or simply a coarse nut job, whether there
were any principles at all behind his endeavors, he's one of
the people who's helped make this country great.<HR>Directed by Milos Forman
