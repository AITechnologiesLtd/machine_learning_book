<PRE>ANASTASIA</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by David Thompsen
Copyright 1997 by David Thompsen</PRE>
<PRE>Rating : ** OUT OF *****</PRE>
<P>Walt Disney studios may have finally met its match with the lush animation
in Twentieth Century Fox's ANASTASIA. But judging by the latest efforts from
the Don Bluth studios, the visuals are the only thing Fox has to brag about.</P>
<P>Disney's recent classics have occasionally stretched credibility in such
films as POCAHONTAS, THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, and to a lesser extent,
HERCULES.  With ANASTASIA, Fox has gone so far as to throw all facts
completely out the window. Some may say - So what? It's just a kid's movie.
Well... if you have young kids, beware, as they may be noticeably frightened
by the visuals of a corpse-rotting Rasputin zombie, whose body parts
continually fall off in a disconcertingly real way. Consider yourselves
warned.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, the animation is quite stunning at times. Don Bluth has used
computer animation extensively throughout, occasionally rivalling
photographic quality.  And yet in other scenes, the hand-drawn material
seems of the Saturday-morning TV crowd, which leads me to wonder... was this
rushed to market to combat Disney?</P>
<P>The plot, as anyone who had read history before knows, concerns the attempt
to return Anastasia to her royal family after she was lost in the overthrow
of the Romanovs in 1916.  Not that ANASTASIA is much concerned with what
really happened.  As for the plot --- Go rent Disney's CANDLESHOE.  You'll
see 60% of ANASTASIA there.</P>
