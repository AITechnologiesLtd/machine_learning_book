<P>The Truman Show (written by Andrew Niccol, directed by Peter Weir, 1998)</P>
<P>I have long waited for Jim Carrey to be perfectly cast, hoping I could
see some glimmer of what other people find entertaining in his rubber
face and foolish antics.  I had thought it would have been as the
Riddler in BATMAN FOREVER, inasmuch as the best actor to play the most
obnoxious of villains should be the most obnoxious of actors. 
Unfortunately, it worked only too well, as the Riddler was easily the
worst part of a film that disaster, a so-called film which probably had
the worst quality per dollar ever.  (And don't tell me BATMAN AND ROBIN,
so low in quality that it does not qualify as a movie.)  I couldn't even
bring myself to enjoy the scenes he had with Nicole Kidman, despite the
fact that Mrs. Cruise reigns supreme as My Favorite Woman.</P>
<P>     But the appealing part of THE TRUMAN SHOW was director Peter Weir,
a director with a soul which makes movies like DEAD POETS SOCIETY and
WITNESS better than they have any right to be.  I can just see studio
executives happily chomping on cigars, declaring, "We'll get Peter
Weir!", because after all, Weir directed Robin Williams in his first
dramatic role, forgetting that Williams by that time had more than
proven that he had something which has hitherto been lacking from
Carrey's work:  talent.</P>
<P>     Furthermore, Esquire's David Thomson had assured us that THE TRUMAN
SHOW was "the movie of the decade".  When David Thomson speaks, I
listen, and assume nine times out of ten that the opposite is true. 
Thomson has the inimitable quality of drowning his reviews in his
intelligence and candor, disguising the fact that he more often than not
cannot tell a good movie from a bad one.  But before one discounts a man
who says THE SEARCHRES is practically John Ford's only good film, that
THE SHINING is Kubrick's only, and that Brian DePalma hates his talent,
one must realize that when David Thomson is right, he is usually very
right.</P>
<P>     In the case of THE TRUMAN SHOW, he is almost right.  Just because
the film is not really the movie of the decade or even the movie of the
year does not mean that it is not an excellent film, for it is.  Flaws
are minor, while design and execution are near perfect.  Weir and
screenwriter Andrew Niccol (who made a similar yet less accomplished
film in last year's underappreciated GATTACA) have crafted a pristine
postmodern fantasy world with only a few holes, which do not become
obvious until consideration later.</P>
<P>     THE TRUMAN SHOW is at least the third film this year about an
elaborate con setup, following Alex Proyas' DARK CITY and David Mamet's
THE SPANISH PRISONER.  (One could argue for PRIMARY COLORS, but there is
little focus on the victims of the political con.)  Proyas' film serves
for a more direct comparison, as both films are about characters in
artificial world of which they become gradually more aware.  Both films
were created by soulful Australian directors (though Niccol hails from
New Zealand).  Both films also have the same failing, which is to say
the ending.  Though THE TRUMAN SHOW does not sink to the sappy humanism
of DARK CITY, the ending is forced, and capped by a line of dialogue for
which there is no need.</P>
<P>     THE TRUMAN SHOW is rightly less sinister than Mamet's film.  While
Mamet takes on the menacing idea that all people are acting and no one
is what they seem, Weir and Niccol show us that the postmodern age is
not necessarily sinister; it just is.  It is less sinister because a
sympathetic face is given to the manipulator:  the always solid Ed
Harris plays Truman's creator, Christof.  And just because THE TRUMAN
SHOW falls short of making a lasting impact on its audience does not
preclude it from being enjoyable.  The ending turns away from a
statement, a statement which the film indicates need be there and then
never provides.  Nonetheless, Weir and Niccol have taken great pleasure
in creating Truman's world, and its imaginative flourishes provide the
film's best moments.</P>
<P>     And what of Jim Carrey?  Though he may be awarded an Academy
nomination, reports of Best Actor have been greatly exaggerated.  Which
is not to say that he is bad, for in this film he is not.  A minor flaw
in the Truman Burbank persona is that though he is supposed to be the
most real figure in an artificial world, he is its most fantastic.  Yet
on most occasions, the Carrey on the screen is actually Truman Burbank.
Occasionally, as in the disastrous last line, he is actually playing Jim
Carrey.  But then again, that may be the point.  The film shirks when it
comes time for an answer, but at least it dares the question:  in the
postmodern world, who can tell the difference?</P>
