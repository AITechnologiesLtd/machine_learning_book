<PRE>Lock, Stock And Two Hands?  </PRE>
<P>The gritty urban crime thriller is one genre that Australian
film makers have rarely tackled, and not very well at that.  Tyro
feature film director Gregor Jordan is to be congratulated for not
only treading a path less well worn, but for also carrying it off
beautifully.  Two Hands follows the same irreverent, jokey and blokey
approach that worked so appealingly with last year's hit British
thriller Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels.  However, Jordan
carefully steers away from too much gratuitous violence and deftly
avoids the misogynistic touches of that film.</P>
<P>Rising young Aussie star Heath Ledger, recently seen in the
enjoyable if formulaic teen comedy 10 Things I Hate About You, brings
plenty of charm and sex appeal to the film.  He plays Jimmy, a naive
youth who works as a doorman at a Sydney strip club.  But Jimmy has
aspirations of making it big through mutual connections with Pando
(Bryan Brown), the unforgiving villain who rules Sydney's Kings Cross
area.  He finally gets his chance when Pando offers him an opportunity
to prove himself.  All Jimmy has to do is drop off $10,000 at a flat.</P>
<P>But complications quickly set in.  Thinking that no-one is
home, Jimmy goes to the beach to fill in time before trying again.
While he is swimming, two homeless kids snatch the money.  Jimmy is in
deep trouble as Pando is out for his blood.  His only hope of
salvation lies in replacing the money, and quickly.  Which is how he
comes to be involved in a bank robbery, organised by his sister-in-law
(Susie Porter, from the awful Welcome To Woop Woop, etc) and the
incompetent Wozza (Steve Le Marquand).</P>
<P>The various characters continually cross paths and interact
with each other on an inevitable collision course that will end in
death and violence.  Jordan has a razor sharp writing style, and
brings touches of black comedy to the energetic plot.  He directs with
remarkable assurance and confidence, and also keeps the action moving
at a rapid pace.  Jordan makes good use of Sydney's streets and the
sleazy, neon drenched area of King's Cross, giving the film a sense of
realism.</P>
<P>The characters are well-drawn and brought to life by a cast
attuned to the nuances of the script.  Jordan draws a wonderfully
menacing performance from Brown, an often wooden performer.  Brown
actually looks like he's enjoying himself with his role here and he
seems far more comfortable than he did in the recent, embarrassingly
awful Dear Claudia.  Ledger confirms his status as the next Australian
to hit it big on the international scene with his confident and brash
performance here.</P>
<P>The only weak point of the film is the creaky device centring
around the almost supernatural character of the dead man (Steven
Vidler), who acts as a narrator and moral conscience of the story.</P>
<P>Fast-paced, action-packed and immensely enjoyable, Two Hands
is easily one of the most exciting and entertaining locally produced
films for quite some time.</P>
