<P>     In his last film, 1993's THE METEOR MAN, director Robert Townsend 
(THE FIVE HEARTBEATS) simultaneously paid homage to and satirized comic 
book superheroes.  This time out, he's attempting to do much the same 
thing with fairy tales.  Or, more precisely, with one fairy tale -- that 
of "Cinderella."  Only here, instead of glass slippers, horse-drawn 
carriages, and prince charming, we have stiletto heels, Rolls Royces, 
and a genial, terminally ill gent played by Oscar winner Martin Landau.</P>
<P>     B.A.P.S. (which stands for "black American princesses") is a 
lightweight, minimally entertaining piece which represents a marginal 
improvement over THE METEOR MAN.  The film is severely flawed (due 
primarily to a shocking lack of imagination and creativity), but it is 
more watchable than this year's other would-be modern-day fairy tale, 
Fran Drescher's awful THE BEAUTICIAN AND THE BEAST.  In B.A.P.S., at 
least some of the jokes are funny and the serious moments aren't 
galling.</P>
<P>     The premise of this film is, as you might expect, rather thin.  The 
main characters are two young black women of little note whose dreams 
are wasting away in their home town of Decatur, Georgia.  Nisi (Halle 
Berry with blonde hair and gold-capped teeth) and Mickey (newcomer 
Natalie Desselle) hope one day to be able to open a combined beauty 
salon/restaurant, but, in order to do so, they need a lot of money.  So, 
when they spy an ad for the "Video Dance Girl of the World" contest 
(first prize: $10,000), they ditch their do-nothing boyfriends and hop 
on a plane to L.A.  But, although they lose the contest, they catch the 
eyes of a couple of con men who offer them $10,000 plus room and board 
in an East Beverly Hills mansion if they'll be nice to dying Mr. 
Blakemore (Martin Landau).  The butler, a crusty British type named 
Manley (Ian Richardson) is suspicious of them, and watches their every 
move like a hawk.</P>
<P>     While I realize that the plot of B.A.P.S. is designed as nothing 
more than a frame for jokes and gags, it still annoys me when any film 
proceeds along such dull and predictable lines.  Would it have been that 
difficult to inject something new or moderately adventurous into the 
film?  Instead, what we get is a double variation of the fish out of 
water scenario folded into the "Cinderella" envelope.  While Nisi and 
Mickey struggle to find their footing in the aristocratic world of 
Beverly Hills (there's an obligatory bidet scene that's supposed to be a 
lot funnier than it actually is), butler Manley learns to let down his 
hair.  We've seen it all before.</P>
<P>     At least the cast is mostly solid.  Martin Landau's abilities are 
sorely wasted here, but the other three principals are used to good 
effect.  Halle Berry, despite the distracting hair color, is her usual 
affable self, making Nisi a great deal more likable than she probably 
was on paper.  Ian Richardson, the terrific British actor whose career 
role was that of the deliciously despicable Francis Urquhart in three 
mini-series (HOUSE OF CARDS, TO PLAY THE KING, and THE FINAL CUT), is 
perfectly cast as the snobbish butler.  The humor in the Manley-goes-
shopping-for-rap-CDs is due entirely to Richardson's no-nonsense 
performance.  Finally, there's first-timer Natalie Desselle, who has the 
comic energy and physical presence of a young Nell Carter.  </P>
<P>     Townsend elected to shoot the entire film using a soft focus 
technique that creates an omnipresent glow.  While this emphasizes the 
fairy tale quality of the story, it does little to hide the deficiencies 
of Troy Beyer's flimsy script.  An interesting cast is only half the 
battle, and, from the moment he chose such a derivative screenplay, the 
director lost the other half.  The best Townsend can do with B.A.P.S. is 
go for cheap, easy laughs (the aforementioned bidet scene being a good 
example of this).  Paying movie-goers deserve more, especially from 
someone who has previously shown signs of genuine comic aptitude. </P>
