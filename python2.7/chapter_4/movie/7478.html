<P>Romy and Michele's High School Reunion (R) *** (out of ****)</P>
<P>Take arguably the funniest dumb blonde on TV (Lisa Kudrow), pair her
with the most memorable dumb blonde in recent film (Mira Sorvino), and you
get the irreverent, loopy, and entertaining new comedy Romy and Michele's
High School Reunion.</P>
<P>As can be expected, Sorvino, who won an Oscar for her Mighty
Aphrodite numskull hooker routine, and Kudrow, Emmy nominee for her work as
dullard songstress Phoebe on NBC's hit Friends, perfectly embody Romy White
and Michele Weinberger, respectively, a couple of aimless L.A. clubhopping
losers attend to their ten-year high school reunion in Tucson, Arizona.
These two can play this type of role in their sleep, but there's no question
that they play the part well.  How well?  Having two incredibly idiotic
people as the leads in a film has the potential to grow old really fast, but
Sorvino and Kudrow keep their characters consistently interesting and
likable throughout the film, never losing the audience's rooting interest;
they're just a lot of fun to hang around with.  The two have a natural
rapport, and their best moments come early in the film, as the
intelligence-impaired pair attempt to shape up their lives in time to brag
to their old enemies at the reunion.  Of course, their plan for
self-improvement doesn't work, and they instead decide to just pretend to be
successful, something much easier said than done.  Then again, for these
two, everything is much easier said than done.</P>
<P>Sorvino and Kudrow are on pitch-perfect target during the heart of
the film, the reunion itself, but the second half of Romy and Michele
belongs to neither Romy nor Michele.  It is clearly owned by Janeane
Garofalo, simply terrific as acid-tongued Heather Mooney, who was even more
of a social outcast in high school than Romy and Michele.  She has all the
best lines in Robin Schiff's amusing script, and her dry, nasty,
movie-stealing performance keeps the proceedings from becoming overly
saccharine and sweet--which, at times, it threatens to do, especially when
the high school snobs (led by a hissably bitchy Julia Campbell) get their
expected comeuppance.</P>
<P>First-time helmer David Mirkin, an executive producer on The
Simpsons, displays some of that series' witty, irreverent sense of humor in
this film, especially in a wildly unexpected plot curve midway through.  He
brings some refreshing visual flair to the obligatory high school flashback
scenes, which are presented as yearbook pictures come to life.  The '80s
soundtrack is also quite effectively used, not simply as nostalgia but also
as background score; for instance, Romy is belittled by people from the "A
crowd" as Bananarama's "Cruel Summer" plays in the background, and Belinda
Carlisle's "Heaven Is a Place on Earth" provides a perfect bubblegum
backdrop for our heroines' ultimate triumph.  Also, I don't think I'll ever
hear Cyndi Lauper's "Time After Time" in quite the same way after seeing
the--for lack of a better term--"unique" dance number it underscores.</P>
<P>Romy and Michele's High School Reunion gets the job done as popcorn
entertainment, but in the end I can't say that a whole lot really goes on in
its 90something minutes--ditzy Romy and Michele go to their reunion and get
their revenge--and the film is just about instantly forgettable.  But what
isn't forgettable are the characters: the main duo and, most of all, the
hilariously prickly Heather.  Sorvino and Kudrow have expressed a desire to
do a whole Romy and Michele series, but here's hoping they can get Garofalo
to join in on a series of Romy, Michele, and Heather flicks.</P>
