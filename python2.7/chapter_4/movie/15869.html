<P>"Stepmom," directed by Chris Columbus (1990's "Home Alone" and 1993's 
"Mrs. Doubtfire"), is an earnest and well-made film with, perhaps, one 
unfair flaw: It is very similar to the recent, and far superior, "One 
True Thing," starring Meryl Streep and Renee Zellweger. "One True Thing" 
was a more serious and seemingly accurate portrayal of a family coping 
with cancer, while "Stepmom" is a more sleek and "mainstream" motion 
picture. That is not to say it still isn't a marginally good film, 
however.</P>
<P>The film begins as Isabel (Julia Roberts), a young woman looking to be 
in her late 20's, is rushing around her house trying to get two 
children, 12-year-old Anna (Jena Malone) and 7-year-old Ben (Liam 
Aiken), off to school without much success. Before long, an older woman, 
Jackie (Susan Sarandon), shows up, and we learn that she is the 
children's actual mother, while Isabel lives with the children's father, 
Luke (Ed Harris), much to the spitefulness of Ben, and especially Anna. 
It is clear that Isabel is trying very hard to help take care of the 
children, but still has a lot to learn about parenting, and isn't helped 
very much by the uncooperation of the kids and Jackie, who obviously 
isn't too fond of Isabel, a woman whom she informs Luke, "is half his 
age." Meanwhile, as Isabel is trying to become friends with the 
children, Jackie learns that she has lymphatic cancer, and when all of 
her treatments fail to work, she decides that she has a lot of things to 
settle before she dies.</P>
<P>"Stepmom" follows a fairly predictable line throughout its 124-minute 
running time, but is helped immeasurably by the beautifully-done and 
touching performances from, particularly, Sarandon, Roberts, and Malone, 
a talented young actress who could very well be the next Jodie Foster 
(and, sure enough, she did play Foster as a child in 1997's "Contact"). 
The performers are so good, in fact, that they easily rise above the 
admittedly thin material and help make scene after scene their own. 
Sarandon, like always, is realistic and heartbreaking as a woman who 
realizes she has a lot of things she needs to do before the illness 
takes over her life; and Roberts gives one of her best performances to 
date, and smoothly is able to convey her character's frustration of 
becoming a second-rate parent who will never be able to equal up to the 
children's real mother. </P>
<P>Through the performances and screenplay, we often do get some extremely 
well-written and intelligent scenes. Particular sequences that stand out 
include a subtle, but observant scene where Isabel helps Anna with an 
art project; Isabel gives Anna advice about some boy troubles that she 
is having; a moving scene between Jackie and Luke at a restaurant; and a 
concluding scene set during Christmas between Jackie and her children. 
In the individual moments of accuracy and truthfulness, "Stepmom" is a 
suberb and nicely-drawn drama, but, unfortunately, there are a couple 
noticable problems.</P>
<P>For one, Isabel might be too ideal of a girlfriend and substitute 
parent. Scene after scene, we are shown how hard and diligently Isabel 
is working to care for Anna and Ben, but we are not really given a 
reason why this is. We are supposed to believe it is because Isabel 
truly loves Luke, but he is often out of the picture for long stretches 
of time, so much so that I found it hard to accept, later in the film, 
when one character observes how great of a parent he is. Meanwhile, 
sitting back watching the picture, I was thinking to myself that if he 
was such a "great" parent, why was he never watching his kids? The flaws 
of the Luke character come from that particular weak area in the script, 
and should not be blamed on Ed Harris, who is nonetheless good in the 
film, even if he is stuck with a largely underwritten role. Another 
problem, but to a lesser extent, are some subplots that are brought up 
but not resolved in any way, such as when Isabel is fired from her job 
as a photographer.</P>
<P>Even after taking into consideration the film's many missteps, "Stepmom" 
still remains a worthwhile and honest drama that is able to portray the 
many dilemmas a family often must go through. While a few moments seemed 
to strain for melodrama, they were able to look like prime examples of 
unstrained subtlety compared to a film opening on the same exact day, 
"Patch Adams," which was shameless in its quest for "heartwarming" 
(read: superficial) emotions. As said before, "Stepmom" is nowhere near 
as strong as "One True Thing," but the several top-notch performances and 
scenes were able to raise it above the level of mediocrity.</P>
