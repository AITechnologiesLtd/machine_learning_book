<P>GREASE
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****) 
Paramount / 1:50 / 1978 / PG (language, innuendo, brief nudity)
Cast: John Travolta; Olivia Newton-John; Stockard Channing; Jeff 
Conaway; Barry Pearl; Michael Tucci; Kelly Ward; Didi Conn; Jamie 
Donnelly; Dinah Manoff; Eve Arden; Sid Caesar; Frankie Avalon; Joan 
Blondell; Edd Byrnes; Alice Ghostley 
Director: Randal Kleiser 
Screenplay: Allan Carr; Bronte Woodward<HR>Those print and television ads trumpeting that "'Grease' is still the 
word" are right on the money. To celebrate its 20th anniversary, this 
quintessential movie musical is getting the royal treatment reserved for 
classics like "Star Wars" -- a well-deserved, red-carpet rerelease. 
That's fantastic, especially when considering of all the classic 
characters and scenes the film has served up -- who can forget aspiring 
beautician Frenchie (Didi Conn) being serenaded by her 
tell-it-like-it-is guardian angel (Frankie Avalon)? Or the hard-nosed 
principal (Eve Arden) reminding the student body to "be an athletic 
supporter" by rooting for the home team? Or National Bandstand emcee 
Vince Fontaine (Edd Byrnes) flirting with Marty (a pre-"Empty Nest" 
Dinah Manhoff)? And these are all probably considered minor moments ... </P>
<P>A very skinny John Travolta and a very young Olivia Newton-John have the 
respective leads of Danny Zuko and Sandy Olsson, and their pairing still 
ranks as one of screendom's most effervescently charming. For those 
eight of you who aren't familiar with the story, here's a brief recap: 
Greaser bad boy Danny and Aussie good girl Sandy are reunited for their 
1959 senior year at Rydell High after a brief fling during the summer; 
both thought she was going to return to her native continent before 
school started, but both were wrong. Sandy tries to rekindle their 
relationship, but Danny's too cool a cat to fall for her wholesome 
appeal in front of his T-Bird buddies (including Jeff Conaway). So Sandy 
hooks up with a gang herself -- the Pink Ladies, headed by sassy, sexy 
Rizzo (Stockard Channing, just superb as an independent woman well ahead 
of her time) -- and Danny, who still really feels love for her, attempts 
a compromise of ideals in order to win her back. </P>
<P>The drag race finale is yet something of a drag, and I never have 
thought much of "Greased Lightening," the film's big "guy" number (that 
choreography -- ack!), but "Grease"'s flaws amount too few to carp. The 
movie's first showpiece is "Summer Nights," where Danny and Sandy 
separately recount wildly different versions of their fun-in-the-sun 
romance. Not only is "Nights" tremendously catchy, but it's also a smart 
look at how men and women see the same events with varying eyes. There 
has yet to be a live-action musical sequence that rivals the one-two 
punch of "You're the One That I Want" and "We Go Together," "Grease"'s 
euphoric cappers. All this and some of the most pleasing moments come 
from the smaller, quieter moments; the Oscar-nominated "Hopelessly 
Devoted to You" is a lovely showcase for Newton-John, and Channing's 
lamenting ballad "There Are Worse Things I Could Do" is one of 
"Grease"'s most unjustly overlooked tunes. </P>
<P>The soundtrack is remastered (though Travolta still hits that awful high 
note at the end of "Nights") and the restored widescreen allows us to 
see previously pan-and-scanned-out choreography, but nothing else has 
changed -- no computer-generated backgrounds, no outtakes or new musical 
numbers, no Jabba the Hutt cameos. And it's a testament to "Grease"'s 
timeless success that nothing needs to be changed -- it's the same 
all-around blast it's always been, with an appealing cast in a fun story 
told with great music. To '90s viewers, "Grease" will probably recall 
disco and bellbottoms as much as it made its original audience nostalgic 
for doo-wop and poodle skirts. But regardless of what decade it 
transports us to, we can all agree on one thing -- without a doubt, 
"Grease" is still the word.<HR>© 1998 Jamie Peck
