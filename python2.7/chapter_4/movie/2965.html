<PRE>                          THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION
                       A film review by Jeff Pidgeon
                        Copyright 1994 Jeff Pidgeon</PRE>
<P>     THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a strong debut for director Frank
Darabont, a screenwriter who sold the script on the provision that he
could direct it.  This isn't a Film For The Ages, but it is involving
and engaging for the majority of its 150-minute running time.  Tim
Robbins and Morgan Freeman are both fine as convicts who meet in
Shawshank Prison in the late 40's and get to know each other as they do
time together.  The suspense mainly revolves around 1) whether Robbins
will continue to survive prison life; and 2) whether he should be there
at all.  The script does a decent job of sustaining these elements and
keeping the viewer in doubt.  On the other hand, there are few moments
in the story that, once they are revealed, are different than you might
expect.  For the most part, the satisfying option is usually chosen,
the one that will make the audience happy.  While this makes for an
enjoyable immediate experience , the side effect is that the lack of
genuine surprise makes it less enduring than you'd like.  On the whole
though, aside from script weaknesses and implausibilities (more than a
couple), the performances are uniformly strong, if a bit
two-dimensional in spots, the period feel of the art direction is
thorough yet understated, Thomas Newman's score nicely supports things
and is emotional without being too overpowering or treacly.  For a
prison drama, the violence isn't played up particlarly, but this ain't
FREE WILLY, either.  For the curious, SHAWSHANK makes for a good
night out, as the saying goes.  If the concept doesn't grab you from
the start, I don't know that it would win you over.  Marginally
Recommended.</P>
