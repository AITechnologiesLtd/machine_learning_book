<PRE>"Mulholland Drive"</PRE>
<P>Dreams, strange characters, sexy and troubled women, a mystical black box
and its blue key and a sinister air drive the bizarre drama as
director/writer David Lynch takes us into his own unique view of the world
with "Mulholland Drive." Naomi Watts stars as a squeaky-clean, fresh-faced
actress named Betty Elms, straight out of the boondocks of Canada, who
comes to Hollywood to find fame and fortune but, instead meets, in her
aunt's shower, a mysterious, beautiful woman, Rita (Laura Harring). Rita
has a pocketbook stuffed with hundred-dollar bills and no memory after
being in a car accident on the titular road.</P>
<P>Betty offers to help Rita learn about herself and regain her memory.
Meanwhile, Fellini-looking film director Adam (Justin Theroux) is being
coerced by his backers, the Castigliane brothers (Dan Hedaya and
"Mulholland Drive" composer Angelo Badalementi), to put their chose of
actress as the star of the helmer's pic. Adam refuses, trashes the
brothers' car then hides out in a Hollywood fleabag hotel, only to find out
that his assets are frozen.</P>
<P>Betty is awakened from sleep by a strange and mysterious guy called The
Cowboy only to learn that the her meteoric success is only a dream and she
must cope with the reality of her situation - out of work and without
prospect, except to use what God gave her to try and get ahead. Rita, it
turns out, is the star and she has the attention of director Adam, now back
in control.</P>
<P>David Lynch, as a filmmaker, is most definitely an acquired taste. Which
explains why, for the first time I can recall in quite a while, years
maybe, people walked out of the screening I attended. If  not forewarned,
the average movie bear would be hard-pressed to see just what it is about
Lynch that causes him to have such a dedicated following. The director's
style, since he broke ground with "Eraserhead," is to use sparse dialog,
slow almost languid camera work and long bouts of quietude throughout his
films, coupled with his offbeat storylines and characters. "Mulholland
Drive" is no exception.</P>
<P>Be prepared, when you sit down to watch "Mulholland Drive" for the
director's unique perspective on telling a story. He treats things that are
good and nice as superficial and destined to be replaced by those things
that rise up from the sordid underbelly of the human psyche. His main
characters represent a duality of good/bad, but almost invariably, the bad
comes to prominence - see the director's nightmarish "Blue Velvet" and the
near-incomprehensible but enthralling "Lost Highway." While "Mulholland
Drive" doesn't have the exquisitely evil character of the other films,
Dennis Hopper and Robert Blake, respectively, there is the patented
Lynchian undertone of the sinister side of man within and throughout the
film.</P>
<P>Acting, like the dialogue, is sparse as the thesps deliver their lines in
the slow, deliberate manner what couples with the director's laconic method
of telling a story. This tale is almost linear in nature, somewhat of a
departure from the episodic sequencing he normally exhibits. Lynch
collaborator, cinematographer Peter Demming, provides the requisite moody
camera work to carry forth the story and make the film look interesting.
His close-up camerawork of the attractive female leads has a texture and
feel that brings out their beauty. Production designer Jack Fisk is
thoroughly in sync with the director and gives a life to the set design
that complements the film. A keynote of the flick is a fabulous musical
rendition of a foreign language version of the great Roy Orbison song,
"Crying," that blew me away. The oft-eerie score, by Badalementi, helps
maintain the sinister undertone that Lynch is striving for.</P>
<P>If you're headed out to the theater and are looking for a bit of mindless
Hollywood entertainment, do NOT buy tickets for "Mulholland Drive." But, if
you are a fan of David Lynch or are up to do a little experimentation at
the movies (which I encourage), then this will, at the very least, have you
thinking. This one is for the brave at heart (it is 21/2 hours long) and I
give it a B+.</P>
