<PRE>Lake Placid (R) ***
Starring Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda
Directed by Steve Miner
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Creature features are always popular, take one part cliched script, add two
parts awesome special effects, and one cup of stars and you've got a success.
Obviously this is usually never true, but in Lake Placid, it works.</P>
<P>A deputy is bit in half right before the sheriff (Brendan Gleeson) in the
town's lake by a giant crocodile. The top of the man is taken to the morgue
where they discover a tooth hidden among the flesh and carnage. Kelly (Fonda)
has just been dumped by her boss for another co-worker, when news of the tooth
is delivered he sends her down so he can have some private time with his new
friend. </P>
<P>Two other characters show up, game warden Jack Wells (Pullman) who constantly
has a macho smile and denim wardrobe about him and mythology professor Oliver
Platt who views crocodiles as godly and loves to take swims with them. </P>
<P>Lake Placid will keep you laughing more than anything else, the two minorly
frightening scenes of the film aren't that exciting so they fill it with humor,
a wise choice. A good choice especially with Betty White as Mrs. Delores
Bickerman a SSU (seriously screwed up) woman who feeds her cattle (and her
husband) to the crocodile. Finally, Hollywood has made a movie so hilariously
bad and totally outrageous that you can enjoy it. Come along for one heck of a
bad movie that's bad enough to be good, which earns my *** stars.</P>
