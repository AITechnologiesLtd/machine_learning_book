<PRE>                                   ONLY THE LONELY
                       A film review by Roger Snappy Rubio
                        Copyright 1991 Roger Snappy Rubio</PRE>
<P>ONLY THE LONELY
Starring: John Candy, Maureen O'Hara, Ally Sheedy, Anthony Quinn, and
          James Belushi
Produced by John Hughes and Hunt Lowry
Written and Directed by Chris Columbus</P>
<P>     This movie is the kind of movie you take a date to ... really funny
and really romantic at the same time.  It's advertised as a comedy, but
it has all the elements of a good story: love, humor, romance, conflict,
sentimentality, drama, and overall good fun.  I would definitely
recommend seeing this movie.</P>
<P>     ONLY THE LONELY is the story of Danny (John Hughes), a Chicago cop
who won't admit that his mother is running his life.  His mother Rose
(Maureen O'Hara) is a prejudiced, brash, and rather blunt woman who
doesn't have any qualms about saying EXACTLY what she is thinking to
anyone and everyone.  Danny meets Theresa (Ally Sheedy), a rather
introverted individual who is trying to break out of her own mold.  They
eventually fall in love, and that is something that Rose is not going to
stand for, so she makes sure to try to break them up in her own sort of
way.  I won't ruin the rest of the story, but I assure you, it is worth
seeing.</P>
<P>     It looks like Hollywood is responding to the call of the people for
more human stories instead of the shoot 'em up kill 'em all type of
movie with nothing to offer except violence and bloodshed.  ONLY THE
LONELY certainly delivers with good performances, a good storyline, and
for that matter, an ORIGINAL storyline.  It's not completely original,
but it does provide some refreshment amidst run-of-the-mill romances and
comedies.</P>
<P>     I always knew Chris Columbus was a good writer, and he didn't
disappoint me with this movie, either.  Chris Columbus is responsible
(whether in whole or in part) for some really good celluloid; for
example, he wrote the scripts for GREMLINS and YOUNG SHERLOCK HOLMES
(which, in my humble opinion, is one of his best scripts), and he helmed
the mega-hit HOME ALONE.  John Hughes almost precedes himself nowadays.
And even though his logo is on this film, it is really Columbus that
deserves the credit.</P>
<P>     John Candy is charismatic, funny, and a little vulnerable in this
movie, which might make him as attractive as, say, Bill Murray.  Bill
Murray is not exactly the sexiest man alive, but it is his humor that
makes him attractive to most women, and I think if John Candy keeps
going the way he is going, he just might attain Murray's status as a
comedian.  Of course, everything Murray had to say that was funny was
usually written for him, but let's stay optimistic now!  Maureen O'Hara
comes off as a slightly vicious character, compared to Ally Sheedy's
shyness.  James Belushi has a small part in this movie as Danny's
partner in the police wagon business of picking up stiffs and criminals
and hauling them away.  He is constantly talking in some way about sex,
whether advertently or inadvertently.  Anthony Quinn plays a lonely,
elderly bachelor hopelessly in love with Rose, and always attempting to
gain her heart.  All together, they make for an interesting entourage,
and one well worth seeing.</P>
<P>     To sum it all up: good writing, good directing, good acting, good
story.  What more could you want?  Maybe a free pass to see it like I
got, but it is worth paying your six or seven dollars or whatever you
have to pay where you are to go see it.  Take your boyfriend,
girlfriend, wife, husband, best friend, family, whoever, and treat
yourself to a good movie called ONLY THE LONELY.  I'm pretty sure you'll
like it.</P>
