<P>Starring Hugh Grant, Julia Roberts, Rhys Ifans. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>Notting Hill is a movie that plays off a dream. It's a dream many people
have. Imagine, if you will, this scenario: you get a knock on your door
one afternoon. You go to open it, and on your doorstep you see one of
the most famous movie stars in the world, someone you have seen time and
again, someone you admire, perhaps even adore (don't even ask why they
are there, stick with me here). What would you do? What would you say?
How would you conduct yourself? It's quite an interesting thought,
really. One often imagines something like that happening to him, but if
push comes to shove and it actually happens, he is dumbfounded. And what
if that movie star, presumably of the opposite sex, comes up and plants
a big wet kiss on you? That's what Notting Hill is about.</P>
<P>Hugh Grant, whose talents have taken second billing to the 1995 scandal
when he reportedly hired a prostitute to perform undignified sexual acts
on him in the privacy of his car, is actually a damn good actor. He's
got a boyish, often befuddled charm that can only be described as crowd-
pleasing, but it's also effective. Here, he stars as William Thacker, a
struggling travel bookshop owner in a section of London called Notting
Hill. When Anna Scott (Julia Roberts), a female movie star the
equivalent of, well, Julia Roberts, walks into his bookshop one day, he
is understandably amazed but he maintains his composure (even if he does
give her a free book). He remains human even when later that same day he
bumps into Anna on the street and spills some coffee on her. He
excitedly invites her to go clean up at his place, across the street (18
yards away), to clean up. That is where the big wet kiss is planted.</P>
<P>Before long, it's full-fledged love affair, with Anna coming to
William's sister's birthday (complete with exclamations of "Holy F*ck!"
by astounded family members), them climbing over garden walls, and so
on. It's an extraordinarily engaging affair, mainly because Thacker's I-
can't-believe-this-is-happening astonishment is so palpable. For once,
here is the old "ordinary guy in extraordinary circumstances" plot, when
the extraordinary circumstances are actually positive, as is this
relentlessly upbeat, optimistic modern fairly tale.</P>
<P>Notting Hill asks whether fame is a goal or an obstacle; whether one who
is a household name can achieve the happiness that so many "ordinary
people" can arrive at. It is an exhilirating, funny, profound film, full
of smart, realistic dialogue, masterful cinematography and magical
acting. Julia Roberts, whose last romantic comedy was the equally
wonderful My Best Friend's Wedding, is terrific; although
understandably, the role isn't much of a stretch for her, she has the
ailing superstar feel down cold. Hugh Grant is something else again --
the bumbling Brit is an absolute delight, and the scene where he
impersonates a reporter from "Horse and Hound" magazine is a triumph of
understated comedy.</P>
<P>Director Roger Michell, whose only other major motion picture was the
Jane Austen adaptation Persuasion, stages this movie free of any
suspense or particularly pressing conflict; it's a whimsical, airy
production that is part crowd-pleaing and part profound and thoughtful.
Even though William's degenerate roommate (Rhys Ifans) is a bit too
much, the comedy rarely gets in the way of the plot, nor does it spoil
the movie's mood.</P>
<P>This is a perfect example of how good "mainstream" movies can be. It's
hard to remember the last time a romantic comedy worked this well, this
consistently. Grant and Roberts are awesome, in a movie that pulls no
punches and plays no tricks. It would be cliched and disrespectful to
call Notting Hill the "feel-good movie of the year," but that's what it
is; an upbeat, optimistic story of how an ordinary bloke and a superstar
fell in love. Happens every day.
