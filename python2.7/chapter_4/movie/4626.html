<PRE>                           CITY OF LOST CHILDREN
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This is a bizarre and wonderful
          French fantasy that defies description.  In a
          never-never land that seems to combine Marseilles
          at the turn of the last century and the next, the
          evil scientist Krank kidnaps children to steal
          their nightmares.  He is opposed by a carnival
          strongman and a young girl.  This is one of the
          most visually creative films ever made, combining
          the style of BRAZIL with a wall-to-wall creativity
          almost rivaling THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS.
          Rating: high +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     The plot is almost as bizarre and complex as the characters.  Evil
Krank (played by Daniel Emilfork) has lost the ability to dream and as
a result is aging before his time.  He can preserve his life by
kidnapping children and stealing their dreams.  To do this kidnapping
he has a band of video-enhanced henchmen called Cyclopes.  They steal
children and bring them to his fortress in an off-shore oil derrick.
There he keeps a philosophical brain alive in a tank and is tended by
six identical clones (all played by Dominique Pinon seamlessly rematted
into the same frame as many as seven times since he also plays a diver)
and their dwarf mother (Mireille Mosse).  Pitted against Krank is One
(Ron Perlman), an inarticulate carnival strongman looking for his
adopted little brother who has been kidnapped.  He is joined by a young
thief Miette (Judith Vittet) from the local band of child criminals
ruled over by the villainous Octopus, a pair of Siamese twins played by
Genevieve Brunet and Odile Mallet.  Now have I left any of the weird
character out?  Yes, lots of them.  But I do not have the space to list
them all.</P>
<P>     The film is the brainchild--or is it the enfant terrible--of
Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro, who in 1991 gave us DELICATESSEN, a
popular but not fully realized post-holocaust comedy.  This time they
have created a film that will be hard for them ever to match.  This is
a creation that is so full of visual wonders that it really needs to be
well-dubbed since the eye is much too busy to read subtitles
translating the French.  The visual style is very much like that of
Terry Gilliam in BRAZIL with if anything a darker sense of humor.  But
the density of images is somewhere between that of BRAZIL and THE
NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS.  (I saw the trailer for the film perhaps
eight times before I noticed the screaming faces in the green nightmare
smoke!  That is just the kind of film it is.  By comparison 12
MONKEYS's imagery i simplistic.)</P>
<P>     The film has a nifty set of sequences that work like something out
of either Rube Goldberg or "Mission Impossible."   One sequence asks
the question if you want to get into a locked room, why would you start
by grating cheese onto the floor?  Another follows a miraculous set of
events that shut down a city because one tear flew through the air.
This is a film of often jaw-dropping imagination.  Few faces will be
familiar to American audiences, though it does star Ron Perlman of TV's
"Beauty and the Beast" and CRONOS.  Daniel Emilfork will be a pleasant
surprise for audiences who have not seen him before, though he did make
an excellent devil in the surprising horror film, THE DEVIL'S
NIGHTMARE.</P>
<P>     For those with a taste for the unique or who just want to be
weirded out by the creatively bizarre, this is an amazing film.  Mostly
for its originality I give it a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
