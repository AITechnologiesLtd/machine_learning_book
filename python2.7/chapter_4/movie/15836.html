<P>At the beginning of The Prince of Egypt, I was glad to see a few words
regarding the origin of the story of Moses.  First, it explains that the
source text of the film is the book of Exodus; it then makes the point
that this is the story behind the religion in which "millions of people
believe."  I like this statement because it doesn't explicitly say that
the book of Exodus is factual, or that Christians are the only ones who
are right.  It's just too bad that the film itself does.</P>
<P>The Prince of Egypt is an energetic, visually masterful animated film
of questionable morality.  It depicts the doings of Moses -- his
attempts to free his fellow Hebrews, who have been enslaved by the
Egyptians.  The story is a familiar one:  as an infant, Moses (voiced by
Val Kilmer) is sent down river by his slave mother, only to be rescued
and raised by the Pharaoh (Patrick Stewart) and his wife (Helen Mirren).
  
Moses grows up with his brother Ramses (Ralph Fiennes); but, as a young
man, he learns of his true heredity.   So, Moses heads off into the
desert, rejecting his Princehood and vowing to free his people.  When
his father dies, and Ramses becomes the Pharaoh, Moses is forced to wage
war on Ramses and the Egyptian people.  Along the way, he talks to the
burning bush, parts the Red Sea, and massacres thousands of people for
the good of his own.</P>
<P>I realize that The Prince of Egypt has been adapted from another text,
and that criticizing the material means that, transitively, I'm
attacking the Bible.  The difference between the book of Exodus and this
particular film is that the source text is not so biased -- it shows
both sides of Moses' doings; it explains the horrors of the plague that
destroys the Egyptian people.  The Prince of Egypt, however, is more
interested in setting up a good guy-bad guy scenario, so that the
Pharaoh is simply evil, and Moses is simply good.  But never was I given
a reason to think that Moses was any less sinister than Ramses.</P>
<P>I can't deny that the film is extremely powerful in its visual
presentation.  The animation, particularly in the scene in which Moses
parts the Red Sea, is spectacular.   (I might even go so far as to use
the "jaw-dropping" cliche, because my jaw certainly did drop.)  The film
is lively and entertaining, and paced very well, and features a lot of
talented actors:  Kilmer does a good job sounding important, while
Fiennes does an equally good job sounding sinister.  The supporting cast
is colored in familiar voices, with notable roles by Jeff Goldblum
(present mostly for comic relief), Patrick Stewart, and Danny Glover (as
Jethro).
  
But I have a major problem with the way Moses and his actions are
depicted.  I know this isn't the first time this story has been done
(anyone ever seen The Ten Commandments?), but this is the first time
it's been geared towards kids.  Are kids just supposed to overlook the
scene in which the metaphorical hand of God comes down and slaughters
children in their beds?  Oh sure, the Egyptians are "bad," right?  Yeah,
they're just as "bad" as Southern slaveholders in the 19th century.  
I'll agree that slavery is "bad," but it's not a straightforward issue. </P>
<P>I'm not attacking religion or Christianity, nor do I think Moses was a
bad guy.   What I'm saying is that The Prince of Egypt is a powerful
movie that would have been much more powerful if it had shown Moses in a
questionable light.  He killed a lot of people, and he did it in the
name of God.  If Moses had lived today, he would have been labeled a
religious fanatic just before being sent to prison.   There are good
lessons to be learned in the Bible, but I think we could have overlooked
the one that tells us that death in the name of God is beautiful.</P>
