<PRE>                        THE MIRROR HAS TWO FACES
                       A film review by Tim Voon
                        Copyright 1997 Tim Voon</PRE>
<P>Cast: Barbra Streisand, Jeff Bridges, Lauren Bacall, Pierce Brosnan,
Mimi Rogers, George Segal, Brenda Vaccaro, Austin Pendleton Director:
Barbra Streisand Screenplay: Richard LaGravenese</P>
<P>The mirror has two faces, the reflection that you see, and the person
who you are behind that reflection.</P>
<P>I had a friend who once told me that it was better to be happily single,
than to settle for second best. I couldn't agree more. Don't settle for
second best. To find someone who loves you so much that it aches, well
that's worth waiting for.</P>
<P>This, in part, is one of the many themes in this movie. A single,
middle-aged professor of literature (Streisand), is always the
bridesmaid and never the bride. A single, middle-aged professor of
mathematics (Bridges), has unusual theories about the universe and sex -
that a lasting relationship with a woman, only requires friendship and
common interests. They get married, become best friends, but the
marriage is never consummated. It is then that Streisand's character
realises that she wants more; she wants it all, the flowers, the
romance, the passion and fireworks -- and not second best.</P>
<P>Great subject material for a movie. Well chosen by Streisand, who I am
sure directs from personal experience; and a cast well suited to their
roles.</P>
<PRE>Comment: A good view.</PRE>
