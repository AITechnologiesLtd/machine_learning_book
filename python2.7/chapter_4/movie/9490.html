<PRE>Volcano (12)
  Starring Tommy Lee Jones 
Directed By Mick Jackson
A 20th Century Fox Release</PRE>
<P>After the pretty awful Dantes Peak, we get the second of 'unknown volcano
erupts in unaware city' disaster film. However, the place in question isn't
a small town, like in Dantes, but Los Angeles. Dosen't really matter
though. This film is just as awful as Dantes Peak (but is saved a bit by
Jones) 
The 'plot' is about odd things going on in L.A, some scientists trying to
tell people that there is something odd, everyone ignoring them, and then
big s*** happening. No, you haven't clicked on a review for Dantes Peak,
it's because both films are exactly the same Tragic. 
Jones gives a good performance in a character that is impossible to 'act'
It's the most flat, boring action hero ever. However, Jones is always to
ready to save a film, and here he does it quite well. But he can't quite
save it from the pits of rubbish. Like Willem Dafoe in Speed 2, he's the
best thing in the film, but he can't save it due to a poor script. Some of
the speacial effects are quite good, especially the final shots, but some
models are so horrendously fake I had no choice but to laugh manically.
Also, some of the things the characters say are unbeliviable. For example,
at the end of the film, a fireman asks a five year old boy where his mother
is. He lifts the boy onto his shoulder. The boy then looks at everyone
(whos faces are covered in ash) and utters (and I swear he says this) 'Look
at their faces. They all look the same.' The Coca-Cola very nearly shot out
my nose I was laughing so hard. 
  
This film is nonsense really. I suppose if you like these big budget
bonanza's, you'll probably like this. Maybe if it was raining, there was
nothing on TV, and all your friends were on holiday, and you had NOTHING TO
DO, you might want to see this, (after all, Tommy Lee Jones is in it) It's
better than Dante's Peak. But that's not much of an recommendation. </P>
<P>Overall Rating=** out of ***** (Hollywood nonsense, saved by Jones.
Almost.) </P>
