<P>MY QUITE LENGTHY TAKE ON THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT</P>
<P><This interminable essay is low on spoilers, but you definitely shouldn't read
it anyway if you haven't seen the movie></P>
<P>  When a variety of credible critics claim that a new horror movie is one of
the scariest they've ever seen, I make plans to see it. That's just how it
works. I love a good horror movie (sometimes even a bad one) and if a movie
really is scary, I want to experience it. However, the film festival and
promotional screening buzz of the Blair Witch Project has grown to such a
deafening roar that it seems inevitable that it won't live up to the hype. "It
couldn't be as scary as The Texas Chain Saw Massacre," I told myself, "But
hopefully it will be good."
  At least in the circles I travel, The Blair Witch Project is easily one of
the most anticipated summer movies of '99. Everyone wants to see if it lives up
to the hype - will it be another out of nowhere, low budget first feature
horror classic, like Night of the Living Dead or Texas Chain Saw Massacre or
The Evil Dead? Artisan Entertainment has cruelly but cleverly used this
anticipation as a promotional gimmick by going ahead and releasing it on a mere
27 screens nationwide. The scene at the Neptune in Seattle is, I would assume,
typical - the box office swarmed all day, every single show selling out hours
in advance, enormous around-the-block lines completely unprecedented for this
one screen, semi-arthouse theater. And while I was waiting in line two hours in
advance for a 9:45 showing, clutching tickets I had bought at 3 in the
afternoon, people would walk by, see the lines and exclaim variations on "This
must be the movie of the summer." No doubt these people will check the movie
out "when the crowds die down" and it's playing in multiplexes.
  Another thing that has apparently helped to promote the film is the "let's
pretend it's real" approach to some of the marketing. I never thought the web
site or other promotional materials were intended to deceive people into
thinking the Blair Witch was real. Nevertheless, I heard the guy behind me in
line telling a long, fanciful story about how the filmmakers were found
dismembered and the footage was buried in someone's backyard and blah blah
blah. Other people were overheard referring to it as a "true story." (I can't
help but suspect that these are the people who will be most disappointed by the
movie. They ought to realize it's a "hoax" as soon as it ends - would a real
snuff film have credits?)</P>
<P>  The premise of the movie, as you surely must know, is that three student
filmmakers venture into the woods to make an amateur documentary about a local
legend involving a witch and a series of child murders. The filmmakers, we are
told by the opening title, disappeared, and one year later their footage was
found. We watch their black and white 16 mm footage and goofing-around digital
video, edited together to tell the story of their experiences getting lost in
the woods.
  Early on, I was skeptical as to whether the found-footage conceit would work.
They interview some locals about the "Blair Witch" legend, and the very first
interview is rather stiff. The director of the film within the film, Heather,
records some narration in a cemetery, and it's almost too bad to be believed.
She changes her accent to sound more serious, and the results are laughable.
(Otherwise, the amateurishness of the documentary-in-progress seems dead on
accurate. I am absolutely positive that the aspiring filmmakers I went to
college with would have taken the same approach - static, black and white 16 mm
for the "scary parts," plus lots of crappy video footage of the filmmakers
hiking and fooling around in the hotel room.)
  But the film quickly won me over, and I found that there were very few
touches that rang false. Almost none of the dialogue seems like it could have
possibly been scripted (apparently, the directors led the actors on sort of a
role-playing scavenger hunt, leading them through the story with a series of
notes). As far as I can tell, most of the characterization is not so much
storytelling as footage of the actual bonding between the actors. They joke
with each other in ways rarely captured on film before - not clever quips, just
the kinds of things people say to each other when they're hanging out together.
One of my favorite such moments is when Michael jokingly reprimands Heather and
Josh for incorrectly referring to the Skipper on Gilligan's Island. "Let's stop
calling him 'The Captain,' you illiterate TV people. It's… *the Skipper*."
  What results from this improvisatory technique is perhaps the most realistic
group of protagonists in horror movie history. I can relate to the heroes of
The Texas Chain Saw Massacre or Dawn of the Dead, but not as effortlessly as I
can here. The clever quasi-Method techniques used to get these performances
really help pull you into the movie. These are real people, really reacting -
it's just that what they're reacting to, of course, isn't real. But suspension
of disbelief was not a problem for me. I felt like I really was going to "shoot
doc" with these people, and then getting lost in the woods with them, and then
running blindly through the trees screaming with them.
  One particularly realistic touch is the way the fear slowly builds throughout
the movie. Some horror movies have their protagonists take their situations too
lightly, like when Jennifer Love Hewitt goes tanning shortly after witnessing
murders in I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. But I think most horror
filmmakers, had they made The Blair Witch Project, would have had the
protagonists terrified out of their minds for the last two thirds of the movie,
giving it a melodramatic feel that probably would not have worked. 
  The film, however, allows the characters to feel better when the daylight
comes. They may have witnessed something spooky last night in the dark, but in
the sunny afternoon everything seems safer. They allow themselves to
rationalize what happened, or to put it out of their minds, or to assume that
they can make it out of the woods before darkness hits again. For a long time,
they assume it's just someone trying to scare them, which still scares them
because "something has to be wrong" with someone who would bother to do that.
But as the film progresses, the situation gets worse, the nights get scarier
and the chances of ever finding the edge of the woods begin to seem miniscule.
It's a slow burn. Rather than start out with something scary, then introduce
the characters, then get scary again, The Blair Witch Project starts out funny
and really has to build toward the scary. And it works.</P>
<P>  I don't want to say that The Blair Witch Project is one of the scariest
movies I've ever seen. The more times people say that, the more the
expectations are built, and there will most certainly be people who see it
years later and have heard for so long how scary it is that when they finally
see it, it seems laughable. 
  But the fact is, a movie has never before scared me the way this one did.
Maybe The Shining or The Texas Chain Saw Massacre would have done the trick if
I had seen them for the first time at the right age and in a theater. Or maybe
The Exorcist, had I grown up Catholic. Only time travel will ever settle that.
But when shit went down in the Burkittsville woods, I felt a powerful,
vibrating chill all across my skin - the same feeling you get when you almost
get hit by a car or otherwise feel just a little too close to death. My
girlfriend and I like to watch horror movies together, and she usually squeezes
my hand tight during the scary scenes. This is the first movie that has
prompted her to bite my finger in fear.
  Many hardened skeptics and contrarians are already popping up to claim that
it's all hype, and that the movie actually isn't at all scary. I don't think
many of them could have been at the 9:45 Neptune show, though.
  Throughout the film, people all around me were looking at the film
intellectually, or just not taking it seriously. As the opening text unfolded,
the guy next to me continued a conversation with his girlfriend about some
Buffalo Springfield song that they had been reminded of by one of the trailers.
Later he said out loud, "That's a scary shot," dissecting the movie, probably
an aspiring filmmaker. Even late in the film, when things had gotten real scary
and uncomfortable, the theater would rumble with laughter every time a
character made a semi-amusing comment. It didn't seem like the kind of audience
that could be terrified by a movie.
  But at a certain point late in the movie, when the protagonists stumble upon
a certain thing, I heard an entire packed theater get scared out of their wits.
This is not a sudden jolt or a blunt scare like a dead body or a pool of blood.
It's just the unexpected discovery of something that at this point in the story
makes the audience fear what might happen next. A massive, communal moan of
dread rumbled back and forth between the walls of the theater. You could hear
the entire audience squirm in unison. This is not the "BOO! Made you flinch,"
type of shock that is so prevalent in modern horror films. This is more like
true blue, horrified, horrible, reeling in horror type of horror. I wonder if
this might be the closest I'll get to ever experiencing something like the
terror that people allegedly had when The Exorcist was first released.</P>
<P>  So why is it so scary? It's not virtuoso cinematic technique, or pushing the
boundaries of horror subject matter. I think what the filmmakers did was push
aside most of what they've seen in horror movies and instead try to imagine
what it would really be like in real life. What would really be scary? A guy
with an ax chopping off a guy's head? Yeah, that would be scary. But what about
something more subtle? Like, just hearing footsteps when  you're out where
there shouldn't be people? In a slick studio horror movie, the idea would be
ludicrous. But in a raw, low budget movie that so unerringly captures reality,
it wrenches your stomach.
  What's wrong with today's horror movies, many people have tried to convince
me, is that they show too much, when the real way to make a movie scary is to
leave everything up to the imagination. I think that's overstating the
argument, though. Yes, some of the most horrifying events in, say, Psycho, take
place off screen. You can't really deny that Jaws and Alien wouldn't be less
scary if their respective creatures had much more screen time. And I think it
is notable how many people remember horrendous amounts of blood and bodily
mutilation in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, even though the actual movie is
virtually bloodless. 
  But just because it works so well in these classics doesn't mean it's the
only legitimate approach to making a horror film. Would Night of the Living
Dead be scarier without the shot of the zombies munching guts? Was I imagining
it when I thought the gruesome bloodletting and eye-munching tarantulas of The
Beyond made my heart beat fast? Would The Exorcist be scarier if we had to
imagine Regan turning her head around?
  I don't think so. But The Blair Witch Project takes the other approach -
leaving it to the imagination - and succeeds tremendously. I am certain that it
will become the most frequently used example of the "tell, don't show"
technique of horror.
  The premise of Blair Witch Project allows a good twist on being Left To The
Imagination (for now on, to be referred to as LTTI). Since the film pretends to
be an attempt to document actual horrific events, the audience is made to feel
like they are examining the footage, squinting at it, trying to find the
evidence in there somewhere. When something happens off screen, you don't
think, "Nice cinematic technique." It's more like, "Damn, they didn't have the
camera on." Like real videos of alleged supernatural phenomenon, the eeriness
of the footage largely lies in how frustratingly incomplete it is. You're
always searching for a quick glimpse of something, somewhere in the frame. In
the instances when you do see something horrifying, the camera is shaky and
unclear enough that it's debatable what you saw. Even the eerie sounds heard in
the night are largely LTTI, because they are covered by the ruffling
microphones and unzipping tents of the terrified film crew.
  I didn't even notice it until after the movie, but I think the lack of music
really helps, and almost falls into the LTTI category. A good score can really
add a lot to a horror film, particularly those of the atmospheric, gothic
variety. There are terrifying movies that don't work at all when viewed without
the music, like (according to John Carpenter) Halloween. But Blair Witch
Project has no music to poke at your emotions, or enhance the creepiness, or
tell you how to feel. The story is left to fend for itself. Even the end
credits, thankfully, don't try to cheer you up or appeal to your sense of irony
with a catchy tune. Instead, they leave you with ambient noises, as if to say,
"Keep thinking about it, sucker. This movie isn't leaving right away."</P>
<P>  So since the movie really does live up to the hype, and since the
overwhelming crowds of the limited release seem to be a genuine phenomenon, I
think it's safe to say that The Blair Witch Project will be a monster hit that
will signal a new era in horror films. Perfect timing, too, because the short
lived Scream cycle seems to be on its last legs. 
  Hugely successful horror films always inspire a slew of half-assed imitators
that miss the point, and a few pretty good ones that don't. It will be
interesting to see how studios and other filmmakers will try to capitalize on
and/or learn from The Blair Witch Project. Here are a few predictions:</P>
<P>1. Much lip service will be given to the LTTI technique. This week, Dreamworks
releases Jan De Bont's effects heavy remake of the LTTI classic The Haunting. I
predict that 75% of all reviews will mention The Blair Witch Project as a
superior alternative, because it doesn't try to show everything. Perhaps some
of the next slew of horror films will put more thought into the ancient art of
making the audience fear what they might see, instead of what they do see.</P>
<P>2. One or two studios will try picking up low budget supernatural horror movies
by unknown directors. They will be met with much less enthusiasm than The Blair
Witch Project.</P>
<P>3. Someone will try making a movie with a Scream style, plucked-from-TV cast
encountering a supernatural horror in the woods. The trades will call it "The
Blair Witch Project meets Scream."</P>
<P>4. I fear that particularly unimaginative filmmakers will try copying the
mockumentary angle. Blair Witch Project isn't the first horror movie to do
this, but another horror mockumentary inspired by its success would still count
as a rip off. Other filmmakers will have trouble duplicating the realism of
Blair Witch Project.</P>
<P>5. Hopefully, the movie's success will inspire filmmakers to think about what
really is scary, rather than what is traditionally used to scare people in
horror films. They will probe their own fears and try to figure out how to
depict them realistically on film. I don't think they should abandon the use of
extravagant visual effects, but it should free them up to realize that
audiences don't need them.</P>
<P>A postscript concerning The Blair Witch Project and my precious Texas Chain Saw
Massacre:</P>
<P>  Although the films are very different from each other, it is my belief that
BWP was heavily influenced by 'Saw, from the opening text implying (but not
outright stating) that the story is true, to certain witchly artifacts
reminiscent of the dangling bone ornaments in 'Saw, to the ambiguous marketing
which has confused people into believing BWP is a true story. There are still
many people who mistakenly believe 'Saw is based on a true story (Ed Gein, who
didn't live in Texas and had no chainsaw to massacre with, doesn't count). 
  After 'Saw, director Tobe Hooper went on to make one unacknowledged classic
(The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part 2), one above average sleaze thriller (The
Funhouse), and one mainstream success that most people credit to Steven
Spielberg (Poltergeist). Most of the rest of his output has been either
substandard horror with limited appeal (Eaten Alive), or unmitigated crap
(Spontaneous Combustion, The Mangler). I still hope he will someday recapture
the demented magic of his two 'Saw films, but most write him off as the
director of a fluke one-off.
  I hope Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez, the creators of The Blair Witch
Project, don't suffer the Curse of Tobe Hooper. So far, the odds seem against
them. Much of the strength of BWP lies in the mockumentary gimmick, which one
would hope they won't repeat. But we don't know if these guys know anything
about other forms of cinematic storytelling, or directing scripted actors, or
even writing dialogue.
  On the other hand, we do know that these are clever guys who came up with an
original way to film an extremely effective horror movie. Here's hoping they
have more tricks up their sleeves.</P>
