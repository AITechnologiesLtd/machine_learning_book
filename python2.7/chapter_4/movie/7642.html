<P>*** (out of 4 = good)
1997, R, 105 minutes [1 hour, 45 minutes]
[romantic comedy]
starring: Ben Affleck (Holden McNeil), Joey Lauren Adams (Alyssa Jones),
Jason Lee (Banky Edwards), Dwight Ewell (Hooper), produced by Scott Mosier,
written and directed by Kevin Smith.</P>
<P>Relationships and sexuality are issues that are very difficult to deal with
intelligently in the movies. Any movie can be a "romance," but what sets
apart "Chasing Amy" is the fact it is able to deal with these issues in a
funny manner and still be sympathetic. It's a bit bland on the surface, and
the subject matter is risque (but certainly original), the only problem is it
doesn't maximize its potential.
The film opens at a comic book convention in New York City where we meet our
main characters, Holden McNeil (Affleck) and Banky Edwards (Lee), creators of
the hit comic "Bluntman & Chronic." Much like Dante and Randal ("Clerks"),
and T.S. and Brodie ("Mallrats"), Holden is the smart, straight man while
Banky is the apathetic wiseass always ready with one-liners. 
Right from the get-go, Smith's uncanny dialogue about mundane topics crops
up as an argument about what exactly an inker is becomes violent! Another
offbeat scene involves the two heckling a black militant artist named Hooper
(Ewell), who explains, with complete logic, that the "Star Wars" trilogy is
really about "how the black man is oppressed, even 'in a galaxy far, far
away.'" 
Hooper's attitude turns out to be just an act. He's actually gay, but
figures this is the only way he can make it in the business. He introduces
Holden and Banky to Alyssa Jones (Adams), a fellow comic scribe who is cute
and hip, and there appears to be an attraction between her and Holden.
Smith's grasp of reality is impressive, no one is able to capture the feel of
"hanging out" as well as he can. When the two talk while playing darts in a
bar, both their dialogue and the atmosphere compliment each other. Because
they are not glamorous movie stars, it is their down-to-Earth attitudes and
overall plainness that makes the story so sympathetic.
And then just when we think this will become another romantic comedy, the
bomb drops - Alyssa is a lesbian.
Of course Holden is shocked and hurt, but eventually he is able to deal with
it and the two become good friends. This leads to some very insightful
conversations about human nature and sexuality. They discuss why they are
attracted to girls, and although it can become shocking at times, it really
is the truth. 
Unfortunately, as soon as the first montage of the two together occurs, it's
a very obvious where the film is going as Holden falls in love with Alyssa.
I've never doubted Smith's characterization before, but it seems a too
convenient that they fall for each other so quickly.
Banky becomes jealous of Holden and Alyssa's relationship and starts digging
up dirt on her. Holden learns of Alyssa's promiscuous past and doesn't know
how to deal with it, which causes much tension between the three main
characters. Then there are argument scenes that are melodramatic but have
elements of truth to them. Fortunately, as serious as the film becomes, humor
is used to keep the mood light and realistic - even Jay and Silent Bob (Jason
Mewes, Kevin Smith) make an appearance and give Holden words of wisdom.
Smith uses his characters, their relationships, and their problems to
symbolize the complexity of dating and sexuality in the 90s. People are not
as monogamous anymore, and everyone wants to experience as many things as
they can, but just don't want their partner to be as experienced as
themselves. There are also interesting observations, such as the fact that
being a lesbian is much more acceptable than a gay man.
The ending itself is probably the most unique and surprising element to the
film. I didn't find it believable, but I appreciated the originality.
"Chasing Amy" could have been just an offbeat romantic comedy or a
realistic-but-complex love story, but it becomes a bit jumbled when it tries
to be both. Still, its overall sense of originality is a more than welcome
change of pace. (5/20/97) [see also: "Clerks," "Mallrats"]</P>
