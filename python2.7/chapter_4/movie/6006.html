<PRE>                             MADAME BUTTERFLY
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>     Okay, admit it.  You hate opera.  You've known this fact since
childhood and have never wavered in your opinion.  Now, confess.
You've actually never seen a real opera.  Flipping the dial and having
accidentally seen a few minutes on PBS doesn't count.</P>
<P>     If this syllogism fits you, then I have just the movie for you.
After watching the utterly lifeless MADAME BUTTERFLY, you will
confidently be to proclaim that you were right all along.  Opera is a
musical hoax perpetrated by a bunch of rich intellectuals.  As Mark
Twain put it about one opera composer, "I am told that his music is
better than it sounds."</P>
<P>     Being a big opera buff, I can testify that opera is one of God's
gifts to mankind, but as in all things, there are bad examples.  French
documentary director Frederic Mitterand's MADAME BUTTERFLY is devoid of
energy and the singing quality is minimal.  In the spirit of full
disclosure, I should admit that "Madame Butterfly" is not one of my
favorite of Puccini's operas, nevertheless, the production of it does
not have to be this boring.</P>
<P>     The story is set in Nagasaki, Japan in 1904, and it is a simple
tale.  American naval Lieutenant Benjamin Franklin Pinkerton (American
singer Richard Troxell) purchases himself a Japanese wife called
Butterfly (Chinese singer Ying Huang).  The American consul named
Sharpless (American singer Richard Cowan) warns Pinkerton that having a
foreign wife has responsibilities.  Pinkerton ignores this, and much of
the film happens during the three years when he is away.  Although he
sends no money, Butterfly somehow manages to keep up her middle-class
existence as evidenced in her clothes, servants, and housing.  This is
one of the many flaws in the staging.</P>
<P>     The director pays little attention to the singing and music, and
fixes his attention on the play.  His actors try more to speak their
lines than sing them.  The singers he chose have modest voices with
little resonance or interest.  Huang's voice is quite undeveloped and
shallow, and Troxell's voice is a little too high pitched and almost
seems to squeak.  Only Cowan has a voice that commands attention.  The
other singers in the cast are unmemorable.</P>
<P>     Ah, the dialog.  All operas are full of silly little lines, and
this one is no exception.  As Butterfly and her retinue slowly process
up the hill for the wedding, they sing, "So much sun.  So much sky.
Look, we've reached the top.  So many flowers."  When her prospective
bridegroom sees her, he remarks, "She's like a porcelain doll.  She
sets me on fire."</P>
<P>     My biggest problem with the movie is the staging.  The actors give
frozen gestures, and their movements are leaden.  If the singing was
exceptional, you could probably ignore the staging, but it isn't.  The
singers in this film have minuscule acting ability so they bring little
to their roles to compel the audience's attention.  Troxell, for
example, has exactly two expressions.  In the first part of the show,
he has a fake smile glued to his face, and in the last part, he looks
like he is suffering from a chronic case of gas.</P>
<P>     The only reason to bring an opera to the screen is to open it up,
but here most scenes are in or about the house giving the picture a
claustrophobic feeling.  On an opera stage, you would expect this, but
not in a movie.</P>
<P>     As you probably all know, the story has a tragic ending.  Here the
actors' lack of ability mutes its effect, but the ending does breathe
into the show its only semblance of life.  I will say this about the
film, there are a few classic arias that are pleasant to hear again
even if they are not particularly well done.</P>
<P>     On the good side, the cinematography by Philippe Welt and the sets
by Michele Abbe-Vannier are full of warm browns.  The interiors scenes
are the best, and the wooden tones radiate with a peaceful glow.
Exterior shots are less effective, but the ones of the morning haze are
particularly lovely.</P>
<P>     If you do go, make sure you go early or drink lots of coffee.
This film is a great cure for insomnia.  Being a critic, I forced
myself to see it all, and since the press screening was in the morning
after four cups of coffee, I was wide awake.</P>
<P>     MADAME BUTTERFLY runs 2:09.  It is in Italian with English
subtitles.  At the time of the press screening, it was not rated by the
MPAA, but it is a G film for every reason except possibly for the theme
which might get it a PG.  There is no sex, nudity, or bad language.
There is a little underdone and unrealistic violence at the end.  The
film would be fine for any kid old enough to be interested.  I can not
recommend this tepid attempt at turning an opera into a movie.  I give
the movie a single * for a few good arias.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
