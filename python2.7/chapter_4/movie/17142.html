<P>In 1976, director Brian DePalma created a legendary thriller based on a
best-selling novel by the horror-meister himself, Stephen King. Sissy Spacek
played the lead and garnered an Oscar nomination for her role. Even John
Travolta showed up for the fun. Twenty-two years later, in the midst of
teen-flick mania, some wise folks over in Hollywood decided to update the
film for the kids of today. Bad idea.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Girl#1 meets boy#1. Boy#1 sleeps with girl#1. Girl#1 tells her best friend,
girl#2, she really digs the guy. Guy#1 tells his friends that he doesn't
give a crap about girl#1. Girl#1 finds out. Girl#1 does something real nasty
to herself. One of the guy's friends now starts liking girl#2. Is he using
her as well? Does he really like her? Not sure, but either way, girl#2
possesses telekinetic powers by which she can move things with her mind when
she is upset, and hurt people real bad. Enjoy the movie.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Lame, predictable, slow and not scary...and those are its good points! I
wish I could say that this film had something going for it, but it doesn't
even have any cheap T&A shots, pop-culture humor, or one decent, hip teen TV
star to gaze at (Okay, I know the kid from "Home Improvement" is in it, but
he ain't really all that hip.) If you've seen the trailers for this movie,
you've pretty much seen the only exciting parts of this entire film. It
starts off slow, it continues to go slow, and then eventually downshifts
into the most anti-climactic and foreseeable ending this side of the PSYCHO
remake! The best part about this movie is when they splice in shots of the
original CARRIE, and that's not saying much. Amy Irving, we forgive, because
this is the best that you could muster at this point of your career. The
rest of the cast is lame and forgettable, non-withstanding Jason London
(Twin brother of the kid who starred in Kevin Smith's MALLRATS, Jeremy), and
Emily Bergl in her feature film debut.</P>
<P>If you're looking for a bad horror movie, this is it!!! I saw this film at a
sneak preview, where most of the audience got in for free, and even then,
people we're walking out! By the end of this cinematic gig, most people were
rolling in the aisles with laughter, but not because of the humor in the
film, but for the cruel joke that we had all just been a party to. Even the
soundtrack sucked. All in all, I would recommend this film only to those who
love to see bad horror movies, or cheezy remakes that blow chunks.
Otherwise, skip this dull follow-up and rent the original TEXAS CHAINSAW
MASSACRE, if you really want to get the schmekkies scared out of ya!</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Amy Irving actually made her feature film debut in the original CARRIE. She
was the only survivor of the infamous prom night inferno (It's scary to
think that she actually got original director DePalma's okay on this project
as she notes in the press clippings, "I talked to Brian DePalma about it, to
get his blessing, and he thought it was a great idea and I should go for
it."
Emily Bergl, who plays the lead in this incarnation, is also making her
feature film debut. She was originally born in England, but mainly grew up
around the Chicago area. In 1993, she was a national champion in Poetry
Reading (National Forensic League).

MIT with an engineering degree in 1993. His latest role was in Steven
Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.
