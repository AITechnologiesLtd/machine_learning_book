<P>   Opening up on a farm that's so cozy and picturesque that it
seems not of this earth, "Babe: Pig in the City" brings forth
memories of the all-time great animal picture, "Lassie Come
Home."  Like that 1943 masterwork, "Babe" centers on a poor
family, one which may have to sell not only its prized animals
but the entire spread as well.  The soulless bankers have
come with the necessary papers: owners Hoggett (James
Cromwell) and his rotund wife (Magda Szubanski) need a
plan.  While this picture is more fanciful than Fred Wilcox's
1943 film--indeed it is propelled by computer animation which
puts traditionally hostile animals in the same picture talking to
one another--it lacks "Lassie"'s sentimental center, a small
boy (played by the late great Roddy McDowall).  For a good
deal of its 96-minute length it features only animals, forcing
the largely pre-adolescent audience to identify with a pig or
one of her buddies, be it a dog, a kitten, a duck, a goldfish--
even a trio of singing mice that might give Bill Gates ideas. 
Its second flaw is that it lacks the focused plot of its
predecessor, which features the same pair of Hoggetts with
fewer animals, one which kept the audience with both feet off
the floor rooting for the piggy to transcend his breed and
become a sheep dog.   </P>
<P>   The film is directed and co-written by George Miller who
uses Australian director Chris Noonan's 1995 characters
(created by a book written by Dick King-Smith), and once
again combines real animals, animatronic doubles, and
computer technology, while expanding the winning special
effects.</P>
<P>   At the commercial screening I attended on the fourth day of
the film's tenure, the audience of mostly kids were uncannily
quiet throughout, which is a good sign.  Yet I watched two
children, each about six years old, burst into tears near the
beginning and thereafter counted ten family groups quickly
and silently departing the theater. Why the agitation?  It turns
out that this sequel, despite its G rating, has a rather dark
text, welcome enough by in adult movies for viewers who do
not share a audience desire for celluloid elevator music.  But
why the need for grim images in a kids' romp?  I suppose
most fables have their murky side but that's often hidden in
the subtext.  "Babe," however, begins with the good Farmer
Hoggett's falling into a well (which is somehow Babe's fault),
shows him wrapped form head to toe in bandages, his family
gathered around him as though he were on his deathbed.  It
segues into the big city, to which Babe has repaired with Mrs.
Hoggett--who expects to make some money in a shepherding
presentation.  Before the porcine duo can even enter the
shabby, walk-up hotel--all they can afford--Mrs. Hoggett is
strip-searched for drugs behind a curtain after a hard-nosed
narcotics-sniffing beagle has erroneously singled her out.</P>
<P>   The movie is brimming with hostility from both animals and
people.  Virtually every human in the story is antagonistic. 
Hotel owners impolitely refuse to accept animals.  One who
finally does is unsympathetically eccentric, asking a barrage
of questions and answering them all herself.  Animal control
officials brutally round up monkeys, ducks, and dogs,
dragging them with sticks, enveloping them with nets, and
throwing them into trucks.  The pilot of the plane carrying
Hoggett and friend into the city takes off without allowing the
farmer to pack the duck.  What for adults may pass as a
funny scene of a quack-quack flying alongside the aircraft
until he can no longer catch it may be interpreted by the
small fry as its desperate attempt to fly to his adopted family
which appears to have abandoned him.  Most alarming of all,
a bull terrier chasing the pig if only to exercise his territorial
eminence is trapped by his chain and falls over a bridge into
a body of water where he is helplessly suspended upside-
down, thrashing about, head fully submerged.  Director Miller
could have gained sentimental points by tenderly showing
one crippled dog whose owner had the sensitivity to hook him
up to a pair of wheels rather than put him to sleep. Instead
the poor little mutt is dragged by a van going 50 miles an
hour, is unable to disentangle himself, and flips over
helplessly.</P>
<P>   The principal reason to see the film is the imaginative
views which unfold of large, clean cities--presumably New
York, L.A. and Sydney among them--visions that conjure up
recollections of similarly ingenious images in Alex Proyas's
"Dark City" and even Fritz Lang's "Metropolis."  The voices of
the animals are also on the money, especially the tender,
female voice of the title character, whose vocabulary is
formed by E.G. Daily.  Roscoe Lee Browne is exceptionally
warm and fuzzy, delivering the smooth, orotund tones of its
narrator.  (In a display of Hollywood chutzpah, Christine
Cavanaugh, who did Babe's voice in the original film,
demanded more money than she received the first time
around, perhaps believing she could not be replaced.  If I
were not a union man, I would have offered my services for
nothing.)</P>
<P>   "Babe: Pig in the City" almost did not open at its scheduled
November 25 premiere and in fact was screened for critics
only two days in advance.  The official excuse was that the
editing was taking longer than expected.  Actually, the
completed movie went back to the cutting room because of
thumbs-down reactions from preview audiences that got
spooked from its inhumanity.  What emerged could make you
think that the editor went for a cappuccino break rather than
do the necessary cutting.</P>
