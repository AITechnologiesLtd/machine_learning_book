<PRE>DEEP BLUE SEA
USA, 1999
Directed by Renny Harlin
Reviewed by Kent Johnson</PRE>
<P>Tagline:  "You'll believe a shark can suck."</P>
<P>DEEP BLUE SEA is a monster movie about sharks whose brain size and
intelligence are accidentally quintupled by genetic experiments (by
those darn do-gooder scientists who just won't leave well enough alone)
terrorizing an ocean research facility.</P>
<P>The film has great visuals, great underwater photography, great sets,
reasonably convincing animatronic sharks, a good soundtrack, and a lead
actress (Saffron Burrows) with a gorgeous face and a deliciously throaty
British accent.  The filming must have must physically grueling for the
actors and enough money seems to have been spent to support a small
country for a year (not to mention enough water to irrigate all their
crops).</P>
<P>Unfortunately, all of this is in support of an incredibly stupid story.</P>
<P>First there are the standard Hollywood flaws:  The plot is completely
lacking in logic, the characters have no depth and behave stupidly in
order to provide suspense and, the most disappointing for a movie about
smart sharks, the sharks are mere plot devices rather than characters,
possessed of incredible speed, unlikely physical abilities and
supernatural knowledge when convenient to generate suspense, mayhem and
gotchas, but suddenly lacking all these qualities when they're
inconvenient for the characters' survival.</P>
<P>On top of this, the film has several features that push it over into the
"actively offensive" category:</P>
<P>1)  An annoying, heavy-handed and insincere Christian subtext, seemingly
designed to deflect censorship groups who might otherwise protest the
film's violence.</P>
<P>2)  A heavy-handed and insincere pro-black stance.</P>
<P>3)  A heavy-handed anti-genetics-research message.</P>
<P>4)  And, in keeping with its appease-the-censorship-groups policy, a
near-complete lack of the female body.  (A difficult feat for a film
with beautiful women and this much water -- normally the province of
bikinis, wet t-shirts and form-fitting scuba suits.  In fact we see very
little of the actresses other than their faces.)</P>
<P>The film seems to have been custom-designed for censorship groups with
the intelligence of the average shark.  I hope they enjoy it , since no
one else will.</P>
<PRE>Not Recommended.</PRE>
<P>Not worth renting on video either, since the visuals are the film's only
virtue and won't be that impressive on the small screen.</P>
