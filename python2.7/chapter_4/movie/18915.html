Artistic License/Merchant Ivory Films
in Greek with English subtitles

Bebedeli, Iris Chatziantoniou, Helene Gerasimidou, Fabrizio
Bentivoglio, Vassilis Seimenis written by Theo Angelopolous, Tonino
Guerra, Petros Markaris and Giorgio Silvagni
directed by Theo Angelopolous</P>
<P>Theo Angelopolous is considered by some critics to be an excellent
filmmaker. Maybe they see something I don't see, but I absolutely
can't stand the guy. I recently rented "Ulysses' Gaze" --Angelopolous'
best-known film-- and it was just awful. The film was three hours long
and starred Harvey Keitel in multiple roles which he would change back
and forth from without a hint(sometimes he would change characters in
the middle of a scene). Overall, it was a meandering, confusing
"experience". But Angelopolous' trademark is his long, pointless shots
of nothing that he mistakenly calls art. There are a lot of these
shots in the slow, weak, and ambiguously titled "Eternity And A Day".</P>
<P>I say that it's ambiguously titled because apart from its meaning that
pertains to the film it also shows us something about Theo
Angelopolous' filmmaking style. The film seems to last an "eternity",
while the film is supposed to take place in a "day". Please take this
hint, Mr.  Angelopolous.</P>
<P>"Eternity And A Day", which somehow won the Palme D'Or at last year's
Cannes Film Festival, documents a day in the life of Alexander(Bruno
Ganz), an older, Greek man who is "leaving" tomorrow. We never truly
know where he is going, but he keeps reminiscing about a former lover
named Anna(Isabelle Renauld). Their story never really makes much
sense, but it's supposed to blur the lines between pain and
desire. You see, Alexander is a writer/poet who kept his work separate
from his lover and his daughter. But he chose to work on his poetry
and pushed away his family and his love.</P>
<P>The more conventional storyline of the film involves Alexander's
travels with a little, soft-spoken boy whom he has saved from the
hands of the law. The boy is an illegal immigrant from Albania and
Alexander feels that it is his duty to return him to his home. Things
work out a little differently, however.</P>
<P>Also intertwined is the story of a 19th-century Italian poet who came
to Greece and "bought" words so that he would be able to speak their
language. This subplot doesn't seem to have much relevance to the
film, but it takes up some time, which is what Angelopolous really
seems to strive for.</P>
<P>It surprises me that a film with so few words could use four writers...</P>
<P>"Eternity And A Day" is easier to follow than "Ulysses' Gaze"(which
isn't saying much), but it still lacks the quality needed to hold a
picture together. There is absolutely no movement in the film, and no
intrigue either. "Ulysses' Gaze" was partly a political film, but
"Eternity" has nothing to prove, and gives little insight into the
recent turmoil in the Balkan region.</P>
<P>This film won the Palme D'Or at Cannes in 1998 over films such as
"Life Is Beautiful", but it is only now rolling out into a few
theatres in Los Angeles and New York. The Merchant Ivory production
team has added their name to the film, but no major distributor tried
to pick up the film. Theo Angelopolous definitely has stories to tell,
but he needs to learn how to weave his stories into an involving
film.. Otherwise, he should keep them to himself.</P>
<P>Note: "Pulp Fiction" also won the Palme D'Or at Cannes. I didn't find
too many similarities between the two films. Hmm...</P>
