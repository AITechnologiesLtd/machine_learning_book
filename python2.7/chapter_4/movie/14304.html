<PRE>The Conversation
A Review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Gene Hackman; John Cazale; Allen Garfield & Frederic Forrest</P>
<P>If the conversation is not the worst film ever made, it comes real close.
Which is strange, considering it was directed by Francis Coppola, and it
starred Gene Hackman and a young Harrison Ford.</P>
<P>This snoozer starts to go bad from the opening credits. During a long drawn
out surveillance operation, we see a couple having a conversation but can
only here bits and pieces, and really annoying sound effects in between. The
only reason this was included was so that Coppola could show everyone what a
brilliant filmmaker he is. Guess what Francis? It didn't work</P>
<P>Hackman plays Harry Caul, a master surveillance expert. On one of his jobs,
Harry overhears a conversation that could have serious repercussions to
those involved. Harry then has to wrestle with his conscience about whether
to turn the tape over to his employers or not.</P>
<P>That's the plot in a nutshell. The idea for the movie itself is not a bad
one, if done properly. It might have made a good episode of a half hour TV
show, but not a full length feature film. It's just too long, and for no
good reason. The movie ends up being a character study of Caul, and a bad
one at that. We don't really know that much more about Caul at the end of
the movie than at the beginning. For that matter, we really don't want to
either. Harry Caul is one strange dude, not strange in the funny way but
strange in a very distasteful way. This guy is WEIRD. Although he fits in
well, everyone in the film seems to be a few cards short of a full deck.</P>
<P>I'd say something about the lousy acting in the film, but the blame is less
on the actors and more on Coppola's lousy script. The only thing that the
actors should be questioned about is their judgment, as to why they got
involved with this turkey to begin with. As for Francis Coppola, he should
stick to directing and leave the writing to someone who has a clue how to
write a good script.</P>
<P>I don't know how this film could have gotten any worse.</P>
<P>Quite possibly the worst film ever made  0/10</P>
