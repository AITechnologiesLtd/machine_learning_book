<PRE>ELLES
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>If you're a woman who has been apprehensive lately about what your life
may be like after you reach your 40s and 50s, the motion picture ELLES
may provide just the perfect romantic fantasy for you.  Director Luís
Galvão Teles has a vision of your middle age that makes it look
downright desirable.  (His vision for the men looks pretty enjoyable
too, but the focus in this movie is on the women's lives.)</P>
<P>In short, here is what lies ahead.  Your looks will be somewhere between
attractive and downright gorgeous.  With more than enough money, you
will be free to pursue your interests, which include having sex with
some incredible guys who look like they just left a fashion shoot.  And
your age will be no problem for the men, even if you are twice their
age.  Being called their mother will be a bit off-putting, but no fairy
tale is perfect.</P>
<P>And if that doesn't stretch credulity enough, how about this one.
You'll become close friends with your ex, and have romantic dinners
outside with him while you discuss your beautiful and accomplished grown
children.</P>
<P>Starring well-known European actresses Miou-Miou (THE EIGHTH DAY),
Carmen Maura (WOMEN ON THE VERGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN), Marthe Keller
(MARATHON MAN and THE SCHOOL OF FLESH), Marisa Berenson (BARRY LYNDON)
and Guesch Patti, ELLES is a sweet and delicious little confection.</P>
<P>The light, upbeat dialog by the director and Don Bohlinger varies from
the trite to the touching.  The love affair between the professor
(Carmen Maura) and her student is the most passionate and credible.
Their love making, while not that explicit, displays an intensity rarely
seen in American films.</P>
<P>The women briefly suffer some crises toward the end of the story, but
the director wants to make this a feel good film, so he has them
dispatch most of their worries quickly.  Even the guys get to engage in
some fantasies of their own.  Notice that a fair number of the
middle-aged guys hit it off with young, glamorous girlfriends.  Granted
none of this is very credible, but, hey, audiences deserve their dreams.
There are more than enough downer movies to see.</P>
<P>ELLES runs 1:37.  The film is in French with English subtitles.  It is
not rated but would be an R for sex, nudity, profanity and one drug
usage scene and would be fine for older and mature teenagers.</P>
