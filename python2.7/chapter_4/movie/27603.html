<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>Some movies exist to make an important statement, or to shed light on a 
matter of great urgency. Some movies exist just to provoke a basic 
reaction -- to make us laugh, or cry, or scared silly. And then there are 
the movies which exist simply to be watched, that are so visually 
exhilarating that all other matters fall by the wayside. "Crouching Tiger, 
Hidden Dragon" is such a movie.</P>
<P>Director Ang Lee has made a film which is not, in principle, very 
demanding. It is a legend, taking place in the China of two hundred years 
ago, when more modern sensibilities had yet to take hold in the country. 
Being a legend, it weaves a simple, classical tale of love, honour and 
revenge, although it is been populated with characters of unusual 
perception. Even those who misguidedly loathe subtitled films ("Crouching 
Tiger" is in Mandarin) should have little to complain about here; although 
the dialogue certainly adds to the proceedings, they are not difficult to 
follow even without it.</P>
<P>The main attraction of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", though, is quite 
simply the amazing sights Lee arrays before us. He is aided in this 
endeavour by cinematographer Peter Pau, designer Tim Yip, and fight 
choreographer Woo-ping Yuen (who has already dazzled audiences with his 
work on "The Matrix"). It is rare to encounter a movie which is such a 
feast for the eyes. The vistas of the Chinese landscape -- from lush 
valley to desert steppes -- are gloriously filmed, and the unique feel of 
early nineteenth century Beijing is captured impressively.</P>
<P>And then there are the fight scenes. It would be inaccurate to suggest 
that the only reason to see "Crouching Tiger" is because of the material 
arts sequences, but they are undoubtedly the pinnacle of its success. Lee 
and Yuen have managed to elevate fighting to the level of the finest 
ballet, a poetry of fist and foot. Whereas combat has become almost 
perfunctory in most action movies these days, here an evident combination 
of planning and inventiveness pays off wonderfully.</P>
<P>All of the fight sequences are great, but one in particular stands out in 
my mind. In it, the great Wudan warrior Li Mu Bai (Chun-Yow Fat) and his 
young opponent, Jen Yu (the "hidden dragon" of the title, played by Zhang 
Ziyi), stand on branches atop tall trees, which sway as they parley with 
their weapons. (The martial artists in "Crouching Tiger" possess a number 
of superhuman abilities, the most striking of which is the ability to leap 
astonishing distances. It may sound far-fetched, but given the 
mythological trappings of the picture, it works nicely.) Despite their
precarious circumstances, Li and Jen battle on, not just ignoring their 
unusual circumstances but in fact using the unlikely environment to their 
advantage.</P>
<P>This is the sort of scene, like the mindboggling opening shot of the Star 
Destroyer in "Star Wars" or Marlon Brando in "A Streetcar Named Desire" 
crying out Stella's name like a wounded animal, which sears itself 
instantly into the mind. So exquisite and fascinating is it to behold that 
it will not quickly be forgotten. Even more impressive, in this era of 
increasingly sophisticated technology, is the fact that Fat and Ziyi were 
really up there in the trees; computers were used only to erase the wires 
and harnesses from around them in post-production. This lends an 
authenticity to the scene which modern computer animation cannot yet 
reproduce.</P>
<P>The events which lead Li Mu Bai and Jen Yu to those treetops are not 
complicated. Li wishes to retire from active duty, despite the fact that 
he has never gained vengeance against Jade Fox, a duplicitous woman who 
slew his master years earlier. Li gives his ancient, powerful sword, Green 
Destiny, to his longtime friend and fellow mercenary Shu Lien (Michelle 
Yeoh from "Tomorrow Never Dies"; she's the eponymous "crouching tiger") to 
deliver to a politician in Beijing who has been an ally to them. Not long 
after Shu Lien arrives in the city, however, the Green Destiny is stolen.</P>
<P>The culprit turns out to be Jen, the daughter of a minister who is 
destined to soon enter into an arranged marriage. Jen chafes at the 
restrictions placed on her future and longs for the life of the warrior. 
(She is a perfect counterpart to Shu Lien, who shares an unspoken love for 
Li Mu Bai which they can never consummate, and who wishes to settle down 
and lead a quieter life.) Jen is secretly the promising apprentice of Jade 
Fox (Pei-pei Cheng), and when Li Mu Bai arrives in Beijing and learns of 
the theft of his blade, history may be doomed to repeat itself.</P>
<P>The visual majesty of "Crouching Tiger" is supported by several fine 
performances, with Yeoh a particular standout. Like any good legend, there 
is a pleasing variety in approach: despite all the melodrama and melee, 
Lee leaves room for humour, such as when Jen takes on an entire bar full 
of hostile warriors. And there is also an unmistakable vein of 
spirituality running throughout the film, as Lee seeks to examine the 
notion of identity -- one of the meanings of the title is a reference to 
aspects of one's own personality which can lie buried until finally coming 
to the fore.</P>
<P>If "Crouching Tiger" has its flaws, it is in terms of the storytelling, 
which is occasionally awkward. For example, in the middle of the movie is 
an extended flashback, revealing the origins of Jen's rebellion. As a 
self-contained entity, it's well-conceived, but it is an unwieldy fit at 
this point in the film, basically forcing the main action to come to a 
lengthy halt.</P>
<P>Regardless, "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" is a real treat. And it is a 
film which absolutely has to be seen to be appreciated. Much as one 
picture is worth a thousand words, no amount of text could possibly come 
close to describing the majesty and beauty of its images.</P>
