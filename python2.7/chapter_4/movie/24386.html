<P>Boy-and-his-dog tales are one of the oldest staples in Hollywood. From
Lassie to Old Yeller to Shiloh, they've defined the "family movie" and
captured the hearts of generations. My Dog Skip, the latest in the
genre, is one of the best films of its kind. It's remarkable because it
doesn't patronize or condescend -- this is truly a family movie, not a
kids' movie. With its distinctive, unsentimental tone, it's a moving
experience that never descends into melodrama and hokum. My dog's name
is Phil. He's a cocker spaniel. While not the trained movie pet Skip
is, he's a hell of a dog. This movie made me realize how much I value
my pet -- my friend, my companion.
Before he found fame on the popular new tv show Malcolm in the Middle,
young Frankie Muniz played Willie, a boy growing up in 1940's Missouri.
He's not very social; all the kids at school make fun of him and the
bullies cruelly taunt him. He doesn't have any friends his age; his
birthday party invitation list consists of his parents and
grandparents. His only companion is neighbor Dick Jenkins (Luke
Wilson), an athlete whom all the kids in the town look up to.</P>
<P>That all changes when, for his birthday, Willie's mom (Diane Lane)
gives him a puppy. Willie names the terrier Skip but his dad (Kevin
Bacon) thinks that he is not ready for a dog and tries to take Skip
away. Mom and Skip win out in the end, however, and Willie gets to keep
the dog. The two quickly become best companions and with Skip's help,
Willie wins the friendship of the people who made fun of him most
vigorously as well as the affections of the prettiest girl in school.</P>
<P>There is also a subplot about moonshiners who, for some reason, hide
their booze in an old cemetery crypt. It does little except create
vital conflicts for the dynamic duo of Willie and Skip to deal with.
There's so little lip service paid to these scenes that the movie all
but acknowledges the subplot as a mere plot device, thereby making it
especially convenient for us to ignore it. My Dog Skip tackles the age-
old concept of a dog being a boy's best friend but it takes it one step
further: Skip isn't merely Willie's friend, he's his key to society.
The dog opens up new possibilities for him, helps him make friends,
enjoy childhood. This isn't necessarily a case of a boy moving up in
the world simply because of possessions either: once he's in he stays
in with character, heart and compassion. While the dog is given its
fair due, by the end of the film most of the emphasis has been placed
on the human. We really feel that Willie has been changed forever. And
we see why.</P>
<P>Muniz is a wonderful actor mainly because of his penchant for
downplaying crucial scenes. He's a real kid rather than a movie kid and
anyone who's ever been in his situation can identify with him. He
doesn't come off as a phony. Kevin Bacon does come off as a bit of a
phony -- too thoughtless at first (sometimes, puffing his cigar, he
seems genuinely malevolent) and then becoming a caring father too
quickly. But I suppose this is what the character would seem like to a
grown man remembering his childhood.</P>
<P>The end of the film brought tears to my eyes because it hits the nail
squarely on the head. If a pet has the more of an influence on a
person's life than most of the humans, it does not mean that he is
antisocial. As anyone who has ever had a dog knows, a canine is often
the most steadfast, loyal friend you'll have. They can change your
life, mend your heart, listen to your troubles and lift your spirits.
My Dog Skip is about a dog that taught a troubled young boy how to
live.</P>
