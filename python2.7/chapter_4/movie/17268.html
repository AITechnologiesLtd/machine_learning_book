<PRE>YOU'VE GOT MAIL by DeWyNGaLe    * * *</PRE>
<P>Meg Ryan is Kathleen Kelly, the owner of the cute children's book store, Shop
Around The Corner.  It is a business that has been going on for years, and was
previously owned by her mother.  Kathleen is a sweet, funny, nice type of
person who loves kids.  One of her favorite things to do is log on to American
Online.  Her screen name is ShopGirl.  She chats with someone named NY152 every
day, and they are the greatest of friends.  They don't go into specifics, but
they just have a simple friendship.  But now, The Shop Around The Corner is
having a problem.  A store called Fox Books has moved in right across the
street!  It is owned by Joe Fox. (Tom Hanks) This store is huge, with many
floors of books and magazines.  Their goal is to put every bookstore in New
York City out of business.</P>
<P>Joe Fox also loves American Online.  There, he chats with a girl named
ShopGirl.  They are the best of friends but they don't take their friendship
into specifics.  He knows nothing about her.  His screen name is NY152.  He
meets Kathleen Kelly at The Shop Around The Corner when he is trying to buy out
their inventory of books that Fox Books doesn't have.  He simply states his
name is Joe.  They continue to meet around the city and she discovers that he
is Joe Fox, the man that is going to put her out of business.  The two of them
still don't know that they are in love on America  Online.  They fight and
fight and fight whenever they see each other.  These arguments are quite
humourous.  </P>
<P>NY152 asks ShopGirl if they should meet.  They plan to meet at the Coffee Shop.
 ShopGirl is waiting and waiting at a table with a present for NY152.  When
NY152 discovers that ShopGirl is Kathleen Kelly, he freaks out, for he is Joe
Fox.  He enters the coffee shop not telling her who he is.  He simply sits down
and annoys her to death. He doesn't mean to, but she takes it that way.  Now
that he knows that they are actually perfect for each other, he is extra nice
to her.  The next day he brings her flowers and stays in her apartment and
chats with her for awhile. Eventually, he asks ShopGirl to meet again over
America Online.  They do, and they discover that they were in love the entire
time.  Kathleen simply states "I wanted it to be you."</P>
<P>You've Got Mail is a nice, cute movie with some good laughs.  Tom Hanks and Meg
Ryan are so wonderful together.  Both did great jobs of acting.  You've Got
Mail shows that sometimes if you look beyond the business in people, they may
be just right for you.  Although at some points in the movie, it seemed a
little slow, the overall product was great.  Warner Brothers is out of the
slump and definitely has a hit.  America Online is supporting this movie a
great deal.  They even have a feature where you can E-Mail Tom Hanks and Meg
Ryan under their screen names in the movie.  Parker Posey, Dave Chapelle, and
Greg Kinnear also have smaller supporting rolls.  Parker Posey plays Joe's
girlfriend, Dave Chapelle plays his friend, and Greg Kinnear plays Kathleen's
boyfriend.  The bottom line: Not Oscar Material, but a wonderful movie for all
of you AOL lovers out there.</P>
