PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></PRE>
<P>Two time Academy Award nominee John Hurt (Midnight Express and The
Elephant Man) and two time Golden Globe nominee Jason Priestley (Beverly
Hills, 90210) have finally joined forces to make a film.  Given their
powerful fan base and undeniable charisma, it was certainly bound to
happen sooner or later.</P>
<P>Hurt plays Giles De'Ath (insert joke here), an uptight London recluse
who only communicates with a few snooty friends and his housekeeper.
One day, De'Ath locks himself out of his apartment during a thunderstorm
and, while waiting for a spare key to arrive, notices a billboard for
the latest film adaptation of a E.M. Forester novel.  To keep dry, he
goes to the local multiplex, but accidentally stumbles in to the theater
showing Hot Pants College 2.  Instead of being turned off by the
disgusting American filth, De'Ath finds himself strangely and
inexplicably transfixed to actor Ronnie Bostock (Priestley).</P>
<P>Unable to erase Bostock's image from his mind, De'Ath starts to collect
teenybopper magazines featuring his image.  He carefully clips the
photos and puts them into a scrapbook titled `Bostockiana'.  De'Ath also
buys tapes of Bostock's previous work, but has no TV or VCR to watch
them.  In a particularly funny scene, he takes a trip to the local
mega-appliance store and inadvertently mistakes a microwave for a
television before a bewildered employee.</P>
<P>The next `logical' step in his obsession is to travel to the sleepy Long
Island town where Bostock lives.  He befriends Bostock's live-in lover
(Fiona Loewi), who is impressed by De'Ath's remarkable knowledge of her
boyfriend's relatively unimpressive career.  The two finally meet in a
strange mismatch of age and culture.  Talk about an unconventional
story!</P>
<P>Writer/Director Richard Kwietniowski has certainly crafted an unusual
feature film debut.  He has given Hurt, who is probably best known for
having the Alien burst from his chest, his best role in years.  I was
going to say his strangest role in years, but then I remembered the
wealthy freak he played in Contact, which wasn't too long ago at all.
The perpetually sideburned Priestley, on the other hand, may or may not
be acting as the idiot American hunk.  His part must have been written
for him or some dolt just like him.</P>
<P>Love and Death garnered Kwietniowski a Golden Camera nominee (for
direction) at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival and also won praise at the
Chicago International Film Festival.  It will probably find a larger
audience (and onto more screens) in Canada, where Priestley calls home.
I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for the commercial during 90210.</P>
