<PRE>TIMECODE
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 2000 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>***1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        "Timecode" is a brilliantly conceived and executed piece of
experimental filmmaking that questions the notions of traditional narrative
cinema by challenging the very way in which we view movies.</P>
<PRE>        That's the good news.</PRE>
<P>        The bad news is that it's written and directed (and produced and
scored and photographed!) by Mike Figgis, the man who made the overrated
drunk drama "Leaving Las Vegas," and the worst thing about it is that it
continues his sophomoric preoccupation with sex.</P>
<P>        But "Timecode," easily his finest work to date, is so different, so
creative a motion picture that even I could put away my anti-Figgis
sentiments for an hour and a half and enjoy the film purely on its own
considerable merits.</P>
<P>        Watching "Timecode" is like no other cinematic experience and you'd
be well advised to sit further back than usual, since your eyes will be
wandering--sometimes racing--all over the screen.  The film is actually
four separate yet (as time will tell) linked films presented in four
panels, so in the top right-hand corner of the screen, for example, we have
a woman talking to her psychiatrist while in the bottom left-hand corner of
the screen someone else is auditioning for a part in a Z-grade exploitation
flick.</P>
<P>        Each sequence is shot in one continuous take with no edits.  One
uninterrupted 93-minute take, to be precise, since that's exactly how long
a digital videocassette runs.  But it *feels* like there are edits, because
by the time your eye returns to one of the segments the action is closer
in, or further out, or in a completely different place.</P>
<P>        The actors, among them Salma Hayek, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Stellan
Skarsgård, Holly Hunter, Saffron Burrows, Kyle MacLachlan, Julian Sands,
Richard Edson, Glenne Headly, Leslie Mann, and Steven Weber, improvise
around a loosely-structured narrative that requires them to do certain
things and be certain places at specific times--synchronized right down to
the millisecond.  What we see on the screen, therefore, are four distinct
storylines that, over time, come together--overlapping and interacting.
It's truly invigorating watching how characters that were once "down there"
are now "up here."</P>
<P>        Figgis, I hate to admit it, orchestrates the whole thing
beautifully, so that from time to time all four sequences "match," or run
parallel, while at other times they're completely out of sync.  And the
experience of watching the film is sensational, since it requires a
different *method* of viewing depending upon what's happening on screen at
any one time.  For example, at points in the film you can leisurely move
your head in a slow continuous circle, absorbing each of the disparate
stories, yet at other times you have to move your eyes quickly, scanning
each different area for clues.</P>
<P>        In-jokes abound, and Figgis is not afraid to make fun of himself or
his trade (note the surreal scene towards the end in which a diaphanous
beauty pitches her own familiar-sounding experimental treatment accompanied
by a rapper-keyboardist named Joey Z).  Every now and again there's an
earthquake, a minor tremor that rumbles through each of the four quadrants
sending our actors tumbling and reminding us, as if we needed reminding,
that these four stories are not only linked, but happening in real time.
But in the end the near-irrelevant "plot" takes second place to the film's
structure (and it's just as well, because I'd swear that Figgis came up
with the idea of having Hayek and Tripplehorn making out in the back of a
limo before he came up with his revolutionary four-camera technique!).</P>
<P>        If you're not into film, the medium, and the concept of a highly
structural film experience, then the novelty of "Timecode" might grow
tiresome very quickly.  But if you can allow yourself to put aside all
traditional expectations--just as I was able to put aside my tiny problem
of this being a Mike Figgis film--then you might just find it absolutely
fascinating.</P>
