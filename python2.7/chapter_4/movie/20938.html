<PRE>A Prodigious Blastoff
October Sky</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Across a starry October sky in 1957 a single object shined like a shooting
star in slow motion over the little town of Coalwood, West Virginia. This
spark, the Soviet satellite Sputnik, ignited the wick-like gaze of one
miner's son, Homer (Gyllenhaal); lighting in him a burning desire to become
a rocket scientist. The rest of the mining community had spent much too much
time underground, "Maybe it's a missile," one older gentleman figur's. The
reply, "Naw, droppin' one on this place, just be a waste of a bomb." The
younger generation was no more open-minded, "Let 'em have outer space -- we
got rock and roll!"</P>
<P>No passion for coal mining digging inside him, and a push over on the
football field, Homer had finally found something to shoot for, "I'mma build
rockets." Unfortunately, Homer's "John Wayne" father (Cooper) had no idea
how to respect a son who couldn't mine or stop a running back. This is the
major conflict. Will the adolescent son be strong enough to sell his lofty
dreams to a father who only dreams of coal?</P>
<P>The plot follows the usual formula, so that were it a rocket, one could
predict within a matter of feet where it would land. But don't let that stop
you from coming' out to view "October Sky". The acting is strong, the
direction tight, the music and cinematography dramatic. It's a solid
engaging film.</P>
<P>Starring Jake GyllenHaal and Chris Cooper.
Directed by Joe Johnston.
Produced by: Charles Gordon and Larry Franco at Universal/Charles Gordon
Rated PG.</P>
<P>Grade..........................B+</P>
