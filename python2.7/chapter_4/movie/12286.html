<PRE>The Object of My Affection (R) ***
Sliding Doors (PG-13) ***</PRE>
<P>Frothy romantic comedies have become so commonplace at the cinema that
filmmakers now generally resort to gimmicks to set their films apart.  Two
romantic comedies currently in release, The Object of My Affection and
Sliding Doors, each employ a twist that gives its film a certain
uniqueness, but in both cases the gimmicks work.</P>
<P>The Object of My Affection roughly fits the romantic comedy mold.  It has
its share of humorous moments and a romantic issue at its heart, which is
where its twist lies.  After being jilted by his lover Dr. Robert Joley
(Tim Daly), gay elementary school teacher George Hanson (Paul Rudd) moves
in and instantly becomes best friends with social worker Nina Borowski
(Jennifer Aniston).  When Nina discovers that she is pregnant by her
less-than-reliable boyfriend lawyer Vince McBride (John Pankow), she asks
George to be the child's acting father.  His acceptance, not surprisingly,
leads to some emotional complications for the both of them.</P>
<P>More of a surprise is that these complications don't necessarily come
dressed in laugh-ready packages.  Director Nicholas Hytner and writer Wendy
Wasserstein, working from the novel by Stephen McCauley, while frequently
throwing in a comic zinger or situation or two, deal rather seriously with
the relationship issues being raised.  While this approach will certainly
disappoint those looking for a lark like Aniston's Picture Perfect, it was
perhaps the best way to go.  To go for cheap laughs would have been to
cheapen the characters, in particular Nina, whose ever-growing but hopeless
love for George achieves true poignancy.  Adding to the poignancy is the
terrific, natural chemistry between Aniston and Rudd; even though one knows
a romance is impossible, they are such a perfect screen match that one
cannot help but develop a rooting interest for their coupledom.  I just
wish that the character of Vince was better written.  One minute he's a
jerk, the next he's surprisingly gentle; he doesn't quite make sense, and
as such, Nina's initial devotion to him doesn't quite either.</P>
<P>On paper, the twist of Sliding Doors appears too high-concept for its own
good.  Helen (Gwyneth Paltrow, sporting the flawless British accent she
adopted in Emma), freshly fired from her job at a PR agency, rushes to
catch the next train home.  The doors on the train car close just as she
reaches them.  But wait--the film rewinds, and suddenly Helen manages to
squeeze her way into the train as the doors close.  From here on out,
Sliding Doors intercuts between the parallel tales of the two Helens: Helen
"A," who misses the train, and Helen "B," who makes the train. </P>
<P>Helen "B," having made the train, arrives home in time to find her live-in
boyfriend Gerry (John Lynch) in bed with sultry, slightly unhinged former
flame Lydia (Jeanne Tripplehorn).  In a tiff, Helen leaves him, gets a
makeover, and starts a relationship with James (John Hannah), a friendly
Scottish gent she met on the train.  Helen "A" not only misses the train;
she is also mugged, which makes her arrive home long after Gerry and
Lydia's tryst, of which she remains not-so-blissfully unaware.  In
following the two Helens, writer-director Peter Howitt shows how one
simple, chance occurrence can alter the course of a person's life.</P>
<P>Or does he?  What makes Sliding Doors so unique and rather
thought-provoking is how Howitt holds true to the idea of chance while at
the same time subscribing to that of destiny.  The two stories are
distinctly different, but Howitt comes up with clever "intersections"
between the plots, with certain touchstone events occurring in both stories
(albeit in slightly altered ways), believably showing how, no matter what
happens, the hand of fate is inescapable.  Also inescapable is the type of
person one is, and this is best exemplified by Gerry, who is a cheating
lout in both stories--which is the film's one problem.  Although he appears
to have some genuine fondness for Helen, he is on the whole an unappealing
character, making the story of Helen "A" less vibrant and involving than
the "B" tale, which is highlighted by Hannah's delightfully witty James.</P>
<P>Ultimately, however, the effectiveness of The Object of My Affection and
Sliding Doors is not due to the gimmicks themselves but the filmmakers who
use them with care, intelligence, and style.  If it weren't for their
talent and savvy, the two films could have easily fallen into the gimmicky
romantic comedy scrap heap, an undistinguished group that includes the
execrable likes of Made in America and Mrs. Winterbourne.  And for that,
every moviegoer in the world owes a debt of gratitude.</P>
