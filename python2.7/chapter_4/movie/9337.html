                                EVITA
                    A film review by Andrew Hicks
                     Copyright 1997 Andrew Hicks</PRE>
<PRE>(1996) ** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        I've always liked Madonna's music, although we all know 
her movie performances are, for the most part, lackluster. That's why 
it was good news to find out her performance in EVITA is 98% 
singing. Now that I've finally seen it, though, I realize that's also the 
bad news. Everything in EVITA is sung, which makes it hard for 
most viewers to retain interest after the first hour. Even the most 
musical musicals consist of at least 50% dialogue, which makes 
EVITA some kind of genetic strand of hyper-musical.</P>
<P>        EVITA tells the story of Eva Peron, one of Argentina's 
most beloved historical figures and one of the longest running 
contemporary Broadway musicals. A lot of the Andrew Lloyd Webber 
/ Tim Rice songs are catchy, yeah, but (as Roger Ebert pointed out) 
it's because you end up hearing most of them five or six times 
through the course of the movie. Around the fourth reprise of "Don't 
Cry For Me, Argentina," I was about ready to burst into tortured tears 
of repetition.</P>
<P>        Madonna, of course, plays Eva from the age of 15 or so, 
which is completely unconvincing. You'd have to be pretty stressed 
out to have crow's feet in high school. The teenage Evita convinces a 
visiting singer she's sleeping with (which in Madonna's case is 
completely convincing at any age) to take her back to Buenos Aires 
with him. He does, but their association ends there. Eva makes it in 
the big city because she has that certain Madonna-esque quality, her 
stylish antics accounting more for her success than her voice or 
acting abilities. Art imitates life, you know.</P>
<P>        Evita becomes semi-famous with her radio program, but 
much more famous when she joins forces with Juan Peron (Jonathan 
Pryce), an authoritarian army officer who becomes leader of the 
country thanks to Evita's endless campaigning. The peasants love her 
because they sense she came from among them to make something of 
herself, although she never actually accomplishes much on their 
behalf aside from tossing money out a train window while she sings a 
gleeful song. Antonio Banderas, as some kind of singing narrator / 
collective peasant conscience, is always around to question her 
motives through cynical song, which doesn't lend the film any 
dramatic credibility.</P>
<P>        What's good about EVITA is the occasional gleeful song. 
Three highlights are Madonna singing "I'd Be Surprisingly Good For 
You" to Pryce, the one toward the beginning where she's trying to 
persuade her singer / lover to bring her along, and "Rainbow High," a 
showtune version of "Material Girl." And of course there's "You Must 
Love Me," the painful ballad that comes during Eva's dying days. 
Evita died at age 33, but from the denouement of this movie, it would 
seem like she lived for decades and decades. Around the fifth she's-
going-to-die-and-aren't-we-sad song, I was ready to yank the plug 
myself.</P>
<P>        The film does have a huge, epic scope. Director Alan Parker 
put a lot of effort into making EVITA an eventa, but in the end it's the 
singing and the epic length that bring this movie down. When going 
for emotional drama, a song doesn't cut it cinematically, and on the 
larger scope action scenes, a disco rock score is used. It helps to note 
that EVITA producer Robert Stigwood also produced the 1978 
Frampton / Bee Gee abortion SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS 
CLUB BAND.</P>
