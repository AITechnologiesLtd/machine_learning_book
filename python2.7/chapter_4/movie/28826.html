<P>You don't see too many gorgeous, heartwarming romances with a G-rating
slapped on them, but that's exactly what Zhang Yimou's The Road Home is.  No
spotted puppies or animated Rugrats here; just the story of love blossoming
in the hearts of two young people in a bleak mountain village in North
China.</P>
<P>Home is narrated by Luo Yusheng (Sun Honglei), who, as the film opens, has
just been called back to his hometown of Sanhetun because of the sudden
death of his father, who was the town's schoolteacher.  Yusheng explains
that he, like most of the village's other young men, have left the rustic
hamlet for work in larger cities, and this is the first time he has returned
in years.</P>
<P>When he arrives in Sanhetun, Yusheng is approached by the town's Mayor
(Chang Guifa), who delicately explains the unusual situation.  Yusheng's
father, Changyu, is still in the hospital, which is located miles and miles
away through the mountains.  His mother, Zhao Di (Yuelin Zhao), who has been
grieving in front of the schoolhouse since her husband's passing, insists
the town follow an ancient funeral custom in which the casket is carried, by
hand, into town by the village's men (presumably so he never forgets his way
home).</P>
<P>Yusheng unsuccessfully tries to get his mother to change her mind, and as
she begins to weave a traditional funeral cloth on her rickety loom, he
thinks about the stories he's heard throughout his life about the atypical
courtship at a time when arranged marriages were the standard.  Home then
flashes back to 1958 for the following hour, where we see the young,
beautiful Zhao Di (Zhang Ziyi, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) pursue
Sanhetun's handsome new schoolteacher, who, of course, is Changyu (Zheng
Hao).  The shift from present to past is done nicely, as the latter shows Di
at the loom preparing a special red banner than will adorn the village's new
school.</P>
<P>As Changyu and the locals build the school, Di carefully prepares delicious
dishes to take to the work site, with hopes her dreamboat will be the one to
devour her eats.  She even begins to use a long abandoned well just because
it brings her closer to the school and Changyu.  Initially, most of Di's
actions go unnoticed, but he eventually comes around when it's her turn to
host Changyu for dinner.  There's the potential for some tragedy and
heartbreak, but we already know they end up together, so the concern is
fairly minimal.</P>
<P>Yimou breaks the formula typically found in flashback films by having the
15-minute, present-day bookends shot in black and white, while the "meat" of
the film is in color.  This works nicely in the transition toward the end of
the film that shows the bright red banner in the brand-new schoolhouse
becoming a dingy gray banner in the decrepit schoolhouse.  It's also
interesting to see the complete lack of change between 1958 and present-day
Sanhetun (the only noticeable upgrades are the two Titanic posters on the
wall of Yusheng's old house).</P>
<P>Home won an Audience Award at this year's Sundance Film Festival, as well as
a Silver Bear at the recent Berlin fest.  Yimou keeps things moving at a
nice pace (the film barely cracks the 90-minute mark), even though there are
decently sized stretches with no dialogue.  The film is beautifully
photographed (by Yimou's Not One Less' Hou Yong) and gorgeously lit, which
you'd expect from a director who used to be a cinematographer.  Like Less,
Yimou uses a cast made up largely of non-actors (Ziyi actually filmed this
before Crouching Tiger).  The only major complaint is Home's constantly
swelling score, which becomes increasingly annoying throughout the picture.</P>
