<PRE>A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>The Virgin Suicides is a great film because it asks the audience to interpret 
character interactions and the overall meaning of the film. At its closing, I 
felt like seeing it again to examine the relationships between everyone more 
closely. One would really have to see this movie again in order to fully take 
in its drama and purpose. This gorgeous, dreamy film is definitely worth a 
second viewing.</P>
<P>Mr. Lisbon (James Woods) and Mrs. Lisbon (Kathleen Turner) live in an 
alternate universe that isn't quite explainable. Each of their five 
daughters, Cecilia (Hanna R. Hall), Lux (Kirsten Dunst), Bonnie (Chelse 
Swain), Mary (A.J. Cook), and Therese (Leslie Hayman) get kept in the house 
under close watch at all times. They cannot go out with anyone, or 
participate in social events outside of school. This of course drives the 
local boys crazy. They often dream of conquering the unconquerable Lisbon 
sisters. Everything changes when Cecilia, the youngest of the sisters at only 
thirteen, attempts suicide. Her psychiatrist (a short appearance from Danny 
Devito) suggests they throw a party, and give her more chances to interact 
with males her own age. The boy's sexuality gets further awakened as they try 
to comprehend and become a part of the girlâ€™s world they get introduced to. 
As the film continues, the girls begin to decide their fates and the boys 
love for them becomes even greater.</P>
<P>There is a reason this movie's title is The Virgin Suicides. Anyone looking 
for even remotely happy or exciting entertainment should look elsewhere. This 
is a very heavy film, but one that doesn't lose interest, and isn't too slow. 
The topic of teen suicide gets handled with the greatest of care. The movie 
takes place in the 1970s when teen suicide wasn't as big of an issue as it is 
today. Reactions to the suicides by neighbors, reporters, and teenagers are 
an interesting addition that shows speculation on the Lisbon sisters isnâ€™t 
just a teenage guy thing. The surprising lack of grief for the lost sister 
shows what a different family this is. â€œThe girls walked into school like 
nothing had happened.â€? says the narrator.</P>
<P>Since the movie gets told almost entirely in flashback by the boys, (the 
narrator is Giovanni Ribisi) we get just as confused about what's going on in 
the Lisbon household as they were. The reasons why Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon are so 
strict with their children never get fully explained. Mr. Lisbon frequently 
tunes in and out of a conversation, and often rattles on about the great 
flying machines, and how they won us the war. Mrs. Lisbon insists the girls 
go to church so that they can absorb the Catholic faith. Both parents are a 
little out of it. The beauty of the girls and some wonderful shots from 
director Sofia Coppola make this a stunning and dreamlike fantasy. A fantasy 
that ends in an inevitable shocking horror.</P>
<P>The acting is superb. Kirsten Dunst has never been more appealing, and she's 
a standout from the other Lisbon girls. James Woods and Kathleen Turner are 
also very good as the two parents. They perfectly convey their feelings while 
still making us wonder what's going on in their heads. Hopefully this movie 
will make parents think about talking and listening to their children more. 
Maybe if the parents had listened or done something different, nothing would 
have happened. </P>
<P>The awkwardness and confusion felt by the boys is what this movie is all 
about. No matter where they are today, whether it's in drug rehab, still 
living in the same town, or thousands of miles away, no boy living at that 
time in that place will ever forget the Lisbon sisters. The thought of 
conquering the unconquerable as mentioned earlier still exists in their mind. 
The love, mystery, and bewilderment of their universe linger as well. They 
can't forget the sisters, neither can I.</P>
