<P>LIVE FLESH (CARNE TRÉMULA)(director/writer: Pedro Almodovar;
screenwriters: Ray Loriga/Jorge Guerricaechevarria; cinematographer:

Javier Bardem (David), Jose Sancho (Sancho), Angela Molina (Clara),
Penelope Cruz (Isabel), 1997 - Spain)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>It is a politically oppressive climate in the Madrid of the 1970s, with
the dictator Franco in power. A woman gives birth on a city bus during
Christmas time and the city honors her and her new born son, Victor
(Liberto), with a lifetime bus pass.Victor's mom supports her son by
being a prostitute.</P>
<P>The film flashes to 20 years later and we see Victor, and he seems to be
a social misfit, angry and disappointed that the beautiful, druggie,
Italian diplomat's girl Elena (Neri), the one he made love to (for him
it was the first time he ever made love) in a public toilet a week ago,
has broken her date with him because she thinks he is a jerk and a lousy
lay. A disasterous evening follows, as he tries to force his way into
her apartment to get an explanation for why she has rejected him, as
cops are called to the scene, and he ends up shooting and paralysing one
of the cops, David (Bardem). That is the cop Elena is immediately
smitten with upon seeing him enter the room. The other cop, Sancho
(Sancho), goads Victor unnecessarily into trying to wrestle the gun out
of his hand and the gun goes off hitting David, causing the injury.
Sancho, in response to the inward tension that was eating at him,
suspecting his wife of cheating on him, took out his jealous hatred on
the unfortunate Victor. So goes a story filled with coincidences,
frame-ups, despair, psychological traumas, political digressions, lies,
revenge, Biblical allusions to redemption, and marriage-go-rounds.</P>
<P>Victor is released from prison after serving 6-years, a time he spent
bulking-up, reading the Bible, learning Bulgarian (that's a funny one!),
and swearing he would learn how to make love to a woman.</P>
<P>Victor, upon his release from prison, immediately makes contact with and
starts an affair with Sancho's wife (Angela). Her husband is the cop who
caused his arrest.</P>
<P>He also finds that Elena is married to the paralysed cop, David, who is
now a star basketball player on Spain's special olympic team. Elena
cleaned up her act and is working as a director of a school, where he
finagles his way into a job there since he is so naturally good around
children. His motive in returning to see Elena, is to take her to bed
and show her how he has become a good lay and to show her what she is
missing by not being with him. The only problem with his strategy, is
that she is not happy to see him.</P>
<P>There are too many coincidences for me to be wholly convinced that I am
not being manipulated into accepting a story with a certain political
agenda to it, but there are so many wonderful gripping and beautifully
done scenes, that I found I was taken in by the relationships going on
and curious about what would happen to these folks, and glad that
Almodovar (Dark Habits, High Heels, Women on the Verge of a Nervous
Breakdown) has chosen to make a film this time that has a story that
makes some sense. I found most of his other films to be basically
sexually bizarre, with storylines that were not particularly lucid.</P>
<P>Clara, who is only a minor figure in this story, nevertheless, her story
is the one that moved me the most. Her failed marriage and her need to
be loved and love someone, was the most pathetic characterization in the
film, outside of Victor's.</P>
<P>The strength in the film was in the showing of the strong erotic links
to each of the main characters in the story through Victor's eyes. Elena
showed that she could change from the strung-out druggie depicted in her
first encounters with Victor, into becoming a respectable wife and
do-gooder. Victor could become the lover he never was and find a way to
redemption for his past injustices. His story is the most challenging
one, and the one that is hardest to comprehend. He is symbolic of modern
Spain.</P>
<P>Almodovar has shot a sophisticated film about characters who really
develop character-wise and who are in-tune with the times they live in.
Almodovar, by his intermingling of the past and the present with the
strange mixture of politics and religion that changes with the times,
has created a fascinating look at Spain in the 20th century. What he
shows, are the diverse ingredients found in modern day Spain that makes
his country so unique.</P>
<P>The closing optimistic scene of the politically new Madrid, the one
without the ruthless dictator Franco, who died of a heart attack in his
bed, is opposite from the opening scene of the oppressively sullen
Madrid. This film is definetly one of Almodovar's more resolute efforts.</P>
