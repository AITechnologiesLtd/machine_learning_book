                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
         3 :-) :-) :-) for an artistic psychological thrill ride</PRE>
<P>Cast: John Travolta, Nicolas Cage, Joan Allen, Gina Gershon, Alessandro
Nivola, Dominique Swain, Nick Cassavetes, Harve Presnell, Colm Feore,
Margaret Cho Director: John Woo Screenplay: Mike Werb & Michael Colleary</P>
<P>Today's modern standards of plastic surgery haven't quite reached the
pinnacle of sophisticated ‘face lifting and shifting' so fancifully
displayed in this montage of action packed thrills. This however,
doesn't detract from the fundamental key elements of ‘gut wrenching'
anguish, ‘edge of the seat' suspense and ‘bladder-bursting to go'
tension generated by this John Woo movie.</P>
<P>If violence can be described as artistic, then ‘Face/Off' is the movie
to watch. John Woo has the impeccable flare of a master demolition
expert combined with the talents of a maestro painter; who uses the
brush strokes of exploding boats, flying bodies and two talented actors
to help colour the doll canvass of the big screen. John Travolta and
Nicholas Cage are two actors of commendable note-worthiness, who not
only switch faces but also families and identities. Their complex
characterisations and improvisations of the characters Sean Archer and
Castor Troy, are best appreciated when standing behind the other's face.</P>
<P>Sean Archer (Travolta), the deputy in charge of the special services
division of anti-terrorism is hell-bent on catching terrorist Castor
Troy (Cage). Troy the magnificently insane creator of chaos, is amongst
other things the executioner of Archer's son's life. The chase, which
carries more than a heart beat of professionalism, has now become a
personal vendetta for vengeance. It is Archer's way of overcoming the
grief of his lost son, and also the means of resolving the remorse of
survivor's guilt - ‘why didn't I die instead?'</P>
<P>It is when Travolta becomes Cage, and Troy becomes Archer that things
begin to heat up on screen. Memorably and ironically, each is given the
opportunity to change, alter and\or destroy the worlds of their most
hated enemy. Troy the Terrorist is given the chance to become Archer the
Hero. The egotistical villain grasps the addictive opportunities for
much needed attention with two very greedy hands. So much so he defuses
his own bomb to get blazing national praise and personal glorification.
His opportunities include the sick urge to satisfy his enemy's wife in
bed, by becoming the alluring gentleman that never was; visiting the
grave of the child he killed without a shred of remorse, and teaching
his daughter self defence which in foresight would become his undoing.</P>
<P>Sean Archer is mortified by the prospect that he will be forever trapped
behind the face of the man who murdered his son. Looking in the mirror
is all he needs to remind himself of the heinous crime. When given the
opportunity to save Castor Troy's family, he does so because of the
gentleman that he is; and by a morbid twist of fate he finds the son he
lost by killing the man who would be Sean Archer.</P>
<P>Strangely satisfying, poetically just and painfully moving when the
enemy you face carries your own appearance.</P>
