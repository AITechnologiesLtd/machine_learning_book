<PRE>City of Angels (1998)  </PRE>
<P>My wife said it best as we left the theater, It was uneven.</P>
<P>What's charming about the film are its engaging takes on life -- city, 
human, celestial.  When we first look upon the angels Seth (Nicolas 
Cage) and Cassiel (Andre Braugher) sitting atop superhighway signs, we 
know the narrative will be pleasantly slanted and watchable.  Their 
wings and halos replaced by black overcoats, these messengers from God 
patrol streets, construction sites, and especially libraries.  It is in 
the library that Seth and mortal Dr. Maggie Rice (Meg Ryan) meet in two 
emotional scenes, one beginning their relationship and the other 
determining if it will end.</P>
<P>I found the angels' ability to read humans' thoughts not so much 
original as fascinating.  As the camera moves among the cars in a 
traffic jam or among carrels in the library,  we are permitted to 
mind-surf, catching glimpses of what life is like in this very human, 
"naked city."  It is gritty yet beautiful, from the scenes in the 
hospital in which Meg tries to prolong life, to the scenes in which the 
angels – seen only by us and by those they choose – give humans small 
embraces of protection.  John Seale's cinematography paints Los Angeles 
in colors Maxfield Parrish would use:  glowing and clean;  even shots of 
seaminess are uncluttered and objectified.  </P>
<P>The major roles are indeed well-acted.  Cage, his hair meticulously in 
place, even his eyebrows handsomely trimmed, casts his big, 
compassionate eyes upon human suffering.  Unlike most of his fellow 
celestials (who at times look alarmingly remote and agent-like), Seth 
pursues a human.  (Isn't it a breach of the ethics of invisibility to 
watch a woman as she bathes, or kisses her boyfriend?)  On her part, Meg 
Ryan is appropriately tentative in dealing with Seth.  Where another 
might think him an odd preacher or even a stalker, Maggie eventually 
realizes his gentleness, and soon harbors amorous thoughts that Seth 
intercepts.  Her performance is most riveting when she discovers Seth's 
corporeal form is bloodless;  her mix of fear, bafflement and anger 
alerts us to the crux of her emotional predicament.</P>
<P>The minor roles in this picture function like confidants in a good play, 
enabling the leading roles to succeed.  Dennis Franz does a most 
convincing job as Nathaniel Messinger, a gluttonous, life-loving patient 
of Maggie's.  It's not far-fetched that Franz will get a nod as Best 
Supporting Actor nominee.  One of the hard-to-believe sequences has 
Nathaniel leaving the hospital to chow down at a diner (while Seth, who 
has manifested himself to another mortal, eats nothing).  But 
Nathaniel's gusto, along with Maggie's mutual feelings, causes Seth to 
take a fall into the grimy pleasures of humanity.  In his role as 
Cassiel, Andre Braugher (say it ain't so, Andre, that you're leaving 
Homicide!) is underused.  Further, some of his banter with Seth is not 
transparent enough.</P>
<P>Just as Braugher does a masterful job with average lines, Cage admirably 
juggles a handful of clichés.  Are we to believe that Seth, formerly an 
immortal who for ages has observed humans, is not cagey enough to avoid 
hitch-hiking, in the rain, outside a nude-dancing palace, and then 
benevolently greeting a carload of scumbags who mug him?  Would he 
really act so child-like at the strong scent from a bottle of perfume?  
And possibly the most unforgivable piece of writing has Seth making no 
direct communication with his Maker.  It is stated in the film that "No 
one believes in us (angels) anymore";  a big problem is that the movie 
contradicts this claim by further popularizing all things angel.  What 
we wind up with is another New-Agey, secular treatment of religious 
themes.  </P>
<P>Let me end by commending the sequence in which Seth falls to earthiness.  
Director Silberling's black-and-white montage is dramatically brilliant, 
evoking the precious and intimate side of humanity remembered by the 
deceased characters in Our Town.  I also liked that the ending of City 
of Angels would not please followers of Disney.  I only wish the ending 
sustained the emotional power of what comes just before it.  And I'm an 
easier critic than my wife.</P>
