<P>     It's the return of the Grumpy Old Odd Couple.  After taking breaks 
from each other over the holidays, Walter Matthau (who sparred with 
Ossie Davis in I'M NOT RAPPAPORT) and Jack Lemmon (who traded barbs with 
James Garner in MY FELLOW AMERICANS) share screen credit for a tenth 
time in OUT TO SEA.  Unfortunately, this is one of their least 
successful efforts to date.  Instead of allowing the actors to breathe 
some life into their characters, OUT TO SEA's film makers have instead 
decided to let Lemmon and Matthau sail along on reputation alone.  And, 
as affable as their chemistry is, it's not enough to sustain a movie all 
by itself.</P>
<P>     This has been a bad summer for films about cruise ships (and a 
worse summer for audiences forced to endure them).  First, Sandra 
Bullock and Jason Patric got away from it all on the high seas in SPEED 
2.  Now, we have Lemmon and Matthau.  And, while the essential plot 
details are vastly different, the films climax on an eerily similar note 
-- with a motor-powered craft chasing a hydroplane.  Still, OUT TO SEA 
has a lot less in common with SPEED 2 than it does with the old TV 
series, THE LOVE BOAT.  Save for the big-screen format and the different 
crew, this could easily be an elongated episode.  It's just as lame, 
mindless, and saccharine.</P>
<P>     The feeble premise has brothers-in-law and best enemies Herbie 
(Lemmon) and Charlie (Matthau) going on a cruise together.  Herbie 
doesn't really want to go -- he'd rather sit at home and miss his dead 
wife.  Charlie, on the other hand, is in desperate need of money to pay 
off gambling debts, and he believes that the quickest way to amass a 
fortune is to find a lonely, rich woman and marry her.  So he signs 
himself and Herbie up as dance instructors on the ship -- a position 
that earns them free passage.  They also develop fake identities, and, 
pretending to be far more wealthy than they actually are, they start 
wooing women.  Charlie's choice, predictably, is a wealthy Texas blond 
named Liz LaBreche (Dyan Cannon), who is often on the arm of a stuffy 
Englishman (Edward Mulhare).  Herb, however, makes a far less 
ostentatious choice in Vivian (Gloria DeHaven), a widow who reminds him 
of his late wife.  Meanwhile, the ship's cruise director, Gil Godwyn (a 
deliciously over-the-top Brent Spiner), is out to ensnare the two men in 
their own web of deceit.  </P>
<P>     Lemmon and Matthau often seem to be sleepwalking their way through 
this screenplay-by-numbers.  And, considering OUT TO SEA's lack of 
intelligence and ambition, who could blame them?  The veteran actors 
have a few enjoyable scenes together, but, most of the time, OUT TO SEA 
pulls them apart, and there's not enough spark in the Cannon/Matthau and 
Lemmon/DeHaven matches to keep things interesting for long.  The comedy 
is also second-rate, with sit-com jokes, one-liners, and embarrassing 
situations trying vainly to generate laughter.  </P>
<P>     The cast, if nothing else, is diverse.  Quite a number of TV actors 
have parts (reinforcing the LOVE BOAT feel), including Brent Spiner 
(STAR TREK:  THE NEXT GENERATION), Edward Mulhare (KNIGHT RIDER), Rue 
McClanahan (THE GOLDEN GIRLS), and Hal Linden (BARNEY MILLER).  Then 
there's song-and-dance man Donald O'Connor, who stays in the background 
except when called upon to display a few moves.  And, although Dyan 
Cannon is more bubbly and vivacious than in the recent 8 HEADS IN A 
DUFFEL BAG, this is hardly the most promising rung in her comeback 
ladder.  </P>
<P>     The magic between Lemmon and Matthau may finally be wearing thin, 
but I don't think it has completely exhausted itself yet.  What these 
two need, however, is a script that challenges them to do something 
fresh rather than encouraging them to go over already-plowed ground.  
After OUT TO SEA, the last thing I'm in the mood for are THE ODD COUPLE 
2 and GRUMPIEST OLD MEN (both of which are apparently in the works).  
Director Martha Coolidge (RAMBLING ROSE) should have known better than 
to believe that the presence of a pair of familiar, likable comic actors 
could keep this movie from taking on water.  So, if only for the sake of 
Lemmon and Matthau's joint reputation, OUT TO SEA deserves to go down 
fast and without a trace.  </P>
