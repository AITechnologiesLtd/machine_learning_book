<PRE>                            THE SCORE
               (a film review by Mark R. Leeper)</PRE>
<P>    CAPSULE: This is a 1950s or 1960s style heist film, set in the 
    present.  Robert DeNiro stars as a risk-adverse safecracker 
    who wants to retire form crime but takes one last job at the 
    request of a personal friend (played by Marlon Brando).  Edward 
    Norton plays a hotshot young sharpster who is also in on the 
    crime.  The plot is mostly straightforward suspense with little 
    nonsense.  Rating: 7 (0 to 10), +2 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>I am sure I must have seen almost the identical plot before.  This 
is a heist film made for an adult audience who probably wanted a 
crime film like they had seen in theaters when they were teens.  
There are no superhuman acrobats taking nosedives off of buildings 
like in ENTRAPMENT.  There is no rock score.  There are no ballet-
like martial arts.  This is just a basic heist film with a decent 
and distinctly credible and un-flashy script.</P>
<P>Nick (played by Robert DeNiro) is a safecracker who has managed to 
be successful by never taking risks.  If a job is not a safe bet 
(pun intended), he backs out.  Sometimes even the safe bets turn 
out not to be so safe.  When one job very nearly goes wrong Nick 
is unnerved enough to decide that it is Nature telling him that it 
is time to get out of the game.  He returns to his home in 
Montreal where he owns a jazz club, and decides to manage it full 
time.  He proposes to his girl friend Diane (Angela Bassett).  She 
has one condition.  He must stay retired from crime.  But before 
the deal can be cemented, Max, a Montreal kingpin and personal 
friend, has one last supposedly easy job for Nick.  Nick wants no 
part particularly because the heist will be right in his hometown 
of Montreal.  More and more details seem to complicate the job.  
Nick's partner in the crime is to be a smart, but uncontrollable 
young crook, Jack (Edward Norton).  Jack treats a locked front 
door like a welcome mat, even at his associates' homes.  The young 
crook is a know-it-all who seems good at everything he does but at 
avoiding rubbing people the wrong way.  Together they plan to 
steal a priceless historic artifact from the Montreal Customs 
House.</P>
<P>The script by Kario Salem, Lem Dobbs, and Scott Marshall Smith 
works like an episode of the old "Mission Impossible" television 
series.  We see pieces of the heist being put together, last 
minute changes, and things that go wrong, much like a good episode 
of "Mission Impossible."  This team might not be bad choices to 
write scripts for the Tom Cruise "Mission Impossible" films.  The 
complications are, however no more and no fewer than are needed to 
make the story believable.  The telling is cold and noirish, which 
is just what it is supposed to be.  Director Frank Oz, the voices 
of Yoda and Miss Piggy proves surprisingly good at directing a 
serious crime film.</P>
<P>THE SCORE has a more than adequate cast with little flashy or 
scene-stealing acting.  Edward Norton probably has the flashiest 
role and even that is low-key by today's standards.  He plays what 
is nearly a double role.  Jack pretends to be a brain damage 
victim to be hired for a job in the Customs House.  One nice (?) 
character I have not mentioned is Stephen (Jamie Harrold).  
Stephen is a master hacker who lives in his mother's basement in a 
house with a lot of screaming in both directions.  He seems like 
the last person the risk adverse Nick would want to depend upon.</P>
<P>The film itself remains low-key up until the time of the climactic 
heist.  Then the pace really picks up.  Before that the plot even 
stops twice for jazz interludes.  Though Oz never lets the music 
steal time from the story the way Woody Allen does in SWEET AND 
LOWDOWN.  On the subject of music, the score of THE SCORE is by 
Howard Shore.  It adds tension to the suspense scenes, but never 
seems to have much of a melody.</P>
<P>Angela Bassett is the one misused celebrity in a totally minor 
role that should have been played by a less famous actress who 
needed a break.  She has nothing to do in the film but demand that 
Nick give up crime and to look like an attractive reward if he 
does.  Speaking of being attractive THE SCORE seems to be 
attracting an older audience who learned to appreciate much the 
same sort of film in the 1950s and 1960s.  It does the job.  I 
rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.  </P>
