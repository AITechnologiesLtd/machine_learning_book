<P>While staying in the Watergate Hotel in Washington DC, two dim-witted
15 year olds (Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams) inadvertently
expose the Watergate break in.  The next day, after wandering off from
a White House tour, they end up meeting Richard Nixon, becoming
official White House dog walkers and secret youth advisors, and
unknowingly involving themselves in almost every aspect of the
downfall of a President.</P>
<P>Let me first give some credit to writer/director Andrew Fleming.  His
previous two films (Threesome, The Craft) are two of my least favorite
movies ever, and I was quite harsh on Fleming in my reviews.  So going
into this film I was not expecting much at all in terms of
entertainment.  Surprisingly, Dick turns out to be really funny.
There are the obvious double meaning jokes pertaining to the film's
titular character, but not as many as you'd think... three or four at
the most, I believe.  The rest of the film's comedy is fairly
intelligent, and hardly any of it misses it's mark.  Even the drug
humor is good-natured.</P>
<P>Let me now give credit to the cast.  Mostly comprised of "Saturday
Night Live" and "The Kids in the Hall" alumni, everyone is dead on
target.  Dan Hedaya plays Nixon, and he's great without making the
character too much of a cartoon (on a slightly interesting side note,
Hedaya was also in the cast of Oliver Stone's Nixon).  The lead
actresses are good at conveying their character's rampant stupidity
while managing to be quite sexy as well.  Best of all though are Will
Ferrell and Bruce McCulloch as a bickering Woodward and Bernstein (the
Washington Post reporters who broke the Watergate story).  They appear
in the film's opening scene, and then reappear in the film's final act
basically dominating the rest of the film.  These scenes are a highly
amusing parody of those two journalists, especially if you've seen
movies like All the President's Men.</P>
<P>What makes this film work given it's subject matter is it's
presentation.  Of course saying that two teens were directly involved
in the biggest political scandal this nation has even seen is absurd,
but the movie knows this and doesn't try to be anything else BUT
absurd.  The jokes are humorous and manage to succeed to two different
levels.  Those of you who don't know anything about the Watergate
scandal will enjoy it on the comedic level of a silly movie, and those
of you with knowledge of the events will enjoy it as a sly political
satire.  For example, knowing that there was an 18 and a half minute
gap in one of Nixon's secret recordings will help you to enjoy a
certain scene even more, but the scene is also funny standing alone.</P>
<P>Of course you know Fleming must be delighted at the use of the film's
title in the vocabulary of moviegoers around the country.  I now have
to refer to the film as "that comedy about Nixon with the two girls in
it" to avoid making the buffoonish statements I've been making like
"Call the theater and confirm three for Dick, please".  John Waters
tried to do this with last year's Pecker... but since no one sees John
Waters' movies or even talks about them, it failed.  [PG-13]</P>
