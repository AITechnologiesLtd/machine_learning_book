<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>There are some nice ideas in "Pay It Forward". One of them is the central
premise itself -- that one person does "three big favours for three other
people", and then those people do three more favours for three more
people, and on and on. Better still, these have to be favours that the
other people "can't do for themselves" -- certainly not a minor 
proposition!</P>
<P>Admittedly, it's not a terribly realistic concept. I think that in real
life, far too many people would take advantage of the first part without
doing the second (or is that just my own cynicism peeking through?). But
in a cinematic context, there is nothing wrong with this per se, and
indeed the "pay it forward" philosophy has all the makings of a juicy
movie premise.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the Mimi Leder picture just does not have enough faith in
its central idea. Instead of taking the ball and running with it, "pay it
forward" is used as a clothesline on which to hang a number of far less
rivetting, less original subplots. Despite its title, this is not a movie
about a philanthropic way of life, but instead concerns itself mostly the
broken people who become involved in that lifestyle.</P>
<P>And make no mistake, "Pay It Forward" is a film almost entirely populated
with broken people -- those suffering from abuse, alcoholism, drug
addictions, or simply neglect. Some have suggested the movie is
"Capra-esque", but it is Capra viewed through distinctly 21st-century
misanthropy. Those expecting a latter-day "It's A Wonderful Life" are
likely to be disappointed.</P>
<P>Middle schooler Trevor McKinney (Haley Joel Osment) is a latchkey kid
whose alcoholic father is long gone. Mother Arlene (Helen Hunt) works two
jobs and is so close to falling off the wagon that she must be scraping
pavement. Trevor's new social studies teacher is Eugene Simonet (Kevin
Spacey), a man who is himself scarred both physically and emotionally. But
Eugene is a good teacher, and on the first day of school, he challenges
his class to come up with "an idea that will change the world -- and put
it into action".</P>
<P>So quickly that you'd swear he must have been expecting the question,
Trevor devises the "pay it forward" philosophy. His first act is to let a
homeless man (James Caviezel) live in his garage. Then he tries to hook up
Arlene and Eugene, neither of whom have been able to cultivate a
functional love life. And for his third "big favour", he goes to the aid
of a classmate perpetually troubled by bullies.</P>
<P>None of these work out quite like Trevor had hoped. And yet, the script by
Leslie Dixon assures us that something good will come of it, because we
are privy to glimpses of four months in the future, when a reporter (Jay
Mohr) becomes part of "pay it forward" and begins backtracking through the
chain to find its originator.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, each of Trevor's "favours" are used not so much to propel
the "pay it forward" story forward, but rather as springboards, to a
greater or lesser extent, for subplots of inferior dramatic value. It is
these which dominate the movie. The most significant is the relationship
between Arlene and Eugene. Disappointingly, especially given two such
unusual characters and two such talented actors, this is nothing more than
a standard romantic storyline. It goes through so many timeworn stages of
misunderstanding, revelation, complication, separation, and reconciliation
that it could have been lifted directly from a screenwriter's how-to book.</P>
<P>If nothing else, these sequences do at least boast the acting skills of
Hunt and Spacey, who are in their usual fine form. That Hunt is able to
portray Arlene as such a complex, troubled individual without engendering
feelings of pity (or, for that matter, disgust) is somewhat remarkable.
Hunt doesn't forget that, while Arlene is burdened by a tremendous number
of issues, there is more to the character than just those issues. This is
best illustrated in a terrific scene with Angie Dickinson (playing a bag
lady), one of "Pay It Forward"'s few genuinely touching moments. </P>
<P>Spacey, meanwhile, does an excellent job of alluding to the hidden depths
in Eugene's psyche without overplaying it. Consider the sequence in which
Eugene finally reveals the root of his problems. As scripted, it is
typical melodramatic fare, but Spacey never loses his center and plays the
scene sincerely, without caving into the overt sentimentality of the
moment, giving it some measure of credibility. Spacey also enjoys an
excellent on-screen rapport with Osment, who continues to demonstrate that
he is one of those rare child stars who actually knows how to act, rather
than just mug for the camera.</P>
<P>The other subplots are not so blessed, unfortunately. The chronicle of
Caviezel's hobo comes across as particularly disjointed, as the script
drops in on it only at emotional highpoints (or lowpoints, as the case may
be). It feels like we're just seeing the trailer for a more detailed
storyline.</P>
<P>The school bully arc, meanwhile, is plainly included only to provide "Pay
It Forward" with a convenient conclusion. This would not be so bad if that
ending were more meaningful, but as it stands, it constitutes nothing more
than indisputable viewer manipulation on the part of the screenwriters. I
will not divulge any details, except to say that rarely have I watched a
scene so clearly intended merely to provoke an obvious response from the
audience, without any thought given to how this might impact on the 
movie's overall theme.</P>
<P>As a result, "Pay It Forward" comes across as something of an oddity -- a
movie which not only shunts its own premise into the background for long
stretches of time, but indeed provides its own evidence to discredit that
premise. A few good performances do not come close enough to saving this
poorly-conceived film. "Pay It Forward" has the makings of something good,
but in the end it is much like the characters which inhabit it: broken.</P>
