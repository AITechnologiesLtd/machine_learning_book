<P>   Some of this year's teen films concentrate on outsiders--the
nerds, the geeks, the ostracized: "Election," "Jawbreakers,"
"Never Been Kissed," for example.  Imagine if you will people
who are so outside regular society that the only night of the
year that they feel normal is Halloween!  Two such folks are
the focus of the Polish brothers' quirky and decidedly offbeat
"Twin Falls Idaho," a love story with such originality that it fits
into a niche all its own.  "Twin Falls Idaho" is about romantic
love of sorts, yes, and also about fraternal and maternal
affection with all the dependency feelings such devotion
generates.  But the principal attachment is that formed
between Siamese twins, Francis Falls (Michael Polish) and
his brother Blake (Mark Polish), whose separation from birth
was either not possible because of the limited medical
technology at the time and because even if they could have
been split, not only would one die but the survivor would have
to make do with one leg, one arm, and perhaps one lung. 
Because this film is an archetype displaying sensitive,
credible performances, "Twin Falls Idaho" ranks as a must-
see for a specialized audience.  Its glacial pace and lack of
turbulent physical action limits the work commercially keeping
it suitable for the right crowd (such as the Sundance
audience that screened the Polish Brothers' drama in
January).</P>
<P>   Inspired by an actual case of the famous Siamese twins of
the Nineteenth Century, Chang and Eng Bunker, the 27-year-
old Polish brothers went to work on their idiosyncratic script,
with Mark Polish at the helm and in the role of the stronger of
the Siamese pair, Blake Falls, with Michael taking the guise
of the sickly sibling, Francis.  We get the impression that
despite their being joined side-by-side over the length of the
torso, sharing just two legs and two arms between them, they
valued their bond and could not envisage the trauma of being
separated.  Yet because Francis is unhealthy (his heartbeat
is weak and he is given to bouts of nausea and fatigue), he is
the one who is dependent on his brother's strength.  He
realizes that his brother could survive a surgical procedure
that could split them apart.  Apparently Blake does not even
begin to entertain such thoughts except at one dramatically
emotional point in the story--particularly strong because of the
low-key action keel that precedes the scene.</P>
<P>   The story opens on two hookers, Sissy (Teresa Hill) and
her friend Penny (Michele Hicks), the latter in a bad way
financially and in such need of funds that she accepts an
assignment to a seedy hotel on Idaho Street of an unnamed
town.  Horrified at first by noting that her customer is well
connected, she gradually forms a bond with Blake, the
stronger one, causing Blake's brother to become predictably
jealous.  </P>
<P>   The film is best when Francis, Blake and Penny are
interacting, becoming at times annoying when other
characters almost arbitrarily come upon the scene.  In one
Fellini-esque episode, a spiritual man named Jesus (Garrett
Morris) takes an interest in the pair, figuring that they
epitomize family values: they can never be divorced.  A
seedy entertainment lawyer, Jay (Jon Gries), tries to exploit
the two, coming on strong about how they can write their own
soap opera (deciding, for example, to get a divorce from each
other) to make big bucks from a public whose voracious
demand for freaky-relationship shows is insatiable.  Miles
(Patrick Bauchau), a sympathetic doctor, comes off best of
the supporting players as a man with a sincere interest in the
well-being of the brothers and of his friend, Penny--who is
inexplicably lonely and penniless.</P>
<P>   The story's moral is straightforward.  As Dr. Miles relates, a
two-dollar bill is now worth double its face value.  Torn in
half, however, the bill would be worthless.  The Polish
brothers turn in an enchanting performance as they simulate
Siamese twins without the use of special effects.  We never
wonder that in real life they are sibs who are so close to each
other that they finish each other's sentences, though in the
film they have an annoying habit of whispering to each other
when they have company--a rude habit at best.  Michele
Hicks does quite well in her debut role as a trampy-looking
but attractive hooker with a golden heart, though Lesley Ann
Warren as the brothers' reluctant mom is the only performer
who will be familiar to the average moviegoer.  Warren's role
is the least credible: that of the mother of the Siamese twins
who turned them out for adoption at birth but who is turned
around when the men are 27.  An eerie and entirely effective
soundtrack by Stuart Matthewman insures the movie's
position as an intensely atmospheric work while Warren Alan
Young's production design effective makes Penny's quarters
look synthetically royal while the twins pine away in a sickly
green hotel room reminiscent of the Coen Brothers' design in
"Barton Fink."  The movie about the twin Falls brothers takes
place on Idaho Street, but can occur anywhere, though you're
not likely to see such people in real life.  Siamese twins are
born only once in 50,000 to 80,000 twin births and often die a
few years after their entry into the world.</P>
