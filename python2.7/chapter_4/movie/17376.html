<PRE>EVEREST (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Edited by Steve Kong
Copyright 1999 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>Ever since I finished reading the book "Into Thin Air", I've wanted to see
the IMAX film Everest. In the latter parts of "Into Thin Air" the IMAX team
is talked about at length – the IMAX team was one of the factors in helping
to save many lives in the tragic and ill-fated ascent to the top of Everest.</P>
<P>Somehow I ended up waiting almost three months before seeing Everest – I'm
sad that I didn't see this film earlier! For those of you who are not
familiar with IMAX films, I'll give a brief description of an IMAX film.
When you see a movie, it is usually printed on 35mm film, which is measure
diagonally from the top left to the bottom right of a single frame. If
you're special, you'll have a 70mm capable theatre around you that can play
films printed on 70mm film – resulting in four times the resolution on the
film. IMAX film is about twice the size of 70mm – quadrupling the
resolution of the image of a 70mm film. So, as you can imagine, the image
on an IMAX film is about as perfect as can be because it has 16 times as
much resolution of the standard films you see.</P>
<P>All this higher resolution stuff doesn't matter if your screen is the size
of your home TV though. So, IMAX theatres are equipped with tremendous
sized screens. For me there are two IMAX screens near me. One at an
amusement park, Great America, and the other is at The Tech Museum in
downtown San Jose. The Great America theatre is mediocre at best, wowing
the audience with a large screen and some decent sound. But the theatre is
old and not well kept. Everest was not showing at the Great America
theatre, but luckily it was showing at The Tech. Everest was the first film
I've ever seen at the Hackworth IMAX Dome Theatre and I am more than
impressed – the theatre left me with my jaw on the floor. This theatre is
built to impress and it is evident from the beginning with its introduction.</P>
<P>But, back to the film. Everest is a documentary and it is a well-written
documentary following a team of people lead by David Breashears. Also on
the team are Ed Viesturs, who not only summitted twice, but did it both
without extra oxygen; Ed's new wife, Paula; Jamling Tenzing Norgay (son of
the guide to the first person to ever summit Everest); and Araceli Segarra
an experience climber from Spain.</P>
<P>The film Everest and director Breashears take advantages of IMAX to the
max. Because an IMAX film is projected onto a screen so large that it
stretches from one end of your field of vision to the other there are a lot
of things that a smart director can do with the film. Breashears amazes us
with helicopter flights, climbing shots with the camera mounted looking
down, crossings of ice glacier canyons with the camera pointed into the
dark endless hole below, and many other things that would and can make a
viewer sick to the stomach but also amaze them to the point of verbal
"oohs" and "ahs".</P>
<P>If you haven't ever seen an IMAX film, or if you've seen one of the more
mediocre ones, Don't Miss Everest at your local IMAX theatre. This film is
a treat for the senses.</P>
