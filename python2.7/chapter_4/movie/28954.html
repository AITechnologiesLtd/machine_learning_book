<PRE>MADE
A film review by Christopher Null
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Practically heckled out of the ring at their boxing match, best friends
Bobby and Ricky (Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn) are hardly your titans of
the fights.  In fact, they aren't much in the way of titans of
anything.  They're almost losers.  Whenever Bobby gets ahead, Ricky's
antics pull him back down -- never on purpose, he just doesn't know how
to behave any better.</P>
<P>When Bobby gets kicked off his L.A. construction job, he pleads with
minor crime boss Max (Peter Falk) to give him something better to do
than smooth concrete and fistfight his buddies.  And so the hijinks
begin... as Bobby and Ricky head for New York in an unspecified role as
heavies for some deal of Max's.</P>
<P>A fiercely independent production courtesy of aspiring auteur Jon
Favreau, Made is a vague follow-up to Swingers, the acclaimed comedy
written and starring Favreau and fellow Made man Vaughn.  In fact, Made
reunites several Favreau friends, including his Love & Sex costar Famke
Janssen, as his stripper girlfriend.  Never mind the celeb status: It's
a miracle that Sean "Puffy" Combs got a role here, considering he didn't
know Favreau beforehand.</P>
<P>Out of the picture is director Doug Liman (who did Swingers and Go),
which is something of a loss.  Favreau is better in front of the lens
and behind a typewriter instead of wielding the camera.  He runs around
with a nauseating handheld half the time, framing shots badly and
jerking the rig about as he searches for the right shot.</P>
<P>Favreau's script, however, is predictably great, full of droll wit and
zingers that reduce costar Vaughn from the hip daddy-o in Swingers to a
mentally defective scalawag.  His brash character is loathsome, but Made
is completely Vaughn's movie.  Ricky is that obnoxious and unfortunate
friend you got stuck with growing up, the kind of guy who screwed up
everything... and somehow talked you into going along with it.  Whether
he's insisting they buy guns for their upcoming "drop" or repeatedly
ringing his flight attendant button (in a scene that recalls Favreau's
answering machine travails in Swingers), he simply gets on your every
nerve.  And it's unilaterally hysterical.</P>
<P>On the other hand, a misplaced supporting character can severely mess up
a movie, and Combs (here in his first real film role) is the poster
child for exactly that.  "Puffy" is not only a joke of an actor, he's a
joke -- period.  Casting him as some kind of New York drug kingpin is
ridiculous, and while his appearance here is obviously tongue-in-cheek,
it's still a nuisance to have to watch him "act."</P>
<P>Never mind that, though -- he only has 10 minutes of screen time. 
Anyone enamored with the unique and hip sensibility of Swingers will
find Made almost as much fun.  It's not a sequel, mind you, and it's
lacking the nuanced and compelling supporting characters that made
Swingers so memorable, but for grown-up comedy, you won't find better
this summer.</P>
