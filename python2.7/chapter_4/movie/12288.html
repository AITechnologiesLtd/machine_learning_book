<PRE>Tarzan and the Lost City (PG) no stars</PRE>
<P>One review of 1994's Sylvester Stallone-Sharon Stone actioner The
Specialist called that superstar team-up "the acting equivalent of the
Hindenburg meeting the Titanic."  If that's the case, then the pairing of
hack-tors Casper Van Dien (Teen Beat-ready block of meat from Starship
Troopers) and Jane March (last seen delivering what should have been a
career-ending performance as three characters in the atrocious Color of
Night) is the acting equivalent of armageddon meeting the end of the
universe.  In this horribly conceived and executed update of Edgar Rice
Burroughs's classic character, the King of the Jungle (Van Dien) returns to
his African homeland to prevent some treasure hunters from finding the
sacred lost city of Opar; following him to the jungle is his loyal fiancee
Jane (March, thankfully keeping her clothes on for a change).</P>
<P>Tarzan and the Lost City, directed by Carl Schenkel, is the latest in
what's becoming a most unwelcome annual cinematic tradition--the horrid
jungle adventure (the most recent entrants being last year's Anaconda and
1995's unspeakable Congo).  There are lousy, sub-Lost in Space effects;
cheap gorilla suits; flat-out atrocious performances (Van Dien's
barely-there, why-the-hell-even-bother attempt at a British accent makes
Kevin Costner look like Meryl Streep); and, worst of all, a lack of genuine
thrills.  Tarzan swings on vines and everything else, but there's nothing
exciting about anything, certainly not the boring, anti-climactic "climax"
in a pyramid.  The audience of ten with whom I saw the film got the most
amusement from Van Dien's hilariously delivered animal noises and sloppily
dubbed Tarzan call.  If this is truly, as the Warner Bros. publicity
machine stated, "A new Tarzan for a new generation," then everyone falling
into the Generation X category should be incredibly offended.  I know I am.</P>

<P>"I didn't know what to expect. It's like something you chase
 for so long, but then you don't know how to react when you
 get it.  I still don't know how to react."
