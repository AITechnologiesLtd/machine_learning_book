<P>There's something wonderful about childhood which allows us to believe
we are capable of anything. The future shines brightly ahead like the
rising sun in the distant horizon. Life's bitter lessons haven't taught
us to believe otherwise, as we stand invincible on the promising steps
of hopes and dreams. When I was young I believed that I could fly to the
moon and back in my space craft composed of broken down radio and hi-fi
set; that it was indeed the Millenium Falcon, and I was Han Solo
journeying to rescue Princess Leia. I won't tell you what I used for a
substitute light sabre, but that's my private childhood fantasy. For
Harriet M. Welsch it was to become the world's greatest spy. Whatever
she saw, whatever she heard, she wrote down in her very 'private'
notebook. For she aspired to be a great writer, and one has to start
somewhere in life, why not earlier.</P>
<P>So our tale of childhood dreams begins, with a girl sheltered beneath
the loving wings of her nanny Ms Golly (Rosie O'Donnell). Harriet has
been neglectfully ignored by her busy parents, leaving her to seek
thrilling sessions of spying and writing. Wherever she goes she carries
her book, and within it writes the most painful truths about her dearest
friends Sport and Janie, her greatest enemy Marion the class president,
and much, much more. Through a shift of unfortunate circumstance Ms
Golly is called to leave, forcing the young Harriet to spread her tender
wings. With much anticipation and under preparation, the spy is faced
with her first taste of cruelty that lost innocence brings. When Marion
exposes her most private thoughts from that most secret book, Harriet
becomes the object of much despise and ridicule. The once great spy is
flung into lonely solitude of careless abandon.</P>
<P>So for the first time in her young life, Harriet of the sixth grade
faces self doubt and wavering uncertainty. The child who once showed
unwavering confidence, now lies marred and wounded, confused and
vulnerable. With Ms Golly gone, her parents a distant relation, and
excommunicated by her closest friends, Harriet stands alone. Arising
from this adversity, angry and vengeful at first, the spy who would be,
learns to resolve her differences peacefully - to forgive those who have
hurt her most, her parents and best friends. Thus, Harriet the Spy has
learnt her first and most painful lesson in life, what it must be like
to be human.</P>
