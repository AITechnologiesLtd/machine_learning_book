<PRE>Ghost in the Cel - Ghost in the Shell Review
Director: Mamoru Oshii
Reviewed by: Foong Ngai Hoe (Yukino Yoshi)
================================</PRE>
<P> When Ghost in the Shell (GitS) was released in 1995, it was probably
one of the most eagerly-awaited full-length anime (Japanese animation)
films since Katsuhiro Otomo's 1988 cyberpunk hit, Akira. Jointly
financed by Manga Video, Kodansha, and Bandai Visuals, GitS became the
first anime project to receive financial support outside Japan, and was
subsequently launched simultaneously on both sides of the Pacific - in
Japanese and English. Based on Shirow Masamune's manga (comics) series,
the film was directed by Mamoru Oshii, one of Japan's top anime
directors.</P>
<P>Major Motoko Kusanagi is an elite officer in the Section 9 security
force, and along with fellow-cyborg Bateau and the mostly human Togusa,
she is ordered to track down an illusive computer-criminal known only as
the Puppet Master, a hacker who can hack into the minds of cyborgs. But
the conspiracy unravels after Kusangi realises that the Puppet Master is
in fact a renegade program belonging to one of the ministries which
claims it's born "in a sea of information". As the ministries try to
out-maneuver each other in a political game to retrieve the Puppet
Master, the latter now turns its attention to Kusanagi. When the Major
begins to question her own existence as a cyborg, the Puppet Master
offers her a merger which will bring about a new life. This is where the
story derives its name from - the 'ghost' being the soul a cyborg feels
inside his or her shell (body).</P>
<P>Masamune's GitS is part political thriller, part social satire that
access society in the digital age. Those familiar with his comics are
quick to acknowledge the footnotes he attaches to his stories - some of
them taking up chapters even. GitS is a difficult manga to read, made
easier only by Masamune's brand of black humour.</P>
<P>GitS the movie isn't so much an Oshii's adaptation of Masamune's comics,
but rather the director's own vision of it. Like in his Patlabor movies,
Oshii brings to GitS a shade of noir that's become his trademark - tight
camera angles, heavy shadow outlines, depressing colours, and a story
that plods ponderously along.</P>
<P>Which is precisely the problem, depending on whether you like Oshii's
style of direction or not. Too much of GitS involves either Kusanagi
soul-searching, or long spells of dialogue off-screen while audiences
are left staring at the backdrop. To be fair, Oshii's unique directional
style does give many of the scenes a kind of poetry, but a
less-appreciative audience might end up squirming uncomfortably in their
seats. However, when the action does take place, it's often intense and
gripping in ways many Hollywood action films aren't. Blood splatters
across the screen, heads get blown off, but the violence is so well
integrated into the action they don't seem too gratuitous.</P>
<P>The immense detail in the animation is breathtaking (even by today's
standards) - from the dark and moody backdrops of Hong Kong in the 21st
century, to the gunfights that punctuate the film. Kenji Kawaii's
etheral score also lends to GitS the meditative feel the story needs.</P>
<P>In short, GitS is a technically brilliant and stylish animation, with a
thought-provoking story you'd not find in western animation.
Unfortunately, it's also a film too entrenched in its genre for its own
good - with a plot so murky you might need a second viewing to fully
understand it.</P>
<P>I'm not saying GitS is a poor production - on the contrary, it's a
marvellous aural and visual treat. Yet as art often does, GitS will win
many admirers but not converts. Neither is it likely to convince the
west that Japanese animation's a lot more than robots, babes, and sex.
And when you consider the amount of money poured into making this film a
blockbuster, that's self-indulgence.</P>
<P>All said, GitS is still worth the watch if you've always wondered how
Terminator 2 or Johnny Mnemonic might have turned out if animated.
Without any doubt this a great work of art - it's how entertaining it is
as a film that's open to debate.</P>
