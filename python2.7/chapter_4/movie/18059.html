<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
1 and a half stars</P>
<P>Off the beat, I'd say that Chow Yun Fat is a terrific actor.  A John Woo
veteran and an Asian action spectacle, Yun Fat effortlessly conveyed
brilliance in Woo's The Killer and Hard Boiled.   His Hollywood debut,
however, is another story.  What led him to choose two very messy
scripts - 1997's The Replacement Killers and this one - to begin his
American career is a mystery to me.  It's not that The Corruptor doesn't
show of its lead performer, it's just that its lead performer can't show
off his film. After the first ten minutes or so of The Corruptor, we get
a glimpse of what it could have been - but upon its completion, it's
clear that this film is a case of misused opportunities.  There are a
couple of well-choreographed action scenes and some unexpected twists in
the plot, but severely hindering this B&B (blood and bullets) soaked
caper is its scripting.  Jumbled and unnecessarily complex, the
screenplay never builds intrigue and seldom shows signs of getting
there.</P>
<P>Danny Wallace (Mark Wahlberg) is a new police officer in the Chinatown
Asian Gang Unit.  A turf war has erupted between two powerful gangs, and
corruption and double-crossing has filtered through the police force.
Star detective Nick Chen (Chow Yun-Fat) reluctantly partners with
Wallace, informing him that white cops are usually killed within days.
Whilst Chen battles to keep the peace in Chinatown, Wallace has
different intentions, and is reluctant to adhere to the tough
regulations of an almost foreign police force.</P>
<P>Perhaps dooming The Corruptor from the start is its two protagonists -
they are cliché and rather dull characters. Chow Yun-Fat has the ability
to play both the good guy and the bad guy with a flick of his eyebrows,
but here he doesn't get the chance to dazzle audiences or develop his
character emotionally. Nick Chen is a hard-hitting, dedicated cop - we
know that - but the film tries to make him more than that.  The
characterization of a violent but lovable man was done to perfection in
1998's Japanese film Hana-Bi, but here viewers are distanced from the
film's most important character.  Yun Fat is never a bad performer, but
bad films bring him down.  Mark Wahlberg plays a nerd cop (his role
bears similarities to Guy Pearce's in L.A Confidential) unconvincingly
and sheepishly.</P>
<P>There are few redeeming qualities in The Corruptor, a film that
disappoints on more than one level.  Poor scripting makes this film come
in a long second best to the likes of Payback and Lock, Stock and Two
Smoking Barrels, and that's disappointing since The Corruptor had more
potential than both of them.  Like looking at a blank page in an
otherwise fascinating book, this film doesn't match the high standards
of either Hong Kong or Hollywood films - in fact, it arrives well below
par on both accounts.</P>
