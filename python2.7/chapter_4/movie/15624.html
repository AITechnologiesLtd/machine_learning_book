_Jack_Frost_ (PG) ** 1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>This family fantasy can best be described as a cross between
_Frosty_the_Snowman_ and _Ghost_, with a bit of _Wide_Awake_ thrown in.
The young star of _Wide_Awake_, Joseph Cross, appears to have the "family
film about death" market cornered with this film, in which he plays
Charlie, a young boy learning to cope with the year-ago death of his loving
but neglectful blues musician father (Michael Keaton, who does his own
singing) named Jack Frost.  That name is a bit too apropos, for when
Charlie wishes for his father to come back, he does--in the form of a snowman.</P>
<P>Thus sets the stage for kid-snowman bonding antics that will certainly
delight the kids.  Adults will be delighted by the snowman effects, which
seamlessly mixes computer animation and puppetry.  (Some clumsy compositing
on certain matte shots are easy to forgive.)  However, the novelty of the
snowman effects wears thin after a while, and the older ones in the
audience may find their attention wavering; mine was.  Nonetheless, the
able cast (which also includes Mark Addy and Kelly Preston) keeps the
affair interesting, and the requisite emotional conclusion plucks the
heartstrings with an admirable--and most welcome--dose of restraint.</P>
