<P>What happens when you put Martin Lawrence in a fat suit in real life? 
You get Martin Lawrence in a coma (the comedian thought he was getting
fat, so he put on numerous layers of heavy clothing and went jogging in
100 degree heat, ending up in a coma).  So what happens when you put
Martin Lawrence in a fat suit in the movies?  You get an audience in a
coma. </P>
<P>In Big Momma's House, Lawrence plays a FBI agent who's a master of
disguises.  When a naughty, naughty man escapes from jail and seeks out
his former girlfriend (the very sexy Nia Long... the only thing worth
looking at in this movie), she flees to Georgia to stay with her rather
large Southern aunt "Big Momma" (Ella Mitchell).  The FBI follows her in
order to recover the large sum of money stolen in the bank robbery that
sent the naughty man to jail.  However, Big Momma is called away on an
emergency.  Sensing that they could lose their only chance to capture
the criminal, Lawrence goes undercover as Big Momma.  And let the comedy
begin! </P>
<P>Big Momma's House is the definition of a "gimmick" movie if there ever
was one.  The plot can basically be summed up as "Martin Lawrence
dresses up as a fat woman"... and even that description is too wordy. 
You can just see this script plotted out on a chalkboard with MARTIN
LAWRENCE/FAT WOMAN in the middle of the board with a big circle around
it, and all sorts of clichéd, "humorous" situations pointing to it.  Fat
woman plays basketball!  Fat woman takes a dump!  Fat woman kung fu! 
Well they left one off the board... movie critic slips into coma! </P>
<P>Paul Giamatti (Private Parts, The Negotiator) plays Lawrence's partner
and as much as I enjoy his work, even he can't inject life into this
lifeless comedy.  Hell, the greatest performers on the planet couldn't
make this material work... it's just that awful. </P>
