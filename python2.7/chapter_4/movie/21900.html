<P>   Many people complain that movies are increasingly
divorced from real life.  Surely popcorn flicks like "End of
Days," "Stigmata," "The World is Not Enough," and "Toy
Story 2" do not reflect what goes on your daily life or mine.
Still, horror and action-adventure stories are popular largely
because they take us out of ourselves into new worlds made
all the more convincing and stirring as technical effects keep
improving.  By contrast, folks who prefer more down-to-earth
stories may appreciate the indies, the small productions
released without the hope of earning megabucks but which
provide cultural fulfillment for those wanting a more
sensible look into the nurture provided by human
relationships of recognizable people rather than the nature of
Satan, anarchists, and evil spirits.</P>
<P>   The danger faced by filmmakers who eschew the occult,
the outlandish and the incredible is that they may turn to the
other extreme--by providing us with down-home stories easily
replicated on the smaller screens of home television.  Such is
the difficulty with "Tumbleweeds," a movie which garnered
accolades from independent circuits through which it has
traveled because of its lifelike portrayal of a mother-daughter
alliance.  Despite good acting by the two principals--"a
towering performance" if you believe Box Office magazine--
played by Janet McTeer and Kimberly Brown, the story is so
humdrum and the mother unlikable in her self-
destructiveness that I found myself squirming in the plush
seat of a top-notch movie house.</P>
<P>   Like the similar "Anywhere But Here," which is superior
because of a tighter script and more expensive production
values, "Tumbleweeds" focuses on a 12-year-old girl who is
more mature and more stability-seeking than her puerile
parent. Mary Jo Walker (Janet McTeer), so damaging to
herself that she has been through four tempestuous
marriages and keeps begging for more punishment, has just
run out on number four after a close encounter with a raised
fist.  Traveling west with all the permanence of the thistled
plant for which Angela Shelton's story is named, Mary Jo and
her 12-year-old girl Ava (Kimberly Brown) run into a truck
driver, Jack (played by the director, Gavin O'Connor) and
soon set up housekeeping in his home near San Diego--a
location much favored by beach-loving Ava, who finds true
joy playing Romeo in the school play and getting a boy friend
of her own.  Ava's dream is about to be shattered as the
unstable Mary Jo tells off her new boss, Mr. Cummings
(Michael J. Pollard) and her relationship with Jack
deteriorates in much the way her previous connections had
done.  Ready once again to run away--this time to
Arizona--she is stopped in her tracks by her headstrong
daughter, who forces her mom to stand still and perhaps
develop a connection with an educated man, Dan Miller (Jay
O. Sanders).</P>
<P>   I'll go along with online critic James Berardinelli, who
reports that director Gavin pays "careful attention to character
development and relationship building," but would not agree
that these directorial efforts will inevitably make us feel a
sympathy for both characters.  While Mary Jo and Ava do
share a solid, affectionate bond, observing Mary Jo wiggle
her butt at the men she meets, opening her eyes to simulate
expressiveness, and imitating adolescents in her joyful
war-whoops becomes tiresome after a half hour or so.  </P>
<P>   Like Ann and Adele who, in Wayne Wang's "Anywhere But
Here," mom and daughter are terrified of losing each other,
though Ava appears willing to risk all to stop the immature
adult from pulling up roots yet again.  But while those overly
enamored of character development may find great appeal in
"Tumbleweeds," the story is too loose and rambling to hold
the interest of those who agree with Plato who, in the classic
study of theater called "Poetics" holds (more or less) that
plot--not character development--is the soul of a good story.</P>
