<P>Shameful pasts. Secret affairs. Astonishing revelations. Political
intrigue. No, "An Ideal Husband" isn't a depiction of recent turmoil in
our nation's capital - though the title would take on an ironic new
meaning were that the case. Instead, it's a handsome adaptation of the
beloved Oscar Wilde play, and the story, with all of its aforementioned
scandalous components, couldn't render it timelier. Or funnier: Wilde's
penchant for epigrams and one-liners remains despite some necessary
cinematic tinkering on the part of director/writer Oliver Parker.</P>
<P>Parker, who helmed the fiery Laurence Fishburne "Othello" a few years
back, takes liberties here just like he did there. His "Othello" lopped
off about half of the source text and modified the rest in favor of mass
audience appeal, but Wilde purists will be happy to know that no such
sacrilegious bombshells are dropped with "Husband." The biggest changes
involve expanding beyond the original's mere four scenes in terms of
action and setting, modifications which serve its cinematic status while
staying faithful to the genius of Wilde. A series of potentially stuffy
high-society gatherings, both public and personal, are now broken up
with sequences in lush countrysides and conservatories.</P>
<P>Complain about this restructuring if you must, but please speak fondly
of the cast. "An Ideal Husband" lays claim to an A-list of performers in
its featured quintet of roles, and each has delicious things to do and
say - especially Rupert Everett. Somehow snubbed by the Academy for his
savory supporting turn in 1997's "My Best Friend's Wedding," Everett
could see Oscar rebound for his delightfully droll turn as Sir Arthur
Goring, an idle bachelor with little on his to-do list and even less to
say. "I love talking about nothing," he deadpans on the subject of
upper-crust chit-chat in a typically wry bit of Wilde wit. "It's the
only thing I know anything about."</P>
<P>Well, there'll be plenty to discuss soon enough. Devilish debutante Miss
Cheveley (Julianne Moore), Goring's ex-fiancee, surfaces in his
late-1800s London province to discuss marriage while secretly
blackmailing Sir Robert Chiltern (class act Jeremy Northam, making his
dilemma palpable), Goring's best friend and an up-and-coming figure in
parliament, with a skeleton long buried in his closet. Chiltern's loyal
wife (Cate Blanchett) and siren sister (Minnie Driver, never better)
also poke their way into this tremendously tangled character-woven web;
the former finds herself at a crossroads after learning her hubby's
secret, the latter rivals Miss Cheveley for Goring's affections.</P>
<P>"An Ideal Husband" probably sounds more complex than it is. Though
classics aren't usually associated with accessibility, Parker, taking a
cue from his "Othello" work, keeps his multi-layered people and plots
remarkably straight - even when motivation gets a little murky and
certain strands don't quite hit the highs of others. But since this is
mostly an actors' movie, those flaws seem more minute than they already
are. Aside from Everett's show-stealing, there's Aussie Blanchett again
proving chameleonic range after her robust ruler in "Elizabeth" and
Joisey gal in "Pushing Tin" and American Moore flaunting a Gwyneth-class
Brit accent, her devilish mouth curling around every suggestive word.</P>
<P>With Jane Austen's library-to-screen craze gone but not forgotten and
the Bard nearing the end of his "Shakespeare in Love"-induced hot
streak, "Husband"'s sparkling, irresistible and gentle comedy of manners
could be just the art-house draw to give Wilde his due in the mainstream
spotlight. It's not likely that this forecast will need much luck: In a
summer full of lightsabers, mojo and glossy star vehicles, the film
already ranks as a smallish but rewarding breath of fresh air. Throw in
special effects that are 100 percent human, and "An Ideal Husband" makes
for a movie bet that's beyond ideal.<HR></P>

"Here it is at last, the first 150-minute trailer. 'Armageddon' is cut
together like its own highlights. Take almost any 30 seconds at random,
and you'd have a TV ad. The movie is an assault on the eyes, the ears,
the brain, common sense and the human desire to be entertained. No
matter what they're charging to get in, it's worth more to get out."
-Roger Ebert on "Armageddon"</P>
