<P>     The time is the late 1960s.  The place is Great Britain.  If this 
setting somehow doesn't seem quite real, it's because we're seeing it 
through the eyes of Graham Young, a teenage boy who wants to become 
history's most accomplished poisoner.  As defined by the courts, Graham 
is an incurable psychopath, and, as portrayed in Benjamin Ross' 
deliciously malicious debut feature, he hasn't got a heart.  Thus, our 
perspective of events, which is filtered through Graham's point-of-view, 
is cold, clinical, and, occasionally, downright disturbing.</P>
<P>     Based on a real-life case, THE YOUNG POISONER'S HANDBOOK is the 
blackest of black comedies.  None of the humor is of the laugh-aloud 
variety, but the script drips with acidic irony, and there are moments 
of clever, quirky comedy that are easily appreciated on an intellectual 
level.  THE YOUNG POISONER'S HANDBOOK rarely engages the emotions, but 
empathy with Graham isn't what Ross is aiming for.  In fact, had we felt 
anything for the main character, it would have disrupted the director's 
delicate balance of horror, comedy, and social parody.</P>
<P>     The world according to Graham Young (memorably portrayed by Hugh 
O'Conor) is a strange place.  To the 14-year old, it's populated by a 
series of bizarre caricatures, and the only feeling he can muster for 
any of them is contempt.  His stepmother (Ruth Sheen) and father (Roger 
Lloyd Pack) are uncaring buffoons, and his sister, Winnie (Charlotte 
Coleman) suffers from excessive narcissism.  Graham starts tinkering 
with chemistry because, in his words, "Life is a series of illusions 
that only a scientist could strip away."  When he begins putting 
antimony sulfide in his vials, he's trying to make a diamond, but the 
inadvertent byproduct of this experiment, a lethal toxin, intrigues 
Graham more than any sparkling gem could have.</P>
<P>     Soon, Graham has poisoned his mother.  Keeping a meticulously-
detailed diary of her day-by-day progress, he charts her improvements 
and relapses as he decreases and increases her dosages (he puts it in 
the medicine that's supposed to cure her).  Eventually, she dies, and, 
when Graham tries to repeat the experiment with his father, the police 
catch him.  He's committed to an institution for the criminally insane, 
where, after several years of intense psychotherapy, he is deemed fit to 
re-enter society.  However, it's only a matter of time before Graham is 
again seduced by the poisonous lure of a skull-and-crossbones marked 
bottle.</P>
<P>     When it's on target, as it is during most of the first and last 
half-hours, THE YOUNG POISONER'S HANDBOOK is fascinating, lively, and 
(admittedly) slightly sick.  But it also makes a pointed statement about 
how men in the criminal justice system, when assuming the role of God, 
can make horrible mistakes simply because they can't conceive of ever 
being wrong.  Graham Young is a case in point.  He never should have 
been let out of the mental hospital, but, because a doctor (Antony Sher) 
pronounces him cured, he is released. </P>
<P>     THE YOUNG POISONER'S HANDBOOK sags noticeably in the middle.  The 
sequences featuring Graham in the hospital aren't compelling, and the 
young man's supposedly-legitimate conversion from heartless manipulator 
to model prisoner feels artificial.  Graham's relationship with another 
parent-killing prisoner comes across as flat.</P>
<P>     THE YOUNG POISONER'S HANDBOOK is designed to keep the audience off-
balance, and that's exactly what it does.  As presented here, Graham 
isn't worth caring about, but he provides the perfect filter for Ross' 
exploration of life's macabre side.  More than anything else, THE YOUNG 
POISONER'S HANDBOOK can be appreciated for its grotesque satire.  Be 
warned, however:  those without a taste for this sort of thing will find 
themselves unpleasantly surprised by the toxic manner in which this 
picture develops.</P>
