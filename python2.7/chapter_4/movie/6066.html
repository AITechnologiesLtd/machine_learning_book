<PRE>                              A TIME TO KILL
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: In a sweaty Mississippi town two
          young white men rape and nearly murder a ten-year-
          old black girl.  The girl's father takes justice
          into his own hands and murders the two men in the
          town courthouse.  The resulting trial and its
          resulting racial tensions touch everybody in the
          town.  The film based on John Grisham's first novel
          spreads its attentions over a large number of
          characters, many played by familiar actors.
          Economically, it develops only a few, but it gives
          a many-sided look at a town in turmoil.  Rating:
          high +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     John Grisham's first novel is also (reportedly) his most serious.
It makes his most interesting film adaptation to date.  That is in
large part because it is a serious story, looking at racial tension
rather than being a throwaway thriller.  It makes the most satisfying
of his films, if slightly over-polished and simplistic.  Rather than
telling one complex story, it jumps around showing a broad collection
of characters, few of whom get much development but many of whom get
nice rounded stories that reach conclusions.  None of the individual
subplots is very original or interesting, but the total is more than
the some of its parts.  Like a narrative mural we get a large picture
made of many smaller stories of what happens during a trial and the
resulting clash of townspeople at both ends of the political spectrum.</P>
<P>     The setting is Canton, Mississippi, with its mix of small town and
rural people.  As the film opens we see two white men in their early
twenties looking for trouble and finding it by raping and very nearly
murdering a ten-year-old black girl.  Unexpectedly, the girl lives and
within hours the two men are behind bars.  But the girl's father, Carl
Lee Hailey (played by Samuel L. Jackson) is filled with rage and fear
of the very real possibility that the men could end up not being
punished for their crime.  In a rage he hides himself in the town
courthouse and the next morning as the men are being walked through he
takes justice into his own hands and guns down the two men,
accidentally also crippling a deputy escorting the men.  For his
defense he chooses a local white lawyer and acquaintance Jake Brigance
(Matthew McConaughey), to whom Hailey had hinted the day before that he
might be planning to murder the rapists.  Brigance decides to use
defense of temporary insanity, though it is relatively obvious that the
killing was an angry act of revenge but not insanity.  Through Brigance
we meet his daughter and his wife (Ashley Judd) who is reluctant to
have her husband take the emotionally-charged case.  We also meet
Brigance's old law professor (Donald Sutherland), now disbarred and
enjoying a drunken retirement.  Kevin Spacey plays an ambitious and
tricky prosecutor wanting to ride the case to bigger things, and
Patrick McGoohan plays the aptly-named Judge Noose.  Most unlikely
seeming, is the arrival of a brilliant, attractive law student, Ellen
Roark (Sandra Bullock) anxious to bull her way onto the defense team
with an impressive arsenal of legal knowledge.  But the trial also
beings a revival of the dormant Ku Klux Klan threatening everybody on
the defense team.</P>
<P>     Director Joel Schumacher's strong suit has us usually been setting
and mood.  This was certainly the case with his brooding Gothic medical
school in FLATLINERS and his oversized but under-thought BATMAN
FOREVER.  His Mississippi town is less exaggerated, but little details
seem to be intentionally carried a bit too far. Housewife Ashley Judd
looks to be laminated in sweat, as if she was sprayed with Pam, but
only from the neck down and no other character is sweating nearly so
profusely.  As the Klan walks into town a plate glass window reflects
them as three times their height--Schumacher's visual sense often plays
with size--and far more intimidating than they actually are.  Peter
Menzies, Jr., gives the film's photography a somewhat more subdued feel
than previous Schumacher films, but the director's style is still
there.</P>
<P>     A TIME TO KILL has been compared to Robert Mulligan's TO KILL A
MOCKINGBIRD and naturally it falls considerably short of that film.
But the two films are related only in subject matter.  I would be more
likely to compare A TIME TO KILL to Spike Lee's DO THE RIGHT THING in
its breadth rather than depth view of the people affected by the trial.
This film is really not moving and perhaps not even greatly intelligent
in the way that TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD was, but it gives a feel for
Southern politics and law better than other Grisham films and it tells
its story engrossingly.  I give it a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
