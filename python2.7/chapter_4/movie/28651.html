<P>    In Steven Spielberg's monumental fairy tale "A.I.: Artificial
Intelligence," a lonely and unhappy robot named David is able to
give love to his parents but his affection is not reciprocated.  In
that touching story, we in the audience ignore the fact that David
is an android, as Spielberg means us to do, and root for him to
get that metaphoric kiss from the princess--and become a real
human being.  The idea that one cannot be whole without love is
pretty much part of the American culture, but John Cameron
Mitchell subverts the notion that the love of another is the alpha
and omega of human existence with his canny film taken from the
off-Broadway hit by the same name, "Hedwig and the Angry Inch." 
Like Woody Allen, Mitchell's role as writer, actor and star in his
own movie puts just about the entire burden of success on his
shoulders, and the hugely talented man comes across with a
poignant, funny, production featuring his tour de force
performance as the title character.  As a musical in which the
songs regularly advance the plot, "Hedwig" is as different from
"The Sound of Music" as Bach's "Passacaglia and Fugue" is from
Bill Haley's "Rock Around the Clock."  The key word is "different,"
and therein lies much of its appeal.  Saturated as we here in New
York are with Broadway revivals of dated works like "Annie Get
Your Gun," "Kiss Me Kate," and "42nd Street, we should greet
this transsexual named Hedwig with the open arms that she
herself longs for during most of the story's 91 minutes, a
refreshing blend of Stephen Trask's stirring and meaningful rock
music, Frank G. DeMarco's pastel cinematography, Emily
Hubley's imaginative animation, and a production design by
Therese De Prez that appropriately expands the play well beyond
the stage.</P>
<P>   "Hedwig and the Angry Inch," which is the remarkable John
Cameron Mitchell's film debut as a director, premiered at the
recent Sundance Festival and should attract quite a bit of
enthusiasm from the critics as well when it opens, presumably on
a limited number of screens.  Told with an abundance of
flashbacks, the yarn  opens with a rousing song belted out by
Mitchell, after which we flash back to his more youthful days as a
child in Berlin with the name of Hansel (Ben Mayer-Goodman). 
Though Hansel watches his mother slapping and pounding her
man and driving him from their East Berlin digs, he absorbs a
lesson from his mom (Albert Watson) that life is worthwhile only
when you find your other half--poor advice that informs the lad's
thinking when he's not bopping to the sounds of rock on
American Forces Radio.  Encouraged to marry an American
soldier (Maurice Dean Wint) to get out of communist East Berlin,
he must first get a physical--which requires him to get a primitive
sex change operation which is botched: the doctor took away five
inches below the belt, leaving one inch behind.</P>
<P>   Mitchell takes us on a dismal tour of Hedwig's rock band which
the singer, donning various copious wigs, takes to the most
dismal and sparsely inhabited clubs and coffee houses in Miami
Beach, Kansas and the like, at one point recruiting a small group
of Korean women to play electric guitar.  At one point he falls in
love with a cherubic Jesus freak, Tommy (Michael Pitt), who
reacts strongly upon finally touching the eponymous angry inch. 
Hedwig will see himself not only betrayed by the no-longer-
innocent young man but virtually deserted by his lead backup
singer, Yitzhak (Miriam Shor--who looks every bit a man).</P>
<P>   If "A.I." is the exploration of unrequited love, then "Hedwig and
the Angry Inch" is an inquiry into the meaning of wholeness.  Are
we as individuals spending too much time preening and primping
and marketing ourselves to others, as though their affection for us
is all that we require?  Should we not look more deeply into our
own selves for what we feel we we're missing?</P>
<P>   What puts "Hedwig" over the top is the fortunate marriage of
music and motif, personality and panache.  Mitchell is astounding
in the role of a man whose identity as a transsexual is almost
incidental to his search for completion.  He tugs at our
heartstrings, he makes us laugh, he forces us to care far more
than the pathetic folks in the audience during his character's early
career as a songwriter and interpreter.  He is backed up by a
technical team that meshes animation, music and design, giving
the picture the very completion that Hedwig himself so earnestly
seeks.</P>
