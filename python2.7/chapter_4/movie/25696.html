<PRE>Gone In 60 Seconds </PRE>
<P>Nicholas Cage is Randall "Memphis" Raines, a retired car thief who is
blackmailed back into the business by a really creepy crime ring
leader who will kill Raines' younger brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi)
because of something he messed up. Raines has to steal 50 cars in a
short amount of time and in order to do he has to round up a gang of
characters that could only be found in a Jerry Bruckheimer movie.</P>
<P>If you saw "Armageddon" or "Con Air" you can make a lot of assumptions
about this film and be correct.  The difference this time is that the
subject matter is a little more tame, the tone is lighthearted and
fun, it's not so trite and unbelievable. Raines is a nice guy but
technically, he's a criminal, yet we don't want him to be
caught. There's a subplot involving two detectives' efforts to catch
Raines and his gang and amazingly, it works well and is actually
suspenseful and exciting - exactly what a summer movie should be!
Think of as a thriller for the whole family.</P>
