<PRE>                          THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This is a film that sneaks up on you.
          The romance is cute and well written, but it is not
          actually the main thrust.  The real subject is
          politics, mudslinging and deal-making.  It is about
          a fictional President, but the issues it raises are
          relevant and timely.  It is an enjoyable film, but
          also more than just a light entertainment.  Rating:
          +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Just in case you did not notice this film was "Capra-esque,"
scriptwriter Aaron Sorkin works the term into the dialogue.  But even
if he had not, there would have been inevitable comparisons to Frank
Capra's techniques of pulling the viewer in with one story and then
introducing a much more relevant plotline.  And this film is in a class
with MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON and MEET JOHN DOE.  THE AMERICAN
PRESIDENT is a bright, witty romantic comedy with really good dialogue,
but at the same time it is a statement about politics, and about
politicians, some who are idealists and some who are opportunists.
This is a film that purrs and a film that has claws--not big ones, but
claws nonetheless.</P>
<P>     President Andrew Shepherd (played by Michael Douglas) is an
idealist and a Democrat with a high approval rating from the American
public.  Shepherd is a widower with a teenage daughter.  He gets along
tolerably well with Republicans and with the environmental lobby,
treading a path somewhere in between.  When he overhears a new
environmental lobbyist, Sydney Ellen Wade (Annette Bening), making
insulting comments about him he is intrigued by her and invites the
flustered woman to be his date for a state dinner.  Eventually they are
seeing more of each other in spite of warnings from his staff that
dating a woman will hurt his approval rating.  It soon becomes clear
that they are right, as an opponent, Senator Bob Rumson (Richard
Dreyfuss) who is adept at political hardball, begins mounting a smear
campaign suggesting that Wade is a flag-burner and that she is using
sex to sway the President's opinions.  The President's interest in Wade
is exaggerated into an all-out attack on family values.  The
President's sagging approval rating forces some hard decisions.</P>
<P>     Sorkin's dialogue with Rob Reiner's direction is witty, sharp, and
a lot of fun.  While the entire course of the President's relationship
with Wade is easily predictable, there are some very funny situations
built around what would happen if a modern President did decide to
date.  Reiner's film has the undeniable charm in portraying the
President trying to do what seem like simple tasks like ordering
flowers and dating.  There is a charm in seeing a lobbyist awed and
flustered by the attentions of the President.  And for a while the film
rides on all that charm.  But the film does a lot more than that.  The
film is something of an education in how modern politics works.  We see
something of the complex deals and strategies which anyone in high
political office must contend.</P>
<P>     The cast is a bit overpowered with familiar faces in almost every
reasonable role.  Martin Sheen, Michael J. Fox, and David Paymer are
advisors to the President.  I was pleased to see Anna Deavere Smith in
an important role as the President's press secretary.  Smith proved
herself to be a first rank character actor with an incredible acting
range in her one-woman show "Fires in the Mirror," filmed for PBS.
Other familiar faces include Samantha Mathis, John Mahoney, and Nina
Siemaszko.  Marc Shaiman's score is dignified and sounds Presidential.
The photography looks convincingly like it was filmed in the White
House, no doubt due in large part to contributions by Industrial Light
and Magic.</P>
<P>     Like many of the films of Frank Capra, THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT can
be seen as a light entertainment and at the same time a somewhat deeper
look at the problems in American politics.  To balance both as adroitly
as it does, I rate it a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
