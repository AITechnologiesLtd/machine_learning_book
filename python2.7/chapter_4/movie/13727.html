<P>Elizabeth Berkley stars as Nomi Malone, a struggling dancer trying 
to make it to the top in Paul Verhoeven's controversial movie, 
Showgirls.</P>
<P>Nomi is working the only job she could find, an erotic stripper at 
the Cheetah Club.  Although the pay isn't bad and she enjoys being 
able to dance, she develops a somewhat low self-esteem from one of 
her job's attributes, private lap dancing.  After Nomi is introduced 
to Las Vegas show dancing star Cristal Connors, Nomi soon gets a 
taste of cruel manipulation, but also, is given the chance to prove 
herself as a dancer.  By doing so, she is able to pull away from her 
stripping job, but she doesn't know that what she is getting into 
could be too hot to handle.  As the movie progresses, Nomi discovers 
that there is a price to pay for fame and fortune, behind all of the 
glitz and glamour.  She learns that she, too, is becoming part of the 
Las Vegas team when she becomes manipulative and opportunistic just 
like those around her.  How far will she go to get to the top?</P>
<P>Showgirls explores the erotic world of stripping and show dancing 
through this beautifully done picture.  Manipulation and self 
discovery are the basis for this well written, well-researched drama. 
 The story evolves around the Las Vegas show, Goddess, which is 
performed at the Stardust Hotel, portrays stylish dancing and a 
musical score that is not only spunky, but sensual and exciting as 
well.  The rest of the movie also portrays great music with its hip 
soundtrack, adding variety and rhythm to the rest of the film. </P>
<P>Although harshly judged by critics, Elizabeth Berkley is not only a 
fine actress, but a well-spoken dancer as well.  Berkley brings Nomi 
a sensuous style to her dancing that few people could have done with 
the ease and grace that Berkley did.  Berkley also adds mystery to 
the character's background, hinting with small clues to her troubled 
past in different parts of the movie.  Although Nomi makes mistakes, 
the viewer can't help but sympathize for her, knowing that her 
intentions were mainly good,  noting that her actions had been 
tainted by those around her.  </P>
<P>Gina Gershon portrays Cristal Connors, the famous Las Vegas dancer 
starring in the lead role of Goddess.  Gershon brings out a 
manipulative side in Cristal that is very surreal to the viewer 
because she doesn't go over the top with it.  She keeps Cristal's 
mean streak oblivious to everyone but Nomi and the viewer, making her 
a sly obstacle for Nomi to overcome.  At first, Cristal looks down on 
Nomi as if she were nothing but a whore, but we later learn in the 
movie that there is something more to Cristal's interest in the young 
dancer.  Cristal sees Nomi as a mirror image of herself when she 
began many years ago and sees Nomi as a worthy follower, but she is 
determined to give Nomi a hard time climbing the ladder of fame.</P>
<P>Kyle MacLachlan plays Zak Carey, the entertainment director of the 
Stardust Hotel.  From minute one, we know there is something off 
about his character.  Later in the movie, we discover that he, too, 
can manipulate with the best of them.  He is also determined to have 
Nomi for himself, and manipulates anything that stands in his way, 
including Nomi.  </P>
<P>Showgirls is one of those movies that has to be watched with an open 
mind and all stereotypes must be put aside to fully understand and 
enjoy the film's quality  and story.  I think many people disliked 
the film because they were unwilling to accept that America's 
sweetheart, Elizabeth Berkley, had grown up from her "Saved by the 
Bell" role, and was now into a more mature, provocative role.  </P>
<P>Available with an R rating or an NC-17 on VHS, this film comes 
highly recommended to those who are seeking an entertaining and 
provocative movie with an intense plot and great acting.  </P>
