<P>        One of these days, somebody may come along and make another great
musical. I'm not talking about PENNIES FROM HEAVEN, the British miniseries
(and Hollywood remake) that defined the impossibility of making another
great musical. I'm not talking about likely embarrassments like the
forthcoming EVITA, either. (If you ask me, the best thing that could
happen to Broadway musicals right now might be the announcement of Andrew
Lloyd Webber's imminent retirement.) I want an intelligent, tuneful
extravaganza along the lines of something Stanley Donen might have made --
SINGIN' IN THE RAIN or even FUNNY FACE. </P>
<P>        You can hold your breath waiting for that to happen -- when you
get frustrated, but before you've quite turned blue, visit your local art
house for the revival of THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG. This singular little
production was first exported from France in 1964, and while it's not
quite as intoxicated on its own production values as the liveliest MGM
musicals, it probably benefits from its perspective on the self-aware
trailing edge of the vaunted Nouvelle Vague. Director Jacques Demy and
composer Michel Legrand tread confidently through dangerous territory,
concocting the film as a "pure"  musical -- almost an operetta, with no
spoken lines of dialogue at all, only song. In an oddly prescient casting
coup, the relative ingenue Catherine Deneuve was given the lead role of
Genevieve, the young daughter of an umbrella shop owner. She is in love
somewhat beneath her station, with Guy, an auto mechanic played sweetly by
Nino Castelnuevo. Naturally, Genevieve's mother registers gentle but firm
disapproval of this relationship, and it's with a mixture of pragmatism
and relief that she consoles her daughter on the news that her sweetheart
has been drafted into two years of military service. </P>
<P>        The film is divided into three sections, and for my money, the
first is at once the most melodramatic and the most affecting. Titled
"Departure,"  this act chronicles the headlong affection of the two lovers
and the lush, nearly intolerable torture exacted on them when they learn
of their impending separation. It culminates in a wrenching, tear-soaked
railway platform farewell that's no less powerful for being a cinematic
hand-me-down. A tremendous asset is Legrand's love theme, which has
already intimated itself into the film's texture, but here is sweeping and
thunderous in full Dolby reverb. </P>
<P>        I'm usually wary of remixed soundtracks, but it does seem to make
sense with material as musical as this (or the reissued TAXI DRIVER, which
rated similar treatment for Bernard Herrmann's fine score). As remixed by
Legrand himself, THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG sounds fine and looks even
better, although some of the more colorful shots bear artifacts of the
technicolor restoration process -- the original Eastmancolor release
negative has been unusable for most of the film's life. </P>
<P>        Even so, it might have been nice if the color scheme weren't quite
so insistent. While the relentless mirroring of loud wallpaper with
equally shrill, matching costumes helps to establish a level of ironic
detachment that may be key to the film, it certainly breaks the spell of
the flatly gorgeous song and earnest performances. And after the nearly
perfect first segment, the second of three acts is a little tiresome,
plodding toward a foregone conclusion. </P>
<P>        I hope I'm not spoiling anything if I tell you that the second act
is titled "Absence" and the third "Return." While Guy is away, Genevieve's
mother is given the opportunity to quietly encourage her to marry her new
suitor, a world-traveling jewelry dealer. Genevieve remains fond of Guy,
but finally relents and agrees to be married (viewers may note that, even
in this relatively fresh-faced persona, Deneuve was acquiring her
reputation as aloof and untouchable.) In the third act, Guy returns and
finds that -- well, he finds that everything has changed. </P>
<P>        It's perhaps a characteristic of Demy's New Wave sensibility (he
had recently married Agnes Varda, after all) that a film this delirious in
its visuals and rapturous emoting can be, at the same time, so
distressingly sober. Demy's film doesn't give Guy the chance to woo and
win back his beloved, and it barely allows him his own sadness. The real
sadness, interestingly, is our own. These lives have not turned out the
way they had once seemed predestined, nor does the film turn out the way
we had hoped it might. The final scene, which at last reunites the two,
ever so briefly, is perhaps unavoidable, but this story is an inexorably
sorrowful one.  Denied our escapist pleasure, we can only watch,
misty-eyed, as the cinematic dream falls apart -- as the musical,
presumably, deconstructs itself.</P>
