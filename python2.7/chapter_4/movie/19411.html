<PRE>Review:                EYES WIDE SHUT</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:        Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman,  Sidney Pollack,
                And everyone in the film.</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by:        Stanley Kubrick</PRE>
<PRE>Reviewed by:        Joy Wyse, the SILVER Screen Critic</PRE>
<P>There has always been the question about the difference between Art and
Pornography.   I was reticent about seeing this film because of the hype
and the previews that preceded it.  I dreaded that I might be offended or
embarrassed by it.  No. It is Art.</P>
<P>How many times have you scoffed at an actor who declares that he (or she)
would consider nudity `if the role warrants it for artistic reasons' when
you know full well that he's only making a dumb excuse.  The nudity in
this film did not bother me in the slightest.  It is Art.</P>
<P>Never before have I seen a motion picture that has stayed with me in its
entirety.  I can call to mind every single scene that I saw.  Each and
every actor is embedded in my head, from the leads to the one-liners. 
There are constant surprises, such as the costume shop, and the hotel
clerk that are special, but even the rowdies on the street or the butlers
are perfect.  I don't think that Kubrick only did take after take with the
stars, he did it with everyone.  What a thrill those actors must have felt
to have a Director bring them to full performance rather than dismissing
them as `background'.</P>
<P>This movie is a very deep study into the workings of a marriage.  Love is
not the only basis for a lasting commitment.  Just as important is trust,
without which, love crumbles.  That is the basis of the plot.  Here is a 
happily married couple, with a darling, educated daughter.  They are
financially secure, socially prominent and physically attracted to each
other.  They have achieved the American dream.  </P>
<P>They are so secure in their relationship that it bothers her when he
doesn't show jealousy about her and a flirtation.  The distrust starts to
build and they jibe at each other.  What happens in the next 48 hours is a
great presentation of what could occur.  </P>
<P>This is a Masterpiece.  This is Art.  I do want to see it again, but I
don't need to.  It's imbedded in my mind.</P>
<PRE>It's a definite A.</PRE>
<PRE>SEE YOU AT THE MOVIES. </PRE>
