<PRE>MEET THE DEEDLES
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Part buddy comedy, part fish-out-of-water story, part nature tale, Meet
the Deedles is not nearly as interesting as any of those archetypes. In
fact, it is an invitation you ought to disregard.</P>
<P>Phil and Stew Deedle (Paul Walker and Steve Van Wormer) are the twin
sons of the famous millionaire, Elton Deedle (Eric Braeden), founder of
Deedle Enterprises.  Elton wants his sons to be the perfect heirs to his
fortune...instead the two are careless Hawaiian surf bums.  To set them
straight, he enrolls them into a strict Wyoming boot camp, to which the
pair inevitably go.</P>
<P>After several misadventures in Wyoming, where the duo is stunned to
discover there's no surf, the brothers Deedle stumble upon a routine
mistaken identity plot.  They arrive at Yellowstone National Park, where
they are believed to be two new park ranger recruits.  Rather than
slinking back home and disappointing their dad, the Deedles play along.
Phil, actually, has other motives:  the beautiful park ranger Jesse (A.
J. Langer), who unfortunately happens to be the beloved stepdaughter of
the overprotective Park Ranger Captain Douglas Pine (John Ashton).</P>
<P>Yellowstone has a problem.  It's only a week before the famous geyser
Old Faithful celebrates its one billionth birthday, and the park is
being overrun with prairie dogs.  Not just one or two...thousands of
them. The Deedles are assigned to eliminate the P.Dog menace, not
knowing that it all is part of a fiendish plan by disgraced former Head
Ranger Frank Slater (Dennis Hopper).</P>
<P>The Brothers Deedle aren't supposed to be out-and-out stupid, like the
team from Dumb and Dumber, or Bill and Ted.  Instead, their brains just
operate in a different, simpler, realm.  A more accurate comparison
would be  with Carrot Top in Chairman of the Board, a film which,
unfortunately, this one resembles in several hideous ways.</P>
<P>The central problem with Meet the Deedles is that it simply just isn't
funny.  There's a moment when Phil utters the line, "Insert Laugh Here",
which nearly sums up the entire Meet the Deedles experience.</P>
<P>The result isn't bad in a run-shrieking-from-the-theater type of way.
Instead, it's merely bad in an excruciatingly boring sort of way. The
cast seems decent, but they're never asked to do anything remotely
interesting.  Instead, the film inundates the audience with countless
shots of people and/or cars rolling downhill in the forest, and with
constant annoying references to other Disney films.</P>
<P>You'll have much better luck finding a good spot to surf in Wyoming than
finding entertainment in Meet the Deedles.</P>
