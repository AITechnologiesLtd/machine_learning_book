<PRE>                                SPHERE
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: SPHERE starts out exciting, turns
          into an intriguing puzzle, then degrades to a
          haunted house horror film, and finally it is all
          pulled together with an overly-familiar idea.
          SPHERE is faithful to a fairly mediocre novel that
          fails to grab the viewer.  It is over-powered with
          a more distinguished cast than it really needs, but
          somehow the actors never bring the story to life.
          Rating: 4 (0 to 10), 0 (-4 to +4)
          New York Critics: (2 positive, 12 negative, 2
          mixed)</PRE>
<P>     Michael Crichton has had a long career of writing novels, many of
which are science fiction.  The most profitable film adaptation of any
novel was an adaptation of a Michael Crichton science fiction novel.
So in the logic of the film industry a good way to make a profitable
film would be to make a big-budget adaptation of another Crichton
science fiction novel.  CONGO failed, and I am afraid that SPHERE is
probably not going to fare a whole lot better.  It a little better than
just okay novel and it makes a film that is not even that good.  The
film is expensive, over one hundred million dollars; is long, 133
minutes; has a terrific cast, including Dustin Hoffman, Samuel L.
Jackson, and Sharon Stone; but has little that is really original and
less that is exciting.</P>
<P>     Several years ago Dr. Norman Goodman (played by Dustin Hoffman)
was asked to write up a set of procedures for the government to
follow if an alien entity was actually encountered.  The plan he
wrote was only semi-serious, but did explicitly define a team of
experts who should investigate the alien.  Now that team has been
assembled by a mysterious team leader named Barnes (Peter Coyote) to
study a spacecraft almost a half mile in length that apparently
dropped into the Pacific Ocean in the early 1700s.  Suddenly Norman's
less than serious procedure has become an action plan for dealing
with a real alien spacecraft.  Included in the team to investigate
are mathematician Harry Adams (Samuel L. Jackson), biologist Beth
Halperin (Sharon Stone), and astrophysicist Ted Fielding (Liev
Schreiber).  Together they travel to the deep Pacific spaceship to
understand its secrets.  One major secret is the meaning of the huge
sphere of gold-toned liquid metal at the heart of this spaceship.</P>
<P>     What is disappointing about this film is that it does not have
really effective performances.  Director Barry Levinson is at his best
with good actors rather than good special effects.  The problem here is
he is making a big-budget science fiction film.  It has some effects,
but the most intriguing effect he shows only as an outline on a radar
screen.  The technique is to suggest rather than to show and let the
actors and the viewer's imagination carry the film as Robert Wise did
with THE HAUNTING.  That could be a reasonable approach in a low-budget
film.  But that requires creating much more atmosphere than Levinson
can manage to muster.  It requires the actors to give really compelling
performances and simply put, they don't.  Hoffman's acting seems muted.
Jackson seems to laid back.  We do not feel for these characters and
do not get inside their heads.  Levinson paid big bucks for his actors
and does not really get price performance.  And why we have Queen
Latifah as a minor functionary on the expedition is anybody's guess.A
cast of unknowns could have delivered as much emotional impact at a
fraction of the price.  Look how much more powerful a film like ALIEN
was with only moderate actors.</P>
<P>     Most science fiction spectaculars these days have second-tier
actors and first-tier special effects.  Levinson tries second-tier
effects, and first-tier actors, but never makes that exchange pay off
for the viewer.  Perhaps sci-fi spectaculars are just not an actor's
medium.  The result gets a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and 0 on the -4 to +4
scale.</P>
