<P>ROMY AND MICHELE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION</P>
<PRE>A Film Review by Brian Takeshita</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  **1/2 out of ****</PRE>
<P>I've got a couple more years until my ten-year high school reunion.  I
therefore have that much time to lose fifteen pounds, make twenty
million dollars, become famous, and marry Sandra Bullock.  But let's
face it, I'd be lucky just to lose the weight.  Movies made about high
school reunions are very sympathetic toward this predicament.  The
plot is pretty much always the same:  The main characters get an
invitation to their ten-year reunion, and realize that they are not
what they wanted to be by this time.  They make up an elaborate ruse
to fool people into thinking they are more successful than they really
are, only to have their cover blown at the reunion itself, causing
significant shame.  However, through a process of learning that
certain other classmates are also not doctors, lawyers, corporate
heads or movie stars, while still others who have achieved "success"
are not leading the fantasy life they thought they would, our heroes
find that just by being happy, they are success stories after all.</P>
<P>ROMY AND MICHELE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION follows this formula to a tee.
Romy (Mira Sorvino) and Michele (Lisa Kudrow) are friends who have
stayed together since high school, having moved from their hometown of
Tucson, Arizona, to Venice Beach, California. Romy is a cashier at the
service department of the local Jaguar dealership, while Michele is
one of California's gainfully unemployed.  They find out through a
classmate (Janeane Garafolo) that their reunion is a couple of weeks
away, and while filling in an informational survey for the event,
realize that they have not come nearly as far as they had expected.
After failed attempts to lose weight (how much more stick-thin could
they get?) and find good jobs and dreamy boyfriends, they hatch a
scheme to show everyone up by agreeing to pretend to be successful
businesswomen.</P>
<P>>From the beginning of the film, Romy and Michele are so full of
themselves and their appearances, I thought I was watching a movie
about the reunion for the high school class from CLUELESS.  Needless
to say, I didn't start viewing this movie caring for the characters
very much at all; Romy and Michele are quite simply annoying, with
annoying ways of talking and annoying little laughs.  We only start
identifying with them as protagonists because we find out through a
series of high school flashbacks that there were other students even
more self absorbed than them.  Once that is made plain, the two women
become a little more likable.</P>
<P>The film does a good job of characterizing some of the cliques which
comprise the teen social strata, and it's fun to watch them on screen.
There's the "A Group", made up of the debutantes and the handsome
jocks, the "B Group" comprised of the drama people, the "C group"
consisting of your various kinds of nerds, and then there are your
loners.  The representation of each group is pushed just the right
amount over the top so you can have a nice laugh reminiscing.  Too
much would have made them utterly ridiculous and unidentifiable.  Too
little would have probably caused horrifying flashbacks of your own.
Romy and Michele decide they don't quite fit into any of those groups,
but I'd say "airhead" transcends many categories.</P>
<P>As astonishing as it is, there is actually some decent character
development.  By the end of the movie, the two women not only find out
something about themselves, which is always the case is this formula,
but also about each other.  Take, for example, their plot to tell
everyone at the reunion that they developed Post-It Notes as a team.
Michele is horrified to learn that Romy doesn't think anyone would
believe that Michele would do more than suggest they make the notes
yellow.  "You're more of a design person," she tells Michele, implying
that she doesn't have the brains to do much more than express
feelings.  To the credit of screenwriter Robin Schiff, the conflict
between the two friends is not suddenly laid in our laps to give us
drama at the right point.  Instead, the first allusions to a possible
falling out occur shortly after they find out about the reunion, and
it builds from there.  This not only fleshes out the characters in a
more believable way, but also results in a nice way of showing how
reunions can bring out the worst in everyone.</P>
<P>Mira Sorvino does a competent job playing Romy, who is annoying and
vacuous but not completely hopeless.  Lisa Kudrow is basically playing
the character she plays on "Friends", but for an hour and a half.  She
is definitely the heir apparent to the ditz queen title previously
held by the likes of Goldie Hawn and Teri Garr.  Janeane Garafolo is
the one who really steals the show as the highly successful but
mean-spirited classmate who's spite is indiscriminate.  Unlike the "A
Group", she is just mean to everybody, and her interactions with other
characters is absolutely hilarious.  Although she's not on camera for
much of the film, any more screen time would have seen diminishing
marginal returns.</P>
<P>True to formula, the reunion goes exactly as you'd expect.  You're
given a message about human nature and society, and you take it with a
grain of salt.  I suppose it's because so many of us have faced or
will be faced with a situation similar to Romy and Michele's that by
the end of the film, you're actually hoping things will work out for
those who deserve it, even though you know they will.  That's in the
formula too, you know.</P>
