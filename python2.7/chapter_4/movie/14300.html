ROUNDERS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<PRE>     Mike McDermott once had an addiction, but he's kicked it.  </PRE>
<P>     Mike used to hide wads of cash all over the apartment he shares 
with his disapproving girlfriend (Gretchen Mol).  Like an alcoholic who 
has to have his hidden bottles to quench his drinking habit, he needed 
the greenbacks to support his gambling obsession.  As a guy who watches 
tapes again and again of the 1988 World Series of Poker, he sees himself 
as skillful rather than lucky.  He thinks he's invincible, but he's 
retired from poker.</P>
<P>     Now driving a delivery truck to pay for his law school tuition, he 
no longer frequents the tables with his fellow "rounders," i.e., people 
who gamble with those round chips.</P>
<P>     But like most alcoholics, his abstinence doesn't last long.</P>
<P>     GOOD WILL HUNTING's Academy Award nominee Matt Damon plays Mike as 
a smart guy who is convinced he has learned enough to join the 
poker-playing elite.  Mike is a pensive guy who can read a player's hand 
in a heartbeat by observing every nuance of the other player's 
expressions.</P>
<P>     In complete contrast, his buddy from high school, Worm, has just 
gotten out of prison - he was incarcerated for "distributing" credit 
cards.  Worm is a great "mechanic" at cards, but his judgement isn't as 
well developed as his cheating skills, which gets him into no end of 
trouble.  Played as a time bomb on a short fuse by PRIMAL FEAR's Academy 
Award nominee Edward Norton, he is as boisterous and unpredictable as 
Mike is silently calculating.</P>
<P>     John Dahl, director of the brilliant THE LAST SEDUCTION, takes a 
parsimonious and precise approach to his direction of ROUNDERS.  Scenes 
are staged for dramatic impact without requiring the actors to push the 
emotional envelope.</P>
<P>     The script by first-time screenwriters David Levien and Brian 
Koppelman takes a formula story and turns many of the rules upside down.  
The audience suspects that the movie may end in a big game, but the 
movie seems to be in no rush getting to it.  What the film becomes is an 
atmospheric character study of the world of gambling.  The script's 
sporadic humor bursts out periodically to shatter the story's more 
somber rhythms.  Mike speaks in frequent, rich narration to provide just 
enough explanation about the game to clear up some of its mysteries and 
to explain his character's motivations.  "You don't hear much about guys 
who take their shot and miss," he reflects in his most introspective 
moment.</P>
<P>     The ensemble cast is well chosen and developed to maximum 
advantage.  John Turturro plays a hardworking gambling professional who 
has alimony and child support to pay so he doesn't take chances.  He's 
more interested in paying living expenses than making the big score or 
becoming famous, which is a polar opposite to Mike's approach.  As 
Mike's supportive professor, Martin Landau provides Mike some key 
insights on life.  The professor, descended from a long line of rabbis, 
confides that he chose the law when he realized that he didn't believe 
in God.  In the best supporting role, a tackily dressed John Malkovich 
in his best performance in years, is the king of New York's card players 
and an ex-KGB agent.  Malkovich has an over-the-top accent that is 
nothing short of hilarious.</P>
<P>     ROUNDERS has a well-chosen name for more reasons than one.  An 
extremely well rounded film, it works as well in the small moments as 
well as the big ones.  Although the conclusion is satisfying and well 
developed, the journey itself is the reward.</P>
<P>     ROUNDERS runs 1:58.  It is rated R for some sex, nudity, profanity, 
and drug usage and would be fine for older teenagers.</P>
