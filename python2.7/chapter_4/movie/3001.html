<PRE>                                SOLEIL TROMPEUR

                Copyright 1994 <A HREF="mailto:al@167-290-33.hexacom.com">al@167-290-33.hexacom.com</A> (al)</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Nikita Mikhalkov.

Russia/France, 1993
Genre: drama.
152 minutes.</PRE>
<P>     SOLEIL TROMPEUR was shown in Cannes and at the Montreal Film Fest;
I think it did won some prizes, not sure though.  By the quality of the
film it wouldn't be surprising.  SOLEIL TROMPEUR (Deceiving Sun) comes
right after "Urga" in Mikhalkov's realisations.  And like "Urga," this
film got its share of beauty although this time around its emanating
from the people inside a rural Russian family in 1936.  Mikhalkov
(colonel Sergei Kotof) and his daughter are the main characters.  The
film relates the calm life of a family whose main character is a
well-known army colonel, admired by all, the kind of guy that has
strong roots in his country while having plentiful of simple and warm
human values.  Mikhalkov is a strong figure and the rural simplicity
emanates from him as easy as it could ever be.</P>
<PRE>     The film got its share of happiness and humour, of light and
joyfulness.</PRE>
<P>     But this very nice way of life will slowly give way to a terrible
drama as the smiles becomes forced instead of spontaneous, as the
arrival of a young and aggressive, former boyfriend of colonel Kotov's
young wife stirs up feelings.</P>
<P>     SOLEIL TROMPEUR is a film of great human force.  While it lasts
two and a half hours, it is never boring and does not have to rely on
action, special F/X and the like to maintain interest.  We share the
warmth displayed, the intrigue and the fatal conclusion.</P>
