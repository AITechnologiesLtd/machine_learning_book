DAMES AT TEA</PRE>
<PRE>TEA WITH MUSSOLINI
Directed by Franco Zeffirelli
Screenplay by Zeffirelli and John Mortimer
With Maggie Smith, Judi Dench
De Vargas    PG    117 min.</PRE>
<P>     Franco Zeffirelli's reminiscence of his formative years in
Mussolini's fascist Italy is pretty irresistible, in spite of a
persistent shallowness of story and a touch of weakness for self-
glorification.  What it has going for it is Zeffirelli's reliable
bonfire of surface vanities, including a nice evocation of period and
glorious camerawork by David Watkin ("Out of Africa"); and best of
all, a cast of actresses as delicious as the ice cream sundae
disparaged by one of their number as an American vulgarism.</P>
<P>Dame Maggie Smith is Lady Hester, widow of the former British
Ambassador and the doyenne of a clutch of pixillated British lady
expats in Florence known as the Scorpioni.  Lady Hester is a full-bore
snob, and when she snorts "Americans!", of course we love it.  Among
her circle are Arabella, a dotty romantic artist played by Dame Judi
Dench, whose career was crowned with a Tony this week, and Mary (Dame
Joan Plowright), secretary to a philandering Italian businessman.
Mary finds herself with the care and feeding of young Luca (Charlie
Lucas), the motherless and unwanted illegitimate son of her boss.
Luca, the end titles tell us, "grew up to be an artist and helped with
the making of this picture."  A degree in rocket science will help you
understand that Luca is Zeffirelli himself.</P>
<P>Rounding out this bevy of talent is that American vulgarism
herself, Elsa (Cher), a former showgirl who marries rich old men and
gives them a bang for their buck before they go on to their next
reward ("He's an angel," she confides of the latest, "or soon will
be....")</P>
<P>The Scorpioni are at tea in an elegant hotel dining room when
their protected world is rudely interrupted by shouting blackshirted
hooligans smashing the stained glass windows and letting in an
unpleasant whiff of the real world outside.  Troubled, the
ambassador's widow travels to Rome to see Mussolini, who smarmily
reassures her over tea that she has nothing to fear.</P>
<P>But of course she does, they all do, though when war breaks out
they stubbornly refuse to leave the country that is, after all, their
home.  They're rounded up as enemy aliens and incarcerated, though
they are soon moved to hotel quarters in San Gemignano -- courtesy,
Lady Hester is sure, of her friend and protector Il Duce.  At this
point the teenage Luca (Baird Wallace) returns from school in Austria,
where his father had sent him to learn to be a good Nazi.  Instead, he
devotes himself to the ladies and to the Resistance, and eventually
the war turns out well.</P>
<P>Smith and Dench reprise their characters from "A Room with a
View", but these ladies are so good that you gladly accept the
type-casting.  Best of all is Joan Plowright, who plays a lovely scene
with young Luca and a puppet stage that anticipates his future
calling.  Cher in her best scenes reminds us what a wonderful and
charming actress she is, and dazzles us with what can be truly called
a sculpted beauty.  Lily Tomlin is good in a smaller role.</P>
<P>It's an up-and-down ride, but it would be a shame to miss a movie
that offers such pleasures just because of a few shortcomings.  Take
"Tea" and see.</P>
