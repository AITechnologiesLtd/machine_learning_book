<P>     Place your foot on the accelerator.  Press down.  Watch the needle
on the speedometer creep above fifty.  Now you're trapped.  Whatever
happens, you can't drop below that level--if you do, you're dead, and
everyone on the bus with you.  It might not be tough to maintain that
speed on the freeway in the middle of the night, but this is rush
hour.  So what do you do when the traffic comes to a screeching halt up
ahead, without an off-ramp in sight?</P>
<P>     It's an ingenious premise that first-time director Jan De Bont has
turned into a tremendously well-executed motion picture.  A mad bomber
(Dennis Hopper) is out to get $3.7 million, and he'll stop at nothing
to get it--and to obtain a small measure of revenge on Jack Traven
(Keanu Reeves), a cop who foiled one of his plots.  So he rigs up a
bomb on a bus that becomes armed when the vehicle goes over fifty, and
is primed to explode when it drops below that speed.  And it's Jack's
job to save all the people on board--including himself.</P>
<P>     Good action movies are rare.  Great action movies come along once
every few years.  SPEED deserves a place in the latter category, being
the most intelligent and breath-stoppingly thrilling motion picture to
open since the original DIE HARD.  Normally, I like to write reviews
immediately after seeing a movie.  On this occasion, I had to wait
until the next morning--SPEED wore me out.</P>
<P>     This is a film that cries out for audience participation, whether
it be the silent majority's digging of fingers into armrests or the
vocal minority's cheers and catcalls.  SPEED is by no means an
intellectual challenge, but it's probably the most fun you can have in
any theater at this time.</P>
<P>     With a single exception (that of the bus "flying" through the
air), the stunts and special effects are flawlessly incorporated.  And
there are a lot of them.  A whole lot.  You could almost call this film
PLANES, TRAINS, AND AUTOMOBILES, although for entirely different
reasons than those behind the naming of the Steve Martin/John Candy
flick.</P>
<P>     SPEED is clearly divided into three acts, each no less draining
than the others.  The first and last (which involve an elevator and a
train, respectively) bookend the longer and better sequence on the
bus.  The film may clock in at nearly two hours, but the time, like the
various vehicles, races.  There is, quite literally, never a dull
moment.</P>
<P>     Of course, there are plot contrivances.  How could there not be?
But these are subtle and convincingly woven into the fabric of the
story.  While watching SPEED, you may notice one or two (for an
example, consider how a bus traveling at fifty-two can slam into a car
and have its speed not drop below the red line), but you won't care
much.</P>
<P>     The low-level but persistent humor is used to blot the tension.
Most of the one-liners aren't as good as those in DIE HARD, but a few
are worth a chuckle, and they serve their purpose.  This is not, after
all, supposed to be a comedy.</P>
<P>     I never thought I'd be saying this, but Keanu Reeves does an
excellent job.  The actor has the perfect demeanor for Jack Traven, the
cocky cop who tries hard not to get emotionally involved--and
inevitably fails.  Reeves' attitude and physical appearance are ideal,
and even those who visibly winced during his scenes in MUCH ADO ABOUT
NOTHING are likely to accept him here.</P>
<P>     Sandra Bullock (probably best known from DEMOLITION MAN), as the
passenger who takes the wheel from the incapacitated driver, possesses
enough charisma and spunk not to get outshone by her co-stars.  Dennis
Hopper turns in one of his patented performances as a psychotic
killer.</P>
<P>     There are reasons why the preview audiences have been raving about
SPEED, and a purpose to moving the opening date from August to June.
This movie is a winner, and the closest you can get to an amusement
park ride in a theater.  Perhaps the same warning that's used for
roller coasters should be applied here.  You know, the one about high
blood pressure and heart problems.</P>
<P>     Oh, and one more thing.  Don't make SPEED the first film in a
double bill.  No matter what the second movie is, it will suffer by
comparison.  If you still have the stamina left to see it, that is.</P>
