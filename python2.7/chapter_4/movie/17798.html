<P>   Do you ever get the impression that people are no damn
good?  What's that...you say you saw "The Sound of Music,"
and that proves the opposite?  Well, now, I guess everything
depends on what you see in the movies, on TV, in
cyberspace--now that we all get our impressions of
humankind through the media rather than via personal
contact.  "Goodbye, Lover," for example, uses songs from
"The Sound of Music" for the same ironic effect that made
the Broadway musical the chief point of hilarity in last year's
"Welcome to Woop Woop."  The Rodgers and Hammerstein
classic of 1959, which ran for 1433 performances in New
York, was a treacly bauble even for the 1950s, when
everyone was buttoned-up and innocent.  How silly the tunes
and lyrics sound today in the avaricious 90s, when for the
first time in history a guy could actually plot to kill his own
brother!  And how ingenious to use its strains for
incongruously humorous impact in this movie!</P>
<P>   "Goodbye, Lover," which includes a fratricidal plot, was
introduced to a warm reception at the Cannes Film Festival in
May 1998, yet the movie has been sitting in a can on the
studio shelf ever since, was scheduled for release in January,
2000, and has finally seen the dark of night on April 16 of this
year. Despite its crackling good plot, superior performances,
and elaborate design, online critic Michael Dequina feels that
"its sensibilities are too warped to appeal to a wide
audience."  Perhaps this was the Warner Bros.' motive in
keeping the goodies locked out of circulation for so long.  I
have more faith that there's indeed a extensive mass of
moviegoers out there--in Europe if not in America--who can
identity with the story's most cynical character, Detective
Pompano (Ellen DeGeneres).  DeGeneres consistently steals
every scene she's in with her misanthropic convictions,
amusingly putting down her Mormon partner (who gets the
last words and the most ironic lines in the movie), Detective
Rollins (Ray McKinnon).</P>
<P>   Avarice is the subtext that runs throughout the film from the
opening moments, as sensuous real estate agent Sandra
Dunmore (Patricia Arquette) sprints through some self-
improvement tapes which she has committed to memory as
she drives to her clients.  She alternates by singing along
with Julie Andrews, whose honey-tipped voice permeates her
home and car. Though hers is a childless, two-career family,
her ambitions are dragged down by her alcoholic husband,
Jake (Dermot Mulroney).  Discouraged by her mate's
performance, she conspires murder with her brother-in-law,
Ben (Don Johnson), with whom she is having an affair and
who is in turn serviced by his mousy assistant in the ad
agency, Peggy (Mary-Louise Parker).  When bodies begin
piling up, Detective Rita Pompano and her partner Rollins use
extralegal police tactics to flesh out the killers.  </P>
<P>   Sharp noir fans in the audience will likely figure out the
intricate twists and turns of writer Ron Peer's story, directed
with flair by Roland Joffe and stylistically filmed with great
attention to detail by Dante Spinotte--who was behind the
camera for the less tongue-in-cheek and more graphically
brutal "L.A. Confidential."  Once you perceive that nothing--
absolutely nothing--is as it seems, you should be able to
calculate who's double-dealing whom and whose back will
next get the figurative knife.  After all, when eight million
dollar in insurance money is at stake, you don't expect the
character to act quite like Maria Rainer, the postulant at
Nonnberg Abbey.</P>
<P>   Though some of the curves appear contrived, the film rocks
with high-caliber performances especially by Ellen DeGeneres
in her signature role as scoffer-laureate, scoring sit-comish
hits off her hayseed partner Rollins--who has the strange
impression that the police exist to serve and protect the
public and are unequivocally capable of doing just that. 
Patricia Arquette, consistently an endowed performer in such
difficult but intriguing indies like "Lost Highway" and "Ed
Wood," comes across strikingly as a bad, bad girl while
Dermot Mulroney and Don Johnson fill the bill as brothers
whose only similarity is their affinity for plotting.  "Goodbye
Lover" has sharper, more defined lines than "L.A.
Confidential." Here is a labyrinthine exercise in film gris
balancing tension with tongues-in-cheek to fashioning an
ironic, malevolent, acrid and effervescent thriller.</P>
