<P>     Anyone who has ever taught public school should get a (mild) charge
out of this one.  Tom Berenger stars as an out-of-work "operative" who
take his girlfriend's place at an inner-city high-school, after an
assault (on her) by a gang member.  He traces the attack back to a
student, quickly arranges some fake credentials, and shows up the next
day as "Mr. Smith." Just like that.  Predictable, poorly lit, and
possessing a tone that too easily shifts on a dime (from revenge fantasy
to message movie to all points in-between), THE SUBSTITUTE is best
enjoyed at face value.</P>
<P>     The ensemble acting is surprisingly sincere, with Berenger lean and
mean in the title role.  (He reminds me of how the Marvel Comics'
character The Punisher would behave on-screen, had he not been played by
the unfortunate Dolph Lundgren in that unfortunate 1990 movie.) The film
also has a strong sense humor, right down to the straight-faced
Schwarzenegger accent attempted by Berenger.  Of course, to enjoy this
nonsense, you have accept a harsh moral stance that allows, among other
things, all drug dealers to be shot on sight.  Exploitative?  Yes.
Gratuitous?  Yes.  Just remember to check your testosterone level before
entering.</P>
<P>     THE SUBSTITUTE kicks effective butt for about an hour and a half,
at which point the story finally-- inevitably?-- begins to repeat
itself.  The last twenty minutes are the worst:  Yet Another Showdown,
except this one so poorly lit that we can't tell who is shooting whom.
Leave a half-hour early and you won't miss a thing.  Really.  Now, if
only someone had thought to make DANGEROUS MINDS with Linda Hamilton
instead of Michelle Pfieffer.  She'd be back.</P>
