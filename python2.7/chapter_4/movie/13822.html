<P>Most of us are familiar with the works of Hong Kong filmmakers, such
as John Woo and Jackie Chan but there is so much more to Hong Kong
cinema than the action and Wu-Shu genre that floods the video stores
here in the west. "The King of Masks" is one of those rare films that
embraces it's cultural identity while making it identifiable for
anyone.  Director Wu Tian-ming ('Life' - 1984) has crafted one of the
most moving drama about China that we've ever seen. While not on a
production level of "Farewell, My Concubine", 'The King of Masks' is
solid film making by one of the art forms true masters.</P>
<P>The story is pretty straight forward.  Wang Bian-lian (Zhu Xu) is an
aging street performer trained in the Sichuan opera technique of face
changing, rapidly applying and removing elaborately decorated paper
masks. Un-married and without children Bian-lian is resigned to the
fact that he will not be able to pass his art down as he has no heir.
One evening, after a performance he comes across a destitute man who
is willing to sell his son. The two men barter out a price, and
Bian-lian returns to his houseboat with his new adoptive son, whom he
nick-names 'Doggie' (Zhou Ren-ying). Immediately showing the youngster
the tricks of the trade, the new family start their life
together. After several street performances, Bian-lian gambles at a
street market, showing his ability cutting bamboo. He is tricked by
the head merchant and accidentally cuts his foot. He asks for his new
grandson, 'Doggie' to urinate on the ashes of burnt cloth to help stop
the bleeding. Doggie refuses, finally confessing that he is in reality
a girl.  Bian-lian is heartbroken. It is against tradition to train
women in a family art, as only men can perform. Bian-lian tries to
leave Doggie behind, but his groaning love for the child causes him to
keep her on as hired help and not as family. As the relationship
between these two grows both closer and more distant, Doggie takes it
on herself to kidnap a young boy she finds lost in the streets one
day. She presents the boy to his estranged foster grandfather and then
leaves to fend for herself.  Bian-lian is both overjoyed and
heartbroken. He has now gained an heir that he can pass his art onto,
but he has now lost a child that he truly loved. The story takes a
heart rending turn when, finding the young boy, the local officials
arrest Bian-lian and charge him with child slavery and kidnapping of
several missing children (helping the local officials to close these
unsolved cases and maintain their positions in the
government). Bian-lian is sentenced to death until Doggie returns and
with the help of Opera star Luo Sulan, convinces the corrupt officials
to release the old man.</P>
<P>The above plot breakdown does nothing to express the rich, emotional
depth of this film. "King of Mask" does not become maudlin or
syrupy. It's characters capture you with their believability and
depth. This is a film that will challenge the most hardened of
hearts. The performances of Zhu Xu and Zhou Ren-ying are remarkably
fine tuned. Zhou Ren-ying puts in a performance that belays her mere 8
years of age. Her command of her emotions are absolutely
remarkable. We have never seen a child actor this talented and this
believable. Zhu Xu as the aging performer is also astounding. making
us believe in a magical art, long since vanished from our world and
yet remaining steadfastly human, with all of the encompassing
frailties, insecurities, and hope that we could only aspire to.</P>
<P>The script by Wei Ming-lun is wonderfully constructed. Simplistic in
it's set up and effortlessly delivered. This is a story that traverses
national and cultural boundaries.  This is a story of the heart, and
an indictment against a sexist tradition that still lingers in some
parts of the world.</P>
<P>Director Wu Tian-Ming returns to his beloved China after spending 6
years in exile in America on behalf of his political views. His return
to filmmaking is a triumphant success. Images and sounds of such
emotional power linger throughout this film and it is a shame that it
may not get the wide release here in the U.S. it so richly deserves.
"The King of Mask" is a modern classic. A story that will be
remembered years after it is seen.</P>
<P>On a scale of *****, "BIAN LIAN" (The King of Masks) rates a full *****.</P>
