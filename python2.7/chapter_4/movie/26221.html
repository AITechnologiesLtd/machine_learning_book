<P>"Remember the Titans" is a sports film that shares a number of
similarities with "Hoosiers." Both feature well-respected actors and
talented newcomers in stories based on fact. Both showcase fiery coaches
whose jobs are on the line. Both are loaded with picturesque scenery and
stirring music. And both films succeed despite formulaic plotlines that,
on paper, seem impossibly hokey.</P>
<P>The comparisons end there. While "Remember the Titans" is surprisingly
effective, its cheese factor is too high for it to be in the same league
as a gem like "Hoosiers." Still, the production has much to appreciate.</P>
<P>Writer Gregory Allen Howard got the idea for the film after moving from
Los Angeles back to his hometown of Alexandria, Virginia. Living just
outside the Washington D.C. beltway, he noticed something wonderful
about race relations in his city. "It's socially integrated in a way I'd
never seen," he stated. "Movie theaters, restaurants, neighborhoods, I
couldn't understand why. Why here and almost nowhere else? I started
asking around and I kept hearing about this high school football team. I
think it was my barber who first told me about the Titans and these two
coaches. I couldn't imagine that a high school team could so effect an
entire town. Some say they saved the city."</P>
<P>Howard's research brought him to a pair of men who made a difference
(SPOILER ALERT: The following reveals plot points that will surprise no
one). In 1971, the Alexandria school board was forced to integrate an
all-black school with an all-white school. The fireworks begin when Bill
Yoast (Will Patton), head coach of the T.C. Williams High Titans, is
replaced by Herman Boone (Denzel Washington), a coach brought in from
South Carolina. The decision infuriates local fans unable to understand
why a man with seniority, a terrific reputation and a pending spot in
the Hall of Fame would be treated so shabbily.</P>
<P>Yoast refuses to accept a position as an assistant until he learns that
his entire team plans to boycott the season. Grudgingly, he signs on,
determined to support his boys while maintaining a healthy distance from
his successor.</P>
<P>Where Yoast is a laid-back sort, Boone turns out to be a ball of fire.
Taking advantage of the summer, he puts the boys through an intense boot
camp, shouting things like "Football is not fun" and "Football is not a
democracy, it's a dictatorship" to his smoldering team of big, surly
black and white athletes. He forces them to get to know one another, a
process designed to teach the folly of prejudice. Gradually, the
majority comes around and, by the end of summer, the young men bond into
a cohesive group.</P>
<P>Then the school year starts and the team realizes that the town does not
share their newfound sense of unity. Protesters line the streets on
opening day, loudly voicing their fury over bussing. Football players
socializing on weekends with their new friends are met with glares and
insults from classmates repulsed by racial intermixing. Coach Boone gets
a brick chucked through his window.</P>
<P>Can the boys' friendships withstand the overt bigotry? Will Boone and
Yoast make nice? Can Boone save his job by leading the team to a winning
season? Is there anyone who doesn't know the answers to these questions?
(END SPOILER ALERT)</P>
<P>As with any film produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, the man who inflicted
"Armageddon" and "Coyote Ugly" on a world that never did him any harm,
"Remember the Titans" suffers from an overly processed feel. In fact,
there are numerous moments coated with cinematic Velvetta, all melted
and gooey. How do the racially diverse teammates bond? By singing a
golden oldie together, of course. The "let's affirm our relationship by
belting out a Motown tune" syndrome, previously confined to chick
flicks, is now infecting action movies as well. The football team does
three, count 'em, three musical numbers – in a movie about racism! When
the boys aren't singing, an overbearing score oozes over scenes,
determined to make sure we understand exactly how to emotionally
respond.</P>
<P>Nearly as annoying is Hayden Panettiere in the role of Yoast's
precocious 9-year-old kid, Sheryl. One of the reasons the real-life
Yoast participated in this project was to see his daughter, who died of
a heart attack at 34, portrayed on-screen. His sentiment is
understandable, but I wonder if he found Panettiere's stilted
performance a fitting tribute.</P>
<P>Thankfully, the rest of the cast delivers. Denzel Washington is solid,
giving just the right amount of shading to his drill instructor persona.
Will Patton contributes a nicely detailed turn as well, but the real
stars of the film are the boys, particularly Wood Harris as quarterback
Julius "Big Ju" Campbell and Ryan Hurst, who is terrific as team captain
Gerry Bertier.</P>
<P>"Remember the Titans" shines despite its problem areas, thanks to strong
casting and the sincerity of Gregory Allen Howard's screenplay. While
the story ends exactly the way you expect it to end, Howard makes sure
you see that, even at the height of celebration, bigots still stand on
the sidelines. Even Jerry Bruckheimer's melted Velveeta can't cover them
up.</P>
