<PRE>***1/2 (out of 4)</PRE>
<P>I'm sure that at some point in my educational career, I read Jane
Eyre.  But I was glad not to remember much about the plot.  Like
any good romance, especially one where the situation looks
hopeless, I enjoy it more if I'm able to be surprised.  And boy,
did I enjoy this.</P>
<P>Not that surprise is the only good thing about the movie.  It's
just consistent with the rest of what there is to enjoy.  The
acting was wonderful and the characters were very, very human. 
In particular, William Hurt as the tormented Mr. Rochester,
though he stayed true to the formality and precision of speech
of the 1830s, was the kind of man that I would take great
pleasure knowing and verbally jousting with in 1996.  I cared
about what he was going through, which made the climactic fire
scene and the resulting shift in his relationship with Jane an
agonizing  and suspenseful journey on which to travel.</P>
<P>Charlotte Gainsburg as the homely but ethereal Jane was also a
joy to watch unfold.  Her transformation from mistreated
schoolteacher to beloved governess was wary, gradual and
authentic.  With one brief smile from her somber face, she
conveys the transformative joy of a child taking her first
steps.  Her severe gray dresses, tight bun and pale, crooked
lips allowed Hollywood to redefine the term plain, but it
allowed her expressions to shine through that much more clearly
and be her crowning adornment.  I must admit, though, I couldn't
help but think "Hey, you're not poor anymore, babe - get a
makeover!"</P>
<P>Anna Pacquin, the luminous child from "The Piano" plays Jane as
a pre-teen.  Not a kid you'd want to try and match wits with. 
Pacquin carries herself with a grace and dignity that is
queenly, formidable and adult, and with very few words, rips the
pretensions of her elders to shreds.  I'll be looking for her,
in about 10 or 15 years, starring as Hester Prynne in a remake
of "The Scarlet Letter."</P>
<P>My only criticism of "Jane Eyre" is its mid-April release date. 
This is the movie for a rainy, dreary Saturday afternoon, not
for a glorious spring day.  Catch it soon and appreciate its
gentleness, before the sensuality of budding flowers and the
testosterone rush of the summer blockbusters takes hold.</P>
