<PRE>                          PRINCESS CARABOO 1994
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon</PRE>
<P>Cast: Phoebe Cates, Wendy Hughes, Jim Broadbent, Kevin Kline, Stephen
Rea, John Lithgow Director: Michael Austin Screenplay: Michael Austin
and John Wells</P>
<P>"A princess of royal blood Caraboo she. Descended from dynasty upon
dynasty of South Javanese Royalty. Who ruled the waves of the Pacific
Seas; and through evil's twisted fate, our princess be captured by an
evil pirate of no name. Escaped she did, by miracle's untwisted hand and
thrown upon the green shores of Jerusalem (England), that unfriendly
land. Bearing only the clothes she wore, with only a few silver pieces
to spare the poor. So this wretched child of Caraboo our lives plead,
help me, love me, mercy. Not English, nor Spanish or Hindi speak. Who is
this girl full of mystery? She is Princess Caraboo."
 From 'The Forgotten Annals of Rare Princesses'  by T.M.T. Voon.</P>
<P>So the question which is nicely posed to the viewer throughout the movie
is - Is Princess Caraboo, who has been accepted whole heartedly into
England's highest social circles, truly a princess of the bluest blood,
or is she merely the greatest con artist of her time? I'll give you a
clue below.</P>
<P>"Give me a turban, or give me a name. Paint a tattoo on my arse and you
can call me Prince Voondavoodaloo. I speak no English, or so I claim,
but I can say 'Attoya Matoolie Estromish Zardoo', which in my language
means 'God Be With You'. So throw me a party, or show me around. I know
how to have a good time, all I have to do is smile. I am a prince of the
truest blood, or so I claim. I am after all the prince of my heart."
 From 'The Forgettable Annals of Jerky Princes' by T.M.T Voon</P>
<P>As a film directed towards the family audience, I would say this works.
Not a great fan of any film which claims to be a family film, I have to
say that this film isn't bad; and since it brought smiles to my parent's
faces, who give it two thumbs up, I'll refrain from being nasty.</P>
<P>What we have here is a tale of unprecedented imagination. Also a tale of
self-belief. Like 'The Little Princess' which claims that every little
girl is as special as a princess, so 'Caraboo' follows this same message
to the end. For those of you who get a little sensitive over gender
equality and equal opportunities, and since the rec.arts.movies.reviews
seems to be overpopulated by politically conscious males, yes, every
little boy can also be a prince.</P>

0% Princess Diana / *PRINCESS CARABOO* / Sleeping Beauty 100%</P>
