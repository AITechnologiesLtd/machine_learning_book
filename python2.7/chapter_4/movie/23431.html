<P>Several nights ago I was forced to make a decision between attending a
screening of a) Drowning Mona or b) Whatever it Takes. My choice
wouldn't make much difference as I was destined to view both, so I
nonchalantly chose b. In retrospect, I should have opted for c) a warm
bath and a good night's sleep.</P>
<P>Drowning Mona, the third pathetic excuse for a movie from Destination
Films (Bats and Eye of the Beholder), has a very-much recognizable
cast that you expect to deftly guide it through what sounds like a
semi-intriguing plot.  Whatever It Takes, comparatively, comes from
the veteran Columbia pictures and features a bunch of no-names in a
very-much tired plot.</P>
<P>Danny DeVito hunts down the murderer of Verplank, New York's town
shrew in Mona while Shane West seeks a prom date at Gilmore High in
Whatever it Takes.  It has been a while since a who-didn't-do-it has
come along, so Mona certainly had the potential to be refreshingly
amusing. Unfortunately, as the list of Fargonian characters piles up,
it becomes increasingly apparent that the film's payoff cannot make
sense as not a single member of the all-inclusive suspect list has the
intellectual capacity to execute a murder.  I dare even say that the
only people dumber than the citizens of Verplank are the graduating
class of Gilmore High. The characters in Whatever it Takes are so
flagrantly single-dimensional that a quasi-Pleasantville feeling is
created.</P>
<P>Insuring that Drowning Mona dies a worst death than the one described
in its title are Danny DeVito, Casey Affleck, Bette Midler and Neve
Campbell.  DeVito likely won't suffer too badly from picking this film
as he can still be seen in the extraordinary Man on the Moon and has
an extremely respectable career to overshadow this work. Midler, on
the other hand, is fresh off of Isn't She Great (which isn't) and
needs to take a serious look at the current state of her career. It
has been nearly 10 years since the landmark in her vitae when she bid
Carson goodbye and although she continues to do acclaimed live
theatre, her film career seems to have nose-dived since that Memorial
Day weekend. As for Affleck and Campbell, they are both newcomers who
will have to fight to erase memories of Mona, but given their talent
they will likely succeed.</P>
<P>Whatever it Takes features Shane West and Marla Sokoloff as the
resident geeks who attempt to cross-date with the two most popular
kids in school, played by James Franco and Jodi Lyn O'Keefe. Sokoloff,
West and Franco will all likely be destroyed by this
play-it-by-the-convenient-cliché production.  As for O'Keefe, the
only actor with any experience to speak of (except for the always cute
Julia Sweeney in a supporting role), she will likely come away
stereotyped as the teenage bitch until she can no longer stop playing
a teenager, at which point the only line she'll have to remember is "Would
you like fries with that?"</P>
<P>For Mona, the kiss of death comes in a mid-film knife-throwing contest
when the tempestuous character is humanized. The second you feel
remotely bad for the deceased, the film goes from being really awful
to really really awful.  For Whatever it Takes, the unoriginal plot
mixed with the apparent inability to land a singly joke doom the
production for expulsion from the ranks of decent cinema.</P>
<P>Forget a hot bath and good night's sleep. I would have rather bathed
in an Alaskan lake and spent a the night with the Adams Family than
suffered through either of these movies!</P>
