<P>        Demi Moore has had an incredible streak of bad luck lately.
Millions steered clear of her ribald vision of ``The Scarlet Letter''
and her tepid would-be thriller ``The Juror,'' and while her paycheck
for ``Striptease'' made her the Twelve Million Dollar Woman, her
performance made her the butt of a lot of scalding jokes.</P>
<P>  But Demi is eager to repent, and she's willing to give her
blood, sweat and tears - quite literally - for one more
chance. ``G.I. Jane'' offers her the opportunity to do all that and
more: She even sheds her hair in an amazing on-camera head-shaving,
sure to be one of the year's most talked-about movie moments.</P>
<P>  ``G.I. Jane'' casts Moore as Jordan O'Neil, an intelligence
officer who becomes the first woman to train as a Navy Seal. The title
refers to a nickname applied to O'Neil by the press as she undergoes a
grueling regimen that includes pushing tanks up sand hills in Sisyphus
fashion, being tortured in a simulated prison camp, and digging her
dinner out of a garbage can.</P>
<P>  Dramatically, the picture is strictly by-the-book, and
occasionally it teeters on the brink of self-parody, as stogie-gnawing
officers plot against human dynamo Jordan. But, like the similarly
over-the-top ``Face/Off,'' ``G.I. Jane'' has been directed with such
finesse and infused with so much star power the movie works, almost in
spite of itself.</P>
<P>  Director Ridley Scott (``Alien,'' ``Blade Runner'') lends
his customary striking visual sense to the proceedings: Even when
Jordan is battered and bleeding in the rain, Scott makes her look like
a portrait of gutsiness rather than a victimized mess. Scott's imagery
is beautifully underscored by sterling new songs from the Pretenders,
and it's typical of the film's canniness that Jordan's private moments
of self-doubt are accompanied by music from rock 'n' roll survivor
Chryssie Hynde, who could probably tell Jordan a thing or two about
trying to carve out your niche in a man's world.</P>
<P>  Moore's typically prickly demeanor, often cited by her
detractors as her biggest liability as an actress, actually works to
her advantage here, as she unearths the voracious ambition in Jordan's
soul. It's easy to see this role as a mirror image of the actress
herself, a similarly driven woman who's said to work out several hours
a day. If you don't believe those reports, check out the frightening
ease with which Moore executes one-armed push-ups and suspended
sit-ups.</P>
<P>  The screenplay by David Twohy and Danielle Alexandra makes
Jordan into a kind of Everywoman that's difficult not to root
for. Jordan's habit of boldly standing up to her superiors may not be
credible, but it gives the audience several opportunities to cheer her
on as she challenges sadistic Master Chief Urgayle (Viggo Mortensen)
and a manipulative Texas politico (a campy Anne Bancroft) who betrays
her.</P>
<P>  Even as the film turns into an action extravaganza in the
final stretch, Scott keeps his heroine solidly in the
forefront. ``G.I. Jane'' is first and foremost a star vehicle and,
thanks to Moore's astounding chutzpah, it's an entertaining one.</P>
