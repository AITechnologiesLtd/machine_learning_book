<P>Readers who make a beeline for the ratings of reviews, please note that 
from a filmic point of view "Tin Cup" rates two stars but for golf 
enthusiasts three. Average: two-and-a-half.</P>
<P>Writer-director Ron Shelton's credentials are first-rate. He is a former 
minor league baseball player who knows his sports and their milieu.  He 
brings to his sports movies technical interest, human interest, humor and 
very good characterizations. He made  "Bull Durham" (with Costner), 
"White Men Can't Jump," "Blue Chips," the underrated "Cobb,"  the wildly 
amusing "The Best of Times,"(script) as well as two excellent but also 
somewhat underrated political films :"Under Fire" (writer, second unit 
director) and "Blaze."</P>
<P>"Tin Cup" is about  Roy "Tin Cup" McAvoy (Costner), the golf pro of a 
driving range in Salome, in West Texas. To call the place seedy, shabby 
or threadbare would be a compliment. Roy, a former golf champion at the 
University of Houston, has fallen into bad times because of his eccentric 
and extreme risk-taking in golf. Now he lives at the range in a decrepit 
Winnebago --outside of which is a child's plastic pool called "The Spa"--
with his friend-mentor-caddy Romeo (Cheech Marin). Roy is surrounded by a 
small coterie of boozing good ole' boys, whose own means of support are 
by and large mysterious.</P>
<P>It's a colorful, Tobacco Road-like setup, but this overlong movie's 
sluggish tempo did make me look at my watch more than once. Another debit 
is that  excessive picturesqueness strains credibility, especially as Roy 
seems to be entirely client-less. Who pays for the gas, beer and 
doughnuts? Until, that is, a Junoesque blonde shows up.  She is Molly 
Griswold (ex-supermodel Rene Russo), no, change this to Doctor Griswold, 
as Molly holds a degree in psycho-something. By coincidence, she's the 
new shrink in Selena. As things develop, especially in a later scene (one 
of the film's best) when she blurts out her own imperfections, she's a 
lousy shrink. By comparison, Ann Landers deserves a Pulitzer Prize in 
counseling.</P>
<P>Molly wants instruction to impress her boyfriend David Simms (Johnson), a 
rising-star pro golfer. By coincidence, David was Roy's colleague and 
competitor at the University of Houston, and apparently a man unburdened 
by ethics. By coincidence, David shows up at the range. Slick and 
self-possessed, he briefly reminisces to Roy about the school and the 
days "where we won all them titles together." The University must have 
done more good to David's golf than to his grammar.</P>
<P>He offers a job to Roy who thinks is as a player but  turns out to be  as 
a caddy. Thereby hang complications and escalations  leading to Roy 
playing in the U.S. Open. They also lead to the inevitable Roy-Molly 
affair, a weak side of the movie. The initial rapprochement is too cute 
and, like much else in the film, exaggerated. The contrast between 
unkempt Roy and perfectly groomed Molly in blindingly virginal white -- 
the stuff Hollywood movies love-- is all the more unlikely since even 
being way downwind from Roy must be an experience in redolence.</P>
<P>On the other hand, on a 1 to 10 scale of expressivity, Costner rates a 5,  
Russo a 2, so they are pretty well matched. They are also matched in age 
(both over 40), in brains (simplistic), in accents (vague). The 
intonations are certainly not Texan. (Both actors and the director are 
South Californians). Molly and Roy are, however, preciously mismatched in 
verbal expression. She is a no-nonsense pragmatist. He is a philosopher 
and mystic who delivers poetic paeans that sound like "Zen and the Art of 
Golfing."</P>
<P>"Tin Cup" is not free from cliches, but the culmination is a good, 
non-Hollywoodian twist. Predictably, it is at the U.S. Open where the big 
duel between Roy and David takes place. The Open is beautifully 
reproduced, edited and photographed, a dead ringer of the real thing, 
including genuine players and network sportscasters. </P>
<P>There are a few surprises, yet on the whole the Roy-David contrast is 
unconvincing. Roy is a cuckoo idealist, while David, co-opted by society, 
plays not only the game of golf but The Game. But while supposed to be a 
sneaky meanie, he is not unlikable. Around mid-film, Roy challenges 
David, bets his old Cadillac convertible (Caddies for Caddies?), loses. 
Yet  within hours Molly delivers the chariot to Roy saying that David 
(who drives his own fancy ragtop) "has no use for it." It would seem that 
a true villain would love to deprive Roy of his wheels. </P>
<P>Director Shelton can be very good with supporting characters. First prize 
here goes to Cheech Marin in an original, funny-warm role, cleverly 
exploited. Second prize to Linda Hart as a tough-but-sweet owner of the 
golf range, owner-performer of a thriving strip-joint and ex-amour of 
Roy's. No role however, major or minor, is really developed.</P>
<P>Rene Russo is a tentatively original creation. She is also a problem for 
my spell-checker. It insists that her given name should be "Renee," since 
with just one "e" it is a man's name. True, there is something masculine 
about her face as the camera annoyingly persists in showing it in 
close-up, which stresses a certain lack of charisma. The excess of 
adoring Costner close-ups compounds the trouble. So the best way to watch 
"Tin Cup" is not as a sports-plus-love story, but as a plain sports movie 
with some novelties.</P>
