<P> "Ernest Hemingway once wrote, "The world is a fine place and worth
fighting for." I agree with the second part."</P>
<P>Starring Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey. Rated
R.</P>
<P>*NOTE: This review contains SPOILERS</P>
<P>Four years after its release, some fans and critics are putting David
Fincher's Se7en at the top of their lists for best/scariest movies of
all time. I maintain that its just another serial killer movie, albeit a
well-made one. It's certainly unnerving -- gory and sometimes
frightening -- but it's also fairly standard, even predictable.</P>
<P>Retiring Detective William Somerset (a stone-faced Morgan Freeman) is
given one last assignment: the bizarre murder of a grossly obese man. He
is joined by David Mills (Brad Pitt) an inexperienced, young, obscenity-
sputtering gumshoe who doesn't seem to know how to do anything other
than demand a little respect. After another murder is committed,
Somerset and Mills realize that this killer is murdering people that
exemplify one of the seven deadly sins (namely gluttony, sloth, greed,
lust, envy, wrath or pride).</P>
<P>Seven sins most likely means seven planned murders, so Mills and
Somerset are off to try and stop the perverse killer before he does more
dirty deeds. Inevitably they fail because more gruesome killings are
uncovered, but the killer (a riveting Kevin Spacey) comes to them and
wants to lead them to the final two bodies.</P>
<P>David Fincher (Alien 3, The Game) is impressively adept at building
tension. This is an exciting movie: suspenseful and intense, with
scarcely a hiatus. The way the murders are committed is effectively
shocking (although I couldn't help but think that Fincher staged them
for shock value alone) and the images linger in your mind long after the
movie is over. For pure, unadulterated visceral thrill, there is little
beating Se7en.</P>
<P>But if a movie is only as good as its villain then Se7en is kinda
"blah". Kevin Spacey does his best to make him frightening but never
succeeds in being much more than obnoxious. His "John Doe" is no
Hannibal Lecter and thus the revelation of the killer's identity proves
anticlimactic.</P>
<P>All the acclaim that Se7en has received borders on undeserved. I liked
the movie well enough but I fail to see what people find so
extraordinary about it. It's a solid, suspenseful, exciting thriller
that entertains mightily, but it has no life message nor is it a
particularly meaningful parable about the world we live in. This is one
movie where the best thing to do is watch, rather than think.
