<PRE>                              THE NUN'S STORY
                       A film review by Ralph Benner
                        Copyright 1996 Ralph Benner</PRE>
<P>        THE NUN'S STORY is Audrey Hepburn's one genuine triumph as 
actress. You never get passed that it's Hepburn as Sister Luke, but you 
never not accept her either; she could be playing the first "recovering" 
Catholic, of which there are now millions. You don't really need to be a 
Catholic to recognize that Sister Luke had to rebel the way she did, but 
it helps. Fred Zinnemann has made from Kathryn Hulme's best seller a movie 
that puts some sting into Catholic-slanted tests aimed at destroying 
pride. </P>
<P>        Hepburn's portrayal of Hulme starts out with naive hopes for a 
vocation in nursing but she soon discovers that she's made to pay the 
price for her advantages -- having come from a father renowned in the 
field of medicine -- and she has to be humbled into obedience by her 
order's hierarchy which decrees that no single star shine more than the 
collective mission of the Church. (This before the days of Sister Teresa 
and Mother Angelica.) Hepburn accepts the subservience at first, trying 
hopelessly to gain false humility and bow to compliance. Soon enough it 
becomes too much to endure: she can't fulfill vows that subjugate personal 
worth; her "I accuse myself" notebook of culpas fills up fast. Then she's 
asked as test of  "humility without hooks" to fail her medical exams to 
appease a jealous, incompetent nun. At this critical juncture, Hepburn's 
decision -- a clerical lese majeste -- is sparked by several converging 
factors: her own ego and expertise, her father's reputation, and, though 
never overtly expressed, her fears that anything less than her personal 
best would be giving in to demands made by a nun who sees no damage in 
stifling potential for the sake of rules and regulations that border on 
infantilism. (Hulme never explicitly condemned this in her book, either, 
but she very powerfully suggested it.)</P>
<P>        Hepburn's success in the part is based partly on downplaying the 
Givenchy image. She doesn't have any fall back positions to rest on, like 
those svelty, classy "gamine" qualities people go gaga over; even the 
inimitable Audrey smile has been downsized so as not to fall too deeply in 
love with her. (But like Peter Finch's Dr. Fortunati, we all do anyway.) 
The real strength of the performance, though, is that it's all in the 
face: showcased in helpful habits, Hepburn has to emote from within and 
bring it all out through her eyes and voice. Her Sister Luke is amongst 
the best things going for the Congo -- and Catholicism -- but she's made 
an unwilling victim of her own intelligence and success. The pride and 
vulnerability and mounting irritations with her situations and dilemmas 
are all right there to be empathized with  -- especially by conflicted 
hearts of Catholics who see the Church today as a collapsing haven for 
totalitarians and pedophiles, not the promise of ecumenical charity. 
There's a painful understanding of regret mixed with relief when watching 
Sister Luke shed her religious garb and reenter the secular world; the 
very kingdom of goodwill became an isolation ward of perversity she had to 
escape. Yet a ward she committed herself to by making an unsuitable 
choice. </P>
<P>        Zinnemann's THE NUN'S STORY and Otto Preminger's THE CARDINAL 
could be defended as companion pieces: Catholicism the central theme and 
target, with both handling very respectfully their criticisms; both are 
episodic in format, with travelogue-like transitions between periods; both 
have solid supporting work by some very fine actors who know what to do 
with Catholic Churchspeak -- that intoned, arched lingo as reverential 
superiority. Catholics world-wide who were educated by nuns have it in 
their systems like a virus, and performers almost always have the greatest 
time getting infected by it, as Edith Evans, Peggy Ashcroft and Mildred 
Dunnock confirm in THE NUN'S STORY and as Burgess Meredith, Joseph Meinrad 
and especially John Huston do in THE CARDINAL. The one crucial difference 
between the movies is the central star: Hepburn has been lovingly coached 
by Zinnemann, and you can see how it blooms in just about every detail of 
her performance, but Tom Tyron as the Cardinal has been browbeaten by 
Preminger -- he's been humiliated into submission, into what some of the 
nuns wanted to make of Sister Luke. The director's tirades against Tyron 
are well-documented and you can see the affects in just about every detail 
of his performance. It's tormenting to watch him in some scenes -- you can 
feel his real agony; his pocky facial scar could be stigmata. (And you 
wonder about Tyron's quota for abuse: he worked with Preminger a few years 
later in the black & white IN HARM'S WAY.) A decent print of THE CARDINAL 
is hard to come by, so it's time for it to be restored, not as a sterling 
example of movie making -- though Otto won a Papal medal for it -- but as 
a general view of the conflicts caused by celibates in expensive robes 
who, with presumed carnal-free experience in matters of sex and marriage, 
oughtn't be advising anyone about such matters. (And Australia's "Brides 
of Christ" would tackle the Church's positions on birth control and the 
Vietnam War.) </P>
<P>        That's fundamental to the on-going subversive pleasure of movies 
about Catholicism: its extraordinary grandeur, panoply, artistry and 
seething sensuality contradict more than augment its catechism. It's the 
only religion that asks its adherents to defy the enjoyment of all its 
built-in sensations. THE NUN'S STORY isn't exactly about sensations, 
except for Hepburn's performance and Finch's handling of her. But they're 
not the sole reasons the movie, which doesn't lose much on TV, is a 
classic. A friend once wrote that "getting hooked on Zinnemann's method of 
movie making is similar to getting hooked on actor George Montgomery's 
carpentry -- you get high on their craftsmanship."  </P>
