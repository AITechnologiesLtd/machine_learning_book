<P>IN SHORT: Fall's first popcorn flick. (and only two weeks early . . .)</P>
<P>So... Cranky mingles with the crowd filing in to see a sneak of Blue
Streak but he's stopped at the door by a press rep demanding... "Do you
need notes?" Has demographic targeting gone so far that a pale guy can't
enjoy a Martin Lawrence flick? Or is it that, after five years of
running the preview route, these guys have finally figured out that I'm
in this end of the biz for the long run? I'll choose the latter, 'cuz
Blue Streak is a decent comedy popcorn flick and good comedy knows no
racial barrier. To put it another way, Blue Streak's script lingo
doesn't drown you in street talk and the music to talk ratio is
remarkably low, so anyone in fear of rap music or slang need not fear.</P>
<P>Here's what I consider interesting. The reviewers who saw Blue Streak
long before me are busy making comparisons to black comedians whose
shadows dominate the field. There's a longer, and sadly long forgotten
shadow that Blue Streak's comedy is closer to, and those are the films
of Jerry Lewis, the guy who does the MDA telethon every year. Those
flicks went like this: Ordinary guy has to go to extraordinary lengths,
usually involving outrageous disguises and impersonations to obtain a
goal. That goal was usually a date with a girl -- it was the 50's.
Considering what Lewis' stock character was, getting a date was almost
as implausible as finding the Holy Grail.</P>
<P>In Blue Streak, ordinary guy Miles Logan (Lawrence) has to go to
extraordinary lengths, including one outrageous costume and one major
impersonation to obtain his heart's desire. This being the 90s, Lawrence
is a hi-tech jewelry burglar who gets double crossed by one of his crew,
and is forced to stash a stolen diamond worth $17 millions inside a
building under construction. When Miles goes to retrieve the loot after
a two year prison term, he discovers that the building houses the 37th
Precinct of the LAPD. To get into the building, he tries to sneak into
the building as a pizza delivery man, complete with Lewis style glasses,
buck teeth and dead on Lewish shtick. It's too obvious to be anything
but an homage, which is why I've spent so much time on the comparison.
That attempt fails, so the only logical next step is to impersonate a
cop.</P>
<P>Which, of course, he does brilliantly, having spent many man hours
watching COPS. Yeah, I've blabbed a gag. The shtick which comes before
and after is plentiful, so nothing's been ruined. The supporting cast,
including Peter Greene and Dave Chapelle as the rest of the burglary
crew, Luke Wilson as the traffic cop turned detective and William
Forsythe as top cop is strong and though there is one point where the
needs of the story force an unbelievable coincidence to occur, Blue
Streak provides a fun time.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Blue Streak, he would have paid...</P>
<PRE>$5.00</PRE>
<P>Dateflick level. Buy the big popcorn and settle in.</P>
