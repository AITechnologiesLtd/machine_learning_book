Bosnia/France 1994</PRE>
<P>     It's hard to approach the good and bad in this film without being
caught up a discussion of the message of BOSNA!, for this is a film
that explicitly sets out to convert its audience to its side, to make
people aware of the war and to try to influence them to pressure their
governments to intervene.  It's a film that's very aware of itself, of
the process of its making and of the influence it might have: for
example, Mitterand's visit to Bosnia is portrayed as an outcome of
information given to the French President by the director,
Bernard-Henri Levy.</P>
<P>     The film is full of very disturbing images: a mother and child
fleeing from snipers in Sarajevo; bodies littering a street after a
shell has landed on a bread queue, many of them with legs or faces
blown off; starving prisoners staring at the camera through the barbed
wire of a concentration camp.  It's impossible not to be moved by the
suffering of these people, and difficult not to feel anger at the
inaction of the diplomats who do little but talk while people are
fighting for their lives and homes.  The film makes much of comparisons
between Western indifference to Bosnia today and Western indifference
to Czechoslovakia and the Spanish Republic in the 1930s.  There is,
suggests Levy, the same denial, the same explanations that it's all
much too complex to get involved in.  In 1945 people saw pictures of
the concentration camps in Poland and said "never again", but now that
the camps are back it seems that we would rather deny them, or suggest
that there's fault on both sides, then determine to stop the
atrocities.</P>
<P>     If there is anything I don't like about BOSNA!, it is the
incessant wordiness of the voice-over.  Perhaps Levy was so anxious to
persuade that he didn't dare to let the audience come to their own
conclusions.  At times sounding like a Biblical prophet, at times
hectoring us, at times reflecting on how the war affects our image of
ourselves as Europeans, the narration never lets the eloquent pictures
speak for themselves, pictures that have more than enough power to move
and to persuade on their own.</P>

<P>     Cambridge Arts Cinema hosted the British premiere of BOSNA!, a
powerful and disturbing film about the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and
about the reluctance of governments in Western Europe to acknowledge
what was going on and their refusal to offer real assistance to
Bosnia.  Director Bernard-Henri Levy gave a short talk before the
film.  He said that the BOSNA!, filmed in Sarajevo between September
1993 and January 1994, and in other parts of Bosnia in March and April
of this year, was neither a dispassionate documentary nor an artistic
film; but was the answer to the question "What can I do to help these
people, to make their heroic struggle known?"  He wanted the film to be
as militant and passionate as possible without being inaccurate in its
presentation of the facts.</P>
<P>     A question and answer session followed the film, chaired by
Leonard Doyle of "The Independent."  The questioners mostly expressed
positive opinions of the films and asked Levy about the relationship
between his film and a wider historical context.  The film made much of
the comparisons between the West s failure to intervene in Bosnia and
its failure to take a stand over Czechoslovakia and Spain in the 1930s,
but what about the many conflicts within and between other ex-communist
states, such as Armenia and Azerbaijan?  Levy said that his own memory
and family history was concerned with World War Two, and so that was
where he turned more naturally.  He also wanted to try to convince
people in England that they should come to the aid of Bosnia as they
had come to the aid of France.  He suggested that the West wasn't doing
enough to help the post-communist states towards democracy, and that we
risked the creation of monsters from the volatile mixture of fascism,
nationalism and communism in these countries.</P>
<P>     One questioner suggested that the reluctance of the West to become
involved was out of a fear of Islamic fundamentalism in what the media
portray as a predominately Muslim state.  Levy agreed, and said that
this was an inaccurate view of Bosnia.  Sarajevo had been a "second
Jerusalem," a city in which sizable communities of Jews, Christians
and Muslims lived and worshiped in peace.  Levy described a meeting
with Bosian President Izetbegovic at the world premiere of BOSNA! in
early June.  Izetbegovic said that he had always refused a
fundamentalist Islamic state, but if the West were to stand back and
lets the country be partitioned along ethnic lines, then Bosnia may
have to become one.</P>
<P>     One questioner disagreed.  He said that the conflict in Bosnia was
much more complex than the film suggested, and that it was a mistake
not to examine the origins of the present conflict in World War Two, in
which the Serbians resisted fascism while Muslims were recruited into
the German army.  Levy responded passionately.  He said that being
right in 1945 didn't make the Serbians right now; even if their
grandparents had fought Hitler, that didn t excuse concentration camps
and ethnic cleansing.</P>
<P>     Bernard-Henri Levy made a very positive impression on me; he
seemed full of respect for the Bosnians he had met and spoken with and
filmed, and full of energy and passion to tell their story to the
world.</P>
