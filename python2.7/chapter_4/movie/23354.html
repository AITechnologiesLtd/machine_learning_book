<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A metaphysical love fantasy film by the New Zealand director Vincent
Ward (The Navigator/Map of the Human Heart). The most important question
this film seems to ask, Is how could one take Robin Williams seriously?
Answer: You can't! It's strictly a film overloaded with cornball and
tripe scenes; a film that starts out with breathtaking visuals, with the
possibility that we are moving into the special territory of the
imagination, but it soon turns into a conventional Hollywood tearjerker.
It does this without the benefit of good acting, a meaningful story, or
pertinent dialogue- all that's diverting is some hokum about heaven and
hell, plus some beautiful photography of paintings ranging from Caspar
David Friedrich to Renoir to Salvador Dali. The film, to its most
assured benefit, was magnificently shot in the splendor of Montana's
Glacial Forest, giving it a tremendous visual appeal.</P>
<P>It was shot from a religious non-denominational basis, but does a
disservice to all religions by being inaccurate about what it sells for
religious belief. It explores no deep metaphysical themes, develops no
characters, asks no real hard questions, it only seems to be made for
materialists, those who are so enamored by the 'New Age' of materialism,
that this film holds out hope for them that they can live forever and
reunite with their loved ones in heaven.</P>
<P>God's name comes up once. Robin Williams asks his guide Albert (Cuba
Gooding) when he is dead: "Where is God?" Cuba answers: "He's up there
somewhere." You can see for yourself how heavy the dialogue is. But, at
least, it did clear up where God was.</P>
<P>The mushy plot is about a perfect couple, Dr. Chris Nielsen (Robin) and
Ann (Annabella). She's an artist and an art restorer, who works for a
museum. They meet when their boats collide on a Swiss lake, and it was
love at first sight for these soul mates. They are happily married with
a boy and a girl, but tragedy hits when their kids die in an auto crash.
She feels guilty that she wasn't driving and has a breakdown, even
seeing a "shrink." But, through Chris' total devotion to her, she has
fully recovered.</P>
<P>Four years later Chris is on a rainy highway when a car crashes into the
pediatrician while he is trying to help some others in a car crash. His
wife is despondent that she lost all her loved ones in auto accidents,
so she commits suicide.</P>
<P>What the film tries to do is imagine the unknown. When Chris first
arrives in heaven, he finds himself inside one of Annie's romantic
paintings. After making his way in a gorgeous flower bed, he finds
himself covered with paint, as though he had landed on a piece of art
that still hadn't dried. Cuba Gooding is his angel guide. He gives us
the real deal as to what is going on in heaven, like telling us "Thought
is Real." "The Physical is the Illusion." He also lets us know, that
Heaven, means becoming who you want to be. I could have done without his
expertise in these matters. I could have also done without him in the
film; he was about as miscast as Robin Williams was.</P>
<P>Since Chris' wife is a suicide, she is assigned to hell. The Tracker
(Max von Sydow) tells us, "Hell is for those who don't know they're
dead.'' To get there and take Annie back with him to heaven, Chris
enlists the Tracker's help. Hell is seen as an eternal sea of doomed
human heads, twisted metal objects, and gloomy brownish colors.</P>
<P>The chatter about the afterworld is nonsensical psychological babble.
The story is played with such misplaced conviction, that this
emotionless story was not only devoid of reason and intellectual acuity,
but was an embarrassment in every other possible way. For a film that
was so stylishly lush to look at, it had little else to offer. I sort of
liked Ann's line when in hell: "Sometimes you lose when you win." I
think you'll probably lose when you see this clinker. I wasted some
precious earth time viewing what passes for the film's banal concepts of
heaven and hell. There was just nothing real about this film, or
anything to learn from it, or anything I felt about it, except
irritated.</P>
