<PRE>RULES OF ENGAGEMENT
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Entertaining balderdash, RULES OF ENGAGEMENT, by director William
Friedkin (THE FRENCH CONNECTION and TO LIVE AND DIE IN L.A.), is the
best bad movie this year.  (Okay, I admit it, the year is still young.)
With a jingoistic plot that's borderline parody, the movie is likely to
elicit unintentional laughter from its audiences.  Still, no matter how
ridiculous Stephen Gaghan's script becomes, the director keeps the
action fast-paced enough that it keeps you involved in the intrigue.</P>
<P>Among the movie's long laundry list of problems is the miscasting of
some of the key leads.  Guy Pearce comes across way too slimy as the
prosecutor, and Tommy Lee Jones should never have been chosen to play a
quiet, sympathetic loser -- an alcoholic who lacks confidence in
himself.  If you pay the big bucks for Jones, don't rein him in with
such a constraining part.</P>
<P>But, the picture remains as riveting as it is infuriating.  Characters
make stupid mistakes, usually for no discernable reasons.  Nevertheless,
Friedkin manages to make an interesting movie.  It's a film that will
engross you while you're there but will fall apart in your mind as you
begin to think about it later.</P>
<P>James Webb's story concerns a rescue mission gone bad.  When the
American Embassy in Yemen is attacked, three helicopters of American
Marines are sent in under the command of Colonel Terry L. Childers
(Samuel L. Jackson).  When the troops arrive, they find the Ambassador
(Ben Kingsley) and his wife (Anne Archer) frightened out of their minds.
With conspicuous bravery and courage, Col. Childers saves the family and
his country's flag.</P>
<P>Up until this point in the picture, the tension is palpable.  When the
helicopters are shown on their way in, your adrenaline will pump right
along with that of the young troops.</P>
<P>After losing three of his men and with others wounded, Col. Childers
decides that they must return fire.  Believing that he sees the gunfire
coming from the crowd, he orders his troops to fire on the men, women
and children.  The net result of this is that the other side stops
firing, but it creates an international incident since almost a hundred
people die.  When the Yemens clear the courtyard they claim to have
found no weapons whatsoever.  They say that the crowd was peaceful and
that the Marines should have fired only on the rooftop snipers.</P>
<P>After an unshown investigation, Col. Childers is ordered to be
court-martialed.  In another of the story's illogical aspects, he is
given only eight days after he is charged before his trial begins.
Apparently he hasn't been taking the case very seriously since he hasn't
even retained a lawyer.  When forced to find one, he goes for a friend.</P>
<P>For his attorney, Col. Childers turns to his old buddy from Vietnam,
Colonel Hayes Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones), a recently retired soldier.
Col. Hodges, who graduated 67th in his law school class has lost as many
cases as he has won, so the prosecution is elated by the choice.  "I'm a
good enough lawyer to know that you need a better lawyer than me," Col.
Hodges warns his old buddy, who dismisses the advice.</P>
<P>Bruce Greenwood plays William Sokal, a duplicitous National Security
Advisor who destroys evidence and intimidates a witness in order to
ensure that Col. Childers is made the scapegoat that the government
needs.  Like so many of the other characters in this hackneyed script,
you've seen someone like Sokal in a hundred other movies.</P>
<P>There is a scene just after the verdict is rendered that will have
everyone in the audience thinking, "no way!"  To be fair, though, the
movie is almost as much fun as it is ludicrous. Almost.</P>
<P>RULES OF ENGAGEMENT runs 2:07.  It is rated R for war violence and
language and would be acceptable for teenagers.</P>
