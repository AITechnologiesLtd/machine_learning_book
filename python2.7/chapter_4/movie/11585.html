<P>     Just so there's no confusion:  Jack Stanton (John Travolta), the
"fictional" scandal-plagued Democratic presidential candidate whose
campaign is the subject of PRIMARY COLORS, is Bill Clinton.  His ambitious
wife Susan (Emma Thompson) is our First Lady.  Stanton's home-state buddy
and campaign strategist Richard Jemmons (Billy Bob Thornton) is James
Carville.  The waffling, never-seen Italian-American governor of New York,
called Orlando Ozzio here, is Mario Cuomo.  And for that matter, the
"Anonymous" author of the best-selling novel on which PRIMARY COLORS is
based is actually former "Newsweek" writer Joe Klein.</P>
<P>     It's ironic that Klein could tell a story about the effect of
scandal-mongering on American politics only by creating a bit of scandal
himself, that he could uncover a few brutal truths only by hiding a few.
It's even more ironic that the film version of PRIMARY COLORS appears just
as President Clinton finds himself entangled in new scandals, virtually
guaranteeing that most coverage of the film will both miss the point
entirely and help make the film's point for it.  PRIMARY COLORS isn't
simply a chance to giggle at Clinton's foibles without naming him.  This
is a story about giggling at foibles masquerading as serious news, about a
political process which has become a seemingly endless cycle of
mud-slinging and spin control because we continue to create an audience
for it.</P>
<P>     In that sense, it's a very similar story to the recent WAG THE DOG,
though simultaneously more human and more cynical.  PRIMARY COLORS unfolds
through the eyes of Henry Burton (Adrian Lester), an up-and-coming
campaign pro desperately seeking a candidate worthy of his admiration.
Burton begins to develop what Jemmons calls "True Believer-ism" as
Stanton's campaign progresses, convinced that this is a candidate with
vision and a genuine desire to help others.  As revelation builds upon
revelation, however, the questions he has to ask himself grow ever more
troubling.  Does it matter that this man who wants to do so much for the
country seems to be doing it one woman at a time?  Do the ends of getting
into office where you can do some good justify the means of slinging even
more mud at the opponent than he slings at you?  And how can you make
ideas worth anything in a culture where viewers watch an interview with
the Stantons and can only comment that Susan "should wear her hair
longer."</P>
<P>     PRIMARY COLORS the movie manages to wrap all of the novel's tough
questions and roman-a-clef characters into a surprisingly funny and
entertaining package.  Though the running time of nearly 2-1/2 hours feels
excessive near the end, director Mike Nichols crafts so many sharp comic
scenes that the film never becomes a tedious political science lecture.
He also gets one particularly dynamic performance from a generally solid
cast -- Kathy Bates as Libby, the Stanton's borderline-loony long-time
friend and the campaign's designated "Dust-Buster" (because she's "tougher
than dirt").  Though the role initially seems like just a minor variation
on Bates' brassy, no-nonsense characters in DOLORES CLAIBORNE, THE LATE
SHIFT or TITANIC, Libby eventually develops into the real soul of PRIMARY
COLORS:  the last true idealist, a woman whose very sanity depends on the
notion that there has to be a better way to select those who will lead us.</P>
<P>     Of course, another performance will draw far more attention, which is
precisely why PRIMARY COLORS couldn't possibly work as well on film as it
does on the page.  Without a face, Jack Stanton is a complex and
sympathetic character study representing a wide-spread problem.  The
moment John Travolta appears on screen with his salt-and-pepper pompadour,
the titters begin; the moment he opens his mouth and begins his sandpaper
drawl of a Clinton impression, the full-fledged laughs begin.  As
effective as Elaine May's script may be -- and Travolta's performance, for
that matter -- plenty of viewers will simply gape at PRIMARY COLORS in
tabloid fascination, thinking of it as THE BILL CLINTON STORY.  There's a
sad lesson behind the laughs in PRIMARY COLORS, one you'll be able to spot
in reviews and reactions colored by the lenses of Intern-Gate, Grope-Gate,
or any other Gate:  we're getting exactly the leaders we deserve when we
refuse to make their messages matter, and all we can do is throw up an
endless series of Gates in front of them.</P>
