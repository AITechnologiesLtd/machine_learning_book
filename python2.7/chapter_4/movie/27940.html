<PRE>"Enemy at the Gate"</PRE>
<P>In 1942 and '43, during the bloody battle of Stalingrad, a new kind of hero
arose from the ranks of the Soviet army. Vassily Zaitzev (Jude Law), a
simple shepherd from the Urals, is thrust into the limelight when he guns
down five Nazi officers, from a distance, with just five shots. As he
continues to rack up kills against the German invaders, a master sniper is
sent by Hitler to kill the young hero in "Enemy at the Gates."</P>
<P>Jean-Jacques Annaud directs this epic-scale story of the private war that
takes place between Vassily and German sniper par excellent, Major Konig
(Ed Harris), with the murderous battle for Stalin's namesake city as its
backdrop. Jude Law stars as the young Red Army soldier whose shooting
skills come under the scrutiny of Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), a political
commissar who sees Vassily's enemy-killing potential as a morale booster
for the beleaguered Russian troops.</P>
<P>As Vassily's reputation for killing Nazi officers rises on both sides, the
Germans send their own expert marksman, Konig, to Stalingrad to gun down
the young Russian hero. This begins a battle of wits in a cat-and-mouse
game as the hunters, themselves, become the hunted. As the war rages on
between the two great armies, Zaitzev and Konig each try to best the other.
Danilov uses this personal fight as a propaganda tool to elevate Vassily to
hero status in the eyes of the Russian people, soldiers and civilians
alike.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, both Vassily and Danilov are attracted to a beautiful
American-educated Russian woman, Tania (Rachel Weisz), and a love triangle
begins. This is where "Enemy at the Gates" runs into trouble ? the battle
of the snipers takes a back seat to the love story and the film suffers for
the change of focus.</P>
<P>Director Annaud and cowriter Alain Godard use the real-life story of
Vassily Zaitsez as the basis of their tale. The duel of the snipers,
Vassily's rise to hero of the Soviet Union, and Tania's presence during the
private war are all based on fact. The scripters, in their research of
facts and legends, take liberties with the true-life yarn, introducing the
conflict between Vassily and Danilov in their pursuit of the beautiful
Tania. This tangent takes the focus away, considerable, from the taut
battle between the Zaitzev and Konig.</P>
<P>Where "Enemy at the Gates" excels is in the depth and breadth of the
battlefield production. The film begins with an old-fashioned map of Europe
where, suddenly, the Nazi blight spreads across the face of the continent
with the roving camera eye closing in on Stalingrad! With that, we're
thrust into the war from the point of view of young recruit Vassily. He and
his comrades must cross the Volga River through a murderous barrage of
bullets and bombs to reach the front. These untrained conscripts are
prodded kicked, even shot by the political commissars to get them to fight.
These action sequences, especially the battle itself, is stunning in its
depiction of the savagery of war.</P>
<P>The casting and acting, for the most part, is serviceable, but without
distinction - with a couple of exceptions. Ed Harris gives an expected
excellent performance as the aristocrat hunter turned sniper master sent to
stalk and kill Vassily. He carries himself with the assured air of a man of
means and stature, used to having the best in all things. Harris
neutralizes his American accent, giving it a slight Teutonic clip in
keeping with his character. The rest of the cast doesn't make such an
effort so we get an odd mix of mostly British accents from the rest.</P>
<P>Notable among the cast is young Gabriel Thomson as little Sasha, a Russian
kid who becomes a pawn in the battle of wits between Konig and Vassily.
When he gazes at Vassily with a look of admiration, he almost glows. The
relationship that develops between Sasha and Konig, as the boy plays double
agent for Danilov, is palpable. It is so much so that the break between the
two, when it finally comes, did not sit right with me. Jude Law, a young
actor whom I've grown to like, is vacuous as Vassily. The tentativeness he
first displays is never lost even as he is supposed to become a battle
hardened veteran. Rachel Weisz is pretty as the love interest, but is
mostly just window dressing. Fiennes is wooden and unconvincing as the
power hungry political commissar who sucks up to Nikita Khrushchev (Bob
Hoskins), sent by Stalin to oversee the battle.</P>
<P>Technically, "Enemy at the Gates" is a superb achievement. The battle
sequences are wrought with shockingly realistic action as the two armies
collide. The computer-generated  F/X, like the squadron of Stukas
dive-bombing the troop boats or Junker 88's carpet bombing the ruins of
Stalingrad, are seamless.  The wide panoramic of the battle sequences are
richly detailed with specifics, like tanks, weapons and uniforms, given a
great deal of attention.</P>
<P>"Enemy at the Gates" tries to be two very different films and isn't really
a success at either. It tries to be a compelling war drama of a duel to the
death between two sniper masters. At the same time, it poses as a romantic
drama with the war as a backdrop. I didn't get enough of one - the sniper
battle, of course - and thought there was way too much of the other. It's a
brilliant production, though, and I give it a B.</P>
