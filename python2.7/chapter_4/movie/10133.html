<P>With "Alien: Resurrection" out just now and all, I thought I'd FINALLY
see "Delicatessen," an earlier flim by its director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet,
who had co-directed it with Marc Caro, but had not done the same with
the new "Alien" film (bringing about some tension over whether or not he
was the one with talent - by the way, it was good).  "Delicatessen" is
an amazing film, filled with amazing style, a wonderful off-beat tone,
and some bits of satire which work with the film instead of being apart
from it.</P>
<P>"Delicatessen" takes place in a post-apocalyptic future where there's
apparently a shortage of meat.  We meet a ex-clown turned wanderer named
Louison (Dominique Pinon, who was Vriess in the new "Alien" film), who
finds a room at an apartment building with a butcher shop in it, run by,
well, the butcher: Clapet (Jean-Claude Dreyfus).  He gives him a job as
his assistant, which basically means he goes around painting and doing
odd jobs about the bizarre building.  Little does he know, this is a
very temporary job as he will be chopped up after a week or so, and fed
to the apartment dwellers (we find this out in the first scene).</P>
<P>The film chronicles his going-ons in the apartment, as well as that of
the inhabitants.  Everyone in the building is eccentrically weird in one
way or the other.  For instance, there's an old man who lives in an
apartment filled with water so frogs and other amphibians can live with
him.  There's also the aristocratic suicidal Aurore (Silvie Laguna), who
is always setting up overly-elaborate death traps for herself which
never work out (one has the old electrical appliance dropped into a
bathtub).</P>
<P>The only ray of sun-shine in the gloomy, bizarre building is that of the
mousy Julie Clapet (Marie-Laure Dougnac), daughter of the butcher.  She
and Louison immeadiately hit it off, and start a kind of bittersweet
romance which never gets really sexual or anything, but is never
overly-corny.  There are great scenes they have together, including one
where they play a duet together: she on the cello, and he on a saw (it
sounds really cool too), and they become a symbol of light in the gloomy
post-apocalyptic world.</P>
<P>As the film goes on, the need for meat gets worse, and soon other people
are being hacked for the good of the rest, mostly since Louison is an
excellent worker.  A subplot involving a group of renegades who live
underground is also introduced, and they struggle to stop Clapet from
killing more people.  The climax is wonderfully long, and incredibly
elaborate, bringing the film to a very satisfying conclusion, but not
becoming overly grand.</P>
<P>One of the many great things about this film is how it refuses to get
off on its gimmick.  The cannibalism idea is one that could bring about
a huge gorefest a la "Dead Alive."  While this is not a bad idea, I
really admired how un-gory this film really is.  Jeunet and Caro barely
show the killings, making it more effective.  Sure, there's some gore in
it, but it never glamorizes or over-does it.</P>
<P>The style is the best thing about this film, even though it is
jam-packed with wonderful things.  It is incredibly off-beat, and shows
us some truly bizarre characters, as well as some wonderfully weird and
imaginative scenes.  One of the best parts of this film deals with sex
going on, which is then juxtaposed through certain other scenes of
people doing things, all in rhythm with the other, and ending in a
wonderfully inspired climax (i.e. Julie playing her cello in synch with
everyone else, and resulting in her breaking her bow).  And one scene
dealing with the grandmother is truly classic.</P>
<P>I also admired how sweet and gentle it could be.  While its style is so
offbeat that even the Coen brothers would drop their jaws, there are
moments and scenes that are just wonderfully calm.  There's a scene
towards the beginning where Louison is unpacking which is strangely
melancholy, which is one thing this film usually isn't.  And the scenes
between Louison and Julie are wonderfully bittersweet and strangely
touching.  Pinon and Dougnac have great chemistry, which helps.</P>
<P>A special note should be made to Jean-Claude Dreyfus who is absolutely
awesome as Clapet.  While being hysterical and all, he also shows some
truly human signs in quieter scenes, and just does a great job with the
role.  Another note should be made to Chick Ortega who steals scenes as
a freaky mailman with a crush on Julie and a penchant for shooting
anything subversive.</P>
<P>But most of all, this film is truly a masterpiece of a black comedy. 
It's hysterical, moving, and just jaw-dropping to watch visually.  There
are some minor flaws (the rebel underground subplot really never goes
anywhere), but overall, the film is more than a rewarding experience,
and a symbol of sheer filmmaking craftsmanship.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***1/2</PRE>
