ETHAN FROME
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     The young Reverend Smith (Tate Donovan) in 1993's ETHAN FROME 
leaves his cosmopolitan Boston to take up his new post in a cold, 
isolated New England town.  A generous man, the Reverend gives a job to 
the town's pariah, Ethan Frome.  Ethan, a cripple who shuffles with a 
terrible limp, has one injured arm, and slumps to one-side like a 
hunchback, is a mysterious man who lives in the most remote cabin in the 
village.  People part like the Red Sea when he comes walking by.</P>
<P>     Shown in flashback before the accident that maimed Ethan, we learn 
Ethan's story.  Ethan was married to a woman, Zeena, who had "just about 
every sickness known to mankind."  After five years, Zeena arranges for 
their young and attractive relative, Mattie Silver, to come to live with 
them so she can take care of Zeena.  Slowly Ethan begins to fall in love 
with the warm and lively Mattie, whom the cold and distant Zeena 
resents.</P>
<P>     Liam Neeson, in a tender and understated performance, plays Ethan.  
A man with a promising future as an engineer, he has to give it up and 
his dream to move to Florida when he gets tied down with a sickly wife 
and an uncompleted education.  Liam gives a carefully constructed 
characterization of a long-suffering man who has relegated his life's 
ambitions to his wife's needs.</P>
<P>     In a spirited portrayal of Mattie, Patricia Arquette shows her as a 
simple girl swept away by the romance of the situation.  In close 
confines with a handsome married man, whose wife is a hypochondriac and 
a constant complainer, Mattie is naturally tempted.</P>
<P>     Joan Allen, who plays the weak and sickly better than almost 
anyone, is Zeena, Ethan's insufferable wife.  Allen's Zeena is extremely 
easy to hate and despise.  Zeena is so irritating that even the most 
fervent anti-adulterer will empathize with Ethan's need to abandon her 
and run to Mattie for love and companionship.</P>
<P>     Director John Madden from HER MAJESTY, MRS.  BROWN has just the 
right delicate hand not to overwhelm the subtleties of the story, based 
on the Edith Wharton novel.  The sad and bitter tale set in a bleak but 
lovely countryside has graceful Rachel Portman music to accompany the 
images.  </P>
<P>     The handsome cinematography uses the snow-crusted landscapes to 
maximum advantage.  The snow becomes both the most beautiful and the 
most frightening aspect.  Freezing cold, it makes Ethan's Florida dream 
palpably desirable and yet far removed from any possible reality for 
him.</P>
<P>     A tragedy that turns on events as small as a broken vase ends soon 
after the flashback gets to the dramatic recollection of the accident.  
Even when you know it is coming, it still takes your breath away.</P>
<P>     ETHAN FROME runs 1:50.  It is rated PG for mature themes and would 
be fine for kids 10 and up although they would probably need to be 
teenagers to be interested.</P>
