<P>Bruce Willis teams up with bad-guy Alex Baldwin in a film that essentially
introduces elements of WITNESS to the underlying theme of RAINMAN (8/10).
The film also offers us one of the crappiest titles to grace a movie screen
in a while, and has the privilege of being the recipient of "my shortest
review award", due to the generic nature of its existence and the "been
there, done that" feel of its development.</P>
<P>PLOT:
FBI agent Art Jeffries is a rebel within his own clan, and is demoted to a
rookie officer's job until he bucks up. While on an open-and-shut case,
Jeffries runs into an autistic child, who was able to decipher an elaborate
governmental code in a magazine, and suddenly finds himself attached to this
kid's safety. Covert agents from the government are after the boy, and want
him, and anyone else who knows about the discovery, dead.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Sub-par movie, this film doesn't truly live up to anything, because it
doesn't offer enough action to be considered an "action movie", nor enough
thrills to be considered a "thriller". Its dramatic touches are far from
effective, so skip the drama category, and its semi-witty repartees don't
amount to a hill of beans in regards to a legitimate comedy. So what is it?
Who knows! It certainly isn't a great picture, but it does offer an
interesting premise, a good actor in the kid who play the autistic child,
and a few moments of quasi-action scenes. It also offers a one-dimensional,
overacting bad guy in Alec Baldwin (Sure Alec, it's all about
patriotism.....yawn.), many, and I do mean many plot holes (Which may, or
may not bother you, depending on the type of movie-watcher you are), and a
weak conclusion. All in all, a film in which the title character resembles
and acts like the John McClane character from the DIE HARD series, but put
them head to head in an ultimate cage-match, and McClane would chomp this
pup's cheezy one-liners, and fake concern for breakfast. Bruce, it's time to
listen for the bell, my friend, cause it seems to be tolling for thee.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Alec Baldwin, at some point in his life, respectively dated Michelle
Pfeiffer, Janine Turner and Ally Sheedy. He is currently married to actress
Kim Basinger. What a man!
Bruce Willis' full name is Walter Bruce Willison. His nickname is Bruno.
This film's title went through some changes before the geniuses at the
studio settled on MERCURY RISING (Great idea, guys! Way to sell those
tickets!). Some of the earlier titles were SIMPLE SIMON, MERCURY FALLING
(how innovative), and SIMON.
Director Harold Becker has directed some solid films before this one. He's
the man behind 1981's TAPS (7.5/10) with a young Tom Cruise, SEA OF LOVE
(8/10) with the come-back of Al Pacino, and the 1996 drama CITY HALL (7/10).
The one inside joke in the film comes in the way of Alec Baldwin telling
Bruce Willis that "you've been watching too many of those 4-wheel-drive
commercials" (Baldwin himself being the television voice of Chevy trucks). -
Thanks to Scott Renshaw for that one.
The autistic kid in this film, actor Miko Hughes, is not autistic in real
life. His name means Chief in Chickasaw. He is a Native American. He also
played Tom Hanks' son in 1995's APOLLO 13 (6.5/10).
Bohdi Elfman, who plays the character of Leo Pedranski in this film, is the
nephew of composer Danny Elfman, and married to TV star Jenna Elfman.</P>
