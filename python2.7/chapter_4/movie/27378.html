<P><This first part has nothing to do with this movie. Go straight to the
critique if you could care less about this particular preamble>
Here's a question for you: why should anyone care about what any critic
thinks of any movie? The answer: well, let's see. In my humble little
opinion, critics are basically just folks who happen to have soapboxes big
enough to voice their opinions onto the world. That's all that they really
are...people with pointed opinions. Opinions based on their own experiences
in life, their backgrounds, their demeanors on any particular day, their
personal preferences, etc... Okay fine, they are generally much better at
dissecting a film's particular strengths and weaknesses than most people,
but still...it's simply their opinion. Nothing more, nothing less (No
offense to critics, most of whom do good jobs, but my point is what it is).</P>
<P>So why give a rat's ass about my review vs that of any other person? Well, I
think it has to do with being able to read someone's review and deciding
whether or not to see the film, based on your previous
agreements/disagreements with said critic. All that to say that we have now
fashioned yet another way for JoBlo's opinion to mean something to you. The
new section is called "Where is JoBlo coming from?" and it will feature an
array of past films which are related to the one being reviewed, with
JoBlo's ratings attached. This is done so that you could read the initial
review, check out his previous ratings of other "similar" films which you
may have already seen, and determine whether or not JoBlo's opinion should
give you any reason to see/avoid the movie in question. Not sure if it'll
help anyone out there, but for some reason, it sounds kinda reasonable to
me.</P>
<P>Hope you all dig it! I know that I would LOVE to see this kind of thing on
all other critics' reviews as well. Let's hope that the rest of the world
takes a stitch of notice and my little idea spreads like wildfire (or at
least, a brushfire). Spread the love, people...spread the love!</P>
<P>PLOT:
A young white girl who just lost her mom to a car accident, must move in
with her dad in a predominantly black neighborhood. Having given up on her
ballet, the girl quickly integrates herself into the local hip-hop dance
scene, with the help of a young black boy whom she befriends at school. It
isn't long before the two get closer, other people get really uncomfortable
with their affection and the girl opens up to said dude.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Surprisingly good. Other than the sucky title and the generally predictable
story line, this movie was actually interesting to check into, with
well-developed characters (for the most part), some fun hip-hopping, a cute
relationship and some tender moments? Yup, God knows I rarely shed a tear at
any flick, but when the dead-beat dad fixed up that room all right, I almost
broke the dam (when you see the movie, you'll understand). Then again, who
knows, maybe I was just a little "emotional" that day. But kudos to this
film's makers for avoiding the general stereotypical ventures of other films
based in the ghetto, and showing us that not everybody is addicted to crack
or busting caps up people's asses. Sure, problems like teenage pregnancies,
deadbeat fathers and gangs exist, but this film actually handles them with a
little humanity, and allows you to see some of the finer details beneath the
typical exterior. A great example is the deadbeat pop who is generally
portrayed as a straight-out A-hole in most other films. Well, in this movie,
and much like in real life, not everything is so cut and dry. As it was,
this film actually convinced me of most of these characters' humanity, and
that's what made this film work for me.</P>
<P>Sure, there is this whole "I gotta make it as a dancer" undertone going on,
which will likely keep the teens interested throughout, but believe it or
not, this film is much deeper than that. In fact, I think the trailer is
selling it too much like a simple hip-hop teen flick, when really it's
actually quite touching. And yes, the whole black/white relationship thang
is also handled pretty well, in my opinion. We see both sides of the issue.
Granted, a couple of the characters were a little stereotypical, like the
super-bitch at school and the gang-banger who can never seem to get out of
trouble, but then again, there are actually people like that in the world,
too. The film also might've wanted to cut out one of its few "side stories",
like the whole "sister having the child without the boyfriend sticking
around" thing, but that would only have been to trim some of the picture's
runtime, which went way past the general benchmark for these types of
movies. In the end, the better part of the film's story and personalities
captured enough of my attention for me to care about the movie as a whole,
and to wish most of the characters nothing but goodness in the end. Mind
you, I could see how some people might dismiss it based on its
predictability alone, but for me, the overall design clicked.</P>
<P>Note to Julia Stiles: Me thinks it's time for you to move beyond the teen
flicks and try to grab hold of some juicier parts. Don't follow the Freddie
Prinze Jr. route, girl!</P>
