<P>A friend said something like this to me after seeing this movie: "If THE
FUGITIVE was the story from the fugitive's point of view, then U.S.
MARSHALS is the story from the cop's point of view." Makes sense,
doesn't it? And yet so many people, including myself, went into this
movie expecting U.S. MARSHALS to convey the same edge-of-your-seat
suspense as did its quasi-predecessor, the 1993 blockbuster THE
FUGITIVE. Although Tommy Lee Jones reprises his Academy Award-winning
role in respectable fashion, a lot of the elements which made THE
FUGITIVE such an enjoyable movie have not been brought back. With little
or no suspense, no engaging plot, no truly likeable characters, and most
of all, no Harrison Ford, what does U.S. MARSHALS have going for it? </P>
<P>There are reasons that this movie is worth seeing. Tommy Lee Jones, as
U.S. Deputy Marshal Sam Gerard, and his crack team of criminal-chasers,
were engaging characters - albeit not ones that you hold close to your
heart. Gerard's team, in particular, was the lone source of lighthearted
dialogue. Their constant banter, which usually takes place behind or
around the stony-faced Gerard, was what helped the audience bear with
the cumbersome plot. Wesley Snipes, playing Mark Sheridan, the man that
Gerard has to chase down, in no way replaces Harrison Ford's character
of Dr. Kimble. Robert Downey Jr., who co-stars as an intelligence spook
named John Royce, is nothing but a plot facet: his character is
necessary for the new, complex plot to hold together but on the whole is
unnecessary for the theme. </P>
<P>The plot which encompasses these characters tells as follows: Marshal
Gerard and team set the ball rolling by taking down a household of
redneck arms hustlers. A tough breed, they require some extra
restraining, and in the siege, Gerard hits one of the criminals over the
head with a shotgun. The redneck threatens to sue, and so Gerard's boss
(Kate Nelligan) has Gerard go to Washington, DC, to do a public
relations bit for the Marshal Service. Unfortunately, she's got him
flying to DC on a prison transport plane with several other marshals
and, among others, Mark Sheridan. Everything is fine until an attempt on
Sheridan's life is made by another prisoner and the plane goes down in
the ensuing chaos. Sheridan escapes, and Gerard calls his team in for
another fugitive situation. This time, though, John Royce, a domestic
intelligence agent, is assigned to the case because of the special
nature of criminal that Sheridan is. </P>
<P>The plot has amazing possibilities, and it comes close to grasping some
of those, but it never really realizes its full potential. The way that
Director Stuart Baird tells the story is a decidedly sub-par affair, for
the tale comes out clumsy and unintriguing. During the 133-minute
running time, there are only a handful of scenes which have any real
watchability for action or suspense or both, others do nothing but
rehash ground that THE FUGITIVE has firmly trod over. This could have
been a much better movie, and although it's worth seeing, the decision
is primarily viewer merit.</P>
<P>FINAL AWARD FOR "U.S. MARSHALS": 2.0 stars - a fair movie.</P>
