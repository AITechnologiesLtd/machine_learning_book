<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A heartfelt Australian romance story about a mentally ill couple, which
won seven Australian Academy Awards, including best picture, actor,
actress and director. This film offers a piercing look at love between
Harry (Lynch) and Kate (McKenzie), who meet while attending therapy
sessions at a rehab day-clinic for the mentally disturbed.</P>
<P>The engaging young adult couple quickly get to know one another and
enter into a sexually active relationship. Harry is a bachelor who is
recovering from hearing voices. He has his own room in his brother
Morris' (Colin) house, where he lives with his wife Louise (Furness) and
young son Sam (Daperis). Kate was raped by her father at a young age and
removed from the family, and is also suffering from schizophrenia. She
now lives alone in a hostel, where her only outside interest is
religiously watching the TV show "Wheel of Fortune." Kate's life is
guided by omens, which she receives from her guardian angel named
Astral. Astral communicates with her as the letters are turned over
during the "Wheel of Fortune" and the phrases are revealed. Later on,
Kate will first learn of her pregnancy, as the letters spelled out are
"Great Expectations.''</P>
<P>The couple struggles against the odds of them living together on their
own and making it, as they get their own apartment, getting support from
his concerned brother and from the staff members at the clinic. The
lovers seem to be made for each other, each depending on the other for
support. There are many magnificent scenes of them showing their love
for each other in a sensitive and witty way, also showing how fragile
and insecure they are.</P>
<P>Things change when Harry lies about his mental illness in order to get a
computer job, and she announces as soon as he lands the job that she is
pregnant. The rehab staff is concerned about how they will manage to
take care of a baby and about how she is handling her pregnancy, as she
refuses to see an obstetrician; Morris also doesn't think they can
manage alone, and wishes they reconsider having the baby.</P>
<P>Without telling anyone, the couple stops taking their medication,
believing that by not taking the medicine the baby, whom Kate believes
is Astral himself, won't be infected with their illness. There is a
brilliant scene in the department store at the mall, where they are
buying gifts for their expected child and are told the item is on sale,
but since the original price fits the "Wheel of Fortune'' phrase, they
insist on paying full price. But the confused store clerk refuses the
higher price, saying they must buy the item at the sale price. This
throws the couple into a panic, as the store-manager is called. The
director shows how the outsiders only seem to harm them, even when they
are trying to be fair with them and offer them sound advise. Kate
becomes completely unwound in the store, as a speeding rollerblader
knocks her over while waiting for Harry to resolve things with the
manager and she starts to bleed, which causes her to become hysterical.
But we can rest assured that this is not going to be a cliché movie
about the mentally ill and how they manage, as the acting remains
controlled and is too earthy for the story to become compromised by a
sugary resolution.</P>
<P>At home, Kate locks herself in the bathroom, after ransacking the
apartment. When Morris, who is worried about how they are getting on,
comes over to visit them, he ends up calling the police after seeing
that something is wrong. She will be locked up in the mental hospital,
where she is heavily sedated against her will. To make matters worst,
even though Harry is working out satisfactorily in his job, he is fired,
as his boss explains to him that he is worried about what his customers
would think if they found out about his condition. Everything is
spiraling downward for the couple and they can't seem to get a break,
even though the people in their lives are not ogres and mean well in a
rational way, but they are not connecting with the couple.</P>
<P>This is a sensitive film. The director-writer, Rymer, makes sure that
our sympathies lie entirely with the struggling couple without making
the outsiders into monsters. Its beauty lies in how honestly the story
is told and in showing how difficult it is to find love and then lose it
through something you have no control over. It's an absorbing film, that
is well-acted and directed, but it is not a film that you might care to
remember. It lacked real affection for the couple, as they seemed forced
down our throats instead of being allowed to grow gradually on us.
Having pity for them, is not the same as really caring for them.</P>
