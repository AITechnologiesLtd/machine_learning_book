<PRE>                                 CHASING AMY
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1997 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>     (WARNING: This film is structured so that it is nearly impossible
to discuss the themes of the film without revealing aspects of the plot
that are left as plot twists.  I will spoil nothing that is not spoiled
by the trailer for the film.)</P>
<PRE>               Capsule: A pair of 20-something buddies who
          co-author a comic book are split over one's
          interest in a gay woman.  Kevin Smith takes what
          could have been rather trivial and self-important
          material handles it with a light touch, making a
          film that is both engagingly serious and genuinely
          funny.  Fans of Kevin Smith will not be surprised
          that the film is also at times fairly raunchy.  The
          frank and often sexual dialog is realistic, but
          will be a turnoff to some.  Rating: +2 (-4 to +4)
          New York Critics: 9 positive, 3 negative, 3 mixed</PRE>
<P>     CHASING AMY is the third film form writer/director Kevin Smith and
is set in his native central New Jersey.  While his first two were
nearly purely comedies, this time around he mixes in some serious
themes with his raunchy brand of comedy.  It is about how fallible is
the procedure of finding the right relationship and how delicate that
relationship can be once it is found.  Holden McNeil (played by Ben
Affleck) and Banky Edwards (Jason Lee) are two Red Bank, New Jersey
comic artists who create the popular comic book BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC.
At a comic convention in New York a friend introduces them to Alyssa
(Joey Lauren Adams).  Alyssa is cute, bright, and funny and Holden
immediately feels they have a mutual attraction and are perfect for
each other.  It even turns out she comes from Middletown, a neighboring
town to his.  He tells the incredulous Banky that he and Alyssa "shared
a moment."  Anxious to share more than just a moment he goes to a club
where his friend tells him he can find Alyssa only to discover in an
embarrassing moment that Alyssa is a lesbian.  In spite of knowing that
his relationship cannot become mutually romantic, he continues his
friendship with Alyssa, hoping to somehow convince her somehow to be
interested in him.  He hopes to win her in spite of her orientation.
The story becomes an odd sort of a love triangle with Banky afraid of
losing the friendship, now also a professional relationship, he has had
since childhood with Holden.  Banky finds Holden's love is even
starting to affect their professional relationship.  The other vertex
of the triangle is the free-thinking Alyssa with her own history.  In
the end, Kevin's story has returned to a theme he covered, albeit more
lightly, in CLERKS.</P>
<P>     All three of the main characters are veterans of other roles in
MALLRATS and of course writer/director Kevin Smith has played the wise
Silent Bob in all three of his films.  Ben Affleck as Holden is a bit
confused by it all and at the same time nicely witty.  There may be a
bit of Albert Brooks in his role and of Jason Lee's Banky.  But the
actor who shines the most is Joey Lauren Adams who does a terrific job
going through a wide gamut of emotions and always comes up genuine.
Smith has a good ear for dialogue and the words seem to come out very
naturally from the actors' mouths.  The one problem that perhaps could
have been better handled in a higher budget production is that they do
not enunciate so that their dialogue is distinct.</P>
<P>     Kevin Smith has a sense of humor to match better-known comic
filmmakers like Woody Allen and Albert Brooks.  He fills his script
with some hilarious send-ups of popular films.  Early on the film he
give us a militant African-American appraisal of STAR WARS that is as
funny as anything I have seen in a film in the last twelve months.
Later he has a terrific send-up of a familiar scene from JAWS.  And at
the same time Smith treads the boundary near political incorrectness by
implying that sexual orientation is really a matter of choice.
Alyssa's has logical reasons for being lesbian rather than having her
orientation come from an internal compulsion.  It seems like a small
thing, but it is a fairly radical departure from what we have seen
before in films.</P>
<P>     CHASING AMY is well-acted and directed and proves to be a very
moving and personal film.  After the critical misfire of MALLRATS, it
looks like Kevin Smith is back on target.  I give it a +2 on the -4 to
+4 scale.</P>
