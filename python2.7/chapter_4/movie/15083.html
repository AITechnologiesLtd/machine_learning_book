<PRE>                            Free Enterprise</PRE>
<PRE>                              written by:
                    Mark A. Altman & Robert Meyer Burnett</PRE>
<PRE>                              Directed by:
                            Robert Meyer Burnett</PRE>
<PRE>                              Producers:
                   Dan Bates, Mark A. Altman, Allan Kaufman</PRE>
<PRE>                              Cast:
                  Rafer Weigel, Eric McCormack, Audie England
                            and William Shatner</PRE>
<P>This romantic comedy set in the world of hard-core Sci-Fi fans raises
the bar significantly for independent films.  The script (winner of
best screenplay at the AFI festival in LA where they also took best
picture) is tight as a drum and will definitely be considered the
"mother of all" pop-culture reference movies.  The rapid fire dialogue
laced with Sci-Fi and movie references comes across not only as natural
but "real". I saw the film at the Peachtree International Film festival
with some true Sci-Fi fans who definitely could have doubled for some
of the characters in the film.  </P>
<P>The story revolves around two main characters who grew up on Science
Fiction movies and television, specifically Star Trek, who now struggle
with all things "Grown up" such as maintaining healthy relationships
(or finding one to start with) and the non-fiction horror of turning
30.  Along the way they meet their childhood idol, William Shatner, who
turns out to not be the captain of their fantasies.  Shatner turns in a
wonderful performance as the actor/man that created a legendary
character but who could never fill his own characters shoes.  I don't
want to give away anything more about the film, but I do want to stress
that one need not be a Sci-Fi fan to "Get" or enjoy this movie, it's a
real crowd-pleaser.  Hopefully, the film will get its distribution soon
as I can't wait to see it again and everyone else shouldn't miss out.</P>
