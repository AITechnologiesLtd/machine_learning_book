<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Tesis stars Ana Torrent as Ángela, an attractive student working on her
graduate thesis about violence in the audiovisual media, who accidently
stumbles upon a series of strange crimes at her university due to
uncovering a snuff film. She contacts an antisocial student named Chema
(Fele Martinez), who is an aficionado of porn/gore films and talks the
homely student into showing her some of his porn collection, but is
repelled by the real violence in them.</P>
<P>Her faculty adviser helps her search the university's film vault for
some more films to see on the subject and picks up the unmarked video of
a snuff film stored in a secret spot in the film library, but he is
killed while watching it in the screening room. His death is listed as
caused by an asthma attack. The naive Ángela wonders, at first, could a
film such as this cause a heart attack for the viewer. Ángela retrieved
the video when she went to look for the professor and found him dead.
Why the killer wouldn't have taken the tape, in the first place, is
never even attempted to be explained.</P>
<P>Ángela brings the tape to Chema's house and they watch the snuff film
together. Chema recognizes the girl tied in the chair being beaten, as
Vanessa, a coed he knows who has been missing for the last two years.
She is shot to death on camera and her body parts are chain sawed off by
the hooded sadist on film. Chema recognizes that it is a digital camera
XT-500 used, by noting the grainy quality of the film. There are cuts on
the tape and such snuff films are always filmed without any editing,
which Chema says must mean that the girl knew her killer and the cuts
indicate that she was saying his name. He notes that the murder took
place in someone's garage, as he notices tools in the background. He
also chides Ángela for being so aloof, for not learning much in film
school and for not being able to observe the minute details in
filmmaking. He feels rejected by her lack of attention to him, and even
asks her why don't you like me, I have money, too!</P>
<P>The suspense story then goes into the girl-in-peril mode, as Ángela
starts getting into something that is more dangerous than what she
bargained for. She gets a bad feeling when meeting her new faculty
adviser, Jorge Castro (Xabier Elorriaga). He proclaims that film
directors have to make violent films to please the public, and that they
have every right to. His theory is to "Give the public what it wants."
She distrusts him and refuses to share with him what she has uncovered
about the murder.</P>
<P>What the 22-year-old director, Amenábar, is trying to do, is show that
the public is hypocritical in its condemnation of porn/gore films,
because these films wouldn't be made if there wasn't such a tremendous
market for them.</P>
<P>At the university, she runs across a very handsome student with an
XT-500 camera. An incredulous chase scene ensues, whereby the student
catches up with her in the school's basement and tries to use his charm
on her. He returns the copies she made of the newspaper stories about
Vanessa missing, but fails to return the keys to her house that fell out
of her bag while she was running.</P>
<P>Chema tells her to stay away from the one she ran from. He is Bosco
(Eduardo Noriega) and that he is the killer. Ángela tells him that if he
is so sure about that, why doesn't he go to the police. Chema says that
the police don't like him and that there is no proof. Why Ángela doesn't
go to the police, herself, is a good question. There are hints that she
is strangely attracted to Bosco.</P>
<P>Ángela's investigation for the thesis takes her deeper into the mystery,
as Bosco pays her a surprise visit in her affluent Madrid home. She has
seen him with his girlfriend Yolanda and has also noticed someone has
been in her room looking for the tape. She doesn't want Bosco here, but
he has already gotten her to do a tape interview about the missing
Vanessa and has gotten a firm grip on who she is and what she is after.
He charms her mother and her sister Sena, who falls for his angel face
and his sweet talk.</P>
<P>Ángela is not sure that she can trust any of the people she suspects,
but it has now become apparent to her that there are people on campus
who have made a business out of making snuff films. Her lone
investigation was too much to believe, that for someone as smart as she
is, to make herself so vulnerable didn't seem likely. This slick
suspense story works very well on capturing her fear and following the
trail to the killer, but fails to be convincing in showing how the
public's prurient interest in violent smut is the reason filmmaker's
make such degrading films. The young director has an exciting way of
filming and keeping one engrossed in the story, thereby achieving a very
curious fantasy film, one that is filled with many psychological
overtones, but it is derivative film and can't lay claim  for being
original.</P>
