<P>Oliver Stone's film of Eric Bogosian's stage play (they collaborated
on the screenplay) was received favourably by critics but ended up
unnoticed by the public amid Stone's bigger-budget successes.  It
begins and ends with marathon performances by Bogosian in the role of
Barry Champlain, a Dallas shock-jock on the verge of being syndicated
nationwide.  Everything about Champlain is on the edge, including his
rocky relationships with producer/girlfriend Leslie Hope, wife Ellen
Greene, and boss Alec Baldwin.  Isolated in his darkened studio, he
rants to unseen callers as if he were addressing his invisible demons.
 His listening audience is largely hostile, and he is always on the
attack.  At first we are prepared to accept Champlain as a champion
for the underdog; as more and more callers run the gauntlet of his
show we grow to mistrust him.  The moment we believe he has finally
lost his balance is when he turns on one of his admirers and insults
her mercilessly, using exactly the same time of confrontational and
interruptive tactics he reserves for the bigots, fascists, and junkies
that comprise most of his audience.</P>
<P>Champlain is so unpredictable and fast-talking that it is difficult
for us to figure out his real agenda.  But he doesn't seem to have
one.  It's the line he snaps to a detractor at a ball game that gives
him away, when he tells her the reason she doesn't like his show is
because she has no sense of humor.  Champlain is no activist, merely
an egotist who is running his own private put-on (similarly, TALK
RADIO masquerades as an issues piece but is essentially a character
study) and is concerned only with his ratings.  There are moments he
has on air when he looks as if he may let the mask slip - but 
he has gone too far to turn back now.</P>
<P>Clearly, enjoyment of TALK RADIO will depend on how much you like
Bogosian's performance.  The scenes with him on the air crackle thanks
to Stone's charged direction and tight editing by David Brenner and
Joe Hutshing.  If you've ever listened to late-night talkback and
found some of the callers unsettling, you're bound to relive that
feeling again in the paranoid atmosphere of Champlain's studio. 
Bogosian's  meeting with an incoherent teenager (Michael Wincott) is
by turns hilarious and chilling.  He's just one of several memorable
callers, many of whom were voiced by the same group of actors. 
Inspiration for both film and play was the assassination of Denver DJ
Alan Berg by White Supremacists - exactly the kind of audience that
would be incensed by Champlain's uncompromising broadcasts.</P>
