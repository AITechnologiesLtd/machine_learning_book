<P>   With a crime's serving as a vehicle to explore its characters
deeply, Ray Lawrence's "Lantana," which is adapted by playwright
Andrew Bovell from his own theater piece "Speaking in Tongues,"
shares a common theme with the Coen Brothers' "The Man Who
Wasn't There"--released shortly before the Lawrence picture. 
"The Man Who Wasn't There" featured Billy Bob Thornton as a
barber who goes through the story numb, believing himself
metaphorically to be invisible not only to others but even to
himself--perhaps the essence of the modern, alienated man.  
"Lantana," which gets its name from an exotic flower which is
smooth and lovely on the outside but which hides a thick, thorny
growth (therefore the opposite of a sabra, or prickly pear), focuses
on people who are undergoing mid-life crises, albeit at various
ages, folks who think they are becoming invisible--taking leave of
the lives they dreamed of having when they were kids.  Though
the story takes place in a suburb of Sydney, Australia, many of the
people react in similar ways to Americans who undergo that
psychological phenomenon.  Some carry on affairs, others, lonely
and perhaps not even interested in testing the sexual waters,
become masochistic, make trouble, or grow suicidal.</P>
<P>   Structured by Ray Lawrence like a Robert Altman film, featuring
stories of families of strangers who become connected to one
another through circumstance, "Lantana" avoid the pitfalls of soap
opera by the authenticity of the acting and the maturity of the
narrative.   At no point does Lawrence allow the audience to take
their eyes away from the screen: these Australians play characters
who probably inhabit all our fears and desires as we grow older
and surrender our illusions.</P>
<P>   The principal target of Lawrence's probing lens, Leon Zat
(Anthony LaPaglia),  is a troubled police officer who, were he to
patrol the streets of New York, might turn into what we here call a
rogue cop.  Partnered to a woman who seeks a mate and who
looks to him for counsel, Claudia Weis (Leah Purcell), Leon is
married to Sonja (Kerry Armstrong) long enough to feel the need
to go astray.  Carrying on what estranged Jane O'May (Rachael
Blake) considers an affair but which is really just "a one-night
stand done twice" (as Leon cruelly explains to her), he undergoes
some enlightenment while pursuing the suspicious death of
psychiatrist Dr. Valerie Somers (Barbara Hershey), whose
daughter Eleanor had been murdered two years earlier, causing a
rift in Valerie's marriage to John Knox (Geoffrey Rush).  Leon's
investigation leads him to suspect both Valerie's husband, John,
and a father of three, Nik D'Amato (Vince Colosimo)--married to
Paula (Daniella Farinacci)--who had given Valerie a nocturnal lift
when the latter's car broke down.</P>
<P>   One of the more interesting aspects of this complex, yet easy-to-
follow plot, is that Nik and Paula, the most financially challenged
and perhaps least educated couple in the story, are the happiest
people around.  They are undergoing no crises, do not consider
themselves invisible, are not emotionally numb, and do not have
to profess their love for each other: the audience goes away
believing that they are the only twosome in the drama who retain
their mutual chemistry.  Anthony LaPaglia, interestingly cast as an
Australian though known to New York theatergoers for his role in
Arthur Miller's very American "A View from the Bridge" (which I
saw some years back at the Circle in the Square)  and to
moviegoers for Spike Lee's "Summer of Sam" among other
productions, conveys his tension throughout.  You don't want to
be arrested by this guy.  Seething with frustration because of his
inability to get turned on by his wife, he beats the stuffing out of a
drug pusher, viciously grounds his own teenage son for doing
weed, and shouts down a fellow he literally runs into on the street
as he jogs in an attempt to convince himself that he's still youthful. 
Barbara Hershey is also terrific as a shrink who is oh-so-confident
while gently questioning a client but who demonstrates Freud's
theory of counter-transference in his dislike for a gay patient,
Patrick (Peter Phelps), whose dilly-dallying with a married man
forces her to confront her own paranoia about her marriage to
John.</P>
<P>   "Lantana" is for a mature audience, people who go to the
theater to learn more about themselves rather than to escape from
their daily problems.  Ray Lawrence wonderfully mines territory
similar to what he dug into with the underappreciated "Bliss"--
capturing the same, almost clinical dimensions of a therapist
(played by Terence Stamp) who in treating a man with emotional
problems unlocks the door to his wife's forgotten past.</P>
