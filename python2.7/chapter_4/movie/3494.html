                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Looking for a suspenseful thriller with psychological overtones?
You will find it all here in this adaptation from a Stephen King
best-selling novel.  Screenwriter Tony Gilroy took Dolores Claiborne's
long monologue in the book and changed it for the film by replacing
some of it with an adult character only referred to in the book, the
daughter, Selena St. George (Jennifer Jason Leigh).</P>
<P>     Dolores Claiborne (Kathy Bates) has been charged with the murder
of a rich society matron, Vera Donovan, (Judy Parfitt) for whom she
worked and, as everyone knew, she hated.  Detective John Mackey
(Christopher Plummer) is determined to get a guilty verdict against
Mrs, Claiborne who once before was accused of murder.  That time it was
her abusive husband (David Strathairn) but she got off "not guilty"
that time.  Now, Mackey thinks he has several sure-fire motives for the
killing of Mrs. Donovan and he will nail her.  There is, however, much
more Mackey (and the audience) cannot guess while the film moves back
and forth, revealing hidden events.</P>
<P>     Kathy Bates turns in a first class performance.  No surprise there
although she has to age some twenty years during the film.  Jennifer
Jason Leigh, as the daughter who has been estranged from her mother
since the father's death, is induced to come home and face her own
hidden past.  Ms. Leigh, with no surprise here, either, is also
excellent.  Between Bates and Leigh, the film brings real life to the
tragedy and mystery.  Both should be Oscar contenders.</P>
