<P>         Turn down the bone-rattling Dolby Digital soundtrack of ``Con
Air,'' and you'll hear the sound of the assembly line that produced
it.</P>
<P>  It's taken years to refine the process of building a
blockbuster and the ``Con Air'' team don't deviate from the standard
procedure. After all, originality might get in the way of the
pyrotechnics.</P>
<P>  The formula is thus: Cast actors with a bit of box-office
clout, such as Nicolas Cage, John Cusack and John Malkovich; hire a
director (in this case, Simon West) smart enough to shoot each
explosion with several cameras, so it can be shown multiple times from
different angles; find a script with all the depth and complexities of
a coloring book. And ``Action!''...</P>
<P>  ``Con Air,'' which is much better produced than it is
written or acted, spins a wild and wooly yarn about a
prisoner-transport plane that's hijacked in mid-air by the
inmates. These cunning cons are helpfully described by one officer of
the law as being ``the worst of the worst,'' and in Scott Rosenberg's
screenplay, each of the primary heavies comes with his own tagline.</P>
<P>  For instance, leader Cyrus ``the Virus'' Grissom (Malkovich,
all but sleepwalking) is ``a poster child for the criminally insane.''
The crimes of Hannibal Lecter wannabe Garland Greene (Steve Buscemi)
make ``the Manson family look like the Partridge Family.'' Militant
Nathan Jones (Ving Rhames), aka ``Diamond Dog,'' wrote an
autobiography and ``they're talking to Denzel about the movie.''</P>
<P>  Also onboard is Cameron Poe (Cage), an ex-Army Ranger who
has served his time and is supposed to be on his way home to his
ever-loving wife (Monica Potter). Looking startlingly pumped-up and
sporting locks that would make Michael Bolton envious, Cage reverts to
a ``po' folks'' accent and drops phrases like ``makes no never-mind''
to assure us that Poe is true-blue, despite his sordid
surroundings. Convention dictates that Poe will end up serving as a
double agent, appearing to assist Cyrus and company while secretly
betraying them.</P>
<P>  West's shoot-it-in-slow-motion style owes more to MTV than
to director Sam Peckinpah, who pioneered it and knew the key to using
undercranking effectively was to employ it sparingly. West simply
doesn't seem to have any other technique.</P>
<P>  Fresh moments in ``Con Air'' are few, although there's an
inspired bit of sick humor incorporating a falling body, bird
droppings and Percy Faith's Muzak masterpiece, ``A Summer Place,'' as
well as an odd nod to exotica, in the form of a Hispanic transvestite
passenger (played by the androgynous Renoly), who takes time out from
shooting cops to vogue about in a form-fitting sun-dress.</P>
<P>  The rest of the movie is less concerned with pushing the
boundaries of its genre than in pushing the buttons of its audience,
something West and Rosenberg do surprisingly well: For all its
calculation and predictability, ``Con-Air'' should appease the
action-starved. The picture delivers most of what it promises,
although unlike the first two ``Die Hard'' movies or ``Terminator 2,''
there's no extra spin on the material.</P>
<P>  In fact, Rosenberg doesn't waste a minute on building
Cusack's character, ground-bound U.S. Marshal Vince Larkin; as a
result, Cusack, who often gives his roles an eccentric edge, can do
little in this film except run from fireballs and duck when flying
debris comes his way.  Dumpling-cheeked Irish character actor Colm
Meaney (``The Commitments,'' ``The Snapper'') is squeezed into the
thankless role of a braying DEA stooge.</P>
<P>  Compared to Disney's action extravaganzas of the past two
summers, ``Con Air'' has none of the suspense of ``Crimson Tide'' or
``The Rock,'' although it does get off the ground faster than either
of those predecessors. As some would say, if you like this sort of
thing, this is the sort of thing you'll like.</P>
