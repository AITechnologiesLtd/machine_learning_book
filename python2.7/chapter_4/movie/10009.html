A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>A documentary directed by Spike Lee</PRE>
<P>Ingredients: 
black and white photos, interviews with people, tight close-up shots of
faces, Governor George Wallace standing in a school doorway</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
This documentary explores the senseless bombing of the Sixteenth Street
Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama on September 15, 1963 which cut
short the lives of four children attending Sunday school: Addie Mae
Collins (14), Carole Denise McNair (11), Cynthia Wesley (14), and Carole
Rosamond Robertson (14). The bombing was a defining moment in the civil
rights movement because it awakened Americans to the real nature and
ultimate perversity of racist hatred. Interviews with people such as
Walter Cronkite, George Wallace, Coretta Scott King, civil rights
leaders, the former Mayor of Birmingham, and clergy are interspersed
with photos and film clips that locate the Sixteenth Street Baptist
Church within the context of the heated battle for racial integration
which was occurring in Birmingham, Alabama at that time. But the meat of
the story is the memories of the friends and family of the four slain
girls. They're all older now, and we get to watch them during the
interviews as they think back and explain things. Of course some details
are crystal clear and forever remembered, while others are fuzzy or lost
in time. At one point a mother stops and shows us her daughter's doll
collection, which she has faithfully kept pristine for over thirty
years. Another person says with difficulty, "It's not easy. Because we
had put so much of this behind us."</P>
<P>Opinion:
In some documentaries history is examined without emotion as if it
happened in limbo to people we don't know - - to people who wear black
and white clothing on grainy film. Not in this documentary. In '4 Little
Girls' Spike Lee foregoes dramatization or chronology and instead opts
to do this material as a set of interviews showing the plain and simple
(or even contradictory) truth the way people remember it. As real flesh
and blood folks ramble on about the people and events of Birmingham in
the 1960s, the camera allows us to watch every unconscious tick of the
muscles on their faces - - including the parents' and siblings'
determined efforts to keep a stiff upper lip and hold back tears.
Through this documentary Spike Lee reminds us that history is neither
impartial nor located in the past. History is today, living life as we
live it.</P>
