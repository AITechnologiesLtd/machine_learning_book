<PRE>_Gossip_ (R) * 1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Gossip.  While most people wouldn't like to admit it, a juicy rumor has
a certain allure--one that is often greater than that of truth.  The
thriller _Gossip_ takes its promising cue from this idea, but then the
film rapidly goes nowhere with it, growing more and more ridiculous with
each successive turn of the plot.</P>
<P>_Gossip_'s premise is simple.  For a project in their journalism class,
university students Derrick (James Marsden), Jones (Lena Headey), and
Travis (Norman Reedus) decide to plant and then trace the growth and
evolution of a rumor: that freshman Naomi (Kate Hudson), known for her
strict attitudes on sex, did the dirty deed with boyfriend Beau (Joshua
Jackson) while drunk at a party.  While the intent in harmless, the lie
quickly takes a life of its own, and soon everyone is suffering from the
fallout--not least of which the trio that started the whole mess.</P>
<P>The initial 20 minutes of _Gossip_, in which the three come up with
their bright idea and unleash it upon the campus, exploits the potential
of the premise.  Director Davis Guggenheim employs a creative and
succinct way to show how the gossip spreads and mutates: numerous people
directly address the camera, recounting the story as they heard it (or,
rather, think they heard it).  Straight-to-camera confessionals are a bit
cliché in the age of _The_Real_World_ and its ilk, but the energized
editing captures the excitement that accompanies a particularly enticing
piece of hearsay.</P>
<P>But much like how the Naomi-Beau rumor spins out of control, so does
_Gossip_.  The interesting premise established, Guggenheim and writers
Gregory Poirer and Theresa Rebeck proceed to do nothing with it.  Before
long, the subject that lends _Gossip_ its title comes to bear less
importance, and the film becomes a dismayingly conventional thriller
where characters end up having secret paths that provide needless added
motivation for certain actions.  Even on these dumbed-down terms,
_Gossip_ falls far short of the mark, but that doesn't stop Guggenheim
and company from also making the film a high minded "issue" movie.  I
won't say exactly what issue (to do so would reveal one of the film's key
"twists"), but the film tackles it with a fraction of the depth you'd
find in an afterschool special.</P>
<P>The cast certainly doesn't help the not-ready-for-the-big-screen feel. 
Marsden doesn't do anything here to counter the vacuous _Teen_Beat_ pinup
image he projected in _Disturbing_Behavior_; in fact, his performance
here is even more embarrassing, making the credibility-straining turns
his character undergoes even harder to swallow.  Headey is simply miscast
on a surface level.  She clearly looks much older than the rest of the
cast, resembling a mature woman among a group of kids; her American
accent is also pretty shaky.  Reedus does little to redeem what is
already a bad part: an artist who inexplicably finds a new, almost
obsessive inspiration in Naomi and her plight.  Speaking of Naomi, Hudson
is the only person who delivers a slightly credible performance.  More
seasoned stars, such as Sharon Lawrence, Edward James Olmos (both playing
police detectives), and Eric Bogosian (as the journalism professor) are
wasted.</P>
<P>It's only fitting that _Gossip_ will undoubtedly fall victim to its own
hook.  When word-of-mouth spreads--and it will, and quite quickly at
that--the film will take a much greater trouncing than the one felt by
its mischief-making characters.</P>
