<P>ULEE'S GOLD -- a movie review by Justin Siegel</P>
<P>Bee metaphors -- there are lots of 'em. I know; I've seen ULEE'S GOLD.</P>
<P>Living in a small city, most offbeat, indie, or small features don't
get shown here until a month or two after they've proven themselves
worthy. And then they only usually stay about a week, since nobody in
this town appreciates good films. ULEE'S GOLD will suffer this fate,
and it's a pity. Everyone is out enjoying that insipid Jennifer Aniston
comedy PICTURE PERFECT.</P>
<P>I saw ULEE'S GOLD on its opening day. Everyone in the theater loved it.
All six of us.</P>
<P>ULEE'S GOLD is a magical and inspirational new film from RUBY IN PARADISE
director Victor Nunez, and it caused quite a stir at Sundance this year.
It is the story of beekeeper Ulee Jackson (Peter Fonda), who lives with
his two grand-daughters: Penny (Vannesa Zima), 10, and Casey (Jessica Biel),
15. He is a widower and is more comfortable consorting with bees than with
human beings.</P>
<P>He has a son in prison, who he hasn't heard from since forever. Then he
gets the call. His son, Jimmy (Tom Wood), wants Ulee to go to Orlando
and bring Helen (Christine Dunford), Jimmy's wife, back to Ulee's home.
Ulee is none too excited about this, and neither are her daughters,
especially since she's a major druggie.</P>
<P>But, with the help of neighbor Connie (Patricia Richardson, from tv's
HOME IMPROVEMENT, proving that at least one star from that show can
make a _good_ movie), they get Helen through withrawal and try to steer
her in the right path. Not so easy with her old roommates coming back
to collect some money they think they're due.</P>
<P>ULEE'S GOLD, like Nunez's other film RUBY IN PARADISE, is about lonely,
tortured souls who just want a little peace and quiet. Fonda, eerily
resembling his father Henry in both looks and acting ability, is virtually
a shoe-in for a Best Actor nomination next March, and don't be too
surprised if both Nunez and the film itself get recognition too.</P>
<PRE>ULEE'S GOLD deserves it.</PRE>
<PRE>        A (report card)                  9 (out of 10)                  **** (0 to ****)</PRE>
<P><HR>The reviews of CONTACT and TWIN TOWN which are under my name (both circa
mid-July, 1997) were not done by me, but by my father. Sorry for any
inconveniance (yeah right).</P>
