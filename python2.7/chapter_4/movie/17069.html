<P>Not since 1996's SHINE, which starred Geoffrey Rush as pianist David
Helfgott, has a movie so defiantly laid bare the lives of world-class
musicians. In fact, if one were to watch these films together, it would
almost certainly stand as a convincing argument that a life of music
naturally leads to all varieties of social ills. Yet HILARY AND JACKIE,
the sophomore effort from director Anand Tucker, has something more to
say -- it softly but strongly explores the complex relationships of
sibling rivalry and love in a very compelling tale. </P>
<P>Emily Watson and Rachel Griffiths are the leads in this tale, playing
the sisters Du Pré. Both musicians from childhood, Hilary (Griffiths) is
renowned flutist while Jacqueline (Watson) is easily as skilled on the
cello. The two comepete for and win many honors as children and as young
women, both together and seperate. Their careers as musicians surpass
and then bow to one another's, and although their lives take very
different paths -- Hilary settles down to marriage and a family while
Rachel skips across the globe on a world concert tour -- they are bound
together by their deep family love. </P>
<P>The performances of Watson and Griffiths are excellent in style and
substance. They contrast each other wonderfully, and while Watson's
portrayal of Jackie Du Pré is at times eccentric and perhaps
unsympathetic, both characters are charged with emotion. The Frank
Cottrell Boyce script, which is based on the book by Hilary and Piers Du
Pré, brings a great deal of depth to these characters as well. </P>
<P>The script is also to be commended for its well-polished dual nature.
Cottrell Boyce adopts a style which one might expect to see in a mystery
thriller (which was in fact the case with David Koepp and Robert Towne's
script for MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE) and skillfully molds it to the story of
two rising musicians on different courses to fame. The latter parts of
his script are controversial to say the least, and the rather depressing
ending takes the wind out of an envigorating story. Some will leave this
movie feeling disenfranchised. Nevertheless, HILARY AND JACKIE is a
movie that reaches an upper echelon of contemporary cinema through solid
fundamentals and is a decent watch all around. </P>
