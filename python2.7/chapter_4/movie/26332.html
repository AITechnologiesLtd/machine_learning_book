SHORT CUTS
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>In my country, TV shows dedicated to seventh art tend to be
named after great or popular films. Our national television
so far had two such shows - one named after A FISTFULL OF
DOLLARS and another named after VERTIGO. Local television in
my home town adopted the same practices - for the past five
or so years, the movie show is named after SHORT CUTS, 1993
drama by Robert Altman. That film perhaps owes such honour
mostly to its "cool" title, but it is nevertheless
considered to be the one of the most important and most
successful films of early 1990s.</P>
<P>The film is based on the short stories by late American
writer Raymond Carver. Script by Altman and Frank Barhydt
changed the scenery from Pacific Northwest and brought it to
Los Angeles where the plot takes place few days before the
earthquake. The film actually lacks the plot in the usual
sense of the word - instead there are nine vignettes in
which we are introduced to few dozen characters. All of
those characters are faced with variety of problems which
are difficult but mundane - couple must deal with a death of
a child, husband has difficulties accepting his wife as
phone sex operator, participants in the fishing expedition
must decide whether to spoil their fun by reporting dead
body to police etc. Those vignettes are connected through
characters from one briefly appearing in another and they
would all end with the earthquake at the end of the film.</P>
<P>One of the most popular descriptions of SHORT CUTS is "the
shortest 3-hour movie in history". This catchphrase, very
popular among 1990s critics, seemed impossible for many of
those who followed Altman's career a decade earlier. Once
one of the most celebrated directors, Altman was practically
exiled from Hollywood in the era of Lucas and Spielberg,
since everyone began thinking about his films as "too
artsy", "hermetic" and incomprehensible to the average
viewer. Altman made a comeback with a style in 1992 and got
even with Hollywood establishment by mercilessly satire in
PLAYER. One year later, Altman finally got his satisfaction
by having one of such "artsy" and "hermetic" films being
lauded as one of the most important American films in 1990s.</P>
<P>SHORT CUTS in many ways resembles NASHVILLE, another
Altman's film populated with myriad of characters and their
stories accidentally intertwined on the same place. However,
this time Altman doesn't want to use satire in order to
expose specific cultural phenomenon (he would do it one year
later in PRET-A-PORTER); his goals are more ambitious and he
wants to expose modern life in all of its horror. He uses
camera as god-like instrument that allows the audience to
have insight into the most private and intimate details of
protagonist's lives, while in the same time he allows
audience powerless to change horrific fates that await some
unfortunate individuals in the film. SHORT CUTS is powerful,
gripping film in which the black humour often intertwines
with tragedy - one of the example is the scene in which a
boy gets hit by a car only to refuse the offer of
guilt-stricken driver to be taken to hospital, justifying
his decision with the most sensible advice given by his
parents. Actually, all the misery in this film comes from
understandable, down-to-earth human frailties as well as
equally down-to- earth and understandable twists of fate.</P>
<P>However, although Altman's masterful hands manage to keep
our attention from the beginning till the end, SHORT CUTS
doesn't deserve all of the praise received by the critics.
Since the material is so diverse, it is natural to expect
that some characters and vignettes would work and some would
not. Among the latter is the love story between alcoholic
Earl (played by Tom Waits) and his long-suffering wife
Doreen (played by Lily Tomlin). Quality of acting also
varies from vignette to vignette and from character to
character. It is interesting to find that the most powerful
performances come from a relatively obscure actor like Lyle
Lovett, while more established actress like Julianne Moore
gets remembered mostly for her willingness to appear
partially nude in front of camera. Another distraction in
SHORT CUTS comes from rather irritating musical soundtrack
by Mark Isham and Gavin Friday, dominated by jazz tunes.
However, although SHORT CUTS had its formula later used by
other, perhaps even more successful and talented filmmakers,
it still provides an interesting viewing experience and
clear demonstration of the talent of a very important
American filmmaker.</P>
