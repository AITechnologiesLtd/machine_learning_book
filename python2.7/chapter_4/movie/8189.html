<P>Will Smith's good looks and good timing, ironic mien and overall cool make
him a capital asset  of this yap and zap movie, along with Tommy Lee Jones
in what is probably his first out-and-out comic role, played
tongue-in-cheek, mostly deadpan, with a delivery of lines faster than any
character's in a Howard Hawks screwball entertainment.</P>
<P>MIB is a spoof of many things, primarily of sci-fi flicks and specifically
of nasty non-brothers from other planets. It also changes a "serious"
comic-book into comedy. Jones (whose name is K in a throwaway Kafka joke)
belongs to a  super-super-secret government outfit, so secret that other
agencies know of it. The Men in Black are after illegal aliens, nor your
garden variety undocumented Mexicans, Paraguyans, Antilleans, Nigerians or
former Sovietskis, but real E.T. aliens. In a spoof of census-taking, the
secret agents know that some 1,500 outer-spacers live in the USA.</P>
<P>Most are "good citizens" and are left alone. But the occasional bad 'uns,
destroyers in a mind-boggling variety of forms (such as nasty Spielbergian
gremlims, insect-like monsters, critters a la Alien, animals, ordinary
humans, and so on), have to be terminated with extreme prejudice.The
ingenious way K searches for them is by reading supermarket tabloids.
Clever and funny.</P>
<P>As his venerably-aged partner wishes to retire, K, looking for a
replacement, selects NYPD cop Smith, who becomes J. The two engage in a mad
series of comically vigorous feats.</P>
<P>The opening sequences are funny. The MIB secret immigration building is a
howl, especially as weird creatures are asked by Customs if they are
carrying forbidden fruit, vegretables and the like. Jones's patter (it
often reaches rhetorical heights) is very funny. Te neural neutralizer, a
gizmo that zaps selected periods of memory, is amusing. (To avoid its
effects the Men in Black wear dark, aptly named Ray-Ban glasses. That's the
best product placement in years).</P>
<P>Most funny too is when Will Jones is somehow led to a recruiting room of
the MIB yet has  no idea as to why he is there. Zed (the great Rip
Torn,good in any role, even the smallish one here)  administers a test to
the Best of the Best of the Best, all in uniform (they are the cream of the
military), bellowing cliches. Smith wears flamboyant street casuals.</P>
<P>An even funnie small gem is when, absurdly and unflappably, Smith takes the
written exam sitting in a  modernistic boothlike seat, with nothing to
place the questionnaire on, using a pencil that breaks and pierces sheets
of paper, yet coming out the victor.  that have no place on which to lie,
is a small gem. The scene was probably influenced by movies of the late
Francois Truffaut, in which schoolchildren have no end of problems with ink
and copybooks. (Elsewhere there are also middlin' funny throwaway
references to movies and  TV such as Sgt. Friday, Jeopardy, etc.)</P>
<P>Such passages, plus the two partners, are delightful. The other major
assets of the film are most imaginative photography and amazing special
effects that include morphing and transformations.</P>
<P>Now to the negatives. There is no true plot, unity or continuity. The movie
grows as, and into, a catch-all. There is a lack of logic and explanations,
even by crazy standards. Anything goes, anything is good for a gag or
verbal or visual joke, whether it's about  an E.T. squid baby to Dennis
Rodman, to goings on in the morgue, to a farmer's wife (no, not the usual
traveling salesman salacious jokes). Most work amusingly, but the
over-episodic structure, the arbitrariness of events, the unending yap and
zap, lessen the movie. Too much is too much and may, depending on the
viewer, start leading to tedium abetted by the unsolved problem of "how can
we end this picture?" Well, it just fizzles.</P>
<P>I grant you that it is not easy to parody sci-fi films, not just the funny
ones but those eager movies that, from a certain angle, are themselves
unconscious parodies. Even so, Men In Black is guilty of what is often a
central problem of the movies it spoofs: overkill.</P>
<P>As it runs 96 minutes, MIB might be given a cautious certificate of
membership in BBNMM,the famed organization Bring Back the Ninety Minute
Movies. With ten minutes cut and much tighter construction, MIB may even
have been a candidate for
a Certificate of Merit.</P>
