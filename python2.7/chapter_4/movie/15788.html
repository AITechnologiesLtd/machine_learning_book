A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Ron Underwood</PRE>
<P>Written by Lawrence M. Konner and Mark Rosenthal</P>
<P>Synopsis:
An orphaned girl named Jill Young (Charlize Theron) has befriended an
orphaned baby gorilla named Joe who carries within his genes the DNA for
gigantism. Joe's parents were killed by poachers. Years later, Jill is a
young woman living in Africa, and her animal friend Joe is 4.6 meters
tall and weighs 905 kilograms, a magnificent, gentle, and intelligent
giant. For Joe's safety, Jill and her friend Gregg (Bill Paxton)
establish a place for Joe in the United States at a game reserve called
the California Animal Conservancy.</P>
<P>But the evil Mr. Strasser (Rade Serbedzija) and his men, the diabolical
poachers who killed Joe's parents, plot to deceive Jill and take Joe
from the Conservancy in order to sell him on the environmental black
market. When Joe escapes into the Hollywood area, the poor beast is
hunted by gung ho police snipers, evil poachers, and the good guys as
well. Who will reach him first?</P>
<P>Opinion:
As far as I know, there are two main big gorilla flicks: MIGHTY JOE
YOUNG of 1949, and the well known 1933 KING KONG. MIGHTY JOE YOUNG
(1998) is a modernized remake of the 1949 classic.</P>
<P>MIGHTY JOE YOUNG (1998) is a family movie made especially for children,
and it succeeds very well. The good guys are good (young, friendly, with
light colored clothing); the bad guys are bad (dark hat, suspicious
accent, black gloves to hide identifiable hand), and; the beloved animal
is a misunderstood friend who has run away from home. My neighbor took
with her with a troop of four young kids, and they never failed to clap
and cheer when the good guys got one over on the bad guys. The kids also
held their breath when it looked like big Joe might be hurt. It's
obvious that cast members Charlize Theron and Bill Paxton love animals
or have pets of their own. Both Theron and Paxton do such a terrific
acting job that you forget Joe is only a special effect and not an
animal actor.</P>
<P>The adult theme of MIGHTY JOE YOUNG concerns the protection of the
endangered Gorilla, thought to be a mythical creature until proven to be
real by a skin and skull in 1849. Although fairly intelligent and
man-like (Koko the sign language gorilla was tested to have an IQ over
80), the animal has been hunted to near extinction. Today there are less
than 400 remaining wild mountain gorillas. As for the possibility of
gigantism, modern gorillas can weigh 300 to 400 pounds (136 to 181 kg).
The largest ape, "Gigantopethecus," lived in Asia during the Pleistocene
Era. From its bones it is estimated to have been approximately 10 feet
tall and have weighed over 600 pounds (271 kg). It is almost certainly
extinct, but some suggest Gigantopethecus is responsible for tales of
the Yeti and Bigfoot.</P>
