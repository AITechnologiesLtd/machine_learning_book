<P>Susan Granger's review of "BRIDE OF THE WIND" (Paramount Classics)</P>
<P>        Remember Sharon Stone's character in Albert Brooks' 1999 comedy "The
Muse"? She inspired writers and other cinematic creators in Hollywood.  In this
film, Alma Schindler assumes that role in the cultural community of early
20th-century Vienna. As played by petulant model-turned-actress Sarah Wynter
("The Sixth Day"), she's the free-spirited young wife of composer Gustav Mahler
(Jonathan Pryce) whose sexual escapades were legendary. Her major lovers
included painter Gustav Klimt (August Schmolzer), architect Walter Gropius
(Simon Verhoeven) of the Bauhaus movement, painter Oskar Kokoschka (Vincent
Perez), and novelist Franz Werfel (Gregor Seberg), whom she married after Mahler
died - but she also toyed with her musical tutor Alexander Zemlinsky, singer
Enrico Caruso, composer Arnold Schoenberg, and writer Gerhart Hauptmann.
Australian director Bruce Beresford relies on Peter James's cinematography and
Herbert Pinter's production design, including artistic costumes and elegant
sets, in a valiant attempt to overcome Marilyn Levy's exposition-weighted script
and soggy, repetitive dialogue in a cacophony of accents. Although her story has
great dramatic potential, Alma Schindler's capricious motivations are unclear
and, at best, petty and shallow. Has her own creativity been stifled because
Mahler forbade her to pursue a career in composing? Is she a neurotic
pre-feminist, rebelling against Gropius's desire to keep women in their place at
home? Or is she simply a promiscuous adventurer, as satirized in Tom Lehrer's
song "Alma," concluding "The body that reached her embalma was one that had
known how to live"? On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Bride of the Wind"
is a glossy but floundering 5 - far better suited to a TV mini-series. </P>
