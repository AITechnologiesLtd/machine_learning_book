<P>A very funny film, at least for the first half. Then it goes to a drama and is
only mediocre. Patch Adams has its moments. Then, it does not have any good
moments. This is not something you see everyday in Hollywood. Some movies
flip-flop between comedy and drama or horror throughout the film, but Patch
Adams does not do that. It actually changes around the midway point of the
film. The first half of the film is hilarious, and Robin Williams was
delivering a great comedic performance after his mediocre What Dreams May Come.
But, then things go sour.</P>
<P>As said before, Robin Williams is great as a doctor who wants to help patients
more then medically. He is great, at least, humorously. Then, when things "go
drama" Williams starts to disappoint. This part of the film just was not for
him. In Good Will Hunting, he showed he could be good in a drama. At least in a
supporting role. In Patch Adams, he falters. This role should have gone to
someone who could handle both clever humor and drama. </P>
<P>Monica Potter, who looks exactly like Julia Roberts, delivers one of the only
straight through performances. She does nothing outstanding, but is good in her
supporting role. She is there for some humor and shines as the only actor to
stand out during Patch Adams' drama phase. </P>
<P>Daniel London plays Patch's sidekick and is average. He really does nothing to
stand out in the film. The rest of the cast is basically there to set up
Williams' humor. </P>
<P>The main theme throughout the film is, as Patch puts it, "You treat a disease,
you win you lose….You treat a patient, I guarantee you'll win." The humor that
starts off the first half of the film is hilarious. From Williams' plain out
humor to the gynecologist convention, the humor is fast and furious. This comes
in complete contrast to the second half of the film. When the drama half of the
film starts, it is sluggish and not as fast paced as the first half of the
film.</P>
<P>Williams does have some good parts when doing his drama. But, he does not lead
the way in the film. Monica Potter's part is extremely underwritten because she
is the only one to stand out during the drama part of the film. The sluggish
pace is the nail in the coffin for this film, though. If the humor in the first
half was not as quick, the sluggishness of the second half of the film would
have been acceptable. However, the sharp contrast is detectable to everyone and
it will become hard to concentrate on the film. The only time that the screen
seems to light up during Patch Adams' drama is when Monica Potter and Robin
Williams are on the screen together. Potter is basically unheard of in
Hollywood, but this role should bring her other roles. She seems to bring out
the best in Williams' acting and is the saving grace for Patch Adams. </P>
<P>I had big doubts for Patch Adams heading down the homestretch. Then came the
ending. The ending was great. You might perceive it as corny and cliché but for
some reason, it caught my attention. Monica's death (sorry for spoiling it) is
truly surprising and Williams' best dramatic acting comes during his appearance
before the board.</P>
<P>Overall, Patch Adams is good, depending on whether you like drama or comedy. I
would like to give it a great rating, but it never decides what its main
objective is. If you like comedy, maybe you should leave after the first hour.
But, it is a decent film and I would recommend for those looking for an
"enjoyable' film.</P>
<PRE>Rating: 2 1/2 stars out of 4 stars</PRE>
