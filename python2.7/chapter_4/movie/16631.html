<P>   "My Favorite Martian" is based on the TV series of the
same name and it looks it.  Loaded with banal one-liners that
brought laughs to neither the critics nor the small fry in the
audience, the picture depends for its appeal on visual effects
and a story about a friendship between two people from
different worlds.  The effects, however grand, are ugly, unless
you go for Monty-Python style graphics about a man who at
one point says "I'm coming apart" and then literally does. 
And it would be a stretch to interpret the friendship between
an emerald-green Martian and an Irish-American as a
metaphor for the idea that we can learn to live together
happily with people who look different from us and act in
ways we consider strange.  At one point, director Donald
Petrie reaches for the E.T. factor, hoping perhaps that the
audience would sympathize with a dying Martian whom the
doctors have given up trying to save, but don't think of selling
your Kleenex stock yet: tissue usage is not about to increase.</P>
<P>   When Tim O'Hara (Jeff Daniels), a reporter looking to
impress his boss with a big story, accidentally falls into what
could be the scoop of the century, he is dismayed to discover
that a just-landed Martian (Christopher Lloyd) is determined
to keep his identity secret.  Converting himself from the
standard Martian look to a human countenance, the visitor
sets about exploring the culture of the planet Earth, which he
and his people have always considered a center of
barbarism.  Believing himself to be bereft of human-style
feeling, he is surprised by his reaction to several women,
including Tim's TV-reporter girl friend Brace Channing
(Elizabeth Hurley), TV crew member Lizzie (Daryl Hannah)
and Tim's landlady Mrs. Brown (Christine Ebersole).  </P>
<P>   As the budding rapport of the two men evolves into pure
camaraderie, the two ride through events which are milked
for comic potential.  In one situation Martin takes on Tim's
identity and explores the nature of kissing with one of the
lovely women, and in a final change of identity he becomes
the gorgeous Brace Channing, delivering a comic newscast
designed to keep his secret identity secure.    Since the folks
who make movies for the little ones are convinced that a
vulgar situation or two can't hurt, director Petrie exploits a
ride that Martin and Tim take through a sewer, pursued by a
Roto-Rooter in the hands of villainous scientists led by Dr.
Coleye (character actor Wallace Shawn).  Believing they are
home free, they discover they are submerged just under the
toilet seat of a man who asks for his Field and Stream
magazine and complains that he shouldn't have had that
fourth burrito.</P>
<P>   Special effects are imposing but nothing that we haven't
seen before in the Mars-attacks genre.  The showstealer is a
suit named Zoot (played by "himself"), an empty uniform that
feels abandoned when its owner discards it for something
more in line with the Santa Barbara style.  The only gag
subtle enough to appeal to adults, one that you'll miss if you
blink, displays Lizzie leaning back at the studio reading a
copy of "Men are from Mars."  On the whole, "My Favorite
Martian" is an Unimpressive Flying Object.</P>
<PRE>Rated PG.  Running Time: 93 minutes.  (C) 1999
