<PRE>What Women Want 
a film review by Chad Polenz</PRE>
<PRE>WHAT IT'S ABOUT: </PRE>
<P>Mel Gibson stars in his first romcom in 10 years as Nick Marshall, a rich 
sexist ad exec who suddenly gains the ability to hear women's thoughts after 
being electrocuted. With the sudden comic book-like superpower he realizes 
what women really think of him, what appeals to women and how to woo his new 
co-worker Darcy (Helen Hunt). There's also a sub-plot of Nick trying to 
relate to his teenage daughter as well as another romantic encounter he has 
with the woman at the coffee shop he sees every day. </P>
<PRE>WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT IT: </PRE>
<P>Gibson gives a very good performance showing he's a talented actor, not just 
a pretty face. The screenplay includes a lot of very funny jokes exploiting 
the character's magical ability to hear what women are thinking - combining 
trendy pop culture references with the standard one-liners and zany 
pratfalls. The plotline involving Gibson's wooing of Hunt is pretty 
convincing and the two have good chemistry making this one of the few romcoms 
that actually work. </P>
<PRE>WHAT'S NOT SO GOOD ABOUT IT: </PRE>
<P>Although the main storyline is concise and the jokes work the screenplay is 
far too elaborate for an otherwise elementary Hollywood movie. The subplots 
about Nick trying to get along with his daughter and the girl at his work 
who's secretly suicidal aren't handled nearly as tactful as they should have 
been. The ending has not one, not two, but THREE climaxes all involving Nick 
"saving" a woman in one way or another. </P>
<PRE>CRITIQUE: </PRE>
<P>The comedy is certainly winning but the film takes its plot a little too 
seriously. This film could have been the biggest accomplishment for feminism 
in years if it had ended any other way. Not only is it a totally lame cop-out 
as far as filmmaking goes but it sells short the theme that men should listen 
to them, be sensitive, be self-sufficient and not be so... you know... manly. 
. Apparently women aren't as liberated as we think, they still need men to 
come to their rescue. </P>
<PRE>GRADE: B- </PRE>
