<P>   When I taught high-school social studies during the ealry
sixties, we followed the curriculum, which mandated that we
teach a unit on fifth-century B.C. Greece.  Each term we
asked our 15-year-olds whether they would have preferred to
live in Athens (a center of intellectual ferment) or Sparta (a
military dictatorship), and each term we got the same knee-
jerk answer, "Athens."  Perhaps the kids were giving us what
they thought we wanted to hear.  After all we were college-
educated, and the Athens of the time was chock full of
philosophers, playwrights and artists.  One youngster
impressed me, though.  His answer: "Sparta--because I
would not have to think."  Good one!  The choice is not such
a no-brainer, after all, since we remember that Athens had a
large population of slaves and of women who had no political
rights, while Sparta's lifestyle was suited to the love that
Americans still had for the military during the Kennedy
administration.</P>
<P>   Sharp teachers now propose a more contemporary
question: would you rather live in America during the early
1960s or now?  Eyes would roll as youngsters who have
seen New Line Cinema's "Pleasantville," would recall a
preceding population of repressed women and rigidly
conformist males, liberated by hip siblings David and
Jennifer.  No problem guessing their response.  But think
again.  Remember that during the repressed sixties
small-town America was safer, more secure, more
predictable, and comparatively free of drugs, crime, and
AIDS.  How does that take us to New Line's current offering? 
"Blast from the Past" is "Pleasantville" turned topsy-turvy. 
Instead of a couple of 90's kids freeing the psyches of the
folks from the 50s and 60s, this time a fellow from the
innocent 60s shows up our contemporary society by his
superior manners, education, and morality.</P>
<P>   "Blast from the Past," whose title comes from an
expression by a celebrated deejay who'd introduce rock-and-
roll classics with that expression, has a double-meaning.  It
stands in for the nuclear devastation which one family
believes occurred in 1962, and also for the emergence of a
35-year-old man who wiled away his youth with just his mom
and dad for company and had about as much idea of what
was going on in the real world as did the Val Kilmer character
in "Sight Unseen."   When Calvin Webber (Christopher
Walken) and his wife Helen (Sissy Spacek) hear JFK's TV
address pitting the U.S. toe-to-toe against the Soviet Union
over the Cuban mssiles, they take to their California
underground bomb shelter, a spacious abode boasting a
thirty-five year stockpile of food and other needs.  Because
(incredibly enough) they did not have a radio or TV in the
shelter, they could not have known that the Soviets backed
down.  Hearing a devastating explosion just above their
shelter (actually a crashing plane which levels their home),
they assume it to be a nuclear discharge.  Helen gives birth
to a baby boy, and the threesome settle in for a thirty-five
year span, expecting to emerge when California would
become safe from radioactive fallout.  The highly educated
Calvin and his wife teach the boy languages, math, science,
dancing, and the art of self-defense, so that when he
ultimately emerges above ground, he would be prepared for
life among society.  What happens when the 35-year-old
Adam (Brendan Fraser) ascends and meets the modern
world--especially Eve (Alicia Silverstone) with whom he falls
in love--is the source of great fun and no
small amount of social satire.  </P>
<P>   Adam compares the people he meets with his own family
and decides that they have become mutated from the bomb. 
And no wonder.  One man shifts through garbage while
another throws up in the street.  What was once a fruit
orchard is now the home of a porn parlor.  The community is
full of strip malls and boarded-up stores.  He overcomes his
repulsion for post-nuclear humankind when he falls in love
and, as is the custom in any good romantic comedy, the
ardent couple must be kept apart until the end of the movie. 
This feat is accomplished by Eve's unwillingness to believe
that a guy so polite, so caring, so well-mannered can be real,
and by her inability to accept his naively boyish behavior.  </P>
<P>   Director Hugh Wilson milks the story for social
commentary, indicating the decline and fall of Western
civilization from 1962 to 1999.  As a microcosm of history, he
centers on Mom's Malt Shop which during the seventies turns
into a disco bar and ultimately into a bikers' saloon.  But
"Blast from the Past" is, fortunately, no exercise in cerebral
inquiry but a wonderfully inventive, original comedy with good
acting all around. Christopher Walken shines as the eccentric
Cal Tech professor-turned-inventor who has the foresight to
lock his family into the underground shelter for over three
decades, with Sissy Spacek his hand-wringing and not
altogether accepting wife.  The thirty-one-year old Brendan
Fraser continues to surprise his public with his breadth,
having turned in a crackerjack performance as a Neanderthal
youth in modern society in "Encino Man" and recently as a
guest in the home of horror-meister James Whaley in "Gods
and Monsters," knocking out a fine appearance as straight-
man to Ian McKellen's idiosyncratic gay director.  There's a
neat side role by Dave Foley as Troy, Eve's gay brother, who
is particularly sympathetic to Adam's fish-out-of-water
predicament and serves as Cupid to coax her sister into
Adam's arms.  The showstopping scene occurs on the dance
floor of the Club 40, where Adam naturally stands out,
vigorously and expertly taking on a couple of beautiful women
in some exuberant period steps.  "Blast from the Past" is
solid entertainment without a dull moment, good fun, and 
an effective rejoinder to "Pleasantville"'s championing of
modern times.</P>
