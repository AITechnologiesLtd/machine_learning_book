<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   A sight which never fails to affect me is the annual commemoratory
   gatherings of WWII veterans at war monuments.  It's been over fifty
   years since the curtain fell on the last Great War, and the young men
   who then risked life and limb to fight for their country are now
   aging seniors.  As their numbers dwindle with time and the ceremonies
   now barely rate a five-second blurb with the youth-obsessed media, I
   can't help but be terribly moved to witness these elderly men, in
   full uniform and decorated with ribbons and medals, ignoring the
   protests of their weary bodies as they march with fierce pride and
   solemnly salute their fallen comrades.  I'm overwhelmed with a sense
   of gratitude for the sacrifices and horrors to which these men have
   subjected themselves for the greater good, and saddened by the
   disinterest of the press and the public alike as indicated by the
   sparse attendance of the proceedings.  Shamefully, we have forgotten.
   Steven Spielberg's film, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, attempts to address
   this situation by honouring these valiant soldiers.</P>
<P>   A noble goal, to be sure, but good intentions don't necessarily
   translate into a good film; it's dangerous to fall into the trap of
   judging a film based upon the worthiness of its subject matter.  At
   its best, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is a staggering achievement of
   verisimilitude, recreating the stark terror of the battlefield as
   perhaps no film has ever done before.  Narratively symmetric, it
   opens with a washed-out shot of the stars and stripes fluttering in
   the wind, a present-day war cemetery sequence, and a spectacular
   half-hour battle scene, and closes with a reversal of the same
   elements, in effect coming full circle, although the picture's
   systematic emotional bombardment will undoubtedly result in the
   audience leaving the screening in a markedly different state of mind
   than that as they entered.</P>
<P>   The opening battle segment on the shores of Omaha Beach during the
   D-Day assault is particularly stunning, impressing at once the
   hellish atmosphere of mayhem and carnage, and perhaps most
   significantly, the notion of futility.  History informs us that we
   (referring to the Allied forces) won Omaha, and yet the film
   unblinkingly presents us to the chaos of our troops being mowed down
   in hails of bullets, shredded to pieces by explosives, blood and
   entrails splattering and spilling everywhere, with the cries and
   screams of the wounded and terrified only muted by detonations and
   the sound of ammunition tearing through flesh.  (Curiously enough,
   although SAVING PRIVATE RYAN barely straddled the line between an R
   and the dreaded NC-17 rating from the MPAA, in Ontario it's been
   designated with a relatively biteless rating of AA -- adult
   accompaniment required for under-14s, far weaker than the Rs
   inexplicably given for tame fare such as HIGH ART and HENRY FOOL.)
   Impeccably staged by Mr. Spielberg and captured with the stark,
   glamourless flavour of authentic combat footage by cinematographer
   Janusz Kaminski, the net effect is intensely assaulting and at once
   captures the immense suffering of the soldiers.</P>
<P>   The film wisely decides to forego introductions to the troops prior
   to the battle -- although we immediately latch upon the recognizable
   visage of our modern equivalent to the Jimmy Stewart-ish Everyman,
   Tom Hanks -- lending an unexpected sense of despair to the
   proceedings; not provided with the tools to be allowed to relate to
   the slaughtered onscreen victims as characters and heroes, we're
   forced to view them simply as men, and consequently the bitter
   sentiment of wasted lives is palpable.  Smartly, Mr. Spielberg never
   provides a malevolent close-up of the Axis snipers during the first
   half of this battle -- the Allieds are essentially being attacked by
   a faceless enemy -- and he refrains from indulging in emblematic
   jingoism, avoiding the blatant use of the hateful Nazi swastika until
   quite late in the game; from a larger, philosophical perspective,
   this was a just war, but strictly on the microscopic level of this
   battleground as inspected by this film, principles such as right and
   wrong, good and evil, and heroes and villains don't enter into the
   fray: both sides being humanized, these are men fighting just to stay
   alive.  When the Allied troops are able to topple the German
   stronghold, the mood isn't that of triumphant euphoria or jubilation,
   but of unadulterated relief.</P>
<P>   The Omaha segment is so impressively achieved that it almost seems
   curmudgeonly to point out how clunky the film's screenplay,
   particularly the dialogue, becomes during the middle segment as the
   plot unfolds before giving way to the extended closing battle
   sequence.  Assigned to locate and retrieve a Pvt. James Ryan in a
   goodwill mission, Cpt. John Miller (Mr. Hanks) and his men -- Sgt.
   Horvath (Tom Sizemore), Pvts. Reiben (Edward Burns), Jackson (Barry
   Pepper), Mellish (Adam Goldberg) and Caparzo (Vin Diesel), Medic Wade
   (Giovanni Ribisi), and later, a green translator, Cpl. Upham (Jeremy
   Davies) -- are sent behind enemy lines, and much moralizing and
   philosophizing is performed.  It's all well-intentioned but
   comparatively ineffective in terms of execution, rife with contrived,
   Oscar-ready outbursts of introspection, banter which neither sounds
   genuinely naturalistic nor adequately addresses the issues raised on
   any more than a surface level, and a propensity to lend unearned
   gravity to profundities which lean more towards hokiness than
   provocation.  There's also the problem of tone: the film clearly
   endeavours to capture the aura of a wartorn Europe as seen through
   the bleary eyes of our heroes, and yet two unnecessary comic bits are
   interjected which seem suited for sitcom-level storytelling; it's
   surprising that the film so willingly and needlessly undermines its
   achieved ambiance.  The film's middle stretch has interludes of
   dramatic interest and some thematic exploration, but it's hardly
   groundshattering material.</P>
<P>   SAVING PRIVATE RYAN's arduous middle section would probably be even
   more problematic if not for its direction.  I'm not convinced that
   Mr. Spielberg is The Great Filmmaker Of Our Time; he's indisputably
   made some Great Films (including JAWS, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, and
   SCHINDLER'S LIST), but, as I recently remarked to a colleague, in a
   reality where Martin Scorsese still walks the Earth, designating Mr.
   Spielberg as America's finest filmmaker (as Time Magazine recently
   declared) is sheer folly.  Nonetheless, he's a director of not
   inconsequential strengths, chief of which is his ability to elicit an
   emotional reaction from his audience; Mr. Spielberg can easily lay
   claim to the title of Master of Emotional Manipulation.  It's a trait
   most conducive to exploitation for this film's subject matter.  I
   appreciated the simple but effective manner of layering several
   voice-overs reading different condolence telegrams as the camera
   panned across a busy room to convey the enormity and tragedy of the
   war, and particularly liked the use of silence accompanying a bit
   with a secretary wordlessly shuffling between three letters and then
   rushing off to draw the attention of her supervisor.  With nary a
   word, the onscreen implications are brutally clear; indeed, what
   words are suitable for such a grievous loss?  It's a much more subtle
   touch than a later monologue by Harve Presnell (performed well,
   incidentally) involving a stirring letter reading.</P>
<P>   For the most part, the film eschews subtlety for the use of emblems,
   both literal and figurative.  Not only does SAVING PRIVATE RYAN open
   and close with a colour-muted shot of the American flag, its vibrancy
   literally drained from it, but it epitomizes in wholesome Pvt. Ryan
   (Matt Damon) the spirit of America; it's no accident that he's from
   Iowa, dead center in the heartland of America, and that his family
   background is in that most American of professions, farming.  (When
   Pvt. Ryan's mother appears onscreen, she's even in the kitchen --
   kudos to the filmmakers for the restraint of not depicting her baking
   an apple pie.)  When Cpt. Miller addresses Pvt. Ryan, particularly at
   a pivotal moment late in the film, he's essentially speaking to the
   audience.  However, the audience surrogate in the picture is not that
   of Pvt. Ryan, but of Cpl. Upham, a nervous wreck thrown into battle
   for the first time.  Like him, we're seeing the horrors of the war
   through startled, inexperienced and idealistic eyes, and consequently
   we're simultaneously dismayed and empathetic at his limited
   effectiveness as a soldier.  Though it was an interesting touch to
   encapsulate the entire conflict into a single scenario -- a German
   soldier killing a Jew as an American soldier stands by helplessly --
   I was most impressed with the film's cynical lesson about the
   consequences of moral righteousness at wartime, an unexpected bit of
   grimness atypical for a film in Mr. Spielberg's oeuvre (although it's
   disappointingly tempered and dulled by a cathartic counterresponse
   which, while audience-pleasing, plays false).</P>
<P>   While SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is far from flawless, during its best
   stretches there are moments of sheer visceral bravura.  Its
   recreation of battles, with the sea literally awash with blood and
   soldiers being slain with horrifying ease, is a testament to the real
   brutality of war.  It's a price which our WWII veterans paid on our
   behalf, and it's something that we should not forget.</P>

"...a first screenplay unaccompanied by a powerful agent or industry
