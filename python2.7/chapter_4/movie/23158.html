<P>Woody Allen can do no wrong? Wrong. But he's done right so many times 
that he is a beacon of filmmaking. As in "Sweet and Lowdown."</P>
<P>The picture relates and shows part of the life of Emmet Ray, a 
fabulous jazz guitar player of the early to mid- Thirties,  But the 
man never existed. He is an invention, a construction, a fabulation, 
even though several aspects of him and his life have been gathered 
from a number of stories about real musicians.</P>
<P>Telling the audience about Emmet are interspersed talking heads of 
real people, supposedly all jazz specialists. Some are indeed 
connoisseurs: Woody Allen himself, Ben Duncan, Nat Hentoff,  Douglas 
McGrath.  Others are not.</P>
<P>It is not something new for Woody. This work is the kissin' cousin of 
"Zelig," and of fantasies in which jazz or pop music plays a major 
role: "Radio Days," " Bullets Over Broadway," etc. It is also variant 
of the structure of "Broadway Danny Rose" whose life-story was told 
in reminiscences by showbiz people.</P>
<P>The fictional Emmet Ray was, by his own accounting and those of 
others, the second best jazz guitar player in the world, after the 
legendary  (and real) Django Reinhardt. Django was a gypsy, born in 
Belgium but a French star for all practical purposes. A childhood 
accident - a fire - had deprived him of three fingers in ome hand, 
yet his playing was stupendous. To this day, he is a deity, 
remembered by millions. His pieces are played by thousands (in Django 
style) in Reinhardt groups.</P>
<P>He was such a cult figure for Emmet that the latter fainted on the 
two occasions he was in the same place as the gypsy. (There's a 
wonderful twist on this late in the movie).</P>
<P>Emmet was all musician. Outside his performances he was not a model 
to follow. Indeed, "lowdown" fits him well. He was undependable and a 
pain for those who hired him to play. He always spent way above his 
means, and blithely even resorted to pimping to supplement his 
income. He was a kleptomaniac. He hustled people (as in a small-town 
amateur contest, shown in the movie). He drank a lot, did drugs .But 
he did have friends, including black musicians. He was totally 
oblivious of the color line.</P>
<P>His quirks included love of trains, train-yards, and  going to city 
dumps to shoot rats with a pistol. He liked elegant suits and 
expensive cars. (Note the gorgeous $4,000 big  Packard convertible, 
and enjoy the imaginative, Munchausen-like way he got the money for 
it!)</P>
<P>Above all, it is his obsession with Django that hovers around him 
from the first to the last scenes. But he was so good that his 
Django-mania becomes a wonderful reminder that true artists always 
want to surpass themselves. That one can be a scoundrel and an artist 
at the same time is a true-to-life leitmotif throughout the movie.</P>
<P>At some point, Emmet and his best pal are in Atlantic City for a gig. 
Girl-hunting on the boardwalk, they meet statuesque Ellie and her 
rather mousy friend, the laundress Hattie. Flipping a coin Emmet gets 
stuck with Hattie --who turns out to be mute and who will become his 
companion for a long stretch.</P>
<P>Her treatment in his hands is not exactly nice. Some people see in it 
a case of misogyny transferred from Woody to Emmet. I don't buy that. 
First because Woody's misogyny is no proven fact. Secondly because 
Emmet shows that everything about him is overshadowed, even 
preempted, by his love of music. What autobiographical sides of 
Woody's are obvious here are a passion for jazz and a passion for 
filmmaking.</P>
<P>Unlike so many Woody creatures, Emmet is the non-intellectual "par 
excellence." No metaphysics, no deep (or even shallow) thoughts. No 
developed language skills,  no culture other than musicianship. Emmet 
is an instinctive being. So are almost all others, including Hattie. 
Including too the gunman Al Torrio who later in the film becomes the 
lover of Emmet's wife. No, not Hattie, but socialite Blanche who 
likes to slum, thinks she is a writer, and entraps (or does she?) 
Emmet.</P>
<P>The movie's great joys are three. The structure. The superb hot jazz 
music. And the fantastic performance by Sean Penn. He is economical, 
non-flamboyant, not even terribly much developed (but what would 
there be to develop?), yet three-dimensional and unforgettable in his 
intensity with and for the guitar. He wears a funny little mustache 
which must be a reference to Django's own. (Several of Reinhardt's 
personal traits, such as undependability, have been worked into Ray's 
character).</P>
<P>Among the earliest pieces we hear are some Django recordings (four 
star stuff) and a splendid Howard Alden rendition of "Speak to Me of 
Love" (Parlez-moi d'Amour), a gem of a song made into a classic by 
the French singer Lucienne Boyer. There's irony in the early use of 
this first piece --whether planned or just a lucky choice I do not 
know. In either case, it is a fitting overture to a tale in which no 
one speaks of love, except for voiceless Hattie who speaks it with 
her face.</P>
<P>The ratio of thirty-four pieces to the movie's 95 minutes is 
heartwarming, a pleasure for all, a major treat for connoisseurs, a 
feast for those who, like Woody Allen, are enamored of such oldies.</P>
<P>And how magnificently does Emmet Ray play his guitar!  It goes 
without saying that it is not Sean Penn who makes the sounds. But he 
was coached to perfection by Dick Hyman and by virtuoso guitarist 
Howard Allen (whose playing we hear) so that his body language and 
his plucking fingers (shown in many closeups) look entirely genuine. 
What the movie does is to go back to the old-style special effects 
that fool you -- without computers or techno-tricks.</P>
<P>The acting by all is excellent, with top, Oscar-worthy honors going 
to  Sean Penn and Samantha Morton. She is another throwback, to the 
actresses of silent days. Which movie star she will remind you of 
depends on your familiarity with old cinema. In a juicy tidbit (and 
in-joke) Hattie is "discovered" by a Hollywood studio and given a bit 
part as Norma Talmadge's sister. It does not pan out.</P>
<P>It is worth noticing that Allen's visual strategy (aided by a great 
Chinese cinematographer who is not yet 40) includes the sparse use of 
closeups, perhaps in order to avoid thrusting emotions at the public, 
and to let it decide through the framing of people within contexts of 
period surroundings, mood and music. This adds to the fact that Woody 
Allen has made a work in which sights, and especially sounds, ought 
to enchant mature and/or informed audiences. In more than one sense, 
the older the listener, the better.</P>
