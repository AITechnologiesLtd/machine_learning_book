<PRE>                            DEEP RISING 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
            3 :-( :-( :-(  for not having enough monster suck</PRE>
<P>Cast: Treat Williams, Famke Janssen, Wes Studi, Kevin J. O'Connor,
Anthony Heald
Director: Stephen Sommers
Producers: John Baldecchi, Laurence Mark
Screenplay: Stephen Sommers</P>
<P>Whilst sitting through DEEP RISING, I began to wonder why I was feeling
so very comfortable on my cinema seat? Shouldn't I be on the edge,
feeling terrified or at least thrilled at the notion of a sea monster
devouring a ship full of passengers?</P>
<PRE>Theoretically ….yes, but I wasn't.</PRE>
<P>Then I realised that everyone in this ‘nobody' cast, was trying to be
either too smug or funny for my liking. Even in death, they seemed at
ease. Hardly, befitting men about to become monster chomp for members of
the squid family! Once this path is travelled, it is hard to recapture
the apical beat of growing suspense ie ALIENS, with too many lapses in
concentration to be able to sustain this thriller.</P>
<P>The passengers disappear before the terrorists board the ship. The
monster then decides to play ‘peek-a-boo' for a while, before
conveniently sucking the juices out of the baddies, leaving most of the
good guys intact. Full marks for an interesting computer generated
tentacle, but rather too reminiscent of the man eating plants from the
musical comedy, THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS. After this comparison how
can one take these tentacle-like-creatures seriously? So I just waited
out the end of this formulaic movie, with a regular pulse rate of sixty,
three yawns and a toilet break.</P>
<P>It is likely that the special effects department devoured a large chunk
of the budget, so it is not surprising that a relatively unknown cast
was hired. Then again, nobody famous would have signed on anyway. So the
solution to the problem, was simply to employ a Mel Gibson look-alike,
Indiana Jones wannabe hero (Trent Williams), and a Julia Roberts
identical (Famke Janssen). Both of whom, are overly cute with their
performance, and it is quite evident from their perky behaviour, that
they will not end up in the monster's belly.</P>
<P>An overly disappointing effort overall.</P>
