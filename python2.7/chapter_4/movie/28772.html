<PRE>THE MUMMY RETURNS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>THE MUMMY RETURNS, again directed by Stephen Sommers, is a film with a 
complex.  It's a relentless movie that seems in constant fear that if it 
ever slows down for a minute the entire audience will walk out.  Rarely 
pausing to smell the flowers or to provide the requisite motivation and 
background, the confusing story scurries around like the thousands of 
scorpions that take the place of Indiana Jones's snakes.</P>
<P>And speaking of Indiana Jones, the movie wants badly to morph into an 
Indiana Jones-type franchise, a movie it mimics constantly.  It also 
borrows liberally from the fight sequences of STAR WARS EPISODE I - THE 
PHANTOM MENACE and the creatures from GREMLINS.  Gone is the campy charm 
from the previous MUMMY.  Instead, we have lots of nifty computer 
generated effects and warriors and non-stop action.  This is the perfect 
movie for 12-year-old boys, since most have grown too sophisticated for 
Saturday morning cartoon mayhem.</P>
<P>The stars from last time are back.  Rick (Brendan Fraser) and Evie 
(Rachel Weisz) are now married and have an 8-year-old son, Alex (Freddie 
Boath).  Alex is a chip off the old block, curious and adventuresome 
like his parents.  This time Weisz gets many opportunities to flex her 
muscles, and she turns out to be a surprisingly credible action star.</P>
<P>Arnold Vosloo again plays the mummy Im-Ho-Tep.  Not content with a 
single villain, the sequel adds WWF's The Rock playing The Scorpion 
King, Im-Ho-Tep's competition.  Rick will have to take them both out or 
the world will end.  What seems to never end is the movie itself.  I 
lost count of the number of "endings" that were merely preludes to other 
fight sequences.</P>
<P>As a display of computer generated images, the movie does dazzle and 
impress.  It can also be imaginative with a Jules Verne inspired 
boat/dirigible being the most memorable.  </P>
<P>"You know," Rick confesses, "a couple of years ago, this would have 
seemed really strange to me."  That's the problem with the sequel.  
We've seen it all before.  The only idea that the director had for the 
sequel was "more."  More special effects and lots more fighting.  Its 
target audience will undoubtedly love it.</P>
<P>THE MUMMY RETURNS runs a long 2:01.  It is rated PG-13 for adventure 
action and violence and would be acceptable for kids around 11 and up.  
Younger ones could be severely frightened.</P>
