<P>Getting lost amid all the gross-out humor, sexual innuendo, and
potty-mouthed characters which fill our theaters and pass for modern day
entertainment, are the wholesome, family-oriented films the likes of
SHILOH 2.  This is a pity.  Families need and deserve films such as these
to help establish the qualities of morality, integrity, honesty, kindness,
and forgiveness that we'd like to think parents are teaching their
children.</P>
<P>Based on the award winning series of books by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor,
SHILOH 2 continues the telling of a simple story about a boy and his dog,
and the mean-spirited neighbor who threatens to come between them.</P>
<P>Whereas the first movie dealt with Marty's attempts to save Shiloh, a
precious, floppy-eared beagle, from his abusive owner, its sequel deals
with Marty's attempts to save Shiloh's former owner from himself.  Judd
Travers is an ill-tempered, antisocial man angered further by losing his
best hunting dog to Marty.  He is drinking heavily, driving erratically,
and generally terrorizing the surrounding community which gives him a wide
berth.</P>
<P>Marty begins to ask the question which becomes the dominant theme for the
film: "Can a person change?  If he is mean, is he mean forever?"</P>
<P>Writer Dale Rosenblum, who wrote the screenplay for the first SHILOH
movie, and director Sandy Tung (CONFESSIONS OF A SEXIST PIG) have brought
back most of the cast of the 1997 original film, including Michael
Moriarty as Ray Preston, Rod Steiger as kindly Doc Wallace, and Scott
Wilson as the ornery Judd Travers.</P>
<P>The younger cast members playing the roles of the Preston children have
been replaced.  Zachary Browne (TV's ER) takes over the role of Marty
Preston, the 12 year old owner of the most familiar beagle since Snoopy.</P>
<P>Most of the acting is adequate for the story, the standout exception
being Mr. Wilson's performance.  His realistic portrayal of the backwoods
curmudgeon gives the movie's message a depth of meaning that many other
moralistic films do not achieve.  Judd is not a stereotypical bad man.  He
is a bitter, unhappy, lonely soul who has never had a friend and has
little prospect of ever making one.</P>
<P>Some of the dialogue admittedly contains a few "groaners."  Marty, after
seeing Judd shoot a squirrel, indicating his lack of respect for the
hunting season, worriedly asks, "What if he makes it Shiloh season?"  The
movie also takes a while to get its legs under itself.  But once Marty
makes it his task to find out if Judd could ever stop being mean, the
story finds its pace and our interest.</P>
<P>Shiloh is no Lassie or Rin Tin Tin.  Those heroic dogs are often featured
as the most intelligent character appearing on their respective screens.
The dog in this film is less of a super-powered canine that saves the day
and more of a catalyst for the actions of the humans with whom he lives.</P>
<P>Thankfully, the filmmakers also refrained from churning out an
unrealistic fable where a bad man is miraculously made good overnight.
Judd initially rebukes Marty's intentions, and later ignores his further
attempts of friendship.  It is going to take a great deal of perseverance
and a gargantuan effort on Marty's part to break through Judd's crusty
shell and inspire a behavioral change.</P>
<P>It will be hard... But it is not impossible.  All of us are asked to
change on a daily basis.  We are to continually "put off" our "old man
nature" and renew ourselves according to the standard of righteousness.</P>
<P>"You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your
old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; be made new
in the attitude of your minds; to put on the new self." Ephesians 4:22-24a
[NIV]</P>
<P>As Marty learns, this is not something that happens overnight.  It takes
a great deal of commitment, perseverance, and an unwillingness to settle
for less.  It requires a daily decision to change bad or spiritually
unhealthy habits by adopting new and godly habits to take their place.
We could all use some of Marty's driving determination at times in order
to be successful.  Or perhaps we just need to have a love for someone
other than ourselves to motivate us to be better.</P>
