<PRE>                         DAS BOOT (DIRECTOR'S CUT)
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>This review is about the new (1997) Director's Cut but will of
necessity be mostly about the original film which we saw in 1982.</P>
<P>Originally, the 1982 film was shown on German TV in a six-hour
mini-series.  It was then released in about a 2-hour version and
arrived in the United States . . . but not without a lot of trepidation
on the part of director and producers.  Here was a film with German
subtitles. Subtitles take a beating with the U.S. public.  Even more
worrisome the film was about German submariners, the enemy that
torpedoed many an Allied ship and convoy.  How would that be received?
It turned out to be THE all-time biggest box office hit of any foreign
language film.</P>
<P>To those of us who saw the original, that was not a surprise.  I cannot
recall a more intense film ever among the thousands of films I have
attended.  The acting was superb, the claustrophobia was palpable, the
fear that these young, mostly 17 to 18-year-old sailors would drown was
immense.  Who would have expected that any film could make us root for
the survival of German submariners on a mission to blow up Allied
ships?  That is proof of the strength of this most powerfully emotional
film.</P>
<P>It is 1941 when the Allies have finally gotten the upper hand in the
air and in reversing the havoc their ships had experienced until now.
Germany now had few planes, and few ships.  In a bar in port, there
are many sailors enjoying their last night before sailing.  Everything
goes.  Drunkenness and women.  Tomorrow, who knows?</P>
<P>A Captain of a sub enters, almost dead drunk.  He makes a speech and
toast to "our wonderful Fuehrer who knows everything including all
about submarines."  This is obviously sarcasm.  In the film, there is
only one officer who is political and believes that Hitler is right.
The rest are there because they were drafted.  They want to do their
tours of duty and then get back home to their loved ones.</P>
<P>The film is about the submarine U-96, its Captain (played heroically by
Jyrgen Prochnow), and his crew.  They are on a mission to sink British
ships but the Captain knows that the British destroyers are now
equipped with Sonar devices that can locate with deadly accuracy the
whereabouts of submarines and when they drop their depth charges, they
know how deep they must go before exploding and destroying the subs.</P>
<P>Almost everything that can happen to a submarine takes place on this
one and it is nail-biting time almost from the start until its
surprising finish.</P>
<P>Which brings us back to the Director's Cut.  The film has had better
sound added (digital) and extra footage. This additional footage
lingers more on the sailors and tries to show more of what they are
experiencing.  There is no question that the new sound and footage are
beneficial, although the original was itself sheer perfection.</P>
<P>Now then, the down side.  The original DAS BOOT kept us in a sweat
precisely because we did not know what was going to happen next.  Could
the bolts that were popping from the severe pressure be replaced so the
water could be stopped from drowning the ship and crew?  Could the
ship be raised when it dives way down to avoid the depth charges?  How
will they make out when the ship is ordered to pass thru the narrow
Straits of Gibraltar where there are hundreds of Allied ships on the
lookout?</P>
<P>That is what gets lost in this new version if you have seen the
original.  If you have, you know what happens next, you know how the
film ends, so I would question if there is a real value in seeing the
3-hour-plus Director's Cut.  If, of course, you have NOT seen the
original, you had better get to this one; a most marvelous, exciting
film, ranking with THE most anti-war films ever made.</P>
<P>The cast of supporting actors, all wonderful, consists among others, of
Herbert Grshemeyer, Klaus Wennemann.</P>
