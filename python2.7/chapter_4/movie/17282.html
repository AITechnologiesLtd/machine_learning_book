<P>Wishmaster
* * * * out of * * * *
Rated R for strong horror violence and gore, and for language.
Wes Craven produced this stylish, well-made, and extremely gory, and great
movie. When I first saw this, my expectations were low, because people had said
it was pretty bad. But I must say, it exceded my expectations, and was a good,
scary, and gory movie. Well-worth the watch, Wishmaster has become to me, a
camp classic, and one of my favorites.</P>
<P>The movie starts out about 3,000 years ago, and gives us a message on what
Djinn's are. What is a Djinn? Read on and you will learn. In the opening
sequence, an ancient king has wished to have the best party in history. Well
the Djinn (Played devilishly good by Andrew Divoff) is best described as a
smarta--, and the wishes he grants backfires on the people who are wishing it.
In this case, all the people at the party come to gruesome deaths, some turn
into lizards, another has his skeleton come completely out of his skin, and his
skeleton walks around attacking people. Another has something coming out of his
stomach, and one gets smacked against the wall. The wizard, comes in and tells
the king to stop before he makes his last wish, which would make the Djinn be
able to take over the world. The wizard takes the jewel (too which the Djinn
lives) and commands he goes back in, he does, and stays there for 3,000 years.</P>
<P>Then we see a statue, being delivered to a man named Raymond Beaumont (Robert
Englund, best known as Freddy Kruegar). He has bought a new statue to put in
his collection at his museum-house. While the statue is being lowered, the
crane operator spills his coffee on the controls, and drops the statue on a man
below, causing it to bust in pieces. One of the construction workers spots a
jewel, and takes it out and puts it in his pocket. </P>
<P>The man brings the jewel to a museum to which Alexander Amberson (Tammy Lauren)
works. She investigates the jewel, and tries to find out how old the jewel
itself is. She asks her friend Chris Lemmon (Nick Merrit), a jewel anologist to
find out how old, and what kind of jewel it is. When he puts the jewel into the
computer to be analyzed the laser hitting ther jewel causes the jewel to
explode as well as the cpu, and injures Chris. The Djinn is now released, and
asks Chris, if he wants the pain to go away, Chris wishes it away, and it does,
but so does Chris's life. The Djinn is now free to find the one that released
him to which that is Alexandra.</P>
<P>He takes human form as Nathaniel Demerest, and goes out to ask people what they
wish to do or not to do. And if they wish, they die. Say one wishes that his
enemy would get cancer, and he grants his wish, and his enemy dies of cancer. A
woman, wishes that she would have eternal beauty, and turns into a manequinn. </P>
<P>The Djinn, who was released by Alexandra, makes her see all that he does. If he
kills she sees, if they wish she sees, and has to live it all up. She has to
proctect herself, as well as her sister from this evil Djinn, and try to make
him not take over the world. Nathaniel, then goes to the party to which Raymond
is at, and of course Raymond wishes to have a party that will go down in
history, and he does (I wont spoil it). Alexandra must now, find out how to
defeat this Wishmaster without dying herself, or her friends. Her final thought
of defeating him is brilliant.</P>
<P>As is the movie, I found myself entertained to the limit. I found no flaws, no
gratitous gore, and no dumb story. Andrew Divoff who plays Wishmaster, and
Nathaniel Demerest, does a brilliant performance, and w wicked one at that. And
really gets into his performance, mixing wit with terror. As does Tammy Lauren,
she does a great job as her character, and gets realistically into it. Robert
Englund (Who as always) plays his character well.</P>
<P>As the movie itself? It had some great suspense sequences, most coming toward
the end, and a really high count of graphic violence/gore. But what got me the
most, was how fun the movie was. It was never flawed, never boring, nor was it
stupid. The make-up effects on Andrew Divoff, spectacular. And the gore
effects, with people being ripped open, and one gets his mouth ripped off, this
is definately not for the squeamish. But, But, If you are a horror fan, who
loves fun movies, this is one for you, believe me, I dont think youll be let
down.</P>
<PRE>Just great!!</PRE>
