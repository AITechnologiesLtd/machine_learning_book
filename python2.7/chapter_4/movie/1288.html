<PRE>                          THE LAWNMOWER MAN
                    A review in the public domain
                            by The Phantom
                           (<A HREF="mailto:sbb@panix.com">sbb@panix.com</A>)</PRE>
<P>     The Phantom should know by now what to expect when Stephen King's
name is on the marquee: perhaps the worst theatrically-released horror
or science fiction of the year.  Although occasionally a talented
filmmaker will successfully adapt a Stephen King short story or novel --
Rob Reiner has done wonders with two of King's stories so far, and Brian
DePalma made a name both for himself and for King with his adaptation of
CARRIE -- we will more often get anything from the forgettable RUNNING
MAN to the terrible GRAVEYARD SHIFT to the absolute nadir of King
adaptations, MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE, directed by the master of horror himself
who apparently spared no effort in proving that a good writer does not a
talented filmmaker make.</P>
<P>     With THE LAWNMOWER MAN, King's name returns once again to the top
of the marquee, and it was with some trepidation that the Phantom
ventured into the Ziegfeld theater in New York (perhaps the largest and
most lavish movie theater on the East Coast) to see what looked as if it
might be a cross between a very vague memory of an old Stephen King
short story and the result of an Amiga run amok.  At the very least, the
Phantom reasoned, the film's extensive computer graphics would be shown
to best advantage on a screen big enough that it should have its own zip
code; the unavoidable downside of having Pierce Brosnan's unshaven face
looming fifty feet high above the Phantom for the bulk of the film's 100
minutes didn't occur to him until it was too late to sneak out and still
get a refund.</P>
<P>     But that unshaven face should have given the Phantom pause, for
although computer graphics are sprinkled liberally throughout the film,
the majority of screen time is occupied by Mr. Brosnan and his
inability to act.  He and his thespian disability share the screen every
so often with his incredibly cheesy-looking laboratory, which appears
for all the world to be nothing more than a parking garage with some
neon lights and two of those gizmos that David Letterman had on his show
some time back -- the ones that let you rotate yourself through 360
degrees in 3 dimensions.  The Phantom kept eager eyes peeled for the
Velcro wall or perhaps a large vat filled with shaving cream; after all,
although the Phantom has made the acquaintance of a computer or two in
his time, he's a novice when it comes to the exciting and
ever-so-interesting world of virtual reality and all the props that
world apparently requires.</P>
<P>     Mr. Brosnan and his stubble, you see, have invented a way to use
virtual reality to make people smarter.  At least the Phantom believes
that was his intention, as no one in the film behaves very intelligently
either in or out of virtual reality.  There is a fairly bright-looking
chimpanzee at the beginning of the film, but he's quickly dispatched,
most likely due to the "Don Johnson-look" clause in Mr. Brosnan's
contract: no one in THE LAWNMOWER MAN is allowed to have more facial
hair than the star of the film.  Later, and for a very brief time, a
complete idiot -- the "lawnmower man" of the title -- does seem to dress
somewhat better than he used to, and he does get to make love to an
incredibly bad actress, but he never seems very much brighter than he
did at the beginning of the film.  In fact, after that chimpanzee, it's
pretty much all down hill in the intelligence department.</P>
<P>     As it happens, THE LAWNMOWER MAN isn't really about virtual reality
or the possibility of using computer technology to help people
understand better the world around them; instead, it's just another
"scientist's good intentions cause catastrophic results when his little
refrigerated bottles of colored liquid fall into the wrong hands" flick,
with some 3-D video games, evil government agents, and megalomania
thrown in both indiscriminately and ineffectively.</P>
<P>     And yet THE LAWNMOWER MAN has done fairly well at the box office,
which can only mean that not everyone shares the Phantom's belief that
it is a fundamentally dishonest and mean-spirited film.  In the
Phantom's mind, this can only be attributed to the "My Little Pony"
effect, except here with computer graphics for the techno-geeks instead
of cloyingly cute pink ponies for 8-year-old girls.  There is a sizable
audience who will see -- and, apparently, enjoy -- anything at all with
computer graphics in it, just as there is a sizable number of
undiscriminating 8-year-old girls who will gladly coerce their parents
into attending MY LITTLE PONY: THE MOTION PICTURE.  Of course, the
salient difference is that those in the audience for the plastic
figurine's adventures are children, whereas those in the audience for
the R-rated LAWNMOWER MAN are supposed to be adults, and so should know
better by now.</P>
<P>     Films produced around computer graphics have had exceedingly poor
track records: of TRON, THE LAST STARFIGHTER, and THE LAWNMOWER MAN, one
would be hard-pressed to pick the one that's well off the "stupid" scale
that we reviewers always keep in mind once the auditorium lights dim.
(Just for reference: CITIZEN KANE is a 0 and HUDSON HAWK rings the
bell.)  In each case, the filmmakers apparently labored under the
mistaken belief that computer graphics would keep us mesmerized long
enough that we wouldn't notice how very silly or unoriginal the rest of
film was.  Yet when used sparingly, or with the grace and wit of the
artists at Pixar, computer graphics can provide a film with truly
breathtaking moments.  If asked what they think is the most memorable
scene in BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, many people mention the show-stopping
ballroom scene -- a scene that could have been animated only through the
use of carefully designed computer graphics.  Likewise, it's neither
Schwarzenegger nor the near-ceaseless violence that captured people's
imagination and caused audible gasps in the audience for TERMINATOR 2;
instead, it was the liquid-metal and optical effects provided courtesy
of extensive and ground-breaking computer graphics.</P>
<P>     But stripped of grace, wit and restraint, films that feature
computer graphics for their own sake are anything from trite, to dull,
to ridiculous.  It is in just this way that THE LAWNMOWER MAN seemed to
the Phantom to have quite a bit in common with "My Little Pony" -- in
both cases, a cynical attempt was made to capture audience dollars by
using poorly and unimaginatively a technique that could be used well and
with care.  And, alas, in both cases that attempt appears to have paid
off handsomely -- something that can do nothing but encourage future
attempts to cash in on some people's undiscriminating need to see
extended toy commercials or numbingly uninspired computer graphics in
the service of an even less inspired film.</P>
<P>     The possibilities of virtual reality have best been covered by
William Gibson's "cyber-punk" novels; perhaps someday someone will turn
his excellent NEUROMANCER or COUNT ZERO into a feature film.  In the
meantime, we have only the efforts of Brett Leonard and Gimel Everett,
who wrote and directed THE LAWNMOWER MAN as if they never had even the
slightest intention of exploring the concept of virtual reality.
Instead, every time the plot takes us inside the artificial world in
which Brosnan and his subject frequently lose themselves, all we get are
3-D video games, a strange and unlikely combination of TRON and FROM
BEYOND, and of course some obligatory cybersex, just to earn that
R-rating.  (FRITZ THE CAT this is not; FELIX THE CAT more closely
approximates the level of this film.)  And as anyone familiar with the
prop-laden world of virtual reality knows, one can only enter said world
if one is whirling about like a human gyroscope and covered from head to
toe in a rubber suit.  The actors do this quite a lot in the film, so
phans may wish to arm themselves with Dramamine beforehand.</P>
<P>     When not spinning about in Mr. Brosnan's contraptions, the
characters become involved in unlikely plot developments concerning "The
Shop" -- the only element of the film that is recognizably "from the
mind of Stephen King" -- and Brosnan's personal life (his wife walks out
of the film early on, and phans would be wise to note her behavior in
case they find themselves at a showing of THE LAWNMOWER MAN against the
Phantom's best recommendations).  We also witness the evolution of the
"lawnmower man" from slow-witted gardener to Megalomaniacal genius (at
one point Brosnan notes that he'd become smarter than Brosnan himself --
something that perhaps seemed more shocking in the script than it did on
the screen, given Brosnan's performance).  Along the way he dispatches
several people, each of whom dies an updated version of an 80s-style
Jasonized death.  Some die in computationally expensive ways, which
surely pleased the techno-geeks in the audience.  One dies after he is
chased out of his house by a lawnmower in a scene which perfectly
captures the film's level of plausibility.  Another staggers around in a
daze after hearing "Now The Lawnmower Man is inside your head --
forever!"; after the end titles rolled, the Phantom knew just how he
must have felt.</P>
<P>     So as not to make this a completely negative review, and to redeem
himself for the review's extreme tardiness, the Phantom will note that
all of this was done long ago -- and done much better -- by Ken Russell
in his extraordinarily loopy (but very enjoyable) 1980 film ALTERED
STATES.  Russell used a sensory deprivation tank and magic mushrooms
instead of rubber suits and gyroscopes, but the idea was the same, and
the film -- while not precisely a paragon of logic -- was at least
entertaining.  (There's also something to be said for watching William
Hurt -- in his screen debut -- wake up naked surrounded by baboons in a
zoo.  Now no matter how pretentious he becomes, we can always remind him
of his rather less-than-Shakespearean beginnings.  Only Jane Fonda has
more to live down....)</P>
<P>     Of course, much of the sensory-assaulting special effects will be
lost on the small screen, but phans will still be much happier watching
this typically over-the-top Russell exercise in alternate realities than
they will watching yet another in a depressingly long list of failed
films about computers.  HAL, where are you now that we really need you?</P>
