<P>     In the midst of the Great Depression, in the city of St. Louis,
the family of Aaron Kurlander (Jesse Bradford) is falling apart.  His
little brother has been shipped off to live with an uncle, his sick
mother (Lisa Eichhorn) has been admitted to a sanitarium, and his
father (Jeroen Krabbe) must go on the road to make money.  So Aaron is
left on his own in a fleabag hotel, with no money and few friends.
Life becomes a struggle for the twelve year old--the hotel wants to
evict him and his meager supply of food is running dangerously low--and
it's only through his remarkable resourcefulness that he manages to
survive.</P>
<P>     Rarely has 1933 St. Louis been so real.  Steven Soderbergh (best
known for his debut feature SEX, LIES, AND VIDEOTAPE) has taken the
time and effort necessary to bring the period to life with
uncompromising accuracy.  Many period pieces give only token
acknowledgment to the era in which they take place, but KING OF THE
HILL has the Great Depression woven inextricably throughout.  Flawless
detail is an undeniable asset.</P>
<P>     1993 has seen movie after movie featuring boys struggling to reach
maturity while discovering an identity.  AMERICAN HEART, THIS BOY'S
LIFE, and SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER are a few of the better ones, but
none is as impressive as KING OF THE HILL, perhaps because none has
quite as simple a tale to tell.  The film is what it claims to be:  a
series of interrelated reminiscences about the life of an abandoned
child in the midst of one of this nation's most difficult times.</P>
<P>     There is much in KING OF THE HILL to enthrall.  The
characters--even those we don't see much of--are rich, and the
situations are, for the most part, entirely believable (I had a little
trouble with a scene involving a runaway car, but that was the only
sequence that struck a false note).  Soderbergh has carefully developed
this movie to draw out the drama without resorting to tired plot
devices.  The fact is, Aaron's story, no matter how plain it might
initially seem, is powerful in its simplicity.</P>
<P>     Of course, to do justice to the plot, an effective young actor was
needed to play Aaron.  Jesse Bradford's performance is natural and
unforced and we never get the sense that he's doing more than reacting
to circumstances.  The film revolves around Aaron, and Bradford is up
to the task, regardless of the complexity of the emotions he is
expected to show.  Take, for example, the touching, bittersweet
relationship that develops between Aaron and a lonely, epileptic girl
living down the hall.  The resonance of scenes with these two is
remarkable.</P>
<P>     While no one else has nearly as much screen time as Bradford, the
young actor has established actors supporting him.  Foremost are Jeroen
Krabbe and Lisa Eichhorn as Aaron's father and mother, each of whom
does a fine job with their material.  Krabbe comes across as concerned
for his children, but painfully distracted by financial difficulties.
Eichhorn takes pains to bring sympathetic realism to a small role.</P>
<P>     Adrien Brody gives an energetic performance as Lester, Aaron's
best friend and mentor.  Noted monologist Spalding Gray plays an
intelligent, frustrated middle-aged man whose relationship with a
prostitute (Elizabeth McGovern) Aaron has difficulty categorizing.  The
two are obviously intimate, yet they appear to have only contempt for
one another.  McGovern, like Karen Allen as Aaron's teacher, is
underused.</P>
<P>     It's amazing how something so deceptively uncomplicated can be so
effective.  The narrative is relatively straightforward; Soderbergh
doesn't employ any unusual chronologies.  His style is frank, not
quirky, and lends itself to a number of powerful images:  a starving
boy cutting out pictures of food and serving them on a plate, a
homeless man waving hello, a puddle of blood-tainted water seeping from
underneath a closed door.</P>
<P>     As in life, there are a few unanswered questions at the end of
KING OF THE HILL, but most of these deal with peripheral issues and in
no way detract from the satisfaction imparted by the film.  Done with
less mastery, this could have been just another run-of-the-mill coming
of age story.  However, with Soderbergh at the helm (confirming the
ability he showed in SEX, LIES & VIDEOTAPE which some thought might
have been a flash in the pan after the disappointing follow-up of
KAFKA), this becomes a remarkable odyssey about a resilient young hero
who uses both his imagination and his sense of reality to survive.</P>
