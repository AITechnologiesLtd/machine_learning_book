                       Film reviews by Craig Good
                        Copyright 1992 Craig Good</PRE>
<P>     This weekend turned into a Jack Nicholson/J. T. Walsh Film Festival
for me.  I saw HOFFA on Christmas night, and I just got back from seeing
A FEW GOOD MEN.  If all you want is a horse race, then it's A FEW GOOD
MEN by a length.</P>
<P>     I'm ambivalent about HOFFA.  I'm still impressed with DeVito the
director, and all the performances are good.  It's obvious that Jaaaack
relished his role.  The production is well mounted, and the scope is
broad.  Mamet's dialogue is his usual combination of genius and
expletives.  But HOFFA faces the same challenge as films such as THE
GODFATHER and GOODFELLAS: to make us care about people who are
criminals and creeps.  The Godfather films all succeeded.  For me,
GOODFELLAS failed.  I put HOFFA somewhere in the middle.  I came away
with the feeling that I was now fairly knowledgeable about someone who is
still somewhat of an enigma.</P>
<P>     The film is told in flashbacks and has a mostly chronological
structure.  The mere chronicling of Jimmy Hoffa's career is almost
enough enough structure for a story.  Almost.  HOFFA isn't so much a
story as it is a biography.  And while the film didn't try to whitewash
the man, I sensed some sort of misplaced admiration for him.  Perhaps
that was simply the primary symptom of its failure.  But it is a good
movie, and people who liked BUGSY and GOODFELLAS will probably enjoy
it.</P>
<P>     I'm happy to report after seeing his latest that Rob Reiner's
stunning track record as a director is unsullied.  Everybody connected
with A FEW GOOD MEN delivers, and nobody disappoints.  The performances
by Cruise, Moore, and Nicholson reminded me just why they are big name
stars.  Cruise's disarming performance allows us to watch an
intelligent, if at first slothful, character in the process of thinking,
and Moore proves that she's not just the pretty girl who can cry on cue.
Jack's part in A FEW GOOD MEN is smaller in screen time than in HOFFA,
but he practically *is* the third act.  This is a solid *story*, and
Cruise's character walks away a much different man than the one at the
start of the film.  </P>
<P>     If you still haven't figured out the J. T. Walsh reference, it's
because he has supporting roles in both films.</P>
<PRE>     To sum up: If you've a mind to see both films, see them both.  If
you need to narrow your choices, see A FEW GOOD MEN.</PRE>
