<PRE>Alien: Resurrection - More Ooze, Less Aaahs
by Homer Yen
(c) 1997</PRE>
<P>Will moviegoers ever get enough of these space creatures whose best
attributes are showing off their exceptionally sharp teeth and oozing
slime?  Not yet, it seems.  But that's ok, because this fourth
installment shows signs of life, and once again brings to us the macho
Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and pits her against those familiar
goo-dripping, acid-for-blood aliens.  </P>
<P>Science-fiction gives writers the latitude to come up with wacky
premises, and the premise here is certainly odd.  Despite its
viciousness and primal urge to kill, it turns out that some people are
enamored with this species and hope to breed more of them.  A complete
explanation is never really given, it may be a secret government
operation or a plan hatched by terrorists.  However, we are made aware
of a couple things.  All of the action will take place on a spaceship,
replete with the obligatory warehouse-like setting, dimly lit
corridors, and smoke billowing out from every angle.  Ripley is a
clone of the original (who died in Aliens3) who has heightened senses
(she can smell the presence of aliens) and some memories of her former
life, realizing all too well the dangerous implications of breeding
such a savage species.  Also, it won't be too long, despite careful
attempts to contain the aliens, before they will escape and run
rampant through the spaceship that carries them.  Their infestation is
actually startling.  As they begin to run amuck, the ships computer
states: "non-human elements detected on levels 2, 4, 5, 9..." and so
forth while the crew frantically makes their way into the escape pods.</P>
<P>However, as this genre mandates, there must be at least a handful of
people who have yet to escape.  Those still on-board include the
Ripley clone and an assorted bunch of grizzled space dogs, including
Call (Winona Ryder).  Naturally, there is no easy way off, and for
them, things will get much worse before it gets better. </P>
<P>The true stars in this movie, however, are the aliens and the special
effects people that created them.  They are incredible to look at.  An
especially fine scene involves an underwater chase, where the aliens
swim in pursuit of their victims, subsequently climb a ladder and then
dodge bullets being fired upon them.  They are intelligent, merciless,
and genuinely imposing.  Less impressive though is the Ripley clone.
While she embodies the toughness of a soldier and the tenderness of a
human, the clone's persona displays a sense of annoying apathy.  She
blurts out cynical sound bites and laughs at the weakness of mankind.
Also, Ryder is a strange addition to this kind of movie.  Though she
is a wonderful actress, she lacks the heft and presence to stand
alongside Ripley and the other crew members.  </P>
<P>My feelings about this movie were undoubtedly mixed.  While I enjoyed
the beauty of the aliens, the moderate amount of excitement and the
enormous amounts of slime, Ripley's sense of detachment alienated me,
and soon, I found myself less interested in the final result and more
interested in seeing more aliens.  But I suppose that if the focus of
the movie was actually on Ripley, the title of the film would have
been called "Ripley: Resurrection."</P>
