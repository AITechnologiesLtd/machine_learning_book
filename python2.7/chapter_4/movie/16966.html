<P>Mike Judge, the man behind the infinitely stupid and funny BEAVIS & BUTTHEAD
animated series, jots down his first live-action movie, based on his
infamous "Milton" sketches from TV's "Saturday Night Live", and helms the
picture to boot. This movie is made for anyone who has ever worked in a
Dilbert-type office environment, hates their job, and doesn't mind laughing
at it all.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A guy working in a run-of-the-mill tech company hates his job. After some
help from a relaxation expert, the guy develops the capacity to become
indifferent to his stress, and ironically lands himself a position of higher
power. But when his friends are slated for downsizing, our boy and his
buddies decide to get even with a half-assed money-making virus scheme.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
This movie has many chuckles, some laugh out loud scenes, other shrugs of
the shoulder, in a humorous and poignant office setting, which touches upon
much of the inhumanity and hypocrisy that permeates the high-tech cubicles
environments of our day. I personally saw MUCH of myself in the main
character, since I, much like him, find myself wondering about the worth of
my cubey-employment every other high-tech-flying day. I sense this capacity
to identify with the main characters in this film, as a strong correlation
point to your appreciation of the humor within. And it is within that
environment that the authenticity and parody of the actual office rapport,
the insincere stooge bosses, the phony empowerment signs all over the walls,
and the daily frustrations that people face with the technological office
"advancements", were all dead-on perfect!</P>
<P>Having said all that, the plot of the film itself is actually quite thin,
with an irrelevant and cheesy romance with Jennifer Aniston (wasted in this
role) tossed in for effect. I would have liked to have seen more office
scenarios and incidents, as opposed to the last third of the film, which
essentially down-shifts into a semi-crime caper. The actors were all very
good with Ron Livingston playing an excellent laid-back dude, and his Bill
Gates Jr. buddy coming through as the geek with the love for the gangsta
rap. All in all, I would recommend this movie to all people who live, or
have survived, this kind of an office environment, are looking for a light
comedy, and don't mind a thin plot. Either way, always try to remember that
WORKS SUCKS!</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Director Mike Judge apparently plays the role of Jennifer Aniston's idiot
manager at Chotchkie's in this film. He was born in Guayaquil, Ecuador.
A nod to actor Ron Livingston's better-known role in SWINGERS (9/10), comes
by the way of a button on Jennifer Aniston's restaurant costume which reads
"We're not in Kansas anymore". An infamous line from the film featuring the
then-unknown Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau.
The guy playing the spectacled-nerd in this film, David Herman, has directed
two documentaries of his own. He's also done voices for the Mike
Judge-created TV series "King of the Hill".
The real-life Milton in this film, Stephen Root, has also done voices for
"King of the Hill", and might be better known as his character of Jimmy
James from TV's "NewsRadio". He's also had plenty of movie appearances in
such films as BLACK RAIN, GHOST and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.
Actor Gary Cole, who plays the condescending boss in this film, also played
the role of Mike Brady, father of the Brady's, in both of THE BRADY BUNCH
movies.
Paul Willson, who plays the second "Bob" consultant in this film, may be
best remembered as Paul, the character that he played in the wildly
successful TV sitcom "Cheers". He was the "other fat guy", besides Norm.
Goofy neighbor Diedrich Bader plays Oswald Harvey on TV's "The Drew Carey
Show".</P>
