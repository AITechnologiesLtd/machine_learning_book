<PRE>ARTEMISIA
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     ARTEMISIA, the purportedly true story of Artemisia Gentileschi, a
seventeenth century Roman artist who was the first female member of the
Academy in Florence, suffers from the same confusion of purpose that a
similar film, DANGEROUS BEAUTY, did earlier this year.  DANGEROUS
BEAUTY, which featured a high paid poet-prostitute from the same period
and area, tried to emphasize its credentials as a statement about female</P>
<P>independence in a male dominated world, but spent most of time in
various sexual encounters.</P>
<P>     So it is with ARTEMISIA, which starts off well by considering the
hardships of becoming a respected artist, especially a female one, in
1670.  The film immerses us in the minutia of painting from the
preparation of the paints to the setting of the scenery scaffolding to
the art of choosing just the right naked body to paint.  (Nope, that
one's too skinny.  Breasts are too large on that one.  His rear's all
wrong.)</P>
<P>     When we first meet Artemisia, she is taking off her clothes.  With
a handheld mirror she examines and sketches every part of the female
anatomy.  One of the biggest barriers to Artemisia's success in the art
world, however, was that women were not permitted by the Pope to paint
nude males.  You can probably guess that she will entice a friend to
take his clothes off and that there will eventually be a big trial where</P>
<P>the charge of painting the male genitalia is brought against our
heroine.  DANGEROUS BEAUTY followed a similarly predictable path.</P>
<P>     Valentina Cervi plays Artemisia with an earnest and unvarying
composure.  Her father Orazio, played by Michel Serrault from NELLY &
MONSIEUR ARNAUD, does not approve of the nightly debauchery of his
fellow artists.  He complains that their life consists of "painting
saints by day and sinning by night."  Artemisia loves to peer in the
open window at night to watch dozens of naked men and women groping each</P>
<P>other.  (There's an artist on hand to record their proclivities.)</P>
<P>     Orazio, a painter of some considerable repute himself, introduces
his daughter to Agostino Tassi (Miki Manojlovic) to learn more about
painting.  The virginal Artemisia and Agostino soon become lovers, much
to the father's dismay.  Neither member of this love affair demonstrates</P>
<P>any genuine passion.  Both of the actors give a rather distant and
ethereal reading of their parts, artistic and sexual.</P>
<P>     The movie spends most of the time drifting along aimlessly.
Director Agnes Merlet sets a languid pace that would be in danger of
putting the audience to sleep were it not for the frequent nudity and
sex. But even with the full-frontal male and female nudity, the sex is
as cold as a picture from some cheesy soft porn magazine so some may
still find themselves nodding off.</P>
<P>     Although the painting aspect is undeniably interesting, the story
wastes most of its time with sexual titillation.  Why can't we have a
film about a woman from that era who prospers without the need for
constant disrobing?</P>
<P>     ARTEMISIA runs 1:38.  The movie is in French with English
subtitles.  It is not rated but would probably be an R for complete
nudity, sex, profanity, and brief violence and would be acceptable for
older and mature teenagers.</P>
