<PRE>                            LEGENDS OF THE FALL
                       A film review by Jon A. Webb
                        Copyright 1995 Jon A. Webb</PRE>
<P>     Because I am married, sometimes I have to see films that I'm pretty
sure I'm not going to like.  Such is the case with LEGENDS OF THE
FALL, which seeks to cash in on Brad Pitt's status as the new
"murderously handsome" young male star.  But at least I get to write
this review.</P>
<P>     The story is, as I think the New Yorker put it, a kind of Monty
Python version of "Bonanza."  A father (played by Anthony Hopkins),
with a commendably strong sense of justice and minority rights,
especially in those days, has three sons, at least one of whom (Brad
Pitt) looks adopted, or perhaps the secret cause of the estrangement
between husband and wife.  They live on a range at the base of some
really impressive mountains that I think we don't get to see enough of
(given the senselessness of the rest of the movie.)</P>
<P>     One of the sons (played by Aidan Quinn) brings home a beautiful
fiancee, played by Julia Ormond, and she stays on to totally wreck the
somewhat peaceful if odd family life formerly led.  She falls in love
with the wrong son, naturally the one played by Brad Pitt, hence his
name, Tristan.</P>
<P>     The movie is one of those epic melodramas, extending over a
generation or more, telling the story of this tempestuous, strangely
motivated, family.  In a way it evokes another extended story, Proust's
A LA RECHERCHE DU TEMPS PERDU, in that a normally inanimate property of
the story takes on a significant role--in Proust's case time, here Brad
Pitt's hair.  Watching it grow and with the marked addition of facial
hair at certain critical moments of the story gives one a sense of
progress in the film towards its inevitable conclusion: grayness.</P>
<P>     There are a lot of really odd things in this film.  For example,
theres a significant scene early on in the film where the sheriff and
some other scurrilous characters, justice being on the side of the
rebel in this film, come riding up to look for a man named Lloyd
Cutler.  Tony Hopkins and someone else say he's not here, and we never
hear from him again (I think he is the man with the Native American
wife, but what he did is never brought up again.)  One gets the feeling
that at some stage in the progress of the film from screenplay to
projection quite a bit of the film was mysteriously lost.</P>
<P>     I really liked Anthony Hopkins portrayal later in the film, after
the stroke.  It is so over the top, and Hopkins such a good actor, that
he must have been hamming it up for the delight of the crew.</P>
<P>     Brad Pitt's near silence and impressive hair makes one think of
Fabio: in fact, I think that with a few rewrites Fabio could have done
the role nearly as well, without requiring months' delay in the
production schedule for hair growth, and having better chest
development besides.</P>
<P>     In summary, go if you have to, but if you do go look for those
little bits of strangeness that make this film bearable, and treasure
them.</P>
