<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>Black Angel is a film noir armed with the following: a brilliant script by Roy
Chanslor that is taken from a Cornell Woolrich novel, an engaging performance
turned in by Dan Duryea who is in a rare role as someone sympathetic, and it is
directed flawlessly with craft-like skills by Roy William Neill. This was
Duryea's first starring role after playing heavies. The film asks the question:
Is he a hero or a villain? </P>
<P>The self-pitying musical composer and piano player husband, Marty Blair
(Duryea), of obnoxious but sexy nightclub singer Mavis Marlowe (Dowling), tries
to get her to remember their wedding anniversary by sending her the jeweled,
heart-shaped brooch he gave her when they were married but she left behind when
she split from him. But after she receives the gift via a messenger, she refuses
to see him when he comes to her luxurious apartment as the burly doorman throws
him out. But he sees someone he doesn't know get by the doorman, and will later
learn that he's a nightclub owner named Marko (Lorre). He gets plastered not
remembering his activities that night, as Mavis is found strangled to death in
her apartment. The hit song he wrote for her "Heartbreak," which she hates, is
surprisingly playing. The brooch is also missing. His alibi is that his good
friend Joe locked him in his shabby room after the alcoholic got drunk,
something he always does to prevent Marty from getting into further trouble. </P>
<P>Unfortunately for Kirk Bennett (Phillips) he went up to the singer's apartment
because she's been blackmailing him about their affair and he doesn't want his
wife to know about it. When he enters her apartment he finds her dead and while
trying to leave without being noticed, he's spotted by Mavis's maid. </P>
<P>Captain Flood (Crawford) arrests him when he comes home to his wife Catherine
(Vincent). But he swears he didn't do it. She believes him in spite of now
knowing about his affair, but he's convicted and sentenced to the gas chamber.</P>
<P>As a last resort, she seeks the help of Marty to free her hubby. He agrees to
help because he's attracted to her, as the first thing they do is track down the
shady Marko and get a job under assumed names as a singer and piano player act
in his club. When after all their undercover work Marko turns out to be
innocent, Marty feels that Kirk must be guilty. When he asks Catherine to be his
girl, she turns him down by saying she still loves Kirk. </P>
<P>Warning: spoiler to follow in next paragraph. </P>
<P>This causes Marty to go on another bender, where by accident he meets in a bar
the girl (Marion Martin) he gave the brooch to and realizes he must have
murdered his wife. When his memory comes back to him, he acts to save Kirk's
life by calling Captain Flood. </P>
<P>The low-budget film had a stunning simplicity to it that evoked all kinds of
feelings for the players involved in this imaginative story and dramatic
tragedy. The film also presented an excellent character study of the Dan Duryea
character, making him into a complicated black angel figure. </P>
