<P>FIGHT CLUB (R).  
(Twentieth Century Fox)
Director: David Fincher
Stars: Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf, Zach 
Grenier, Thom Gossom jr, 
Jared Leto
Running time: 141 minutes.
        David Fincher (Alien 3, Seven, etc) makes dark edged, gritty
contemporary tales exploring the dark soul of man, and Fight Club is
no exception.  There is a bleak, nihilistic undertone to this cynical
and subversive movie, which espouses violence and aggression as a
solution to the systematic emasculation of men and their struggle to
find their role in society as we move into the next century.
        Edward Norton plays the anonymous hero and narrator of this
disturbing tale.  An insurance adjuster, he is disillusioned and bored
with his unfulfilling life, and feels he is slowly dying, one day at a
time.  He briefly finds solace and catharsis by attending a series of</P>
<P>self help groups, where he finds compassion and warmth.  These
meetings become something of an addiction, until the presence of Marla
(Helena Bonham Carter), also a serial attendee, proves to be
off-putting.</P>
<P>        Enter Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) a charismatic but anarchistic
soap salesman, whom he meets on a flight.  Durden befriends Norton and
initiates him into the fight club, a place where men can vent their
frustration, rage and humiliation by punching the living daylights out
of each other.  Eventually though the club seems to take on a life of
its own and develops into some sort of urban terrorist group with a
far more sinister agenda.  However as Norton races against time to
prevent a disaster he discovers more about his true nature than he is
prepared for.
        Based on Chuck Palahniuk's 1996 novel, Fight Club is a
challenging and visceral film that defies mainstream conventions and
pushes the cinematic envelope a little further.  Visually, this is a
stunning film, and Fincher certainly dazzles us with his cinematic
pyrotechnics here.  He fills the screen with a veritable montage of
images and ideas, and the film's somewhat chaotic, frantic structure
enriches its disturbing vision of modern society characterised by
disharmony and confusion.  Fincher doesn't pull his punches, and this
is one of the more brutal and violent films you'll see this year.
There is a sadistic edge to much of the confronting violence.
However, the film is also tempered with a bleak, very twisted sense of
humour.  There is also a subtle homo-erotic touch to the relationship
between Pitt and Norton, especially evident in the bruising scenes set
inside the fight club itself, which is full of sweating, semi-naked
men beating each other up.
        Somehow Fincher seems to get the best out of Pitt.  He gives
another cocky, brash, jerky and mannered, occasionally narcissistic
performance that lies somewhere between his misunderstood lunatic from
Twelve Monkeys and his seductive psychopath from kalifornia.  He gives
the complex character a dangerous but charismatic edge.  Norton, who
has proved himself one of the more consistently interesting actors
around, delivers another solid performance in a demanding role.  But,
at times, his sense of confusion at the dizzying events overtaking him
seems to be too real.  As the woman caught between Tyler and our hero,
Bonham Carter gives one of her more ambivalent but sexually
uninhibited performances.</P>
<P>        But somehow the film seems to run out of ideas towards the end
and, like Fincher's previous film The Game, limps to a vaguely
unsatisfactory conclusion.  Ultimately Fight Club seems like a triumph
of style over substance.  While the film is visually impressive and
provocative, many in the audience will be disturbed by its themes and
find it more frightening than inspiring.</P>
