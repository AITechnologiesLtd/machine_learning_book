<P>Heh, haven't laughed this hard while watching a movie in a long time. I 
must say, The Whole Nine Yards is one of the funniest films I've seen in a 
long while.</P>
<P>What would you do if you found out a gunman-for-hire just moved in next 
door? Easy, go befriend him. Nicholas (Matthew Perry) just meet his new 
neighbour, Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski (Bruce Willis). In the quiet 
neighbourhood where Nicholas lives everything is about to change. See, 
Nicholas is a nice guy, but definitely a loser. He's a dentist that's in a 
bad marriage and he's worth more dead than alive. It's hard to say anything 
about the plot without giving away the movie, so I'll stop there. But, lets 
just say that there are a lot of characters in this movie, and all of them 
are well written. And all of them have something to do with another of 
them. The web in which these characters are woven into is intricate and 
this all works out rather well for a comedy.</P>
<P>Mitchell Kapner has put together a wonderfully detailed and funny script 
with The Whole Nine Yards. The movie is captivating. On top of the 
wonderful script are wonderful performances. Perry does great on the big 
screen (finally). Willis is having a good change of image. His comedic side 
is really strong and he shows just that here in The Whole Nine Yards. Other 
performances worth mentioning are: Michael Clarke Duncan as Frankie Figs, 
another hired gun; Rosanna Arquette as Nicholas' scheming wife; and Amanda 
Peet as Jill St. Claire, Nicholas' receptionist who knows more than 
Nicholas thinks.</P>
<P>If you're looking for a good laugh, rent The Whole Nine Yards. It's a 
hilarious film that will have you in stitches by the time the credits roll. 
Don't Miss The Whole Nine Yards.</P>
