<P>"TV is showbiz" says Diana Christenson, a self-absorbed network
executive, played by Faye Dunaway, this is the underlying message seen
throughout "Network" one of the most intelligent satires I have ever
seen.  The story focuses on a news anchor man named Howard Beale
(Peter Finch) who we learn that for the past several years life has
not been going very well for him as his news program declines in
ratings for the fourth consecutive year, he is a struggling alcoholic
and that his wife has just left him.  These factors all add up to his
dismissal from UBC, the number four network behind NBC, CBS and ABC.
Losing all faith in life, Howard decides to announce to the world that
he is going to blow his brains out on his live telecast on his last
day.  This immediately causes and uproar from the public who are
offended yet at the same time interested as seen through the high
ratings which the show achieves after his announcement.  As a result,
Howard Beale gets a brand new television show named after him where he
gets to speak his mind on any topic he chooses.  This is where
"Network" really gets clever with its witty and intelligent script,
its energetic acting and hard-nosed directing all combining together
to set it in the same league as Dr.  Strangelove and Wag the Dog.</P>
<P>However, most of the credit should go to the script which was written
by Paddy Chayefsky who actually worked for a large network before
turning to screen writing.  He has captured the behaviour of the
network executives perfectly.  He knows that ratings are everything to
networks and if they don 't have them then they'll do anything to get
them even if it means exploiting a human being.  Throughout the course
of the film, I found myself was always interested in what Howard Beale
was about to say next because the dialogue was so fresh and inventive.
Chayefsky writes the dialogue in a way, that to a point, actually
becomes scary that people actually think and talk like this.  In fact,
if there was only one weakness in the entire movie it would be that in
some scenes the dialogue is so unbelievably cruel that we can't
believe that people actually talk like this.</P>
<P>Another strong point in "Network" would have to be the incredible
acting which can only be described in one word, perfect.  Each
performance, no matter how minor, is excellent with particular
standouts being Peter Finch and Faye Dunaway.  You can tell that the
actors really got involved in their characters to the point where
Peter Finch is no longer himself but actually Howard Beale and the
same goes with Faye Dunaway.  An excellent script is always an actor's
best friend and it really shows here.</P>
<P>If we can learn one thing from "Network" it is that television is
extremely powerful and is capable of shaping people's opinions and
views.  Howard Beale knew this and in his own words he was "Mad as
hell and wasn't going to take it anymore."  As a result, the power of
television destroyed him as a human being.  At the same time he was
propheting his ideas and opinions to the public he was using the very
tool he was against, television.  Whether or not he was crazy or
actually spiritual, Howard Beale did in his own words become a
"humanoid" because after years as a news anchor reporting about the
death and destruction we see every day in the world he was finally fed
up with it all and stopped caring.  I came away from "Network" with
the sense that if you have an opinion you should say it, if you don't
like something you should say so, don't let life go by without being
involved in the things that you care about.  Care is the key word I
came away with from this movie, Howard Beale stopped caring about
people and about himself and he became unhappy and deeply depressed as
a result of it.  You could say that this movie is depressing and
cynical in a sense that some people actually view the world as the one
portrayed in this movie where money is everything.  Whether you accept
this view or not, I'm sure most people will agree that is an important
film that has something to say about the world and where it is
heading.</P>
