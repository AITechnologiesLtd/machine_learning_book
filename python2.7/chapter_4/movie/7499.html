<PRE>                               BROKEN ENGLISH
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     Set in New Zealand, BROKEN ENGLISH is a poignant retelling of the
Romeo and Juliet story.  The young woman, Nina, played by beautiful
Aleksandra Vujcic in her film debut, is a member of a large community
of Croatian immigrants.  Her lover, Eddie (Julian Arahanga from the
explosive ONCE WERE WARRIORS), is a Maori and is the chef at the
Chinese restaurant where Nina works as a waitress.</P>
<P>     Their love affair would have little tension were it not for her
domineering father, Ivan, played by Rade Serbedzija, who played the
leader of the Russian Mafia in THE SAINT.  Ivan is the type of father
who is willing to lock his grown daughters in their rooms if they are
caught doing something of which he does not approve.  In the opening
scene, he smashes the Jaguar of the boyfriend of Nina's equally grown
sister.  Ivan had found that Nina's sister was having sex with her
boyfriend, and that was all the justification that Ivan the Madman
needed.</P>
<P>     BROKEN ENGLISH tells two stories and hints at a third.  The
intensity of the all too manipulative script by Gregor Nicholas,
Johanna Pigott, and James Salter focuses on Nina's dysfunctional
family.  The father makes his living illegally growing and dealing
marijuana.  Even when not violent, Serbedzija makes you think Ivan is
about to explode.</P>
<P>     The family's problems are neatly laid at the foot of the war they
fled and of unnamed Serbian atrocities.  One telling scene has the
family huddled around their television set watching the latest homemade
tape of the war sent from their relatives back home at the front.</P>
<P>     Nina manages to look fondly back on her time in the midst of the
battle.  She liked to drink, smoke pot, and wander around as the bombs
fell.  She found freedom and independence among the devastation.  "I
wanted to do what I wanted to do, no matter what," she tells us.  "It
was my moment of freedom."  Her controlling father was so oppressive
that freedom among the explosions was an improvement.</P>
<P>     Nina and Eddie's romance form the second and most interesting of
the narratives.  The chemistry between them is touching and believable,
and their few love making scenes are beautifully erotic even if only
one is explicit.</P>
<P>     (The film inappropriately has been tagged with an NC-17 rating,
which director Gregor Nicholas protested and lost.  The press kit
explains the MPAA appeals board said that one of the film's love making
scenes contains "buttock thrusting," so they felt that they had to rate
it NC-17.  Given the massive violence in countless R-rated shows, and
the more explicit sex and more rampant nudity in many other R-rated
films, it seems strange that one motion would make such a difference,
but apparently it did.  One wonders what poses a greater threat to a
sixteen-year old: seeing someone's brains splattered on the side of a
building or a couple of "buttock thrusts?"  It would seem the MPAA
believes it is the latter since the former gets a film the more
profitable R-rating and latter condemns the movie to an NC-17.  Some
newspapers will not even carry advertisements for NC-17 films.)</P>
<P>     The third story, which remains no more than an outline, is about
Eddie's family, his people and his culture.  We see them from afar in a
few scenes, but we rarely venture into their world.  Only his beloved
whakapapa tree provides a link to this undeveloped part of the story.</P>
<P>     Another subplot has Nina about to marry her friend Clara's (Jing
Zhao) boyfriend, Mr. Wu (Yang Li), for money since Mr. Wu needs to be
married to a New Zealand citizen to be able to stay in New Zealand.
Both of these Chinese characters are so badly stereotyped that it
becomes embarrassing to watch.  Clara drones on about wanting to "make
a little kiwi" with Mr. Wu.</P>
<P>     The film smolders as if building to an explosive conclusion.  When
the ending comes, it is remarkably plain and unoriginal and packs
little wallop.  A bit scary, certainly, but nothing out of the
ordinary.</P>
<P>     With a surfeit of stories, the audience is too often shortchanged.
An overly ambitious film, it does manage to deliver on the romance even
if it too often buries it in the manipulative saga of the brutal
family.</P>
<P>     BROKEN ENGLISH runs only 1:30.  It is inappropriately rated NC-17.
Although there is sex, nudity, violence, profanity, and dope smoking,
the level is on a par with most R-rated films and the violence is less.
The movie would be fine for mature teenagers.  I liked the picture just
enough to be able to recommend it and give it ** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
