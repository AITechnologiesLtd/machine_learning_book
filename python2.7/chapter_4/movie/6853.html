<PRE>                                BLOSSOM TIME
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>     Sometimes being a critic is hard.  I saw BLOSSOM TIME at San
Jose's Cinequest film festival.  As much as I wanted and expected to
like the picture, I didn't.  When it is some expensive Hollywood
production, I have no problem in writing a derogatory review.  With a
nice director like David Orr, it is hard.  He stayed after the film to
answer our questions, and he is easy gentleman to like.</P>
<P>     Orr's film, however, was anything but easy to watch.  I came away
convinced that he is a better actor than a director, and that, if he
does direct another movie, he should hire someone else to do the
casting.</P>
<P>     His lead, Laurel Holloman (PREFONTAINE and THE INCREDIBLE TRUE
ADVENTURE OF TWO GIRLS IN LOVE) as Francis, showed promise as did Orr
himself as the stranger Dwight.  The problem in the show was in the
casting of Greg Farnese as Francis's older brother Hank and Daniel
Gavin (TRUE ROMANCE) as her younger brother Billie Paul.</P>
<P>     In the press kit, Orr says the film is a "homage to the great
American playwright Tennessee Williams and was shot in the small
Mississippi town where Tennessee was born."  Farnese and Gavin play
Southern mumblers which make them mysterious, I suppose, but also make
them almost incomprehensible.  I speak fluent Southern.  If I have
trouble, then I am sure others will be even more confused.</P>
<P>     "The Lord teaches us to be happy with what we got, but sometimes
it doesn't seem like enough," says Francis in the film's opening
sequence.  She lives with her two brothers, and she has played the role
of the family's mother ever since their parents died.  Francis cooks
and cleans for her brothers, but they do not seem to appreciate it very
much.  Francis isn't very happy with the arrangement either and wants
more out of her life.  One day her friend Amy brings over her cousin
Dwight to meet Francis.</P>
<P>     A typical subplot, which doesn't work, involves two men who
deliver milk door-to-door.  They get in an argument on Francis's front
porch about whether one of them has been stealing sips of milk from
their customers.  They end up both deciding to quit their jobs
immediately.  The scene ends up being neither particularly funny nor
credible.</P>
<P>     The dialog is full of Southern cliches.  Typical is when Francis
explains, "There ain't nothin' wrong with me."  The show is populated
by many people that fit the typical movie stereotype of Southerners
with dramatically lower IQs than the rest of the nation.</P>
<P>     There are some surprises along the way, but the script by Anthony
Gavin is quite weak.  I wish I had more positive things to say about
the picture, but I do not.  Well, at least there are two good actors in
the show, Holloman and Orr.</P>
<P>     BLOSSOM TIME runs 1:47.  It is not rated.  I cannot recommend the
film.  I give it * 1/2 for the two decent performances in it.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
