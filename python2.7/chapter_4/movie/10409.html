<PRE>Gridlock'd (1997) * * 1/2
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1997 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>CAPSULE: Tim Roth and Tupac Shakur are both fine in this unfortunately
contrived tale of two junkies on the kick.</P>
<P>The worst thing about GRIDLOCK'D is that it takes a basically
interesting idea and surrounds it with prefab plotting, and the idea
is forced to surrender. Sad, but that's probably the way it goes: I
doubt many people, let alone filmmakers, would want to sit still long
enough for an absorbing story about two musician/junkies. I know I
would.</P>
<P>Tim Roth ("Stretch") and Tupac Shakur ("Spoon") are the
musician/junkies of the title. Based on what we see, they're talented,
but they also have a disgustingly narrow world-view: drugs, gigging,
and crashing afterwards. They share a loft with their singer, Cookie
(played splendidly by Thandie Newton) and have an existence that's not
as hellish as TRAINSPOTTING, but is still pretty grungy nonetheless.</P>
<P>One night they get a bad hit of something after a gig, and Cookie
plunges into a coma. Cookie winds up in a hospital bed, and Spoon
decides it's time to get off the junk. Stretch doesn't
empathize. Yet. These opening scenes and the moments in the hospital
that follow are brilliant: they're both funny and desperate, and they
strike a uniquely black tone for the movie's humor. In another scene,
the two of them try to injure themselves to get into an emergency
ward; all they've got is a crummy little penknife that probably
wouldn't be good for whittling down pencils.  But they use it anyway,
in a scene that's both funny and agonizing.</P>
<P>The two of them then get plunged into a maddening bureaucratic hassle
in an attempt to get into detox. Trouble is, you can't get into detox
without Medicaid, and you can't get Medicaid without being on welfare,
and you can't get on welfare without... and so on. There is one scene
where they try to intimidate a social worker by trying to comvince him
they're psychotic and need to get into detox NOW, GOD DAMN IT, and
then in a reversal that's the movie's trademark, THEY get the living
Christ intimidated out of *them*. There's also a cameo by Elizabeth
Pena as an ER nurse who gets her own sadistic little form of revenge
on the two of them when they show up for treatment in her ward not
once but twice. But then the movie slowly drifts into a stupid
shrink-wrapped plot about a drug dealer, with the attendant chases and
shoot-outs (at least it doesn't end with the bad guy being shot a
dozen times), and for me the real magic of the movie was lost.</P>
<P>The core of the story -- the Shakur/Roth byplay -- is solid. It shows
off both actors as being comfortable with the material -- especially
Shakur, who would certainly have gone on to do more interesting acting
had he lived. Shakur has one remarkable monologue about the first time
he popped coke, which sounds improvised, and has its corners and
cracks filled in with the nuances of a good-and-soon-to-be-great
actor. At the end, I reflected on how good the best parts of the movie
were, how senseless it was to clutter the movie up with its stupid
thriller plot, and on how we seem to be losing a few too many good
young actors these days.</P>
