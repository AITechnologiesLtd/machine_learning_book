"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Last March, a film that poked fun at the slow-witted, backwoods folk of
a tiny upstate New York town was released to poor reviews and virtually
no audience.  Drowning Mona was a sloppy whodunit that tried too hard to
be quirky and instead came off as a dull Fargo copycat.</P>
<P>Conversely, Poor White Trash succeeds where Mona went horribly wrong. It
also deals with characters more likely to spit tobacco juice than
mouthwash, but instead of upstate New York, Trash is set in Sunrise,
Illinois.  The film opens with the bumpkin duo of Michael (Tony Denman,
G vs. E) and Lennie (Jacob Tierney, This is My Father) trying to steal
non-alcoholic beer from the local grocery (called The L'il Store).  One
blow-up doll and a burnt Chevy Vega later, the two have been nabbed by
the authorities, a move that could potentially threaten the future of
college-bound Michael.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Michael's mother Linda (Sean Young, Ace Ventura: Pet
Detective) has just been fired from her nursing home job.  Times have
been hard for Linda (her husband, a one-eyed professional wrestler,
abandoned her and Michael), but the thought of her only son being turned
away from secondary learning (and, thusly, a ticket out of Sunrise) is
just too much for her to handle.  A plan is hatched to raise money to
hire Lennie's grandfather to represent the boys in court.</P>
<P>Their plan doesn't involve a bake sale or a car wash - rather a series
of trailer burglaries.  And Lennie's grandfather (William Devane, Space
Cowboys) turns out to be a shit-kickin' hillbilly with a strip-mall law
office (called `Ron Lake's Land o' Law'), a hot young wife (Jaime
Pressly, Jerry Springer's Ringmaster) and several impressive beer-can
sculptures.  Hilarity ensues, leading up to a big gunfight finale. M.
Emmet Walsh (Wild Wild West) even makes an appearance as the town
justice – like who else would you get to play a backwater judge?</P>
<P>Trash isn't filled with stars, nor is it particularly well-written or
evenly executed, but it's still a lot of fun to watch.  Unlike Mona, the
film doesn't take itself too seriously, a point driven home by
writer/director Michael Addis, who mocked his film's lack of complexity
in the Q&A session following the screening of this film at the Cleveland
International Film Festival.  Addis, who makes his directorial debut
here (he was an editor on Kounterfeit), presented the film with a goofy,
hyper smile and even thinks his film may have pissed off the locals in
Benton, Illinois, where the film was shot.</P>
<P>Addis, who played a cop in Trash and was a writer on The Man Show, even
poked fun at Sean Young, telling a story of how the actress truly
suffered for her art.  At one point, she rhetorically screamed, `Who do
I have to fuck to get off this film?'  When somebody replied, `Addis,'
Young said she'd stay on.  It's jokes like these that make Trash a
surprisingly funny film.</P>
<P>1:25 – NR but contains graphic violence, adult language and sexual
content</P>
