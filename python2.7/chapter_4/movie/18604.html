<P>For the average person, director Stanley Kubrick is probably best known 
for his upcoming film entitled "Eyes Wide Shut," featuring Tom Cruise 
and Nicole Kidman, which had taken over two years for him to complete. 
For an avid filmgoer, Kubrick is perhaps more known for his classic 
motion pictures, such as 1964's "Dr. Strangelove" and 1971's "A 
Clockwork Orange." His step into the horror genre, however, came in 1980 
with his loose, but exquisitely told, terrifying adaptation of Stephen 
King's novel, "The Shining." At the time of its release, King 
enthusiasts were disappointed because the film version had many 
differences from the book, but I doubt anyone can deny its overall power 
to scare.</P>
<P>With a running time of 144 minutes, it is obvious that this is no 
ordinary horror picture, but one that aspires to be an epic, and it 
definately is for the genre. Jack Nicholson stars in a tour de force 
performance as Jack, a writer who, at the start, is a family man who 
takes a job as caretaker at the Colorado Overlook Hotel for the winter. 
He is warned early on by the hotel's manager that the winters in the 
mountains are treacherous, and often the heavy snowfall closes up the 
roads for months. Soon Jack, his wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall), and their 
little son, Danny (Danny Lloyd) are left alone at the huge, desolate 
hotel, and as the weeks go by, the snow grows heavier, and Jack gets a 
bad case of writer's block, he slowly, but surely begins to go crazy. 
Meanwhile, it begins to get obvious that the hotel itself is indeed 
haunted, and as young Danny rides his bike through the endless 
corridors, he starts to get visions of terrible things to come, such as 
an elevator opening up to a tidal wave of blood. He also starts to see 
two mysterious twins who seem to be roaming the hotel, side-by-side. If 
you haven't seen "The Shining," then I wouldn't dare give away how 
everything develops, but it is safe to say that by the last 45 minutes, 
all hell breaks loose. </P>
<P>"The Shining" is a deliberately paced, but endlessly creepy, horrifying 
motion picture. From the first shot of the camera moving overhead as a 
car drives down a road, to the shots within the hedge maze outside the 
hotel, the film has some of the most beautiful, atmospheric 
cinematography, by John Alcott, I have ever seen. Other technical 
credits are also superb, including the extremely eerie, memorable 
instrumental music score by Herbert Von Karajan, and the unforgettable 
production design by Roy Walker.</P>
<P>It is the overall experience of "The Shining," however, that makes it 
such a great film. The slow pace at the start is actually an asset, 
because it gradually grows momentum as Nicholson starts to grow more and 
more crazy, until the movie totally takes off in it's last hour and 
turns into a funhouse of horrors. One particular scene is especially 
disturbing. Without giving it away, it involves Duvall and a person in a 
dog costume.</P>
<P>Nicholson's performance in this movie is probably my favorite that he 
has given, because he has the ability to have a very menacing present. I 
think it has something to do with his voice and his eyebrows. Duvall is 
very good as his sympathetic wife, and is a very good screamer when she 
has to be. Aside from Nicholson, however, the standout of the cast is 
surely Scatman Crothers, as the cook of the hotel who tells Danny at the 
beginning that he has the "shine," which is the ability to see the 
future. In my opinion, he was sorely overlooked for an Oscar nomination 
in 1980.</P>
<P>"The Shining" is also very much thought-provoking, particularly the 
closing scene, and is one of the greatest horror films ever made. It is 
also a movie not easy to forget, and proves that when done well enough, 
and with a great deal of care, a horror movie can rise to a plane all 
its own.</P>
