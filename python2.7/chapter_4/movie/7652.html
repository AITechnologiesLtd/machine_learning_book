<P>**1/2 (out of 4 = OK)
1984, PG, 158 minutes [2 hours, 38 minutes]
[drama]

Elizabeth Berridge (Constanze Mozart), Jeffrey Jones (Emperor Joseph II),
written by Peter Shaffer (based on his play), produced by Saul Zaentz,
directed by Milos Forman.</P>
<P>At first glance, "Amadeus" seems like a filmed version of a classic story,
but it quickly throws in modern elements to lighten the mood and make
everything more relatable. I liked what I saw at first, but in a way I felt
as if I was being talked down to. And just as I started to catch on, the film
lost me.
The opening scenes quickly establish and foreshadow the mood and settings
for the rest of the film. We meet Antonio Salieri (Abraham), an old man in an
asylum in early 19th century Europe. He is a bitter old man and when he is
visited by a Catholic priest he is very spiteful, almost hostile towards him
and what he stands for. He then proceeds to tell his tale of his personal
vendetta against "The Great" Mozart. 
Tom Hulce stars as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who seems like a college frat
boy stuck in the body of this period character. I really didn't have a
problem with this because this is supposedly true and it does keep with the
rest of the lighthearted, almost satirical mood. Salieri is the court
composer to Emperor Joseph II (Jones), and when Mozart is invited into the
royal manner and astounds everyone, Salieri is quietly enraged with
jealously. He seems to be the most serious character and aspect to the film
throughout the first half. 
There isn't really a definite plot to this film, and it doesn't make a
difference for the most part. The story is somewhat of a biography of Mozart
and his rebellious lifestyle as he constantly writes operas that shock the
royals and the higher-ups, but always seem to accomplish his goals in the
end. It is also a philosophical and spiritual allegory as we learn how
Salieri forms a hatred against God. Why should this "punk" be blessed with
such talent when he has worked so much harder and is not recognized as the
genius he is?
Like most people, I don't understand opera and the first half seemed to
recognize this and worked around it well. The movie had been an interesting
biographical drama up until the very middle and then seemed to take a nose
dive. We had been following Salieri's subtle plans of sabotage, but this
element seems to be forgotten and all that we get is a confusing story of
Mozart's later works and his complicated relationship with his wife Constanze
(Berridge) and the generic love/hate relationship with his overbearing
father. 
The music itself also plays a very important role in the film, and I'd have
to applaud the filmmakers for being able to synchronize it as well as they
did. The only problem is there's too much of it here. Just scene after scene
of operas that are probably symbolic of the conflict between Mozart and
Salieri, his father, and his wife. But it's not nearly as easy to follow as
the beginning of the film had been and I felt stupid for not being able to
follow it.
There is a scene in the first act that perfectly symbolizes my view of
"Amadeus." After Emperor Joseph II has watched his first Mozart opera, he
says he liked it, but there were "too many notes." I'd have to say the same
to Shaffer, Zaentz, and Forman: "Your movie is good but it's just too much. I
don't understand what the point was, but you did a fair job in making it."
