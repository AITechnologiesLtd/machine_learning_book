<P>    RANSOM, director Ron Howard's underwhelming though thoroughly
plotted remake of the little-known Glenn Ford film, stars Mel Gibson as
a self-promoting, self-protecting, self-made billionaire whose world
comes crashing to a halt when his young son is kidnapped.  The catch?
As the ads have revealed for several months now, instead of given them
what they want, he takes their money to a television station and offers
a two million-dollar bounty on the kidnappers' heads.  This twist, which
comes about an hour into the film, is exciting in principle, but doesn't
send the story charging forward.  Instead of Mel gearing up with a band
of bounty hunters-- and wouldn't *that* be something to see!-- we get
even more talk, a couple of keen role reversals, and an entirely odd
final confrontation between Gibson and Gary Sinese, who plays the
mastermind behind the crime.</P>
<P>    Sinese is a waste, which I'll detail later, but Gibson gets to go
nuts and that's what we pay him for.  Other prominent players include
Rene Russo (TIN CUP), looking less plastic than usual.  She has little
to do as the trophy wife, but contributes to the overall suspense by
appearing shorter than her co-star.  (How did they do that, you'll
wonder.  Morphing?  Trick photography??) The ever-prolific Delroy Lindo
(BROKEN ARROW, CLOCKERS) plays the head FBI agent and he's always good.
Most interesting is the inclusion of Lily Taylor and Liev Schreiber,
established actors from the world of indy cinema who play two of the
grungy, Gen-X henchmen.  The presence of these unsavory young characters
in a Hollywood Event Picture-- not to mention in a Ron Howard film, for
gosh sakes!-- suggests that the new villain of the nineties may be of
the dirty, tattooed, cigarette-smoking, cereal-eating, cyber-phreaking,
rerun- watching variety.  Who's that guy with the nose ring, Robin?  I
don't know, Batman, better blow him away.</P>
<P>    Both heroes and villains get equal time and that makes for a well-
balanced story, with everyone giving a game performance, even when they
don't entirely fit in.  Like Ms. Russo.  The glaring exception is Gary
Sinese, who's horribly miscast as the cop-turned-criminal-mastermind.
Lieutenant Dan is a good actor who, here, has almost no tangible weight
as a heavy.  Frankly, he's about as threatening as Joe Pesci's Leo Getz.
Okay, okay, okay, but witness his hollow monologue about THE TIME
MACHINE to see what he's missing.  If the characters don't always work,
at least the plot machinery does.  It keeps churning away, like the
Morlock machinery beneath that future world.  The end result is a
reasonably entertaining popcorn pic-- two hours of multiplex filler that
only crashes and burns when it tries to take itself too seriously.  If
Ron Howard had recognized RANSOM as the potboiler that it is, he
might've trimmed some of the hokum.  (Or restored some of the logic.  Or
replaced that fuzzy score from James Horner.  Ugh.) Try not to giggle
when something serious is seriously funny, like when Sinese says with a
straight face to Taylor: "You know what you're scared of?  Your own
humanity." I laughed out loud.  </P>
