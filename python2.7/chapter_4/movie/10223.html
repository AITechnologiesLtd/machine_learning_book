<PRE>Scream 2
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1997 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>The return to the popular spoof of slasher films had the biggest December
opening weekend in history and, in accordance with one of the rules of
sequels, features an even higher body count.</P>
<P>Like its predecessor, there are some clever lines (a sorority girl offers "Hi!
No, I really mean it! Hi!") and send-ups of the genre. My favorites are the
scenes where the unarmed would-be victims rush around trying to find the
vicious killer. What are they going to do if they find him?</P>
<P>Despite the witty antics, the film doesn't have much entertainment value for
me. Why? I dunno. Perhaps it's because the characters don't hold much
interest. Or maybe the fact that the same scene is played out over and over
enters into it.</P>
<P>It could be that I don't have enough of a background of slasher films to enjoy
a parody. I guess that's not such a bad thing.</P>
<P>[This appeared in the 12/18/97 "Bloomington Voice", Bloomington, Indiana.
