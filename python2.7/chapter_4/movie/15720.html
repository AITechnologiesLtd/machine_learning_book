<PRE>RINGMASTER
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: [no stars] out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>At the turn of the millennium, the name Jerry Springer has become
synonymous with "trash tv" and everything that has gone wrong with our
culture.  It's only fitting, then, that Jerry gets his own movie. But
Ringmaster, a half-hearted attempt to translate the "ideal" Jerry
Springer show free-for-all to the screen, ends up an even worse movie
than the concept sounds!</P>
<P>Jerry Springer stars as Jerry Farrelly, talk show host.  His show,
Jerry!, lets its guests air their dirty laundry in front of a national
television audience, and also (occasionally) engage in brutal fistcuffs.</P>
<P>The first set of guests, for the show titled "You Did WHAT With Your
Stepdaddy?", are a pathetic bunch of trailer trash.  Angel Zorzak (Jaime
Pressly) is a sex-starved 19-year old having an affair with her
stepfather (Michael Dudikoff).  In retaliation, her 34-year old mother,
Connie (Molly Hagen) strikes up a relationship with Angel's fiancee,
Willie (Ashley Holbrook).</P>
<P>The second Jerry! show is entitled "My Traitor Girlfriends". Starletta
(Wendy Raquel Robinson) is having problems with her boyfriend, Demond
(Michael Jai White).  He'll sleep with anyone, including Starletta's
best friends, Vonda (Tangie Ambrose) and Leshawnette (Nicki Michneaux).</P>
<P>Now, obviously, these are the screenwriters' attempts at setting up the
"perfect" Jerry Springer show.  But, where's the fun in that?  I mean,
part of the lurid appeal of his TV show is that the guests are real.
Real people with real problems and real bad attitudes.  Here, it's just
a bunch of actors acting badly, and it shows.</P>
<P>I guess here you also get to see the enchanting lives the "typical"
Jerry Springer guests live before their on-air appearances.  And you
also get to gawk at the "glamorous" life behind the scenes of Jerry's
show.  In other words, nothing very appealing is here at all.</P>
<P>But nothing can compare to when the film starts preaching its "message".
You see, Jerry Springer is all about helping the poor.  Anyone who
dislikes the show is simply uncomfortable with watching poor folk talk
about their problems.  However, Ringmaster conveniently forgets to
mention the fact that the show also happens to be exploiting those same
"poor folk" it supposedly champions.  Oh well, they never claimed it was
a rational argument.</P>
<P>If you're a die-hard Jerry Springer junkie, you ought to stick with the
real thing.  For those of you non-fans out there, Ringmaster certainly
won't convert you.  If anything, it may make you despise Jerry Springer
all the more.</P>
