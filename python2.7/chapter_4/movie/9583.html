<PRE>SUPERFLY (1972)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Gordon Parks Jr.
Writer: Philip Fenty
Starring: Ron O'Neal, Carl Lee, Sheila Frazier, Julius Harris, Charles
McGregor, Polly Niles, K.C., the Curtis Mayfield Experience</P>
<P>If anything, the blaxploitation sub-genre is good for a lot of laughs. 
Though sometimes excellent (need I even say "Shaft?"), it's a
hysterically dated collection of films by and for African Americans (I'm
aiming for some PC here), and usually laden with memorable characters,
the most of which is usually the protagonist.  "Superfly," which I saw
for a buck twenty-five at the crap theratre at my lovely college, is a
fantastically hokey film, yet is still one of the best examples of a
typical blaxploitation film.  Yes, that makes it cool.</P>
<P>"Superfly" deals with a big-time coke-pusher named Priest (Ron O'Neal),
who dresses in leather, has long hair that Michael Jackson would only
dream of, and wears a lovely giant white pimp hat.  He also wears a
crucifix around his neck, which he uses in the first scene to scoop coke
into his nose.  This is a great scene, and wonderfully satirical and
all, but he uses it every ten minutes and it starts to get annoying.</P>
<P>The hook of the story is that Priest wants to get out of the biz while
he's still young.  Tired of being scared of being arrested or killed in
the line of "duty," he decides to make one last score, which involves
him and his assistant (Carl Lee) buying and selling 3 G's worth of coke,
settling the score to half-a-million for each.  Of course, his assistant
loves the life they lead (he says this classic line that goes something
like "You have eight-tracks, a color TV in every room, and enough coke
to snort every day.  You living the American Dream!"), and reluctantly
goes along.</P>
<P>But, Priest finds it's a tad hard to get out, because his boss keeps
pulling him back in.  He makes the money easily, but finds himself on
with a bit of a problem, since they tell him they'll kill him if he
runs.  But he and his loyal girlfriend (Sheila Frazier) - who he cheats
on - try to make a twisted break off, without giving any money up.</P>
<P>Now, the film is pretty nicely paced, although it does slow up a bit in
the middle section.  And the little deal with Priest is handled very
nicely, with a huge lack of violence, until the end, which is only very
brief, and not too bloody (zero deaths in this scene).  Instead, he uses
his brains to get out of his situation, which is respectable.</P>
<P>But.  The film is hilariously dated.  Yes, the seventies fashion (big
pimp hats, tight leather, tight pants, tight everything) is able to be
forgiven, and so is the 8-track.  Well, maybe.  But there is some
hilariously bad little problems with the production.  A chase in the
beginning is done with a very, very, very shaky use of steadicam - so
much that all you see is blurs.  And there's the use of close-ups at
inconvenient times, as well as some bad lighting, which is sometimes
just some street lights, or one single lamp.  There's also a very
horribly done scene where some people are inside a car and you can't see
a thing of what's going on.  I wasn't going to mention the final fight
scene, done in hilarious slow-motion, and culminating in a classic use
of the word "Fuh-reeeeeeeeeze!"</P>
<P>But (ha ha).  This is a quintessential blaxploitation film.  And it's
fun as hell to watch.  I'm a fan of the sub-genre, somewhat for the
mockery factor, but mostly because they're just so damn cool.  Well,
maybe half of each.  But anyway, this film is something I would
reccomend as not being great cinema (although, as I said, it is somewhat
respectable at points), but just one great example of the blaxploitation
wave.</P>
