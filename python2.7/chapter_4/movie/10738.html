<PRE>FREEDONIA'S GOING TO WAR
by Kristian Lin</PRE>
<P>Director Barry Levinson shot WAG THE DOG in 29 days, which was smart
strategy.  The film doesn't feel slapped together, but captures the
feverish pace of a presidential campaign's waning days.  Levinson's 
filmmaking hasn't had this much energy since his early career.  He
seemed to be in an irreversible decline, turning out dreck like
DISCLOSURE and SLEEPERS.  But his artistic talents have only been
hibernating.  With his fellow-travelling scriptwriter Paul Attanasio, he
has been an unseen power behind some of the decade's most thoughtful
movies (QUIZ SHOW, DONNIE BRASCO) as well as one of TV's best shows 
("Homicide: Life on the Street").  WAG THE DOG reveals that he has been
a guerrilla filmmaker all along.</P>
<P>When the President is caught in a sex scandal shortly before an
election, his aide Winifred Ames (Anne Heche) hires political consultant
Conrad Brean (Robert De Niro), who brings in Hollywood producer Stanley
Motss (Dustin Hoffman).  Their idea is to divert attention from the
President's misbehavior by faking a war between the U.S. and Albania.</P>
<P>Most of this movie's juice comes from the teaming of De Niro and
Hoffman, who both turn in their best work in years.  De Niro knows that
the other part's the showboat, so he plays the straight man to great 
effect.  His cool, low-key style hides an unflappable authority that
makes him the rock amid the campaign's welter of activity.</P>
<P>Hoffman's performance, though, is the real marvel.  Stanley Motss is a
natural at politics: he's always responding to the latest crisis with a
jolly "This is nothing!"  Hoffman gives us an egomaniac who's seen 
everything, but also homes in on the relish with which the movie
producer does his job.  Motss is no artist, but he's a creative genius
of a hasty, improvisatory sort who's always bubbling over with ideas.  I
wish we could have seen the kind of movies he makes - is he Saul Zaentz,
Harvey Weinstein, or Jerry Bruckheimer?  (My guess is the latter.)  This
is the most compelling portrait of a Hollywood suit since Tim Robbins's
Griffin Mill in THE PLAYER.  They may both be soulless money men with a
deep contempt for audiences, but Motss is far more likeable than the
paranoid, humorless Mill.</P>
<P>The problem is the movie shares his contempt.  It assumes unthinking,
monolithic response from the people and the media.  WAG THE DOG would
have been more interesting exploring the ways in which different
segments of the culture react to media hype.  It's uncharacteristic of
writer David Mamet to be so shallow (he shares script credit with Hilary
Henkin, but there's some dispute as to her contribution, and this movie
plays as a Mamet script anyway).  The movie's cynicism is cheap,
arrogant, and almost succeeds in being a real turn-off, especially at
the end, when they try to create a war hero out of a psychotic rapist
(Woody Harrelson).  It could have worked if the movie had had some of
the sheer comic lunacy of DUCK SOUP or DR. STRANGELOVE to leaven
things.  The Coen brothers could have done that, but it isn't Mamet and
Levinson's game.</P>
<P>Heche's character is a third wheel (the usual situation for a woman in a
Mamet production).  Ames's purpose in the story is to fret when the
situation gets tense and then gape at the old pros' public-relations
wizardry, but Heche makes both states of mind watchably funny.  Willie
Nelson and Jay Leno are great as a drug-addled folk balladeer and a
standup comic who tells bad jokes, respectively.  And William H. Macy 
gives the movie a jolt as a starchy CIA agent who knows what's going
down ("When the fit hits the shan, someone's going to have to stay after
school," he chirps).  WAG THE DOG is too glib to be a great political
satire, but it's a sign that Barry Levinson hasn't lost his filmmaking
skills.</P>
