                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                     Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  Instead of short films that
     inaccurate portray the Wyatt Earp and the gunfight at the
     O.K. Corral, Costner and Kasdan bring us a big 189-minute
     biopic of Wyatt Earp that inaccurately shows his whole
     life.  Costner does not do too much for Earp, but Dennis
     Quaid's Doc Holliday is a genuine tour de force.  Still,
     the film just does not entertain or edify sufficiently to
     justify the length.  Rating: high 0 (-4 to +4).  A
     discussion of historical accuracy at the end of this
     review may contain minor spoilers.</P>
<P>     Last year I reviewed TOMBSTONE and both criticized and praised the
film for being half-accurate as a film version of the events around the
famous gunfight at the O.K. Corral.  Well, I see the error of my ways.
At least I have to say that there is a whole lot more to an historical
film than accuracy.  WYATT EARP is even a little more accurate than even
TOMBSTONE on some points.  But just recreating historical facts does not
make for a good film.  The two films are faithful to the historical
detail about equally, but TOMBSTONE is certainly the more worthwhile.
The definitive film about Wyatt Earp, if it is even possible, still
remains to be made.</P>
<P>     Basically the title of WYATT EARP tells it all.  This is a
biography of Wyatt Earp from the time he was a teenager to his
retirement.  When the film opens Wyatt is in the Oriental Saloon waiting
for the most famous gunfight of his life and probably of the American
West.  Then we flash back and now Wyatt is a teenager on his family farm
in Missouri, anxious to go off and join his brothers fighting the South.
Instead he finds himself giving in to the will of an autocratic father
(Gene Hackman).  Wyatt's real father, incidentally, was not a lawyer as
the film would have it, but a farmer and a cooper.  Over some protest,
Wyatt's father announces one day that the family will move west.  Wyatt
goes and finds the West beautiful but also lawless and violent.  He
returns to Missouri to learn to be a lawyer and to raise a family.  When
his wife dies he returns west and tries his hand at being an alcoholic,
a low-life, a horse thief, and a mugger in the hopes that he will soon
be able to add "corpse" to his resume.  This doesn't work out for him
either.</P>
<P>     Getting back on his feet, he decides to hunt the mighty buffalo (or
"titonka" to you Costner fans).  Wyatt befriends Ed and Bat Masterson
who come along with him as mule skinners.  Later when Wyatt accidentally
shows his prowess at subduing drunks he is asked to become a lawman, he
brings the Masterson's along with him.  And the rest is history--not
that script writers Dan Gordon and Lawrence Kasdan did much of a job of
researching it.</P>
<P>     Costner plays Wyatt as Costner.  He glides through the part doing
little we have not seen from him before.  That is really a pity, since
he desperately needs a role that will give him more to do.  He has been
in some good films, but it is becoming clear he wants to play the hero
roles of an Errol Flynn without the dramatic range of a John Wayne.  But
if it looks like this film didn't give him much opportunity to stretch
himself, look what it did for Dennis Quaid.  As Doc Holliday, Quaid
submerges himself into a Georgia accent, a moustache, and a beard, and
is nearly unrecognizable.  (The real Holliday wore no beard, by the
way.)  There are a host of other familiar faces including Mark Harmon,
Catherine O'Hara, Tom Sizemore, and Betty Buckley.  Clearly not much
expense was spared on the cast or even the sets, yet the film has not
much sparkle or style.  James Newton Howard's score is never engaging.
With all the beautiful Arizona scenery available Kasdan rarely lets the
camera take much advantage of it.</P>
<P>     Under Kasdan's direction the film ends up being somewhat ponderous
and oddly dull.  Events take a long time to develop.  While no film has
ever so well caught the complexity of the events surrounding the corral
gunfight, and that is the difficult part, the gunfight itself is staged
very inaccurately.  The actual scenario of the fight is easily available
so that piece of the script could have written itself, but apparentlyit
just was not researched or Kasdan did not care.  I am not certain, but I
seem to remember in this film five men facing down the Earps rather than
the actual four.  It seems as if somebody who knew something about the
Earps wrote an outline for the film that said at this point put in the
gunfight, and then someone who didn't know as much wrote the description
of the fight.  The film is accurate on a high level, but very inaccurate
on low-level details.  And it is about an hour longer than it should
have been to sustain audience interest.  For what they got right, I am
tempted to rate it higher, but it also makes some big mistakes.  I rate
it a high 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
<PRE>Minor Spoilers:</PRE>
<P>     I have heard some critics praising this film as finally being an
accurate representation of Wyatt Earp.  I suppose that they mean that
because this sees to be a warts-and-all representation of Wyatt.
Actually this film just shows more of his life than most previous films,
but it also is full of inaccuracy.  As I say above, it is almost as if
the writers started with an accurate outline of Wyatt's life, then
invented the details they needed to flesh it out without checking on the
truth of the details.  Not that accurate details are easy to come by.
Wyatt is one of the most fabled characters of the West and there seemto
be all sorts of stories about him.  But many of the details that were
thrown into this version, while lending a believable historic texture,
only distort the facts.</P>
<P>     I don't know how emotionally scarred Wyatt was after the death of
his first wife, but he and some of his brothers were supposedly involved
in a twenty-minute street fight with two of his wife's brothers not long
after the death.  This torching of the house in grief was made up of the
whole cloth.</P>
<P>     Ed Masterson tells Wyatt that Bat picked the name Bat because he
couldn't stand his real name, Bartholomew.  And Bat is unhappy about
divulging this secret.  Actually, he was born William Barclay Masterson,
not a particularly stigmatizing name.  The story certainly added a
realistic texture to the script, but it didn't come out of anybody's
research.</P>
<P>     The film shows Earp as being a crack shot and an honest lawman.
None of this is true.  In fact he took bribes, pocketed fines, and at
least on one occasion nearly shot himself with his own gun.  Most of his
legend was little more than legend.</P>
<P>     Big Nose Katie Elder (Isabella Rossellini, who strongly resembles
her mother, Ingrid Bergman), explaining her unexpected good looks, says
people get nicknames for all sorts of reasons.  She points out her nose
is not actually big.  That is a nice piece of texture.  And it is good
script writing.  But the real Big Nose Katie Elder, based on her
portrait, was an ugly woman with a large nose.  In fact, most of the
Earp/Holliday women are portrayed far more attractively than their real
counterparts.  That is standard in the syntax of cinema.  Probably only
Josie Marcus would still be attractive by today's standards.  Of course
standards of beauty change, but it would be nice to see a film in which
the people and not just the scenery and buildings look right.</P>
<P>     There is a problem with Wyatt's distaste for prostitution and his
reforming Mattie and getting her out of the profession.  Again, it is
invented.  Some sources think that he actually was half-owner of brother
James Earp's whorehouse.  In any case, Mattie was apparently not in that
profession before Wyatt Earp knew her, as this film would have it, but
did become a prostitute after Wyatt abandoned her.</P>
<P>     Hype has been around throughout all of history, and perhaps the
emotional need for hype has been with us even longer.  Wyatt was a
convenient person to make a hero in his own time and in ours.  And in
truth he was one of the most colorful figures of the old West.  But even
the most admiring of his serious biographers conclude that Wyatt Earp
was a long way from being a real hero or even an admirable character.
If he fits any of the classic molds, it would be "scoundrel."  And in
showing more than usual of his negative side, though less than the
truth, perhaps this film has its greatest virtue.</P>
