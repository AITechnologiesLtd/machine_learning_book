<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A snappy B-film thriller, excellently paced for broad sweeps of comedy
and fright. Lew Ayres stars in a film he says in a magazine interview,
"Is the kind of picture actors do when they need work." Ayres starred in
the popular Dr. Kildare film series, but during WW11, just after this
film was made, he became a conscientious-objector because of religious
reasons, saying he couldn't kill another human being. Because of that
his popularity hit a low peak and the studios blackballed him. Later on
he joined the medical corps and distinguished himself while working in
the battlefield. The blackball was eventually removed, but not before it
did significant damage to his career. Basil Rathbone, who was a big star
at the time of this film, had a small part as the villain. He took the
part because it only took him only two days to shoot, as he did it in
between takes while he was starring in "The Crossroads."</P>
<P>This is the story about a number of ax murders that has a city paralyzed
with fear. Each of the six ax murderers is revealed to be done by a
lunatic from the insane asylum, who remains at the scene of the crime
but can't explain to the police what happened. Oliver Duffy (Ayres) is
an actor whose show has just closed and while walking home from the
theater at night, he spots a guy with an ax following a beautiful young
lady home. Edwina Brown (Day) thinks he is trying to pick her up when he
warns her she is in danger. When she walks home alone and recognizes
that there is someone following her, he comes to her aid again. He stays
the night sleeping on her fire escape and prevents the lunatic from
striking again. He then sets a trap for the lunatic and captures him the
next night.</P>
<P>Inspector Gallagher (Brown) congratulates the hero, but when Duffy tries
to tell him his theory that there is a mastermind behind these murders
sending these lunatics out with an ax, he is told by the inspector that
he is either seeking more publicity for himself as an actor or that he
is trying to play amateur detective, and that he should leave it to the
police to solve.</P>
<PRE>Spoiler to follow in the paragraph.</PRE>
<P>There is excellent chemistry between Day and Ayres, as she plays the
beautiful bimbo, who is so naive that she fails to tell Ayres who might
be after her because she thinks he might not want to be with her after
she tells him she was engaged to someone who jilted her, someone she met
while studying ballet in Paris. Ayres is endearing as the misunderstood
actor who will only be with a woman who doesn't lie. Together they make
an engaging couple, bringing a wonderful sense of lightness to their
roles. Rathbone is as snide and sinister as ever, hypnotising incurable
lunatic patients to murder the seven people in this city who would
recognize him from his Paris days. He took over Dr. Santelle's identity
when the real doctor died, and therefore jilted Laraine Day to return to
the States and collect the huge inheritance.</P>
<P>The story is as clear as mud, but the performances from the stars was
sparkling. And, even though the film might be dated, it's still a lot of
fun.</P>
