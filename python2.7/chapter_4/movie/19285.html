<P>It's painful for me to witness three outstanding actors waste themselves on
slipshod material. That is the case with James Toback's "Two Girls and a Guy,"
a muddled comedy that pretends to be more than the sum of its parts. What it
lacks is the juice and vigor it needs to transcend its relatively stagy
premise. </P>
<P>The story begins with two women standing on a typical New York street corner
waiting for their boyfriends. They are Carla (Heather Graham), a blonde,
sophisticated working girl type, and Lou (Natasha Gregson Wagner), a brassy,
streetwise brunette. It turns out that they are both waiting for the same
boyfriend, Blake Allen (Robert Downey, Jr.). "You are an unemployed, short
liar," as described in more obscene detail by Lou. Then why do the two women
hang around him and pester him in his glorious apartment? Why he is
irresistibly charming, of course. Blake, however, is a grandstanding
actor...and a pathological liar. He's always lying because as an actor, he's
entitled to it. Oh, really. And his other excuse is that he needs to check on
his mother who may or may not be sick, and whom he restlessly calls. In the
meantime, Carla and Lou try to discover what makes this guy tick, and I
discovered it after the first twenty minutes - the film drones for another
eighty. </P>
<P>"Two Girls and a Guy" starts off quite well with some fine comic timing by
Downey - he steals the show. His delivery of lines is succinctly and flawlessly
executed. His body language is enormous, as evidenced by his Chaplinesque work
in the underrated Chances Are and Chaplin. But his being questioned and
pigeonholed by Carla and Lou makes for irritating viewing. They ask him crude
questions of little substance that yield little discovery. As played by Downey,
Blake is an arrogant S.O.B., who is full of himself and lives on being high and
mighty and dishonest with women. Didn't Carla and Lou suspect such mischievous
behavior from the start? </P>
<P>I could live without certain elements in "Two Girls and a Guy" that downplay
its comical, dramatic rhythms. A gratuitous sex scene between Carla and Blake
is just marking time. That Blake doesn't touch Lou, except for a little peck on
the cheek, elicits discomfort at the screenwriting level since he claims to
love both women passionately. And then there's Lou's suggestion for a three-way
relationship that never builds to anything. Lou and Carla also turn the tables
on Blake by admitting their own sexual trysts - an uninventive method of
eliciting sympathy for Blake. The final dramatic conclusion feels unnecessary
and eradicates the film's central theme of deception. </P>
<P>Robert Downey, Jr. is still superb to watch - look at the scene where he
stares at himself in the mirror and asks, "Why do you do this?" Heather Graham
is also a delight playing a mature, refined woman with class (very different
from her Rollergirl character in "Boogie Nights"). Only Wagner falls short
despite some hysterical scenes where she's describing the sincerity of Denzel
Washington and the dishonesty of Clarence Thomas. Nevertheless, she does start
to grate one's nerves after a while. </P>
<P>"Two Girls and a Guy" is murkily photographed and unevenly scripted with brief
allusions to a superior, similar work, Truffaut's "Jules and Jim."
Writer-director James Toback ("The Pick-up Artist") seems afraid of dwelling on
the sexual, painfully honest questions that two women would have if they were
cheated on by the same boyfriend. The film careens out of control before we
realize that its pointless chit-chat aims to be nothing more than pointless
chit-chat. </P>
