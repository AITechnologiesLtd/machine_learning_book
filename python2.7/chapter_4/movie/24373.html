<P>Oh my word, what a weird movie this is. Rob Reiner's "The Story of Us" is 
atrocious from every angle, a film with a pointless concept, evasion of its 
central issue and the most embarrassing moments of comic relief you could 
possibly imagine. Who wants to see clips of a married couple fighting for an 
hour and a half, especially when we never really understand what they're 
arguing about, we don't know how seriously we're supposed to take it, and it 
keeps getting interrupted by some of the worst-written 'wit' in entertainment 
history? Not me.</P>
<P>Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer star as the husband and wife, who live in 
suburbia and have two young children. He's a sitcom writer. She scripts 
crossword puzzles. They put on an act of happy families for the kids, but in 
private can no longer stand each other. Flashbacks attempt to show us the 
marriage disintegrating. Present-day scenes involving the former lovebirds 
are a combination between shouting matches and uncomfortable silence.</P>
<P>One my major problems with "The Story of Us" is that we're rarely actually 
informed what it is the couple are fighting about. The one scene that does 
reveal the problem at hand is completely insipid -- Willis is trying to tell 
Pfeiffer that his old apartment block has been demolished, and she's doing 
something else, and can't hear him. Aww. The rest of the time the pair are 
telling each other how bad they feel or how much they hate each other, but 
they don't say WHY. What started all the fights we see? Who knows. Reiner, 
the director, and his screenwriters, Jessie Nelson and Alan Zweibel, just 
want to show us a parade of insults.</P>
<P>The characters are strange people anyway. At the dinner table, they always 
play a game called "High-Low", which involves all family members taking turns 
to share their best and worst moments of every day. Do people do things like 
that in real life? I thought that kind of sentimental crap was just for 1950s 
sitcoms?</P>
<P>The dialogue is abysmal. People around me in the screening of the film must 
have thought I was an oddball, because I was literally wincing at it. Then 
again, maybe they knew how I felt. There is an array of dire ironic speeches 
in the movie, all of which are so transparently constructed that they come 
across as read rather than spoken. They appear when Willis and Pfeiffer are 
asking their friends for advice, and resemble obnoxious versions of the 
chatter in "Seinfeld". Typical example: "Hey, I jerked off to your secretary 
last night; is that okay, or against the rules?" "Pound away, man, it's not 
an affront to me." "Cool. Hey -- whaddya think -- is masturbating technically 
cheating, or not?"</P>
<P>Here's an even worse moment, involving Reiner himself, in a smug cameo 
appearance as one of Willis's friends. The two guys are walking in the park, 
talking things over. Reiner stops in the middle of a pathway, bends over and 
says something to the effect of: "You see that? That's my ass, right? Wrong. 
There is no ass. Just a fatty part at the top of my legs. There just is no 
ass! And just as there is no ass, there is no true love. It's all an 
illusion." I swear to God I'm not making this up. The movie really is this 
bad.</P>
<P>The ending is yet another speech, a big, loud emotional moment in which 
Pfeiffer starts screaming a revelation about why she and Willis should stay 
together. This goes against everything that has gone before, and her 
reasoning, essentially, is that even if the couple end up leading miserable 
lives, at least they won't have to face change. Was this movie made by aliens 
who wanted to satirise human irrationality? If so, I wish someone had told me 
before I went in. It would have clicked things right into context.</P>
