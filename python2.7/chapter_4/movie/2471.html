<P>     Ron Howard has a history of making entertaining films that tend
towards weak conclusions (one could call this the "happy endings"
syndrome).  Joining PARENTHOOD and FAR AND AWAY in this category is
Mr.  Howard's newest release, THE PAPER.  For something that starts out
as a boisterous, amusing, potentially-incisive look at the newspaper
business and the people who run it, this motion picture finishes with a
relative whimper.</P>
<P>     Henry Hackett (Michael Keaton) is at a watershed, and the next
twenty-four hours are going to determine a lot--perhaps more than he
could imagine.  Caught in a dilemma between two jobs--his current one
at the tabloid-like NEW YORK SUN and an offer from the prestigious NEW
YORK SENTINEL--Henry must make a decision.  On one hand there are
factors that argue for the career change:  his pregnant wife Martha
(Marisa Tomei) wants security and his bitter feud with his boss Alicia
Clark (Glenn Close) is getting nastier by the moment.  On the other
hand, Henry doesn't want to leave the friendly chaos of THE SUN and the
friends he has made while there.</P>
<P>     No viewer is likely to be bored during THE PAPER.  The film moves
along quickly, using mobile cameras and rapid cuts to keep the energy
level high and the pacing crisp.  This is especially true in the
newsroom scenes, as director Ron Howard attempts to convey the spirit
and atmosphere of the disorganized-but-productive work environment.
His eye for detail is evident.</P>
<P>     Away from the paper's offices, the movie is less successful.  The
personal lives of Henry and his co-workers aren't all that interesting,
and seem scripted rather than real.  This is especially true during the
drawn-out melodrama that characterizes the last fifteen minutes.  There
are also several out-of-place scenes with Robert Duvall and Jason
Alexander commiserating at a bar.  The contrivance used to incorporate
these into the overall plot is a little too obvious.</P>
<P>     One scene within THE SUN's building that rings false takes place
in the middle of a crucial press run.  The climactic struggle that
ensues between two of the main characters looks like it belongs more in
a Three Stooges movie than a pseudo-real look at the behind-the-scenes
newspaper business.</P>
<P>     But there's a lot in THE PAPER that works.  Although most of the
characters are types, the actors play them with sympathy and
understanding.  Three-dimensionality may not be achieved, but attempts
are made to give the men and women in this film some depth, and the
freshness of the performances helps a great deal.</P>
<P>     The main performers--Keaton, Close, and Duvall--do the kinds of
solid jobs expected from them, but it's a pair of less prominent
figures that steal their share of scenes.  Randy Quaid is magnificent
as the gun- toting, paranoid McDougal.  Although not a developed
character in any sense, McDougal has some of the best one-liners.  Then
there's Spalding Gray who, in two appearances, sends up to perfection a
stuffy NEW YORK TIMES-type editor.</P>
<P>     The dialogue is frequently snappy--presumably the product of
screenwriters with ears for the way people actually talk.  There's a
fair amount of natural humor, and only a few occasions when the laughs
are forced.</P>
<P>     THE PAPER is a crowd pleaser and, regardless of any viewer's
experience (or lack thereof) with the behind-the-scenes wrangling that
goes on in newspaper offices, the story is compelling enough to be
affable and entertaining.  While there are no startling revelations
here, the film's atmosphere contains enough strength of realism that
more than one viewer may momentarily think of the goings-on at THE SUN
as they sit down with their morning cup of coffee and look at the day's
headlines.</P>
