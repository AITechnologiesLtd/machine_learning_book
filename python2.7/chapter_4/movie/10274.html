<P>TITANIC is one of the most infamous movies of our time, hugely glorified long
before it even hit theaters. When the budget hit $200 million, TITANIC created
a buzz that would put an entire beehive to shame. Two questions stuck out in
people's minds. One: Will it ever make back the money spent on creating it?
And two: Is it as good as it is expensive? At least now the latter question
can be answered . . . with a resounding "YES!"</P>
<P>In the year 1912, one of the largest ships ever to set sail, left port in
Ireland en route to New York, carrying over 2200 passengers. This ship, named
Titanic, was the most luxurious and supposedly unsinkable vessel ever to hit
the seas. As history would go on to prove, this would merely remain a dream
and a hope in the eyes of those who designed and constructed the Royal Mailing
Steamer, as only 705 of all the passengers and crew who boarded the Titanic
would survive.</P>
<P>James Cameron tells this tale using a pair of destined lovers who come from
two completely diametric social backgrounds. Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate
Winslet) is engaged to marry the overly well-to-do Cal Hockley (Billy Zane),
more to her mother Ruth's (Frances Fisher) accolade than her own. Rose seems
stuck in this pompous, overly eloquent lifestyle, and unlike her snobbish
peers, despises it rather than lavishes in it. On the other hand (and quite a
few decks below) is artist Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), a nobody in the
eyes of society who lives a carefree vagabond lifestyle, taking each day as
its own, unchartered and clean to be preserved and cherished to its fullest.</P>
<P>One night, after closely examining her life, past, present, and future, Rose
finds herself hanging over the railing of the ship, ready to plunge into the
sea. She will put an end to the inevitable - a life of drab, superficial
socializing and false happiness fueled by greed. At this point, Jack comes out
of the shadows and talks her back onto the deck, saving her life with his
charming personality. Instead of being grateful, her fiance and mother are
repulsed by the disreputable savior. Their condescending view of the third
class results in loquacious bashing of Jack, who merely won his way on board
Titanic through a lucky hand of poker.</P>
<P>Despite unremitting threats from those of her own "class", Rose finds herself
charmed by Jack's lightheartedness, whether she wants to be or not, and the
two visit often, all the while falling deeper in love. The sharp parallel in
the classes is excellently presented as we watch Rose and Jack try to carry on
a building love affair of which no one approves. What's funny is how easily we
forget the imminent fate the Titanic will face. We become so engrossed in the
forbidden romance that we forget their love may very well be doomed to failure
regardless of social politics.</P>
<P>The two hours that transpire before Titanic hits a doom-sealing iceberg is in-
and-of itself a marvelous love story. Of all the love stories I've ever seen,
never has one rang out with such conviction. If you don't believe Rose and
Jack are soulmates by the end of this film, you don't have a heart. *True*
love has never been so wonderfully presented - so eloquently, so convincingly,
and so passionately - as it is between these two. This is by far the best
onscreen romance - and maybe offscreen - I've ever known. In fact, in a
beautifully presented moment, Jack draws Rose's nude portrait. It is one of
the most sensual, erotic, and yet heartfelt scenes I've ever seen.</P>
<P>TITANIC can't be acclaimed enough, and surely this is one to be seen and
revered on the big screen. The way Winslet and DiCaprio's eyes gaze upon one
another is so compelling of *true* love that you can't fathom it isn't real.
Best acting nominations? Definitely should be. I can't remember such
emotionally charged visuals as the ones this film embodies. Should Russell
Carpenter receive a Best Cinematography nomination? Hell yes. Some of the
sweeping shots of the Titanic being pulled down into a watery grave brought
tears to my eyes! If TITANIC doesn't receive Academy Award nominations in
*every* applicable category, I'm boycotting the Oscars! I'm talking
screenplay, acting, supporting acting, visual effects, sound effects, art
direction, James Cameron for Best Director, and of course, Best Picture. It
deserves to sweep each and every one of these!</P>
<P>I had a hard time writing this review because all my words are so futile when
trying to describe one of the best done films of all time. James Cameron
should be patting himself on the back until death does he part. Never have I
seen such a *complete* work of cinema art, and if this one doesn't go down in
history, then the Titanic itself shouldn't have either. Even though it runs
over three hours long, there isn't *one frame* of film that should have been
cut. Would you take *one* brush stroke out of the Sistine Chapel? Didn't think
so - and the three hours pass so quickly you won't have time to complain.</P>
<P>Now that I've had the chance to at least *try* and express what a masterpiece
TITANIC is, forget everything I said and go see this movie for yourself. It's
truly a masterpiece in all senses of the word. It will be quite a while before
another movie comes along that can eclipse this one. James Cameron has peaked
with TITANIC, and this will be the one he is remembered for. The 1990's have
peaked with this epic motion picture. In fact, this very easily could be the
peak of 20th century cinema. What a way to top of the century that made movies
a mainstream method of art and entertainment - three cheers and four stars for
TITANIC.</P>
