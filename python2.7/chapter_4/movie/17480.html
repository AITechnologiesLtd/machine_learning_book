Susan Granger's review of "THE KING AND I" (Warner Bros.)</PRE>
<P>You cannot compare this 90-minute animated feature with 1) the
2 1/2-hour Rodgers & Hammerstein Broadway musical, 2) the two-hour
live-action movie, starring Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner, which won
five Oscars in 1956, or 3) the 1943 novel, "Anna and the King of
Siam," based on the real Anna's authentic memoirs.  This is a cartoon
aimed at rugrats who could not possibly sit through either of its
stage and film predecessors. It's an introduction to the enduring
musical classic, that's all. Viewed in that light, it's fun but
Broadway musical purists will hate it, calling it a travesty.  The
story begins, not when widowed British schoolteacher Anna Leonowens
(voiced by Miranda Richardson with singing by Christiane Noll) and her
son (Adam Wylie) arrive in Bangkok to meet the King (Martin Vidnovic),
but while they're still at sea. They're threatened by a typhoon and a
huge, fire-breathing sea serpent, conjured up by the Kralahome (Ian
Richardson), the King's evil advisor. Anna brings Western culture to
the splendor of Siam (now Thailand), and she finds its stubborn,
irascible ruler quite attractive.  "Whistle a Happy Tune,""Getting to
Know You," and "Shall We Dance" still sound lovely, and parents should
know that, in this version, the King doesn't die. Instead, more
emphasis is placed on silly animals - like Tusker, a baby white
elephant; Moonshee, a mischievous monkey; and Rama, a regal black
panther. The animation is colorful and pretty but shows little of the
depth and detail of Disney features. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1
to 10, "The King and I" is a juvenile 4. But, unless you're desperate
for a G-rated movie, I'd advise waiting for the video.</P>
