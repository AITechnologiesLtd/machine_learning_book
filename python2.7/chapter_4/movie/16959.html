<PRE>CUBE (M).  
(Dendy Films)
Director: Vincenzo Natali
Stars: Maurice Dean Wint, Nicole de Boer, Nicky Guadagni, David Hewlett, 
Andrew Miller, Wayne 
Robson
Running time: 92 minutes.</PRE>
<P>Ever since he first picked up a video camera and started
making his own short films at the tender age of eleven, Canadian
writer/director Vincenzo Natali has been intrigued with macabre
fantasy worlds and the darker side of human nature.  These same
elements shape his strikingly original debut feature film, the
visually stunning and imaginative sci-fi thriller Cube.</P>
<P>Six strangers wake up inside a surreal chamber.  It is part of
a labyrinthine system of interlocked chambers and passage ways.  But
some of the rooms are booby trapped.</P>
<P>Quentin (Maurice Dean Wint) is a street wise cop, who brings
with him all the fears, prejudices and suspicions that have become
ingrained over the years.  Leaven (Nicole de Boer, a regular guest
star on tv) is a mathematics student who deciphers the code that
guards each portal.  Holloway (Nicky Guadagni, from Crash, etc) is a
doctor whose intuitive insights into her fellow hostages unlocks their
potential.  Worth (David Hewlett, from The Boys Of St Vincent) is an
architect who suffers from low self esteem and a sense of guilt,
knowing that he unwittingly contributed to the construction of this
insidious structure.  Rennes (veteran actor Wayne Robson) is an
escaped convict whose knowledge is instrumental in helping them
navigate the intricate series of interlocked chambers.  The autistic
Kazan (Andrew Miller) is initially seen as a danger to the other
prisoners, until his hidden abilities come in useful.</P>
<P>These six very different people have to work together as a
group in order to survive.  But, inevitably, personality conflicts and
self interest surface, adding to the air of tension that already
exists.  Cube is a story about survival and human nature.  It cleverly
forces the audience to ponder the question of how they would react if
placed in a similar situation, in an unfamiliar and dangerous
environment with total strangers.</P>
<P>In Cube, Natali (a former story board artist on films like
Johnny Mnemonic, etc) and his collaborators deftly tap into our own
nascent paranoia.  We don't learn who built this formidable structure
- was it the shadowy military/industrial complex, or is it grotesque
joke from some alien intelligence?  We don't learn its purpose, and
the lack of logic is somehow even more frightening.  Nor do we learn
why these six people were chosen to run the gauntlet of this lethal
labyrinth, or indeed, if other people have fallen foul of its booby
trapped chambers.  It is these unanswered questions that contribute to
the film's menacing air.</P>
<P>Natali suffuses the film with an uneasy, claustrophobic
atmosphere.  The opening sequence itself is certainly quite impressive
and grabs the audience's attention.  The set design and visual style
of Cube is impressive, and belie its low budget origins.  This
ambitious film goes far beyond anything achieved by the fecund
imagination behind the recent Dark City, which inevitably disappointed
with its contrived and conventional ending.</P>
