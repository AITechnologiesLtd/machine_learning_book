<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>I think I've said this before (well, I know I've said this before)--I'm
not a sports person.  Sports talk doesn't interest me.  Professional
sports don't interest me.  Football, basketball, baseball -- these
things don't interest me.  I don't hate them, but sports alone can not
hold my attention.  I have the utmost respect for Spike Lee for creating
a film that has a lot to do with basketball and keeping me compelled and
interested through its entire length.</P>
<P>What one must realize when approaching He Got Game is that it's not
really about basketball:  it's about the complicated relationship
between a father and his son.  That's not, by a longshot, all there is
to this film -- Lee takes on a lot of subplots and themes, and the
result is a far-reaching and ambitious picture.  Though it is a
fascinating character study and often very powerful, the film seems to
overflow with messages at times, and Lee never quite finds the right
note for tone and atmosphere.  </P>
<P>The father mentioned above is Jake Shuttleworth (Denzel Washington). 
He's a convicted felon (finding out why is part of the film, so I can't
tell you) serving his sentence in prison; early in the film, he's
approached by the warden (Ned Beatty) with an offer -- he has one week
to convince his own son, Jesus (Ray Allen) to attend Big State
University.  Jesus is the nation's number one high school basketball
player, and he's expected to easily make it into the NBA, and perhaps
end up the greatest player of all time.  </P>
<P>It's a difficult time in Jesus' life, for he has many universities
pressuring him to sign into their program, and he's waiting until the
last possible second to make his decision.  He's also suddenly saddled
with a life of fame, though he still lives in the projects with his
sister, Mary (Zelda Harris).  Jake agrees to the job, and immediately
goes to see his children.  Mary is happy to see him, but Jesus won't
even acknowledge him as his father.  This is where the conflict arises.</P>
<P>The father/son relationship of He Got Game is the central theme, and
Lee handles this aspect of the film with detailed care and respect. 
Washington is superb here (as he always is), and manages to convey the
desperation of a man trapped in an impossible situation.  Midway through
the film, he meets a prostitute named Dakota (Milla Jovovich), whom he
seems to really care for, and this subplot helps to characterize him
further.  Lee and Washington both do a fantastic job creating this
fascinating man.</P>
<P>The other half of the relationship is portrayed effectively by Ray
Allen.  Allen does an excellent job playing a naive high school student
who is suddenly and inexplicably confronted with a chance at greatness. 
His reaction to his father is also very well done, and the scenes
between the two men are engaging -- they dynamics between the characters
work so well that it's impossible not to admire this film for these
scenes.  There are a lot of supporting characters (and a few cameos),
and all of them are colorful and interesting; Jovovich (last seen in The
Fifth Element) really stands out, as does young Zelda Harris.</P>
<P>As well as the central themes in He Got Game work, there just seems to
be a little too much padding, both in story and in execution.  The
cinematography Malik Hassen Sayeed is interesting, but he employs a lot
of strange tricks (fade-to-white is a common one) that are intended to
draw the viewer in, but instead they just distance us from what's
happening on screen.  Aaron Copland's musical score is fantastic, but it
doesn't always fit the mood of the film:  when Jake and Jesus have a
climactic one-on-one game, Copland's heavy strings and
classical-sounding themes made me too aware of the music, and the best
scores blend in and add to the overall image without being distracting.</P>
<P>There's also a lot of sex, and these scenes border on soft-porn
(example -- two college girls are waiting for Jesus when he goes to
visit a university, and . . . you know the rest).  And there's a long,
violent interlude during which a strange individual briefs Jesus on all
of the drugs and sex he'll be missing if he goes away to school.  I'm
not too certain why Lee wanted to be so explicit with the sex and
violence (there are several scenes like the ones described above), but
it seems to detract from what this film is really about.  </P>
<P>And what this film really is about is the relationship between Jake and
Jesus.  Jesus' hatred for his father is deep and potent, and, inversely,
Jake's love for his son is equally powerful -- every scene between the
two is electric and intense.  Spike Lee and his actors pull off this
central relationship so perfectly that the extras on the outside are
only minor detractors.  He Got Game, even in its strangest moments, is a
compelling and engrossing experience.</P>
