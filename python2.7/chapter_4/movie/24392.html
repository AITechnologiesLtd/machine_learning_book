Frequency (New Line Cinema)
Science Fiction.
Cast : Dennis Quaid, James Caviezel, Elizabeth Mitchell, Michael Cera, Noah
Emmerich, Shawn Doyle, and Andre Braugher
Director : Gregory Hoblit</PRE>
<P>A well written tightly directed film, Frequency shows once again that Sci-Fi
done well can be an amazing deep experience.</P>
<P>A time travel story with a difference, Frequency is about a father and son
who establish a short wave radio link across thirty years of time.</P>
<P>With good intentions, information is exchanged between them that begins a
ripple effect, changing one thing after another, leading to a tense game of
cat and mouse with a serial killer.</P>
<P>Frequency builds to a tense and atmospheric conclusion with a couple of
twists that are hardly surprising, yet still manage to give the film a
satisfying ending.</P>
<P>Dennis Quaid is suprisingly good as the Father and Caviezel is even better
as the complicated and moody son. Frequency is definately worth the effort.</P>
<PRE>7/10</PRE>
