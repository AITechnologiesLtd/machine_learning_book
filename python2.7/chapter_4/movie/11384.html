<PRE>THE BIG LEBOWSKI (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>        "All The Dude ever wanted was his rug back."</PRE>
<PRE>        3 out of ****</PRE>
<PRE>        Starring Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore
        Directed by Joel Coen
        Written by Joel & Ethan Coen
        Cinematography by Roger Deakins</PRE>
<P>The Coen brothers make two kinds of movies.  The first kind are 
idiosyncratic takes on established Hollywood genres: BLOOD SIMPLE, 
MILLER'S CROSSING, THE HUDSUCKER PROXY.  The second kind are just 
plain idiosyncratic: dark comedies which can only be described as 
Coen-esque, and represent their best work (RAISING ARIZONA, BARTON 
FINK, FARGO).  Their latest effort, THE BIG LEBOWSKI, belongs in the 
latter category, in that it is a non-generic dark comedy (unless 
KINGPIN-meets-EXCESS BAGGAGE is a genre)--but it is not one of their 
better efforts.</P>
<P>Jeff Bridges stars as Jeff Lebowski, aka The Dude, Duder, or, if 
you're not into the brevity thing, El Duderino.  He's a pretty simple 
L.A. guy with a pretty simple life: he's unemployed, he smokes pot, 
and League Bowling is his first priority.  He bowls with opinionated, 
borderline-psychotic Vietnam vet Walter (John Goodman) and dimwitted 
Donny (Steve Buscemi).  But the Dude's simple life is complicated when 
two men burst into his apartment, dunk his head in the toilet, ask him 
to cough up a lot of money which he doesn't have, then urinate on his 
rug when he can't help them.  It turns out that these men were looking 
for another Jeffrey Lebowski (David Huddleston), this one a 
millionaire, and when The Dude goes to the other Lebowski's mansion to 
get his rug replaced, he is soon embroiled in a complex plot involving 
a kidnapping, a botched ransom exchange, a severed toe, a nymphomaniac 
porn starlet (Tara Reid), some neo-Nazis, a flaky New Age feminist 
(Julianne Moore), and malicious law enforcement officials.</P>
<P>THE BIG LEBOWSKI is certainly idiosyncratic, but there is a sense of 
strain about it.  It's cluttered with contrived attempts to be 
original and offbeat: there's a man in an iron lung, a philosophizing 
character called The Stranger (Sam Elliot), an elaborate 
dream-sequence production number.  By trying so hard, it comes across 
as forced; the Coens' vision is naturally skewed, and by pushing it 
they needlessly call attention to that fact.</P>
<P>There is a lot wrong with the movie, but since it's a comedy, the 
fundamental issue is this: is it funny?  The humour is irreverent in 
the extreme: death, pornography, child abuse, and disabled people are 
treated purely as sources of humour.  Some people in our PC 90s will 
doubtless object to this material on principle; my feeling is that if 
it's funny, it doesn't matter how offensive it is--when something's 
not funny, that's when I start to feel offended.  Fortunately, THE BIG 
LEBOWSKI is very funny, and that is its saving grace.  Bridges wins a 
lot of laughs as the hapless, laidback everyman thrown into an 
absurdist nightmare and unable to extricate himself; Goodman is 
wonderful as his headstrong best friend whose well-intentioned 
interference just makes matters worse and worse.</P>
<P>The other characters, however, exist only because they're funny, not 
because the script is particularly interested in them (most notably 
Julianne Moore's Maude), and the plot is a grab-bag of ideas, many of 
them inspired, but thrown together in a slapdash way.  The movie lacks 
any sense of coherence, and while all the actors are great, several 
are wasted in minor roles: John Turturro has fun with a manically 
over-the-top character, stealing his scenes, but David Thewlis and Jon 
Polito have only walk-on parts, mildly amusing but unnecessary, while 
Buscemi is woefully underused.  The dialogue is refreshing because it 
allows the characters to talk in a roundabout, unhurried, verbose way, 
but frustrating because it takes them an awful long time to get to the 
point.</P>
<P>The Coen brothers have taken pride, through the years, in doing 
things their own distinctive way--they confound expectations--but here 
that strategy has backfired.  For many people (myself included) FARGO 
signalled the Coens' arrival as filmmakers: they had fulfilled their 
potential, and their next movie was expected to be great.  But it 
seems that they have deliberately set out to not make a great movie in 
THE BIG LEBOWSKI, confounding the critics once again.  It is an 
extravagant entertainment, but shallow and ultimately pointless.  
Considered as a self-contained work, it is good; in the context of the 
Coens' career and their considerable talent, it is a disappointment.</P>
