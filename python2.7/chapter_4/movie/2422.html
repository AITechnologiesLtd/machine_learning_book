<PRE>"When I think of an old calendar, I think of George Bush's face."
                                       - James Carville on change</PRE>
<P>     THE WAR ROOM is a fun, little documentary about the Bill Clinton
Presidential campaign.  But don't expect to see much of "Bubba" here--
he's as scarce as a leftover French fry in the White House.  The *real*
stars of THE WAR ROOM are communications director George Stephanopoulos
and chief strategiest James Carville.  And, as this film suggests, both
are just as powerful as the President-To-Be.</P>
<P>     THE WAR ROOM goes behind-the-scenes to show who *really* controls a
political campaign.  Though it's the candidates who get the attention,
it's people like Carville who spend hours thinking up the "sound bites"
and the "catch phrases." And it's a process that's both mesmerizing and
funny to watch.  One of the best bits eavesdrops on a seemingly absurd
discussion about "sign size" and how Jerry Brown has bigger letters
than they do!</P>
<P>     Forget real-life cartoons Dan Quayle and Ross Perot; James
Carville is the fun one to watch here.  He's an instant scene-stealer
who burns with such hatred for George Bush that his features
involuntarily crimp every time he hears "read my lips."</P>
<P>     Stephanopoulos is rather bland.  But his cautious tone and boyish
features make the perfect contrast to the wired and wily Carville.  The
odd couple is backed by a diverse supporting cast including Hillary,
Bill, and a dry-humored Mary Matalin.  And listen for a great Al Gore
impersonation!</P>
<P>     THE WAR ROOM only drags at the end.  As the film approaches
Election Day, everything seems to slow to half-speed.  The last
thirty-minutes are tough--especially with the outcome already known.
But a sincere speech from Carville helps end everything on a high
note.</P>
<PRE>Bottom line:     THE WAR ROOM is a funny behind-the-scenes look at Bill
                 Clinton's Presidential campaign.  Though it drags toward
                 the end, THE WAR ROOM is worth watching for the
                 wide-open, this-is-really-him performance of Chief
                 Strategist James Carville.</PRE>
