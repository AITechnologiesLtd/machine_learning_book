<PRE>10 Things I Hate About You **1/2</PRE>
<P>rated PG-13
starring Heath Ledger, Julia Stiles, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Larisa Oleynik,
David Krumholtz, Andrew Keegan, Larry Miller
written by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith
based on the play "The Taming of the Shrew" by William Shakespeare
directed by Gil Junger</P>
<P>In the wake of SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE's recent Oscar winnings, there
seems to be no better time to release a modern Shakespeare
adaptation. First-time director Gil Junger's 10 THINGS I HATE ABOU YOU
is loosely based on the Bard's "The Taming of the Shrew". As we find
out early in the film, the shrew, Kat Stratford(the Shakespeare
references don't end there), is most often referred to as "heinous
bitch".  Kat(Julia Stiles) is a very pretty girl, but a very
tempestuous one. To her, being nice is too normal, and she wants to do
whatever is unexpected. her sister Bianca(Larisa Oleynik), on the
other hand, is the most popular and gorgeous girl in school. But the
sisters are untouchable because their father(Larry Miller), who fears
pregnancy, will not let them date till college. But then, he decides
on a better idea. Bianca can't date until Kat dates.  It is then that
Joey(Andrew Keegan), a superficial asshole as well as a model, decides
to pay juvenile delinquent Patrick Verona(dont' mind the pun), played
by newcomer Heath Ledger, to take Kat out on a date so that he can
have Bianca to himself. But there is also the new kid Cameron(Joseph
Gordon-Levitt), who feels genuine infatuation for Bianca, and will do
anything to be near her.</P>
<P>The relationship between Kat and Patrick is basically the staple of
the movie, and for the most part, it works out rather nicely. But that
doesn't mean that 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU isn't contrived. There
are moments in the film in which you'll say out loud "Why would anyone
ever do that?" This film is basically nothing more than an
insignificant entry into the way-too-crowded teen movie genre, but
it's actually pretty fun for the most part, and should make most teens
happy. Julia Stiles(T.V's "The 60's") shows a lot of potential while
playing the part of Kat, and it's no surprise that she has a crowded
schedule to round out '99, including a couple more Shakespeare
adaptations.  10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU is dumb for the most
part(especially when it blatantly rips off CAN'T HARDLY WAIT), and it
is no excuse to not read Shakespeare, but it does deserve some credit
for being entertaining.</P>
