<PRE>                        MOM AND DAD SAVE THE WORLD
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1993 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>1:26, PG, Comedy, 1992
Director: Greg Beeman
Cast: Teri Garr, Jeffrey Jones, Jon Lovitz, Dwier Brown, Kathy Ireland,
      Thalmus Rasulala, Wallace Shawn, Eric Idle</P>
<P>     Jon Lovitz, the ruler of a planet of idiots, is going to destroy
Earth.  He sees Teri Garr, an Earth woman, and has Garr and her husband
Jeffrey Jones brought up to his planet.  Lovitz has Jones imprisoned and
tries to marry Garr.  Jones escapes from prison and has to save Garr and
the Earth.</P>
<P>     Given the comic talent in MOM AND DAD SAVE THE WORLD, it could have
been a lot better than it turned out.  However, that doesn't mean that
this film is a waste of time because it is far from that.  This film
will only be liked by those who enjoy "stupid" comedies.  On a scale of
zero to five, I give MOM AND DAD SAVE THE WORLD a four with reservations
(a 3.5).  MOM AND DAD SAVE THE WORLD is rated PG for adult situations
and violence.</P>
<P>     Jon Lovitz (A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN, MR. DESTINY) is not at his best
in this film.  He was better in almost any of his appearances in the old
episodes of "Saturday Night Live".  Jeffrey Jones (STAY TUNED,
BEETLEJUICE) carries most of this film.  He does a great job.  Teri Garr
(TOOTSIE, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND) gives a reasonably good
performance.  Kathy Ireland (NATIONAL LAMPOON'S LOADED WEAPON 1,
MR. DESTINY) is great.  Wallace Shawn (THE PRINCESS BRIDE, SHADOWS AND
FOG) is disappointing.  I expected much better from him.  Eric Idle
(NATIONAL LAMPOON'S EUROPEAN VACATION, MONTY PYTHON'S THE MEANING OF
LIFE) is the best actor in this film.  This film is worth seeing just
for him.  The various creatures in this film are also great, especially
the ones that live in the sewers.</P>
<P>     As I mentioned earlier, MOM AND DAD SAVE THE WORLD is a "stupid"
comedy.  It starts out slowly, but about one-fourth of the way through
the film starts to pick up and doesn't slow back down.  This film is
basically well written.  It is not in the league of such films  as HOT
SHOTS!, NATIONAL LAMPOON'S LOADED WEAPON 1, or THE NAKED GUN 2 1/2: THE
SMELL OF FEAR.  If any children are around, they will love this film.</P>
