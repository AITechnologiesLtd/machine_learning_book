<P>   Pop psychologists say that you can't get away from
yourself; that no matter where you travel, you always have
yourself for company, and so a neurotic in Canada will be 
disturbed in Australia.  Director Ferzan Ozpetek, using a script
he co-wrote with Stefano Tummolini, challenges that prevalent
belief.  In "Steam," an Italian-Turkish co-production known as
"Hamam" in Turkish and "Il Bagno Turco" in Italian,
workaholic Franceso (Alessandro Gassman) makes a
business trip from his office in Rome to a neighborhood in
Istanbul, falls in love with the history-saturated city, and
resolves to stay for a while.  He becomes a hero to the
working-class folks in the neighborhood by saving their
homes.  But does the city change him as well?  Unequivocally
so.  So much does Francesco evolve from an uptight designer
who finds nothing strange about taking cellular phone calls at
the dinner table that even his termagant wife grows to like
him.</P>
<P>   The story, which contains elements of melodramatic Italian
opera, has mythic resonance, entailing the role of fate and
family history and reflecting the cultural duality of its director. 
The bilingual Ferzan Ozpetek, who is at home in the manners
of Turkey and Italy, has fashioned a fable-like narrative about
characters from two distinct civilizations who alter one another
profoundly in the course of a few weeks, empathizing with
one another even before they have gained sufficient
vocabulary for reasonable verbal communication.  When
Francesco receives word from the Turkish Embassy in Rome
that he has inherited some property from his recently
deceased expatriate aunt, he flies to Istanbul fully expecting
to sell off the land at the best price he can get and return
home.  When he discovers, however, that the buyer is intent
on devouring and displacing an entire neighborhood, he
reconsiders his options.  After learning that the business 
bequeathed to him is a defunct Turkish bath, he resolves
lovingly to refurbish the place with the help of a band of new
friends he has acquired.  Though the 19-year-old Fusun
(Basak Koklukava) flirts openly with the handsome Italian,
Francesco ultimately pairs off with another man, Mehmet
(Mehmet Gunsur), who has introduced the staid businessman
to the pleasures of his flesh, the relaxing steam of the Turkish
bath serving as an aphrodisiac.  When Francesco's wife
Marta (Francesca D'Aloja), a buttoned-down woman who has
enjoyed a two-year affair whenever she could get away from
her husband, discovers Francesco in flagrante, she is at first
furious but ultimately accepting of the new man which the
Istanbul environs have made of him.  </P>
<P>   Before tragedy strikes, photographer Pasquale Mari takes
us on a tour of the renowned city, setting his camera on a
ferry that cruises the Bosporous; one of the major bazaars of
the town; a circumcision ceremony involving two boys of
about seven who "become men" without the benefit of
anesthesia in a ceremony complete with belly dancers; a
dining table which features the delicies of Armenia and Turkey
in a thoroughly amicable family setting; and to the hilly,
residential streets surrounding the once-prominent hamam. 
Any in the audience with the preconception that Muslim
countries are alike in their sexual repressiveness will be set
straight by indications of a tolerance of homosexuality and the
open participation of women in dance, physical work, and high
finance.  Alessandro Gassman does a credible job of
changing his character virtually overnight while as his
argumentative wife, Francesca D'Aloja projects a similar
metamorphosis during her own short visit to the country.  </P>
<P>   It's easy to see why the Turkish government and people
would be eager for Americans to see a movie which glorifes
their country to such an extent that it appears like a modern
Shangri-La.  The one scene involving the physical affection
which Francesco has developed for Mehmet is so fleeting and
in such good taste that few liberal Muslims could possibly
object. Supporting performers like Zozo Toledo as an
intermediary handling the affairs of the bath and Basak
Koklukava as a woman who decides she will marry only for
love add depth to this tale, which shows that even as much of
Europe has given up the manana attitude for the rat race,
there are still large pockets of land where a laid-back attitude
can have a salubrious effect indeed.</P>
