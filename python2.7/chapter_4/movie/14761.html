<P>  FLOWERS OF SHANGHAI (Taiwan/Japanese, in Chinese with subtitles)
         A review by Mark R. Leeper in bullet-list form
           from the Toronto Internation Film Festival</P>
<P>     CAPSULE: Static and dull story set in Shanghai brothels of the
1880s.  The camerawork of this film is minimal and we basically have a
stage play in which almost all of the action is offstage.  Nice
historic recreations of room decor cannot make this film interesting to
audiences.  Rating:  3 (0 to 10) -1  (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>   - Directed by Hou Hsiao-Hsien.
   - 124 minutes, but seems a lot longer.
   - Film constructed of long sequences set in beautifully appointed
     rooms.  Long pauses between dialog.  Camera just shifts to the
     character speaking so whole scene appears shot in one take.
   - 1880s Shanghai brothels.  Character names like Crimson and Jade.
     To Western eyes may be hard to tell major characters apart.
   - Music sounds like done on one-string instrument.  Very downbeat.
   - Early scenes in heavy sepia tone though later ones seem to use
     more natural colors.
   - Characters seem to be forever eating, drinking tea, smoking, and
     gossiping.
   - Every scene ends in slow fade to black.
   - Only two scenes have any action beyond talk.
   - Very much like a stage play.
   - Some sort of numbers game repeatedly played over banquets, but not
     clear what the rules are.  It looks something like our Evens and
     Odds.
   - Women seem to be involved with little but jealousy, hatred, and
     greed.
   - Style reminiscent of Fassbinder's EFFIE BRIEST.
   - Shown in a large theater, but many people walking out.
   - Better knowledge of Chinese culture might have helped.</P>
