<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>When Danny Flynn (Daniel Day-Lewis) is released from prison after
fourteen years served for involvement in the IRA, he heads back to his
hometown of Belfast.  Times are rough--the IRA is in full swing, and
Danny's old neighborhood has been reduced to a war-torn ghetto.  When he
arrives, he immediately meets up with his old friend and boxing trainer,
Ike (Ken Stott).  Together, they reinstate an old gym and assemble a
boxing league.</P>
<P>The IRA members for whom Danny went to jail--most notably Harry (Gerart
McSorley)--give Danny a bad time because they feel that his actions are
breaking up the community.  Most people recognize that Danny is actually
helping his fellow citizens, but Harry is not in his right mind.  Even
though he is in danger, Danny remains in Belfast, but only because of
Maggie (Emily Watson), the woman he left behind to spend fourteen years
in prison.  Maggie's father, Joe (Brian Cox), is also a member of the
IRA, but he is interested in slowing the destruction, and finds himself
at odds with Harry.  </P>
<P>The Boxer, directed and co-written by Jim Sheridan, is an intelligent,
brilliantly-acted film.  The story is straightforward and easy to
digest, while the characters are intricate and uniformly interesting. 
Sheridan's direction and pacing is also impressive:  he handles the
story with just the right tone and mood, and the result is an
accessible--if not always completely involving--drama.</P>
<P>I realized as I watched The Boxer that I had never seen Daniel
Day-Lewis in any film before.  This is only relevant because I can't
asses the quality of this performance in comparison to his others; I can
say, however, that this is an excellent performance in its own right. 
Danny is a brooding, thoughtful character--he seems to frequently hold
his words, and he only bursts out once or twice during the film. 
Day-Lewis' portrayal of this man is extremely good; I can tell he is the
kind of performer that loses himself in the character, and this allows
the audience to forget that they're watching a performer do his job.</P>
<P>This is Watson's first performance since Breaking the Waves, and I'm
still as impressed as I was when I first saw her in the earlier film. 
She's a dynamic, emotive actress, and she demands presence the way few
actresses can.  I'm actually surprised that she didn't nail a nomination
for this role--in just two performances, Watson proves she has more
range than most performers working in the business.  The leads are
complimented by a talented and seamless supporting cast:  Cox does a
good job as Maggie's constantly-agitated father, McSorley elicits plenty
of negative reactions as the IRA man who has lost his mind, and Stott is
likable as Danny's alcoholic friend.</P>
<P>A love story like this can only work if we like and identify with the
characters and their story.  Sheridan's script is quiet and subtle
enough that the political subplots don't get in the way of the human
story behind it.  Danny and Maggie are realistic, well-drawn characters;
what makes their relationship interesting is that it's not static--it
changes and evolves through the film, and in ways that make us care
about the people.  </P>
<P>Technically, the film is terrific.  The cinematography is always
impressive, particularly during the boxing matches.  These scenes start
off slowly, but Sheridan's eclectic use of the camera increases in
intensity, and the matches are very exciting to watch.  Similar build-up
is used throughout the film, which results in numerous mini-climaxes
that keep the film entertaining.  However, the film could have been a
bit more emotional.  I like how Sheridan steers clear of that awful
manipulative sentimentality, but some of the scenes that should be
moving feel dry, and are carried only by the performers themselves.  Not
all scenes are like this--much of the film, including the conclusion, is
very satisfying.  </P>
<P>I felt that Sheridan was a little too charitable with Danny's
character, however.  By the last scene of the film, he hasn't done
anything wrong:  he is, essentially, a perfect individual.  The one
complication which I assumed would lead to a violent outburst on his
part was resolved without his involvement, and each time he is forced to
make a split-second decision, he makes the right one.  While this
doesn't hurt our perception of him, his perfect judgment and seemingly
endless wisdom make him slightly difficult to handle as a realistic,
everyday character.</P>
<P>Nonetheless, The Boxer is a good, solid film.  It's a smart, original
love story that both entertains and gives its audience something to
think about.</P>
