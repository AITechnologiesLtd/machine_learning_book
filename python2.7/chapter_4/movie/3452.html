<PRE>                              JEFFERSON IN PARIS
                       A film review by Raymond Johnston
                        Copyright 1995 Raymond Johnston</PRE>
<P>Director: James Ivory
Producer: Ismail Merchant
Written by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala
Starring: Nick Nolte, Greta Scacchi, James Earl Jones
A Touchstone and Merchant Ivory Productions Presentation</P>
<P>     Merchant-Ivory Productions have carved out a niche for themselves
in costume dramas.  Usually they are adaptations of classic or toney
contemporary novels that explore class distinctions amid opulent
surroundings.  JEFFERSON IN PARIS is their first effort in a long time
not to be based on a well-known novel.  It is based loosely on a few
historical incidents that lack any real narrative force.  The poorly
focused dramatic structure, odd casting,  and slipshod approach to
history sink this lavishly produced period spectacle.</P>
<P>    The visual centerpiece of the film, featured prominently in the
ads, points out several of the problems in the film.  The scene is of
a hot air Montgolfier balloon demonstration staged for the king of
France.  The balloon wafts through the screen to the delight of all
those watching.  Jefferson (Nick Nolte); himself an inventor, scholar,
and architect; shows virtually no interest in the experiment.  Instead
he sneaks off with the married Mrs. Cosway (Greta Scacchi) to frolic in
the woods and talk of his broken heart.  This first flight with a live
cargo was the 18th century equivalent of the moon landing, and a noted
scholar shows no interest in it.  It is just a visual diversion used as
a backdrop for speculative romantic scenes.  Historically, the scene
plays even worse.  The experiment for King Louis XVI really took place
a year before Jefferson even arrived in Paris.</P>
<P>    The rest of the first half of the film is a series of constant
introductions to names dimly remembered from history class.  Lafayette
has a somewhat large role.  Others like royal consort Marie Antoinette,
King Louis XVI, charlatan Anton Mesmer and inventor Joseph Guillotine
turn up for heavy handed cameos.  With the parade of unneeded
characters in their elaborate silken outfits, much of the film plays
like an audio visual guided tour of a wax museum.  The stiff and
lifeless performances of many of the cast reinforce the waxworks
notion.</P>
<P>    Nick Nolte never manages to be convincing as Jefferson throughout
any of these diverse encounters.  When questioned about the particulars
of the Declaration of Independence he fumbles for answers like a C
student that forgot to cram for a test.  He does not appear to be the
man that actually wrote it.  A few times in the film he putters with
one of his various inventions, but seems more like a man that bought a
useless tool at a garage sale.  What exactly he is doing as minister to
France is never clear.  If he has official obligations he never attends
to them.  Mostly he just flirts with Mrs. Cosway at boring dinner
parties.  In real life Jefferson was noted for his witty dinner
conversation.  That is not evident in this production.</P>
<P>    The second half of the film manages to come to life slightly thanks
to the arrival of one of Jefferson's slaves from Virginia, Sally
Hemings (played by Thandie Newton).  She is the only one to create a
full fledged vibrant screen character.  She and her brother talk more
convincingly on subjects like freedom than do the rest of the "great
thinkers" in the film combined.  Her portrayal exhibits a little depth,
one persona for in front of her peers (both American slaves and French
servants) and one persona in front of Jefferson and his aristocratic
visitors.</P>
<P>    The story around her character is the most controversial element of
the film.  For years there have been unproven allegations that Thomas
Jefferson had children with his slaves.  The film makers try to tell
this story and distance themselves from it at the same time.  They
distance themselves by creating a framing story for the film.  They are
not saying that this story is true, they are merely relating a story
told by somebody else.  They introduce an African-American  character
named Madison Hemings (James Earl Jones), who late in the 1800s tells
the story that  Thomas Jefferson is his father, rendering the bulk of
the film in flashback.  It is this desire to tell the story and wish to
get away from it that hurt the second half.  The latter part of the
film devolves into a poorly developed love triangle between the widower
Thomas Jefferson, and two teenage girls competing for his affections:
his devoted daughter and his slave.  The film is rated PG-13.  This
rating does not really allow for in depth analysis of adult themes.
The relationship between Jefferson and Sally Hemings is really just
broadly hinted at.  To raise such a controversial story element and
then dance around it as Merchant-Ivory does here is reall a big cop
out.</P>
<P>    Throughout the first part of the film various plot threads are set
up.  The French Revolution is beginning, scientific advances are taking
place, famous artists are at work.  The film makers unfortunately
choose one of the least interesting and least well documented stories
to center on, and then show reluctance to deal with it realistically
anyway.  All of the main characters remain blank ciphers with no
personality and their actions are not clearly motivated by any events
in the story.  JEFFERSON IN PARIS is a lot of lovely sets and fancy
costumes looking desperately for something to be about.</P>
