RELEASE  --  July 15, 1994</P>
<P>     In the midst of an unusually less-exorbitant summer than past
years have seen comes TRUE LIES, the latest collaboration between two
science-fiction-action minds that marks a change of pace for Director
James Cameron and a return to form for his mega-superstar.  Their part
James Bond-esque thriller opus, part black comedy opens and closes with
manic destruction, and intelligently leaves behind a hugely lame
mid-plot that wouldn't seem to fit in the explosive universe of *any*
gratuitously exciting spectacle such as this.</P>
<P>     It's relatively clear what Cameron is aiming for: An average
working man (Schwarzenegger) living a life of big-time violence by day
and mundane family life by evening.  His wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis)
has absolutely no idea the kinds of things he does while they're
apart--running from terrorists across snowy mountainous landscapes in
Switzerland, fist fighting Arabs in bathrooms.  She just knows his
career as Sales Rep. for a computer company is keeping him at work and
away from her and their daughter way too much, too often when it counts
most.  This monologue (apparently derived from a French film) is fine
and good; not terribly original, not terribly without farce.
Unfortunately, Director/Screenwriter Cameron feels it necessary to up
the stakes, supplying a potentially straight-forward action lover's
dream-come-true with a moronic subtext of infidelity that starts
awkwardly and ends up borderline tasteless.</P>
<P>     It seems as though Hellen, the wife Harry Tasker has taken for
granted throughout the 15 years of their marriage, has gotten rather
exhausted with just being the 'good wife.'  She wants to role-play,
find and bring to life the adventure she's inexcusably let pass her
by.  The possibility is handed her by a smug wimp named Simon, who
convinces Helen he is some sort of secret agent when actually he's
nothing more than a lowly car salesman.  Simon rips bravery off others,
gives it his name and delivers the package to women totally bored with
home life and (more to the point) their gutless husbands.  That's his
angle, and it works perfectly.  Only this time Simon has picked just
the wrong woman for his jwa' de' vive' (can you tell I'm not French)
because Helen isn't only loyal and unchangeably devoted, she's married
to the real thing--a super-spy with a pension for brutality.</P>
<P>     Difficult as it is to put up with such debris, we keep trudging
along for we know exactly what will be rewarded us in the end.
However, this black comedy half of the film is worth some negative
comment.  Once Harry finds out what his wife is up to (what he *thinks*
is going on), he appears wind-stripped like nothing any terrorist could
ever culprit.  His esteemed colleague Gib (played by Tom Arnold)
notices and comments that affairs are a part of marriage, but being the
good friend he is wants to cheer up a pal: "We're gonna catch some
terrorists, beat the crap out of them.  You'll feel a hell of a lot
better."  That's funny.  What isn't so cute is Harry's explicit
investigation into his wife's goings-on from that point on; tracking
her, tapping her phone and ultimately--in this film's true low point--
sacking her head, locking her in a dark room and interrogating her.
Helen moves from terror to tears during this out-stretched, difficult
to watch sequence that builds a major wall against any sort of
satisfying outcome the film might want to reach ... might have done so
successfully.  Luckily, the wise-cracking Tom Arnold is around to
smooth the path every now and again.  If not for him, what has to be
some 35-minutes of degrading nonsense (including a husband's sexual
fantasia watching his wife strip-tease around a bed post) would be
intolerable.</P>
<P>     TRUE LIES comes to during its back half, in which Harry has to
save his wife and country from a psychotic Arab liberalist.  Reportedly
this film cost as much as our national debt to make, and it inebriates
us during a fantastic limo rescue scene (Schwarzenegger dangling from a
helicopter and pulling Curtis from an impossibly-moving car, just
before it crashes to the ocean's surface) and an even more spectacular
sequence, featuring Schwarzenegger at the helm of a marine harrier,
that ranks with Renny Harlin's CLIFFHANGER opening as one of the very
best jaw-droppers in film history.</P>
<P>     When Schwarz landed that baby, I wanted to forget what came before
it.  I really did.  But I couldn't.  James Cameron's first (I believe)
production outside the science-fiction realm--in which he's master--is
a mock epic, giving trivial events monumental proportions.  It's not
only unnecessary to the final conclusion ... it's a little sick.  I'm
not sure at what point Cameron lost his way writing this thing, found
it detrimental not to stoop, but despite what's wrong here is a whole
lot to gaze at and laugh at.  TRUE LIES is one humongous detonated
bomb, with no story to back it up.</P>
<PRE>Rated R
