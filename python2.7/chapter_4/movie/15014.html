<P>   Recent films like "Pleasantville," "Waking Ned Devine," and
"The Truman Show" convey the spirit of small-town life, all
executed quite well with original ideas, creative expression,
and satiric impact.  But however intelligent they are, none
bears the depth of character, the simultaneously earthy
and mystical, romantic and hard-scrabble intensity of
"Dancing at Lughnasa."  Successfully made into a film from
Brian Friel's notable play by director Pat O'Connor, "Dancing
at Lughnasa" is now opened up, creating variety to the
primarily verbal exchanges that took place on stages from the
Abbey to Broadway some years back.  Movies like this one
make me realize still again why I gave up going to theater in
favor of focusing on the cinema.  How else but in
photographer Kenneth MacMillan's camerawork could we
marvel at the elegant framing device, which highlights a lad
of eight years flying a kite which is illustrated with a
countenance at once Celtic and pagan, letting his plaything
glide optimistically into the sky, then tripping ominously and
losing his hold on the trinket?  Nor could staging, however
shrewd, transport us to the craggy hills of the Emerald Isle,
knolls over which a young lover would arrive unexpectedly by
motorcycle and beyond which a rickety bus would carry home
a lost old man ejected from service to lepers in Africa.</P>
<P>   Rich in language as you'd expect from the writer of such
works as "Philadelphia, Here I Come" and "A Month in the
Country," Brian Friel's autobiographical tale is notable for
capturing the ambiance of a particular time and place.  More
important, though, it celebrates the fortitude of five women,
sisters who have lived together, all unmarried, in a land
suffering from a dire shortage of eligible men.  Through an
potent analysis of their dissimilar characters, Frank
McGuinness, who has adapted Mr. Friel's play to the screen,
portrays a hardy bunch, often acquitting themselves as a
quincunx of quidnuncs, who skirmish and forgive one another,
following each minor tempest with a steaming cup of bracing
tea.  The story is narrated by Michael, a love child of one of
the sisters, who looks back some years after a fateful
summer of 1936 when things irrevocably changed for the
family.</P>
<P>   The title comes from the feast day honoring Lugh, the
pagan god of music and light, a fellow whose renown bring
forth a Dionysian gambol in the back hills of a small town in
Donegal. During the feast of Lughnasa men and women
dance about a fire, the men not unfriendly to the bottle
occasionally dashing across the flames.  The five Mundy
sisters who have brought up the illegitimate Michael, son of
Christina (Catherine Mc Cormack) and her lover Gerry Evans
(Rhys Ifans), can barely piece together a living, sustained
largely by the small salary brought home by the family's
guide, schoolteacher Kate (Meryl Streep).  Two others bring
home handiwork, making gloves for the sale in the town, but
all are determined to find what happiness they can in what
must seem to modern, urban denizens as an awfully grim
existence.  </P>
<P>   Perhaps psychologists can have a field day analyzing how
these women, presumably inheriting similar genes and
carrying on their tasks in the same, circumscribed
environment, could vary so much.  Rose (Sophie Thompson)
is simple-minded and bonds most closely with Agnes (Brid
Brennan), who sees Rose as the child she has longed to
have.  Christina, the most attractive of the bunch, pines for
her wandering boy friend, who motors through the village
periodically and unexpectedly. Kate, known to some as a
"righteous bitch" and who, in one point of genuine insight
agrees with the harsh verdict, disapproves of pagan rituals
and is appalled by dancing, especially if engaged in by
"mature ladies"--which she considers her hardy band of
women.  Perhaps the most involving character is Father Jack
Mundy (Michael Gambon), an all-but-defrocked priest, who
has spent most of his career in Uganda with the aim of
teaching Christianity but who has come back converted to
paganism by the African people he has grown to love.</P>
<P>   Director O'Connor has easily fulfilled what must have been
his principal aim--to make a staged work with all the blocking
and other conventions that the theater entails into a drama of
cinematic interest.  The linguistic richness comes across,
words spoke with a variety of fascinating Irish accents which
American actress Meryl Streep manages to maintain
throughout, utterances which unfold the passions and
unfulfilled dreams of the five women and the three men who
have come into their lives.  The muted nature of the
enterprise makes one particular burst of passion all the more
electrifying, as the old, shoddy radio they have named
Marconi comes to life with lilting music bringing the five
women to their feet in a explosion of dance.  </P>
<P>   Gerald McSorley's narration brings a special poignancy to
the proceedings in an ensemble piece made particularly
trenchant by Michael Gambon as a befuddled priest whose
long affiliation with a people far different from him endows
him with a humanity scarcely approached by the others of his
clan.</P>
