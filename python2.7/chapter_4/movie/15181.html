<PRE>JOHN CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Edited by Mark O'Hara
Copyright 1998 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>Don't let the title fool you -- Vampires is not a horror film. Vampires is
a Western set in modern times where the good guys carry big silver
crossbows and the bad guys wear long incisors. Plotless and mindless,
Vampires is proof that a good director, actor and film personality can make
a testosterone-laden movie entertaining.</P>
<P>Jack Crow (James Woods) is a vampire slayer. Scratch that, Crow is a
vampire slayer with a serious attitude. Having seen his mother and father
fall to vampires, Crow has his mind set on killing all vampires. From
childhood, the Catholic Church has raised Crow to be a vampire slayer. The
Catholic Church, from an exorcism gone awry, created the first vampire,
Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith), centuries ago. As the movie opens, Crow and
his team go into action by taking out a whole house of vampires.</P>
<P>After the house incident, Crow has a nasty run in with Valek. Valek is the
most powerful vampire because he was the first. Valek escapes Crow's first
attempt to take him out, though Valek ends up biting a hooker before his
getaway. Crow uses the hooker (Sheryl Lee) as a vampire-radar of sorts.
After being bitten by a vampire, a person doesn't turn into a vampire
immediately. There is a period before the bitten person "turns." During
this crucial time a telepathic link is set up between the bitten and the
master (the vampire who did the biting). Crow uses the hooker to track down
Valek.</P>
<P>As I mentioned, Vampires is proof of what a good director, good actor and
film personality can do to enhance a film. Last week I saw Soldier, a
terrible film; the director was a rookie, the lead actor didn't have much
to work with, and the film had no personality. Vampires has all three.</P>
<P>Director John Carpenter knows how to put together some exciting scenes –
though, his pacing for the film as a whole is off. Carpenter mixes the
right amount of action, horror, and humor for the action scenes, and he
builds a lot of tension. But, he is unable to pace the film correctly. The
best parts of the film are the opening vampire hunt and the last
thirty-five minutes. The middle section of Vampires is slow and sometimes
painfully so. Had Carpenter taken the movie and distilled it - stripped it
of the useless character development and the love story – it would have
been to die for. The opening vampire hunt is gory with vampires dragged
into the sun and burned instantly to a crisp. There are other extremely
gory scenes, like a man split in half, all shown onscreen. This is
definitely not a movie for the squeamish.</P>
<P>The second thing that Vampires has is James Woods. Woods brings to screen a
brash will-take-no-crap attitude that is used effectively as a tool of
humor. I loved the way that Woods breaks in the new priest and how he later
deals with the master vampires. Woods brings a personality to the character
Jack Crow that would have been lacking if another actor attempted the part.
Woods just drips of coolness onscreen; he's cool, tough, and arrogant.
There would be no other actor better for the part of Jack Crow.</P>
<P>The personality of a film is important. Take for example, Soldier, the film
had no personality - it was bland. Vampires, on the other hand, has
personality. The mixture of Woods, the way the film was shot, the lone
guitar in the film score, and the sure-handedness of Carpenter's direction
all add up to make this movie enjoyable.</P>
<P>Vampires is not Carpenter's best work, but it's also not Carpenter's worst
work either. Ranking at the top is Carpenter's The Thing, Halloween, Escape
from New York, and Escape from LA. Vampires is a middle-of-the-road,
average Carpenter film.</P>
<P>Would I recommend Vampires? Definitely, it's an entertaining film. For
those of you worried that Vampires is a scary horror film, it's not –
though it is quite gory. I enjoyed Vampires because it's a modern Western
where the bad guys are vampires. If you have two hours to spare, catch
Vampires in the theatres.</P>
<P>[Rated R – Violence, Excessive Gore, and Nudity. Running Time: 107 Minutes]</P>
