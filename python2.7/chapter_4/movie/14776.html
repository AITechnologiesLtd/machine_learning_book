<PRE>       J'AIMERAIS PAS CREVER UN DIMANCH (French with subtitles)
         A review by Mark R. Leeper in bullet-list form
           from the Toronto Internation Film Festival</PRE>
<P>     CAPSULE: Liebes meets Tod.  This was a film about sex and death.
A morgue attendant accidentally revives a dead woman through
necrophilia and brings her into his world which is heavy on orgies.
This film says something obscure about the relationship of sex and
death, but imparts no insights.  To make matter worse this print was
poorly subtitled into English from French. Rating: 4 (0 to 10) 0 (-4 to
+4)</P>
<P>   - An attractive 18-year-old dies on a disco floor and gets sent to a
     morgue.  One of the attendants, Ben (Jean-Marc Barr) is so
     attracted by her that he attempts necrophilia.  We see him
     crawling away after a shock.  In the middle of sex the dead teen
     has come back to life.
   - The morgue attendant was just adding a new form of sex to his
     collection of kinks.  He was already part of a group that gets
     together for S/M sex.  The revived teen, Teresa (Elodie Bouchez)
     joins them.
   - Moral dilemma of Teresa's father.  Ben has abused his daughter's
     body, but in doing so has saved her life.
   - Part of this opaque allegory is a man saved from suicide who joins
     in the sexual hijinx.  Also involved is a man in the final stages
     of dying of AIDS, a close friend of the morgue attendant.  He does
     not get involved in the orgies.
   - The subtitles of our print were white, often on a white background
     making them often hard to read, but I don't think there was a
     whole lot of meaning there that was lost.
   - The title means "Don't let me die on a Sunday."</P>
