<P>[I am posting five reviews of STAR TREK VI.  I could easily swamp the group
with reviews of this movie, so I will probably not post any more unless
they say something very different than those posted here (e.g., a review
of the fashions in STAR TREK VI :-) ).  Followups are directed to
rec.arts.startrek to keep the discussion in the appropriate group.

<PRE>                     STAR TREK VI: THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY
                       A film review by Roger Snappy Rubio
                        Copyright 1991 Roger Snappy Rubio</PRE>
<P>Starring William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan,
         Nichelle Nichols, Walter Koenig, and George Takei
Also Starring Kim Catrall, Christopher Plummer, Michael Dorn, and
              David Warner
Directed by Nicholas Meyer</P>
<P>     I'm glad I waited.  STAR TREK VI does not disappoint its fans.
This supposedly last installment of the STAR TREK movies is a worthy
ending to the saga that is STAR TREK.  And although it is not better
than STAR TREK II (my personal favorite), among all six I would rate it
as the second best in the series.</P>
<P>     STVI (or, as I like to call it, the apology for STAR TREK V) is a
effective blending of elements of episodes from the old STAR TREK and
elements which have made the movie series so successful: adventure,
sensationalism, humor, a good plot, and an overall good time.  It is
also a huge metaphor for what is going on the world today.  Anyone who
goes to see this movie can quite easily recognize which character
represents who in today's world.  Captain Kirk and General Chang (played
by Christopher Plummer) can be construed as the hard-liners, while
Captain Spock and Chancellor Gorkon (played by David Warner) could be
seen as Reagan and Gorbachev.  There are a lot of parallels in this
movie towards the Soviets, and it makes me think that they couldn't
think of a good plotline, so they used what's happening in the world
today.  But don't let that phase you--it's still a good movie.  In this
movie as in today's world, there are those who would lose by peace, and
would do almost anything to protect the prospect of imminent war.  But
despite the hidden message and likeness to today's goings-on, this movie
is still a romp through space, where we meet and see all kinds of races
and places.</P>
<P>     But back to the "blending" part.  I won't tell you exactly what
goes on, but I can tell you there are elements in this film from old
STAR TREK episodes like "Whom the Gods Destroy" and "Court-Martial," and
things from the previous movies, like Meyer as a director (he directed
STII, for those of you who don't know); ILM doing the special effects
(not those cut-and-paste effects of STV), which where damn good, as
always; Leonard Nimoy as a writer; and other than the technical aspects,
the basic (and not fabricated and abused) spirit of the STAR TREK
series.</P>
<P>     The only thing I was apprehensive about was the addition of Kim
Catrall as Lt. Valeris.  But she does a pretty good job, and was, in my
opinion, fairly convincing.  Christopher Plummer and David Warner have
established themselves too solidly as human actors instead of alien
actors, so I didn't really see them as Klingons, but they still manage
to do a good job acting like them.  There's even a surprise cameo, but I
won't tell you who it is of course.  As for the rest of the crew, they
all did a fine job (now that they had a solid script).</P>
<P>     All in all, if you like STAR TREK, go see this movie.  You'll have
a good time, and most of all, you won't be disappointed.</P>
