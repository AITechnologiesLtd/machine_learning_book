<P>Serving porridge for attempting to withdraw building society funds other
than his own, Martin (Hugo Speer of Full Monty fame) meets saxophonist and
would-be phillosopher Jack (Clarence Clemons) who passes on worldly wisdom
and, when Martin's parole comes up, his beloved instrument, along with the
advice that Martin should go forth and blow his own trumpet.
Inspired, Martin forms a swing band, with soccer fanatic Buddy (Scott
Williams), intelligence- challenged NF croney Oi (James Hicks) and the brass
section of the Orange Brigade members led by Mighty Mac (Sayle). And
although she is now married to the police officer responsible for banging
Martin to rights, even ex-girlfriend Joan (Lisa Stansfield) is persuaded to
come along for the ride.</P>
<P>What ensues is the Commitments thrown into the blender with the Full Monty
and a few episodes of Brookside then baked for a few hours to produce a nice
fruity laughter cake. If you liked the Commitments but found the constant
in-fighting and dark humour something of a down point then you'll like
Swing - you won't love it, but you'll like it.</P>
<P>Its a feel good movie with lashings of Alexie Sayle's wit, Nerys Hughes'
sharp tongue, and Lisa Stansfield's singing. Dermot Kierney as the
lottery-winning nutball fails to add to the broth and Nick Mead's
made-for-TV style of direction will do little to impress cinema-goers. Lisa
Stansfield too seems a little bland as the leading love interest for the
stricken Martin, but her powerful singing voice makes up for this and she's
amiably likeable in a scousish kind of way.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, in a month which sees the debut of such British giants as
Notting Hill, Swing will find it hard to hold its own without coming off as
predictable and under-produced. Any other time and it might have won more
recognition.</P>
