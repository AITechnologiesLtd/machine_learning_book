                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<PRE>Chad'z rating: *** (out of 4 = good)
1989, R, 91 minutes [1 hour, 31 minutes]
[documentary]
Written, produced, and directed by Michael Moore.</PRE>
<P>America is a country of opportunity because of its capitalist system where
anyone can make something for his/her self if they aim high and work hard.
The downside to so much freedom is the fact many may have to suffer in order
for others to succeed. "Roger & Me" proves this to be true as an entire city
is made to suffer because of the greed of a few. </P>
<P>General Motors is the largest and richest auto manufacturer in the world. It
got its start in Flint, Mich., where it employed more than 30,000 workers up
until the mid-1980s. When GM Chairman Roger Smith announced the closing of
the Flint plant, the city was devastated and Moore decided to make this
documentary about his efforts to meet with Smith to voice his concern and
show him how badly Flint was hurt. </P>
<P>Moore narrates and directs this documentary about his hometown of Flint,
which quickly deteriorates from a booming industrialized city almost to a
modern ghost town. But this is not a grim, depressing story. The film has a
lighthearted and satirical tone: instead of narrating the film through
graphic reality, Moore instead uses "Americana" footage to reflect the
subjects, such as clips from old comedies, movies, television, etc. </P>
<P>Usually the subjects of documentaries are not the filmmakers, but Moore
becomes another victim of GM's business decisions as he tries to find Smith
and is constantly ejected from restaurants, country clubs, health centers,
and GM headquarters in Detroit. </P>
<P>Sometimes reality can be more brutal than fiction, but sometimes it can be
funnier too, and both happens here. Throughout the film there are several
instances of people obviously lying to Moore and giving him the run-around
just to get him to leave. It's funny to watch because they are such terrible
liars, but it's also disturbing when we realize how cruel some people can be.</P>
<P>What is so unique about this film is its ability to tell a rather bleak
story through lighthearted methods. A parade is held and the entire city
turns out for it, but as Miss Michigan rides atop a float, in the background
we can see dozens of boarded-up stores and the frowns on the people's faces.
Moore also throws in several celebrity interviews, and they all say the same
thing; "Keep your head up and your spirits high. Work hard, and things will
pick up eventually." Try telling that to the woman who sells rabbits out of
her backyard for $20 a week, or to the guy whose job it is to evict people
from their homes.</P>
<P>After three years of trying to contact the GM execs, Moore is finally given
a chance to speak at a GM stockholder's convention, Roger Smith himself
abruptly ends the meeting and no one seems to notice Moore.... you don't know
whether to laugh or cry.</P>
<P>The last line of the closing credits reads: "This film may not be shown in
Flint..... because all the movie theaters have closed." This line sums up the
entire mood and theme of "Roger & Me" - lighthearted, but shockingly real. </P>
