<PRE>A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Whether you see Big Momma’s House or watch Lawrence’s 1999 film Blue Streak, 
you will have seen the other movie. The two films contain the same lame 
comedy and rely on Lawrence's charm and energy to perk things up. While 
Streak was tolerable, House is rarely satisfactory. There are few genuine 
laughs from the script by Darryl Quarles and Don Rhymer. The mostly juvenile 
humor found here belongs in an Adam Sandler movie. </P>
<P>Malcolm (Martin Lawrence) is an undercover cop, and a master of disguise. His 
latest case involves a man who robbed a bank. His bank teller girlfriend 
Shelly (Nia Long) may or may not have been in on it. When the man is released 
from prison, Shelly flees her home bringing her son Trent (Jascha Washington) 
along with her. She decides to visit her obese mother, known to most as Big 
Momma. Since Momma has left town, Malcolm sees an excellent opportunity. He 
disguises himself as Big Momma, hoping Shelly will eventually crack and tell 
him everything she knows, including her boyfriend's whereabouts. Several 
problems arise with this plan including Malcolm’s poor cooking ability, 
keeping the undercover project a secret, and delivering a baby. Further 
problems arise when Malcolm begins to fall in love with Shelly and the real 
Big Momma returns home. Anything that could possibly go wrong does. The 
script squeezes out any available laughs. No matter how hackneyed or cheap 
they may be. </P>
<P>There is plenty to giggle at in this movie for elementary school students. 
The movie contains everything your average 4th grader would laugh at. 
Overweight persons, feces, and flatulence are all present. A few chuckles 
escaped my lips, but most gags did not qualify for anything more than an 
amused smile. No matter how inane it gets, the humor is bearable. Big Momma’s 
House never fails at being (or trying to be) funny. The main problem is a 
dreadful story. After an outline of events, the script literally stops. There 
are sixty or so minutes in between where nothing feels fake or scripted. 
Lawrence's comic experiments fill this period of the movie. His energy is 
vital for navigating through a screenplay littered with every southern cliché 
you can think of (fried chicken, a spirited church ceremony, etc.) 
Implausibility is everywhere. Any person with the slightest intelligence 
would realize that Malcolm’s Big Momma is actually a man. Clues are present 
in lots of places, but the characters are clueless. Even worse than some of 
the humor and the implausibility is when Momma morphs into a romance in its 
final minutes. The film certainly does not work as one. It made me wonder why 
Hollywood does not turn scripts from nine and ten year-olds into movies. Most 
of these films would be of a much higher quality and have far more depth than 
this one.</P>
<P>Martin Lawrence exhibits a level of animation common in his movies. He just 
needs better material to work with. The beautiful Nia Long was surprisingly 
dull. She is stuck in what essentially is a one-man movie and does not do 
much. Other supporting performances are easily forgettable and seem 
restrained. The filmmakers were obviously trying to make this movie appeal to 
a young audience, as is apparent from Big Momma’s PG-13 rating. However, the 
film would be better suited as a loud, bawdy, and rude foulmouthed comedy. 
One can only hope that Nutty Professor II: The Klumps will be better.</P>
<P>There is nothing alive in this movie. The screenplay and acting both fall 
short, and the ending of the film is a horrendous and unbelievable happy 
conclusion. The premise gets very tiring and never reaches the guilty 
pleasure zone like Blue Streak did. Lawrence almost saves the lackluster 
humor, but achieves only modest success. This movie might appeal to kids or 
teens, but it did not delight or entertain me.</P>
