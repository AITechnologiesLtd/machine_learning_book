<PRE>ACROSS THE PACIFIC (1942)</PRE>
<PRE>        "All that funny business on the boat--what did it mean, really?"</PRE>
<PRE>        3.5 out of ****</PRE>
<P>Starring Humphrey Bogart, Mary Astor, Sydney Greenstreet
Directed by John Huston
Written by Richard Macaulay
Cinematography by Arthur Edeson</P>
<P>        The Genoa Maru is a ship bound for Japan, with a handful of 
passengers aboard.  They are Rick Leland, an artillery officer 
recently given a dishonourable discharge; Dr. Lorenz, an intellectual 
American ex-pat who has lived in Asia for 30 years; and Alberta 
Marlow, a woman from Medicine Hat, Alberta, who sells peanut brittle 
in a ten-cent shop.  Well, that's who they say they are.  We're pretty 
sure they're lying, and, indeed, they are.  Finding out who they 
really are--and why they're on board the vessel at the same time--is 
one of the many pleasures in John Huston's ACROSS THE PACIFIC.</P>
<P>        The passengers are also Humphrey Bogart, Mary Astor, and Sydney 
Greenstreet, reunited with Huston and cinematographer Arthur Edeson 
(CASABLANCA) for the follow-up to the director's stunning debut, THE 
MALTESE FALCON.  With a cast like that, under the guidance of a master 
like Huston, the film seems almost guaranteed to offer splendid 
entertainment--and that is precisely what it does.</P>
<P>        The events take place during World War II, and involve a sinister 
anti-American plot by the villain, Greenstreet, who is allied with the 
Japanese.  To reveal more would be to spoil the fun: Richard 
Macaulay's script is tight, tense, and compelling.  But, this being a 
Bogart movie of the 40s, it's also fairly predictable: we know he'll 
defeat the villain, and we suspect he'll win the lady's heart.  What 
makes it so entertaining are the little things.  The dialogue is 
wonderful: fast, funny, and perfectly suited to these actors.  
Greenstreet plays an expansive, sophisticated villain as only he can; 
Bogart is, well, Bogart, except here his persona is a little less 
cynical than usual, a little more playful.  And Astor's Alberta Marlow 
is particularly refreshing--a smart, independent woman who loves to 
engage Bogey in verbal fencing matches.  Their repartee is 
consistently witty and playful.  After their first kiss, which happens 
while Alberta is still finding her sea legs, she remarks, I feel sick; 
Bogart asks if that's normal, and she retorts, how do women usually 
respond when you kiss them?  They trade pointed rejoinders throughout, 
to our delight.  If only people talked like that in real life; if only 
they still talked like that in the movies.</P>
<P>        The interactions between other characters are equally sharp.  After a 
shooting incident, Bogart and Greenstreet discuss the preponderance of 
guns on the ship, and when each reveals his own weapon, Bogart 
playfully comments, "Mine's bigger than yours," relishing the silly 
Freudianism.  They are later joined by Joe Totsuiko (Victor Sen Yung), 
a second-generation American (with hidden motives, of course) who 
desperately wants to sound like an authentic Yankee, so he speaks with 
splendidly overblown American diction, calling Rick "Ricky" and saying 
things like "I wonder if those Panamanian mamas are all they're 
cracked up to be."</P>
<P>        If the characters did nothing else but talk, this would be great 
stuff, but there's no shortage of secret identities, double-dealings, 
and revelations.  The pace never flags, sweeping us along from Halifax 
to New York and on to Panama, where the film ends, despite the title.  
In Panama, the characters finally confront each other, all truths are 
finally unveiled, and then the finale devolves into a rather mundane 
action sequence.  The ending, indeed, is the weakest part of the 
movie, particularly in the wake of THE MALTESE FALCON, where the 
conclusion was absolutely perfect.</P>
<P>        ACROSS THE PACIFIC was filmed during World War II, and not 
surprisingly, it contains no small amount of pro-U.S. propaganda.  The 
final shot shows American planes flying west to (paraphrasing Bogart's 
character) help the Japs commit hara-kiri, and could have been lifted 
straight from a war-time documentary.  There is also a gallery of 
laughable Asian caricatures and some extremely racist dialogue.  At 
one point, Bogart complains that all Japanese look the same, and Astor 
says they don't--upon close examination; Greenstreet refers to the 
Japanese as "wonderful little people."  The actors seem to be aware of 
how ridiculous these lines are, and deliver them tongue-in-cheek, so 
that these moments are not as ugly as they might have been.  
Fortunately, while Huston himself left to help the war effort before 
filming was complete (Vincent Sherman took over), his movie plays 
mostly as entertainment, not propaganda, and it is a thoroughly 
enjoyable diversion.  Only a director whose first film was THE MALTESE 
FALCON could make a second film this good, and have it be a weaker 
effort.</P>
