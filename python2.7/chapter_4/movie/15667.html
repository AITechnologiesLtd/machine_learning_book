<P>"Patch Adams," is highly reminiscent of the wonderful 1990 film, 
"Awakenings," also starring Robin Williams. There are many similarities, 
as well. Both films are based on true stories; they both take place, 
partially, in 1969; they are both set in a hospital; and they both mix 
humor and drama. Maybe this is one of the biggest problems with, "Patch 
Adams," since it is far inferior to, "Awakenings," which felt so much 
more realistic and honest. That isn't to say that, "Patch Adams," is a 
bad film, though. Actually, I enjoyed it quite a lot up until the highly 
disappointing climax.</P>
<P>Robin Williams stars as Patch Adams, a depressed man who, at the start 
of the film, checks himself into a mental hospital after an attempted 
suicide. After helping his roommate get over his fear of squirrels, 
which he imagines have surrounded the room, Patch is suddenly cured, 
realizing that making others feel better through humor helps his own 
problems to disappear. Sure enough, two years later, Patch starts a 
medical school in Virginia, and begins sneaking into the hospital and 
having fun with all of the patients, some of which are terminally ill. 
Although he firmly believes that making other people laugh helps them to 
feel better, the hospital board disagrees, putting his plans of becoming 
a doctor into jeopardy.</P>
<P>For the majority of its running time, "Patch Adams," was very enjoyable 
for a number of reasons. The characters were all superbly handled, and 
written very well. Philip Seymour Hoffman was a standout as Williams' 
college roommate, who begins to grow envious of him when Patch starts to 
get some of the highest grades in the class, even though he does not 
seem to ever study. The character could have been a throwaway role, but 
Hoffman turns a potentially one-dimensional character into a completely 
believable person who is very serious about becoming a doctor, and is 
struggling to get by. Another element I liked in the film was its smooth 
mixture of comedy and drama. Although often funny, Williams never went 
overboard as he occasionally does, and there were a few gentle, quiet, 
and touching moments. A subplot involving the blossoming romance between 
Williams and a serious pre-med student (Monica Potter) was smartly 
written, and the payoff caught me totally by surprise, even if its 
strains at drama, in this respect, came off as slightly obvious. </P>
<P>Before the climax arrived, I liked the movie, but did not love it. The 
workings of the plot were a little too conventional and predictable for 
my taste. However, when the ending came, the whole effect of the movie 
was pretty much ruined. Without giving away what happens, it concluded 
with a courtroom scene that was so falsely sentimental and cliched that 
I felt rather betrayed at its severe reaches for cheap melodrama. It was 
at the point that I knew for a fact how everything was going to end, and 
it saddened me to think that the screenwriter, Steve Oedekerk, took such 
an easy way out. </P>
<P>When all is said and done, "Patch Adams," is an earnest attempt at 
making a film that is both comedic and moving, and as a vehicle for 
Robin Williams, it is perfect. Williams, along with his last two 
pictures, "Good Will Hunting," and, "What Dreams May Come," has proven 
that he is an actor with a lot of range, and doesn't always have to be 
silly. But coming out of, "Patch Adams," I had this strange feeling 
that, although based on a true story, the film took extreme liberties in 
order to construct it into a more managable film for mainstream 
audiences. This is quite unfortunate, since, "Patch Adams," clearly held 
so much promise. </P>
