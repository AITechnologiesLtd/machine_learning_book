<PRE>                                GONE FISHIN'
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>     First, the good news.  The two leads of GONE FISHIN', Joe Pesci
and Danny Glover, mumble so many of their lines that a large portion of
the film is incomprehensible.  But the audience can hear the rest of
the movie.  That's bad news.</P>
<P>     Although I usually save the last paragraph of my reviews of kids'
movies for the thoughts of my 8-year-old, his summary is too precious
to hold back.  Jeffrey said, "the show was funny, but not enough to
make me laugh."  He decided the jokes were aimed at the adults and that
was why he did not get them.  Well, speaking as adult, I laughed about
as often as Jeffrey, which was just about never.</P>
<P>     Both Pesci and Glover have tremendous talent, but they both share
a propensity for signing up to do hopelessly bad comedies.  The script
by Jill Mazursky and Jeffrey Abrams for GONE FISHIN' alternated between
recycled humor, heavy on sight gags (long demolition derbies being
particularly popular), and frequent dead time where laughs were not
even attempted.</P>
<P>     That this DOA flick was not screened to the critics comes as no
surprise.  Director Christopher Cain's last theatrical release was THE
AMAZING PANDA ADVENTURE, which wasn't.  The critics were not
appreciative of his talents then, and I suspect GONE FISHIN' will be
even less well received.</P>
<P>     As the film opens, Joe and Gus, played later by Pesci and Glover,
are two young kids fishing.  Joe is smoking a cigar which he tosses
behind him setting off a big fire that ends up shorting out the
electricity for an entire city.  This setting buildings on fire is a
nasty habit that they will keep all of their lives.</P>
<P>     The film quickly switches to grown Joe, wearing a "Fish Newark and
Die" T-shirt, and Gus heading south to the Florida Everglades for a big
fishing trip.  The trouble starts when Dekker Massey (Nick Brimble), a
con man so notorious that he has swindled 43 women and killed the last
one, steals their '68 Barracuda with their old fishing boat in tow.</P>
<P>     After the boat breaks off and crashes through a restaurant window,
our heroes start pushing the boat on the trailer down the highway.
Nothing will stop them.  Actually, the two stars give the impression of
two idiots playing two idiots.  Only because I've seen their better
pictures do I know otherwise.  An any rate, nothing of their characters
here merit seeing.</P>
<P>     Rita (Rosanna Arquette) and Angie (Lynn Whitfield) give Joe and
Gus a lift.  The women are looking for Dekker too and want to try to
pick the men's brains to find out what they know.  Now, there is a
hopeless job.</P>
<P>     Along the way, we suffer through one inanity after another.  For
example, we learn that Gus is such a solid sleepwalker after eating red
meat that he will dry his hair with an electric hair dryer, turn on the
gas on the fireplace, set his pillow on fire with a lighter, make a
phone call, and then walk quite a distance.  Glover's wooden
performance makes this long sleepwalking scene extremely tedious.</P>
<P>     Towards the end of the picture, their fishing idol, Billy "Catch"
Pooler (Willie Nelson), comes in almost as an apparition to rescue
them.  Catch fills them with inspiring quotations.  ("Don't forget.
The canary sings, but the eagle flies."  And that most instructive of
all, "Be the one you want to catch.")</P>
<P>     Dekker delivers the most accurate line in the movie.  "You
insignificant little man," Dekker barks at Joe after hearing enough of
his drivel.  "You've got a big mouth.  Now, shut it!"  I couldn't have
said it better myself.</P>
<P>     GONE FISHIN' runs 1:33.  It is rated PG for threatened violence.
The film would be acceptable for just about any age, but not worth
seeing by any.  Although my son claims he actually liked it, he laughed
very little.  Then again, he likes just about everything he sees.  I
was bored silly by the film so I do not recommend it.  A generous one
star from me.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
