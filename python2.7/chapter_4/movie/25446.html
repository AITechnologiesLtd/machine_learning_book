<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>When I went to see "The Sixth Sense" for the first time last year, I was
dismayed by how much of the first two-thirds of the film was spoiled by
the trailer. The movie was obviously constructed with the assumption that
the viewer was unaware Haley Joel Osment's character could see dead
people. Otherwise, the entire opening act constituted a thinly-veiled
exercise in misdirection, and I have more respect for the picture than
to believe that. In the end, although I was very much entertained "The
Sixth Sense", I was left wondering how much more enthralled I would have
been had so much not been revealed to me in the promotional material.</P>
<P>A year later, and wouldn't you know that history has repeated itself.
This time, the offending party is the preview for "What Lies Beneath", the
new thriller starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford, and directed by
Robert Zemeckis ("Back To The Future", "Forrest Gump"). As
poorly-conceived as the trailer for "The Sixth Sense" was, its "What Lies
Beneath" counterpart is infinitely more risible. In this day and age of
inspired, creative marketing strategies like the "Blair Witch Project"
website and the "X-Men" political campaign, it amazes me that we are
still forced to endure such hamfisted efforts as this one.</P>
<P>However, I refuse to review "What Lies Beneath" on the basis of its
trailer alone (although I am rather appalled that Zemeckis has actually
condoned it because, essentially, he doesn't think people will see his
movie without knowing the plot beforehand). It is true to say that my
enjoyment of the film was hampered because I had too much foreknowledge of
the events. But I will make every effort to set this aside, and review
"What Lies Beneath" on its own merits.</P>
<P>As the film opens, Norman Spencer (Ford) and his wife Claire (Pfeiffer)
are seeing their daughter off to college, leaving just the two of them
alone in their old lakeside Vermont cottage. Spencer is a genetics
professor who sometimes seems married more to his work than to his wife.
As a result, Claire is often left alone in the house. When neighbour
Warren Feur's wife Mary (Miranda Otto) goes missing after an argument,
strange things start happening. Doors open by themselves, electronics
misbehave, and Claire thinks she sees a face in the water. She becomes
convinced that Warren (James Remar) has murdered his wife, and that she is
now being haunted by Mary's ghost. Norman, however, thinks his wife is
going insane.</P>
<P>With "What Lies Beneath", Zemeckis is clearly trying to evoke Hitchcock. 
Most obviously, the entire subplot about the Feurs is a lift right out of
my own all-time favourite movie, "Rear Window", as Claire spies on the
neighbours through binoculars and finds disturbing but circumstantial
evidence of foul play. But here is one way the trailer helps to undermine
the picture (and if you haven't seen it, skip to the next paragraph now).
We know that the ghost isn't Mary Feur, so the entire sequence -- which
occupies most of the first half of the movie -- feels exactly like the
elaborate red herring that it is. As a result, I found myself impatiently
wanting the movie to just get on with it.</P>
<P>Zemeckis does successfully create a creepy atmosphere; there are plenty of
scares in "What Lies Beneath", and some of the effects (the face in the
water, a message in the condensation on a bathroom mirror) are understated
but work very well. The movie is cheapened, though, by the use of several
thriller cliches -- the sudden appearance of a family pet, the best friend
with coincidental occult inclinations, the killer who just won't die. Most
notably, Zemeckis badly overuses the device of having a character suddenly
appear in the frame. This was effective the first few times, but it got
rather silly when I lost track of the number of times it occurred.</P>
<P>Helping to foster the sinister atmosphere is a fine performance by
Pfeiffer, whose character is vulnerable and confused, but not weak. She
remains a captivating actor, able to communicate more with her eyes than
many performers can with their whole body. Pfeiffer is particularly good
in scenes where she becomes possessed by the ghost, seemlessly assuming
an persona without exaggerating the change.</P>
<P>Ford starts off weakly, mumbling his way through the early scenes, but 
finds his stride in the latter half. It is good to see the actor return to
roles with a bit of an edge to them, unlike the straight-laced,
do-no-wrong heroes he has portrayed for much of the past decade in films
like "Patriot Games" and "Air Force One". Ford was always at his best
playing characters with something of an anti-hero bent, like Han Solo or
"Blade Runner"'s Deckard, and to an extent, "What Lies Beneath" is
reminiscent of that.</P>
<P>"What Lies Beneath" rides a consistent upward curve, as the supernatural
events (or are they?) continue and Claire gets closer and closer to
uncovering the secret behind the apparitions. Things fall off the rails a
bit when the identity of the villain (which, I'll admit, came as a
surprise to me) is finally revealed and the film takes a plunge into
"Scream"-type slasher fare. Rather extreme measures are taken to demonise
the character (like a reference to the villain's attention focussing next
on Claire's daughter) which come across as more than a little
heavy-handed. But things end well with a spooky, beautifully photographed
climax which is carried out with just enough conviction to make it work.</P>
<P>Although it by no means achieves the heights of deep-rooted, psychological
terror as, say, "The Blair Witch Project", "What Lies Beneath" is very
successful on a more visceral level, and is certainly one of the scarier
movies of recent times. It's not the sort of film that will give you
nightmares -- the frights are too immediate and short-sighted for
that -- but it is a lot of fun all the same.</P>
<PRE>But oh, that trailer...</PRE>
