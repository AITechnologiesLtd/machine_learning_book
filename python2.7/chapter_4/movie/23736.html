<P>Been there, done that? Not on your life! "The Third Miracle" is, for 
my money, more original than other films of its genre, the genre 
being movies which deal with miracles and/or faith, whether of the 
blatant "The Exorcist" type, sentimental like "The Song of 
Bernadette," offbeat like Rossellini's "The Miracle," etc.</P>
<P>"TTM" is not remotely akin to any of the above, or any other film 
about religion. Outside all sub-genres it is, among other things, a 
sort of mystery tale (and a Mystery Play in the medieval sense), a 
detective story, an exploration of the self and of others.</P>
<P>I found it fascinating, beautifully made, and while complex on many 
levels, not confusing. It major focus is Father Frank Shore (Ed 
Harris) who, having undergone a crisis of faith, went to live as a 
layman in Chicago's lower depths, where a colleague from his diocese 
tracks him down</P>
<P>Recalled by his bishop,  Father Frank is given a demanding 
assignment. He is, in the Church's language, a "postulator," a priest 
whom a cardinal appoints to evaluate candidates for potential 
sainthood. Three confirmed miracles are a prerequisite. The 
postulator prepares what might be compared to a painstakingly minute 
legal dossier. This may eventually be submitted to the Church's upper 
echelons.  In turn, the judges may or may not forward the case to 
Rome.</P>
<P>This theological thriller has a solid thread in the person of Father 
Frank whom we follow through his steps and the arcane procedures of 
the Church. The putative saint was Helen O'Regan  (Barbara Sukowa) 
who had come to America from Central Europe after World War II. She 
is said, convincingly, to have cured a girl from lupus. The statue 
the girl prayed at is now been shedding tears and attracting masses 
of mostly working-class Polish-Americans from neighborhoods which 
look (in the director's words) like battlegrounds.</P>
<P>Frank's previous investigations has earned him the nickname of The 
Miracle Killer as he debunked one (or more? it is unclear) cases. 
This has affected him and added to his depression.</P>
<P>Now Frank is shaken up when he has the statue's tears examined 
scientifically, and they turn out to be genuine blood. He also meets 
Helen's daughter, the cynical and colorful Roxanna (Ann Heche). She 
is a non-believer who resents her late mother's having cared more for 
the masses than for Roxanna.</P>
<P>The character and personality of the young woman, her antagonism, 
then her  rapport with Father Frank; the trails the priest follows; 
the  types of people he encounters, his duel (so to speak) with a 
Church committee, are a weird kind of Odyssey. Some people may find 
the film meandering. Not I.  It held my attention at all times. I can 
only surmise that some Catholics could be entranced by matters they 
may know little about. But I also think  that non-Catholics as well 
as agnostics, atheists may find the proceedings exerting a strong 
pull.</P>
<P>A huge factor in all this is the magnificent performance by Ed 
Harris. A complex, complicated, changing man of -- metaphorically 
speaking -- many faces which are also one face, Harris delivers 
acting that is as good as any I have ever seen in what is a 
devilishly difficult and demanding role He is never ingratiating, but 
shows un-showy kindness to the lower classes, including drug addicts, 
peddlers, and prostitutes. His outspokenness with his fellow-priests 
as well as his superiors is not cockiness, but from the heart. He is 
smart, he is quick, he is flawed -- and he knows it. There's a basic, 
deep decency in this man. He has weaknesses, but also practices the 
ancient Greeks' rule of "know thyself."</P>
<P>The rest of the cast lends excellent support to Harris, whether by 
connection with him or by disconnection. The church people seem -- at 
least to viewers who do not have an inside track to them -- 
warts-and-all realistic and human in individual ways.</P>
<P>Are there major flaws in the movie? I think that this a matter that 
spectators will decide on an ad hoc basis. Some viewers may be upset 
by, or feel indignation at Father Frank's carnal lust (I won't 
elaborate). Others may be impressed by the priest's frankness.I 
thought that scenes of Frank's immersion in  wintry waters (as 
symbolic re-baptisms?) were over-the-top. On he whole, however, this 
is the sort of film that one cannot judge for others.</P>
<P>A possible irritation is the portrayal of Archbishop Werner, Frank's 
opponent during the deliberations. It is overdone, makes that prelate 
the heavy of the piece. He is played by the admirable Armin 
Mueller-Stahl who speaks very clear English, but is endowed here with 
the thickest Teutonic accent of his non-German career.</P>
<P>Director Agnieszka Holland presumably is not religious  but has her 
own fascination with the Catholic Church and the subject of miracles, 
which she has studied assiduously for this movie</P>
<P>Born in Warsaw, Poland, in 1948, Holland, the daughter of a Jewish 
father and a Catholic mother, studied cinema at the famous FAMU film 
school of Prague, worked much with, and learned much from Andrzej 
Wajda, the master filmmaker just honored at the Oscars 2000.</P>
<P>She became a prominent member of the Polish New Wave. Her bitter 
movies in Poland were often censored, at least one of them was 
forbidden during the long Russian occupation. In the mid-eighties she 
moved to Paris. Since then she has made "Bitter Harvest" starring Ed 
Harris, about the political killing of liberal, pro-Solidarity Father 
Popieluszko. Then came the multiple-awards winner "Europa, Europa" in 
which an Aryan-looking Jewish boy is drafted in the Nazi army. 
"Olivier, Olivier," "The Secret Garden,""Total Eclipse," and 
"Washington Square" followed.</P>
