<P>Has success spoiled Michael Moore?
The downsized-worker-turned-filmmaker from Flint seemed like a renegade
David taking on a corporate Goliath when he documented his thwarted quest to
meet General Motors chairman Roger Smith in the 1989 feature "Roger and Me."
Moore cheerfully filled the role of an Everyman speaking out for a
middle-class pounded by a recession President George Bush denied was going
on.</P>
<P>In the years since "Roger," however, Moore has starred in the "TV Nation"
series, directed the feeble feature "American Bacon" and written "Downsize
This: Random Threats From An Unarmed American," which hit the New York Times
best-seller list (as Moore¹s latest documentary "The Big One" takes great
pains to tell us).</P>
<P>In fact, "The Big One" centers around Moore¹s misadventures on a nationwide
tour to promote his book, so right off the bat we know his days as a
commoner are long-gone. Now he flies first-class (he tries to look
embarrassed by it), is chauffeured by perky "media liaisons" (they become
easy targets for his barbs) and gives speeches in auditoriums and bookstores
filled with fawning fans.</P>
<P>But despite his fame Moore is still on the lookout for greedy business
tycoons looking to make a few extra bucks by closing factories and cutting
jobs.</P>
<P>It turns out he has numerous offenders to choose from, including the owners
of the Payday candy-bar factory in Centralia, Ill., where management freely
admits they¹re shutting down because the workers made the plant too
profitable, thus endangering the company¹s pending sale.</P>
<P>His minor skirmishes with middle-management types leads up to what Moore
must have seen as the challenge of a lifetime: the opportunity to meet
face-to-face with unctuous Nike CEO Phil Knight who, Moore accuses, has
built his fortune off the sweat of teen-age Indonesian girls who make tennis
shoes in his overseas factories for 40 cents an hour. Americans, Knight
rationalizes, don¹t want to make shoes.</P>
<P>If there¹s a serious flaw to "The Big One" it lies in Moore¹s tendency to
mistake self-glamorization for credibility. Much more so than in "Roger and
Me," he¹s the star of the show here, and don¹t think he doesn¹t know it.
When Moore includes a snippet of White House press secretary Mike McCurry
calling him "a dangerous person," it¹s a bit obvious Moore sees this as a
badge of honor, and there¹s an excessive amount of footage devoted to Moore
cheerleading for a band of Borders Books and Music employees struggling to
unionize.</P>
<P>"The Big One" is unequivocally a sermon to the converted, but it¹s
frequently a bitterly funny one. When Moore probes the weird world of
corporate subsidies, investigating why the government has given Pillsbury
millions to promote their products in the Third World, the clips from a
commercial with a Spanish-speaking Pillsbury Doughboy are as hilarious as
they are creepy. Even material that¹s now slightly dated, such as Moore¹s
campaign-contribution stunt, is still giggle-worthy.</P>
