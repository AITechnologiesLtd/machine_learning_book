<PRE>STEAL THIS MOVIE
Reviewed by Jerry Saravia
March 5th, 2001</PRE>
<P>I do not know much about Abbie Hoffman or his Yippie days back in the 
counterculture era of the 1960's but I know they must have been far more 
troubling and chaotic than the simplistic treatment provided in this film. If 
it were not for two key performances by Vincent D'Onofrio and Janeane 
Garofalo, I would have dismissed "Steal this Movie" as a foolhardy and empty 
film biography. </P>
<P>D'Onofrio is Abbie Hoffman, the imaginative, creative political force of the 
60's who began as a civil rights activist in the South and worked his way 
into the anti-war movement, with particular attention paid to the Vietnam War 
and his staunch defense against it displayed in front of the Washington 
Monument. He made headlines for conjuring up absurd events such as the 
levitation of the Pentagon or his throwing dollar bills at New York Stock 
Exchange workers. It was performance theatre designed to provoke a response 
in the population about America's capitalist system. </P>
<P>None of this would mean much unless we saw the man behind the imagination. 
Hoffman robs a bus in ridiculous Western attire and meets Anita (Janeane 
Garofalo), who comes to his "Free Store" to get back her stolen jacket. She 
is intrigued and fascinated by him, and they eventually get married and have 
a son. However, J. Edgar Hoover and Richard Nixon are after Hoffman and 
invade his privacy with FBI surveillance. It gets so hot that Hoffman leaves 
his family and goes underground, finally giving an interview in the late 
1970's and exhibiting a bipolar disorder. He also meets and falls in love 
with Johanna Lawrenson (Jeanne Tripplehorn), and Anita eventually grows to 
accept the double life Abbie has lead. </P>
<P>"Steal This Movie" has a fragmented narrative and visual style, thanks to the 
tired cliche of the reporter interviewing the subject about his past 
victories and losses. This cliche began with "Citizen Kane" and has been used 
in everything from "Lenny" to "Chaplin" and beyond. It may allow for some 
experimentation with narrative but it can also give the idea that we are 
merely watching glimpses of the biographical subject without getting too 
close. That is what happens with "Steal This Movie," which glides from one 
event to the other giving it a disconnected flow - it is like watching a 
"Biography" segment complete with badly used, pseudo voice-overs from Nixon 
and Hoover.  </P>
<P>D'Onofrio is a revelation as he gives a beautifully modulated performance of 
extreme highs and lows, showcasing Hoffman's improvisational delivery in 
nearly everything he does yet also showing a man living in paranoia and fear 
about his family, friends and foes and his insular life. Janeane Garofalo 
also gets a chance to develop an empathetic and compassionate side to Anita, 
who also has her doubts about Hoffman's other lover and his insularity yet 
she deeply loves him. </P>
<P>"Steal This Movie" is nothing extraordinary and the film limits Hoffman's 
struggle and paranoia to that of a mere outcast, a shadow of the man who made 
people listen to his view on the world. Still, the 60's scene is thrillingly 
depicted (complete with typical tunes in the soundtrack) and there are shades 
throughout of Oliver Stone's "Born on the Fourth of July" in its view of how 
of the young revolutionaries were not always taken seriously by the 
conservatives. The only difference is that everyone paid attention to Abbie 
Hoffman. </P>
