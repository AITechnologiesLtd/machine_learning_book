<PRE>"Captain Corelli's Mandolin"</PRE>
<P>The beautiful Greek Island of Cephallonia was a peaceful jewel in the
Ionian Sea until 1941 when the war ravaging Europe landed on its shores.
Italian troops are sent to garrison the island and Captain Antonio Corelli
(Nicolas Cage), a conscript sent to the foreign land, falls in love with a
lovely local girl, Pelagia (Penelope Cruz), in "Captain Corelli's
Mandolin."</P>
<P>Months ago, we received the first of the video press material for "Captain
Corelli's Mandolin." Watching the trailer tape way back then, I was
reluctant about the movie. It looked like a smarmy romance, the kind that
really doesn't hold a lot of appeal for me. The press stuff kept trickling
in and a sense of mild dread took over as the film's release date drew
near. Finally, word came announcing the advanced screening, so I bit the
bullet (after all, it does have Penelope Cruz) and went to see what I
expected to be nothing more than a chick flick. Boy, was I wrong.</P>
<P>John Madden ("Shakespeare in Love") brings the popular Louis de Bernieres
novel, Captain Corelli's Mandolin, to the big screen in a lush, beautifully
crafted movie that turns out to be more than just a love story. Captain
Corelli, an unwilling draftee into Mussolini's invading army, loves life
and the music he plays on his mandolin. When he is stationed, with his
artillery battery, on Cephallonia, he sees beautiful Pelagia amidst the
island's citizens and is immediately smitten. When Antonio is billeted in
the house owned by her father, Dr. Iannis (John Hurt), her resentment of
the invaders is softened and the Italian officer works his way into the
young woman's heart. A deep, mutual love is born.</P>
<P>The horrors of the war have left the small Greek island unmolested and
Italy's powerful ally, Nazi Germany, has left the Balkan country to the
Italians to rule. But, in 1943, when Mussolini falls from power, his German
masters take a hand in the occupation of Greece. When Italy surrenders to
the Allies, the Nazis demand the surrender of arms by all of the Italian
forces. Rumors fly about Italian troops being imprisoned by the Germans and
the soldiers occupying Cephallonia decide to resist their now-former
allies. Battalions of crack German mountain troops are sent to quell the
mutineers and the out-numbered and out-gunned Italians pay the deadly
consequences.</P>
<P>The focus, as you would expect in a romance-based story, is on the two lead
characters. Antonio and Pelagia make a handsome couple and some sparks fly
in their romantic scenes, but, overall, Cage and Cruz don't quite have the
chemistry to make this an epic love story. The pair is nice but the screen
doesn't burn up when they're together. This could have been a disaster for
the movie, but the quality of the production, a strong supporting cast, the
gorgeous locale, the outstanding tech values and exciting battle scenes,
plus the depiction of a little know slice of history all contribute in
making this a solid all-around film.</P>
<P>John Hurt, a truly great actor, gives depth to his character, Dr. Iannis,
the island's physician. The doctor is an enlightened individual, shunning
the Greek Orthodox religion of the islanders, but dedicated to the people
of Cephallonia and, in particular, his daughter, Pelagia. Film icon Irene
Papas appears as the mother of Mandras (Christian Bale), an illiterate
Greek fisherman who had the heart of Pelagia until Antonio Corelli's
arrival. With just a look the veteran actress tells volumes of the hopes
and fears for her son. The actors making up Corelli's artillery battery,
called La Scalas for their propensity to break into the songs of Puccini
and other great Italian composers, provide a musical cameo perf that gives
a human face to the occupiers.</P>
<P>John Toll's cinematography is, in a word, stunning. The pallet of colors
that his cameras pick up give a lushness that complements the island
locales. The look of the film is so inviting it makes you want to spend
your days drinking in the beauty of Cephallonia. Other techs are on a par
with Toll's exquisite lensing. Jim Clay and his production design team had
the daunting task of creating the film's Greek island village virtually
from scratch. An earthquake devastated the island in 1953, leaving little
of the old-fashioned structures needed for the film. The recreation of the
capital city of Argostoli is nothing less than remarkable. Costume designer
Alexandra Byrne expertly fits the period, clothing the Italian and German
troops in real looking uniforms and the islanders in homespun attire. The
battle sequences between the Italians and Germans are deftly staged and
wrenchingly realistic looking.</P>
<P>The history depicted in "Captain Corelli's Mandolin" covers territory
virtually unknown. The only other film that deals with the Italian
occupation of Greece and its islands was the charming Best Foreign Film
winner several years ago, "Mediterraneo," but that comedic viewpoint did
not get down to the nitty gritty of the war itself. If only the romantic
center of "Corelli" had equaled the exquisite production. I give it a B.</P>
