<P>    "A burnt child loves the fire," Oscar Wilde was once quoted as saying,
and these six words aptly describe his own fatal attraction to the
capricious young aristocrat Lord Alfred "Bosie" Douglas. It was a
relationship that would ultimately destroy Wilde's career, his family and
his health, and yet after all the damage was done, Wilde still sought
shelter in Douglas' arms.</P>
<P>What was the appeal? According to "Wilde," adapted by Julian Mitchell
from Richard Ellman's biography "Oscar Wilde," it seems to have been a
combination of sheer romanticism and all-consuming masochism. As portrayed
by the gifted Jude Law (Broadway's "Indiscretions," "Gattaca"), Douglas is
almost painfully handsome and often charming. But he's also very much an
overgrown rebellious adolescent, prone to temper tantrums and blistering
verbal attacks on Wilde, whom Douglas seems to regard as both unworthy of
him and also as the perfect weapon to use in his fight against his mad
father, the Marquess of Queensberry (Tom Wilkinson).</P>
<P>By the time he met Douglas, Wilde (Stephen Fry) was already married, a
father and a bright light in the London theater scene, thanks to the success
of "Lady Windemere's Fan." He was also already regarded by polite society as
a shady character because of his "dangerous" novel "The Picture of Dorian
Gray." "Artists care nothing about respectability," Wilde's mother (Vanessa
Redgrave) assures his wife Constance (Jennifer Ehle), who frets about
Oscar's reputation.</P>
<P>In his lavish telling of a tragic story, director Brian Gilbert holds
back very little. "Wilde" does not shy away from showing either Wilde and
Douglas carousing in all-male brothels ("I do love you, Oscar, but variety
is the spice of life," Douglas huffs as he leads Wilde in) or Wilde's
voyeuristic habits.</P>
<P>The film also makes no attempt to conceal the walking paradox that was
Wilde himself. Wilde's story "The Selfish Giant" becomes a recurring motif
in the scenes showing Wilde's family life: Although he could write a lovely
fable about the virtues of being generous, Wilde is depicted as a father too
absorbed in his work and love affairs to pay much attention to his sons.</P>
<P>Even more pointedly, although the Irish-born author insists "all my
life I've fought against the English vice, hypocrisy," Wilde refused to
publicly admit his homosexuality, even going so far as to sue for libel
after the Marquess wrote a note alleging he was a "sodomite." The lawsuit --
prompted, of course, by Douglas' hatred of his father -- would ultimately
disgrace Wilde and everyone around him.</P>
<P>Fry brings the vulnerable soul beneath Wilde's scathing wit to the
surface, making it clear that even though Wilde realized his relationship
with Douglas was futile ("you're my catstrophe, my doom," he murmurs to
Douglas between kisses) he was powerless to resist. Fry also captures
Wilde's poise and imposing physical presence: He truly was the Selfish
Giant, not the paunchy little man he's often portrayed as. Law, quickly
becoming an actor to watch, has the necessary allure and off-putting
petulance the character of Douglas requires, and Wilkinson is suitably
frenzied as his bloodthirsty dad.
