<P>
Peter Greenaway is the supreme film stylist of the 20th century. He creates
tales, not stories in the conventional narrative sense, of our erotic desires
and murderous impulses within the context of literature and art history. He
said recently that films are more concerned with pop culture than with art. I
couldn't agree more with the current schlock in cinemas nowadays. Arguably, his
most profound work was the controversial "The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her
Lover," a savagely funny tale of revenge and sex in a decadent restaurant. It
was not for all tastes, but then who says art is? "The Pillow Book" is his
latest film, and it is enticing, sexy and alluring though Greenaway often shies
away from his basic premise. </P>
<P>"The Pillow Book" stars Vivian Wu as Nagiko, a flamboyant fashion model who is
obsessed with calligraphy. Her first husband had no interest in her obsession
and, as a result, their house was burnt down. Several years later, she develops
a certain sexual obsession: she wants to find the perfect lover who can also
paint calligraphy all over her body. Her obsession emanates from her childhood
when her father painted words on her face. Her latest lover is a bisexual
translator, Jerome (Ewan McGregor from "Trainspotting"), and she insists that
he write all over her body. If man can make perfect love to her, then he also
must be able to write perfect letters.</P>
<P>Peter Greenaway's gift as a director is his visual flamboyance - an ability to
layer several images together to convey the erotic feeling of where mind and
body integrate. He beautifully executes scenes of passion from the lovingly
choreographed close-up shots of men painting on Nagiko's skin to lighting
effects of Chinese symbols flashing and dissolving on the walls - the effect is
grandiose yet thrilling. The technique of rectangular frames subdividing the
screen and changing from black-and-white to color is marvelous to behold - this
style of editing originated in Greenaway's "Prospero's Books." No other
director can match the love and care that he puts into every shot of his films
(except for Scorsese and Lynch). In the end, though, it is really more about
Greenaway's own obsession of literature and art than it is about Nagiko's
personal odyssey. </P>
<P>"The Pillow Book" becomes somewhat melodramatic in the last half when it
erroneously stays away from the character of Nagiko. Greenaway (who wrote the
film) devises a revenge plot involving Nagiko's father's employer - a
homosexual whom Nagiko feels had destroyed her family. After Jerome begins to
get involved with this character, a spooky and, literally, revealing thing
happens to Jerome's skin. But instead of focusing on Nagiko's obsessive
behavior, the movie opts for elements that negate the first half of the film -
the sexual connection of flesh and writing. The revenge plot is typical of
Greenaway but here, he loses the themes he explored beforehand and so the film
becomes distracting and laborious. There are several scenes of naked bodies
covered in writing confronting the evil homosexual, but they become repetitious
and meaningless. However, when Nagiko plans to keep her lover, the idea of
flesh and text is restored. </P>
<P>"The Pillow Book" is better seen than described. It is purely a filmic
exercise in exploring themes rather than placing them in a narrative structure
or plot. Greenaway should be commended for trying to push the boundaries of
film structure in an age of homogenized hogwash. Nagiko is wonderfully
performed with genuine emotion by the sensual actress Vivian Wu (her lovemaking
sessions with Jerome are truly sexy). If only Greenaway chose a more internal
frame of mind when exploring Nagiko instead of coldly pulling her out towards
the end. "The Pillow Book" is a masterpiece of filmmaking but it is not as
intricate or as intimate as Greenaway's other works. </P>
