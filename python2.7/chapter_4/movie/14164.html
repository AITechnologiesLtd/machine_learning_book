<PRE>DANCE WITH ME
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>In Dance With Me, you get just what you expect.  A dance film, with a
little romance thrown in to spice things up, and not much more.
However, the sizzling dances make up for what the plot lacks in
imagination.</P>
<P>After the death of his mother, Rafael Infante (Chayanne) decides to
journey from Cuba to Texas.  An old friend of his mother, John Burnette
(Kris Kristofferson), owns a dance studio there, and is willing to give
him a job and a place to stay.</P>
<P>Working as a handyman at the studio, Rafael meets Ruby (Vanessa L.
Williams), an instructor and professional dancer (specializing in the
Latin dances). She's split from her former partner/boyfriend Julian
(Rick Valenzuela), and is now struggling to climb back to the top.</P>
<P>As the deadline to the National Finals looms closer, hints of romance
begin to bloom between Rafael and Ruby.  But she's got no time or use
for love, and Rafael struggles to prove differently...</P>
<P>As a dance film, Dance With Me falls into a predictable pattern visited
before in such films as Strictly Ballroom, and Shall We Dance?. There
are few surprises here.</P>
<P>But, there is dancing.  And most of it is quite good.  Vanessa Williams
gets a chance to show her moves, and she's got plenty.  Chayanne is no
slouch here, but it is clear that Williams is the star.</P>
<P>The emerging romance between Rafael and Ruby isn't handled poorly, but
it's far from the high point in the film.  Part of the problem is that
the interaction of the couple can't quite compete with the passion of
the dancing...so the romance gets left in the cold.</P>
<P>The subplots in Dance With Me vary in quality.  Rafael's search for his
father is a little predictable, and mostly diverting from the rest of
the film.  However, the antics of the studio's various dance students
(including an unlikely Joan Plowright) are slightly amusing.</P>
<P>On the whole, Dance With Me is enjoyable simply for its dancing scenes.
The surrounding clutter neither enhances nor detracts from the simple
pleasures of the movie.</P>
