<PRE>Good Will Hunting
Rating: ***1/2 (out of four)
R, 1997
Directed by Gus Van Sant. Written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.
Starring Matt Damon, Robin Williams, Ben Affleck. </PRE>
<P>I must admit that I was a tad skeptical of "Good Will Hunting", based both on
the previews and the first fifteen minutes of the film, in which the main
character Will Hunting (Matt Damon), an MIT janitor in his early twenties, is
discovered to be an Einstein-level closet genius when he solves two
extraordinarily difficult math problems overnight. The only problem is that
Will is a tough street kid who's had his share of run-ins with the law, and
before long he's being hauled in for assault after a parking lot fight.
Professor Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard), who had brought up the math problems in
his lectures, tracks him down and strikes a deal with the police: Will is to
be released, provided he works with Lambeau on his math research regularly and
attends therapy sessions. </P>
<P>This sounds like the formula for mildly charming fluff, but "Good Will
Hunting" rises above its fairly mundane premise to deliver a poignant and
clever drama. A conflict gradually emerges between Lambeau and Will's
therapist Sean McGuire (Robin Williams) - Lambeau wants to get Will to use his
brain, while Sean wants him to listen to his heart, both of which he has been
largely neglecting. Will finds that the former is much easier than the latter,
so much so, in fact, that he gets bored with it and grows increasingly
resistant to Lambeau's attempts to recruit him into the academic lifestyle. He
also has his share of problems with his girlfriend Skylar (Minnie Driver), an
MIT student who is moving to California at the end of the school year and
would like a reluctant Will to come with her. </P>
<P>What makes "Good Will Hunting" work so well, aside from the strong
performances (especially from Damon and Williams), is the depth of
characterization and the representation of the conflicts in Will's life. The
script's sympathies seem to lie more with Sean McGuire than with Lambeau, but
neither of them is presented as completely right or wrong. Lambeau, while he
may seem a little cold at times, is still written well enough that we like him
as a character even when we're not sure if we like what he has to say. And
Sean, for all his warm-heartedness, has, as Lambeau and later Will point out,
not lived up to his full intellectual potential either; the therapy sessions
turn out to be just as revelatory for Sean as they do for Will. </P>
<P>Will's reaction to this situation, and the way in which he slowly becomes more
receptive to Skylar and to Sean, is presented in a believable fashion and in a
way that forces the audience to consider all the characters' opinions, rather
than setting up an obvious "right" and "wrong" side and beating them over the
head with it. For a film with such an extraordinary character, "Good Will
Hunting" presents itself as remarkably ordinary; it achieves the difficult
task of making the next Albert Einstein into an Everyman, a character to whom
the audience can easily relate and who must make choices similar to those that
almost everyone faces at one time or another. This film gives us real drama
when it so easily could have given us merely melodrama, by having the
government kidnap Will to use him in covert spy missions or introducing some
other equally far-fetched situation. </P>
<P>"Good Will Hunting" also has its share of fun humor, such as when Will, in an
early therapy session, pretends to be hypnotized and smoothly parodies the
alien abduction scenarios that have become so well known in popular culture.
And in the one scene in which government agents do in fact appear, Will blows
them off with a hilariously scathing accusation of human rights violations in
Africa. Will's relationship with his friends, most notably Chucky (Ben
Affleck), is usually rather amusing, if somewhat crude (the film has 100+ uses
of the 'f' word, which was most likely the reason for its R-rating), and lends
itself well to the development of Will's character. </P>
<P>Add all this to the fact that "Good Will Hunting" even manages to pull off an
uplifting happy ending without getting excessively sentimental, and you might
be wondering why I haven't given this film four stars. Well, for one thing, no
matter how well Damon and Affleck, who wrote the screenplay, and director Gus
Van Sant pull it off, the story is still rather contrived and not particularly
original. There are also a few scenes that did feel a bit formulaic, including
one that was supposed to be emotional but really just seemed like the
Obligatory Crying Scene for any movie involving therapy sessions. Still, "Good
Will Hunting" takes its premise a lot farther than I thought it would, and is
definitely one of the better personal dramas I have seen in the last few
years, and as of right now it stands as one of the top five on my list of '97
films. </P>
