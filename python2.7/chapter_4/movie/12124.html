<PRE>JACKIE BROWN
**** of **** grade is A</PRE>
<P>Jackie Brown is not the film you'd expect from the phenom director
Quentin Tarantion.  In Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs he used an
offbeat amount of quirky dialogue spiced with suprising, comic shots of
violence.  Jackie Brown tells us that Mr. Tarantino is the real deal,
making one of the most grown up crime movies I've seen.</P>
<P>In Jackie Brown, based on novel Rum Punch by the wondeful Elmore
Leonard, the title character must outsmart a drug/gun dealer in Sam
Jackson and find time to fall in love with Max Cherry (played by Robert
Forster, WHO SHOULD HAVE WON THE BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR AWARD).  These
scenes are handled with Tarantino's trademark great dialogue and humor. 
The film is also decisivly less violent than his previous and much more
human.</P>
<P>There are two common complaints about this film.  One of them is Sam
Jackson's character Ordell Robbi's use of the word "nigger."  I want to
strain that this is Ordell Robbi saying this and NOT Tarantino or
Jackson.  Spike Lee has spoken out about this very point asking weither
Quentin wanted to be made "an honorary black man."  This is absurd, are
white people not aloud to write black characters? Are white writers not
aloud to have their characters saying offensive material?  Are there not
people who talk the way Robbi does?  Spike you made Get on the Bus, a
movie I appreciated, and the black Lexus dealer uses the word
prevasively throughout his FEW MINUTES of screen time.</P>
<P>The other complaint about the film was the length.  It runs long but was
not at all boring and much better writen that Titanic.  This film also
has many strong performances from Sam Jackson, cute Bridget Fonda, funny
Robert DeNiro, and two great performances from Robert Forster and Pam
Grier.  </P>
<P>On a side note I am very happy to see Pam Grier back in good films.  She
had quite a career in the seventies blaxploitation films.  She was
notable as the one that got naked and showed off her impressive bossom,
and for her charasmatic acting.  Her body left such an impression I
remember one critic of this film complaining that we didn't even see her
shoulders.  She gives a great performance here and in films like Coffy
and Foxy Brown, lower scale but still very entertaining.</P>
