<P> As subjects for family entertainment spectaculars go, the legend of
Anastasia is neither as odd a choice as Victor Hugo's "Hunchback of Notre
Dame" nor as conventional as "Cinderella," although the animated musical
"Anastasia" somehow manages to incorporate elements of both into the curious
tapestry it weaves.</P>
<P>It also ties in such old reliables as an adorable animal companion, a regal
and loving grandmother and three different balls for our heroine to waltz
through.</P>
<P>Opulence abounds in "Anastasia," thanks to the efforts of animators Don
Bluth and Gary Goldman ("An American Tail," "The Land Before Time"), but the
visual elegance can't fully camouflage a clumsy story built around the
conceit that the Russian Revolution was motivated not by the uprising of the
proletariat, but by the conjuring of the sorcerer Rasputin.</P>
<P>In "Anastasia," Rasputin "The Mad Monk" is transformed into a decomposing
resident of Hades, with a batch of winged green demons to do his dirty work.
At the top of his list is placing a curse on Russia's ruling Romanov family,
all of whom "disappear" - the movie's genteel explanation - except the
Empress Dowager and her granddaughter Anastasia, who are separated in their
flight fromthe palace.</P>
<P>Ten years later, rumors circulate that Anastasia has somehow survived and
that the Empress Dowager will pay 10 million rubles to whoever can bring the
missing heiress to Paris.</P>
<P>Enter Anya, a teen-age amnesiac who's en route from an orphanage to a job in
a fish factory when she takes a detour to St. Petersburg instead and meets
up with con artists Dimitri and Vlad, who see in the spunky young woman a
potential fortune.But when word of Anastasia resurfacing hits the
underworld, Rasputin vows to pull himself together - literally - and to do
away with the last of the Romanovs.</P>
<P>If "Anastasia" offers little in the way of valid historical background or
genuine charm, it does include some breathtakingly sophisticated animation,
particularly a terrific train crash and a gorgeous moment in which Anya
envisions the now-shuttered ballroom of the palace in its glory days, with
phantom dancers encircling her.</P>
<P>"Anastasia" also stands, along with "Sleeping Beauty," as one of the few
cartoons to be shot in cinemascope, which gives the animators a spacious
canvas on which to work their magic - sometimes too spacious, as many of the
backgrounds have a rushed, sketchy look.</P>
<P>The songs by Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens ("Once On This Island") are
generally pleasant, althoughdeleting the overlong tribute to the splendors
of Paris (featuring Gertrude Stein, Josephine Baker and Maurice Chevalier
caricatures that should baffle the matinee crowd) would have helped the
film's pace.</P>
<P>As the speaking voices of Anastasia and Dimitri, Meg Ryan and John Cusack
make no attempt to sound anything but American, leaving Angela Lansbury to
steal the show with her splendid reading of the Empress Dowager.</P>
<P>There's much to admire in "Anastasia," although it's hard to embrace a film
that seems more interested in beating Disney in the animated musical
sweepstakes. Unfortunately, in the company of such cinematic royalty as "The
Little Mermaid," "Pocahontas" and "The Lion King," "Anastasia," like the
real-life woman who inspired it, seems like a pretender rather than a
contender.</P>
