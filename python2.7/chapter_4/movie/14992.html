                                PLEASANTVILLE
                         A movie review by Joe Barlow
                             (c) Copyright 1998</PRE>

<PRE>                   RATING: **** (out of a possible *****)</PRE>
<P>        "Don't judge a book by its cover" has long been the
motto of enlightened readers, who recognize that the story
contained within the pages of a novel often bears no
resemblance to the illustration on the front.  I'd like to
take this concept a step further and propose a new maxim for
moviegoers: "Don't judge a film by its trailer."</P>
<P>        Movie trailers (the "previews" which run before the
main feature) have been used to promote upcoming films for
almost as long as movies have been around.  Their job is a
simple one: entice the audience back to the theater at a
future date, just as a book cover's job is to get you to buy
the novel you're leafing through.  But beware: like all forms
of advertising, trailers often stretch the truth a bit.
"Chasing Amy," a thought-provoking comedy/drama from director
Kevin Smith, was depicted as a happy-go-lucky "bimbo" movie by
Miramax's ads.  And if I didn't see new movies as a matter of
course, I would have skipped "Dance with Me," a warm, rich
drama full of life and energy, because the trailer painted the
film as two hours of Vanessa Williams shaking her tushie while
Kris Kristofferson stood around, looking confused.  The
trailers for "The Truman Show" and "Ransom" are equally bad...
though the ads for "Pleasantville" aren't far behind in terms of
quality.  (Joe's trivia question for the day: why are movie
ads called "trailers" when they run BEFORE the movie?  Answer
given at the end of this review.)</P>
<P>        As anyone who's seen the trailer can tell you,
"Pleasantville" revolves around two modern teenagers, David
(Tobey Maguire) and Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon), who are
magically transported into the fictional world of David's
favorite television show, a Mayberry-esque community called
Pleasantville.  The year is 1958, the weather is always
perfect, the universe (including David and Jennifer) is in
black and white, Perry Como rules the airwaves, and dinner
is always on the table when "Dad" (William H. Macy) gets home
from work.  David is delighted to be living in a simpler
time, but wild-child Jennifer is aghast at the lack of sex,
cigarettes and MTV... and decides to impart some of her
worldly knowledge to the citizens of the town.</P>
<P>        Jennifer's actions have unforeseen ramifications,
however: as she (and David, to a lesser extent) encourage the
other citizens of the town to change and evolve, the former
idyllic paradise of Pleasantville is rocked to its foundation.
The basketball team no longer wins every game.  "Mom" suddenly
doesn't feel like making dinner for "Dad" every night.  Teenagers
discover other things to do in the bushes besides hold hands.
Rock and roll (gasp!) becomes the music of choice.  And, for the
first time ever, REAL COLOR begins to appear in the town...
sporadically at first, but with increasing frequency, sending
mayor Bob (the wonderful J.T. Walsh, who died during the making
of the film) into a deep panic.</P>
<P>        The trailer gives the impression that the movie is a
screwball comedy, but make no mistake: "Pleasantville" is a
drama, and a damn fine one at that.  Sure, there are several
funny moments: the Pleasantville Fire Department are experts at
getting cats out of trees, but seem woefully unequipped to deal
with an actual fire.  "Mom" likes to make sure her kids start
the day off with a REALLY BIG breakfast.  And the scene in
which Jennifer explains sex and the concept of masturbation to
her ultra-straight "mother" is worth at least two-thirds of the
ticket price by itself.  But writer/director Gary Ross (the man
who brought you "Big") also devotes a significant amount of the
film's two-hour running time to more serious issues like racism,
the loss of innocence, and finding the courage to follow your
dreams despite what others think.  None of these issues are
particularly original, but the movie handles them so uniquely
that they feel like a breath of fresh air.  There are no guns,
no car chases, no nudity... just a solid, entertaining story
which flawlessly captures the feel of shows like "Andy Griffith"
and "Leave it to Beaver," feeling like fifty-percent homage
and fifty-percent satire (look for an amusing cameo by Andy
Griffith's sidekick, Don "Barney Fife" Knotts).  We also get
plenty of great "fish out of water" comedy; in many ways,
"Pleasantville" reminded me of a slightly more cerebral "Back
to the Future."  But the overall tone of the story is quite
serious, and there's a good deal of both sadness and personal
triumph contained in the movie.</P>
<P>        I had pegged "What Dreams May Come" as a shoo-in for
"Best Special Effects" or "Best Technical Innovation," but now
I'm not so sure.  "Pleasantville" is a visual marvel, seamlessly
integrating color and black and white into the same shots for
much of the film's duration.  You have to see it to believe it,
particularly the scene in which David and his gal-pal take a
drive in the country.  One of the nicest things about the movie's
colors is that they all have a faded, neon-esque quality to them,
akin to what you might find in a 1950s film.  It's a perfect
(and subtle) note of nostalgia.</P>
<P>        This is the second movie this year (after "What Dreams
May Come") to completely astonish me.  Beautifully photographed,
cleverly written, and always fascinating, "Pleasantville" should
not be missed by anyone.  Its ambiguous ending leaves a number
of major questions unanswered (What was Don Knotts's character
REALLY up to?  How does Jennifer cope with the situation she
finds herself in at the conclusion of the story?), but rather
than being a detriment, I actually found that these unresolved
issues gave me a lot of food for thought after the end credits
began to roll... and that's something that all too few films do
these days.</P>
<P>        (Answer to the trivia question: in the '40s and '50s,
advertisements for upcoming movies were typically shown AFTER
the feature film, hence the term "trailer."  The end credits
for movies are much longer now than they were then, and most
people leave before the credits are finished; as such, the
ads are now shown before the main feature, although the term
"trailer" is still used.)</P>
