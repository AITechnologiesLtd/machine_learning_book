<P>The English language consists of hundreds of thousands of words, one for almost
anything that occurs or could occur in life.  Detroit Rock City can best be
summed up by one, simple word- energy.  At least that word is more positive
than my expectations going into this 70's teen film- I expected the words that
would sum the film up to be "horrible" and "cliche."  Being released the same
weekend as a smart, innovative teen film, "Brokedown Palace", Detroit Rock City
couldn't come at a better time, as many teens prefer "energy" over "quality,"
which will in turn boost Detroit Rock City's box office gross.  Along with
"Dick", a clever spoof on Watergate, "Brokedown Palace" was the second smart
teen film of the summer, but the streak ends here with Detroit Rock City. 
Unlike "Dick" and "Brokedown Palace," Detroit Rock City isn't about anything.  </P>
<P>Four pothead kids, Hawk (Edward Furlong), Jam (Sam Huntington), Trip (James
DeBello), and Lex (Giuseppe Andrews) are our protagonists of sorts, who instead
of party to the then popular disco beats and bright clothing, jam to a
different beat, the beat of Kiss.  For the past three years, the foursome have
been attempting to scam their way into the annual Detroit, Michigan Kiss
concert, but have been unsuccessful- What will this year bring?  Will they make
it to their idol's concert this year, or will they be stopped by misfortune and
strict parents?</P>
<P>Some plot, eh?  Luckily, the weak screenplay (written by first timer Carl V.
Dupre) is brought to life by director Adam Rifkin, who presents Detroit Rock
City with so much energy, there's not a dull moment in the film.  Rifkin, whose
oddball camera angles and fast pace make Detroit Rock City interesting and fun
to watch, keep you involved with the film, until you realize that apart from
the slick direction, a few credible performances, and a few choice gags,
Detroit Rock City is as lost as the main characters are.</P>
<P>As the ultra religious mother of Jam, Lin Shaye's performance steals the show,
as she despises Kiss- with a passion.  According to her, the name stands for
"Knights In Satan's Service", and their music shouldn't be listened to by a
single soul.  Whenever Detroit Rock City's high energy level is down, Lin Shaye
rescues the film from dragging.</P>
<P>Our four main characters are all performed with strong energy and pizzaz from
the actors, but then again, it doesn't take much to walk around and scream. 
The only standout performance is from Sam Huntington, who is given more to do
from the screenplay than act wild and crazy.</P>
<P>The screenplay features no twists or turns, only one character with
development, and an ending that could have been seen just by hearing Detroit
Rock City's plot.  The climax of the film is awfully quiet, and isn't as
exciting as the rest of the film.  The definition of climax is- The height of
the film, or the turning point, which leads to the falling action- Not a
predictable, short snippet of film which isn't followed by anything except the
end credits.  Carl V. Dupre- Don't count on your screenplay career to take off
anytime soon.</P>
<P>Back to the word "energy."  Detroit Rock City's strong soundtrack doesn't
feature your stereotype 70's tunes, but instead includes a Kiss dominated
soundtrack, and believe me- It's LOUD.  Not even Star Wars Episode 1: The
Phantom Menace could win against Detroit Rock City in a loudness contest.  The
constant musical energy helps the film take off, but by the time this 95 minute
film's credits roll, you should have a pounding headache.</P>
<P>Although most of Detroit Rock City is loud and obnoxious, a few choice,
hilarious moments sneak in, which burst with originality, but seem out of place
in such a mediocre film.  The strong energy level makes Detroit Rock City worth
seeing at the dollar theaters, but non-Kiss fans could find themselves covering
their ears, and eagerly awaiting the moment when Detroit Rock City ends.  If
you are looking for a good rock and roll movie, and not a Kiss fan, like
myself, then check out 1996's That Thing You Do!, a much more fun, likable
motion picture.  Detroit Rock City is a variation on the average teen movie,
but I rather be watching "She's All That"s and "Varsity Blues"s than films like
this one.</P>
<P>The Bottom Line- Detroit Rock City will only "rock" a select few audience's
worlds, but the high energy level, and clever direction keep the film flowing.</P>
