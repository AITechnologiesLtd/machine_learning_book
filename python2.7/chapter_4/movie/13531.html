<PRE>FILM TITLE:                DREAMS
DIRECTOR:               AKIRA KUROSAWA
COUNTRY:                JAPAN 1990

SUPER FEATURES:         Kurosawa's Short Stories, if you will.</PRE>
<PRE>      !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<P>Akira Kurosawa, has been accused of being a rat, because he will not do a
film for the greedy Japanese studios who want him to make them millions of
yen.  Instead, Akira goes around the world to find funding for whatever work
he has finished writing, and gets it done with very little fuss, and with a
lot of international good will, for his trully
beautiful and colorful work.</P>
<P>And while this type of work may not be indicative of the trend of  Japanese
money making films, it is a love offering for the world of film enthusiasts
which Akira Kurosawa has gained over fifty years of film making.  His work
is staunchly personal, and totally against the 'public' faire, which
Hollywood prefers, as does Tokyo.  In the  process, he makes use of his best
friends around the world, who always produce his work, and make sure it gets
released, despite the man being blacklisted in his own country as a renegade
director.  At least he knows he will be remenbered and revered as an artist,
something that the money makers never will get.  What they get in money,
Akira will
get in years of being remenbered as a stupendous film maker, who deserves
it.</P>
<P>DREAMS is a personal set of short stories on film.  And while they are
unusual, they still stand out.  The three best stories ( gosh I don't even
remenber if there were more in the film ) were the first one which dealt
with a child who sees the spirit of the peach trees ( the deva is the
accurate description ) tell him  that he should keep these trees alive
forever, instead of cutting them down for a development, which seems to be
the obvious outcome as Japan grows and prospers into the industrial world.
The hint is
that all the beauty of these visions will disappear.  An odd piece, in that
things tend to appear and disappear in a dance ritual that is dazzling, and
hipnotic at the same time.</P>
<P>The second one has to do with another young man, who is ready for war, in
his military outfit.  They all march into a tunnel, and on the other end of
the tunnel, only the young man shows up, the rest presumably all dead.  It
is a beautiful metaphor about how
war treats people.  The young man is scared, and immediatelly  lonesome, and
having to deal with his own perceptions and emotions.</P>
<P>Another story is about Van Gogh, and how he worked, played by the director
Martin Scorcese ( a special friend to Akira ), a tribute not so much to the
artist, but to Akira himself, who must consider himself a Van Gogh, in an
age where they do not appreciate the real art of the spirit, much less the
country.</P>
<P>As usual, the film is beautifully filmed, with startling color, and so alive
as to make us quite a part of it.  In the field of flowers, where the
painter works, the camera rarely lifts itself above the level of the flowers
who touch the camera lovingly.  A startling commentary about what art is,
rather than what a movie is.  While the actual 'copy' is not what Van Gogh
does, the camera does the same, by providing us with the real inspiration,
rather than money.</P>
<P>A MUST SEE FILM FOR AKIRA KUROSAWA FANS.
BEAUTIFUL CINEMATOGRAPHY.
PERSONAL FILM, IN THAT IT HAS ELEMENTS WHICH COULD BE THOUGHT OF AS
FANCIFUL FLIGHTS OF THE IMAGINATION.</P>
