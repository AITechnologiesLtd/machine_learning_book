<P>It is no secret that America has its share of homophobia and racism abounding
in all corners of every state. I am sure in Falls City, Nebraska, it is no
different. The girl who passed herself off as a boy named Brandon Teena
probably knew that such homophobia existed but that did not stop him (I will
refer to Brandon as a male) from being true to herself. And so commences the
bristling, highly effective "Boys Don't Cry," a debut film by director Kimberly
Peirce based on a true story. An incredibly mesmerizing film, Peirce certainly
shows a gift for handling actors and raw emotions. </P>
<P>The highly magnetic Hilary Swank stars as Brandon Teena, formerly Teena
Brandon, who moves to Falls City despite the hesitations and warnings from her
cousin. Brandon makes fast friends in Falls City with some beer-swilling,
truck-driving, pot-smoking young people. Two of them (Peter Saarsgard and
Brendan Sexton III) are former jail buddies with nothing on their minds except
drinking and putting their hands through flames. But there is one Brandon has
his eye on - the dour-looking female teen who loves karaoke, Lana (Chloe
Sevigny). She drinks heavily and works in a factory, but is immediately smitten
by Brandon because he is so unlike any other males she has encountered in this
dead-end town. Brandon respects her, and suddenly, Lana seems to overcome her
sullenness and becomes full of life - as if a diamond had sprung and sparkled
her sensibilities. </P>
<P>Brandon has a troubled past to contend with, however, and it inevitably catches
up with him. He has robbed, cheated and lied but all for a positive cause in a
way, to stay true to himself. Brandon wants to do away with girlish
sensibilities - he cuts his hair short and places a sock in between his legs.
And he gets away with it! He asks girls out in roller-skating rinks and treats
them like queens. Lana is the latest girl to be comforted by Brandon, and even
if there is the danger of her finding out what his real gender is, we know she
will still love him. </P>
<P>"Boys Don't Cry" has two magnificent performances that will touch the heart and
rivet the soul. Hilary Swank is clearly amazing in that she looks like a boy
and we respond to her as such - her beaming smile glows and makes Brandon that
much more sympathetic a character. We know there is an inevitable tragedy he
will face, and so the tension builds because Brandon means well and is
harmless. </P>
<P>Chloe Sevigny also undergoes a miraculous transformation, from her binge
drinking habits and dourness to a pleasing beauty with an angelic face waiting
to be loved. Ever since her dramatic turns in "Kids" and "Trees Lounge," I have
fallen in love with Chloe - her presence evokes compassion, much like the late
Audrey Hepburn. It is a quality unheard of in most young actresses today, but
Chloe has it down pat.</P>
<P>"Boys Don't Cry" is raw and painful, and is not intended for general audiences,
but those who can deal with the subject matter will be rewarded with the
performances of Swank and Sevigny. They embody the film with sweetness and raw,
naked emotion - their relationship is as real as any love story I have seen of
late. If I have any complaints about the film, it is only that I wished to see
how Brandon tried to adapt from day-to-day as a boy - there is one scene where
he has to buy tampons but otherwise, he seems to be able to deal with the
situation remarkably well. Still, director Peirce knows that the heart of the
film is Brandon, the rebel without a cause. His only concern is to have a sex
operation and to live with Lana in Memphis. He has ambitions and dreams ("You
hallucinate 24 hours a day," says one character about Brandon) but his main
focus is to be free and to live. The fact that he couldn't is what makes "Boys
Don't Cry" such a moving, poetic experience. </P>
