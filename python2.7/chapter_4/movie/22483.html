<PRE>FANTASIA/2000
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>When Disney released the original FANTASIA in 1940, they envisioned it
to be a "perpetual work in progress," with a new version coming out
regularly, something that has never happened until now.  For the movie's
60th anniversary, Disney has devised an almost all-new film; only
Mickey's famous "Sorcerer's Apprentice" segment remains.</P>
<P>FANTASIA, perhaps cinema's most beloved musical montage, has not merely
been updated.  It has an entirely new medium for its latest incarnation.
Disney decided that they would shoot it in IMAX, a format normally
reserved for films in which the viewers vicariously risk their lives
climbing mountains (EVEREST) or riding roller coasters (THRILL RIDE).</P>
<P>The resulting film, FANTASIA/2000, is a real treat for the ears.  As
classical music from "The Pines of Rome" to "The Pomp and Circumstance
March" booms out of the theater's monster speakers, one has to be in
awe.</P>
<P>It is in the visuals that the movie comes up so short that it has to be
labeled a disappointment.  Given the three-dimensional realism that
we've seen this past year from Disney (TARZAN), Pixar/Disney (TOY STORY
2) and other studios (THE PRINCESS MONONOKE), most of the illustrations
in FANTASIA/2000 look flat and uninviting by comparison.</P>
<P>Then there is the choice of IMAX as the medium, which might seem a cute
idea but turns out to be a fundamental mistake.  Blown up several
stories high, the animation's flaws are magnified.  What should be
compelling instead turns out to be too busy and garish as gigantic
images flash across the screen.</P>
<P>Mickey's segment, especially, suffers by being stretched.  Why they
didn't repaint the colors is a mystery because it leaves this episode
looking needlessly dated due to its grainy texture.  When it ends, they
cut to a properly colored Mickey, which just emphasizes the inadequate
restoration of the original portion.</P>
<P>FANTASIA/2000 isn't a bad movie, just one with so much potential that it
causes you to dwell on its flaws.  Take the whale sequence.  As these
beautiful animals frolic and splash in the ocean, the director decided
not to include any sound effects.  Normally such a scene would have had
some realistic water sounds overlaid with the music.  Without them, the
piece has a strangely remote and detached feeling.</P>
<P>Go in with low expectations, try not to be too demanding when it comes
to the animation and FANTASIA/2000 will prove a pleasant enough
experience.  Just try to forget how good it could and should have been.</P>
<P>FANTASIA/2000 runs 1:15.  It is rated G and would be fine for all ages,
although many kids will be bored as there is little plot to hold their
attention.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 10, liked the movie enough to give it ** 1/2.  It
was so different for him that he didn't know quite what to make of it or
how to rate it.  He liked most of the segments, except the ending one,
which he found too fast and confusing.</P>
