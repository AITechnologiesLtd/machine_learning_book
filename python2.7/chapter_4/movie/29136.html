<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A B-film noir about a family threat from an abusive husband. Dorothy McGuire has
been on the run for the last 18 years from her husband, and is frightened at
what he will now do to her and her daughter. The film opens with its scary scene
of Crystal Benson's (Dorothy McGuire) gangster husband, Steve Blackford (Stephen
McNally), roaming around unseen in the shadows of her house. She senses he is
there, but as she roams the house she can't spot him. He has found her in a
small New Mexico town, even though she has a new identity, after spending 18
years in prison for supposedly murdering her. He is now out on parole. </P>
<P>Crystal makes a tape recording explaining her past, as she relates to when she
was a 19-year-old and met a charming man at a dance. Her mother warned her that
Steve was a gangster, but she fell in love and married him. She soon was living
in luxury, as her hubby was a collector for the mob. When she found out through
the newspaper headlines that her husband murdered a cop, she decides to run away
from the mean-spirited man. But he refuses to give her up. After a year or so
passes, Steve, who beat the murder rap with the cop, accidently sets off some
explosives in his place. This killed the lady he was spending the night with,
but the cops think the unidentified woman is his wife and he killed her to stop
her from talking. He is sentenced for that murder, as Crystal refused to
exonerate him. She starts a new life for herself in Candlewood, New Mexico, has
his child, Randi (Murphy), and becomes a successful newspaper publisher and
respected citizen. But she has told no one of her past, and is deeply worried
about what others would think of her if they found out the truth. </P>
<P>Steve pushes his way into her home posing as her brother and he charms Randi,
extorts money from Crystal, and is bent on ruining her life. She asks her pilot
boyfriend, Josh (John Howard), to fly her and Randi to Mexico to escape from her
insane brother, which he agrees to do but is puzzled about what she is afraid
of. </P>
<P>Warning: spoiler to follow in next paragraph. </P>
<P>When a robbery and murder is committed, Sheriff Lafe (Buchanan), arrests a local
Mexican kid who is known to have a temper, Rudolfo. But the sheriff soon traces
the murder weapon to Steve. The climax results in Crystal being able to keep her
lie as Steve falls to his death in the Indian burial ground, as the solid
citizen still is caught by the dubious morality of her actions and can't let go
of that lie. </P>
<P>This revenge film was fast-paced and well-acted, but its story is too
far-fetched to be completely convincing. </P>
