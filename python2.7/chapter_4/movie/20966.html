<P>Through Get Shorty we learned that to make it in Hollywood, you have to be
not of Hollywood. That way all your 'foreign' methods of doing things will
be just new enough to work. The west coast was a cakewalk for Chili Palmer
and his in your face, loan-shark approach. It's similarly easy for Sarah
Little (Sharon Stone), the muse of Albert Brooks' The Muse, not to be
confused with Mighty Aphrodite, though the reflective brand of humor in both
targets more or less the same audience and both are organized around the
continual dilemmas of a neurotic/sardonic male lead and his associations
with a mysterious women. Unlike Mighty Aphrodite, however, this is LA,
meaning that Lorenzo Lamas is in the diner, Rob Reiner's at the aquarium,
James Cameron is at the doorstep, Martin Scorcese's desperately seeking
Starbuck's. As in The Player, too, this long string of cameos is just part
of the behind-the-scenes- of-Hollywood Hollywood movie, pulling back the
curtain on the machinery which makes the magic.
What The Muse does to that machine, though, is make it magic as well. Sarah
Little claims to be the daughter of Zeus, you see. Which makes her
significantly more foreign than Chili Palmer (Olympia vs. Florida). And more
than claims: she has all the big-name producers and directors at her beck
and call, everyone dependent upon her for inspiration. Enter
'past-his-prime' screenwriter Steven Phillips, (Albert Brooks, same
character as always, different name) just let go by a major studio because
he's supposedly lost his edge. Edge or no, though, he has a family to
support, meaning soon enough he's just desperate enough to believe in
earthly deities, divine manifestations, whatever it takes to get his 'edge'
back, make him a commodity again.
The thing is, though--as he finds out--muses are high-maintenance, requiring
ideal conditions to sleep, midnight salads, spontaneous daytrips, limousines
etc, all of which harry Steven to the point of exhaustion, strain his
marriage in the usual, comical ways, all that. Which is satisfying. To add
to the mix he even has an advisor, Jack (Jeff Bridges, not playing Jeff
Bridges, which, in a cameo-heavy show, is initially confusing), who's also
dependent on Sarah for inspiration. In a movie founded in myth, though, of
course the main character will have an advisor. And of course Jeff Bridges
pulls it off with grace; his tennis-serving scene is one of the two
high-points of it all.
The second high point has to be at a cocktail party, when Brooks really lets
go with his signature ability to spool dialogue line on top of line, and
somehow keep it all at least peripherally pertinent. Every time you think
the back and forth is over, it's not, which is definitely his strength. It's
why everyone quotes Broadcast News. But The Muse isn't just about
underbreath conversation (though it does start slow and hushed, until Sarah
gets on-screen). As expected, it's a touch intellectual as well, even going
so far as to toy with the foundational myth-structure, or, to foreground
what's usually repressed in these divine-intervention mythic cycles: the
host/parasite dynamic. The way Sarah is at least as dependent upon Steven as
Steven is dependent upon her, which is something of a wry comment upon
religion, perhaps, or at least upon a culture always looking over its
shoulder to Greece. But quiet enough not to get in the way, too.
This is, after all, a movie about the moviemakers, or, the realization of a
screenplay about a screenwriter. It has to hold itself to a higher, more
self-conscious standard. Is it Skin Deep or Barton Fink, though, right?
Well, it has elements of both--even a surprise Coen-ish ending, minus the
John Goodman serial killer--but the laugh-a-minute pacing pushes it perhaps
a little more in John Ritter's direction, which isn't at all a bad thing.
