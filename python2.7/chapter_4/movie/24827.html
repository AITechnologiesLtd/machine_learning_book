<PRE>"Shanghai Noon" - Chan Can Chop but Story Has No Punch
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>Non-alcoholic beer.  Sugar-free cookies.  Fat-free ice
cream.  These look good, but they just don't quite
satisfy.  Now you can add "Shanghai Noon" to this
list.  Set in the year 1881, this adventure-comedy
about cowboys, Indians, and a Chinese Imperial Guard
looks great.  The impressive cinematography shows the
pomp of Imperial Guards (who sport very festive
looking garb) practicing martial arts in unison, the
majesty of the vast Western expanse, and the beauty of
snow-capped mountains.  However, once you move beyond
the first 30 minutes and start looking for a story,
you'll find that the plot becomes less coherent than
President Clinton's explanation about his relationship
with Monica Lewinsky.</P>
<P>The story begins in the fabled Forbidden City where
hundreds of Imperial Guards are drilling in the main
courtyard.  Among them is Chon Wang (Chan), a loyal
protector bound by honor and oath.  Included among
those that he has sworn to protect is the demure
Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu).  Faced with the
unpleasant prospect of taking part in an arranged
marriage, she decides to escape to America.  Chon
tries to stop her, but when the Princess coldly stares
at him and demands that he desists, his reverence for
her makes him completely powerless.  His moment of
weakness, however, proves to be disastrous.  Once the
Princess reaches America, she is kidnapped.  To right
his mistake, he volunteers to go to America to rescue
her.  </P>
<P>Chon certainly possesses the fighting skills necessary
to fend off rowdy cowboys, dimwitted bandits, and even
a hostile group of Indians.  These encounters allow
Chan to display his trademark comical fighting style. 
When he's not delivering a punch or a roundhouse kick,
he's jumping through trees or scurrying through
windows.  And when he's up against a superior number
of foes, he quickly improvises and uses unconventional
objects as weapons.  The most unique sequence involves
a battle with a gun-wielding posse in which our hero
skillfully uses a horseshoe and a piece of rope to
dispatch his opponents.  Chan is not a vicious fighter
who is intent on maiming his opponent.  Rather, he
just seems content on knocking them down.  Thus,
despite some bone-crunching sound effects, the fight
scenes are completely bloodless.  </P>
<P>Eventually, Chon team's up with the smug yet amiable
outlaw, Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson).  Chon hopes that
Roy's familiarity with the territory may be of an
asset.  Meanwhile, Roy feels that locating the
Princess might yield some lucrative benefits.  Teaming
these two together, however, slows the movie down
considerably.  While Chan and Wilson seem comfortable
in their roles, they didn't really have any chemistry.
 Chan could have done this as a solo project. 
Wilson's inclusion seemed to only accomplish adding
another bad guy to the mix, an ornery and
reward-hungry gunslinger (Xander Berkeley).</P>
<P>"Shanghai Noon" is fun to watch when it focuses on
Chon's mission to save the Princess.  But as the story
progresses, there are a number of other subplots that
are introduced but are never fully resolved.  This
becomes quite distracting.  For example, Wen is
supposed to avenge the death of someone, a plot that
seems totally forgotten.  Princess Pei Pei learns
something about the common person, but this notion is
never furthered.  These are all noble ideas, but they
dissipate like noble gases.  Even stranger, there is
no clear reason for having a villain.  The audience is
left completely in the dark as to his motivation and
grand scheme.</P>
<P>Regardless of how silly the film is, it is always a
treat to watch the buoyant Jackie Chan.  Part fighting
machine and part clown, he can simultaneously make you
awe in wonder with his deft martial arts moves and
make you laugh like a little kid because deep inside,
Chan is a doting child who has never quite grown up. 
There is no other performer like him, so any of his
films are usually worth the price of matinee.</P>
