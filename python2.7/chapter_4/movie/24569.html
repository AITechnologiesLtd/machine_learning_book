<PRE>                          BUT I'M A CHEERLEADER
                    A film review by Christopher Null
                      Copyright 2000 filmcritic.com

<P>     Take director Jon Waters and give him a really good actress like
Natasha Lyonne, a paltry budget of, say, $1 million, and ask him to make
a satire about a "gay rehab camp," and you might come up with something
like But I'm a Cheerleader.</P>
<P>     Then again, Waters might have come up with something funny, like
Pecker.  With such a meaty topic as Family Values ripe for a send-up,
you'd think it would be easy to milk Cheerleader for comic value.
Unfortunately, first-time feature director Jamie Babbit (whose few
credits including directing the MTV series "Undressed" and acting as
script supervisor on The Game) doesn't appear to have much ability
behind the camera, which becomes painfully apparent after only a few
minutes.</P>
<P>     The story follows Megan (Lyonne), a high school cheerleader who
wrestles with lesbian tendencies.  She dreams of women's thighs while
her boyfriend tongue-bathes her.  She even has a Melissa Etheridge
poster.  Naturally, mom and dad want this gayness nipped in the bud, so
they call in "True Directions," a homosexual-rehab group run by Mary
Brown (Cathy Moriarty) that resembles 28 Days detox-center crossed with
a McDonald's kiddie play area.</P>
<P>     Everything at True Directions is cast in hot pink or baby blue (to
let the recruits empathize with their gender), and exercises consist of
learning to vacuum (ladies) and chopping wood (guys).  Naturally, there
are self-affirmations and admissions of homosexuality -- all part of the
road to healing.</P>
<P>     In the clink, Megan meets rough-and-tumble lesbian Graham (Clea
DuVall, looking to make a career out of playing rough-and-tumble lesbian
types), and naturally they fall in love.  Will they run off together and
become societal outcasts or will they graduate?  Well, you need only
wait about 75 zippy minutes to find out.</P>
<P>     But I'm a Cheerleader plays a lot like a sitcom, only not a very
funny one.  (Perhaps a laugh track would have helped?)  The addition of
good actors like Melanie Lynskey (Heavenly Creatures) and Michelle
Williams (Halloween: H2O) is far outweighed by using yesterday's
pop-culture jokes like RuPaul (not in drag!), Mink Stole, and especially
Moriarty.  The editing, directing, and cinematography don't help,
either.  (Have fun while you watch: see how many times you can count the
boom microphone drifting into frame!)  The result is a haphazardly
constructed mess that's totally off when it comes to comedic timing, and
essentially unable to muster even the tiniest bit of sympathy for any of
its cast, even if True Directions-style places really do exist.</P>
<P>     But perhaps the most egregious error is casting Natasha Lyonne as a
cheerleader.  Lesbian, yes.  Cheerleader, no.  Lyonne strikes me as more
of a band girl.  Oh right -- I almost forgot -- it's supposed to be a
satire.</P>
