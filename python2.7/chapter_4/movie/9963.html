<P>John Grisham is a best-selling novelist and, to borrow from film language,
an "auteur" in the narrow sense, as he specializes in one genre (legal
yarns) the way X does in horror or Y in romance. But he is no writer. His
prose lacks style and nuances, his characters have to struggle to reach two
dimensions.</P>
<P>He was lucky to have Francis Coppola write and direct "The Rainmaker."
Coppola's script cuts out many of the repetitions and subplots of the book,
streamlines, smoothes it without oversimplifying it, improves it
significantly.</P>
<P>The film comes at the heels of another lawyer movie, "The Devil's Advocate"
in which lawyers are devils and vice versa --literally. It is done in silly
ways that use the supernatural as a facile alibi. "The Rainmaker" sticks to
much more convincing and affecting realism.</P>
<P>Matt Damon plays Rudy Baylor, who worked his way through a lesser  law
school, finished and found a job in Memphis with a sleazy lawyer with
underworld contacts,  Bruiser Stone (Mickey Rourke). Bruiser's office  is
in character, with a minimal law Library but a tank of sharks.</P>
<P>Flat broke Rudy, evicted from his apartment, using his jalopy as home, must
do his tasks for Bruise yet also study for his bar exams, which he does in
a bar owned by Bruise (a good verbal gag) and later in the cafeteria of a
hospital.</P>
<P>Usually, Rourke's presence guarantees a picture's worthlessness, but here
he is beautifully cast. His legman-assistant is Deck Schiffler (Danny
DeVito), ex-salesman, law graduate, record holder in failing the bar exams
--six times. An ambulance-chasing con-man par excellence, he is amoral
rather than immoral. Matters of conscience as as alien to him as a bottle
of Chateau Latour would be to a Dr. Pepper drinker. He is even oddly
likable and very, very funny.</P>
<P>Rudy may sound like an idealist by lawyeresque standards, yet he is simply
a decent youth with respect for the law and warmth for fellow humans. His
duties send him to one main case, that of the Black family, humble people
whose son is dying from leukemia because the huge insurance firm Great
Benefit has refused coverage and claims, not once but eight times.</P>
<P>Rudy passes the bar exams, Bruiser disappears when the Feds get after him,
Rudy and "paralegal" Deck form a threadbare partnership. The two nothings
take on the insurance giant and its phalanx of platinum-plated lawyers led
by the remorseless, semi-oily, clever, experienced, influential Leo
Drummond, whom Jon Voight plays to the nasty hilt but without cliched
caricaturing.</P>
<P>The film's core is the battle royal between David Rudy and Goliath Great
Benefit. I will not give away the twists , turns , twists within turns of
the fight's strategies, a far cry from a mere Biblical slingshot. I could
not reveal the plot in any case, as it is convoluted and requires a
viewer's concentration. Its essence is a powerful expose of enormous scams
of the kinds that are all around us. Rudy turns into an investigative
sleuth ,a muckracker (a splendid word, often misunderstood) akin to those
who have made "60 Minutes" on CBS the most facinating and needed program of
its kind.</P>
<P>DeVito is terrific as he  both lightens and advances the film with comic
relief. Coppola had lightened the structure of the plot with his cuts. Yet
he still retained the character of  Kelly (Claire Danes), a horribly and
regularly beaten up woman --by a beast of a "loving" yet deranged husband.
She and Rudy meet at the hospital cafeteria where he retreats to study. You
guesse the rest. But as the de developments in Kelly's case are quite
complex, the film can only sketch them out. I think it might have survived
more smoothly had this "de rigeur" Hollywoodian boy-meets-girl entirely
excised.</P>
<P>Lone Rudy,innocent in the ways of lawyering, forms personal attachments
with his cases. This is less of a problem with Miss Birdie, a charmingly
pixillated old lady (Teresa Wright, 25 and unforgettable in Hitchcock's
"Shadow of a Doubt," 79 now). She wants to cut out her relatives from her
will and leave everything to a TV preacher, a phony, we surmise  Rudy
gently retorts that the man is well provided for. She replies that he has
much overhead and besides "his jet is getting old." When Miss Birdie's
sleazy son and wife come from Florida, he sells them the story that the
Miss Birdie is wealthy. Pronto, they switch from despising her to fawning.</P>
<P>So much of the film is under the sign of sleaze. The first judge we meet
(played by Dean Stockwell) is sleazy in his way. So are the elegant
"suits,"the lawyers, and the insurance company's casually chic CEO (Roy
Scheider). But the women are not --and this comes organically, naturally,
not as a sop to feminism.</P>
<P>All the actors are perfectly cast and give marvelously good performances
-both Coppola hallmarks. Among the thespians: Red West  (the desperate,
alcoholic father of the dying young man), Mary Kay Place (the mother),
Johnny Whitworth (their son), Virginia Madsen(a witness), etc. Danny
Glover, the new judge, comes from a civil rights, pro-underdog background.
He has natural elegance, a discreet yet formidable presence, a faint but
clear twinkle in his eyes, and the talent to skew some issues gently when
he judges them to serve justice best.</P>
<P>The players would not have been so good without Coppola's guidance. The
bashing of corporate America and its minions does not have to be heavily
underlined. The mere presence of  humane, morally clean young Rudy does it.
By opposing the lawyer-sharks, Rudy is not so much a knight in shining
armor as he is the decent exception that confirms the rule.</P>
