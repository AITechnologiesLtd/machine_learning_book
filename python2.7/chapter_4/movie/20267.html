<P>   The Lost World.  Batman and Robin.  These movies bring
shudders to all motion picture fans, and with good reason.  What are they? 
Sequels.  The word sequel always brings one word to fans: bad.  Is it
fair to expect a sequel to live up to its original?  No, but most sequels turn
out to be terrible.  Some films have succeeded, not only at the box office like
all sequels do, but also in the plot and acting.  The Spy Who Shagged Me
is a perfect example that sequels can outdo their predecessor.
   First things first, you will not be seeing Mike Myers at the Oscars. 
The Spy Who Shagged Me is not going to be an Oscar contender, but it is
a comedy that accomplishes everything that it sets out to do.  Mike Myers not
only co-wrote the script, he also plays three different and important roles in
the film.  As in the original, he plays Austin Powers and Dr. Evil, but he also
introduces a Scottish spy known as Fat Bastard.  Unlike the original, Dr. Evil
is the main comedic attraction and he does not disappoint.  Fat Bastard is also
terrifically played by Myers.
   The Spy Who Shagged Me is basically an &quot;evil&quot; movie. 
The best moments of the film come from Dr. Evil and his associates.  This is
because of the excellent casting job done for the film.  First and foremost,
Dr. Evil is hilarious.  Myers establishes himself as a legitimate comedic
performer by showing that toilet humor can be original and hilarious as long as
it is done right.  Robert Wagner sets up some great jokes for Dr. Evil early in
the film, and then Rob Lowe takes over as the Young Number Two.  Rob Lowe's
performance is identical to Robert Wagner's.  Lowe realizes he is not there to
be a comedian, he is there to setup his counterparts and he does it
beautifully.  He sounds exactly like Robert Wagner, and works beautifully with
Myers.  Seth Green is back as Scott Evil, Dr. Evil's son, and his cynical view
of his father just adds to the humor.  Perhaps the biggest and best addition to
the cast came from the smallest member who did not have any lines.  This man,
or midget, is Mini-Me, played by Verne Troyer.  He does not speak, but Dr.
Evil's love for him sets up even more jokes.  Plus, his fight with Austin
Powers is terrific.  Last, Dr. Evil's newest spy in the Ministry of Defense,
Fat Bastard played by Myers, adds to the evil experience.  The constant fat
jokes may seem politically incorrect, but Myers does it with such flair that
you cannot resist laughter.
   What about the other side of the spectrum?  Austin Powers is back, and
once again played by Myers.  In International Man of Mystery, Powers was
the leading man and was hilarious.  He is not quite as funny in this one, but
he still has his moments and Dr. Evil does pick up the slack.  At the beginning
of the film, he is with his with Vanessa, played by Elizabeth Hurley.  But, she
is killed off in the first five minutes, which opens the gates for a new
partner for Powers.  Enter Heather Graham.  She plays Felicity Shagwell and is
the perfect contrast for the humor of Austin Powers.  Unlike Hurley, Graham is
not as reserved and she is just as &quot;randy&quot; as Powers.  And better
yet, Powers has lost his mojo, which makes their pairing all the better.  
   According to Myers, The Spy Who Shagged Me is forty- percent
improv.  This is not that bad, considering how funny the film is, but it can
get a little old at times, but this is nothing but a small problem.  Is there
anything else wrong with this film?  Yes, it is pretty short.  Compared to
other films, this is a short jog at ninety-five minutes.  But, it is packed
with jokes and never loses pace.
   Overall, The Spy Who Shagged Me establishes itself as the
Mary of 1999 and it is a worthy successor.  The randy comedy legitimizes
Myers as a comedic powerhouse and Powers' success at the box office
almost locks up a trilogy for the Powers franchise.  Yeah, baby,
yeah!
