<P>     As appealing as Alicia Silverstone is (and she possesses that 
ethereal "star quality" which is sadly lacking in many of today's up-
and-coming performers), her presence can't rescue this aptly-titled 
movie.  Part pop satire and part teen comedy, CLUELESS shows its 
unevenness early, runs out of steam about midway through, then sputters 
to a conclusion that takes an eternity to arrive at.  Like THE BRADY 
BUNCH MOVIE, this film contains some amusing moments, but not enough to 
justify a feature-length running time.  Charm this thin doesn't take 
long to wear off. </P>
<P>     Silverstone (THE CRUSH) leads the cast as ultra-Valley girl Cher -- 
a 16-year old with a very rich daddy (Dan Hedaya, best known as Carla's 
ex on CHEERS) who uses a computer to assist with her wardrobe selection 
and would rather argue with her teachers for better grades than do 
assignments to earn them.  Cher loves to talk, as is amply demonstrated 
by a series of endless voice-overs that occur throughout the film.  Her 
best friend, Dionne (Stacey Dash), is equally as superficial, so it's 
not hard to understand why the two get along so well.  CLUELESS looks at 
a number of Cher's "escapades":  her attempts to turn a sweet-but-uncool 
schoolmate (Brittany Murphy) into the epitome of popularity, her 
matchmaking between two teachers (Twink Kaplan and respected character 
actor Wallace Shawn), and her search for true love.  Essentially, 
nothing much happens -- the film is an excuse to plunge into the life of 
a caricature that Silverstone makes more appealing than one might 
reasonably expect. </P>
<P>     Much of the humor is sophomoric.  Moments of inventive comedy (such 
as an unexpected ride on the freeway) are far between.  Writer/director 
Amy Heckerling creates a tone so light that it borders on vapid.  On the 
other hand, some of the dialogue is clever, and there are a few 
memorable lines.  Ren and Stimpy are described as "way existential".  In 
the spirit of political correctness, female virgins are called 
"hymenally challenged".  And Cher likens her hopeless quest for a high 
school boyfriend to "searching for meaning in a Pauly Shore movie." </P>
<P>     Overall, though, that's all CLUELESS amounts to:  a group of 
modestly amusing, satirical vignettes tied together by one-liners.  The 
picture doesn't offer any big laughs, and there's never any character 
identification -- Heckerling's FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH, a top-level 
teen picture, worked in large part because the protagonists seemed real.  
In that case, Cameron Crowe's script aimed for fun and feeling.  Here, 
the latter is sacrificed for the former, and the result doesn't leave 
much of an impression.  In part because the film is so inoffensive (no 
sex, nudity, or violence), it has no edge.  CLUELESS is the cinematic 
equivalent of cotton candy:  certainly not unpleasant, but unsatisfying 
despite the sweet taste. </P>
