<P>Let it be known that I was one of the very few individuals to want
BRAVEHEART to lose at the Oscars to BABE, the 1995 family film.  Of
course, that was before I became the cynical and jaded person I have
become.  I preferred films that dealt with happy subjects.  I didn't
like SE7EN the first time I saw it in 1995.  Now, I think it's 1995's
best film.  As you can tell, my taste in film has changed considerably
(mind you, I still think BABE should have won, since SE7EN wasn't
nominated).  So upon hearing about the release of a sequel to BABE, I
was worried that I might not like it.  From the previews, I thought I
would hate it.</P>
<P>And gosh darn it, it takes those expectations and flips them
completely.  Just as the first film did, it surprises with a touching
and heartfelt story that is very hard to find these days.  Taking
themes that can be used in everyday life, Babe created a modern day
fairy tale.  The old story of an outsider trying to find his place in
society was reinvented for animals.  A pig, stolen from his mother,
gets sold to a farmer.  This farmer nurtures him, hoping for a
fantastic Thanksgiving ham.  But he then spots something different:
this pig could herd sheep better than any sheep dog ever could.</P>
<P>Well now that pig is back, and I couldn't be happier.  Frankly, this
is exactly what a sequel should be.  It doesn't really improve on the
original... it builds on it, making the franchise as a whole more
solid.  It's not better than the original, mostly due to some
particular plot elements that keep it from reaching the status that
Babe did.  But other elements, most notably the visual style, improves
dramatically.  For once, a sequel that doesn't rely on rehashing the
same old themes the original did.  Surprisingly, I wouldn't mind it if
this film were nominated for Best Picture again.  You aren't going to
find a better family film all year long.</P>
<P>BABE: PIG IN THE CITY begins precisely when the original left off.  As
we left Farmer Hoggett (James Cromwell) three years ago, his pig Babe
(now voiced by Elizabeth Daily) won the sheep herding contest after
being ridiculed by humans and animals alike.  A parade is now thrown
for the pig and his "human" as they arrive back home to greet his
loving wife, Esme Hoggett (Magda Szubanski).  But trouble is around
the corner.  As Babe wonders what to do next, he watches as Farmer
Hoggett descends into their well out back, in order to update it.
Unfortunately, Babe gets a bit too close, and falls in, causing
Hoggett to smash his finger in the pulley, plunge to the bottom of the
well, and get hit on the head by the counterweight which held him up.
Needless to say, he is unable to work for quite a while.</P>
<P>Esme takes over the chores, but she finds herself struggling, and
soon, two men dressed in black, their eyes seeming hollow and
soulless, arrive.  Yes...  they're bankers.  They want to sell the
farm unless the Hoggetts can come up with money to pay for their
mortgage.  Despite the prestige the pig has brought them, they are
still struggling.  They received many invitations for the pig to come
perform.  In return, a nice sum of money will be rewarded.  Esme
decides to take Babe to the festival, hoping the money will suffice to
save the farm.  But trouble brews when a drug-sniffing dog shows Babe
how he gets security's attention.  Esme is now suspected for carrying
drugs, and she misses her connecting flight to the festival.
Depressed, she wanders aimlessly to find a motel that will accept
pets.  Being unsuccessful, she sits and waits in the airport when a
mysterious janitor hands her an address.  "They'll take care of you
there," he says.</P>
<P>She finds the hotel, a massive, four-story building one might find in
Disneyland.  The landlady (Mary Stein) seems nervous and fidgety, and
finally accepts the two into the hotel.  Inside is a world of animals,
varying from dogs to cats to mice to monkeys.  Outside is a world of
hatred and anger.  Babe now must befriend his fellow inhabitants, find
food, rescue enemies, and save the farm.  How can one pig do all this?
Easy, when you are Babe.</P>
<P>While the plot seems rather childish and loony, it's handled with the
utmost intelligence, mixing themes with thoroughly entertaining sight
gags.  Instead of trying to fit one pig into a different world, we
have a pig trying to unite two sides together.  In order to
successfully live, the enemies of instinct must combine and set aside
their natural urges.  When Esme travels outside the hotel to find a
pay phone, she discovers a world of hatred, one very similar to the
animals' world.  Surprisingly, these complex themes are handled very
well, and the adult viewer will be pleasantly surprised by the
intelligence in which it is handled.  While some family films pander
to the lowest common denominator just to amuse kids, BABE: PIG IN THE
CITY tries it's hardest to entertain everyone at the same time.  And
it does, on every aspect.</P>
<P>Visually, this is definitely one of the best of the year, definitely
beating WHAT DREAMS MAY COME and even PLEASANTVILLE.  Full of
incredibly funny sight gags, from the wickedly designed hotel to the
humorous landscapes, BABE: PIG IN THE CITY incredulously improves on
its predecessor in this aspect.  Looking out the window of the hotel,
one can see America scrunched down into one city.  You see the
Hollywood sign on one end, and the Statue of Liberty on the other.
Frankly, this film will be nominated for at least one Oscar, and
that's for Best Set Design.  Roger Ford, the production designer, will
receive an Oscar nomination again for his work on this sequel.  If he
does not, then there is no justice in the world.  Frankly, I don't see
how the Academy could overlook his work.  Every set is immensely
appealing.  The hotel and the surrounding Venice-like waterways are a
sight to behold.  The puppet animals, such as the pelicans, are
wonderfully cartoon-ish.  Simply put, it's a real-life cartoon.  It's
pure eye-candy, and I ate it up intently.</P>
<P>Costume designer Norma Moriceau has an incredible job, creating
costumes for every single animal and human.  This varies from
black-and-white tuxes and ballroom gowns, to sweaters and clown suits,
Moriceau impressively creates a perfect costume for each individual's
personality.  The cinematography Andrew Lesnie does an extremely good
job at capturing the fairy tale-like story that unfolds before the
camera.  The colors are vivid and bright, even in the middle of the
night.  Look for both to be nominated at the Oscars.  Animal trainers
Karl Lewis Miller and Steve Martin (no, not that Steve Martin)
arguably had the motherload of the work placed on them.  Many animal
films have animals that obey simple commands or seem just like
animals.  But here, the animals come to life, producing extremely
life-like characters.  If it were possible, I believe that Bob (Steven
Wright) and Zootie (Glenne Headley), the husband-and-wife chimps in
Fugley Floom's (Mickey Roonie), deserve Best Supporting Actor and
Actress awards.  I'm not kidding.  You really have to see their
performances to believe it.  In the history of film, I have never even
thought of an animal receiving an Oscar nomination.  Here, I have made
an exception.</P>
<P>The performances are uniformly terrific, despite the lacking presence
of 1995's Oscar-nominee James Cromwell.  Though he has a limited
performance, we still care about him from the first film.  Now, we get
to learn more about Mrs.  Hoggett, portrayed by Magda Szubanski who
exudes energy in every inch of the frame.  Frankly, I feel sequels
should do this more often: center on a different character, instead of
the original human lead.  Now, we know both characters equally well.
Szubanski is a gem to behold as she fights to save her farm.  She
balances the film very well.  The other main human character is Mary
Stein.  Making brief appearances on "Star Trek: The Next Generation"
and other various shows, she finally lands a role that could introduce
her to the world.  Her towering 6-foot-1 body is appropriate for the
strange role, but she plays it with deadpan humor.  As soon as I saw
her, I knew I'd like her.  Mickey Rooney also makes a brief
appearance, but he has a heart attack and is removed from the film
rather quickly.</P>
<P>The voices are also terrific, especially the two aforementioned
chimps.  Frankly, I don't want to mention all of them, so I'll just
give a list of my favorites.  Elizabeth Daily, of course, who takes
over Christine Cavanaugh's vocalizations from the previous film.
Strangely, you can't tell the difference (it may be that Cavanaugh and
Daily both provide voices for "The Rugrats" television show).  Danny
Mann is Ferdinand, the quirky duck who hates to be without Babe at his
side.  Mann is hysterical once again.  The scene-stealers are Wright
and Headly, who turn in incredibly delicious vocal performances.  If
these two actors could receive Oscar nominations for their voice work
alone, they should.  James Cosmo, Nathan Kress, and Myles Jeffrey all
do great work as the other chimps.  Adam Goldberg is hilarious as an
arthritis-stricken dog who must wheel around in a hind-leg coach.  And
while I'm not sure who did the voice, the little kitten who complains,
"I'm still hungry," is sad but cute at the same time.</P>
<P>Director George Miller, who also produced and co-wrote the original,
has done an immense job in bringing this film to life.  Filmed in
Australia where filming is much cheaper, Miller was able to capture
the same intensity and tone the original had.  His impressive resume
continues to grow (it's hard to believe this is the same guy who
provided us with pure evil in THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK).  The writing
team of Miller, Judy Morris, and Mark Lamprell have crafted a
finely-tuned screenplay with witty dialogue that never seems tacky or
forced.  It's smart, funny, and sad all at the same time.  Just as
many sequels are, this one is darker than the original, but as they
say, "The best family films always have a dark side."  To prove this,
just look at the classics: THE WIZARD OF OZ, MATILDA, SLEEPING BEAUTY,
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.  All had dark sides to them.  BABE: PIG IN THE
CITY is no different.  The music is pretty similar to the original,
right down to the singing mice (this time, a little more
prominently... just 'cause they're so cute!).  This is one of those
few films that provides you with many different emotions, but you
leave the theater feeling good all over.</P>
<P>BABE: PIG IN THE CITY is rated G for some violence and some suggested
sex (though nothing harsh whatsoever).  If this sounds too harsh for
your children, it really isn't.  The audience I attended the film with
seemed overwhelmingly pleased, especially little kids.  Even adults
cheered the film's intelligence.  If the Oscars do award this film
with another Best Picture Oscar, I wouldn't be disappointed in the
slightest.  While it's not quite up to par with the original, it
certainly pleases those looking for an entertaining time at the
movies.  I'm pretty sure that this film will end up on my top ten list
at the end of the year.</P>
