<P>Traditionally, the last few weeks of summer trigger the release of an 
avalanche of weak films from the major studios, as the powers that be 
desperately try to squeeze whatever money they can from moviegoers still 
hungry for air-conditioned diversion. While most of these leftovers lack 
ideas or a distinctive point of view, "Why Do Fools Fall In Love" suffers 
from the opposite problem. Presenting the biography of singer Frankie 
Lymon, writer Tina Andrews and director Gregory Nava juggle too many 
ideas and points of view, resulting in a film that, while sporadically 
entertaining, mostly serves as a frustrating example of disjointed 
storytelling and missed opportunities.</P>
<P>The film prominently features a court battle between three women over the 
estate of Lymon, their late husband. Beneath that elaborate framing 
device lies your basic rags-to-riches-to-disaster pop music tale. Frankie 
Lymon and the Teenagers hit the big-time in the late '50s with the film's 
title song, a catchy doo-wop number which remains a staple of oldies 
stations. Lymon became a star and went solo, falling into a life of 
womanizing and drugs, leading towards the inevitable downfall. </P>
<P>We've seen variations of this story before (in "The Buddy Holly Story," 
"La Bamba" and "The Doors," to name just a few), but Lymon's situation 
contains relatively fresh thematic potential. The phenomenon of rock and 
roll was manufactured by white businessmen by stealing rhythm and blues 
from the people who created it. For years, they made stars of white 
singers covering songs originally written and performed by black artists. 
When black performers were finally allowed to take their place in the 
mainstream spotlight, it was only under the rigid control of white 
management. </P>
<P>Lymon was one of many artists marginalized due to race. Having achieved 
fame against the odds, he then found his star fading as the '60s British 
Invasion hit, making all other forms of music passé. Once again, young 
white kids ruled the charts with sounds derived from black musicians. 
"Why Do Fools Fall In Love" becomes quite interesting when examining this 
theme. Indeed, one of the film's most poignant scenes comes on the stage 
of the pop music show "Hullabaloo," as Lymon stands in the wings, staring 
in astonishment as The Kinks perform before a screaming crowd, while he 
waits to appear as an "oldies" act.</P>
<P>Lymon's attempts to maintain a career in an entertainment world where 
race and rapidly changing musical tastes work against him makes 
compelling viewing, but the production only devotes a few minutes to that.
 Director Nava is so busy navigating through the film's convoluted 
structure that he fails to deal with the issues raised by the story. The 
women's court battle should have been a mere framing device, but instead 
it takes over the film. In the height of irony, Frankie Lymon becomes a 
marginal figure in his own biography. </P>
<P>Over the course of its 117 minutes, "Why Do Fools Fall In Love" tries to 
be several different movies. It's a man-bashing, female bonding flick as 
the three ex-wives discuss Lymon's flaws. It's a glossy bio-pic using 
spinning newspapers to flash headlines as it shows Lymon's meteoric climb 
to stardom in a dreamy retro-world. It's a melodramatic soap opera, 
showing the singer's abusive behavior as drugs swallow his being. It's a 
sassy courtroom comedy, with judge Pamela Reed allowing ex-wives Halle 
Berry, Vivica A. Fox and Lela Rochon to act more like guests on "The 
Jerry Springer Show" than plaintiffs in a court case.</P>
<P>Mostly, it's a superficial mish-mash of styles and tones that frequently 
entertains, but never fully satisfies. The songs are good and Larenz Tate 
gives an energetic performance as Lymon. There are a number of effective 
scenes, and it's a treat watching Little Richard play himself on the 
witness stand in a memorable cameo, testifying in both the legal and 
evangelical sense of the word. What a shame that age prevented him from 
playing himself throughout the film, because the actor portraying Little 
Richard as a young man is terrible (an actor imitating Redd Foxx and 
stand-ins for The Kinks are even less convincing).</P>
<P>Structural problems and bad impressionists aside, the fatal flaw is in 
the framing story itself. By focusing on the ex-wives instead of Lymon, 
viewers are asked to become emotionally involved with three characters 
squabbling over a dead man's money. As the film progresses and the women 
turn increasingly mercenary, sympathizing with their plight becomes 
extremely difficult. It's like being led outside to see a horse, then 
being presented with its carcass and urged to cheer for the vultures 
circling overhead.</P>
<P>At the end of the film, a picture of the real Frankie Lymon appears 
onscreen and I was struck by two things. First, he looked much younger 
than the actor who played him and second, after watching a film 
purportedly devoted to his memory, Frankie Lymon remained a stranger, 
just another rock and roll casualty, even in his own movie. </P>
