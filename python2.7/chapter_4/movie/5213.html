<P>When a movie is a lot like life, it can be startling and thought 
provoking or just plain dull. "A Family Thing" has moments of both.</P>
<P>Robert Duvall stars as Earl, the good old boy owner of an auto shop 
in Smalltown, Arkansas, with a neck as red as a home grown tomato. 
His mother's deathbed revelation to him is that he's really the half 
black by product of her husband's rape of the family cleaning lady. 
Not the kind of news that's going to get you elected Grand Poobah of 
the local Elks lodge in the deep south.</P>
<P>Obediently, Earl cusses out his Daddy, then honors his mother's last 
wishes and sets out for Chicago to meet and put a face to his half 
brother Ray, marvelously played by James Earl Jones. The two men 
dislike each other instantly, but a funny thing happens. It's clear 
that if the pair had been 30 years younger, they would've gone at 
each other until only one was left standing. But Earl is 63 and Ray 
is 69. Try as they might to maintain the hatred that history
and culture should have fostered between them, they just can't. Age 
and maturity have ravaged their once rampant testosterone, and shown 
that life is a lot better handled as grownups. </P>
<P>One very funny scene does show the two trying to get into a fist 
fight, and ending up rolling over each other and bursting into 
laughter. Oh that every living human being who harbors
anger and hatred against a ridiculous stereotype could have this 
experience! The two form a bond - albeit, a somewhat uneasy one - 
and set out to discover what the new meaning of family might just 
be.</P>
<P>See what I mean? Not a high concept adrenaline rush of a plot, but a 
gentle, matter-of-fact story about how life really is. Parts of it 
were conducive to nodding off. Any part that contained the salty 
Aunt T. (played by the earthy and wonderful Irma P. Hall) was
hilariously funny. </P>
<P>Mostly, "A Family Thing" was just a simple, reassuring story that 
after all is said and done, the bitterness of life's troubles just 
ain't that big of a deal.</P>
