<P>starring Max Schreck, Gustav von Wangenheim, Greta Schroder, John Gottowt
written by Henrik Galeen
directed by F.W. Murnau</P>
<P>Available in an all new video edition from Arrow Entertainment
($29.95), with an introduction by David Carradine, written &
produced by Wayne J. Keeley</P>
<P>F. W. Murnau's career ended sadly and prematurely. The German director
of such classics as "Sunrise" and "The Last Laugh"
died in a car accident shortly after signing a deal to make American
pictures at Paramount. Murnau was reportedly a giant man,
well over six feet, a towering figure probably incapable of anything
but a grand entrance. Which brings us to "Nosferatu: A
Symphony of Horror": surely he felt a kinship with his title
character, the looming vampire embodied by intimidating Max
Schreck; in one of the most indelible images in film history, silent
or otherwise, Schreck rises from his grave, gnarled hands
outstretched, and he's so big that part of his head is cropped by the
top of the frame.</P>
<P>The plot of "Nosferatu..." is lifted--unauthorized--from Bram Stoker's
"Dracula". The British Hutter is an eager real estate man
assigned to visit and discuss future living arrangements with Count
Orlock of Transylvania. He leaves behind girlfriend Emily,
only to discover Orlock's secret--he's a bloodsucker--and struggle to
return to England before the nosferatu reaches his lady
love. In addition to Schreck's performance, the cinematography and
effects are outstanding.</P>
<P>Arrow Video's digitally remastered version of the classic is something
of a mixed-coffin. The cover art features a red-tinted,
hairy, goateed vampire staring straight at you, his fanged mouth
agape, while the bodies of two sexy, writhing women entice you
below. Trouble is, Murnau's monster is pale-faced, bald, pointy-eared,
and non-goateed, and there isn't a single sexy, writhing
woman to be found in his movie. This sort of misleading packaging
makes little sense when one recalls the countless number of
ghouslish scenes in the film from which cool cover art could have been
extracted. Additionally, notifying the viewer that this is in
fact Murnau's film seems like afterthought since his name and the
genuine title are written in small print below our goateed
vampire.</P>
<P>That said, a good mastering job has been performed on the film itself.
The original elements are not in the best
condition--non-studio silents were unlucky in their preservation-- so
we're still dealing with a slightly washed out, scratched,
jittering image. But at least the day and night scenes are tinted
sepia and blue, respectively, especially helpful to an audience who
may question Nosferatu's waltzing around during what seems like
sunlight (it took a lot of light to expose stock in the twenties).
The title cards have been redone, and they are legible, accurate, and
digitally altered to flicker--a very nice touch. (Even the
opening copyright warning flickers!) The score has been replaced by
music from Type O Negative, a hard-rock group,
arguably gothic, and their songs underscore the film nicely--
certainly the coolest video a band can ask for. When our
hero, Hutter, first steps onto the doomed carriage to Count Orlock's
castle, we hear a well-timed "Now you're dead!" from
lead singer Peter Steele.</P>
<P>David Carradine makes an appropriately vampiric host; he fiddles with
a blade and cane while introducing the film. After the
feature, which runs about 63 minutes, is included a new music video
from Type O Negative, the black-and-white fang-fest
"Black No. 1". Of course, "Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror" is the
main attraction, and while my latest viewing raised
questions (Why is the woman called Emily in the title cards but
"Mina"--as Bram Stoker called her--in Hutter's letters?, for
instance), it made me realize how much this movie has inspired and
been stolen from. Coppola's 1992 "Bram Stoker's Dracula"
owes a great stylistic debt to Murnau's masterpiece, but the one thing
it couldn't thieve was the original's abstract charms. This
latest incarnation from Arrow will probably- -like the rescored
"Metropolis" a few years back--turn a silent film into more
palpable entertainment for the latest generation of film freaks.</P>
