<PRE>SMALL SOLDIERS
A film review by Andrew Hicks
Copyright 1998 Andrew Hicks</PRE>
<PRE>(1998) ** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        There are some movies marketed toward kids that I watch 
and think, "Boy, that would have scared the crap out of me when I was 
six." This Joe Dante film is one of those. He made GREMLINS, which 
was one of my favorite movies as a kid, that featured a lot of 
cartoonish violence and mayhem. SMALL SOLDIERS features a lot more of 
the same, but with a weird mix of minimum believability and 
maximum plot convention and twisted violence. How many other 
movies can you see a toy soldier shoot several corn cob holders into a 
kid's leg?</P>
<P>        Many of the scenes in SMALL SOLDIERS are the kind of thing 
you shouldn't push off as kids entertainment. The toys in this movie 
machine gun nails at people, make bombs out of household chemicals, 
lust after Barbie dolls and tie up small children, not to mention an 
adolescent protagonist who climbs a giant telephone pole and sticks a 
metal object between the transformers. For older kids, though, there's a 
lot to laugh at, both intentional and unintentional. The sick fantasy 
violence of killer toys would work as a horror movie for an older 
crowd, but it's too harsh to mix with the sickening sweetness that 
Dante throws at us. It doesn't take a rich Hollywood executive to see a 
bastard offspring of TOY STORY and CHILD'S PLAY isn't a brilliant idea.</P>
<P>        It's an interesting premise, though. A toy company is bought 
out by a huge conglomerate, and the CEO (Denis Leary as Denis 
Leary) demands "toys that actually do what they do in the 
commercials." That means toys that bust out of their packaging, have 
artificial intelligence and wage war with their toy enemies. Faced with 
these demands, the designers (David Cross and Jay "I Think I Just 
Sold Out" Mohr) power their soldiers with a surplus military 
intelligence chip. Gee, that's not going to backfire on them, is it?</P>
<P>        Meanwhile, there's that androgynous dork of an early 
teenager who always serves as the lead in movies like these. Here it's 
Gregory Smith as Alan, a so-called troublemaker who would actually 
get beaten up for his lunch money in real life. No such luck in the 
movies, where he manages to steal ex-vampire girl Kirsten Dunst 
away from her older jock boyfriend. We know the boyfriend is a pussy 
because he drives a motor scooter, and this opinion is corroborated 
later when he runs away from the small soldiers in his boxers.</P>
<P>        Alan's dad owns a small toy store that stocks goody-goody 
toys, not those fighting action figures that give kids bad role models. 
But when Dad goes out of town, Alan manages to talk the toy delivery 
guy (played by Mr. Futterman from GREMLINS, one of many inside jokes 
Dante includes -- Cross' password is "Gizmo") into giving him a few 
boxes of the new toys headed to a large chain store. The toys are 
divided into the Commando Elite and the Gorgonites, the former a 
war-loving bunch headed by the voice of Tommy Lee Jones and the 
latter a peaceful people. Both sets are programmed to be enemies, and 
the war begins shortly after Alan opens the shipment and leaves the 
store.</P>
<P>        SMALL SOLDIERS has the plot elements you'd expect -- underdog 
Alan attracts Kirsten without question, Phil Hartman is a one-note jerk 
who is later proven wrong and no one believes Alan when he tries to 
explain away damage to his house and his dad's shop. Strangely, 
though, no one seems that much surprised to see themselves under 
seige by a bunch of toys. During the climactic final battle, when an 
army of toys surrounds a house, none of the neighbors think to alert 
the police to the noise of gunfire and explosions. The continued 
implausibility and the fact that the movie is too horrific for children 
and too juvenile for adults keeps SMALL SOLDIERS from living up to its 
claim of being a "big movie."</P>
