<P>Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines - the summer
blockbuster season has begun!</P>
<P>And, begun with a bang and a flourish and big gust of wind,
courtesy of the team of Stephen Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy
and Michael Crichton.  Been a while since a movie has made
me sweat, but I walked out of "Twister" with sore muscles
from clenching the armrests, and some unsightly stains on
the underarms of my sweatshirt.</P>
<P>I've heard it said that the special effects are the stars
of this movie.  No question but what they are spectacular,
and a large part of the reason for the nail biting
suspense.   But a lot of the credit for the intensity of
this film has to go to Helen Hunt.  Willing to ride right
into the eye of the storm, it's her intensity, bravery and
ability to look life square in the face that takes you
places a movie doesn't normally go.</P>
<P>Usually, if a woman is a hero in an action film, she's an
Amazon.  Grace Jones comes to mind - a not quite human
woman, and therefore a cinematically acceptable hero.  Hunt
has none of that.  You learn at the beginning that she's
motivated to be a storm chaser because of seeing her father
swept out of the family storm cellar during a tornado in
the mid-60s.   She's got a core of sadness, but she's
driven and focused and passionate about her work.  Now
that's a reasonable motivation.</P>
<P>Her mission is to lead a motley band of other scientists to
make the first tornado sensor designed to be sucked up into
the funnel for precise data gathering.   The rest of her
team, are guys, who seem to have not one ounce of angst
about working for a woman.   It's clear that they'd rather
be working for her than for the well funded, souless male
competitor who's vans all match and who hogs all of the TV
cameras in his efforts to beat her to the punch.  I don't
blame them.  I liked her.  They obviously do too.  No big
deal.</P>
<P>Enter the sub plot of the fact that she co-invented this
wonder device with her soon to be ex-husband, the highly
appealing Bill Paxton.  He comes to get her to sign the
divorce papers and stays to help her launch the sensor. 
Paxton is equally - and I truly mean equally - as strong a
character.  It's clear why they a) really love each other
and b) have a tough time living together.  Two people who
are this smart and this dedicated have to run into power
struggles.</P>
<P>But the struggles are real.  They aren't some trumped up
guys versus gals type of thing that has to end in the woman
capitulating to the man's sensitive ego.  They're the
struggles of two human beings trying to figure out where
they each belong in life and caring so much about each
other that confronting their lack of ability to work it out
hurts way more than just separating.</P>
<P>Here's a switch - what causes this to work is Hunt's
combination of brains and fearlessness and Paxton's
instincts.   Thanks to Spielberg and his camp for giving us
a female hero with brains and a male hero with intuition. 
And for making that part of the movie no big deal, just
part of a really good story.</P>
<P>It's well written, (mostly) and well acted, by folks it's
very easy to care about.  See this movie for a fabulous
story about people with heart achieving the impossible and
winding up winners.</P>
