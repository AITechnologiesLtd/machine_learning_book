<P>     I say this as a longtime fan of Barenaked Ladies, someone who was
listening to their music years before they became an arena act: There was
no good reason for Jason Priestley to make a documentary about the band,
at least not the documentary he made. BARENAKED IN AMERICA is
actor-turned-auteur Priestley's open fan letter to his countrymen, the
Toronto quintet that hit big Stateside in 1998 with the multi-platinum
album "Stunt" and its #1 nonsense-rap single "One Week." The film follows
the band -- guitarist/vocalist Ed Robertson, vocalist Steve Page, drummer
Tyler Steward, bassist Jim Creggan and keyboardist Chris Brown -- on their
first U.S. tour after becoming big-time headliners. They're coping with
the absence of regular keyboardist Kevin Hearn, who is undergoing
treatment for leukemia, but mostly they are shown handling their nascent
fame with grins and self-effacing humor.</P>
<P>     That, unfortunately, is what prevents BARENAKED IN AMERICA from being
a particularly interesting film experience. The Ladies are presented by
Priestley as a group of nice, intelligent guys having loads of fun
entertaining their fans, almost completely unfazed by their sudden
notoriety in America. Great stuff for a People magazine profile; not so
much for a feature documentary. Chalk it up to bad luck, perhaps, but the
time frame for Priestley's profile is all wrong. As the film begins, "One
Week" has already become a hit, Hearn has already been diagnosed and the
high-profile tour is already underway. Start the story a few months
earlier, and you may have something: A hard-working bunch of decent guys
swooping back and forth between the highest highs and the lowest lows. As
it actually unfolds, BARENAKED IN AMERICA is utterly bereft of drama.</P>
<P>     Which is not to say that it's utterly bereft of entertainment. Even
viewers who are not BNL devotees will find it hard to deny the energetic
appeal of their stage shows, which turn into rowdy audience-participation
improvisations. The performance footage includes old and new song 
favorites, as well as the ad-lib raps composed by Page and Robertson while
their bandmates try to lay down an accompanying rhythm behind them. Few
popular music acts of the day would make better subjects for a
straight-ahead concert film; the Ladies, as their manager notes in an
interview, are pure entertainers whose shows are singular experiences. </P>
<P>     Unfortunately, BARENAKED IN AMERICA isn't a straight-ahead concert
film. It's not really clear exactly what Priestley wants it to be, in
fact. There are token bits of archival footage, but not enough to provide
a sense of where the Ladies came from. There are moments of backstage and
person-on-the-street cavorting, but not enough to make the film a showcase
for the band members' off-stage charm. And there are token glimpses of the
easy-going fellows putting their feet down on business decisions (like
their dissatisfaction with a video for their follow-up single "It's All
Been Done"), but they feel completely incongruous with most of the film
pitched lighter than air.</P>
<P>     Occasionally Priestley takes an off-beat angle, like letting both
fans and detractors of the band speak their minds after hearing BNL
music. Far more often, he simply turns on his camera like a buddy of the
band making a home movie. These guys were never going to yield a SPINAL
TAP-like story of internal meltdown and rampant ego; it would have taken a
much more skilled documentarian and a much more precise time frame to make
a Barenaked Ladies film soar. The band itself deserves the attention,
because talented pop musicians and songwriters with a zeal for showmanship
are in too short supply to dismiss them as a novelty act. If anything
positive comes from BARENAKED IN AMERICA, it might be encouraging more
people to know the band from its live shows. That's the Barenaked 
experience that should be recorded for posterity.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 bare un-necessaries:  5.</PRE>
