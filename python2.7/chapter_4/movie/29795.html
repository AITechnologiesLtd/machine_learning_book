<P>THE THEORY:
Is it just me or does there seem to be a very distinct pattern to all of these
ex-Saturday Night Live comedians' movies? Let's break it down. They usually use
the name of the main character (the ex-Saturday Night Liver himself) as the
title of the film in two words. Check! They usually star a very dumb character,
who is clumsy, stupid or naïve (or all three) but has a big heart. Check! They
usually don't last more than 90 minutes. Check! They usually feature a total
babe (a no-name) as the co-star, a woman who under any other circumstance (this
being a Hollywood movie production) wouldn't cross the street to spit on the
star of each film, for whom she inevitably falls in love. Check! They are
usually produced by a man named Robert Simonds. Check! They usually have a
cameo, or small role, from a once "high-profile" older guy. Check! They usually
feature the main character in a "fish out of water" plotline. Check! They
usually have the lead come to some kind of understanding near the end, and take
part in an "emotional" scene. Check! Okay, okay...I think we get the picture.
The folks behind these movies aren't exactly driving the originality boat in
Hollywood, but I guess they have recognized some kind of niche in the
marketplace and are ready to jam it full of movies like CORKY ROMANO, BILLY
MADISON, JOE DIRT, HAPPY GILMORE and DEUCE BIGALOW, and hope to reap the
rewards.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Corky Romano's family is in the mob. Corky Romano is an assistant veterinarian
and doesn't speak to his family anymore. But now that Pops Romano is about to be
indicted on racketeering charges, the family needs a "nobody" to go undercover
in the FBI and steal their evidence on Pops. Naturally, they call on their goofy
relative Corky, to help them achieve their goal. Wackiness ensues?</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Humor is a very subjective thing. Even more so, movies based on "stupid humor",
which is the type of "funny" that this kind of flick is going for, is even more
subjective, and usually dependent on your mood and your appreciation for the
film's lead actor. In my case tonight, I was looking for some cheap laughs, I
really like Chris Kattan (his fruity smile alone cracks me up) and I got enough
guffaws out of this movie to recommend it to anyone looking for something very
simple, very stupid and pretty funny, for the most part. The movie is basically
Kattan. If you like his goofy characters, over-the-top gesticulations and
idiotic demeanor, you will likely come out of this film with many laughs
registered in your belly. I dug his take on this goofball and especially
appreciated a few scenes in particular, one in which he sees a dead body for the
first time, another in which he faces some skinheads and another, where he is
high on coke. They really cracked me up. The rest of the film is filled with
some laughs every now and then, helped by Chris Penn and Peter Berg, who played
the brothers really well, and I want to especially thank the men behind this
film for once again choosing an extra-sweet babe to star alongside the
big-headed Kattan. Vinessa Shaw, I'm not sure where you've come from, or if
you're actually the brunette sister of BILLY MADISON's own Bridgette Wilson, but
thank you for wearing that sexy nurse's uniform for a good part of the movie.
You've made my night that much easier to download. </P>
<P>The plotline of this film obviously does not have much of a stranglehold on its
goings-on, but it was surprisingly passable. It did falter a little near the
end, when they made things a little "too easy" on everyone (and that whole Night
Vulture thing wasn't needed), and even went for a tear (what the hell?). See my
SNL-movie theory at the top of this review for more on that. But on the whole,
the story was obviously only there to serve the various "sketch" pieces set up
for Kattan's humor, and you either think they're stupid and funny or stupid and
unfunny. I thought the film was pretty funny for the most part, but noticed that
the biggest laughs came from the moments in which Kattan was given his space to
do "his thing". I didn't laugh when there were big set pieces like when he was
caught on the hood of the car, or when his head was placed in a shaker machine,
and definitely not when the midget kicked him in the head a la MATRIX/CHARLIE'S
ANGELS (guys...please, let's form a committee and stop with the completely
unoriginal MATRIX parodies already!). But most of the time, I laughed just
looking at dumb Corky's face and you gotta give out some massive props to Kattan
for that (whether the movie works or not, the poor bastard goes "all out"
here!). He also had an amazing nemesis on the FBI, who has his own moment to
shine as well (the guy's name is Brick Davis and the scene in which he cracks up
is hilarious!).</P>
<P>All in all, the movie does deliver the basics as described in my SNL-movie
theory above, tosses in the obligatory gay, fart, drug and retard jokes, and I
don't think that anyone should go into this movie expecting much else than that.
Basically, if you dig Kattan and his skits on SNL, you will likely enjoy this
movie. If you don't like Kattan or his skits on SNL, don't bother seeing this
movie and that'll be that. I think I offered the same advice to Tom Green
fans/non-fans for FREDDY GOT FINGERED and it just seems to make sense. </P>
