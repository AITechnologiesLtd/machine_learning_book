<P>     Dawn Wiener (Heather Matarazzo), an 11-year-old resident of suburban
New Jersey, is a typical seventh grader, which is to say that she's
miserable.  Actually, she may be more typical, which is to say more
miserable.  Saddled with intelligence, less than spectacular looks and a
cruelly unfortunate name, Dawn lives in a daily hell in which finding a
safe place to sit in the cafeteria is an ordeal and a good day is one in
which she isn't called "Wienerdog" or "lesbo."  Tortured at school and
ignored at home, Dawn is the kind of character which in a more mainstream
movie would find some inner reserve of strength or discover a heretofore
unknown talent, and become loved and respected by all.  Well, WELCOME TO
THE DOLLHOUSE, Todd Solondz's brutally funny portrait of the nightmare
that is adolescence.</P>
<P>     It should be made perfectly clear that WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE is
not, in that favored film terminology, a "coming-of-age" story.  No one
becomes an adult at 11, and while Solondz features such rites of passage
as Dawn's first big crush and first kiss, she learns no great truths about
life.  No, WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE is about a much more basic truth --
that there is no more unpleasant time in a human life than the middle
school years.</P>
<P>     WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE is an episodic story which follows Dawn
through several weeks of her seventh-grade year, and some of those
episodes are so perfectly handled that they are painful to watch.  When
Dawn is forced by a teacher to read an essay on "The Importance of
Dignity" in front of the class, she reads quickly and almost silently,
wanting nothing more than for the moment to be over and to shrink into the
walls.  In a later scene, Dawn plays piano for the object of her desire,
her brother's garage band-mate Steve (Eric Mabius), and practically glows
when he pays her an off-handed compliment.  It is surprising that Solondz
has captured the world of a young girl with such detail, but he is dealing
with a time where the horrors of unpopularity are very similar between the
genders, and where knowledge about sex is still too abstract to make the
psychology of adolescence completely different.  Dawn is a girl, but she
didn't have to be.</P>
<P>     The fact that she _is_ a girl simply allowed Heather Matarazzo to
nail the part with a startling willingness to look completely homely, and
to be less than heroic.  One of the things which makes Dawn such a
convincing character is that she is no less vicious than the classmates
who tease her; she simply doesn't have the power over them that they have
over her.  When she finds someone over whom she _does_ have power, like
her younger sister Missy (a distressingly adorable child perpetually
wearing her pink ballet outfit and prancing about, played by Daria
Kalinina) or wimpy playmate Troy (Scott Coogan), Dawn lashes out at them
in exactly the same language with which she herself has been victimized.
Solondz realizes that the essence of this time between childhood and
adulthood is status, established through threat, insult, appearance and
conformity.  Dawn is petty and vindictive, and given the opportunity, it
is clear that she would treat other classmates the way she is being
treated.  The magic of Matarazzo's performance is that we feel for her not
because she is better than those who torment her, but because her fate is
so familiar.</P>
<P>     When Solondz does stumble, it is because he tries to move beyond the
simple truths of Dawn's life to big-picture issues, or to give his story
an artificial sense of resolution.  A school bully (Brendan Sexton Jr.)
with whom Dawn develops a strange friendship is given a bad home life to
explain his behavior, and the plot takes an implausible turn as Dawn goes
on a quest in New York.  Some of the surreal comic moments (like Dawn
nearly blinding a teacher with a spitball) are funny, but they pull us
away from the everyday horrors of Dawn's life, which are funny only with
the remove of years.  The old saying that comedy is simply tragedy plus
time is most certainly true when it comes to adolescence, and WELCOME TO
THE DOLLHOUSE is a winning portrait of the only story that matters when
you are eleven years old and different:  getting out alive.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 living dolls:  9.</PRE>
