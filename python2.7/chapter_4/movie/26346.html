<P> Remember the Titalns (2000) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Denzel
Washington, Will Patton, Wood Harris and  Ryan Hurst. Written by Gregory
Allen Howard. Directed by Boaz Yakin.</P>
<P> Any football coach with a lick of smarts should take his team - en
masse - to see "Remember the Titans."</P>
<P> Not because it is a great movie -  it is very good, despite its usual
quota of sports clichés - but because it is a film that amply displays
how a team is forged and how the concept of team can overcome even the
most hardened social structures and ideologies.</P>
<P> Alexandria, Va., 1971. The last vestiges of segregation are dying as
the school district is finally integrated.
At T.C. Williams High School football coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton) has
a new assistant coach, Herman Boone (Denzel Washington), a black man
with years of coaching experience in South Carolina.</P>
<P> Later, in a political move to appease the black community, Yoast is
demoted and Boone is named head coach, but with a codicil: His team
cannot lose one game or he will be fired.</P>
<P> This situation causes tension and animosity not only among the coaching
staff, but among the players.
Boone, though, is determined to fight through these obstacles. He
surprises the black players by refusing to show them preferential
treatment. Nor will he brook any insubordination from the white players
or his assistant coaches.</P>
<P> His message is simple and direct: The only colors on the football field
are those on the Titan uniform.</P>
<P> He is first tested when his players board buses to ride to practice.
The white players get on one bus, blacks on another. Boone makes
everyone disembark and the buses are designated for offense and
defensive players, no matter what that player's color.</P>
<P> Washington creates a towering figure in Boone. He never allows his
guard to fall, always appearing in control, self-confident, unswaying,
single-minded and ferocious in his commitment to forge one cohesive unit
from his diverse group of young men.</P>
<P> And Washington accomplishes this feat without being flashy or showy. He
is steel, an uncompromising locomotive steaming over all who get in his
way, including his assistants.</P>
<P> Washington's Boone is a bully, a tyrant, driving his players to the
point where they focus all their thoughts on him, forgetting their
differences and uniting in self protection.
W
 orking uneasily at first Boone and Yoast mold these young men into a
dynamic, winning team, triumphing over the town's prejudice and the
intolerance of many of the people around them.</P>
<P> Patton's Yoast is a less flashy character than Washington's Boone. But
in his quiet way, he is as strong as Boone, seeing what the coach is
trying to accomplish and helping him along without calling attention to
himself.</P>
<P> Patton's performance is something that should be studied by acting
students. He serves the purpose of the supporting character, which is to
advance the story without hogging the spotlight from the film's nominal
star. In this Patton succeeds wonderfully, and he deserves a best
supporting actor Oscar nomination if not the statue itself for his
portrayal.</P>
<P> Two young actors also deserve recognition: Wood Harris as Julius
Campbell, leader of the black players, and Ryan Hurst as Gerry Bertier,
the Titans' captain. Like their elders these two begin their
relationship under a cloud of distrust and suspicion.</P>
<P> But they rise above their preconceived biases, forging an alliance that
puts team ahead of any personal glory.</P>
<P>  "Remember the Titans" is a moving, heartfelt drama. It is masterful,
packed with emotion and some humor. It is an inspiring movie that should
not be missed.</P>
