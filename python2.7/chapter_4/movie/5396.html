<PRE>                       JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO
                       A film review by Magus
                        Copyright 1996 Magus</PRE>
<PRE>Starring Tom Hanks & Meg Ryan</PRE>
<P>Joe Versus The Volcano is really one of the worse movies made in very recent 
memory.  The strangest thing is that you would think nothing would go wrong 
with it.  It has a solid cast with Tom Hanks & Meg Ryan as the lead roles.  
But you can never judge a movie by its cast...</P>
<P>If there is one good thing about Joe VS The Volcano, it is that the plot is 
original.  Unfortunately, it is also incredibly stupid.  The movie begins with 
Joe (Tom Hanks) going to work.  This opening sequence is very boring and slow. 
It shows Joe walking to his office.  But on the way, he has to wait in a long 
line passing by strange and slightly depressing scenery with obnoxious 
lighting.  A sequence like this should take 2 minutes.  Here, it takes over 
5...</P>
<P>It is obvious that Joe hates his job.  At his office, one of his co-workers is 
Meg Ryan.  Oddly enough, she plays 3 different roles in this movie!!  Joe 
leaves to go to a doctor's appointment.  His doctor informs him that he has a 
"brain cloud."  This means that in a few months, he will die.  So what does 
Joe do?  Quit his job, of course!!</P>
<P>When he arrives home, Joe meets an old man named Graynamore (Lloyd Bridges).  
Graynamore tells Joe that in order to get some important mineral for his 
company from an island, the natives need someone to sacrifice to their volcano 
to please their Fire God.  By a startling coincidence, the boat trip to the 
island takes a few months.  By the time he reaches the island, he will almost 
be dead from the "brain cloud" anyway, so Joe agrees.  </P>
<P>Graynamore gives Joe a credit card to buy everything he needs to go on this 
"great adventure".  Joe goes on a date with Meg Ryan, his co-worker.  The day 
before the boat trip, Joe meets one of Graynamore's daughters.  She is also, 
surprise, Meg Ryan.  Except she looks more hippyish.  They both have dinner 
and the next day, Joe gets driven over to his boat.</P>
<P>The lady that sails the boat is another one of Graynamore's daughters.  And, 
wonder of wonders, she is also played by Meg Ryan.  As they sail to the 
island, Meg Ryan tells Joe that the natives of the island have a craving for 
orange soda.  After some stupid talking scenes, they also deduce that 
Graynamore had his doctor be the one that Joe went to.  And that the "brain 
cloud" thing was made up!!</P>
<P>They do plently of cheap special effects on the boat voyage.  Joe goes fishing 
and catches a hammerhead shark.  This is a cheap gag that has been pulled off 
many times.  But, to top it off, the shark is obviously rubber and fake!!  One 
night there is a storm.  A cheap-looking lightning bolt strikes the boat and 
everything is cast overboard.  Fortunately, Joe and Meg Ryan manage to find 
some of the luggage that Joe brought to sail.</P>
<P>By pure luck, they get to the island.  Since the natives like orange soda 
, they wear soda cans as attire!!  Stupid or what?  ;)  Before Joe leaps in 
the volcano, he gets fed.  Right before he jumps, Meg Ryan pleads him not to.
When Joe decides to, she goes in with him because "she loves him".  Now this 
is where the movie should end.  But, unfortunately, the "cheesy ending" bug 
comes in.</P>
<P>The volcano blows the couple out and into the ocean where they land on Joe's 
luggage.  They float to another part of the island as they watch lava pouring 
out of the volcano towards the villagers.  I give this movie a * out of ****.  
See it only if you're a film buff that enjoys a bad movie every now and then 
or if you REALLY like Tom Hanks or Meg Ryan...</P>
