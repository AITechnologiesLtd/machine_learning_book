<P>   If this year's films about life in high school are all going to
be like "Jawbreaker" and "Varsity Blues," we're in for trouble. 
These are not bad or unwatchable movies, simply
mediocrities.  "Jawbreaker," about the kidnapping of a
beautiful, sweet high-school girl who accidentally dies of
asphyxiation, is meant to be a of the satiric, horror-comedy
genre, but satirizes nothing, is unfunny and has not a slasher
in sight. "Varsity Blues," which has a mishmash of floundering
themes, hasn't an original bone in its rib-crushing body. 
What's more even "Waterboy" is more believable.  Would you
believe, for example, that a high-school teacher in a small
Texas town would moonlight as a stripper in a nearby bar--
where, even if everyone under 21 were denied entrance,
surely the parents of the kids she teaches could be her
audience?  And can you accept the fact that a razzle-dazzle,
tough-as-nails guy whose statue overlooks the football field
can coach a small-town high-school team to twenty-two
annual division championships without being picked up by a
big-name college?  How about going with two separate
scenes involving the a trainer's illegal injecting of a pain-
killing substance into the knees of two seriously injured 
athletes while leaving the door ajar? (The massive rebellion
that climaxes the film could not have taken place had coach
Bud Kilmer simply turned the lock.)</P>
<P>   The major flaw of "Varsity Blues" is its lack of singularity. 
Like dozens of similar movies about young jocks and their
adoring women, Brian Robbins' saga, utilizing a script by
John Gatins and W. Peter Iliff, takes us inside a high school
West Canaan, Texas, where the town's entertainment is
drinking, girls and football.  Lance Harbor, the star
quarterback (played by the Brad Pitt-like Paul Walker) enjoys
the reverence of the citizenry, but his fame lasts only until he
is sidelined for good with a bruising knee injury.  His place is
taken by second-stringer John Moxon (played by the
charismatic James Van Der Beek of the TV show "Dawson's
Creek"), a scholarly, squeaky-clean fellow who has whiled
away his bench time reading Kurt Vonnegut.  The town's
reverence transfers to him instantly, including the
allegiance of Lance's girl friend Darcy (Ali Larter) while
he incurs the denunciation of his own sweetie-pie, Julie (Amy
Smart).  As Moxon smarts increasingly from the demands of
dictatorial, hell-raising, victory-obsessed Coach Bud Kilmer
(Jon Voight), he leads his team to a new realization of their
exploitation while gaining further insight into his very soul.</P>
<P>   "Varsity Blues" features some excellent slow-motion shots
of the fellows in action on the field, scenes which would
persuade any responsible adult to forbid his kid from
competitively playing The Great American Sport. Athletes
propel themselves against one another with the ferocity of a
missile launched against Baghdad while the fans sit safely in
the stands admiring the mini-skirted cheerleaders and
boosting the transcendent home team.  Jon Voight turns in
his usual performance as town villain, the sort of role that
propelled films like "Enemy of the State," "The Rainmaker"
and "Anaconda" to box office success in recent years.  It's
simply difficult to accept he's mentoring a mere team of 17-
and 18-year-olds, the way he curses and pummels them
when they are behind and especially when their hero, Moxon,
alters his instructions to set up plays of his own choosing. 
Kilmer brings to mind Nick Nolte's Colonel Tall of Terrence
Malick's "The Thin Red Line," with his utter disregard of the
well-being of the troops and his feeling that victory is
everything. The boys look more like college seniors or even
pro players than pimply adolescents, but perhaps that's the
way the macho Lone Star State turns 'em out.  </P>
