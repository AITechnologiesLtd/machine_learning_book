<P>Poorly written, badly acted, completely stupid, but never once boring, The
Fast and the Furious has accomplished more entertainment-wise than Driven or
Gone in 60 Seconds could ever fathom (and it did so with considerably less
money and virtually no star power).  Any film about a gaggle of car-racing
buffoons immediately starts out in the hole as far as I'm concerned, but
with the popularity of the NASCAR thing, it's likely we'll get more racing
pictures shoved down our throats for a few more years (until the inbreeding
wipes the fans out).  But if they're all as fun as Furious, I say bring 'em
on.</P>
<P>Furious is set in and around the street-racing district of Los Angeles and
begins with a nicely staged truck heist, in which three cars and a harpoon
gun are able to procure a ton of stereo and television equipment from an
18-wheeler.  The truck-jackings are happening with increasing regularity,
which catches the eye of local police and the FBI, who send a dreamy,
blond-haired, blue-eyed boy undercover into the world of muscle cars and
monkey wrenches.</P>
<P>The cop is Brian Spindler (Paul Walker, The Skulls), and although we don't
know he's a cop at first, anyone with minimal brain activity will be able to
figure it out.  Brian decides to infiltrate the inner circle of LA's racing
kingpin - one Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel, Pitch Black) - by sniffing around
the convenience store he runs with his younger sister, Mia (Jordana
Brewster, The Faculty), who seems to be receiving the majority of Brian's
sniffing. To show how painfully un-street Brian is, the script has him order
a tuna sandwich on white bread, with the crusts cut off, no less.  He also
lands a job at a high-end auto parts store in the racing district.</P>
<P>After a testosterone-bathed scene that depicts him earning his street cred
and the respect of Dominic, Brian is accepted into the in-crowd, which
includes, but is not limited to, characters played by October Sky's Chad
Lindberg, Get Carter's Johnny Strong and Girlfight's Michelle Rodriguez, the
latter of whom could probably kick the crap out of any of Furious' men.  The
scene also features a shot of Diesel running down the street at the speed of
a glacier.  Brian provides reports back to his boss (Silence of the Lambs'
dick-tucker Ted Levine) and an FBI suit (Thom Barry), neither of whom are
happy with the progress of the case.  But none of it seems to stop Brian
from flashing those blue eyes and pearly whites.  One might even get the
impression he's mildly retarded.</P>
<P>But the plot barely matters here.  It's all about the cars and the driving
scenes.  Heck, even the girls (even the unattractive ones, like Brewster)
have spoilers of their own.  Laugh, if you must, at the gearheads
inconspicuously traveling everywhere in packs of juiced cars.  It looks
cool, so it doesn't have to make sense. Come to think of it, I think that's
how we ended up with our President.</P>
<P>Diesel, who is a horrible actor but has somehow managed to land in three
underachieving films with decent buzz (like Boiler Room), logs in his
career-best at overacting (and that's quite an achievement).  Walker is eye
candy, and it looks like he could have been one of the sons on Home
Improvement, or maybe in one of the incarnations of Saved By the Bell, or,
at minimum, Mark-Paul Gosselaar's inevitable replacement on NYPD Blue for
the 2002/2003 season. Snow Falling on Cedars' Rick Yune plays The Bad Asian
Guy, and MTV tough-guy Ja Rule makes an appearance, too.  Yay!</P>
<P>Furious contains some of the worst dialogue ever written, and I'm saying
this less than two months after seeing Driven.  The highlight is Dominic's
elegant soliloquy, in which he bravely utters the line, "I live my life a
quarter-mile at a time."  Straight up, D?  That little gem, and all the
others, come courtesy of Gary Scott Thompson (Hollow Man), David Ayer
(U-571) and newcomer Erik Bergquist.  Furious was directed by Rob Cohen, who
recently directed Walker in The Skulls.</P>
<P>1:45 - PG-13 for violence, sexual content and language</P>
