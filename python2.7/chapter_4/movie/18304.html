<P>     Perspective is a curious matter.  Take the question of the Vietnam
War, for example.  The conventional wisdom runs that the United States
lost the conflict when troops were withdrawn before the fall of Saigon.
For those of you laboring under the misapprehension that that was the end
of the story, Tony Bui's THREE SEASONS shows us a modern-day Saigon in the
full bloom of capitalism; in the ideological long run, you might say the
war was won after all.  Sometimes, a thing is entirely how you look at it
rather than the thing itself.  Even in the mind, style can triumph over
substance.</P>
<P>     There is an abundance of style on display in THREE SEASONS, enough to
cloak its lapses in substance.  The narrative consists of four largely
independent stories of life in modern Saigon.  In one, a young woman named
Kien An (Nguyen Ngoc Hiep) goes to work at a lotus farm, and becomes
intrigued with the reasons behind the reclusiveness of her employer (Tran
Manh Cuong).  Another finds cyclo-cab driver Hai (Don Duong) becoming
infatuated with local prostitute Lan (Zoe Bui), and intent on serving as
her knight in shining armor.  The third involves a street urchin and
trinket seller named Woody (Nguyen Huu Duoc) on a quest for the suitcase
full of goods he lost in a bar.  Meanwhile, American Vietnam War veteran
James Hager (Harvey Keitel) searches for the daughter he left behind.</P>
<P>     Visually, THREE SEASONS is a remarkably assured piece of film-making,
using the contrasts of ancient, war-time and modern Vietnam to perfection.
In the picturesque countryside, delicate wooden bridges share the
landscape with neon advertising signs; in the city, the war's terrible
legacy has been turned into an opportunity for a theme bar (characters in
the film frequent the "Apocalypse Now Cafe").  Cinematographer Lisa
Rinzler captures flower-showered streets and lotus gardens with a warm
glow, helping make THREE SEASONS an often enchanting tone poem on the
conflicts inherent in introducing the contemporary into the conventional.</P>
<P>     As a narrative, it's considerably more inconsistent, as one might
expect from the multiple independent story-lines.  By far the most
effective is the tale of cyclo driver Hai, given the strongest emotional
and thematic pull by Don Duong's exceptional performance.  At its core his
is a tried-and-true hooker with a heart of gold story, yet something in
Duong's manner makes the cliche more resonant, his attempts to "save" Lan
more ennobling than predictable.  Each of the other tales has its moments,
but they come more sporadically.  Keitel's American perspective feels
particularly intrusive, almost like a sop to American audiences; what's
more, it adds a title-confounding fourth story to the three seasons.
Though THREE SEASONS rarely inspires seat-shifting, it's never as engaging
as it is when the focus is on Hai.</P>
<P>     Still, the stories do ultimately come together as tales of healing,
of reconciling Vietnam's troubled past with its challenging present and
future.  As the first American production shot in Vietnam since the war,
it's also an often-compelling cultural document.  There's little doubt
that THREE SEASONS feels somehow more "significant" because it is so
gracefully and beautifully composed, but that's hardly a cause for
consternation.  If it pushes plenty of the right aesthetic buttons, that
only proves that glamour can change one's perspective, as it clearly has
in a post-war Saigon where Coke adds life.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Saigon falls:  7.</PRE>
