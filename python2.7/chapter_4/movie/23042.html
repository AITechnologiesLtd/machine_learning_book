<P>When we meet Richard, the U.S.-born narrator-hero of The Beach, he has
succumbed to the idea that finding adventure necessitates getting the
hell out of his homeland... drinking snake's blood and sleeping with
roaches play pleasantly into his romantic notions of danger. As he roams
the steamy streets of Bangkok in search of the next
hedonistic-masochistic delight, Richard appears oblivious to the
American infiltration of Asian culture ("The Simpsons" episodes on TV,
the constant bubblegum music sounding from ghetto blasters, etc.). The
Beach is about how we as earthlings can't escape western civilization,
and the futility of trying.</P>
<P>Richard is kept awake one night in his hotel by the sounds of lovemaking
(his attractive neighbour, with whom he has become infatuated, is
getting some from her boyfriend) and by the Scottish-inflected ravings
of Daffy (Robert Carlyle), a mysterious rabble-rouser who tears away at
the mesh screen of Richard's window to offer the tourist drugs and
chit-chat. Daffy recounts the pleasures of a beach he once inhabited,
part of a sun-bleached mass as yet undefiled by tourists. The following
morning, Richard discovers the suicidal storyteller's corpse along with
a hand-drawn map to the secret isle, and he enlists an eager Etienne
(Canet) and Francoise (Ledoyen), the couple next door, to join him in
retracing Daffy's path to paradise.</P>
<P>Said mass, it turns out, is guarded by gun-toting farmers fiercely
protective of their cannibas crops-so much for smoking pot all day, one
of Richard's loftier ambitions. The ensuing chase climaxes with the
three travelers coming to the edge of a cliff and diving off, into a
blue lagoon-the entrance to the world of their dreams. Out of harm's
way, they discover a group of European expats living in harmony,
officially seduced by the beach's white resplendence. (These villagers
have a deal with the farmers above: no more trespassers, live in peace.)</P>
<P>English Sal (Swinton), the casually appointed matriarch of this
microcosm, is cursorily welcoming of Richard and his friends.
Plainspoken and bossy, she assigns chores and whatnot to her people that
will keep them thriving (Richard proves himself an expert fisherman);
Swinton, who gives the film's most vibrant performance, gets to the
ruthless core of Sal quickly-she could be playing a tiger, lording over
the forest. We get the feeling that The Beach will build to a
confrontation between Richard and Sal, because her eyes are always
surveying, with a mixture of lust and venom, his very American power to
influence.</P>
<P>Downtime, and there is an awful lot of it, is spent by Richard drinking
in the atmosphere (handsomely captured by Seven cinematographer Darius
Khondji) and pining for the taken Francoise. And why wouldn't he? She's
gorgeous-cloning experts would be wise to sample Virginie Ledoyen's DNA
(as well as DiCaprio's, for that matter). Sadly, there's no compelling
reason for them to stay attracted to one another after an inevitable
consummation occurs. They're not very interesting as individuals-Richard
is a stock backpacker and Francoise the adorable French innocent-but as
lovers, they're totally blank pages, stuck with the label of "couple"
because relationships based solely on casual sex don't exist in the
foreground of expensive movies.</P>
<P>The Beach is conventional in other respects; it settles down into
something vaguely formulaic the same way Boyle's biggest hit-to-date,
Trainspotting, does after a few mindbending mock-hallucinations. There
are trippy detours throughout, most memorably when Richard pictures
himself in a cheesy videogame (battling a tiger, natch), but for the
most part, The Beach treads structural ground that was first laid by
"Lord of the Flies" and "The Mosquito Coast". A sequence in which
Richard loses his mind could be snipped without recourse, and its
omission would mean one less encumbering cliché.</P>
<P>Fortunately, the film's ideology is separate from the aforementioned
jungle dramas (and their screen counterparts). Director Danny Boyle,
screenwriter John Hodge (adapting a book by twentysomething Alex
Garland), and producer Andrew MacDonald, recovering nicely from A Life
Less Ordinary, have decided that utopia and the western world need not,
or cannot, be mutually exclusive. It is understood, when Richard and Sal
travel to the mainland for provisions with a grocery list of personal
requests from the islanders (for toothbrushes, dish gloves, Game Boys,
etc.), that we survivors of the twentieth century are too dependent on
stuff, i.e. the comforts of home, to enjoy "paradise" as only nature
intended.</P>
<P>And while it is Richard who throws the beach's societal balance out of
whack, by dumbly holding the door open for dopehead tourists, the
filmmakers don't turn his arrival at Fort Sal into an Ugly American
scenario. Instead, Richard is an invigorating presence to those denizens
in need of reminding why this secluded lifestyle is the cat's meow. (The
character is too inoffensively drawn, but also competently portrayed by
DiCaprio.) The Beach's most insightful moment is a single shot of our
green planet as made up of microchips. United by technology, our globe
is shrinking; the tech revolution may seem suffocating, its
oft-forgotten goal is to liberate the human being from feeling anything
but free.</P>
