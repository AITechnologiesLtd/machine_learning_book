<PRE>         !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<P> It's been said, in a few reviews of Jacques Rivette's work, that he has a
serious admiration for the American musical film. Whether this is true or
not, may be of inconsequence to the fact that this film has some song and
dance routines in it, and that one can just about tell when they are going
to break into it .... well, we knew that in the Hollywood musicals, too, so
that's not a surprise.</P>
<P> But the difference here, may be how it is used. In most of the famed
Hollywood musicals, the world stops for the song, and then it continues
again. The way Jacques Rivette uses this is more subtle, and kind makes each
person and character have their own identification with the Hollywood
musical, by breaking into it when the situation brings it about. The next
question is, is this a musical? No. Then what is it?</P>
<P> A more subtle answer comes in the way that Jacques Rivette does his films,
and shows us his characters. Basically, these are people that have grown up
seeing Hollywood musicals on the telly, and their inspiration comes across
various times, for three of the women. The fourth one, is apparently too
worried about a song she likes, to be able to dance, although her moves in
her own bedroom, are totally dance like, and appear choreographed.</P>
<P> Story .... story .... a bit more difficult of a proposition. Basically this
is a day in the lives of four women, some of which connect, and some who
don't, but they all share a liking for musicals, and on occasion break into
singing. Even though, this appears rather mechanical like Hollywood
musicals, there are times, when the apparent intent, is not to sing and
dance, as we would expect, at all, but merely to go through the motions to
show that this is something that the character likes. If something like this
is the intent, this is a magnificent film for the actors. They get a chance
to live out their character;s fantasies and inspirations, which more often
than not have to be left behind to a set of words, or a minimal action. Here
they are shown. One could easily say that Ninon likes things that come to
the age of FAME, SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, and that Louise is a great fan of Gene
Kelly, but this might be to degrade the film of its own personality. The two
girls interpret many of their feelings through a song, or dance.</P>
<P> The odd thing, is that it takes nearly one third of the film for the first
dance sequence to break through, and it is Ninon, who has bumped into
someone she is beginning to like, even if he, at first, proves elusive and
not trustworthy. Their routine is actually very sensuous and they spend the
rest of the film looking for that spark through which to make their
relationship get a start. Louise, by comparison, is recovering from a coma
she has been in for several years, and though she does not exactly look
healthy ( awfully skinny and bony ), she appears to be improving through the
film, and it is in the end, when we really find that she is actually the
strongest of the characters, and can make decisions faster than the others.
She decides in one moment if her relationship to a pursuer is going to start
it is going to begin at that very point, when he has to tell her the whole
story surrounding her father's whatever, and then they will make love right
there on the spot. By contrast, Ninon, is moody and spacey, and too much
into her own dancing craze to lounge music. And Ida, is also moody, and
volatile, spending her time trying to find a song she heard many years
before, which a local singer appears to have done.</P>
<P> Acting. This whole film, like all Rivette endeavors, is nothing but acting,
at its best. It's really hard to fault anyone in the film, and the
continuity is actually impressive considering the film is so long, and that
all of a sudden, we are at the end. The women, have a very impressive sense
of self through out the film, and this adds to the movement of the film.
Nothing seems to be out of place, and the continuity does not waver from its
very own form. Which would seem to render it to be a very good film. It is.
But not for American audiences, who are used to fast moving films that have
no character depth at all. By contrast, then, this is a director that deals
strictly with character depth.</P>
<P> The only annoying thing about Jacques Rivette's work, is that the general
perception is that there is some sort of intellectual exercise in action,
some metaphysics, that the director is engaging in, which for the most part
is hogwash. There is no way, from an actor or director's point of view that
anyone can contrive a scale of order for the actor to deliver all the lines
and be perfect and clean all the time. No one would be able to afford those
kinds of endeavors, and the time it takes to make them. The film then, is a
result of magnificent studying by the actors, of each character's role in
their own world, much similar to how Mike Leigh works, something that is
very important to French Experimental Theatres, with the likes of Peter
Brook doing their thing in Paris. But this is not so much "studying" as it
is "doing", thus creating a physical environment for each character to work
in. As such, then, the result are characters that we can relate to, that do
not appear out of place, and disconnected with their world, even if they are
thinking... well, it helps that they think out loud, in so many ways, and
the director creates situations so none of the characters have to think by
themselves.. this is the chance they have to open up, and they do, even if
it is a song, or a dance.</P>
<P> Very nice film, although, sadly, if it were left to American audiences, it
would have long been buried by now. This director deserves recognition for
the magnificent work he does with actors, which is second to none.</P>
