<PRE>The Last Days 
A film review by Marty Mapes 
Copyright 1999 Marty Mapes </PRE>
<PRE>***1/2 (out of 4) </PRE>
<P>The sheer horrific audacity of the Nazi plan to exterminate the Jews of
Europe is almost incomprehensible. People may make documentaries about
it for another hundred years and still not understand the organized,
methodical hatred.</P>
<P>Five concentration camp survivors from the last days of World War II
tell their stories in THE LAST DAYS, the first documentary from Steven
Spielberg's Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation.</P>
<P>The five interviewees are linked by their Hungarian ancestry. As the
introduction explains, even as Germany started to lose the war, the
Nazis stepped up their extermination of the Jews in Europe. In 1944,
Hungary had the last big population of Jews within Germany's reach, and
they became the last target of Hitler's "final solution."</P>
<P>Each of the five tells his or her story. Their stories are intercut
chronologically, starting from normal life in pre-war Hungary. They
recall the Nazi invasion of Hungary, being sent to "work" camps and
their realization that they were actually in death camps.</P>
<P>They recall their horrible, precarious lives in Auschwitz and
Buchenwald; the deaths of their family and friends; their loss of hope.
Each recalls his or her unfathomable, eventual liberation. And finally,
THE LAST DAYS shows their cathartic, pained, modern-day return to their
old homes and the camps.</P>
<P>Needless to say, their stories are horrifying, amazing, and emotionally
draining. By themselves, the stories would be forceful testaments, but
by cutting them in parallel, their impact is multiplied by five.</P>
<P>THE LAST DAYS is a talking-heads style documentary -- it's mostly
pictures of people telling their stories, intercut with period
photographs and newsreel footage. In this kind of movie it's almost
impossible to get archival pictures from the same time and place being
discussed on-screen, but director James Moll made a better effort than
most at finding specific, or at least relevant, images to go with his
subjects' narration.</P>
<P>The liner notes (one of the many nice features of this DVD) indicate
that there is some never-before-seen historical footage in THE LAST
DAYS. It's not clear which scene it is. It could be one of two that I
hadn't seen before, both powerful. One is rare COLOR footage, shot by an
American, of piles of victims in cattle cars. There is something
jarring, something unsettling about seeing the pictures in color, when
so much of the footage from World War II is in black and white. Another
segment shows walking skeletons; survivors who are so starved that they
hardly look human anymore.  </P>
<P>There has been a glut of Holocaust movies and I was skeptical that a new
documentary would have anything new to say. But by focusing on Hungarian
Jews during the last days of the war, Moll told a specific part of the
story in a new way, in greater detail. And I'm glad he did because his
careful filmmaking stands up well compared to other movies on the same
subject.</P>
<P>The transfer to DVD is rich and beautiful. X-Mozilla-Status: 0009f words
for a Holocaust documentary, but some of the interviews take place in
Europe in late spring, when skies are blue and trees are green. Also,
the movie was shot on 35mm film (and not video!), so the richness and
detail are impeccable.</P>
<P>The DVD's features are plentiful and well-chosen. There is a theatrical
trailer for the movie, which is a great introduction to the subject
matter. There are about fifty still photos, both from the production
crew and from the private collections of the survivors. Also, the disc
has two complete versions of the movie (widescreen and full screen),
both on the same side.</P>
<P>One of the more interesting DVD features is an outtake segment for each
of the survivors (plus one for the crew). You'd think outtakes would be
inappropriate in a Holocaust documentary, but they're not bloopers.
Instead, they are solid, moving segments that were probably cut from the
film only for length. </P>
<P>One of them continues a confrontation that was only touched on lightly
in the film. Renee Firestone (one of the five) spoke on camera with Dr.
Hans Münch, a German doctor who ran the medical clinic at Auschwitz.
Firestone was aggressive, questioning the doctor about what his children
thought. The doctor was evasive and clearly uncomfortable. Another of
the outtakes showed Bill Basch saying a prayer for his dead friends at
Auschwitz. He ends his prayer by saying "... forgive me for surviving."</P>
<P>It's ambitious to shoot a documentary on 35mm film. It's ambitious to
make it on a subject that has saturated cable, television, and movies.
It's ambitious to make it 54 years after the events it covers. But THE
LAST DAYS handles all these potential obstacles very well.</P>
<P>It's only fitting that the DVD, with its wealth of interesting and
relevant features, would also be ambitious and successful.</P>
