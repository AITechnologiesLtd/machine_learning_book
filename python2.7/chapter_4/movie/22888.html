<PRE>Sleepy Hollow (6/10)</PRE>
<P>Washington Irving's story The Legend of Sleepy Hollow has been dusted
down and given the Tim Burton treatment. Burton excels in bewitching us
with bizarre, dark, yet light-hearted visions - Edward Scissorhands and
the Batman films (before the series was effectively ruined when Burton
gave up the helm) are wonderful movies, and the new Tim Burton movie was
a must-see. The story is set in 1799, in the village of Sleepy Hollow
near New York. A series of ghostly and gruesome murders has taken place
in the village and Ichabod Crane, a police constable from the big city,
is sent to investigate. Crane (played by Johnny Depp) soon finds that
there really are some otherworldly goings-on in the village and realises
that he might not succeed in his attempt to bring science and reason to
the investigation and debunk the villagers' spooky tales of the
butchering Headless Horseman.</P>
<P>The film is absolutely gorgeous to look at, the action sequences are
fine and the score shows Danny Elfman on top dramatically-whimsical
form, but unfortunately the movie fails owing to seriously ill-judged
screenplay and performances fundamental problems which no amount of
technical skill can overcome. The film is written by Andrew Kevin
Walker, who wrote Seven with its brilliantly novel construction, but the
source material here ties Walker down to an old-fashioned ghost story,
and in his attempt at producing authentic period dialogue, what we get
sounds horribly forced and unconvincing.</P>
<P>Johnny Depp is a fine actor, but his performance here is little more
than a reworking of his Edward Scissorhands, the similarity between the
roles highlighted when Ichabod wields various spiky investigative
gadgets. But what worked in Scissorhands strangely fails here. Perhaps
Burton's talent for malignant delight works best when it plays against a
contemporary background. Here it just seems a bit silly.</P>
<P>The murderous Headless Horseman is played, in the scenes before the
horseman loses his head, by Christopher Walken, but for the bulk of the
horseman's screen time, the headless figure is played by Ray Park. Park
played Darth Maul in Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace and as the
bonceless butcher he brings a savage grace to his frequent dismemberings
of Sleepy Hollow's inhabitants. Christina Ricci is usually worth
watching and has a knack for taking on interesting roles, such as her
parts in Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas and The Opposite of Sex. Here
she is completely wasted, and it hard to see anything in the script that
can have attracted her, so perhaps she let the attraction of working
with Burton and Depp get the better of her.</P>
<P>The whole film seems to be a homage to Hammer horror films. (The Hammer
connection is strengthened by the use of such fine British character
actors as Christopher Lee, Michael Gambon and Michael Gough.) Such films
can be fun to watch and I have fond memories of sneakily staying up late
to watch them on TV, but even their greatest fans would find it hard to
deny that they were melodramatic, overacted nonsense. In this regard,
Tim Burton's film has captured their essence all too well.</P>
<P>All in all, Sleepy Hollow is a big disappointment.</P>
