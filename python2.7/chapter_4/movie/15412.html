# [film] "Blade"
A Postview, copyright p-m agapow 1998</PRE>
<P>The eponymous hero (Wesley Snipes) is a half-vampire, which means that
he gets all the cool superpowers with none of the disadvantages. He also
gets a legitimate excuse to slot real vampires, including the sneering
Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) with muchos pyrotechnics and martial arts.
And a good thing too.</P>
<P>Think "Wesley Snipes", think "vampires", think "adapted from a comic".</P>
<P>Think "what's on in the theatre next door?"</P>
<P>But that would be a mistake because while "Blade" is a dumb action
flick, it's at least enjoyably and inoffensively dumb, with lots of
pretty lights and motion. The slim plot contains several colourful
vignettes. A vampire culture underlies modern society, split between the
old world corporate types (lead by professionally oily Udo Kier) and the
youthful hedonistic rebels (led by Dorff). (We know they're rebels
because they dress scruffily, listen to loud music and smoke. They're so
k3wl.) Quicker than you can say "deus ex machina" the rebels have staged
a coup, deciphered the previously undecipherable prophetic scrolls, and
get set to unleash major nastiness on the world. In between working out
with an Abdominizer, Blade acquires a new sidekick (thus signalling a
short lifespan for his old sidekick) and then kicks some butt. Fin.</P>
<P>But what does the film do right? First on the list are the surprisingly
adept action scenes. Fluidly choreographed and colourful, they bear
comparison to the kinetics of Hong Kong cinema. Snipes, ridiculously
buff and self-serious, is actually well suited to this genre. An actor
he isn't, but he is an impressive special effect. And while we're on
SFX, there are some nicely placed ones. Vampires shot with silver
bullets burn down to ashes in midstep. Staked vampires crumble to dust
before they hit the floor. It's a tasty if gory eye-fest. Actually the
direction of the whole film is quite eye-catching, with an elegant
selection of sped-up scenes and washed-out landscapes. Combined with
some catchy music and a few genuinely scary setpieces (especially the
opening scene in a vampire nightclub where a horde of vampires attack a
victim on a bloodsoaked dancefloor), and I think that director
Norrington (who has no track record of remark) may be a name to watch
out for.</P>
<P>There are a few missteps - there's little evidence of humour here, which
the more serious moments need, and as mentioned the plot borders on the
intangible. But it is a pretty and fun piece of trash. Rated as such,
it's [***/interesting] and better than a poke in the eye on the Sid and
Nancy scale.</P>
