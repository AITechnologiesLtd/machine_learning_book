<PRE>REMEMBER THE TITANS
-------------------</PRE>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>"Remember the Titans" is a quality Hollywood production that handles its
tale of the forced racial integration of a Virginia high school's football team
in too black and white a manner.  Indie director Boaz Yakin ("Fresh," "A
Price Above Rubies") gets good performances from his ensemble cast, but
balances his material so evenly that no surprises are forthcoming.</P>
<P>When Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) is overlooked for a coaching job in his 
native North Carolina because of his race, he takes a job in Alexandria,
ironically displacing the popular, winning Coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton, 
"Armageddon").  Boone convinces Yoast to remain as his defensive coach and 
their clashing styles become complementary, allowing the men to gradually 
become friends.  During boot camp, Boone nails his main objective - to create 
a team in spite of hostile racial tensions.  Predictably, screenwriter Gregory 
Allen Howard frames this interlude with bus trips where the attempts of a few 
to engage the rest in song are squelshed on the way but harmonious upon return.</P>
<P>Indeed, there's a ying for every yang in this script.  Boone's daughter is 
prissy and feminine while Yoast's is a nine year old football prodigy/tomboy.  
The seemingly most racist black, Julius (Wood Harris, "Above the Rim") and 
white, Gerry (Ryan Hurst, "Rules of Engagement") become the closest friends.  
A long haired Californian, nicknamed Sunshine (Kip Pardue) by his teammates,
represents both the hippy and gay cultures to add additional complications to 
the racial issues.  Boone is applauded outside his home by the black population
upon his arrival, then later by his white neighbors when he leads his team to
the regional championship.  Everything's just a little too pat, including the 
musical selections which represent the era ("Spirit in the Sky," "Spill the
Win," "Call on Me").  As in "The Replacements," the team gets a song and
dance number with "Ain't No Mountain High Enough."</P>
<P>The ensemble cast does its best to flesh out their cliched, symbolic characters.
Washington is solid as the unrelentingly tough Boone, although it's unlikely
his Oscar hopes will be satisfied with this role.  (Was his three a.m. team
march to the Gettysburg battlefield intended to remind the Academy of his
last win?)  Patton does subtle work as the widowed single dad, although his
constant strength of character doesn't allow for much in the way of change or
development.  Wood Harris moves from sullen and self reliant to warm and 
giving dependably while Hurst goes from redneck to social reformer with as
much believability as time allows.  Ethan Suplee ("American History X") is
the good-natured John Candy element with his automatic, Louisianna army brat
acceptance of his black teammates while Kip Pardue's presence 
strengthen's the 'people are all just people' theme with humor.  Good in 
smaller roles are Craig Kirkwood as 'The Rev,' Earl C. Poitier as 'Blue,'
and Ryan Gosling as Alan, the decent son of a pushy jock dad.  Hayden Panettiere
("Message in a Bottle") has the 'almost-too-precocious' quality of Hallie 
Eisenberg as Yoast's daughter Sheryl.</P>
<P>Camerwork by the usually terrific Philippe Rousselot ("A River Runs Through
It") is frequently too closely inside the action, obscuring a larger, more
fully focussed point of view from the audience.  The footbal action finally
becomes exciting for the final, state championship game.  The score by Trevor
Rubin ("Armageddon") is tritely obvious.</P>
<P>"Remember the Titans" scores with its cast and its occasional lapses into
freshness.  The newly integrated teammates shock at the bussing riots which
occur on the first day of school mirror our own disbelief of the memory.</P>
