<P>Disney's 35th feature-film foray into the world of cartoon animation
is set within the mythological world of the ancient Gods, in the
historical setting of Greece. </P>
<P>PLOT:
Greek God Zeus's son Hercules is kidnapped by a couple of incompetent
underlings of the evil Hades, accidentally placed down to Earth, and
brought up by some human beings. To recapture his God-hood, Hercules
must prove to his real father Zeus, that he can be a true hero. While
all of this goes on, the menacing Hades prepares to take over as the
ruler of the after-life.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Uninspired, semi-interesting, and sometimes funny cinematic attempt
by Disney to cash in on another marketable historical myth. This film
seemed destined for success, but didn't seem to fully hit all of the
right notes on its way to the concert. I thought that it basically
lacked the heart of THE LION KING (7.5/10), the humor of ALADDIN
(7.5/10), and the romance of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST (8/10). I was most
disappointed by the lack of realism in the "love" that ultimately
materialized between Hercules and the New York-accented Meg. I found
it to be quite weak.</P>
<P>The hero story line was nice, and cool to keep track of, but
ultimately the romance, the songs or the bad guy have to stick out for
a children's animated tale to fully succeed, and unfortunately for
Disney, this one contained no such stickout. Having said that, James
Woods did make an excellent bad guy voice for Hades, but the
character itself never seemed to be such a real threat to anyone but
himself (Word on the street is that Hades was originally scripted as a
slow, menacing character until James Woods auditioned for the role and
impressed the casting directors with his rapid-fire style. The script
was rewritten, but Woods ad-libbed many lines.)</P>
<P>The songs in the film were passable, but could someone please explain
the connection between the re-occurring Motown quintet in a film set
in ancient Greece? Another aspect of the film that didn't seem too
kosher in my opinion was Hercules' trainer in the film, Phil (DeVito),
who is generally supposed to be cute and adorable in films as such, but
stood as half-man, half-goat in this movie. Not your cutest character
ever invented by the Mickey-crew, that's for sure! </P>
<P>All in all, I would recommend this film to all kids (mind you, I
don't see this becoming a classic by any stretch of the imagination),
and some adults who are interested in viewing a quick (88 minutes),
harmless animated story about the Greek Gods, and some hip, quirky
one-liners from James Woods. If not, warm up those nachos, and go out
to rent any of the three Disney films that I suggested earlier.
You've got heart, humor and romance on the tab. Make your choice.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts: 
Danny DeVito stands 5"0, hails from New Jersey (hence the name of his
production company: Jersey Films), and has been married to the
infamous barmaid from the super-successful TV sitcom "Cheers", Rhea
Perlman since 1982.
Ron Clements and John Musker have also co-written and co-directed
ALADDIN (8/10), THE LITTLE MERMAID, and THE GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE.
During one scene in HERCULES, when Phil (DeVito) is hit by a
discarded painter's palette he cleans himself up using a lion's fur
that bears a striking resemblance to Scar from THE LION KING (7.5/10).<HR>Visit JoBlo's Movie Emporium
