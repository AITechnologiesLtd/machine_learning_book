<P>_Felicia's_Journey_ (PG-13) *** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>Every year, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences always seems
to go out of its way to ignore some of the most extraordinary acting
performances of the year.  Likely to earn the dubious distinction of a
snub is Bob Hoskins, who pulls off one of the year's most remarkable
acting feats in writer-director Atom Egoyan's adaptation of William
Trevor's novel.  Like all of Egoyan's work, the unfolds like a mystery,
so I'll keep plot details to their barest minimum.  The Felicia of the
title (Elaine Cassidy) is a naive Irish teen who travels to England to
find the lost lover who left her pregnant.  Whom she ends up finding
instead--or vice versa-- Joseph Hilditch (Hoskins), a gentle catering
manager who offers his help in her search.</P>
<P>As Egoyan employs his usual technique of travelling back and forth
through time, some secrets about Hilditch's past and present surface, and
the relationship between Felicia and Hilditch is in a constant state of
flux--but no moreso than than their individual sense of identity. 
Cassidy is a natural and likable actress, and she makes for an easily
sympathetic audience surrogate.  Although her character figures into the
title, the key journey of the film is that of the tormented Hilditch, and
Hoskins does an astonishing job in bringing this very complex character
to life.  It's impossible to adequately describe the difficulty of his
acting task without divulging critical plot information, but suffice it
to say that Hoskins pulls it off without a hitch.  The film doesn't pack
the forceful emotional wallop of Egoyan's last effort, the
Oscar-nominated _The_Sweet_Hereafter_, but _Felicia's_Journey_ is a
deeply haunting film that only grows moreso upon reflection.</P>
