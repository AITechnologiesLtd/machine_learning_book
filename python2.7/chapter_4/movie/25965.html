<P>"Space Cowboys" is the antithesis to "Armageddon." Let me explain. 
"Armageddon" was over-the-top and mechanical, though still a fun trip into 
space, whereas "Space Cowboys" is primarily concerned with leisurely pacing 
and characters of depth and understanding. In the end, these grumpy old 
cowboys are action heroes at heart yet they bear the burden of old age and 
Medicare worries. </P>
<P>Clint Eastwood (who also wrote and directed) stars as Frank Corvin, a former 
Air Force test pilot who later designed a pragmatic guidance system for a 
satellite. Apparently, such satellite systems that were innovative in 1958 
are no longer used in 1998, though one has apparently found its way into the 
hands of the Soviets. Unfortunately, this satellite is hurling towards the 
Earth's atmosphere and none of the latest whiz technicians know how to 
control it. Frank has an idea how, since he designed it in the first place, 
and he employs the use of his former crew of pilots to go into space and 
retrieve it. The former pilots include James Garner as a Reverend; Donald 
Sutherland as a ladies' man roller coaster expert; and Tommy Lee Jones, a 
hotheaded pilot who still flies planes and bears a grudge towards Frank from 
the old days. </P>
<P>"Space Cowboys" marches along with a by-the-numbers plotline that includes 
the obligatory training session (including a sneak peek of these geezers's 
butts), the usual shouting matches and confrontations with the reluctant NASA 
officials, such as William Devane as one gum-chewing NASA bureaucrat and 
James Cromwell (the tallest of the whole cast) as another, and, well, you get 
the drill. Once these flyboys enter space, the film picks up with some 
snappy, humorous dialogue and excellent special-effects.  </P>
<P>Eastwood draws suspense in the film's action climax because he brings such 
vulnerability, pathos and dignity to the characters, including Tommy Lee 
Jones as the widower who has a passing romantic interest in a younger woman 
(Marcia Gay Harden). Sutherland is his quick-witted smooth old self, a sight 
unseen since Robert Altman's "MASH" or "Kelly's Heroes" (the latter also 
starred Eastwood). James Garner can draw laughs with the barest of facial 
expressions, though his role often feels truncated. And good old boy Eastwood 
may not be aging like fine wine, but he still has a commanding presence (and 
is far more believable than in "True Crime" as an aging reporter). </P>
<P>"Space Cowboys" has sparkle and is illuminated by a fine cast. The story is 
old-hat to say the least and far too predictable, but these old pros still 
know how to put on a good show. </P>
