<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A classy western filmed on a low-budget. This is a very pleasant western drama
about those who are very good opposing those who are rotten. It's a film with
good family values, and it's done in a very satisfying way. It makes the most
out of its human interest story, as the script by Dan Ullman slowly builds up to
its climactic action scene. Joel McCrea gives an outstanding performance as a
moral person, who must do what is right even if it means placing himself in
danger. </P>
<P>Heading to California in 1870 by covered wagon, Dr. John Brighton's (Joel
McCrea) wife dies during childbirth but the baby girl survives. He buries his
wife in the nearby small Oklahoma Territory town and is too tired to continue
travelling with his friends out west. A kindly old woman, Mrs. Fitzgerald
(Esther Dale), looks after the baby whom he names after his wife Louise, and she
allows him to use her house to open his medical practice. </P>
<P>After 5 years the doc is a respected member of the community, but Louise has
grown to be too frisky for the fragile Mrs. Fitzgerald to handle. So she gets
the busy doctor the attractive 18-year-old Indian maiden, Maria Smith (Talbott),
to take care of the child. This sparks gossip in town that doc is having an
affair with her. Maria does love doc, but he only thinks of her as a young and
vulnerable girl. Also interested in the doc is the young widow, Anne Barnes
(Hale), who owns one of the biggest ranches in town. </P>
<PRE>Warning: spoiler to follow. </PRE>
<P>The villains are cattle baron brothers, Cass and Mel Dobie (Brad Dexter and
Douglas Dick). They get greedy when they discover oil on the Indian Charlie
Smith's (Pate) property and plot to take over his place. The film builds on the
growing hatred between doc and Cass. When Mel is seen by Charlie taking samples
from his land and is asked to leave, he fires at Charlie. But, Charlie, in
self-defense kills him with his knife. When he turns himself into the marshal,
he is held there for his own protection. Meanwhile, Cass vows to make Charlie
pay for his brother's death. He brings up slurs about the Indians and has half
the town agreeing with him. But doc comes to Charlie's defense and gets into a
deadly gunfight with Cass, where he gets winged in the arm but kills Cass. </P>
