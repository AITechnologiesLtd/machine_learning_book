<P>THE EXORCIST (based on the novel by William Peter Blatty)</P>
<PRE>Rating: 4,5 out of 6
MPAA Classification: R
Genre: Drama/horror
Cast: Ellen Burstyn, Max von Sydow, Jason Miller, Linda Blair.
Directed by William Friedkin</PRE>
<P>A 12-year-old girl, Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) starts to behave
rather strangely. She loses control of her body, and strange telekinetic
phenomena occur in her bedroom. Her mother, Chris MacNeil (Ellen
Burstyn), believes her to have a mental illness. Regan is examined by
medical personell, who at first seemed to think she had a somatic
disease; she is then assumed to have an inexplicable mental disturbance.
Seeing as how the doctors can't help, and beginning to believe that her
daughter might be "possessed", Chris attempts to get in touch with an 
"exorcist", a person capable of dispelling evil spirits from a human's 
body by a religious ritual, and thus meets with Father Damien Karras
(Jason Miller), a Catholic priest and psychiatrist. Meanwhile Regan's 
body has been seriously twisted by the assumed demon inside of her, and 
she speaks with a strange, devilish voice. Father Karras believes her to 
be possessed by a demon, and finally agrees to perform exorcism on her, 
if he can get permission by the Catholic Church. But the bishop decides 
to hire another priest, a more experienced exorcist, for the job. Father 
Merrin (Max von Sydow) arrives, and the painstacking act of exorcism can
begin ...</P>
<P>I think THE EXORCIST truly is a powerful movie, even today. When it was 
released, it set a new standard for acceptable violence and gore on the 
screen. Although it's a bit slow in the beginning, and contains very few 
reminders of a "horror genre movie", it certainly builds up to the
inevitable and breath-taking ending. The way be follow Regan's 
transformation from a beautiful young girl to a horrific half demon, 
half human, is very well pictured. The demon's behaviour and speeches 
are less realistic. Especially all the "bad language", which rather than 
impresses us, makes us believe that Satan is a street punk!
The end of the movie is dramatic, and both von Sydow and Miller do a
tremendous and breathtaking performance as exorcists. Maybe the final
ending is a little cheap, and there are many unanswered questions. 
Perhaps, like several other movies that are based on novels, the 
audience feel that the story moves a little too fast forward, since the
length has been shortened down, and all the subplots and continuity of a
novel has to be thinned or cut.</P>
<P>Still, a very interesting and "afterthought-kind" of movie. Unlike the
slasher movies of the 80's, which for the most had no intelligent plot 
at all, THE EXORCIST brings up a fascinating story and very talented
 actors.</P>
