<PRE>                           THIRTEEN DAYS
                  A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Essentially a remake of THE
          MISSILES OF OCTOBER, THIRTEEN DAYS tells the
          story of the Cuban Missile Crisis as a political
          thriller.  The film is polished and engaging but
          not all of the stylistic decisions make sense.
          The tagline "You'll never believe how close we
          came" is a good indicator of the style and
          message of the film.  Rating: 7 (0 to 10), +2
          (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     My view of THIRTEEN DAYS is heavily colored by my view of the
Kennedy administration and its Cuban policy in general and in this
incident in particular.  The crisis is just about the only major
Cold War incident when I feel the Soviets were in the right.  It is
not easy to get me to agree with Soviets I might add.  At this point
in history the US had already put nuclear missiles just off the
borders of the Soviet.  They also had complained loudly but really
only complained about a branch of the US government sponsoring an
invasion of Cuba.  Had the tables been reversed we would have
labeled the Bay of Pigs invasion "an act of war," but I suspect the
Soviets were a little fearful of the implications of so doing so and
quite rightly.  Acts of war really require retaliation.  They could
not, however, ignore a second such invasion, so they needed a
deterrent to prevent it from ever happening if for no other reason
than to preserve the peace.  It is the Americans who say, "If you
want peace, prepare for war."  The Soviets looked at the missiles
just over the border in Turkey and saw them as setting a precedent,
they would fortify Cuba.  That would seem a just act.  But instead
of regarding it as such it led to a head to head confrontation.  If
you see the film you will see all the tangible steps to diffuse the
situation are taken by the Soviets.  This we label "Going eyeball to
eyeball with the enemy and the other guy blinked."  Thank goodness
he did blink when we might not have.  I cannot help but feel the
unsung hero of THIRTEEN DAYS is Nikita Khrushchev.  This is just my
interpretation, I am no expert, but it colors my reaction to the
film.</P>
<P>     THIRTEEN DAYS is the story of the Cuban Missile Crisis from the
point of view of Presidential advisor Kenneth O'Donnell (played by
Kevin Costner).  The film is pretty much just a blow-by-blow
recounting of the incidents of the crisis beginning with a spy plane
flying over Cuba and seeing the nuclear missiles the Soviets had
provided the Cubans.  The John F. Kennedy ( played here by Bruce
Greenwood) is told almost immediately.  He calls in his brother
Robert (Steven Culp), his closest confidant.  For the remainder of
the crisis the President seems to have two heads, the Jack head and
the Bobby head.</P>
<P>     Anyone with a knowledge of history knows what happened next,
including the strong policy split between the military and civilians
in government.  The Chiefs of Staff were anxious to take on the
Soviets in a war they assumed they could limit.  Toward the end of
the crisis we realize that the Soviets also have their own divisions
in policy with hawks and doves in the Politburo.  The film is a
constant battle between those who want military solutions and those
who want diplomatic ones with John Kennedy being indecisive between
them, and rightly so.  Kennedy is haunted by his reading of Barbara
Tuchman's THE GUNS OF AUGUST, an account of how both sides behaving
in what at the time appeared logical ways inexorably descended into
the First World War.  That could happen again, this time with
nuclear missiles.</P>
<P>     THIRTEEN DAYS makes some bad stylistic mistakes.  The film
opens with a missile firing and a nuclear explosion.  Then more
missile firing and more big explosions.  Then more of the same.  The
point is, of course, that this sort of exchange is what they will be
trying to avoid.  Frankly I started to find this frequent visual
reminder of the high stakes involved rather annoying.  We all agree
that this is what we are trying to avoid.  We all agree that nuclear
weapons are very, very bad.  But to think clearly we have to avoid
what Kissinger called "scaring ourselves to death."  Showing the
bomb so often in hellish hues of red is a patronizing emotional
argument thrown in among the logical arguments of the film.  A
number of scenes toward the beginning seem for no reason to start
out in black and white and steel blue and fade into the full color
spectrum.  It was not all scenes and the implication may have been
we are taking this from cold-hard records and breathing life into
it.  But I was not sure.  Whatever it was trying to do it was
failing.  The Boston accents were a distraction particularly because
actors were not consistent in the degree of their own accents.
SPARTACUS was not made in Latin with English subtitles.  Director
Roger Donaldson could have toned them down a little and we could
have lived with the inaccuracy.</P>
<P>     On the other hand the film does produce a great feeling of
immediacy without snowing the viewer in detail he does not
understand.  The build of tension is very good in spite of the fact
we all know how it will turn out.  Part of the problem with this
documentary is that it has been done before and is overly familiar.
There was an excellent TV docu-drama in the mid-1970s, THE MISSILES
OF OCTOBER.  There was also at least one good documentary made for
television.  Each was better than THIRTEEN DAYS.</P>
<P>     I think films like this that show us an important event in
history in minute detail are very good, but that THIRTEEN DAYS is a
highly flawed example that makes it fall short of being a really
great film.  I rate it 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on the -4 to
+4 scale.  And I still think it picks out the wrong people to be
heroes.</P>
