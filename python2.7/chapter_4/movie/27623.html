                       A film review by Robert Strohmeyer

<P>Due in part to a dense shroud of regulatory policy, the Korean film
industry finds few viewers in the West.  One of a mere handful of
directors to break through this barrier in recent years is Im Kwon Taek
(Mandala, Ticket).  The latest in a line of more than 100 films for Im
(Korean family names come before given names), Chunhyang is a vivid
retelling of the classic Korean tale of an 18th century love that
withstands and defines a culture.</P>
<P>A musical of sorts, Chunhyang emerges as a rare pairing of film with the
ancient Korean operatic tradition of pansori.  As such, the picture
opens on a black, dimly lighted stage as the pansori singer begins the
tale, blending quickly into the moment of action.</P>
<P>Mongryong (Cho Seung Woo), the devoted son of a provincial governor,
asks his servant to show him the sights of the region and gets more than
he bargained for when he spies the beautiful Chunhyang (Lee Hyo Jung). 
The daughter of a courtesan, Chunhyang is a forbidden fruit that
Mongryong can't resist.  No sooner are the two married than Mongryong
must depart for Seoul.  But Chunhyang, being little more than a
courtesan herself, must stay behind or cost her husband his chance at a
noble title.</P>
<P>As Mongryong leaves, a new governor comes to town and learns of the
much-desired Chunhyang.  But, as a devoted wife, she refuses the new
governor's advances and is sentenced to death.  The remainder of the
picture concerns, of course, the return of Mongryong and the dishing out
of justice to the corrupt governor.</P>
<P>In itself, the story behind Chunhyang is no more intriguing than that of
Romeo and Juliet.  Two lovers come together against all odds, yadda
yadda yadda.  What surprised this critic was the stream of feminist
commentary surrounding this picture, laudable for its vision of strength
in womanhood.  If anything, however, Im's vision of Chunhyang as a
character is simply that of a devoted woman who knows her place.  Far
from an uplifting break from traditionally misogynistic views of
femininity, what we're really being offered here is a modern re-hashing
of an essentially Confucian idea that women can achieve greatness only
through self-sacrifice in the name of their husbands.</P>
<P>Simultaneously, though, it is a richly experimental movie, demonstrating
(as Mandala did before it) the vast cultural offerings of Korean
cinema.  Cunningly acted and breathtakingly filmed (except for the
pansori scenes, which appear to have been shot by a drunk with a
Handicam), Chunhyang takes bold risks with point of view and narrative
style that might never have come from any director other than Im Kwon
Taek.</P>
