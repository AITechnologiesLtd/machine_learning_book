<PRE>Review:</PRE>
<P>"The Game" is one of those movies that people love to call a 'taut
thriller'.
In reference to this film, though, 'taut' is a joke.  Most movies that
categorize themselves as suspenseful thrillers or somesuch have a few
surprises in them and perhaps a twist at the end that you might or might not
have seen coming.  "The Game" is decidedly atypical.  I can honestly say
that
this is one of the most gripping and probably the most suspenseful movie I
have seen.</P>
<P>David Fincher's fingerprints are all over this movie, and that is a very
very
good thing.  From the customary darkness of the city and Michael Douglas'
suits and Sean Penn's hair to the brief explosion of blinding neon in the
middle of the film to the unspeakably suspenseful ending, it's clear who the
director was.  Actually, it's funny, I first heard a while back that David
Fincher had directed some music videos, among which were "Janie's Got a Gun"
by Aerosmith and "Vogue" by Madonna.  I thought that was kind of odd, but
after seeing each of those videos  again, I really feel I should have known.
Also, I have read in a place or two that he is either "strongly influenced
by" or "blatantly copies" a film by the name of Videodrome, but having never
seen it, I cannot comment.</P>
<P>Okay, enough about the director.  Ever since I saw "Wall Street", I have
been
somewhat of a fan of Douglas, though he has made some movies by which I am
decidedly unimpressed.  Even if you don't like him, though, it's very clear
that he was perfectly cast in this role.  It's a role he's been playing
quite
often of late.  Basically, he's the guy from "A Perfect Murder", except he's
a slightly more sympathetic character this time around.</P>
<P>He is, however, not hugely concerned with those around him, including his
brother        Conrad, played by Sean Penn.  Penn is unquestionably one of my
favorite actors, and if you don't agree, you should check out "State of
Grace" and "She's So Lovely".  Anyway, though Penn's role is fairly small,
he is responsible for the goings-on in the movie. For his birthday, Conrad
gives his brother a gift certificate redeemable for participation in a game
that is tailor-made for each participant by a company called Consumer
Recreation Services.  On somewhat of a whim, Nicholas decides to try it out,
and man, do antics ensue!</P>
<P>I really don't see what there is not to like about this film.  There is
certainly the question of plausibility, but it is addressed relatively well
in the movie.  And besides, it's not all that hard to suspend disbelief
for two hours and eight minutes.  It's really a highly entertaining
experience, and if that doesn't        get you, then you can just pay attention to
how beautiful the whole thing is.  I am a big fan of the work of several
people connected with this movie.  Fincher and Andrew Kevin Walker
(co-writer)
worked together on Se7en (possibly my favorite movie ever), and as I said
before, I am a fan of both Douglas and Penn.  This is a movie that just
can't
go wrong.  Give it a try.</P>
