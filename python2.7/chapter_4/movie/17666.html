M (****** out of ******)</PRE>
<PRE>A review from the Stockholm Film Review
<A HREF="http://www.reviewfilm.com/">http://www.reviewfilm.com/</A></PRE>
<P>Fritz Lang's M (1931) tells the story of a child killer who 
is terrorising a small German city. The film opens with a group 
of children playing and singing a nursery rhyme, the lyrics of 
which tell of a man in black who will take children who are 
naughty and chop them up. As they play, they bounce a ball 
against a street lamp, on which there is a Wanted poster, for 
the killer.</P>
<P>The next scene is in a fairground - a man buys a balloon for a 
small girl while whistling a jaunty tune. Meanwhile, her mother 
is busy preparing dinner for her return. Soon, the balloon is 
seen tangled in overhead power-lines - the child is the latest 
victim of the killer, while, at home, her mother becomes more 
and more frantic.</P>
<P>The latest killing causes outrage - parents are afraid to let 
their children go to school and even the most innocuous gestures 
by men towards children lead to suspicion and accusations. The 
police are under pressure - the city council, the press and the 
public are screaming for results.</P>
<P>The police inspector Lohmann (Otto Wernicke) in charge of the 
Investigation is a clever man, and he is methodical in his 
methods of detection. The killer is Franz Becker (Peter Lorre), 
who has been sending letters to the press and the police manage 
to track down his apartment. However, the police are not the only 
people looking for the killer - the criminal underworld has offered 
their own reward for his capture. This is not because of 
philanthropy - the police searches have caused so much interference 
to their activities, they decide that it is better for them if 
they catch the killer.</P>
<P>Lang's superb film contrasts the gentle, almost child-like manner 
of the killer, as he gradually gains the trust of his victims, 
with the frantic nature of the police and criminal investigations. 
When Becker attempts to lure another child away, he is patient 
and meticulous. He is a charming fellow, and he easily seduces 
his latest target, plying the young girl with cakes and bringing 
her to a funfair. </P>
<P>The pace of the chase is far more frantic. Though the police 
quickly discover the identity of the killer, it is the criminals 
who find the killer first. Becker is betrayed by his trademark 
tune. He buys a balloon from the same vendor as he had done when 
he murdered his previous victim. The vendor is blind but remembers
the tune (Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt Suite 1 Op. 46, "In the Hall 
of the Mountain King") and sends a young helper to follow Becker. 
The boy chalks the letter 'M' on his hand and, walking past 
Becker, pats him on the shoulder, leaving the 'M' imprinted on 
the back of his coat. In a delicious irony, the child with him 
(his prospective victim) notices the smudge on his coat, and 
tries to wipe it off. Becker realises that he has been marked, 
and attempts to escape. He is now in a dilemma - both the police 
and the criminal underworld hunt him. As night falls, he takes 
refuge in an office building. The criminals surround the 
building, seize him and hold their own mock trial.</P>
<P>Lang's movie constantly jolts our expectations - the criminal 
boss who organises the hunt for the killer is a sharply dressed 
and well-organised man. In contrast, Lohmann (the police 
inspector) is sloppily dressed, drinks and smokes too much, and 
exhibits the characteristics normally associated with a movie 
villain. He is, however, a clever detective, and his methodical 
approach, and his ingenious interrogation techniques lead him to 
both Becker's apartment and to the office building where the 
criminals are hunting Becker.</P>
<P>What is most impressive about M is how relevant and modern the 
film appears. The depiction of the hard-pressed police and also 
Lorre's portrayal of a baby-faced killer have not been surpassed 
by filmmakers since. There isn't a superfluous frame in the 
movie - Lang cuts between the hunt for the killer, and the 
killer's own hunt for his next victim to build the tension 
unbearably towards an exciting and fascinating climax. Several 
scenes stand out - the mother of a murdered child busying 
herself preparing her daughter's dinner. Every time a child 
arrives in the apartment block, she rushes out to see if it is 
her daughter. Each time, she grows a little more worried. We, 
the audience, know the child is never coming back, which makes
the mother's anxiety even more poignant. Another outstanding 
scene is when the criminals are hunting for Becker in the office 
building. The alarm has been sounded, so the criminals have only 
a limited amount of time in which to search for Becker - of 
course, Becker does not know this. He cowers like a caged rat, 
in a storage locker, hoping the criminals will not find him.</P>
<P>Again, Lang skilfully manipulates the audience - we want justice, 
but do we want it to occur at the hands of the criminals 
(amongst whom are killers and other undesirables) or at the 
hands of the upright and resourceful police inspector? His use 
of music is also skilful - we need only hear the tune to know 
that the killer is active and another child is in mortal danger. 
It's hard to believe that this was Lang's first 'talkie' - he was 
already well known for his silent classic, Metropolis (1926).</P>
<P>It is interesting to compare M to movies released in the United 
States around the same time. Both The Public Enemy (1931) and 
Little Caesar (1930)featured strong criminal personalities 
(breakthrough roles for James Cagney and Edward G. Robinson 
respectively). However, both films were studies of misused 
power. Though both Cesare 'Little Caesar' Bandello (Robinson) 
and Tom Powers (Cagney) were both capable of murder and 
viciousness, they were evil in a conventional sense. Two 
classic horror movies were also released at that time - 
Frankenstein (1931) and Dracula (1931). Both movies featured 
a monster, and scared audiences but in each case, the monster 
conformed to conventional mythology - it looked terribly scary 
and had an inhuman conception. The power of M derives from the 
fact that the monster had a human, almost angelic face, but 
his crimes were beyond comprehension.</P>
<P>Though most reviews of M describe Lorre as the main star, 
it is really an ensemble performance. Lorre's performance 
is outstanding - his portrayal of the truly multidimensional - 
his inability to see himself as anything other than a victim 
makes him seem even more evil. His terror at the prospect of 
receiving summary justice from the criminals is palpable. Lorre 
seems far heavier, even chubby, in this role than he would for 
later roles in Hollywood, such as The Maltese Falcon (1941) 
and Casablanca (1942).</P>
<P>The original title for M was The Murderer among Us, but it 
was changed in case the Nazi party inferred a reference to 
them. In fact, the story was based on a real-life murderer, 
but since M featured a dark parody of law and order (when 
the criminals hold their own 'trial' of Becker) and examined 
the power of mob-rule, it may have caused discomfort amongst 
the followers of the Nazi party. One could argue, with the 
benefit of hindsight that the portrayal of 'unspeakable evil 
with an ordinary face' in M could be seen as an allegory of 
the Nazis during World War 2, but it is unlikely that Lang 
intended such a comparison. In fact, Hitler and other high-level 
members of the Nazi party were fans of Lang's work. They wanted 
Lang to make propaganda films, but Lang escaped to America, 
fearing the consequences of having Jewish relations. Lorre, 
who was Jewish, also left for America during the Thirties.</P>
