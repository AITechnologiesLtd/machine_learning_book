<P>     CHAPLIN is Sir Richard Attenborough's recounting of the life and
times of film great Charlie Chaplin.  The story picks up in 1894, when
Charlie is five, and lasts until 1972, five years before his death in
1977.  Along the way,  Attenborough gives us glimpses of Hollywood in
its infancy, the filmmaking process, and McCarthyism.  Above all,
however, CHAPLIN shows the life, both on and off-screen, of one of the
pioneers of motion pictures.</P>
<P>     It's easy to pick out the single major flaw of CHAPLIN.  It's too
ambitious.  Attempting to condense seventy-eight years into one-hundred
adn forty-four minutes is a Herculean task that not even a director of
Richard Attenborough's accomplishments is up to.  There's too much
material, and because the story is so rich, characters and events go
whizzing by at dizzying speeds.  CHAPLIN becomes a series of scenes and
images rather than a cohesive whole.</P>
<P>     Robert Downey Jr. does a highly credible Chaplin.  Not only does
he look like the comic, but he had mastered the physical mannerisms so
necessary to the role.  Downey said that copying "The Tramp" was his
biggest challenge.  It is also his most impressive accomplishment.  In
fact, the actor so perfectly captures his character that clips of the
actual Chaplin can be used in the movie without ruining the illusion.</P>
<P>     Aside from Chaplin, there is little attempt at character depth.
Douglas  Fairbanks (Kevin Kline, most recently of CONSENTING ADULTS),
Sydney Chaplin (Paul Rhys), and Oona Chaplin (Moira Kelly, of THE
CUTTING EDGE) are fleshed out a little, but none of them could be
considered three-dimensional.  It certainly isn't the actors' faults.
Their characters have such limited screen time that it's difficult to do
more than introduce them.</P>
<P>     Choosing Geraldine Chaplin to play Charlie's mother Hannah is a
case of inspired casting.  Aside from Downey, she gives the most
convincing portrayal, and even though her screen time is limited, she
has presence in the scenes she's in.</P>
<P>     Attenborough, with a flair for the subtle, cast Moira Kelly in a
double role--that of Hetty Kelly, Charlie's lost love, and of Oona, with
whom he had his only successful marriage.  Kelly has trouble with the
early role--or, more specifically, with Hetty's accent--but she does a
fine job as Oona.  The obvious resemblance between the two characters is
never commented upon, so it's up to the viewer to make the connection.
Unfortunately, this is another instance where the script fails.  Since
Hetty is only briefly introduced, it's hard to envision her as one of
the forces that drives Chaplin's life, and even harder to understand how
he is able to set aside her memory through Oona.</P>
<P>     Indeed, emotional moments are few and far between in CHAPLIN.  The 
only scene of any genuine power comes in the closing moments of the 
movie.  Aside from that, watching the film is much like perusing a 
history textbook--informative and interesting, but not memorable or 
powerful.  Fortunately, CHAPLIN is well-paced and snappily-plotted, so
it never becomes dull or tedious.  Early in the film, Mack Sennett (Dan
Aykroyd) notes that Chaplin's first film appearance is on the cutting 
room floor--not a good place to be.  One wonders how much of this 
picture ended up getting snipped.  My sense is that there was a lot--
too much, perhaps--but it's difficult to imagine that any reasonable
length could have been enough to do justice to the man's life.  Seeing
CHAPLIN has given me a strong desire to read the autobiography upon
which the movie is based.</P>
<P>     As expected from an Attenborough film, CHAPLIN boasts strong
production values.  The editing and camera work are smooth.  There's a
wonderful "life imitates art" scene where Chaplin is being chased by the
police, and this couldn't have been better put together.  The aging
effects are some of the best I've seen.  When Chaplin is old, he looks
like he's being played by an elderly actor, not Robert Downey Jr. under
a mountain of makeup.  Veteran composer John Barry's score, while
perhaps too reminiscent of his DANCES WITH WOLVES music, is evocative.</P>
<P>     All-in-all, although CHAPLIN is solid entertainment, it's far from
a magnificent film.  As intellectually intriguing and satisfying as it
is, the movie fails to touch enough emotional chords to make it of more
than passing interest.  </P>
