<P>I have no rugs in the apartment, beyond the necessary absorbent bath
mat.  The people in the apartment below mine aren't there most of the
time, maybe on weekends but that's about it.  I think in real estate
marketting lingo, Apartment 3C is a pied-a-terre, which is French for
"I am closer to living in a Merchant-Ivory film than you are."  So, I
haven't fulfilled my lease requirements for having 80% of the floor
covered.  Nonetheless, I truly identify with the Dude when some guys
break into his apartment and pee on his rug.</P>
<P>"The Big Lebowski" is the Coen brothers latest film, the first since
they've achieved mainstream appeal with "Fargo".  I'm not sure what to
say about it, beyond that it was damn funny, arguably their best pure
comedy since "Raising Arizona".  Yes, "Fargo", for example, is a funny
film, but there's a certain macabre humor to the whole thing.  The body
count in "Lebowski" isn't that high, and isn't related to the main action.</P>
<P>The central figure is Lebowski, an unemployed bowling league member
in Los Angeles.  He doesn't call himself Lebowski -- he's the Dude to
people who know him.  In some sense, he's like the Man with No Name in
standard Westerns, except he's not quite a Man of Purpose and Action.
Through mistaken identity, his rug, which really brought the room
together, is ruined, sending him off on a quest to get a new rug.
He's the object of larger forces and designs, rather than the shaper of
these external powers, just going with the flow.</P>
<P>That's the basic plot.  I won't go further into it, partly for the sake of
not revelaing spoilers, partly because the the plot is there more to show
Lebowski, his friends, the people they meet, and Coens-style absurdity.
There are elegant dream sequences involving Julianne Moore, and this
fantastic shot from inside a bowling ball as it rolls down the lane.
The miracles of fibre optic cameras are revealed here.</P>
<P>There's not that much more to say about the movie beyond, go see it.
Yes, there may be bits and pieces of the idea of identity -- the Dude is
basically as you see him, unlike most of the other people in the movie,
even the John Goodman character who clings to Shabbat despite being an
Irish Catholic -- as well as the Dude being like a block of uncarved
wood in a sort of Taoist/Buddhist philosophizing, but, fundamentally,
it's a funny film.  Not much more needs to be said.</P>
