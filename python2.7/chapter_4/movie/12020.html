<PRE><HR>                            LOST IN SPACE
                    A film review by Ram Samudrala<HR></PRE>
<P>It's not clear to me why /Lost in Space/ has been slammed so much by
critics.  The effects are great, the plot has its moments, and the
acting is mediocre.  That doesn't seem much different from many
blockbusters that have received far more positive reviews, such as
/Independence Day/ or /Mission: Impossible/.</P>
<P>The plot: Humans have exhausted the resources of Earth and need to
colonise other planets in order to continue their polluting existence.
The area of space humans are interested in colonising is known as
Alpha Prime, which requires a ten year journey by "normal"
space flight.  An "hypergate" is being constructed that will enable the
inhabitants of Earth to travel to Alpha Prime in no time, but for it
to work, the gate has to exist at both ends.  The Robinson Family,
John (William Hurt), Maureen (Mimi Rogers), Judy (Heather Graham),
Penny (Lacey Chabert), and Will (Jack Johnson), are the ones
responsible for building the hypergate at the Alpha Prime end (and
this is the most incredulous part of the movie).</P>
<P>With Major Don West (Matt LeBlanc) piloting Jupiter II, the spacecraft
carrying the Robinsons begins its ten year journey to Alpha Prime.
However, the Global Alliance undertaking this colonisation mission has
an enemy, the Global Sedition, who recruit Dr. Smith (Gary Oldman) to
sabotage the mission and kill the Robinsons.  When Smith himself is
double crossed and left on the spaceship, he helps avert the Robinson
family destruction.  In doing so, the Robinson family find themselves
pulled towards a sun and have to engage the hyperdrive to escape.  But
as John Robinson says at the beginning of the movie, using the
hyperdrive without a hypergate at other end will result in uncertainty
in the final destination, and the Robinsons end up being lost in
space.</P>
<P>At this point, the story begins to lose cohesion. As the family wander
around space, they encounter a ship from their future invested with
heat-seeking silicon-based spider-like creatures and a fuzzy animated
monkey-like creature who comes to be known as "Blawp".  The ship from
the future is no coincidence: the Robinsons find that they're caught
in a time bubble whose originator is intent on going back in time to
prevent the Robinsons from beginning their mission.  But unknown to
everyone, there's a fly, or should I say spider, in every dab of
science-fiction ointment.</P>
<P>While the futuristic set design is what makes this movie worth
watching, the acting by most of the characters is terrible.  Oldman,
Chabert, and Johnson are the ones that shine, while the rest of the
cast come off as uninspired.  The plot has its moments, but the ending
is too weak. Worth the matinee fare on the big screen.</P>
