<P>Susan Granger's review of "TUMBLEWEEDS" (Fine Line Films)</P>
<P>Why see Tumbleweeds? One very compelling reason: Janet McTeer,
who's been dubbed "the next Meryl Streep."  The plot, involving a
flighty, narcissistic mother and profane, outspoken adolescent
daughter who hop in a car and head for a new life in California,
sounds like Anywhere But Here, but this affable, low-budget comedy is
far more focused, character-driven, and less artificial than the Susan
Sarandon/Natalie Portman star vehicle in which the supporting players
seemed like cardboard cut-outs. Besides, there's Janet McTeer, a
remarkable, highly respected British actress who won Broadway's Tony
several years ago as Nora in a revival of Ibsen's A Doll's House. The
Amazonian McTeer plays a working class woman from North Carolina who
drags her smart-aleck teenage daughter (Kimberly J. Brown) through her
many abusive, failed relationships, finally trying to settle down in
Starlight Beach, a quiet seaside town near San Diego, and find
happiness with a long-haul trucker (Gavin O'Connor) who's
contemptuously referred to as "the future ex-husband." There have been
four previous ex-husbands. Directed and co-written by Gavin O'Connor,
the story is loosely based on the relationship between screenwriter
Angela Shelton (O'Connor's ex-wife) and her own strong-willed,
free-spirited mother. And the tone of the film is curiously
reminiscent of Martin Scorsese's Alice Doesn't Live Here
Anymore. Twitchy supporting actor Michael J. Pollard makes a brief but
memorable appearance, looking not much older than he did in Bonnie and
Clyde, back in 1967. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,
Tumbleweeds is a rueful but significant 7, because of Janet McTeer's
complex, funny, multi-faceted performance which includes an impeccable
Southern accent.</P>
