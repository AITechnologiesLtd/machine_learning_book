<PRE>Ministry of Fear (1945)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 81</PRE>
<P>"Ministry of Fear" is a greatly underrated
'film noir' mystery thriller from the 1940s.
Strange and confusing, the plot is pieced
together slowly and only by film's end does
it make complete sense.  The film's lead,
Ray Milland, is as much in the dark as is
the audience.  His confusion throughout the
film is only matched by his determination to
unravel the whole mystery, a Nazi spy ring
that is fronted by a charitable organization.</P>
<P>Stephen Neale (Milland) has spent the past
two years in an English asylum after mercy
killing his wife.  Released during the World
War II era of German bombing raids, Milland's
attempts at establishing a normal life are
thwarted when he is mistaken for a Nazi agent.
As a good patriotic citizen, Neale wants to
get to the bottom of it.  It seems that the
only people willing to help him are
good-natured Willi Hilfe (Carl Esmond) and
his sister Carla (Marjorie Reynolds).
Eventually, Neale is accused of murder, and
must clear his name in addition to uncovering
the spy ring.</P>
<P>What makes "Ministry of Fear" special isn't
just director Fritz Lang's ability to string
along the viewer, or the screenplay adapted
from the Graham Greene novel.  It isn't even
the 'film noir' feel of dark lighting and
shady, mysterious characters.  The best part
is that the film is completely unpredictable:
the viewer knows that something is about to
happen, but has no idea what it is.  In other
words, the suspense.</P>
