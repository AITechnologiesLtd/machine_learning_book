<PRE>The Straight Story Review</PRE>
<P>  David Lynches latest flick, is similar to Elephant Man emotional wise, but
not as touching. Although Richard Farnsworth was superb as Alvin Straight, the
film depends too much on sentimental moments, rather than paying attention to
the dull script.
  In "The Straight Story," Richard Fransworth is Alvin Straight, a stubborn old
man, with bad knees and vision. When he is told that his brother is in critical
condition, he wants dearly to visit him. The only problem is he can't drive,
nor can anyone drive him. The alternative? A John Deere lawnmower. Alvin
immediately ventures 300 miles  on a rugged road trip down to his brother's
home.
  The film basically plays like Easy Rider on sleeping pills. In both films,
they venture out to see the world, and meet exciting new people. Sure Alvin
meets some friendly people, but they don't keep your interest like Jack
Nicholson did with Easy Rider. Another problem is that Richard Fransworth is
the only real value of the film. Story has it's moments, but Farnsworth is
always there to lift our spirits, with his funny lines and charming stubborn
self. Ever since Anne Of Green Gables, I knew he was going to strike it big in
Hollywood . Unfortunately, he's not in Green Gables anymore. Instead, he's
stuck on a mower with a repetitive script.
  The film itself struggles immensely. If it weren't for Farnsworth, and I can
see no other actor to do the job, this film would make a nice nap. Seriously
folks, it tried too hard to be sentimental, and that's a shame, because I've
seen that kind of film hundreds of times. Also the film dragged on slower than
a John Deere lawnmower. The constant pauses, and uninteresting dialogue just
couldn't keep the audiences attention. This film is not for the
squeamish.
I'm quite surprised that Lynch would take on a project so ordinary. If you've
seen his past pictures (Lost Highway, Eraserhead , etc.), you wouldn't even
know it was him. Usually Lynch makes your head spin with dazzling images and
bizarre scripts, that's why it's hard for me to believe he could do such a
film.
  Going back to Fransworth, I think he can pull off an Oscar nomination. I
think if any actor can carry the film by himself, he without a doubt deserves
recognition, and boy does Richard get that. Sissy Spacek was another annoying
element of the film. Although she had a speech impendement, (which was not the
reason I disliked her) she still managed to get under my skin. She always plays
the most boring character possible, with the exception of
Carrie, but I still dislike her acting.
  Straight Story is a simple film, with a simple story, and a great actor. It's
worth seeing the film for Richard Farnsworth, but I'd wait for video, unless
you want to see a typical feel good film.</P>
