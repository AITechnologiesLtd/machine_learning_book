<PRE>                              MAD CITY</PRE>
<P>John Travolta was originally given the role of the reporter in MAD
CITY but fortunately he opted for being Sam, the bewildered security
guard at a local art museum.   The brash reporter, Max Brackett,
belongs to Dustin Hoffman who does a bang up job.</P>
<P>How many times have we witnessed a reporter shoving a microphone in
the face of an injured person being carried to an ambulance, asking
"How did you feel when you learned you lost your leg?"  How many
times have we seen a TV News crew on the front steps of the home of
bereaved parents, asking them, "What was your first reaction when
you learned your little daughter had been killed by a hit and run
driver?"   The point of MAD CITY, is that the story comes first, the
reporter wanting to milk the situation for as long as he can.  His
exposure on the small screen is the name of the game.</P>
<P>Max, formerly with a network, has been banished to a small station
at the behest of the big city anchor, Kevin Hollander (Alan Alda)
who did not like frequently being upstaged by Max.   To keep Max in
tow, the station's manager, Lou Potts, (Robert Prosky) assigns him
to cover a small story about finances at the local art museum.   He
assigns a young, pretty woman, Laurie (Mia Kirshner) to assist Max.</P>
<P>Best laid plans and all of that, while covering this non-story, Sam,
who had been fired by the art director Mrs. Banks (Blythe Danner)
for drinking a bit too much at the museum's party, comes by to
demand his job back.   When Mrs. Banks says she will not rehire him,
the naive young man pulls a gun which he had no intention of ever
using but brought to the museum along with some sticks of dynamite
thinking to scare Mrs. Banks into giving him back his job.  He has
seen too much TV and has been led to believe that this is how you
get your job back.</P>
<P>In the museum are a couple of dozen children on a tour.  They are
now hostages. So far, that is enough to land SAM in a lot of trouble
but when the gun accidentally goes off and he shoots a fellow guard,
the stakes skyrocket.  Witnessing in an adjacent room is Max who
whispers on the connection to Laurie to alert the station that they
have a major hostage situation.   The bigger the tragedy, the better
the story; it is as simple as that.</P>
<P>MAD CITY then goes on to show Max discovered and coming out of
hiding, befriends Sam whom he advises.   But all the time, he really
does not want the drama to end too soon; not before he can again
become nationally known.   The big city anchor, Hollander, wants to
dump Max and turn this major event into his story.  He promises Max
that if the story is turned over to him, he will see that Max is
returned to big time.</P>
<P>Both Travolta and Hoffman are utterly believable.  Sam. bewildered,
not meaning to hurt anyone, just wanting his job back . . . and Max
orchestrating the proceedings to prolong the drama.</P>
<P>There is a delightful punch line delivered by Laurie to Max at the film's
end but you will have to hear it for yourselves.</P>
