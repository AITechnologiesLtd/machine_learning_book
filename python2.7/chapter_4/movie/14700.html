<PRE>The Prophecy II (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 out of *****</PRE>
<P>Cast: Christopher Walken, Jennifer Beals, Russell Wong, Eric Roberts
Written by: Matt Greenberg and Gary Spence
Directed by: Gary Spence
Running Time: 87 minutes</P>
<P>"The Prophecy II" is a vast improvement over the original. This
direct-to-video sequel again stars Christopher Walken as the evil
angel Gabriel, who's been cast out of hell and again wants to cause
havok in heaven and on Earth.</P>
<P>This time Gabriel is in pursuit of nurse Jennifer Beals, who is to
give birth to a half angel child. What this all means, I'm unclear
on. The film's story is pretty murky about details. But I do know that
Walken gives a very spirited and entertaining performance. Whenever
he's on screen, the film shines. It doesn't matter what's going on at
the time, because Walken's making it all worth while. Unfortunately,
he's not on enough to really make the film work. Most of the film is a
lot of religious psychobabble, none of which is really all too
interesting.</P>
<P>Eric Roberts has a small role as the angel Michael (who I'm assuming
is also who John Travolta played in 1996's "Michael").  His role seems
pointless though, as he never really does anything except share a
couple of lines with Walken.</P>
<P>"The Prophecy II" is a very good attempt, but still falls short of the
mark of being something good. At least though the finale of this film
isn't a meaningless duel between the evil angel and the devil, as was
the case in the original. [R]</P>
