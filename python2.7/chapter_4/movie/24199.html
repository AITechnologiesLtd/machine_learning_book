<P>Retrospective: Six Days, Seven Nights</P>
<PRE>        Starring Harrison Ford, Anne Heche,
        and David Schwimmer
        Directed by Ivan Reitman</PRE>
<P>In Movieland, when a man and a woman who hate each other
get stranded together, they must inevitably fall in love.  This
charming and nonsensical idea is the heart of this eminently
likable film directed by comic mastermind Ivan Reitman.</P>
<P>Like Bogart and Hepburn in The African Queen, Harrison Ford
and Anne Heche are an unlikely pair who are thrown together
by circumstance.  Instead of a steam launch, their vehicle is a
single-engine airplane, and instead of Africa, the setting is the
South Pacific.  But the story is every bit as delightful and
improbable as the John Huston classic.  To make this kind of
thing work, the dialogue has to sparkle and the two stars have
to have chemistry.  Six Days scores on both counts.</P>
<P>Harrison Ford's Quinn is a superannuated adolescent who
chucked it all and moved to Tahiti.  He runs a charter business
that consists of one airplane, but he is mostly just a
beachcomber.  Anne Heche's Robin is an editor for a fashion
magazine,  vacationing in the islands with her fiance.  Anne
and Harrison are off on the wrong foot right from the start,
when she makes fun of the little single-engine tail dragger, his
pride and joy,  that he intends to take them up in.  `Where's its
mommy?' she asks.  Sarcasm is her stock in trade; she's had a
lot of practice, and she's very good at it.  Harrison neatly sums
up her character when, having been shot down by another of
her verbal barrages, he simply says, `you're from New York,
aren't you?'</P>
<P>Unexpectedly having to fly back to fly back to Tahiti for a
fashion shoot, the pair run into bad weather and crash land on a
deserted island, where they can go about the business of hating
one another full-time.  With mutual recriminations mixed in to
spice things up.  He still insists that he's the best damn pilot
she's ever flown with; she points out that she's flown with him
twice and he's crashed half the time.  She begins to mellow
however when she discovers he's handy to have around when
there are snakes.  And scorpions.  She's pretty capable herself,
and saves both of their lives at one point.  In short, they need
one another.  It's not long before they want one another, too.</P>
<P>Harrison Ford, his age notwithstanding, can still pull off boyish
charm.  Amazing.  Anne Heche more than holds up her end,
and she has a real gift for comedy.  The plot of this movie is
tried-and-true Hollywood formula.  No surprises there.  In
order for it to work, the two principles have to deliver the
goods.  And they do.  It's sexy and it's funny ... who could
want more?</P>
<P>But there is more.  These characters actually have some depth.
Quinn is a guy who has pulled back into his shell, who makes a
pretty convincing case that he really is satisfied with
diminished expectations.  Robin is the kind of person who
can't rest until she has gotten him to open up.  So she prods
him until finally, over a dinner of barbecued peacock (!) he
begins to tell her his life story, the `better way of life' he has
found, simple, uncomplicated, unambitious, `the life every
man dreams of.'  `Yeah,' she responds, `until they're twelve.'
Her wit is a little too quick, her tongue a little too sharp.  She's
immediately sorry, but the damage has been done.  It's an
oddly touching moment, and it raises a theme that is returned
to later in the movie, when the two are returned to civilization.
(I'm probably not spoiling any great surprise when I reveal that
they don't leave their bleached bones on that desert island.)
The question is, what do this incompatible couple do then?
Him, who wants his life uncomplicated, and her, who craves
complication?  Or as Quinn puts it, `I'm not going to New
York to become your secretary, and you're not going to stay
out here and become my copilot, so where does that leave us?'</P>
<P>Writing satisfying, believable endings is hard.  This movie has
one, and I'm not going to spoil it by telling.  Rent this movie.
You won't be disappointed.</P>
