10 Things I Hate About You</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>1) Shakespeare can be overbearing ... so many words so fast. This rewrite of
William Shakespeare's "Taming of the Shrew" is much more palatable stripped
of the Old English encryptions.
2) One viewer exclaimed, "Better than 'Shakespeare in love!'"
3) Here's the deal, two high school age sisters -- the sophomore: prep queen
seeks a normal dating life, the senior: bitch queen (her words) hates males.
Over-protective dad (thinking it a safe bet) won't allow the younger to date
until the older does. However, some young men interested in dating the
younger pay off an equally anti-social senior male to date the elder.
4) Slow beginning, then captivating.
5) Often very funny with a few endearing moments (one even jerked a tear
from me).
6) Great acting by leads.
7) Well paced.
8) Daryl Mitchell is hilarious as the literature teacher -- he raps to
Shakespeare.
9) Good music.
10) Stay for ending credits.</P>
