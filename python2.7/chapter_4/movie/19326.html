<P>        I'm not sure if anyone else besides me has actually read my 
`Disclaimer' on my web page, but it's basically a list of rules I set for 
myself in how I view movies and write my reviews. Well, it's not often that I 
break my own rules, but in order to properly analyze and review `Austin 
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,' I must say that it's a film I've formed an 
opinion on based on seeing it four times and also as to how the audiences 
with whom I saw it reacted.
        Those two rules are just part of my own theory on film and film 
criticism. I believe a movie should be judged by how it seems to you the 
first time you see it. If there's a lot of subtlety and complex storylines 
going on, you should be able to follow and comprehend them all on first 
viewing. Also, I believe when you see a film for the first time it should 
have the same effect on you whether you're watching it in a cinema, on home 
video, alone or with a large audience. 
        Of course that's just some of my `idealist film critic' theories to 
establish my integrity, psychologists and sociologists would probably argue 
otherwise on some of these points (and other critics might too).
        How it all relates to my take on this film is in these two ways: 
firstly, I saw it four times and loved it the first three times and just 
plain liked it the fourth time; and secondly, I saw it with large audiences 
who laughed hysterically the first three times and with a semi-large audience 
who laughed a lot, but not as much as the other larger audiences.
        You might be thinking what's the point of all this since I've written 
four paragraphs and haven't even discussed the film itself yet. Well dear 
readers, the point is this: `Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me' is in and 
of itself a very, very, very funny and enjoyable movie, but what makes it 
better than being a just plain good flick is the fact that it does hold up on 
repeated viewings and that half the fun of seeing it is the atmosphere of the 
audience - a large group of people who, just like you, have plunked down a 
few beans to stare at a screen for 95 minutes and just have a good time: 
that's exactly the reason the entertainment industry exists.
        It became clear to me just 20 minutes into this film that writing a 
review of it that accurately summed up and analyzed the film would be 
difficult, if not impossible. It's a comedy that fires off the jokes, the 
gags, the zaniness and the fun like an Uzi fires bullets. It does have some 
general comedic styles to it but even I would have a hard time trying to 
define them all. Satirical? Yes. Witty? Yes. Gross? Yes. Original? Yes. 
Stupid? Yes (but in a good way).        
        To quickly go over the premise, this is the sequel to 1997's `Austin 
Powers: International Man Of Mystery,' a funny farce about a British spy-guy 
named Austin Powers (Myers), who is frozen in 1967 and returns 30 years later 
to battle his nemesis Dr. Evil (also Myers). Powers is basically James Bond's 
dorky little brother - he's not suave, he's not attractive (those bad teeth 
jokes consistently work every time), he's not always playing with a full 
deck, yet his charm lies in Myers' ability to make the guy so freaking funny.
        Since this is a summer blockbuster flick, it's not surprising the 
tone of the film isn't quite as smart as the original, and that the comedy 
comes in a rapid-fire succession to cater to the modern audience's short 
attention span. Normally, I'd have a problem with that (consider 1998's 
`Armageddon'), but since everything we get here is so unbelievably funny it's 
forgivable for the most part (Myers' screenplay may get all the jokes right, 
but his execution of plot and story could definitely use some work).
        The story goes like this: Dr. Evil, who froze himself and launched 
himself into space at the end of the last movie returns to Earth only two 
years later to hatch another scheme to, well, be evil. Dr. Evil realizes he 
can't beat Austin Powers because he lacks `mojo' and decides to travel back 
to 1969 to steal Powers' mojo while he was still cryogenically frozen. Powers 
and his boss, Basil Exposition (York) at the Ministry of Defence, realize 
this and develop a time machine of their own and thus Powers goes back in 
time to get back his mojo and stop Dr. Evil's latest scheme which involves 
shooting a giant laser at Earth from the moon.
        That's pretty much all there is to the actual plot of the film which 
amazingly allows for such funny and outrageous situations as well as the 
occasional spoof and satire.
        Here's where my aforementioned problem lies: how do I even begin to 
breakdown and analyze the comedy without leaving out any of the best and most 
important jokes? To list only a few would be an injustice for fear of making 
them seem only mildly funny on paper (or on a computer screen as is the case 
here). How do I convince the non-viewer of the film's high entertainment 
value?
        I guess I can sum it all up by saying Myers set out to make a fun 
movie and must have had a lot of fun in the process. Some comedies today are 
cruel and cynical and are based on shock value and testing society's ethics. 
Here, everything is done in good spirits, so that even when the comedy goes 
to the extreme, you can tell the filmmakers were having a great time 
producing it all. For a movie with jokes about accidentally drinking fecal 
matter; two freaky, ugly people having sex; the giant butt crack of a 
500-pound man covered in grease and filth; and eye-illusion  silhouette jokes 
about the insertion and removal of things from an anus, it's shocking but not 
too shocking. It's childish and stupid, but shown in a whole new light and is 
surprisingly funny.
        With this film Myers shows us a fresh face of mainstream comedy I've 
not seen since `Wayne's World' in 1992. Almost everything is a 
tongue-in-cheek reference to something else, whether is be within the film 
(such as Myers looking directly into the camera and telling the audience not 
to worry about the possible plot holes or how England looks in no way like 
southern California), or at modern society (such as Dr. Evil making his 
appearance on Earth known not by launching missiles at the Kremlin, but by 
appearing on `Jerry Springer').
        The modern society comedy is simply brilliant and really does go a 
long way to show how some things that might seem ordinary to some people can 
really be funny taken out of context. Dr. Evil's entire persona seems to be 
based on this idea here, as we see him rapping, seducing one of his female 
partners in crime, and just being a big cartoony villain. It's probably safe 
to say that he's one of the most likable villains in movie history and 
certainly one of the funniest, and we still never doubt his malice (after 
all, his name is Evil and he went to evil medical school).
        After seeing `Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,' for the first 
time, I read one some Internet newsgroups posts from people that hated it 
telling how they couldn't possibly understand how all the people around them 
laughed so much at what they considered rubbish. Technically, I could 
understand someone not liking the sense of humor the film conveys, but I 
can't imagine seeing this with an audience and not being swept up in the fun 
of it all. It's something I believe is so true in the case of  that if you 
don't like it, I'd say there's something wrong with you. </P>
