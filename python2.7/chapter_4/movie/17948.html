THE FLINTSTONES
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>These days, we are witnessing the deluge of films based on
old, cult TV shows. Most of the times, the fans of these
shows shudder thinking what could Hollywood hacks of the
present do with the memories of their past. But, some five
or six years ago, there weren't that many movies and the
trend didn't look that depressing. So, the people who, like
the author of this review, grew up watching FLINTSTONES,
popular 1960s animated series about "modern Stone Age"
family, weren't particularly worried when the word came
about live action remake. After all, the producer behind the
project was Steven Spielberg and, if anything else, at least
the special effects would be good.</P>
<P>The plot revolves about Flintstones, family set in fictious
Stone Age "town" of Bedrock, whose members enjoy the
lifestyle of 1950s middle class America. Fred Flinstone
(John Goodman) works in the quarry, and one day he helps his
best friend and neighbour Barney Rubble (Rick Moranis) and
his wife Betty (Rosie O'Donnell) to adopt a baby. To return
the favour, Barney switches his results of aptitude test
with Fred, and, based on that, Fred gets well-paid job in
management. But, of course, this is just a sham - corrupt
official Cliff Vandercave (Kyle MacLachlan) and his sultry
secretary Sharon Stone (Halle Berry) need a scapegoat for
their embezzlement scheme. In the meantime, Fred's wife
Wilma (Elizabeth Perkins) must face her mother (Elizabeth
Taylor) who can't stand Fred.</P>
<P>On the superficial level, THE FLINTSTONES did the excellent
job in bringing the animated series to life. Computer
effects are flawless, and the costumes, settings and other
details are authentic for all the fans of the show.
Unfortunately, problems with this film start with inadequate
casting - Rick Moranis is too thin for the role of Barney,
while the cartoon Betty used to be much skinnier than Rosie
O'Donnell. But the greatest problem of all is plot, or to be
precise, the lack of plot. Some thirty six screenwriters
made sure that the plot of the film is lame, original
characters one-dimensional, and many elements of the story,
like embezzlement and inter-office politics, totally
incomprehensible for the little children, the main targeted
audience of this film. Result is almost unwatchable mess,
occasionally saved mostly by excellent acting (Elizabeth
Perkins was right on mark as Wilma) and one of the classic
example of mortal Hollywood disease known as "high concept".
After great hype, movie quickly sank into oblivion and the
fans of the show returned to the animated version. All in
all, film isn't that bad, but only the hard core fans and
nostalgics can find more than guilty pleasure in it.</P>
