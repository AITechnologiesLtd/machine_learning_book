<PRE>                                  FLOUNDERING
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  James LeGros, Nelson Lyon.
Screenwriter/Director:  Peter McCarthy.</P>
<P>     John Boyz (James LeGros) is FLOUNDERING.  In the days immediately
following the Rodney King verdict riots, Los Angeles resident John is
unemployed, plagued by insomnia and filled with an overwhelming sense
of despair.  And that's the good news.  In the course of one day, John
finds his meager savings confiscated by the IRS, his unemployment
benefits cut off, his girlfriend in bed with another man and his strung
out brother in need of a $3000 detox program.  Teetering on the edge of
sanity, John finds himself on a comic odyssey dominated by the spectre
of class revolution and the visage of fascistic Police Chief Merryl
Fence (Nelson Lyon).</P>
<P>     This is the first directorial effort by Peter McCarthy, producer
of such films as REPO MAN and TAPEHEADS, and those credits should tell
you all you need to know about the style and tone of FLOUNDERING.  It's
a hilariously surreal examination of urban paranoia and hopelessness,
filled with oddball characters, goofy stream-of-consciousness narrative
and instantly quotable lines.  FLOUNDERING is told through a voiceover
narration by John, but it's not so much about John as it is about the
chaotic world around him.  John is only the tour guide, but his
observations are wonderfully off-the-wall:</P>
<P>     On the destruction in South Central L.A.:  "Maybe we should leave
it as a reminder ... then [Peter] Ueberroth will turn it into a riot
theme park."</P>
<P>     On romance:  "True love is the ultimate fiction ... if you ever
walk into a room and find yourself instantly attracted to someone, get
out of that room as fast as you can."</P>
<P>     On a sign in a bakery that reads, "Please don't feed the homeless
beggars:"  "Who the h*** should you feed?"</P>
<P>     McCarthy's script is rich with such moments.  Unfortunately, it's
also rich with heavy-handed left-wing moralizing which could easily
turn off those with differing points of view.  Characters representing
"The System," like Chief Fence and John's teacher- turned-corporate
bigwig friend Doug, are essentially cardboard cutouts used to mouth
opposing dogma.  It's therefore very fortunate that so many of the
other minor roles are so funny.  Many of them are played by "name"
actors in cameos, like John Cusack as a philosophical party-goer, Steve
Buscemi as a friend of John's angry about child slavery rings, and
Ethan Hawke as John's paranoid brother.</P>
<P>     In the middle of it all is James LeGros as John, who adopts an
appropriately blank Young Everyman quality.  He's a guy with a good
heart who finds himself overwhelmed by the apparent injustices in his
world and his feelings of powerlessness to do anything about it.  The
snapshots taken by his mental camera provide a bitingly satirical
collage of urban life, but surprisingly McCarthy doesn't opt for utter
cynicism.  Instead, he manages to balance black-humored sarcasm and
social commentary with an ultimately optimistic message of personal
responsibility.  For those who enjoy their comedy with an edge and
don't mind the occasional preaching, there's a real winner to be found
in FLOUNDERING.</P>
<P>     Besides, how can you not love a film that ends with two
guitarists, one black and one white, singing a marvelously off-key
duet of "(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding?"</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 riots:  8.</PRE>
