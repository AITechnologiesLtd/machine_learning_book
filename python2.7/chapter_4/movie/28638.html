<PRE>SCARY MOVIE 2
-------------</PRE>
<P>After the surprise success of "Scary Movie," a sequel was inevitable.  
The survivors of the first are joined by some newcomers, including Tim
Curry posing as a dream research professor right out of "The Haunting"
who wants to subject the old gang to Hell House in "Scary Movie 2." </P>
<P>"Scary Movie 2" opens with an "Exorcist" parody teaming with bodily
fluid gross-outs before the title credit comes up.  It's also the only
worthwhile part of this flabby affair.  The film got a lot of publicity
when Marlon Brando was withdrawn as the Max von Sydow character due to
heath problems.  James Woods is a hilarious replacement as the child molesting
Father McFeely, trading tongue with an unrecognizable Natasha Lyonne 
("Slums of Beverly Hills") as 'Megan.'  Ex-Conan O'Brien sidekick Andy
Richter is Father Harris, who literally ejects his mother from Megan's 
bed while Veronica Cartwright steps into Ellen Burstyn's role.  Then the
real movie begins and demonic possession suddenly seems like a better
alternative than remaining in the theater.</P>
<P>"Scary Movie" succeeded mostly because of its sheer audacity.  It went
too far, but it was funny.  This "The Haunting" parody, directed by the
first's helmer Keenen Ivory Wayans, just goes through the motions of parodying
one movie after another without any apparent stab at wit or humor.</P>
<P>Initially, Chris Elliott seems intriguing as Hell House's handyman with 
a grossly disfigured hand, but by his second scene the 'laughs' are being
forced from the same gross-out bits he was introduced with and the boredom
squirming sets in.</P>
<P>"Scary Movie 2" wastes a lot of talent (one even almost feels sorry for Tori
Spelling appearing in this mess) referencing "MI: 2," "Poltergeist," "Hollow
Man," "What Lies Beneath," etc.  Clearly this movie's demographics are those
who will feel entertained by recognizing bits from other, all better, films.</P>
