<P>You can take the girl out of the fight, but can you take the fight out of
the girl?  Well, as all of those overcoming-the-odds,
beating-the-hell-out-of-the-adversary movies of recent and past would have
us believe, no.  Instead, you can channel it, make it into a focused rage
that is capable of winning matches and perhaps even capturing a viewer's
interest for a few hours.</P>
<P>While Girlfight may result in a general sense of control and the winning of
a few matches on the behalf of this female boxer Diana (Michelle Rodregiuz),
it does not capture our interest.  In fact, this two-hour movie feels like a
three hour movie, has almost no character development to boot, and has all
of the clichéd cinematography and director that makes me wonder if these
cinematic craftsmen learned their trade off of a crackerjack box.</P>
<P>In the beginning of Girlfight, Diana goes into duke-out mode after a girl
sleeps with a guy that a friend of hers wants.  This apparently has been her
fourth fight of the semester, and the principle wants her act cleaned up or,
of course, it's expulsion.</P>
<P>Before I go on with my singular-minded tirade of why one should avoid
Girlfight at all costs, let me ask an open-ended question: how many times
have we seen this before?  Really.  Isn't this the formula for a
boxing/overcoming troubles movie: person A is really angry, gets threatened,
gets ship shape, and we all live happily ever after?</P>
<P>This formula is basically the path that Girlfight follows to the most
clichéd ending ever: slow motion hugging with a freeze frame and a
high-grain shot.  Gimme a break or break someone's neck, please.  How this
film got the Grand Jury at Sundance is beyond me.</P>
<P>Girlfight does have its nice points, however.  There is a fascinating
relationship between Diana and her father (Paul Cauldron) and Rodregiuz does
a wonderful job of expressing the trials and triumphs female boxing.  Yet
this relationship could stand a lot more development instead of the schlock
treatment it gets (only one scene actually affects you).</P>
<P>To it's credit, Girlfight goes the Raging Bull method in boxing matches,
have each fight be a quieter, well-photographed routine instead of having
each punch by a slap across the face by Thor's hammer.</P>
<P>But all of this doesn't get over the fact that Girlfight really never goes
anywhere.  When the parental conflict is resolved, the little steam that
Girlfight was running on runs dry, and you still end up being subjected to
two boring boxing matches and a helluva lot of psuedodrama before this dog
of a film finishes.  And, when the two hours are over, the only thing you'll
get out of watching Girlfight is a headache and an enjoyable period of
mutual complaints with your friends, and unless that's your idea of a
pleasant evening, neither is Girlfight.</P>
