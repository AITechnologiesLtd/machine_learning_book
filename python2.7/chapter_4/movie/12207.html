<PRE>BARB WIRE
**1/2 of **** grade is C+</PRE>
<P>Barb Wire was written off on everyone's list before it came out.  Even
mine.  To be honest, I saw the film expecting cheesy laughs and extended
looks at Pamela Anderson's chest.  I was not disappointed on either of
the counts.</P>
<P>Barb Wire is a fun rip off/update/spoof of Casablanca (!) and it stars
Pamela Anderson as Barb.  In the opening scene she twists and turns
drinched in water - clothes (what there are of them) clinging to her
body.  I imagined all the teenage boys gasping, and nodding (this will
be a cool movie).  Then it follows the plot form of Casablanca, with
modern updates and camp thrown in.  If you are farmiliar with the '42
classic you will enjoy this film more than the regular viewer.</P>
<P>Chances are that if you've seen Casablanca and are reading this review
you are a somewhat sophisticated viewer, and you know trash when you see
it.  This film is trash, and I mean that as a compliment.  You may think
of Pauline Kael, who observed: "The movies are so rarely great art, that
if we can't appreciate great trash, there is little reason to go." 
Definatly little reason to go to a rip off/update/spoof of Casablanca
staring Pamela Anderson and Pamela Anderson's cleavage.  You don't go to
this film too make an artistic discovery.</P>
<P>I would love to recomend this movie but the ending is unfun and very
slow compaired to the high energy start.  I have a place in my heart for
films like this.  Something needs to be said of a film that tries to
overcome it's disadvantages with style and heart.  This comes close to
making it, and I do recomend the film to those who think it may be your
cup of tea.</P>
<P>For you who will want to see it, you will want to know the info about
the REAL reason to see this film.  I'll help you: This film has a
suprisingly small amount of nudity provided the fact Lee is the main
star.  We get many looks at her body in SKIN TIGHT, cleavage revealing
outfits and there is a scene of her fully nude, except for soap
bubbles.  There are also at least two scenes of her breasts.  If that
sounds like it will work for you ... rent it, but keep it hid from your
parents.</P>
