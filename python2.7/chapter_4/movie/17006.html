<P>   What makes us adults the way we are?  Freud gave
considerable importance to our upbringing by our parents
during the first five years of our lives, with particular
emphasis on the emotional (and unconscious sexual)
connection from the moment of birth.  Very recent studies
have downgraded the responsibility of parents for the way we
turn out, resting the culpability almost exclusively with our
peer groups and our attempts to conform to their standards. 
As with other issues that get tossed around by intellectuals,
the truth is somewhere between.  But one thing most people
agree upon is the singnificance to many adults of their sexual
thoughts and relationships.  For all the joys that sex has
brought us, it gets us as well into heaps of trouble, as Nic
(Mike Figgis's stand-in for "The Loss of Sexual Innocence"),
discovers all too well.</P>
<P>   Mike Figgis, whose principal claim to directorial fame is his
stunning "Leaving Las Vegas"--about a man (Nicolas Cage)
determined to drink himself to death and a prostitute
(Elisabeth Shue) who demeans herself on a nightly
basis--does not simply contemplate his past quite a bit in his
latest film.  He wants to make sure that folks out there in his
movie audience share his recollections.  Since 1982 he has
planned the making of "The Loss of Sexual Innocence," but
until recently did not have the money to pull it off.  With the
revenue he drew from the success of "Vegas," he now
unfolds a picture which is difficult, challenging, and like so
many other movies that make demands on audience
attention, it rewards those who let the sounds and images of
its non-linear structure flow about them.  "The Loss of Sexual
Innocence" takes as its thesis the view that who we are is
determined largely by our sexual proclivities, thoughts, and
actions.  Figgis pushes his postulate by taking us first (via a
fictional character) to his own boyhood days in Kenya, where
he remained with his folks until he moved to northern
England at the age of eight.</P>
<P>   This is no documentary but actually a series of sharply
edited vignettes of varying intensity and a striking
soundtrack--which offers insights into the filmmaker's principal
influences, including the power that music played in his life
(he had played trumpet and guitar in rock and roll bands) and
the leverage that his stage experience bears on this film. (He
was a member of England's foremost avant-garde theatre
group, "The People Show," which toured the world and
apparently gave him the geographical breadth he puts to
such good use in this movie.)</P>
<P>   Serving up a series of short stories which exhibits the
principal character of Nic (Julian Sands--who appeared as
well in "Leaving Las Vegas") at the age of five, at twelve, at
sixteen, and as a fully grown man--Figgis frequently cuts for
allegorical purpose to biblical scenes of Adam (Femi
Ogumbanjo) and Eve (Hanne Klintoe) both at the time of their
sexual innocence and after they accepted that offer from a
notorious snake.  </P>
<P>   Figgis opens the film with a sudden, commanding close-up
view of the five-year-old Nic (John Cowey), a blond,
intelligent, curious young man who symbolically gets his first
abbreviated inkling of an approaching sexual life by peeping
into an African hut and spying on a half-dressed young
woman slowly practicing her English while an old man sits in
a chair, seemingly oblivious.  The first of the surreal images
in the story--essentially highlighting a father's guarding his
daughter's or granddaughter's innocence--prefigures an
incident that occurs in Nic's teen years, when he makes out
with his girl friend Susan (Kelly MacDonald) only to be
interrupted by the gruff presence of Susan's father (Bernard
Hill).  </P>
<P>   Now married to a disappointed woman (Johanna Torell),
Nic enjoys memories of sexual episodes of his earlier days. 
At one point he sexually embraces his wife when he is
interrupted by an important phone call, while we imagine that
many other hugs will be intruded upon by the demands of
their child. Sexual thoughts dominate dreams as well. The
wife dreams of performing a strip tease to the beats of a jazz
piano while Nic conjures up a flirtation with an Italian woman
(Saffron Burrows) and as she, her boy friend Luca (Stefano
Dionisi) and Nic travel across the Tunisian desert to do a film.</P>
<P>   The connection between Adam and Eve's loss of sexual
innocence after their partaking of the fruit offered by the
snake and the deprivation of Nic's own chastity does not
exactly strike us in the face.  The Bible is a book of
enormous literary value,  offering not simply lessons to guide
our modern lives but parallels as well.  Demonstrating that
correlation is a difficult job at best, but Figgis has broken new
ground in his original film, one which is filled with a dramatic
soundtrack (recorded by Figgis himself), startling and
beautiful imagery (particularly of the Blue People of Tunisia),
and a compelling cast led by the handsome and magnetic
Julian Sands.</P>
<P>   Photographer Benoit Delhomme has done a remarkable
job of capturing the desolation of southern Tunisia's Saharan
region, Italy's Umbria region and the northern English city of
Newcastle which is, not surprisingly in the region of the town
of Carlisle which was Mike Figgis's birthplace.</P>
