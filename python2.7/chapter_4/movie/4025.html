<PRE>                                    HACKERS
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     HACKERS is more techno-paranoia from Hollywood, instilling the
fear of rampaging computer geeks into America once again in yet another
take on 1983's WARGAMES.  Twelve years later, the game is a little
different:  the bad guys are big business types instead of the
government, the good guys have dreadlocks and multiple body piercings,
and the computers can do full motion video over a phone line.</P>
<P>     Okay, so some liberties have been taken with technology (an Intel
P6 chip powers an Apple PowerBook), but at least the terminology the
hackers use is essentially right.  The story may sound familiar.  Bad
corporate computer dude Eugene aka Plague (Fisher Stevens) and his
accomplice (Lorraine Bracco) team up for a little multi-million dollar
theft, when a bunch of young punks stumble upon the plan.  The gaggle
of teen-aged of hackers includes Dade aka Crash Override (Jonny Lee
Miller), Kate aka Acid Burn (Angelina Jolie), and the show-stealing
Cereal Killer (Matthew Lillard), among others.  Together, the hackers
have to foil the theft and avoid having numerous felony charges pinned
on them, plus save the world from ecological disaster thanks to a
Plague-written virus that capsizes oil tankers.</P>
<P>     Whatever.  The plot is pretty silly, thanks in part to the
combined efforts of the ridiculous Stevens-Bracco combination, who you
just can't stop laughing at.  And of course, the premise is absurd,
placing technology we probably won't see for another 15 years in the
hands of kids.  Every hacker worth his salt knows that it just isn't
that easy to crack systems.  At least Matthew Broderick had to resort
to a lot of research.</P>
<P>     But this is all beside the point, because the film is actually
worthwhile.  The real draw to HACKERS is that it is so unexpectedly
*funny.*  Really funny.  The comic scenes with the kids (and there are
lots of them) are totally hilarious.  The "serious" scenes are too,
because they are often so ridiculous.  Watching the woefully miscast
Bracco trying to pull off her role as "the sultry executive accessory
to the crime" is worth the cost of admission alone.</P>
<P>     In the end, seeing HACKERS is a lot like watching MTV for two
hours.  There's not a lot under the surface, the music is fast and
loud, the camera shakes around a lot, but it's really colorful and
generally fun.</P>
