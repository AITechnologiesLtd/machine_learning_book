CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>Those who don't approve current "humanitarian" bombing of
rump Yugoslavia often refer it as "Clinton's War". Whether
their argument is valid or not, the fact remains that U.S.
administration, and its chief executive, have enormous
powers at its disposal. Those powers, as any other, can be
abused and the consequences of those abuses can be
disastrous or even apocalyptic, not only for those directly
affected, but for the rest of world, America included. One
of the rare Hollywood movies that tries to cover that
subject and deal with the murky line between long-term
national and selfish political interest is CLEAR AND PRESENT
DANGER, 1994 spy thriller and third in the series of movies
based on the novels by Tom Clancy.</P>
<P>The movie begins when U.S. Coast Guard intercepts the yacht
of wealthy American businessman and discovers the evidence
of massacre. It turns out that the businessman used to be
close friend of President Bennett (Donald Moffat), while in
the same time having links with Colombian drug lords.
Infuriated because of his friend's death, President orders
secret war and assassination campaign to be conducted
against drug cartel led by Ernesto Escobedo (Miguel
Sandoval). In the meantime, CIA analyst Jack Ryan (Harrison
Ford) becomes the deputy for his mortally ill boss, Admiral
Greer (James Earl Jones). While investigating the series of
violent events in Colombia, that start claiming toll in
American lives, he discovers the evidence of US government's
complicity. Facing both by drug lords and unscrupulous
politicians and top bureaucrats in Washington, Ryan would do
anything in his power to uncover the scandal and save his
country and men from harm.</P>
<P>Although having the screenplay written by three different
authors (John Millius, Donald Stewart and Steve Zaillian),
CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER, like very few movies in
contemporary Hollywood, has a very complex, yet interesting
and compelling plot. Unlike other two movies about Tom
Clancy's hero Jack Ryan, this one doesn't present the bright
post-Cold War picture of the world dominated by omnipotent
American technology and military might. On the contrary, the
film shows that even that power has limits, and biggest
limit of them all is the fact that behind the super-weaponry
lies the hand of human who can be imperfect and incompetent.
As a result, unlike most of the films in the action genre,
this one is dark, depressive and sometimes even disturbing,
and the happy ending is hardly unambiguous.</P>
<P>Director Philip Noyce, whose best work so far is an
excellent thriller DEAD CALM, worked with the script very
well. Action scenes are very well shot, and movie cleverly
paced, not allowing boredom for the viewers through the
almost two and half hours of its time. Characters, on the
other hand, seem a little bit card-board, but in films like
this, they are secondary element. Anyway, this film has
great acting names in small roles, but although they don't
put their best efforts (including Ford, who probably
couldn't do much with such straightforward hero), they do a
fine job. Balance between cerebral and physical action is
very well done. Unfortunately, film in the end changes its
character - interesting, thought-provoking political
thriller is downgraded with the finale in which we must
suspend disbelief and see humble CIA bureaucrat Jack Ryan as
Rambo-style action hero. The impression is even worsened
with melodramatic scenes in the end, when Jack Ryan shows
his patriotic moral superiority of a civil servant over
pragmatic politicians. Those who know how the real world
operates would have some trouble believing those scenes in
the end. But, even with such flaws, CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER
is a very fine piece of seldom seen brain candy from
Hollywood.</P>
