<PRE>                                    BLUE SKY
                       A film review by Raymond Johnston
                        Copyright 1994 Raymond Johnston</PRE>
<P>Dir: Tony Richardson
Starring: Tommy Lee Jones, Jessica Lange, Powers Booth, Carrie Snodgrass</P>
<P>     After sitting on the shelf for several years due to Orion's
financial difficulties, British director Tony Richardson's final film
has gotten released.  Richardson was once one of the "angry young men"
of British cinema.  His work includes LOOK BACK IN ANGER, THE LOVED ONE,
TOM JONES, and the occasional Hollywood project like THE BORDER.</P>
<P>     Richardson always tried to find the human element to his stories,
tried to tell compassionate tales of middle-class struggle.  When the ad
campaign for BLUE SKY described a "Manchurian-Candidate" type
conspiracy film, I thought that Richardson was a poor choice for such a
story.  Again, though, it is a case of a distributor trying to mislead
the audience.  BLUE SKY is not a paranoid cold war conspiracy film.
There is a minor subplot near the end that has been edited into a neat
ad campaign, but the film is really about a dysfunctional military
family trying to get things together.</P>
<P>     Once you stop waiting for the conspiracy to turn up, the film is
quite enjoyable for what it is.  It has flaws to be sure.  The concept of
a dysfunctional military family is fairly much of a film cliche, but
Richardson manages to show some things that have not been seen before,
and make the characters at least seem human.</P>
<P>     Tommy Lee Jones is a military nuclear scientist, whose less than
right wing stance has hindered his career, and Jessica Lange is his
movie star wanna-be wife, whose open exhibitionism has also caused its
share of scandals.  Lange gets a chance to develop a full blooded
character, a woman who seems so full of anger at her lost dreams that
she is bent on self destruction.  Jones, in relatively laid back
performance, juggles his waning career and two adolescent daughters as
he tries to also deal with his marriage and the Atomic Energy
Commission.  It is out of this last element that the conspiracy ad
campaign has been cobbled.  Forget that angle.  As a conspiracy film,
BLUE SKY is second-rate.  As a family drama, BLUE SKY scores much
better, with some fresh scenes and excellent performances.</P>
<P>     Cris O'Donnell, the student from SCENT OF A WOMAN plays Power
Boothe's son.  BLUE SKY was filmed before, and he appears younger than
in his previous role.  The inevitable teenage love story has some sweet
and one explosively funny scene.</P>
<P>       If conspiracy films are your bag, rent Abel Ferrara's
BODYSNATCHERS, Alan J. Pakula's PARALLAX VIEW, or Sydney Pollack's
THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR.  They deliver what the ads for this film
promise.  If you like good actors in a decent enough drama, give BLUE
SKY a shot.</P>
