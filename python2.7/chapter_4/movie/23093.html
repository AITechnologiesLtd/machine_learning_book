<P>GHOST DOG: THE WAY OF THE SAMURAI
A film review by Athan Bezaitis.  Copyright Filmcritic.com 2000</P>
<P>Written and directed by Jim Jarmusch, GHOST DOG: THE WAY OF THE SAMURAI
embodies a variety of genres from Mobster to Urban to Martial Arts.
Jarmusch, critically acclaimed for MYSTERY TRAIN (1989) and STRANGER
THAN PARADISE (1984), stays true to his uniquely languid and methodical
style in telling the fascinating story of Ghost Dog (Forest Whitaker -
THE CRYING GAME, PHENOMENON), a contract killer who has isolated himself
from society by taking refuge in a shack atop an inner city rooftop that
he shares with a flock of pigeons.</P>
<P> Ghost Dog studies the early eighteenth century Japanese warrior code
from the book, Hagakure: The Way of the Samurai, and the story is told
as a sequence of verses from the ancient text.  Each morning he bows to
the altar he has constructed and practices the ancient disciplines of
the samurai training.  In the spirit of the ancient warriors, he has
pledged his loyalty to a single master, a small-time mobster named Louie
(John Tormey - KISS ME GUIDO, JUNGLE 2 JUNGLE), who saved Ghost Dog's
life when he was young.  As an assassin, Ghost Dog communicates only via
carrier pigeon and moves through the night like a phantom, killing with
the skill and speed of a true Samurai.</P>
<P> Louie is a foot soldier in a struggling and aging crime family headed
by Ray Vargo (Henry Silva).  Acting on orders, Louie hires Ghost Dog to
kill Handsome Frank (Richard Portnow), a "made man" and lover of the
boss' daughter Louise (Tricia Vessey).  Unfortunately, Louise happens to
be in Frank's apartment when Ghost Dog offs Handsome Frank, and now the
infuriated mob boss Vargo wants the hit-man dead.  Using the wisdom and
insight that he has learned from Hagakure and other ancient Eastern
books, Ghost Dog must now confront the notorious crime family, or die.</P>
<P>Jarmusch's signature of inimitable characters with distinctive humor is
apparent throughout, as both the mobsters and Ghost Dog are ruthless yet
remain loveable.  The film's score is a compilation of hip-hop and
reggae beats done by The Rza, Wu Tang Clan's founder, and it effectively
underscores Ghost Dog's ascetic spirituality along with the harsh tones
of the surrounding urban environment.  The story is well written, and
Forest Whitaker's performance is moving.  Also noteworthy is the jovial,
French, ice cream vendor, Raymond (Isaach de Bankole).  Raymond doesn't
understand a word of English, and Ghost Dog doesn't speak any French,
yet the two have a platonic understanding of one another that lets them
speak, despite the language barrier.</P>
<P>On the flip side, my only qualm is that the film is too slow at certain
points and may have benefited from some good editing.  Also, Ghost Dog's
stroll is appropriately meticulous in keeping with the method of the
Samurai, but towards the end, I was fed up with his overly deliberate
pace.</P>
<P>All in all, I highly recommend GHOST DOG -- it is truly an original.  No
other filmmaker has made such a bold statement about the parallels of
societal violence that exist between cultures, whether Ancient Eastern,
Mafioso, or Urban gangster.  Fans of any of the three genres will be
sure to enjoy this one.</P>
