<P>Impresario Phillip Henslow (Geoffrey Rush) is very concerned. He has 
outstanding debts and his theatre, the Rose, lies idle while his young 
playwright, William Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) dithers about finishing 
his latest work, a comedy called Romeo and Ethel, A Pirate's Adventure'. 
To make matters worse, his chief creditor, Fennyman (Tom Wilkinson) 
expresses his dissatisfaction by dangling Henslow over an open fire, and 
threatens worse if his debts are not swiftly repaid.
So begins Shakespeare in Love, a gloriously witty, piquant and 
unashamedly theatrical yarn of the creation of the play Romeo and 
Juliet, one of the most famous and touching stories in literature (in 
English, anyway). Shakespeare is suffering from writer's block - he 
needs a muse, and (with his wife safely stashed in the country), he 
casts his eye around but is not impressed by the women he sees. His mood 
is not helped by the fact that everyone wants a comedy (whereas he would 
like to create something more worthy) and his fierce rival, Marlowe 
(Rupert Everett) is enjoying critical and popular acclaim.
Everything changes when Shakespeare sees Viola De Lessops (Gwyneth 
Paltrow), the beautiful daughter of a wealthy aristocrat. Viola is also 
a fan of theatre and particularly of the sonnets of a promising young 
playwright called Shakespeare. They eventually meet and fall deeply in 
love. Unfortunately, Viola has been promised in marriage to the 
insufferably arrogant Lord Wessex (Colin Firth), a union approved by 
Queen Elizabeth (Judi Dench), and therefore insoluble. As Shakespeare 
begins shaping his play, its character changes from comedy to drama to 
outright tragedy, as it mirrors the impossible but all-consuming love 
affair between a poor commoner and a rich aristocrat.
The movie skilfully weaves two rather different stories into a dramatic 
and beautiful tale. The first one is a hilarious account of the struggle 
to put on a show and I wish Kenneth Branagh had seen this film before he 
inflicted The Bleak Midwinter on the rest of us. There are lots of sly 
jokes as applicable to the film industry today as theatre then or now. 
Such as the decision to give the actors a share of the profits rather 
than paying them.(Henslow explains, "But it will never make money" and 
Fennyman replies, "Exactly"). Spoken like a true producer. Indeed, a 
wager is made that art cannot move people in the same way as real life - 
that art is lightweight and artificial. Viola disagrees - true art will 
always touch people. A dig at the entertainment industry today, perhaps 
?
There is always a danger that attempting humour in a medieval setting 
will invoke memories of Monty Python or Blackadder, but the writers 
(Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard) avoid such pitfalls. They do have fun 
speculating on the sources of Shakespeare's inspiration. He hears a 
preacher shouting at the unheeding, passing crowd, "A plague on both 
your houses". He decides on some of the plot while out drinking with 
Marlowe. What really illuminates the story, (and provides most of the 
inspiration) and raises it above the ordinary, is the on-screen 
relationship of Voila and Shakespeare. Joseph Fiennes brings a 
passionate intensity to the young Shakespeare, and his character, 
mischievous, committed, determined, impatient and erudite, is convincing 
as the man who could only conjure such emotions in his works by having 
tasted such extremes of desire.
The object of his desire has never looked better. Women world-wide must 
be a bit disgruntled. Having spent years reading women's magazines 
assuring them that "You too are special in your own way" along come 
women like Cameron Diaz and Gwyneth Paltrow, who are beautiful, 
talented, critically acclaimed, hugely popular and filthy rich. It's not 
good for morale. It's easy to see why Shakespeare would risk his life to 
see her - she looks sublime. With her long golden curls and delicate 
features, she calls to mind Botticelli's Birth of Venus. Paltrow's Viola 
is also strong-willed, intelligent and romantic. She also has (yet 
again) a faultless English accent (at this stage, she's just showing off 
). The prurient amongst you may also appreciate the fact that she strips 
off - rest assured it's in the best possible taste.
The supporting cast are uniformly solid - Ben Affleck as the egotistical 
actor playing Mercutio (who can't believe he gets killed off early), 
Dench as the Queen (wryly amused by the prospect of Wessex being 
cuckolded by a penniless artist), and Wilkinson and Rush as the 
producers. 
The movie, though sumptuous in terms of costume and scenery, makes no 
real claim at veracity whatsoever, and one suspects that Shakespeare's 
antics, as portrayed, would have shortened his life considerably in 
reality. There are some minor quibbles - some of the humour is a little 
farfetched - but these are very minor distractions. What is refreshing 
is that a movie such as this can get made in the first place. As we 
approach the 1999 Oscars, Gwyneth Paltrow must surely get at least a 
nomination for her performance. Funnily enough, one of her rivals may 
well be Cate Blanchett for her portrayal of...Queen Elizabeth.
