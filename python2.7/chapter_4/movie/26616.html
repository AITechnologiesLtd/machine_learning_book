THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>One of the great things about movie reviewing is the
diversity of opinion. One man's masterpiece is another man's
junk, both of them are entitled to express their views and
this is how the things are supposed to be. However, the
author of this review, although he tries to live by those
principles, recollects some situations when he was tempted
to sacrifice his personal dissent for the sake of
conformity. One of such situations happened with the film
which is now considered to be one of the greatest films ever
made and which happens to hold top spots in Internet Movie
Database polls for years. Sheer numbers - high marks, plenty
of people giving those high marks and the amount of time
when the film holds the top spot - often give impression of
the overwhelming force that single, dissenting reviewer
shouldn't oppose. Thankfully, when I first encountered THE
SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, 1994 prison drama by Frank Darabont, I
wasn't aware of that. Initial high rating in Internet Movie
Database didn't impress me; I thought that the enthusiasm
for the film is equal to those that elevated titles like THE
ROCK into Top 10 of IMDb and that it would vanish through
time. I was wrong, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is now one of
the most popular films of the past decade, but that
nevertheless didn't prevent me from keeping maintain my
original appraisal of the film.</P>
<P>Frank Darabon't screenplay for THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is
based on the Stephen King's story RITA HAYWORTH AND THE
SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, Plot begins in 1946 when young
Portland banker Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins) gets
sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife
and her lover. Dufresne maintains his innocence but for the
next few decades he would have to deal with more practical
issues in Shawshank prison, all observed through the eyes of
Ellis Boyd "Red" Redding (played by Morgan Freeman), another
"lifer" who runs prison's black market and who would
gradually become Dufresne's best friend. For the first years
of his imprisonment, quiet ex-banker is ridiculed by general
prison population and often assaulted by the gang of prison
rapists led by Bogs (played by Mark Ralston). His fortune
changes when he offers his accounting services to sadistic
prison guard Captain Byron Handley (played by Clancy Brown).
Soon his boss, Bible- thumping yet utterly corrupt warden
Samuel Norton (played by Bob Gunton) hires Dufresne as his
personal accountant, and in exchange for his help with
embezzlement, kickbacks, tax evasion and other illegal
activities, he gets library job and other privileges. But
Dufresne also uses his new position in order to improve the
prison library and help making life easier for other
prisoners. However, although the life behind bars gets
better through the years, Dufresne doesn't stop dreaming
about freedom.</P>
<P>At first glance, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION looks like a very
good film and could be hardly associated with first-time
director. The dark, depressive atmosphere of the prison
affects the viewers through the efforts of cinematographer
Roger Deakins, soundtrack composer Thomas Newman and good
use of old, defunct real life prison locations. The acting
is also great. Tim Robbins is good as quiet, enigmatic
character whose agenda remains the mystery until the very
end, while Freeman gives truly superb performance as cynical
prisoner who is going to experience change of heart. Two of
them have great chemistry together, but the supporting cast
is also very good and it ranges from veterans like James
Whitmore in very touching role of an old "institutionalised"
prisoner to Bob Gunton who often played villains, but hardly
so convincingly as in this film. But the best thing about
THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is Darabont's decision to employ
old-fashioned film techniques and not allow time constraints
to stand in the way of the storytelling. His indirect
approach, based on narration and quick flashbacks, works
fine in this film, allowing the audience to envision decades
spent behind bars more easily.</P>
<P>Taking all this into account, the author of this often
wondered whether his disappointment with THE SHAWSHANK
REDEMPTION had something to do with the subject matter and
the prison experience from his own past. However, after a
while, I came to the conclusion that there isn't direct
connection between the two. Fortunately, my time behind bars
was negligibly short compared with the protagonists of this
film and circumstances were completely different. So, the
reasons why I don't share other people's enthusiasm for this
film come from my perception of flaws in the film itself.
First, although the characters in this film are memorable,
they nevertheless belong to prison movie cliches - sadistic
guards, gang rapists, corrupt warden, protagonist's mentor
who "runs" the prison. Cliches later come in some scenes
that are supposed to be "meaningful" (like Dufresne playing
Mozart via loudspeakers) but in the end look trite and
overmanipulative. All that culminates in the last segments
of the film when Darabont tries too hard to wrap things up
with a neat little happy ending, which comes at the expense
of realism and looks too much like a deus ex machina. So,
what was supposed to be gritty but uplifting prison drama
ends like a standard Hollywood fairytale. However, THE
SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is terribly overrated, but its pluses
nevertheless outweigh minuses so the potential audience
shouldn't be discouraged from watching it and making their
own mind about its quality.</P>
