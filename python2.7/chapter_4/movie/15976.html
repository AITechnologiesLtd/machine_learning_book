<PRE>                              PATCH ADAMS
                      A film review by Bradley Null
                       Copyright 1999 Bradley Null</PRE>
<P>Ironically, what I was most excited about seeing in PATCH ADAMS is what
eventually left me feeling cheated by it in the end.  After seeing the
trailers, I knew I was going to get Robin Williams playing that lovably
sensitive, extremely funny man, that shows people there's more to life. 
You know, the guy from DEAD POETS SOCIETY and GOOD WILL HUNTING.  I love
that guy; probably because he had truly inspired me before.  And things
were going so well for the first two-thirds of this movie too.  Until it
was over and I thought to myself, "Wait, I think I've seen this movie
before."</P>
<P>In the end, my impression of PATCH ADAMS is that is has some really
funny scenes, and you can't help but fall in love with the guy when he's
doing all of these great things, a lot of which you have probably seen
in the trailers.  And he has a lot to teach everyone he comes into
contact with in the film.  So throughout I'm thinking, "What a great
guy; I wish I was more like him."  Which is always a good set-up.  But
it never follows through.  The dramatic conclusion falls flat, and based
on a true story or not, the plot points are a bit cliched.  PATCH ADAMS
is a comedy, but more appropriately it would be classified as an
inspirational film.  And the hallmark of the inspirational film is that
climactic scene at the end where the inspirational character takes a
stand and is met by stiff consequences, but ultimately we realize that
he made a difference.  You see it in DEAD POETS SOCIETY in the "Oh
Captain, my captain" scene.  In PATCH ADAMS though, it never comes. 
Though Patch does take an emotional stand at the end in a scene that
tries to steal the emotion of a film like DEAD POETS SOCIETY, I don't
know that we're convinced that he truly made a difference.  He is a
great guy, yes, but maybe not great enough.</P>
