<PRE>                                PULP FICTION
                       A film review by Nizam U. Ahmed
                        Copyright 1995 Nizam U. Ahmed</PRE>
<P>     Don't believe the hype.  Quentin Tarantino's loud, brash and
supercool crime pic is certainly entertaining and a real crowd-pleaser,
but no way is the cult reputatation that has built up around it
deserved.</P>
<P>     Tarantino is now being hailed as the catalyst of a new wave of
motion picture director: cine-literate, streetwise and able to meld the
best elements of popular culture with the film-making craft of the
auteurs.  Erm, excuse me, but hasn't his been said about every new
"shining star" whenever a debut feature is critically acclaimed? Making
entertaining, violent films is certainly not a monopoly for Tarantino:
the Joel Silver bandwagon has been doing exactly that throughout the
eighties.  Having a grip on popular culture is also hardly a great
achievement.  Is there some reason why mentioning McDonalds and Pop
Tarts in a script makes it suddenly profound? Worst of all, a band of
pseudo-intellectuals obviously weened on the MODERN REVIEW, Julie
Burchill and Tony Parsons, have acclaimed it as a masterpiece.
Hypocritically, they heap abuse on FORREST GUMP for being too populist,
yet PULP FICTION only exists to please a slightly-more-cynical market
segment.</P>
<P>     Right from the start, Tarantino throws every movie trick in the
book at you.  Hey, let's start with a scene from the end of the film,
and muddle up the time sequence of the stories--the senile film
reviewers love all that stuff!  Let's have nice, slow camera movements
and an anally retentive ultra-detailed look at everything our two
hitmen protagonists get up to.  They spend seemingly hours in the car
on the way to their first job, spouting their supposedly brilliantly
witty dialogue.  It seems to have been overlooked that half this
dialogue is muffled and is barely audible, and the other half is not
particularly amusing or interesting anyway.  One particularly dull
sequence involves boxer Butch (Bruce Willis) dressing, talking to his
partner.  So what?  Why should the audience be in the slightest bit
interested in the boring chatter of Butch and Fabienne, or in Butch's
dress sense? The film is peppered with these long, drawn-out showcases
for Mr Tarantino's god-like gift for dialogue....</P>
<P>     There *is* fun to be had however.  Tarantino's overblown
pretentious directing style is extremely annoying, he seems to believe
the press he has been receiving, which as we all know signals the death
of talent.  The essential storylines are good, simple tales with plenty
of black humour for those with sick minds.  The entire cast performs
well, signifying one of Tarantino's rare strengths, coaxing good
performances from everyone on set.  Samuel L. Jackson and John
Travolta shine as Jules and Vince.  There are enough gunshots, fights
and blood to please all action-lovers, and a supreme scene of
humiliation and then revenge involving Butch and Mr. Big Marsellus in
a hee-haw gunshop.  The final sequence is not as powerful as Tarantino
would want, but there is certainly plenty of fun on the way.</P>
<P>     So no way is this An Artistic Triumph, or indeed, one of the best
films of the 90's.  It is simply an entertainment that provides its
fair share of laughs, groans and cheers, but has ideas above it's
station: a "pulp" film as the title suggests that thinks it can become
a "classic."  Sadly, it can't, and Quentin Tarantino's attempts to hide
its flaws through quirkiness and a 90's feel, while fooling many
people, left me unsatisfied.</P>
