<PRE>Wag The Dog</PRE>
<PRE>Chad'z rating: *** (out of 4 = good)</PRE>
<P>1997, R, 95 minutes [1 hour, 35 minutes]</P>
<PRE>[satire]</PRE>
<P>starring: Dustin Hoffman (Stanley Motss), Robert De Niro (Conrad Brean), Anne
Heche (Winifred Ames), Denis Leary (Fad King), written by Hilary Henkin, David
Mamet; produced by Robert De Niro, Barry Levinson, Jane Rosenthal; directed by
Barry Levinson; based on the novel "American Hero" by Larry Beinhart.</P>
<P>        Satirical films usually fall into one of two categories: 1) long-term satire
where everything, including the jokes, is somehow related on a large scale
(i.e. "Dr. Strangelove"; 2) situation satire in which the comedy and themes
are derived moment by moment and scene by scene (i.e. "Men In Black"). What's
unique about "Wag The Dog" is that it doesn't necessarily fit either of these
descriptions, and yet is both at the same time. The result is a clever comedy
based on an original, smart premise, even if the focus does tend to wander a
bit.</P>
<P>        If there's anything that affects Americans the most it's politics and
showbusiness. In this age of information and technology, we've been so
conditioned by the media and the entertainment industry in our ways of
perceiving things, it's gotten to the point that we are practically controlled
by it. We need the media to bring us the most up-to-date news, but we also
need the escapism of Hollywood to counter all that thinking. This film starts
off well by quickly establishing these ideas, and then presents an interesting
scenario: if politics, the media coverage of politics, and the entertainment
industry are so closely related, couldn't someone with the power and authority
to manipulate one of the aspects manipulate them all? That's the idea Conrad
Brean (De Niro), a professional Washington spin doctor, comes up with in order
to restore the president's good name who has been accused of child molestation
just weeks before the election.</P>
<P>        Brean, along with the president's top advisor, Winifred Ames (Heche), fly to
California to meet up with hot-shot movie producer Stanley Motss (Hoffman).
They pitch him an idea to "produce" the image of a war with Albania (it's a
country no one's heard of so they people will buy it). Soon the wheels are in
motion and the film's riffing satire comes into play. We're inundated with the
Hollywood mind set as Motss brings in a number of experts to help manage the
situation, such as a folk singer, visual and sound effects technicians, and a
modern style expert known as the Fad King (Leary). </P>
<P>        The initial atmosphere is rich with numerous pop culture references where
everything somehow relates to something on TV, in the movies, or in the news.
The characters' dialogue is witty and funny, although some of the actual jokes
and gags seem rather sitcom-esque. For example, one scene shows Motss and
Brean's production crew filming an actress portraying a poor Albanian refugee.
Motss ordered a kitten for the girl to carry, but instead wound up with a
dozen different dogs. Since it's all computer-enhanced anyway, she ends up
cradling a bag of Tostitos with the kitten to be inserted later. This
demonstrates the film's ability to take a relatively ordinary situation and
make it smart and funny just through the premise. But then there's the gags
and one-liners that, although are humorous, seem a little gratuitious in the
long run such as Motss not being able to remember the actress's name, or,
whenever a problem emerges, always responding with,"This is nothing!"</P>
<P>        By the time the film makes it to the midpoint, everything that is going to
happen in terms of plot happens. The first act is quickly paced, while the
second act contains most of the jokes and is the core of the film. Every ten
minutes or so a new problem crops up that Motss and Brean must deal with, and
it's always fascinating to see what they do and how they do it. The screenplay
provides good characterization and actually deals with most of the problems
head-on in realistic manners. However, it does have a tendency to avoid things
and shift its focus from the election campaign and false war smokescreen to
something a bit off the subject.                 </P>
<P>        As the third act rolls around the satirical nature becomes more concerned
with the situations and less so with the big picture. What had started off as
a brilliant, somewhat harmless conspiracy to fool the general public begins to
seem more like something that would happen in a movie. Still, the situation
comedy is quite funny, especially a montage showing the entire country
flinging old shoes into trees to honor Sgt. Willie Schumann - a war hero Motss
and Brean concocted.</P>
<P>        Truly great satire manages to create for an entertaining story that makes you
laugh at the time, but think about afterwards and "Wag The Dog" at least
succeeds in this respect. However, in retrospect it seems like so much more
could have been done, namely by extending the running time and filling in the
plot holes. Then again, it's a valiant effort.</P>
