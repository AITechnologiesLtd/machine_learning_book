<P>Oh, what a debt the cinema owes to lousy father and son relationships. 
Between the films about sons trying to reconcile with Dad, dads trying to 
reconcile with sons, and young men seeking father figures because Dad is 
either dead or just too damn mean, this angst-filled genre has produced a 
number of fine movies, providing welcome vicarious catharsis for tortured 
males the world over.</P>
<P>"Smoke Signals" is the latest addition to the bad Dad genre, enlivened 
with a healthy dose of good humor. Written by Sherman Alexie, from his 
caustic short-story collection "The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in 
Heaven," the film centers on Victor Joseph (Adam Beach) and Thomas Builds-
the-Fire (Evan Adams), two Coeur d'Alene Indians living on an Idaho 
reservation. When word arrives that Victor's father, who deserted his 
wife and son years earlier, has died, the young men head for Phoenix to 
collect his remains.</P>
<P>Though far from friends, Victor and Thomas have shared a connection since 
childhood, when Victor's father Arnold (Gary Farmer) saved the baby 
Thomas from a fire that killed his parents. Victor grew up sullen and 
stoic, while Thomas became the Native American Urkel. Wearing pigtails, 
black-framed glasses and a constant goofy grin, Thomas tells mythic tales 
of his heritage over and over in a peculiar sing-song voice. He irritates 
the hell out of Victor, who grudgingly allows him to come on the journey 
only because Thomas has the travel funds Victor lacks.</P>
<P>With its mismatched-pair-on-a-road-trip structure and estranged father 
and son subtext, "Smoke Signals" covers very familiar turf, but does so 
with style, punctuating the men's trip with illuminating flashbacks to 
their childhoods. The easygoing film has real charm, thanks to winning 
performances and Alexie's eye for character detail.</P>
<P>In the early scenes at the reservation, he establishes an agreeably 
quirky feel, reminiscent of the "Northern Exposure" TV series. The KREZ 
morning deejay greets listeners with "It's a good day to be indigenous" 
before cutting to a man perched on his broken-down truck at a dusty 
intersection, who offers amusing deadpan bulletins like "Big truck just 
went by. Now it's gone" over his cell-phone. Victor and Thomas exchange 
pleasantries with two young women who cruise the reservation driving in 
reverse, apparently the only gear that works on their car. Elaine Miles, 
the enigmatic Marilyn from "Northern Exposure," is one of the women. 
Cynthia Geary, who played Shelly on the show, also pops in later, further 
underscoring the stylistic connection to the series.</P>
<P>Colorful townfolks aside, the heart of the film is the relationship 
between Victor and Thomas, thankfully two very well-rounded and 
intriguing characters. Adam Beach does fine work adding shadings to 
Victor's tortured soul, and Evan Adams is a revelation as the peculiar, 
but extremely engaging Thomas. Just when you're about to write off the 
young man as a hapless loon, he says something quite insightful. And just 
as you begin to respect his off-the-wall wisdom, he blurts out some 
wildly clueless statement. Such a beguiling odd duck.</P>
<P>As the details about Victor's father slowly emerge, things change for 
both men. The revelations and life-lessons in "Smoke Signals" are nothing 
new, but they resonate anyway, because the dialogue rings true and the 
characters are so credible. </P>
<P>Presented with both the Audience Award and the Filmmakers Trophy at the 
1998 Sundance Film Festival, "Smoke Signals" is a ragged, but disarming 
little film. In a cinematic climate overflowing with character-deficient 
event movies, it's nice to see an unassuming work about actual human 
beings come up a winner for a change.</P>
