         - Pitt to Slater</PRE>
<P>     INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE is a triumph of tone--a masterpiece of
mood where atmosphere is everything.  Like, say, Tim Burton's BATMAN,
the sum here is more impressive than the parts.  Forget the
scavenger-hunt story and the lethargic line readings of Brad Pitt, Neil
Jordan's follow-up to THE CRYING GAME oozes with enough malice to send
even the toughest talk show host screaming.</P>
<P>     Anne Rice adapts her 1976 novel about a pair of 18th Century
vampires to questionable effect.  Her dialogue is rich, but cumbersome,
and the actors stumble through it better than they should.  Best of the
bunch is Kirsten Dunst, playing an Orleans orphan taken under the wing
of the vampires. She'll get a nomination.  Brad Pitt's a loss as Louis
(Vampire #1), but Tom Cruise is toothy fun as his amoral, arrogant
mentor, Lestat.  Too bad he disappears in the second hour, though.  His
replacement (the smoldering Antonio Banderas) barely registers as a
character.</P>
<P>     The hide-and-seek story doesn't explain all of what's happening
on-screen, suggesting that an earlier cut of the film was more coherent
than what's presented here.  Someone in the producer's chair probably
pruned this baby in the interest of streamlining.  INTERVIEW WITH THE
VAMPIRE feels rushed at 122 minutes and forces the viewer to
extrapolate the finer plot plots.  Not good.</P>
<P>     Condensing the story kills most of the visceral kicks, as well.
In the second hour, for example, there's no build-up to the fiery
finale; what should be a potent climax is little more than an amusing
set piece.</P>
<P>     Dante Ferretti's production design is a feast for the eyes; he's
just one of the many top technicians who expertly drain the life from
this story of death.  One question: who's responsible for all the
muted dialogue?  Don't be surprised if you miss half of what's said.</P>
<PRE>BOTTOM LINE:    Rushed at 122 minutes, it's still the best vampire movie
                since Kathryn Bigelow's NEAR DARK.</PRE>
