<PRE>Gaslight (1944)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 62</PRE>
<P>"Gaslight" is a remake of the 1940 mystery and
suspense thriller.  It is an interesting film,
with a strong cast and competent direction.</P>
<P>"Gaslight" stars Ingrid Bergman as an impressionable
young woman, newlywed to cunning Charles Boyer.
Oddly, Boyer takes no physical interest in Bergman,
instead preferring to psychologically torment
her.  He tells her she is losing her mind, and
trains the servants to play along with his game.
Bergman becomes a virtual prisoner in her house,
isolated and frightened.  It doesn't help that
Bergman once lived in the house as a child, and
that the house was once the site of a brutal
murder.</P>
<P>The irony is that it is Boyer's character who
is mentally disturbed.  His performance is
sometimes sinister, sometimes impassioned, and
he was deserving of his Best Actor Oscar nomination.
Bergman won Best Actress, although her character
is much simpler and easier to play.  The film was
also nominated for Best Picture, Best Screenplay
(John L. Balderston, Walter Reisch, and John Van
Druten) and Best Black & White Cinematography
(Joseph Ruttenberg).</P>
<P>The audience spends most of the film puzzled.
Why is Boyer doing these terrible things to Bergman?
Also confused is detective Joseph Cotten, who
suspects Boyer in the long-ago unsolved murder.</P>
<P>Angela Lansbury makes her film debut in "Gaslight".
Still a teenager, she plays an impertinent and
flirtatious house servant.  She received a
nomination for Best Supporting Actress.</P>
<P>Why isn't this a great movie?  Bergman and
Boyer have characters that aren't completely
credible.  Bergman puts up little resistance
to Boyer's pattern of abuse, and Boyer is a
monster.  If this film were remade today,
there would surely be physical abuse, something
too disagreeable to 1944 censors, but probably
necessary to make Boyer's character more
effective.</P>
