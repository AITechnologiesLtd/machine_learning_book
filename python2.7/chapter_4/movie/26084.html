<PRE>Bait
A film review by Max Messier
Copyright © 2000 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>The American fascination with personal surveillance and voyeurism has
reached a new and strange level.  TV shows such as Survivor, Big Brother
- and movies such as Enemy of the State and The Blair Witch Project have
raised the bar for compulsive interest in other peoples' lives.  It is
as if America has become a nation of stalkers and shut-ins locked away
behind their television and computer screens.  The new Jaime Foxx film
Bait is a prime example of how this sadistic, cultural phenomenon has
been constructed into mainstream Hollywood fodder for the masses.</P>
<P>I didn't know what to expect of Bait.  From the media blitz in the past
couple weeks, the movie looked like a weird hybrid of Blue Streak, Enemy
of the State, and Hackers without Angeline Jolie (dammit!).  The story
follows Foxx as an inept thief named Alvin Sanders who involuntarily
helps Federal agents track down an ultra-cool computer hacker -- Doug
Hutchison (that asshole guard Percy Wetmore from The Green Mile) -- who
has robbed the U.S. Gold Reserve with lackey Robert Pastorelli of 42
million dollars.</P>
<P>The lackey takes off with the gold, buries it in secret place, and ends
up being arrested on a DWI, all on the same night.  Busy guy.  The
lackey then lands in the same cell as Alvin Sanders (Foxx) who has been
arrested for stealing shrimp - I mean prawns - from a Brooklyn fish
plant.  The lackey, who has terrible heart problems, confides in Alvin
to tell his wife of a secret code of the location of the buried gold. 
The lackey dies during an interrogation by a big and mean Federal agent
played by David Morse, and both the hacker and the feds are left with no
leads… except Alvin.  The feds then secretly plant a tracking device
under Alvin's jawbone and use him for… you guessed, it... bait to lure
out the hacker.  Humorous dialogue, uncomfortable dramatic moments, and
loud car chase scenes follow.</P>
<P>Bait is reminiscent of many of its numerous contemporaries, but it is
able to maintain a sense of direction under the cool hand of director
Antoine Fuqua.  Known mainly for music videos and The Replacement
Killers, Fuqua is no Hype Williams, but he can move the camera like
Malick and capture action scenes like Peckinpah.  Foxx is always a
surprise to watch as an actor, because he can come off as a chump one
minute and a serious actor the next.  Morse is a perfect straight man to
Foxx's inane attempts to return to respectability.  But the most
interesting character is Hutchinson's hacker, who comes across as
faceless while holding a cold control over nature, like a predator
stalking his prey.</P>
<P>Bait is a solid action movie despite a weird pace to the film.  One
minute Foxx is joking around about being a player, the next minute he is
committing to his girl and a new baby boy.  The movie has been sold to
public as an "action-comedy" but in reality - the film is tinged with
dark moments of cold-blooded murder and Orwellian themes of surveillance
and control.  In other words, this ain't no Big Momma's House.</P>
