<PRE>                                FALLEN
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: There are a whole lot of pieces of
          other films in FALLEN, a sort of a police
          corruption story with supernatural overtones.
          Denzel Washington plays a sharp police detective.
          He caught a serial killer and saw him executed but
          unfortunately execution seems to be only a minor
          setback for the killer, who after death seems to be
          passing his mode of operation to other killers.  In
          spite of a few good moments, the script is only
          so-so, but the photography is very atmospheric and
          John Goodman turns a minor partner role into a real
          tour de force.  Rating: 6 (0 to 10), high +1 (-4 to
          +4)</PRE>
<P>     Things are indeed rather dangerous for police homicide detective
John Hobbes, played by Denzel Washington, who begins the film saying
"Let me tell you about the time I almost died."  Hobbes is the
detective who caught the serial killer Edgar Reese (played by Elia
Koteas).  Reese seems mightily unconcerned to be heading into the gas
chamber.  Besides merrily singing "Time Is On My Side," he wildly
shakes Washington's hand and babbles in some gibberish language.  He
may be the most cheerful soul who was ever strapped into this gas
chamber and executed.  Then in an unexplained shot we seem to see
Reese's viewpoint rise from the body and settle into a guard.  Reese's
murder spree should be over.  Unfortunately the killings stubbornly
refuse to stop complete with Reese's particular trademarks.  Hobbes and
his partner Jonesy (John Goodman) have to figure out why.  At the
murder scenes now there start appearing for Hobbes clues left in the
form of riddles.  The clues seem to point at a previous case involving
a policeman named Milano who turned murderer and eventually committed
suicide.  Hobbes wants to find out more about this case and questions
the dead officer's daughter (Embeth Davidtz) who has since become a
religious fanatic, surrounding herself with images of angels.  Hobbes
investigates the cabin that was the site of the Milano suicide and
finds the name of a demon painted on the wall.</P>
<P>     Some aspects of this film are done very nicely.  Tom Sigel's
photography creates a nice somber mood of doom and dread.  His previous
work includes THE USUAL SUSPECTS and BLOOD AND WINE.  Sigel creates a
tone to his photography effectively.  Nicholas Kazan has a good ear for
dialog which director Gregory Hoblit brings out, most noticeable as
Hobbes and Jonesy discuss the case.  But the story is really a patching
together of familiar ideas from other police thrillers and even some
science fiction films.  As is all too frequent in films, the real
killer is much to anxious to strut his stuff and reveals much too much
to the police.  Presumably the killer wants to give the police a
handicap to make the game more interesting for himself, rubbing their
noses in the fact that they cannot stop him, but it is too common a
device to advance the plot.  Also too common are "false alarm" scenes
intended to make the viewer jump.  These touches in the script are
signs of weak writing.</P>
<P>     Denzel Washington does a competent job here, but he brings nothing
to his part any other capable actor could not have.  On the positive
side, there in nothing in the script that draws attention to the fact
that the character is black.  It is simply cast with a black man; it is
not a black role.  But Washington could have done a lot more with it.
The real acting honors in this film go to John Goodman who takes the
role of partner and invests it with real personality.  Donald
Sutherland is there being officious and just slightly sinister, a role
that he can manage in his sleep.  Embeth Davidtz gives her character a
certain vulnerable courage.  Davidtz formerly played Helen Hirsch in
SCHINDLER'S LIST and has understandably not found a role of such
substance since.</P>
<P>     FALLEN is something of a hybrid film which probably falls more
into the camp of the horror film than that of the police drama, though
it rarely approaches anything really frightening.  One very nice
sequence has the killer demonstrating his abilities to Hobbes through
the use of innocent bystanders.  It is perhaps the most effective scene
of the film, giving the homicide detective and the viewer a feel for
how difficult the killer will be to catch.  Not everything in this film
works as well as it might, but FALLEN does build to a nice keep-em-
guessing finale.  I rate this film a 6 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high
+1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
