<PRE>          SHRIEK IF YOU KNOW WHAT I DID LAST FRIDAY THE 13TH
                    A film review by Larry Getlen

<P>At what point do self-awareness and flip irony double back and smack
themselves in the face?  The straight-to-cable Shriek If You Know What I
Did Last Friday the 13th (it originally aired on USA Networks) is
supposedly a parody of the teen horror genre, but considering the
self-aware mockery of Scream, this film actually attempts to parody a
parody.  That is a daunting, thankless task which would require master
parodists to pull it off.  The makers of Shriek... are not those people.</P>
<P>Shriek's plot, as it were, is a stew of those from Scream and I Know
What You Did Last Summer, centering around five students trying to avoid
The Killer, a mysterious bungler in that now omnipresent Edvard Munch
"The Scream" mask who knows embarrassing secrets about each of the
students, including the fact that one student forgot to give her
grandmother her laxative.  Ha ha!</P>
<P>One major fault of Shriek... is that it lacks a principal sympathetic
character, a la Neve Campbell in Scream or Anna Faris in Scary Movie.
The five victims-in-waiting are horror movie archetypes - slutty blond
cheerleader, nerd, slightly punkish girl, new kid, and, well, the other
guy - none of who emerges as the protagonist.  Because of this, we watch
the film drift without a storyline to follow or a character to care
about, and are therefore left to thrash hopelessly in the muck of the
infantile sex and fart jokes or gags that are just plain lazy. 
Tiffani-Amber Thiessen's news reporter works for a channel called Empty
V.  Another character passes gas near a fireplace, and blows up a
house.  The nerd's name is Boner ("that's BAH-ner, sir"). There is even
an announcement over the school intercom calling for Mike Hunt and
Heywood Jablowme to come to the principal's office.  It seemed, at
times, that the movie was just a hair away from being two hours of a man
making fart noises with his armpit.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, even the jokes not drenched in immaturity often fall
flat.  At one point, out of nowhere, the characters strut forward in
slow motion, the shot and accompanying song a rip from that now-classic
scene from Reservoir Dogs.  But here, the scene has no context, and
therefore no humor.  Jon Favreau parodied the exact same shot in
Swingers after a discussion of those types of films, and it was
hilarious.  The makers of Shriek confused funny with simply familiar,
thinking we'd laugh just because we recognize the shot.  Humor requires
context, and even the most basic sight gag needs a foundation.</P>
<P>Ultimately, part of the blame for failed parodies like Shriek... lies in
the inspiration of the Zucker Brothers, whose Airplane and Naked Gun
films were the high-water mark for sight gag parodies.  The makers of
Shriek... were obviously inspired by the Zuckers, and even allude to
Airplane and Naked Gun in a scene where one character recites the rules
of parody.</P>
<P>Shriek's creators, however, missed rule number one, a rule the Zucker
brothers mastered, which is that even a sight-gag film needs a coherent
plot and "real" (within their own universe) characters.  Airplane was,
from beginning to end, the tale of a plane doomed to crash and the pilot
conquering his demons to save it, even as Leslie Nielsen appeared
amongst a panicked flight crew reminding them never to call him
Shirley.  The true genius of that film was that even as we laughed our
asses off, we also rooted for Robert Hays to land the plane and resolve
his relationship with Julie Hagerty.  Airplane would not have been a
classic without that, and many parody filmmakers never learned that
lesson.</P>
<P>As such, Shriek... is little more than a series of non-sequiturs thrown
at the wall, hoping to make someone, anyone, laugh.</P>
<P>The movie's most telling scene comes when, after the "rules of parody"
lecture, the characters decide to watch Airplane.  It is by far the
smartest move made by any character in this movie, and exactly what you
should do, as opposed to renting Shriek, if you desire a funny,
well-made parody.</P>
