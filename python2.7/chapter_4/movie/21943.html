Cinema Uprising by Steve Evans</PRE>
<P>Being John Malkovich  Dir: Spike Jonze. Starring John Cusack, Cameron Diaz,
Catherine Keener and John Malkovich.</P>
<P>The pitch: A puppeteer reluctantly takes a job with a bizarre company on the
7 Â½ floor of a NYC office tower, where he discovers a secret door leading
into the mind of actor John Malkovich.</P>
<P>Got that? Hereâ€™s a wildly inventive, completely crazy satire of celebrity
obsession -- spiced with a quest for eternal life, adultery and betrayal,
madness and gender confusion. And, gulp, itâ€™s the funniest movie of the
year.</P>
<P>Being John Malkovich almost defies description. First-time screenwriter
Charlie Kaufmanâ€™s delightfully demented tale unfolds like a hallucination
that could have been penned by Lewis Carroll under heavy medication. We
guarantee the gentle readers of Cinema Uprising have never seen anything
like this. They probably never will again.</P>
<P>Cusack is a sensitive puppeteer whose skills just arenâ€™t in high demand,
although he blames his lagging career on â€œthis wintry job climate.â€? His
loopy wife (Diaz), is devoted to a menagerie of house pets - a dog, assorted
cats, a neurotic chimpanzee (the monkeyâ€™s problem stems from a childhood
â€œincident,â€? we are told), an iguana, an aquarium of tropical fish and an
obnoxious cockatoo. The noise in their one-bedroom apartment could push
anyone over the edge.</P>
<P>Diaz tells her brooding husband that he needs to find a real job. Responding
to a cryptic classified ad, he takes the elevator of an office building to
the 7 Â½ floor - yes, the elevator stops between the 7th and 8th levels.
Scrambling into the hallway, he discovers that the ceilings are only five
feet tall. Everyone walks hunched over, turning their heads sideways to
talk, like Quasimodo in the Hunchback of Notre Dame. The explanation behind
the construction of this floor is just as preposterous and equally funny.
Cusack ambles down the hall, puzzled, looking as though heâ€™s just popped
down a rabbit hole. The receptionist talks in gibberish and confuses his
legitimate questions with sexual harassment. Flummoxed, heâ€™s ushered in to
meet the boss, a mysterious doctor who doesnâ€™t explain the companyâ€™s
business, but offers his new employee a position in the filing department.</P>
<P>The jobâ€™s a snore, but Cusack takes an immediate liking to co-worker Maxine
(Keener), a shark in a womanâ€™s business suit. She doesnâ€™t think much of the
scruffy puppeteer, but gets the hots for his wife. Diaz is equally smitten
with Maxine.</P>
<P>As if that wasnâ€™t enough trouble, Cusack discovers a tiny door behind a
filing cabinet at work. The portal opens to a narrow corridor, dripping with
mud and effluvia. He crawls inside and is propelled, as though riding a
water slide, through some sort of metaphysical corridor that deposits him
into the mind of Oscarïƒ'-nominated actor John Malkovich. Cusack sees the
world through the eyes of Malkovich for precisely 15 minutes before he is
ejected, falling from the sky by the side of the New Jersey Turnpike. Itâ€™s
an inspired bit of lunacy.</P>
<P>The time limit inside the actorâ€™s mind is no doubt a reference to Andy
Warholâ€™s comment that in the future everyone will be famous for 15 minutes.</P>
<P>Exhilarated, Cusack tells Maxine of his trip inside Malkovich. She smells a
business opportunity. Who wouldnâ€™t pay to be someone else - anybody else -
for 15 minutes? The fact that itâ€™s a celebrity only sweetens the deal.</P>
<P>Soon customers are queued up along the office hallway, waiting to pay $200
each for a ride inside the famous actor. Cusack persuades his wife to give
it a try. Diaz slips inside the portal, but only after Maxine arranges a
date with Malkovich. That way, while sheâ€™s inside the actorâ€™s mind, Diaz is
able to indulge her fantasies with Maxine. She can be a man seducing a
woman. The new perspective is intoxicating. After Cusack picks her up by the
turnpike, Diaz declares that she either wants a sex-change or to be a
lesbian. Doesnâ€™t matter which. Itâ€™s hard to convey the hilarity of this
scene, which is best experienced first-hand, as a small comic miracle that
keeps building as Cusack does a slow burn.</P>
<P>Malkovich is superb playing not so much himself, but perhaps the public
perception of who he is - a quiet man given to contemplation and understated
elegance. The supporting players are likewise marvelous, especially Diaz,
who seems to take delight in hiding her beauty behind a challenging role.
Cusack is always fun to watch, although this may be his best role since
Grosse Pointe Blank (1997). He fully realizes the controlling nature of his
character â€` after all, for a guy who loves to pull the strings of
marionettes, what could be more satisfying than crawling inside another
personâ€™s brain and making him do tricks?</P>
<P>First-time feature director Jonze, who is best known for shooting music
videos, has a fractured way of looking at the world. Itâ€™s as though he was
peering at his characters through a prism of broken glass -- the different
facets of their personalities never throw the same reflection twice. Theyâ€™re
unpredictable. As such, we feel off-balance in an amusing way, like
exploring a funhouse with warped mirrors and tilted floors.</P>
<P>Being John Malkovich belongs on any top 10 list for 1999. For all its
lunacy, this unique picture merits serious Academy Award consideration. It
is audacious, anarchic and outrageously funny filmmaking. Catch it quick. We
will not see its kind again.</P>
<P>Rated R for language, sexual situations.</P>
