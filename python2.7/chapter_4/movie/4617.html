<P>     Given the poor state of science fiction films over the past few 
years, it's understandable that I approached SCREAMERS with low 
expectations.  After enduring a steady diet of mediocre-to-bad movies 
like STARGATE, PUPPET MASTERS, TIMECOP, STAR TREK: GENERATIONS, SPECIES, 
and others, relief came several weeks ago in the form of Terry Gilliam's 
wonderfully offbeat TWELVE MONKEYS.  Happily, SCREAMERS makes it two 
science fiction successes in a row.  Despite a title that sounds like it 
belongs to a horror picture, this movie is closer to ALIENS than to a 
bloodbath.</P>
<P>     SCREAMERS oozes atmosphere.  It's a dark film that borrows heavily 
from the likes of the ALIEN films, DUNE, BLADE RUNNER, and John 
Carpenter's updated THE THING.  From start to finish, SCREAMERS is shot 
in a manner intended to convey paranoia and claustrophobia.  Set design 
is always impressive, if bleak, and consists primarily of ruined 
buildings and underground bunkers.  Matte paintings of wrecked bridges 
and smashed cities form an ominous backdrop to much of the movie's 
action.</P>
<P>     The film opens with several paragraphs of background text.  The 
year is 2078 and the place is Sirius 6B.  Once a paradise, it has been 
reduced to a radioactive wasteland as the result of mining toxic 
Berynium (the "solution" to Earth's energy crisis) and a war that has 
lasted more than a decade.  Peace may be close at hand, however, and 
it's up to Commander Hendricksson (Robocop himself, Peter Weller) to 
decide the legitimacy of his enemies' appeal for an armistice. </P>
<P>     Along with fresh-out-of-training rookie Ace (Andy Lauer), 
Hendricksson heads into the wasteland, traveling to the opposition's 
control bunker.  Along the way, he meets several other Sirius 6B 
survivors, all eking out a nomadic existence:  bootlegger Jessica 
(Jennifer Rubin), a woman who wants nothing more than to go to Earth; 
Ross (Charles Powell), the sole survivor of a massacre; and Becker (Roy 
Dupuis), a hardened cynic who prefers killing to asking questions.  </P>
<P>     As these five trek across the surface of Sirius 6B, they encounter 
a new, deadly adversary:  the screamers (so nicknamed because of the 
squeal they make when attacking).  Originally created as "autonomous 
mobile swords" by Hendricksson's side, the electronic, buzz-saw-like 
creatures have evolved, shaking off the yoke of slavery.  With the 
ability to form a human shape and mimic human behavior, little appears 
beyond their capabilities, including infiltrating Hendricksson's small 
group.</P>
<P>     SCREAMERS' story, like its look, owes much to other films.  As in 
ALIEN and ALIENS, there's a lot of hunting through dimly-lit, oppressive 
tunnels and passageways.  One type of screamer bears a resemblance to a 
cross between an H.R. Giger creation and a cybermat from DR. WHO.  Human 
identity, one of the central themes of THE THING, plays a key role in 
SCREAMERS as well.  Since the screamers can replicate human beings, 
there's no telling who can be trusted.  </P>
<P>     The film isn't without flaws. SCREAMERS is so excessively concerned 
with tone and atmosphere that it sometimes forgets about character 
development.  The movie is half over before we start to care about 
anyone, including Weller's Hendricksson.  Also, the philosophical issues 
inherent in the evolution of a new lifeform are entirely ignored in 
favor of action and adventure.  Despite this, the pace is still uneven, 
with slow stretches of wandering across snowscapes and through tunnels 
interspersed with tense battle sequences.  </P>
<P>     SCREAMERS, like TWELVE MONKEYS and THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, 
emphasizes that science fiction doesn't have to be upbeat to succeed.  
This "sci-fi noir" style has led to a crop of films that hopefully 
heralds a new trend in the industry. If nothing else, SCREAMERS 
underlines an important truth:  you don't need a big budget or big-name 
stars to make this sort of motion picture succeed.  </P>
