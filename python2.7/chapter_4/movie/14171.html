<PRE>Local Hero (1983)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 68</PRE>
<P>"Local Hero" is a gentle comedy from Scotland.
There's little action or plot, but the script,
characters and direction all have a quirky
irreverence that is charming if not fully
convincing.</P>
<P>Peter Riegert is a young executive sent to
Scotland to buy a small coastal town for its
oil rights.  Burt Lancaster is his boss, but
he is more interested in astronomy than business.
Riegert soon has a goony-eyed sidekick in
Peter Capaldi, who is in love with aptly named
Marina (Jennifer Black).  Riegert finds that
the townsfolk, particularly proprietor Dennis
Lawson, are greedily willing to sell out.</P>
<P>The cinematography of the seashore and ocean is
attractive, and the little Scottish village is
quaint.  The charm of the quiet village life is
contrasted with the frantic corporate lifestyle
of Houston, Texas.  At film's end, Riegert is
obligated to return to Texas, and it clear
that he does not want to go.</P>
<P>"Local Hero" has more than its share of humorous
moments, which unfortunately can't be revealed
without spoiling them.  Other scenes don't come
off as well, especially those involving Lancaster's
abusive shrink (Norman Chancer).  We are to believe
that young and indolent Capaldi knows a dozen
different languages. The whimsy of the script and
eccentricities of the supporting characters can't
fully hide the simplicity of the plot, which
takes us nowhere slowly.</P>
