<P>Expectations are an odd thing. (Here comes the segue…wait for it). Last week 
I went to see NURSE BETTY with high apple pie in the sky hopes, for you see 
the picture had not only garnered a screenplay award at the prestigious 
CANNES FILM FESTIVAL, but an A grade from the mostly trustworthy folk at 
ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY, among a veritable avalanche of positive reviews. And I 
have no clue what any of them were talking about. The movie was a hodgepodge 
of indie irritations (I've taken to calling them "indieisms", an example of 
which could be those ever so common hip, articulate philosophy minded hit 
men) filtered through a mainstream feel-good sensibility; it's one of the few 
films aimed at both the audiences for schmaltzy STEPMOM-like hokum and 
cynical, ironical PULP FICTION-like grit. A week later I trudge into DUETS, 
my hopes dulled to nada just from glancing at its highly negative notices, 
plus rumors of Disney's uncertainty with the film, and some last minute 
re-shoots. Naturally I was expecting a train wreck. Instead I got a minor 
fender bender. A bicycle pile-up really. And I groaned and rolled my eyes a 
whole lot less than I did through BETTY. But oh yes, I did groan and roll my 
eyes. Though because of what I stated above in my oh so perceptive opening 
sentence, I can't really be mad at this flick; compared to what I thought I 
was in store for, DUETS was very nearly a blessing.</P>
<P>It's a strange film in that it has moments of greatness, coupled with clichés 
that should have been retired way before we entered the 90's. We get yet 
another pairing of a black guy and white guy who initially don't quite know 
what to make of the other, then eventually falling in love (…but not in a 
homosexual way), the estranged father and daughter (the father is a deadbeat 
type who wants nothing to do with his daughter, and frankly I'd feel the same 
way if she were played by Gwenyth Paltrow in blonde airhead mode), and the 
kind hooker who falls for the straight laced guy (nuff' said there). DUETS 
even includes a more recent motif; the family man who goes berserk like Kevin 
Spacey in AMERICAN BEAUTY, only instead of black mailing his boss and lusting 
after his daughter's teenage friends, he pierces his ears and paints his toe 
nails cherry red. Despite all that, I still found much to like amid this 
particular mess; it's sometimes clever, occasionally poignant, but just when 
you think you're watching a quality picture it slaps you in the face with an 
utterly dopey Nora Ephron moment (this occurs in nearly every scene with 
Paltrow).</P>
<P>The flick veers off into three separate stories, with only one worth paying 
attention to, not because it's so well done, rather because its performers 
manage to transcend all the lameness. We begin with Huey Lewis as a karaoke 
hustler (yep, that's when the first eye roll occurred), who stumbles into a 
bar looking like he doesn't know his right from left, trounces up to a 
bragging karaoke champ and mumbles "what the hell is this, karate-oke?" This 
leads to some spectacular singing by Lewis, which by the way is the one thing 
this film gets right every time. DUETS is like a modern musical, here, the 
actors have a reason to belt out tunes; they're performing. And even if the 
actors (all of whom do their own voice work with the exception of Braugher 
who was dubbed) don't hit all the right notes, they give confident and wildly 
energetic turns-- I practically had to hold myself in that sticky multiplex 
seat to keep from leaping in front of the screen and dancing like a fool. 
Even the weasel-voiced Gimatti does a fine job (after a purposely shaky 
start) with his rendition of HELLO IT'S ME by Todd Rundgren.</P>
<P>Huey Lewis doesn't give a great acting performance but I forgive him, 
considering that he has one the most interesting faces I've seen on the 
silver screen in a while. Time worn and handsome, his features are like a 
well-tread road map propped up by his inquisitive eyebrows. He looks like the 
beaten man he's playing. We find that he has an estranged daughter, Liv 
(Gwyneth Paltrow) who wants to get to know him, though he resists. Once this 
business starts, every scene between them becomes clichesville, with Paltrow 
pouting and scrunching her face up as if she were trying to capture the 
nuances of a Jennifer Love Hewitt performance. It's her most annoying work 
yet, though she kinda makes up for it when she gets to sing, which she does 
with sensuous aplomb. Nonetheless, their happy ending is a bit sudden and 
anti-climactic (nothing the characters do suggest the sudden change that 
occurs) though it too leads to some good stuff, notably a duet between 
Paltrow and Lewis to Smokey Robinson's CRUISIN' that had me smiling despite 
the falseness of its build-up. Like everyone in the film, the pair is on its 
way to Omaha for a karaoke showdown and, hopefully, some prize money.</P>
<P>Less annoying but still pretty bad, is the mini-story about the sweet-hearted 
hooker who meets a wannabe priest, now underachieving cab driver played by TV 
hunk Scott Speedman. I'm not familiar with Speedman and he's easily the worst 
link here with his dull line readings and utter inexpressivness; still, I'm 
convinced that once he masters a second facial expression they'll be no 
stopping him. This is one of those performances where the actor relies on his 
good-natured smile far too much, and it is indeed one of those sparkling 
"look at me!" Tom Cruise smiles. This smirk factory generates no chemistry 
with his female co-star, Maria Bello, who's so good she actually had me sorta 
enjoying the umpteenth variation on the ol' hooker with a heart of gold (see, 
she's different cause she sings too).</P>
<P>The third thread works out best, which is something, considering it has the 
most to negotiate. This is the one with Paul Giamatti as a sad sack 
businessman going certifiable, ditching his job and heading out on the road 
in search of freedom and, apparently, cigarettes. He impulsively picks up a 
hitchhiker played by the great Andre Braugher of the great (and no 
longer…R.I.P.) HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREET. They have some terrific scenes 
together, particularly a thrilling bit where Giamatti teaches Braugher to 
drive, and does so very badly. The problem here is that they go from being a 
fairly genial couple (with vaguely haunted undertones) to a grim pairing 
after some completely out of place violence. This was the problem Disney had 
with the film, and they made the director, Bruce Paltrow (Gwyneth's father, 
again, nuff said), trim much of the objectionable material. So we don't 
really see anything, but the act is still there casting a pall over a film 
that spent most of its time working for a fairly light hearted tone.</P>
<P>The basic theme DUETS presents isn't a bad one; it being that the patrons who 
fill out karaoke bars ("it's a rush like you wouldn't believe," one character 
enthuses) are lonely and looking for some kind, any kind, of connection. 
Fine, but then don't make these characters so damn common, and don't put them 
through paces we've seen over and over (that was my personal aside to the 
film makers). The un-negotiable problem of the film lies in its screenplay; 
it's as if the writer, John Byrum, was too scared to tell a story too 
different, so he wound up filling his film with recognizable character types. 
And who's that gonna please?</P>
