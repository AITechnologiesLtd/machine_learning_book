<P>rated G
Walt Disney Pictures
88 minutes
starring the voices of Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver, Glenn Close, Nigel
Hawthorne, Alex D. Linz, Rosie O'Donnell, Wayne Knight
based on the story "Tarzan Of The Apes" by Edgar Rice Burroughs
written by Tab Murphy, Bob Tzudiker and Noni White
directed by Chris Buck and Kevin Lima</P>
<P>Although many movie studios have taken the animation genre to
unexpected heights in the past five years, the films carrying the
Disney logo are still the most memorable.  "Tarzan", Disney's latest,
is no exception. Using the original story by Edgar Rice Burroughs,
"Tarzan" breaks little new ground, but it is still an entertaining
treat. "Tarzan" features Tony Goldwyn(director of "A Walk On The
Moon") as the title character, and Minnie Driver as Jane, his love
interest. The story is the oft-told one about the boy who is raised as
a gorilla and uses his animal instincts to woo a woman who is studying
the gorillas. At times, "Tarzan" is very derivative of "The Lion
King", and the characters aren't nearly as well developed as those in
that film. But "Tarzan" is an animated film that people of all ages
should enjoy.</P>
