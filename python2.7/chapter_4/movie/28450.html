<P>   Girls are made of sugar and spice and everything nice.  Yeah,
right.  Anyone who still believes that should see "Baise-moi," a
hard-hitting, hard-core porn movie that was banned in France
and presumably did not make it to the Toronto Film Festival
because the appropriate Ontario board proscribed the pic there
as well.  "Baise-moi" cannot be called dull, no way, but like some
similar fare that can be called exciting to watch, it is pointless. 
The directors, Virginie Despentes (on whose novel the movie is
based) and Coralie Trinh Thi seem to want the audience to view
this as not simply shocking and disturbing or even as
empowering (to employ the much-abused hip terminology) but as
a dark parody of similar works such as (presumably) "Natural
Born Killers" and Catherine Breillat's recent French porn entry,
"Romance."  But satire has to stand on its own as a literate, witty
endeavor.  "Baise-moi" lacks clever repartee, rather
accommodating dialogue that comes across as improvised as
the entire picture is unstructured.</P>
<P>   "Baise-moi" translates officially as "Rape Me" but I'm sure
something is lost in translation unless Ms. Despentes and Ms.
Trinh Thi are pushing irony further than that envelope has been
pushed before.  The plot, really a series of random, loosely-
formed incidents of loveless sex and casual violence, centers on
two females, Manu (Raffaela Anderson) and Nadine (Karen
Bach)--France's answer to Thelma and Louise.  As both
performers are involved in the porn industry, they have no
problem, well, performing--nor do their well-endowed, seemingly
priapic male partners.  When Nadine, a street-wise prostitute who
is regularly pushed around by her clients and roommate, teams
up with Manu--who as a victim in a graphic rape scene which the
directors have refused to edit to please censors--team up, they
begin taking out their anger toward men while thinking nothing of
offing women who might supply them with money.  They shoot a
woman at an ATM after having wasted Nadine's roommate and
Manu's brother and, sexually excited rather than disgusted by
their acts, they take off on a spree of sex and murder. 
Sometimes they kill their male partners, sometimes not--it all
depends on how well the men do at satisfying them.  In the most
turbulent spectacle, they enter the Libertine (free sex) club, bash
a man's head a few times on the bar, and proceed to shoot all
the patrons, both men and women.  But the display that outdoes
all the others occurs when the last person alive in the club is
made to oink like a pig only to have a gun placed deep into his
butt before the trigger is pulled.</P>
<P>   I suppose you could justify the movie as a take-off on both pro-
feminist films and the whole genre of exploitation flicks such as
Russ Meye'rs "Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!," but the cheap digital
video photography, the lack of wit, the presentation of people
about whom no one can really care (although Ms. Anderson is
kind of cute) make "Baise-moi" a curiosity worth seeing simply for
its daring but not at all for its resonance, humor, repartee, or
darkly satiric value.  One can imagine that given the rise of
female directors, we will get to see folks like Thelma and Louise,
Manu and Nadine, as proof that women can be as angry as men-
-that the concept of women as gentle, supportive, and anything
but macho is simply a fantasy of the males who have so far
dominated the fields of literature and film.  Let's hope that this
anger--which certainly deserves to emerge in the various art
forms--will be presented by others in a manner that in some way
can be called art.</P>
