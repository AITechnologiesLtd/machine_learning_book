<PRE>Review: Fight Club
Starring: Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter
Directed by David Fincher</PRE>
<P>As any reasonable human being would, I must admit that occasionally I am
befuddled by certain things. I am befuddled by Fight Club. Now sometimes our
favorite films are panned by critics and do not achieve critical success
until much later, sometimes as much as ten or twenty years later.  Perhaps
it is because these films are way ahead of their time. Perhaps it is because
they are so new and complex that only after years of allowing them to sink
in do we truly appreciate and understand them. Fight Club is either garbage
or brilliant, but, at least right now, I must lean toward the former.</P>
<P>Maybe I am subconsciously affected by word of mouth that has been slowly
leaking throughout the media for weeks that this film is pure gold. But if
it is, I sure don¹t see it.</P>
<P>Edward Norton plays Jack, a field examiner for a major automobile
manufacturer. His insomnia, coupled with his compulsive desires to fill his
world with IKEA furniture to ³complete² himself, make him a loser at the
game of life. But when all of his worldly possessions are blown out his 15th
story window, he seeks comfort in a stranger, Tyler (Pitt) whom he met on a
flight home. Once Jack is sucked into Tyler¹s world, he can¹t get out,
literally. They begin Fight Club, an organization based on brutal and bloody
fistfights that signify nothing other than to provide those that join a
sense of belonging. As the Fight Club grows, things get out of control and
take on cult status, beginning with one future soldier who proves his worth
by standing still outside Tyler¹s house for three days. I dare not even
begin to bring up the last quarter of the film, since that contains the
twist that ³explains² the pointless journey.</P>
<P>Suffice it to say I was truly disappointed in Fincher, who¹s previous two
films, Se7en and The Game put him in a very slim category of truly brilliant
young filmmakers of the next generation. This is not to imply by any means
that he is no longer a genius or capable of bringing more masterpieces to
the table. But with Fight Club, he has allowed his unique talent for
extraordinary vision to be distorted by silly digital experiments and
self-referencing film elements, such as talking to the audience about what
they are seeing, telling them that the little blips in the right hand corner
are signifiers that the projectionist is changing reels and that a slightly
altered recurring line is good ³flashback humor².</P>
<P>Now, throughout the film¹s coarsely woven texture and over-extended plot
lines, Fight Club is obviously trying to make various social comments about
the state of the world today. Advertisements, inter-office politics,
corporations, you name it, it¹s addressed. (Though the media are
suspiciously absent from the institutions that are referenced.) All of them
play an important role. How so? Well, I can kinda just tell. I can¹t really
put my finger on it. To say that Starbucks and Barnes & Noble are taking
over their respective markets and kicking out the small business owner is no
big news. Is that bad for the world? Probably. Not much room for social
commentary there. We all know that inter-office politics are just
that...politics. So what was the point of all this? The film seems desperate
to make a point, or a number of points, but I couldn¹t figure out what they
were.</P>
<P>All I saw was a very bizarre social satire that was woven with strange film
techniques, a bleak visual design and some fine acting. (Pitt, Carter,
Norton...all of them are good. Even Meatloaf is good.) When you get to the
end, you will most likely be filled with questions, many of which the
filmmakers wanted you to ask of yourself. Not them, because each of them
would likely give you a different answer. Fight Club means what you want it
to mean, I think Fincher just gives you the stuff to think about. But it
couldn¹t be more bizarre and unappealing. Sure, it had shock value, but so
did Se7en and The Game, and they were significantly stronger films.</P>
