<PRE>Bowfinger (PG-13) *** 1/2
Starring Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy
Directed by Frank Oz
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Bowfinger can only be compared (since I do love comparing two films with some
of the same plot sequences) with the recent The Muse, which also took a fun
look at the thing that we call Hollywood. But this comedy seems a little duller
than The Muse was, it's more of a spoof on all of those B-movies you see in
that dusty corner of the neighborhood video store.</P>
<P>Bobby Bowfinger (Martin) is a movie producer, he works out of a dump that he
calls Bowfinger International Pictures in the cheap section of Hollywood. When
a member of his troupe of actors comes up with a wonderful action script, (it's
called Chubby Rain, and it's about aliens that come down to Earth to fry us all
to a crisp in the rain, thus making it chubby) but no movie executive will
produce it unless big time action star Kit Ramsey (Murphy) is attached.</P>
<P>So the entire crew just goes up to Kit and says their lines about aliens and
such. This works out perfectly because Kit is paranoid that aliens are coming
to take over the Earth, when they finally drive him over the edge (and into a
mental hospital) they must find someone that looks like him to play the part of
Kit.</P>
<P>Finally, a summer comedy has something that all of the other ones lacked, a
good script. Martin has come up with some of the funniest plot sequences and
one-liners that I've seen in a long time. Topping it off is Heather Graham, she
knows exactly how to get around in Hollywood, and her character makes a
surprise twist in the end. Performances are all great, especially Murphy, Kit
Ramsey talks a mile a minute (much in the same way of Chris Tucker) and it's
really fun to watch what he does with the role. Also making a wonderful turn in
Christine Baranski as a theater veteran that thinks she's a top notch actress.
So if you want to laugh, go see Bowfinger, which gets *** 1/2 stars.</P>
<P>The Young-Uns: The film contains some language and passionate make out scenes.
Good Age 12 & Up</P>
