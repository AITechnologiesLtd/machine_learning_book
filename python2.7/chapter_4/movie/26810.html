<PRE>To Hell and Back
Little Nicky</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony </PRE>
<P>Be prepared to spend the first twenty minutes in humor hell, where 
several big name actors flop over gags that can't beat a rubber chicken 
on the funnymeter. Wait, I take that back, a ghoul with breasts on his 
head is pretty funny. </P>
<P>Adam is the daft third son of the current reigning devil. The older two 
sons missing a chance at dad's throne decide to escape on up to Earth, 
freezing the fiery gates to hell and leaving pops to decompose appendage 
by appendage for a full week. Adam is the only one who can save dad. He 
must bop on down to Earth, capture his brothers in a whiskey flask and 
bring them both back to Hell before the seventh day. </P>
<P>The film takes a break from being horrible once Adam gets "down to 
Earth." Here the film is still not good, but lovable despite - and the 
hearty-laugh to wincing-groan ratio improves as well. Several very funny 
bits coaxed audible chuckles from this narrow-eyed crowd. Managing to 
avoid a slip back into the horrible, "Little Nicky" never breaks into 
the excellent, or even the very good. </P>
<P>Sort of a "Dogma" lite (way lite), "Nicky" still may capture the amore 
of a certain party animal crowd just after they've mauled a refer-laced 
cake seeking only to satiate their craving for the less than silly. 
Perhaps it'll even become the next "Rocky Horror" - who knows? </P>
