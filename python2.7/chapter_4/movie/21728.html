<PRE>THE LEGEND OF 1900
A film Review by Athan Bezaitis
Copyright Athan Bezaitis 1999</PRE>
<P>Director Giuseppe Tornatore has a knack for weaving a magical story.
CINEMA PARADISO firmly established him as a tour de force filmmaker with
its Academy Award successes in 1988.  His latest feature, THE LEGEND OF
1900, is another intriguing tale, which blends a compelling fictional
character with an exhilarating epoch of American history.</P>
<P>THE LEGEND OF 1900 is the story of a boy's journey to manhood, never
having stepped foot on dry land.  Abandoned on an ocean liner and named
for the year in which he was born, 1900 (Tim Roth- HOODLUM, RESERVOIR
DOGS) grows up within the confines of the trans-Atlantic steamer
Virginia.  His prodigious talent for piano is discovered at a young age
and 1900 spends his days entertaining passengers from all over the world
one boatload after another.  As he gets older his reputation
proliferates to the point that 1900 would be a rich man if he were ever
willing to part with his life aboard the ship.   However, despite
prodding from his friend Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince- DR. DOLITTLE, THE END
OF VIOLENCE) and others, he is content to remain a fixture at sea.
What will come of 1900 as the war approaches and the waves of immigrants
recede?  Will he move on, or stay forever in the confines of his ship?</P>
<P>The best part of the film is its incredible score.  Composed by Ennio
Morricone (THE UNTOUCHABLES, BULWORTH), the music is a wonderful blend
of jazz and ragtime that captures the sounds and feel of 1900's
mysterious talents.  Roth's jagged facial features are perfect because
we get a lot of close-ups of him at the piano in deep thought sweating
or crying.   Roth effectively captures the complexities 1900's strange
satisfaction with his unique interpretation of the world as a sea
dweller.</P>
<P> Also worthy of note are costume designer Maurizio Millenotti and
Director of Photography Lajos Koltai.  The look and feel of the film
takes fashion from the height of the roaring twenties and combines it
with a soft blend of lighting and tone, which stylishly establishes the
film's somber mood.</P>
<P>Despite the plot's intrigue, some of the elements of 1900's life that
the film left untouched take away from its effectiveness.   The plot
needed more insight into 1900's character and less time on drawn out
musical sequences with elaborate pan shots.  Two hours left me with
several unanswered questions: Why do we only get a glimpse at his human
frailties towards the opposite sex?  And how does he develop the strong
British accent when a foul-mouthed and rugged ship worker raised him for
eight years?  The film could have complete with more insight into its
characters.</P>
<P>While LEGEND OF 1900 is far from perfect, it is extremely entertaining
and worth seeing, if just for the duel of pianists between Jelly Roll
Morton (Clarence Williams III- THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER), the supposed
`inventor of jazz,' and 1900.  The three round duel sizzles between the
two incredibly talented musicians and is a lot more decisive than a
Lewis-Holyfield bout.</P>
<PRE>3.5 stars</PRE>
