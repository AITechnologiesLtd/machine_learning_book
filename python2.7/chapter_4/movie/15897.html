<PRE>                             A SIMPLE PLAN
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Three working-class men find a plane
          wreck with four million dollars and start making
          plans for how to keep money for themselves.  But
          the bounty is too great for three men to split
          amicably.  Sam Raimi makes a film in the style of
          the Coen Brothers with a lot of locality atmosphere
          and understanding of his characters.  Rating: 7 (0
          to 10), +2 (-4 to +4)
          New York Critics: 20 positive, 1 negative, 4 mixed</PRE>
<P>     Sam Raimi grew up a close friend of the Coen Brothers.  All three
want into filmmaking.  The Coen Brothers specialized in crime films.
Raimi, focusing on a younger audience, made a variety of films, but he
was best known for his horror film trilogy, the EVIL DEAD films.  Now
Sam Raimi is moving into Coen brothers territory with a serious and
dark crime thriller set somewhere in the frozen North Central states in
the cold of winter.  The plot is a familiar one.  Three people have
come into a lot of money they must keep secret.  But three is a big
crowd when it comes to four and a half million dollars.  The setting is
like FARGO, and the basic situation is like THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA
MADRE.  The plotting is like a serious version of the too-recent VERY
BAD THINGS, but serious makes all the difference.</P>
<P>     Scott B. Smith wrote the screenplay based on his own novel.  The
opening image of the film is a fox making a quick raid on a hen house,
snatching what it can get and running with it.  While that really is
the event that sets the plot in motion, the "grab what you can and run"
scene also sets the tone for what is to come.  In A SIMPLE PLAN Hank
(played by Bill Paxton) works in the feed and grain, but hopes his
college education will bring him something better for his wife Sarah
(Bridget Fonda) and the daughter he will have in a few days.  Sarah has
learned to accept Jacob, Hank's grungy brother (Billy Bob Thornton),
but not Jacob's redneck friend Lou (Brent Bisscoe).  Jacob and Lou
similarly are a bit contemptuous of Lou's comparatively manicured
existence.  Ordinarily these tensions would never be spoken, but events
are about to stress all the relationships.</P>
<P>     One frosty winter day Hank, Jacob, and Lou come upon a plane
crashed in the woods.  On board they find a dead pilot and a satchel
with 44,000 one hundred-dollar bills.  If all three people can
cooperate perfectly it should be no problem hanging onto the money.
Right?  But of course the presence of the money will test each of the
men's relationships with the others and Hank's relationship with Sarah.
Sarah, Jacob, and Lou each has a different idea of what to do with the
money and they do not all mesh.  Hank wants to wait until things die
down and then leave town.  Jacob sees the money as his opportunity to
buy back his father's farm and make it work again.  Lou is in unhealthy
debt and wants to pay off some loans and live high.  Hank will discover
entirely different people inside the skins of the people closest to
him.  And one of them is himself. As Sarah observes to Hank late in the
film, "Nobody would ever believe that you would be capable of doing
what you've done."  The plot is composed like a chain with each event
leading to the next and all lead to chaos.</P>
<P>     As in FARGO, the icy setting becomes a character in the film
itself.  These are people who are worn down from just fighting the
climate.  It casts a pall over the entire film.  Raimi accentuates the
gray of the weather by filming with muted, depressing colors.  A SIMPLE
PLAN is a compelling ride through an alien moral landscape.  While much
of the chaos that is the plot is predictable, some of the places the
plot takes us are quite unexpected.  I rate it 7 on the 0 to 10 scale
and a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
