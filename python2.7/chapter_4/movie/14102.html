Review:                Wrongfully Accused</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:        Leslie Nielson, Richard Crenna, Kelly Le Brock,
                Sandra Bernhard, Michael York, Melinda McGraw</PRE>
<P>Written, Produced and Directed by Pat Proft</P>
<PRE>Review by:        Joy Wyse</PRE>
<P>Thinking about this movie brings to mind the phrase "Jack of All Trades,
Master of None".  They have tried to make a movie that will appeal to
everyone and ends up appealing to no one, except maybe a few 13-14 year
olds who go to a lot of movies.  The majority of the script depends on
satirizing other films.  If you haven't seen them, you probably won't
catch the jokes.  Obviously, there's The Fugitive, but there's also
Titanic, Braveheart, Mission Impossible, and many, many others.  Trying to
figure out which movie is being portrayed is most of the fun.  And, it is
fun to study the wonderful props that are used.</P>
<P>Too much sexual innuendo prevents this from being a children's film,
although some of it is subtle enough to go right over their heads.  There
is a scene, for example, when Lauren Goodhue [LeBrock] "prepares" a cigar
by licking it, and Ryan Harrison [Nielsen] causes the drawer to open. </P>
<P>It's too childish to appeal to many adults, because many of the jokes are
aimed at those viewers who are just discovering puberty.  Sadly, some of
the funniest bits are missed by many.  They are in the closing credits. 
They list everyone including: party guest out of focus [Ingrid
Henningsen], fainting pedestrian [Barbaree Earl Nielsen], and Wanted
poster boy [Jason Payn].  They list winning lottery numbers.  Credit is
given to: Director's favorite lunch on a cold, rainy day_.grilled cheese
sandwich and tomato soup.</P>
<P>There is a credit for Interns We allegedly all had sex with_.list upon
request.  I liked "Best Boy on Batteries: Mike Sweeney" and Groped: Patty
Sachs.  Then, they proceed to list "Today's Menu", complete with prices. 
They also include   "no one cares about the following people" and names
twenty.  They include things that were stolen, and people in the crew who
smuggled Cuban Cigars out of Canada.  The way closing credits go on and on
these days, it's difficult to figure out which are the jokes.  At one
point it's stated "This movie costs less than Michael Jordan makes in a
year".  It shows!</P>
<PRE>I give it a kind C-.  I'd watch it again if I had nothing else to do and
it was on free TV.</PRE>
<PRE>SEE YOU AT THE MOVIES!</PRE>
