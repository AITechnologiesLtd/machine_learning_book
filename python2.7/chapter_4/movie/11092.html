<PRE>A Film Review by Brian Takeshita</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  ** out of ****</PRE>
<P>Barry Levinson's SPHERE is the latest in a long line of films based on
a novel by Michael Crichton.  In this one, Dustin Hoffman plays Norman
Goodman, a psychologist who deals with survivors of airplane crashes,
and that's what he thinks he's supposed to be doing when he is taken
via helicopter to a small fleet of research vessels off the coast of
Guam.  Upon arrival on one of the ships, however, he learns that
several of his professional acquaintances are also present, and that
their mission is not to deal with a plane crash, but rather with an
alien spacecraft resting on the bottom of the ocean.</P>
<P>During the Bush administration, Goodman wrote a standard operating
procedure for alien contact, specifying the small team of experts who
should be present.  They include a scientist named Beth Halperin
(Sharon Stone), an astrophysicist named Ted Fielding (Liev Schreiber),
and a mathematician named Harry Adams (Samuel L. Jackson), who come
under the supervision of Harold Barnes (Peter Coyote), who works for
an ultra-secret government agency.  The team descends a thousand feet
to the ocean floor, where they are housed in an underwater habitat
built by the Navy, located close to the spacecraft.  Upon entering the
spacecraft, they find a liquid-lustrous golden sphere which reflects
everything in the room except them, indicating that the curious object
possibly chooses what it reflects.  Is the sphere sentient?  Their
question is answered when it makes contact with them through the
computer terminals of their underwater habitat.  Soon, however,
disasters involving attacking jellyfish, flooding, fire, and a giant
squid seem to appear at the whimsy of the strange alien entity.</P>
<P>SPHERE starts out quite promising as it wraps the audience in the
intrigue of trying to find out where the spacecraft came from and what
the mysterious orb is supposed to be.  However, when the
action/thriller elements begin about halfway through the film, the
extension of this mystery only serves to confuse the viewer.  We are
given several twists of plot, keeping us guessing as to the origin of
the violence being wrought upon the investigating team.  Under other
circumstances, this might help to further the tension, but in this
film, it just doesn't work.  The result is a confusing mess that makes
you jump every once in a while.</P>
<P>One of the reasons we don't go along with the plot twists is because
we don't really care too much about the characters.  Goodman is
indecisive, Halperin is paranoid and suicidal, Fielding is insecure,
and Adams just plain weirds out soon after the film starts.  A scene
where Fielding and Adams compare the ages at which they earned their
first doctorates does very little to lend sympathy to the characters,
as does another scene where Goodman confesses he defrauded the
government for some quick cash.  It would seem that the character we
care the most about is Barnes, who is outside the neurotic realm of
the super-educated.  Barnes is a smart fellow, but he's also more
dedicated to the job at hand than any of the others, and we just hope
that their foibles don't prevent him from getting out of the whole
thing alive.</P>
<P>Peter Coyote also provides the most convincing performance in spite of
the big-name cast.  Coyote delivers his lines well enough to make us
believe he must at the same time complete his mission and juggle the
egos and vagaries of civilians.  No big flourishes for him, just good
solid acting of a character with whom we can sympathize.  Stone, on
the other hand, flourishes a few times too often as her character goes
down the emotionally unstable path.  It's just too bad those
flourishes aren't at least convincing.  Diametrically opposed is
Hoffman, who is too understated in his performance to be a leading man
here.  His role requires a strong performance; a real stand-out, and
we just don't get that.  Jackson's performance is good as usual, but
his talents are contorted in this film due to the strange avenues the
screenplay and direction take us.  A disjointed storyline makes him
near-psychotic one moment, then friendly the next.</P>
<P>In terms of visual effects, SPHERE suffers from the underwater
syndrome.  We all know that it is dark and gloomy a thousand feet
below the ocean's surface, but it doesn't help us out much to give us
a movie that tries to approximate this.  There's one scene where the
team is descending in a submarine to visit the spacecraft for the
first time.  Fielding looks out a viewport and says, "Look at the size
of that thing."  Cut to a view of the craft punctuated by a fanfare of
music.  Too bad we couldn't see much, or it might have actually been
impressive.</P>
<P>This film tries so hard to be a thinking thriller that it makes
efforts which only go through the motions and fail to captivate.  One
part of this involves time travel, and there is the revelation that if
the future has no record of the team finding the sphere, that must
mean they don't get out alive.  To tell you why this is in violation
of most time travel theory would be to give away much of the plot, so
suffice to say that much of the convolution seems only to dazzle the
audience with self-congratulatory cleverness that is not technically
or intelligently proficient.</P>
<P>As I stated previously, SPHERE is only the latest in a long line of
Crichton-based movies.  A question occurred to me while viewing this
film:  Why doesn't Michael Crichton just become a screenwriter?  After
all, every time he writes a novel, he must know it is destined to be
made into a movie.  Why not just write the screenplay and cut out all
that preliminary stuff?  The answer I came up with is that he can make
a whole lot of money off the novels first, and then make even more
money off the movie option.  People by the millions purchase his
books, and you know what?  It's because he's Michael Crichton, the guy
whose books get made into movies.  "He must be good," these people say
in the aisles of Barnes and Noble, "or else they wouldn't keep making
movies out of his novels."  Well, I've got an inside scoop for you,
folks.  He's begun to write with the mentality that each story will,
in fact, be filmed.  He's become lazy and ineffectual as a novelist.
You see, writing for a reader is very different from writing for a
moviegoer.  In a novel, you must be descriptive in an artful way so
that the reader is almost unaware how he or she knows what a character
is like.  To simply read off a list of traits, background, and
emotions is boring and insulting.  "Show, don't tell" is one of the
most elementary tenets of writing fiction.  When you write a
screenplay, however, you list as much as possible, so the producer,
director, cinematographer, casting agent and actors know what the film
will look like and what is expected of each character.  In his novels,
Crichton has begun to list.  Big time.  At the behest of a friend, I
began to read his latest literary offering, but I couldn't get past
the first fourth of the book because of the number of times the author
insulted my intelligence by listing traits about the characters and
telling me everything about them the moment they appeared in the
story.  Sad, really, to find that this has happened to the same man
who once wrote novels like "Coma" and "The Great Train Robbery."  The
only good thing I can say about Crichton today is that he has at least
continued to write from a wellspring of varied and interesting
subjects, unlike someone like John Grisham, who only changes WHERE the
lawyers work.  But that's another story....</P>
