<PRE>INNOCENCE
---------</PRE>
<P>Five decades ago, Andreas (Charles Tingwell) and Claire (Julia Blake)
shared a passionate romance in Belgium, following World War II, then went
their separate ways. Now, a half-century later, they discover that they
live in the same Australian city and it soon becomes evident that their
love of so long ago has not faded. Although Andreas is a widower, Claire is
still married and is torn between her loyalty to husband John (Terry
Norris) and the passion she feels for her former lover in "Innocence."</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>When widower Andreas (Charles 'Bud' Tingwell, "The Castle") discovers his 
first love resides in the same Australian city, he writes Claire (Julia
Blake, "Hotel de Love") a sentimental letter, begging for a meeting.  Claire,
married for forty-five years to John (Terry Norris, husband of costar Julia 
Blake), guiltily meets Andreas for dinner, but states that while it was nice 
seeing him, there's no reason to stir up old feelings.  But Andreas persists 
in pitching woo and Claire finds herself falling in love again in "Innocence."</P>
<P>Writer/director Paul Cox, who explored middle-aged romance in "Lonely Hearts"
and dying with dignity in "A Woman's Tale," combines those themes in this
septuagenarian love story.  Claire, whose marriage has been sexless for
twenty years, initially opts for keeping the current peace.  When Andreas
is asked to be present at the disinterment of his wife's grave, he asks
Claire to come for moral support.  She's so moved by his distress and his
appeal to stay the night with him, that she decides to celebrate life.
Claire also decides that she's too old to lie.</P>
<P>John, a man who hasn't voiced his true feelings in decades, is dumbstruck
by his wife's confession of infidelity.  He calls in their son David 
(Robert Menzies), a doctor, hoping for a physical or mental analysis that 
will explain things.  He tries to physically restrain Claire from going out, 
then tries to woo her back.  His delighted surprise at hearing her tell an 
off-color joke is both touching in the depth of feeling Norris brings to the 
scene and telling in how little he really knows the woman he's spent most of 
his life with.  Norris gives a powerful and layered performance.</P>
<P>The film belongs to Julia Blake, however, a truly beautiful woman who
glows in her rediscovered love.  Blake conveys the heartbreak of breaking
another's heart while simultaneously expressing the joy of living to the
fullest.  Tingwell makes Andreas the more Bohemian, worldly choice next
to the staid John, but his performance has just a touch of self congratulation
about it.  Claire tells Andreas, whose strict father came between them all
those years ago, that she doesn't think he fought hard enough for her then
and Tingwell's portray of Andreas keeps him slightly suspect the second
time around.  </P>
<P>Cox has written some beautiful dialogue, from reflections on the definition
of a memory to Andreas' humorous baiting of a hospital chaplain, although he
occasionally meanders into overt melodrama.  Reflections are featured visually</P>
<P>throughout the film as well, from flashbacks of the young lovers seen in the 
windows of a passing train to Claire's peering into a mirror (where her
younger self dissolves into her present).  Overall, however, the film has the 
look of a British TV production.</P>
<P>"Innocence" stumbles occasionally, but it's refreshing to see senior citizens
treated as sexual beings with needs and desires and the ability to light
up a room with their presence.  You may never see your grandparents in quite
the same light again.</P>
