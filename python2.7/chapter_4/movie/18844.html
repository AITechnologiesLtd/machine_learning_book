<PRE>MY FAVORITE MARTIAN
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR></PRE>
<P>Rating: ** (out of ****)
Walt Disney / 1:33 / 1999 / PG (bawdy humor, brief nudity)
Cast: Jeff Daniels; Christopher Lloyd; Elizabeth Hurley; Daryl Hannah;
Wallace Shawn; Ray Walston; Michael Lerner; Christine Ebersole
Director: Donald Petrie
Screenplay: Sherri Stoner; Deanna Oliver<HR></P>
<P>As if last spring's big-screen version of "Lost in Space" didn't scream,
"Danger, movie-goers! Danger!", here's yet another unnecessary updating
of a beloved 1960s TV chestnut. Martian the sitcom ran from '63 through
'66 and featured wacky Ray Walston as an extraterrestrial living amongst
earthlings in human disguise; "Martian" the movie runs 93 minutes and
gives equally wacky Christopher Lloyd the Walston role, though Walston
himself does show up in a supporting turn that eventually pays heed to
the his former self.</P>
<P>That in-joke will be lost on kiddies, but they'll probably be content
enough with the film's potty humor, lively pace and fun special effects.
Adults, on the other hand, may only enjoy "My Favorite Martian" if they
were fans of its original incarnation, or if they don't mind gazing at
pretty female co-stars Darryl Hannah and Elizabeth Hurley (though both
are arguably miscast). The story - Lloyd's "Uncle Martin" crashes in
Santa Barbara and is taken under the wing of a harried television
producer (Jeff Daniels in the Bill Bixby part) - accomplishes pretty
much what the series did in just its pilot and finale, albeit with far
better production values, moments of lavish lunacy (like a cool
climactic alien rampage) and computer-generated antennae.</P>
<P>There's some decent physical shtick here, and even a few chuckle-worthy
moments, but most of the comedy is provided by a talking, gyrating space
uniform named Zoot (brought to, uh, life by the voice of "Seinfeld"'s
Wayne Knight). This Zoot suit is no riot, and neither, unfortunately, is
too much of "My Favorite Martian."<HR></P>
