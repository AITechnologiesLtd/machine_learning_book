<PRE>RIVER OF GOLD (O RIO DO OURO)</PRE>

<P>   An unusual film, "River of Gold" will find an audience
among those who like the format of the early, silent films
coupled with the melodrama, the mythic resonance, and the
poetry of opera.  The story itself, if taken literally, is absurd to
the point of laughter and must be enjoyed--if at all--with the
understanding that it's anything but naturalistic in concept.</P>
<P>   The story, directed by Oporto-born Paulo Rocha, takes
place in the Port wine country of Portugal and features the
red-haired, aging Carolina (Isabel Ruth), the elderly but
passionate Antonio (Lima Duarte), the lovely, seductive Melita
(Joana Barcia), and a mysterious gypsy fortune teller who is
ostensibly a jewelry salesman, Ze of Gold.</P>
<P>   The tale begins its tragic course as Antonio courts Carolina
at the home of her blind father and pleases the old man by
announcing that he is in search of "a wife, wealth, and
honor."  The two are married, but both have eyes for others. 
Antonio, who saves Carolina's goddaughter Melita from
drowning, develops a passion for her young body, to the
jealous disgust of Carolina--who is herself enamored of the
mysterious Ze, whom she and Melita later meet on a train. 
When the gypsy passenger reads Melita's palm, he is
horrified to discover that she is not the innocent girl she
seems (despite her pregnancy), but is linked to a horrible
murder some time back in which she killed her lover and
painted his bedroom with his blood.  In the operatic style, a
Portuguese chorus of women washing their clothes on the
banks of the "blood-stained" river sing of the horror of the
gruesome murder.</P>
<P>   As Carolina's desire for vengeance against her straying
husband churns like the current of o rio do duoro, director
Rocha captures the intensity of her expressions, in one scene
portraying her as a knockoff of Greta Garbo's title role in
"Queen Christina."   This is the sort of narrative that would
work much better as a full-blown opera but seems ludicrous
as a straightforward film.  Unlike "Black Orpheus," its poetry
is strained as though Rocha needs to assure the audience
that he, too, knows that "The River of Gold" does not work in
its present filmed format but is meant to be taken
metaphorically.  Joana Barcia is impressive as the young
Melita, her look of fear fascinating as she seems so
frightened of her godmother that she freezes when tied to a
chair and spread with honey to supply meat for hundreds of
bees.  The raw beauty of rural Portugal is captured by Elso
Roque's camera, which focuses on the hilly terrain to
underscore the timelessness of the rustic culture.</P>
