<PRE>.                       THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1998 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Sure it's ridiculous.  Sure it's in generally poor taste.  So what? 
That's what makes THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY so good.</P>
<P>     If you've seen the trailer, you know the story: Ted (Stiller) finally
gets to go out with Mary (Diaz) to the prom and is stymied by a freak zipper
accident, sending him into years of therapy to wonder what-coulda-been. 
Thirteen years later, we find that he's not the only one fixated on Mary...
as no fewer than five suitors appear to win her heart.</P>
<P>     Done one way, this could've been a Disney movie.  Done the Farrelly
brothers (DUMB AND DUMBER) way, it's anything but.</P>
<P>     Frankly, I prefer the Farrelly brothers way, because it's just so damn
hilarious.  Most of the funny bits have unfortunately be spoiled by the
trailer, but it's no matter; MARY's still got plenty of juice in her.</P>
<P>     (Note to potential filmgoers: The overly sensitive need not apply.)</P>
