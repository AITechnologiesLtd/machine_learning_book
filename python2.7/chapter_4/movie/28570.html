 Memento (2000) 4 stars out of 4. Starring Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss,
Joe Pantoliano, Mark Boone Junior, Stephen Tobolowsky and Jorja Fox.
Screenplay by Christopher Nolan based on a short story by Jonathan
Nolan. Directed by Christopher Nolan. Rated. R.</P>
<P> Memento is an experience for serious filmgoers, those who have the
stamina to focus on what is happening on the screen.</P>
<P> Memento is a cinematic jigsaw puzzle; turn away for a moment and you
might miss a clue. This is a feature in which the audience is as much in
the dark as the protagonist.</P>
<P> Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is a former insurance investigator
suffering from short-term memory loss inflicted the night his wife was
raped and murdered. Leonard uses notes, tattoos and snapshots to hunt
down the man responsible for shattering his life.</P>
<P> Yet how do you know whoís your friend and whoís your enemy when you
canít remember meeting them 10 minutes earlier?</P>
<P> Director-screenwriter Christopher Nolan, who adapted the script from a
short story written by his brother, Jonathan, begins at the end and
works his way backwards. The film opens with a bang and the viewer then
traces what led Leonard to that moment.</P>
<P> Leonard is like a walking ghost, explaining his condition to everyone
he meets, not realizing he has met these people before and already
filled them in on his mental state.</P>
<P> This is a film in which you cannot really describe what transpires. You
simply go along for the ride, watching as Leonard tries to put together
the pieces of his life.</P>
<P> Memento is a most original and arresting feature. It is
audience-involvement cinema, in which the viewer plays detective along
with Leonard. Your allegiances shift from scene to scene as more and
more of Leonardís past gets filled in. No one is whom they seem to be.</P>
<P> As the movie progresses ó or is it regresses? ó you question your
perception of events as well as motivations.
Pearce gives a dynamic performance as a man constantly in a fog, relying
on snapshots, scraps of papers and clues tattooed to his body as he
attempts to reconstruct his life.</P>
<P> Carrie-Anne Moss is cynical and weary as the bartender who becomes
involved in Leonardís quest.</P>
<P> Also on hand is that wonderful character actor Joe Pantoliano (best
known as the turncoat in The Matrix, and currently seen as the fierce
Ralphie on HBOís The Sopranos). Pantolianoís Teddy is a wisecracking
individual whoís involvement with Leonard is suspect.</P>
<P> Director Nolan does a masterful job of keeping the audience in his
vise. He grabs you from the outset and leads you through his mental
maze.</P>
<P> Memento is a movie that has to be seen from the beginning. Miss one
scene and nothing else will make sense. It is a masterful piece of
filmmaking, one of the cleverest and inventive works to hit the screen
in a long time.</P>
<P> If you like puzzles, then Memento will floor you. This is not for those
who indulge in mindless action. This is a thinking person's feature that
gives you much to ponder.</P>
<PRE> Itís a gem.</PRE>
