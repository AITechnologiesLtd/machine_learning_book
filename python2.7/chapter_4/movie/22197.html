<PRE>Tarzan And The Lost City
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Casper Van Dien; Jane March; Steven Waddington; Winston Ntshona &
Rapulana Seiphemo</P>
<P>The only two really good things that I can say about Tarzan And The Lost
City are as follows: Jane March was very cute as Jane, and the movie was
thankfully under 90 minutes in length. If you haven't already figured it
out, I didn't like this movie very much.</P>
<P>The plot was boring and contrived to the extreme. Tarzan (Casper Van Dien)
has now left the jungle and living in civilized society. He is just days
away from his impending marriage to Jane, played by the aptly named Jane
March. Back in his former home of Africa, a group of looters has found the
key to locating a lost city. (Mind you I never really figured out why they
actually wanted to find this city.) Anyway, Tarzan's old jungle friend
appears to him in a vision. Tarzan realizes that he must return to Africa to
help stop the bad guys from finding the lost city. He leaves Jane (his first
mistake, in my opinion) and travels to Africa. Of course, Jane is hot on her
ape man's heals. The two of them are reunited in Africa where they do battle
with the bad guys. Sound like a dumb explanation of the plot? It's actually
an improvement over the real thing.</P>
<P>The acting is just plain awful. I'm not quite sure what Casper Van Dien was
doing in this film, but it wasn't acting. Jane March wasn't a heck of a lot
better, but at least she is easy on the eyes. Compounding the bad acting was
the fact that in many places the dialogue had obviously been re-recorded,
and I've seen better dubbing in some old Bruce Lee movies. Added to the
sound problems was the cinematography. This film was filled with beautiful
African scenery. But the panoramic scenery shots looked overexposed to me.
Quite frankly, I think you could probably do a better job capturing the
beauty of Africa with a camcorder than this bunch did with professional film
equipment.</P>
<P>Then we have the special effects. "Special effects in a Tarzan movie?" you
are no doubt asking yourself? Yes friends, the writers injected some very
out of place supernatural elements into the story. Probably for the sake of
using CGI, since it did nothing but hurt the story. In most parts, they
weren't bad, just nothing special. But, they were more than a little on the
hokey side. Except of course, when we got to the ridiculous climax of this
movie. The grand finale's special effects went right into the toilet at that
point. It almost looked like they had run out of money. These effects were
of noticeably lower quality than those in the rest of the film and looked
like something in an amateur video production.</P>
<P>I took one lesson away from watching Tarzan And The Lost city -- ape men and
bones that morph into skeletal warriors don't mix. Stay far away from this
version of Tarzan.</P>
