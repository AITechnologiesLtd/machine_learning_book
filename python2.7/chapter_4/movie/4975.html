<P>     One of the most unfortunate aspects of a courtroom thriller is the 
tendency to degenerate into preposterous melodrama.  It's as if the 
basic situation of having a person on trial for their life isn't 
inherently powerful enough.  As a result, cheap theatrics are thrown in 
to spice things up, and, in the process, wreck any semblance of 
credibility.  PRIMAL FEAR, director Gregory Hoblit's adaptation of 
William Diehl's novel, is an obvious example.  At times, it's taut, 
sharp, and astute, but those qualities are overwhelmed by a storyline 
that takes too many wrong turns.</P>
<P>     The big "twist" at the end (which won't be much of a surprise to 
anyone who has seen more than a handful of courtroom thrillers) isn't 
the only thing that hurts PRIMAL FEAR, since nearly every scene in the 
last half-hour has something wrong with it.  Although the film would 
like the audience to believe that it's addressing important issues about 
justice and court procedures, those things are mere window dressing for 
a tawdry plot that involves sex-obsessed archbishops, suspects with 
multiple personalities, and a corrupt prosecutor.  We've seen all these 
things before in more cleverly-written screenplays.</P>
<P>     One thing that PRIMAL FEAR does well, at least at the outset, is to 
present an uncompromising picture of a fast-talking, high-profile 
defense attorney.  Martin Vail (Richard Gere) isn't in law because he 
believes in its purity or some equally naive drivel -- he's there 
because he likes the money, the power, and the spotlight.  In his words, 
"Why gamble with money when you can gamble with people's lives?"  When 
asked whether he has to believe in a client's innocence to present a 
defense, Vail retorts, "You don't know [whether he's guilty].  You don't 
ask.  You don't care.  You do the... job."  He's jaded and callous, so 
it's disappointing when the film turns him into a crusader struggling 
with issues of conscience.  This development doesn't make him three-
dimensional; it makes him inconsistent and unfathomable.</P>
<P>     The story centers around Vail's latest case -- he's defending a 19-
year old altar boy, Aaron Stampler (Edward Norton), who is accused of 
brutally murdering the beloved archbishop of Chicago.  The headline-
chasing Vail is taking the case pro bono for its publicity value.  His 
opponent, prosecutor Janet Venable (Laura Linney), is Vail's ex-lover 
and ex-protege.  Frankly, we could have done without all the out-of-
court interaction between these two -- it's extraneous padding that 
expands the too-long running time.</P>
<P>     Is Aaron guilty, or is he the victim of a frame-up?  What dark 
secrets lurk in the archbishop's past?  And how can the investigators in 
this case be so incredibly obtuse that they miss so many obvious things?  
PRIMAL FEAR tries to answer the first two questions.  It doesn't care 
much about the third, and that's one of its problems.  </P>
<P>     Richard Gere does what Richard Gere has been doing in every film 
since his last real performance (in SOMMERSBY) -- he looks dapper and 
executes his lines with workmanlike efficiency.  Laura Linney, who 
recently appeared in CONGO, is adequate in the largely thankless role of 
Vail's adversary.  Despite their prominent billing, neither John Mahoney 
(as Janet's boss) nor Alfre Woodard (as the judge) is afforded 
significant exposure.  The only actor who does anything memorable is 
Edward Norton, whose performance might remind viewers of Kevin Spacey's 
Oscar-winning turn in THE USUAL SUSPECTS.</P>
<P>     Even had PRIMAL FEAR trimmed its length to something more 
reasonable, it still wouldn't have been involving.  The flat, 
unsympathetic characters generate no interest and the overplotted story 
offers more cliches than legitimate surprises.  Most of the film's 
better aspects, like Vail's cynicism about the judicial process, fall by 
the wayside to facilitate the absurd conclusion.  Despite high 
production standards and a slick advertising campaign, PRIMAL FEAR is as 
trite and routine as any made-for-TV courtroom drama.  </P>
