<PRE>               A film review by Freddie Elmer Mullins</PRE>
<PRE>                Copyright 1996 Freddie Elmer Mullins</PRE>
<PRE>KIDS IS DEFINITELY NOT CHILDS PLAY</PRE>
<P>        New On Video:  Very few movies have the courage to follow
through with its convictions when the sledding gets rough.
Many of todays films ask harsh questions, but try for a
predictable happy ending to the problems they claim to be
exposing.  Larry Clarks Kids is one of the notable exceptions
to this trend.  </P>
<P>The story begins with teenager Telly(newcomer
Leo Fitzpatrick) taking advantage of his latest teenage sexual
conquest.  His soothing of the girls fears keys the audience to
the fact that Telly is singing an old song.  It seems that he
has little else in this life, and his sole enjoyment is the
taking of a girls virginity.  Telly and his friend
Casper(Justin Pierce) live from one party, sexual encounter, or
taking of drugs to the next. When one of Tellys former
conquests, Jennifer(Chloe Sevigny), discovers she is HIV
positive, she tracks him all over Manhattan to try to stop him
before another virgin is corrupted. </P>
<P>Kids follows Telly & Casper
from one vignette to another over a 24-hour period in
Manhattan, with the themes of personal gratification,
bestiality, and hedonism exhibited to the highest degree.  The
kids in Kids inhabit a harrowing world of innocence lost with
pleasure justifying any means to reach it.  Larry Clark has
published several famous collections of urban photography, and
he has not changed his approach with the quasi-documentary
quality found in Kids.  </P>
<P>He creates an entire culture for his
characters by almost entirely removing any adults from the
film.  The kids are in their own world, and they are
comfortable with it.  They understand its subtleties and
nuances without having to verbalize anything.  They are
pressurized containers that spew forth violence, excessive
amounts of profanity, or flagrant sexuality.  They are a kind
of earlier version of Malcolm McDowells Alex in A Clockwork
Orange(1971).  They exist to please themselves, and no one will
stand in their way.  </P>
<P>Clark makes no judgments about what these
children do, nor does he attempt to ascertain what made them
this way.  His camera only records the fact that they do exist
and are a force to be reckoned.  No movie since Abel Ferarras
The Bad Lieutenant has examined the dark nature of sexuality
and emotional isolation in an urban setting.  The use of New
York locales also make for an extremely true to life
experience, much like The Panic in Needle Park(1971).  The
viewer never gets the impression that any acting takes place;
its just life as usual.  (Unrated, 95 minutes, Vidmark
Entertainment)</P>
