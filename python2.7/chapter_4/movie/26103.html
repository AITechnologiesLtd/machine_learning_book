Susan Granger's review of "UNDER SUSPICION" (Lions Gate Films)</PRE>
<P>  Powerhouse performances propel this tense, gripping
psychological thriller set amidst the carnivalesque festival of San
Sebastian in Puerto Rico.  Morgan Freeman plays a local police chief
who summons a prominent tax attorney - that's Gene Hackman - to his
office for an interrogation prior to a gala fund-raising party that
the attorney is hosting at a posh hotel across the street. There have
been a series of grisly murders of young girls in the precinct and,
for reasons that later become clear, Freeman suspects that Hackman is
involved in the sordid scandal. But why Hackman, who lives in a
magnificent villa with a sultry trophy-wife (Monica Bellucci) whom he
describes as "a beautiful woman who moves through life unchallenged"?
Yet, as Hackman nervously flicks his fancy cigarette lighter, there's
something suspicious about him, as a cocky young detective (Thomas
Jane) repeatedly points out. And the ultra-courteous Freeman, who
would like to be the next superintendent, cleverly reads the
desperation in Hackman's body language, maintaining that he's only
trying to clarify some details. Adapted by screenwriters Peter Iliff
and Tom Provost from Claude Miller's French cult classic, "Garde a
Vue" ("The Inquisitor"), and directed by Stephen Hopkins ("Lost in
Space," "The Ghost and the Darkness"), the character-driven
crime-mystery unfolds, revealing how both men have painful pasts
filled with secrets and lies. "You peel my onion down to the nub,"
admits Hackman. But the tedious repetition of the cross-questioning
and the too-frequent flashbacks detract from the narrative, diluting
its impact as the plot takes a dangerous, tortured twist. On the
Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Under Suspicion" is a disturbing 6,
as deceptive as the costumes of the San Sebastian street carnival.</P>
