<PRE>A Video Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Fred A. Leuchter Jr., a man who improved the electric chair, gallows, and the 
lethal injection machine in the 1980s, should not expect his research to 
concern a large audience. After all, only those receiving capital punishment 
would ever get to experience his work. So maybe Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall 
of Fred A. Leuchter, Jr. is supposed to educate its audience about his 
progress in the field. We certainly learn more about the before and after of 
the electrocution process than most will ever need to know. Leuchter is so 
straightforward when he explains why two shocks of electricity must be used, 
or lists everything that could go wrong with a hanging that his graphic 
statements are never short of sickening. He is dismayed there is no interest 
in making executions more humane. Looking for any way possible to increase 
awareness of his research, Leuchter agreed to travel to Poland to investigate 
sites thought to have been gas chambers during the Holocaust for Ernst 
Zundel. Zundel published a pamphlet claiming the Holocaust was a hoax, and 
was brought to court in Canada for printing something he knew was false. 
After some rather amateurish investigation, Fred believes there was no way 
any type of gas chamber could have existed. One gets an even better sense of 
this disturbing man as the film goes on from interviews with his wife and 
others.</P>
<P>This is probably one of the closest attempts to making a documentary horror 
film ever. Fred A. Leuchter Jr. is one of the most interesting subjects to 
come along in a while. When he drones on (sounding amazingly like Woody 
Allen) about why a lethal injection machine is totally different from an 
electric chair he sent chills down my spine. Even scarier is the thought that 
this man is an actual person. His odd appearance, Austin Powers yellow teeth, 
and bizarre coffee addiction makes him even creepier. Errol Morris has an 
exciting visual style that is defined, but never glossy. The movie is always 
attention grabbing for its entire ninety-one minute running time.  </P>
<P>Mr. Death certainly raises questions of free speech. Regardless how many Jews 
disappeared from the planet, Zundel’s trial does raise questions that could 
perhaps be relevant to other cases or situations. Queries also arise about 
the accuracy of Fred’s research. Not only is seeing him illegally rummaging 
through piles of rubble surrounding Holocaust ruins disrespectful, it is 
downright frightening. In one interview the scientist who tested Leuchter’s 
samples of walls and soil from Poland for traces of cyanide reveals he 
probably did the tests wrong. Since cyanide only leaves traces about the size 
of a tenth of a human hair, it is uncertain whether or not the negative 
results are accurate. Looking into his eyes as he admits to probably 
performing the wrong procedures is daunting. These scientific errors could 
happen to you.</P>
<P>This is not an entirely great film, but certainly a unique one that looks at 
death and persons who do not believe in the Holocaust with care and a sense 
of fairness. This is a rare documentary because it examines both sides of the 
issue. Take a journey with Fred A. Leuchter Jr. and you will be disturbed and 
entertained in a way different to anything you’ve experienced before.</P>
