<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>I grew up around horses, but I never paid any attention to them.  That
was for girls, I thought, though my mother and sister frequently tried
to get me to ride their horses.  I would watch them from my bedroom
window on occasion, and the only thing I could ever think about was how
intensely boring it seemed.  The horses certainly didn't look happy, and
the few times I did actually attempt to ride, the only thing I got from
it was a throbbing sensation in places where throbbing sensations are
not welcome.  </P>
<P>I was mildly interested in seeing The Horse Whisperer, but not because
of the horses.  I wanted to see it because of its stars, Robert Redford
and Kristin Scott Thomas.  It turns out, though, that I had developed a
sense of respect for horses through all those years of idly watching
them carry around the female members of my family.  I'm fairly certain
that Redford, who also directed, intended the audience members to
observe the horses in this film as characters.  I think he succeeded,
not only in this arena, but in many others -- The Horse Whisperer is a
visually stunning film, and often a moving human drama.  </P>
<P>The film opens with tragedy:  young Grace MacLean (Scarlett Johansson)
and her friend are riding their horses on the icy countryside outside of
New York; they stumble onto the road, where a truck barrels into them,
killing Grace's friend and seriously injuring Grace's horse, Pilgrim. 
We then meet Grace's mother, Annie (Kristin Scott Thomas) and father,
Robert (Sam Neill), a couple whom, we suspect, are married out of
convenience.  Grace recovers from the accident, but has her right leg
amputated; from then on, she's a somber and extremely depressed girl.</P>
<P>Although Pilgrim's injuries are severe, and the horse seems to have
undergone intense psychological torture, Annie refuses to let the horse
be put down.  She seeks out a man known to do miracles with horses; his
name is Tom Booker (Redford).  She takes Grace and the horse and drives
out to his ranch in Montana, at which point Tom begins working with
Pilgrim, even though the horse seems beyond help.</P>
<P>Perhaps the best thing about The Horse Whisperer is Redford's directing
and imagery.  Even without a story and characters, this film would have
been breathtaking to behold.  The opening credits roll simultaneously
with incredible footage of horses dashing about on what look to be sand
dunes; the colors are dark and full, the horses are silhouettes, and the
moment is beautiful.  Many scenes in the film have this quality -- there
are several shots of things that just look nice and have nothing to do
with the story directly, but add perfectly to the quiet and subtle tone
of the film.  It's a long picture, and Redford's direction is perfectly
paced:  the film never gets boring or loses the audience.</P>
<P>Almost equaling Redford's near-perfect visuals are the performances,
particularly from the two leading females.  Thomas is a beautiful,
commanding actress, and though this is only the second film I've had the
pleasure of seeing her in (the other being The English Patient), she
proves in just two roles that she has the rare capacity to hold an
entire film together by sheer force of talent.  Young Scarlett Johansson
is equally good; this is a fantastic performance, especially when
considering the actress' age.  Redford is also good, though he slightly
underplays his character in parts.  Sam Neill is, unfortunately, not
used to his full abilities (with the exception of one wonderful scene
towards the end in which he has a serious talk with his wife).  </P>
<P>I enjoyed The Horse Whisperer, but my main complaint lies in the
script, which feels sloppy at times.  There are a few scenes here --
like an important moment between mother and daughter -- that seem to
fall flat because of dialogue, or characterizations, or both.  Grace's
dialogue, for instance, is far too sharp for a girl her age; and, at
times, the dynamics between Tom and Annie are nebulous when they need to
be more clear.  The overall focus is also skewed between many things: 
Grace's struggle with Pilgrim, the mother/daughter relationship, and the
Tom/Annie relationship.  All of these are well-developed, but after
leaving the film, I wasn't sure what was supposed to be central.  I am
thankful that Redford steered clear of manipulation (though there are
scenes clearly intended to be tear-jerkers), but the ending seems an
unlikely solution to the situation.</P>
<P>All in all, I highly recommend the film, for I imagine most people will
enjoy it thoroughly.  There is a lot to admire here, from the truly
astonishing imagery to the first-class performances and cast.  It's a
moving film that works on many levels, and just barely escapes the
greatness it might have achieved with a few script changes and a more
objective editing job.  On a personal level, the film forced me to
notice horses in a way I never did while growing up with them, and I
think that many people might get the same feelings I did out of
Redford's insightful vision.</P>
