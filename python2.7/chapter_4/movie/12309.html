<PRE>(UK, 1998)</PRE>
<P>  Seen on 25 April 1998 with Andrea at the SONY Lincoln Square for $10
  (including teleticket fee).</P>
<P>   *Sliding Doors* takes a look at what would happen if you missed your
   train by a few seconds. Helen (Gwyneth Paltrow) goes to work one
   morning, only to find out she's been sacked and then goes to take the
   District Line tube home. (By now you must've figured the film is set
   in London). After missing her train, the camera backs up to the moment
   a young girl got in the way and takes her out of the way, so Helen can
   get on the train. Henceforth, the movie skillfully alternates between
   the tale of Helen coming home to find her boyfriend Gerry (John Lynch)
   in bed with his old girlfriend Lydia (Jeanne Tripplehorn), and the
   tale of her just having missed that scene.</P>
<P>   So, the stories ensue in similar paths. The outraged Helen
   moves out, dyes her hair blonde (this helps distinguish the two
   storylines), and gets involved with James (John Hannah of *Four
   Weddings and a Funeral*) as she starts her own PR company, and deals
   with Gerry wanting her back.</P>
<P>   In the other storyline, the cuckolded Helen struggles along waiting
   tables and working two jobs while Gerry "writes his novel" and
   continues to cheat on Helen with Lydia, who is pressing for him to
   make a break with Helen.</P>
<P>   A lot of women I know just hate Gwyneth Palthrow (she's "too
   beautiful" or something), but Sliding Doors might change their minds.
   She gives an engaging, fresh performance to both "realities" shown in
   the film. John Hannah (who has a delightful Scottish accent) is
   equally wonderful as James. The supporting roles of Anna (played by
   another Scot, Zara Turner) and Russell (Douglas McFerran) as Helen and
   Gerry's best friends (respectively) also do a wonderful job. McFerran
   is particularly good in his role as Gerry's amused but unsympathetic
   confessor.</P>
<P>   Lynch and Tripplehorn, especially the latter, are a bit over the top
   as the panicky cheat and the bitchy American lover. But they are not
   so over the top that it destroys the romantic comedy mood created by
   first-time director and writer Peter Howitt. It was very surprising to
   discover that he had never directed before. Some of the night scenes
   on the Thames with the lights of a suspension bridge on the Thames are
   among the best ever seen in a romantic comedy.</P>
<P>   *Sliding Doors* features many funny moments as well as touching,
   romantic ones. One of my favorite lines came from Tripplehorn, who
   tells Gerry, "We know what we want, but we don't tell you what we
   want, but we reserve the right to get angry when you don't know.
   That's what makes us so fascinating, and so scary!" In another, as
   Russell laughs at Gerry's plight, he tells him, "If it weren't for you
   I don't know how I'd make it a whole week before the next Seinfeld."</P>
<P>   As ever, I recommend you see it on the big screen, especially for the
   full effect of the night scenes on the Thames.</P>
