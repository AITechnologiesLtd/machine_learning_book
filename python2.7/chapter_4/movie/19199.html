<PRE>Big Daddy
A review by Stephen Sills</PRE>
<PRE>Rated PG-13 (crude humor, language)</PRE>
<P>I was genuinely surprised by this film.  That almost all of the
attempted drama completely fails is no surprise.  Strangely enough, 
though, most of the humor fails too. Adam Sandler is by no means a
great actor, but at least he can normally be counted on to be
consistently funny.  Save for a few choice moments, his performance is
rather subdued here, and most of the one-liners and verbal humor fall
relatively flat.  This film lacks the charm of "The Wedding Singer"
and the stupid, albeit occasionally hilarious, humor of "The Water
Boy."  In short, it's a pretty drab experience.</P>
<P>Sandler plays Sonny Koufax, a law school graduate who has amassed an
obscenely large fortune from a frivolous lawsuit.  Having wisely
invested the money to the point where he can live off of it, he spends
his days lounging around his apartment, venturing out into the real
world once a week as a toll booth attendant.  Sonny's perfectly happy
with his existence, but his girlfriend, Vanessa (Kristy Swanson), is
fed up with his immaturity and wants to move on "to the next level" of
his life.</P>
<P>Sonny begins to see her point after she leaves him, and it is
reinforced when his roommate decides to move on to that next level and
successfully proposes to his girlfriend, Corinne (Leslie Mann), a
ditsy, airheaded former Hooters girl.  Getting married to a stupid, 
big-breasted bimbo doesn't really strike me as a sign of maturity, but
it does to Sonny, who finally realizes that he has to do something 
to prove his worth to Vanessa.</P>
<P>That thing comes in the form of Julian (Cole and Dylan Sprouse), a
young boy who is literally dropped off at his doorstep.  Julian is 
Sonny's roommate's illegitimate son.  His roommate, conveniently
enough, is out of town, so Sonny decides to take responsibility for
Julian while he is away.  He does this for a while, enjoys it, and
decides that he'd like the situation to be permanent.  Masquerading as
his roommate, he officially gains guardianship of Julian and attempts
to use his newfound responsibility as proof to Vanessa that he's
ready to proceed with his life.  Unfortunately for Sonny, she has
already found someone else, thus leaving him to care for Julian alone.
The romanticism of the situation quickly fades when the kid starts
having normal kid problems (bed-wetting, a need for continuous 
attention, and a lust for sweets to name a few).  Needless to say,
Sonny doesn't handle the situation very well.</P>
<P>"Big Daddy" is occasionally funny, but it lacks the big laughs
necessary to make a truly successful comedy.  Sandler's comedy works
when it's totally silly and stupid, a fact that was fully realized in
"The Water Boy."  The bonding scenes between Sonny and Julian are 
somewhat amusing, but Sandler simply isn't a good enough actor to pull
something like this off very well.  This might seem strange, but
Tom Hanks would probably be far better suited for this role.</P>
<P>The film is also bogged down by some embarrassingly smarmy moments
that further dull it's already not-too-sharp comedic edge.  While I
can appreciate some occasional gratuitous sentiment (I was actually
somewhat affected by the silly emotional scenes in "Armageddon,"
for Pete's sake), this film goes, way, way too far.  The creators seem
to think that they have a credible drama on their hands when they
simply do not.</P>
<P>"Big Daddy" features one of the strangest product placements that I've
ever seen.  The product in question is the Hooters restaurant
chain, but the film is certainly not complementary of their
waitresses.  The bimboish nature of Corinne's job is continually
brought up and joked at, but this is done so frequently that it gets
incredibly old, and is obviously a product placement when viewed with
the fact that the movie ends in a Hooters restaurant.  I've never seen
a product placement that ridicules the product that it is advertising.</P>
<P>In the end, "Big Daddy" is occasionally amusing, but not enough so to
get a recommendation from me.  Granted, it's not nearly as disgusting
as "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me," but it's also not as
funny.  As such, they both even out to the same score.</P>
