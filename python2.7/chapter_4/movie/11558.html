<P>   "What should I wear," asks Max, a 7'7" man played by
Gherghe Muresan in director Michael Lehmann's leviathan
movie.  "Stay away from vertical stripes," quips his best
friend, Sam (Billy Crystal), in one of the many throwaway lines
of this sentimental comedy.  "My Giant" starts off like
something out of "Saturday Night Live" and ends up like the
conclusion of a Frank Capra film, mixing shtick, sentiment,
pathos and Hollywood satire in a brief story which works well
because of the chemistry between its two principal
performers.  The long and short of it is that Billy Crystal, one
of our most natural and funny comics, teams up beautifully
with Gheorghe Muresan, a Romanian basketball player for the
Washington Wizards, as an unlikely duo who teach each
other some of the most valuable lessons that could be offered
about life.  Each needs the other almost more than he can
imagine.  Sam, a second-rate, flat-broke talent agent, requires
an actor who can generate income for him.  Max, a lovesick
man living a secluded life in a Romanian monastery, pines for
his childhood sweetheart whom he cannot contact without
Sam's help.  Thinking that he is doing far more for his gangly
pal than he can ever get in return, Sam recovers his
innocence and learns to get a life.</P>
<P>   For Billy Crystal fans the opening scenes are a gem.  His
character, Sam, is driving through Romania to meet a young
actor who has employed him and who is now filming a
juvenile action movie complete with shields, swords and
cornball dialogue.  To avoid a flock of sheep that suddenly
cross his path, he swerves, flips over, and is about to drown
when he is saved by what appears to be two giant hands--
which he assumes are those of God Himself.  Waking up
before a team of silent monks looked over by a large crucifix,
he believes he's in heaven, but the wrong one: "My real name
is Kaminsky...get my drift?" he quips in the movie's greatest
one-liner.  Upon hearing an explanation from the 7'7" man
who saved him and who speaks fluent English, Sam believes
that this Max is just the guy who can save his career, one
who can act scary and perform the role of villain in many
movies to come.  As the two fly--first to New York where Sam
sees his estranged wife Serena (Kathleen Quinlan) and
adoring son Nick (Zane Carney), then to Vegas on the way to
Gallup, New Mexico, where Max's childhood sweetheart
resides--their friendship deepens. Sam soon learns a dismal
truth about his pal which changes his ideas about the
meaning of success and fulfillment.</P>
<P>   While some in the audience may not easily swallow the
sticky sentimentality that informs the final one-third of the
movie, "My Giant" is overall a likable film which, like many
others of the genre, begins with a barrage of sallies, runs into
the zaniness of cultural misunderstandings, and concludes
with the warm fuzziness which Crystal is so capable of
bringing off.  While Muresan may never achieve the superstar
status which Billy Crystal enjoys, his enthusiasm for acting
can be traced back to the very preparation he made for the
role.  Unable to speak much English at first, he was trained
by Crystal who had the large man read the script a great
many times and essentially memorize the entire story so that
he fully understood his role.  Life followed art in Pirandellian
fashion as both actor and his character struggle to master a
role that neither ever intended to pursue.  </P>
<P>   "My Giant" is not a major comedy or, despite the nature of
the eponymous character, a very original idea, but it should
please a diverse audience of assorted ages with its message
of tolerance and family values.  The picture is acted well and
features lovely country scenes filmed in the Czech Republic,
which doubles for Romania.  Rated PG.  Running Time: 97
minutes.  (C) 1998 Harvey Karten</P>
