<PRE>                        THE HORSE WHISPERER 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                    2 :-) :-) for the Marlborough Man</PRE>
<P>Cast: Robert Redford, Kristin Scott Thomas, Sam Neill, Scarlett
Johansson, Dianne Wiest, Chris Cooper, Ty Hillman, Catherine Bosworth

Screenplay: Richard LaGravenese, Eric Roth based on the novel by
Nicholas Evans</P>
<P>If you survived the 3 to 4 hour scenic footage of DANCES WITH WOLVES, or
the odd 2 to 3 hours of fly fishing in A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT, then
theoretically, you should have no problems sitting through this 3 hour
version of horse taming and beautiful Montana countryside. This film,
will either bore you to tears from its opening moments, or have the
exact opposite effect, and draw you into an intriguing story that is
filled with passion and traumatised psyche.</P>
<P>After witnessing one of the most horrific horse accidents I have come
across in my small life span, I have vowed never to get on these great
four legged beasts, ever. This is a story of healing, not only for a
young girl, but also for her horse that sustained horrific wounds during
a most tragic accident. An initially, emotionally detached mother
(Kristin Scott Thomas), fights to bring her daughter out of a morbid
depression. She searches out a horse doctor (Robert Redford) in vain
hopes that healing the horse-gone-mad, will also bring inner healing to
her daughter. This is where THE HORSE WHISPERER comes into the picture,
with a mixture of patience, firmness and of course whispering, the
doctor lures the emotionally unbalanced beast back into sanity.</P>
<P>Robert Redford in jeans and cowboy hat, now rugged appearance is
everybody's version of a Marlborough man, except for the cigarettes. He
is filled this movie with what many people want on a sunny summer
holiday. A house by a stream, yummy country style cooking, the surrounds
of loving family, plenty of horse riding over lush plains, and of course
a love interest to share the experience with. Kristin Scott Thomas is
looking very much like Emma Thompson, with her hair cropped short and
trying to exude the emotions of a bitter, angry mother, who doesn't know
what she wants in life until she meets the Marlborough Man. Then the
ever-dependable Sam Neil is the overly understanding, sensitive husband
who knows when to give his wife room to choose.</P>
<P>Overall, a very good effort, and worth looking at if you ever wanted to
see a well made picture about horses, emotional healing and romance.</P>
