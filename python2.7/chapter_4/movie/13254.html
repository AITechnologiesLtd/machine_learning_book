<PRE>Bodies, Rest & Motion (1993)</PRE>
<PRE>United States 1993
Director: Michael Steinberg</PRE>
<P>Cast: Phoebe Cates, Bridget Fonda, Tim Roth, Eric Stoltz</P>
<PRE>Rating: 4 out of 5</PRE>
<P>The word 'rest' in the title should be stressed since this is
a movie that lacks any action scenes at all. What does takes
place is more based on character development. The film starts
right in the middle of the lives of four people: Nick, Beth,
Carol and Sid. What they have done earlier is for the most
part only hinted at. Nick and Beth have a relationship and
have decided to move from Enfield, Arizona to Butte, Montana.
(and I who thought that Butte was pronounced slightly
different...) Carol is Nick's ex-girlfriend and Beth's best
friend, Sid is a joint-smoking painter that comes to repaint
their house before the new tenants move in.</P>
<P>Obviously based on a stage play, the problem with the movie
is that there's a lot of things left out. It's not obvious
that Nick and Beth are in love with each other, the reason
why Nick was fired from his job isn't mentioned. And why Nick
suddenly decide to go visit his parents remain a mystery,
when he hasn't seen them for many years.</P>
<P>Set in a small (fictional?) town in Arizona was a good move,
since this makes the film focus on the four characters and not
on their surroundings. The name of the city is not important,
this could take place anywhere with four young people in a
house discussing life and the future. Particularly impressive
is Bridget Fonda as Beth who end up in bed with Sid when
her fiance Nick leaves her. Not an actress that I have found
interesting earlier or seen many pictures with, but I'll
keep an eye on her in the future.</P>
<P>Interesting trivia: this was rated R in the US but rated
'barntillåten' in Sweden wich means that anyone at any
age can see it.</P>
