              ROMY AND MICHELE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION
                   A film review by Andrew Hicks
                    Copyright 1997 Andrew Hicks</PRE>
<PRE>(1997) **1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        Most of Hollywood is composed of revenge fantasies, of 
people who still carry hatchets around from their less-than-perfect 
formative years. Once everyone's eyes are on them, they can make the 
cool people look bad, make their parents out to be idiots, show their 
bossy superiors as hypocrites, and so on. ROMY AND MICHELE'S 
HIGH SCHOOL REUNION crosses that with a coming-of-age of '80s 
teen comedies. Age, not maturity. The characters are still as 
caricaturistic as ever, although a witty script and buddies Mira 
Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow make it likable cinematic trash.</P>
<P>        Sorvino and Kudrow are, of course, the title characters -- 
Romy and Michele, a couple ditzes still pretty much stuck in the 
Valley Girl era and still bitter about the pains exacted upon them in 
high school by the A-crowd. In the ten years since high school, 
they've accompished nothing aside from Romy's low profile clerk job. 
They live together, alone, spending their nights fishing for men in 
L.A. dance clubs or watching PRETTY WOMAN for the 36th time. 
And they still get teary-eyed when the snobs in the clothing store 
finally let Julia Roberts shop there.</P>
<P>        In a time when movies from less than ten years ago have 
become "classics" that are cultural reference points for the uncultured 
boobs of Generation X, it's inevitable entire movies will be patterned 
the same way. If you don't believe me, sit there with a stopwatch 
during SCREAM and see if HALLOWEEN isn't mentioned every five 
minutes. The entire theme of ROMY AND MICHELE'S HIGH SCHOOL 
REUNION comes from that one replayed PRETTY WOMAN scene. 
These women have been shut out of the high-life and fully expect to 
receive the apologetic acceptance of the peers that rejected them 
when Kim Wilde's remake of "You Keep Me Hangin' On" was #1.</P>
<P>        So when Romy runs into bitter woman in black Janeane 
Garofalo (a former classmate whose claim to fame is having invented 
a cigarette that burns twice as fast, "for the woman on the go") and 
hears of the upcoming ten year reunion, she and Michele decide they 
have to go to show up all their fellow alumni. Problem is, what is 
there to show off? I mean, besides the fact that they're both gorgeous, 
statuesque blondes. The movie considers their beauty a moot point, 
even having them both go on crash diets before their reunion, I guess 
to bring them down to 100 pounds from 102.</P>
<P>        In fact, the least believable thing about ROMY AND MICHELE'S 
HIGH SCHOOL REUNION is the idea of the title characters as 
losers. Yes, they're not too bright, but come on, they're so lovable. 
And those freaky clothes they wear would make them the most 
popular girls in a modern high school. That doesn't stop director 
David Mirkin from including several flashback scenes where we see 
just how lame Romy and Michele's high school days were. Everyone 
plays themselves in the flashbacks, which is about as convincing as 
the rest of the movie.</P>
<P>        ROMY AND MICHELE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION is 
based on a Robin Schiff play that Kudrow performed in years before 
her current turn on "Friends." The Michele character is a Phoebe 
clone Sorvino isn't too far removed from her MIGHTY APHRODITE 
days. But both are fun and exuberant, and Garofalo is as entertaining 
here as ever. There's even a great collection of '80s tunes from "Time 
After Time" to "She Blinded Me With Science." If there wasn't so 
much padded crap in here, the star rating would be higher, but as it 
is, I _almost_ liked it.</P>
