<P>Filmmakers love making ensemble pieces. Why? Maybe because it is a way in
which you do not need to develop your characters in order to prove a point.
You just need some witty dialogue and good direction to keep the viewer
intrigued, and all the characters must come together at the end in some
mysterious way. In the case of PLAYING BY HEART, this kind of film is done
well, but in 200 CIGARETTES the viewer leaves unintrigued. </P>
<P>200 CIGARETTES loosely tells the story of many New York couples during New
Year's Eve 1981. Somehow, these people are all supposed to attend a party
being held by Martha Plimpton, but they don't seem to show up. First, there
is Paul Rudd(CLUELESS), who has just been dumped by his girlfriend and is
spending New Year's Eve(ironically, his birthday) with his good friend,
played by Courtney Love, and contemplating whether to start a relationship
with her. There is also Jay Mohr, a typical player who is tired of women
with whom he's had one night stands telling him they love him. His latest
victim is Kate Hudson, who sports dog feces on her dress for half of the
film. Then there are Christina Ricci and Gaby Hoffmann, who are spending a
night on the town without their parents' knowledge, and they meet punks
Casey Affleck and Guillermo Diaz in an East Village club. And Ben Affleck,
Janeane Garofalo, Nicole Parker, and Angela Featherstone all show up in
small roles. The closest the film has to a protagonist is a cab driver(David
Chappelle) who seems to be driving each couple around. </P>
<P>The problem with 200 CIGARETTES is that it tries to be many things without
succeeding in any particular way. The film only works as an homage to the
80's in its superb soundtrack, showing that even a movie like the WEDDING
SINGER can be more insightful in its knowledge of a period in time. The film
also doesnt work as a comedy or a romance, because there is not enough of
either to take note of. Shana Larsen's script is quite mediocre, and makes
most of the conversations a bore, and the film itself only mildly amusing.
200 CIGARETTES also sadly has no message at all to speak of, and it makes
you wonder as to just when MTV Productions plans to put out a real movie.
Former casting director Risa Bramon Garcia turns her first film into a 2
hour long music video, without even getting much out of her cast. Even CAN'T
HARDLY WAIT, a far more superb film, deals with some kind of a message. If
200 CIGARETTES is any indication of what kinds of films we'll be seeing in
this upcoming year, then I guess I'd just as well stay home. </P>
