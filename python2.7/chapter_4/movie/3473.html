<PRE>                           WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING
                       A film review by Eric Grossman
                   Copyright 1995 LOS ANGELES INDEPENDENT</PRE>
<P>     Test screenings for the new romantic comedy, WHILE YOU WERE
SLEEPING, which  stars Sandra Bullock (SPEED), Bill Pullman
(SPACEBALLS) and Peter Gallagher (SEX, LIES AND VIDEOTAPE), received a
95 out of 100 approval rating.  At first, that number seemed high, but
since there are so few well-made, good-natured movies out there, the
score makes more sense.</P>
<P>     Bullock's career, which began before but really started with
DEMOLITION MAN, is going to get a big push from this film which should
launch her into the upper atmosphere of stardom.  She plays Lucy, a
lonely Chicago transit worker who gains a fian and a family when she
saves Peter Callaghan (Gallagher) from a speeding subway train.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately for Peter, he lands in a coma and a misunderstanding
leads his family to believe that Lucy and he are engaged.  Lucy's
quandary becomes worse when she falls in love with Jack (Pullman),
Peter's brother.</P>
<P>     Cute and nice, the two worst adjectives in the English language,
instantly come to mind when describing WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING.  Yes,
the plot is predictable but director Jon Turteltaub (COOL RUNNINGS) and
screenwriters Daniel G. Sullivan and Fredric Lebow create many "happy"
moments that pin smiles to our faces.  I looked around and saw people
grinning from ear to ear during the scene in which Jack escorts Lucy
across an icy walkway to her apartment, slipping and sliding, falling
into each others arms.</P>
<P>     Bullock doesn't show a great deal of acting chops, but her role
allows her to be adorable and endear herself to us.  WHILE YOU WERE
SLEEPING is what many in Hollywood have called, "the perfect vehicle
for her," which means it showcases Bullock in  a manner best suited to
her talents and makes her a big star.</P>
<P>     With his wackiness and facial expressions toned down, Bill Pullman
believably plays a normal guy and adds another solid performance to his
filmography.  Gallagher is fine, although he spends most of his part in
a coma.  Jack Warden, a great character actor, returns to the screen
and offers the film some needed weight.</P>
<P>     My score for WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING is more like an 85.  95 does
not give me much room to go higher and films can definitely reach
greater heights than this one.  Still, it is perfect for dates and
brings us some much needed cinematic water in what has been the
movie-drought of 1995.</P>
