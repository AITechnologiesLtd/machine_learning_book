<PRE>THE RING 2 (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>        3 out of ****</PRE>
<PRE>        Starring Nakatani Miki, Matsushima Nanako, Sanada Hiroyuki;
        Directed by Hideo Nakata;
        Written by Hiroshi Takahashi, from a novel by Koji Suzuki;
        Cinematography by Junichiro Hayashi</PRE>
<P>        The producers of the RING movies have evidently done their
economics homework.  They know that if a movie surpasses box office records
throughout South-East Asia, as THE RING did, then a sequel should reap
immense financial rewards.  And so they put out a sequel, which wasn't hard
to do, because the ending of the first movie is plenty ambiguous.  And if
the sequel is open-ended, then there is always the possibility of a third
movie, and more profits.  And so THE RING 2, sequel to the splendid
original, is open-ended, and THE RING 3 is already in pre-production, even
though the first two movies have only just premiered in North America, and
it would all seem like a blatant cash-grab, if the movies weren't so good.</P>
<P>        THE RING 2, remarkably, is almost as effective as its
predecessor--indeed, if you are not already familiar with the basic
material, it may be just as fine, although I would guess that proper
appreciation of THE RING 2 depends on knowledge of the original.  That film
introduced us to the memorable figure of Sadako, a white-garbed ghost with
a twisted posture and long black hair which obscures her face in an
indefinably sinister manner, and to the deranging video tape which heralds
her presence and signals to those who watch it that they have only a week
left to live.</P>
<P>        In THE RING, a journalist and her ex-husband went looking for
Sadako after seeing the tape.  The focus here is on the journalist's young
son, one of her co-workers, and the ex-husband's teaching assistant, as
they too come under Sadako's curse and seek to extricate themselves before
she claims them.  The sequel does its best to take the material in new
directions, following up on loose ends from the original to provide us with
new twists such as a mute possessed child, some pseudo-scientific
mumbo-jumbo about "energy transference," and a woman who can see into the
next world.</P>
<P>        Nevertheless, the strengths of THE RING 2 are, by and large, the
strengths of the original.  There is the seriously creepy presence of
Sadako.  There are images from the disquieting video tape, judiciously
recycled to great effect.  And there is Hideo Nakata's direction, which is
crisp, methodical, and inobtrusively superb, although there are moments in
THE RING 2 which verge on cliché and diminish its understated power.  The
least successful scene, to my mind, is a close-up of unconvincing blood
seeping from the body of a woman run over by a car, complete with the dead
woman's voice whispering spectrally on the soundtrack.  But such moments of
stock-in-trade triteness are rare: mostly, the movie is unaffected and
convincing.</P>
<P>        Its success depends on maintaining that tone of conviction.  Nakata
approaches his material with unblinking solemnity, depicting it as if he
believes in it.  He does not undercut the suspense with overplayed humour
or self-referential winks.  The sense of menace is never diminished.  Early
on, there is an unnerving set-piece in the neurological ward of a hospital:
a patient affected by Sadako's spirit causes other women in the ward to
have violent hysterical fits, while the TV in the corner crackles with
static and scenes from the video interrupt the broadcast.  The sense of
disruption this scene causes does not abate afterward.  Nakata proceeds
smoothly from one scene to the next, always with the same meticulous
mise-en-scene, and the unwavering consistency of tone allows earlier events
to inform and amplify those that follow.</P>
<P>        The end result is that the movie is chilling even when we can guess
what's coming--the horror depends not on surprise but on intensity.  Nakata
has, unfortunately, refused to direct the third installment, although it is
probably a wise decision.  He has given us two remarkable films, but now
it's time to turn out the lights.  The producers, so concerned with
economics of sequels, would do well to consider the law of diminishing
returns, which applies to art as it does to commerce.  The first time, it
was very scary.  The second time, it is kinda scary.  The third time, it
will be redundant.</P>
