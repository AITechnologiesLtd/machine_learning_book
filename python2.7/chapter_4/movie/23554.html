<P> Starring Julia Roberts, Albert Finney, Aaron Eckhart. Directed by
Steven Soderbergh. Rated R.</P>
<P>Even if the movie itself is a bit lackluster, Erin Brockovich will
stick in my mind as one of exceedingly few movies where Julia Roberts
doesn't play Julia Roberts. It hasn't happened since 1997's wonderful
Conspiracy Theory. Everywhere else, she's played the same role, the
unsure-of-what-she-wants romantic role model. She has a distinctive
romantic relationship here too, but at least she gets to spout some
entertainingly fiery monologues while she's at it. Too bad the movie
gets bogged down in a trite legal plot rather than explore her
interesting character further.</P>
<P>The title character is a twice-divorced, uneducated, unemployed woman,
taking care of three young children while trying to keep herself from
starving. She's desperately running all around L.A. looking for a job --
 something, anything -- but is turned down everywhere she goes because
of her lack of schooling and expertise. But finally, via a string of
good luck (and perseverance), Erin gets a position as a clerk in a
small law firm.</P>
<P>Her boss, an elderly lawyer named Ed Masry played by the inimitable
Albert Finney, is often taken aback by Erin's overtly aggressive
nature. She gets into fights with the staff, insults his ties and he's
ready to fire her. But then she goes off on a tangent, to investigate a
real estate case that, for some reason, has bloodwork and medical
records mixed in. She soon finds that an evil utility company
named "PG&E" is contaminating a town's drinking water with inordinate
amounts of hexavalent chromium, a poisonous, carcinogenic substance
that's not supposed to be in tap water under any circumstances.</P>
<P>Needless to say, all of the town's residents are seriously affected,
with medical bills starting to skyrocket. So Erin, the gentle soul that
she is, convinces her boss to take on this giant class-action suit,
which may be a serious risk for good old Ed, since it requires a lot of
time and money but does not guarantee a positive outcome. Meanwhile,
Erin herself developed a relationship with an unusually kindly,
unemployed biker dude (Aaron Eckhart) who takes care of her kids when
she's at work, but the arrangement is on thin ice because she is hardly
ever home anymore...</P>
<P>The first half if this movie jumps off the screen at you. Julia Roberts
is riveting as a street-smart, desperate woman struggling to survive in
a big city. Her story is interesting, compulsively watchable.
Immediately, she seems like a woman I'd love to spend the next two and
a half hours with. This blissful state continues for a half an hour or
so. But director Steven Soderbergh and writer Susannah Grant aren't at
all interested in keeping it that way. It's downhill from there.</P>
<P>The turning point, of course, is when the characters get mixed up in
the legal matter. This shifts Erin Bronkovich's focus -- how could it
not -- and it becomes a moderately entertaining but painfully ordinary
Grishamesque legal drama. The movie manages to pause and actually
examine what's happening to this person I got so attached to in the
first half hour precious few times. Hexavalent chromium has completely
taken over and the film isn't as interesting anymore.</P>
<P>Ironically, though the lawsuit plot takes up most of Erin Bronkovich's
running time, it seems almost like an afterthought, something put in to
entertain the lowest common denominator because the masses presumably
wouldn't be interested in just the person (what destroys this argument
is that the film is actually a true story, but for cinematic purposes
I'm going to cheerfully ignore that fact). It's a shame that a
personality so decidedly unique had to be diluted with a storyline so
trite.</P>
<P>What really pulls you through it, in the end, is the performances.
Julia Roberts remains tremendously entertaining, spouting harsh, loud
monologues right up until the credits. Few can outshout Roberts. Albert
Finney, a four-time Oscar nominee steals a lot of the scenes he is in.
He has the perfect combination of grumpiness and amiability that's
often difficult to concoct. It helps that he is given some downright
hilarious lines.</P>
<P>Those who watch Erin Brockovich might remember last year's terrific
John Travolta drama A Civil Action, which was also about a lawyer
helping a town with poisoned water. The difference betwene the two was
that in Civil Action, the legal matter was its driving force. It was
the centerpiece and the rest of the plot revolved around it. The
trouble with Erin Brockovich is that the character is the centerpiece
and the lawsuit takes our attention away from it.</P>
