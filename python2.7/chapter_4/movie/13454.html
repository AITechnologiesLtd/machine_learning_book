A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Richard Donner</PRE>
<P>Written by: 
Jonathan Lemkin, Alfred Gough, Miles Millar, and Channing Gibson</P>
<P>Starring: 
Jet Li, Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Rene Russo, Joe Pesci, Chris Rock </P>
<P>Ingredients: 
Goofball cops, oriental gangster, illegal immigrant trade</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
What a web of tangled comic situations. In LETHAL WEAPON 4 police
officer Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) tries to get his partner Roger
Murtaugh (Danny Glover) to believe in the psychic power of positive
thinking. He also convinces Murtaugh that the reason a zany young cop
named Butters is so nice to Murtaugh is because Butters is secretly gay.
To make matters worse for the two cop partners, their irritating friend
Leo (Joe Pesci) has recently changed jobs from accountant to private
detective, and Leo insists on following them around. When together, the
talkative Leo and the gung ho Butters can easily spend an entire day
grousing about trivia. Meanwhile Murtaugh is trying to figure out who
his daughter's secret boyfriend is, and trying to keep secret an
embarrassing new source of income. Murtaugh also must swim away from a
big shark while on a fishing trip. </P>
<P>On the other side of town sinister crime boss and money counterfeiter
Wah Sing Ku (5-time Chinese national wushu champ Jet Li) is running a
vicious slavery ring. The operation involves smuggling hopeful people
from China into America, in return for exorbitant sums of money that can
only be paid off by "indentured servitude" (slavery). </P>
<P>Murtaugh and Riggs go after Wah Sing Ku's gang, resulting in high speed
chases, explosions, laughs, and some superlative martial arts moves on
the part of the incomparable Jet Li.</P>
<P>Opinion:
Sure, the characters are written a little older and wiser, but they're
also funnier. Riggs and Murtaugh entertain us, escaping certain death by
explosion and shootout, wisecracking all the way. Murtaugh's family even
gets to escape twice. I may be mistaken, but miraculously, his wife and
daughter appear captured in the burning building even after they have
already been rescued and set free after a standoff with the bad guys.</P>
<P>For those unfamiliar with the LETHAL WEAPON series, it consists of 4
movies not really about anything lethal, but about the exploits of
police partners Riggs and Murtaugh. Roger Murtaugh is an aging,
easygoing family man who loves his fishing boat, while his loyal younger
partner Riggs is a somewhat un-hinged prankster with suicidal
tendencies. The running gag is that old Roger secretly enjoys the madcap
adventures brought on by his unpredictable friend. To recap: In LW1
(1987) Riggs and Murtaugh nail the cold-blooded killer Mr. Joshua. In
LW2 (1989) they protect an irritating mob-accountant-turned-witness
named Leo (Joe Pesci), while busting a South African crime ring. In LW3
policewoman Lorna Cole (Rene Russo) falls in love with Riggs and helps
the partners put away a bad ex-cop. </P>
<P>Characters Riggs, Murtaugh, Leo, and Lorna are all reunited in LETHAL
WEAPON 4, and a new comedian is added: Chris Rock as Officer Butters, a
gung ho young guy. LETHAL WEAPON 4 differs from the other movies in the
series in that the emphasis is more on comedy than on action, though it
still contains its quota of car chases, gunplay, explosions, and
hand-to-hand combat sequences. In my opinion, the fast-paced LETHAL
WEAPON 4 is one of the two best movies in the LETHAL WEAPON series.</P>
