<PRE>                              WONDER BOYS
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A "great novelist" and writing
          teacher who has hit an unproductive streak comes to
          terms with the aimlessness of his existence when he
          finds a young student with a genuine talent.
          Michael Douglas is cast counter to type and Tobey
          McGuire plays the student.  A bittersweet look at
          life in the academic community.  Enjoyable, but not
          nearly up to Curtis Hanson's L. A. CONFIDENTIAL.
          Rating: 6 (0 to 10), high +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Highly reminiscent of NOBODY'S FOOL, WONDER BOYS is another look
at a life unable to move forward--as if stuck in the snow of the cold
snowy town where the character lives.  Both the town and the character
seem to have seen better days.  But while Paul Newman's character never
achieved any greatness in NOBODY'S FOOL, Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas)
at least superficially appears to be living a constructive life that
only now is falling apart at the seams.  Tripp was at one time a great
novelist.  People were inspired by the novel he wrote years ago.  But
his next novel, now about 2600 typed single-spaced pages, gets further
and further from having its plots tied up.  Like the novel, Grady just
wanders.  And things are falling apart.  His wife has just left him and
returned to live with her parents.</P>
<P>     In the meantime he still is teaching Creative Writing at a
Pittsburgh university.  But Grady knows that he can teach no more than
the mechanics of writing.  He is a man who for a living gives useless
advice to others while leaving no advice to himself unignored.  He is
powerless to turn students into great writers, but at least he can
still recognize when one of his students is a great writer.  In this
case he recognizes that divine spark in James Leer (Tobey McGuire), an
innocent young writer who seems to have the spark of greatness.  Grady
will discover that James perhaps is not so innocent as he appears.</P>
<P>     WONDER BOYS is directed by Curtis Hanson from a screenplay by
Steve Kloves, based on the novel by Michael Chabon.  Hanson's last film
was the beautifully textured L. A. CONFIDENTIAL.  That film marvelously
captured the post-war feel of Los Angeles.  Perhaps WONDER BOYS does as
good a job of capturing the academic community in Pittsburgh, but even
if he does, who cares?  His academic world is populated with strange
characters and Grady himself is an anachronism of the 1960s.  He smokes
pot and leads a Bohemian life-style in a large ugly old house such as
one frequently finds on Eastern campuses.  Grady carries on an affair
with Sara (Francis McDormand) the university chancellor and wife of the
head of the English Department and Grady's boss (Richard Thomas, who
seems typecast after THE WALTONS to play literary types).</P>
<P>     This weekend is Wordfest, an annual event at the university when
one-time good writers and their fans get together to admire the sound
of their own words.  It seems at first as if we are to take it
seriously, but it takes one sharp giggle form Leer to make us realize
that we are really seeing a convocation of emperors without clothes.
The head of the English department has revenge against Leer, misreading
the title of Leer's novel to make it sound banal.</P>
<P>     Through most of the film the very randomness and unpredictability
of the plot gives it a realistic tone.  Unfortunately unlike Grady's
novel, clearly someone realized that the ends had to be tied up and a
fairly contrived incident toward the end of the film shakes Grady from
his status quo.  But until then Grady is really afraid to let his life
move on.  He is a coward.  While he has an obvious paternal side,
caring very warming for Leer, he is afraid of parenthood.  Having
proved himself once he exaggerates the effort necessary for the next
step in order to avoid taking it.  It is better to look like he is
attempting a huge feat than to actually proceed and risk failure.  In
this way he can have failure imposed on him by others.  The is a very
different character for Michael Douglas than those he has played
before.</P>
<P>     In spite of the disappointing contrived-seeming ending, WONDER
BOYS does ring true as a picture of the academic literary community.
I rate it a 6 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +1 on the -4 to +4
scale.</P>
