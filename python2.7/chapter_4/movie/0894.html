<PRE>                            COME SEE THE PARADISE
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1991 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     COME SEE THE PARADISE is a film about racism from a writer-director
who has been accused of making films with racist overtones (MIDNIGHT
EXPRESS, MISSISSIPPI BURNING).  It is also about the internment of
Japanese and Japanese-Americans during the Second World War.  And it is
a love story.</P>
<P>     The film was created by Alan Parker and stars Dennis Quaid and
Tamlyn Tomita as the lovers whose interracial marriage was opposed as
much by her father as by the "antimiscegenation" laws of California.
They elope to Seattle to get married, Seattle and Washington state being
known as an unusual place even in the 1930s in such matters.  They
become separated when the so-called internment camps are opened and all
persons of Japanese ancestry removed from the Pacific Coast states and
the U.S. enters the war.</P>
<P>     The pre-Pearl parts of the movie present a wonderful evocation of
Los Angeles' old Little Tokyo, with its mix of old and new country.  The
movie has a lush, detailed look to it.  In one of the Seattle papers
there was story about the reactions of several local ex-internees to
seeing the film.  One person was quoted to the effect that the movie
showed the camp surrounded by three barb-wire fences, just as his camp
was in real life, which detail delighted him for its authenticity.  The
camp is never identified, but I assumed it was meant to be Manzanar in
the Owens Valley of California.</P>
<P>     If it was Manzanar, the site of which I visited twenty years ago,
its appearance in the film points up my only real dissatisfaction with
the COME SEE THE PARADISE (aside from the title, which is an obscure
reference to the movie house where Quaid worked for Tomita's father,
played by Sab Shimono) was that to some extent it soft-pedaled the camps
and the situation.  Someday a really hard-hitting dramatic movie (as
opposed to a documentary such as one done on the camps in the late
Seventies) will be made; in the meantime, this film is better than
nothing, a first step, as it were, in realizing the dramatic potential
of this sad episode in U.S. history.</P>
<P>     Much is glossed over, such as dissent within the camps among the
internees about their own loyalties.  There is, in the interest of
balance, I suppose, a brief, conventional defense is offered by a minor,
white character.  However, there is no doubt that the film views the
camps as an injustice and a cruel punishment of innocent people.  From
my friends who experienced the camps directly and from my own reading, I
know that only the smallest modicum of the pain and confusion and greed
and meanness and little heroisms were depicted in this film.</P>
<P>     The performances by Quaid, Tomita, and the other actors are
uniformly excellent.  I've never liked Quaid better and I want to see
Tomita in lots more movies.  One of the pleasures of the movie is see
many unfamiliar faces, ethnic actors who are usually buried by the
mostly lily-white nature of main-stream film-making.  Indeed, one
especially delightful scene features one of Lily's brothers (Lily being
Tomita's character) who is trying to be a film actor but can only get 
parts as Chinese houseboys.  (Peter Lorre as Mr. Moto shows up in camp
show, too.)  </P>
<P>     The love story begins well, but does tend to get lost in the
hurly-burly of the war, which is probably what happened for a lot of
people, but which is not particularly good story-writing or film-making.
The two  principals play off each other well in their love scenes, but
their love scenes are more tender than passionate for some reason.</P>
<P>     Shall I say the film was not hard enough by half on America?  This
is not an angry film, but it is sympathetic and probably new information
for a lot of people.  America seems to have made progress since those
days, even if much distance remains to be covered.  The film is strong,
the performances are strong, the look is strong.  I am happy to
recommend COME SEE THE PARADISE.</P>
