<PRE>"Women. Can't live with 'em, can't kill 'em."
                        - Arnold to Schwarzenegger</PRE>
<P>     What is James Cameron up to now?  His new movie, TRUE LIES, is
*easily* the most entertaining film of the year.  Forget SPEED, THE
LION KING, and FORREST GUMP, here's a blockbuster that swats those
aside like houseflys.  Talk like a tag line and you'd say that TRUE
LIES is "more exciting than SPEED, more charming than KING, and more
humorous than GUMP."  Unquote.  With T2 talent Arnold Schwarzenegger in
the lead, James Cameron has delivered the best Bond movie that Albert
Broccoli never made.</P>
<PRE>     So why are some critics complaining?</PRE>
<P>     TRUE LIES opens in the Alps (!) with secret agent Harry Tasker
(Schwarzenegger) emerging from an icy lake at the edge of a heavily
guarded compound.  Bathed in blue light (of course), he strips off his
wetsuit only to reveal a perfectly pressed tuxedo.  With a dash of
cologne for good measure, Harry steps from the bushes and into the
chateau.  Just like that.</P>
<P>     Inside is a party and that's no trouble with Harry.  He mingles,
he flirts, and speaks six different languages.  He even dances the
tango before the inevitable Hasty Exit.  After a dizzying
foot/ski/snowmobile chase right out of ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE,
Harry hooks up with his buddies to get down to the real business of
tracking a gang of middle-Eastern terrorists who may be in possession
of some stolen nuclear warheads.</P>
<PRE>     Sound familiar?</PRE>
<P>     The Wall came down and peace came up and, now, we have bug-eyed
Easterners as the token spy-movie villains.  Stereotypes and all.  Tom
Clancy might complain, but not James Cameron.  His fun starts when
Agent Harry Tasker goes *home*.  No, not to some slinky siren from the
French Riviera, but, rather, to a quiet neighborhood outside D.C.</P>
<P>     At home is Helen (Curtis), a legal secretary with (what she think
is) a boring husband with a boring job.  Together, they have one kid
and one dog, but neither is enough to keep Harry home from "business
trips" and "working late."</P>
<PRE>     That is, until Simon (Paxton) shows up.</PRE>
<P>     He's an oily used-car salesman who, get this, is masquerading as
spy to seduce Mrs. Tasker!  Harry finds out and, once his neck veins
stop bulging, executes a wicked revenge that leads to such
complications as Helen's induction into "service" and the couple's
abduction by terrorists.</P>
<P>     With enough action and plot for *three* films, TRUE LIES begs the
question:  when is enough enough for James Cameron?  Not content to
make a spy movie, he's also created a *spoof* of a spy movie.  A spoof,
mind you, that's funnier than anything out now.  Watch Arnie butt heads
with a pair of pinschers in the opening scene, if you don't believe
me.</P>
<P>     But *after* the guns and gags have run their course, the film is
still only half-finished.  TRUE LIES is also about jealousy and the
*extreme* reactions of a husband who thinks his wife is having an
affair.  Cameron pulls no punches here; Harry's abusive treatment of
Helen includes one of the strongest scenes you'll see this summer.</P>
<P>     Timely stuff, which begs the question:  why the misogyny?  Has
James Cameron crossed to the other side of the field, after the
fight-back feminism of T2 and ALIENS?  Has the director's personal life
finally soured the "sensitive guy" who's best known for letting his
heroines act tougher than his heroes?</P>
<P>     Jamie Lee Curtis *does* get her due.  Of sorts.  Her empowerment
comes at the end, with a cute coda that has the couple living happily
every after.  But the transformation is slight and nothing at all along
the lines of either Linda Hamilton (T2) or Sigourney Weaver (ALIENS).</P>
<P>     The men fare worse.  Both Arnie and (Tom) Arnold are as far from
PC as can be.  Their collective locker-room wisdom is off-color, to say
the least, but they are no less appealing than, say, any racist
character in a Quintin Tarantino film.  They work in *spite* of their
questionable behavior.</P>
<P>     The chemistry between Arnie and Jamie alone is worth the price of
admission.  Sure, Arnie is a bit stiff for suave, but what range he
*does* have is put to great use, including some of the lengthiest leers
in film history.  Curtis is wonderful and, with her costar, makes TRUE
LIES seem light years away from either HERCULES IN NEW YORK or
HALLOWEEN.  Their best scene is Harry's rescue of Helen from a
speeding-to-its-doom limo.  Watch the looks.</P>
<P>     Tom Arnold is surprisingly solid as Harry's scene-stealing
partner.  He now has a career.  Bill Paxton, who once said some very
bad things to the Terminator, is an over-the-top, raunchy riot as
Simon.  Art Malik, good as the Hissable Villain, gets a great
double-take near the end.  And even Charleton Heston breezes through
with two tart scenes as an agency head.</P>
<P>     Only Tia Carrere sticks out like a sore thumb.  She has the looks,
but the not the chops, to hold her own with these pros.</P>
<P>     Cameron's script, adapted from the little known French farce LA
TOTALE, has more wit than the genre typically permits.  But, then
again, a James Cameron film typically *defines* the genre it's in and
not vice versa.  Watch how deftly the director mixes campy comedy and
sexy sincerity into Helen's strip tease (don't ask).  It's the best
scene in the film.</P>
<P>     Last, but by no means least, are the show-stoppers.  Try a horse
chasing a motorcycle onto the roof of a skyscraper. Or a public
restroom shootout that's a ballet with bullets. Or a great car chase
through the Florida Keys sans section of bridge.  Scene after scene
after stunt after stunt-- all as a fabulous $100 million dollar
reminder of why James Cameron is one of the top technically
accomplished filmmakers on the planet.</P>
<PRE>BOTTOM LINE:    TRUE LIES is the most entertaining film of the year.
                Period.  Go see it a third time.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: A</PRE>
