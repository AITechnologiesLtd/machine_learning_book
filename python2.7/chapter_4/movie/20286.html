<P>Starring Julia Roberts, Richard Gere, Christopher Meloni, Joan Cusack.
Rated PG.</P>
<P>If I had to name the most common problems with 90's romantic comedies,
at the top of the list would be their inherent implausibility. How and
why the characters fall in love is barely ever explained; instead we are
expected to trust the old Love at First Sight/I Know She Is the One for
Me explanation. Sometimes we aren't given any explanation at all: one
scene has the soon-to-be couple bickering, fighting and hating each
other and then -- boom -- in the next scene they are passionately
kissing.</P>
<P>The reason I warmed up to the new Julia Roberts vehicle, none-too-subtly
monikered The Runaway Bride, is that it avoids that most common and most
frustrating of problems. This is a film that does not ask us to take a
gargantuan leap into suspension of disbelief in order for us to accept
its premise. It works not only as a comedy but also as a love story; a
compelling romance between two people that have a believable future
together.</P>
<P>The Runaway Bride reunites the Pretty Woman dream-team of Julia Roberts
and Richard Gere. The latter plays Ike Graham, a much-maligned USA Today
newspaper columnist who allegedly writes nothing but "bitter diatribes"
about women. Sitting in his favorite bar one day he gets a tip-off of
sorts from a fellow sitting next to him: there is a girl in his
hometown, he says, who is legendary for ditching grooms at the altar.
Ike loves it and decides to write about it. His damning mistake was
exaggerating, turning a potentially interesting article into a -- who'd
have guessed it -- a bitter diatribe about women and a lie at that.</P>
<P>Maggie Carpenter, the subject of Ike's column/tirade, happens to pick up
the paper that day and peruse Mr. Graham's little masterpiece. Lies
about her in a national publication don't exactly make her day so she
writes a retort to Ike's editor, correcting the 15 -- count 'em -- 15
factual errors he made. The editor (coincidentally his ex-wife) fires
him. His friend makes the down-on-his-luck Graham this offer: if he goes
to Maggie's hometown and Maggie, currently engaged for the fourth time,
runs from the altar again, he gets a cover story in GQ magazine.</P>
<P>Our merry journalist does go to Maggie's hometown and meets Maggie as
well some of the colorful characters in her life. There's Peggy,
Maggie's sympathetic, supportive friend (played by my favorite actress,
Joan Cusack); her stereotypically spunky grandmother, and of course her
husband-to-be Coach Bob (Christopher Meloni). Bob is a nice enough guy
but Ike can't help but wonder whether he is right for Maggie and more
importantly whether he himself has feelings for the legendary Runaway
Bride.</P>
<P>The romance that inevitably blooms between Maggie and Ike is, for once,
palpable and tangible. They fall in love like real people would. There
is no suddenness; the romance develops gradually and believably. We can
see not only that they have fallen for each other but also that they can
live together for many happy years.</P>
<P>Julia Roberts looks luminously young as Ms. Carpenter and her
performance works just as well as her makeup. She's spontaneous, funny
and human and so is her character. She pulls her role off with
impeccable precision, making us believe that Maggie is a complex adult
with real issues as opposed to an indecisive airhead who has ruined many
a life with her irresponsible choices. Richard Gere is a bit too
sarcastic and impersonal in the first 2/3 of The Runaway Bride but
finishes off strong to make his performance a success. And what can I
say about Joan Cusack? One of the best working actresses, she is in top
form: her performance is fine-tuned and hilarious even though her role
is underwritten.</P>
<P>The Runaway Bride likewise benefits from top-notch comic timing.
Director Gary Marshall gives his film an even, rhythmic pace and
disperses enough delightful gags to make the movie a good comedy in
addition to being an exceptional love story. Some of the jokes are
cliched, true, but even some of those are funny enough to work.</P>
<P>Like most romantic comedies, this one doesn't say anything exceptionally
daring or resonant, but that doesn't prevent it from being a terrific
movie. The Runaway Bride is a standout because the romance at its core
seems like a real one. In addition to laughing at what we see, we
believe it too. That has become so rare in modern movies that The
Runaway Bride should be cherished.
