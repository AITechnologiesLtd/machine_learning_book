<PRE>JAWBREAKER (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: 0.0/10
Stars a bunch of people who should fire their agents
Directed by committee, apparently</PRE>
<P>There's a scene early on in "Jawbreaker" where a character utters the
unintentionally prophetic line, "That is *so* not funny".  How right
she was.  This pathetic tale of three high-schoolers who accidentally
kill their best friend in a birthday kidnapping prank gone horribly
awry is never even remotely funny.  Or fun.</P>
<P>Or original.  Not content with the too-obvious "Heathers" heisting,
the filmmakers proceed to lift freely from a staggering variety of
sources, including "Carrie", "Bride of Frankenstein", "Blue Velvet",
and even Shaw's Pygmalion, itself recently remade as "She's All That".
"Jawbreaker" is a pastiche, and not even an enjoyable one.  I find it
extremely telling that the most engaging part of the film is the
credit sequence, a jawbreaker factory montage inexplicably backed by
Veruca Salt's "Volcano Girls"; serving as a blueprint for the rest of
the film, the song has absolutely nothing to do with the footage we're
watching.  Just close your eyes and pretend you're listening to an
alt-rock station; you won't be missing anything.</P>
<P>The blame for a mess this big has to be spread around among the
principals.  Rebecca Gayheart, following roles in "Scream 2" and
"Urban Legend", should have known better than to take yet another role
in yet another teen body count movie.  Pam Grier has totally wasted
any credibility she might have gotten from her role in Quentin
Tarantino's "Jackie Brown".  And Rose McGowan should just quit acting.
She has no charisma, no presence, and no acting skills other than
rolling her eyes and looking disaffected.  McGowan manages to be
upstaged by her real-life boyfriend, rocker Marilyn Manson, whose
fifteen second role here is far more interesting than anything any of
the "real" actors are doing.  Manson, sans trademark makeup & contact
lenses, and with an obviously fake moustache, looks eerily like
Nicholas Cage; who woulda thunk it?</P>
<P>That crack about direction by committee wasn't merely a pithy
sound-bite.  Stylistically, thematically & narratively, "Jawbreaker"
is all over the map, varying wildly in tone & content from scene to
scene.  Though credited solely to writer/director Darren Stein, one
gets the feeling that no two scenes here were actually guided by the
same hands.  If Stein was indeed responsible for the whole of this
atrocity, someone needs to get the man some drugs, pronto.  Prozac,
lithium, kava, ritalin, something, anything.  He's quite obviously in
desperate need of chemical help.</P>
<P>"Jawbreaker" is a monumental waste of effort and resources, and quite
likely one of the single worst films I've ever seen.  To call
"Jawbreaker" garbage would be to insult garbage.  Bad flicks for the
rest of the year are safe; I've already got my pick for worst film of
'99.</P>
<P>"Jawbreaker" runs approximately 90 minutes, though it feels longer
than "Titanic", and is rated R for language, sexual situations and
graphic violence.  Not recommended for kids, teens, or anyone else.</P>
