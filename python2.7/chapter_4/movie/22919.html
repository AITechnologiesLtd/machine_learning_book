<P>   Reviewing "Eye of the Beholder" which opened one week
before "Gun Shy," some critics expressed their wit in the
following way: "When The Eye accidentally witnesses
Joanna in the process of committing a murder, he becomes
instantly smitten with her.  Who wouldn't be?"  A similar event
occurs in Eric Blakeney's "Gun Shy."  Nurse Judy Tipp
(Sandra Bullock) administers a barium enema to DEA agent
Charlie (Liam Neeson), and aggressively pursues him for a
date.  Who wouldn't?  "Gun Shy," a generally unfunny parody
of the wise-guys genre done with greater style in Kelly
Makin's "Mickey Blue Eyes," features Liam Neeson in an
allegedly comic role of an 18-year veteran of anti-drug police
work who dreams of retiring to a condo with an oceanfront
view.  Blakeney, noting the success of recent comic pictures
like Harold Ramis's "Analyze This," capitalizes on the current
fashion of showing heroes and mobsters who are
psychologically vulnerable--who are just plain scared and
who are playing the game with an eye to getting out of the
business.  But "Gun Shy" substitutes some bathroom humor
for the elan of "Mickey Blue Eyes." He also shoehorns a
romantic interlude that belongs in another movie and which
seems to exist only because Sandra Bullock, its producer,
sadly thinks she can make chemistry with Liam Neeson.  As
though the romantic breaks are not enough to divert our
attention from the principal, unamusing and forced storyline,
Blakeney--whose credits include occasional writing for
"Cagney and Lacey" and "Moonlighting" and who is
scheduled to direct the forthcoming "Without Apparent
Motive"--throws in some Ramis-style sessions on the couch,
none of which up to the humor of just about any of Bob
Newhart's late, great TV episodes.</P>
<P>   Borrowing a theme from Ben Younger's feature "Boiler
Room" (about a group of day traders in the stock market),
Blakeney's story deals with a couple of gay Colombian drug
lords and a family of wise guys who employ yuppie-ish
Howard (Paul Ben-Victor) in a scheme to manipulate prices
on the commodities market.  They buy up enough soybeans
to raise prices and to convert forty million dollars in cash to
billions in securities.  Mobsters Fidel (Jose Zuniga) and
Estuvio (Michael Delorenzo) team up with the reluctant Fulvio
(Oliver Platt) and are pursued in turn by the disinclined Drug
Enforcement Agency officer Charlie.</P>
<P>   "Gun Shy" relies on two comic themes. One is Charlie's
fear of criminals, justified enough since he had come within
seconds of being blown away by an Uzi and had witnessed
the execution of his partner just before a team of agents
storm into the blood-soaked room to clean up the gangsters. 
Charlie's psychosomatic stomach problems lead him into the
capable hands of Judy Tipp, who assures him that his
abdomen is reacting strictly to his anxieties and does what
she can to show him a good time before his anticipated
execution by the mob.  The other is the vaudevillian antics of
the cartoonish gangsters, principally Fulvio, who is said to be
able to read a person's soul through his eyes and who at one
point engages in an allegedly amusing staring contest with
Charlie--who has infiltrated the mob.</P>
<P>   The politically incorrect jokes are of the nature of Fidel's
going ballistic when he hears that Howard has bought
soybeans with the gang's money.  "What am I, a beaner?" he
shouts, dismissing any possibility that his Colombia family
ever went for the stereotyped food popular with Hispanics. 
The gross-out humor includes a joke that a gangster makes
about Fulvio's prostate in the obligatory men's room scene,
for which he gets his testicles shot off.  To add to the cliches,
Charlie participates in group therapy sessions with the uptight
analysands of psychiatrist Dr. Bleckner (Michael Mantell),
though Fulvio--who is henpecked by his bitchy, chain-smoking
wife Gloria (Mary McCormack), is obviously in greater need
of the doctor's couch.</P>
<P>   Neither romantic nor dark, neither humorous nor satiric,
"Gun Shy" tries to be "Bob Newhart,"  "Goodfellas," "Mickey
Blue Eyes" and "Forces of Nature" and succeeds at none of
the above.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 102 minutes.  (C) 2000
