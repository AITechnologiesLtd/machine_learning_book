<PRE>The Opposite Of Sex
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>***1/2 (Out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Life is weird. The longer I'm around the more I think that statement is a
given. Even if you lead what could pass as a "normal" existence, the little
oddnesses seep in and it's inevitable that occasionally the ground disappears
completely. If you live on the edge, at times it's like being in the Twilight Zone.</P>
<P>On the outside Bill (Martin Donovan) is your typical high school teacher in a
small peaceful Indiana town. When he catches a student writing graffiti about
him on a restroom wall, he corrects the grammar. His eccentricity is that he
is gay. Tom, his lover died a year before, leaving him with a batch of money
and a nice house.</P>
<P>Bill's personal Rod Serling episode begins when his 16 year-old half-sister
DeeDee (Christina Ricci) runs away from her Louisiana home and comes to visit.
Lil sis is not a nice girl. As she explains in her introductory voice-over, "I
don't have a heart of gold and I don't grow one later."</P>
<P>DeeDee's first order of business is to seduce Bill's current live-in Matt
(Ivan Sergei) convincing him that not to have sex with her would be an act of
discrimination. Matt's about as bright as the average box of rocks and falls
for the line. Afterwards he announces that he's bi-sexual. Tom's sister Lucia
(Lisa Kudrow) -- pronounced "Losha" -- insists that he's mistaken, "I went to
a Bar Mitzvah once. That doesn't make me Jewish."</P>
<P>DeeDee says in another voice-over "things get complicated very quick," and
she's right on target. In short order she announces that she's pregnant and
Matt's the father. They steal $10,000 and Tom's ashes from her brother and
take off for LA. Matt's jilted ex-lover Jason shows up and publicly falsely
accuses Bill of molesting him when he was a student. There's a trip to Canada
with Bill trying to find Matt and Lucia chasing him and Sheriff Carl Tippett
(Lyle Lovett) chasing her. There's a killing and police involvement. Every few
minutes something new and unexpected happens.</P>
<P>The story is truly complicated but miraculously easy to follow.
Writer/director Don Roos has crafted a fine film with a fascinating plot and
believable albeit offbeat scenes but the strength is the characters. He has
atoned for his screenplay of the atrocious remake of "Diabolique".</P>
<P>Many of the characters are unlikable in the traditional sense, but the
audience learns to appreciate them dispite, or perhaps because of, their
failings. Even DeeDee, the little girl old beyond her years who uses sex and
her ample endowments as weapons, grows on you.</P>
<P>All of the actors fill their roles well. Ricci is exceptional. With this,
"Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas" and "Icestorm" under her belt, she has left
her "Addams Family" and "Casper" roles far behind. Surprisingly another
standout is "Friend's" Kudrow. Her sexually-repressed bitter
old-woman-before-her-time is the opposite of her television role and she has
the best lines in the film.</P>
<P>The film is decidedly anti-politically correct. DeeDee's observations on the
gay lifestyle are none too kind. She refers to her brother's former partner as
"Bill The Dead Guy". When her white trash former boyfriend berates her for
hanging out with "homersexuals" and turning away from the path of God, she
asks "So when I was giving you a [slang term for sexual contact illegal in
some states] in the backseat, that was the stairway to heaven?"</P>
<P>Sheriff Carl (who has a thing for Lucia)'s observations on sex are especially
interesting. He says that sex isn't for procreation or recreation, but rather
for concentration. When two people are together, they pay attention to only
each other. At one point he asks Lucia "What's the point of sleeping with you
if it doesn't get your attention?"</P>
<P>The biggest risk in the film is the voice-over. If it had failed, it would
have pulled the entire movie down with it. DeeDee's lines are smartly written
and delivered as she talks to the audience about the film. When a gun is
shown, she tells us to pay attention to it, "Duh. It's foreshadowing."</P>
<P>DeeDee warns that "sex always ends in kids or disease or, like, you know,
relationships. Maybe some of those are not always bad things.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman has written this column for, like, you know, about 23 years
and he thinks that the opposite of sex might be, like, you know, boredom.)</P>
