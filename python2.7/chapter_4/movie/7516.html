<P>     Cameroon is not known for feature film output.  In fact, according 
to director Jean-Marie Teno, the African nation has been responsible for 
fewer than a dozen full-length productions.  CLANDESTINE, Teno's first 
venture outside the documentary realm, is the latest motion picture to 
emerge from Cameroon, and, while its perspective of life there is 
revealing, the screenplay is in need of polishing.</P>
<P>     Anatole Sobgui (Paulin Fodouop) is an out-of-work computer 
programmer who earns his living by operating as a clando (unauthorized 
cab) driver.  A former political prisoner who went to jail for 
participating in an anti-government group, Anatole is observed carefully 
by a police force all-too-willing to put him back behind bars.  Needing 
a break from his homeland, at least in the short term, Anatole takes a 
trip to Germany to locate the son of a local rich man.  Once there, he 
hooks up with a white female activist (Caroline Redl) and begins to 
contemplate how he can best help his country.</P>
<P>     The biggest problem with CLANDESTINE is that it feels like the 
narrative was grafted onto a documentary.  All of the true-to-life stuff 
about Cameroon is insightful and illuminating, especially for someone 
largely unfamiliar with the country's political situation.  
Unfortunately, the most basic characteristics of a fictional enterprise 
-- plot, characterization, and so on -- are left half-undeveloped.  The 
story is often confusing, occasionally bordering on incoherent, and 
CLANDESTINE's central figure remains frustratingly ill-developed.  Other 
characters, like Anatole's wife and German girlfriend, function as 
little more than ciphers and plot devices.</P>
<P>     The most compelling question posed by CLANDESTINE is whether 
violence is a viable option in the search for a solution to Cameroon's 
troubles.  "To shoot or not to shoot?" is how Anatole phrases it, and 
the implications of advocating either position haunt him.  Of course, 
there is no answer to this dilemma, and Teno is careful not to take 
sides, but the issue provides food for thought.</P>
<P>     I'm not sure why Teno chose to fashion this movie as a feature 
rather than a documentary, but, had he decided upon the latter format, 
the results might have been more satisfactory.  As it is, while 
CLANDESTINE offers a unique insider's view into an oppressed society 
stifled by poverty, the background material is more compelling than 
Anatole's story.  This makes the film an effective tool for instruction, 
but not a great motion picture in the conventional sense.</P>
