                       A film review by Eric Walker
                        Copyright 1993 Eric Walker</PRE>
<PRE>     What a refreshing movie this was!</PRE>
<P>     In these days of Hollywood "cop" movies, where the good guys are
macho dudes and the bad guys are slimy and totally evil, a movie like
MAD DOG AND GLORY shines because it cares about something far more than
brainless melodrama.</P>
<P>     This a comedy, but you won't be rolling in the aisles with
laughter.  It's leisurely and even slow-paced, and you won't be on the
edge of your seat (until the climax).  There's some very brief nudity
and one extended sex scene, but it's not very erotic and there's almost
no T-and-A.  It has lots of gangsters, but there are no chase scenes,
no big shoot-outs, and the only time we see people blown away is during
the first five minutes.  So if you go to this one expecting the likes
of MARKED FOR DEATH or LETHAL WEAPON, you're going to be sorely
disappointed.</P>
<P>     MAD DOG AND GLORY isn't interested in pandering to our love of sex
and violence.  The director, John McNaughton, is interested more in
character development than in chase scenes and shoot outs.  This is
what makes the movie such a delight:  We CARE about the characters.</P>
<P>     The film does everything possible to distance itself from the
standard Hollywood cop movie, even in its choice of leads.  Robert De
Niro and Bill Murray headline the film, and one would expect De Niro to
play the cool, suave gangster (in a replay of his role in THE
UNTOUCHABLES), but it's Murray who's the heavy here.  De Niro is a cop
named Wayne (his friends call him "Mad Dog"), and he carries a gun, but
he hasn't used it in fifteen years.  He's a photographer: he
photographs the corpses of crime victims for police records.  Unlike
your typical Hollywood cop, he's shy, nervous, and unsure of himself,
so that when he stumbles across a holdup in a grocery store, one night,
he's willing to let the robber have anything he wants.  He's far from
perfect, and he feels guilty about it: later on he even fantasizes
about blowing away the robber, the way he "should have" done (and the
way we see cops shoot down bad guys in one movie after another).</P>
<P>     Bill Murray, meanwhile, doesn't look like such a bad guy at
first.  He's a gangster, Frank, and he does nasty things, but he wants
to make people laugh; he even does stand-up comedy at one of his own
clubs.  (He's not a very good comedian, however; all of his best lines
are stolen from someone else.)  De Niro saves his life during that hold
up--but he's the "bad guy" and ol' Mad Dog is the "good guy." So what
does he do?  He picks him up, and they go out drinking.  Cops and
gangsters aren't supposed to fraternize like this, of course, but real
life isn't the black-and-white world of Hollywood cop movies.  Stuff
like this happens all the time, and there's a fine line that both sides
occasionally tread.</P>
<P>     Which is why Frank decides to reward Wayne: he sends a girl over
to "be his friend" for a week.  It seems that she owes Frank "a
favor"--everyone seems to owe things to Frank--and she's paying off
her debt in this fashion.</P>
<P>     But as the trailer for the movie shows, things get a little more
complicated than anyone expects.  Wayne falls in love with Glory, and
Frank doesn't like this.  So he gives Frank an ultimatum: give Glory
back--or else.</P>
<P>     It sounds like your typical Hollywood cop plot, doesn't it?  But
I'm not giving away anything here, because the plot is the least
important part of the entire film.  What makes it such a joy to watch
is De Niro's typically amazing performance, backed up by a wonderful
role from Uma Thurman, who plays Glory.  Bill Murray is also good; this
may be the best role I've ever seen him play.</P>
<P>     I love watching De Niro in his "quiet" moments.  He can entrance
an audience just by talking softly, so much so that the sound of his
breathing is as mesmerizing as his voice.  He becomes his characters,
and he makes them so three-dimensional and lifelike that by the time
the climax rolled around I was watching his actions (including an
important financial transaction) and thinking "Really?  I didn't think
Wayne wouldn't do that."  I was rooting for him during the final fight
scene, and he underplays his character superbly.</P>
<P>     Uma Thurman is equally impressive as the equally insecure and shy
Glory.  Here are two characters who are tailor-made for each other, but
they have to overcome their initial shyness and self-doubt before they
can trust each other.  They're a long way from the brainless "macho"
cop and the whorish "moll" who jumps into the sack with the hero just
because he blinks in her direction.</P>
<P>     There's a sex scene that deserves especial mention: it's funny at
first, as Wayne and Glory finally get to know each other better; but it
becomes sad and tender as they embrace each other.  They're not merely
banging away and getting the audience hot and bothered; they're really
holding onto each other for security, for comfort.  They CARE about
each other, and that's why we care about them.</P>
<P>     The laughs in this film don't come from out-and-out gags, except
for one hilarious fight scene between a cop and a thug.  Instead, it's
the characters, both good and bad, who hold our attention and keep us
interested.  This movie is a character piece, and its strengths lie in
the way it works better when we THINK about the characters.</P>
<P>     John McNaughton is making a career for himself as a Hollywood
outsider.  A couple of years ago, he was asked to make a horror film
that could be marketed to the splatter-film crowd--but what he
delivered was HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER.  The studio didn't
know what to do with it (especially since it was threatened with the X
rating), so they dumped it to the "art-house" market and released it on
video.  Now he's taken the "macho cop vs. gangster" cliche and turned
it on its side, giving us a film with no breathless action, little
blood-and-guts, and no car chases or smashing plate glass windows.  So
Universal released the film in the "quiet" period between Christmas and
Memorial Day, hoping to cash in on De Niro's reputation (and Bill
Murray's sudden popularity from the success of GROUNDHOG DAY).  The
film is fading fast from theaters, too--it's not going to be
remembered by anyone except the movie critics by the time the Christmas
movie season rolls around.</P>
<P>     But box-office isn't everything.  MAD DOG AND GLORY is a
delightfully original film, and if you enjoy original performances and
character development over chase-and-crash scenes, you'll be won over
by this film.  Check it out.</P>
<P>     When John McNaughton's next film hits the theaters, I'll certainly
be there to see it.</P>
