AMORES PERROS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>When a movie "opens" with an admonition that you can safely ignore the 
violence against animals since no animals were actually harmed during 
its production, you know that something is up.  AMORES PERROS (LOVE'S A 
BITCH), an extremely disturbing Mexican film that received one of this 
year's Academy Award nominations for best foreign film, is a perfect 
picture for those who think that the violence in movies today is not 
intense enough.</P>
<P>Using a format similar to Steven Soderbergh's TRAFFIC, the movie relies 
on fast pacing and jump cuts to tell three overlapping and intersecting 
stories.  Whereas TRAFFIC's central theme is drug trafficking, AMORES 
PERROS's common thread is graphic violence against dogs, featuring more 
cut-up, mutilated and gruesomely dead dogs that you've ever seen or will 
ever wish to see again.  The level of violence is so gratuitous and so 
disgusting that I picked up my coat several times and started to walk 
out, something I almost never do.</P>
<P>The only thing that kept me in my seat -- other than hoping, incorrectly 
as it turns out, that the gore would diminish -- was that this is a well 
made film.  Highly derivative of other works, the movie by director 
Alejandro González Iñárritu and writer Guillermo Arriaga started me 
thinking that perhaps their names were pseudonyms and that it was really 
a Steven Soderbergh and Quentin Tarantino collaboration.</P>
<P>Although the film contains cheating with a brother's wife, a horrible 
car accident and many acts of violence against humans, it is the dog 
fighting story at its core that you will never be able to get out of 
your head.  Perhaps the "sport" of training dogs to maul and kill each 
other will be of interest to some, but I found it repulsive.</P>
<P>If you have a pet, if you've ever had a pet or if you're even thinking 
about getting a pet, this isn't the movie for you.  Others may enjoy the 
director's technical proficiency and be able to ignore how derivative 
his work feels.  It's an energetic but sickening thrill ride of a movie.  
It's also a cinematic low point.  What's next?  Hacking up babies as a 
way to provide theatrical thrills to those who have been anesthetized by 
lower levels of violence?</P>
<P>AMORES PERROS runs a long 2:23.  It is not rated but would be NC-17 for 
graphic violence against humans and animals as well as for language, 
nudity and sex.  The film would be acceptable for college students and 
older.</P>
