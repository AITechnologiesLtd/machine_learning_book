<PRE>The Sixth Sense (1999)
Rating: 5.0 stars out of 5.0 stars</PRE>
<P>Cast: Bruce Willis, Toni Collette, Olivia Williams, Haley Joel Osment,
Donnie Wahlberg 
Written and Directed by: M. Night Shyamalan 
Running Time: 107 minutes </P>
<P>When I saw The Sixth Sense for the first time during its theatrical run,
I knew ahead of time that there was something amazing coming.  I knew
that there was this fantastic ending that I was told I'd love.  So even
though I was looking for something, when the end twist finally presented
itself it was one of those moments where my jaw actually dropped.  I'm
not saying that as a cliché... my mouth literally fell open in
amazement. </P>
<P>So now, by watching it again for a second time to review the DVD
release, comes the joy of getting to go back and pick up on all the
little details I missed the first time around (because I wasn't even
looking for them).  As a result, the first hour of the film (which I
originally felt was dull and stretched too thin because we were all
awaiting the inevitable "I see dead people" plot revelation anyway) is
now completely absorbing.  I originally gave the film four stars, but
upon a second viewing, I've bumped it up to five.  The Sixth Sense is
fascinating now, from start to finish.  It's one of the best told
stories I've seen in a long, long time. </P>
<P>The performances in this film are fantastic.  In particular, young Haley
Joel Osment is the best child actor I think I've seen on film since the
kids from the early scenes of It's A Wonderful Life (scenes that ANY
child actor should be forced to watch by the way).  Forget his Best
Supporting Oscar nod, he's the star of this film... he should have been
up for Best Actor. </P>
<P>The Sixth Sense:Collector's Edition is available on DVD from Hollywood
Pictures Home Video (a department of Di$ney).  It contains the film in
its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1 (enhanced for 16x9
televisions) and Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  Also included are
several documentary segments covering many aspects of the film's
evolution, deleted scenes, and the usual cast and crew information.  The
original theatrical trailer and two TV spots are also on the disc. </P>
<P>The making of segments are great, especially considering the fact that
Di$ney never EVER does extras.  Best of all is the "Rules and Clues"
segment where many of the major plot points of the film are presented at
once.  Also, the deleted scenes are all presented with introductions by
writer/director M. Night Shyamalan.  Other discs usually throw deleted
scenes out there and we have no idea where they were supposed to fall in
the grand scheme of the film.  One deleted scene, an extension of the
film's finale, packs quite an emotional wallop and I actually prefer it
to the film's actual ending. </P>
<P>But just when it seems as though Di$ney does the right thing with their
DVD content, they manage to screw things up even worse.  Apparently
their new policy is to attach a plethora of upcoming Disney trailers at
the beginning of each DVD that you CANNOT SKIP PAST to go directly to
the main menu.  You instead have to watch them or you can fast forward
through them (which means yes, you're still watching them).  Making it
even more absurd is the fact that you are given an option on the menu
screen to watch these trailers AGAIN.  I'm all for extra trailers on a
disc, but I'd like it to be up to me if I decide to watch them or not. 
Hey Di$ney, when will the amount of money you guys have be enough?  When
will it be enough so that you can start acting like the other major
studios? </P>
<P>Aside from that minor nuisance, The Sixth Sense on DVD is a great
addition to your library.  You get one of the very best movies of the
1990's along with some good extras.  I'll give Di$ney the credit it
deserves here... they're on the right path.  I hope they don't blow it.
