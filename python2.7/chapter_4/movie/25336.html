Susan Granger's review of "BLOOD SIMPLE: Director's Cut" (USA Films)</PRE>
<P> First shown at film festivals in 1984, "Blood Simple" was the
first feature film by brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, who went on to
make not only "Fargo" but also "The Hudsucker Proxy," "Barton Fink,"
"Miller's Crossing," and two of my favorites, "Raising Arizona" and
"The Big Lebowski." This is the newly restored and re-edited
Director's Cut of their stylish crime thriller, introduced by
enigmatic Mortimer Young, a pseudo-film restoration expert who inanely
informs us that this version takes advantage of technological
breakthroughs made possible in recent years. It seems writer Dashiell
Hammett originated the slang phrase, "blood-simple," meaning the state
of fear and confusion that follows the confusion of murder, as in
"He's gone blood simple."  So the grim, sleazy story begins in Texas,
where a jealous saloon owner (Dan Hedaya) hires a cheap divorce
detective (M. Emmet Walsh) to kill his wife (Frances McDormand) and
her lover, a bartender (John Getz). But the detective gets a better
idea....and I'm not going to tell you what happens and ruin the greed,
lust, double-cross and betrayal plot if you never saw the original. So
how does this so-called Director's Cut differ? Not much. The running
time is still almost the same, so whatever revisions were made are
subtle. In fact, in the "New Yorker" magazine, Ethan Coen irreverently
quips, "A pace that was once glacial is now merely slow. Scenes that
were once inept are now merely awkward." Nevertheless, on the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Blood Simple: Director's Cut" still scores an
8, remaining an amazing, ironic debut thriller. I suspect its
re-release is a marketing device to whet our interest in their new
film, "O Brother Where Art Thou?" starring George Clooney, which will
be released this fall.</P>
