<P>Yes, another film in the Pulp Fiction genre.  </P>
<P>Is _Go_ good?  Depends.  If you loved _Pulp Fiction, then perhaps you'd like
_Go_.  Or come out disappointed.  Or wonder how many plot twists from the
latter were lifted from the former.</P>
<P>_Go_ details the events that occurred before and after a disastrous drug
deal.  The word "go" is, to my knowledge, uttered three times, at three
significant points, meaning three different things.  These three stories are
told, within the same twenty-four hour time frame.  </P>
<P>Because the stories are incredibly loony, with coincidences abounding, the
film falls into the terrible trap of coming up with as many vices that could
be conjured up within the small time frame.  More than once, you hear one
character say "Don't do this..." only to have it done later.  For these
moments, the film is predictable.</P>
<P>But to its credit, many of the plot twists are totally unprecedented.  Kudos
goes to William Fichtner, (great in _Contact_, terrible in _Armageddon_).
His role is so well executed that when the punch line comes, it's from a
totally unexpected track, that is both maddening and hysterical.</P>
<P>The same goes for the rest of the cast:  not a stinker in the bunch.  Katie
Holmes and Sarah Polley show true star potential, far different from their
previous work.  Jason Flemyng has come a long way from _Scream 2_, as the
heinous drug-dealer, who is as concerned with getting his fare share as how
bad "Family Circus" is.</P>
<P>But because of its setup, you can't help but recognize how totally
artificial the exercise is.  Hear me out.  Sarah Polley's character is being
kicked out of her apartment.  Christmas Day.  And she works three shifts in
a row to help make ends meet.  Excuse me?  And that's before the story kicks
in.  Suffice it to say, you can only wonder what got into the heads of Doug
Limon (director) and John August (screenwriter) who have her go through much
more, only to return to work the next day.</P>
<P>And what to make of the total role-reversal that Holmes' character goes
through?  She is kept at Flemyng's grungy apartment as bait, until Polley
gets back.  She is terrified of him.  Later, she makes a series of decisions
that contradict everything we had seen before.  </P>
<P>_Go_ doesn't exist to fully make sense.  It exists as a throwaway vehicle
for its stars, all of which have a good future before them.  It (thankfully)
doesn't take itself seriously (the scene where the Macarena is playing is a
prime example).  So it's fun, and it's incredibly busy, even though the film
in general doesn't follow the rules of ordinary logic.</P>
