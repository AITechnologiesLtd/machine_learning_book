<P>   Listen to Julia (Kate Winslet), the gorgeous 25-year-old
character in Gillies MacKinnon's movie "Hideous Kinky," and
you'll wonder how London ever got to be one of the world's
most populated cities.  Cold, damp, and dreary, the British
capital--in her mind--would hardly justify that ad slogan, "If
you're tired of London, you're tired of living."  But then, not
everyone lives in a frosty, one-room flat in the south end of
the town like Julia and you've got to suspend a great deal of
belief to accept the particular that one so attractive, so
adventurous, so absolutely engaging should have to put up
with living in a warren.  We don't get to see any part of
London in this picture: not Big Ben, not Kiwi Court, not Julia's
pad, but photographer John de Borman needn't worry: his
canvas is filled with the sights and sounds of Morocco from
its exotic principal city of Marrakesh to the barren desert
sands to the south.  The film takes place in 1972, in the
midst of the hippie era which saw hundreds of thousands,
perhaps millions of Americans and western Europeans toking
on weed, tripping on acid and generally dropping out even as
the Vietnam War was drawing to a close.  Though hashish
and the stronger drugs were illegal in the picturesque North
African country just as they were in the States and in
England, somehow nobody hassled the flowers of western
civilization that camped out from the northern tip of Tangier
just across the Straits of Gibraltar to the lightly populated
southern end of Tarfaya.</P>
<P>   "Hideous Kinky" does a wonderful bit of product placement
for the Moroccan Tourist Bureau in a country that many other
producers have found amenable for capturing biblical
ambiance, but this is the one of the few British-made films
actually meant to take place in that locale.  Esther Freud,
whose late 1960's novel with the same name is based on 
memories of her own journey which she took in the company
of her mother and sister, relates her tale strictly from a child's
point of view.  The book possesses ruminations which do not
translate to the screen, particularly since "Hideous Kinky"
lacks the sort of narrative that we either loved or hated about
"The Thin Red Line."  The unfortunate result is that while the
movie works just fine as a travelogue, one which may well
encourage Americans to travel to a country no farther in
distance than Paris, as a story it miscarries.  Books, like
plays, are often by nature uncinematic, and translate best
when they are freighted with action, not philosophy.</P>
<P>   The story centers on Julia who is fed up with her near-slum
existence in London as well as with her poet-husband's
philandering, and believes she can learn to discover inner
knowledge by meeting a famous Sufi in Algeria.  But first to
Morocco to give her girls, the eight-year-old Bea (Bella Riza)
and the six-year-old Lucy (Carrie Mullan) a global
perspective.  Despite her limited funds, she has gone to
Marrakesh on three one-way tickets hoping that her
husband's checks would see them through.  When the money
does not arrive, she becomes increasingly desperate, even to
the point of selling dolls on the street and thereby acquiring
the hostility of the native women.  She has, however, found a
fulfilling relationship with a scamp, Bilal (Said Taghmaoui),
who genuinely cares for her but who is a shady character
making a living partly from unnamed criminal activity, doing
heavy work, performing acrobatics for tourist dollars in
Marrakesh's main square, and telling fortunes to cynical
young women on holiday.  While little Lucy bonds to the
young Moroccan man whom she accepts as a father-
substitute, the more detached and, yes, somewhat obnoxious
sister Bea wants out.  </P>
<P>   Winslet's acting is a wonder to behold, but despite her half-
hearted attempts at going native, she makes suspending
belief a difficult task.  She does not fit in as a hippie,
eschewing both drugs and drink.  For a woman who hasn't a
dirham to her name she looks awfully well appointed with a
healthy face and a robust figure--which she shows off just a
tantalizing bit while fooling around with Bilal in the unflustered
presence of her daughters.  Nor is Bilal quite credible, a man
not likely to have had much formal education who
nonetheless speaks a fluent English and who is aware--while
doing backbreaking labor that would put him in good stead
with the prisoners in Angola, Louisiana--that "Morocco is not
England."  As Julia--naive and irresponsible enough to have
given birth to her first daughter at the end of seventeen--
learns some homespun truths the hard way, we in the
audience may not help feeling that "Hideous Kinky" is a
disjointed voyage that leaves us intellectually more informed
but emotionally as arid as the Sahara desert which forms its
backdrop.  </P>
