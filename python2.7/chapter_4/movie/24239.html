<PRE>Me Myself I
Directed by:  Pip Karmel
Starring: Rachel Griffiths, David Roberts, Sandy Winton,
Yael Stone, Shaun Loseby, Trent Sullivan
Running time:  104 minutes
My rating (5 star scale):  ****1/2</PRE>
<P>Pamela Drury (Griffiths) is a successful career woman.  She is an award
winning journalist.  But years earlier, she turned down a 
marriage proposal from her high school sweetheart, 
Robert Dickson.  But a magical moment changes all that.  
Pamela suddenly finds herself in an alternate universe 
where she said yes.  </P>
<P>But there is a big difference between the dream of a marriage
and the reality.  Pamela finds herself saddled with 3 children:
a boy who calls her dumbhead, a girl who asks questions like
'if you haven't had your period yet do you need to use 
condoms', and a small boy who can't go to the bathroom by
himself.  She has a husband who is often away on business
and is up much of the night reading for work.  </P>
<P>She overcomes these initial difficulties.  But she learns
that the perfect marriage and the perfect life really weren't
that perfect.  And things really come to a head when she
discovers what has happened to her career.</P>
<P>This is a film about the danger of getting what you wish for.
It's a serious theme but a lighthearted movie.  The depictions
of the reality of married life are dead on.  The humour
arises naturally from the subject matter and Griffiths does
a great job in both her roles.  Plus, it has some good
performances from the children who act like normal kids,
not the disgustingly sweet children we usually see in film.</P>
<P>This film fell short of 5 stars because I didn't find myself
making an emotional connection to any of the characters.
Possibly married people might find it easier to make that
connection.  But regardless of your spousal status, you
definitely should see this film.  Well worth theatre prices.</P>
