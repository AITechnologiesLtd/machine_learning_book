<PRE>GATTACA (1997)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>

Starring: Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, Jude Law, Loren Dean, Alan Arkin, Gore
Vidal, Ernest Borgnine, Tony Shalhoub, Xander Berkeley, Blair Underwood,
Ryan Dorin, Elias Kosteas, Jayne Brook</P>
<P>If you had a chance to create a genetically perfect child, would you do it?
 "Gattaca" is a film which presents a future where society has answered
"yes" to this question, but then ponders if this was actually the right
decision.  "Gattaca" came out only a couple months following the first
genetically engineered creature, the lovable Dolly the Sheep, and with this
in mind, the film only becomes more frightening.  The way the realm of
genetics is heading, it may only take a couple decades until the future
"Gattaca" presents becomes true.</P>
<P>Contrary to the misleading trailers, "Gattaca" is not a sci-fi thriller, in
the way that there's lots of murder, Hitchcockian suspense, and chase
scenes.  This is a quiet, sad film about intelligent theories.  In fact,
the film seems like it would have been written by George Orwell or Aldous
Huxley (the latter who's novel "Brave New World" featured genetically
engineered children).  It's a film that may likely become a cult hit to
people who are frightened by a promise of shallow Utopia, which is exactly
what "Gattaca" presents...and the main reason I dug it so much.</P>
<P>The story revolves around the genetically insufficient Vincent Freeman
(Ethan Hawke), a man with high hopes but a 90% chance of heart problems,
and a prospected life span of around 30 years.  As a child, he was put down
because of the threats of genetics, while his younger genetically perfect
brother, Anton (Loren Dean), was promised whatever his heart desired. 
Vincent yearns to be an astronaut, but when he gets a job at a giant space
company, it's as a janitor (Ernest Borgnine plays his boss!).</P>
<P>But one day, he finds out that it's probably possible that his desires can
come true in the form of a business deal brought out by a black market
geneticist (or something), German ("Wings"' Tony Shalhoub, who did like
hundreds of cameos in films back in '97: "Men in Black," "A Life Less
Ordinary"...), who's client is a genetically perfect man, Jerome Morrow
(Jude Law), who has unfortunately been crippled.  Fortunately, though,
there's no record of the accident, and he's willing to give someone else
his life. Since Vincent looks a bit like him...</P>
<P>After a couple alterations (some minor, some really major), he has donned
the life of Jerome, and is doing his job.  There, he meets a genetically
imperfect woman, Irene (Uma Thurman, who's genetically perfect in real life
anyway, hee hee), and the two begin a kind of relationship, albeit a very
shallow one since romance is deemed by how great a man's stats are.</P>
<P>However, a murder of a high-level worker at his office is killed, and one
of Vincent/Jerome's eyelashes is found by the anal retentive investigators
headed by a semi-wily inspector, Hugo, (Alan Arkin), and none other than
Vincent's long lost brother, Anton, who hasn't seen him since they were
teenagers.  We know Vincent/Jerome didn't do it, but with his older picture
being posted everywhere, not only Vincent/Jerome's in trouble, but also the
real Jerome, who's as much in it as he is.</P>
<P>However, there isn't many big suspense set pieces, which is actually a
blessing because if they were tossed in, the film would lose it's message
and descend into just being a sci-fi thriller a la William Gibson.  The
suspense in the film comes from the idea that Vincent and Jerome can easily
be captured just by dropping a hair or dead skin.  While there are several
scenes which are pretty frightening, there are no big distractions from the
point of the film, much to the dismay of commercial audiences.</P>
<P>What is actually portrayed is the lack of life in the Utopian society that
is created.  Irene has no real spunk in her life, and is rather amazed by
the sheer beauty of a sunrise rather than genetically perfect people.  And
the genetically flawless Jerome is in actuality a bitter man, claiming that
his accident was really no accident.  What Jerome has done is fool the
system in giving a man who yearns for better things a chance at that, and
the ending is shocking as it's a definite work of dystopian propaganda, but
doesn't have the down ending of other works of this kind.</P>
<P>The production design of this film is probably the best I've seen this
year: it's stunning, very pleasing to the eye, but still very cold.  Since
genetics has ruled out any chance of improvement, the world has cooled into
a state of inhumanity, and the sets echo a sense of shallow misery.  And
the sequence of all the high-level workers doing their jobs has a kind of
Gilliam-esque feel to it, showing the nightmare of slipping into a routine
zombie-like life.  The ability to perfect people has left humanity cold and
generally unhappy.</P>
<P>The acting from everyone is great, with Thurman giving a wonderfully cold
performance, and Hawke creating a character who has been beaten down by the
system but has found a new sense of optimism by a bitter man who was
willing to give it out anyway (interesting pointless fact: Uma and Ethan
started dating after this film, and currently she is pregnant with his
child).  But the best performance belongs to Jude Law, who steals every
scene he's in, and creates a character filled with the pessimism over
having such a horrible burden placed on his burden.</P>
<P>I think that people are generally tempted by the fact that genetics can
actually create perfection in a child, but whether or not they would
actually act on this temptation is something I'm not sure of.  "Gattaca"
warns us not to go any farther, chiefly because we'll create a world of
elitism where the elite are shallow and unhappy, and as bitter and angry as
the lesser people are.  And when I see a possible future featuring a
12-fingered piano player, well folks, that just creeps me out.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***1/2</PRE>
