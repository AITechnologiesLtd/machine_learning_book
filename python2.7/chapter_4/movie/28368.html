<P>PLOT:
A British poet moves to France and finds himself in a position to write 
a play for the Moulin Rouge. Soon thereafter, he falls in love with one 
of its stars, Satine. But the play and the Moulin Rouge will not go on 
unless a certain Duke invests his money into it. The catch? The Duke is 
also in love with Satine and doesn't know about the secret love affair 
between the poet and Satine. Oh yeah...and people sing throughout!</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A surprisingly potent love story is placed inside a red-hot bottle of 
music, dance, colors and vibrancy, and splashed across your movie screen 
with love as its foundation. Will everyone like it? Certainly not, the 
film has a certain over-stylized energy about it which may not sit well 
with everyone (I personally enjoyed most of the film's unique camera 
trickery, but did get lost in its frenzy from time to time), but anyone 
who loves musicals is sure to at least appreciate Mr. Luhrmann's bold 
approach to reviving this lost genre of films. I never did like musicals 
myself but ever since I was pleasantly surprised by last year's LOVE'S 
LABOUR'S LOST, I've opened my eyes to them, and with this film, you 
simply could not close them back again (there's so much happening on 
screen all the time!). I've also gotta credit all of the actors with 
amazing performances across the board. Nicole Kidman, wow, I was never 
much of a fan of hers, but she really gives you everything in this film. 
Dancing, acting, loving, crying, singing, fainting...she covered every 
angle out there and actually got me to invest myself emotionally to her 
character. And yes, I will even go out on a limb and ask the Academy to 
remember her at the end of this year if no other major actress roles 
have come through for a nomination as Best Actress. But let's not forget 
McGregor either. His ying to her yang, Ewan also surprised me with a 
different side of himself, one which resonated a genuine sense of 
passion, love, anguish and song! Damn, that boy could sing! And even 
more kudos go out to Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburgh, who played the 
Duke and Mr. Zidler, for presenting us with more than just your everyday 
one-dimensional secondary characters. They are also a big part of what 
makes this movie work.</P>
<P>Of course, the film's main draw was its use of modern songs and lyrics 
inside a world of the past, and that experiment on its own definitely 
won me over. Anyone who could successfully incorporate Elton John, Kiss, 
Madonna and Nirvana into the same movie song list is "okay" in my book! 
In fact, many of the song sequences were beautifully sung and 
choreographed, touched up with stunning sets and atmosphere, and left 
quite an impression in my mind. One of my favorites was when the whole 
"gang" from the Moulin Rouge was trying to convince the Duke to invest 
with them by dancing and singing a rapid-fire ditty inside the big 
elephant. A sure-to-be classic scene (I know that it might sound goofy, 
but when you see the movie, you'll see what I mean). But in the end, 
movies like this are ultimately going to be judged by their basic 
storylines and I have to tell you that I too was quite shocked to find 
myself attached and rooting for the characters in this film. Thumbs up 
to Baz Luhrmann on two counts then: one for creating an extraordinary 
vision of an underground world so delightful and peppy and two, for 
co-writing a touching, funny, original and romantically tragic 
screenplay. This movie works because it enraptures its energy, love, 
style and wonderful set designs with solid acting, captivating song 
sequences and a love story that is sure to touch your heart. Yeah, JoBlo 
ain't a wuss but he sure lapped up everything that the director was 
handing out at this fantasy land. What's next...Broadway?</P>
