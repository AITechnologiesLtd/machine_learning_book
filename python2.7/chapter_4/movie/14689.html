<P>   `You think you know all about vampires...believe me...you know f*ck
all.'
   With these words, we are brought into the world of a sultry vampire
seductress by the name of Lilith Silver (played by Eileen Daly). Made
into an immortal a century and a half ago by the sinister Ethan Blake,
she continues to alleviate boredom with her state of being. So, what's
an undead girl to do, except squeeze into the tightest fitting clothes
possible, get out her guns, seduce a few guys, and kill a few people for
money and blood?
   With that out of the way, let me say this. This film is bad. This
film is really, really bad. Yet somehow, it is strangely enjoyable. With
all the elements of a direct to video horror flick – buxom babes, gore,
cheesy dialogue, and bad acting – any casual film viewer would be more
inclined to spend their money on renting Innocent Blood or going to see
Blade. Still, it is considered to be one of the finest British vampire
film. Agreed, it might be, but is far from being the best vampire flick
ever. Period.
   Razor Blade Smile has some rather high production values, shown by
the nice overall tone to the film. The film is also a bit of a departure
from popular vampire lore, with a vampire that can go out in broad
daylight without disintegrating, doesn't sleep in a coffin (but leaves
one next to her computer), and sees religion as the `opium of the
peoples' (hence, immunity to crosses). But aside from that, it doesn't
stray too far away from horror film conventions.
   That is, unless that is intentional. Razor Blade Smile literally goes
for the throat, then pumps the wound full of processed cheese. You can't
help but laugh when a female vampire gets decapitated and her severed
head goes flying into a puddle. You'll laugh even harder at the
hideously contrived situations (to distract two female guards, Lilith
tosses a cellular phone towards them and dials the number). You'll laugh
the hardest when a murder witness recants the tale and suddenly starts
sobbing uncontrollably. And then, there's the sudden twist ending (I
have enough heart not to give it away).
   The film refuses to take itself seriously, which is a good thing, as
by the time Lilith zips up her skin-tight body suit and then unzips it
just to show the right amount of cleavage, you've most likely forgotten
the main point of the story. But in case you really care, she's been
assigned to kill a bunch of people who belong to the so-called
Illuminati, and she's leaving a huge mess behind for the police to find.</P>
<P>   As much as my criticisms, this movie works best as a guilty pleasure
or as a film that you watch with your friends and within groups. Almost
destined for cult-status, the film's campy, cheesy overtones actually
work towards the film. While this may not necessarily be the film you'd
want to be seen watching by yourself, it makes for a fun time at the
movies.</P>
<P>Rating: 7/10
