<PRE>                                   FEAR
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1997 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1996) *1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        This is every fatal attraction thriller you've ever seen, only 
a few years earlier. Created with non-discriminating teens in mind, 
FEAR is an inane, laughably bad movie with little originality, even 
in casting. 1993's THE CRUSH starred a then-unknown Alicia 
Silverstone, this one stars the beautiful and precocious Reese 
Witherspoon, who is a cross between Silverstone and Candace 
Cameron from "Full House." This time, the psycho villain role goes 
not to the leading lady but to "Marky" Mark Wahlberg. And you 
wondered if there was any redeeming value in FEAR...</P>
<P>        Reese's life is typical -- superficial shopping and school 
work. She spends a lot of her time arguing with her father. When 
she shouts in the opening scene that she has "to ask permission to 
breathe" and storms out of the room, Dad replies sarcastically, 
"Does this count as quality time?" No, and it definitely doesn't 
count as quality writing. This exchange establishes early on two 
vital components of the movie -- horrendous dialogue and bad 
acting.</P>
<P>        Who better to contribute to the bad acting than B-movie 
queen Alyssa Milano? She plays Reese's best friend, already skilled 
in the ways of sex with no-good older men. Alyssa's philosophy on 
relationships is, "It's power." Reese replies, "It's nuts," to Alyssa's 
response, "It doesn't feel good to be wanted?" None of us have any 
idea what she's talking about; after all, she hasn't been wanted since 
"Who's the Boss?" went off the air.</P>
<P>        Reese soon meets Marky Mark at the local teen nightclub, 
his opening line to her being, "Hey... you're not dancing." She could 
have sent him packing with the response, "You're not charting," but 
she instead revels in his advances because it's power, and it feels 
good to be wanted. She talks and kisses him until two in the 
morning, by which time her step-mom is yelling at her and she's 
shooting back sarcastic responses. Dad's out of town on a business 
trip, but Marky Mark's ready to charm him and the rest of the family 
(including the dog) when he gets back. It's such a good vibration, it's 
such a sweet sensation...</P>
<P>        Alyssa is also ready to charm Dad when he gets back, with 
some of the most ridiculous double entendres in movie history. She 
asks him to come to a carnival with her, saying, "You could ride the 
bumper cars... You could do that thing where you throw the ball at 
something and maybe win me a stuffed animal." Luckily, that 
subplot never goes anywhere, but what is immediately established 
is Dad's mistrust of Marky Mark. He can't put his finger on what he 
doesn't like about Mark (he's just so... marky) until he finds a used 
condom wrapper in his daughter's bedroom.</P>
<P>        Yes, Mark is hot for Reese's peanut butter cups, and takes 
her virginity during another of Dad's business trips. (That guy's got 
to find a new job!) The PG sex scenes in this R-rated movie are teen 
love at its finest, as a remake of the Rolling Stones' "Wild Horses" 
plays and this sexy dialogue exchange takes place.</P>
<PRE>        MARK: Do you want me?
        REESE: Yeah.
        MARK: Tell me you want me.
        REESE: I want you.
        MARK: Yeah.</PRE>
<P>        The honeymoon is soon over, though, as Marky Mark 
shows his violent streak and threatens various members of the 
family. FEAR seems at least twice as long as it is, the various plot 
twists and developments apparent to most audience members a 
mile away until. There's not much good about FEAR, especially 
since every other made-for-video movie nowadays features this 
plot with a lot more sex thrown in. This movie should have never 
even made it to theaters. Just ship it directly to Cinemax and save 
us some time.</P>
