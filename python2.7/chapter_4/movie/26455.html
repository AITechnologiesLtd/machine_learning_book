<PRE>"Get Carter" And Suffer the Consequences
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>"My name is Jack Carter, and you don't want to know
me" says our brooding anti-hero (Sylvester Stallone). 
Take his advice!  To know this guy is as rewarding as
being thrown over a terrace.  And to watch this film
is almost as painful.  "Get Carter" is a gloomy
looking, unimaginative film that offers no joy.</P>
<P>Jack Carter is as tough as tough guys come.  He works
out of Vegas as a self-described 'financial adjuster'.
 Explaining his duties, he says, "people make promises
and break them.  I help them remember."  He has a
chiseled body full of tattoos.  He has the weathered
look indicative of a man who has seen his share of
hard times.  He speaks in a hushed but menacing tone
of voice.  In other words, this is Sylvester Stallone
acting like...Sylvester Stallone.  And like most of
his previous roles, his character is a shallow,
one-dimensional thug whose modus operandi is to talk
tough, hassle a few hapless people, find out what he
needs to know, and then dispense his own kind of
justice.  With the charisma of a pit bull, being tough
is all that Jack Carter knows.  </P>
<P>Yet, even tough guys know when to put family first. 
As the story begins, we learn that Jack's little
brother has died in a car accident.  The police
attribute it to heavy drinking.  However, Jack is
suspicious, believing that he was 'taken out'.  He
takes a break from his Vegas duties and tries to see
if he can find the truth.  As he pokes around, he runs
into several lowlife characters.  They include a shady
business partner, a prostitute, a dweebish millionaire
molded after Bill Gates, and an oily owner of a porn
website.  </P>
<P>Any one of them may know something about his brother's
death.  All of them have the means of carrying out the
deed.  But don't expect an exercise in sleuthing where
well-placed clues lead Carter to the truth.  He's all
brawn and no brains, so there are no epiphanies during
his investigation.  Instead, he uses intimidation to
muscle his way forward, cycling through this circle of
suspects.  Flustered with his lack of progress, he
cycles through them again and again.  This all gets
tiring fairly quickly.  By the time the film launches
into its final act, we're numb from its pedestrian
pace.</P>
<P>Oddly, as a tough-guy thriller, it starves us for
action.  Admittedly, there is one nifty chase
sequence, but this is related to a tangential and
needless plot (Carter's Vegas ties send thugs to
retrieve him).  The story also fails to generate any
kind of emotion.  Stallone has the personality of a
slab of stone.  And the look and feel of the film is
perpetually downcast.  The weather is constantly
overcast or rainy.  Meanwhile, most shots take place
at night, in dimly lit rooms, or in dark alleys.  It's
just impossible to get stirred about that kind of
atmosphere.  As a result, "Get Carter" amounts to
nothing more than a flat thriller, bereft of clever
moments and devoid of any excitement.  You're better
off leaving this guy alone.</P>
