<PRE>                            THE 13TH WARRIOR
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Take a little BRAVEHEART, take a little BEOWULF.  Mix them together
with a bit of THE GOONIES, and you've got yourself THE 13TH WARRIOR</P>
<P>     Here, at last, is a movie that is *exactly* what you expect it's
going to be.  From the opening scene, where Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan (Bandaras)
is shipped across the world for political reasons, to the end, where
Ahmed finds himself an unlikely hero amidst a group of Norse warriors,
this is a traditional, big, action movie from start to finish.</P>
<P>     There's no mysterious surprise or turn of events.  The bad guys
(aka `The Eaters of the Dead,' taking their name from the Michael
Crichton book on which this film is based) are just a bunch of bad guys
with no reason for being bad.  The good guys are a bunch of Nordic
barbarians that spit, insult one another, and seem to enjoy pain.
Banderas is an Asian Zorro.  The movie clocks in just under two hours,
whereupon you get up from your seat and leave the theater, trying to
form an opinion about what you've just seen.</P>
<P>     And I found that incredibly difficult to do.  THE 13TH WARRIOR is
simply without thrills and excitement.  It's also without any huge
negatives that would compel me to tell you to avoid the movie.  It's
just *there*.</P>
<P>     And that's hardly worth getting excited about, for good or for
bad.  Skip this one, and check out the *other* McTiernan film playing
right now: THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR.</P>
