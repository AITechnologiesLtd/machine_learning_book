<PRE>GODZILLA 2000</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * *</PRE>

Written by: Hiroshi Kashiwabara</PRE>
<P>The big green guy is back, and he starts off with a bang. Godzilla is 
terrorizing a small bay community while a group of Godzilla trackers follows 
him. The group consists of Yuji Shinoda (Takehiro Murata), a scientist who 
has been studying Godzilla for years; his daughter, Io (Mayu Suzuki), who 
appears to be an expert with electrical equipment; and a reporter, Yuki 
Ichinose (Naomi Nishida). Meanwhile, a meteor has been discovered by Dr. 
Shiro Miyazaki (Shiro Sano), an old friend of Yuji. It turns out that the 
meteor is actually an alien spacecraft. The local government, led by Yuji's 
long time enemy, Mitsuo Katagiri (Hiroshi Abe), orders it and Godzilla 
destroyed. Yuji has other plans for Godzilla, since he has determined that 
the lizard's healing factor can be harnessed and used to revolutionize 
modern medicine. Nevertheless, Katagiri wants the lizard destroyed, and he 
sets out to do just that. However, before Katagiri can carry out his 
dastardly plan, the alien's plans are learned by Yuji. The plan is to 
destroy the earth, and Godzilla is needed to do that (it's never exactly 
explained why). So what does the alien do? Why it changes into possibly the 
goofiest looking alien creature ever and takes on Godzilla, mano-a-mano.</P>
<P>Ah nostalgia, how it can cause us to do foolish things. Is there any reason 
other than because you're feeling nostalgic that you'd go to see a movie 
like "Godzilla 2000"? It can't be because you're looking for great special 
effects, acting, plot, dialogue, or cinematography, because that's not what 
Godzilla movies are about. Godzilla movies are about, uh, guys in big rubber 
suits destroying Tokyo. Hmm, that sounds mildly ridiculous doesn't it? Maybe 
so, but that's exactly what you expect out of a Godzilla movie. You want to 
see the big green lizard smash up Tokyo for awhile until a big, climactic 
showdown with another monster. If that's not what you want to see, what in 
the world are you doing reading this review? So, now that we've gotten all 
that out of the way, you're probably wondering how "Godzilla 2000" holds up 
as compared to the multitude of past Godzilla flicks. Well, it's rather a 
hit and miss situation I'm afraid. You see, all the requisite props for a 
Godzilla movie are present. We've got tanks and helicopters and strange new 
weapons to hurl at the big guy even though we know they're not going to do a 
bit of good; we've got the strange new threat that only Godzilla can defeat; 
and we've got the good scientist who knows this but no one in the military 
will listen to him. Unfortunately, we've got one more thing that past 
Godzilla flicks haven't had. We've got lots and lots of inane, scientific 
ramblings to fill up time that could be better spent watching the lizard 
blow things up.</P>
<P>Normally I devote this section of the review to a critique of the acting in 
a film, but, well, this is Godzilla. "Godzilla 2000", as you all should 
know, is not a movie which can be criticized in any way for acting for two 
reasons: one, the dubbing is so bad you can't tell if the actors are doing 
well or not; and two, Godzilla movies aren't about real actors, they're 
about extras who run around in panic while things explode all around them. 
So instead I'm going to devote this paragraph to the ways in which this 
newest Godzilla movie is different from the ones in the past. First of all, 
the dubbing seems to have actually gotten worse. At least before the actors' 
mouths would be moving while the inane dialogue spilled forth. Second, the 
filming actually looks a bit more professional this time around, at least at 
the start of the film. Never fear though, I think they used up the entire 
budget in the first twenty minutes or so, and the film's look more closely 
matches that of the original films by the end. Third, there's a lot more 
swearing in this Godzilla film than I remember in past ones, but that could 
just be my memory playing tricks on me (it's been known to do that 99% of 
the time). Last is the fact that in the past the humans have always hurled 
all their weapons at Godzilla, he's gotten really angry, and all the human 
weapons have been destroyed. In this version, the humans' weapons don't even 
slow the big guy down. He doesn't bother destroying any of them because he 
couldn't seem to care less that they're there. Maybe his skin gets tougher 
with age.</P>
<P>In case you didn't notice, the plot to this Godzilla film sounds a little 
bit complicated. That's because this one is so full of scientific baloney 
they forgot to give people what they really wanted. We still get great, 
classic lines like: "That thing's tied down with electromagnetic cables, 
it's not going anywhere." When you know the monster's going to break out 
right after those words are spoken. Yet the rest of the film is filled with 
talk about Godzilla's regeneration abilities, and how old the meteor is, and 
all sorts of other things the audience couldn't care less about. The big 
showdown at the end is enjoyable enough; but the rest of the film is just 
talk, and I could tell everyone was getting more than a little antsy. Having 
suffered through such classics as "Godzilla vs. Megalon", I have a pretty 
good idea what kind of Godzilla movie true fans of the franchise like, and 
"Godzilla 2000" doesn't quite meet the standard. Despite improved special 
effects (his atomic breath looks much cooler now), both the quality and 
length of the Godzilla fights have gone down. We get no more than five 
minutes of Godzilla smashing buildings and power lines; and his fight with 
the alien, while entertaining, doesn't come close to his battle with, say, 
Mothra.</P>
<P>Sadly enough, a movie as cheesy as this one has a better soundtrack than 
most mainstream Hollywood productions. It's really nothing more than a mix 
of different classical pieces thrown together, but it's used wisely and it's 
usually appropriate to the scene being played (I hope Hollywood producers 
are taking notes). One last thing I had to note, something which simply 
cracked me up, was the vanishing scenery. For example, in one scene we have 
a four-wheeler driving over a large pile of dirt to get into a tunnel. When 
Godzilla forces the group to drive out of the tunnel in reverse, the pile of 
dirt has vanished. This happens in numerous scenes, if you look hard enough, 
but that was the most blatant example. I'd recommend this latest entry into 
the franchise to those who were disappointed by the American version from 
1998 (What do you mean that's everyone?) and want to see the big guy back in 
a rubber suit, like god intended. Just make sure your expectations are nice 
and low before going in. "Godzilla 2000" runs a decent 90 minutes, and I 
give it three out of five stars.</P>
