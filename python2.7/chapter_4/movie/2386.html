<P>     Gerard Depardieu's interpretation of Cyrano De Bergerac was a
definitive character in modern cinema, not to mention a jewel in the
crown of his career.  In fact, he was so impressive in that role that
the producers of the comedy MY FATHER THE HERO took notice and gave him
something similar--a scene where, while in hiding, he feeds poetic
lines of love to his daughter as she courts the favor of a reluctant
boyfriend.  For some odd reason, it just doesn't have the same impact.</P>
<P>     The reunion of Andre (Gerard Depardieu) and his fourteen-year old
daughter Nicole (Katherine Heigl) is hardly a warm affair.  Despite
having planned their vacation to the Bahamas for a year, Andre is still
the focus of Nicole's anger as the result of a past misdeed.  After the
pair arrives at their destination, Nicole does all she can to get away
from her repressive ogre of a father.  When she meets Ben (Dalton
James) and her initial attempts to impress him fail, she tries a
different tactic: claiming that Andre is actually her lover (and an
ex-jailbird to boot).  And while the lie has favorable results for her,
the same can't be said for poor papa, who becomes the object of
suspicious glances, malicious rumors, and outright hostility.</P>
<P>     Admittedly, this is an unusual premise for a comedy, and MY FATHER
THE HERO sadly fails to take advantage of the possibilities.  Instead
of going for outright zaniness, the film attempts to stay within the
bounds of "good taste" and family values (in spite of the obvious
Oedipal inklings), which not only dilutes the humor but results in an
unwatchable climax involving a water rescue.  There are some funny
moments, such as Andre singing "Thank Heaven for Little Girls" to a
crowd of shocked onlookers, but there aren't enough laughs to justify
the rest of this lame production.</P>
<P>     Mr. Depardieu does the kind of job one might expect from a
respected actor thrown into a stupid movie.  He's fine, but the script
doesn't give him much opportunity to show his range.  Katherine Heigl
has little acting ability, as becomes apparent when her attempted sobs
come out as dry-eyed squints.  No one is likely to feel a great upsurge
of sympathy for Nicole during those moments.</P>
<P>     There is a big-name, surprise cameo in MY FATHER THE HERO.  The
appearance of this person is perhaps the single reason to sit through
the entire movie.  While the face isn't shown until the last scene,
it's possible for those viewers with discerning ears to determine the
identity very early.  I won't whose career has been blemished (although
they were smart enough to keep their name out of the credits), but
suffice it to say that few would expect a performer of this caliber to
be slumming.  Then again, one hardly anticipates Gerard Depardieu to be
a party to such rubbish, either.</P>
<P>     I won't dwell overmuch on the numerous implausibilities that occur
during the course of MY FATHER THE HERO.  This is, after all, a comedy,
and the rules of reality are often bent in the name of humor.  Too bad
the results aren't more impressive.  However, it is worth making note
of the absolute stupidity of Ben, who swallows every lie without a
moment's incredulity.  I'm surprised Nicole and Andre didn't try to
sell him a bridge.</P>
<P>     Nevertheless, the greatest flaw in MY FATHER THE HERO isn't the
feeble comedy, the limp characterization, or the mediocre acting.
Instead, it's the feeling of unease that pervades the first forty-five
minutes as Nicole and Andre clash while the film tries unsuccessfully
to make light of their dysfunctional relationship.  There are serious
issues bubbling away here that the movie doesn't know how to properly
address, attempting instead to turn them into fodder for humor.
Lighthearted motion pictures should never cause discomfort, but this
one does.</P>
<P>     It's easy to understand how one could be fooled into thinking that
MY FATHER THE HERO might be worth a trip to the theater.  After all,
the trailers contain a few funny moments, there's some potential to the
premise, and Gerard Depardieu lends an aura of respectability.
Unfortunately, all of this means very little.  As the old saying goes,
"appearances can be deceiving," and in this case, they are.</P>
