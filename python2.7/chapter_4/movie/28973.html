<P>"I would appreciate it if you didn't do that again."</P>
<P>Starring Jet Li, Bridget Fonda, Tchéky Karyo, Burt
Kwouk. Directed by Chris Nahon. Rated R.</P>
<P>It's no secret that martial arts film often use their
plot simply to get from one action sequence to
another. When the fight scenes are enough to justify
paying admission, there is no problem with this, as in
most Jackie Chan projects and a lot of the Hong Kong
actioners. When they aren't, well, we're in bad shape.
Kiss of the Dragon, Jet Li's second consecutive
American misfire, plays like one big miscalculation,
and fails even as the most rudimentary entertainment.</P>
<P>Now before I start getting e-mails angrily touting the
genius of Jet Li, let me explain myself. Li is as
spectacular as ever here, and I don't think anyone
would ever dare call his martial-arts-star skills into
question. The problem isn't with him, it's with the
movie's tone. The much touted fight-scenes here are
filmed with such unflinching, unrelenting brutality
that they are unpleasant to watch. They're joyless,
perfuctory; Li's rogue Chinese detective is more of a
killing machine than a hero, a Terminator with a black
belt instead of a metal skeleton. But even the
Terminator in Judgement Day had a sympathetic side.</P>
<P>The plot isn't relevant, but if you're curious, it's
some nonsense about a Chinese law enforcement officer
(Li) sent to Paris to investigate a possible drug ring
and encounter a corrupt Chief of Police (Tcheky
Karyo), who kills people and does sinister things with
no motivation whatsoever. Oh yeah, and Li's character
is also an acupuncture expert who is able to ease pain
and/or kill at the touch of a needle. "Kiss of the
Dragon" is the name of an acupuncture maneuver, in
which you stick a needle in a precise location on the
back of the victim's neck, somehow redirecting all of
the body's bloodflow to the brain and killing the poor
sap more or less immediately.</P>
<P>There's a vague attempt to humanize Li by having him
fall in love with a downtrodden prostitute, whose
daughter is being held hostage, for some reason, by
the villain. This is one of the worst love stories I
have ever seen on screen, even worse than the one in
Pearl Harbor. There's no conviction whatsoever as the
movie barely pays lip service to it; it's only here
because someone apparently thought there should be
some kind of boy-meets-girl subplot.</P>
<P>Kiss of the Dragon was written by Luc Besson, whose
screenplay The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc,
for all of that film's flaws, was at least thoughtful.
I don't know why the guy got himself involved in this
train wreck, but perhaps he wanted to so something
more mainstream after the neverending weirdness of The
Fifth Element and the aforementioned stylized biopic.
I suppose you could call this mainstream, but I'll
choose the bizarre any time of the day.</P>
<P>If action scenes in a movie are going to be brutal
instead of dazzling, you need a story to justify
watching them. The filmmakers behind Kiss of the
Dragon should have rethought their strategy. No one
will walk out of this misbegotten project smiling, but
I hear Rush Hour 2 is coming in just a few weeks. </P>
