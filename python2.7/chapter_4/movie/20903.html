<PRE>The puppy-dog is Spade
Lost and Found</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>"Lost and Found" is a laid back romantic comedy starring David Spade as the
rather unassuming, unlikely lover. His restaurant partner and best bud tells
him, "We thought you were kind of a jerk, until we got to know you." This
line sums the movie. In fact, David Spade's persona sums the movie. At first
look, you don't expect much, the second look is with narrowed eyes as you
contemplate other options for the night, but Spade's low-key humor and
resiliently idling charm eventually quietly worm into your heart.</P>
<P>Spade kidnaps the puppy-dog of his new neighbor (Marceau) in hopes of
winning her heart (Sophie's, not the dog's). Marceau's rich, handsome and
talented ex-fiancée flies over from France after her giving Spade a run for
his money.</P>
<P>The film begins below ground zero, with no action and poor dialogue wrought
with less than funny one-liners. Spade (who is perhaps more charm than
actor) is unfortunately the strongest actor on film until the fair maiden,
Sophie Marceau appears. Aside from the gratuitous French the filmmakers felt
compelled to have her spew, she is perfectly lovely and an interesting
contrast to Spade.</P>
<P>>From a hole, one can only crawl upwards. Surprisingly, this dud pulled
itself up by the bootstraps and even ascended a few feet above sea-level --
giving it's title an unexpected ironic meaning. Eventually, "Lost and Found"
becomes a mellow, romance-lite, comedy with a few good zingers and the heart
of a puppy-dog.</P>
