<P>Teaching Mrs. Tingle, the directorial debut of Scream scribe Kevin Williamson,
is his final attempt in his own genre of teen movies, as he will be "leaving"
the genre, excluding his role of producer and co-writer of this fall's Scream
3, and move onto the romantic comedy genre next, where he hopes to do the same
for that genre, as he did for the entire teen/horror genre, which would be-
revive it with a new feel and edge.  Kevin, you did great while you were in
teen genre, as your biggest hits, Scream and TV's Dawson's Creek, both carry a
cult following, and your name is one of the few movie writers/directors that
any teen could recognize.</P>
<P>Like Williamson's cult phenomenon Scream, Teaching Mrs. Tingle focuses on a
central group of diverse, and offbeat characters, who join forces once
realizing the trouble that could evolve from the situations that are put forth
at them.  Straight A student, potential valedictorian recipient Leigh Ann
Watson (Katie Holmes) wraps up her history project, the grade that will be the
control in receiving a scholarship, and the Valedictorian  honor- A diary
covering the Salem Witch, who was burned at the stake- and she, along with
waitress mother Faye (Lesley Ann Warren), know she has an A project on her
hands.  The only thing standing her Leigh Ann's way of becoming the most
successful student in her class at Gransboro High- the wickedly evil Mrs. Eve
Tingle (Helen Mirren).  Of course, Mrs. Tingle shares not the same gratitude
and excitement as the ambitious Leigh Ann, but instead repulsion, jealousy.  </P>
<P>The above is our introduction into this fun, somewhat clever, sometimes
thrilling film, which slows down for not a second, which isn't necessarily a
good thing, as just as the decisions and choices the lead characters make
aren't so great, Williamson doesn't make the best decisions either, creating a
somewhat mediocre film.  What results from the setup, that does everything it
should- make you hate this evil witch- Teaching Mrs. Tingle transfers to the
dark, wicked type humor used in this summer's Drop Dead Gorgeous, or last
spring's Jawbreaker- Which by the way, holds no such quality as this film.</P>
<P>Jo Lynn (Marisa Couglan), an aspiring actress, who is loyal best friend to
Leigh Ann, is willing to take any risks to get Leigh Ann where she wants to go
in life- to become a writer.  When the two best buds and junkie student Luke
Churner (Barry Watson) get caught in a scandalous situation in the school's
gymnasium, which could potentially ruin the three's entire futures, by Mrs.
Tingle, the three are desperate to redeem their futures from Tingle, at her
home, where they offer their apologizes.  Of course, Tingle rejects any such
apology, and the night changes from trying to make up for wrong doings, into 
an extreme wrong doing- Holding Tingle captive in her own home, tied to her
bed, gagged, only fed sparingly. </P>
<P>For the rest of the film, Teaching Mrs. Tingle delivers its share of big
laughs, suspenseful moments, and strong performances.  The latter mainly stands
for the devilishly clever performance by Helen Mirren, who conducts herself as
if she were Queen Elizabeth, strutting around school passing out failing
grades, and spewing downright nasty dialogue, creating an unlikable, yet
fun(ny) antagonist.</P>
<P>Katie Holmes' great talent for acting is fighting for a bigger, more mature
character, but Holmes continues to go into teen roles like this one, and in
1998's Disturbing Behavior, in which she will be limited to in her career,
unless she gets out of the role as Joey Potter on T.V.'s Dawson's Creek. 
Holmes adds a needed edge on the hit T.V. show, but more serious, mature roles
are out there, which Holmes could grab in an instant.  Holmes shined in last
spring's Go, which was her first attempt outside of the teen genre, but she
falls back into it here.  Although Holmes portrays her character with a touch
of sympathy and reality, her acting skills, which can be seen best in Go and
Dawson's Creek, are way beyond Leigh Ann Watson.</P>
<P>Marisa Coughlan, a relative newcomer, gives a hilarious, often over the top
performance, delivering the strong dialogue and gimmicks (The Exorcist
imitation comes to mind) perfectly from the screenplay.  Barry Watson, who
appears on the television hit 7th Heaven, doesn't bring his character to life
as he could have, but the way the screenplay has him conducting himself is
enough to form a semi strong character, even though Watson doesn't carry out
the duty fully.  </P>
<P>Williamson's lead four characters are so vivid and bursting with life, you wish
they could have landed roles in a film that is as full as they are, but like
last winter's The Faculty, which Kevin also wrote, Teaching Mrs. Tingle's
characters and cast are the standouts, as the screenplay, setting, etc. become
only an afterthought of the overall product.  The screeplay isn't highly
original and doesn't exactly break new ground, and shows signs around the edges
of the average teen flick, which is a strong weakness, but Williamson's writing
edge, which can be seen in every one of his movies, is shining big and bright
here - The quick, sarcastic, snappy dialogue, the stereotypical characters, the
dark humor, the suspense- What one could call Williamson-esque.  </P>
<P>Teaching Mrs. Tingle is the most mediocre Williamson works as of yet, as the
film isn't always interesting, as in the second half, repetitiveness becomes a
strong problem for the film, but the characters power Teaching Mrs. Tingle from
start to finish, as the screenplay just plods along.  </P>
<P>It's impossible for a movie to be completely character driven and still be a
great one, and that's where the problem lies in Teaching Mrs. Tingle.  It's
obvious that not much time and effort was spent bringing the potentially great
screenplay to the big screen, as Williamson has stated many times that he is
very busy with his upcoming television show, WasteLAnd, but if Williamson
really wanted to add another strongly successful title to his genre, he could
have at least polished up the screenplay with more originality and twists,
instead of only concentrating on his quirky characters.  Williamson's
screenplay redeems itself for the most part in the final moments of the film,
in the suspenseful, and hilarious climax, that you actually start feeling bad
for the evil witch, that is Mrs. Tingle.</P>
<P>The Bottom Line- Teaching Mrs. Tingle isn't as clever or as edgy as
Williamson's other works, but the stereotypical characters and strong
performances from Mirren, Holmes, and Coughlan allow Tingle to be entertaining,
summer fun.    </P>
