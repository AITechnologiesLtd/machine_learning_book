<PRE>Deep Blue Sea Review
Starring: Samuel L. Jackson,LL Cool J</PRE>
<P>  So far this year, we haven't seen many fast paced or exciting films.  Mummy
fell flat, due to cardboard acting, Entrapment was a laughfest, and The
Haunting failed to work at all.  Deep Blue Sea itself has many faults, but it
entertains, despite a deep hole in it's script.</P>
<P>  In this film we are brought to a deep sea station where scientists (Saffron
Burrows,Thomas Jane, Michael Rappaport) franticly work on a project that may
cure Alzheimer's.  The process is a bit complicated though, and that's where
things go balistic.  The scientists use the shark's brain tissue to see if
there is a way to cure this disease, but there isn't enough time to get into
this storyline.  The sharks are suddenly smarter as they close in on the group
of scientists.  The film quickly becomes a race to get out of the facility, to
avoid these smart sharks. This may sound like a nice thrill-ride, but it
suffers mainly from being a rip-off.</P>
<P>  Many of the key action scenes are exciting, but are worn out.  Why you may
ask? because it all seems too familiar.  The deep sea station looks like
something out of Waterworld, the hallways and some of the water sets look like
a scene from  Alien Resurrection, the sharks of course are much like Jaws, the
race to get out is like a scene out of the Poseidon Adventure, and even with
Samuel L. Jackson aboard, it reminds you of Jurassic Park in ways.  Everything
just feels like a recurring dream here, and that's not even half of the
problems.</P>
<P>  It's not surprising to me the acting was stale.  In every blockbuster this
year, this seems to be a forgotten element.  They roam around and act like
complete airheads until they encounter a creature (usually a digital effect). 
It's then they start running, and by then you could care less about them. Once
again that's what happens here.   Thankfully only Samuel L. Jackson's talent
was wasted, since the rest of the cast haven't been noticed in any other film,
except for LL Cool J.  He too tries to step up, but is only here to provide
comic relief. Cheap relief at that.</P>
<P>  On the brighter side, this film actually was kind of fun, believe it or not. 
Even if the characters were bland, the sharks were there to entertain the
audience while they wreak havoc aboard the station.  Oddly enough the sharks
aren't 50 feet tall like they are on the poster, in fact they're rather small. 
The only problem I had with the sharks were, that they were a bit too animated
during a feast.  Other than that, they were basically the only thing of
interest in this film.</P>
<P>  When it's all over, it's a bit shocking and disappointing. So far this year,
most of the blockbusters have let audiences down, due to lack of characters and
script. It's the closest thing teens will get to seeing Jaws on the big screen,
minus the scares.</P>
