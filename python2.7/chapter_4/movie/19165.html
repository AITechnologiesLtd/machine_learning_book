<P>In Spike Lee's crackling "Summer of Sam," the lead character is not an 
individual, but an entire neighborhood; specifically, a Bronx 
neighborhood in 1977, when the killing spree of a demented postal worker 
took an already blistering New York summer and cranked the temperature 
even a few degrees higher. Like "Do The Right Thing," Lee's best film, 
this is a kinetic tapestry about temptation, anger, bigotry and paranoia, 
one which gives the viewer a sense that everything is about to come apart 
and we are witnessing the last few moments before the meltdown. "Summer 
of Sam" has moments that are tough to watch, but for the most part, they 
are so well-presented that it is impossible to avert your eyes.    </P>
<P>Writer Jimmy Breslin sets the scene, and in short order, we witness a 
figure lumbering through the night; David Berkowitz, the Son of Sam 
killer, committing his sixth and seventh murders. While the entire city 
is galvanized by the crimes, the film follows one group of people near 
the heart of the madness. John Leguizamo is Vinny, a hairdresser who 
routinely cheats on his wife Dionna (Mira Sorvino), seeking out women who 
will do the things he dares not request of his spouse, then wallowing in 
guilt over his actions. Dionna, who works in her father's Italian 
restaurant, pretends not to notice her husband's philandering and tries 
to come up with something, anything, that will inspire him in their own 
bed.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Vinny's best friend Ritchie (Adrien Brody) has shaken up the 
locals by adopting the punk look, sporting spiked hair, freaky clothing, 
a bad English accent and loads of attitude. To them, he has mutated into 
some bizarre and possibly dangerous alien life form. Even after he hooks 
up with Ruby (Jennifer Esposito), the official neighborhood slut, he 
continues working as a dancer/hustler in a seedy gay nightspot, while 
pursuing dreams of musical stardom in the burgeoning punk scene at CBGB's.</P>
<P>As the Son of Sam continues his reign of terror, now sending letters to 
Jimmy Breslin boasting of his actions, the citywide tension escalates. 
Street traffic decreases as people stay in the safety of their homes, 
while many of the women who do venture out color their hair blond or don 
wigs, because the female victims thus far have been brunettes. Two police 
officers approach local crime lord Luigi (Ben Gazzara) for help and soon, 
the neighborhood good old boys are organizing to patrol the streets and 
find the killer themselves. Suspicion rises along with the heat as 
collective mood moves closer and closer to some dread precipice.</P>
<P>Spike Lee is a master at image manipulation and does fine work here, 
deftly incorporating period music, very effective lighting (particularly 
strobe effects and various white lights) and fragments of grainy footage 
at just the right moments to create a riveting feel of immediacy. The 
only time he falters is in his depiction of the twisted mind of the 
killer. Shots of David Berkowitz flailing about his apartment, shrieking 
at a barking dog, look stagy and unconvincing. One particularly daring 
scene shows a dog actually speaking to Berkowitz, courtesy of computer 
graphics. Instead of seeming horrific, the image just looks gimmicky, 
drawing laughs instead of shivers.</P>
<P>Aside from the Berkowitz interludes, Lee's stylings achieve the desired 
effects, drawing us into the various individual vignettes while remaining 
focused on the bigger picture of the dissolution of a neighborhood. Vinny 
and Dionna desperately try to keep their marriage together, visiting 
Studio 54 and Plato's Retreat along the way; Ritchie persists in his 
strange personal odyssey; and the tension keeps growing as the first 
anniversary of the initial Son of Sam attack draws near, with the killer 
promising to celebrate the occasion.  </P>
<P>I've heard complaints that too many of the secondary characters in 
"Summer of Sam" are rough sketches at best and stereotypes at worst, but 
I didn't find them troubling, because this is a film about a group 
mentality rather than sharply defined personal profiles. That said, the 
lead characters all do fine work, particularly Leguizamo and Sorvino, 
both of whom provide appropriate depth and richness to their characters.  </P>
<P>While not approaching the glimmering perfection of "Do The Right Thing," 
"Summer of Sam" is another impressive step in Spike Lee's evolution as a 
filmmaker. His innovative techniques are less obtrusive than in previous 
works, efficiently serving this disturbing tale of the variances of 
societal tides without coming off like showboating. Except for the 
talking dog, of course.</P>
