<P>The long and illustrious career of Robin Williams, which has included
both forgettable turns like MRS. DOUBTFIRE and FLUBBER, was punctuated
with the actor's first Academy Award in 1998 for his role in GOOD WILL
HUNTING. It was his first truly dramatic role since 1989's DEAD POETS
SOCIETY, and critical remarks were unanimously positive. His next role,
that of a deceased pediatrician in WHAT DREAMS MAY COME, was
unfortunately lackluster. And so, after a six-year stint as a comedic
actor, the proof on whether or not Williams can cut it in the dramatic
league has come down to PATCH ADAMS. </P>
<P>Williams is the title character, Hunter "Patch" Adams, sporting scruffy
facial hair that falls between the clean-shavenness of DREAMS and the
grotesque hairiness of WILL HUNTING. We're introduced to Patch as he
commits himself to a mental institution because of his suicidal
tendancies. It's at the institution, however, that he discovers a latent
talent for relating to people. He removes himself from the institution
and enrolls at the University of Virginia's medical college, where he
finds that medical doctrine is a calculating, impersonal trade. His
attempts to inject humanity into the profession result in several bouts
with expulsion, and the movie climaxes with Patch's appearance before
the state medical board. </P>
<P>The characters are well-defined in an Oscar-worthy sense. Although the
script does not perform well as a narrative -- there's little story to
be told outside of Patch's skit-length experiences -- the script does go
a long way toward building the relationships of characters. At medical
school, Patch meets up with Truman Schiff (Daniel London), an outsider
like himself who relishes Patch's zest for humanity. The two instantly
become the best of friends, and it's easy to see why. Monica Potter
plays Patch's love interest, a young woman who personifies the things
that Patch hates about medical school. For some reason he's attracted to
her, and although it never gets said, the audience understands from an
intrinsic point of view. The script -- based on Hunter Adams' own story
-- works well this way. </P>
<P>The rest of the cast, Bob Gunton as the villain professor in particular,
is solid. Director Tom Shadyac (LIAR LIAR) leads us in and out of
Patch's life in a sound, intentional manner; combined with Williams'
presence on screen, the movie rarely becomes boring. PATCH ADAMS' lack
of purpose is its major shortcoming, and for the first ninety minutes
out of two hours, there's little feeling of continuity or the passage of
time. Nevertheless, it's an emotionally moving picture, and PATCH ADAMS
looks to be one of the more memorable of the holiday season. It succeeds
at everything it tries, and only fails at the stuff it doesn't try in
the first place. By and large there may be another Oscar nomination
herein for Williams, but more importantly, it's entertainment for the
entire family. </P>
