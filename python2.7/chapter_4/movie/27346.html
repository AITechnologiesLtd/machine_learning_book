<PRE>Spice World (1997) 89m</PRE>
<P>SPICE WORLD is like a jigsaw puzzle in reverse: you start with the completed 
picture and then dismantle it piece by piece, revealing how the whole thing 
was locked together to begin with.  It's an obvious metaphor for film 
criticism, but with a textbook example such as this, there is very little 
beyond the obvious.  The same processes for its criticism are responsible 
for its creation ; you can almost hear the production meetings behind every 
scene.</P>
<P>For a brief period near the end of the 90s, the five-girl pop group Spice 
Girls saw a meteoric rise to fame and fortune – would that shooting star 
have turned out to have been more akin to Halley's instead of the 
Shoemaker-Levy they might have lasted longer before plunging back down into 
the atmosphere just as suddenly – garnering legions of young fans and 
saturating the mass media with their visages and, occasionally, music.  As 
with any other product, the group was marketed with a slogan, ‘Girl Power' 
and the Girls themselves were similarly packaged with the epithets Sporty, 
Angry, Ginger, Baby and Posh.  It's the same strategy that worked with the 
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (substitute monikers for colors), and is aimed 
at pretty much the same age range, so why not?  It was only a matter of time 
when a Spice Girls movie was going to arrive on the scene, and just as 
inevitable that it would open itself up to criticism from those who were 
fast wearying of the group.  Using the tried and true template of the 
Beatles' A HARD DAYS NIGHT, SPICE WORLD follows the misadventures of the 
five Spices and their harried manager as they prepare for a big show.</P>
<P>Having established a pretty basic formula, the next decision of the 
film-makers was to ward off the expected criticism of the girls' images and 
the likely transience of their fame by getting their own scripted potshots 
in first.  The overall tone of the piece isn't self-deprecating enough to 
pull this off, although ironically the predictions of girls leaving the 
group, falling pregnant and failing to maintain the heights of their chart 
success did come true within a couple of years of the film's release.  
Instead we are left with the rather curious sight of the ‘real' Spice Girls 
playing the characters of the Spice Girls who are trying to break out of 
their media conceptions and into the ‘real' Spice Girls.  In the long term, 
we're left with no more insight in their feature than one of their music 
videos, and those who have never seen the five performers before will be 
hard pressed to see what the fuss was about or even to differentiate them.  
As far as the film is concerned, one is a bit more ‘working class' than the 
others, one rolls her eyes a lot, one sucks a lollipop, one seems sulkily 
detached, and one has ginger hair.  If you need to learn more, tune into the 
wonderful music trivia show POP-UP VIDEO.</P>
<P>SPICE WORLD is so dedicated to distracting attention from itself that it 
fabricates an abundance of subplots and throws in a huge number of cameos – 
the old tactic of endorsing a celebrity product by surrounding it with those 
who already have credibility (Jonathon King, Elvis Costello, Jools Holland 
and others).  The camera is almost afraid to linger on any one member of the 
group, so the dialogue becomes a string of one-liners.  Meanwhile, dance 
routines and songs drift in and out of the story, the Girls jump from one 
unrelated scene to the next and for a finale the film starts spoofing its 
own status as a vehicle for the group.  By its very nature SPICE WORLD is 
consumed quickly and then forgotten.  It's not a bad film (has anybody ever 
tried to watch that Pet Shop Boys movie more than once?), it's just that it 
was never possible for it to be particularly good.</P>
<P>As SPICE WORLD is primarily an exercise in promotion it would make criticism 
on cinematic grounds redundant (doubly so when you consider that its target 
audience of youngsters would not be the type to even read reviews) unless 
the purpose of the act was to be seen as providing a record of a cultural 
phenomenon.  Will the 12-year old girls who saw this movie in 1997 be 
reading the reviews out of interest or nostalgia many years later?  It looks 
as though even the Spice Girls read their demographic wrong: as the film's 
credits roll, Mel B stares into the camera lens and says decisively to the 
other members of the group that the audience is about to leave the cinema 
and go to the pub.  Hardly.</P>
