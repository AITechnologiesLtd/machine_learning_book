                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>

Screenplay/Director:  Andrew Fleming.

<P>     I think "The Wonder Years" may be to blame.  There was a time when
I didn't take particular notice of voiceover narration one way or the
other; it was just another part of a movie.  Now I'm not sure whether
it is the content of the narration or my perception that has changed,
but it seems lately that hearing narration at the beggining of a film
is enough to make me suspicious.  There comes with some narration a
pretentiousness that can weigh down a simple story or pummel an
audience over the head with a moral.  THREESOME has all the elements to
be a successful lighthearted character romp, but many of its strengths
are obscured by the moments it takes itself far too seriously.</P>
<P>     THREESOME opens in the mid-term at an unnamed university, where
two new transfers prepare to join a returning student in a three-person
dormitory suite.  The returning student is Stuart (Stephen Baldwin), a
boorish womanizer; his new roommates are Eddy (Josh Charles) and Alex.
Much to everyone's surprise, Alex (Lara Flynn Boyle) turns out to be a
woman, assigned to the room through a bureaucratic blunder.  Tensions
are high at first, but eventually the three become close friends.
Naturally, romantic attractions begin to get in the way.  Stuart is
attracted to the fiery Alex.  Alex is attracted to the sensitive Eddy.
And Eddy, who is just discovering his sexual identity, is attracted to
Stuart.</P>
<P>     THREESOME is set up almost as a three-character stage play wherein
other characters exist only to make observations on the behavior of the
three principal characters, and those characters are established with
widely varying degrees of success.  Stuart is probably the most
interesting and fully-rounded character, one who bears many of the
marks of a stereotypical college jerk but responds to his roommate's
sexual orientation with minimal sturm und drang.  Stephen Baldwin is
surprisingly charming in the role, spewing forth sexual single-entendre
with an infectious enthusiasm.  Josh Charles is appropriately tense as
the confused Eddy, one of those over-thinkers many of us knew (or were)
in college.  Still, there comes a point where his heaviness is a bit
much for an audience to take.  Lara Flynn Boyle, who has gone from
looking too old for her part as a high school student on "Twin Peaks"
to looking too old for her part as a college student here, does some
interesting things with a character who never really finds a center.
Alex is part sex kitten, part basket case, and several other parts of
several other characters, and it's difficult for anyone to strike the
right tone with such a character.</P>
<P>     What did work strike a chord with me was the interaction between
the three characters, which was extremely reminiscent of relationships
I knew.  College was filled with people who bantered and sparred,
trying desperately to ignore sexual tension, and while the specifics of
the relationship between the three characters in THREESOME are somewhat
unique, that dynamic is not.  The dialogue, while tending toward the
unrealistic, is still frequently funny, and I found myself basically
engaged in the lives of these three people as long as they weren't
navel-gazing about how hard it all was.</P>
<P>     And it is on the level of its self-consciousness that THREESOME
falls somewhat flat.  What could have been a lively and fairly
entertaining look at a slightly different kind of romantic triangle
instead becomes a film that tries far too hard to be *about*
something.  The narration, which comes retrospectively from Eddy, is
filled with descriptions that could just as easily have been provided
visually, and with pseudo-profound pronouncements about that wrong turn
that becomes the best part of a trip.  There are a couple of three-way
love scenes which are handled deftly, but much of Andrew Fleming's
direction is leaden.  It appears as though he wasn't quite clear that
he had a decent little comedy on his hands; it wasn't really necessary
to try to turn it into an earth-shaking drama.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 romantic permutations:  6.</PRE>
