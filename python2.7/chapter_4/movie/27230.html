<PRE>CAST AWAY
---------</PRE>
<P>Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) emphasizes the digital clock just installed in
Fed Ex's newest office in Russia to his new hires in training.  He calls
his girlfriend Kelly (Helen Hunt) to rhapsodize over the fact that he's 
sorting packages within the shadows of Red Square, and that he'll be
home for Christmas in Memphis in eighteen hours.  At the extensive family 
dinner table, the troubleshooter is beeped for another emergency halfway
around the world, forcing him to exchange gifts with Kelly in their car at 
the airport.  She gives him a pocket watch containing her picture that had 
belonged to her grandfather.  He gives her a package the size of a ring box, 
waves and declares 'I'll be right back!' in director Robert Zemeckis' "Cast 
Away."</P>
<P>Of course, Chuck isn't right back.  The private FedEx plane he's on begins
to encounter mechanical difficulties in a storm over the Pacific.  Chuck
risks hurtling objects to secure his new pocketwatch, then watches the
sea approaching through the cockpit windshield.  Miraculously, he finds his
way out of the plane and inflates a life raft, which pulls him to the stormy
surface.  Luck is again on his side when he washes up on an abandoned beach.
However, he quickly discovers the island is uninhabitted, so constructs
a large help sign on the beach and begins to gather wreckage, packages
and the one dead body which wash ashore in the aftermath of his crash.</P>
<P>Survival means learning how to open coconuts, catch fish, and make fire.
As it begins to dawn on Chuck that his chances of rescue are slight (he
figures out that the search area must be twice the area of Texas), he
starts to open the FedEx packages he's neatly stacked and protected (ever
the company man).  A punk rock dress is turned into a fishing net; figure
skates are used as cutting tools, and eventually, for dental surgery; video
cassettes provide binding material.  A volleyball, marked with Chuck's own
handprint in blood, looks like a face and becomes Chuck's confident, Wilson.
All the while, though, that precious picture of Kelly beckons and Chuck
knows survival isn't enough - he has to attempt to save himself or die
trying.</P>
<P>"Cast Away's" already gathered reams of press during its production
due to the unusual nature of its shooting schedule.  First, Hanks gained
weight, ballooning over 200 lbs.  The first half of the film was shot,
then went on hiatus as Zemeckis went off and made "What Lies Beneath,"
while Hanks dieted almost fifty pounds off his frame and let his hair
and beard grow wild.  (The transition is handled unimaginatively in
the film with a 'four years later' title card.)</P>
<P>Hanks deserves a lot of credit for tackling this role, not only for the
physical hardships he endured.  Yes, it's Best Actor nomination (and
possibly a third win) time for America's favorite thespian again.  For
almost two hours of the film's 140 minute running time, Hanks is alone.
His Chuck Nolan begins the film as a company guy who's always too on the
move to stop and smell the roses.  While he truly loves Kelly, he has
trouble expressing emotion.  On the island, he goes through hope, despair,
frustration, industriousness, creativity, cowardice and courage.  The
man brings tears to your eyes over a *volleyball*.  </P>
<P>Of the barely-there support, Hunt is fine.  Better is Nick Searcy as Chuck's 
buddy Stan, who's losing his beloved wife of many years to cancer.  Searcy is 
true support to Hanks, playing a man more in touch with life, ironically 
through approaching death, than pre-accident Chuck.  And let's not forget
Wilson, probably one of the best supporting inanimate object in film history.</P>
<P>Zemeckis' production is top notch, with ace lensing by Don Burgess ("What Lies
Beneath") and tight editting by Arthur Schmidt.  Alan Silvestri's score is 
simple, yet effective.  Screenplay by Willian Broyles Jr. shows provides nice 
grace notes, such as the (Guardian) angels' wings which embellish the 
one package Chuck doesn't open, providing a connection from film's opening to
closing.  Time is measured in seconds, then in months.</P>
<P>"Cast Away" is a reflection upon what's really important in life and 
a showcase for Hanks' acting abilities.</P>
