<PRE>                               THE BIG SQUEEZE
                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1997 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>The Big Squeeze (1996) **1/2 out of ***** - Cast: Lara Flynn Boyle, Peter
Dobson. Writer and Director: Marcus DeLeon.</P>
<P>Lara Flynn Boyle has always struck me as an odd actress.  Not odd as in she's
weird, but odd in her choices of characters.  In interviews she has always
come across as someone you'd want to hold in your arms and protect her from
everything evil in this world.  But ever since the second (and final) season
of TV's "Twin Peaks", she's mostly played cold, ruthless, and sometimes
downright evil women.  Almost to the point where she'd be typecast in that
type of role.  So when a movie like "The Big Squeeze" comes around, no matter
how her character is presented, you think she has some sort of ulterior
motive.</P>
<P>As the film begins, Benny (Peter Dobson from "The Frighteners") is being
thrown out of a moving train for having five kings in his hand during a
poker game.  He goes to a local bar where Tanya (Boyle) is bartending.  He
tries to pick her up, but finds out she's a married woman.  So he tries
another bartender and the two strike up a relationship.</P>
<P>Tanya's husband is a former minor league baseball player named Henry.  Two
years earlier he injured his knee in an accident and hasn't played the game
since.  Also since the accident, Henry has found God and visits the local
mission every day, mostly to pray for himself to be able to play ball again,
but also to pray for forgiveness after he has sex with his wife. He's an odd
guy.</P>
<P>Tanya took the bartending job because Henry's insurance would not pay for
his injury.  One day she opens his mail and discovers that he did in fact
receive a settlement of over $100,000.  Now she thinks that she's entitled to
half of the money.  And she's right.  Henry, however, believes that money is
evil and will not let her have a dime.  They fight, and she leaves him.</P>
<P>Now the plot happens.  Tanya wants her half of the money, so she asks for
Benny's help.  At the same time, the mission which Henry visits daily
desperately needs over $100,000 to repair earthquake damage.  Benny then
concocts a scheme involving the mission's plight to raise money in order to
swindle Henry.</P>
<P>"The Big Squeeze" is pleasant enough, it just doesn't pay off well in the
end. The tone set early on makes it seem as though some sort of double
cross may occur (aside from the OBVIOUS double cross which we all know is
coming), but nothing else really happens. Dobson gives an interesting
performance, and it looks like he might be a mainstay, along with Ms.
Boyle, in this type of low-budget independent film in the years to come.</P>
