<P>     Twelve-year old Yusef (Mohammad Nahlal) has a problem that's common 
to adolescent boys:  he's in love with an older girl.  The object of his 
affection is Aida (Hana Ne'meh), the daughter of a Gypsy family, and, 
while she likes him too, she's not above playing games and seeing how 
far she can manipulate him.  When she mentions that the one who will 
marry her must find the lost three jewels on her grandmother's necklace, 
Yusef is determined to travel to South America to look for them.  His 
chosen method of transportation is, to say the least, unusual.</P>
<P>     There's a serious side to this mostly-lighthearted, magical romp.  
Filmed entirely in Gaza, TALE OF THE THREE JEWELS uses the uneasy 
political backdrop as a story element.  Yusef's father is in prison for 
an unspecified act against the Israelis, and his brother is a member of 
an illegal guerrilla organization.  Curfews are imposed every night, and 
traveling after dark becomes a dangerous prospect. </P>
<P>     One of the things that TALE OF THE THREE JEWELS does exceptionally 
well is to illustrate that even in a land torn by strife, life and 
childhood go on.  Yusef's environment hasn't warped him -- he's 
basically a well-adjusted young boy with many of the same hopes and 
fears as other children all around the world.  Occasionally, violence 
erupts suddenly, but Yusef is able to shrug it off.  It's part of his 
everyday life, and, beyond the initial shock caused by the first shots, 
he has learned to cope with it.</P>
<P>     Director Michel Khleifi, who directed 1987's WEDDING IN GALILEE, 
shows a deft hand at incorporating the divergent elements of stark 
violence and magic realism into this coming-of-age tale.  The ending is 
ambiguous, and we're left unsure whether the final scene reflects a 
dream or reality.  As a result, those who want a happy ending can have 
it; those who crave something more tragic can use that interpretation.  
In the final analysis, TALE OF THREE JEWELS is about the resilience and 
boundless optimism of children -- qualities that the nonstop brutality 
of Gaza have sucked out of many adults.</P>
