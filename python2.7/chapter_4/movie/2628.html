<PRE>                               THE BLUE        KITE
                      A        film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  The life of one Chinese family through
     fourteen years of political upheaval is chronicaled in this
     moving but        very downbeat film.  It        was censored in        China, not
     too surprisingly.        The film lacks focus at        times, but many        of
     the situations are        haunting and the film is a moving
     indictment        of politics out        of control in Maoist China.
     Rating: low +2 (-4        to +4).</PRE>
<PRE>     THE BLUE KITE is the fictional autobiography of the first fourteen
years of Chen Tietou's life in Mainland        China.        The story goes from Tietou's
parents' marriage in 1953 up through the start of the Cultural Revolution in
1967.  Tietou remembers        himself        as having been a particularly difficult
child, but the problems        he caused were small next to the family's political
troubles.  Tietou's family is perfectly        loyal to the country and is not
particularly political,        yet it still torn apart        repeatedly and eventually
destroyed by the vagaries of a powerful, repressive and        capricious political
system.         Much of what happens in the early parts of this film will remind
Americans of McCarthyism.  Yet the fact        that these are just ordinary people,
not celebrities        or people in the public        eye, reminds the viewer        at how much
pervasive the drive for        political correctness was in China than        it ever        has
been in        the United States.  The        Chens are loyal        enough to the government
that they feel impelled        to bow to the picture of Mao at        their wedding and
sing patriotic songs.  It is very clear        these of not political activists.
They are good hard-working people who believe in Mao and his policies for
China.</PRE>
<P>     Encouraged        by a government        policy anxious to root out its own problems,
Tietou's father        is willing to discuss with friends what        things needed
change.         When this Hundred Flowers policy is replaced by a government stance
more paranoid, local officials turn viciously on Tietou's family.
Repeatedly we see people's loyalty to the government betrayed.        The country
is so anxious to root out supposed traitors that they give the weapon of
political ostracism to anybody who finds it convenient to use it.  In one
chilling sequence schoolboys are tired of school so they accuse        their
teacher        of being a counter-revolutionary and have her humiliated and dragged
away.  It takes        little to be accused of        being disloyal and once        accused
there is little        chance of being        vindicated.</P>
<P>     The film is 139 minutes long and follows Chen Shujuan, Tietou's mother,
through        three marriages        and many life experiences, mostly ending in misery
either because of the system's inadequacies, and its political paranoia.</P>
<PRE>     Some aspects of this film would have played better        to a Chinese
audience.  An important        part of        this film, presumably, are the political
slogans        and posters one        sees as        in the background of many of the scenes.
Only occasionally are the signs        translated in the subtitles, but the viewer
gets the feeling that a        lot was        missed.         Still there is        the compensation
that we        get a view into        town life in China that        is probably more of interest
to Westerners than to Chinese.        I would        give THE BLUE KITE a low +2 on the
-4 to +4 scale.</PRE>
