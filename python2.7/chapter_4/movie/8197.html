                                        A Film Review by Jeff Shooman
                                         Copyright 1997 Jeff Shooman</PRE>
<P>First Impressions:  Critically, a close-to-awful film, but money-wise, it has
been doing (and will continue to do) great.  A sometimes-funny film that sags
and lags and oftentimes gets boring.  An orginal plot that grows old real
fast.  One of the only 90 minute films that I've gotten bored through.<HR></P>
<P>MEN IN BLACK has defied the odds.  When I first saw that the flick was
89 minutes long, I thought maybe that this was a poor attempt at an
INDEPENDENCE DAY type film that just ran out of gas.  However, I now
realize that not only did MEN IN BLACK run out of gas, but the film in
90 minutes manages to show off a very original idea (which summer
audiences have embraced) that becomes old about 25 minutes into the movie.</P>
<P>Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith play two "government" agents who are
responsible for keeping order in alien society.  The ridiculous plot begins
when an alien "bug", played weirdly by Vincent D'Onofrio, who was so great in
FULL METAL JACKET, lands on Earth to retrieve a galaxy that's somewhere on
"Orion's belt."  Anyway, the basic plot revolves around Jones and Smith to
stop this bug from getting the galaxy, or a higher power will blow up the
earth.</P>
<P>The premise is ridulous, but that is not why I didn't like this film.  I love
original plots.  This one had an original one.  But director Barry Sonnenfeld
did something to this film that ruined its plot:  He made the film drag and
also put in unncessary elements in it that are found in romance films.
 Whenever I saw D'Onofrio's bug stomp and eat people in the film, it got
terribly boring after a while.  While Smith's wise-cracks did fill in the
gaps, it wasn't enough.  And also, I cannot believe the screenwriters elected
to have a sub-plot where Tommy Lee Jones missed his former lover because as
an alien agent, they can't have contact with any humans really.  And here I
see Jones, at a satellite computer, watching his lover plant the garden?  A
sentimental moment in an alien movie?  Nice try, but I don't think so.  It
doesn't work here.  It just makes the movie even more ridiculous and even
more boring:  We don't only have aliens to worry about, but now we have
Jones's conscience.  </P>
<P>I came into the movie not wanting to see Jones's conscience, but wanting to
see a real action movie that had lots of aliens in it.  Maybe it's unfair
that I partly judged this movie on what my expectations were.  Nevertheless,
even though some parts are indeed funny, the plot in this movie grew old and
boring -- quick.</P>
