<PRE>                                ARACHNOPHOBIA
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1990 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  This film has a plot that has been done
     to death in the past and occasionally better.  Still, my
     spider sense tells me that it may do well with a new
     generation of viewers  who may not be so familiar with its
     predecessors.  Rating: +1.</PRE>
<P>     One tends to expect new ideas in films from Steven Spielberg's Amblin
Entertainment.  And with Disney Enterprises starting a new film branch,
Hollywood Pictures, you would expect something fairly original to inaugurate
the new label.  That makes it all the more puzzling that this collaboration
between Amblin Entertainment and Hollywood Pictures would be a plot that was
already old when Spielberg made CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND .  There
have already been so many "Invasion of the Killer Vermin" films that one
more is no novelty.  In other films we have seen people threatened by
infestations of spiders, ants, birds, slugs, rats, bats, feral dogs, bears,
even frogs.   (Don't ask me how you make a threat out of a frog; I saw the
film and still don't know.  You have to be pretty desperate for phobias to
make a film about killer frogs!)  However well a new film of this type is
done, and ARACHNOPHOBIA was nicely executed, there is not much new you can
put into a film about a small town threatened by an infestation of deadly
spiders.</P>
<P>     The idea of the film is that there is a prehistoric breed of spider--
one with a very different social structure from what modern spiders have--
living isolated in the jungles of Venezuela.  This breed of spider has a
"king" and a bunch of drones, much like bees have with a queen and drones.
That is something of a stretch since spiders are much more closely related
to sea crustaceans than they are to insects.  A plot device that could have
been devised by Rube Goldberg takes the king spider and drops him (quite
literally) into the backyard of a new doctor in a small California town.
Dr.~Ross Jennings (played by Jeff Daniels) has a bugaboo about spiders and
the fact that he has a barn full of them is only one of the many problems he
is facing as a result of moving to Canaima, California, from San Francisco.
There are, in fact, many elements of the plot that executive producer Steven
Spielberg might have found extremely familiar.  We have one lone man, who is
not really accepted by his town, who has to convince disbelieving officials
that they have a problem.  He has his own phobias to overcome, but the love
of his family, charmingly portrayed, convinces him that he has to overcome
his fears and see that the problem gets solved.  Luckily he has a
knowledgeable expert he can call on to help him out and to explain to the
audience how scary the situation really is.  Surely all this must have rung
a bell somewhere in Spielberg's memory.</P>
<P>     What is nice about the film is that it takes the time to develop
characters so that the audience has some understanding and empathy invested
in them.  That too makes the film seem as if it were really a 1970s film.
The viewer gets to know the people who are threatened by the spiders--not as
well as you get to know the Brodie family in JAWS, but far better than you
know anyone in most current horror films.  Nobody follows the new popular
formula of being introduced and making vacuous or stereotyped conversation,
then being quickly dispatched to nobody's regret.</P>
<P>     The effects work usually is believable, though occasionally a spider
just does not scramble right.  A fair number of live spiders were also sued
and unfortunately the film bears no endorsement of the filming practices by
any humane society.</P>
<P>     ARACHNOPHOBIA is entertaining and has some genuinely creepy moments,
but lacks anything that really distinguishes it from other films with very
similar plots and approaches.  I give it a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
