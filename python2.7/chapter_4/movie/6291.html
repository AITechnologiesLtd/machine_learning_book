<PRE>                               MICHAEL COLLINS
                       A film review by Michael Redman
                        Copyright 1996 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>This is one of the most controversial films of recent times, not for the
quality of filmmaking, but rather the subject matter. Depending upon
whom you ask, Michael Collins is either a murdering terrorist and
traitor to his own people or a national hero of Ireland. Again,
depending upon whom you ask, director Neil Jordan ("The Crying Game",
"Interview With A Vampire") either portrays history relatively
accurately or plays fast and loose with the truth.</P>
<P>After the abortive 1916 Easter uprising against the British, Collins
(Liam Neeson) comes to realize that the only tactic left to the Irish is
an undercover war fought by an invisible army. Inventing the modern
terrorism that became the signature of the Irish Republican Army, he and
a small band of men bring England to her knees. As he states, his talent
is mayhem. The problem is that once he wins, it is no longer mayhem that
is needed, but politics. =</P>
<P>Sent to England by Sinn Fein head and president of the Irish Republic
Eamon De Valera (played with an eerie intensity by Alan Rickman) to
negotiate a settlement, Collins returns with less than he hoped for.
Ireland would be divided with the south being a Free State, but having
to pledge allegiance to the English king.</P>
<P>Historically correct or not, the film would have us believe that De
Valera send Collins because he knew what the outcome would be and didn't
want to take the fall himself. The two fellow revolutionaries have a
vicious falling out and civil war breaks out, each on different sides
and each leading forces killing their fellow countrymen. As with many
battles for independence, the real question is what to do when there's a
victory.  =</P>
<P>There are cries of whitewashing Collins' life by changing events to make
him appear more the hero. The less-than-admirable portrayal of De
Valera, also an Irish national hero, will strike some the wrong way,
especially the implication that he was involved in Collins'
assassination. =</P>
<P>Liam Neeson has played larger than life historical figures in
"Schindler=92s List" and "Rob Roy". Now he has stepped into the big shoes=</P>
<P>of Michael Collins. He is the fuel behind the film, although the
co-stars (Rickman, Julia Roberts, Aidan Quinn and Stephen Rea) help
carry it.</P>
<P>The cinematography is moody and with the exception of a technique stolen
from "The Godfather", extremely affective. No matter what your politics,
the craft of the film is beyond debate. And no matter what the
historical realities were, it=92s an extraordinary tale.</P>
<P>It has been said that history is written by the victors, but in the
latter half of the 20th century, history is being written by the
filmmakers. Although the movie itself admits that some events have been
=93fictionalized=94 to create a better story, the truth of the Irish
revolution has become "Michael Collins" for many people. It may be
wishful thinking to believe that we can have a grand film that is true
to the events, but it would be interesting to see someone try.</P>
