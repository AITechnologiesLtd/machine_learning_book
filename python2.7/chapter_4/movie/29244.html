<PRE>Sexy Beast (2001)

<PRE>"Are you gonna do it, yes or no?"
"No."
"Fuck you, wanker, you're doing it!"</PRE>
<P>Starring Ray Winstone, Ben Kingsley, Ian McShane,
Amanda Redman. Directed by Jonathan Glazer. Rated R.</P>
<P>Sexy Beast isn't nearly as interesting as it thinks it
is. It's fueled by lead performances that are far more
electrifying than the characters they embody. As heist
flicks go, this one is stunningly boring, as a
gangster film it's nonsensical and as a character
study it's far too shallow to be taken seriously. But
it is blessed with Ray Winstone and Ben Kingsley, and
they just about redeem Jonathan Glazer's debut effort.</P>
<P>This is the kind of "quirky" British movie that gets
high marks with critics because it opens with a scene
of portly Gal (Ray Winstone), mumbling words like
"burning" and "scorching" while sunbathing in a
Speedo. He's a retired criminal who dreads the arrival
of Don Logan, an über-gangster who will try to reel
him in for One Last Heist. His family, none of them
strangers to the criminal underworld, worry that Gal
will be convinced and leave his tranquil life in a
Spanish villa to risk going to jail.</P>
<P>Don Logan arrives in the form of the terrifying Ben
Kingsley. Yes, the Ben Kingsley who embodied Ghandi
and the mild-mannered Jewish accountant in Schindler's
List. He doesn't take "no" for an answer. Actually, he
doesn't take "no" for anything and completely ignores
Gal's repeated, if rather timid, denials, which
invariably begin with "I'm flattered that you'd think
of me, but..."</P>
<P>The interplay between Kingsley and Winstone is easily
the best thing about this hit-and-miss affair. Their
rapid-fire dialogue can be difficult to understand,
since the British dialect they speak comes from a part
of London that tourists never go, but I had no trouble
keeping up with the general gist of their
conversations, which are often wickedly funny. Still,
there is no insight contained in the back-and-forth;
no Tarantino-like layering and depth. It's
entertaining to watch, yes, but nothing more.</P>
<PRE>Minor spoilers coming up...</PRE>
<P>This would be okay, but the movie takes a wrong turn
after act two, which ends with the dismissal of one of
the main characters and proceeds to stage what may be
the least interesting movie heist in history. There's
a fundamental error in logic here; since everything
that preceded it focuses on whether or not the heist
would take place, there is absolutely no reason for us
to care about its outcome. It takes place. Great. It's
not the appropriate payoff for Glazer's markedly
different set-up.</P>
<P>Ben Kingsley is awesome, yes, and it's almost a
certainty that he will get an Oscar nod come February.
Winstone also does a great job with his underwritten
role. But we have no emotional investment in their
characters or the plot, and it doesn't feel like
Glazer does either. This isn't a mindless Hollywood
cash cow, but there is no impression that it's a labor
of love. Of course, the worst movies can sometimes
have truly dedicated filmmakers behind them
(Battlefield Earth is already a cliche of an example).
I don't know what the big deal is about this. The
general sentiment towards Sexy Beast seems to be a
close equivalent of "where have you been all my life?"
but I don't think it's remotely a great movie. I
wasn't bored, but I didn't care. </P>
