<PRE>WILD WILD WEST</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Brian Takeshita</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  ** out of ****</PRE>
<P>Back in 1965, a show titled "The Wild, Wild West" appeared on the
nation's television sets.  The show centered around Robert Conrad as
James West, and Ross Martin as Artemus Gordon, two Secret Service
agents answering directly to President Grant and sent about the
country to save civilization from conniving criminal elements.  Part
period western and part sci-fi, "The Wild, Wild West" has been
described by many as having been years ahead of its time.</P>
<P>The 1999 film version also seems to be ahead of its time, but in a
different way.  WILD WILD WEST is an immature movie that simply wasn't
thought out as well as it should have been.  In that respect, it was
released ahead of time.  Like that little twist?</P>
<P>The film presents us with Will Smith as West, and Kevin Kline as
Gordon, two mismatched government agents sent to hunt down former
Confederate General "Bloodbath" McGrath (Ted Levine), who is rumored
to be gathering men and weapons to start the Civil War all over again.
However, when McGrath narrowly slips through their fingers, and
President Grant receives a demand to sign over control of the United
States under the threat of the release of an ultimate weapon, the duo
is assigned to find an even bigger fish, Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth
Branagh).  Thought to have been killed fighting for the South during
the war, Loveless has been kidnapping the nation's top scientists, no
doubt for the purpose of building the means to back up his threat.</P>
<P>Without a doubt, Will Smith is the best thing going for this film.
He's likable, handsome, funny, and though a little scrawny, still a
believable action hero.  His comedic timing is better than most actors
out there today, and his ability to win over an audience by playing it
free and easy is quite notable.  This ability is evidenced in several
places in the film, but especially in a scene where he's trying to
talk a group of former southern slave owners out of hanging him.
Reactions of the mob cue the audience into a few extra laughs, but if
the camera never moved off of Smith's face, it would still be a riot.</P>
<P>Kevin Kline makes a valiant attempt at this movie, but just doesn't
have enough good material to keep his character interesting.  Gordon's
banter with West follows the buddy movie line, playing upon the
differences between West's no-nonsense, shoot first and ask questions
later approach, with Gordon's aversion to violence and reliance on
trickery, gadgetry, and costume.  Unfortunately, the conflicts between
the two characters are mostly contrived and therefore are not
conducive to producing much original dialog.</P>
<P>Branagh actually plays a pretty good over-the-top villain, a departure
from what we're used to seeing from the Shakespearean actor.
Unfortunately, his character is in the movie only about half of the
amount he should be, and therefore there isn't enough screentime for
Loveless to really walk around and develop.  You just kind of take it
for granted that he's evil.</P>
<P>As I said earlier, this film could have stood further development
before being put on film and released to theaters.  The overarching
story is fairly complete, but the logic in transitioning from one
scene to the next is sometimes lost and the explanations for certain
actions are fuzzy at best.  For example, it wasn't clear as to why
West and Gordon were looking for McGrath even after they were tasked
with looking for Loveless, and the reason Loveless betrays one of his
allies is never really given (and it's a major plot point).  Later in
the film, Loveless's henchmen (and henchwomen) get knocked off one by
one, but it's not always clear how, and I think at least a couple are
left unaccounted for - they just disappear.</P>
<P>Then there's Rita Escobar (Salma Hayek), whom West and Gordon rescue
from Loveless's lackeys, and then, of course, take along with them for
the rest of the movie.  The character serves no, I repeat, no purpose
in the film whatsoever. She had absolutely nothing to do with the
plot.  Loveless didn't have any kind of vendetta because of her, she
didn't unwittingly lead Loveless to them, didn't even make one of
those contrived dumb-girl mistakes that gets our boys into trouble.
Now, I might be the last person in the world who would complain about
Salma Hayek being in a movie I'm going to see, but the character is
just so superfluous, it's inexcusable.  Either give her something to
do or cut her out altogether.</P>
<P>Director Barry Sonnenfeld, who previously directed Will Smith in MEN
IN BLACK, apparently doesn't know how to shoot fight scenes (and there
are a few in WILD WILD WEST), because you simply can't see what's
going on.  A fist flying here, a kick there is all you can see, then
it's over.  In a more serious picture, this might have merit in adding
to the confusion of the situation, but in an action/comedy, the fights
are supposed to impress.  Hard to do if the action isn't visible.</P>
<P>Too often, the screenplay, apparently written in committee by Brent
Maddock, Jeffrey Price, Peter S. Seaman, and S.S. Wilson, goes for
jokes which are just too obvious.  There's a part, for example, when a
train conductor (M. Emmet Walsh) overhears a conversation between West
and Gordon in the wrong context, and it's supposed to be funny.  Like
I didn't get enough of that from so many years of watching "Three's
Company."</P>
<P>This lack of originality even extends into some of the action
sequences, such as an instance where West is attempting to stop a
runaway horse-drawn wagon by jumping onto the horses themselves.  They
abruptly stop just short of a cliff and send West over the front end,
leaving him dangling over the edge, holding onto the reigns.  Yeah, I
liked it the first time I saw it done with Arnold Schwarzeneggar in
TRUE LIES.</P>
<P>Okay, you know me, I gotta pick out the little things, too.  Loveless
refers to an armored battle wagon as a tank.  History lesson for
today:  The term "tank" did not originate until World War I, when
"tank" was used as a code word to conceal what was at the time a
secret weapon to break the stalemate of trench warfare.  Loveless
might have thought up the concept in the 1860's, but would almost
definitely not have used the word.  You can roll your eyes, now.</P>
<P>WILD WILD WEST has its moments, but they are too few and far between,
and each depends heavily on Will Smith.  It doesn't help, either, that
the end sets us up for a sequel.  Let's hope that if there is another
installment, it'll have a little more kick in the saddle.  Now excuse
me while I go ride off into the sunset.</P>
