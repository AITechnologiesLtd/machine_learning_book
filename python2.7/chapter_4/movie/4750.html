                       A film review by Vince Deehan
                        Copyright 1996 Vince Deehan</PRE>
<P>Written and Directed by James Mangold.
Cast: Pruitt Taylor Vince, Shelley Winters, Liv Tyler, Deborah Harry, 
Joe Grifasi and Evan Dando.
Release Date: December 29th 1995 (UK)</P>
<P>HEAVY is the story of Victor ( Pruitt Taylor Vince ), a painfully shy and
overweight chef and how his obsession with a beautiful young waitress,
Callie ( Liv Tyler ), invades his life and ultimately changes it forever.
The film is set in a quiet town in upstate New York, where Victor works 
at his mother's restaurant.  Victor's mother, Dolly ( Shelley Winters ), hires 
Callie ostensibly to help out her other waitress Delores ( Deborah Harry ) 
but with the hidden intention of matchmaking her with her retiring son. </P>
<P>In the early hours of the morning, as Victor sits alone in a corner of
the then deserted restaurant playing cards, Callie sidles up to him and starts
to casually chat.  Victor is clearly stuck for words yet he manages to 
communicate with her and they proceed to play a card game together. 
This is the start of Victor and Callie's touching friendship.  Victor is 
clearly enamoured by Callie, but just as soon as such ideas start in his head,
he is immediately disappointed when their card game is interrupted by the 
arrival of Callie's guitar-playing mechanic boyfriend ( Evan Dando ), who 
turns up to take her home.  This will not be the last disappointment for Victor 
during the course of the film, and a far more tragic one is in store. </P>
<P>James Mangold's film shows the frustrations of people who, for various reasons,
wish their lives were less routine and more exciting.  Delores, the older
waitress, clearly stuck in a rut ( as are virtually all the characters ),
is in a dead-end job and unmarried in her forties.  She has no shortage of men
she can "take home", but no one special to stay with her and share her life.
She resents Callie from the word go, and it's not hard to see why.  Callie is
young and beautiful and has her whole life in front of her, while Delores'
own future is anything but rosy.  Leo ( Joe Grifasi ) the resident barfly, 
spends every evening propping up the counter in the restaurant, drinking 
himself into a stupor, and clearly sees no future for himself either.  He gets 
so drunk one night that Victor and Dolly take him home, where he sleeps the 
drink off on a camp-bed in Victor's room. </P>
<P>The whole film revolves around Victor and shows in great detail the life of a
man who, crippled by a lack of self-confidence, is trapped in a monotonous 
life and cut off from the world around him.  It is only the arrival of Callie 
and the genuine affection and warmth she shows to Victor that finally makes 
him realise that there is a world outside that he can be part of. </P>
<P>If this all sounds terribly depressing and dull, then you'd be surprised at how
entertaining the film actually is. The main character Victor is not the sort
of character you normally see leading a movie.  Victor is a silent, giant of a 
man and not prone to snappy conversation. In fact, Victor speaks hardly at all
in the film, and rarely more than half sentences at any one time.  Yet Pruitt 
Taylor Vince's performance as Victor is so mesmerising that to take your eyes 
off him for one second would be to miss a subtle facial expression that 
illuminates Victor's soul and lets you see exactly what Victor is thinking 
and feeling.</P>
<P>Pruitt Taylor Vince gives a performance that would surely merit an
Oscar nomination were the film to be released in the US,  and I sincerely
hope that this will happen.  Liv Tyler also gives a very impressive performance
as the young Callie, a difficult role which shows that she has alot of talent 
and Shelley Winters is a delight as Victor's mother.</P>
<P>The writer and director James Mangold has created a wonderful film which 
distinguishes him as a great, and promising talent .  As a mark of his 
achievement, HEAVY was awarded the Special Jury Prize for Direction at 
the 1995 Sundance Film Festival.</P>
