<P>While watching Gary Ross' Pleasantville, I realized how cynical films
have become.  Pleasantville, as its title implies, is not at all
cynical:  in fact, I'd say its most notable virtue is its bright
optimism for human life.  It's a visually impressive film, and one of
the only pictures of the year to use special effects to convey a story
rather than to blind or assault the senses of audience members.  Written
with insight and acted with care, Pleasantville is one of 1998s most
ambitious pictures.  </P>
<P>But, as much as I admire it, it's a seriously flawed picture.  I was
reminded of my recent experience with What Dreams May Come, which is a
visually astounding and ambitious film, as well:  both pictures are
boundless in their ideas, but both fail to assemble the ideas coherently
and make their themes clear.  Pleasantville begins like it really knows
what its about, but by the end, it seems self-important and simplistic
in its claims.  Comparisons to The Truman Show are inevitable, but
Pleasantville lacks the poignancy and bite of Truman.  </P>
<P>It also requires a lot of suspension of disbelief, but I was willing to
humor Ross.  The film's hero is a high-school nerd named David (Tobey
Maguire), a kid obsessed with a TV show of the 50s called
Pleasantville.  The show is, of course, fictional, but it captures the
feel of those TV shows perfectly:  dad comes home every night at the
same time, shouts, "Honey, I'm home!" and his wife has dinner ready for
him.  The kids love their parents.  The balance is there.  Everything is
perfect.  And, through a series of highly unlikely events (I won't
bother explaining, because it's just so strange), David, and his sister
Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) end up inside the show -- inside
Pleasantville.  It's a culture shock, especially to Jennifer, who has
the reputation of "school slut."</P>
<P>After realizing they're in black and white ("We're supposed to be in
color!" Jennifer shouts), they first meet their parents, George (William
H. Macy) and Betty (Joan Allen), and are forced to eat a mountainous
breakfast of pancakes, eggs, and ham steak.  It's a good thing David is
a pro with Pleasantville-trivia, otherwise he wouldn't know who their
friends are, what the neighbors names are, and what is supposed to
happen in each episode.  It's only when they start messing with the
equilibrium that things go awry:  everything begins when Jennifer has
ravenous sex with a basketball jock.  From there, real human emotions
begin to shine through the perfect facade of the show -- rage, passion,
and love emerge, and with these emotions, color.</P>
<P>Technically, the film is fantastic.  Ross, who previously wrote the
scripts for Big and Dave, is an intelligent writer and a gifted artist. 
The look of the film -- beginning with the production design and
concluding with the remarkable contrasts between black & white and color
-- is inventive and a reward for the eyes.  The world of Pleasantville
is complete, and the image never fails to convince.  It's also a
well-written picture in its plot details and characterization; the main
characters are developed fully, and even the secondary characters are
given enough depth to make them interesting.</P>
<P>Of course, it helps that Ross has such a talented cast to work with. 
Maguire makes a good hero; he's sincere, and he's likable in this role. 
Witherspoon nails the high school slut image with perfection.  Macy is
charming as the father, layering a character who could have been very
one-dimensional (the final scene in the courtroom is moving only because
of him).  Allen is powerful as Betty; her development from housewife to
the independent woman is one of the more affecting of the film's
stories.  Jeff Daniels, playing a soda shop owner who discovers that he
loves to paint, also gives a fine performance.</P>
<P>There's really only one problem with Pleasantville, and it's a broad
problem that affects nearly every aspect of the picture:  it really
doesn't know what it's about.  It's theme is simple enough -- don't hold
in your passions, and your life will be better.  But Ross' metaphors
aren't solid; as much as I like the color idea, it really doesn't make a
lot of sense:  why certain people "get their color" and why others don't
is never made perfectly clear.  And then there are little details that
irritated me (how do the residents know the colors by name if they've
never seen them?).</P>
<P>Blazing with optimism, the film nearly blinds itself in the final
hour.  The first half, which focuses on the kids' clash with their new
surroundings, is often hilarious (the basketball scene is simply
ingenious).  But when feelings of racism arise, and people are
discriminated against for being "colored," the film extends beyond the
level of seriousness that its premise permits.  Let's face it: 
Pleasantville is a fantasy that revolves around a lot of things that
could never happen.  And while it's fine to do fantasy and have serious
themes, Ross takes his material far too seriously in the final half
hour.  Then there's the courtroom scene, which features the late J.T.
Walsh as the Rush Limbaugh-type mayor persecuting David for bringing
color to their serene world.  This scene is totally unnecessary, and
simply wipes away any subtlety that the film had managed to gather until
that point.</P>
<P>And there's one last detail:  the world of Pleasantville has never
really existed.  People have never been as naive or inexperienced as
they are in this film.  I like the theme -- I think it's a good idea to
embrace your passions.  But, when you think about the film as a whole --
the color stuff, the race issues, even the vague poke at the television
industry -- it seems the picture doesn't really know what it's saying,
and covers it up with simplistic claims like "be true to yourself."  </P>
<P>But I can't ignore Pleasantville's strength:  it would be a crime to
shun a feel-good movie as ambitious as this one.  The flaws are there,
and they're significant, but they don't erase the heart and hopefulness
of Ross' picture.  Finally, a film that says there might be something
worth living for.   </P>
