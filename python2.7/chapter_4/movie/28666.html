<PRE>"State and Main" </PRE>
<P>Hollywood invades small town New England when a film production company, 
led by producer Walt Price (William H. Macy), comes to Waterford, Vermont 
to shoot the film, "The Old Mill." The problem is the town's old mill 
burned to the ground three decades ago and that's just the beginning of the 
troubles in a movie about making a movie, David Mamet's "State and Main." </P>
<P>Playwright/screenwriter/director Mamet has created celebrated and 
controversial tales from "Glengarry Glen Ross" to "Oleana" to "The Winslow 
Boy." Mamet, the writer, has produced an eclectic body of work that often 
delves deeply into the human psyche. With "State and Main," the helmer 
takes on a fast paced comedy in a movie about making a movie in small town 
America. In this one, though, the talented Mamet stumbles. </P>
<P>When the production team for "The Old Mill" lays siege to the unsuspecting 
Vermont town, it is with a checkered past. A scandal forced the entire 
production crew to be turned out of their previous location in a New 
Hampshire town because of a propensity for young girls by the film's star, 
Bob Barringer (Alec Baldwin). Now, ensconced in their new location, with 
only days to go before principal photography starts and no budget left, 
Walt Price has multiple disasters to contend with. As mentioned before, the 
mill that is the focal point of "The Old Mill" is gone. Barringer's 
co-star, Claire Wellesley (Sarah Jessica Parker), refuses to do her 
contracted nude scene unless she gets a bunch more money. The film's 
lunatic cinematographer wants to destroy a stained glass landmark so he can 
"get the shot." Finally, playwright turned screenwriter Joseph Turner White 
(Philip Seymour Hoffman) is suffering from a monumental case of writer's 
block. </P>
<P>And these are just some of the problems that must be faced. White falls for 
the pretty fiancée of a local politician while struggling with his changing 
career. Bob Barringer gets in trouble, again, with a local teen girl (Julia 
Stiles), forcing a cover-up to avoid getting everyone tossed out of town. 
And, a replacement still has to be found for the damned Old Mill! </P>
<P>All of this is fun stuff from the pen of a talented writer and it probably 
looked really good on paper. Especially with the large, talented ensemble 
cast available to breathe life into their characters. Unfortunately, the 
execution of these amusing ideas falls flat with too much going on with too 
many characters. There is also a problem with who is the "bad guy" here. Is 
it the intrusive strangers from Hollywood? Or, is it the town folk who do 
everything they can to take advantage of the bucks that the production crew 
brings to thew town? As the lines of definition blur between the outsiders 
and the residents, the people of Waterford take on the same greedy air as 
the folks from Tinseltown. </P>
<P>The lack of distinction between the outsiders and insiders is complicated 
by the choice of some of the principle actors. Philip Seymour Hoffman has 
impressed me, considerably, in his past performances - see him as Freddie 
in "The Talented Mr. Ripley" as a marvelous example of his acting ability. 
But, as the sensitive, angst-ridden, romantic figure? It is just not the 
Hoffman's cup of tea. Mamet seems to be using the actor as his own alter 
ego in the film. Sarah Jessica Parker, as the movie star to whom modesty 
has just become an issue in her career, is little more than a pampered 
prima donna that usually gets her way. Alec Baldwin simply has nowhere to 
take his self-center matinee idol. </P>
<P>There are some good roles coming out of "State and Main," though. William 
H. Macy, one of the finest character actors in the business, plays the 
cocky producer to perfection. He, and David Paymer as the film's 
high-powered "money man," put a good spin on portraying filmmakers used to 
having their way on location. They plead, threaten and pout to get their 
ways with their crew and the town's people. Their perfs only make up a 
portion of the movie and it's not enough. </P>
<P>Tech credits are adequate, but nothing remarkable. </P>
<P>I have come to look forward to most of David Mamet's films and, usually, am 
not disappointed. There are exceptions, though, and "State and Main" is 
one. For a movie about making a movie, there isn't enough movie-making 
stuff to the story. I give it a C. </P>
