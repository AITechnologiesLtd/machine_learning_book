<PRE>YOU CAN COUNT ON ME
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>So how many really good movies can you name about brother-sister 
relationships?  And what if you limit your list to only those about 
adult siblings?  Don't be surprised if your list is empty, or at least 
close to it.  In the future, any such list will have to start with YOU 
CAN COUNT ON ME, the winner for Best Picture and Best Screenplay at this 
year's Sundance Film Festival.  Written and directed by Ken Lonergan 
(the writer of last year's hit comedy ANALYZE THIS), YOU CAN COUNT ON ME 
is a rich and witty drama whose centerpiece is a sibling relationship.</P>
<P>Laura Linney (Truman's wife in THE TRUMAN SHOW) stars as the sister, 
Sammy.  Sammy tries to be a level-headed mother to her 8-year-old, Rudy 
(Rory Culkin).  Her ex is a permanently AWOL father to Rudy, who has 
never seen Rudy Senior.  Her brother, Terry (Mark Ruffalo), has come for 
a visit.  In a poignant restaurant scene, she shows that she is there 
for him, but he is there for money.  It momentarily breaks her heart.</P>
<P>But this isn't one of those dysfunctional families movies, even if their 
relationship does have its difficult moments.  This is a story of love, 
not hate.  The chemistry between them and between Terry and Rudy is 
remarkable and genuine.</P>
<P>Sammy has had a modestly successful life, but Terry is a screw-up, 
although he claims, as if he doesn't believe it, that "I'm not the kind 
of guy that everyone says I am."   They grew up in the small backwoods 
town of Scottsville, where everyone knows everyone else.  It is a "dull, 
narrow town, full of dull, narrow people," Terry tells Rudy in a long 
put-down of Scottsville.  "What are you talking about," Rudy asks him 
with soulful, confused eyes.  "I have no idea," Terry confesses in a bit 
of self-reflection.</P>
<P>Their parents died in a car accident when Sammy and Terry were young.  
In a brief prologue, we witness the accident almost matter-of-factly.  
The beauty of the delicate script is the way tragedy is consistently 
downplayed and that key incidents are merely sketched out.  The writer 
allows us to use our imagination to fill in the details.  And the 
direction is done with great subtly and finesse so that there isn't an 
overacted or schmaltzy moment in the production.  The result is a 
picture so authentic that it has the audience hitting the ground 
running.  Only a few minutes into it, and we feel like we've known and 
cared about these people all of our lives.</P>
<P>Sammy laments, "I wish Mom was here," when talking to her brother about 
how to handle a troublesome issue.  Anyone whose mother has died 
certainly thinks this and often.  Linney delivers this line with 
heart-felt but restrained emotions, making it feel as genuine as if she 
were talking about her own dead mother.</P>
<P>Another part of the plot concerns Brian (Matthew Broderick, ELECTION), 
Sammy's new manager at the bank.  His is an anal-retentive type, who 
admits that "I like paperwork."  He wants daily time cards and a 
conservative color palette for the bank's PC displays.  Brian and Sammy 
are a combustible mix, but rather than getting fired, as it looks like 
she is destined to be, Sammy ends up sharing fireworks in bed with her 
boss instead.  This affair shocks and delights her at the same time.  In 
Linney's best bit of acting, she lets out a small series of nervous, 
joyful laughs in the car as she sits there by herself after their first 
fling.  (The writer gives us a few glimpses into what may or may not be 
Brian's unhappy married life with his pregnant wife.)</P>
<P>Besides writing and directing, Lonergan also plays the part of Sammy's 
laid back priest, the funniest character in the movie.  She wants him to 
tell her that she will burn in the flames of eternal damnation for her 
sins, but he has a more flexible moral code, which allows for continual 
redemption.</P>
<P>Linney, with some of the spunk that Holly Hunter demonstrated in 
BROADCAST NEWS, delivers a delicately nuanced and wonderfully appealing 
performance that deserves to be remembered at Oscar time.  But you want 
to see this movie now and not wait until the nominations come out to 
remind you of the great movies that you missed.</P>
<P>YOU CAN COUNT ON ME runs 1:49.  It is rated R for language, some drug 
use and a scene of sexuality and would be acceptable for most teenagers.</P>
