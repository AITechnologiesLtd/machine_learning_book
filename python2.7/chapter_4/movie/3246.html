<P>     There's one fundamental question that has to be asked about films
like BAD COMPANY: is the script one step ahead of the audience, or is
it the other way around?  In large part, the answer determines whether
suspense mysteries are pulse-pounding or pedantic.  In this case, it's
something of a mixed bag.  For, while director Damian Harris shows
aptitude with a kind of picture that's oh-so-easy to mess up, his film
occasionally moves too slowly to sustain tension.  There are times when
guessing what's around the corner becomes secondary to how long it
actually takes to make the turn.</P>
<P>     With one foot in the noir camp and the other in the modern-day
world of covert operations, BAD COMPANY builds its cleverly-layered
plot around two central characters.  The first, Nelson Crowe (Laurence
Fishburne) is an ex-CIA agent with a healthy sexual appetite, an IQ of
141, and a personality that's slightly paranoid.  The other, Margaret
Wells (Ellen Barkin), aka the "Snow Queen", is Nelson's kind of
woman--equally hard and soft, and a graduate from the same femme fatale
class as last seductress Linda Fiorentino.</P>
<P>     Invoking Fiorentino's name immediately calls to mind John Dahl,
and BAD COMPANY is his sort of movie.  Although lacking the full
atmospheric richness of, say, a RED ROCK WEST, the film nevertheless
possesses a stylish appeal.  Nasty characters always make for delicious
viewing, especially when they attempt to outplot each other.  The main
difference between Dahl and Harris, however, is that while the former
has his actors approach their roles with tongues planted in cheek,
Fishburne and Barkin play it straight--sometimes too straight.</P>
<P>     As is explained in a terse introductory section, Nelson was riffed
from the CIA after $50,000 in gold vanished while in his care.  With
his field of job options limited, Nelson applies to an outfit called
the "Tool Shed", a group of skilled ex-agents who use bribery and
blackmail to further the goals of their wealthy clients.  The Shed is
run by Vic Grimes (Frank Langella), a hard-nosed cynic with a passion
for fishing, and Margaret Wells.  Together, the two hire Nelson and,
after a quick baptism involving a video camera and a revealing tape,
he's given his first assignment:  corrupt a superior court judge (David
Ogden Stiers).</P>
<P>     Despite its share of delectable moments, BAD COMPANY is far from
the perfect double-cross thriller.  Borrowing heavily from dozens of
previous entries, this movie stirs the mix to arrive at something that
alternates between playfully fresh and poorly-paced.  BAD COMPANY
frequently sacrifices character development for plot twists, but that's
arguably the right choice--force of personality, as embodied by
Fishburne and Barkin, is often sufficient.  Certainly, film noir
doesn't appeal to everyone, but for those that enjoy this sort of
darkly convoluted plot, BAD COMPANY isn't as unpleasant as its title
might suggest.</P>
