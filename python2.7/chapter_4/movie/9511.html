<PRE>FANTASIA (1940)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Directors: James Algar, Samuel Armstrong, Ford Beebe, Norman Ferguson,
Jim Handley, T. Hee, Wilfred Jackson, Hamilton Luske, Bill Roberts, and
Ben Sharpsteen
Writers: (look at this list of Directors.  The list for writers is 10
times longer, and I'm not going to write them all out for obvious
reasons, sorry)
Starring: Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra, Walt Disney
(voice)</P>
<P>Disney films are famous (or infamous) for their Utopian presentation of
the world through most of their movies.  They present a
bright-as-the-sun angle to the world, filled with a bit of melodrama,
and always ending with happily, even if that means altering the story of
their source.  They promise a world that's always quenched of
evil-doers, and ends with a little song and a bunch of smiles.  And
that's what's so cool about "Fantasia."</P>
<P>"Fantasia" presents a wide oeuvre of short little animated films by
Disney, all silent, and all set to pieces of classical music, and not
always the bright, cheery, sun-shiny promises of perfection that Disney
"masterpieces" are known for.  The music is done by the famous
Philadelphia Orchestra, who are conducted by the even-more-famous
Leopold Stokowski, who show up between pieces, sometimes actually doing
other stuff than playing (one time Leo shakes hands with Mickey Mouse). 
But this isn't really the great part (seems too PBS-y to me).  The
cartoons are fascinating little vignettes, all unique, and each one
interesting and hypnotic.  Well, most of them are.</P>
<P>"Fantasia" starts off kind of on a down-note with a rather boring
cartoon for Bach's "Tocatta and Fugue in D minor" (the music made famous
in the original version of "Phantom of the Opera").  Nothing much
happens in it, and it lasts a good 10 minutes.  Yes, it goes by faster
than it probably usually would, but it's still not up to par with the
other ones.</P>
<P>But in the second little film, "Fantasia" takes off and never really
comes down.  The second film does a little adaptation of Tchaikovsky's
"Nutcracker Suite," but with the brilliant idea of not having to do
anything with the Nutcracker, but rather on mother nature.  With the six
different movements they chose from the suite, we get a lot of little
fairies running around, mushrooms and flowers dancing, a goldfish
dancing like an arabian wife, and even a bunch of little flowers
spinning on the water.  Although having nothing to do with the suite, it
makes up for that lacking by making each of the parts of the little
vignette unique, humorful, and fascinating.</P>
<P>The third one seems like it's just the oligatory use of Mickey Mouse's
fame.  But what results is a classic story set to the music of Paul
Dukas's "The Sorcerer Apprentice," and dealing with exactly that.  In
it, Mickey is, well, a sorcerer's apprentice, who takes the sorcerer's
hat and begins playing around with magic when the guy leaves for a bit. 
He ends up creating one broom to carry water for him (which is his job),
but accidentally turns it into thousands of brooms, all carrying water,
and then there's a bit of a mishap.  It's wonderfully done, with a great
silent job by Mickey (seriosuly, he's much better without that annoying
voice of his).</P>
<P>The best of the vignettes takes place following the Mickey one.  Set to
Stravinsky's "Rite of the Spring," it deals with the beginning of earth,
and up to the death of the dinosaurs and the reconstruction of earth
following.  Each of Stravinsky's long piece is set perfectly, sometimes
erupting with violence, and then shifting to a more serene setting.  In
it, we get to see many different dinosaurs, the great scene where the
Tyranosaurus Rex shows up out of nowhere and wreaks havoc, and the sad
demise of the dinosaurs in a proposed idea by Disney that there was just
a lot of heat and all vegetation died (which doesn't explain why the
T-Rex wasn't just eating everyone else till there was no one else
left).  But anyway, this is the best part of the film despite this
little trip-up in the dinosaur-death-propoganda.</P>
<P>There's a bit of a break between these two little Acts (the film's 2
hours long, there had to be a little intermission), and we get to see a
little pointless thing about a sound wave which makes, you guessed it,
sound.  Not great or anything, but the film picks up again.</P>
<P>The fifth little film is set to Beethoven's "Pastoral Symphony," which
ends up dealing with ancient and mythological Greece in three movements
from the Symphony.  There's a bit about unicorns, another one about
centaurs falling in love with the help of little cupids, and one about a
big party that is crashed by Zeus, who was in one of his PMS/lightning
throwing moods at the time.  It's great to see it and all, and it gets
most of the mythology right (a biggie after seeing what they did to
Greece in "Hercules"...oh, I mean "Jercules" - besides, it has better
music).</P>
<P>The sixth film is a really, really silly litle vignette about elephants
and alligators (great pairing there), which is set to the very familiar
"Dance of the Hours" by Amilcare Ponchielli (you'll recognize it when
you hear it).  There's a lot elephants pretending they're ballet
students, and there's a lot of weird stuff with alligators, and it
really doesn't mean anything, but who cares: it's fun.</P>
<P>The seventh and final one, and the second best one, deals with the
procession from dark to light, from death to hell to heaven, and from
night to morning.  In other words, it shows the devil fooling around,
then showing everyone he screwed with going to heaven.  The first part
is set to the ominous piece "Night on Bald Mountain" by Modest
Mussorgsky, which deals with him looking fantastic, and emerging from
the top of a mountain, then preying upon all the souls in a little
town.  This fantastic little bit is then interrupted by chimes and a lot
of light from above, where the souls march into heaven set to Franz
Schubert's beautiful "Ave Maria."  And thus ends the film.</P>
<P>"Fantasia" bombed when it opened, and I suppose believably.  It's not
the typical Disney fare.  There's no real point to it, other than to
include a lot of great little animated films set to awesome music.  And
that's what makes it one of Disney's best, if not it's best
cinematically.  There doens't always have to be a great happy ending.  I
mean, even in the "Sorcerer's Apprentice," it ends with Mickey getting
kicked in the ass.  And at the end of "The Rite of the Spring," all the
dinosaurs die miserably.  And the artistry is better than usual Disney. 
I don't know why, but the visuals look even more beautiful than they
usually do.</P>
<P>This film proves that you can find escapist Disney, meaning you don't
always get the Disney formula of happy characters, bad villains, and a
bright ending, filled with hokey and hummable tunes, and, well, having a
coherent storyline which goes from point A to point B.  I usually don't
like Disney films because of this (and well the pious fact that they
insist on every film being a "masterpiece," when only an elite few of
them are even better than "good"), but "Fantasia" breaks all the rules,
suceeds, and even entertains.  So, anyway, it's just far superior than
most of the Dinsey flicks.</P>
