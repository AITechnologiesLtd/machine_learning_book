<P>There was a time when it was chic and trendy to dismiss the work of Neil
Simon. I hope that this particular snobbery exists no longer. The man's
output is prodigious, his talent is superior, and his duds are minimal. At
their best, movies scripted by Simon have resulted in great comedies or
mixed-genre films. At their non-best, among the least well received -- even
though it does have its partisans--- is The Out-of-Towners (1970) directed
by Arthur Hiller.</P>
<P>Neil Simon's script is his most unpleasant.  Ohio executive Jack Lemmon and
wife Sandy Dennis go on a business trip to New York. Everything goes badly
from the start and escalates without respite. Most of these frustrations,
taken singly or in smaller installments, are all too familiar -- but here
they are so mercilessly and artificially piled up that they reach a level
of cruelty. And a major flaw is that the couple is dislikable, with Lemmon
a  grating idiot, from the opening scene on. In this black humor however
are some quite entertaining parts which would make me give the picture a
sadomasochistic grade of  C.</P>
<P>Still, I see no reason for a remake of this item, especially the way it is
handled by heavy-handed direction and a bad script that's not Simon's but
based on the old Simon scenario. All my comments on the 1970 opus apply to
the 1999 edition, except that now the couple is no longer dislikable. They
are merely indifferent and without personality.</P>
<P>This time, the Ohioans George and Gwen Kellerman have been more WASPishly
rebaptized Henry and Nancy Clark, married for 27 years. Their daughter has
gone East, to school then to miscellaneous problems. The lachrymose parents
are putting son Alan on the plane to Europe. The nest is empty. Henry, an
adman, is about to leave for a job interview in New York City, but what he
hasn't told Nancy is that he's been fired from his present position.</P>
<P>He boards his plane... and guess who comes in minutes later? Yes, Nancy,
who's decided to come along and who makes a most idiotic appearance. (I'll
spare you details). This is the start of an odyssey for the Clarks. The
plane has to land in Boston, their luggage is lost, they miss the train to
NYC, hire a talking car (sic), mess up directions, crash into a fish
market. Next, they get robbed in the Big Apple. The misadventures of the
moneyless and hungry Clarks hit an endless series of strident lows which
include suspicious people, an S & M hooker, a ferocious Rottweiler, a
sex-therapy meeting in a church, a ride in a holdup getaway taxi, a night
spent alfresco in Central Park where Henry gets booked by cops for indecent
exposure, and more and more. And yet more.</P>
<P>There is a sort of anchoring point. It is the hotel where the reservation
were made. It is lorded over by Manager John Cleese, fawning, flattering,
priggish, imperial, bossy, haughty, and unbearably rude once he finds out
that Henry's hidden emergency credit card has been maxed out (by their
daughter). The hotel is revisited later in ways impossible to sum up.</P>
<P>It's not funny. Viewers who travel a lot could identify with some of the
journey's mishaps  but their outrageous accumulation here is neither
surreal (as in a Laurel and Hardy movie) nor real. If you got involved in
this film and its protagonists you might factually feel pain -- which, in
any case is a no-no in farces where you have to keep your distance and
laugh in the knowledge that all this couldn't really be. But  this movie
loses you on both sides. You don't get involved and you don't get amused.
Just bored by this incessant overkill.</P>
<P>Much of this is tasteless, crude and coarse. When the couple sneaks into
the hotel bar so as to fill up on freebie snacks, and Goldie Hawn is
approached by a horny traveler, the way she plays along is unlikely, tacky
and unpleasant, as it what follows.</P>
<P>But I'll say this much for Goldie. She's still cute. Never a classic
looker, she's wondrously  youthful at  54, exactly the same age as Steve
Martin's. Her secret is between her and her doctors, but the result is
amazing. She was, by the way, in Seems Like Old Times, another Simon movie,
while Martin starred in The Lonely Guy, also directed by Hiller, the
original The Out-of-Towners helmer.</P>
<P>The remake is as mechanical as can be. Its continuity is a mess. One
example. After 24 hours of catastrophes, frustrations, and their longest
night ever, the couple should by all rights smell to high heaven, look
unkempt, filthy, dishevelled. Not so, especially Goldie who is still nicely
coifed and in pressed clothes.</P>
<P>For many viewers critical of the picture, the saving grace will be John
Cleese as Mr. Meursault. Not for me. The overkill extends to his character
which is overloaded, including the fact that Cleese is a
crypto-transvestite, another mechanical gimmick to allow Goldie to
blackmail him. Cleese is patterned, with blinding obviousness, after his
Basil Fawlty  in the superb British TV series Fawlty Towers. But that was
then (1975-79) and this now.  On television he was the spoof of an
irascible hotel owner. Here he too is on automatic drive as he spoofs a
spoof, something that almost never works.</P>
<P>The few  onscreen minutes, at the start, of newcomer Oliver Hudson (as Alan
Clark, the son) are nice and show promise.</P>
