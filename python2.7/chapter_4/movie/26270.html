<PRE>REINDEER GAMES (2000)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: D-</PRE>
<PRE>Director: John Frankenheimer</PRE>
<PRE>Screenplay: Ehren Kruger</PRE>
<P>Starring: Ben Affleck, Charlize Theron, Gary Sinise, James Frain, Donal 
Logue, Clarence Williams, Dennis Farina, Danny Trejo</P>
<P>REINDEER GAMES is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by Ehren 
Kruger (SCREAM 3 and ARLINGTON RD are the others, each derivative in their 
own special way). The guy can't seem to write believable dialogue (Sample 
from REINDEER GAMES: "Rule #1: Never put a car thief behind the wheel"), 
create multi-faceted characters, or even engineer coherent plots but he sure 
knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns (no matter if each 
one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely). His screenplay for 
REINDEER GAMES turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching 
the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight. 
I can just envision Kruger laughing behind his keyboard, "Oh you thought my 
movie was gonna go here, f*ck you jack ass, take that twist, decipher this 
mother f*cker!" It's almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling 
out money to see his stupid movie. And why the hell would anyone want to 
invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for 
no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is? Auteur 
theory be damned; it's Kruger's "style", not the director's that winds up on 
screen.
Kruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut "sometimes less 
is more". And his numerous twists can't even claim to be originals; ARLINGTON 
RD's ending is a direct steal from the much better Alan J. Pakula thriller 
THE PARALLAX VIEW, and in REINDEER GAMES we get this ol' gem; Character 
incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn't know (pronouns used 
to protect the gender of the "character"...grammar be damned). "How did you 
know that?" the stunned protagonist asks, suddenly realizing that the 
character was in on the whole thing all along. . .</P>
<P>Since twist endings are currently so in vogue, and seeing as how Kruger's 
screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending, I guess 
it's no wonder why he works so frequently. He's quickly becoming MIRAMAX's 
Mickey Mouse; the company has already signed him to work on several of their 
upcoming projects. This is appropriate considering that MIRAMAX (which used 
to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films) has 
quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports (LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL) 
and Freddie Prinze Jr. vehicles. Their company's current logo could be "We 
ride the trends".</P>
<P>REINDEER GAMES stars Ben Affleck as Rudy, a supposedly hardened criminal 
spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing 
atop his head. Although Affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to 
insinuate bad assness, he plays the role like Steve Guttenberg preciously 
mugging through a POLICE ACADEMY flick. Affleck is such a puppy dog that it's 
impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without 
becoming nearly everyone's bitch.</P>
<P>The role itself is so badly written (the character only grows balls when the 
plot calls for it), the twists so outrageous, and the directing so self 
consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as I can recall 
a recent "serious" movie getting. It may have been wiser had the film makers 
simply went all the way in that direction, casting Jerry Seinfeld as the 
hardened criminal and Howard Stern as the sniveling bad guy (who's played 
here by Gary Sinise in yet another over the top villain performance)</P>
<P>James Frain is Nick, Rudy's cellmate, a manslaughterer who's found a pen pal 
in the gorgeous Ashley Mason (Charlize Theron). Ashley is a prison groupie 
who sends Nick many cheesecake photos of her though she's never seen one 
picture of him. Which works out fine since the character is killed in a 
near-riot, and Rudy (who was to be paroled on the same day as Nick) takes his 
place, which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between Ashley and 
Rudy (so frenzied it kinda looks like rape) and a surprise visit from 
Ashley's brother, Gabriel (Gary Sinise), who waltzes into their shabby hotel 
room flanked by his thuggish co-horts. He plans to rob an Indian Casino on 
Christmas Eve with the assistance of Rudy who he thinks is Nick who, 
according to what he wrote in the letters to Ashley, used to work as a guard 
in the Indian casino. Though by the end, the film pulls the rug out from 
under us so frequently that everything I've described might as well be 
irrelevant.</P>
<P>This is what you can expect should you chose to take this Reindeer on; 
several scenes in which, after catching his prey, the bad guy proceeds to 
stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and 
crack a stupid one-liner. Included: Two (2) scenes of two (2) different bad 
guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him 
(one following the other no less). Though it's an action film, the ending is 
more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered 
character actor after another while 
Affleck looks on, incredulous as the audience.</P>
<P>The flick was directed by John Frankenheimer, a straightforward action 
director who lucked into THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE early in his career, fell 
off the A-list following a string of flops and now, in his old age, is slowly 
climbing his way back up. It would be a success story if he were choosing 
better scripts but his last major film was RONIN (one of those almost but not 
quite movies) which followed THE ISLAND OF DR.MORNEAU (you remember, the one 
with Marlon Brando in mime make-up and a not so flattering moo-moo), and now 
this. He films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which I like 
considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond 
flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brain-zapped MTV audience to 
pick apart. Problem is these action scenes (nearly all failed escapes) serve 
no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to 
remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed 
radio play.</P>
<P>Character problems abound; Rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door 
earnestness and hard edged wiseacre, the latter of which is not (at least at 
this point) something Ben Affleck is capable of pulling off. The former he 
can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while 
those around him growl and swear. But then suddenly Affleck starts growling 
and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a Tarantino 
gangster.</P>
<P>Charlize Theron, an extraordinary talent, is, like Affleck, playing whatever 
part the script requires her to play, whether it be vulnerability at one 
moment, anger at the next. She never has a chance to evince any charm or make 
much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes (Frankenheimer 
has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this.</P>
<P>Gary Sinise has played this role frequently, and here, as in SNAKE EYES, he 
does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol (the guy must 
be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of 
control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more), that it 
becomes more of an annoyance (oh there he goes againâ€¦) than a threat. These 
are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with 
little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its 
audience. </P>
