<PRE>                                CITY OF JOY
                       A film review by Ralph Benner
                        Copyright 1996 Ralph Benner</PRE>
<P>     Dominique Lapierre's THE CITY OF JOY is a dense nonfiction (with
blessedly short chapters) that has the momentum of a novel written as a
collection of portraits of unimaginably joyous survivors of the worst
slums in all of India and probably the world -- those of Calcutta.
Starting out as a depressing travelogue, we quickly come to feel we're
going to know the city more than we might really want -- and come very
dangerously close to reeling in indigenous epigrams and platitudes: "Coal
doesn't change its color when you wash it. What can't be cured must be
endured"; "My memory is like camphor. It evaporates with time"; "Fishes
can't afford to live on bad terms with the crocodiles in the pool." By the
fifth chapter, Lapierre settles down and digs into Calcutta -- "a mirage
city to which in the course of one generation six million starving people
had come in the hope of feeding their families...(a) metropolis situated
at the heart of one of the world's richest yet at the same time most
ill-fated regions, an area of failing or devastating monsoons causing
either drought or biblical floods. This is an area of cyclones and
apocalyptic earthquakes, an area of political exoduses and religious wars
such as no other country's climate or history has perhaps ever
engendered...(one) earthquake in 1937 caused hundreds of thousands of
deaths ...six years later a famine killed three and a half million people
in Bengal alone...in 1965 a cyclone (hit India with the force of) ten
three megaton H-bombs...Calcutta condemn(s) its ten million inhabitants to
living on less than twelve square feet of space per person, while the four
or five million of them who squeeze into its slums have sometimes to make
do with barely three square feet each." You begin to feel you have to be a
masochist to go further, because the descriptions of the living conditions
in Calcutta's largest slum -- Anand Nagar, the City of Joy -- are
tummy-turning: the rot of the tin and cardboard shacks, the hunger, the
lepers, eunuchs and the scorching heat and pestilence match the revulsion
of the residents regularly wading through waste-high excrement that floods
through the slums when the rains come or the sewers get backed up because
of the endless strikes. Albeit upchucky, Lapierre's diary is absorbing and
in some cases you might even re-read passages again and again out of total
disbelief: your mind wanders in unspeakable directions when you come upon
lepers having sex, and it's indescribable your feelings when one leper
gives birth. (There are no precise numbers but it's estimated that India
has as many as five millions lepers.) Lapierre writes about the dwellers
of the City of Joy: "No amount of wretchedness, not even utter destitution
on a piece of pavement in Calcutta, could alter that they are the world's
cleanest people." And they do it with less than a pint of water for each
daily public bath.</P>
<P>     If you're a sinner like moi, you'll be absolved of all sins when
you finish the first half, and if you make it all the way through -- this
should be easy to do because you'll be hooked by then -- you're likely
going to be a candidate for sainthood. While there's mention of and a bit
of history about Mother Teresa, this isn't her story. It's about a real
Polish Catholic priest and (during the last third of the book) a real
American Jewish doctor who join forces to provide, with scant financial
resources, whatever medicinal comfort is feasible. It can't come as any
surprise to the reader that though their work is needed, admired and
honored, it is within these two outsiders that the City of Joy has its
ironic impact. (And it has impacted readers around the world: by October,
1986, Lapierre had received over 40,000 letters, many of them containing
donations, so moved were they by the emotionally wrenching stories. The
author has also donated one half of his royalties to Anand Nagar's
inhabitants.) Reading some copy about the movie version, the feature
writers are describing the book as "sentimental" but it's no such thing:
though immersed in awesome poverty, this book isn't schmaltzy
fictionalized pap -- it doesn't cheapen or romanticize or distort the
residents of the City of Joy. </P>
<P>            I wish I could say the movie doesn't, either, but I can't:
director Roland Joffe and screenwriter Mark Medoff have indeed cheapened
the story in every way and worst of all is they have taken the good
American doctor -- played by Patrick Swayze -- and turned him into an
example of the pretensions of the "art" of dramatic writing right out of
Lajos Egri's college text. They've given him a false crisis, made his
character diametrically the opposite of what he is in Lapierre's book in
order put him into repeated conflicts that Loeb only rarely or never
encounters, made him inexplicably suicidal, and gave him a resolution
that, evidently satisfying to the members of the audience who don't know
how Lapierre ends his story, is simply hackneyed. The next worse things
they've done: they eliminated entirely the priest -- it's now Pauline
Collins as Sister (Saint) Joan -- and have created a super vicious slum
Mafiosi, played by Art Malik. Anyone who reads the book can see it as a
ready-made screenplay and all an honest director needs is a cast, a
Steadicam and a story editor who has respect for the material. There are
more scenes of real conflict, heartbreaking drama, spiritual wonderment
and impossible-to-believe-but-true vignettes in the book than a moviemaker
could ever hope to use -- for example, the young doctor amputating without
anesthesia a leprous arm and watching "a mangy dog carrying it off in its
mouth"  -- but why Joffe and Medoff had to go dreaming up new ones is
beyond the pale. In the book -- and his first appearance comes about half
way through and becomes focal only in the last third -- Miamian Max Loeb,
who's just about to get his medical degree from Tulane, has read all about
the selfless priest of Calcutta and decides, because he needs "a change of
air, to be of service," to join him. In the very first scenes of the
movie, he's Max Lowe -- changed to a less Jewish-sounding name because the
movie was being filmed during the Gulf War and there were constant
anti-American and anti-Israeli protests -- and already an established
doctor from Houston who abruptly decides to abandon his profession because
he lost a child-patient on the operating room table. (What drives him to
Calcutta specifically is never adequately explained except by the
all-purpose search for "enlightenment.") In the book Loeb, on his first
day in the slums, helps deliver a breeched baby to a leper couple. In the
movie, Lowe checks into a seedy hotel, entertains a prostie and is set up
to get drunk, beaten and robbed by local Mafia terrorizer Malik. And this
movie Max sort of stumbles onto the slums. (He eventually gets to that
leper's baby, though.) </P>
<P>     Objecting to what Joffe has done to Lapierre's book might not have
been necessary had he at least been faithful to the atmospherics of the
slums even half way right. At first glance the faked City of Joy,
photographed approximating the color of diluted urine, appears wretched
and diseased, and when we see the blackened open trench that snakes its
way through the slums, we expect to get a dose of biological reality --
that is, shown how the dwellers poop. As we get into the book, we wait for
Lapierre to account for the disposal methods, since there are no bathrooms
as Westerners acknowledge the meaning. He doesn't disappoint; as horrific
and appearing-to-be lacking of dignity as it might seem, it's quite the
reverse, and a queer sense of admiration occurs within the reader when the
Polish priest says, "Before reaching the public conveniences, I had to
cross a veritable lake of excrement. This additional trial was a courtesy
of the cesspool emptiers, who had been on strike for five months. The
stench was so foul that I no longer knew which was the more unbearable:
the smell or the sight. That people could actually remain good humored in
the middle of so much abjection seemed quite sublime to me. They laughed
and joked -- especially the children who somehow brought the freshness and
gaiety of their games into that cesspool. I came back from that escapade
as groggy as a boxer knocked out in the first round." (And they don't use
any form of toilet paper -- only a tinful of water to wash up afterwards.)
Joffe not only avoids what has to be running through the minds of viewers
when they see that sewer, and avoids the common overspills of the sewer
into the homes, he also avoids the bathing practices which are even more
of a marvel. (The women are able to fully clean themselves while still in
their saris.) Part of the omission most likely has to do with the
persistent protests that occurred during the filming -- many Indians felt
that Joffe might be robbing residents of their self-respect if all aspects
of life in the City of Joy were documented. But in that Joffe faked his
city and flood, could he not fake the urges or baths elsewhere? And
perhaps do it in longshot? Readers will also note what other elements are
missing: cobras and infestations of rats and bugs; how the people use cow
dung cakes as fuel to cook their food (made ultra spicy because much of it
is rotten); and the ravages of the heat -- so hot that the bare feet of
the horses who pull the rickshaws would stick to the pavement of the
streets and the callous outer skin would peel off and the under skin would
become bloody and infected. </P>
<P>     So what do we get in the movie version? Instead of endemic
cholera, there's frequent Mafia-administered punches into Max's stomach
and a stab into rickshaw puller Hasari (played by Om Puri), who also
suffers from a badly treated case of tuberculosis. When the monsoon
arrives and then the flood, instead of numerous bodies and dead rodents,
dogs and other animals floating through the alley streets of the slum,
there's Max nearly drowning after saving a leper and his baby. In the
book, Max is exasperated by a lack of medical supplies and though he's
often discouraged -- he periodically heads to one of Calcutta's grand
hotels for a little R&R -- he's faithful to Hippocrates; movie Max has to
be goaded into staying true to his oath. (One assumes that because Joffe
and scripter Medoff reversed Loeb at the start, they could redeem
themselves by having movie Max stay indefinitely in Anand Nagar, slyly
one-uping Loeb, who eventually returned to America, though he founded an
organization to supply the slum with medicines and equipment, and makes
regular return visits.) </P>
<P>     Had Joffe only condensed the material, he might have provided
Patrick Swayze with the role he excitedly told Oprah and Larry King had
changed his life. You want to believe his humbleness when he said that
this is his best work so far as an actor, but if he could say this, and
tell us that when he first arrived in Calcutta Joffe sent him directly to
work with Mother Teresa before filming started, and that he's playing a
role of a doctor whose life has been fundamentally changed because of his
experiences in the City of Joy, it's not suspiciously disingenuous, it's a
little more like too sincere star-thumping. He's doing his own advance
work on his still unformulated humanatations. (He even admitted his
emotional discombobulation to King.) If Swayze had played his Max as he's 
promoting himself, he'd have been a sensation, and not coincidentally much
closer to the real Max. It's not Swayze's fault that the part is now about
a stereotypic angry young man, yet given the confines of such, he's far
from bad. In fact, what saves him is his own deportment -- his own sense
of agog; he's at once thrilled and yet disbelieving that he's playing so
life-changing a role. And there's something quite appealing about his
slightly Oriental face, which, perhaps because he fell ill for three weeks
during production, has finally lost its fattiness, and its repellent
grubbiness; in his Bugle Boys and sun-bleached hair, he's warm,
personable. (Even the real kids of Anand Nagar liked him enormously.) If
he can't redeem the awful scenes in which he's mouthing the silly, badly
written bitterness that's supposed to be telling us something about his
character, the fact is no one could (Joffe originally wanted Richard
Dreyfuss; Lapierre wanted Mel Gibson) because Medoff disemboweled the
book's Max, who was skeletal to begin with. (Two scenes from the thirty
minutes cut from the theatrical release include Max's attempted suicide,
which never happens in the book, and a seduction of Sister Joan; in the
book, Max has an Indian sexual outlet as part of his R&R.) Swayze does
affect us during a few of the movie's dramatic wallops, and in one I got
quite flushed with feelings and teary-eyed. The problem is, I can't
remember the exact moment anymore -- it has completely vanished from my
mind. This fleetness is central to Joffe's vamoosed vision; he's made not
a movie version of THE CITY OF JOY but one about The City of Vapors.
Everything that's genuinely moving about the book has been evaporated.</P>
<P>     Joffe is most faithful to the book's rickshaw puller Hasari, who
is the salt of Indian earth. Om Puri's performance is unquestionably the
movie's major asset, though you find yourself losing patience with his
mania for honor. (You could discreetly skim over his virtues in the book
but you're stuck enduring them in the theatre.) Pauline Collins is wasted
as an amalgam of the religious characters that Joffe thought could be
vacated without spiritual loss. (One of the small surprises of the book is
that even in the Anand Nagar Christian Christmas is celebrated.) This may
be, more than anything else, what tells us is so dummy-headed wrong with
the movie. It's maddeningly compromising when no dilution is necessary. So
what if Indians were protesting? When do they not? But you know why Joffe
phonied it up -- he's got one eye on the potentially huge box office of
India. (There's a funny line at the beginning when an Indian woman tells a
young child to keep away from the movie houses -- Indians being among the
world's most avid moviegoers.) What will rankle lovers of the book and
probably enrage fair-minded Indians about the movie THE CITY OF JOY is
that if this is the movie that Joffe really wanted to make, it's even more
insulting to the Indians he placated because it makes so many of them look
like the fools he and Medoff made of themselves.                          </P>
