<P>THE ICE STORM

Wood, Christina Ricci, Tobey Maguire, Adam Hann-Byrd.
   "A rotten fish stinks from the head down."  "Like father, like
son."  "When it rains, it pours."  These are just some of the
proverbs illustrated by Ang Lee in the film which opened the
1997 New York Film Festival, "The Ice Storm."  The
Taiwanese director, who moved to the United States in 1978
and proceeded to dissect social mores of 19th Century
England in "Sense and Sensibility," and explore the
estrangement of a Taipei master chef from his three
daughters in "Eat Drink Man Woman," has again done a
superb job of commenting on family values. This time the
action has shifted to the upper-middle-class America of the
early 1970s, as Lee probes the pathologies which seem to
have seeped down from the Nixon presidency to infect the
lives of Connecticut families of the chief executive's social
class.  Whether Lee is suggesting some parallel between the
corruption of the administration and domestic debauchery, or
is making a statement about the sinfulness stimulated by
suburbia, or perhaps even observing the silliness of the
seventies, is not consequential.  What is notable is that he
spreads out before us a lush banquet of neatly observed
perverse fare in James Schamus's deft adaptation of a recent,
well-received novel by Rick Moody. 
   Why choose 1973 as the time of the action?  This period in
America embodies the culmination of a dramatic experiment
in lifestyles which began perhaps in 1968 with the disruption
of the Democratic National Convention and was characterized
by experimentation with sexual freedom, a display of garish
wearing apparel which includes orange, polyester garments,
the widespread use of mind-altering drugs such as LSD and
cocaine, and an implicit encouragement of people to do their
own thing even if their actions conflicted with responsibilities
to their children.
   Lee focuses on two families, the Hoods and the Carvers. 
Ben Hood (Kevin Kline) and his quietly suffering wife Elena
(Joan Allen) have one 16-year-old son, Paul (Tobey Maguire)
in prep school and daughter Wendy (Christina Ricci) who is
beginning to test her sexual allure on both Carver children. 
Jim Carver (Jamey Sheridan), who is frequently out of town
on business leaves his wife Janey (Sigourney Weaver) free to
dabble in a joyless affair with Ben, and his two boys Mikey
(Elijah Wood) and Sandy (Adam Hann-Byrd) unfettered by
normal parental guidance.  The film spends a good deal of its
113 minutes surveying the activities of the children, which
appear to parallel the sordid ventures of the adults.  In one
unusual scene Wendy dons a Nixon mask and begins some
heavy petting with Mikey, only to be caught by Wendy's dad,
Ben, who happened to be conducting his assignation with
Janey in the upstairs room.  Ben's wife Elena, who suspects
the goings-on of her husband but represses her anger, takes
out her rebellion by shoplifting lipstick from the local
pharmacy.  Her daughter Wendy does likewise.  
   The climactic scene takes place at a wife-swapping party
attended by the well-to-do suburbanites in the area, a
gathering which follows a California custom known as the key
party.  Male celebrants toss their car keys into a bowl and
begin to drink, smoke, and mingle.  Hours later, each woman
dips into the vessel and goes home with the owner of the
keys she has selected.  During the merrymaking an ice storm
has moved into the town of New Canaan, Connecticut, a
blizzard which acts as metaphor to the coldness of family life
among the Hoods, the Carvers, and others of their social
class.  The entire story is narrated by Paul, the Hoods'
sixteen-year-old son.  He has come home for the
Thanksgiving weekend in the desperate hope that he and his
family could spend a joyful and loving weekend together
under the roof of their lavish home and give thanks for the
material and spiritual splendors which life in America affords
for so many. Instead he is confronted by the dissipation of
those who would guide him: a father who hides an inability to
communicate with him with a flurry of fatuous phrases, a
mother too depressed to instill gladness in his heart, and a
sister who reaches out for love by provoking sexual
encounters with a boy in his early teens and the child's
brother.
   Kevin Kline comes across once again as one of America's
great actors, able to coax hilarity from movies like "In and
Out" and "Fierce Creatures" and well-executed pathos from
his current work.  He is supported by a crackerjack group of
young stars like Elijah Wood, Adam Hann-Byrd, Tobey
Maguire and especially Christina Ricci and by a the two
women in his life, Sigourney Weaver as a dragon lady who
combines withering remarks with her sexual calisthenics and
Joan Allen in her signature role of eternally anguished wife.
   "The Ice Storm" proves that a movie can most effectively
and entertainingly study the disintegration of a society without
soap-opera melodramatics or blazingly photographed uproars. 
"The Ice Storm" combines comedy and tragedy productively,
a solid, intelligent, adult drama of people who should have
everything going for them but forsake their good fortune in an
array of excesses.  Rated PG-13.  Running Time: 113
minutes.  (C) 1997 Harvey Karten</P>
