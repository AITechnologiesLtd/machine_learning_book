<P>Charlize Theron's really gotta get out of the city. In 1997's superb 
thriller, "The Devil's Advocate," she starred as a happy-go-lucky wife who 
travelled to New York City with her husband when he got a job at a 
prestigious law firm, and immediately went into a mental downward spiral as 
she began to suspect the people around her were demons. Change the demons to 
aliens, and what you've got is "The Astronaut's Wife," which certainly has 
the talent involved to make the film a suspenseful thriller, but is solely 
sunk on the shoulders of one culprit: writer-director Rand Ravich. Judging 
only on the work he does here, Ravich is akin to writing overblown, at times 
even laughable, dialogue, and wouldn't know subtlety if it came up and 
slapped him on the face. Sorry, folks. What you see is what you get with "The 
Astronaut's Wife," and what I saw wasn't very pretty.</P>
<P>Spencer (Johnny Depp) and Jillian Armacost (Charlize Theron) are a warm, 
loving married couple living in Florida, with Spencer an astronaut, and 
Jillian a second-grade teacher. When Spencer blasts off once again with his 
colleague, Alex Streck (Nick Cassavetes), Jillian is worried as usual, and 
even more so when, the next day, she and her younger sister, Nan (Clea 
DuVall), catch a report on the news that states Spencer and Alex lost contact 
for two minutes after a mysterious blast in space. Jillian and Alex's wife, 
Natalie (Donna Murphy), are relieved to learn by Mission Control that their 
husbands are fine, have been tested for any possible problems, and are 
recovering. Things go back to normal, almost. Although Spencer never talks 
about what happened during the two lost minutes (on the taped recording, 
there was a bunch of screaming, but nothing more), he announces to Jillian 
that his piloting days are over, and that he has been offered a business job 
in NYC. She hesitantly agrees, but before they leave, Alex abruptly suffers a 
stroke and does, while the grieving, paranoid Natalie commits suicide at the 
funeral reception a couple days later. In New York, Jillian quickly gets 
another elementary school teaching job, but she starts to suspect something 
isn't quite right with Spencer, this suspicion further confirmed when an 
official from Florida, Sherman Reese (Joe Morton), comes up to tell her that 
the third noise on the audio wasn't the blast, but another lifeform, and that 
Natalie was pregnant with twins when she killed herself. Oddly, Jillian has 
also just discovered that she is a few months along with twins, so...what 
exactly is inside of her?</P>
<P>"The Astronaut's Wife" isn't the most original of films, but (aside from it 
blatantly ripping off 1968's spooky Roman Polanski classic, "Rosemary's 
Baby," right down to Theron's short blond hair mirroring that on Mia 
Farrow's) it is the type of story that effortlessly could have become an 
enthralling, frightening motion picture on the subject of paranoia, somewhat 
like the recent "Arlington Road," had it been made with a firmer hand. 
Unfortunately, what we get instead are a group of characters who are 
intellectually far slower than the viewer, because if they had realized the 
obvious right from the get-go--that Spencer isn't really Spencer once he 
returns--then the movie would have been over at the 30-minute mark, which 
isn't exactly long enough to add up to a feature film. It really is 
frustrating, however, to watch people who are unmistakably written below 
average intelligence, because you instantly stop believing what is happening 
on-screen, and are forced to realize that, yes, it is only a movie, albeit 
one that holds its audience in contempt.</P>
<P>That's not the worst of the film's problems; I wish it was. Also on the 
screenplay level, the dialogue often is some of the most unintentionally 
laugh-inducing of the whole year. In one supposed-to-be-serious scene, 
Jillian is speaking on the phone with Sherman Reese, who is trying to tell 
her some important information about her husband. What is her reply? "Did you 
ever hear the story of the prince and princess, Mr. Reese?" Jillian asks, as 
she goes on to tell an elaborate fairly tale as tears stream down her face. 
In another sequence, out of the blue, Jillian turns on the radio and does a 
dance around her apartment. And finally, in what should have signalled the 
firing of the costume designer, and did signal a pretty hearty laugh from 
myself, Nan wears a ritzy, colorful feathered coat out to a restaurant, and 
doesn't exactly blend in with the others. Did she win the lottery after 
Spencer and Jillian moved up to the Big Apple?</P>
<P>If the movie is a disaster on the writing and directing levels, at least most 
of the performances are strong and effective, and on a technical level, it is 
often impressive. Amid her embarrassing lines of dialogue she is forced to 
mutter, Theron once again proves to be a presence to be reckoned with. Even 
if her character isn't written at the fully-developed level of the tragic one 
she played in "The Devil's Advocate," give her points for rising above the 
material and successfully acting as a likable protagonist. The 
almost-always-superb Johnny Depp is the weakest acting link. Regardless of 
the palpable air of menace he presents here, his character is a 
one-dimensional villain, and every facial expression he vents off practically 
screams, "I'm the baddie here!" In supporting roles, Donna Murphy has a 
touching final scene, and Joe Morton is sympathetic even if his only reason 
for being is to explain the goings-on. Clea DuVall, as Jillian's sister, Nan, 
gives the best performance in the whole film, and sells each and every one of 
her lines. It's just too bad she also is written to be a nitwit who doesn't 
even bother listening to Jillian's predicament, and the pay-off of her 
character is extremely disappointing.</P>
<P>"The Astronaut's Wife" carries out a bidding war throughout on a pacing 
level. Every time it gets set to take off, it quickly slows down again. If 
this movie was a stick-shift car, I would be fully convinced that the driver 
had never been taught how to use it. On a positive note, there are some nice 
touches sprinkled throughout, including a powerful visual image in one scene 
of Jillian and Spencer sitting in front of a giant U.S. flag that covers the 
whole background. Another scene set in a storage building extracts a fair 
amount of tenseness out of the situation, while the use of the atmospheric 
music score, by George S. Clinton, and fast-motion cinematography, hint at 
how striking the film might have been with someone else at the helm. </P>
<P>Too bad director Ravich betrays his audience even more during the last act. 
Not only has this "twist" been done before, but in the confines of this 
particular film, it is almost maddeningly inadequate and a huge cheat. Forget 
about the time we have invested getting to know and like Theron's character; 
forget about the 109 minutes we've wasted waiting for a gratifying finale; 
oh, and forget about me even considering giving this inept sci-fi/thriller a 
passing grade.</P>
