<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>This solid western was the only film Roy Huggins ever directed, as he went on to
do TV work creating the Maverick series and later on the Rockford Files. </P>
<P>Matt Stewart (Randolph Scott) is a Confederate major in charge of a small
renegade band of stragglers who are told to rob a gold shipment from the Union
forces in Nevada. He gets the gold by ambushing a wagon and kills all the troops
in the process, but learns that the Civil War has been over for a month. The
problem becomes what to do with the gold, as his men want to keep their share
but the major decides that they should bring it back home and let their
disbanded Confederate government decide what to do with it. The problem is in
getting back home alive to establish that they were just soldiers doing their
duty. They fear the Union's reaction, as they don't expect justice if they
surrender. </P>
<P>On their way home the Confederates are spotted by some outlaws intent on getting
the gold who are led by a vicious bandit named Quincey (Teal), but they escape
from them by overtaking a stagecoach. Pursued by the outlaws the men seek safety
in a remote stagecoach way station, where they take as hostages the old-time
stationmaster (Monte Blue) and his daughter (Nolan), who just lost a son in that
ambush, and the passengers--a pretty former Union nurse, Molly (Reed), who is
escorted by a wormy army beef salesman, Lee Kemper (Denning). </P>
<P>The tense film becomes a character study in bravery, cowardice, innocence,
greed, and romance. The gold itself becomes a burden to the soldiers, as they
know the outlaws will kill them whether they give them the gold or not. Their
feelings toward the gold changes so much, that the two Confederates who survive
the gun battle are glad to leave the gold behind so that it can be returned to
the Union. It was as if a weight were lifted from their shoulders. </P>
<P>The Confederates are: Jamie (Jarman Jr.), a young man who has never killed
before; Ralph (Marvin), a thug who is the only Reb resembling the bloodthirsty
outlaws; Cass (Faylen), someone of a good nature who is heroic; Egan (Call), who
is severely wounded and acts gallantly even though he knows he won't make it to
see his family; Matt, who is a strong moral presence and an outstanding leader
trying to find the right thing to do. </P>
<P>The film is made potent be Scott's austere presence and the dry wit that runs
through the script. This results in a very lively film, but also one that is
slightly offbeat. </P>
