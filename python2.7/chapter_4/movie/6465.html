<PRE>                              BULLET IN THE HEAD
                       A film review by Will FitzHugh
                        Copyright 1996 Will FitzHugh</PRE>
<PRE>Bullet In The Head (1990)</PRE>
<P>This is the first John Woo movie I've seen (unless you count 'Hard
Target' which I've tried to erase from my memory) and for the most part
I was impressed.  It starts off weakly, though, as we follow three
friends through some character introduction sequences of sterile gang
fighting (set to the Monkees' 'I'm A Believer'), dancing, and general
goofiness.  I was reminded of some James Dean flick; this is painful
stuff.  One particularly odious scene shows Ben, Frank and Paul racing
bicycles towards the end of a pier in what might be some kind of homage
to the 'chickie run' in 'Rebel Without A Cause'.  Slow motion, overly
dramatic music; I was questioning my decision to go to the movies at
all.</P>
<P>Luckily the action picks up a little as Frank has to borrow money from
a loan shark to pay for Ben's wedding reception and gets bloodied by
some of Ringo's punks while carrying the money.  He and Ben later kill
Ringo and they and Paul hide out in the hills.  They get a job
smuggling penicillin to Saigon and we're off to Vietnam, where the
brutality really kicks in.</P>
<P>They almost immediately run into trouble as they get caught in a riot
caused by an assasination attempt, lose the contraband in an explosion
and get rounded up in the search for the bomber.  These kids are
obviously in over their heads.  After the bomber gets brutally executed
in front of them they go to a nightclub where they get involved with a
Hong Kong singing star who's been kidnapped, addicted to heroin and
forced into prostitution.  She's been enslaved by the gangster they
were supposed to deliver the goods to.  Ben (the married one) falls for
her.  They meet up with another man, Luke, who for some reason trusts
them, and together they set up a raid on the nightclub.  Massive
violence ensues (again set to the Monkees, changing the way I'll listen
to 'I'm A Believer' forever) as they get a chest full of gold and the
girl while wiping out the gangster's army of goons.  Paul begins to
show signs of being a weasel when he urges Luke to drive away with the
gold before Ben and Frank escape.</P>
<P>They escape on a boat but Paul, Frank and Ben are captured by the North
Vietnamese army.  Prison camp.  Forced to shoot Americans.  Torture.
Luke joins Americans in rescue.  Paul and Frank escape with the gold
again but Paul puts a bullet in the wounded Frank's brain when his
screams threaten to give them away.  Paul then shoots Ben while
escaping on a boat with the gold.  All four survive somehow in various
states of mutilation.</P>
<P>Later, Ben and Luke meet up in Saigon and find Frank, a virtual
vegetable, who they put out of his misery.  Ben joins the trail of
refugees to Hong Kong and finds his wife and child.  He also tracks
down Paul, who is now head of a shady corporation devoted to money
laundering.  They fight to the death, eventually ending up by the docks
amid explosions, Paul face down with Frank's skull beside him.  Yow.</P>
<P>It's not too original to compare Woo to Peckinpah.  The action
sequences use lots of angles and slow motion to drag out the violence
to almost unbearable length.  Woo also shows Peckinpah's inability to
realistically portray scenes of normal human interaction; the character
development early in the film is torturous.  But Woo's scenes of the
Vietnam war are chilling compared to American versions.  Never would a
Hollywood director be able to show prisoner killing prisoner.  I hope
his next Hollywood project works out better than... what was the name
of that film?  I can't remember.</P>
