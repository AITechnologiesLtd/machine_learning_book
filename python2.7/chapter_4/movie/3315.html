<PRE>                            THREE COLORS: RED
                       A film review by Leo Bueno
                        Copyright 1995 Leo Bueno</PRE>
<P>     The plot: Young model meets retired judge who enjoys snooping on
other people's private telephone conversation; they become friends,
sort of.</P>
<P>     This is the story of the "relationship" between a young woman and
an older man.  She is a fashion model and a student; he is a
disillusioned older man.  She has a full life; he doesn't.  She is
physically attractive; he walks with a limp.  She wants love; he lost
love.  Her lover is at the end of a telephone line; his lover is a bad
memory.</P>
<P>     No, they don't climb under the sheets, but there is more than
friendship between them.  Maybe this movie is nothing more than a
delicate twist on WHEN HARRY MET SALLY.  Can a man and a woman be just
friends?  Can an old person romantically love a young person?  Why
shouldn't an old weird guy and a naive pretty young girl love each
other?</P>
<P>     If you are expecting lucid insights into this film, forget it;  I
am neither smart nor sophisticated enough to understand its
subtleties.  This often happens to me with European and particularly
French movies (which this one is, in part).  Maybe it was because I did
not see the other two legs of the trilogy, WHITE and BLUE, but having
read other folk's reviews, I am convinced that this movie stood on its
own.  Go see it, even if you didn't see the other two.</P>
<P>     I wondered out loud throughout the film, as I left the movie house,
and for a couple of days thereafter: "What's the point; what's the
point of this movie?"  Nobody got shot, nobody got chased and almost
nobody got laid.  These quintessential elements of Hollywood cinema
were conspicuously absent from this film; no wonder I could not figure
it out.  There was no great moral dilemma to resolve, no difficult
choice to make, no fight to be waged.  Yet, there is something
appealing about this movie.</P>
<P>     The characters seemed like people you have at some point known, or
want to meet.  The acting was superb.  Perhaps because the actors are
unfamiliar, one gets that "it doesn't look like they are acting"
feeling.  Yet, the plot is artificial enough for one to realize this
is, after all, fiction.</P>
<P>     One senses the ingredients for an offbeat romance are present, but
it isn't clear why the director didn't throw them in the pot and light
the fire.  Perhaps this movie is in essence a delicate romantic
cliffhanger; the characters get close to the edge, but don't take the
overt plunge.  You will wonder why.</P>
