<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   In a marketplace where spectacle and thrills-per-minute appears to be
   the measure of audience appeal rather than coherent plotting, Mike
   Judge's live-action feature debut OFFICE SPACE makes for an unusual
   counterpoint: here's a picture which should've disposed with a story
   altogether and concentrated on stringing together bits of incidental
   humour.  Anyone who's had their spirit crushed by a day job should
   relish the film's comically-accurate depiction of the insanity that
   is office work, but after a promising opening, this occupational
   comedy begins to lose its appeal the moment its unwelcome storyline
   spins into motion.</P>
<P>   In not-quite-a-spoof of Fellini's 8 1/2, we're introduced to our
   heroes caught in the middle of a traffic jam.  Immediately
   establishing the aggravation of the typical workday, in rapid
   succession we meet Peter (Ron Livingston) and his anxious sidekicks
   Samir (Ajay Naidu) and Michael Bolton (David Herman), who are
   discontent drones toiling at the nondescript software company Initech
   under the command of the wonderfully insincere manager Bill Lumbergh
   (Gary Cole) and alongside such bizarre eccentrics as the blubbering
   Milton (Stephen Root), who whimpers incessantly and protectively
   guards his stapler with a vigor.  The trio hate their jobs but can't
   afford to lose them, especially with the threat of downsizing on
   their way, and a miserable Peter winds up pleading for solace from
   an "occupational hypnotherapist" -- "Every day since I started
   working, each day has been worse than the last, so when you see me,
   I'm having the worst day of my life ... is there some way you can
   just zonk me out?"  Lo and behold, Peter finds himself the recipient
   of a BULWORTHian transformation from trod-upon office peon to a
   cheerfully candid cubicle jockey who's blissfully unconcerned about
   job security and nonchalantly neglects his duties.</P>
<P>   The skewering of the workplace, while not particularly groundbreaking
   in the wake of the Dilbert phenomenon, is nonetheless effective and
   often very amusing in OFFICE SPACE, and the film's observational
   humour is its strength, keying in on the countless little
   frustrations and irritants regularly encountered at the office which
   amass over time into soul-deadening, sanity-threatening agony.
   Office drudges will undoubtedly feel both a sense of deja vu and
   kinship at the depiction of familiar workplace experiences gleefully
   sent-up (without being overexaggerated for comic effect, which is
   perhaps the frightening part), and what's special is that Mr. Judge
   is able to capture the latent anger festering alongside the
   exasperation and hopelessness without diminishing the humour.
   Whether it's Samir's pent-up rage exploding at regular intervals,
   Milton's meek mumbling "I could ... set the building on fire," or, in
   the piece's showcase sequence, the trashing of a piece of office
   equipment (amusingly shot as a gangsta rap video, complete with
   mock-posturing and swagger), which injects a disturbing note in its
   mirth through the destructive zeal of the participants, it's
   unmistakable that these cubicle prisoners are on the edge between
   frustration and fury, ready to either curl into a whimpering ball or
   lash out.</P>
<P>   The film gets so many of the little details right that at times it
   prompts disturbing flashbacks.  From the serpentine conviviality of
   manager Bill Lumbergh sidling up with a disinterested, drawn-out
   "Yeah ... so ... what's happening?" to the mind-bending chirpiness of
   the secretary inevitably within earshot to the
   where-did-they-find-this-guy of nebbish Milton, the picture adeptly
   captures the absurdity of office life.  (I was hoping that the film
   would fire a zinger at one of my pet peeves -- the manager-type who
   cracks stupendously unfunny jokes and the brown-nosers who dutifully
   guffaw at them as if new heights of hilarity had been reached -- but
   no such luck.)</P>
<P>   It's when the picture attempts to veer off into an actual story that
   interest begins to wane.  A misguided and tired caper plot involving
   our sympathetic trio is introduced, while Peter begins to romance a
   waitress, Joanne (Jennifer Aniston).  The film is all too happy to
   explore blue-collar and white-collar workplace dissatisfaction alike
   -- she's given her own workplace woes: a fast-food manager (played by
   Mr. Judge himself under a pseudonym) who chastises her for not
   wearing enough "flair" on her uniform (she ought've solved this
   dilemma by wearing a button reading "Perfunctory Love Interest") --
   but it's a poor substitute for the occupational inanity of Initech.
   These subplots aren't completely devoid of laughs -- I enjoyed the
   scowling faces and hardcore rap on the soundtrack incongruously
   characterizing the trio of software engineers as bad-asses as they
   executed their lame Machiavellian scheme, and the perfect prop
   placement of a mug in one of Peter's nightmares about Joanne was
   uproarious -- but they're far less engaging and effective than the
   wry observational humour of the film's first half, and ultimately
   steer the picture towards a pat, unsatisfying conclusion.</P>
<P>   It's only logical for filmmakers to cast their comic gaze away from
   the overmined subject matter of dysfunctional families and towards
   the eclectic, disparate personalities which make up a workplace,
   especially given that an unhealthy proportion of one's life is
   consumed on the job.  Among recent features to zing this subject
   matter, OFFICE SPACE is more broad and certainly less subtle than
   Jill Sprecher's CLOCKWATCHERS (perhaps uncoincidentally, another
   picture whose appeal plummeted upon the unfurling of a plot), but
   also far more caustically incisive and enjoyable.  It's far too
   disposable and uneven to be considered an outright success -- the
   Great Workplace Comedy has yet to be made -- but it's a reasonably
   amusing diversion.</P>
