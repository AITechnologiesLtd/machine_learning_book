<PRE>Three Kings (R) ** 1/2
Starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg
Directed by David O. Russell
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>I am constantly talking about hype. You know, the stuff that Hollywood sends
out to all of the people who see a movie. It's called marketing, it's called
milking the heck out of everything the critics say, and it's about aiming
towards an audience and offering them something (supposedly) new. So any film
that might break away from the Hollywood formula (and there are so few of them)
it is immediately loved and cherished...at least it's supposed to be. Three
Kings is a film that made me think, what's wrong with me? They is a majorly
critically acclaimed film and is said to be one of the early Oscar
contenders...but I didn't really like it that much. For all of the gloss and
glamour I was left to wonder what this movie would have done without so much
critical hype.</P>
<P>It's the end of the Gulf War. Treaties have been signed, and troops sent back.
There's an air of celebration in the air. But when Troy Barlow (Wahlberg) finds
a map in a guy's butt that leads to a place that has millions in Kuwait gold,
and he shows the map to Archie Gates (Clooney) who wants to retire in style,
the war isn't over for any of them. Teamed up with Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) and
dim-witted Conrad Vig (Spike Jonze) they set out to recover the gold and use it
for their own purposes. </P>
<P>But when they break into a bunker where the gold is, their consciences catch up
with them. Iraqi troops come in and slaughter most of the people, they also
begin to attack the Americans. The group decides to help all of the people they
can, get then out of Iraq, and help them cross the Iranian border so that they
can be free of Sadaam. But getting there won't be easy.</P>
<P>Another movie (American Beauty being the other) that is a depressing Oscar
contender. I think that the cinematography and art direction both deserve
Oscars. But as for the rest of this edgy film, (perhaps a screenplay nod) I
didn't see any other big wins. Sure the way the film was shot was awesome and
totally cool (OK, I know those aren't the best descriptive words) but no one
stood out to me as being Academy material. The film does however paint a
portrait of what is wrong with war, and why we shouldn't have any more wars
because of all the pain and suffering people endure. While some people may say
that this film is too violent, I think that almost every scene of violence was
there for a reason. If we could just get to the root of hate, the world would
be a better place. So if your looking for an interesting look into the Gulf War
(I recomend you refresh yourself on what happened by looking it up on the
Internet before you go) Three Kings is the one, but for me, it only gets ** 1/2
stars.</P>
<P>The Young-Uns: The film is probably too violent for most people, it is a war
movie after all. Language and a sex scene also appear. You should also have an
understanding of the Gulf War. Good Age 15 & Up</P>
