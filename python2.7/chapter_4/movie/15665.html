<PRE>A BUG'S LIFE (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Edited by Cher Johnson

<P>"Is it better than Antz?" is an obvious question that will come to mind
with the release of A Bug's Life. For me the answer is easy.</P>
<P>Unlike Antz, which was released just a few months ago, A Bug's Life is
aimed at a larger audience - though, especially aimed at kids. A Bug's Life
has less of Antz's social-political issues and replaces them with cuteness.
Antz was a movie about an ant who was a rebel in the colony; the same is
true with A Bug's Life. That's where the similarities end.</P>
<P>Flik (Dave Foley of "News Radio") is a rebel in the ant colony. He has many
brilliant ideas that are cast aside by the colony - including a machine
that would help ease the harvest. The harvest is a grueling ordeal for the
colony because they have to do it twice a year. Once to feed the invading
grasshoppers led by Hopper (Kevin Spacey) and another time to feed the
colony. This year Flik accidentally knocks over the pile of grain for the
grasshoppers and all is lost. Hopper arrives and gives the Queen (Phyllis
Diller) one more chance to get the harvest done. Princess Atta (Julia
Louis-Dreyfus) and a council decide to send Flik off under the pretenses of
finding warrior bugs to help battle off the returning grasshoppers.</P>
<P>What Flik finds is a rag-tag group of circus performers who he mistakes as
warrior bugs . These performers include: a stick-like bug, Slim (David Hyde
Pierce of "Frasier"); an overly large caterpiller of sorts, Heimlich (Joe
Ramft); a black widow spider, Rosie (Bonnie Hunt); and my favourite of them
all, a lady bug named Francis (Dennis Leary). Together these circus
performers band together with the ant colony and plan to fend off the
returning grasshoppers.</P>
<P>The story for A Bug's Life is simple, as it should be, to keep kids'
attention. There are many jokes that appeal to the kids, but there are also
jokes that appeal to adults taking their children to see the film. Pixar
has put out a film that will entertain all ages.</P>
<P>This is Pixar's second venture into making a full length computer animated
feature film. Their first was the mega-hit Toy Story. A Bug's Life has one
thing missing that Toy Story, and all other Disney films, have. The missing
element is songs during the film. For A Bug's Life it was a good choice;
the flow of the story was never interrupted by singing characters. It does
feel funny to see an animated Disney film without songs, but it's also a
refreshing change.</P>
<P>All the voice performers were excellent. I loved Kevin Spacey as Hopper the
most. Hopper has four arms and with the animation used to express the
personality of Hopper, he is one of the best animated character's I've seen
in a long while. Spacey has enough resonance in his voice to make Hopper
scary, but not too scary. Kudos to Spacey for a wonderful performance.</P>
<P>Dave Foley plays Flik and he does it with flair. Unlike the soft-spoken and
self-deprecating Woody Allen as Z in Antz, Foley is alive with the
character Flik. Flik is a character that requires a naïve and young
sounding voice and Foley provides just that.</P>
<P>The voice that was hilarious and will be overlooked is that of Richard Kind
("Spin City") who plays Molt, Hopper's goofy brother. Kind, who is
extremely funny in "Spin City," brings the same type of goofiness to his
character and with the brilliance of the animators at Pixar, Molt is a
grasshopper-spitting-image of Kind.</P>
<P>There were two semi-non-talking characters, Tuck and Roll, that are just
laugh-out-loud funny. They are the "roly-poly"  bugs and their mere
presence onscreen was enough to make me laugh.</P>
<P>The musical score by Randy Newman (Toy Story) fits the movie like a glove.
The score is jazzy and contemporary and goes hand in hand with the action.</P>
<P>As for the computer animation, Pixar has one-upped Pacific Data Images (the
people who made Antz). Antz was a film for adults and because of this the
film looked somewhat bland with all the colors taken from the real world.
This meant that there was a lot of the color brown in the film and there
wasn't really anything eye-catching about that. In A Bug's Life, directors
John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton fill the screen with bright vivid colors.
>From the sky blue of the ants to the bright red of Francis, A Bug's Life
screams with color. The one thing that that Antz had over A Bug's Life was
the sheer volume of ants rendered for film. In A Bug's Life, there are
scenes with many ants onscreen, but in Antz there are scenes with the
entire colony onscreen - and this sheer volume is overwhelming. But,
overall, A Bug's Life wins in the visual department.</P>
<P>A Bug's Life is the winner in the battle of the animated ants. I gave Antz
a Don't Miss nod and I'm going to give A Bug's Life a Don't Miss nod also -
I loved both films, although they are different. Whereas Antz is more deep
and exploratory look into society, A Bug's Life is quirky and hilarious. I
just enjoyed A Bug's Life more with its large audience appeal, offbeat
humor, and gorgeous look. This film is destined to be a Disney classic.
Don't Miss A Bug's Life on the big screen. And don't leave the theatre when
the credits start to roll. If you do, you'll miss out on the hilarious
bloopers reel.</P>
