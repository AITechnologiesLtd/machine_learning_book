<PRE>Wild Things
3/26/98</PRE>
<P>The neatest part about Wild Things is how it forced me to watch the
credits. By revealing key parts to the plot(I use this term loosely.)
in-between the credits, the filmmakers managed to keep three-fourths of the
audience in their seats until the credits completed, an impressive
achievement. </P>
<P>I can only tell you a small portion of the movies plot, or you will miss
guessing the laughable plot twist. High school senior Kelly Van Ryan(Denise
Richards) falls in love with her guidance counselor, Sam Lombardo(Matt
Dillon). Kelly tries several times to lure him into an intimate
relationship, but when her attempts fail she accuses him of rape. Jumping
on the rape charge bandwagon Suzie Toller(Neve Campbell) accuses Sam, with
the two accusations he is quickly taken to court. Sam, out of money and
desperate for a lawyer, hires a sleazy insurance fraud attorney, Ken
Bowden(Bill Murray, in the best performance of the film.). Following a
confusing trial Sam's case is dismissed and all charges are dropped, this
is done by way of several predictable plot twists. When Sam is cleared of
the charges he sues Kelly's rich mother and receives a little over eight
million. So now you have to figure out who's playing who, and who should
anyone trust? There are so many plot twist in this movie its almost funny,
its sad that all the twist are ultra predictable and illogical.  </P>
<P>The cast is, on the most part, highly attractive.  They all get
opportunities through the film to display their bodies, there is even a
threesome scene with Denise Richards, Matt Dillon, and Neve Campbell. The
best actual performance is that of Bill Murray as the lawyer who makes his
money off insurance fraud, its a hilarious piece of work and he steals all
the scenes he's in. I could spend all day pointing out how bad the other
performances were, but then I wouldn't be able to tell you about the good
parts. </P>
<P>This is a funny movie, I don't know if it was meant to be serious but I was
laughing out loud at some of the scenes. Maybe it was just the
implausibility or maybe the terrible dialogue, but it was just really
funny.  If you are looking for a entertaining, erotic, campy, and funny
movie, than this could be for you. If you want a good intelligent thriller,
look elsewhere.</P>
