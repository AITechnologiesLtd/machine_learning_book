                    A review in the public domain
                            by The Phantom
                           (<A HREF="mailto:sbb@panix.com">sbb@panix.com</A>)</PRE>
<P>     Certain bad films -- most often the very worst -- announce
themselves and their intentions to a critic well before the theater
lights dim, much as a "Bridge Out" sign on a dark and stormy night lets
a motorist know that he or she must detour quickly or risk driving into
an abyss.  The Phantom felt just the sort of feeling of dread that such
a motorist might feel as he arrived at Times Square's premiere palace of
cinematic sleaze, the Criterion theater (now completely made over by
United Artists in an attempt to make it seem more of a mainstream
theater than its red-light roots will ever warrant) for a late-
afternoon showing of LEPRECHAUN.  Before entering the theater, he
happened to glance upward at the Criterion's marquee; however much his
spirits may have been buoyed by his ability to sneak out of work a tad
early on Friday, they quickly slipped off the edge of his critical
ravine when he read the film's tag line: "Your luck has just run out."</P>
<P>     Such tag lines rarely lie.  Consider the early Eighties bomb
STAYING ALIVE, poorly directed by Sylvester Stallone, with terrible
music by his brother Frank and equally appalling acting by John
Travolta, still apparently not mindful  of the various "Bridge Out"
signs he had passed thus far on the highway of his career (including
MOMENT BY MOMENT, a film unforgettable in its badness by the very few
people who have seen it).  In this ill-conceived sequel to SATURDAY
NIGHT FEVER, Travolta plays an aspiring dancer who wants to land a part
in a new Broadway show called "Satan's Alley."  This Broadway show is
billed in the film as "a musical trip through Hell," and as the audience
finds out during the film's closing scenes, no description could be more
accurate.  That the film itself is redeemed only by the sheer comic
awfulness of this Broadway show doesn't diminish the uncanny accuracy of
such descriptions: when you hear that you are about to take a musical
trip through Hell, chances are the film you are watching will go
straight there with all due speed, in or out of a hand-basket.</P>
<P>     As did the subject of this review, the so-called horror film
LEPRECHAUN.  The Phantom says "so-called" since it's not entirely clear
what the filmmakers had in mind here; while there are elements of horror
in the film, much of it is played out as a kind of sick comedy ("sick"
here meaning "not well" or "not good," as opposed to "dark" or
"sinister").  What is even less clear is why this film ever saw the
bright lights of theatrical exhibition; such amateurish productions are
generally reserved for the dank basements of direct- to-video release,
where they join countless other D2V productions that usually exhibit
more creativity and thoughtfulness in their cover art than they do in
their screenplays or direction.</P>
<P>     (It is a fine line indeed that separates D2V releases from their
more legitimate theatrical brethren, but oftentimes that line serves as
the point where talent and sufficient funding end and crass commercial-
ization and quick-buck profiteering begin.  The Phantom has thus far
refrained from reviewing D2V releases only because of the sheer number
of better funded theatrical releases that enjoy higher production values
than typical D2Vs; that alone is worth something, since even if the
films themselves aren't of much higher quality, most action and horror
films play a lot better if their soundtracks are cranked up to
ear-splitting levels and their pictures are projected on 27-foot --
rather than 27-inch -- screens.)</P>
<P>     LEPRECHAUN is a horror film in the "revenge of the little people"
mold and follows such successful entries as CHILD'S PLAY and DOLLS.  But
it follows them at quite a distance and at an equally great disadvantage
-- while its predecessors benefited from the brilliant direction of Tom
Holland and Stuart Gordon (respectively) and from clever and
well-written screenplays, any chance that LEPRECHAUN might turn into an
equally compelling film is wasted early on by nearly everyone involved.
From director to writer, from actors to actresses, no one associated
with this production appears to be very talented or even particularly
interested in producing a decent horror film.  The one exception is
Kevin Kiner, whose effective score is the one bright spot in any
otherwise nearly unbearable production.</P>
<P>     The film's plot -- such as it is -- revolves around the title
character; we discover in a prologue that his gold was stolen by Old Man
O'Grady, who foolishly brings it home with him, thinking all the while
that the leprechaun he tricked into giving it up would remain in Ireland
and presumably file for personal bankruptcy protection.  Needless to
say, the little fellow does not follow Judge Wapner's instructions and
take Old Man O'Grady to court; instead, he takes the law into his own
hands and within just a few minutes causes the entire O'Grady family as
much harm as a tiny little fellow in a cute green suit with big buckles
on his shoes could conceivably cause.</P>
<P>     Fast forward now to ten years in the future.  (To be honest, at
this point the Phantom would have preferred to rewind, but alas no
remote control was available for rental at the snack bar, and he found
himself stranded in the theater auditorium for the duration.)  Arrives
at the house an unlikely collection of stock exploitation characters,
including a dopey father; his pretty and even more dopey daughter; and
"three guys that paint": one an imbecile; one a lame-brained hunk; and
one the most obnoxious child actor since ANNIE graced the silver screen.
As the film drags along we find the dopey daughter and the lame-brained
hunk strike up what passes for a cute flirtation in this kind of film,
and she joins the three guys that paint in doing what is perhaps the
saddest, least adequate job of housepainting since Mr.  Blandings built
his dream house.  (As the film progressed, the Phantom got the feeling
that these were three guys who also write horror film screenplays, which
would certainly explain a lot.)</P>
<P>     While the screen is filled to near overflowing with this torrent of
action, the leprechaun pops in every so often and, well, pesters
everyone.  To say that this leprechaun is no Jason or Freddy is to
understate the situation rather dramatically; although the Phantom tries
mightily never to do anything to spoil a film for his phans, he will
note that the film's body count just barely breaks into single digits.
A cinematic "truth in advertising" law would have required a change in
title to "LEPRECHAUN: PORTRAIT OF A NON-SERIAL KILLER."</P>
<P>     In fact, although this Darth Vader of the Keebler elf set is no
serial killer, there *is* a cereal sight gag in the film wherein the
little fellow comes across a box of Lucky Charms (ho ho!)  in one of a
never-ending series of blatant product placements.  The producers deserve
some credit for actually thanking the two dozen or so different
companies for their financial support of the film in return for an equal
number of rather obvious product placements; but why any legitimate
company would want to become involved in this production is a mystery,
though one that the Phantom has been pondering ever since he discovered
that Frito-Lay products Q especially Doritos Q and Jolt cola are the
official snack foods of Duane, Belial, and the other unique individuals
in Frank Henenlotter's wonderful BASKET CASE films.  Another of the
Phantom's favorite product placements involves the use of the
"Reebok-cam" and the closely related "L.A.  Gear-cam" -- two
modifications of the ground-breaking Steadi-Cam that focus unerringly on
people's feet.  Walking, running, getting into cars, getting out of
cars: if someone's wearing a pair of nationally-advertised athletic
shoes, you'll get a long, lingering look at them.</P>
<P>     As the action in the film heats up to a roaring simmer, we find
that the writer has written us all into a corner: since Old Man O'Grady
is the only one who knows how to kill the leprechaun, and since Old Man
O'Grady has long since been sent to the North Dakota Home for
Embarrassingly Stereotyped Irish Characters, our intrepid band of
nitwits, lame-brains, and obnoxious child actors are forced to seek him
out and discover for themselves how to end the film.  (Sadly they,
unlike the audience, cannot just up and walk out.)  So Tory (the dopey
daughter) goes to the Home to find O'Grady and ask him how he would go
about killing a leprechaun, no doubt apologizing first for dragging him
back into a film he'd successfully escaped nearly 80 minutes before.</P>
<P>     But surprise!  Old Man O'Grady isn't at the home after all;
instead, we are treated to a very poor retread of the famous "attic"
scene in PSYCHO, and Tory runs screaming back to the elevator.  (This is
in fact one of the only moderately scary scenes in the film, and by
revealing it here the Phantom hopes he can dissuade his phans from
seeing LEPRECHAUN's 91 other minutes.)</P>
<P>     Then our luck really does run out.  Apparently noticing that our
band of merry morons *still* has no way to kill the pesty dwarf (or at
least get him to stop screaming "I need me gold!"  every five minutes
like some strung-out Popeye gone terribly awry), the writer does
something that still amazes the Phantom as he thinks back on the film's
sorry plot: he has Old Man O'Grady *fall through the elevator's
ceiling*, and tell Tory with his dying breath what she needs to do to
end the film.  For the first time in his reviewing career the Phantom
was left speechless as he stared, slack-jawed in amazement, at the
screen.  Welcome to plot convenience playhouse, ladies and gentlemen!
Please be sure to check your respect for the audience at the door and
step lively to the film's closing scenes!</P>
<P>     Which, in fact, come right on the heels of this elevonic scene of
great convenience and least effort, a sort of Deus Ex Otis that will
remain with the Phantom for a long time to come.  Certainly he will
think twice before yelling "and how likely is that?"  at the screen
while watching an improbable plot development in some future bad film.
"O'Grady In The Elevator" might even make it into the Phantom's lexicon
of film criticism, right after "Jasonized" and just before
"Spring-Loaded Cat."  (In a way, it's kind of a shame that so few people
will ever see this film; the Phantom could never use a term casually
that only a handful of his phans would understand.)</P>
<P>     It goes without saying at this point that LEPRECHAUN is a complete
waste of time and money.  It is a film that in a better world never
would have been made, and we can only hope that the independent
production company responsible will go the way of Vestron and so many
other over-extended and now bankrupt indies who thought it was as easy
to make movies as it is to distribute videos.  LEPRECHAUN is Trimark
Pictures' very first theatrical release; in honor of the occasion, they
spent the majority of the film's low budget on a barrage of television
advertising in order to rake in as much money as possible in two weeks,
pull up theatrical stakes, and get the film released into the even more
lucrative video market in a couple months time.  So let's all do what we
can to see that this cynical strategy fails: avoid LEPRECHAUN like the
plague, now while it's still in theaters and this spring when it hits
your local Blockbusters.  Although it is not (incredibly!) the worst
film the Phantom has ever seen, it comes much too close for comfort.</P>
