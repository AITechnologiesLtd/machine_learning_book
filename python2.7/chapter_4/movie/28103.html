<PRE>GOYA IN BORDEAUX
Reviewed on March 28th, 2001
By Jerry Saravia</PRE>
<P>Famed Spanish painter Francisco Goya created paintings of carcasses of pigs, 
sheep and other animals using dark, vibrant colors (he also painted visions 
of death using people as well). His life must have been fascinating but you 
wouldn't know it from watching Carlos Saura's "Goya in Bordeaux," which 
reveals so little of the man and his art that it may as well be about good 
old King Henry VIII, if not for the time period and costuming. </P>
<P>The old Goya is played by Francisco Rabal, shown living in exile in France 
with his caring wife and his mature teenage daughter, Rosario (Daphne 
Fernandez). Goya reminisces about his past to Rosario, though she has heard 
these stories countless times before. He speaks of an affair he had with the 
dangerous Cayetano, Duchess of Alba (Maribel Verdu), who later opposed and 
was thus poisoned by the Queen Maria Luisa. There are also glimpses into his 
days as a court painter, his portraits of people he found both significant 
and otherwise, his increasing deafness, his admiration of Velazquez's "Las 
Meninas" and the visions of death he had that so haunted him till the end of 
his life. The younger, middle-aged Goya as shown in these flashbacks is 
played by Jose Coronado, and he is so charismatic and romantic that one 
wishes Saura spent more time exploring this actor. Alas, he does not. </P>
<P>"Goya in Bordeaux" is stunningly shot by one of our great cinematographers, 
Vittorio Storaro (who helmed Saura's previous "Tango," as well as some early 
Bertolucci), and it is beautifully crafted with various lighting color 
schemes and silhouettes, as if we were watching a painting unfold before our 
eyes. Unfortunately, there is barely much illumination into Goya's life and 
so we get the feeling that we are watching a series of still lifes that shed 
scarce insight into the man. We mostly see the older Goya fretting and 
arguing and feeling disoriented by his paintings but that is as far as one 
gets into his soul. As it is, this film may as well be about any sick old man 
living in exile. </P>
