<PRE>Dude, Where's My Car?
A film review by Pete Croatto

<P>I really wanted to like Dude, Where's My Car?  After a week of
deadlines, dead time, and dead emotions, I needed a goofy movie to
revive me.</P>
<P>So, imagine my horror as I sat alone in the cavernous theater, trying to
muster a chuckle or a titter.  Ornery ostriches didn't do the trick. 
Neither did a transsexual stripper, a pot-smoking dog or an appearance
by Fabio.</P>
<P>There is a place for movies like Dude, Where's My Car? -- National
Lampoon's Animal House, Blazing Saddles, Tommy Boy, etc.  When they
work.  And when that happens, I'm on a cinematic high for weeks.  I
still smile whenever I hear the phrase "double secret probation."  In
the case of the silly comedies that fail, it's like watching a guy slip
on a banana peel.  It might be funny the first time, but how about the
fiftieth time?</P>
<P>Unfortunately, Dude has crates full of bananas, and it's ultimately
doomed -- just like its two main characters, Jesse and Chester (Ashton
Kutcher and Seann William Scott, respectively), doper roommates with a
major problem.  After a wild night of partying with Chester, Jesse can't
find his car the next day.  The two friends don't even have a clue as to
what happened the night before.</P>
<P>The boys soon embark on a madcap adventure to find Jesse's car.  In
their odyssey, they gradually learn about last night's events, which
included strippers, buff aliens, and tattoos.  Jesse and Chester also
discover that they are now responsible for the fate of the universe. 
Bummer.</P>
<P>I know a movie like Dude is geared for brainless laughs, but shouldn't
some thought have been invested in making it? The movie survives solely
on the aforementioned wacky antics, which turns Dude into a feat of
endurance that would fatigue a marathon runner.</P>
<P>There's no break from the goofball proceedings.  Screenwriter Philip
Stark and director Danny Leiner don't give us a single character with
any wit or subtlety.  Watching Dude is like viewing a parade of the
hackneyed characters of movies past.  There are stoned morons,
sympathetic girlfriends, bullying jocks, super-intense space nerds, and
the soulful black pizza owner (from The Last Dragon, of course).</P>
<P>As for Jesse and Chester, they might be the first characters in movie
history without a working cerebrum.  It would have been funnier if these
guys were smart, so they could sarcastically comment on their absurd
situation.  But Scott and Kutcher are given little more to do than say
"shibby" and "sweet" in a frat-boy cadence... and then break things. 
And that's a shame, because I like both of these guys.  Kutcher is a
dopey highlight on the Fox sitcom That '70s Show, and Scott with his
prankster grin was a big reason why American Pie was my favorite movie
last year.  In Dude, their scenes induce empathetic winces, instead of
laughs.</P>
<P>I wish I could say something glowing about this mess, and I wish I had
an idea of why people are seeing it.  My guess is it's either an
indication that 2000 was truly a terrible year for movies, or it could
be a genuine sign of the apocalypse.</P>
