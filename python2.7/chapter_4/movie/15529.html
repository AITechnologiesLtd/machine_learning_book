BLUE VELVET
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1998</PRE>
<P>Some times in 1990 I stumbled on some Bosnian weekly
magazine which featured the article about the best and most
influential movies of 1980s. The article was based on the
Top 10 poll conducted among the young film critics of former
Yugoslavia. I was more than pleasantly surprised to see two
entries - movies that I happen to adore and consider very
special, unlike most of the audience, which forgot them, or
mainstream critics who rejected them because of the content
or some other petty controversies. One of those two
masterpieces was CONAN THE BARBARIAN, 1981 fantasy epic by
John Millius. The other one was BLUE VELVET, dark,
disturbing thriller made in 1986 by David Lynch.</P>
<P>At the time, Lynch was hardly known outside the critics'
circles, mostly because of his "artsy" reputation, brought
by ERASERHEAD, his extremely disturbing debut feature that
later developed a cult following among alternative cinema
aficionados. His reputation of director who likes disturbing
content and revolting images was strengthen by his first two
mainstream movies - THE ELEPHANT MAN and DUNE. The latter
one turned out to be commercial disaster, and the jury is
still out whether because of Lynch's unconventional style,
or meddling producers. One of those producers, de
Laurentiis, should be forgiven for that transgression,
because two years later he atoned to the movie lovers
community by giving Lynch another chance. It was more than
that - the chance was used by Lynch who made BLUE VELVET,
very personal film that proved not only the best in his opus
but also one of the best movies of the decade. BLUE VELVET,
unfortunately, didn't became popular by itself - Lynch had
to make his ground-breaking TV series TWIN PEAKS first; he
became a household name, attractive enough for general
audience, and thus brought attention on his earlier work.</P>
<P>It isn't surprising that those who had enjoyed TWIN PEAKS
have the same feelings about BLUE VELVET. The movie and the
TV series have a lot in common, but most noticeable of
common elements is a subject - small all-American town that
hides some sinister secrets. The plot of the movie begins in
Lumberton, small town inhabited almost exclusively by
middle-class people who live in suburban idyll. One of those
people is Mr. Beaumont (Jack Harvey) who suffers stroke, and
his young son Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan) must visit him in
hospital. While returning from one of such visits, he finds
a severed human ear in a field. He picks it up and brings it
to Detective Williams (George Dickerson), his close
neighbour. Detective is very grateful for that find, but,
being the by-the-book policeman, declines to satisfy
Jeffrey's growing curiosity by providing information about
investigation. Sandy (Laura Dern), Detective's young and
attractive daughter, seems to be more helpful by giving some
hints to Jeffrey. Those hints mostly concern Dorothy Vallens
(Isabella Rosselini), beautiful and mysterious bar singer
who lives on the wrong side of tracks. Armed with that
knowledge, Jeffrey decides to begin investigation of his own
and devises daring plan to sneak into singer's apartment and
observe. However, that plan misfires, because Dorothy
discovers Jeffrey hiding in her closet and takes him at
knife-point. Scared, embarrassed but also aroused, Jeffrey
is suddenly forced to hide again, because Dorothy gets
another visitor. That visitor is Frank Booth (Dennis
Hopper), sick, violent and extremely dangerous man who loves
sadistic sex and uses blackmail in order to make Dorothy
"doing things" for him. Despite the shock, and against
Sandy's better judgement, Jeffrey decides to investigate
further, bringing his own life and life of his dearest in
danger.</P>
<P>One of the reasons why BLUE VELVET seems to be so appealing
to so many people - at least those who are way behind their
teen years - is the fact that it takes some very universal
subject - loss of innocence. But such subject is here
explored in a very personal story, with a lot of
autobiographical elements. Even the title seems to be very
symbolic - borrowed from a song by Bobby Vinton, that used
to be huge hit in 1963. That very year symbolised the loss
of innocence for entire generation, especially Americans who
had to experience the trauma of JFK assassination. That
event and that year symbolised the fading away of the
idealised, idyllic America embodied in small towns and white
fences, that we see in beginning of the movie; it was
replaced by dark, violent world of depravity, confusion,
violence and corruption of Vietnam and Watergate. Lynch as
an artist probably didn't care much about trials and
tribulations of those times - but his personal confusion
and painful transition to maturity corresponded with
similar, although more collective experiences of other
people who used to live in those times. However, in order to
make movie as personal as possible, Lynch deliberately
decided to be ambiguous about time period. That was acquired
with a very detailed work of production designers Patricia
Norris and costume designer Gloria Laughride - apart from
hairstyles, this movie could have taken place in early 1960s
without anyone noticing it.</P>
<P>No matter how meticulous, the work on the production design
and costumes was second in importance to the work of
Frederick Elmes, photographer who had much more important
task - of expressing Lynch's own obsessions through the
precise use of lighting and colour. Most of the photography
was good, especially in the scenes that used to shock some
critics with its explicit and mercilessly precise depiction
of violence and utter depravity. World, or to be more
precise, underworld of BLUE VELVET is dark, sinister place,
but also a place where extremely bad and unpleasant things
(unlike in cheap horrors) do come to light. It is an also
world of sharp contrasts - between childlike innocence and
violent depravity; boringly law-abiding citizens and
interesting, but deadly villains; people who know the
difference between right and wrong and those who get
themselves lost; angels and demons; Madonnas and whores.</P>
<P>Despite those sharp contrasts, BLUE VELVET has characters
who defy single- dimensional moral alignment. Jeffrey
Beaumont, author's alter ego is played by Kyle MacLachlan,
actor who made his character some kind of a prequel to his
Agent Cooper personality in TWIN PEAKS. This young man wants
to do the right thing, but at the same time he is curious,
and that curiosity leads him not only to personal danger,
but to the danger of losing his own moral compass. His
motives might look noble from the outside, but from the
inside they aren't so certain - idea to "sneak, hide and
observe" could be explain by prosaic voyeurism (and Lynch
himself hinted that in one of his interviews), and later
with his obvious sexual attraction to Dorothy. Dorothy,
played by Isabella Rosselini in the best known role of her
entire acting career, is a woman whose character is
something more than a simple victim - she is violated in an
almost unimaginable way. That is symbolised in one of the
shots in the final part of movie, when her nude body, that
should have been attractive in any other context, actually
becomes unbearable to watch. (That very sequence later
enraged some critics who accused Lynch for downright sadism
towards her female lead). Her own actions and feelings
towards Jeffrey, that might look like a product of deranged
mind on the road of depravity, are actually desperate
attempt to find some sense, even in utter despair and evil.
Dorothy's opposite is Sandy, young, blond, clean
all-American girl, whose role in this movie is to be the
voice of reason and the only link to the "normal" world for
Jeffrey. But, her own motives are also unclear - she too
seem to be thrilled by their investigation, and Jeffrey
would never entered into adventure without her interference.
Laura Dern, who plays Sandy, is very good in one of her
first major roles. Her interaction with MacLachlan is simply
unbelievably realistic; since the first time two of them
meet, we are sure that they would end as couple.</P>
<P>Such great movie also requires a great villain. That role
was given to Dennis Hopper, veteran actor and director who
became his great renaissance as character actor in mid
1980s, mostly due films like BLUE VELVET. If there was an
example of role tailor- made for certain actor, Frank Booth
is one of them. Hopper played him with such intensity that
he managed to outshine almost anything in his career. From
the moment he enters picture, we are certain that he means
bad news - his menacing look, intensive use of vulgar
vocabulary and, finally, outbursts of irrational violence.
However, such evil attracts other evil - Frank has group of
trusted henchmen, played by Lynch's own trusted merry men -
actors like Brad Dourif and late Jack Nance. Role of Frank
was so associated with Hopper himself, that he tried to find
excuses for the character of Frank in some interviews,
citing his love for Dorothy as a cause for all twists in the
movie.</P>
<P>BLUE VELVET was a more than good or very good film, it was
an excellent film. Unfortunately, single element kept it
from the top and deprived it of the cinematic perfection.
That was the score of Angelo Badalamenti, Lynch's
semi-official composer. Although good per se, the
sentimental Badalamenti's themes were silenced by more
popular and catchy songs of Bobby Vinton and Roy Orbison.
But, despite that almost unnoticeable flaw, BLUE VELVET
still remains the movie that deserves to be adored and
re-watched, same as masterpieces that actually reached the
perfection.</P>
