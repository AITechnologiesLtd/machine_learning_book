<P>Football is as engrained in our society's mores as deeply as war, family
values, and politics -- at least that's what Oliver Stone would like you
to believe.  To back up this statement, ANY GIVEN SUNDAY analyzes the
effects of a culture that elevates professional athletes and coaches to
a plateau, which immortalizes them as heroes of the common man.  Stone's
football fairytale is a culmination of every anecdote, highlight, or
soundbite you've ever seen associated with the pigskin, wrapped up in an
aesthetically pleasing Christmas package, and sealed with a kiss from
team owner Cameron Diaz.  Stone aims to please, and he doesn't miss a
single cliché of the revered and scrutinized American athlete.</P>
<P>At its core, ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is the story of Miami Sharks coach Tony
D'Amato (Al Pacino - THE GODFATHER, DOG DAY AFTERNOON) and his two
quarterbacks, Willie Beamen (Jamie Foxx - THE GREAT WHITE HYPE, BOOTY
CALL) and Cap Bowman (Dennis Quaid - THE BIG EASY, INNERSPACE).  The
quarterback is the most vital position in the game.  He is the team
spokesperson and field chief, and he serves as a crucial link between
coaches, administration, and players.  When legendary two-time Pantheon
Cup (aka: Super Bowl) champion Cap Bowman ruptures a disk after a bone
crushing hit, coach Tony is left with Willie Beamen (Foxx), an athletic,
yet untested QB.  His team has lost four straight and appears to be
plummeting in a downward spiral with the playoffs right around the
corner.   He's got delusional team owner Christina Pagniacci (Cameron
Diaz) and sports analyst Jack Rose (John McGinley, doing his best Jim
Rose impersonation) breathing down his neck because of his outdated
coaching style, and a team of players he's losing control of.</P>
<P>When Willie Beaman turns out to be a phenom and his team makes the
playoffs, Coach D'Amato must decide whether to stick with Cap, the
battered yet savvy veteran, or turn the reigns over to the flamboyant
prodigy, Beaman, who has been changing plays in the huddle, and is
selfishly leaving the rest of the team out of his newfound success.  In
choosing, Coach D must analyze his place in the history of the game, the
modern athlete versus the ghosts of the past, and the sacrifices he has
made of family and friends in living up to the team motto, "Whatever it
takes!"</P>
<P>If you're even vaguely familiar with the Oliver Stone movie formula,
you'll know in advance that there will be about eight subplots going on
at once.  Lawrence Taylor, the NFL all-time sacks leader, is an aging
linebacker faced with a nerve injury that could take his life, but he
can't collect his million dollar-signing bonus unless he continues to
play.  James Woods is Dr. Harvey Mandrake, a slimy team doctor with no
compassion for the physical well being of his players, who will
authorize or withhold the athletes from competition at the discretion of
the team owner.  Mathew Modine (THE BLACKOUT, VISION QUEST) is his
medical assistant, who attempts to act as a moral blockade for the
corrupt Mandrake.  Meanwhile, Ann-Margaret, (GRUMPY OLD MEN) the
matriarch of the Pagniacci family, maintains that the pressures of
owning a professional football team were responsible for killing her
husband and the cause of her miserable existence.  The intertwined side
stories add much-needed volume to the basic theme of the coach and his
quarterback controversy.</P>
<P>Oliver Stone unveils the Miami Sharks from all angles.  The film goes
inside the lives of the players: from the expensive women, to the drugs,
to the seemingly endless flow of money, and into their volatile home
lives.  He plays the race card effectively by making references to the
problem of all-white ownership in a sport that is dominated with black
athletes.  Yet his proclamation is not overly bold, because at the same
time, he casts Dallas Cowboys owner Barry Switzer as a color
commentator.  He also criticizes the media for its suffocating coverage
and idolatry of the league's players through his portrayal of
pretentious sports personality Jack Rose.</P>
<P>The football scenes are accompanied with music and lighting reminiscent
of a music video.  A true fan may find some of the action scenes a
little hard to swallow, but they're fun to watch, even when they're
unbelievable.  Also noteworthy is the fact that the coach would surely
notice if a QB were changing plays in the huddle.  For Pacino to have to
find out from LL Cool J, his star running back, is preposterous.  Just
ask any football coach.</P>
<P>On the plus side, the enormous ensemble cast is fantastic and there are
more cameos than I can count or make reference to.  See if you can pick
out some of the NFL greats yourself.  Pacino is once again stunning and
James Woods is like a chameleon putting on yet another credible
performance, but Cameron Diaz's act really takes the cake as a heartless
owner caught up in the high stakes of a winning football team that's
losing money.</P>
<P>Overall, it's a high-octane testosterone laden picture.  If you like
football, you'll love this film.</P>
<PRE>3.5 stars</PRE>
