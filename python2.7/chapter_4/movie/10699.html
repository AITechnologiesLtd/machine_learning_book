Half Baked (R) no stars</PRE>
<P>The title of the comedy Half Baked actually gives the film a lot more
credit than it deserves.  Despite a few amusing moments and sporadic
flashes of wit and creativity, this silly and strange film as a whole is so
undercooked that its entirety can be summed up in three letters: P-O-T.</P>
<P>Even though it clocks in at only 82 minutes, Dave Chappelle and Neal
Brennan's script for Half Baked features barely enough plot to sustain even
that brief of a running time.  The threadbare storyline focuses on the
marijuana-selling operation pothead buddies Thurgood (Chappelle), Brian
(Jim Breuer), and Scarface (Guillermo Diaz) create to raise bail money for
their friend Kenny (Harland Williams), who is in jail for inadvertently
killing a diabetic police horse by feeding it junk food (don't ask).</P>
<P>Aside from a forced romantic subplot between Thurgood and the staunchly
anti-drug Mary Jane (Rachel True), the above is all Half Baked has in the
way of plot.  This would not be a problem if there were at least something
funny going on.  But there really isn't--though director Tamra Davis can be
credited with at least trying to make something unique.  Part of what gives
the film a decidedly strange feel is its reliance on elaborate, sometimes
inventive, sight gags, most of these depict the characters' state of mind
while high.  While some of the gags are interesting, such as the young
Thurgood envisioning and eating giant-sized candy bars after he has his
first puff, there are also quite a few lame ones, such as a recurring bit
where characters float in the air after trying some especially strong
product (in one instance, the wires carrying the actors are visible).  But
these mildly amusing (at best) gags are nothing more than an obvious
disguise for the thinness of the premise, as is the parade of celebrity
cameos, encompassing the likes of Snoop Doggy Dogg, Willie Nelson, Janeane
Garofalo, Stephen Baldwin, Steven Wright, Jon Stewart, and Bob Saget.
Strip all that away and what remains is lots of smoking, the main trio
acting stoned (Breuer especially lays it on thick), and even more talk
_about_ smoking.  Needless to say, all the pot use, wild antics while high,
and discussion about marijuana gets very old after a while--like five minutes.</P>
<P>I must say that I was actually found more amusement from Half Baked, which
was not screened in advance for critics (shocker), than I originally
expected.  The filmmakers obviously tried to make something strange and
different, which the film indeed is.  It's just that they forgot to come up
with more than one joke, and the one that they do have isn't very funny.</P>
