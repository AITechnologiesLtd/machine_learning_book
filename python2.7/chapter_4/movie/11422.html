<PRE>A movie review by Walter Frith</PRE>

<P>I was reminded throughout 'Twilight' that with all of the
accomplishments the creators of this film have had that none of them
turn in their best work and they didn't intend to.  With an Elmer
Bernstein score to keep things running, if you closed your eyes, you
would swear that a film from the 1940's or 50's was being played out,
with the exception of a few four letter words of unnecessary choice for
the tone of this movie's intended audience.  It isn't limited to only
fans of those old gumshoe adventures involving murder, sex, seduction,
blackmail, or otherwise, but it is a film more suited to those who know
the history of its leading actors and the dangling intrigue of suspense
thrillers.</P>
<P>At 73 years young, Paul Newman has the masculine prowess of a man 15
years younger and although he sports an unwanted mustache (women will
like it), he still manages to give it all he can and succeeds
magnificently.  Newman stars as a former police officer and former
private investigator who now dabbles in the occasional assignment,
mostly for his friends, a couple of former Hollywood stars, portrayed by
Gene Hackman and Susan Sarandon.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the film, Newman is in Mexico to bring Hackman and
Sarandon's daughter (a minor at 17) back to the States and he encounters
a rough time as the girl knocks his gun loose and nearly shoots off
his....*ahem*, you figure it out.</P>
<P>Newman is asked by Hackman to deliver a package and encounters a few 9mm
rounds fired at him in the attempt.  Newman later discovers that someone
could be blackmailing his friends as they are possibly implicated in the
mysterious death of Sarandon's first husband and that is all I will tell
you about the inner complexities plot.</P>
<P>Almost 70 himself, Gene Hackman plays his role with a sense of
simplistic style, naive of his wife's infidelities and his health begins 
to fail.  He collapses one night from assumed heart failure and tries to
contact Newman who hears him on his answering machine and Sarandon jumps
out of Newman's bed, complete with his recognizable polo shirt on and
comes to Hackman's aid, exposing the affair.</P>
<P>Susan Sarandon is sultry in the role of the cheating wife and throw in
James Garner for good measure as a cop turned high paid security chief
and you have the makings for all the conflicting elements of human
nature and the mix for a great set of actors to recite some snappy
dialogue written by Robert Benton and Richard Russo and directed by
Benton who last directed Newman in 'Nobody's Fool', from 1994.  Benton 
is the owner of three Oscars including his writing and directing efforts
on 1979's 'Kramer vs. Kramer', which also won Best Picture.</P>
<P>Not a classic film but a film done with class, 'Twilight' is a fitting 
title bestowed upon a cast whose best work is probably behind them and 
they can now choose work more subtle because they don't need 
the challenges of motion pictures and their past work shows they have
nothing left to prove.  A mild success which many may mistake as
being unnecessarily tame.</P>
