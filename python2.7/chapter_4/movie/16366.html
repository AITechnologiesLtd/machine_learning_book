Shakespeare in Love (1998) 3 1/2 stars out of 4</PRE>
<P>  A young playwright is under pressure to finish his latest work. The
producer is breathing down his neck because the producer's creditors are
breathing down his.</P>
<P>  But, alas, the young playwright's Muse has deserted him. He is without
inspiration and is suffering from writer's block.</P>
<P>  What's a young playwright to do. Well, if his name is Will Shakespeare,
he crashes a party to meet a beautiful young woman who, lo and behold, is a
patron of the theater and a fan of the playwright's.</P>
<P>  Thus, with newfound confidence our playwright sets out to compose his
latest comedy "Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter."</P>
<P>  But, soft, for as quickly as you can say iambic pentameter, our
love-struck Will is no longer writing a comedy. Ever so slowly, it is being
transformed into a classic love story of the ages. "Romeo and Ethel ... "
has been transformed by love into "Romeo and Juliet."</P>
<P> Thus is the conceit of Shakespeare in Love, a boisterous, bawdy and most
appealing romantic comedy, written by Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard.</P>
<P>  Shakespeare in Love is a luminous, entertaining tale. And, yes, having
some rudimentary knowledge of the Bard's work will heighten your enjoyment
of the movie, but even if you've never read a line from any of his plays or
sonnets, you still can appreciate the humor and theatricality of this
wonderful outing.</P>
<P>  Taking center stage in this enjoyable conceit is Gwyneth Paltrow as Lady
Viola, the young woman who longs for a stage career and also worships the
words of Shakespeare. Unfortunately, in Elizabethan England, women are
forbidden from appearing on the stage. The female parts were played by
young boys.</P>
<P>  So, Viola hits upon the idea of disguising herself as a man named Thomas
Kent so she can join Shakespeare's company of players. Any comparison
between Viola's actions and the plot of any Shakespeare work is purely not
coincidental.</P>
<P> Will and Viola become star-crossed lovers as she is bethrothed to another
- a poor nobleman who will use his dowry to build up his tobacco plantation
in Virginia.</P>
<P>  As Will and Viola's relationship deepens, so does the intensity of the
love story in Romeo and Juliet. And, when Will and Viola finally concede
that their love, while true, is doomed, it inspires Shakespeare to create
the tragic finale for his play.</P>
<P>  Paltrow is luscious, luminous, sensual as Viola. To use the Bard's own
words, "Oh, she doth teach the torches to burn bright! It seems she hangs
upon the cheek of night like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear. ...For I
ne'er saw true beauty till this night."</P>
<P>  She also displays a comic flair in her disguise as Thomas Kent, the
actor. Paltrow is the sun around which this comic tale revolves.</P>
<P>  As Shakespeare, Joseph Fiennes (younger brother of Ralph) is a bit
bumbling, but quick-witted and lustful. He is not a dashing figure, but
rather a tempermental young playwright trying to make a name for himself.</P>
<P>  A strong supporting cast including Oscar-winner Geoffrey Rush (Shine) as
the theater owner who believes comedy is box office, Ben Affleck as
matinee-idol dramatic actor Ned Alleyn, Tom Wilkinson (The Full Monty) as
Fennyman, the stage-struck money lender and, most notably, Dame Judi Dench
as Queen Elizabeth. With this performance, as well as her Oscar-nominated
impersonation of Queen Victoria in last year's Mrs. Brown, she displays the
skill that has made her a monarch among actors.</P>
<P>  Director John Madden (Mrs. Brown) keeps the film moving at a steady pace,
deftly switching from broad comedy to touching moments of romance and
drama.</P>
<P>  Shakespeare in Love in a wonderful experience. You need not be a fan of
the Bard to become enthralled, but I guarantee you will reach for a volume
of Shakespeare soon after leaving the theater.</P>
