<PRE>                                  AMATEUR
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Hal Hartley gives us three humorously
          dysfunctional characters on the run from equally
          strange thugs.  The pacing is slow, but more
          interesting than the plot are the strange
          characterizations.  Still, even they are not
          sufficient to float this often leaden film.
          Rating: low +1 (-4 to +4) text</PRE>
<P>     Hal Hartley is something of a rogue filmmaker, producing, writing,
and scoring the films he directs.  Of late he is making them for PBS's
American Playhouse.  I have seen only his THE UNBELIEVABLE TRUTH,
though I found that an original and well-made film, perhaps better than
AMATEUR.</P>
<P>     In the current film Hartley brings together a mixed bag of
characters who are unfortunately less than totally believable.  One
problem with his style is that he will completely change our
understanding of a character for the sake of a funny or bizarre line.
The main character is Isabelle (played by Isabelle Huppert).  For
fifteen years Isabelle was a nun.  Then she gave it up to write
pornography and give vent to her nymphomaniacal tendencies.
Unfortunately, her pornography does not sell because she cannot resist
the temptation to turn it into literature.  She is still holding off on
her nymphomaniacal binge because she is very choosy about her choice of
partners.  So with absolutely no experience with sex, she wants to bea
pornographer.  Into Isabelle's life comes a possible sex partner, an
injured man (played by Martin Donovan) with no memory of who he is or
how he came to be injured.  Also into Isabelle's life comes Sofia
(Elina Lowensohn of SCHINDLER'S LIST), a woman who is a porno film star
who has run afoul of a powerful criminal international arms dealer.
The dealer has sent two strangely erudite thugs to murder her.  Sofia
knows who the amnesiac really is, but does not want to tell him.
Complicating matters is a former associate of the amnesiac and Sofia,
Edward (played by Damian Young).</P>
<P>     Hartley's dialogue is as bizarre as Quentin Tarantino's in PULP
FICTION, but with characters not quite as bright.  Hartley leaves long
pauses between spoken lines and this tends to slow the film down.
While some have classified the film as a thriller, the slow pacing
tends to sap any thrills that AMATEUR might have delivered.  In truth,
because of their bizarre behavior and motives it is difficult to
identify with or even believe any of the characters.  One character who
has gotten an electrical shock seems to mimic the childish, brutish
mannerisms of the Frankenstein monster, particularly when he comically
lays siege to a pizza shop.</P>
<P>     Hartley wrote, directed, and even scored this film, much as he did
with his previous film SIMPLE MEN.  That film also featured
performances by Martin Donovan, Elina Lowensohn, and Damian Young.
This is Isabelle Huppert's first performance with Hartley, though she
is a familiar actress in France, particularly from Jean-Luc Goddard's
films.  Seeing similarities in Goddard's and Hartley's styles, she
wrote to Hartley suggesting that she act in his films.  Hartley admits
contritely her letter went unread for several months due to his own
disorganization.  When he realized what the letter was, he paid its
owner more respect.</P>
<P>     This is a film that turns out to be more entertaining than it
might at first appear, but its style does not allow it believable
characters, nor is the humor strong enough to qualify it as a comedy,
nor does the film function as a thriller, nor is the style really
interesting.  The combination of what it contributes in these aspects
is sufficient to make the film watchable, but it is little more than
that.  I give it a low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
