<P>     A widowed Chief Executive starts dating again.  That's the
deceptively straight-forward set-up of this crowd-pleasing romantic
comedy from director Rob Reiner (WHEN HARRY MET SALLY).  The new
girlfriend is Sydney Ellen Wade (Annette Bening), an environmental
lobbyist who finds herself flustered, and later charmed by Democratic
President Andrew Sheperd (Michael Douglas).  Together, they fumble
through the implications of White House dating, which includes an
upcoming election year and a series of ugly character attacks from
Senate Minority Leader Robert Rumson (Richard Dreyfuss).</P>
<P>     As written by Aaron Sorkin, THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT is less about
politics than about two people falling in love under extraordinary
circumstances.  The story does, however, provide a fascinating,
behind-the-scenes glimpse into the daily activities of the Chief
Executive.  He's a very busy man, to say the least, and Sorkin has
characterized the "Clintonesque" President as a bit disconnected from
his personal life.  (His pampered lifestyle and constant dashing away
to a crisis reminds of a better-written Bruce Wayne.  I wonder how he
would look in a rubber suit?)</P>
<P>     The political issues are the least successful.(**)  A couple of
plot points are downright confusing, the character of Bob Rumson is
never fully developed, and the big, Frank Capra finale falls a bit
flat.  No problem.  Reiner knows exactly what his assets are, and so he
places the greater weight on romance and comedy.  And what comedy!
Sorkin has written some great lines, here.  A wicked reference to the
Carolinas is a howl.  As is the President's "none of your damn
business" phone call.  The closing line, though, which I won't reveal
here, is by far the best.  (All good movies should end with such great
lines.)</P>
<P>Sure, the story could be longer, with more substance to balance the
weaker political segments, but with both Douglas and Bening virtually
*glowing* in their roles, THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT delivers the kind of
old-fashioned, cornball romance that makes stepping into these movies so
very much fun.  Perfect chemistry between the leads, as well as a crack
supporting cast that includes Martin Sheen and Michael J. Fox, more than
compensates for any deficit spending in the political arena.  Watch out
at Oscar time.</P>
<PRE>Grade: A-</PRE>
<P>**- As are the morality issues.  The script makes quite a fuss about
"character" and "family values" and, yet, these two lovebirds jump so
quickly into the sack that you have wonder exactly *where* Hollywood's
logic center is residing, these days.  Sigh.  I guess even the most
old-fashioned of films can't be entirely old-fashioned.</P>
