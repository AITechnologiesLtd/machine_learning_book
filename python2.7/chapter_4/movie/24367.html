<P>Patrick Bateman is someone Tom Wolfe might have come up with if he had 
written his books on acid. He's an arrogant suit from Wall Street obsessed 
with physical fitness, facial care products, designer clothing and expensive 
restaurants. And scoring cocaine. And misogyny. Oh, and he likes to mutilate 
people, and play around with their guts, too.</P>
<P>The character is the creation of Bret Easton Ellis, whose 1991 novel 
"American Psycho" was set amid the Manhattan yuppie scene of the late 1980s. 
The book was twisted, but it needed to be, because it had extreme things to 
say. Ellis saw the widespread obsessive egoism and greed of the Me Decade as 
dangerously sick, and his vision of its potential to produce vicious 
murderers makes a fair amount of sense. After all, any idiotic businessmen 
who made enough bucks could follow their every impulse and shit on whomever 
they wanted to, and their attitude was championed as fashionable.</P>
<P>Now "American Psycho" is a film directed by Mary Harron, with Christian Bale 
in the lead role. As in the source material, Bateman divides his time between 
working out, making lunch appointments, sitting around in his office and 
butchering fellow New Yorkers. Onscreen we see him stabbing a homeless man 
and a female acquaintance, decapitating a hooker with a chainsaw, blowing up 
a crowd of cops, chopping up one of his colleagues with an axe and telling us 
about numerous other crimes. Even when a private detective (Willem Dafoe) 
starts investigating the disappearances, though, Bateman never comes close to 
being caught. Why would anyone suspect a 'normal', standard, efficient young 
capitalist earner of criminal activity?</P>
<P>The killings in the story hammer home in a jarring manner the message of how 
inhuman Bateman and his ilk are; although his chums don't kill people or know 
that he's doing so, they do share his level of detachment from decent values. 
Most of the film illustrates this through black humour. In one scene, for 
example, a group of men use their business cards for a vanity contest, 
comparing them like cowboys showing off the sizes of their guns.</P>
<P>The problem with the comedy in the film is that Harron doesn't trust the 
material to be intrinsically funny, and has her actors deliver lines in 
broad, goofy tones, making clear they're in on the joke. That doesn't prevent 
us from laughing, but it does affect the satirical power of many moments -- 
we giggle mainly because the characters are talking in a preposterous manner, 
rather than because they're saying preposterous things.</P>
<P>Since almost every scene is performed in this silly way, the film is nowhere 
near as intense as the novel. If we laugh at the characters' paper-thin 
morals, that's the extent of our reaction; Harron doesn't let us give them 
enough thought to also be appalled by them. You could take the murders out of 
her "American Psycho" and it would be the same movie -- its purpose is to 
merely point at the vacant pomposity of the male yuppie, and ridicule it.</P>
<P>Still, on that level the movie works well. Although it is a missed 
opportunity (Ellis's angry expression of the madness of the situation was 
more affecting), it is at least an entertaining deflation of white-collar 
stuffed shirts, and those guys can be the most despicable of people. I see 
them all the time in bars and restaurants, thinking their suits make them 
mature, arrogantly raising their voices, telling stupid childish jokes to 
each other, rambling in stockbroker jargon that they think impresses 
onlookers. And now, whenever that happens, I can smile to myself that someone 
else in the vicinity will have probably seen this movie, and will be laughing 
inside at what morons it shows them to be.</P>
