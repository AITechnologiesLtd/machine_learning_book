<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A complex contemporary horror flick based on a novel by Whitley
Strieber, that is slow in developing and when it becomes evident what's
happening there's more interest intellectually in what is uncovered than
thrills. New York City Detective, Captain Dewey Wilson (Finney), is
called in to investigate a mutilation murder of three people in Battery
Park. A wealthy real estate mogul, his cocaine-sniffing wife, and a
bodyguard, are killed by something that's not human but resembles a
wolf. The wisdom of the police higher-ups is that this is a political
terrorist group in action, so they assign criminal psychologist Rebecca
Neff (Venora) to help the captain.</P>
<P>When a drug-addict derelict is killed in an abandoned building in the
South Bronx, the coroner, Whittington (Hines), informs the detective
that the same hair is found on his body as in the Manhattan killings. He
also mentions that these animal killers must have superior knowledge
than we do, because they refuse to take the diseased parts of the body.
It takes the lab technicians, with the benefit of modern technology,
days to come to the same conclusion these beasts come up with on the
spur of the moment. Criminal pathologolist Ferguson (Noonan) clarifies
that these hairs are from wolves no longer common in America, they were
wiped out the same time the Native Americans were. He goes on to lecture
us that the wolf and Indian had similar cultures and habits, and learned
to live together in harmony.</P>
<P>In this baffling case where no clue is given to what is the actual
weapon of the killer, Detective Wilson is convinced that these grisly
murders weren't committed by a terrorist group and is open to the
suggestion of werewolves. Police Investigator Ross (Goetz) firmly
believes it was a political terrorist group, and brings in all sorts of
terrorist leaders for questioning and uses the lie detector to determine
their veracity.</P>
<P>On a hunch Dewey looks up an Indian activist he arrested for
manslaughter some years ago, Eddie Holt (Olmos), and the talkative
Indian is now working atop the George Washington bridge. He tells them
the legend of a supernatural species descended from Indian hunters who
went underground (they're living on Charlotte Street in the South Bronx
in abandoned buildings and churches). From what Eddie said, it's
apparent that these supernatural creatures, wolfen, feel threatened
because they are being uprooted from their homes in The Bronx due to
land development. The same landlord in The Bronx is the one in Wall
Street.</P>
<P>Wolfen plays as a modern update to the werewolf legend, as they are
portrayed in a sympathetic light. They are the victims in all this
modern upheaval while the ones they attack are seen as the savages.
There's much self-indulgent ecology to chew on, in this slickly filmed
surrealistic presentation. In any case, I found it easy to root for the
werewolves over the derelicts, millionaires, and arrogant police who
were victimized. But I found the film to be on the dull side (except for
the camera work).</P>
<P>Director Michael Wadleigh (Woodstock) uses distorted camera imaging to
film from the point-of-view of the wolves. Outstanding British
cinematographer Gerry Fisher does the honors of making this a very
stylish looking film, which gives the impression that something deeper
than what appears to be happening is taking place. All the camera shots
are presented in this manner, showing how the wolves can pick up man's
scent much quicker than he can theirs and their heat-seeking vision can
detect their quarry's body temperature. They cannot be vanquished; so I
guess the message is, that we better learn how to live with the
werewolf, they will always be with us. Hey, I'm willing to give it
shot...as I think Finney is, also.</P>
