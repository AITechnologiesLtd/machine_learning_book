<P>My Best Friend's Wedding is another marriage picture by Australian P.J.
Hogan whose warm, funny, original Muriel's Wedding was a hit, starting at
the 1994 Cannes Festival. This time Hogan is not so lucky.</P>
<P>I saw this film on Friday. As the end credits rolled by, I thought :"TGIF"
-- Thank God It's Finished. MBFW seems to be an attempt at a 90s screwball
romantic comedy, vaguely along the lines of much earlier ones.  But instead
of a crazy, outlandish structure, minutely plotted, diversified and with
strong  ensemble playing (think of Cary  Grant  gems such as His Girl
Friday and My Favorite Wife, both of 1940), this picture is made to
showcase Julia Roberts  at the expense of everything and everyone else.
Almost, that is.</P>
<P>The film's fourth banana, English actor Rupert Everett, salvages the show,
steals every scene he's in, even those in which he speaks to Roberts on
long-distance calls. Roberts plays Julianne, a New York food critic who
refers to "creme brulee" as "kraym broolay." Everett is George, her editor
and confidant. He is handsome, sexy, smart. He is also gay,which you
certainly wouldn't know if you hadn't been told from the start.</P>
<P>Nine years ago Julianne had a torrid but short affair with college-mate
Michael.  Julianne is no long-distance runner when it comes to
relationships, but the reasons why the twosome stopped are still not clear.
They switched to being best friends and such perfect soulmates that they
made a pact: if by the time they reached age 28 they had found no true
love, they would marry each other.</P>
<P>The time has come. Michael, now a sportswriter in Chicago, calls Julianne,
but instead of popping the question he announces feverishly that in four
days he will marry young college girl Kimmy, the daughter of Chicago
tycoon. He has such prenuptual jitters that Julianne simply must come and
lend support.</P>
<P>For Julianne this comes as an IRA bomb throw. It triggers in her the
absolute notion that Michael is the man of her life. She flies in,
ostensibly to help him, but in reality to get him away from Kimmy.</P>
<P>The film, always focused on Roberts, is the string of Julianne's
machiavellian machinations. She charms the eager fiancee ("You're my new
best friend" says naive Kimmy), worms her way into and works on everybody,
systematically diminishes Kimmy in Michael's eyes. A few of her strategies
are amusing, most are too cruel to be entertaining, as when she manoeuvers
tin-eared Kimmy into singing karaoke in a truly atrocious voice.The story
becomes increasingly phony, nonsensical and often verges on hysteria.</P>
<P>So-feminine Julianne is called Jules by her friends. It is a significant
detail. I am sure that the scriptwriter had His Girl Friday (1940) in mind.
That movie was a remake of The Front Page (1931), where two battling
Chicago newsmen were named respectively Walter Burns and Hildy Johnson. In
His Girl Friday Cary Grant plays editor Walter Burns and reporter Hildy
Johnson now becomes a woman (Rosalind Russell) and Walter's ex-wife. She's
currently engaged to Ralph Bellamy, whom Grant undermines and ridicules so
as to get Russell back, both as a star reporter and as his wife. There are
other parallels between MBFD and His Girl.</P>
<P>Julia Roberts is considered blessed by the tooth-fairy by many, and no
doubt beloved by dentists. She throws herself into her role body and soul,
but the script is incomplete about her character, and makes  her barefaced
tactics for the reconquest of Michael unappealing --even nasty.</P>
<P>Michael is namby-pamby, Kimmy is painfully immature, both lack personality,
both are credulous dim-bulbs and lambs too easily led to slaughter. Script
and performers seem to grope as to what might come next. There are hardly
any sparkling lines of dialogue, except for Rupert Everett's. Even then,
when he shows up in Chicago and tells a group that Jules went with so many
men "that she couldn't sit down for seven years," this indelicacy is out of
character for George. Still, far and away, the best part is when he poses
dashingly, convincingly and funnily as the fiance of Jules, and enchants
one and all.</P>
<P>The film becomes exponentially cynical, confused and incredible, including
many psychological as well as time-and-space impossibilities in the last
reel. The finale is a non-closure cop-out. The only touching scene is in a
corridor of the Drake Hotel, a quiet hiatus in which a passing bellman
called Richard gently tries to boost the morale of a despondent Julianne. I
think that the actor is Paul Giamatti.</P>
<P>That old movie subject --love-stricken people using strategies that will
lead to marriage-- is not very applicable today. In 1997 such romanticism
does not jibe with the rate of 54.8%  marriages ending in divorce. You
don't need statistics either to know how increasingly short-lived so many
marriages are. Julia Roberts and Lyle  Lovett were not an isolated case.
Sad but true,"'til death do us part" in movies has become a hard sell.</P>
