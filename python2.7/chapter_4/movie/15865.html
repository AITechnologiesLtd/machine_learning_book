<P>I entered the theater to see "The Faculty" with low expectations, but 
came out grinning. The sci-fi horror thriller, directed by Robert 
Rodriguez from "Scream" scribe Kevin Williamson's screenplay, is a brash, 
welcome throw-back to the days of American International drive-in flicks. 
Williamson's script, about teens who discover that aliens have taken over 
the bodies of their high school faculty, cheerfully cribs ideas from a 
load of different sources and jumbles them together quite nicely, 
creating a very entertaining diversion. Think "Dawson's Creek" meets "The 
Breakfast Club" meets "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" meets "Scooby-Doo" 
and you'll have some idea of what to expect. "The Faculty" is funny, 
scary, lurid, gross and cheesy in just the right places. </P>
<P>The film works because Kevin Williamson understands what a kick 
exploitation movies can be. He's smart enough to play with the genre 
without mocking it and bold enough to write some of the most reckless 
scenes I've witnessed onscreen in years. Like any good exploitation flick,
 "The Faculty" is every parent's worst nightmare. In order to save the 
world, Williamson's teen heroes are required to get high, drive like 
maniacs, run around with guns and kill authority figures. Irresponsible? 
Yes, indeed, and isn't it nice to see a writer with faith in young 
people's ability to vicariously enjoy forbidden acts without emulating 
them. </P>
<P>Our heroes are six teen archetypes, each with just enough detailing to 
feel genuine. Casey (Elijah Wood) is a sheepish nerd prone to tripping 
over his own feet. He has a major crush on head cheerleader/school paper 
editor Delilah (Jordana Brewster), who is only too happy to remind him 
that she is completely out of his league. The aptly-named Delilah breaks 
up with star quarterback and all-around good guy Stan (Shawn Hatosy) when 
he quits the team to focus on his studies, tersely explaining that she 
dated him solely because of his place in the student hierarchy. But Stan 
has a secret admirer in sullen goth bookworm Stokey (Clea Duvall), a 
withdrawn girl who poses as a lesbian, hoping the pretense will cause 
typically homophobic classmates to steer clear of her. </P>
<P>On the fringes of this urban "Dawson's Creek" quartet is wholesome new 
girl in school, Marybeth (Laura Harris) and Zeke (Josh Hartnett), a 
dealer in fake I.D.'s, bogus videotapes and homemade designer drugs. With 
his ambling gait and chronic bed-head hair, Zeke reminded me of the 
beatnik kid from the "Scooby-Doo" cartoons. In fact, the story's teen 
sleuths were so reminiscent of the "Scooby-Doo" gang that I half-expected 
the film to end with an alien leader exclaiming "My plan would have 
worked if it wasn't for those meddling kids!"    </P>
<P>Drugs, dangerous driving, and guns aside, "The Faculty" does carry a 
tacit positive message, showing that for our world to survive, people 
must set aside their differences and work together. And these kids need 
the power of unity, because in addition to the alien menace, they're 
facing a formidable adult cast.</P>
<P>As the school principal, Bebe Neuwirth is sexy and lethal; a murderous 
variant of her Lilith character from "Cheers" and "Frasier." Robert 
Patrick is terrific as the brutal football coach, his juiciest part since 
"Terminator 2." Patrick's perverse alien smile is even scarier than his 
pre-invasion drill sergeant rants. Both actors make the proceedings all 
the more creepy because their characters actually seem to enjoy being 
possessed. Piper Laurie, Salma Hayek, Jon Stewart, and Daniel von Bargen 
also turn in spirited performances, and Famke Janssen steams up the 
screen as a drab, repressed English teacher transformed into a beautiful 
seductress; a twisted spin on "My Fair Lady," with an alien slug serving 
as her Henry Higgins. Janssen is also the central figure in the film's 
most enjoyably over-the-top special effects scene, a great cornball 
homage to John Carpenter's "The Thing."</P>
<P>As usual, Williamson liberally peppers his script with pop culture 
references, but they seem less self-conscious here than in some of his 
other works. When the teens begin to explore the whole alien parasite 
theory, it's only natural that they look to science fiction for insight, 
speculating that the old axiom "write what you know" might even apply to 
the authors of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" or "The Puppet Masters." </P>
<P>Director Robert Rodriguez keeps the film moving at a nice clip, neatly 
balancing laughs, gross-out scenes and "Night of the Living Dead" style 
claustrophobic dread as he builds to a climax that is at once campy and 
intense. Then, to cap things off, Kevin Williamson tweaks contemporary 
horror clichés with a nifty closing scene most notable for what it 
doesn't do. Lurid, high-spirited and unapologetic, "The Faculty" is great 
trashy fun. I only wish I could have watched it at a drive-in.</P>
