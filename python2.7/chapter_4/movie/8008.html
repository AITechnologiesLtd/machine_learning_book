<P>Con Air is a strange marriage indeed. It combines the criminal
chic movie recently updated by Quentin Tarrantino a la
Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction with the heroic but tragically
mistreated military man brought to us only last year in
Bruckheimer's The Rock. How can you put together a basically
moral, sympathetic hero with a bunch of America's worst
criminals and have the audience like them all, all at the same
time? The answer, as Con Air shows, is to just do it - embrace
the incongruities!</P>
<P>The plot centers around the misfortune of one Cameron Poe,
an ex Army Ranger, who is sent to the bighouse for killing a
man who attacked his pregnant wife. So unfair!!! After serving
his time, Poe is loaded onto a US Marshalls Service flight for
transport home. As chance would have it, that flight is also
filled with some of the worst criminals currently warehoused
in the US prison system - all on their way to a new
mega-maximum security facility. Cyrus "The Virus" Grissom
leads the cons in revolt and takes over the plane. Poe's
homecoming is irrevocably delayed!</P>
<P>The plot setup for this film is certainly its worst element. A
good deal of time is essentially wasted at the outset of this
picture, during which Poe's character is elaborated. Poe, of
course, is going to need lots of equipment for his flight, so he is
gifted with special training with the US Army Rangers (twice
decorated, if I recall), a very strong but easily bruised sense of
loyalty, and a secure place in society (his lovely family). An
eight year prison term brings him completely up to spec. Each
of these details is laboriously presented and remarked upon, as
if they might be difficult for the audience to understand. Such
an introduction, if better handled, would be appropriate for a
more complex character and I can't help but wonder if there
was originally some intention to make the movie a little more
suspenseful, to make Poe's choice of what to do on the plane a
little more difficult, but there is never really a moment's doubt.
Although Poe and his wife make a couple of remarks about his
"problem" - an overweaning pride or something - nothing
much materializes out of this particular thread.</P>
<P>The criminal mayhem wreaked by Cyrus and his many cronies
gets the movie up to action speed and maintains it for much of
the remainder of the picture. Each of the criminals set free on
the flight comes from a familiar mould. Cyrus seems to be
something of a cross between Jack Nicholson's Joker and the
Unabomber, and is brought to the screen via the standard John
Malkovich performance a la Mitch Leary from In the Line of
Fire. Garland Greene is an obvious imitation of Hannibal
Lector, although Buscemi wisely steers clear of outright
impersonation. You get the idea: a hit parade of murderers,
rapists, etc. Fortunately, each of these characters is played
knowingly and energetically and it is quite clear that no one is
taking them seriously. Even the long-suffering Poe, who could,
in theory, easily end up dead on this flight just shrugs as he
helps the cops and his friend get out alive, making only the
observation,</P>
<PRE>       Somehow, they managed to get every creep and
       freak in the universe on this one plane.</PRE>
<P>Funny how that happens! The various policemen chasing the
escaping cons also know their parts. Duncan Malloy is a rabid
DEA G-man whose solution to everything is fast cars and a hail
of gunfire, whereas Vince Larkin is the sandal-wearing
college-boy who quotes Dostoevsky but has a stout heart.</P>
<P>So, everyone knows which side of Con Air's bread is buttered,
and most of the movie is spent listening to amusing dialog and
observing the planes and bullets flying and stuff blowing up.
Perhaps to make up for its slow start, the movie concludes with
no less than three action-packed endings! First the plane
crashes at Lerner field, then it crashes again in Las Vegas, at
which point the action switches to a fire engine which then
crashes elsewhere in Las Vegas. The crashes are spaced out by
lots of chasing, fighting, gunfire and explosions. (Something
about Nicolas Cage and Las Vegas...I don't know.) Finally, there
is the inevitable and thankfully brief reunion between Poe and
his wife and daughter. Anyway, Bruckheimer has taken the
basic elements of the action picture and simply put more of
them on screen. The presentation is generally deft, efficient,
and effective, making Con Air a serviceable entry in the action
picture genre.</P>
<P>The action is interleaved with some occasional attempts at
suspense, as when Poe's true, good intentions are nearly
exposed in flight, and when Greene is given the opportunity to
murder a small child. Suspense aimed at Poe is brief and
quickly comes to nothing, whereas Greene's encounter with
the little girl threatens to wreck the tongue-in-cheek feel of the
whole movie. Fortunately, Greene does not murder the girl
and the whole episode is made subject of an awkward joke, but
it does serve to demonstrate the frailty of the movie's
understanding with the audience. As if to remind everyone of
this tacit agreement, the movie ends with Greene enjoying an
umbrella drink at a roulette table, followed by portraits of the
main cast members smiling for the camera as the credits roll.
"Just kidding, remember!"</P>
<P>In a recent interview, Nicolas Cage remarked that he did Con
Air because he feels he hasn't perfected the art of the action
picture. Well, Con Air certainly has more explosions, gunfire,
and chases than, say, The Rock (but "that's just a rock"), and
Cage plays a tougher character in this one. I'm not convinced
that such changes represent progress, however, even for the
action picture genre. Con Air is a competently professional
piece of work, but plays out a very thin and limited concept
without leaving Cage with any obvious avenue of
development. Mind you, if he does end up playing Superman
next year, he'll be able to endure even more insults and
explosions than he did in this outing.</P>
