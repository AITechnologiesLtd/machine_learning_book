<PRE>Review: The Hurricane (1999)
By: Matt Petras</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: *** out of ****
Length: 155 minutes</PRE>
<P>Cast: Denzel Washington, Vicellous Reon Shannon, Deborah Unger, Leiv
Schreiber, John Hannah and Dan Hedaya
Director: Norman Jewison
Producer(s): Armyan Berstein, Norman Jewison, and John Ketcham</P>
<P>        As an up and coming boxer, Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter, had a lot
of things going for him and it looked like things in his life were on
the up and up until he was wrongfully imprisoned for murder. Ending up
spending many years in jail, trying in vain to get his sentence and
wrongful conviction overturned. This movie is the story of his life.
The movie is based on a true story about a real man and is quite
touching and surprisingly doesn't deviate from the truth other than
for some artistic leeway (a Hollywood first). </P>
<P>        There is some great acting in this movie especially on the
part of Denzel Washington, he manages to capture the role of Rubin
Carter perfectly and makes the movie magical. He manages to portray
the real person as well as the character that is in the script he is
given admirably. Aside from Denzel Washington the remainder of the
cast portray their roles very well and bring out the warm characters
that are involved in this story as well as some of the truly harsh and
evil ones.  The casting for the roles in this movie is great everyone
fit their role perfectly; the movie is an example of what casting for
a movie should be like. The whole cast gives the movie a very real
quality that it needed to have in order to be credible.  </P>
<P>        Now, this movie is quite long being just under three hours so
that's my warning to anyone who can't sit for that long. Regardless of
length the pacing in the movie keeps you interested the whole time
(and we'll ignore the one guy who was happily sleeping when the movie
ended). The pace was perfect I didn't want to get up to stretch my
legs even and that is rare for a movie this long. </P>
<P>        I like the portrayal of both the jail and the racially tense
atmosphere that is brought out during the course of the movie. The
racial atmosphere changes as time progresses and this is true with
reality, things became more tolerant as time passed with pockets of
hate still existing. This is nothing new and it exists in reality,
this was a good feature to make visible as it gave the movie a grander
more realistic feel to it.  I also like how the jail cell that Ruben
Carter was kept in changed along with the conditions of the jail. Time
doesn't stand still for anyone and things change over time as this the
case in reality the jail changed and the conditions that the inmates
were kept in changed. This attention to detail gives the movie a
certain quality that is often lacking in movies today.</P>
<P>All in all, The Hurricane is a whirlwind ride of a movie that takes us
through the life of a man that was horribly wronged by the system. I
highly recommend it, its informative and thoughtful as well as very
well done and a pleasure to watch. The movie also points out the
importance of being literate. Its definitely one of the best of the
year, well last year now, and I think that it should get some of the
credit it deserves. Good Luck at the Oscars!</P>
