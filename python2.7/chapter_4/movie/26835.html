<P>As cynical satires go, there is nothing as audacious, thought-provoking and 
scary as "Dr. Strangelove," Stanley Kubrick's superb film on what if the 
United States and Russia were involved in an accidental nuclear attack, and 
what if it was the fault of the U.S.</P>
<P>The unstable, loony General Jack D. Ripper (played by the commanding, 
towering presence of Sterling Hayden) is the C.O. of the Burlepson Air Force 
Base who has access to the code that can send an SAC (Strategic Air Command) 
wing on its way to bomb Russia. The general initiates the order to bomb 
Russia, but the irony is that no immediate war is taking place and Russia has 
no intention of bombing the U.S., though they have every intention to 
counterattack with their prodigious Doomsday Machine. This is cause for 
concern at the Pentagon where the President of the U.S. (Peter Sellers) has a 
meeting in the War Room trying to pinpoint why this unplanned attack was 
initiated. The President is joined by an ex-Nazi strategic adviser, Dr. 
Strangelove (again played brilliantly by Peter Sellers), and the stubborn 
General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott), the head of the Joint Chief of 
Staff, among other officials. General Buck sees no harm in destroying the 
Commies and risking the lives of innocent people whereas Dr. St
rangelove sees a future where mine shafts will have to be utilized to 
accomodate the population before being affected by radiation ("Ten women to 
every man.") In the meantime, the President calmly explains to the Soviet 
Premier that it all boils down to a crazy man who went and "did a funny 
thing."  </P>
<P>"Dr. Strangelove" was released back in 1964 at the height of the Cuban 
Missile Crisis when nuclear missiles were a worlwide threat - a "Fail-Safe" 
error could possibly happen and there is nothing in the film that exaggerates 
that possibility. That is why it was so controversial - the satire in it bit 
everyone loud and clear. In fact, outside of 1983's "Testament," "Dr. 
Strangelove" is one example of what can go wrong in a nuclear crisis and why 
all nuclear weapons should be disarmed. We may be at peace with Russia now 
but back then, the potential for such a disaster was a strong reality (in a 
sense, it could happen today since nuclear weapons still exist).    </P>
<P>The suspense builds and becomes wire-tight in the hands of director Kubrick, 
who helmed the similarly chaotic, suspenseful "The Killing" - both films 
dependent on time as a factor in a crisis. Here, it becomes a chaos for the 
audience since the attack is inevitable unless the code is revealed to recall 
the several nuclear-armed planes. One of them is led by the B-52 pilot, Major 
"King" Kong (Slim Pickens), who reminds his crew that medals and promotions 
will be handed out when all is said and done. Naturally, Kong has his 
reservations about the deliberate attack, but his questioning it is reserved 
in favor of his patriotic duty, even if it means to literally ride on one of 
those bombs himself. </P>
<P>General Ripper, however, has no intention of revealing the code, especially 
to the British military attache (also played by Sellers), and they have a 
couple of humorous scenes together where Ripper explains that distilled water 
and preservation of bodily fluids is essential in the face of the Russians 
who want to control everything. </P>
<P>"Dr. Strangelove" is an anti-war, anti-nuclear weapons statement done with 
biting humor and bitter irony, but it is more effective than Sidney Lumet's 
serious "Fail-Safe" because it takes such a no-holds-barred approach with its 
satirical pull. As Kubrick said while writing the film with Terry Southern 
("Candy"), "the things you laugh at most are really the heart of the 
paradoxical postures that make a nuclear war possible." From its phallic 
symbols of B-52 planes to the sexual connotations of Ripper's philosophies 
and General Buck's relationship with his secretary ("Of course, it is not 
just physical") to the hysteria and absurdity in the War Room (a memorable 
set piece), "Dr. Strangelove" pokes fun but remains scarily real - the threat 
and the inevitable doom of nuclear fallout is felt from first frame to last. 
Like Kubrick's  "A Clockwork Orange," you are left unsure whether to laugh or 
to take it seriously. But when you hear Vera Lynn's "We'll Meet Again," you 
can feel Kubrick's pathos of a world at war 
with itself.  </P>
