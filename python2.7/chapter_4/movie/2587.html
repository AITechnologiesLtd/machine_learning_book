<PRE>                                  SIRENS
                       A film review by David Cowan
                        Copyright 1994 David Cowan</PRE>
<P>     SIRENS has been spoken of highly by critics as being a rare mix: a
film that is just as intellectually appealing as it is titillating.
Given the promise of the much ballyhooed nude appearance by Elle
MacPherson, it would seem that if SIRENS could live up to that sort of
praise, it would be one heckuva film.  Amazingly enough, the film turns
out to be considerably more intellectually appealing than
titillating--the film does a good job of exploring the theme of whether
censorship of obscene or blasphemous art is beneficial to the would-be
viewer of that art.  However, the film drags so much in the second and
third acts as to make it overall only a bit better than the average
coming-of-age or sexual awakening film.</P>
<P>     Hugh Grant stars as Antony Campion, a young British priest who is
sent by the Anglican Church to discuss the showing of a painting
featuring Venus being crucified at a Sydney exhibition with the artist,
Norman Lindsay (an underused Sam Neill).  The church would like to see
Lindsay's art displayed, but object to that particular painting, and it
is Campion's task to convince Lindsay to substitute it with another,
less blasphemous painting.  Campion and his frigid wife, Estella,
travel to Australia to meet with Lindsay.  They arrive at his estate
where they find he lives not only with his wife and two daughters, but
three models.  Two of the models embarrass the Campions with their
brazen attitudes towards sex, nudity, the bourgeois, and eating cheese
with one's hands.  The third, Giddy, is a young innocent who won't pose
with her clothes off.</P>
<P>     Lindsay and Campion argue about the censorship of art--or
rather, Campion does.  Lindsay throughout the entire film shows only an
air of bemusement to his guests, simply continuing with his work and
not backing down to the church's requests.  Campion tries his hardest
to argue for the church with a "non-fundamentalist", contemporary point
of view hoping to reach Lindsay, but he ultimately fails miserably.
Campion believes that the displaying of such offensive work as
Lindsay's would make a permanent impression in the mind of the viewer
and corrupt them.  Lindsay and his cronies believe that to be
nonsense.</P>
<P>     In the meantime, the Campions learn they must stay another week at
the Lindsay's, the train they were to travel back on has derailed, and
the track needed to be rebuilt.  Estella, while they wait at the
Lindsays, gets to know the models and, while originally repulsed by
their attitudes and actions, slowly begins to warm to their views on
life, love and sex--and ends up having a affair with the blind
handyman.</P>
<P>     The film never breaks from its investigation of the two different
lifestyles and views on sex, nudity and blasphemy portrayed by the two
families--often this theme takes on a ironic nature and is fascinating
and ultimately thought-provoking.  However, when the film gets into
Estella's "awakening," and she goes from being frigid to being one of
Lindsay's sirens, the film loses a lot of its drive.  We've all seen
the image of the frigid schoolmarm or librarian seduced into letting
her hair down a hundred times, and SIRENS doesn't put a new spin on
it.  We follow this thread of the story for almost half of the film,
and it gets tiring and predictable.  The main driving force of the
story is Antony Campion, and while Estella's sexual awakening is
necessary to the plot, one leaves wishing there had been more plot or
discussion and less of Estella's inane, unexiting fantasizing or sexual
encounters.</P>
<P>     The acting is uniformly good, especially the surprisingly good
performance by Elle MacPherson.  MacPherson's brazen model is so
abrasive as to be stomach churning at times, and shows her character to
be significantly more than a brainless body.  Sam Neill's tired,
bemused performance as Lindsay is well performed, though he is on the
screen very little--it is like his character in UNTIL THE END OF THE
WORLD ... his character is a guiding force of the film but appears very
little.  Hugh Grant as Anthony Campion is just right as the
contemporary young priest, getting enthused and perturbed over all the
right things, all the while displaying a peculiar innocence.  Only Tara
Fitzgerald's unexciting Estella and the mindlessly bad acting of
whoever the blind handyman was (reducing the performance to that of one
of those robo-hunks in soft-core porn) were standouts in an otherwise
good cast.</P>
<P>     Ultimately, I wish the plot would have gotten more into characters
that are presented as being interesting--Lindsay and the models are
fascinating sketches of characters, but we fail to get into them
because the film spends too much time with Estella.  However the
symbolism presented in the film, the subtle ironies of the plot, and
the theme of the film kept me thinking about it long after I had left
the theatre, so it certainly wasn't a waste.  I just wish that the
parts meant to be seductive and sensual were as well done as the parts
which were mentally stimulating.</P>
<P>     5 out of 10.  SIRENS had a chance of being an excellent film,
but squanders that chance in foreign art-film coming-of-age pretension.</P>
