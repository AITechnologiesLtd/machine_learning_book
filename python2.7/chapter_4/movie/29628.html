<PRE>                         SERENDIPITY
               A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>    CAPSULE: Familiar-feeling romantic comedy from director Peter 
    Chelsom.  Two people meet, like each other, and leave to fate 
    if they should meet again.  Years later each decides they 
    should be together and start searching for each other with 
    very standard sorts of results.  Fluffy and a lot like things 
    you have seen before.  Rating: 5 (0 to 10), low +1 (-4 to +4)  </P>
<P>A few years ago there was a light romantic comedy called THE NIGHT 
WE NEVER MET.  The point of that film was that two people whom the 
viewer knows are fated to find each other keep missing each other 
by inches.  SERENDIPITY is a reworking of that idea.  It is a 
story of Fate working overtime to have its two main characters 
meet.  Each time the dramatic tension is greater and each time it 
is another near miss.</P>
<P>In a prolog Jonathan Trager (played by John Cusack) and Sara 
Thomas (the attractive Kate Beckinsale of PEARL HARBOR) meet in 
Bloomingdales when each wants to buy the same pair of gloves.  
There is immediate attraction, but each goes his own way.  Then 
the two come together again.  Is it fate that is bringing them 
together?  Sara suggests they test it.  She writes her name and 
address in a book, Jonathan writes his name on the back of a five-
dollar bill.  Sara sells the book Jonathan spends the bill.  Will 
fate bring them back together?  Flash forward a few years and both 
are making plans to be married but neither is totally happy with 
his intended.  Each remembers the one that got away.  Each decides 
to give fate another chance.</P>
<P>Marc Klein's screenplay gives us a pleasurable and amusing froth 
of a romantic comedy, if a little too predictable and undemanding 
to plot.  It is easy enough to come up with any number of 
situations in which people just barely miss each other.  That 
builds a tension of sorts, but the audience has strong 
expectations how it will all turn out.  The viewer knows fate 
rules the lives of the characters since in this case the hand of 
fate is Marc Klein.</P>
<P>Few of the attempts at style or humor work.  Eugene Levy plays 
officious clerk who is more irritating than funny.  Worse to 
create a romantic effect director Peter Chelsom has not just music 
but songs on the music track.  Notable is a cameo role for Buck 
Henry.  There are also several opportunities to fit in the ever-
popular New York City landmarks.</P>
<P>This is a lighthearted and frivolous romantic comedy that will not 
have a lot of appeal beyond audiences specifically looking that 
sort of film.  In other words, though it is a cliche, this is a 
film for people who like this sort of thing.  I rate it a 5 on the 
0 to 10 scale and a low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
