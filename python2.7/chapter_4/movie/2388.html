<PRE>                                    INTERSECTION
                       A film review by Michael John Legeros
                        Copyright 1994 Michael John Legeros</PRE>
<P>Directed by Mark Rydell
Starring Richard Gere, Sharon Stone, and Lolita Davidovich.</P>

<P>     The sole virtue of INTERSECTION, the high-profile, low-interest
remake of the 1970 French drama LES CHOSE DE LA VIE, is one, bonafide
great hook.</P>
<P>     Said hook comes at the beginning and it's ripe for the picking:
Vancouver architect Vincent Eastman (Gere) is about to have a nasty
collision with either a minibus, a logging truck, or both.  Mere
moments before the impact, Vincent's life flashes before his eyes.</P>
<PRE>     (Which, for the audience, means a flashback that lasts the
     *entire* film!)</PRE>
<P>     Unfortunately, what passes for Vincent's life is already
dead-on-arrival.</P>
<P>     The story goes that Vincent is recently separated from wife and
business partner Sally (Stone).  He's living with a journalist
(Davidovich), but he hasn't resolved his feelings for either woman.
He's sitting on the proverbial fence and the film--courtesy of
imbedded flashbacks--shows how he got on the fence in the first
place.</P>
<P>     As accurately as INTERSECTION portrays a man in transition between
spouses, the story makes for lousy drama.  The characters are
unflattering and there's no passion to the proceedings.  This is "carpe
dullem"--seize the exit!</P>
<P>     With such a who-cares story, the only remaining allure is in the
window-dressing.  But even the bells and whistles get botched in this
one.</P>
<P>     The British Columbia locales are nice and safe and maybe too
clean.  The lighting and cinematography is also very pretty, which
helps to scrub away any grit from the surface of this story.  Coupled
to such a too-handsome cast, it's hard to sell this drama as
believable.</P>
<P>     Of the three leads, only Stone does anything worth watching.  She
gets a great ice-queen role that may win her notice.  Even if her
scenes are scarce.</P>
<P>     Put it all together and you get a film that seems trapped in a
bizarre nether-realm between safe and sorry.</P>
<P>     With a little more ham, this could've been a great Bad Movie.  A
contrived confrontation between Davidovich and Stone already sticks out
like a sore thumb.  Other close-to-camp moments include Landau's "time
is short" speech, an obvious stunt-double wrecking Gere's car, and
Davidovich's "delivery" of the Year's Best Breast Joke.</P>
<P>     The filmmakers could also have gone the other way.  With a little
narrative juggling and some clearer characterization, they could've
refined this mess into something memorable.</P>
<PRE>     As it stands, it's hardly worth watching.</PRE>
<PRE>Bottom line: Other than a great promotional film for highway safety,
             INTERSECTION is just another stop on the Road to
             Dullsville (pop. 3).  Wait 'till video.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: C</PRE>
