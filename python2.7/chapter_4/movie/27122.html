THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Disney's THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE, directed by Mark Dindal (CAT'S DON'T 
DANCE), is a throwback to those old cartoon movies with silly, paper 
thin plots and wisecracking characters.  Without any pretensions and 
without wasting much time trying to entertain the adults in the 
audience, the movie is as carefully targeted to its intended 
demographics as a Saturday morning cartoon series.  Any kid younger than 
13 will undoubtedly love it.  Older viewers may be less impressed, but 
it's a hard film to dislike.  Even if there may be few outright laughs, 
the story keeps a smile on your face.</P>
<P>David Spade (LOST & FOUND) plays the leading part of the egotistical 
Emperor Kuzco.  It is a part that manages to take advantage of David 
Spade's limited talents.  Kuzco considers it part of his birthright to 
be able to abuse the peasants of his kingdom.  He continues to do so 
even after his nemesis, Yzma (Eartha Kitt), turns him into a llama.</P>
<P>One such peasant is a llama herder named Pacha (John Goodman).  Kuzco 
wants to wipe out Pacha's village so that he can build Kuzcotopia, a 
summer home that looks like a water-based amusement park.  In one of the 
story's funniest scenes, Kuzco stops the action so that he can remind us 
that the story is about him.  To illustrate this point he uses a marker 
to draw a big circle around himself and to obliterate Pacha.  Following 
the standard buddy movie formula, Kuzco and Pacha are a pair of 
squabbling characters who eventually come to respect and help each 
other.</P>
<P>Perhaps the story's best character is Yzma's right hand man, Kronk 
(Patrick Warburton), a square jawed hunk that looks like Gaston from 
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.  Kronk, who speaks fluent squirrel, is low on IQ 
and common sense.  His shoulder-based devil and angel figures who advise 
him are as stupid as he is.  He does, however, make great spinach puffs.</P>
<P>Feeling in tone much like DreamWorks' THE ROAD TO EL DORADO, THE 
EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE doesn't break any new ground, but it is diverting 
for the adults and fun for the kids.  My personal favorite part of the 
movie is the map shown to trace the character's progress on their way 
back to the palace.  It is a plot device that we don't see much any 
more.  Like most of the rest of the picture, it brought a smile to my 
face even if it didn't generate any outright laughs.</P>
<P>THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE runs a fast 1:20.  It is rated G and is fine 
for all ages.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 11, saw the film with most of his sixth grade class, 
who liked the picture.  I interviewed 4 of them afterwards.  Jeffrey and 
Rajiv gave it *** 1/2, and John and Maxim gave it ****.  They thought 
the film was funny and had a cute plot.  They liked the way that the 
Emperor kept reminding us that the story was about him.  Their favorite 
characters were Kronk, Kuzco and the cat.</P>
