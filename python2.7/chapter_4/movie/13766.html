<P>   When Dan Quayle was campaigning for the presidency, he
was advised to make a good-will trip to Latin America,
presumbly to capture the votes of people from those lands
now living in the U.S.  He reportedly demurred: "How can I
give speeches there?  I don't even speak Latin!"  Too bad. 
When the former vice president does learn enough of the
language, perhaps there's a place for him as mayor of Rio de
Janeiro.  Family values are sorely needed there, even more
than they are in his home country.  If a kid has no parents or
relatives willing to take him in, he's not likely to be picked up
by a welfare organization.  It's life on the streets with a career
as a petty thief.  Things could be worse, though.  Given the
lack of respect accorded to young street people, he could be
shot by police for no particular reason or beaten up just for
the heck of it.  "Central Station," a Brazilian film which has
made the rounds of the festivals including Sundance and
Berlin, is a remarkable study of an unfortunate kid and how
he is saved by a most unlikely benefactor.  Directed by Walter
Salles, heretofore known more as a documentary film maker
than a story teller, "Central Station" is a poignant road movie
about the unlikely friendship between a cynical sixty-seven
year old woman and a nine year old boy she meets outside
Rio's principal train station.</P>
<P>   The two leads are as implausible a combination as the
people they play. The part of the aging woman, Dora, is
performed by Brazil's most celebrated actress, Fernanda
Montenegro, while her counterpart, the 10-year-old Josue, is
rendered by a Vinicius de Oliveira who not only had no acting
experience but had not even been inside a movie theater. 
(Oliveria won the part against a field of 1500 lads and what's
more he prevailed by accident: the director ran into him, a
shoe shine boy at a small airport in the center of Rio, and
was asked to help him to buy a sandwich, promising to return
the money when Salles came back from Sao Paolo.)</P>
<P>   The story opens on Dora, a retired elementary school
teacher, who works as a scribe outside Rio's Central Station. 
Catering to a largely poor and illiterate clientele, she writes
letters which they dictate to her, charging one dollar each for
her services, but she has such contempt for her customers
that she later trashes ninety percent of the mail.  When a
woman, accompanied by her son Josue, is hit by a bus and
killed, Dora takes the boy temporarily to her home, then sells
him unwittingly for one thousand dollars to a man who intends
to have the kid killed, his organs sold to rich clients in the
west.  When Dora hears of the scheme from her neighbor
Irene (Marilia Pera), she abducts Josue from the criminal's
home and takes him by bus on a long journey to locate his
father, a drunk who had run away from the family some time
earlier.</P>
<P>    Manipulating the trenchant screenplay by Joao Emanuel
Carneiro and Marcos Bernstein and jogging the emotions with
a robust piano sound track, Salles takes us from Rio to a
poor, dusty, but developing town located in one of the
countless rural backwater areas of the huge country.  On the
way she and the boy develop a profound affection for each
other, with Dora regaining the human feelings she had lost
years back after retiring from her profession.  Virtually all the
people we meet on the road are dirt poor, many deeply
religious.  In one scene designed to demonstrate Dora's
renewed feeling of romance, she and Josue meet a deeply
religious truck driver who gives them a lift and feeds the
penniless pair until he is scared off by Dora's affectionate
overtures.  Cameraman Walter Carvalho is particularly adept
at capturing a variety of sharply etched faces among Brazil's
poor: a truckload of Evangelical women who gather and sing
to a patron saint; and a succession of illiterates who compose
letters for Dora.  While the story is not likely to be acclaimed
for broad humor, Dora keeps her neighbor engrossed in tales
of her customers.  One of them writes that he had been
following the personals columns and that the recipient is the
only woman he is interested in. (He wrote the same letter to
ten women.)  One woman wants to return to her abusive
husband, but Dora refuses to send the letter because she
does not wish to have a part in the beating this customer was
in for.</P>
<P>   Fernanda Montenegro is a seasoned actress who turns in
an expected ardent performance.  But Vinicius de Oliveira is a
true find, an unpretentious, wholly natural young man who
does his part like a child star nurtured on years of training. 
The film does shows Brazilians as both good and bad people,
in one case portraying the senseless shooting of a youthful
thief by adults who'd as soon kill these young toughs as look
at them.  The movie does best in exploring the growing
friendship between its two disparate principals but is not as
successful in expanding the theme to demonstrate that Brazil
is a country in transition.  It is a personal story, albeit often
airless, and one likely to be seen as Brazil's entry to the 1998
Academy Awards competition.  </P>
