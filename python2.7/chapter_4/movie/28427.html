<PRE>UNDER THE SAND
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 2001 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Ask me to name a Charlotte Rampling film off the top of my head and I'd be
hard pressed to come up with one, save for Liliana Cavani's controversial
1974 film "The Night Porter" (in which Rampling made a bit of a name for
herself by playing a concentration camp survivor who resumes the
sadomasochistic relationship with her former SS officer, played by Dirk
Bogarde).  But other titles do not as easily spring to mind.  Strange
really, since Rampling has made over 50 films in her 35-year film career.</P>
<P>One look at her latest film, François Ozon's "Under the Sand" ("Sous le
Sable"), and you'll be wondering why she's not more of a household name.</P>
<P>In the film, which pairs the oceanographics of Ozon's 1997 thriller "See
the Sea" ("Regarde la Mer") with the emotional turbulence of Liv Ullman's
recent marital drama "Faithless" ("Trolösa"), Rampling plays a woman, an
English professor, struggling to come to grips with the (assumed) death of
her husband.</P>
<P>Vacationing in the south of France, Marie Drillon (Rampling's given name
as it so happens) and Jean (Bruno Cremer) head down to the beach one
morning.  While Marie remains sunbathing on the sand, Jean takes to the
ocean, but the next time Marie looks up from her book, Jean cannot be found
and is feared drowned.</P>
<P>Marie is so devastated by the loss that she quickly falls into a pattern
of self-denial, acting as though her husband of 25 years were still alive.
This makes life understandably awkward for her friends, her family, and her
future lovers </P>
<P>Ozon positively dumps the emotional weight of the film on Rampling's
delicate frame and she's more than up to the task.  Often without words,
the 56-year-old British actress (who's still not afraid to do nude scenes)
is able to convey a woman simply unable to face the loss of her beloved
husband.  Strangely enough, although Rampling's performance is second to
none, the character of Marie, while convincing, remains emotionally remote.
 By denying her husband's demise, she quickly puts up a wall around
herself, making it hard for anyone--and especially the audience--to relate
on an emotional level.</P>
<P>The director does, however, use an interesting technique in showing us
Marie's inability to accept the truth: Jean appears as an entity, a living,
breathing human being in Marie's lonely Paris apartment, even though it's
clear he's merely a figment of his wife's hopeful imagination.</P>
<P>"Under the Sand" is an interesting film in that slow, talky, Mediterranean
way, in which little happens in terms of plot development but a lot happens
in the mind and motivations of its central character.  It's cool and
calculated and rather straightforward but every time Rampling's on display
it seems better, somehow.  "Under the Sand" may be the impetus she needs to
stage a comeback, much like what Terence Stamp did with "The Limey," or
what Ben Kingsley, another "forgotten" actor, seems to be shooting for with
the upcoming "Sexy Beast."</P>
<P>Only time and talent (of which Ms. Rampling appears to have acres) will tell.</P>
