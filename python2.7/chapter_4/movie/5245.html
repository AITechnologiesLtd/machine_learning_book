<PRE>                          SOMEONE ELSE'S AMERICA
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     In this beautifully told story of two immigrants and their
families in America,  we feel the difficulties they encounter, the
homesickness, the troubles they must endure.  Despite that, the film
has its many humorous moments in between the pathos.  That the
direction and acting, as well as the story, are so good make this one
of the year's better films.</P>
<P>     Alonso (Tom Conti) is a legal immigrant from Mexico, supporting
his blind mother (Maria Casares) who yearns for Spain, her homeland.
Alonso's  income is from a  small bar he owns, the Paradiso, in a poor
neighborhood in Brooklyn.  Employed  at the bar, and living there, is
Bayo (Miki Manojlovic) who is from the faraway land of Montenegro.
Unlike Alonso, Bayo is here illegally.  Of the pittance he earns in
various other small jobs, he sends money back home to his mother, Anja
(Zorka Manojlovic) so she can take care of his three children.
However, he is unaware that his mother is not receiving the money and
that his children are heartbroken at their father's absence.</P>
<P>     The youngest daughter, Savka (Andjela Stojkovic) is ill with
yearning, the youngest son, Pepe (Lazar Kalmic) is a dear boy, but the
oldest son Luka, (Sergei Trifunovic) is a rebel always in trouble with
the authorities.   Grandma Anja decides that only by taking them to
America can she handle the problems caused by the  lack of money and
her ability to care for her three grandchildren.    The trip to the
U.S., via Mexico. and the attempt at illegal entry engender the
saddest part of the film as in crossing the Rio Grande, Pepe loses his
treasured accordion, lets go of the rope that directs them to the U.S.
and, a non-swimmer, goes after the accordion..   His father Bayo will
not believe the child has drowned and will not give up the search for
him, shouting "PEPE!  PEPE!"  as he walks along the shore.</P>
<P>     Alonso and Bayo are from two different worlds but their
friendship  is binding.    This bonding and the smaller stories that
are in the film make it one that you will savor, that you will not
soon forget..    Do not miss this unassuming little gem..</P>
