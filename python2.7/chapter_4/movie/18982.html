<P>   If Disney's latest animated feature were regarded from
Jane's point of view, it would be subtitled, "The Swinger Who
Shagged Me."  Further, if the lead character--the only human
being not yet a member of America Online--were to sign up,
his screen name would be <A HREF="mailto:Tarzan48@aol.com.">Tarzan48@aol.com.</A> Proving that
sequels need not always be downhill runs, this "Tarzan" will
attract its audience of millions for its qualitative differences
from all previous ape-man stories, as this one utilizes no
human beings, no gorillas, and no people dressed in simian
raiment.  Every moment of its run combines computer-
generated imagery with traditional drawings, seamlessly
bound to defy the audience to distinguish between them.</P>
<P>   Johnny Weissmuller notwithstanding, there's quite a bit that
animation can do that live performers and settings cannot. 
Through the almost infinite variety of color combinations
available to designers, the African jungle can be made far
more beautiful than a traveller on safari will ever remember it
to be.  Waters will be stunningly aquamarine, trees will be
appear in lush, verdant splendor.  Animals can be fashioned
either anthropomorphically (like Kala, the gorilla) or conceived
according to their genuine nature (like Sabor, the leopard). 
Music, generally used as soundtrack in films employing live
actors, easily moves to the forefront in cartoons.  And since
celebrities are used as voiceovers, a cartoon will attract
people who are fans of the stars.  Kevin Lim and Chris Buck,
who direct this visually exhilarating entry into the Disney
lineage, exploit these resources thoroughly.</P>
<P>   If the story of Tarzan takes place during Victorian times in
England, this is only because its creator, Edgar Rice
Burroughs, was a product of those times.   This version of
the Burroughs story requires no previous knowledge of the
classic tale.  It takes us through the entire story of the title
character's birth through his courtship of Jane, a professor's
daughter who accompanies her dad on a study of African
gorillas.  The one segment of the story which could scare the
kiddies occurs during the opening minutes which, by the way,
are the most impressive part of the entire 88-minute film. 
The camera cuts from a gorilla family headed by the alpha
male, Kerchak (Lance Henriksen) and his sentimental
woman, Kala (Glenn Close) to the human family of Tarzan
(Tony Goldwyn) and his shipwrecked parents.  Kala's young
son is chased and eaten by a leopard, a fate which similarly
befalls Tarzan's folks, leaving the former childless and the
latter an orphan.  The baby Tarzan is found by Kala, adopted
by her despite her mate's hostility to this "hairless wonder,"
and comes of age with fellow gorillas and elephants as his
only mates and mentors.  When a study party led by
Professor Porter (Nigel Hawthorne), his dressed-to-the-nines
daughter Jane (Minnie Driver), and their gun-toting protector
Clayton (Brian Blessed) settle into camp, Tarzan meets Jane,
whisks her to safety in a stunning ride across cliffs from limb
to bough. They like each other.  Tarzan teaches Jane Gorilla
and is tutored in English in return.  The tension mounts when
Clayton, more interested in capturing gorillas for the money
he can get for them in England, executes plans to betray his
employers.</P>
<P>   The animators of this striking film bring to mind the
designers of similar cartoon enterprises such as "Prince of
Egypt" and "Pocohantas," and when compared to epic films
like "The Phantom Menace" may seem positively retro. 
Despite the throwback to the more conventional school of
animation, this movie soars by its melding of computer
graphics with the paint-and-paper design and through new
processes such as Deep Canvas, a technique which puts a
third dimension into the title character's oscillations.  Scripters
Tab Murphy, Bob Tzudiker and Noni White may not have
thrown in the obligatory witticisms for the adults
accompanying the small fry, but the story profits from the
crackling good spirits of Minnie Driver and Rosie O'Donnell
as Jane and Terk (who is Tarzan's simian best friend)
respectively.    </P>
<P>   As Tarzan and Jane fall more deeply in love, you'll wonder
how their association will turn out.  Will she succeed in
conning the ape man to civilization, where he'd be studied by
stuffy anthropologists as was Kaspar Hauser?  Or will the
muscular swinger get her to shed her crinolines and
strangling neckwear to enjoy the freedom of the jungle?  Will
Jane wonder how she is going to survive without the toilet
paper to which she is accustomed?  Will Tarzan ponder the
disadvantages of chucking his free bananas for expensive
salons serving tea and scones?  Author Burroughs had his
own idea for the resolution of the plot, one which is at odds
with the cartoon's.  In any case, the plot's not the thing in this
film of startling animated beauty which, like "Prince of Egypt,"
gives a fresh look to one of the world's popular myths.</P>
