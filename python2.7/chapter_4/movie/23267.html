<P>   Most will agree that Boiler Room is an obvious combination of Wall Street
and Glengarry GlenRoss.  The film even mentions the two on several occasions. 
And while the obvious is that this isn't as equally good as the other two
(especially the latter), it's a awkwardly balanced yet ultimately fun film that
uses some information already used in film before, in a new... unique fashion.</P>
<P>   Giovanni Ribisi (The Other Sister, The Mod Squad) starts off as a young man
living in the slumps, running an illegal casino out of his apartment, who is
given the opportunity to work as a trainee to become a stock broker at a nearly
invisible (yet very succesful) business place. I have seen him in many
different roles, from comedy as Phoebe's "long-lost" brother on "Friends" to a
mentally challenged man in love in The Other Sister. It's interesting to watch
him seemingly challege his abilites, and, with exception, he proves himself to
have much potential as a rising star in Hollywood.</P>
<P>   His performance here is one of the hilights of the film, even as it declines
in entertaining appeal, even as the film strays into an all-too conspiracy
territory that feels very forced. That being said, I'd like to elaborate.
Watching the trailers for Boiler Room, I interpreted it as a comedy.  Perhaps
this is a lone, rush judgment on my part. But regardless, it is much better
described as a thriller with a bundle of comic relief. </P>
<P>   Ben Affleck (Good Will Hunting, DOGMA), who's role in this is commonly
compared to that of Alec Baldwin's in the infamous Glengarry GlenRoss (though
in complexity, there's no likeness), provides a few of the film's highest
points as the rough, 27-year-old veteran of the job. Being a, quote-un-quote,
"senior citizen" in the office. He sprays dialogue and wit about in his few on
screen moments ("Anyone who says money is the root of all evil, doesn't f**king
have it."), his dialogue being the film's best scripted sequences. He utters
his lines as steadily as water flowing from a faucet. Smooth and effective, in
essence.</P>
<P>   In the first portion of the film (action prior to the first major
revelation) is found to contain interesting camera angles edited in an arousing
to the senses sort of way. I'd credit the editors for this facet.  Cutting
extremely fast back and forth between countless objects, though not a new idea,
is used in a fascinating atmosphere around the film's overall tone. Also, the
use of constant rap music adds a certain MTV, pop-culture tone to it, also
creating a more fast-paced and exciting texture.</P>
<P>   Though little can be said for the plot. Little originality here. Though this
doesn't neccesarily hurt the film too much, but it quite obviously it does not
help. Going from comedy to thriller is a steep step and one hard to handle.
Generally speaking.</P>
<P>   When watching the film there will be times where you feel some dialogues are
forced into the scene to attempt to add an impact, at other times you'll be
bored. But for the most part, and at most times, you'll be reasonably
interested in the action at hand and will be enjoying yourself. That's what
this film is. An enjoyable movie going experience. Nothing great. Nothing
classic or memorable. Simply an arguably good time with a cool punchline.</P>
