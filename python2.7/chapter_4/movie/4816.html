<P>TRAINSPOTTING is the new film from the same team (Boyle, Hodge and Macdonald) 
who made the 1995 film SHALLOW GRAVE.  This film is based on the Irvine Welsh 
novel of the same name, which has become a big cult favourite in the last
couple of years here in the UK.  This film has become the focus of a mammoth 
promotional campaign here, which has reached media saturation and then some. 
Such has been the intensity of the adverts, billboards and widespread magazine 
articles that I was seriously considering avoiding this over-hyped film.  Out of
sheer curiosity I succumbed and I went along to see if it could live up to the 
hype, which last year's similarly hyped SHALLOW GRAVE failed to do, in my 
opinion.</P>
<P>The film concerns the lives of a bunch of heroin addicts living in a grotty 
flat, more than likely an illegal squat, in Edinburgh.  The main character 
in this loose bunch is Renton, an emaciated young man played by Ewan McGregor 
(totally unrecognisable from his part in SHALLOW GRAVE). The film focuses on 
his life and how he tries to kick his habit.  His "so-called friends", as he 
terms them, include the suave Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller- HACKERS) who is 
very popular with the girls and a goldmine of opinions and facts on the career 
of Sean Connery, and Spud a bewildered and slightly dotty bloke
(Ewen Bremner -NAKED) who memorably attends a job interview while high on 
speed.  Robert Carlyle (PRIEST) plays their psychotic, though admittedly 
drug-free, friend Begbie who never misses a chance to inflict brutal violence 
on anyone who irritates him, and even those who just happen to be around him 
at the time.</P>
<P>We see how Renton tries to get off his heroin addiction, which proves an 
ordeal for him although he appears to be successful, because suddenly the 
film cuts to London and shows Renton seemingly enjoying himself in the 
wheeling and dealing of his new found status as an estate agent.  His obvious 
enjoyment with the job is a bit hard to fathom and hard to relate to the 
Renton we have seen earlier in the film, but it isn't long before his
old friends encourage him to take part in a risky drug deal. </P>
<P>The controversy over this films revolves around the notion that the film 
glamorises drugs.  IT DOES NOT.  The film makers have bravely decided to show 
that some people get great pleasure from drugs, and to this end the film shows 
and describes the blissfulness experienced by Renton after he has just injected
himself with heroin.  But, whilst the filmmakers recognise the highs it also 
shows the desperate lows when Renton is trying to get off the drugs and starts 
suffering the hellish horrors of withdrawl.  The film, in my opinion, shows 
the lows far more vividly than the highs and this leaves the viewer in no doubt
that the downside of heroin is an experience which would nullify any potential 
pleasure.  This film is not explicitly anti-drugs, but it leaves it up to the 
intelligence of the viewer to make the decision for themselves.  </P>
<P>There is much humour in the film and it is all not doom and gloom.  The scenes 
involving Sick Boy where he ruminates on the careers of Lou Reed and Sean 
Connery are especially funny.  The thumping dance and rock soundtrack, while 
very prominent, is never obtrusive and perfectly creates and compliments the 
mood of the film.  The acting throughout is great, though it is hard to like
many of the characters who all seem hell bent on oblivion for much of the film.</P>
<P>I was pleasantly surprised by TRAINSPOTTING, in that it is worthy of much 
of the praise that is being showered on it.  It's a brave film that dares to 
show the realities of heroin addiction and lets the viewer decide for 
themselves.</P>
