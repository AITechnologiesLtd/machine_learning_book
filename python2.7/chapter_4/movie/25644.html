<PRE>Erin Brockovich </PRE>
<P>Based on a true story, this drama about a strong-willed, independent woman 
named Erin Brockovich (Julia
Roberts) who sticks it to a huge corporation at first comes off as a great 
story of the human spirit and an uphill
battle for justice. </P>
<P>Upon closer inspection it's a little disjointed since the story tries to 
balance Erin's dysfunctional home life with
her courageous fight against a power company who poisoned a small town's 
water supply and lied about it. </P>
<P>The investigative work Erin and lawyer Ed Marsly (Albert Finney) must perform 
in order to win the case and
the emotional ties they must make with each of their 600+ clients is strong, 
interesting and suspenseful. But
Erin's home life and her sort of relationship with her young children and 
biker-who's-actually-a-big-teddy
bear-boyfriend George (Aaron Eckhart) is a tad weak and doesn't work as well 
as it should have. Still, a good,
entertaining story. </P>
