                         Big Night (1996)
                   A film review by Ben Hoffman
                    Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     BIG NIGHT comes across as if it were a foreign film with all the
delightful nuances we frequently find in films made outside our
country, in this case, Italy.  This has all the delicious pathos
without overwhelming us with undue sadness.  One leaves the theater
knowing one has seen a wonderful film.</P>
<P>     And what is its story?  Nothing big.  No one is shot.  Just the
story of the American Dream and of two brothers who dare to believe in
it.  Primo (Tony Shalhoub) is the chef at the Paradiso restaurant
which he and his younger brother, Secundo, (Stanley Tucci) own.
Secundo manages the restaurant but unfortunately it is not doing well
despite Priimo's dedication to preparing the best meals in a small
town in New Jersey.  Their customers are spaghetti and meatball
eaters; what do they know of fine, delicate food?</P>
<P>     Just across the street is a popular Italian restaurant, Pascal's,
which is always crowded despite the fact that prices are high and the
food does not begin to compare with that found at the Paradiso.
Pascal's is owned by the prosperous  Pascal himself (Ian Holm).
Secundo knows the secret to success:  give the public what it want,
not what you would like them to want but  Primo cannot lower himself
to do that.</P>
<P>     But one wonderful night they are told by Pascal that Louis Prima
will be at their restaurant.  That is just what the Paradiso needs, to
have a big name enjoy his food at their restaurant.  In a last
desperate effort to save their business they put everything they have
into making that night a BIG NIGHT, the best and biggest they have
ever attempted.</P>
<P>     While the food and the restaurant are ostensibly what the film is
about, like BABETTE'S FEAST, it is about something quite different.
Love.  Family. Truth.</P>
<P>     Minnie Driver is Secundo's lovely girlfriend.  Cristiano, the
chef's assistant is played by Marc Anthony.   Primo's heartthrob is
played by Allison Janney. The always lovely Isabella Rosselini is
Gabriella on whom Primo and Secundo have a crush. . . as who would
not?</P>
<P>     The son of George C Scott and Colleen Dewhurst, Campbell Scott
directs his first film.  He previously had been acting in several
films and has a small role here. Don't miss this tasty morsel of a
film.</P>
