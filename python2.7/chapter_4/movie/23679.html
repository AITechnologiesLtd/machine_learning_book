"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>I read High Fidelity several months ago in anticipation of its
theatrical release.  While the best-selling Gen X novel was certainly a
good read, I couldn't envision it being made into film - a film worth
watching, anyway.  There really isn't any action, and it's pretty light
on dialogue, instead focusing on the rambling thoughts of its
romantically challenged main character.  I figured there was two ways to
handle this in a screen adaptation:  Either use a voice-over to show
what the character is thinking, or replace what he's thinking with
additional dialogue and action not found in the novel.</P>
<P>Imagine my surprise at the first scene, where protagonist Rob Gordon is
delivering his lines right into the camera.  `Jesus,' I thought, `this
is going to be really annoying for two hours.'  But the narrations
actually grew on me.  Fidelity is lucky to have cast John Cusack (Being
John Malkovich), who may be the only actor in the world that could pull
off this role.  It probably didn't hurt that Cusack also produced and
co-wrote the film, tailoring it to meet both his splendid comic timing
and hangdog vulnerability (read: sad puppy-dog eyes).  Fidelity is an
unqualified hit and, although it's way too early to be saying this,
might be one of the better films you'll see all year.</P>
<P>Formerly a successful club DJ, Cusack's thirty-something Rob is now the
owner of a struggling record shop called Championship Vinyl, which is
located off the beaten path in downtown Chicago.  His two employees,
Barry and Dick (Jack Black, Enemy of the State; and Todd Louiso, Eight
Heads in a Duffel Bag), are the type of elitist record geeks that mock
you to your face if you can't tell the difference between an original
pressing and a reissue of an obscure Frank Zappa album.  But Rob
tolerates it because he's a bit of a musical snob, as well.  The three
busy themselves by compiling Top 5 lists that cover everything from the
all-time best death songs to the greatest Monday morning songs.  And be
warned – expect the more jug-headed critics to begin their reviews with
a `Top Five Reasons I Loved/Hated This Movie' list.</P>
<P>The film actually opens with Rob listing his desert-island, all-time,
top five most memorable split-ups, which are then shown in flashbacks
over the first third of the film.  He's recently been jilted by live-in
lover Laura (Iben Hjejle, Mifune – this is her first English-speaking
role) and begins to contact all of his old exes in an attempt to
pinpoint the exact cause of his inability to maintain relationships with
members of the opposite sex.  This quest, together with Rob's bizarre
need to reorganize his massive record collection in times of crisis,
make up the bulk of the film.</P>
<P>Aside from changing the setting of the film from London to Chicago,
Fidelity stays extremely faithful to its source.  Most of the lines are
taken verbatim from the book, which was written by Nick Hornby, who also
penned the soccer novel Fever Pitch, the film of which saw limited
release in 1999.  Ironically, the only thing British in the film (other
than some behind-the-camera talent) is Catherine Zeta-Jones, who plays
one of Rob's exes.  And everyone think she's Hispanic (she's Welsh).  My
only complaint is that `book' Rob would have hated most of the bands
that `movie' Rob was into.  He had a Bush poster on the wall of his
apartment, for God's sake.  I think that may even be illegal in England
- and if it isn't, it should be.</P>
<P>Perhaps the greatest thing about Fidelity is its uncanny ability to make
viewers point out old albums that they've owned during interior shots of
Rob's record store.  Oh, there goes that King Crimson bootleg that I
just bought on eBay for $50.  Hey, there's the first Hanoi Rocks record
that my sister crayoned all over.  I saw people literally pointing at
the screen in awe that these records existed anywhere but in their own
personal collections.</P>
<P>Also noteworthy is the wildly kinetic performance of Jack Black, who
steals every scene he's in.  This role could make him into the new
Philip Seymour Hoffman.  There is a surprise cameo (musical, of course)
and the closing credits are fantastic, showing the names of the film's
participants on concert handbills.  Fidelity was directed by Stephen
Frears (The Hi-Lo Country) and adapted from Hornby's novel by Cusack and
his Grosse Pointe Blank collaborators D.V. DeVincentis and Steve Pink,
as well as ConAir's Scott Rosenberg.  Their film is obviously a
carefully crafted labor of love that should be a big hit with everyone,
especially if you were born in the 1960s or ‘70s, still own a turntable
or ever worked in a record store.</P>
<P>1:50 – R for adult language, sexual content and mild violence</P>
