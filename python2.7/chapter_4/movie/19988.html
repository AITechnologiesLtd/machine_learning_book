<P>UNIVERSAL SOLDIER: THE RETURN (M).  
(Columbia Tristar)
Director: Mic Rodgers
Stars: Jean-Claude Van Damme, Michael Jai White, Bill Goldberg, Daniel 
Von Bargen, Kiana Tom, Justin Lazard.</P>
<P>Jean-Claude Van Damme reprises his character of Luc Devereaux,
the regenerated soldier, for this risible second sequel to 1992's
violent futuristic thriller Universal Soldier.  Van Damme was absent
from the dire 1998 sequel Universal Soldier II Brothers In Arms, in
which his character was played by another performer.  That film
disappeared straight to video in this country.  Van Damme's return
doesn't necessarily herald an improvement in quality, but it does
ensure that Universal Soldier: The Return gains a brief cinema release
before disappearing into the same video wilderness that has claimed
most of his recent lacklustre efforts.</P>
<P>With the end of the Cold War, the military is drastically
reducing its budget.  The first cutbacks affect the futuristic unisol
project, in which dead soldiers are regenerated and turned into
virtually indestructible cyborgs.  But SETH, the super-intelligent
computer responsible for much of the unisol project, rebels against
the government's plans, and seizes control of the soldiers.  SETH
manages to assume human form (martial arts star Michael Jai White) and
lead his invincible troops as they take over the top secret complex
that houses the unisol project.  As a stand-off develops between the
regular army and the cyborgs it falls to Devereaux to try and stop
SETH's plans.</P>
<P>Mic Rodgers, a former stunt co-ordinator who has worked on
films including Titanic and Lethal Weapon 4, makes his directorial
debut here.  He handles the action and pyrotechnics effectively
enough, but he lacks the flair and visual style of original creators
Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin.</P>
<P>Universal Soldier The Return lacks the energy and
spectacularly staged action sequences of the original.  This highly
unlikely scenario uses the original provocative theme purely as an
excuse for lots of testosterone-fuelled action, loud explosions,
gratuitous mayhem, formulaic and mindless carnage.  Whereas the
original managed to pit Van Damme against fellow action star Dolph
Lundgren, the best this dire sequel can do is pit our uncharismatic
muscle bound hero against Bill Goldberg, the popular wrestler, whose
woeful, one-dimensional performance takes the craft of screen acting
to a new low.</P>
<P>Universal Soldier The Return is a far cry from Van Damme's
superior action thrillers like Time Cop and Sudden Death, and further
demonstrates just how far his career has fallen.  The scene in which
his character complains that he doesn't want to be stereotyped
resonates with an unintentional irony.</P>
<P>This is one return that is both unnecessary and unwelcome.    </P>
