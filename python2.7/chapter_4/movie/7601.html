<PRE>                               CHASING AMY
                      A film review by Bradley Null
                       Copyright 1997 Bradley Null</PRE>
<P>.     The intro sequence of Chasing Amy, comic book frames of oddly
familiar characters, informs us immediately that we are entering the
world of Kevin Smith.  That world is one over-populated with comic book
fanatics, philosophical drug dealers, and ambitionless
twenty-somethings.  To Smith, the film's director, that world is New
Jersey.</P>
<P>     Like characters found in other recent Gen X movies, Smith's heroes
are unjustifiably hip.  n Chasing Amy  there are two groups of
characters, Jersey boys afraid of the city, and fixtures of the NYC
underground.  But regardless of background, every character in Chasing
Amy is poised with a witty remark or comical/philosophical riff on love
or life.  Smith even highlights the (self)-importance of his
protagonist, played by Ben Affleck, by unabashedly naming him after the
coolest literary character of the twentieth century, Holden Caulfield.</P>
<P>     Going well beyond other Gen X movies such as Swingers and Reality
Bites, Chasing Amy embraces the new generation with an unparalleled
frankness.  Although this boy-meets-lesbian love story is more mature
than Smith's earlier work, its never before seen subject matter is
indicative of Smith's predilection for ignoring the taboos of film. 
Frank discussions of sex and perversion are common in Smith's world of
wordy, quick-paced diatribes long on profanity.  Smith tackles this
material with characters and situations that come across, despite their
wit, as strikingly awkward and realistic.  They never have the perfect
line to describe their emotions or what they want.  Their attempts to
riff on their problems en route to solving them display a realistic
ineptitude in dealing with serious problems.  Either the characters have
too much to say or nothing at all, but in all cases the outcome of these
slipshod attempts is bad.  Although the intermittent stupidity and
vulgarity of Smith's characters is sometimes painful to watch, the
film's refreshing realism is an invaluable experience.</P>
<P>     Despite this powerful subtext, Smith's world is not devoid of
humor.  Though self-absorbed, all of Smith's characters are quite
amusing, and the plot development, camera work, and editing in Chasing
Amy capitalize on the humor in every situation.  In one instance, an
atypical riff on sexual acts leads to a fierce comparison of sex wounds
and a game of one-upmanship that riotously parodies such battle scar
comparisons from Lethal Weapon and the adventure film genre.  Smith's
hand-held camera and static long takes also serve to focus action within
the frame and on the borders, which he uses for comical and emotional
effect.</P>
<P>     In all cases, Smith's awkward situations, for both the characters
and audience, play off of traditional film structure in which everything
fits together seamlessly.  In Smith's world, you can count on only one
thing:  when Silent Bob (played by Smith himself) finally speaks (and he
will) he is going to say something profound.</P>
