<P>Jon Turteltaub's Instinct is the ultimate deja vu for anyone who 
has been awake over the past several years. Completely and utterly 
unoriginal, the movie is a collection of other Hollywood hits, Jane 
Goodall's well known ventures into the wild, an exceptionally strong 
musical score, some of the worst cinematography of the year, and a 
performance so award worthy, that it already received one 8 years ago! 
These elements result not so much in a picture, but rather a collage. 
Messily assembled, with glue sticking out on the edges, and some great 
old photos that got a little too cut up, the "artwork" really isn't 
much to behold.</P>
<P>Dr. Ethan Powell (Sir Anthony Hopkins) is an extremely respected 
psychiatrist. He works for a prestigious medical center and boasts of a 
family life with no apparent problems. Much of his research is done in 
Africa, having taken over 20 trips in a decade alone. His last trip to 
the continent found him missing in action (MIA), when he failed to 
return from field research one day. What followed was his spending 
nearly two years in the jungle, living among the gorillas. In short, the 
film takes what Jane Goodall accomplished when she observed these 
animals, and pushes it one step further, having the protagonist live 
among them, not as a human living a human's life, but as a human 
living the lifestyle of a gorilla. By the time Powell is brought back to 
the USA, two African police are dead with three more hospitalized, and 
he has spent a year in an African prison, all as a result of his newly 
found primitive inner self. What emerges when the plane lands in America 
is a cross between Hannibal Lector (Played by Hopkins in The Silence of 
the Lambs) and John Patrick Mason (Played by Sean Connery in The Rock), 
a killer so well educated that he can use every day objects to wreak 
havoc, but possessing an unparalleled degree of wisdom at the same time. </P>
<P>Following in the early footsteps of Powell is Dr. Theo Caulder (Cuba 
Gooding Jr.). A young, energetic, and driven psychiatrist, whose 
potential is endless. His mentor is Dr. Ben Hillard (Donald Sutherland) 
who is extremely encouraging and helpful to the young doctor. So when 
the opportunity to treat Powell comes up, Caulder immediately sees not 
only the chance to further his career, but also to write a best selling 
book as well. With the help of Hillard, the assignment is soon his.</P>
<P>Many surprises await Dr. Caulder as he begins his treatment of the 
killer. Not only does Powell not talk, but his vicious, primal behavior 
has led to an estranged family as well. Caulder sees a source of 
information in Powell's daughter Lyn (Maura Tierney), who in turn 
wants to be reconnected with her father, a man she still deeply loves.</P>
<P>Many similarities exist between Instinct and other Hollywood films. Some 
are major, and some minor. But none approaches the level of near 
plagiarism found in regards to The Silence of the Lambs. Not only does 
Hopkins' presence and similar performance draw a parallel, but the 
other lead roles do as well; One of the most notable similarities being 
the role of Clarice Starling (Jodie Fostor) in the 1991 film, versus 
that of Dr. Caulder in this production. Both are energetic young people 
handling the "case" of their careers. Neither of them has an objective 
consistent with that of the genius they are studying. The question of 
how much of this work was really suggested by Daniel Quinn's novel 
Ishmael, and how much Screenwriter Gerald DiPego may have borrowed from 
his video rack, must be asked.</P>
<P>Both Hopkins and Gooding have Academy Awards to their name. Neither 
of them fails to meet the expectations that they are held to in this 
film. Gooding's performance is his finest since Jerry Maguire. This is 
best demonstrated in a scene where he enters a gymnasium full of 
mentally ill inmates and attempts to defy the prison staff. His cool, 
calm, and positive emotions are dazzlingly displayed in his fine 
performance, and make this scene, as well as many others, flow smoothly. </P>
<P>Sir Anthony Hopkins is absolutely marvelous in his role. Despite the 
obvious resemblance to his earlier work, the character acting in his 
part is still breathtaking. His finest moment, and perhaps the most 
memorable of the film, comes when he is describing his adventures among 
apes, "They accepted a man - they took me in as family - that's the 
miracle." he explains. As these nearly melodramatic words come out of 
his mouth, he transforms them into tense, horrifying comments that send 
chills down your spine.</P>
<P>Danny Elfman delivers a score to accompany this film that is absolutely 
majestic. Often the music serves to compliment the dramatic and 
thrilling elements of the film, provided by the two lead actors. The 
score brings out a whole array of emotions, and often makes the scene 
complete. However, it also accompanies the weak cinematography. For a 
film largely based in Africa, certain visual expectations are naturally 
established. Unfortunately they are never met. The color is dull and 
boring, the landscape limited. An ineffective series of shots from the 
African jungle begin the film, one of the unfortunate examples of the 
lacking cinematography. It is not by any means a stretch to say that an 
average tourist could better capture these images, than Director of 
Photography Philippe Rousselot and Art Director Chris Cornwell do here.</P>
<P>This movie is not original by any means, and is often soar to the eye. 
Certainly, the acting is phenomenal and the score is awesome. But unless 
you have a desire to see Hopkins' interpretation of a murdering 
genius, then this isn't worth the money, not even on video. And if you 
do want to see it, The Silence of the Lambs is already at a store near 
you.</P>
