PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></PRE>
<P>Earlier this year, Brendan Fraser starred in Blast from the Past, a
comical fish-out-of-water story about a man that was forced to grow up
in a bomb shelter because of his father's knee-jerk reaction to the
Cuban Missile Crisis.  While the film was a bit slight, it was still
enjoyable to see the culture shock Fraser's Adam suffered as he tried to
adjust from his docile 1962 to our dreadful 1999.</P>
<P>In The Legend of 1900, we nearly get more of the same.  It's a
fish-won't-get-out-of-water tale of a man that lived his life on a
luxury ocean liner.  Only here, unlike Blast, our protagonist can never
muster enough courage to step foot off the vessel.  And, like Blast, the
film is a bit slight - a legend that offers no real point or moral – but
still entertaining.</P>
<P>Tim Roth (Hoodlum) stars as Danny Boodmann T.D. Lemons Nineteen Hundred
(or `1900' for short, and `19' for friends) - a name nearly as long as
its explanation.  A laborer aboard The Virginian discovers an abandoned
infant among the confetti and noisemakers used to celebrate the birth of
the New Year on the previous evening.  The boy was found in a lemon
crate, the finder's name was Danny Boodmann (Bill Nunn, Kiss the Girls)
and the year was 1900.  Boodmann decides to raise 1900 as his own son,
and the gritty bowels of the ship becomes the boy's first home.
Boodmann does not, however, utter the line, `Now that's a real shame
when folks be throwin' away a perfectly good white boy like that.'</P>
<P>As he grows older, 1900 begins to sneak around the boat and witnesses
how the other half lives.  He is amazed by their flowing costumes,
dancing, and, most importantly, elegant music.  As 1900 begins some
late-night dabbling with the ship's piano, we learn that he is a musical
prodigy capable of performing the most intricate pieces.  It's not too
long before the ship's ritzy upper crust is treated to 1900's
spectacular musical stylings.</P>
<P>Despite having never left the ship, 1900's reputation as a jazz virtuoso
eventually makes land and before long the genre's inventor, Jelly Roll
Morton (Clarence Williams III, The General's Daughter), comes aboard The
Virginian to challenge 1900 to a piano duel.  Morton is a contentious
prick, insulting 1900 before launching into a fantastically intricate
jazz number that thrills the ship's passengers.  1900 responds with a
sweaty performance that would make David Helfgott proud, resulting in
one the best moments in cinema that you will see this year.
(Incidentally, if the theater doesn't burst into applause at that point,
run – you're in a room full of zombies).  The incident helps to further
the legend of 1900 on the mainland, while he is content to repeatedly
make the trip from London to New York.</P>
<P>1900 eventually relents to the pressure of record executives and records
one song while still aboard The Virginian.  The tune is improvised and
hauntingly beautiful, but 1900 smashes the master to pieces as he can't
bear to have his music go anywhere without him.  The broken record is
found in a music store years later by one of 1900's best friends, Max
(Pruitt Taylor Vince, Mumford), who narrates the entire film to the
disbelieving elderly owner of a New York music store (Peter Vaughan, An
Ideal Husband).  Max is concerned for 1900 as The Virginian, which did
time during World War II as a hospital ship, is scheduled to be
demolished.  He is unsure whether his old friend was able to overcome
his greatest fear and leave the ship.</P>
<P>The Legend of 1900 is based on Italian novelist Alessandro Baricco's
dramatic monologue and adapted for the screen by Oscar-winning director
Guiseppe Tornatore (Cinema Paradiso) – his first in the English
language.  Ennio Morricone (Bulworth) provides a majestic score and
Hungarian Lajos Koltai's photography is simply exquisite.  1900 has
already swept five awards at Italy's version of the Oscars (Tornatore,
Morricone and Koltai, in addition to the production and costume
design).  And we all remember what happened the last time a popular
Italian fable hit our continent, don't we?</P>
<P>As a side note, I can neither confirm nor deny the fact that Steely
Dan's song `Hey Nineteen' was about Tim Roth's character.  I can also
neither confirm nor deny that the name Steely Dan actually refers to
Danny Boodmann, who worked in the bowels of the ship, which were made of
steel.</P>
