<PRE>                              BEFORE SUNRISE
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Put aside reality and put on a cloak of romantic make believe.
Pretend that everything that happens in the film could really occur and
then sit back and look at Jesse (Ethan Hawkes), the handsome American
traveling on Eurail.  Nor will you have any problem keeping your eyes
on French student Celine (Julie Delpy), perhaps the loveliest face in
movies today, who sits opposite him in the train.</P>
<P>     It takes only a few moments of idle conversation before he tells
her that he is leaving for the U.S. tomorrow and how would she like to
postpone her trip back to Paris and school and spend the next fourteen
hours sightseeing with him?  After a slight (ever so slight)
hesitation she agrees.</P>
<P>     The camera follows them through Vienna and other cities until the
following morning when, at the railroad station, it is time for them to
say "Goodbye."  Does that mean forever?</P>
<P>     If such an adventure could happen to anyone (and people do have a
tendency to leave behind some of their conventional behavior when they
are traveling many miles from home) Jesse and Celine would be the
ones.  What a handsome, lovely pair they make.</P>
