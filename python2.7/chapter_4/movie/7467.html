                       A film review by Frank Ochieng
                        Copyright 1997 Frank Ochieng</PRE>
<P>starring: Halle Berry, Natalie Desselle, Martin Landau, Ian Richardson
directed by: Robert Townsend</P>
<P>Actor-director-writer Robert Townsend first made a big splash with his
lampoon hit HOLLYWOOD SHUFFLE several years back. Of course this film
showcased satirical bits about how Hollywood has ridiculously portrayed
black folks in Tinseltown over the decades. You name it and Townsend
cleverly spoofed it: black pimps, hookers, drug 
addicts, gang members, etc. HOLLYWOOD SHUFFLE was a breakthrough hit
because...well, it was funny, revealing, and sadly true. Now with
Townsend's latest film B.A.P.S, one wonders whether or not Townsend got
the message of his own treasured HOLLYWOOD SHUFFLE 
because BAPS (black American princesses) looks like it stems from one of
those sorrowful "SHUFFLE" skits. Halle Berry and Natalie Desselle ("SET
IT OFF") play two black Southern girlfriends who travel to California in
order to appear in a music video. What appears so unusual about these
boisterous black "soul sisters" is that they are so loud and obnoxious
in their gigantic blonde wigs, gold teeth, five inch finger-
nails, and tight-fitting clothing that one would think these two fashion
delinquents mugged RuPaul on the way to their audition. Because of some
rather awkward circumstances, the two fearless fashion plates end up
staying with a dying wealthy white millionaire (Martin Landau) and his
stuffy and sensible butler (Ian Richardson) only to start enjoying the
plush life that these two "fish-out-of-water" never experienced back in
Decatur, Georgia. Soon the film resorts to the degrading trials 
and tribulations by having these two sassy sweethearts "conform" within
the realm of wealth and its wonder. Who will get their comeuppance?
   Will it be the B.A.P.S or the rich establishment that judges them?
Better yet, maybe these Georgia gals can bring some understanding and
insight to the folks outside their world. Or maybe I should begin by
proclaiming BAPS as the first major flop of the 1997 movie season?
B.A.P.S is an insufferable, hackeyed embarassment of a movie. Its 
vapid approach to showing these loud uninteresting dressed-up dimwit
dolls in this wasted comedy of errors is too much to say the least.
Halle Berry's movie career hasn't exactly been fireworks as of lately 
(witness her in the lame RICH MAN'S WIFE for example) and Natalie
Desselle has the dubious task (besides being in this movie) as
portraying the rotund and ridiculous BAP, especially in comparison to
Berry's svelte 
self. And one has to wonder why in the world is Academy Award winning
Martin Landau doing in such a drawback of a movie? He simply stands
around looking like a fossil who recently escaped from the local museum
archive. And I'm sure BAPS is a long haul from the coveted halls of the
BBC for Ian Richardson. The only thing Townsend accomplished by
assembling B.A.P.S was to show that he had a big budget to work with,
hence the casting of Landau and Richardson. Otherwise, this film has no
direction or redeeming 
qualities other than being offensive, aimless, and having its young
black female leads all dressed up in silly garb with no place to go. 
But there is a place to go---out the exit doors! B.A.P.S---Beware of
Asinine 
Picture that Stinks!!!</P>
