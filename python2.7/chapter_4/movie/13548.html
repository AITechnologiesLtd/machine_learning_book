<P>     A message to all you aspiring screenwriters:  know your genre.
Don't misunderstand, I'm not suggesting a writer should limit him or
herself to only one genre, or that film script formulas couldn't stand a
little innovation.  However, there are good reasons why you shouldn't
write a farce the same way you write a biographical drama.  It's about
pacing, about knowing your audience, about delivering the emotions the
genre promises to deliver.  Scott Rosenberg has made a decent career for
himself writing primarily comedies (BEAUTIFUL GIRLS) and action films (CON
AIR, uncredited contribution to ARMAGEDDON).  His chosen style is arch
dialogue and lots of it, which works out just fine when you're writing a
comedy or an action film.  A dark thriller is another cinematic beastie
entirely.  In the case of DISTURBING BEHAVIOR, that critter is a great big
turkey.</P>
<P>     It didn't necessarily have to be so foul a fowl.  The premise is a 45
degree spin on Ira Levin's THE STEPFORD WIVES, the tale of a troubled teen
named Steve Clark (James Marsden) trying to adjust to his new home of
Cradle Bay, Washington after a family tragedy.  But there's something
strange going on among the teens of Cradle Bay, something stoner Gavin
Strick (Nick Stahl) tries to warn Steve about: a group of frighteningly
civic-minded students called the Blue Ribbons.  You see, when they're not
holding bake sales, they're breaking the necks of their girlfriends and
recruiting other students into a state of lobotomized pleasantness.</P>
<P>     It's a nifty idea to create a creepshow out of the recognition that
a teenager who's acting "normal" probably isn't.  DISTURBING BEHAVIOR,
however, isn't really a creepshow.  Instead, it's a frantic and unfocused
teen-sploitation in which the re-programmed adolescents get violent when
they get horny, which, being teenagers, they do with some regularity.
"X-Files" and "Millennium" veteran David Nutter drags out plenty of
familiar tricks (point-of-view camera tricks, bobbing flashlights in the
woods, even a score by Mark Snow), but his efforts to create mood can't
get past who-cares characterizations and unexplained motivations.  There's
nothing frightening about the mastermind behind the plot, since he's just
another one of the malicious or oblivious adults who populate films of
this kind.  The notable exception is the wacky janitor (William Sadler)
who hangs out in the high school basement killing rats.  Score one for the
parents of Cradle Bay for being more concerned with rebellious attire than
with a rodent-obsessed lunatic working in their children's school.</P>
<P>     Ultimately, DISTURBING BEHAVIOR crashes on the failure of Rosenberg's
script.  Leave aside for a moment the perfunctory romantic interest (Katie
Holmes), the forced dialogue like "Self-mutilate this, Fluid Boy," or the
pointless extended riff in which Gavin hips Steve to the startling
revelation that -- gasp! -- high school students form cliques.  DISTURBING
BEHAVIOR is simply a miserable thriller, because Rosenberg rarely bothers
to build any tension into his scenes.  Sure, he has people jump out to go
booga-booga every once in a while.  That doesn't add up to a second of
genuine suspense, even when our heroes find themselves the next candidates
for CLOCKWORK ORANGE style "treatment."  The film merely tears along from
start to finish in a brisk 80 minutes, and when it's all said and done the
only thing you'll remember is how ridiculous it all is.</P>
<P>     DISTURBING BEHAVIOR isn't a lousy thriller because it tries to be
funny.  "The X-Files" has successfully paired satire and scares, as have
the two SCREAM films.  It helps, however, if the humor supports character
development, or perhaps elicits a laugh once in a while (all right, the
Blue Ribbons' Olivia Newton-John-playing yogurt shop hangout is worth a
chuckle).  No, DISTURBING BEHAVIOR is a lousy thriller because it never
tries to be thrilling.  It's just a big dumb goof, cynically pitched at
youth with sex, violence, loud music and a story that doesn't make a shred
of sense.  Having made two recent films with Michael Bay, Rosenberg's
mistake is understandable.  But if you're going to write an action film,
you'd better not try to make it a suspense film.  The idea of Scott
Rosenberg's next thriller if he doesn't learn a few new tricks...now
_that's_ scary.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 BEHAVIOR modifications:  2.</PRE>
