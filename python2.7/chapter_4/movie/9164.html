<P>     "The buzz" about GRAVESEND was that it's a startling debut 
showcasing the promise of a new director, NYU Film School dropout 
Salvatore Stabile.  The reality goes to show how misleading "the buzz" 
can be, for, while there's no doubt that GRAVESEND hints at Stabile's 
talent, that potential is (as yet) mostly unrealized.  And "startling" 
isn't the first word that comes to mind when describing this motion 
picture -- "underwritten" is a better choice.</P>
<P>     Admittedly, the manner in which Stabile has filmed GRAVESEND forces 
the viewer to notice his approach.  It's a confrontational, in-your-face 
style that never rests.  Stabile places his handheld 16 mm camera right 
in the middle of the action and keeps it moving.  Unfortunately, his 
occasional lapses into artsy pretentiousness (black & white scenes, 
shots that are intentionally overexposed, etc.) distract from his 
otherwise kinetic and visceral methods.  Those who have compared the 
director to Tarantino or early Scorsese are giving him too much credit.</P>
<P>     The aspect that undermines GRAVESEND isn't the camerawork or the 
director's touch, but Stabile's script, which is uninvolving and 
repetitive, and features a quartet of ill-developed characters.  At 
eighty-six minutes, GRAVESEND is short, but there are times when it 
feels interminable, as we seem to be going in circles, covering the same 
ground and watching the characters have the same arguments more than 
once.  GRAVESEND also features a significant quantity of banal, profane 
dialogue.  In fact, it's this element that points up one of the major 
differences between Stabile and Tarantino.  Tarantino's dialogue is a 
pleasure to listen to -- there's rhythm and style to the way the words 
are pieced together.  The same cannot be said of the lines Stabile has 
saddled his four GRAVESEND protagonists with.  </P>
<P>     GRAVESEND spends one night on the streets of Brooklyn with four 
bored, disaffected young men.  We meet this quartet of friends -- Zane 
(Tony Tucci), Ray (Michael Parducci), Chicken (Tom Malloy), and Mikey 
(Thomas Brandise) -- as they sit around in Ray's basement, arguing and 
trading quips.  When Ray's brother comes downstairs to demand quiet, 
things get out of hand.  Zane whips out a gun and, not believing it to 
be loaded, pulls the trigger.  Suddenly, there's blood everywhere, and 
Ray's brother is lying on the floor, dead.  The rest of the film follows 
the co-conspirators as they attempt to raise the $500 in cash needed to 
dispose of the body.  And, as the night wears on, the level of mistrust 
(not to mention the body count) escalates.</P>
<P>     One of the most serious flaws with GRAVESEND is that none of the 
characters are credibly developed.  I never for a moment believed that 
any of these individuals were more than creations of a writer's fertile 
mind.  This is partly the fault of Stabile's screenplay and partly the 
fault of the actors.  With the exception of Tony Tucci, whose Zane is 
consistently well-realized as a fountain of ill-concealed hostility, the 
performances are lackluster.  There are scenes when Parducci, Malloy, 
and Brandise hit their stride, but it doesn't happen often enough.</P>
<P>     Films about nihilistic, unsympathetic protagonists are always more 
difficult to execute than those featuring likable heroes, so Stabile has 
at least shown a degree of ambition in his first feature.  On those 
occasions when GRAVESEND works, it has the capability to engage and 
entertain.  Unfortunately, because of script deficiencies and bad 
choices (such as an ill-advised voiceover narrative), there aren't 
enough of those moments for this film to climb out of the continuum of 
"life on the streets" movie mediocrity.  After an involving first 
fifteen minutes, GRAVESEND runs into a dead end.</P>
