<PRE>"Faithless"</PRE>
<P>Legendary filmmaker Ingmar Bergman gets introspective with his
autobiographical story of marriage, infidelity and betrayal, "Faithless,"
directed by his protégé, actress-turned-director Liv Ullmann and starring
Lena Endre as the fickle Marianne.</P>
<P>The story begins with an old man, Bergman (Erland Josephson), struggling
with his script about marriage and fidelity. He has trouble breathing life
into his personal tale and calls upon an actress, Marianne (Endre), to help
him with the task. The beautiful actress may be real or she may be just a
figment of the elderly Bergman's imagination as she helps the writer and
tells him her story.</P>
<P>Marianne is married to Marcus (Thomas Hanzon), a much sought after
orchestra director who spends much of the time away on tour. David (Krister
Henriksson), a family friend and filmmaker (Bergman's alter ego), decides
to fill the void and spends his time with Marianne. An affair soon begins.
David's hair trigger temper and lack of regard for those around him are the
catalyst that will lead to a broken marriage and, especially, grief for
Marianne and Marcus's young daughter Isabelle (Michelle Gylemo)</P>
<P>Ingmar Bergman is known for his moody, reflective work as both director and
writer and "Faithless" is no exception. His story of infidelity and jealous
starts off innocently enough with Marianne reacting to an offhanded
proposition by drunken David with a declaration that they are like brother
and sister, rebuffing the advance. Thinking it all a bit of platonic
flirting, she begins to plan an affair that lands her in Paris with David
while Marcus is, again, on tour. As the passion builds so does her
realization that David is selfish, demanding and doesn't really care about
anyone but himself. Things come to a head when Marcus catches his wife and
best friend in bed. The cuckolded husband vows to get a divorce and take
the one thing away from Marianne that means anything to her - Isabelle.</P>
<P>This long, talky Swedish language film benefits from several levels of
influence. Bergman's biographic tale takes on the proportions of an
accident happening before your eyes - you know, as you watch, that there is
a whole bunch off hurt coming up, but it's too fascinating to turn away
from. You know that Marianne's decision is going to cause pain for her,
Marcus and, especially, Isabelle, but she can't stop it from happening any
more than you can stop her. Your fears, you realize, are going to be met by
the little family and disaster is apparent.</P>
<P>The fascinating drama of jealousy and betrayal is coupled with some
exemplary acting, especially by Lena Endre. The Bergman-favored actress
gives an enigmatic air to Marianne as she moves from innocent playfulness
to a full-blown affair and damn the consequences. Marianne is beautiful
enough to believe that she can control the flirting between her and David.
When they go to Paris, leaving Isabelle with her grandma and Marcus touring
the wilds of America, it is still under the misguided belief that there is
nothing wrong in what they are doing. When David ingenuously asks about her
past affairs, she doesn't see the horns of jealousy sprout. When their
affair ends in anger and confrontation with Marcus, she also doesn't see
that she is going to lose Isabelle, too. Endre gives a powerful, subtle
performance as a woman who makes an irreversible decision and must suffer
the consequences.</P>
<P>The men in her life are more mundane than Marianne. Each is well regarded
in their respective fields - Marcus and music, David and film - but they
are emotionally stilted. They understand that they both love Marianne, but
neither knows the woman or her needs. In the end, everyone loses, with
little Isabelle being the most profoundly affected victim of the adult
decisions. Endre anchors the rest of the small cast.</P>
<P>Liv Ullmann lends an assured hand to her direction, showing the inspiration
acquired from her mentor, Bergman. She is influenced, strongly, by the
elder director, but has developed her own intimate filmmaking stance.
"Faithless," actually feels more French than Swedish, the interlude in
Paris notwithstanding. The close, almost stagy production plays it close to
the chest as the intimacy approaches claustrophobic as Marianne's once
happy life goes down the tubes.</P>
<P>"Faithless" is the kind of film that the buffs love, but is far too
dialogue intensive to attract the more casual filmgoer. I give it a B.</P>
