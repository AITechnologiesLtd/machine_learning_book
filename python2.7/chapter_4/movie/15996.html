<P>You've Got Mail: Summary and Critique</P>
<PRE>Summary :</PRE>
<P>You've Got Mail is the latest romantic comedy directed by Nora Ephron,
and starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, and is an update of the 1940 film
The Shop Around the Corner.   Ryan plays Cathleen Kelley, owner of  a
children's bookstore started by her mother, and called "The Shop Around
the Corner";   Hanks plays Joe Fox,  grandson in the firm of Fox & Sons,
which is about to open a mega-book mart literally around the corner
(think Borders or Barnes &  Noble).  Meanwhile, the two have also been
carrying on an anonymous email romance they keep secret from their
respective partners-Greg Kinnear as a pompous luddite political
columnist, and Parker Posey woefully underused as a book editor who
"makes coffee nervous."   When Hanks drops in at the children's
bookstore one day with his eight year old aunt (his grandfather's
daughter) and his 4 year old half brother (product of his father's
latest romance), some romantic sparks fly between the leads,  and he
declines to tell her his last name, keeping secret his role as the
competition.  At first, Kelley  thinks Fox books won't affect her
business, and she certainly  has no principled objection to large
corporations (both protagonists  get their morning coffee at Starbuck's,
and the movie has been described as an infomercial for AOL).  But when
her shop starts to suffer, she mounts a publicity campaign against the
commercial giant, and the two booksellers become increasingly
antagonistic off-line, even as he gives her business advice on-line.
When they arrange to meet, he doesn't tell her that he is, in fact, the
man she's been corresponding with.  After she closes her shop because of
plummeting sales, he continues to woo her both via email and in person.
By the time she has begun writing a children's book, and acknowledges
that change is all for the best, both have broken up with their previous
partners, and they finally kiss at the film's conclusion.</P>
<PRE>Critique:</PRE>
<P> You've Got Mail has gotten mixed reviews-one paper titled theirs
"You've Got Treacle"-but even those less than enthusiastic have  tended
to neglect the politics of the film.  We are in an era of increasing
corporate consolidation that is reshaping media as well as other
capitalist enterprises-Disney owns ABC, Time Warner owns Turner
Broadcasting, and Bertelsmann, the German-based owner of Bantam
Doubleday Dell, has signed an agreement to buy Random House.    This
makes the German based company the largest publisher of English-language
books in the world, controlling 25% of adult trade publishing in the US
.  Such major corporate mergers tend to result in a significant decline
in the number of "midlist" titles published and a decline in the
diversity of titles and voices published (Feminist Bookstore News Spring
1998).  Moreover, in 1998 the ABA (American Booksellers Association) and
a number of independent bookstores  filed a lawsuit against Borders and
Barnes &  Noble, charging  unfair and illegal business practices.  Among
other problems, the suit notes that as chain superstores gain dominance,
book prices rise: Barnes & Noble  and Borders no longer offer discounts
on most books, and their business practices-including insistence on
special deals and slow payment- drive up the list price of books from
which any discount is calculated.  A serious issue in the consolidation
of media, then, is the narrowing of the range and accessibility of
written  discourse.  In You've Got Mail, however, the only real
criticism offered of the superstore is that the salespeople it hires are
insufficiently knowledgeable-a problem easily remedied by hiring some
of  those thrown out of work by the competition.</P>
<P>Moreover, even the movie's transient nostalgia for small business
obscures the fact that as a capitalist enterprise it is by definition
exploitive, extracting surplus labor from writers, printers, bindery
workers, and so on.  The film is accurate, at least, in its suggestion
that the logic of capitalism means that books are commodities, and the
unchecked market leads to increasing monopolization.  You've Got Mail
resembles other recent cinematic representations of corporate growth in
feminizing the small business (a children's bookstore founded by a woman
and run by her daughter) and masculinizing the large corporation.
Moreover, although Fox & Sons is a family business of sorts, the
repeated marriages and late-in-life childrearing of grandfather and
father Fox indicates their failure in stable family values.  Joe,
however, is evidently supposed to be humanized by his discovery of a
soulmate in the incredibly sweet Cathleen Kelley.  (Even after he's
driven her out of business, she feels guilty about speaking harshly to
him.)  He also has a friendly dog and a black buddy/employee, and his
seductive powers are never problematized.  Early in the film, he talks
with the manager of the not yet open superstore, and points out that
they will seduce the customers.  Later, he charms an irritated grocery
clerk, and ultimately, of course, charms Kelley.   She offers no
objection to the discovery that he has known for the last third of the
film that she is the "Shopgirl" of their email correspondence,  and has
withheld that information (surely an unfair if not illegal romantic
practice).  And  of course, she completely forgives him for his business
practices.</P>
<P>Love trumps politics.  The Greg Kinnear character (the journalist
boyfriend) is the only one who seems to express any political views, and
is something of a buffoon.  Ryan's character, in contrast, reports that
she forgot to vote in the last election because she was getting a
manicure.  The small store's bookkeeper, played by Jean Stapleton,
reports blandly that she had an affair with Franco in the 1960s.  Even a
fascist dictator, apparently, can be lovable (what's next?  Pinochet as
romantic hero?).</P>
<P>Joe quotes The Godfather as the source of all wisdom, but the idea that
capitalism is organized crime is neglected in favor of the cuteness of
his love of cinema.  Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice is used as a
justification for her forgiveness of him, and indeed, that novel is
ultimately about the heroine's insertion into the property structure.</P>
<P>In the 1940 Shop Around the Corner, on which You've Got Mail is based,
the Jimmy Stewart character is senior clerk at Matusheks' leather-good
store.  He doesn't want to hire  Margaret Sullavan; but she sells a
cigarette-case/music box that the owner particularly likes, so Matushek
hires her.  The story is set in Budapest, and there is discussion among
the shop employees of how bad the economy is, how hard it is to find a
job, and how much they need to keep the jobs they have. (The shop's
record business on Christmas eve is described as the best since 1928. )
Sullavan, however, hopes soon to quit working and to marry her anonymous
penpal, whom she doesn't realize is Stewart, with whom she has a
conflicted relationship at work.  He, too, hopes to marry his anonymous
penpal, with whom he corresponds on cultural topics, to improve himself,
because he couldn't afford an encyclopedia.  But he realizes he needs a
better salary if he is going to raise a family.  Matushek, the fatherly
owner,  mistakenly thinks Stewart is having an affair with his wife,
though it's really a different salesman.  He gets fired, and Sullavan
calls him an insignificant little clerk (a castration to which Hanks is
never subject).  The owner learns the truth and  makes a suicide attempt
(his wife has chosen someone  he would not respect or desire; he has
wrongfully cast off his surrogate son-he later observes that the shop is
his real home, where he has lived most of his life, and, alone on
chistmas eve, takes out to dinner the new errand boy Rudy, who is alone
in the city, too).    Jimmy Stewart gets rehired and promoted to
manager; Pepe the errand boy is promoted to clerk; the philanderer is
fired (he has somehow "two-timed" the company; in cuckolding the boss he
has been unfaithful to his job).   After  the penpals  plan to meet in
the café,  Stewart sends a letter saying he'd seen her with such a
handsome man he stayed away; he tells her he's met the letter-writer,
who's fat, unemployed and ready to live on her salary  rather than to
support her.  She confesses she really liked Jimmy Stewart and was mean
to him only because she'd recently read a novel where the heroine, an
actress at the comedie francaise, is cruel to men and they all fall in
love with her-but she realizes her mistake was that she works not at the
comedie francaise but at Matushek's leather goods store.  In The Shop
Around the Corner, then, the central conflict is maintining masculinity
and the masculine role of provider  in an unstable economy.</P>
<P> In You've Got Mail, the protagonists are competitors rather than
coworkers-a nod to women's independent entrepreneurship, perhaps.  But
Kelley thinks that her life running the bookstore has been "small"-as
though the breadth of experience can be measured by the volume of
trade.  Closing the bookstore is, she comments, like reliving her
mother's death, and the film thus suggests that women's oedipal move
from the world of the  mother to that of the fathers is a healthy and
necessary development-even if the father has, figuratively, killed the
mother.    Only by accepting and forgiving that loss can she move on to
marriage and, implicitly, to having a daughter of her own.  In turning
to writing children's books, she becomes a kind of independent
entrepreneur (though we never get to the questions of publication and
distribution), suggesting that those put out of business by large
corporations can always turn to a kind of self-employment.</P>
<P>Nora Ephron has apparently said in interviews that the US is no longer a
class society-and judging from the invisibility in this movie of
unemployment, poverty, and low-paid wage work, one might think she is
right.  But the portrait of the unionization battle of Borders employees
in Michael Moore's documentary The Big One tells a different story.</P>
