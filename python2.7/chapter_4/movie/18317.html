<PRE>MIGHTY JOE YOUNG
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>They've remade King Kong, they've remade Godzilla, now Hollywood has set
their sights on another giant animal from years past:  Mighty Joe Young.
But this updated remake is more of an example of modern special effects
technology than of good storytelling.  If you're just going to see the
ape, Mighty Joe Young will suffice...but don't expect more than that.</P>
<P>The Joe of the title is a giant gorilla.  Not quite King Kong sized,
he's still large enough to ignite fear in the hearts of the
superstitious, and greed in the hearts of evil poachers.  But Joe isn't
a monster, he's just a misunderstood animal.  His protector is the
beautiful Jill Young (Charlize Theron), who was orphaned at the same
time as Joe when her mother, renknowned primatologist Dr. Ruth Young
(Linda Purl), ran afoul of the poacher Strasser (Rade Serbedzija).</P>
<P>But, despite her best efforts, Jill can't keep Joe a secret from the
world.  People like Gregg O'Hara (Bill Paxton) keep popping up. Gregg
works at an animal preserve outside of Los Angeles, and has come to the
wilds of Africa in search of a legend:  Joe.  Gregg offers to give the
big monkey a home in L.A..  But what is the best thing for Joe? To stay
home, and be hunted...or to live in a cage (a safe cage, but a cage
nonetheless).</P>
<P>But, wherever Joe goes, there will be danger.  Strasser is still around
(now running an animal preserve of his own, where he secretly butchers
endangered species), and still bears a personal grudge against the giant
ape.  He makes it his mission to find and kill Joe (and, of course, to
sell his remains for a huge profit), wherever he is.</P>
<P>Mighty Joe Young himself is the film's greatest achievement.  As a
special effect, he is truly a marvel.  He is so realistic, in fact, that
he's often more believable than the human actors in the film. That said,
his character is far from perfect...in fact, it is quite variable. At
times, he's merely a brute animal, little more than a monster.  But,
when the screenplay requires it, his IQ shoots up a hundredfold, and he
becomes a hairy Einstein, amused at the foolish antics of the puny
humans around him.</P>
<P>Bill Paxton and Charlize Theron are forced to play second banana to the
great ape, and neither of them show top form here.  They have both shown
much more skill in prior roles.  Here, their characters are flat and
uninteresting, and they don't seem to put much effort into making them
unique.  They're both aware that this is the gorilla's movie, and
they're just along for the ride.</P>
<P>The film, though advertised as the traditional Disney animal flick, is
slightly more violent than one might expect.  The film is, after all,
about a monstrously giant ape.  Still, though a few scenes might be a
bit intense for younger children, older kids should get a kick out of
Joe, and probably won't care that the rest of the film is threadbare.</P>
<P>You can't expect the world from a gorilla movie.  But, usually you can
expect more than just the gorilla.  Luckily, Mighty Joe's special
effects wizardry will be appreciated just as well on the small screen as
the big.</P>
