American Psycho * * *1/2 out of * * * *
Starring: Christian Bale, Reese Witherspoon, Chloe Sevingy, Willem Defoe,
Jarod Leto, Samantha Mathis.
Directed by: Mary Harron
Rated R: some graphic violence and gore, strong sexuality, nudity, language
and drug use.
Running Time: 101 Minutes</P>
<P>Controversy is one of my favorite words in the dictionary, because when
controversy and movies are mentioned in the same sentence, its a good bet
that the movie will either be a huge hit, or a huge flop. "American Psycho"
opened to great critical acceptation, but failed to make it big at the box
office, after a few months it had faded away, but those lucky people who saw
the movie were shocked, offended, and amazed by this movie.</P>
<P>Patrick Batemen is not your typical business man, he is a handsome, well
built man who keeps his body in shape, and takes care of his body. In the
opening five minutes we learn how Patrick does this, by applying exfoliating
lotions, soaps, etc. But Patrick has a downside to him, he is a psychotic
killer, who likes to slice and dice women and kill men.</P>
<P>Of course Patrick's colleagues and friends don't know this, and neither does
his fiance played by Reese Witherspoon. After an acquaintance of Patrick's
ends up dead Patrick is questioned in the murder of this man, of course we
know Patrick did it...why? Because we see Patrick chop this man up with an
Ax. From here on, the movie is a study of Patrick's life, as he finds out who
he really is...</P>
<P>Christian Bale takes over the difficult role of Patrick Bateman, and let me
be the first one to say this may be the best male leading role I've seen in
the year 2000. His dialogue comes out of his mouth with such greatness, and
I think Christian started to really get into the role. With the scenes of
graphic violence, he seems to use them in a skillful way, and Mary Harron's
direction doesn't make it as gratuitous as one might think.</P>
<P>Next to Christian Bales the performances from Reese Witherspoon as Patrick's
annoying yet lovable fiance is quite funny, and she seems to be enjoying
herself on screen, and the audience is enjoying themselves watching her.
Willem Defoe as Detective Kimbell is good, but his character seems to me to
be underdeveloped. The standout of the supporting cast is Chloe Sevingy who
last year gave a fantastic performance in Boys Don't Cry, one of my picks for
best picture last year.</P>
<P>"American Psycho's" biggest flaw is the last 15 minutes, in which it makes
little sense, and starts to take itself seriously, with talks of a sequel in
the works, I will definitely be first in line to see it, as long as the
original cast returns. "American Psycho" is a great film that I recommend to
anyone who enjoys watching messed up movies that are brilliant.</P>
