<P>     INTIMATE RELATIONS is the latest in a long line of films that 
claims to have been inspired by real events.  This is one of those 
instances, however, when I could care less whether or not the movie is 
based on a true story -- the knowledge certainly doesn't add anything to 
the viewing experience.  Nevertheless, for some reason, it seems 
important to first-time director Philip Goodhew that we recognize that 
at least the bare-bone facts of INTIMATE RELATIONS are culled from the 
historical record.</P>
<P>     Of far more interest than the "based on a true story" aspect is the 
film's central theme about the inherent hypocrisy of a "morally upright" 
(or should that be "uptight") society.  There has been and always will 
be a human preoccupation with sex.  The only thing that changes with the 
years is how the culture deals with this basic concept.  The 1950s, the 
era in which INTIMATE RELATIONS is set, was a time of sexual repression.  
Appearances meant everything, and people would go to extraordinary 
lengths to seem above moral reproach, even if the truth was much 
different.</P>
<P>     Such is the case with Marjorie Beasley (Julie Walters), an aging 
wife and mother who is outwardly a model citizen.  Inwardly, however, 
she is a haunted and lonely person who craves sexual satisfaction.  Her 
husband's touch disgusts her, so she constantly rebuffs him, even going 
so far as to move into a separate bedroom.  But, when a handsome young 
border, Harold Guppy (Rupert Graves), rents the Beasleys' spare bedroom, 
Marjorie goes on the prowl, insinuating herself into Harold's good 
graces, then seducing him.  Their affair gets off to a rocky start, but 
the biggest problem isn't the two decades age difference -- it's that 
Marjorie's 13-year old daughter, Joyce (Laura Sadler), is fully aware of 
what's going on between her mother and the lodger, and she intends to 
use that knowledge to blackmail Harold.</P>
<P>     It's possible to see INTIMATE RELATIONS as a dark comedy, but it's 
really more of an attack on the hypocritical attitudes that pervade 
society in every era.  By choosing a story from '50s England, Goodhew 
distances us from events, but that doesn't mean that the issues he is 
addressing aren't as valid today as they were two generations ago.  Our 
society may claim to be more liberal and permissive in the '90s, but 
sexual secrets are still the most closely guarded, and, if they get into 
the open, have the greatest potential to damage.  Appearances still 
count for more than reality.</P>
<P>     Plot-wise, INTIMATE RELATIONS is nothing special.  The film is too 
long and too repetitive -- we get the point well before the final, 
inevitable act.  In many ways, this movie seems to be trying to 
recapture the spirit and feel of Peter Jackson's courageous, original 
HEAVENLY CREATURES.  Indeed, there are some similarities -- the slightly 
exaggerated fashion with which '50s families are depicted, the way that 
simple domestic discord grows into something that's increasingly more 
ominous, and the manner in which obsession is shown to short-circuit all 
rational thought.  INTIMATE RELATIONS is a more pedestrian film, 
however.  It lacks the artistry and the character depth that Jackson 
brought to his breakthrough feature.</P>
<P>     Veteran actress Julie Walters (best known for her role in EDUCATING 
RITA) is wonderful as Marjorie.  It's a little chilling how easily her 
character switches from the British version of June Cleaver (who would 
rather "be dead than brazen") to the pathetic, sex-starved woman who 
crawls her way into Howard's bed every night.  Rupert Graves (THE 
MADNESS OF KING GEORGE) is almost, but not quite, as good as the object 
of Marjorie's obsession.  Howard sees himself as a victim, although, in 
fact, he shares equal responsibility for starting the affair.  He just 
didn't expect to be trapped by a woman with a FATAL ATTRACTION.  
Newcomer Laura Sadler, who plays Marjorie's teenage daughter, brings an 
appealing mix of innocence, eroticism, and cunning to the most complex 
role in the film.</P>
<P>     Ultimately, I appreciated the ideas in INTIMATE RELATIONS more than 
the presentation.  Things feel a little too over-familiar at times, as 
if I've seen them before, and it isn't hard to guess how the story will 
end (consequently, it seems to take forever to get to that point).  
Also, from time-to-time, the characters are designed more as tools to be 
used in service of Goodhew's themes than as unique individuals.  These 
elements conspire to weaken the film just enough that the mixture of 
drama, suspense, and dark comedy fails to gel properly.  As a result, 
while INTIMATE RELATIONS makes an important statement, it does so in a 
forum that often feels clunky and awkward.</P>
