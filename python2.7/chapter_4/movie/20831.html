<P>IN SHORT: A teen dateflick, and not a bad bit of story either.</P>
<P>Anybody want to talk Generation Gap? Cranky walked in to the sneak of
Drive Me Crazy, thinking it's title was copped from a Fine Young
Cannibals song back around '86 but, no, it turns out it's from a Britney
Spears song. Oh God, I feel so old. Even worse when it's pointed out
that one of the parental units in this flick graduated from High School
the year before I did. If I had followed my breeder instincts, I could
be lugging my teenkids to the screening (and they, of course, would want
me hiding in the back so they could disavow all knowledge of my
actions). I didn't, so I'm stuck with my fingers in the popcorn while
the kidlets cackle all around me.</P>
<P>And cackle they did. Other aged reviewers were muttering "two weeks and
it's on video" which may be true, but the story is solid and better
written than a lot of the stuff we sit through, and there are enough
demographically targeted jokes (ie. things I didn't get) that Drive Me
Crazy will probably find its proper audience.</P>
<P>Rather than centering around the prom, and all its associated angst and
anxiety, the big party for the students of Timothy Zonin High is the
school's Centennial Celebration. Pretty and popular and on the
Organizing Committee is perky Nicole Maris (Melissa Joan Hart) who, for
all her good points, is still waiting for basketball star Brad (Gabriel
Carpenter) to ask her out. Next door neighbor Chase Hammond (Adrian
Grenier), formerly Nicole's pal and now just the guy next door, prefers
to hang out with the intellectual crowd at the local college coffee bar.
A spat with lust of his life Dulcie (Ali Larter) which coincidentally
hits about the time that Brad asks a rival school's cheerleader to the
Ball, pairs our kidlets in a scheme to win back the perceived loves of
their lives.</P>
<P>Nicole transforms Chase from a Geek to a GapKid, to the horror of his
net-surfin', eGamer friends. She, in turn, learns a true lesson about
the real nature of love. Both of them, to their horror, discover that
parental units have love lives too (in this case played out by Faye
Grant and Stephen Collins as Nicole's divorced parents and William
Converse-Roberts as Chase's widowed dad). There's a full span of kidlet
types filling in the gaps, and all the acting is professional and to the
point. The target is kids. The soundtrack is for kids and the kids
around me munched their popcorn and candy and went home happy. Game
over.</P>
<P>Parents out there who e-mail me about sex and language in these
teenflicks need not worry. There's no nudity and the language isn't any
worse than it was when we were in high school two decades back.
&lt;sigh&gt;</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Drive Me Crazy, he would have
paid...</P>
<PRE>$5.00</PRE>
<P>It's a dateflick for the teens. Painless but way out of the market for
us old fogeys.</P>
