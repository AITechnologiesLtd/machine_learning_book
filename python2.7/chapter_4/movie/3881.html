<PRE>                                   THE NET
                       A film review by Jeffrey Graebner
                        Copyright 1995 Jeffrey Graebner</PRE>
<P>     With THE NET, Sandra Bullock has once again taken a film that
could have been a complete loser and made it quite enjoyable.  She has
an extremely natural charm that is just incredibly appealing to me.
The main reason that the movie worked for me was that I found myself to
be *instantly* sympathetic towards her.  There are very few actors out
there that are able to project such a high level of instant
likability. (Someone should consider casting her as a villain one of
these times.  I have a hunch such a move would be quite disturbing,
particularly if the character's nature turned out to be a surprise.)</P>
<P>     From a plausibility standpoint, the film is something of a
mixed-bag.  The very basic idea of someone's identity being erased via
manipulation of computer records is presented in a way that isn't hard
to believe.  It is a bit of a paranoid fantasy, but that kind of
paranoia has often been the basis of this type of thriller.  In
reality, the whole idea probably *isn't* that completely far-fetched.
Society has become awfully dependent on computer records and computer
security isn't as tight as we would probably like it to be.</P>
<P>     What is pretty outlandish is the larger plot that is the basis of
the whole situation.  Bullock's situation results when she stumbles on
a conspiracy so sweeping that only Oliver Stone would be likely to
believe it.  Luckily, the story doesn't typically take center stage in
the film.  It is Bullock's down- to-Earth performance that kept me from
thinking too much about the basic implausibilities of the story.</P>
<P>     The film is generally pretty good with the computer-related
details, although it does occasionally spruce things up a bit for the
camera.  The movie does include some unlikely uses of voice synthesis
as well as some screen displays that are more photogenic than they
really need to be (this movie contains yet another example of the
"photogenic computer virus" that seems to be popular in movies right
now).  For the most part, though, the filmmakers manage to get much of
the language right and the computers aren't usually given capabilities
beyond the realm of possibility.  Those of us that are real-life
computer nuts will tend to appreciate the accuracy of the terminology,
even if much of it may go right past many viewers.</P>
<P>     While Bullock's performance is the heart and soul of this film,
the supporting cast is also good.  As the villain, Jeremy Northam
provides an appropriate mix of charm and menace.  The best part of the
performance is that he is able to bring an odd *warmth* to the
character that makes him all the more hateful.  Villains in this type
of film typically have much colder personalities, making Northam's
performance something of a refreshing change.  As the only friend that
Bullock is able to trust, Dennis Miller brings some welcome, although
brief, comic-relief to the film.</P>
<P>     During much of this movie, director Irwin Winkler appears to
believe that he is making a tribute to Alfred Hitchcock.  There are a
few scenes that seem to be taken almost shot-for-shot out of classic
Hitchcock films.  In fact, the whole film really feels like a
modernized Hitchcock movie.  It doesn't quite have the plot ingenuity
that Hitchcock managed, but Bullock's character certainly has all the
makings of one of Hitch's "everyman" protagonists.</P>
<P>     Largely thanks to the extremely welcome presence of Sandra
Bullock, THE NET is one of this summer's most satisfying and
entertaining thrillers.  It should advance Bullock one more step
towards superstardom.</P>
