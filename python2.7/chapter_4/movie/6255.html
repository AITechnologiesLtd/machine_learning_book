<P>     A community is being terrorized by a brutal, almost supernaturally
vicious man-eater, frightening the residents into a state of panic.  The
local authority figure wants to do something to stop the killing, but his
supervisor is more interested in economic concerns, and does not heed the
warnings.  Then one attack becomes the last straw, and an eccentric killer
of the man-eaters is brought in to eliminate the menace.  Together, the
local authority figure and the eccentric hunter set out alone on a quest
that becomes almost personal.</P>
<P>     PAWS.  CLAWS.  GAPING MAWS.  Pick your favorite (or least obnoxious)
analogy-inspiring epithet, because no matter how stridently the makers of
THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS insist that it is "based on a true story," it
owes at least as much to JAWS as it does to real life.  The place is
Africa and the year is 1898, but it could just as easily by Amity Island
in 1975; engineer John Henry Patterson (Val Kilmer), supervising the
building of a bridge for a railroad line, is our Sheriff Brody, great
white hunter Charles Remington (Michael Douglas) is Quint, and Patterson's
boss Beaumont (Tom Wilkinson) is the mayor.  And of course, one impossibly
large and single-minded great white shark is replaced by two impossibly
large and single-minded lions.  All right, so there isn't a Matt Hooper to
be found, but don't try to tell me this comparison is a reach, especially
when there is a scene in which Patterson and Remington attempt to attract
their prey by laying down what amounts to a chum line around a building
where they are lying in wait.</P>
<P>     Ordinarily, it is be a remarkably bad idea for a film in any genre
to make such obvious references to the classics of its genre, because they
only serve to emphasize that you are not watching a much better movie of
the same kind.  Yet there is something fairly satisfying about THE GHOST
AND THE DARKNESS, because it is a kind of suspense film you just don't see
very often.  A force of nature in its own element can be a truly
frightening thing; give that force of nature a vaguely unnatural
personality, and you've got the ingredients for one scary piece of work.
Screenwriter William Goldman knows what works in this kind of film, and
when the lions are on the prowl in THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS, it is
surprisingly gripping.  Director Stephen Hopkins (BLOWN AWAY) directs his
action scenes with efficiency and a sense of barely-controlled chaos, and
he is able to make the lions' every appearance a time to scoot to the edge
of your seat.  He may be no Spielberg, but that's even true of Spielberg
sometimes.</P>
<P>     The reason THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS never approaches JAWS in
overall quality is what happens between the attacks.  The performances are
almost uniformly under-stated, with Val Kilmer doing solid work as the
confident Patterson, and John Kani and Brian McCardie are appealing as two
of Patterson's colleagues on the bridge project.  However, they all find
themselves saddled with characterizations which hover somewhere between
spare and insufficient.  That is even more true of Douglas' Remington than
it is of the other characters -- he is a hunter with a tortured past whose
one moment of introspection is supposed to define his entire personality.
Douglas is an actor given to playing characters broadly, and even though
he is relatively restrained he still appears to be camping it up compared
to his co-stars.  You never care nearly as much about the individual
humans in THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS as you should, because you don't
really know who they are.</P>
<P>     Still, at least there _are_ characters in THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS,
and at least their confrontations with their adversaries get your
adrenaline pumping.  There is a tremendous primal appeal to the battle
between man and beast, and with cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond providing
glorious photography and Jerry Goldsmith turning in one of his most
effective recent scores, THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS turns it into solid,
suspenseful film-making.  Perhaps there is less inherent claustrophobic
tension when you take the men out of a boat and put them on dry land, but
THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS makes sure you understand who has the home
field advantage here.  You may feel as though you have seen some of this
before, but you haven't seen it in a long time, and you might realize that
you have been missing it.  Classics are few and far between; THE GHOST AND
THE DARKNESS just puts Patterson in a tree, the tree on the savannah,
lions on the savannah.  Farewell and adieu to you fair Spanish ladies...</P>
