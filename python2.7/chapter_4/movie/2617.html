<PRE>                             THE FLINTSTONES
                       A film review by Jon A. Webb
                        Copyright 1994 Jon A. Webb</PRE>
<P>     THE FLINTSTONES is Spielberg's trompe l'oeil production of the
Hanna-Barbara cartoon series, and it is much better than the original.
The artistic trick here is to combine the technical wizardry of
JURASSIC PARK with a serious attempt to match the style of the cartoon
series as much as possible.  Thus we have John Goodman looking
remarkably like Fred, Rosie O'Donnell giggling just like Betty, and
live-action versions of all the familiar opening and closing scenes
from the cartoon.  You're probably aware of this if you've watched any
media in the last few weeks, because of all the commercial tie-ins.</P>
<P>     Comparing this film with, say, THE ADDAMS FAMILY, the latter is
much the superior work.  It had a core point (acceptance of weirdness)
that just isn't present here. Arguable, the Addams family film had more
to work with, but a lot of what was in the film was an elaboration of
the core philosophy from the television series.  The difference is,
here only the style of the series has been elaborated, and the core
meaning of the work is still empty and shallow.  In the Addams family
films, particularly the sequel, the ideas take off in the more rich
environment of film, and say something new.</P>
<P>     I think that I must be getting a little tired of Spielberg's
production values, since they seem to be so perfectly respected here,
with every possible joke about the mixture of modern and prehistoric
times made, and made well, and I still found the film a little dull.
The film just never seems to take off.  Of course, neither did the
cartoon series--it was definitely second-rate stuff--but here you
also have the certain knowledge that every possible commercial angle of
this artistic work will be explored.</P>
<P>     The style of the film, as I implied above, is very consistent, and
a great elaboration of the cartoon series. The art direction and script
are great, and full of all sorts of jokes about prehistoric suburban
life.  The direction is great in reconstructing the style and feeling
of the original as much as possible.</P>
<P>     Goodman is great as Fred, and Rosie O'Donnell is a standout as
Betty.  She brings a kind of nervous, luscious sensuality to the role.
I thought Rick Moranis delivered a little less than he should have as
Barney, and Elizabeth Perkins just disappeared into her roles as Wilma:
she wasn't asked to do much, but she didn't do anything extra either.
I found Kyle MacLachlan's performance as the evil Yuppie a
disappointment; I'd like to see him really connect with a role as he
did with Lynch, but this isn't it.</P>
