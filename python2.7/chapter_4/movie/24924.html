<PRE>A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Ray (Woody Allen) is a hapless criminal who hatches the idea to rob a bank 
with a couple of his buddies. His brilliant idea involves buying a run-down 
pizza joint next to the bank, and turning it into a cookie selling business. 
Ray's wife Frenchy (Tracey Ullman, playing one person, and one person only) 
would watch, sell, and bake the merchandise. At the same time, the men would 
work downstairs on digging a tunnel that should eventually pop up into the 
bank vault. Ray's very surprised when the plan fails, but is even more 
shocked when the cookies become a major success. People line up for hours 
just to taste them. Soon they have a multi-million dollar corporation on 
their hands.</P>
<P>Their company, Sunset Cookies, becomes a household name and an American 
cookie favorite. As we learn from a very funny mock episode of 60 Minutes 
featuring Steve Croft, each player in the bank robbery now has a part in the 
company. One man is in charge of transportation, and another head of safety. 
It appears Ray and Frenchy have the life and wealth they always dreamed of, 
but Frenchy wants more. To her, being rich isn't about the money, but about 
having class. It's things like books, food, wine, and a good vocabulary that 
matter to her. So she hires a scholar named David (Hugh Grant) to teach her 
the finer things in life. The couple begins to grow apart. Ray starts 
spending time with Frenchy's dimwitted sister May (Elaine May) doing things 
that echo their old life, and Frenchy thinks it's time to re-evaluate their 
marriage.</P>
<P>This film's packed full of wit and humor. The wisecracking Frenchy has some 
great lines and is a good match for Allen's style of deadpan comedy. One of 
my favorite scenes is a dinner party that Frenchy attends. She believes that 
memorizing the dictionary one letter section at a time is the best way to 
increase her vocabulary. During the party, she attempts to impress people 
with her sophisticated terminology using phrases like, "Her ambidextrous 
acrobatics were deserving of applause." She also insists on being called 
Frances instead of Frenchy. Woody Allen does a great job in his role. I truly 
believe that his best movies include him playing a character, and not 
himself. Woody gets to wear shorts in the movie, perhaps giving us more of 
his scraggly self then we wanted to see. Shorts notwithstanding, the guy 
stills makes great movies at 64 after writing forty films, and directing over 
thirty. He is a comic genius of our time. Another character I loved was May. 
Elaine May makes her dense role as Frenchy's slow cousin the hit of the 
movie. May never quite catches onto things, but is easy to love. She 
definitely steals the show. Also making good use of their small roles are 
Hugh Grant, who does his usual posh English gentleman thing while Elaine 
Strich recovers marvelously from the recent Screwed. The trailers prominently 
display Michael Rapaport and Jon Lovitz in key roles, but in actuality they 
are only bit characters. Regardless of how much screen time they get, all of 
the actors have staggering chemistry while on screen.</P>
<P>Woody Allen has created a movie that is sharp, smart, and clever. This 
amiable comedy succeeds in making the audience laugh. Adults will rejoice 
with the material presented. Kids may not fully understand the humor, but 
Small Time Crooks is perfectly appropriate for them too. Crooks becomes 
slightly contrived near its ending, but never to the point where it becomes 
too predictable. Small Time Crooks is a comedy about finding our place in 
society topped off with the traditional old jazz tunes that only Woody could 
select. This movie manages to be risible without being raunchy or disgusting. 
The film is a treat, and the perfect summer comedy alternative for adults.</P>
