<PRE>  THE GIRAFFE (German/Swiss, In English and German with subtitles)
         A review by Mark R. Leeper in bullet-list form
           from the Toronto Internation Film Festival</PRE>
<P>     CAPSULE: An anti-Semitic incident in Germany sparks a murder and
starts events connected with a 50-year old mystery involving the
Holocaust and two people claiming to be the same person.  This is a
well-crafted thriller.  Rating: 8 (0 to 10), high +2 (-4 to +4) Minor
spoilers in this review.</P>
<P>   - Dani Levi directed.  He and Maria Schrader co-wrote, and star.
   - Two women unknowingly share the same identity.  When the factory
     of a wealthy Jew in Germany is torched by anti-Semites, and it
     appears in a New York newspaper, an American Holocaust survivor
     recognizes the victim as her own father whom she had assumed was
     killed by the Nazis.  She tries to contact her father only to find
     out that there is a woman in Germany who has lived in her father's
     household since the war also claiming to be the same daughter.
     Two elderly women are each sure they are the same person.  When
     the New Yorker is mysteriously murdered, her son decides to
     investigate the mystery on his own.
   - Action takes place in New York and in Germany.
   - Daughter of the German woman and the son of the American woman
     form an uneasy alliance to try to find out what has happened,
     against the recommendation of a Jewish Defense League lawyer
     played by Davis Strathairn.
   - Some of early action is intentionally mysterious to be intriguing.
   - View of New York Orthodox (but not Hassidic) community.  Includes
     such stereotypic roles as the matchmaker.
   - A complex plot told in a crisp style.
   - Director has a real ethnic mix of characters in New York.</P>
