<PRE>         !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<P>STRAWBERRY AND CHOCOLATE, is one of those films that is hard not to like,
and at the same time, one wonders what is it that makes it good.  It
vacillates between being a political film, and a personal film, and one
might wish that this would have been resolved some, to make the film easier
to go along with.</P>
<P>The personal part of the film, is a nice story about a man, who is gay, who
takes an attraction to another man.  Instead of becoming lovers, they become
good friends, even if they are on opposite side of things on a political,
and personal, scale.</P>
<P>And then, on the other hand, is a slight political story, that is not
vicious, but is tremendously suggestive that the war on Cuba
is mainly about how well hidden one has to keep their personal intents,
politically, so not to get over run by people who are so
eager to satisfy the state, and get paid for it.  It plays people against
people, and damages any kind of social structure.</P>
<P>The other story is more interesting, although hardly developed. The gay man
is a writer, possibly a subversive one by the Cuban standards, but he will
not give up his "underground" fight to get books into the country, and add
more "freedom" into their culture, specially the intellectual kind.  He is
involved in artistic circles, and his previous lover, an artist, has an art
show pending, but he has a problem which may be stopping him as well, which
is, he is also gay, in a society, where it is considered wrong, and
basically punished with being cast out.</P>
<P>This may be the real theme in the film. The young man, who is being pursued,
does not fall for the trickery and the games the gay man plays, but their
friendship teaches the gay man something about being honest and direct,
rather than tricky.  At the same time, it hurts to learn all this, in a
society where it isn't permissible.  And although the film resolves well for
the young man, it does not for the gay ones, which is the only solution that
pretty much would help the film get made in Cuba, and not throw these people
in jail.</P>
<P>It is believed that the authorities in Cuba have opened up the arts some,
but if this film is an indication, and it was partially
smuggled, and shot clandestinely in that country, thanks to the efforts of
some Mexican and Spanish people.  But the arts are still
grossly held up to a ridicule and criticism, by a hypocritical standard that
pretty much rules people into the ground.  A sign
that the communist Cuba, under Fidel, still is held together by a little
more than strings and rubber bands.</P>
<P>One can only hope that this is a sign that this country has an art form
which is due to break out.  The question is when, a leader
will realize the potential it has, not only to put people to work, but also
to create revenues from abroad. STRAWBERRY AND CHOCOLATE, is not a great
film, but it has a special appeal that is hard to let go. The film is
choppy, an obvious result of its sporadic shooting style, but it manages to
get it together in a reasonable fashion, not tied up neatly because the
whole film is not tied up from the word go.  It shows much promise, it
really does, and this is important.</P>
<P>Worth seeing, if only to realize that Cuba is probably going to join the
world map of arts pretty soon... count on it.</P>
