<PRE>                           U.S. MARSHALS 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                  1 :-(  in remembrance of THE FUGITIVE</PRE>
<P>Cast: Tommy Lee Jones, Wesley Snipes, Robert Downey Jr., Joe Pantoliano,
Tom Wood, Lorenzo Clemons, Ray Toler, LaTanya Richardson, Kate Nelligan,
Irene Jacob
Director: Stuart Baird
Producers: Anne Kopelson, Arnold Kopelson
Screenplay: John Pogue</P>
<P>My general impression of U.S. Marshals was, ‘Oh no, not again'. Not that
this is an overtly bad film, its just very second rate and mediocre when
compared to its predecessor, THE FUGITIVE. How can one not compare it to
the well-crafted, 1993 thriller, starring Harrison Ford? Let's face it,
our new fugitive, Wesley Snipes, ex-federal agent, who is framed for
trading secrets to the Chinese Government, doesn't carry the same
charisma or crowd appeal as the perpetually, likeable Ford.</P>
<P>Part of the problem lies with the fact that the audience does not quite
identify or empathise with our present fugitive, Mark Sheridan (Snipes).
He kills two federal agents in self-defence – so what? Who cares? Secret
service agents get killed for a living. Whilst in the case of Dr Richard
Kimble (Harrison Ford) – his wife was brutally murdered and he was
framed for the crime. Now people, as a general rule, get quite upset
when personal items like wives and family members get slaughtered.</P>
<P>Besides not spending enough time, developing our fugitive's plight, too
much time is focussed on the Deputy Marshall Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee
Jones) and his group of uninteresting, deputy buffoons. Basically, Lee
Jones gets to show what a real ‘Jock' his character can be.  Whilst his
deputies mope about, like a bunch of non-professional idiots sipping
coffee, cracking unfunny-smart-arse-jokes and occasionally getting
themselves killed. Most humorous of all is a spaced-out, tired-looking
Robert Downey Jr, who perhaps would have fared better off the set, and
in the comfort zone of rehab instead.</P>
<P>There are some memorable scenes, like Snipes swinging of a high rise
with cable in hand and then escaping on top of a train. But these tense
moments are far and few in between, and perhaps they shouldn't have
bothered to bring back U.S. MARSHALS, if it was only to let the fugitive
get away again.</P>
