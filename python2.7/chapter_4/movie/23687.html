<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Brian De Palma's idea of a thriller is short-changed as far as plot and
substance in favor of style. He has created a silly but entertaining
film, where one shocking scene tops another, and numerous Hollywood
cheesy gimmicks are used instead of relying on John Farris' tightly
drawn suspense story. Tis a pity such crass commercialization should
rule the day for De Palma, instead of artistic integrity! This follow-up
to his commercially successful Carrie, takes the director further into
the ridiculous realm of demonic possessions and all that would imply to
a Hollywood director who is looking to make a popcorn movie.</P>
<P>It is 1977 and someplace in Israel the widowed Peter Sandza (Kirk
Douglas) is on the beach with his teenager son Robin (Andrew Stevens),
and colleague, Childress (John Cassavetes), who have known each other
for some twenty years, where they both work at a secret government
agency for psychic research. Suddenly, after Robin is told by his dad
that he will be going to a special school in Chicago for his psychic
gifts, he is alone with Childress and a group of Arabs arrive by boat
and an Arab machine-gunner on a tower starts shooting at Peter, but he
escapes and grabs a dead Arab's gun, wounding Childress when he realizes
that he is behind the attack. Childress kidnaps Robin because he has a
special gift for telekinetic communication, which he intends to use for
secretive government activities.</P>
<P>The next thing we know, we're in Chicago and Peter is looking for his
son, but is being tailed by Childress's secret federal agents. Peter has
hired the psychic Raymond Dunwoodie to get him a more gifted psychic to
track down Robin. But Dunwoodie is being tailed by Childress' men and
they trace Peter to a hotel through him. Peter jumps out of his hotel
window in his underwear, bursts into someone's apartment and steals
their clothes and dyes his hair, and goes out into the Chicago streets.
But his disguise wasn't good enough, as he is spotted by the secret
agents. So he car jacks a brand new Caddy, with two of Chicago's finest
sitting in it and takes them for a daredevil ride, trying to avoid the
pursuing agents. There's some comedy to be had, as the policeman who
owns the car, only hopes his brand new car doesn't get scratched, and
after riding over bridges in the fog and other dangerous crossings at
high speed, the car doesn't have a scratch on it. But at the last
minute, Peter has to drive the car into the lake in order to fool his
pursuers of his whereabouts.</P>
<P>The story also tells about another psychic, a teenager, Gillian Bellaver
(Amy Irving). She comes from a wealthy family and was the one that
Dunwoodie was about to get for Peter before he was spotted by the secret
agents. Gillian has trouble with the children in her prep school because
of her genius in psychic powers; she therefore talks her mother into
enrolling her in a special school that does research in these matters,
little realizing that Childress monitors the school.</P>
<P>Peter has been looking the last eleven months for Robin to no avail. But
he met someone who works in the research clinic, Hester (Snodgrass), and
she believed him when she heard his story. She keeps him in contact with
any developments in the clinic, and when Gillian arrives and
demonstrates that she is the real thing, by making everyone she touches
bleed profusely and also has disturbing visions, there is little doubt
that she's the real thing. Peter is told about her. But, unfortunately,
there are spies in the clinic, like Dr. Ellen Lindstrom (Rossen), who
tell Childress about her. The director of the clinic, Dr. Jim McKeever
(Durning), is forced to let Childress take her, even though he doesn't
want to let her go to these awful people. The girl has the same power as
Robin and the two can even communicate with each other when at far
distances through their ESP skills.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Robin is told his father is dead (I wonder- if he's such a
great psychic why doesn't he realize that this isn't so!). He has been
taken to a secret estate where a team of psychics are training him. He
has developed his psychic skills to a great degree but has also
developed a serious personality disorder and is being constantly drugged
and is under constant stress. The attractive Dr. Susan Charles (Fiona)
is in charge of his training program and tries to keep the young man
happy by providing him with her sexual pleasures, which he appreciates;
but, he still distrusts her.</P>
<P>Any hope for this being a plot oriented film soon goes down the drain
and the movie turns into a horror film, with special effects galore,
rolling demonic flashing eyes, and shocking scenes with blood and gore.
The two special psychic prodigies have different reactions to
discovering there is another like them in the world. Robin is jealous,
figuring she will replace him and he will no longer get such good
treatment. She, on the other hand, wants to help him, after Hester tells
her of what is going on. Peter plans to get her to escape from the
clinic, and to show him where his son is. The escape works but is
costly, as Hester suffers a gruesome death, as she is hit by a car
driven by one of the agents who was just shot by Peter.</P>
<P>The final scene is the most tawdry and bloodiest one of all, as Peter
sees his antagonistic son suspend himself in mid-air and a few dead
bodies lie on the floor, with blood splattered all over the walls, and
when he tries to rescue him from this evil house, they both fall to
their death from the ledge. But if you hang around for the ending, then
you will finally see Childress get what he deserves the next morning, as
he comes into Gillian's bedroom and sweet talks her into believing that
he will treat her as a father would, knowing that he needs her powers
with the demise of Robin. But Gillian rolls her supernatural eyes and
blinds him, and then explodes his head, which De Palma shoots again and
again in slow motion. How wonderful!</P>
<P>Cassavetes is a great villain. But there's really not much in this film
that is plausible, except a chance to escape from the world for two
hours.</P>
