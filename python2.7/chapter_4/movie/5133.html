<PRE>                           ANNE FRANK REMEMBERED
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This documentary contains just about
          all that is known about Anne Frank and her diary
          that one cannot get from the diary itself.  After
          having been a best-seller, a popular play, and a
          film there is little need to replay the contents of
          the diary in more than a superficial manner.  Jon
          Blair's account tells us fairly completely the rest
          of the story.  There are, thank goodness, a decent
          number of documentaries about the Holocaust, but
          this one does one of the best jobs of bringing the
          events down to human terms--precisely the virtue
          that the diary had.  Anne Frank is presented not as
          a saint but as a human with faults.  This film won
          the Academy Award for Best Feature-length
          Documentary for very good reason.  Rating: +3 (-4
          to +4)</PRE>
<P>     When I write a review of a film, particularly a historical film, I
often try to give context for the story in the film.  I try to create a
frame to surround the film telling many of the incidental things that
would be of interest to a viewer.  That is what the feature-length
documentary ANNE FRANK REMEMBERED does for the book THE DIARY OF ANNE
FRANK and its dramatic adaptations.  It generally assumes that the
viewer has read or seen some version of the true story of the Jewish
family that hid from the Nazis for two years in the cramped attic of an
Amsterdam factory.  Instead of having extensive excerpts from the book,
this account tells the viewer nearly everything else of value to
someone who is experiencing the story.  It starts with the background
of the Frank family, their lives and especially their times.  Anecdotes
are told of Anne's school experiences.  The film tells how the Frank
family went into hiding and gives a quick summary of their lives those
two years in the stifling attic.  There Anne's closest confidant was
the diary she had been given on her 13th birthday.  After telling how
the family was betrayed and captured it goes into detail about their
lives and the lives of people they knew in the camps.  It tells of the
death of Anne Frank and her sister.  The liberation, the re-discovery
of the diary, its publishing, public reaction, the play the film, and
authenticity challenges are all covered.  This is everything known
about the story Anne Frank and her diary that one cannot get from the
book itself.</P>
<P>     Jon Blair, who previously made the documentary SCHINDLER, had to
be not just skillful but extraordinarily lucky to find some of the
material presented.  Details about Anne and her personal life are
presented by Hanneli Goslar, Anne's friend from age four.  They were
separated by Anne's hiding, but she coincidentally was able to find
Anne when they both were interned at Bergen-Belsen concentration camp
and was nearby when Anne died.  One interview brings out the mixed
emotions toward Anne of Peter Pepper, the son of the dentist who shared
Anne's hiding place and whom Anne dubbed Dr. Idiot.  During the period
of hiding Anne seemed to conflict with every adult in the attic except
her beloved father and these conflicts seem to make her even more real.
Blair is even able to interview one of the burglars who preyed on the
factory below the attic.  In Anne's accounts of these incidents the
Franks could do nothing but wait in silence for the criminals to leave
for fear of letting be known their presence.  The one major question
that Blair must leave unanswered is who it was who eventually betrayed
the hiding place of the Frank family.</P>
<P>     Blair recreates in harrowing detail the life that Anne must have
led in the camps and the fates of the people who hid in the attic.
Only Otto Frank survived, but there is information and eyewitness
accounts of what happened to most of the people from the attic.  Blair
documents how Anne's spirit was broken as she went from Westerbrook to
Auschwitz to her death from disease at Bergen-Belsen.  Blair speculates
that had she held on to that spirit she could have survived the month
between her death and liberation.</P>
<P>     Blair mixes 1940s footage with material he shot and interviews
with people who are now dead.  Some of the people he brought together
for the first time since the 1940s.  The film is narrated by Kenneth
Branagh and selections are read from the diary by Glenn Close.  While
the photography is mostly understated, there is occasionally a haunting
image in the photography.  One shot makes the tower over the railroad
entrance to Auschwitz look extraordinarily like the head of some giant
ogre with glowing eyes from some fairy tale that could not match for
violence what actually took place here.</P>
<P>     I suppose I would rate ANNE FRANK REMEMBERED a +3 on the -4 to +4
scale, though I have not given it the same sort of thought I usually
give a rating.  I take the subject of the Holocaust very seriously and
would have a very hard time objectively comparing this film to, say,
RICHARD III or THE GODFATHER.</P>
