<PRE>THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Copyright 1998 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>Chow Yun-Fat is a world renowned actor from Hong Kong, largely known for
his incredible work with John Woo.  But, like all other things that are not
American, he's not known well here in the US.  The Replacement Killers aims
to change that.  But, can it?</P>
<P>John Lee (Chow Yun-Fat) is a hitman for hire.   Asian crime syndicate boss,
Terrance Wei (Kenneth Tsang),  wants the son of police officer Stan Zedkov
(Michael Rooker) dead.  Wei hires Lee to do the hit, but* while Lee has
cross-hairs trained on the young boy, he's unable to do the job.  John Lee
might be a killer for hire, but there are things that he cannot do.  Wei
finds this unacceptable and Wei, now gone mad, wants a lot of blood.  Wei
brings in the replacement killers.  While trying to make a run out of the
US, Lee needs the help of Meg Coburn (Mira Sorvino) who is a master
document forger.</P>
<P>That's as far as the story goes.  The script by Ken Sanzel is weak and
flimsy.  It's an excuse for first-time director Anton Fuqua to move from
action scene to action scene.  Chow Yun-Fat is given only a handful of
lines to perform and the rest of the film is him running around with dual
pistols.</P>
<P>I mentioned earlier that Chow Yun-Fat is a world renowned actor.  I stress
the word actor.  It seems like in the case of The Replacement Killers,
Hollywood has tried to boil Chow Yun-Fat down to just a typical "action
hero."  This is a sad thing to do, for Chow Yun-Fat is more than just that.</P>
<P>Anton Fuqua, a former music video director, tries hard to pay homage to
John Woo (who is one of the producers.)  It's unfortunate that rookie Fuqua
is unable to create the same type of action that master Woo can.  Fuqua
uses all sorts of Woo's tricks including Woo's signature slow-mo shots.
But, the feel of Fuqua's direction is purely mechanical.  And this
mechanical feeling goes all around; from actors to production crew.
Everyone seems to be "just going through the motions."</P>
<P>Yes, there are a lot of action sequences, but the problem is that Fuqua is
never able to inject the adrenaline into the sequences.  The sequences are
highly derivative and flat.</P>
<P>There were no real memorable action sequences from The Replacement Killers.
The action flies from office, to restaurants, to car washes, and to dance
clubs without any real connection to them.  I think that the movie would
have worked out if the characters weren't so one dimensional.  Mira
Sorvino's Meg is bland and we don't seem to care about her. Chow Yun-Fat's
John Lee is equally bland.  My test for bland action heroes? Easy: if the
hero gets shot in the shoulder (where most action heroes get shot) does the
audience cringe in sympathetic pain, or not?  I didn't cringe when John Lee
was shot in the shoulder.</P>
<P>The one redeeming quality of The Replacement Killers is the studio's
perceived big selling point of the film, Chow Yun-Fat. Though he is not
given enough to do to show how good of an actor he really is, he brings a
sort of charm and grace to his part.  It's hard to describe Chow Yun-Fat
and the way that he is onscreen.  He is suave, cool, and smooth.  And he
just looks good with two pistols in hand.  I just wish the script had more
for Chow Yun-Fat to do.</P>
<P>It's hard for me to recommend a mediocre action film like The Replacement
Killers.  If it had not been for the presence of the ever-cool Chow
Yun-Fat, there would be no merit to this film.  But, since this is the
first American Chow Yun-Fat film, it serves as an introduction to him for
many.  And for that reason, I lightly recommend this film.  The Replacement
Killers plays like it should logically play from a music video director, if
you really think about it. The movie feels like a ninety minute music
video.  See this film at a matinee showing or on video.</P>
<P>If you think that Chow Yun-Fat is cool and would like to see more of him,
check out some of these older films that he did with John Woo.  I would
recommend these Woo/Fat films:  The Killer, A Better Tomorrow, and my
ever-favourite Hard-Boiled.  These films will wow you more than The
Replacement Killers.</P>
