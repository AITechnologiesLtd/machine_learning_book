<PRE>PRACTICAL MAGIC
A film review by David N. Butterworth

<P>        So I took my little sister to see "Practical Magic" because it
seemed like a better choice than "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer - The
Movie" (even though "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer - The Movie" features a
new version of 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer' by Clint Black).
"Practical Magic" stars Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman who play sisters
who are also latter-day witches, and if you've seen anything else with
Nicole in it you'll know this isn't much of a stretch for her.  She plays
the slutty witch with the red hair whose freewheeling lifestyle gets her
into trouble.  Sandra plays the good witch with the black hair who has hung
up her broomstick and decided not to dabble in the black arts.  She wants a
normal life with a husband and two kids (one has black hair, the other red,
coincidentally) and a business selling shampoos, soaps, and body oils.  If
you've seen anything else with Sandra in it you'll know this isn't much of
a stretch for her.  Unfortunately Sandra and Nicole are the latest in a
long line of witches who have been landed with a nasty curse: any man who
falls in love with an Owens woman is doomed.  To sit through this movie,
they mean.  So I tried to keep my eyes off Sandra and Nicole as much as
possible, lest I fall in love with either of them, and marvel instead at
Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest who play the girls' over-stuffed, campy
witch aunts, with whom they are forced to live and eat chocolate for
breakfast.  Stockard essentially recreates her over-stuffed, campy role as
a bordello proprietor in "Moll Flanders."  Dianne says something
funny--there's a big dramatic pause right before she says it--but for the
life of me I can't remember what it was now.  Maybe it was during the
embarrassing "midnight margaritas" sequence.  That's part of the problem
with the film; it's not very funny (unless substituting a dustbuster for a
broom is a new sight gag for you).  On the other hand, Sandra's tears are
quite convincing when her husband gets run over by a truck--think what she
could do if a storyline required her to blubber for 90 minutes
straight--but that's the other problem with the film.  It's all over the
place.  It's part light romantic comedy, part sappy sentimental tearjerker,
part Tuesday night domestic violence drama, part murder mystery, and part
"Exorcist"-styled demonic possession flick, and none of this fits together
particularly well.  I asked my sister what she thought of the film and she
said it was a bit "slow."  But her biggest disappointment was that Aidan
Quinn, who plays an Arizona cop who comes looking for Nicole's missing
boyfriend, didn't take his shirt off.  As for the film's soundtrack...  Oh
geez.  Just when the film gets quiet or moving or poignant the filmmakers
force some loud, inappropriate pop song down our throats.  Thankfully
someone must have whispered something in Griffin Dunne's ear--Griffin
directed the picture with far too much soft-focus and hand-held camerawork
for my liking--about halfway through the film because the songs stop, just
like that, until Stevie Nicks, a self-confessed witch in her own right,
warbles a new version of Fleetwood Mac's 'Crystal' right at the end of the
movie, following it immediately with another sudser over the end credits.
This so that they could stamp a big "features two new songs by Stevie
Nicks" on the print ads, presumably.  Maybe Clint Black crooning 'Rudolph
the Red-Nosed Reindeer' wasn't such a bad idea after all.</P>
