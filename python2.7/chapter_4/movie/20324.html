Dudley Do-Right (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Mark O'Hara</PRE>

<P>It's difficult to name more than a few successful live-action adaptations of 
cartoons.</P>
<P>Try it.  If you said "The Flintstones" or "Dick Tracy," try again.  They may 
have brought in the change at the box office, but they are not good movies.  
Don't even think about "Mr. Magoo" or "Dennis the Menace."</P>
<P>Hugh Wilson's "Dudley Do-Right" belongs on the long-list of mediocre film 
fare, a mostly failed and random collection of hopeful plot turns and 
clichés.  Because of the premise, which is the inane exploits of Jay Ward's 
dull-witted Canadian Mountie, the story is lightly entertaining.  And in a 
few places we get to belly laugh at twists that have finally gone over the 
top.</P>
<P>The lonesome mounted policeman (Brendan Fraser) is sure his love, Nell 
Fenwick, will never return.  So Dudley busies himself with his duties.  One 
night he spots his childhood companion and nemesis, Snidely Whiplash (Alfred 
Molina).  Snidely is "salting" rocks with gold dust loaded into shotgun 
shells.  Why?  Well, because he wants to create a fake gold rush to this 
part of northern Canada, of course.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Nell (Sarah Jessica Parker) has returned with her multiple 
graduate degrees.  It seems she and Dudley will resume their relationship, 
until Snidely captures her attention.  This seems all wrong, of course;  as 
a watcher of the original in my childhood, I was expecting Snidely to be 
nothing but the bad guy - a sentiment Snidely himself mentions several times 
in self-reflexive asides.  (I also wanted Nell to kiss Horse, Dudley's 
mount, but no luck!)  What's more odd is that Hugh Wilson shows us an 
opening sequence in which the three main characters assume their roles in 
childhood, Snidely as a boy wearing a black cape and stovepipe hat, already 
sniping at Dudley for Nell's affections.</P>
<P>It turns out that Snidely is successful in his quest for  prospectors:  
Semi-Happy Valley is flooded with their money, and in a wink at marketing 
savvy, we see all types of merchandise with Snidely's image --  a self-hype 
that dives to the depths of money-grubbing.  What will stop Snidely's taking 
over the town  -- which is redubbed "Whiplash City"?  Certainly not Dudley, 
as he has been drummed out of the service by his idol, Inspector Fenwick 
(Robert Prosky).  We really have no idea why Dudley loses his job, except 
that Snidely has connections in Ottawa, and the Inspector never had much use 
for the square-jawed boob anyway.</P>
<P>Enter Eric Idle as a grimy prospector, only slightly removed from a grungy 
Gumby character on "Monty Python."  Kim Darling prospects for gold and finds 
a sizable nugget planted by Snidely.  Although he is catapulted into the 
front of the news about the gold discoveries, Darling serves as a sort of 
goofy mentor to Dudley, training him in the proper ways to fight Snidely's 
brand of evil.  What is original here is that Dudley attempts to be good by 
being bad - namely, by stealing gold from the thieves employed by Snidely!  
Will our hero prevail in his circuitous search for good?</P>
<P>The acting in "Dudley Do-Right" is superior to the plot.  Brendan Fraser is 
passable as the title character, but he was better in Jay Ward's "George of 
the Jungle."  This actor is good at looking surprised and duped, another 
feat he pulled off rather well in Wilson's "Blast From the Past."  (I would 
add that his role in "The Mummy" this past May did not particularly 
distinguish him as an action hero; he was much better as the gardener 
tempted by the fictionalized version of director James Whale in "Gods and 
Monsters.")  Although Fraser's hair should have been died to resemble the 
cartoon character's frizzy locks, he turns in a passing performance.</P>
<P>Underused is a good word to describe the roles of a few other characters.  
First, Robert Prosky is an old pro who is woefully absent from the film.  He 
appears but briefly and speaks in a British accent, his white mustache 
obscuring the British curve of his lips.  What a missed opportunity, having 
such a veteran actor on the set and using him merely as decoration!</P>
<P>Sarah Jessica Parker's part is also underwritten.  She could appear in more 
scenes, although she does a fine job in the ones that made the final cut.</P>
<P>Eric Idle is the one indispensable presence here.  He knows instinctively 
just how much exaggeration to give a comic support role.  His Kim Darling is 
a hilarious blend of silliness and incongruity, especially at the end when 
he meets a sublime fate.</P>
<P>Some of the more pleasurable moments of viewing involve the actual cartoon 
short "The Phox, the Box, and the Lox."  It's a fractured fairy tale, a lot 
like the olds ones narrated by the ivory-voiced Edward Everett Horton.  The 
tale of a wise-cracking, greedy fox and his quest for treasure, the story 
shows some of the same twisted moralizing as its 1960's precursors - except 
that the originals were more comically arch.</P>
<P>On the whole, it would be better to rent "Dudley Do-Right," except if no 
better offerings were available on the weekend for the kiddies.  The 
self-aware jokes - that trademark of Jay Ward's post-modern sense of humor - 
are present to a small degree, and the ending is much more promising than 
what leads to it.  Now, let's hope that Ward's main success, the ingenious 
'The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle," falls into the hands of a more 
wildly creative producer.</P>
