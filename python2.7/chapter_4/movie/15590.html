<P>     A couple of years ago, I began reading Scott Smith's novel A SIMPLE
PLAN and never made it to the halfway point.  There was nothing
particularly wrong with the plot -- a moody cautionary tale about the
resulting spiral of guilt and violence when three men find $4.4 million in
a wrecked plane -- nor did Smith's prose style offend in any way.  The
simple problem with A SIMPLE PLAN was the narrative structure, in which
Smith told the story as a first person account by one of the men.  It
seemed to me a terrible mistake, one made identification with one specific
character too explicit.  Intriguing though the premise may have been, I
couldn't get past hearing Hank Mitchell's voice while watching his story
unfold.</P>
<P>     Sam Raimi's screen version of A SIMPLE PLAN shows how easy it can be
to improve on a novel when point-of-view is its only real flaw.  Raimi
casts Bill Paxton as Hank, a hard-working family man in a snowy Minnesota
farm town.  One New Year's Eve, Hank -- along with his brother Jacob
(Billy Bob Thornton) and Jacob's drinking buddy Lou (Brent Briscoe) --
takes an unexpected detour into snowy woods, where they discover the
downed plane, a dead pilot and a bag full of $100 bills.  Suspecting the
money must be ill-gotten, Lou and Jacob are intent on keeping it, and
manage to talk Hank into a compromise whereby they'll sit on the money
until the plane is found in the spring.  If no one comes looking for the
money, no harm done, and three millionaires made.</P>
<P>     Only there is harm done.  Greed begins twisting the three men,
already divided into shifting factions -- educated Hank vs. unemployed
Jacob and Lou, the two Mitchell brothers vs. the outsider Lou -- into
ever-more-extreme methods of covering their tracks.  It also begins
twisting Hank's wife Sarah (Bridget Fonda), who eventually becomes the
most determined to keep the cash at any cost.  A SIMPLE PLAN offers an
object lesson in any number of cliched moral bon mots:  crime doesn't pay,
there certainly isn't any honor among thieves, and love of money is indeed
the root of all evil.  It's a tale of what we're made of at our core, and
how little it takes to strip away the civilization in a man like Hank and
turn him into a savage.</P>
<P>     That probably doesn't sound like the kind of material one usually
associates with Raimi (THE EVIL DEAD, DARKMAN), a director whose camera
often seems to need a dose of Ritalin.  He certainly tones down his
hyperkinetic visuals, but he loses none of his energy, which is why A
SIMPLE PLAN never feels like a simplistic morality play.  He merely 
harnesses that energy into scenes of superbly crafted tension, where the
moments before critical decisions linger with almost unbearable
anticipation.  Raimi allows you to feel the weight of every bad choice,
every life-threatening turning point.  He does it not by letting Hank
explain to you what he's doing, but by giving you a moment to consider
what you would do in his place.  It's a thriller as full of genuine dread
as anything a major studio has produced in recent years.</P>
<P>     It's also a thriller full of genuine pathos, thanks to a masterful
supporting performance by Billy Bob Thornton.  As the simple-minded Jacob,
a life-long loser who believes money might finally make him somebody, he
is the film's true moral compass.  As confused as he is physically
grotesque, he provides the sense of emotional consequence most plot-driven
thrillers lack.  The one drawback to Thornton's intense work is that he
makes his castmates look weak by comparison; Bridget Fonda's calculating
Sarah rings particularly false at times.  A SIMPLE PLAN overreaches its
grasp a bit during the final act when a sinister figure arrives to 
threaten the plan, but by then Raimi and Smith have gotten you so wrapped
up in what their characters will do next that you're willing to follow
wherever they lead.  Smith's first-person narrative in written form made
this a tale of one man's descent.  On the screen, A SIMPLE PLAN lets you
identify with every character and experience the chilly, chilling dark
night of several souls.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 greed expectations:  8.</PRE>
