<PRE>                               FRENCH TWIST
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>        FRENCH TWIST has a humorous premise and for most of the
film it carries out its promise to be funny.   If only directors
would know when to quit when they are ahead.</P>
<P>        The film is about a love triangle but this being a comedy as
well as being French, do not anticipate the usual triangle.</P>
<P>        Loli (Victoria Abril) is a pretty housewife who has a
husband, Laurent, (Alain Chabat) who deals in high-priced real
estate.   Loli understands that his job keeps him working late,
never suspecting that much of the time Laurent is cheating on her.
After a while she makes that discovery and she is, naturally, angry.
Little wonder that there has hardly been any sex of late.</P>
<P>        One day a woman, @Marijo (@Josiane @Balasko), a Lesbian, pulls
up in a truck and asks for some water as her car's water has leaked.
Marijo and Loli have a cup of coffee while Marijo listens to @Loli's
tale of woe.   Pretty soon she comes on to Loli who, in the mood she
is in, responds with hugs and kisses.  Marijo is invited to stay
and sleep on the couch but Laurent will have none of that.  He is
one jealous cheat.</P>
<P>        Unlike other triangle films, tables get turned in the most
odd and humorous way.   However, just when the film appears to have
concluded with a good finale, up comes on the screen, THREE MONTHS
LATER.   This leads to turning a light comedy into an unbelievable
farce, to say nothing of adding more minutes to the film than was
necessary.   Well, at least it was funny up until then.</P>
<PRE>                 In French with English subtitles.</PRE>
<P>      Written, playing Marijo, and Directed by Josiane Balasko</P>
