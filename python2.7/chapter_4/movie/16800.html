<P>After a preview screening of the new Harold Ramis film, Analyze This
(*** ½), I broke into a black, fully-loaded 1999 Lincoln Continental in
the theater's parking lot.  My friend at the DMV had previously traced
the plates to one Tony Boombatti (Fat Tony), the owner of the Boombatz
Pizzeria and the right arm of the even more well-known local
`waste-management specialist' Tony Matsorelli (Tony Two-Step).  I then
placed a transmitter under both sun visors in order to get their
reactions to the film.</P>
<PRE>(Doors unlock and open.  Laughter.)</PRE>
<P>Tony Matsorelli: Jesus, that was a great <bleep> movie.</P>
<P>Tony Boombatti: Great <bleep> movie.  Funny as <bleep>.</P>
<P>Tony M:  <Bleep> Tom Hanks.  Now, DeNiro can act.</P>
<P>Tony B:  Yeah.  <Bleep> Tom Hanks.  (Starts car.)</P>
<P>Tony M: His hand shakes a little bit and all of a sudden he's some great
actor?  C'mon.</P>
<P>Tony B: (Burps.)  Hey, you got a <bleep> toothpick?</P>
<P>Tony M: Yeah, I got your toothpick right here, you <bleep> <bleep>.</P>
<P>Tony B. Jesus, my balls <bleep> itch like a <bleep> mother <bleep>.</P>
<P>Tony M. What the <bleep>.  Do I look like your <bleep> mother?  I gotta
itch your <bleep> balls for you now?  Holy <bleep>.</P>
<P>Tony B. <Bleep> you.  I was just sayin'.</P>
<PRE>Tony M. <Bleep> your mother.</PRE>
<P>Tony B. You know, even that little <bleep> Crystal wasn't bad.</P>
<P>Tony M. <Bleep> money-lenders.  They should stay behind the scenes.</P>
<PRE>Tony B. <Bleep> A.</PRE>
<PRE>Tony M. <Bleep> A.</PRE>
<P>Tony B. He ain't no <bleep> Pesci, but he ain't too <bleep> bad, either.</P>
<P>Tony M. DeNiro and <bleep> Pesci should be in every <bleep> movie.</P>
<P>Tony B. Are you <bleep> crazy?  If DeNiro and <bleep> Pesci were in
every <bleep> movie together…holy <bleep>.  That would be <bleep> great.</P>
<PRE>Tony M. <Bleep> A.</PRE>
<PRE>Tony B. <Bleep> A.</PRE>
<P>Tony M. Hey, didn't Crystal sorta remind you of that lawyer…aww <bleep>,
what's his name?  Alan Berkowitz?</P>
<PRE>Tony B. (Burps again.)  Who?</PRE>
<P>Tony M. <Bleep> it.  I forget his <bleep> name.  The guy that got that
other guy off for whackin' his wife.</P>
<P>Tony B. That's a <bleep> great <bleep> lawyer.</P>
<PRE>Tony M. And that pock-marked guy – who knew he could be so <bleep>
funny?</PRE>
<PRE>Tony B. What <bleep> guy?</PRE>
<P>Tony M. That fat <bleep> guy with the bad skin that's always in the
Mafia movies.  Kinda looks like you, you fat <bleep>.</P>
<PRE>Tony B. The fat guy?</PRE>
<P>Tony M. Jesus <bleep> Christ.  You got <bleep> marinara in your <bleep>
ears?</P>
<P>Tony B.  No, Tony.  I just don't know who you're <bleep> talking about.</P>
<PRE>Tony M. <Bleep> it.</PRE>
<P>Tony B. You believe that a hard <bleep> like DeNiro would really need to
go to a shrink?</P>
<P>Tony M. <Bleep> no.  It's just a <bleep> movie.  The whole premise was
that he was nervous about the big meeting of the heads of all the
<bleep> Families in the whole <bleep> country.</P>
<PRE>Tony B. Yeah?</PRE>
<P>Tony M. Everybody knows that we don't <bleep> meet like that.  If we
need to have a sit-down, we use <bleep> video conferencing on the
<bleep> Internet.  We're Sicilian, but we ain't stupid.</P>
<PRE>Tony B. <Bleep> A, Tony.</PRE>
<P>Tony M. <Bleep> Hollywood thinks that we would be stupid enough to meet
in a big <bleep> warehouse with no security.</P>
<P>Tony B. Bunch of <bleep> parasites.  You think it was too much like The
Sopranos?</P>
<P>Tony M. <bleep> no.  The Sopranos don't got DeNiro.  It was sorta the
same, but different, too.</P>
<PRE>Tony B. But both <bleep> great.</PRE>
<P>Tony M. <Bleep> A.  And I gotta hand it to ‘em – that Godfather dream
sequence, where <bleep> Crystal gets whacked like Brando, was <bleep>
hysterical.</P>
<P>Tony B. That was from The Godfather?  No <bleep>.</P>
<P>Tony M. Yeah; no <bleep>, you <bleep> <bleep>.  And that part where
Crystal turns fed and wears a <bleep> wire to the sit-down with DeNiro,
but thinks better of it and tears the wire off in the <bleep> crapper?
<bleep> brilliant.</P>
<P>Tony B. <Bleep> me.  I think I missed that part when I went to the lobby
to get more <bleep> butter on my <bleep> popcorn.</P>
<P>Tony M. You wanna get something to eat?</P>
<PRE>Tony B. Yeah, I'm <bleep> starvin'</PRE>
<P>Tony M. Now, there's a <bleep> shocker.  Fat Tony hungry.  Stop the
<bleep> presses.</P>
<P>Tony B. <Bleep> you.  I got a slow metabolism.</P>
<P>Tony M. That ain't the only thing that's slow on you, you fat <bleep>
mother <bleep>.</P>
<P>Tony B. (Shouting.)  Hey!  (Tires squeal, horns blow.)  Stay the <bleep>
out of my <bleep> lane, you piece of <bleep> <bleep>!</P>
<P>Tony M. <Bleep> this.  (Click, click.)  <Bleep> this guy.</P>
<P>Tony B. (Revving engine.)  <Bleep> mother <bleep>.  (Whir of power
windows.)</P>
<P>Tony M. (Shouting.)  <Bleep> you, you mother <bleep> son of a <bleep>.
(Repeated gunfire, more squealing tires.)</P>
<P>Tony B. Ooh, I'm <bleep> hit.  They <bleep> got me, Tony.  (Loud crash
and silence.)</P>
