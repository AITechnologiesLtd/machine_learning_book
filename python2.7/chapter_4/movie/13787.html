<P>Plot: Elwood Blues is released from jail only to find his brother Jake 
has died in incarceration. Forming a new band along with a bartender, a 
juvenile delinquent, and a police chief whose personality is 
miraculously transformed, he sets out to reunite the remaining members 
of the backup band and play a new gig, a journey which turns into a 
massive cross-country chase as they are pursued by police, Russian mafia 
and right-wing militia groups.</P>
<P>The original `The Blues Brothers' (1980), although disliked by most 
critics at the time of its release, became a cult classic. Borderline 
fantasy at most, its enduring appeal lay somewhere between a great blues 
soundtrack, its anarchically surreal parody of a car chase movie and the 
laconically cool duo of Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi. This sequel, made 
fifteen years on, reunites one half of the title duo, Aykroyd, and 
original director John Landis, who has really failed to make anything 
that has the freshness of `The Blues Brothers' in the time in between. 
And despite replacement by three other characters, the absence of 
Belushi, who of course died of a heroin overdose in an LA motel room in 
1982, hangs over the whole reunion exercise and leaves it with a kind of 
odour of bad judgement. Indeed not unlike the various reunion concerts 
performed in recent years by bands like Kiss, The Eagles and The Sex 
Pistols, the reunion smacks of a cynicism - of former creative forces 
sunken into a flabby and not too becoming middle-age whose get-together 
has been motivated less by a desire to explore new creative directions 
than it has of a desire to milk fans' nostalgia for more money.</P>
<P>And sadly `Blues Brothers 2000' is all of these things. It lacks any 
original ideas. The plot simply rehashes that of the first film - Blues 
Brothers(s) get out of jail and sets about reuniting the band, a quest 
which, as the film progresses, escalates into a surreally overblown 
chase with the police and various terrorist groups. The plot just 
flabbily plods from one incident to the next without, it seems, really 
anything except the musical numbers to hold it together. Indeed the end 
seems to peter out of plot altogether and just anti-climactically ends 
by trying to get as many famous blues legends as possible on stage for a 
massive jam session. This one even lacks the original's deadpan 
anarchism - there's one sequence with about fifty cop cars all piling 
into one another which goes on for about five minutes in a deadeningly 
excessive way and seems merely overblown. This film is a good deal more 
fantastic than its predecessor - miraculous personality changes in the 
midst of a gospel number; the Blues Brothers transformed into 
green-skinned zombies for a calypso number by a voodoo priestess; an 
appearance of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse above the stage during 
one performance. Why, one might ask. One might indeed ask but to do so 
might serve as much purpose as asking what the `2000' in the title 
refers to. And the only real answer appears to be the same sense of 
haphazardness with which the rest of the film appears to have been slung 
together.</P>
