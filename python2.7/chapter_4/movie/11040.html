<PRE>SPHERE </PRE>
<P>The thing to fear about SPHERE is not fear itself. Or to put it
differently, if it is fear that you fear, never fear; SPHERE will not
interfere.</P>
<P>Ouch. Not for the puns; for the movie. I can round up the review with one
word: weak. Take a B plot, inflate it  with a big budget, surround it with
three of Hollywood's brightest stars  and what have you done? You have come
full circle, back to B. There's no getting around it, this sphere is on a
downhill roll. What we are trying to say in a roundabout way is that both
Crichton and Levinson dropped the ball. (Michael Crichton wrote the book
and Barry Levinson directed.) This is a sphere that won't get a Golden
Globe. A lead balloon…maybe.</P>
<P>It is difficult to say what is wrong with this movie without going deep
into the plot. And deep is where the plot takes you, into the ocean. It
also tries to take you deep into the mysteries of the mind, but alas, the
mind is an empty sphere. It seems that an American space mission from far
into the future had retrieved a spherical object from outer space, and
traveling in time missed its target and landed 300 years behind our
present, crashing to the bottom of the sea. That spoils some minor
surprises but will give you a helpful handle on the proceedings. Watching
this movie I learned the difference between puzzlement and suspense. I was
bewildered by the strange goings on, so much so that I could hardly yawn.
(I also caught a wink or so, but that is not necessarily a reflection on
the movie. I've been known to do that in some of the best.)</P>
<P>On the positive side, Dustin Hoffman's mature professionalism is always a
pleasure to watch and Sharon Stone delivers a meticulously crafted
performance. The scene of her emotional confrontation with Hoffman is
outstanding. Hoffman fights hard for this scene, but he loses by a nose.
Samuel L. Jackson was so bored with the whole affair that he slept through
most of the action. When he was not really asleep, he was sleep-walking.
What a waste.</P>
<P>SPHERE is not a terrible movie, it is OK. If it were offered as a B movie
we would forgive, enjoy  and forget. But given the budget, the cast, the
promotion and the promise, forgiving is impossible, enjoying is
questionable and forgetting is inevitable. For better entertainment than
SPHERE you may want to turn an ear to the President's affairs or Monica
Welinski's coiffure; or go out and have a beer. Double ouch. 2 ¼ stars out
of 5.
