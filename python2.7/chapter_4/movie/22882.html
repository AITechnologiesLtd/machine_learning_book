Reviewed by Frankie Paiva</P>
<P>There are only a selected handful of films that manage to be funny, yet be
extremely sad at the exact same moment in time. All About My Mother is one of
those films. The movie, which is filled with beautiful scenery and gorgeous
settings, has this ability to affect you by printing haunting images onto your
brain, and making sure they stay there.</P>
<P>Manuela (Roth) takes her son Esteban (Azorin) to a touring production of "A
Streetcar Named Desire" for his birthday. He is delighted by the show and
decides to wait outside in the rain to ask one of the lead actresses for her
autograph. He is determined to get it, and he runs after her when she speeds
away in a taxi. At an intersection, he is run over by a car and killed. He
died, never knowing who his father really was, and Manuela was going to tell
him all about his dad that night as his birthday present. </P>
<P>The grief stricken Manuela decides to go back to Barcelona to meet up with
his father, but there is a catch. Not only does the dad not know he has a son,
he also happens to be a transsexual who know goes by the name of Lola, and is
contributing to the spread of AIDS across the city. She rents an apartment, and
while in town, takes in a pregnant nun with a foreboding mother and helps her
through her pregnancy. She also meets up with her friend Agrado (Antonia San
Juan), who I believe was supposed to be a woman playing a woman but in this
movie it's kind of hard to be sure. These three women soon begin a rapidly
growing bond of friendship, a bond that is later shared with the lead actress
from Streetcar, who is currently in town for the show. Each of these four women
have problems, and each one of them will have help to deal with them.</P>
<P>It's hard to think of where to begin with this film. For starters, the
cinematography and camera work is superb. The use of color is remarkable and
adds life to and electricity that seeps throughout the entire picture. But not
everything is vibrant and rosy. The film also has some chilling moments, and a
particular scene involving Manuela circling a field full of hookers offering
themselves to, and being raped by men is (in my opinion) the most haunting and
depressing scene of any film this year. The film's main theme is death and
disease, and the pain caused by both, but much of the abundant humor
overshadows the dark undertones. There is an amazing monologue that Agrado
delivers about her life late in the film, that is so funny and hilarious, you
can download it on the AAMM website. </P>
<P>There are many great performances in the film, Cecilia Roth shines as the
vulnerable, but strong heroine of the movie and San Juan is just beyond belief
as
Agrado. But the real star of the film is director Pedro Almodovar, everything
in the film looks amazing and all of the scenes are well thought out. This may
finally be his chance to be noticed by the mainstream audience, as the film is
likely to pick up this year's Best Foreign Film Oscar. An overall good film,
almost all of the testosterone in the audience will be lost, but it will still
be enjoyable for both genders. If you are looking for a great movie to see,
find the theater near you playing All About My Mother.</P>
<P>Overall Grade: B+                        Rated R for for sexuality including
strong sexual dialogue, language, and some drug content
The Young-Uns: While the film would be OK for older teens, they will probably
be bored. Good Age: 15 and up</P>
