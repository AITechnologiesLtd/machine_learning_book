<PRE>URBAN LEGEND (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Edited by Cher Johnson
Copyright 1998 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>Have you ever heard the story about the group of teens being chased by a
masked man? You know the story, where there's a hip theme and some
good-looking actors. Thinking of Scream? Wrong. Maybe it's Scream 2? Wrong.
OK, it's gotta be I Know What You Did Last Summer! Wrong! It's Urban
Legend. Urban Legend is the next hip-slasher film to come down the pipe
after the revival of the slasher-film genre by Scream.</P>
<P>In my review of I Know What You Did Last Summer I listed the common
elements of the '90s hip-slasher films. Here's a quick rundown 1) The
killer has to wear some sort of a mask -- this time around the killer is
dressed as an Eskimo. 2) There needs to be ditsy female leads with ample
cleavage. 3) There needs to be a cast of one-dimensional characters that
serve as slasher fodder. I'm adding one more to this list: 4) There needs
to be a point in the film where the undead dead killer returns for a final
round. I'm happy to say that Urban Legend dutifully fills all these
requirements.</P>
<P>On the campus of a quiet Maine university, a student, Natalie (Alicia
Witt), is being harassed by a killer who is dressed like an Eskimo and
likes to kill people by methods based on urban legends. Urban legends are
modern folktales that may be true or may just be a hoax. We all know one or
two urban legends, and a few are covered in the movie. During the movie we
get The Ax Murderer in the Backseat, Pop Rocks & Pepsi, The Hung Lover,
Woman Who Dried Her Dog in the Microwave, and a few more.</P>
<P>Sounds like a good premise. It reminds me of another movie, CopyCat, that
used a similar premise. In CopyCat, the killer modeled his killings on
previous serial killers. The difference between CopyCat and Urban Legend is
that CopyCat is a good movie with good scares. Urban Legend is not.</P>
<P>The thrills in Urban Legend come in the form known as Cheap Scares. Cheap
Scares are the type of scares in which a person's head fills the screen,
they are walking forward, and then WHAM! someone touches their shoulder.
The WHAM! is punctuated with a burst from the musical score. It's not a
scare that's built up, it's just something that startles us. Urban Legend
does this repeatedly -- four or five times in the first half-hour. If I
wanted this kind of scare, I'd have a monkey follow me around with a gong.</P>
<P>Some moments in the film are horrific though. I loved the opening (The Ax
Murderer in the Backseat), which is slowly built up. Tension is never too
high in Urban Legend.</P>
<P>Two actors in Urban Legend are serviceable Alicia Witt ("Cybill") and Jared
Leto (Switchback, Prefontaine). Witt does a good job onscreen, though she
doesn't have the scream of a "scream queen." Leto doesn't get too much
screen time, but he does OK.</P>
<P>One actress sticks out like a sore thumb. I'm not sure what Rebecca
Gayheart was aiming for, but she overshoots it by a mile. Gayheart just
plainly overacts in Urban Legend.</P>
<P>Writer Silvio Horta actually gets the movie off to a good start. The first
half of the movie -- Cheap Scares and all -- works well. However, as we
slide into the halfway mark of the film, things go downhill. Red herrings
and cliches are thrown at us like doggie-treats. And as the body count
rises in the film, the thrill of this thriller proportionally drops. After
awhile I just wanted the Eskimo to wipe out the whole school and be over
with it.</P>
<P>Would I recommend Urban Legend? No. Rent Scream or Scream 2 for some good
thrills. Urban Legend is just a bad knock-off of Scream.</P>
<P>Hey monkey, hit that gong! <BONG!> Scared?</P>
