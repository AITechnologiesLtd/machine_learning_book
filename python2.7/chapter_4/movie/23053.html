<P>If you've seen the trailer for The Beach, you may think that you have a
pretty good idea what the film is about.  Pretty American boy and pretty
French girl find a secluded desert island paradise, then roll around in
the sand and screw their brains out until some really mean guys find the
island and everything gets really scary.  That's what I got out of it,
anyway.</P>
<P>To call the trailer `misleading' would be a bit of an understatement.
Sure, there is still a secluded desert island paradise, and the boy and
girl are still pretty, but everything else happens quite differently.
Does it matter?  Hell, no.  This is, more than anything, a Leonardo
DiCaprio film.  The fact that he is shirtless for the majority of the
film is enough to guarantee that teenage girls throughout the country
will pry their eyes away from Total Request Live long enough to beg
their parents to get them into this R-rated film.</P>
<P>DiCaprio (Titanic) plays Richard, an American vacationing in Bangkok
that decides he's tired of doing the same thing as the other tourists in
Thailand.  Dude, when was the last time an American went to Thailand and
didn't have a harrowing experience?  The only person that ever had a
successful cinematic voyage to this southeast Asian country is Anna
Leonowens.  And she had to sing and hang around a gaggle of kids.  Just
go to the tourist traps, get VD, go home and get a shot.  Or better yet,
vacation only within your own country where, unless your last name
happens to be Griswold, everything is safer.</P>
<P>The Beach begins with a very Se7en-ish opening shot (cinematographer
Darius Khondji also worked on that film) showing Richard arriving in
Bangkok.  Although the city is referred to as `Good Time City,' Richard
explains (through a sometimes annoying voice-over) that he is easily
bored with the scene, which basically consists of spoiled kids looking
for a fresh location to toke up and the natives that try to take
advantage of their fat wallets and perpetual high.</P>
<P>In his one-star hotel, Richard meets the people staying on either side
of him.  There's Étienne (Guillaume Canet, In All Innocence) and
Françoise (Virginie Ledoyen, A Single Girl), the sex-crazed French
couple.  And then there's Daffy (Robert Carlyle, Angela's Ashes), a
deranged Scotsman that tells Richard about a secluded desert island
paradise of crystal-clear water, pure white sand, waterfalls and
never-ending fields of pot, just before offing himself because he can't
get the place out of his head.  There's Sign #2 – don't go to the
island, Richard.</P>
<P>Of course, Richard goes to the island with Étienne and Françoise, thanks
to a map that Daffy left for him before he did himself in.  It takes a
while to get there, but when they do, the trio find the island every bit
as beautiful as they imagined, but it's also inhabited by a flock of
gun-toting Thai pot farmers, as well as a commune of hippies on
permanent vacation.  They are welcomed by the members of the beach
community, yet despite the perfect surroundings, Richard still seems
sullen, just because he wants to nail Françoise.</P>
<P>Before you know it, you're over an hour into the film and no clear
protagonist has been established.  Is it the shark that tries to gnaw on
unsuspecting swimmers?  Nope.  Is it the shifty-eyed boyfriend of the
group's leader?  Nope.  It's more of a destruction-from-within/Lord of
the Flies deal.  And that's not the only theme borrowed from other
works.  The Beach is chock full of references to American films about
the Vietnam War, Nintendo games and Looney Tunes characters.  It would
have been easy to imagine Richard turning into Marlon Brando in
Apocalypse Now, even without using clips from that film here.</P>
<P>The Beach is based on Alex Garland's wildly popular novel of the same
name – it's been called the first great book for the Generation X crowd
– and was made by the folks that brought you the wonderful Ewan McGregor
trifecta of Shallow Grave, Trainspotting and A Life Less Ordinary
(director Danny Boyle, screenwriter John Hodge and producer Andrew
Macdonald).  Those of you that read the book might be wondering, among
other things, why Ewan wasn't cast as Richard in the film, since the
character was a Brit in the novel.  Beats me; I'm wondering the same
thing.</P>
<P>>From what I understand, the novel offered a gruesome bloodbath for its
ending, but the closing reel of the film is a bit anti-climatic and
leaves a lot of issues unresolved.  Go figure – when was the last time a
movie didn't do the book justice?  In the filmmakers' defense, they did
not exploit the relationship between Richard and Françoise.  Though they
never `hooked up' in the book, Hodge's script offers a surprisingly
refreshing lack of romance between the nubile youngsters.</P>
<P>DiCaprio is solid as usual, Ledoyen does her job by looking fantastic in
a bikini, and Carlyle does the crazy thing as well as anyone in film
today.  If nothing else, The Beach looks and sounds fantastic.  Khondji
(Evita) and scoremeister Angelo Badalementi (The Straight Story) are
more responsible for effectively setting the tone of the film than the
script or acting.  Filmed on the Thai island Phi Phi Leh, The Beach
might be gorgeous enough to overcome any problems that you may have with
the script.</P>
<P>1:58- R for violence, nudity, strong sexual content, adult language and
drug use</P>
