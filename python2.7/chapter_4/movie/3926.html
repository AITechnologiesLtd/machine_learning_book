<P>     BUSHWHACKED wins the "best trailer for a bad movie" award of 1995.  
With its clever sendup of Sylvester Stallone's CLIFFHANGER, the 
theatrical preview promises a far more clever and innovative picture 
than it delivers.  As was true of last year's winner, THE NAKED GUN 33 
1/3, this is an occasion when it's far better to see the trailer and 
skip the actual film.  Once the opening credits start rolling, it's all 
downhill. </P>
<P>     BUSHWHACKED is the story of Max Grabelski (Daniel Stern), an 
overnight delivery courier who inadvertently becomes mixed up in theft 
and murder.  With the police hot on his trail, Max heads for a nearby 
forest where, through a series of implausible coincidences, he ends up 
masquerading as a wilderness survival guide for a group of six young 
"ranger scouts" on a camping expedition.  Of course, Max is unable to 
dump his charges and, as the story progresses, his well-hidden heart of 
gold emerges. </P>
<P>     On the whole, BUSHWHACKED is the kind of film I like to describe as 
"offensively inoffensive."  That is to say, it tries so hard to be 
heartwarming and likable that it ends up making the average viewer want 
to retch.  Dramatically, the movie has all the substance of vapor.  But 
it's really supposed to be a comedy, right?  Who cares if the characters 
act corny as long as there are some laughs to be had?  Unfortunately, 
BUSHWHACKED doesn't deliver there, either.  This is easily one of the 
least funny movies of the year.  If I chuckled once, it was a lot.  The 
jokes are inane and juvenile, with a sad predictability that leeches any 
potential humor out of each and every one of them.   </P>
<P>     In HOME ALONE and CITY SLICKERS, Daniel Stern showed some comic 
potential, but if BUSHWHACKED is an indication of the direction in which 
his career is moving, he's on his way down a dead-end alley.  Using a 
somewhat less pathological version of his HOME ALONE personality, Stern 
is suitably manic, but not especially appealing.  There's an awkwardness 
about the character that distances him from the audience, and his 
budding relationship with the six children is never convincing. </P>
<P>     There's one curious paradox about BUSHWHACKED.  The film was 
apparently written for (and, judging by script quality, quite possibly 
by) children under the age of ten.  However, given the PG-13 rating (for 
profanity and sexual innuendo), many parents are likely to reign in 
their younger offspring.  The result is a motion picture without an 
audience.  And, since no viewers equates to no money, this movie is 
likely to have a mercifully short theatrical run.  For that, at least, 
we can be thankful to the MPAA. </P>
