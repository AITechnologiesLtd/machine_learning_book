<P>     ALL THE BOYS AND GIRLS IN THEIR TIME is a series of films 
commissioned by the French-German TV station Arte.  Ten directors were 
asked to participate by making a movie about their teenage years.  Each 
film had to include at least one party scene which highlighted the music 
of the time.  PORTRAIT OF A YOUNG GIRL AT THE END OF THE 1960S IN 
BRUSSELS, Chantal Akerman's entry, takes place in April of 1968 and, as 
the title states, occurs on the streets of Brussels.  Aside from a few 
supporting figures, there are really only two characters:  Michelle, a 
thoughtful teenage loner who has given up school, and Paul, a guy she 
meets in a movie theater. </P>
<P>     Like Richard Linklater's BEFORE SUNRISE, this movie is about two 
people walking around a European city, getting to know one another.  
Some of the subjects of conversation here even match those of 
Linklater's picture.  However, while SUNRISE is a love story, PORTRAIT 
is something less romantic.  It's about two people learning the other's 
secrets, but never really connecting.  Michelle is a lonely, morose 
person who, by her own admission, hates having fun.  "Even when I'm 
happy," she says, "I'm in pain, but I never show it."  Paul, on the 
other hand, is eager to soothe her, but it's rare that she lets him 
within arm's distance. </P>
<P>     Akerman, known for extremely slow-moving character dramas, speeds 
up the pace a little here, although this film certainly doesn't fly by.  
Nevertheless, during the one-hour running time, we get to know both 
Michelle and Paul, and are given an opportunity to ponder the subjects 
that arise during their rambling discussions.  Michelle is an especially 
fascinating person, and perhaps the most refreshing aspect of PORTRAIT 
is that it allows us to spend time with her without foisting distracting 
plot complications upon us.  Akerman has painted just what the title 
suggests -- a portrait for all who enjoy a slow-paced, leisurely look at 
a select character and her circumstances. </P>
