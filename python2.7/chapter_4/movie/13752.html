<P>   Brian De Palma's new political thriller, "Snake Eyes," has
just the sort of plot the ancient Greek tragedians would have
loved.  Its hero, played by Nicolas Cage, is a deeply flawed
character who, you would expect to meet his comeuppance at
the very moment that he is exalted.  His antagonist, whose
identity will not be revealed here, is a man who does evil but
who does it not for selfish motives but to save the lives (or so
he thinks) of the people he works with.  Closer to home,
"Snake Eyes" is just the sort of movie that could revive talk
about Who Killed Kennedy, as it highlights a conspiracy to kill
a high-level government official that leads the conspirators to
erase all traces of evidence--including the accessories to the
crime.</P>
<P>   Brian De Palma, whose direction is anything but subtle,
shoves his camera everywhere and anywhere, obliterating
walls as though they were made of gossamer to zoom from
hotel lobby to elaborate bed chambers.  He encircles the
boxing arena in an Atlantic City casino as though his camera
were on the wings of an eagle.  Reproached by film critic
David Thomson as "the epitome of mindless style and
excitement swamping taste or character," he nonetheless
gives an audience eager to be electrified for an hour and a
half a steady dose of adrenalin, having portrayed startling
characters in films like "Carrie," "The Fury," "Body Double,"
and one of the great past potentates of mayhem and
bloodletting, "Scarface."</P>
<P>   His special technique this time around is to view a murder
and its investigation virtually in real time.  He begins by
introducing an off-the-wall detective, Nick Santoro (Nicolas
Cage), who establishes his character early on by shaking
down a drug pusher, placing a $5,000 bet on a fight, and
strutting about a boxing arena like a drunken sophomore at
an untamed fraternity party.  You'd think that a cop on the
take would play low profile but in the one major directorial
error, De Palma goes overboard in confusing Detective
Santoro with Castor Troy or Cameron Poe.  De Palma makes
good on the tension once the assassination plot takes hold
and maintains the tautness throughout, effortlessly making up
for this strange introductory gaffe.</P>
<P>   The setting is a casino in Atlantic City on a stormy evening. 
Lincoln Tyler (Stan Shaw), heavyweight champ, is defending
his title as a 10-1 favorite.  When he apparently takes a dive,
a shot rings out: the Secretary of Defense is hit in the throat,
as his chief bodyguard, Commander Kevin Dunne (Gary
Sinise) plunges into the investigation together with his best
friend, Santoro.  Just prior to the shooting, a 26-year-old
woman, Julie Costello (Carla Gugino), had slipped the
secretary an envelope containing a document questioning the
reliability of a new weapons system.  Spattered with blood,
she tries to disappear into the adjacent casino and is pursued
by those who need to silence her.</P>
<P>   During the course of the story we learn much about casino
security, particularly about the 1500 surveillance cameras
which can hone in on individuals suspected of "counting" or
engaging in other activities detrimental to the profits of the
casino.  The computerized TV surveillance can even survey
the halls of the massive hotel, quickly identifying guests by
picture and room numbers.  The principal technique used by
De Palma is a Rashomon-like series of flashbacks to the
shooting from different angles and distinct points of view,
each time teasing the audience with another piece of the
puzzle.</P>
<P>   David Koepp's screenplay is a complex one which takes
time to sort out as he throws quite a few particulars into the
story.  We see the action from Santoro's point of view, that of
a cop with ambitions to be the mayor of Atlantic City but with
no higher goals than to be chief in a town he calls his sewer. 
We observe a boxer who is confronted with evidence of a
fixed fight, and note that boxing is nothing if not a business. 
(The defeated heavyweight champ is attended by a lawyer.)
We inspect the self-serving of various people in the media
and government, not surprised that one TV reporter, Lou
Logan (Kevin Dunn), offers Santoro $5,000 for exclusive
rights to interview some of the 14,000 witnesses to the
shooting.  We observe the escalating fear and panic in
the eyes of Julie Costello, a young woman who is so
nearsighted that without her glasses all is a blur but who is
otherwise the most farsighted character in the movie.  </P>
<P>   "Snake Eyes," which represents the single circle on the
face of a pair of dice, is so named because "the house
always wins."  The picture is itself a winner in most respects,
flawed only by an overly rambunctious characterization by
Nicolas Cage.  De Palma has successfully ventured back to
his Hitchcock phase, which he borrowed while at the helm of
"Sisters" in 1973, but still employs a style all his own with his
bold and dazzling visual flair.</P>
