<P>The Silence Of The Lambs
Chad'z rating: **** (out of 4 = excellent)
1991, R, 118 minutes [1 hour, 58 minutes]
[mystery/thriller]
Starring: Jodie Foster (Clarice Starling), Anthony Hopkins (Dr. Hannibal
Lector), Scott Glenn (Jack Crawford), written by Ted Tally, produced by
Edward Saxon, Kenneth Utt, Ron Bozman, directed by Jonathan Demme, based on
the novel by Thomas Harris.</P>
<P>There have been a lot of mystery movies over the years, but none so grim and
calculated as "The Silence Of The Lambs." This is one of the most suspenseful
films I've ever seen, as we are placed into the investigators' shoes and try
to put the pieces together. The film also adds a strange, but powerful
element of taking us inside the mind of one psychopath to study another. The
fact such difficult storytelling devices are used as well as they are here is
a sign of genius.</P>
<P>Jodie Foster stars as Clarice Starling, a potential FBI agent who is about
to complete her training. Because of her impressive records she is called in
to help out on the case of serial killer known as "Buffalo Bill." Her
superior, Jack Crawford (Glenn), informs her of the facts surrounding the
case, and right from the get-go it seems like a scary and dangerous project.
But the film does not have a straight "thriller" mood to it, its hook is its
off-camera graphicness. Just hearing what Buffalo Bill has done establishes
everything. Not only does this create a great desire for justice, but it also
makes for a subtle Gothic mood.</P>
<P>Starling is sent to interview the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lector (Hopkins), a
psychiatrist who has a fetish for cannibalism. The way Hopkins portrays him
is very frightening because it is so believable. The atmosphere itself adds
to the drama, as we are just as afraid of him as Clarice is. Lector analyzes
the case and sends Clarice away with hints and clues. He is purposely making
her do more work than she has to do just to experiment with her mind.</P>
<P>Most of the film involves detailed detective work by Starling and the FBI.
We do meet the killer, but he does not become a vital character because he
isn't nearly as cunning or vile as Lector. It's interesting to watch Starling
track down clues and sources, and most of those on slim leads and hunches. </P>
<P>Starling thinks Lector knows who Buffalo Bill is, but in order to get him to
talk she must tell him about her own life. Lector gets inside her mind by
analyzing all the details of her life. If anything, the film works as a great
character study and terrific interaction between these two actors and their
characters.</P>
<P>Although the film had been a great drama and mystery, the actual ending tops
it off and and defines the genre of "thriller." Of course justice is
ultimately served in the end, but perhaps something even worse than Buffalo
Bill happens...</P>
<P>"The Silence Of The Lambs" works so well because of its mood factor alone.
Films that can be this emotional, disturbing, and exciting by using typical
mainstream mystery elements don't come along everyday. </P>
