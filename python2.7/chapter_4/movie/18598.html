Susan Granger's review of "INSTINCT" (Touchstone Pictures)</PRE>
<P>Violence has become a negative catch-word recently, so it's
refreshing to see how the concept is explored in this psychological
thriller, based on Daniel Quinn's book "Ismael." Anthony Hopkins plays
a highly respected primatologist who has been jailed for killing two
Rwandan rangers and injuring others after choosing to live in the wild
with mountain gorillas for nearly two years. Held captive in an
overcrowded maximum security prison for the criminally insane, he is
interrogated by a bright, ambitious psychiatrist, Cuba Gooding Jr.,
who is eager to understand the mysterious truth behind the scientist's
actions in anticipation of writing a best-seller. While simplistic,
Gerald DiPego's script is intelligent and thoughtful, delving into the
concepts of illusion and freedom, combined with the lust for
domination and control, ultimately dividing people into "givers" and
"takers." Director Jon Turtletaub ("Phenomenon") integrates the brutal
reality of prison life with memories of what transpired in Africa to
motivate Hopkins' violent behavior. The challenging, combative
chemistry between Anthony Hopkins and Cuba Gooding Jr. is palpable,
escalating the tension level, which is already elevated by the hostile
sadism of the prison's guards and warden. But a subplot involving
Maura Tierney as Hopkins' daughter never jells, and the conclusion is
cloyingly melodramatic. Arguably the most versatile and talented actor
on the screen today, Anthony Hopkins evokes a volatile power and fury
reminiscent of Hannibal Lechter in "The Silence of the Lambs," while
Cuba Gooding Jr. displays a forceful, bruising intensity. And
special-effects wizard Stan Winston works wonders with the
gorillas. On the Granger Movie Gauge, "Instinct" is a compelling 7,
commanding attention from start to finish.</P>
