<PRE>The Castle (R) ** 1/2
Starring Michael Caton, Stephen Curry
Directed by Rob Stich
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Are you a fan of those little English comedies that are filled with good humor,
charming characters, and interesting plotlines? Well this movie has it all for
you...the sweet, innocent Kerrigan family who resides next to the local airport
is being evicted. The airport wants to expand, but dad Darryl (Caton) isn't
willing to give up without a fight.</P>
<P>He hires Dennis Denuto (Tiriel Mora, one of those people with a familiar face
that you swear you've seen before) a sort of divorce lawyer to handle the case
for him and bring it to court. Dennis is not exactly the world's best lawyer
and loses the case when the judge asks him what his legal documents behind his
accusations are, he replies The Constitution, all of it. </P>
<P>The film is filled with all kinds of these sweet characters, loving, naive
people who react and take action without influence from the outside world.
While I will admit the film is funny (certainly not like or as much as Waking
Ned Devine which recently was released on video) and the running time is short,
(so as the Kerrigan's quirkiness does not lose it's appeal) I can't really
figure out how much I liked this film, but it made me feel good walking out of
the theater, and for that I give it ** 1/2 stars.</P>
