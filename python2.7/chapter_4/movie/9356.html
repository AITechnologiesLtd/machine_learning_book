<P>Tibet is where James Hilton set his famous, utopian novel "Lost Horizon"
(1933), later a most popular film  (1937) by Frank Capra. A plane carrying
a small group (motley, of course) of westerners crashes in the Himalayas.
The survivors end up in Shangri-La, a paradise in a hidden valley where
calm and wisdom reign, and some people just never age. The term Shangri-La
has entered most languages. Franklin Roosevelt established the presidential
retreat called Shangri-La in 1942. It became Camp David in 1953.</P>
<P>"Seven Years in Tibet" is based on the autobiographical 1953 best-seller by
Heinrich Harrer. The ghost of Shangri-La hovers over much of  the movie,
although this is no fantasy. The most visible symptom is that protagonist
Harrer, who spends 12 years in the region (seven of them in Tibet proper),
doesn't seem to age at all.</P>
<P>Brad Pitt plays Harrer, an Austrian champion alpinist. In the Fall of 1939
he is at the Vienna train station, leaving for the Himalayas, hoping to be
the first to climb Nanga Parbat, one of the highest peaks (26,660 feet ;
Everest rises to 29, 028).  By that time Austria had been annexed by
Hitler's Third Reich, to the great joy of far too many Austrians. This was
the notorious "Anschluss" (Union) that had been preceded in 1934 by
Austrian Nazis murdering the Chancellor, Engelbert Dollfuss.</P>
<P>The Nazis give Harrer a send-off with honors, complete with Nazi flag.
Harrer seems indifferent to the fuss --if not impatient. His marriage is
rocky as his pregnant wife feels abandoned. Heinrich also reacts dourly to
fellow Austrian guide Peter Aufschnaiter (David Thewlis) who may have been
appointed by the regime (but this, like other details, is unclear).</P>
<P>Next comes some spectacular climbing. The two Austrians do not get along
because Heinrich takes too many foolhardy (read also "ego-boosting")
chances and is arrogant. Soon however, in September 1939, Germany and
England are at war. The British intern the climbers in a POW camp.</P>
<P>Over the years, lone wolf Heinrich tries to escape four times. After
joining a group attempt he immediately leaves his companions to make his
way to northern India. Getting very close to Tibet, he runs into Peter. The
Wandering Aryans, ever bickering and antagonistic, trek for about two
years-- the time-frame is imprecise. The twosome are prevented by Tibetans
from entering the country but after more adventures they manage to sneak
into the holy city of Lhasa where they are exempted from the
"no-foreigners" rule.</P>
<P>All this has interest, suspense, unforced colorfulness and spectacular
landscapes. But time and space are so episodic that what we see feels like
excerpts from a 4-hour movie. We're left with many other questions too.
Among them: how did the men survive their horrible hardships in the
mountainous wilderness?  why hadn't their scavenger-type diet not given
them scurvy or vermin given them diseases?  how is it that when they reach
Lhasa, after their first baths and shaves in years, they can look so fresh,
hale and hearty?</P>
<P>The companions find an entirely new mode of life in Tibet, gradually blend
in as much as outsiders could. There is even a flirtation with a handsome
lady-tailor, whom Peter later marries. While the Austrians fit in, the
movie is careful not to indulge in travelogue picturesqueness or get
carried away by the spirituality of the Tibetan religion. Yet the people,
their ways of thinking and their beliefs certainly affect the Austrians.</P>
<P>A major influence on Heinrich will come later from his relationship with
the Dalai Lama, who is first shown as a child, then in various stages of
growth.  When the boy is about 12, his mother (played by the sister of the
real Dalai Lama!) asks Heinrich to tutor him. His Holiness is bright,
witty, enormously curious about Western ways and other matters, and utterly
charming.</P>
<P>In spite of much protocol, the growing friendship between Heinrich and his
pupil leads to warm informality when the two are alone, in what are
arguably the best sections of the movie, especially as these do not veer
into sentimentality. Weighing heavily too is the fact that while Heinrich
was a POW, he had received a letter from his wife, announcing that she had
had his baby, was divorcing him and remarrying. After the European war
ended, Heinrich kept sending letters to his son until the latter replied:
"You are not my father. Please stop writing me letters."</P>
<P>For the steadily mellowing Heinrich, the transition to considering the
young Dalai Lama as a kind of surrogate son was natural, but again this is
not Hollywoodishly underlined. The Austrian teaches his fast-learning
charge a great deal, from geography and English to the West in general.  In
wonderfully mundane touches, he even fixes an old car, an old radio,  and
since his pupil is a film fan and collector, he creates a movie-house for
the public. (I wonder where and how Heinrich acquired all those talents).</P>
<P>World War II comes to an end. The Chinese under Mao want to absorb Tibet.
Theirs is an enormous army, while the Tibetan forces are pathetically
minuscule. The rest is history. China invades, causes one million (if not
more) Tibetan deaths, destroys 6,000 lamaseries. Particularly interesting
is the parallel between the Nazis and the Communists, a connection probably
not lost on Heinrich but not hammered. The war scenes are impressive.
Finally Heinrich returns to Vienna in 1951, where he makes his peace with
his boy.</P>
<P>Throughout, without engaging in depth into character studies, the film
follows the changes in Heinrich. These were true changes, but it is
simplistic to speak of redemption. The script does not confuse the road to
Lhasa with the road to Damascus. The first part's Heinrich is
self-centered, vainglorious, not the most caring of husbands or comrades,
but the film does not make him a brute or a villain. The problem with
Heinrich actually came up after  the movie had been shot, when in the
summer of 1997, the German "Stern Magazine" revealed that he had been a
member of the Nazi Party, of the SA and the SS. This led to a quick
post-production addition. The evolving Heinrich does a brief voice-over of
"mea culpa" : "My bad deeds are purified. I've done so many things I
regret."</P>
<P>That he was in the Nazi party is to be expected. Hardly any major figures
(especially athletes) were not or could get out of being members. The SA/SS
business is far more disturbing, but then it could be argued that it makes
Harrer's transformation all the stronger.</P>
<P>To shoot the picture in Tibet was out of the question. To film in India (as
originally planned) turned out to be impossible for a variety of reasons.
But French director Annaud has tackled difficult, original and demanding
subjects such as the Oscar-winning colonialist satire "Black and White in
Color," the prehistoric "Quest for Fire," "The Bear," "The Lover," "The
Name of the Rose."</P>
<P>For "Seven Years" he and his people had to fake their locations in the
Argentinian Andes, of lower elevation and different nature. They achieved
this splendidly, and in the face of huge logistic problems. Real Tibetans
(and yaks) were imported in great numbers.
The French Vietnamese production designer At Hoang recreated Tibet
painstakingly and convincingly. The stand-in for Nanga Parbat was in
Canada's British Columbia. The film's look is so beautiful that one can
sense the painfulness of the editing process, where so much fine footage
has to be sacrificed, discarded.</P>
<P>Technically ambitious, the movie does not get artificially heavy with the
moral progress of its protagonists yet does sketches it out sufficiently
and tellingly. The Austrians and  especially most Tibetans are shown
without big epic touches but rather with affectionate,  realistic
understanding, There are many humorous bits too. The Tibetans' clapping of
hands does not mean applause but chasing away evil spirits; sticking out
their tongues means "welcome"; building must proceed without harming any
living beings, worms included; and more.</P>
<P>All performances are very good, with the Dalai Lamas, from ages 4 to 14,
stealing the show.  American heartthrob Brad Pit and British actor's actor
David Thewlis play soberly, do not engage in unnecessary theatrics. Their
well-rehearsed Teutonic accents are above-average in quality and
consistency, but they will not fool listeners who have an ear trained in
foreign languages.</P>
<P>About the vanquishing of the Himalayas. The British concentrated on
Everest, the Americans on K2, and the Germans on  Nanga Parbat and
Kanchenjunga. In 1953, Austrian climber Hermann Buhl, of the Austro-German
team led by Karl Maria Herrligkoffer, reached the summit of Nanga Parbat.</P>
