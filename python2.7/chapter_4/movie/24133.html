<P>Points earned. For likelihood of plot *1/2  For interest of subject 
** For unpretentiousness ***. For Linda Fiorentino *** 1/2.  For Paul 
Newman ****  Bonus points: we at BBNMM (Bring Back the Ninety Minute 
Movie) commend the film.</P>
<P>Its title is the famous quote attributed to robber Willie Sutton 
(1901-1980) when he was asked why he robbed banks. "Because that's 
where the money is." In reality, Willie (also known as Willie the 
Actor for his disguises) never said it. Unlike Yogi Bera, he did not 
leave a legacy of other quotes. But the apocryphal reply has been 
used time and again in wildly different cicumstances.</P>
<P>London-born director Marek Kanievska , has just two previously 
released features. "Another Country "(UK, 1984) comes from a 
prize-winning London play about with public schools (private schools 
in American parlance) in the 1930s, homosexuality, non-conformism, 
the real-life defection of Brits to the USSR. It was nominated for 
Best Picture at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival.</P>
<P>"Less Than Zero" (USA, 1987) was very distantly adapted from the 
Brett Easton Ellis novel on golden youths and their dissipation. A 
peculiar coincidence: The film of Ellis's controversial novel 
"American Psycho" came out the same week as "Where the Money Is."</P>
<P>The skeleton of the story. Carol (Fiorentino) is a nurse in an old 
people's home in the Oregon sticks. (The town is played by areas of 
Montreal). She is sharp, lively and by now somehow aware that there's 
more to life than her job and that there ought to be more in her 
marriage with her high school sweetheart , unambitious Wayne 
(Mulrooney)</P>
<P>A prison bus delivers to the sanitarium chronic bank robber Henry 
(Newman) who has had a stroke. In his wheelchair, he is like a 
near-paralyzed vegetable. Carol, however, instinctively suspects that 
he is a fraud. She tries all sorts of tricks --including sexual ones 
-- to unmask him. In vain.</P>
<P>Eventually though,  she succeeds. Shakespeare wrote "Out of this 
nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety" (Henry IV). Carol, out 
of Henry's catatonia plucks a vigorous, smart, still glamorous and 
sexy man. The purpose of his tour-de-force act as the total invalid 
is a transfer to a place which is easy to escape from.</P>
<P>Now being himself and laying his cards on the table, Henry, 
authoritative. suave and charming flirts and dances with Carol. She 
is not unaffected. He regales the couple with the theory and practice 
of heists. Inevitably, the patient, his nurse, and the reluctant 
husband plan a Brinks-type robbery. It nets them an armored vehicle 
and guard uniforms. The two men impersonate the money-collectors. 
Carol operates the communications system with admirable presence of 
mind.</P>
<P>The first part of the film is cool, laid back like Newman, and most 
unhurried. It is pleasant for the viewers to have time to watch 
developments, catch nuances and not be pushed around by the story</P>
<P>The second part is a savory cocktail of comedy, near-farce and 
suspense. In "their" armored car, the trio follow the scheduled 
route. Improbabilites are numerous, but the sleight-of-hand of 
script, direction and production make you forget all about disbelief 
and the suspension thereof. The suspense  comes from the steady 
changes of venues, each with its own problems and solutions. There 
are echoes of some earlier Paul Newman roles.. There might also be a 
tongue-in-cheek homage to such heist movies as Stanley Kubrick's 
early "The Killing." The genre has longevity. So do several 
pleasantly immoral films which make us root for likable rogues and 
thieves.</P>
<P>Paul Newman is the colorful, masterful glue that keeps things 
sticking together. By the way, he is 73 and not 75  here.The picture 
was made in  1998. Why its release was delayed for two years baffles 
me.</P>
<P>Newman is astonishing. Any signs of the occasional callowness of his 
youth have disppeared of course. He is, however, vibrant with 
youthfulness, energy, humor, self-control, self-confidence and 
wisdom. Still a four-star charmer.</P>
<P>Linda Fiorentino is also an umitigated source of joy. I cannot tell 
why exactly, but at least twice I felt that she looked like Lauren 
Bacall, perhaps because of a combination of gutsiness, initiative 
and.smarts. She is such a fast learner that anyone who has ever 
taught a class would give anything to have students like her.</P>
<P>The plot's movie-movie dialogue snaps and crackles. Carol cuts her 
robber teeth on her own. She gets from a small bank a bonus 
toaster-oven without opening the necessary account. Disapproving 
Henry throws it in a lake. The imperturbable lady's reaction: "It 
says you're not supposed to immerse it in water!"  Or Henry to Wayne 
who will case a joint: "Look at them in the eye. But not like you're 
going to remember their faces."</P>
<P>There are more small pearls of this order. They help raise the film 
from light entertainment to a solid "divertimento."</P>
