<P>     Let me say up front that I have never been especially fond of 
Canadian geese.  Sure, they're cute when they're young, but they are 
long past the adorable stage when they first take to the air.  Now that 
I've made that admission, you might be surprised to learn that I 
actually liked the goose-fest, FLY AWAY HOME.  However, while there are 
geese aplenty here, the movie isn't so much about birds as it is about a 
lonely little girl and how, in pursuit of a common goal, she and her 
estranged father find one another.</P>
<P>     FLY AWAY HOME starts with one of the most disconcerting scenes I've 
seen in a recent motion picture:  a silent car accident that takes place 
during the opening credits while a soft, gentle melody plays in the 
background.  The effect created by this juxtaposition of tragic and 
hopeful elements is sufficient to arrest anyone's attention.  And, while 
the film never again attains this level of artistry, there are a few 
scenes that come close.  Caleb Deschanel's photography is one of the 
movie's highlights.</P>
<P>     The opening crash occurs in New Zealand, where Amy Alden (Anna 
Paquin) and her mother live.  Amy's mother dies in the accident, and the 
thirteen-year old is forced to move to Ontario, Canada, where her 
father, Thomas (Jeff Daniels), has a home.  Thomas, a sculptor and 
wilderness conservation activist, doesn't understand his daughter, and 
his earnest attempts to get close to her are rebuffed.  When asked why 
he didn't visit her more often when she was younger, he says that New 
Zealand is a long way off.  Her response to that:  "That's a lame 
excuse, Dad."  And, of course, it is.</P>
<P>     While Thomas is busy with his work, Amy plays mother to 16 goose 
eggs that she finds abandoned in their nest.  After constructing a 
makeshift incubator, Amy awaits the big moment.  One day, when she comes 
home from school, a brood of newly-hatched birds are waiting to greet 
her.  The story then shifts to the question of how Amy, recognized by 
the geese as their mother, can teach them certain basic necessities of 
survival -- namely, how to fly and migrate.  Thomas comes up with the 
answer:  instruct Amy to pilot an ultra-light plane, then accompany her 
in his own craft on a 600-mile, 4-day aerial flight to North Carolina, 
with the geese tagging along behind.</P>
<P>     As a family film, FLY AWAY HOME has something for members of every 
temperament and age group:  adventure, pathos, technical detail about 
the design of the aircraft, cute animals, and human drama.  On the other 
hand, FLY AWAY HOME could be accused of attempting too much, and, as a 
result, shortchanging its best dramatic material (Amy and her father's 
developing relationship).  There's a subplot involving attempts to clip 
the birds' wings, a look at how the media covers Amy's flight, and a 
sequence where Amy and Thomas' crafts are mistaken for UFOs by the U.S. 
military.  There's also a pro-conservation message that, while laudable 
in intent, comes across as simplistic and heavy-handed (land developers 
= bad; geese = good).</P>
<P>     For the first time in her short career, Oscar-winner Anna Paquin 
gets a shot at playing a relatively-normal, contemporary teenager.  
However, while her tendency towards histrionics has been an asset for 
the period pieces she has appeared in (THE PIANO, JANE EYRE), there are 
times when it is jarring in a movie like FLY AWAY HOME.  When she's 
quiet and reflective, Paquin is excellent; but there are too many 
instances when she goes overboard.  Playing opposite her are two subdued 
performers:  Jeff Daniels, who makes a sympathetic (although not 
dynamic) Dad, and Dana Delany as his girlfriend.  While Daniels has 
something to do, Delany is pretty much relegated to the background, 
although, in the wake of EXIT TO EDEN and LIVE NUDE GIRLS, it's a little 
odd to see her in such a "tame" role.</P>
<P>     Director Carroll Ballard, who brought 1979's THE BLACK STALLION to 
the screen, has long since proven his ability to produce solid family 
fare.  This time around, he has used the true-life experiences of 
scientist Bill Lishman as his inspiration.  Lishman's life's work has 
been devoted to saving endangered species of birds, and the migration 
experiment shown in the film is drawn from trips that actually happened.  
Ballard uses this as the backdrop for a warm drama that's more about 
love and trust between a father and daughter than inter-species 
connections.  The result, even for geese-haters, is charming.</P>
