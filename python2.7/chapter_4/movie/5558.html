<PRE>                                 ERASER (1996)
                       A film review by Michael Redman
                        Copyright 1996 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>**(out of ****) </PRE>
<P>Another Arnold Schwarzenegger movie and this time with even _Bigger
Guns_.</P>
<P>(I am tempted to end right here. That one sentence just about says it
all.)</P>
<P>This time around Ah-nold is an FBI agent who specializes in creating new
identities for and guarding high-profile participants in the
government's witness protection program. His assignment is Vanessa
Williams who has a computer disk filled with secrets (doesn't everybody
nowadays?) about her former employer.</P>
<P>The company, along with key officials in the FBI and Defense Department,
is set to sell enormous amounts of the newest high-tech monster
electro-magnetic guns to the big bad terrorist. Our hero and damsel in
distress have to stop them virtually single-handedly.</P>
<P>There's nothing remarkably new here. In fact several key plot elements
are repeated from "Mission Impossible". Not to give too much away, but
there's a mole in the organization, Schwarzenegger is suspect and guess
who the real traitor is. There's even the same scene where he escapes a
situation by shooting through a glass wall and creates a giant flood;
here, complete with alligators.</P>
<P>The role is not a stretch for the body builder. It's not much different
from any of his others, but he has that one persona mastered. Williams
is adequate, but not more, in the obligatory babe in danger identity.
The best acting comes from James Caan, but even he has been better.
James Coburn is charismatic, but has only a bit part.</P>
<P>The comic sidekick is Robert Pastorelli (Elliot in "Murphy Brown") as
Johnny C who brings a group of Mafioso in to help out. More like violent
Three Stooges than threatening crime lords, these wiseguys provide some
of the best scenes.</P>
<P>In order to enjoy a Schwarzenegger film, you have to suspend
disbelief...and logic and the laws of physics and any hope for a story
that makes sense. But if you can do that, you'll enjoy scenes like the
one where he dives out of a jet, catches up with a parachute in midair
and then has a shoot-out with the plane.</P>
<P>Nothing amazing, not even a great Arnold movie, but catch it at a
matinee and it's worth the price of admission if no-brain action is what
you're looking for.</P>
