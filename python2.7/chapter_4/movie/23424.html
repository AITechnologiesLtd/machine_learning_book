<PRE>THE PORNOGRAPHER
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>"See, my parents never talked to me about sex," explains the boyishly
handsome Paul Ryan (Michael DeGood), a 25-year-old man with the maturity
level of a young teen.  "If I ever talked about a girl in class, my
parents would tease me."</P>
<P>Not having a clue as to how to ask a woman out, Paul turns instead to a
fantasy world of pornography and prostitutes, not that he finds it
particularly fulfilling.  "Lately I've been wanting something different,
something more," he tells us of his desire for a genuine relationship.
This is not surprising since he is secure but unhappy with his world of
paid sex.  He needs a real relationship with a woman.  His prostitutes
will say whatever he wants, but he knows that their words have no
meaning.</P>
<P>Writer/director Doug Atchison's THE PORNOGRAPHER is a wonderful film
quite comparable to the highly acclaimed and popular BOOGIE NIGHTS.
Even if it isn't quite as funny as BOOGIE NIGHTS, THE PORNOGRAPHER is
much more genuine and touching.  As the director correctly explained at
our screening, "the story is more about love, loneliness and corruption
than pornography."</P>
<P>Paul's first feeble attempts to secure dates end disastrously.  Unable
to master the dating ritual, he decides to make semi-autobiographical
porn flicks in which he can get the girl.   After all, he reasons, porn
flicks are so poorly made and plotless that he is confident that he
could do better.</P>
<P>Seeing himself as a successful adult film director, he goes to one of
the big porn studios to secure a position.  Producer Spano (Craig
Wasson), a Jerry Springer look-alike, explains the business to him.
(Spano proudly shows off his equivalent of an Oscar for the best
girl-to-girl sex movie of 1994.)</P>
<P>"This is where dreams come true," Spano says of the adult film industry.
"Twenty percent of video rentals are for adult videos," he reminds Paul,
who looks upon Spano as a mentor and hero.</P>
<P>The reality of the business turns out to be much more gruesome than Paul
ever imagined.  Spano sends Paul to meet Charise (Monique Parent), a
hard nosed, veteran porn actress who uses Paul, much as the producers
use young actresses, as she follows her scheme to setup her own studio.</P>
<P>Spano demands the equivalent of the ruby slippers before he will let
Paul make pictures for him.  All Paul need do is bring back -- read
corrupt -- some innocent young woman who has never done anything in the
sex industry before.  Paul knows just the woman, Kate (Katheryn Cain), a
sweet young Tennessean who is a broke, young actress living in LA.  The
problem is that Kate is a charmingly naive, girl-next-door type whom he
feels guilty about leading astray.  You can almost see Paul's angel and
devil speaking to him on opposite shoulders.</P>
<P>Paul pulls out all stops to lure Kate in.  "The risk takers, they're the
ones that get ahead.  They're the ones that pass you by in the
limousines," he tells her, repeating lines that he heard earlier.  "This
is about dreams," he tells her in an attempt to clinch his deal with her
to do just a little test video in a bikini.</P>
<P>Parts of the film are hilarious with most of the best lines being
unprintable.  Its excellent acting and handsome look belie its very low
budget.  Partly tragic, frequently funny and always touching, the film
creates characters you care about even when they go astray.  A deeply
moving film with the porn industry as its backdrop, THE PORNOGRAPHER
shows indie films at their best and without a single witch.</P>
<P>THE PORNOGRAPHER runs 1:29.  It is not rated but might be an R for
strong sexuality, nudity, drug usage, language and brief violence.  The
film would be acceptable for high school seniors.</P>
