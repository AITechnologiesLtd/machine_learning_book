<P>     The theme of a person locked away for their entire life, and then
by chance released into the wide world, has been explored fairly often
in the past (BEING THERE and THE ENIGMA OF KASPAR HAUSER spring to
mind), and they generally fall into two categories: either the person
will succeed in the experience, or the world will destroy them.</P>
<P>     But in the low-budget Australian film BAD BOY BUBBY, this is not
really the main issue.  The person who is imprisoned is Bubby, kept
locked up for 35 years by his abusive mother in a filthy basement
flat.  He is, to all intents and purposes, an infant.  Then one day he
seizes his freedom, and escapes into the black night of the industrial
suburbs of Adelaide.  The rest is part adventure, part tragedy, and part
comedy.  It's also very intense, confronting and discomforting.  Bubby
is the target of hatred, charity, loathing and love, and this emotional
roller coaster closely parallels the experience of the audience, who
are subjected to black, ironic humour mixed with images that openly
defy the conventions of commercial cinema.</P>
<P>     And despite the well-worn theme, the film manages to keep you in
your seat.  It doesn't have the usual monotonic form of a mainstream
film (an opening exposition, followed by a steady, direct run to a
clear resolution); instead, it vacillates between joy and despair.
Bubby has good days and bad days; the audience gets to ride up and down
with him.</P>
<P>     And despite his naivete and inability to cope, at no point does
Bubby become pathetic.  In the end, he is resilient, and the audience
sees him grow up very quickly without losing his identity.  This, in
spite of all the cruelty that he experiences and inflicts.</P>
<P>     And the visual imagery in the film is amazing.  It is almost
wholly bleak, dark, and at times positively Hogarthian, with a lot of
attention paid to the texture of dirty skin, the sagging of folds of
fat, the dull fall of artificial light, and the patina of used, worn
surfaces.  It's a visual experience that you can also feel and smell,
and it's both repellent and oddly appealing.  The dark visuals add
directly to the film's black humour; both Bubby and his new-found world
are, in places, very, very funny in their cruelty and stupidity.</P>
<P>     It must be said, though, that not everybody will enjoy this film.
It's probably unconventional enough to discomfort most viewers, and the
first forty minutes are set in a tiny, claustrophobic space, and are
quite difficult to watch at times; plus the film directly addresses the
matter of what is beautiful, and the way that women are used in movies.
(Not in any overt way, mind you; it's just there if you want to look
for it.)  And on the subject of sex, this film has a lot of it, and
it's quite explicit, but the way it operates on the viewer is subtle
and strange.  It isn't simple eroticism.</P>
<P>     There is also the matter of the final resolution, which I found
somewhat disappointing; on the other hand, I think that it was
unavoidable, given where the film was going.  Some of the acting is
also a tad uninspired, possibly because those actors weren't
experienced.</P>
<P>     In summary, this low-budget film is an amazing experience; its
good points overwhelm its flaws, and I can only say that it's
thoroughly watchable, and probably headed for a cult following.</P>
