<P>"Once Upon a Time in China" is considered a classic in its country of
origin. First released in 1991, the film was popular enough to spawn a
number of imitators, not to mention five sequels. Watching the original,
it's easy to understand why. The sprawling adventure showcases the
charismatic Jet Li and features romance, intrigue, picturesque settings
and a string of remarkably inventive fight scenes. What's not to like?</P>
<P>Jet Li stars as the legendary Chinese hero Wong Fei-Hong (nearly 100
films have been made about the icon, including Jackie Chan's "The Legend
of Drunken Master"). The actor does his own stunts (with some wirework
to jazz up the proceedings) and the results are spectacular. In addition
to the amazing battles, the story offers an interesting look at another
culture.</P>
<P>Set in the late 19th century, "Once Upon a Time in China" (in Cantonese
with English subtitles) shows a populace under siege from the outside
world. More and more often, colonial forces from the United States and
Britain turn up on native shores. Their presence is intimidating, to say
the least, but the indigenous people have no intention of succumbing.
Their resistance ranges from small (neighborhood musicians play and sing
at top volume to drown out the hymns of western missionaries) to
full-scale military face-offs.</P>
<P>The head of a healing clinic, Wong is asked by a general in the Black
Flag army to teach the locals self-defense by training them in the art
of kung fu. Things get complicated with the arrival of Wong's "Aunt" Yee
(Rosamund Kwan), just back from a two-year stay in the West. Despite her
title, Yee and Wong are not related and romance simmers between the two
(watch for a lovely bit of shadow flirting from Yee).</P>
<P>As for bad guys, there are too many here to keep track of. A gang from a
neighboring town tries to extort local businessmen, corrupt government
officials abound, and then there are those nasty foreigners. I tried to
keep up with them all, but soon gave up. My advice to you is to keep
your eyes on Wong, his comrades and Yee, and just watch the fireworks.
You can sort out the particulars on subsequent viewings.</P>
<P>And you will want to watch it again. While early segments of "Once Upon
a Time in China" contain some embarrassing low comedy, Jet Li's
performance, coupled with his kung fu wizardry, carries the viewer
through any shaky patches. The fight scenes are the main attraction, of
course, and the film delivers the goods again and again. My favorite is
a segment where Wong and his foe use ladders in a breathtaking duel.
Have fun choosing your own.</P>
