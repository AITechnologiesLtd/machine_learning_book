<P>THE REPLACEMENTS ZERO STARS (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (<A HREF="mailto:bill@filmfreakcentral.net">bill@filmfreakcentral.net</A>)</P>
<P>starring Keanu Reeves, Gene Hackman, Brooke Langton, Jack Warden
screenplay by Vincent McKewin
directed by Howard Deutch</P>
<P>Did the makers of The Replacements realize that Major League had already 
been reinvented as a football movie, under the title Necessary Roughness ? 
(So indiscreetly, in fact, that the former's sunglasses-wearing baseball 
logo became a sunglasses-wearing football one.) Given how many other motion 
pictures The Replacements, which appears to have been edited in a blender, 
openly (and badly) plagiarizes, I'm sure the answer is "yes." "But," they'd 
very possibly tell you, "our movie has Keanu Reeves and Gene Hackman; 
theirs had Sinbad and Kathy Ireland."</P>
<P>"But," I'd very possibly reply, "your movie is from the director of The 
Great Outdoors, theirs The Man with One Red Shoe." In this example, Reeves 
and Hackman are nothing more than marketing advantages.</P>
<P>Reeves' casting does the product itself no favours; I never thought I'd 
find myself writing that he's too interesting an actor for Shane Falco, a 
character whose sole defining trait is his non-sports-related job of 
scraping barnacles from docked boats. When he leaves this task, to fill in 
for the Washington Sentinels' picketing quarterback (also white, natch), it 
seems to suck the life out of him; Falco observes the law of comedy 
screenwriting that says the leading man, unless a former stand-up, shalt 
not be granted the same funny dialogue and wacky affectations of his 
co-stars because he already has the looks.</P>
<P>This maxim is also common to producer Jerry Bruckheimer's schlocky 
actioners, which may as well be official comedies. (See Nicolas Cage in 
Gone in Sixty Seconds.) I searched for his name in The Replacements ' 
closing credits and was shocked by its absence; the film's requisite 
recruiting montage, once a staple of the sports genre and since co-opted by 
Bruckheimer, could be substituted by that of Armageddon and few outside the 
know would catch the switcheroo.</P>
<P>As the retired football coach returning to the field during a player's 
strike on a lost coin toss, Hackman handpicks the substitute team in a 
scene replete with headshots that could just as easily have unfolded in a 
casting agency. He rounds up, in no special order: a Sumo wrestler; an 
aggro SWAT cop (Swingers' Jon Favreau, discovering his inner ham); a gentle 
deaf guy; a college-football leaguer (Keanu); a Welsh soccer pro (Notting 
Hill 's Rhys Ifans); a Born-again; a grumpy convict; twin thugs; and, but 
of course, a Gloria Gaynor-loving sprinter (wiry Orlando Jones). These bad 
news bores are unfairly asked to win two out of three games. That they'll 
manage this, albeit with 'side-splitting' difficulty, is presumed (why 
break formula in the climax, of all places?); ergo, after they lost their 
first match, I wondered why a theatre should bother projecting the 
remaining reels at all.</P>
<P>It's not as if The Replacements is entertaining enough to supersede the 
foreordained, unless your idea of fun is not one but three prostitutions of 
Gaynor's "I Will Survive", or a nervous vomit sequence (if you saw Any 
Given Sunday, what you're now experiencing is called déjà vu ). The jokes 
are fusty and/or unpleasant--the filmmakers treat us like a Jerry Springer 
audience, cuing us to laugh dirisively at the sight of overweight dancers 
and whatnot. (Golden oldies include the love interest (Brooke Langton, 
redeemingly sexy) who drives so recklessly it scares Falco, a note-for-note 
update of a much wittier aside from Annie Hall.)</P>
<P>The Replacements also wears its moral heart on the wrong sleeve, and in 
doing so, actually perpetuates more clichés. We learn that football is for 
heroes, but cheerleading is a dishonourable trade--the head of the 
cheerleading squad must also ply in a more legitimate profession, as a 
barkeep in her deceased father's establishment, thus permitting moments in 
which she bonds with Falco by fondly fingering old photographs. And, as 
unsympathetic as I am to the demands of "spoiled multimillionaires" 
(McKewin's term for striking athletes), the film's promotion of 
union-busting shook me up a bit--I'm not warm to the idea of a young, dumb 
and full of come target demographic getting their socio-political 
discussion from big-studio bilge. (--- For more first-run, DVD, and
