<P> Director Pedro Almodovar explains the relationship between tunnels and
the main character of Manuela (Cecila Roth) in All About my Mother with
the line: "Manuela runs away.  She always runs away on a train, through
endless tunnels."</P>
<P> Indeed, Manuela is always moving.  With the untimely death of her son,
Estoban, she moves to Barcelona to embark upon a search for Estoban's
father.  In Barcelona, she is constantly moving from one place to
another, doing something or another for someone.  Save a transsexual
prostitute here (Antonio San Juan), help a pregnant nun there (Penelope
Cruz).  Help smooth out the turbulent lesbian relationship between two
actresses (Marisa Paredes and Candela Pena) here, usher an older woman
(Rosa Maria Sarda) into a great understanding of life there.  She never
stops.</P>
<P> It seems so odd, then, that the one thing that All About my Mother
would have needed to be a really great film was a better pace.</P>
<P> All About My Mother is an interesting, somewhat surreal and oftentimes
bizarre journey of self-discovery that comes during the search of
Manuela for her transsexual ex-husband, Lola.  Admittedly, it is one of
more bizarre foreign films I have seen (although this is not a long list
and Il Mostro was pretty trippy, too).  However, All About My Mother
does end up being an incredibly interesting film to watch.</P>
<P> Penned and directed by Pedro Almodovar, All About my Mother succeeds is
doing several noteworthy things.  The first of which is making critics
laugh.  I saw this at a Cleveland press-only screening with five other
critics, and we all had at least a few moments where we unleashed our
tongue to let loose a chuckle.  The second of which is accomplishing
what amounts to a nearly all-female cast.  In the cast we have one
supporting male, the boy who plays Estoban.  The rest of the film is
comprised of women, and thus it is like watching a Spanish version of
the cafe scenes in "Sex and the City" for about an hour and
three-quarters.  The third and final thing is accomplishing a movie
which deserves a second glance.</P>
<P> To fans of the surreal, who normally can handle subtitles, All About my
Mother will be quite a treat.  It is a film that is able to easily
provide interesting imagery (a joint effort of the great directing on
behalf Pedro Almodovar and the haunting photography of Affonso Beato),
incredible dialogue, and at the same time make you ponder over it.</P>
<P> Despite these three major strengths, however, All About my Mother is
lacking in one major element: pace.  Certain movies can engage
themselves upon thought alone.  Others rely on action.  Because All
About my Mother has absolutely no action to it, it must rely entirely
upon thought for pacing.  The thought in All About my Mother is enough
to fill perhaps a thirty-minute short.  There is simply not enough
pacing present to sustain this film.</P>
<P> All About my Mother has been voted the best foreign film of the year by
several major critics circles.  To say this about All About my Mother
makes me wonder what the other foreign films were like this year.  It's
good.  It gets a lukewarm recommendation.  But its not that great.</P>
<P> Then again, that's the problem when you have to give a film points just
for being foreign.</P>
<PRE>Aka Todo Sobre Mi Madre.</PRE>
<PRE>3.5 stars</PRE>
