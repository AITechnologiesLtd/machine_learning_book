<PRE>NOBODY'S FOOL
**** OF **** grade is A-</PRE>
<P>Nobody's Fool is an excellent character piece that starts great and just
keeps getting better.  It also contains a great Academy Award nominated
performance by Paul Newman, as a aged constuction worker witha bum knee
and very limited prospects.  He lives with his eighth grade teacher
(Tandy is her final role) and has been ducked away from responsibility.</P>
<P>I use the word "ducked" because he is finaly trying to make amends for
his past failing as a parent.  For a man who ducked responsibility he
seems to have all the weight on his shoulders, and that is killing his
knee.  With all his responsibility he finds time to feud with Bruce
Willis (over a snowblower and money that Willis might owe him) and flirt
with Willis' wife Melanie Griffith, whom flirts right back.</P>
<P>Most of the best scenes are very quiet, carefull wording of sentences or
responses to actions.  I meantione Newman, because he is grand for this
role, but every other actor seems to do a wonderful job, including some
I haven't seen for a while.  There are wonderful moments between Newman
and his grandson and Newman and Walsh (his son).  Walsh resents Newman
for leaving him when he was young, and Newman (too proud to flat out
apologize) tries to start fresh being a grandfather, that does
grandfatherly things.</P>
<P>I also liked Pruitt Taylor Vince as Newman's slow constuction partner,
and best friend.  It is nice to see them onscreen, the way they
compliment each other.  The understanding that Vince looks at Newman as
something of a father figure and Newman humor him as he talks, yet
beneath the surface there is an understanding that we gain about the
nature of their friendship.</P>
<P>I realize I am talking about Newman and the subtle relationships with
him.  That is this film, I don'tknow where else I could point without it
leading back to Newman.  So why let old habits die hard.</P>
<P>Of all the relationships, Newman with Melanie Griffith is the best. 
They flirt with innuendo after innuendo and talk about where they would
go if they were free.  There is a great scene where Newman and Griffith
talk about Willis' former sercretary.  He issues a subtle dare, "When
Ruby was here she used to wear a see through top, so you might want to
keep up with her."  She responds by lifting up her sweater and flashing
him.  Game, set and match.  By the way, Newman's reaction to this is
ALONE worth the price of a rental.</P>
