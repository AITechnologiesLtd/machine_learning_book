<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Blow is a slang term for cocaine. The gauche wardrobe and fancy haircuts
are part of the flashy drug scene and the film's attempt to capture the
real look of the druggie scene. Johnny Depp plays George Jung, whose
rags-to-riches true story as a drug smuggler is chronicled in a
stylishly amoral, sympathetic, and lighthearted way by director Ted
Demme. Jung is now serving a long stretch in a federal prison. His
hedonistic journey through the marijuana years of the 1960s and 1970s
and the disco cocaine years of the 1980s and 1990s, is a sad reminder of
the way the pop culture scene had its darker side. The highs from "Blow"
come mostly from the colorful fashion show it parades before us and
Depp's brilliantly nuanced performance, as he shows off his
inscrutability and his swagger, where he challenges us to be sympathetic
to him even if he's a lowlife drug dealer and an uninteresting
character, whose selfish dream is all about himself accumulating money
and material happiness.</P>
<P>There was not much else to get off on, as "Blow" didn't have the script
or the kind of direction needed to blow one away. It played up in a big
way that it was bringing you to the historical places where the drug
scene was happening, as Jung was the American who established a link
between Pablo Escobar's Colombian drug cartel and the unloading of the
addictive stuff in the U.S.. In a voiceover, Jung mentions that most
cocaine users during the '70s and '80s (85%) used Escobar's product. The
movie plays it real safe, as the only users the audience sees are the
flashy Hollywood types that no one cares about.</P>
<P>Demme makes these drug runners into celebrated folk heroes, who are the
"in" people in Hollywood and on the college campus (which,
unfortunately, seems to be true to a certain extent). "Blow" suffered
because it was too simplistic in its storytelling, in its nonjudgmental
stance on drugs, and in shamelessly pulling the audience to the side of
the nice guy drug dealer, George Jung. It doesn't even have the will of
another recent drug trafficking film, "Traffic," to even spend a moment
worrying about the consequences of hard drugs. For this uncritical film,
the drug dealers might as well just be considered risk-taking
businessmen and the rush they get is a business one. But the biggest
bust about "Blow," is that it's just not a good film to get off on. If
cocaine was not the subject matter, this film would be boring (and it
probably wouldn't have been made).</P>
<P>It opens in George's Weymouth, Mass., hometown where it shows his hard
working but unsuccessful plumber father, the kind-hearted Fred Jung
(Liotta), and his materialistic, backbiting mother (Griffiths), clashing
over money matters. These money quarrels left a deep impression on the
young George, and his father's bankruptcy became a bitter pill for the
family to swallow. George swears he will never be poor like his old man,
someone he really liked but never respected. He felt his pop was foolish
to think that money was unreal.</P>
<P>When of age, in 1968, he rushes off to Manhattan Beach, Calif., with his
boyhood friend Tuna (Suplee). The place is populated by airline
stewardesses and all sorts of groovy cats. In this free-spirited
atmosphere, where pot is in, George hooks up with a lovely stewardess
named Barbara (Franka Potente) and she hooks him up with the one
supplying the pot to the kids on the beach, the homosexual hairdresser
Derek Foreal (Reubens). They all go partners in the pot business and
business is so good they expand and ship their top-notch merchandise to
the East Coast, as Barbara acts as a courier and hometown pal, Kevin
Dulli (Perlich), moves the stuff for them there.</P>
<P>George feels good about himself because of his new wealth and visits his
sulking parents, showing off Barbara and her diamond engagement ring.
But his folks are not pleased with his career moves and do not make him
feel good about himself, even though he says things are perfect.</P>
<P>He soon gets busted in Chicago and is looking at 5 years prison time,
but skips when bailed out and Barbara suddenly dies from an illness and
his life seems shattered. Returning to his folks house after not seeing
them for some time while on the run, his mother turns him into the cops
telling him that it's for his own good so that he can straighten out his
life. Evidently some people have the wrong opinion that jail time can
rehabilitate one. In George's case his stay in Danbury, a federal
prison, helped him graduate to big-time drug dealing, as his cellmate
was Diego (Spanish actor Jordi Molla) who will introduce him on his
release to Colombian cocaine trafficker Pablo Escobar. This leads to
George being the U.S. franchise for the Escobar drug cartel.</P>
<P>Next comes enormous wealth, a thirty million dollar bank account in
Noriega's Panama bank, and a beautiful Colombian trophy wife, Mirtha
(Penelope Cruz), who gleefully snorts cocaine while pregnant. She tells
George: "I gave up smoking." But all's not well in paradise. George's
parents are disappointed in him and not impressed with his Florida
mansion or his many luxury sports cars. So George tries to put all his
love into his young daughter Kristina (Lori L. Bailey), but to no avail.</P>
<P>George is too sweet for this business and he keeps trusting the wrong
people, as he runs into one betrayal after another and his life goes
downhill. He's betrayed by all his drug pals and loved ones: he is
jailed; his mother refuses to see him; his wife divorces him; and, his
daughter has never visited him in jail. But who really cares about
George and that he seems to have aged considerably and his blotched face
shows the pathetic life he led and on top of that, he has lost some of
his marbles! George failed to be a worthwhile character for us to care
about him. This film is just another blip in a long line of unimportant
drug related films. Really... the best thing that could be said about
the film, is that it doesn't preach to us.</P>
