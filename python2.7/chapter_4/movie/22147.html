<P>Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo is a very pointed film that doesn't waste any 
time screwing around from the beginning by continuously firing shots at 
the handicapped, blind, tall, obese and Tourette's Syndrome inflicted, 
all to give the audience the pleasure they seek: morally reprehensible 
yet hilarious sexual humor. The production is also big where it counts: 
in the heart. This gigolo is well worth the $8 price of entry.</P>
<P>Deuce Bigalow (Rob Schneider) has mastered his trait to a point where he 
swims with the fishes- literally. A knowledgeable yet sexually deprived 
fish tank cleaner, the highlight of Deuce's day is getting a sales girl 
to bend far enough over a water-filled tank that her white shirt becomes 
transparent. But he soon learns that Antoine Laconte's fish has 
developed a rare gill disorder. Aside from being one of Deuce's clients, 
Antoine is a male whore preparing to leave the country on business. Soon 
the title character is fish-sitting in a mansion and, predictably 
enough, finds himself having destroyed the $6000 mini-aquarium that he 
is supposed to be looking after. The race is on for him to buy a new one 
before Antoine returns home, and there is only one way he is going to 
come up with that much money that quickly: the same way Antoine does.</P>
<P>Rob Schneider is a member of the Saturday Night Live (SNL) class that 
produced stars like Adam Sandler (who produced this movie), Chris 
Farley, David Spade, Norm Macdonald (who has a cameo) and Mike Myers. Of 
the group, Schneider is most similar to Sandler with his ability to play 
an average (or below average for that matter) Joe who happens to be in 
the right (or wrong) place at the right (or wrong) time. Schneider also 
exhibits a Sandler-sized heart here when he falls in love with a 
"client" named Kate (Arija Bareikis). But Schneider is yet to peak, and 
if this movie isn't a hit you may never hear his name again, let alone 
with such prestigious company as the above.</P>
<P>So, just how far does this movie push the envelope sexually? Well, it 
makes the old SNL skit "Fred Gervan: Male Prostitute" seem tame and this 
summer's hit film American Pie seem like Deep Throat (not the Nixon 
informer). A police officer pulls down his pants numerous times and 
complains about his skinny member but no genitalia is ever shown and a 
pornographic film appears on television but only the sound is indicting. 
Deuce's adventures are relatively innocuous beyond some spanking and 
condom use, but you shouldn't forget that this is a movie about a 
gigolo. </P>
<P>Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo will likely make a tidy profit from teens 
seeking its services on weekend nights. The movie needn't worry about 
getting rushed out of theatres as it will quickly go in video stores 
where a significant number of people will probably jerk it off the shelf 
and take it home for hours of private entertainment. Running at close to 
two hours, the film isn't too long to cause pain nor too short to not 
get the job done.</P>
