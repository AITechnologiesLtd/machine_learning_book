<PRE>                          A SIMPLE TWIST OF FATE
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     If you read George Eliot's SILAS MARNER when you were in school,
you will recognize the story has been used as the basis for this film
written by Steve Martin and updated to 1984.</P>
<P>     Michael McCann (Martin) is a cabinet maker who leads a quiet life
as a recluse.  When one day a woman with a small child is near his
secluded home, the woman falls and freezes to death.  When the cabinet
maker goes out to investigate a noise he heard, the young girl toddles
into his home through the open door ... and McCann's life changes
forever.</P>
<P>     McCann is everything a father should be to the baby, who he names
"Mathilda,"  unaware that John Newland (Gabriel Byrne), a local
politician, is the biological father.  However, Newland, who is
wealthy, intends one day to get her back.  When that happens, the court
must decide if the biological father, who can afford to bring up his
daughter in style and send her to an Ivy League school when she grows
up, should get custody or should the poor man who raised her.</P>
<P>     The cast includes Stephen Baldwin as Newland's thieving brother,
Laura Linney as John Newland's wife and five young girls who are
Mathilda at various ages.  Alana Austin is Mathilda at age 10 and a
great little actress she is!</P>
