<P>   "Cue the sun... I am the creator..." announces Christof (Ed
Harris), the director of television's longest running drama. 
Media bigwigs often have inflated views of themselves, but
this guy seems to be going over the top.  Is he bananas? 
Perhaps.  On second thought, maybe WE are; we who spend
so many hours each day watching the tube, carrying its
fashions, its dialogue, its concepts of hip to such an extent
that you can't blame those who put the images on the TV
sets from thinking that they're gods.  </P>
<P>   More American homes have TVs than baths.  Given that
the tube outnumbers the tub, obviously television has a
mighty big influence on us. The extensive authority of the
home screen is the focus of Peter Weir's movie, written by
Andrew Niccol and starring Jim Carrey in the second serious
role of his checkered career.  </P>
<P>   "Truman" is about Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey), an
unwanted baby who even in the fetal stage has been adopted
by a corporation--a TV network company.  Conceivably no
better example of dramatic irony exists in any film ever made:
The entire world knows that Truman's life--his friends, his
wife, his job--is fraudulent, a big setup designed by Christof
for the amusement of the entire earth.  In Christof's wildly
imaginative project, the network honcho constructs the world's
largest stage set: an island peopled entirely by professional
actors (with the exception of Truman, who is the only true
man in the picture), antiseptic houses, an artificial ocean with
occasional bursts of synthetic rain, 5,000 hidden cameras
situated on the dashboard of Truman's car, on street lamps,
and on the persons of the actors, a counterfeit insurance
company which employs Truman and pays him (for all we
know) in play money which is good only on the island.  Even
the sun, the moon, the sky and the clouds are man-made. 
No wonder, then, that Christof considers himself The Creator
to a greater extent than even the producers and directors of
blockbuster shows like Seinfeld and I Love Lucy.  Truman
unwittingly becomes the best-known face in the entire world,
though he is the last to know this.</P>
<P>   Like Sophocles's Oedipus who kills his father and marries
his mother, only slowly realizing what he has done, Truman
gradually and ever so overdue becomes increasingly aware of
his condition.  As the clues drop--first a mysterious stage
lamp falls to the sidewalk in front of him, then he runs into his
father who was allegedly drowned in a boating accident for
which Truman was partly responsible--Truman bit-by-bit loses
his all-American nice-guy demeanor.  He becomes
imperceptibly suspicious and angry with the realization that he
is being manipulated by outside forces.  During this time--
which forms the bulk of the 104-minute film--we in the
audience who know more than the title character find quite a
bit of humor in the proceedings, humor which only rarely
shows itself as typical Jim Carrey shtick.  In one scene
Carrey's wife Meryl (Laura Linney) breaks into a conversation
she is having with her husband to deliver a cocoa
commercial, while in another instance she urges Truman to
throw out his broken lawn mower and buy a new one
(mentioning the brand he should favor).  She announces a
macaroni and cheese dinner with all the ecstasy of an actress
delivering a 30-second commercial, and props up boxes of
cereal on the kitchen table so that the brand name is seen by
the worldwide audience.  Much of the waggery revolves
around attempts by the actors on the Eden-like island to
dissuade Truman from leaving it, as this would be disastrous
for the show.  In a flashback, he tells his fifth-grade teacher
that he'd like to be an explorer like Magellan, but the teacher
responds, "You're too late: there's nothing left to explore." 
When Truman makes a mad dash for parts outside the control
of the TV station, he is stopped; at one point by an "accident"
at a nuclear station and at another by the mere presence of
water which he has been afraid to cross since the "drowning
death" of his father.  When he visits a travel agent (also an
actor) to book a flight to Fiji, where his college girl friend
allegedly now lives, the agent assures him that there are no
flights for at least a month.  Posters around the office warn
"this can happen to you" (featuring a plane hit by lightning)
and urge travelers to take out large insurance policies
because of the threat of airline terrorists and street gangs in
distant locations.</P>
<P>   If you can find more than one allusion to previous Carrey
movies, you're good. The one evident reference occurs when
Meryl is being driven by her husband at breakneck speed,
asks "Can you slow down?" and gets the "Liar, Liar" answer,
"Yes, I can."</P>
<P>   Written by Andrew Niccol, who created the spirited sci-fi
drama "Gattaca," "Truman" displays a great deal of the
scripter's imagination.  No other film in memory uses the
concept of a human being who has spent the entire thirty
years of his life in a plastic bubble to this extent or carries out
the fanciful narrative in such a clever, appealing, and well-
performed manner.  We are led to believe that Truman could
indeed be fooled into thinking his plastic existence, this
shadow of a life on the wall of a Platonic cave, is the
equivalent of a real, free-will experience.  </P>
<P>   Director Peter Weir has done a bangup job with Niccol's
script with the invaluable help of Dennis Gassner's precious
production design to convince us that Truman had no choice
other than to stay on the island.  The father's "drowning"
gives him a phobia of crossing water, the travel agent a fear
of flying, and his own wife and especially his best friend
Marlon (Noah Emmerich) the suggestion that there really is no
need to leave this paradise on earth.  When one actress,
Lauren (Natascha McElhone) takes pity on Truman and tries
to reveal the truth, she is quickly spirited away and when he
tries to go to Chicago, the bus is unable to start.  </P>
<P>   If you accept "The Truman Story" as one of the choicest
recent examples of imaginative fiction, you will indeed have a
wonderful experience in its throes.  If however you try to
decode it for The Meaning of Life as some critics have
attempted, you will be disappointed, because as satire it does
not work.  Are its creators trying to say that television
encourages voyeurism and destroys the celebrities it creates? 
If so, there is no reason to believe that the world's attention
can be riveted on this very ordinary man living an uneventful
life, one which, in fact, the producers want him to continue in
that any dramatic changes in his nature could expose the
conspiracy and end the 30-year-old show.  Are its creators
trying to say, as Christof declares, that we accept the reality
of the world with which we're presented and that we prefer to
live out our lives following the usual conventions, they misfire
here as well.  Truman is indeed determined to leave the
island he knows so well but is prevented by the force--in
some cases the traumas in his psyche, in others the artificially
created violence of nature, in still others the barricades set up
by "police."  Forget about Major Meaning.  This is not
"Network" but a highly enjoyable romp featuring the very
talented Jim Carrey, who fulfills Weir's promise as the best
actor around for Truman's role.  No other performer could as
well have portrayed his determination coupled with
vulnerability that allows us to suspend disbelief and enter one
of the movie industry's finest creations of an artificial world. 
The great Italian playwright, Luigi Pirandello, would be most
pleased by Weir and Niccol's take on the relationship between
art and life. Rated PG.  Running time: 104 minutes.  (C)
