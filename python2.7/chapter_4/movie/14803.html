Flying Leathernecks (1951)</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Mark O'Hara</PRE>

<P>It's hard to watch John Wayne without remembering it's John Wayne.  He's 
not a bad actor;  it's just that he's so famous that his face is an 
icon.  The face and the booming voice and the swaying gait.  And most of 
all, the toughness.  In FLYING LEATHERNECKS        Wayne plays Major Dan Kirby, 
an officer called in to command a squadron of American pilots just 
before the Battle of Guadalcanal.  Wayne plays Kirby with classic 
American stoicism.  He has a job to do and cannot waste time on 
sentiment or guilt over giving orders.  When his squadron loses men, 
Kirby cannot let it get to him.</P>
<P>It's Kirby's second in command, Capt. Griffin, who is a bit too 
sensitive in the line of battle.  That's why "Griff" was not recommended 
for the command post in the first place - why the brass imported Kirby.  
As Griffin, Robert Ryan delivers a performance at least as strong as 
Wayne's.  No, you cannot have an interesting story without conflict, and 
one conflict in LEATHERNECKS is Griffin's resentment of Kirby's 
by-the-book attitude.  At one a pilot peels off to pursue, and 
eventually destroy, a small Japanese plane.  But the American loses his 
plane in the process.  When the pilot returns to base, everyone except 
Major Kirby is ecstatic to see him.  But Kirby orders his arrest pending 
court-martial.  Clearly the men are disgruntled with the discipline, 
especially because qualified pilots are scarce.</P>
<P>Griffin and Kirby have many run-ins.  But eventually we see Kirby was 
using the tough façade to work his men into condition.  He cancels the 
court-martial.  We also watch as Kirby plays a recording he received, as 
a Christmas gift, from his young son back in the States.  So Kirby is 
human after all!  Eventually, Griffin completes the formula by paying 
his respect to Kirby.  Kirby, of course, earns this respect through 
several command decisions and successful missions.  We see more of the 
human side of Kirby when, between assignments, he makes an unannounced 
visit home.  His wife is overwhelmed, of course, and his son receives 
both his father's love and a Japanese sword he can show off to his 
friends.</P>
<P>What's fascinating about the script is that it portrays the historical 
controversy over strategic bombing.  In the film, Kirby is a staunch 
advocate of low-flying support: you receive precise coordinates from 
officers on the ground, and then send your Wildcats in to bomb enemy 
positions, which are just yards away from friendly troops.  During the 
Second World War, this type of support had not been developed, and 
crediting officers like Kirby adds interest as well as historical value 
to the story.</P>
<P>Also of historical interest are the scenes of actual battle.  Compared 
to modern films, with special effects and huge budgets, LEATHERNECKS 
does not supply viewers with extended and breath-taking dogfights;  but 
what we see is pieces of real air combat, even shot in color to match 
the color of the movie - tracer bullets hitting their targets, Zeros 
spinning to crash into the ground.  Considering that directors in the 
1990s still intersperse real footage with their fictionalized narrative, 
the makers of LEATHERNECKS were ahead of their time.</P>
<P>First-rate comic relief is supplied by Jay C. Flippen, the character 
actor's character actor.  He plays a figure similar to Jamie Farr's 
Corporal Klinger from MASH - a finagler, a petty thief who looks after 
his men and keeps the squadron's planes in the air.  When an amused 
Major Kirby looks the other way at Clancy's pilfering, we witness 
another endearing point of characterization.  And it's funny as hell 
when Clancy is busted to PFC.</P>
<P>Released six years after the Second World War ended, FLYING LEATHERNECKS 
does not contain the all-out, gung-ho heroism of movies made during the 
war.  But it certainly praises the American armed forces, and men like 
Kirby and Griffin who were among its front-line fighters.  It makes no 
mistake about its patriotism.  Having John Wayne, the reddest-blooded 
American film hero, as its star does not hurt its impact.  For a film of 
its time, it's a winner.</P>
