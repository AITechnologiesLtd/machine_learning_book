<PRE>                                 CLERKS
                       A film review by Joan Ellis
                    Copyright 1996 Nebbadoon Syndicate</PRE>
<P>Listen up, world: "Clerks" is a landmark movie, and you
will remember you saw it in 1994. Kevin Smith, writer, producer,
director, editor, and actor, is writing in a new language that
represents not only the arrival of a new generation, but also a
profound change in the world of movies. </P>
<P>Smith's "Clerks" and Quentin Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction" have
appeared back to back, a double-feature exemplifying the creative
explosion of the video culture so many of us have misunderstood.
Here, then, is the flip side of the conventional wisdom that
watching too much TV dulls the mind. </P>
<P>Both movies are driven by dialogue born in the minds of men
who have soaked up the rhythms of the video screen. Using a
vocabulary of classic four-letter words not as epithets but as
natural conversation, Smith and Tarantino are saying that this is
the way people talk. If obscenities used to imply a kind of
mental poverty, a literary laziness, they now mean comfortable,
easy exchange. </P>
<P>Kevin Smith raised $27,000 to make a movie about two
convenience-store clerks on his home turf of Leonardo, NJ, and
walked away with major awards at the Cannes and Sundance film
festivals. His movie chronicles, in excruciating detail, the
nothingness of one day in the life of the lethargic Dante Hicks
(Brian O'Halloran), who wakes up on his day off to discover no
one is running the store. </P>
<P>Arriving grumpily at the Quick Stop, he steps into his daily
routine and lets the world happen to him. His drifty and
outrageously funny friend, Randall (Jeff Anderson), needles him
relentlessly to grab control of his life. Alas, poor Dante. A
guy who says, "That's what high school is about: algebra, bad
lunch and infidelity," is not likely to be touched by the
pressures of duty, drive, or goals. </P>
<P>These two spend the day laid out on the floor talking about
girls, hockey, nudie booths, and nothing while selling cigarettes
and coffee to anyone unlucky enough to cross their slothful
paths. They comment on the passing parade of "women who check
the dates looking for milk that won't go bad for a decade" and
"guys who check every egg to get a perfect dozen."</P>
<P>If you can suspend your disbelief and surrender to the feel
of the thing, you will see a very funny, gentle movie played by a
group of perfect slackers. </P>
<P>Ten years ago, video schmoozing was a new sport. At least
two of the kids transfixed by it grew up to be video clerks,
absorbing B-movie dialogue while missing the picture as they
waited on customers. What stayed in their heads were words, not
images. Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino have absorbed the
rhythms of their time, and they are going to teach them to the
rest of us. They have done no less than announce the birth of a
new language and a new way of making movies. </P>
