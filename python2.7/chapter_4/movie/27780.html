Mamet, Steven Zaillian, based on the novel by Thomas Harris. 
Photography, John Mathieson. Editing, Pietro Scalia.  Production

Hannibal Lecter), Juliane Moore (Agent Clarice Starling), Ray Liotta 
(Paul Krendler), Gary Oldman (Mason Verger), Giancarlo Giannini

<P>It's been ten years since "The Silence of the Lambs" attracted and/or 
pleased sadists, masochists, and many "normal" viewers.</P>
<P>It was the second Hannibal Lecter film, the first one being the good 
"Manhunter" (1986)  directed by Michael Mann, with Brian Cox as 
Hannibal.  "Silence" (1991) was directed by Jonathan Demme, with 
Anthony Hopkins as HL. In "Hannibal," made a decade later --but is 
set seven years after "Silence" -- Sir Anthony resurfaces.</P>
<P>He is older but not markedly so. He has not lost any of his suave 
madness, his canniness, and his vigor. But he did lose Jodie Foster, 
whose FBI agent is now played by Julianne Moore. Although JM, when 
not at work, is somewhat sexier than JF, her role is shorter and 
partly lost within the meanderings of the new movie. She is also more 
chic, with Gucci shoes, elegant dresses and a peekaboo outfit which, 
no doubt result from Lecter's sneering putdowns of her cheap 
outfits-- long ago, in "Silence."</P>
<P>All three films came from novels by Thomas Harris, all had major, 
talented directors. The current movie is bound to make a lot of money 
while raising a lot of critical eyebrows.</P>
<P>The plot, simply and simplistically sketched out. FBI agent Clarice 
has led a raid which left five dead. Newspaper headlines shout that 
she holds an FBI record for corpses (shades of Waco.)  She gets 
unfairly reprimanded by her superiors led by a slimy, arrivistic 
Department of Justice apparachik (Liotta). The man also has it in for 
her because she refused his sexual advances. "Your badge and your 
gun" follows as she is temporarily suspended.</P>
<P>In a mansion to end all mansions (actually the Biltmore Estate in 
Asheville, North Carolina) zillionaire Mason Verger (an unbilled Gary 
Oldman), horribly-plus (and then some) disfigured because of Lecter 
(don't ask), now wants to get the doctor, cook and eat him. He has an 
astronomic price on Lecter's head, alive but not dead, since he wants 
to cook and eat him. We later learn that he is employing some native 
thugs in Italy.</P>
<P>In Florence (Italy) Hannibal, in baroque splendor, lives the peculiar 
life of a scholar who badly wants the curatorship of a superb museum. 
He'll do anything to get the post and his other desires, from 
academic to extra-curricular. Lecter lectures (sic) impressively on 
literary, artistic and other germane subjects.  How he got all that 
scholarship is a mystery. But then, the word "lector" meant, at least 
in Church Latin, "reader." We must assume that Hannibal practiced 
reading voraciously, that he was a polymath, that his I.Q. rose to 
stratospheric heights. Even so, in stretching our credulity this 
beats Tarzan's command of English.</P>
<P>When a high-ranking Florentine cop with an insufficient salary and a 
gorgeous young wife --always a dangerous combination-- gets wind of a 
mysterious source (but we know it is Mason) will pay three million 
dollars for the delivery of Lecter, Inspector Pazzi gets going.</P>
<P>The movie diversely canters, trots or gallops non-stop from one 
situation to another but is always on the move. A huge number of 
energetically timed setups and scenes, fast cuts and nick-of-time 
interventions amount to filmic shorthand in direction and editing.  .</P>
<P>The best thing in the film is, for me, the splendid sights, sites and 
photography, notably of Florence exteriors and interiors which are 
genuine yet nothing like the city that locals and visitors know. It's 
often  dank, forbidding, crepuscular, always splendid and arresting. 
Production designer Norris Spencer, save for his work on Scott's 
"Thelma and Louise," was unknown to most of us, as was cinematogapher 
John Mathieson until he shot Scott's "Gladiator, "   Director Scott's 
own style is  also obvious here, especially as "Hannibal"'s look has 
much in common with that of the nearly twenty-years old "Blade 
Runner."</P>
<P>Why Hannibal chose Florence puzzled me until I realized that the 
infernal doctor had chosen the city of Dante. Not only is "The Divine 
Comedy" lurking around, but Dante's "La Vita Nuova" shows up in a 
nice bit of opera composed by Patrick Cassidy.  The excellent Hans 
Zimmer wrote the rest of the score.</P>
<P>Italian culture set aside, or better yet, woven into the film, the 
results are still pop pulp that tries to spook us. Fine. Lecter's old 
slurp-slurps and much of his anthropophagy have given way to a 
suspense thriller and detective story. Fine again, except that the 
story is so muddled and full of holes, so ambitious and bloated with 
obscurities, improbabilities, impossibilities. ludicrous  and useless 
twists, that the desired shock effects are neutralized.</P>
<P>A pity. And there's nothing to replace the "The Silence of the Lambs" 
terrifying (but not physically violent) scenes of Jodie Foster 
conversing in prison with Lecter through a bullet-proof glass 
partition, and the growing ways in which those two affect  each other.</P>
<P>Nothing exceeds like excess.  "Less is more" was the revolutionary 
slogan of the Bauhaus school which introduced so much modernism to 
art and design in the 1920s, from buildings to kitchen tools.</P>
<P>Ridley Scott -- in the wake of his senior compatriot  filmmaker Ken 
Russell -- must believe that "more is more." (Not an unexpected 
stance given Scott's background in advertising and commercials) 
Excess can be positive, as it was in Scott's "Alien" -- but with a 
non-sci-fi thriller Hitchcock's "sancta simplicitas" is a must.</P>
<P>Some attempts of humor are well hidden. We guess right away what will 
happen to Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi, but few will realize that Pazzi 
means "crazy" in Italian. And in the film's penultimate, gory and 
entirely unbelievable sequence of human cooking (in the Hannibalian 
sense) the camera briefly pans to the spine of a book --  "Vegetarian 
Times."</P>
<P>The movie's end is so ghoulish, extreme and scientifically phony that 
it is giggle-making rather than scream-inducing. It can't hold a 
candle to the increasing, real fears about mad cow disease. And
the awkward, unsatisfactory final scene is so open-ended that it 
screams "another sequel is coming."</P>
<P>For a relative antidote to Ridley Scott's extremism, may I suggest 
that you watch his first feature, "The Duellists" (UK, 1977) a very 
good, visually stunning adaptation of Joseph Conrad's story set in 
Napoleonic and post-Napoleonic times.</P>
