<P>     It's the era of e-mail, call waiting, answering machines, and 
cellular phones -- a time when impersonal communication has replaced 
interpersonal communication.  Nights spent hanging out have given way to 
electronic chat group get-togethers.  Generation X'ers live their lives 
in comfortable isolation, never having to face friends or enemies.  At 
least that's how Hal Salwen presents things in DENISE CALLS UP, and, for 
a certain segment of the population, Salwen's scenario doesn't 
exaggerate much.</P>
<P>     If talking on the telephone is a weak surrogate for real human 
contact, then the men and women of DENISE CALLS UP are seriously 
deprived.  None of them ever congregate.  They spend their lives in 
front of a computer and on the phone.  They date, fall in love, fall out 
of love, have sex, and even die with a receiver pressed to their ears.  
Whole relationships begin, climax, and end without either of the parties 
ever knowing what the other looks like.</P>
<P>     DENISE CALLS UP is basically a seven-character, two story play.  
Both of the main plotlines involve characters developing relationships 
with people they've never met.  There's Jerry (Liev Schreiber) and 
Barbara (Caroleen Feeney), a couple who goes on a blind phone date.  
After a few awkward, getting-to-know-you calls, they discover that they 
like each other, and, while neither has time to meet the other in 
person, they spend steamy nights engaging in phone sex.  Then there's 
Martin (Dan Gunther), who one day gets a call out of the blue from 
Denise (Alanna Ubach).  It seems that he once donated a sperm sample to 
a bank, and Denise was the recipient.  Now, she's eight months pregnant 
with his child, and, having learned the father's identity, she has 
decided to contact him.  Hovering around these characters are three 
friends -- Frank (Timothy Daly), Gale (Dana Wheeler-Nicholson), and 
Linda (Aida Turturro) -- disembodied voices offering advice and support.</P>
<P>     One of the problems with DENISE CALLS UP is that it takes its 
excesses to excess.  As intriguing as the premise is, I'm not sure it 
can support a feature-length movie (even one as short as eighty 
minutes), and the second half of DENISE CALLS UP (with the exception of 
a riotous conference call) is far less fresh than the first half.  In 
addition, Salwen's presentation is often cynical, sometimes bordering on 
cruel, and this attitude makes it difficult for viewers to care about 
the characters.  The last scene rings hollow because the people involved 
don't mean that much to us.</P>
<P>     On the other hand, there's no doubt that Salwen conveys his 
message.  DENISE CALLS UP isn't a vacuous comedy -- it has something to 
say, and the humor, some of which is quite funny, represents Salwen's 
method of preaching.  Special mention should also be made of editor Gary 
Sharfin's work.  Much of DENISE CALLS UP's best comedy involves quick, 
expert cuts as the camera shifts back and forth between as many as six 
characters using call waiting to stay on the phone at the same time.</P>
<P>     DENISE CALLS UP is light enough that it doesn't demand much range 
from the performers, all of whom are fine for their roles.  The actors 
do their best to mold likable characters, but sometimes the script's 
glibness defeats them.  So, while Salwen has formed an interesting 
portrait of modern social interaction, his cynicism works against the 
movie's success.  DENISE CALLS UP might have been more effective if the 
writer/director had taken the time to create characters imbued with more 
than token traces of humanity.  As things stand, everyone in this film 
is little more than a voice on the other end of the phone.</P>
