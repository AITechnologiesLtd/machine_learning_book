<PRE>Whose Muse Are You?
The Muse</PRE>
<P>By Ross Anthony
Albert Brooks plays a screenwriter "passing his prime." Having "lost his
edge" he entrusts the inspiration of a mythical muse (Sharon Stone) who's
prone to very expensive whimsy.</P>
<P>In traditional Albert Brooks style, his character is the sharp-witted, yet
droopy eye-browed whiner who just can't believe so many things are going so
absurdly off from the norm. He's perfectly amusing anyway. In fact, he
delivers a few whammy lines that knocked my socks off. For instance, when
wife (Andy MacDowell) rhetorically asks, "You're not going to walk on the
kitchen floor all covered with paint are you?" Brooks responds, "I'm not an
astronaut, I have to walk on something."</P>
<P>However, apparently due to weak direction and/or quickly shot scenes, a few
times Andy MacDowell and even Sharon Stone, look like they're relaxing on
the sofa at home reading the script for the first time. I felt embarrassed
for them.</P>
<P>Though consistently fun in an Albert Brooks kind of way, this film drags its
feet with the business of building to a climax. You might find more to muse
over if you wait for the video.</P>
<P>Starring Albert Brooks, Sharon Stone, Andy MacDowell.
Directed by Albert Brooks and Monica Johnson.
Produced by Herb Nanas at October Films.
Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>Grade..........................B</P>
