Susan Granger's review of "BILLY ELLIOT" (Universal Focus)</PRE>
<P>Beginning with an exuberant title sequence, this charming,
off-beat, coming-of-age story revolves around Billy Elliot, the
younger of two sons of a widower coal miner in Northern England. It's
1984, and the miners are engaged in a long, bitter strike. Following
the family tradition, Billy is expected to learn boxing at the
Everington Boys Club where, instead, the 11 year-old becomes
enthralled by the girls' dancing class, led by a chain-smoking teacher
who recognizes his raw talent. But when his macho father and
rabble-rousing brother discover he's taking ballet lessons, they
ridicule Billy ("Lads do boxing and football and wrestling, not
friggin' ballet."), forcing him to hide his slippers under the
mattress and sneak off to class.  Then come the auditions for the
Royal Ballet School and Billy's joyful, foot-stompin' "I Want to
Boogie" sequence. What makes this heartfelt English import such a gem
is the collaboration of writer Lee Hall, cinematographer Brian Tufano
and director Stephen Daldry, who - despite the simplistic
predictability of the plot - create eccentric, lovable characters and
evocative imagery. As Billy, Jamie Bell embodies awkward
determination, juggling grim reality with a surreal fantasy
world. ("Just because I like ballet doesn't mean I'm a pouf!") As his
father, Gary Lewis is tough-yet-tender, and Julie Walters scores as
Billy's crusty yet compassionate teacher. Jamie Draven and Stuart
Wells lend strong support with Jean Heywood touching as Billy's senile
grandmother who recalls, "I could have been a professional dancer."
While the bleak setting is reminiscent of "The Full Monty," the
energetic mood evokes "Flashdance." On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to
10, "Billy Elliot" is an exhilarating 8. Combining comedy and
poignancy, it's all about being yourself.</P>
