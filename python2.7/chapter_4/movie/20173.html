<P>   Of all the coming-of-age films released this year, the
premise of this one intrigued me the most.  I went to prep
school in the mid-fifties--not the sleepaway sort depicted in
"Outside Providence" but nonetheless one with a similar
setup--and could identify in at least one way with the 17-year-
old narrator.  Peter Ferrelly's novel, "Outside Providence,"
made into a screenplay by director Michael Corriente
and Ferrelly's brother Bobby, spotlights Tim Dunphy (Shawn
Hatosy), a lad from a working-class family who attends public
schools until he completes junior year in the shabby town of
Pawtucket RI, and is then sent against his will to a
prep school in a lovely area of Connecticut.  Like Tim, I was
from a similar background and somehow wound up in a
private Brooklyn high school situated just across from the
rolling hills of the country's busiest golf course.  And like Tim
I had to find a way of fitting in with my classmates, the large
majority of whom were from the upper middle class.  While
my folks owned a small, neighborhood, women's wear shop,
the guys in my class were the sons of corporate executives
who freely brought stock certificates to class as part of their
economics projects while I had only ladies' stockings to
exhibit from my folks' little business.</P>
<P>   Though in some ways the young hero of "Outside
Providence" had a more difficult time than I--his dad barely
knew what a college was, had only an inkling of the meaning
of prep school, and gambled on the kitchen card table rather
than on chips available on Wall Street--his 1970s Connecticut
school, Cornwall Academy, was quite a bit more democratic
than mine.  For ome, many appear to be from ethnic and
religious minorities.  More important, not a single one of
these comfortably-situated boys could in fairness be labeled a
snob, so that Tim was not a fish out of water after all.  When
he shows up the first day on campus with his faded jeans
jacket, an altogether preppie-looking Jack Wheeler (Gabriel
Mann) takes him aside and sets him up with the standard
uniform of blazer and tie before that initial auditorium
presentation. When the young woman of every guy's fantasy,
the intelligent, blond knockout Jane Weston (Amy Smart)
takes a liking to Tim, she may have felt that somehow this
working-class lad could be more fun than the more polished
twits in the school--just as Rose DeWitt Bukater must have
felt about Jack Dawson in James Cameron's movie "Titanic."  </P>
<P>   "Outside Providence" considers the adventures of Tim
Dunphy--in some ways a stand-in for both novelist Peter
Farrelly and co-writer Michael Corriente when they were
youngsters.  The boy grows up quite a bit in that year while
at the same time missing his less fortunate buddies back
home in Pawtucket.  In short, while he is moving on to
broader horizons, he's the sort that will never forget where he
came from. The movie opens on Tim (affectionately
nicknamed Dildo by his dad) and his pals, who like all other
kids during the seventies smoked, got high and got into some
trouble.  In one episode, Tim's pal Drugs Delaney (Jon
Abrahams) crashes his truck into a cop car.  All are booked
for possession of weed.  Through the judge's connections,
Tim is sent to a boarding school with the proviso that he will
avoid serving time if he graduates.  While his dad continues
to play cards with his own friends, who include George Wendt
in the all-too-brief role of Joey (who surprises the group with
an announcement all-too-honest for the time), Tim meets the
classy Jane Weston, who effectively challenges Tim to study
hard and makes the boy realize that "getting more beaver
than the Hoover Dam" is not the prime consideration when
you really like the girl.</P>
<P>   If you come to the film expecting a Farrelly idiot-piece like
"Dumb and Dumber" or a flat-out vulgar "There's Something
About Mary," you'll be pleasantly surprised to observe just
how sweet the Farrelly Brothers can be when they are
adapting a novel composed before "Mary" entered their
minds.  "Outside Providence" is a sweet, poignant, wholly
effective story that does not depend on a sit-coming joke-a-
minute format, but credibly exhibits the love that a gruff father
has for his son, a love that he would have considered
anything but macho to admit openly--until he engages in
some serious discussions with his newly-mature boy.  Alec
Baldwin plays against type as a rough, somewhat hoarse
blue-collar representative who scarcely knows what he has
missed in life as his thoughts rarely extended beyond his little
neighborhood in a decaying Rhode Island town.  As the film's
center, Shawn Hatosy ("The Faculty," "Anything But Here,"
"Inventing the Abbots") is convincing and ultimately moving
as a lad who finds true love, comes to terms with his father,
and manages to glide smoothly between two different worlds.  
   Coming of age movies are not an infrequent occurrence in
cinema these days.  The indie films at Sundance have been
pushing them for a while now.  But "Outside Providence" is
among the most sincere and touching entries in recent years.</P>
