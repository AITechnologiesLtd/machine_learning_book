<P>*ANYWHERE BUT HERE* (rated PG-13, 114 minutes, Twentieth Century Fox)- This
new film by Wayne Wang, director of "Smoke" and "The Joy Luck Club", is
sentimental and mediocre, but the touching performances of Susan Sarandon
and Natalie Portman make it almost worthwhile.  "Anywhere But Here", based
on the novel by Mona Simpson, tells the age-old story of a mother and
daughter who go searching for a better life.  In this film, 14-year-old Ann
August is forced by her outrageous mother to leave Bay City, Wisconsin for
the exciting world of Beverly Hills.  Ann doesn't want to leave the life
she's used to, but her mother, Adele, is a dreamer with hopes and
aspirations.  What follows are two years of role-playing, and the lines
between mother and daughter are often blurred.  Ann is often the mature,
sensible one while Adele is the wild-child.  Their coming-of-age isn't
always convincing, but the actresses each make it seem plausible.  </P>
<P>However, not much can be said about the film beyond their relationship.
The outsiders, such as Benny (Shawn Hatosy), Ann's cousin from back home,
are used mostly for sentimental effect, and no real emotion is evident.  As
a showcase for two wonderful performances, "Anywhere But Here" works to a
certain extent, but I expected a better film from Wang, who knows how to
work with strong female characters.  Expect some Oscar buzz for Natalie
Portman, who really fleshes out her character despite a clunky script, but
don't expect anything special from the film itself.</P>
