<P>   New York magazine calls this movie "The Calming of
Almodovar," though "Live Flesh" is hardly a laid-back
production. The calmness is only in contrast to the wilder
Almodovar, a product of a style of filmmaking fashionable in
the 1980s. During that decade directors were encouraged to
experiment freely, especially in a Spain experiencing 
prosperity and freedom unknown during the Franco era. His
current picture owes a debt more to Alfred Hitchcock than to
his hero, Luis Bunuel: Spain's most notable director departs
radically from the cartoonish abandon and exploitation of the
subconscious to tell a solid story with devastating
consequences. Unless you remain a diehard fan of
Almodovar's Age of Delirium, a devotee of the garish, wildly
inventive and unrestrained in your movies, you may consider
that "Live Flesh" is the director's most accessible and realized
film to date.  When you consider that this youthful-looking
forty-six year old man plans to make his next movie far from
the Iberian Peninsula--in Miami of all places--you can relax,
assured that you will not leave the theater bewildered and
hammered over the head with blatant caricatures passing as
satire.  "Live Flesh" is remarkably taut, logical, even well
framed, featuring the usual elements which make life worth
living: revenge, lust, and guilt and redemption.</P>
<P>   Played out like a game of musical chairs, "Live Flesh" is a
merry-go-roundelay featuring four characters whose
connections to one another prove to be as surprising to us as
they are troublesome to the hapless people.  The opening
scene is startling--comic, yet contained, with political
overtones that will impress those in the audience familiar with
the repressions of the Franco era in Spain.  On one freezing
January night, Victor--not yet even born--begins to make his
presence felt as he jolts his mother from her bed screaming
from labor pains, only to be born inside a bus. The streets are
deserted, the Madrilenos cowered by Franco's emergency
decrees that allow citizens to be arrested and detained
without cause.  Twenty years later, we are pitched back into
the Madrid streets as we witness police officer David (Javier
Bardem) trying to calm his partner Sancho (Jose Sancho), a
troubled man drinking and cursing and trying to forget that his
wife is having an affair with a man whose identity remains
secret.  As they race up the stairs to settle what they believe
to be a rape-in-progress, they encounter Victor (Liberto
Rabal) in the midst of a terrible argument with Elena
(Francesca Neri), a drug-addicted daughter of an Italian
diplomat.  In a struggle over a pistol, David is shot in the back
and paralyzed from the waist down, his alleged shooter,
Victor, sentenced to several years in jail.  </P>
<P>   The young Victor is innocent, however, and when he is not
exercising in his cell, learning Bulgarian, and studying Bible
he is plotting revenge--a plan which may bring to mind a
similar design by Chad in Neil LaBute's wonderful tale of
betrayal, "In the Company of Men."  In the remarkably short
interval of an hour-and-a-half, Almodovar blends a tapestry of
lust, vengeance and redemption involving sexual liaisons that
engage the four principals--Sancho, his wife Clara (Angela
Molina), his partner David, and the young Victor.  </P>
<P>   Employing the psychological reflections common to the
works of another Spanish filmmaker, Carlos Saura, Almodovar
manager to cast sidelong aspersions against the Church,
whose teachings of original sin lead Elena into a guilt-induced
marriage with the paralyzed David, and a compulsive
generosity--before her ultimate realization that redemption
does not lie in effecting a 180-degree change in one's life.  A
liar, druggie, and crude youth, she will give way to an
obsessively truthful and offensively honest inversion--which
does not serve to resolve her life of unending psychic pain. 
Nor does the brutal Sancho learn much from his experience
in brutalizing his wife almost weekly for her indulgences of
infidelity.  </P>
<P>   While none of the performers is as known to an American
audience as Antonio Banderas--whom Almodovar introduced
to the world some time ago--those familiar with Spanish
cinema will recognize names like Javier Bardem, most
recently seen in "Boca a Boca."  Considered by some to be
Spain's top male actor of his generation, Bardem moves
about in his wheelchair with more energy and speed than
most healthy individuals, apparently possessed by demons
that will not allow him to rest.  The strikingly attractive
Francesca Neri inhabits the role of a diplomat's daughter who
changes from the muck of dope addiction to the solidly
middle-class but repressed middle-class life.  Angela Molina
shines as the frustrated, abused wife afraid of leave her
sadistic husband but eager to teach young Victor the
sensuous arts--to realize the youth's dream to become "the
world's best lover."</P>
<P>   "Live Flesh" is a fully fleshed-out drama with Greek-tragic
resonance, evoking the searing pain of individuals controlled
by the Furies.  Rated R.  Running Time: 91 minutes.  (C)
