<P>     "Leslie Nielsen _is_ Leslie Nielsen" reads a tongue-in-cheek opening
credit that opens WRONGFULLY ACCUSED, and no irony could be more bitter.
Once upon a time Nielsen was a B-movie dramatic actor who re-invented
himself as a deadpan comedian thanks to the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team,
who cast him in AIRPLANE! and their television series "Police Squad!"
Those successes led to three NAKED GUN films based on "Police Squad!",
which in turn led to SPY HARD and MR. MAGOO.  The one-time serious actor
who used to play straight man so successfully against absurdist parody
turned into a self-parody, mugging ever more shamelessly as he became
typecast as the prat-falling dope.</P>
<P>     You can expect more of the same -- Leslie Nielsen once again _as_
Leslie Nielsen -- in WRONGFULLY ACCUSED, the latest in a seemingly endless
string of films this summer from ZAZ alumni.  This one, written and
directed by HOT SHOTS! and NAKED GUN co-scribe Pat Proft, casts Nielsen as
Ryan Harrison, internationally renowned "Lord of the Violin."  Seduced by
a slinky temptress (Kelly LeBrock), Harrison ends up accused of the murder
of millionaire Hibbing Goodhue (Michael York, looking like a Madame
Tussaud figure of himself).  He escapes, he runs, he's pursued by a
single-minded law-enforcement agent (Richard Crenna), he searches for a
one-armed, one-legged, one-eyed man (Aaron Pearl), yada yada yada.</P>
<P>     I don't know whether the strained comedy of WRONGFULLY ACCUSED would
have seemed any fresher if it hadn't come hard on the heels of MAFIA! and
BASEKETBALL, but it certainly doesn't help.  Proft tries to keep the gags
coming fast enough to obscure the tedium -- perhaps believing he can
convince an audience that a hundred lame jokes add up to one decent one --
but the gags are worse than uninspired.  They're uninspired and redundant,
the kind of stuff that makes you suspect Proft and Jim Abrahams were
sitting in a room together as they were hashing out this film and MAFIA!,
respectively.  How else to explain the fact that both films include a shot
of a man leaving a lipstick print from a kiss, and a computer generated
tongue emerging from someone's ear, and shots at Michael Flatley?</P>
<P>     Those re-cycled gags are enough to make WRONGFULLY ACCUSED feel
ridiculously tired.  Nielsen's performance merely compounds the misery.
He has become such a flashing red light for self-defeating satire that he
simply can't play the role he once played:  the slack-faced observer of
anarchy. Directors have decided it's easier to get the audience to laugh
at Nielsen than it is to write anything funny to which he can react...or,
more appropriately, _not_ react.  WRONGFULLY ACCUSED features Nielsen at
his least appealing, throwing out rolled eyes, grimaces and misguided
reaction takes by the truckload.  Instead of providing an incongruous
presence that contributes to the humor, he becomes a vaguely pathetic
aging class clown.</P>
<P>     I realize that subtlety has never been the forte of genre parody, but
there are scattered moments when WRONGFULLY ACCUSED appears to have a
decent idea that's not head-smackingly obvious.  The best laugh, one I'm
sure was unintentional, comes from the 30-second cameo by Sandra Bernhard
which belies her prominent featuring in the credits.  It seems like a
clever jab at Julianne Moore's cutting-room-floor performance in THE
FUGITIVE, especially when Nielsen refers to getting information from
Bernhard's character in a scene we never see.  It's probably too much to
expect that level of insider satire to be sustained, especially when it's
so much easier to have Nielsen bang his head on a low bridge while
standing on the bow of the Titanic.  That's about the level of humor you
can expect when a film's number one comedic weapon is Leslie Nielsen _as_
Leslie Nielsen.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Nielsen ratings:  2.</PRE>
