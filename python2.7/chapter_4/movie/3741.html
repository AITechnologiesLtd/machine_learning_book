<PRE>                                BATMAN FOREVER
                       A film review by Jeff Pidgeon
                        Copyright 1995 Jeff Pidgeon</PRE>
<P>It's Not "Batman Forever"--It Just Feels That Way</P>
<P>     I wholeheartedly admit up front that I didn't like either of the
first two "Batman" movies very much.  This sequel, on the other hand,
was created by an entirely new team--nobody (except the fellow who
plays Alfred the butler) was carrying over from the other two.  Tim
Burton's executive production credit didn't worry me much as I had
heard initially that he wasn't very interested in doing the third
installment, so I figured his involvement would be limited at best.
I've since heard that Warners actually didn't want Burton to direct
again, because BATMAN RETURNS was too dark for the huge mainstream
audience Waners was aiming for.  Possibly, but I have trouble believing
they shooed away the director of one their most successful films of the
decade, not to mention of all time.  At any rate, I was curious to see
what fresh perspective Joel (FLATLINERS) Schumacher would bring to THE
FRANCHISE.  I've never liked any of his films either, but FALLING DOWN
showed promise, and like the saying goes, "Nobody Knows Anything."</P>
<P>     After the first fifteen minutes had passed, I wanted to leave.
Usually, if I'm not into it after thirty minutes, it's not gonna
happen.  There are exceptions, but that sort of thing is pretty
rare.  Basically, it's a mess--a loud, confused, ugly heap of color
and noise that occasionally draws into focus only to rend itself apart
with the next action sequence.  The editing is so rapid fire I found
myself longing for a sequence with the love interest (and those are
generally the worst things about the "Batman" series--if I hear one
more speech about 'duality' or 'darkness and light'...!) to give my
eyes a rest.  Val Kilmer is generally a better Batman--he's more
physical than Keaton, which I think is more appropriate.  They even
attempt to make him more of a detective by giving him The Riddler's
puzzles to solve.  That would work if solving the puzzles had a bearing
on the plot, but by and large, they don't really seem to.  The Riddler
and Two-Face keep such a high profile in the film that they never seem
particularly difficult to track down.  The majority of the time, they
seem to be throwing themselves in Batman's face.</P>
<P>     Nicole Kidman is attractive and generates more screen heat than
Kim Basinger, but how difficult is that, really?  Generally, her time
is spent mooning after Batman/Bruce Wayne, or hiding the fact with that
swordplay-type banter that's all the rage in romantic comedies.  Both
Kidman and Kilmer are given more to do than Keaton, Basinger and
Pfeiffer had, but that's not saying a lot.  Their portrayals don't
bring any dimension or empathy to the characters, so it's mostly two
hours of quipping between them.  Tommy Lee Jones has worked with Oliver
Stone, so he knows what it's like to be acting over the art direction.
Sadly, the script focuses more on The Riddler, so his role is lost in
the din--we find out how he became Two-Face later in the picture, on
that Exposition News Network Bruce always seems to be watching.  Carrey
has his moments as The Riddler--he's a gifted comedian, maybe the best
physical performer since Steve Martin--but he has to shriek most of his
lines just to make his presence known.  His sense of timing and
delivery carry him through the wake of the film without getting pulled
under.  Chris O'Donnell and Michael Gough are the two, as Dick Grayson
and Alfred, who come out of this the best.  Neither are given much in
the way of script (as opposed to screen time), but they were the only
two who created believable, empathetic characters out of virtually thin
air.  Although most of their scenes together are the same, they work,
both (to a degree) as performances and as a respite from the action.</P>
<P>     The script is a tangle of flashbacks, one-liners, clues that
ultimately seem pointless, a smeared xerox of the
does-she-love-the-hero-or-the-man conflict from SUPERMAN, another
take-over-Gotham plot, the origin of the Riddler, the origin of Robin,
and the Batman-Robin conflict, the most interesting fragment but mostly
a case of too-late-in-the-picture-to-care-anymore.  We've heard all of
it before, and it wasn't too robust in the first place.  The climax
seems lifted straight from the TV show, only amplified beyond all
comprehension.  It's not something that's built up to as much as
wandered upon.  Much like the previous installments, all the props and
vehicles are destroyed in order that new ones may be designed (and a
new toy line prepared) for the successor.</P>
<P>     The art direction consists mainly of 'put searchlights and neon on
it'.  The main problem with comic books being turned into live-action
movies is that the director seems to feel that since it's a comic book,
he/she can *play* *it* *up* visually, which usually results in clutter
(like THE FLINTSTONES).  It's sad to say, but as time goes on, FLASH
GORDON looks better and better.  The huge sets and CG models are
covered with so much crap in BATMAN FOREVER that it still feels cramped
in spite of the scale.  I've never seen so many lasers and black light
in my entire life.  The new Batwing looked spiffy for its brief stint
on screen (I especially like how it was stored in the Batcave), but
overall, it's the worst looking film of the series.</P>
<P>     I don't remember hearing many of Danny Elfman's themes in Eliot
(ALIEN 3) Goldenthal's score, so he gets credit for striking out on his
own and not coasting (like SUPERMAN II), but to be honest, I hardly
remember music at all.  Most of the score was totally lost in the
onslaught.  I remember hearing brief patches that reminded me of ALIEN
3, but that's all.  Granted, the sound system in the theater I was in
was poor to say the least, so I think the only thing left to do is to
hear it on its own, or see the film in a better theater.  For me at
least, the latter isn't really a desirable option.  So far, CRUMB is
the best film I've seen this summer, and I have this feeling APOLLO 13
and WATERWORLD aren't going to change that.</P>
