<PRE>ROUNDERS
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Rounders introduces us to the world of high-stakes poker. With an
electric cast, and some apt direction, it transforms a run-of-the-mill
storyline into a fascinating movie.</P>
<P>Mike McDermott (Matt Damon) is a master poker player.  He claims that
poker is not a game of chance...it's a game of skill, and he can rank
with the best.  But when a bad stroke of luck proves him wrong, he
swears off the game and concentrates on a law career, much to the
delight of his girlfriend,Jo (Gretchen Mol).</P>
<P>However, things are about to change.  Mike's longtime best friend, Worm
(Edward Norton), has just gotten out of jail.  Needless to say, Worm is
a bad influence upon Mike, and sooner than you can shuffle a deck, Mike
is being drawn back into the world of high-stakes poker.</P>
<P>The story is a familiar one, but told with a surprising amount of
freshness and energy.  Matt Damon provides narration throughout the
movie, and this is actually one of the few examples of where narration
actually works.  The narrative doesn't preclude action on the screen,
rather, it is a counterpoint.  Damon provides an insight into the mind
and strategy of a genius at work.</P>
<P>The games of poker themselves are fun to watch, but you don't have to be
an aficionado  to enjoy them.  John Dahl's insightful direction
highlights the moods and strategies of the game, rather than the mundane
details.  The fact of the matter is, it doesn't really matter that they
are playing poker here.  The game of choice could be chess, bowling, or
hopscotch...it merely serves as the vehicle from which the characters
are introduced.</P>
<P>And what an assortment of characters!  Damon's congeniality works well
in the central role.  He's a character you instinctively want to root
for.  Norton, on the other hand, sort of creeps up on you.  He's an odd
mix of treachery and charm. Even though he keeps on doing the wrong
thing, you can't help but like the guy.</P>
<P>The supporting cast boasts the likes of John Malkovich, John Turturro
and Martin Landau.  Malkovich is the slimy Teddy KGB, a master poker
player with ties into the Russian mafia.  His mannerisms border at times
at being over the top, but because his character is played with such
relish, it's a forgivable sin. Turturro is Joey Knish, a "grinder", who
makes a living on the poker circuit.  He admires Mike's skill, but is
also wary of a dangerous streak, and often tries to give him advice.
Landau is a sympathetic judge who is teaching Mike in law school.</P>
<P>Of the supporting cast, only the women (both Gretchen Mol and Famke
Janssen as Mike's former poker-playing flame) don't get any meat.
They're stuck playing questionable roles that seem to exist merely to
keep this from being an all-male cast.</P>
<P>Just like Mike can sum up the status of a poker game with a few careful
glances, after a few scenes, you know pretty well where the movie is
going.  However, it's a fun game, and at times worth it just to watch
the masters at play.</P>
