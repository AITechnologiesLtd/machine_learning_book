<P>     Oliver Stone is perhaps best known for his numerous politically-
influenced motion pictures -- everything from his Vietnam Trilogy to JFK 
and NIXON.  Of course, Stone has also ventured into other motion picture 
arenas:  the world of corrupt, high-pressure financial wheeling and 
dealing in WALL STREET, a biopic of the legendary rock and roller, Jim 
Morrison, in THE DOORS, and a satire of our culture's obsession with 
violence in NATURAL BORN KILLERS.  Now, with his latest audacious 
outing, Stone has set his sights on a genre film.  The result, called U-
TURN, is film noir steeped in excess.  Yet, although Stone has clearly 
made this motion picture with his tongue planted firmly in his cheek, he 
nevertheless manages to capture all of the tension and mystery necessary 
to hold the viewer's interest.  Hence, while Stone may be poking a 
little good-natured fun at the genre, he has also created a highly-
successful entry to it.  </P>
<P>     With U-TURN, Stone made his first foray into this field by 
operating on a relatively low budget ($20 million) and sticking to a 
short shooting schedule (42 days).  But, although much was different 
about the way the movie was put together, it still bears many hallmarks 
of recent Stone productions.  The excesses of the photographic style 
hearken back to NATURAL BORN KILLERS and include black & white inserts, 
numerous hand-held shots, overexposed sequences, hallucinogenic effects, 
and time-lapses.  I'm not a big fan of this sort of camera trickery, 
since it seems designed more to show off a director's pretentiousness 
than to add anything significant to the motion picture.  This approach 
helped sink NATURAL BORN KILLERS; fortunately, it's only occasionally 
distracting here.</P>
<P>     The narrative twists and turns in a serpentine fashion, rarely 
proceeding in a predictable or straightforward manner for more than a 
few minutes at a time (hence, the title).  Film noir aficionados will 
recognize and/or expect many of the plot's contortions, since there are 
various requirements that have to be met by any entry of the genre.  
However, anticipating certain occurrences doesn't necessarily diminish 
our enjoyment, and the film takes so many detours that at least one or 
two of them are bound to surprise even the most jaded movie-goer.</P>
<P>     Film noir is always more plot-conscious than character-focused, and 
this is pretty much the case here.  Stone and writer John Ridley have 
populated U-TURN with a variety of colorful types, only a few of whom 
show the beginnings of multi-dimensionality.  The best-developed 
individual is, not surprisingly, the lead.  Bobby Cooper (Sean Penn) is 
passing through the small town of Superior, Arizona on his way to Las 
Vegas to pay off a gambling debt.  Bobby has already lost two fingers to 
the Russian mob, and he wants to avoid having to give up any more.  
Unfortunately, the radiator hose of his classic 1964 1/2 Mustang chooses 
this moment to give out.  Bobby gets the car to the only garage in the 
area, leaves it with the mechanic (Billy Bob Thornton) to fix, then 
wanders impatiently around town.  </P>
<P>     The denizens of Superior are a strange lot.  There's a blind man 
(Jon Voight, almost unrecognizable beneath all the makeup) who doles out 
nuggets of wisdom, a flirtatious tease (Claire Danes) who enjoys making 
her boyfriend jealous, a local bully with the nickname of TNT (Joaquin 
Phoenix) who's spoiling for a fight, and a sheriff (Powers Boothe) who's 
hardly ever without a bottle in his hand.  But the most bizarre citizens 
of the small, backwards town are Grace McKenna (Jennifer Lopez) and her 
grizzled husband, Jake (Nick Nolte), who lure the unsuspecting Bobby 
into a web of sex, vengeance, and murder.</P>
<P>     Sean Penn and Jennifer Lopez are terrific, whether together or 
apart.  Penn, one of his generation's best actors, makes Bobby into more 
than just a moody loner.  The intensity of his performance brings the 
increasing desperation of the situation home to us.  Meanwhile, the 
sultry Lopez plays up the ambiguities of her character, so we're never 
quite sure whether she's a good girl, a bad girl, or something in 
between.  Rounding out the cast are recognizable names and faces like 
Nick Nolte, Billy Bob Thornton, Jon Voight, and Claire Danes, all of 
whom provide solid support.</P>
<P>     Many viewers will recognize echoes of RED ROCK WEST in U-TURN.  The 
similarities are hard to ignore:  an unwilling hitman trapped within the 
confines of a small Western town playing a pawn in the life-or-death 
struggles of a femme fatale and a wealthy man.  But, as fun and frantic 
as RED ROCK WEST was, U-TURN tops it, adding 30 minutes of running time 
and doubling the number of plot twists.  Plus, Stone's lurid, graphic, 
in-your-face style is far different from John Dahl's homage to '40s and 
'50s movies.  U-TURN is definitely not for everyone -- some viewers will 
find the juxtaposition of offbeat comedy and noir cliches too strange 
and others will be offended by the film's extreme violence.  
Nevertheless, for those who enjoy movies on the edge, U-TURN offers just 
the trajectory you might expect.</P>
