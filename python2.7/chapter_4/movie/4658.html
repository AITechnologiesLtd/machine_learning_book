<PRE>                                RESTORATION
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This is a throwback to the historical
          epics of the 40s and 50s.  The story is an
          enjoyable if overly-contrived potboiler.  But the
          historical texture, the spectacle, and the costumes
          are most of the show.  The minor weaknesses in the
          plotting are more than made up for by the terrific
          visualizations.  Rating: high +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     On January 30, 1649, Charles I of England, who had earlier lost
his fight to restrict the power of Parliament, paid the price and was
beheaded.  England was in the hands of the Parliamentarians.  Oliver
Cromwell, the Puritan who commanded the New Model Army remained as
unbeatable as Charles I had found him.  Cromwell took control of the
government making himself essentially a dictator.  He went on and
within months subdued the rebellious Ireland.  Charles I's son, who had
been crowned Charles II of Scotland, raised an army to invade England,
but he was beaten back by Cromwell's army.  In another victory Cromwell
presided over a successful war with the Netherlands.  But now the
dictator needed money to finance his victories.  To get it he reversed
a ruling of Edward I (see my review of BRAVEHEART) and allowed Jews
back into England to get their financial support.</P>
<P>     When Cromwell died on September 3, 1658, there was nobody worthy
to replace him and his son Richard was the nobody worthy who was
chosen.  To have a continuation of the harsh Puritanical rule of a
Cromwell and the lack of leadership that Richard offered brought
discontent throughout England.  It did not take much of Richard
Cromwell's rule to make Charles II of Scotland look like a natural
leader.  Charles II was given the throne of England on assurances that
he would take no revenge for his father's death and would allow
religious freedom for England.  With the return of the monarchy to
England begins the period called the Restoration.</P>
<P>     Thus we have an England that was still ravaged from the Civil War.
And it still has bitter conflict between severe Puritans and more
free-living and perhaps even decadent followers of the two Charles
Stuarts.  In spite of continuing conflicts the Restoration was the time
of great cultural landmarks in English history.  Milton wrote "Paradise
Lost."  Social philosophers Thomas Hobbes and John Locke were
publishing.  King Charles had a particular interest in science and
chartered the Royal Society of London to do scientific research.  Isaac
Newton was 19 when Charles returned and was doing his early work.  When
the Great Plague struck London with its full force in April of 1665
Newton fled to his mother's farm and there worked out the laws of
gravitation.  Meanwhile over 50,000 people in London died of the
pestilence.  Luckily he was still out of London 17 months later when a
bakery fire broke out near London Bridge and engulfed a street of
vulnerable wood houses.  Fanned by east winds the inferno continued to
spread and burn for four days until much of the city had been consumed.
Even with a large piece of the city leveled, an estimated 13,000
houses, enough to make 100,000 people homeless, Charles could not
convince property owners to rebuild along lines planned by master
architect Christopher Wren and Charles had to settle for Wren's
redesign of St. Paul's Cathedral.  I is in this Restoration England
that the story of RESTORATION is set.</P>
<P>     Robert Merivale (Robert Downey Jr.) and John Pearce (David
Thewlis) are close friends who are very similar but very different.
Both are promising medical students, but for John successes come only
through hard work and a dedication that is well in keeping with his
stern Quaker background.  Robert has more of a genius for medicine, or
would if he would ever stop partying.  One day Robert is called to
court in a personal mission of healing by Charles II (Sam Neill).
While there his womanizing is noticed by Charles.  Charles is looking
for a nominal and platonic husband for his mistress Celia (Polly
Walker).  Once she is married he can continue his affair with her while
she is still under a cloak of respectability.  Along with this non-wife
wife Robert is given a house and lands and a pension.  But then the
plot takes the obvious turn with Robert falling in love with his for-
show wife Celia.  Luckily this complication leads to others which turn
what was a rather bland situation comedy in an interesting setting into
another story entirely that affords a much better view of Restoration
England.</P>
<P>     Yes, the story does improve as it goes along but the one factor
that remains constant is that the story is never so interesting as to
avoid being upstaged by the detailed and beautifully filmed setting.
Michael Hoffman, whose best known film to date was SOAPDISH, manages to
bring in a sumptuous look at mid-17th Century England at a surprisingly
small budget of $18.5 million.  The budget is in large part helped by
having cinematographer Oliver Stapleton use relatively close shots of
nearly every fancy scene.  This only occasionally gives a feeling of
constriction and probably saves immensely on costs.  Rupert Walters's
screenplay based on the novel by Rose Tremain moves the story at a pace
that never drags and allows the action to bring the audience to a
surprising number interesting places, yet never occupies the viewer too
much to look for the detail at the sides of the frame.  The film is a
study in contrasts.  We go back and forth from the pleasureless work of
the Quakers to the workless pleasures of life in Charles's court.  We
see people who are all style and no substance and styleless people of
great substance.</P>
<P>     In spite of the low budget, one has to look a fair distance down
the cast list to find unfamiliar names.  David Thewlis is very good as
the dedicated and serious friend and colleague though he carries some
baggage from his skin-crawling role in NAKED.  Polly Walker of
ENCHANTED APRIL and PATRIOT GAMES makes a fetching mistress.  Also
present are Meg Ryan, Ian McKellen (currently starring in RICHARD III),
and of course Hugh Grant.</P>
<P>     For those who like films that show them a bit of a different world
and a different time, this film should be a pleasant surprise.  I give
it a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
<P>     For fans of historical films wanting to expand their film
experience and learn about the period, there is a terrific Worldwide
Web site for this film at
<A HREF="http://www.obs-us.com/obs/english/films/mx/rest/top.htm">http://www.obs-us.com/obs/english/films/mx/rest/top.htm</A> with great
links to original source material about the Restoration.  This is what
the Web was made for.  I just hope it remains around long enough for
the readers of this review to who want to have an opportunity access
it.</P>
