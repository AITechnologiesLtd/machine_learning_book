<P>Movie fantasies about or with angels are a tricky genre. Not a
proliferating one, thank Heaven. "It's a Wonderful Life" is the perennial
champion. Other popular movies include Cocteau's classic "Orpheus,"
"Stairway to Heaven," "For Heaven's Sake," "Wings of Desire," "The Bishop's
Wife" (remade as the current "The Preacher's Wife"). A companion genre
deals with ghosts: the superb "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir," the amusing "The
Ghost Goes West," "Ghost," "Blithe Spirit," the old "Peter Ibbetson," the
wonderful, fairly recent "Truly Madly Deeply." There are also films with
heavenly envoys like "Here Comes Mr. Jordan" or entertaining visits to
Satan, like the original "Heaven Can Wait."</P>
<P>"Michael" is a disappointment, doubly so as it was made by the talented
journalist, novelist, essayist, and filmmaker Nora Ephron. Her excellent
track record as screenwriter and/or director, includes "Silkwood," "When
Harry Met Sally," "This is My Life," "Sleepless in Seattle" and the very
funny but terribly underrated Steve Martin vehicle "My Blue Heaven."</P>
<P>"Michael" is already making gadzillions at the box office, mostly on the
strength of John Travolta whose comeback has been stupendous. But ticket
sales are absolutely not a measure of movie quality.</P>
<P>Here we have partners Hurt and Pastorelli who are reporters (so to speak)
for the   Chicago-published "The National Mirror," one of those supermarket
tabloids that stop at nothing. With their irascible editor Hoskins the
buddies have an unlikely relationship which is also muddy, like most of the
movie.</P>
<P>Hurt gets a fan letter from Jean Stapleton (as Pansy Milbank), who invites
him to come to her home in rural Iowa and meet a real angel who is staying
with her. We never know how much of this the journalists believe, but they
quickly talk Hoskins into an assignment. As improbabilities pile up, the
boss adds to the team the just-hired MacDowell, a multi-divorced dog
trainer. In another of the film's arbitrarinesses Hoskins decides on the
spot that she is a specialist on angels.</P>
<P>Widow Milbank is the owner of a decrepit, 1930's style motel of clientless
cabins. The angel is genuine but not typecast. He is an ill-kempt,
chain-smoking, boozing, cussing yahoo who eats like a slob, likes sex and
in certain ways seems related to Archie Bunker -- the TV husband of Jean
Stapleton.  But he does have wings and some odd kind of maverick appeal.</P>
<P>"Michael" soon becomes a road movie as the trio drive Michael to Chicago.
It's a long trip because Michael, always cheerful and full of bad jokes and
hearty yuk-yuks wants to take in sights of Americana, such as the world's
largest  ball of twine and the biggest non-stick fry-pan.</P>
<P>No one ever notices that he is an angel, because the film cheats. Even
though he wears a large overcoat, his winged back ought to have bulged like
Notre Dame's Quasimodo's, but doesn't. More cheating follows as Michael
somehow becomes more couth.</P>
<P>In restaurants, no one objects to his smoking. Women go for him in the
blink of an eye. In one place Michael improvises a dance with two girls who
are joined by the rest of the female clientele. There's still a lot
Saturday night fever left in the older and bulkier Travolta. This part is
what, in my rating, accounts for the extra half-star.</P>
<P>Predictably, this leads to an attack by local yokels, a major melee and an
appearance before Judge Teri Garr who wants to see Michael in chambers. You
guess the rest. You are also guessing, for no valid reason except that you
know Hollywood's standards, that Andie and John will bond, to put it
politely.</P>
<P>Back on the road we learn that Andie is a part-time composer of country
music. She sings a sample in another eatery where a lot of "poetic"
nonsense about pies fills the air.</P>
<P>The main trouble with this movie is a boring, four-writer script which
illustrates the saying "A camel is a horse built by a committee." The
dialogue is dull, dull, dull,  uinteresting and unwitty. The acting by the
three non-angelic principals is minimal and wooden.These characters lack
character, appeal, personality, dimensionality or connections to one
another. Lifeless Pastorelli is even upstaged by his dog Sparky. This
sketchiness extends to the supporting roles.</P>
<P>Travolta does his best of a bad scene as he tries to be whimsical, funny
and likable. Nothing helps. Twenty-six songs try to rescue the movie. They
don't help either. You sense all along the frantic, exponentially growing
searches for what to do next.</P>
<P>It's a long trip to Chicago, longer for the public than for the actors.
It's not often that a would-be humorously feel-good picture goes by without
some audience laughter or appreciative sounds, yet the many people I saw it
with were entirely silent throughout. At least, nobody snored.</P>
