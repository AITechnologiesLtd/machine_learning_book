                                 THE MATRIX
                         A movie review by Joe Barlow
                             (c) Copyright 1999</PRE>
<PRE>STARRING:  Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne
DIRECTORS: Larry and Andy Wachowski
WRITERS:   Larry and Andy Wachowski
RATED:     R
RELEASED:  1999</PRE>
<PRE>                RATING: *** 1/2  (out of a possible ****)</PRE>
<PRE>        (WARNING:  Although I usually try not to reveal any
        plot-critical information (aka "spoilers") in my movie
        reviews, I can think of no way to discuss "The
        Matrix" without disclosing at least a few of the
        plot-twists.  I will try to keep this information
        to an absolute minimum, but if you intend to see
        the movie and want no advance knowledge of the
        storyline, you may wish to skip this review.  -JB)</PRE>
<P>        What is "reality?"  Most people would probably describe it
as the day-to-day events that comprise our existence.  Or perhaps
you'd call it the conglomeration of sensory input relayed to your
brain via your eyes, ears, nose, tounge and fingers.  Either is an
acceptable definition.</P>
<P>        But are there other levels?  If you find yourself trapped
inside a terrifying dream from which you can not awaken, is that
reality?  What if you'd spent your entire life trapped inside Star
Trek's Holodeck, and had no idea that everything around you was
a fabrication created by a giant computer?  It's all you've ever
known... but is it "real?"</P>
<P>        Now, suppose everyone else you've ever known is trapped in
that Holodeck with you, and none of you have any idea that the world
is anything less than it seems.  What do you call that?</P>
<PRE>        You'd call it "The Matrix," of course.</PRE>
<P>        The Wachowski Brothers' new science-fiction thriller is
a slick, cerebral flash of ingenuity out of the clear blue sky.
Painted with broad strokes of characterization, the film is smart
and thought-provoking as it drags the viewer along with the sheer
force of its momentum.  The story borrows heavily from science-
fiction's illustrious past, plundering such works as "Pi,"
"Alien," "Tron," "Sliders," "Metropolis" and even "Nightmare on
Elm Street" for the parts from which it constructs its
Frankensteinian tale.  Such a haphazardly-built plot should
reek of staleness, but "The Matrix" takes its well-worn ingredients
and recycles them into an appealing mix all its own.</P>
<P>        Thomas "Neo" Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is a software
programmer cursed like so many of us with a job that he hates.
He toughs it out for one reason: it allows him to pay the rent
as he struggles towards his true goal: the decipheration of a
complex mathematical theory he refers to as the Matrix.  This
Matrix is part of everything in the universe, yet remains
intangible-- a bit like The Force in "Star Wars."</P>
<P>        Indeed, I'm curious to know whether the Wachowski
Brothers actually used George Lucas's famous trilogy as the basis
for this work, as the parallels are striking.  We have an
average guy for a hero, plucked seemingly at random and charged
with saving the universe from a formidable tyranny.  Along the
way he learns the ways of the Matrix (aka The Force).  There's
even an Obi-Wan character: Neo receives assistance in his quest
from a mysterious hacker named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne),
who knows more about the Matrix than Neo's mind is able to
comprehend.  Morpheus recognizes his friend's confusion and
skepticism: "You have the look of someone who is accepting what he
sees only because he expects to wake up at any moment," he observes.
Nonetheless, Morpheus works diligently to help Neo learn the ways of
the Matrix.  He is sure that Neo is "The One"-- the person who will
be able to shatter the illusion of reality, thereby bringing
enlightenment to the world.  It is not an exaggeration to say that
Morpheus plays Ben Kenobi to Neo's Luke Skywalker as he trains his
apprentice in the ways of this strange power.</P>
<P>        "The Matrix" is one of the most kinetic films you're
likely to see this year; it's not a work that slows down for the
small details-- stop focusing on the screen and you're likely to
find yourself lost, if only temporarily.  Nor is the film a slave
to its effects: our characters here are interesting and well-acted,
with Keanu Reeves hitting the right note of confusion and
befuddlement required by his character.  (That sounds like a slam,
but it's not intended to be.  The same traits that made him so
laughable in "Bram Stoker's Dracula" make him a perfect Neo.)
As always, Laurence Fishburne is strong, confident, and impossible
to ignore.</P>
<P>        "The Matrix" raises a lot of thoughtful issues; the minimal
plot description I have given is really only the tip of the
proverbial iceberg.  This is a visionary work, and comes highly
recommended for fans of science-fiction.  Warner Brothers apparantly
thinks so too: there's already talk of turning the film into a
trilogy (yet another "Star Wars" comparison!).  I'll be interested
to see whether it can survive the onslaught of "The Phantom Menace"
in May.  It deserves to.</P>
