<P>Iron Monkey director Yuen Woo-ping hasn't helmed a film in over six years,
and although he's hardly a household name in the U.S., many may know him as
the guy responsible for choreographing the incredible fight scenes in Oscar
winners The Matrix and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  Thanks to Quentin
Tarantino, who has a more-than-decent track record when it comes to
releasing cooler-than-cool Asian films in the States (see Chungking Express,
Sonatine and Mighty Peking Man), people will finally understand why overseas
audiences yawned when they saw Crouching Tiger.</P>
<P>Monkey was originally released in 1993 (it's already available here on video
and DVD) and was such a big hit that its sequel is now five years old.  The
movie is somewhat of a prequel to the immensely popular and much revered
Once Upon a Time in China, the seven-film (and counting) series that
catapulted Jet Li to international stardom.  Monkey and China, not to
mention Jackie Chan's Drunken Master pictures, tell the story of a Chinese
folk legend named Wong Fei-Hung, who was something like the Davy Crockett of
that country during the mid 1800s.</P>
<P>Here, Fei-Hung is a child (and is played by a young girl named Tsang
Sze-Man), who, along with his father Wong Kei-Ying (Donnie Yen, Highlander:
Endgame), have just arrived in Zhejing, a city run by the crooked Governor
Cheng (James Wong).  With thousands of peasants seeking refuge in the city
courtesy of rural flooding and bloodthirsty warlords, Cheng keeps a huge
stockpile of food while his subjects dine on stone soup.  Their only hope is
Iron Monkey, a mysterious Robin Hood-type who liberates the Governor's gold
and gives it to the commoners.</P>
<P>As you might expect, Iron Monkey, who is really a mild-mannered local doctor
(Yu Rong-guang), is not very well-received by the Governor and the soldiers
who are paid to protect him.  When word arrives that the Royal Minister (Yen
Yee Kwan) is on his way to Zhejing to get to the bottom of the whole Iron
Monkey thing, the Governor panics and orders his soldiers to lock up anybody
who could possibly be the big I.M. (leading to a funny scene with dialogue
like "You sneezed like a monkey.  Now come with me").</P>
<P>Combining the nighttime rooftop air ballet of Crouching Tiger with the humor
and physical comedy of The Three Stooges, Monkey, which is both dubbed and
subtitled, has a jaw-dropping finale that takes place on the business ends
of a bunch of wooden poles.  And like Crouching Tiger, the film offers
strong female characters (the doctor's assistant, played by Jean Wang, kicks
as much ass as anybody in the film).  Monkey was written by, among others,
Hong Kong legend Tsui Hark, who directed four of the Once Upon a Time in
China pictures.  Oh, and you might not want to see Monkey on an empty
stomach because there are a bunch of scenes that revolve around
delicious-looking food and food preparation.</P>
<P>PG-13 for martial arts action/violence and brief sexuality</P>
