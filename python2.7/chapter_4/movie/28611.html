<PRE>CATS & DOGS
-----------</PRE>
<P>Professor Brody (Jeff Goldblum, "Jurassic Park II") is on the verge of 
discovering a cure for human allergies to dogs.  This doesn't sit well
with Mr. Tinkles (voice of Sean Hayes, TV's "Will and Grace"), a pampered
Persian seeking to return world rule to his fellow felines.  When the 
Brody's dog, a canine agent named Buddy, is catnapped, the canine underground's
attempts to plant a new agent is foiled and it's up to a Beagle puppy
named Lou (voice of Tobey Maguire, "Wonder Boys") to protect the humans
and foil the felines in "Cats & Dogs."</P>
<P>After the successful anthropomorphics of the "Dr. Dolittle" and "Babe"
movies, "Cats & Dogs" would seem a natural.  But a slew of special effects,
Jim Henson's creature shop and trained animals can't make up for witless,
charmless writing.</P>
<P>After the somewhat amusing catnapping episode, we settle in to watch a
film that simply lays there.  Dogs drive vehicles to headquarters and use
surveillance devices.  Ninja cats and a Russian Blue attack Lou.  The 
professor forgets his son's soccer practice.  Mr. Tinkles gets driven 
around in a limo.  The Brody's are held for the ransom of the allergy drug, 
which Mr. Tinkles plans to reverse and distribute via a horde of mice.
All of this is numbingly boring.</P>
<P>The dogs at least look like real dogs, although the vocal talents of Susan
Sarandon, Maguire, Charlton Heston, Joe Pantoliano and Michael Clark Duncan
are wasted.  Alec Baldwin's Butch, an Anatolian shepherd, is the most likeable 
character in the film, although even he is forced to say lines like 'Son of
my mother.'  (Baldwin now has the distinction of appearing in two of the worst 
children's films ever made with this following "Thomas and the Magic 
Railroad.")</P>
<P>The cats are all clearly puppets, an uneven distraction.  In fact the cats 
of "Cats & Dogs" bear more resemblance to Gremlins than to actual household
pets.  Yet even these cats fare better than the human cast.  Jeff Goldblum 
appears to be in a drugged stupor, his apparent reading of an absent-minded 
professor.  Elizabeth Perkins ("28 Days") is embarrassingly stiff and young 
Alexander Pollock ("Big Bully") is bland.</P>
<P>I couldn't be cattier - "Cats & Dogs" should be relegated to the pooper
scooper.</P>
