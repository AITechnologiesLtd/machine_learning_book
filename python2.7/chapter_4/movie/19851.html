<PRE>                          TEACHING MRS. TINGLE
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Once upon a time there was a writer named Kevin, who wanted to make
a big splash in Hollywood.  He wrote a movie called KILLING MRS. TINGLE,
which didn't sell, so he tried again.  The next time he wrote a movie
called SCREAM, which single-handedly revived the horror genre, paving
the way for big horror flicks... and even small ones like THE BLAIR
WITCH PROJECT.</P>
<P>     And then he made a TV show called `Dawson's Creek,' which was also
a huge success.  And another horror flick.  And SCREAM 2.  And then this
writer was the hottest thing on Sunset Blvd., and even KILLING MRS.
TINGLE started to look good.  Miramax bought it.  They even let the guy
direct.</P>
<P>     Uh-oh.  Mr. Williamson may have a great gift for writing, but it's
not on display here.  There was, it turns out, a good reason MRS. TINGLE
didn't get sold: It's not that good of a story.</P>
<P>     That story involves a wicked schoolteacher (Mirren), who tortures
her pupils ruthlessly just for kicks.  When valedictorian-wannabe Holmes
is wrongly implicated for cheating, Tingle threatens expulsion.
Naturally, Holmes and friends decide to make the woman a hostage in her
own home and teach her a lesson.</P>
<P>     So much fun could have been had with this movie, but so little is
(see also: SUICIDE KINGS).  Though it's ostensibly a black comedy, the
jokes are deathly flat.  There's no `thrill' to speak of.  No scares.
Just some workmanlike acting that plods through about 90 minutes of
obvious tedium before the also-obvious ending arrives.  It's not a
hideously bad picture, it's just so unmemorable that I can hardly bring
myself to form an opinion about it.</P>
<P>     Changing the title to TEACHING MRS. TINGLE, big surprise, has not
made one bit of difference in the quality of the picture, either.</P>
