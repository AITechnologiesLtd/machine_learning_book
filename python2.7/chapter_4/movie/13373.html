`HENRY FOOL' (1998)
DIR/WTR/COMP: HAL HARTLEY
CINEMATOGRAPHY: MICHAEL SPILLER
STARS: JAMES URBANIAK, THOMAS JAY RYAN,
PARKER POSEY, and MARIA POTTER.
SONY PICTURES CLASSICS</PRE>
<P>    The film begins with a dizzying introduction into the life of Queens
garbage man Simon Grim. James Urbaniak (Simon) gives a controlled but
captivating performance, his eyes and lanky body creating Simon as a missing
link between Sam Beckett and Marlon Brando. The sight of ex-con Henry Fool
marching down the street signals the end of this quiet, unremarkable life.
Thomas Jay Ryan (Henry) is rowdy, crude, and becomes surprisingly
sympathetic
in his Mephistophelean role.</P>
<P>Henry first finds Simon placing an ear to the ground, as if listening
for the approaching
steps of fate. `Get up off your knees.' -- Henry commands as he swiftly
moves himself
into the Grim family basement and into the lives of Simon's sex-dependant
sister
(Parker Posey), and morbidly depressed mother (Maria Porter). Henry claims
to be finishing
his ‘Confessions', which he is convinced will provoke and thrill the
literary establishment.
He offers a spare notebook to the monosyllabic Simon, telling him to stop
and write down
what he can't seem to express in conversation. When Simon's book length poem
becomes
infamous almost overnight, Henry and his unaccomplished ‘Confessions' are
left
in the shadows.</P>
<P>The second half of the film concentrates mainly on Henry; Hartley opens
things up to breathe, after focusing almost claustrophobically on Simon's
evolution from
garbage man to controversial poet. Henry is faced with personal failure, and
the looming
obligation of someone so aware of life, society, and his surroundings.</P>
<P>Like the films of Robert Bresson, or J.L. Godard, emotion and human
relation are heavily
dealt with, although not thoroughly expressed thru any individual source,
but as a
constructed whole. The film can be seen as a modern fable, a performance art
piece. Each
frame is so carefully designed and controlled, it's undeniable this story
could only be told in
film. The ‘World of Doughnuts' which Henry & Simon frequent is photographed
uniquely for
each scene, creating a totally ordinary, yet nearly undefinable space. Like
Godard, Hartley's
films can be taken as film-criticism. Almost in antithesis to films like
Armageddon, takes are
long and static. Characters interact in abstract but never embellished
dialogue. The screen
comes alive with stylized, almost modern dance choreography equal to his
earlier `Flirt'.</P>
<P>Is it a good movie? Yes. There's enough scatological humor and mediation
on creativity and morality to touch most segments of the audience, although
some might
find the 2-hour plus running time excessive, or the style too ironic and
detached. Surprisingly
"Henry Fool" is Hartley's largest, most accessible, and complex film to
date. It's a fantastic
accomplishment for him and will easily be oneof the best films of the year.</P>
