<PRE>                          L. A. CONFIDENTIAL
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This is a dense, complex, multi-
          layered crime story that may just be one of the
          best films of its kind ever made.  Great dialogue,
          very good plot, great characters, good musical
          score, great photography. This is one of the most
          engaging film script we have seen in a while.  This
          is a film to rank with THE MALTESE FALCON and
          CHINATOWN among the best of the crime.  Rating: +3
          (-4 to +4), 9 (0 to 10).
          New York Critics: 27 positive, 0 negative, 0 mixed</PRE>
<P>     They are almost a genre by themselves, Los Angeles and San
Francisco crime dramas.  Set in the short space of time around the
World War II are the Philip Marlowe, Easy Rawlins, Sam Spade and a host
of others.  Ranking with the best of them and inviting comparison to
CHINATOWN (which it may even beat) is L. A. CONFIDENTIAL.  Curtis
Hanson who also directed THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE and THE RIVER
WILD has given us a rich adaptation of the James Ellroy novel,
directing and co- authoring the screenplay with Helgeland.  He has
retained a complex interconnected plot, but rarely a bewildering one--
not an easy thing to do.  In it Los Angeles is a completely
interconnected ecosystem of police, organized crime, small-time crime,
race, politics, TV, movies, law, and journalism.  There is a second
system interconnecting idealism, bigotry, lies, half-lies, blackmail,
posturing, cover-ups, frame-ups, delusions, and publicity.  It is
impossible to give a decent description of the plot in one or two
paragraphs as the film has enough plot for two or three films.  At 136
minutes, L. A. CONFIDENTIAL can pack in this much plot only because
nothing is wasted.</P>
<P>     Against the backdrop of a 1953 Los Angeles rotting from within we
have the story of three cops.  Each an idealist in certain ways but
willing to get his hands dirty for his principles.  Bud White (played
by Russell Crowe) has a personal crusade against men who beat women.
He also believes in the code of silence protecting other cops who break
the law.  His captain, Dudley Smith (James Cromwell) figures that make
White not very smart and uses him for muscle and for semi-legal
activities of keeping mobsters out of Los Angeles.  Almost precisely
the opposite is Ed Exley (Guy Pearce).  Exley loves the letter of the
law and sees no reason to be loyal to other cops, but he also wants to
climb the ladder and to get all the glory he can gather.  The third cop
is Sgt. Jack Vincennes.  He gets his kicks being the police expert for
TV's "Badge of Honor" (a thinly disguised "Dragnet").  He like
hobnobbing with celebrities and with people like Sid Hudgeons (Danny
DeVito) the editor for the oxymoronically-named "Hush-Hush" true crime
magazine. The three cops get involved with a movie-star look-alike
prostitution ring run by suave Pierce Patchett (David Strathairn) and
particularly his Veronica Lake look-alike Lynn Bracken (Kim Bassinger).
A friend of hers gets herself murdered in a six-victim massacre at the
Nite Owl Coffee shop.</P>
<P>     One nearly wants to call the execution of this film flawless.  The
dialogue is crisp and ironic.  The script is tightly written with not a
single scene wasted or unimportant.  This is not a film that leaves you
a safe moment to go out for popcorn.  The characters are finely
defined.  No two are interchangeable.  Eventually we understand each
and why he does what he does.  If the film does anything superficially
it is in its explanation of why Exley is such a straight-arrow and why
White so hates men who beat women.  But the visuals really capture the
period.  (One minor error in period: the film shows the premiere of the
film WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE.  That would have been in 1951, George Pal's
follow-up WAR OF THE WORLDS was released in 1953.)  Jerry Goldsmith has
written a jazzy score with the feel of a 1950s film.</P>
<P>     It is amazing how much is packed even into a film of 136 minutes
and into what a neat package the pieces fit.  Be prepared to sit
through the entire film, there is not a single scene wasted and few
scenes the film can function without.  I give the film a +3 on the -4
to +4 scale.  Objectively this film probably ranks with CHINATOWN and
THE MALTESE FALCON.</P>
