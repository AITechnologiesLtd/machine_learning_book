<P>Eddie Murphy's newfangled success post-"Nutty Professor" has not exactly been
inspiring. Missing from his last few films was the wisecracking Eddie from
"Beverly Hills Cop" and "48 HRS." who made us smile with his every maneuver -
gargantuan laugh, wide grin, and a rapid-fire exchange of dialogue like a
charged-up comic ready to make you howl over with laughter at every expense.
"Coming to America" and "The Nutty Professor" were among his finest
achievements, and among some of his best acting roles to date. Add his latest
film "Bowfinger" to the crop - an often wicked comedy where his sure-handed
personality shines thanks to a solidly good script by writer-actor Steve
Martin. </P>
<P>Bobby Bowfinger is the name of a low-level producer/director (Steve Martin)
with big dreams of making a motion-picture with current action star, the
paranoid Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy). Problem is Kit turns him down, and now
Bowfinger comes up with an inspired plan, he will make a film by secretly
filming Kit. He has cameras hidden in bushes outside Kit's mansion, and films
Kit having lunch at trendy restaurants by having his actors sneak up to him and
deliver the lines. Essentially, wherever Kit goes, Bowfinger will be there
making him the unaware star of his film. The catch is that no one in his crew
is aware that Kit has not actually been cast.</P>
<P>Apparently, Bowfinger saved over $1500 since his childhood to make his dream
project called "Chubby Rain," which has a ludicrous storyline dealing with
aliens hiding in drops of water. The screenplay is written by Afrim (Adam
Alexi-Malle), a "damn good writer, as well as an accountant and part-time
receptionist," assures Bowfinger. </P>
<P>In terms of casting, Bowfinger has an experienced drama queen, Carol (Christine
Baranski), who's been waiting an entire year for this opportunity, and wants to
meet Kit. He's also got Daisy from Ohio (Heather Graham) who walks into his
bungalow/office with aspirations to be a star. At first rejected, then accepted
for her great kissing scenes, she finds herself sleeping to the top of this
low-level group to get more scenes written with Kit. </P>
<P>Enter another actor who tries out for a part, Jiff Ramsey (also played by
Murphy), a goofy, bespectacled man who not only passes for Kit's double but is
also Kit's real-life brother. "I am an active renter at Blockbuster," says Jiff
during his audition, who assures Bowfinger that he has had accidents cutting
his own hair.</P>
<P>There are two hilarious scenes that had me doubled over with laughter. One is a
parking lot scene where an unseen dog wearing heels scares Kit while walking to
his car. Another equally funny scene is when Jiff runs across a Los Angeles
freeway while evading all traffic and yelling "Hail to God!" </P>
<P>"Bowfinger" does fall short of expectations even with its ingenious premise, a
semi-cross between "The Truman Show" and "Living in Oblivion." Steve Martin
fails to push the film itself further with comic bang...there are often more
whimpers than genuine laughs. He is still a hell of a writer, but he holds back
too often. Some scenes as directed by Frank Oz are too flat and lack the pizazz
that they need - a chase after Kit while hiding a camera in a tree planted on
Bowfinger's truck leaves a lot to be desired. </P>
<P>If nothing else, most of the actors deliver juicy performances. Eddie Murphy
has two great roles - one as the nervous superstar who tries "to keep it
together" at a Scientology-type cult led by Terence Stamp as its calm,
spiritual leader, and the other as the dim-witted, naive Jiff who for the first
time in his life feels accepted. Murphy plays these roles with aplomb, and
proves that with a good script, he can flow with comic ease and be funny as
hell. His smiles and winks are priceless.</P>
<P>Steve Martin is, as always, good old Steve - and here he plays the ruthless and
scheming con artist as all desperate first-time directors usually are. He'll do
anything he can to make his film, even to the point of stealing Daisy's Ohio
credit cards. Morality is never an issue when making a production - desperation
is. </P>
<P>The one actor who fails to deliver is Heather Graham as the ingenue Daisy. As
in "Austin Powers 2," Graham is lifeless and oblivious - she seems to show
little in the way of comic flair or energy. A sad state of affairs from a
dramatic actress with a powerful range as she proved to have in "Boogie Nights"
and "Drugstore Cowboy." Comedy does not seem to be her forte.</P>
<P>"Bowfinger" is uneven and does not have the breeze or whiz of director Frank
Oz's other efforts, such as "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels," but it is full of
surprises and contains moments of inspired lunacy. Martin and Murphy make a
great team for the world of comedy - let's hope they reunite in the future.    </P>
