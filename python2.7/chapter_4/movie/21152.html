<P>The eighteenth century in Western culture was a different time, with a
markedly different class structure from the present time. No middle
class then, and thus there was a large, unbridgeable gulf between rich
and poor. In fact, England at that time more closely resembled what
would be considered a "developing" country today. This backdrop
provides the setting for a tale of two outlaws who infiltrate the
social circles of the aristocracy in order to rob them.</P>
<P>MacLeane (Jonny Lee Miller) is a gentleman languishing in a debtor's
prison after losing his place in society. One day the wall of his cell
is crumbled by a coach that is being robbed by Plunkett (Robert
Carlyle) and his partner while being pursued by the authorities.
Although his mortally wounded partner is brutally killed by the savage
lawman Mr. Chance (Ken Stott), Plunkett is able to escape with the
freed MacLeane. However, the two are apprehended and sent to prison,
but not before Plunkett swallows a large ruby. In prison, the pair
negotiate their release by bribing the warden with the concealed
gemstone.</P>
<P>After gaining their freedom, Plunkett hatches a plan that can earn
them some money. Since MacLeane was a gentleman, he could pass himself
off as an aristocrat with Plunkett being his servant. This would allow
the pair to determine targets for robbery by getting close and finding
out who has money and what their whereabouts will be. Using a small
sum of money that Plunkett has saved, they begin their ruse.</P>
<P>At their first foray, MacLeane meets, is enchanted by, and
subsequently robs the captivating Lady Rebecca (Liv Tyler). Likewise,
she takes an interest in him, who contrasts with the revolting suiter
her guardian, Lord Gibson (Michael Gambon) keeps pushing on her. She
immediately suspects MacLeane of being the "gentleman highwayman" who
robbed her, but is only charmed by the gentle bandit.</P>
<P>Although it is sketchy and slow to develop, the premise constructs an
interesting scenario. Although the pair are conspiring to criminal
activity, they will the be the protagonists because in the class
politics of the time, the aristocracy are symbolic of greed,
corruption, and oppression. However, at the point at which the pair
begin their criminal exploits, the plot competely withers. The writing
omits any attempt at plausibility, such as having the pair barely
conceal their identities, or always finding their victims unguarded
and unarmed. Plunkett is portrayed as a former apothecary, but is
given powers more like a wizard, using a dazzling command of chemistry
and pyrotechnics to escape from hopeless situations.</P>
<P>The art direction is the only dimension in which the film is
successful. It is apparently the the skeleton around which all other
aspects were meant to serve, which may explain why they were so
underdeveloped. The costume and setting realistically represent the
time period, but the soundtrack gives a arresting but effective
contrast by having a modern tone. Particularly striking is an
elaborate society ball where a period dance is performed while modern
techno music is scored. While these dimensions of the film are
entertaining, they do not redeem the uninspired, cliche-driven plot.</P>
<P>The acting is capable but hampered by the poorly sketched characters.
Only Carlyle is able to raise his character to anything beyond dull
and cliche. Especially poorly written is the character of Chance. From
his first scene he is depicted as vile and sociopathic. However, the
script feels it necessary to bludgeon the viewer with this in every
scene he occupies, to the extent that he becomes predictable and
dismissively uninteresting.</P>
<P>Recommended against. This is a dull, uninspired film that is all style
and devoid of substance. The costume, art direction, and even score
are well done, but the writing is so poor as to make the entire
experience boring at best.</P>
