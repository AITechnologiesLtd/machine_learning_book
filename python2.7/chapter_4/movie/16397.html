<P>SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE
Review by Victory A. Marasigan
<A HREF="http://www.gl.umbc.edu/~vmaras1/reviewsidx.html">http://www.gl.umbc.edu/~vmaras1/reviewsidx.html</A></P>
<P>There's an old teaching that says that everything a writer writes, no
matter what his outward intentions, is ultmately the story of that
writer's own personal struggles. That reasoning seems to have been the
foundation of Shakespeare in Love, an infectious romantic comedy whose
charm sneaks up on you, and which easily ranks as my favorite film of
1998.</P>
<P>All is not well for Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes), whom we see here
as a young, struggling London playwright. Though he still owes one
theater-owner a play, he promises his services to another (Geoffrey
Rush), a man whose creditors aren't above using torture as payment.
Adding a kink to Will's situation is the fact that he's been unable to
write a satisfactory line of prose in who-knows-how-long (His
pseudo-psychiatric apothecary's explanation? Lack of a love life).</P>
<P>With moneymen breathing down his neck, Shakespeare begins writing and
casting his new production, Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter,
without any idea of what the play will really be about. A troupe of
actors -- all men, since women were not considered fit for the stage --
is hastily assembled to fill roles as Shakespeare comes up with them.
The exhilarating trials and tribulations of putting together the play
(eventually to become Romeo and Juliet) are the focus of director John
Madden's cinematic treat.</P>
<P>To reveal the details of the plot here would be to ruin the film,
because part of the fun of Shakespeare in Love is in discovering
familiar story points and picking up on Bard-related inside jokes. I
won't even say how young Will falls in love with the beautiful Lady
Viola (played with a perfect British accent by Gwyneth Paltrow), or how
their forbidden union leads to Shakespeare's triumph with Romeo and
Juliet. Nor will I divulge how the fate of Will's rival Christopher
Marlowe (Rupert Everett) predicts moments from not one but several of
the Bard's later plays, including Hamlet, Julius Caesar, and MacBeth.</P>
<P>There is an inexplicable joy to be had in watching Will toiling away at
his desk with a feather pen, while the ink blackens his fingertips.
Though your typical teenager would quickly say otherwise, Shakespeare
did not write his plays so he could torture countless generations of
high schoolers. His initial reasons for becoming a writer were probably
no different than those of your average modern-day wordsmith. Shakepeare
in Love boldly suggests that something more than an itch to tell stories
and a basic need for survival began his creative streak, something much
simpler and more human.</P>
<P>At the same time that the film asserts that Shakespeare's writings were
inspired by events from his own life, it presents his story as the Bard
himself may have written it. Writer Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman have
meticulously combined moments of high comedy, deep tragedy, and action
for action's sake into a layered spectacle not unlike many a
Shakepearean play.</P>
<P>All-around great performances will have you clapping for an encore.
Fiennes and Paltrow have put just the right amount of oopmh into their
portrayals, something which I hope the Oscar nominations do not
overlook. Judi Dench's deliciously ascerbic portrayal of the Queen
Elizabeth I is good for some of the film's big laughs. And as out-
of-place in this
production as he initially seems, Ben Affleck leaves a surprisingly
positive impression in his minor role as the famous thespian Ned Alleyn.</P>
<P>Historians and scholars be advised: Shakespeare in Love is as much the
true story of the Bard as IQ is the story of Albert Einstein. But for
the film's two hours, the illusion which has been so carefully crafted
is so appealing you wish that it really had happened. To the average
high school grad, the film is a breath of fresh air, like a past due
reward for paying
attention during English class.</P>
