<P>Great Expectations (star)(star)(star)</P>
<PRE>Directed by Alfonso Cuaron</PRE>
<P>Starring Ethan Hawke (Finnegan Bell), Gwyneth Paltrow (Estella),
Hank Azaria (Walter Plane), Chris Cooper (Joe), Anne Bancroft
(Ms. Dinsmoor), Robert De Niro (Lustig)</P>
<P>Think of it as Great Expectations for the MTV generation. You wonπt need
your Cliffπs notes for this one; itπs much easier to follow whatπs going
on because itπs shorter and simpler. And thatπs not always a bad thing.
Frankly, I didnπt mind the movie being set in the 20th century. And I
didnπt mind some of the liberties. But I honestly minded two things. I
minded a movie made about a novel I donπt really like. And I minded a
movie that was afraid to get involved with its own story, despite some
merciful editing and shortening of the original. </P>
<P>I have to reveal my prejudices up front. Dickens is not one of my favorite
authors. His work, to put it bluntly, has always seemed sentimental and
kitschy, and I know I am not alone in this opinion. So I canπt decide if
this story of his is really worth doing in its entirety, if at all. This
movie tries for a hip, rock-and-roll, MTV kind of Dickens, though I donπt
know if MTV and Dickens mix. Kind of like spraypainting paisleys on the
side of a subway train. </P>
<P>So to make the movie move, its creators jazzed it up and shortened it.
Considerably. Mercifully (it is a 400 plus page novel). True to life, or
at least Hollywoodπs version of life, the movie trims much of the fat from
Dickensπs novel and leaves us with only the essentials: the boy, the girl,
Joe and his shrewish wife (Pipås, or in this case Finnπs, sister), the
convict, the old woman, and Pipπs/Finnπs rival lover. </P>
<P>But when the movie eliminates what was bad or insufferable about the book
it also gets rid of some of what was good. Take for instance the minor
characters. Every Dickens novel is full of minor, colorful characters.
They make (and break) his novels. They usually have more personality than
his main character(s), although most are mere caricatures. The following
minor characters are shrunk or cut entirely from the movie: the lawyer
(almost a cameo in the movie), his assistant (missing), Pipπs boyhood and
later young adulthood friend (missing), the woman who works for the lawyer
(missing), and any action in court (missing). </P>
<P>So even though the movie makes the story watchable within a two hour time
frame, its brevity makes it almost casual. Gone are the attachments we
form to the loveable, motley cast of characters of the book. Whatπs left
is sort of like a short, modern fairy tale. All in all, itπs not bad.  It
is beautifully shot (like any good music video is) and well acted, despite
occasional intrusions of unkempt  rock music and some bad makeup on
DeNiroπs Lustig in the third act. </P>
<P>But I left feeling not quite satiated. Which, ironically, is the way
Pip/Finn is supposed to feel after getting (almost) everything he really
wants. But that is supposed to be him, not us feeling that way. When we
see an allegedly great romance arenπt we supposed to be touched? To take
the heat off the movie, I again think that some of the fault is in
Dickensπs story.  For a novel so long, it just was just too trivial, not
≥great≤ enough. With expectations like these top draw from, the film is
sort of doomed from the start.</P>
<P>Not much is embellished or added, except Finnπs new life and the
perfunctory but very tastefully done, (as with nudity elsewhere in the
movie) sex scene. (I hope doesnπt spoil the movie for anyone, but you knew
they were going to get into bed sometime during the show.) </P>
<P>I grudgingly recommend the movie, which is short enough and entertaining
enough for the younger set so they wonπt get bored, but not quite long
enough or touching enough for the more mature crowd, who may leave the
theatre wondering if they missed something more than just the minor
characters. I wondered what the movie might have been like had its
creators trusted in the (admittedly flawed but lengthy) story. I guess
weπll never know. Again, maybe it canπt be done, given what there is to
work with. So we may have Hollywood marketing men to thank for the
sculpting of this move. These are the guys who tell studio execs that the
demographics of moviegoers are weighted heavily in the 18 to 25 age group,
and this was one movie that certainly wasnπt taking ANY chances taxing
their attention span.</P>
