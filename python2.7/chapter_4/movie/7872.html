                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>**1/2 (out of 4 = OK)
1990, PG, 103 minutes [1 hour, 43 minutes]
[comedy]
starring: Macauly Culkin (Kevin MaCallister), Catherine O'Hara (Mrs.
MaCallister), Joe Pesci (Harry), Daniel Stern (Marv), written and produced by
John Hughes, directed by Chris Columbus.</P>
<P>"Home Alone" is probably every child's fantasy; defending his/her home and
family against bad guys by using the same techniques they see on their
favorite cartoon show. However, when we consider the fact the film is
centered around the 10-minute-long, slapstick-laced climax, we realize this
isn't intelligent film-making, but at least it's enjoyable to watch.</P>
<P>Macauly Culkin stars as eight-year-old Kevin MaCallister, who is currently
sharing his huge suburban Chicago house with 14 other family members. They
are all getting ready for their Christmas vacation in Paris, and the place is
insane with children and eccentric adults running all over the place. Since
Kevin is the smallest, he is of course the one always being picked on and
ignored by everyone, which eventually leads him to attack his brother during
dinner and then get sent to sleep in the attic as punishment. These opening
scenes are told in a lighthearted manner that somehow seem completely
plausible. It has a funny sense of realism to it, somewhat sit-com-esque, yet
it doesn't rely on cliches.</P>
<P>Cliches are the backbone of comedy and without them Hollywood might actually
have to grown a brain and think of other ways to be funny and tell stories.
Through a series of events that are both believable but cliche, Kevin winds
up being left home alone while the rest of the family flies to France in a
mad panic.</P>
<P>Children have active imaginations, they can think of things adults would
consider crazy, but in Hollywood they're considered genius. Most of the film
tells the story of what would happen when you leave an eight-year-old boy
alone in a big, rich house almost as if he was exploring it for the first
time. We see Kevin do things he's not supposed to do such as watch R-rated
movies, eat junk food, look through his brother's personal belongings, sleep
in his parents' bed, shave, do laundry, go shopping, etc. Then again, some of
his antics are quite funny, such as sledding down his living room stairs and
out the front door, or when he talks to strangers, and the many scenes
involving his phobias.</P>
<P>But the entire premise of the film revolves around Kevin battling the
bumbling burglars Harry and Marv (Pesci, Stern). This is why the film could
be labeled as a "cartoon," because the idea of a small child outsmarting
idiot crooks is nothing new, yet it does not seem trite at the time. Harry
and Marv seem believable because they don't stand out compared to the rest of
the film. Just considering Pesci as the character he plays is funny, as he
has played so many vicious gangsters and now he is being foiled and tortured
by a little kid.</P>
<P>Harry and Marv constantly keep an eye on Kevin's house, and when they
realize he's home alone, they plan to rob it anyway. But Kevin is clever and
plants booby traps that could actually work, but only with the help of a
multi-million dollar production crew. Some of his traps include: glue,
feathers, tar, nails, matchbox cars, lots of ice, smashed ornaments, cut
ropes, and a perfectly edited gangster movie.</P>
<P>For the most part, the slapstick scenes paid off for me, but depending on
your own cynicism it might be more distracting. The problem is this only
works once, so in retrospect in seems rather stupid and silly, and that is
why the film is simply OK instead of good.</P>
<P>Still, "Home Alone" is a fair family-oriented comedy with a lot of Christmas
nostalgia to it. It doesn't try to be something it's not, but it should have
tried harder to be itself. </P>
