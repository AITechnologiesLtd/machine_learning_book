<P>       This is a hulking mass of a movie. There's just a lot of story,
and, unfortunately, it's not all necessary.</P>
<P>The Insider is fragmented into two main sections, one focusing
on Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe)-- tobacco industry
whistle blower, and the other on Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino)-- 60 Minutes
producer. Crowe does a decent job of apparently
impersonating the real life Wigand (as said by Wigand himself), but
imnpersonation is not always the best route. Of course, I
knew from the beginning that Wigand would eventually decide to speak out
against the industry, but since this was a given, his
struggle to do so should have been more enthralling. There were threats
to his character and his family, but I can't say they ever
convinced me that Wigand ever actually thought about not blowing the
whistle-- it seemed like he was set from the beginning,
no matter how much he tried to act otherwise. This apathy probably came
from the character seeming rather flat. I never felt
like I really knew him-- especially the way I felt I began to know
Pacino's character, Bergman.</P>
<P>Bergman may seem like a bit of a cliché-- the man of
journalistic integrity, but a cliché played by Pacino usually find added
depth. Pacino did a good job of portraying his character, which made it
easier to relate to Bergman, so perhaps the entire
movie should have been slanted more to his position, rather than
spending so much, or any, time in Wigand's position at all. It
surely would have have helped to focus the story as a whole.</P>
<P>The film probably would have been better if it simply kept up
it's theme of upholding journalistic integrity, and simply used
the tobacco issue as a springboard for that, rather than delving so much
into the tobacco industry itself. As it stands, the film
does lean more to this, but it's simply not enough. It becomes bogged
down in trying to create unnecessary and distracting
tension around Wigand when, instead, it would be all the better to focus
on him almost completely from Bergman's position or
point of view [speaking of unnecessary, I'm not sure I'll ever really
figure out what that whole bit about the Uni-bomber was
meant to accomplish].</P>
<P>I loved Mann's last feature, Heat- it was far from perfect, but
it was an interesting and involving film, in my opinion. Of
course, I think it was easy to like it because it was really quite
simplistic-- it was the involvement that made the simplicity seem
to be more than it was. It seems as if, with this film, Mann wanted to
show that he can make a serious film about important
issues. While I think that this film does prove he can do such a thing,
I wouldn't yet say he's been entirely successful. I'll hazard
a guess that he probably worked a little too closely with the editor,
and that's why there's so much material in the final product.
It's easy to lose objectivity in such a situation. Of course, I have no
idea if that's what actually happened...</P>
<P>Perhaps the real fault lies in the writing. The story is just
too unfocused, as I've said. Now that I think about it, what I saw
seems as if they shot a draft of the screenplay that should have been
revised two or three more times. What this means is that
there is a good film on the screen, but not alone. It's there with
extra, unnecessary material.
