<P>Ronin (1998) - Robert De Niro, Jean Reno, Natascha McElhone...</P>
<P>   Ronin, noun. In feudal Japan, a samurai warrior without a master,
   operating independently. This was considered dishonorable, and many
   ronin committed ritual suicide.</P>
<P>   "Ronin," noun. A new movie starring Robert De Niro which has very
   little to do with the previous definition.</P>
<P>   Sam (De Niro) is a ronin of sorts, a modern warrior separated from his
   former master, the CIA. His latest job: working with a group of fellow
   fired guns, retrieve a briefcase before it can be sold to the Russian
   mob. Their enigmatic employer (Natascha McElhone) won't tell them
   what's in the briefcase, or even who they're really working for, but
   at least the pay is good.</P>
<P>   Sam's partners in crime include Gregor (Stellan Skarsgaard), a quiet
   electronics whiz; Vincent (Jean Reno), French coordinator; Larry
   (Skipp Sudduth), the designated driver; and Spence (Sean Bean),
   English weapons specialist. Whether CIA, IRA or KGB, each of these
   warriors are ronin in the waning of the Cold War.</P>
<P>   "Ronin" is best described as a thinking man's action film - more time
   is spent on setting up the action than the action itself. A good
   portion of the movie depicts the characters sketching out plans on a
   whiteboard, then carefully executing these plans.</P>
<P>   A real-world mercenary would, of course, need to do this, but in-depth
   planning isn't exactly exciting. The cerebral aspect is emphasized for
   these scenes, and viewers with a bit of patience will appreciate this
   nod to realism.</P>
<P>   De Niro is, as always, excellent. His portrayal of the independent,
   professional, often arrogant Sam is on target - and that's the
   problem. Sam is entirely too detached from his work, making it hard to
   relate to the character. The rest of the cast follows that lead,
   turning in uniformly good performances, but everyone seems distant.</P>
<P>   At long last, though, the action starts, one shoot-out per plot twist.
   It's carefully thought-out, emphasizing the intellectual. Everyone
   relies on his firearms, and people who get shot tend to stay dead,
   just like in real life. The camera work is a bit shaky at times, but
   effective overall. "Ronin" also has an abundance of increasingly
   outrageous car chases, each one expertly executed, even if they strain
   credulity towards the end.</P>
<P>   Like the ronin in the movie, "Ronin" has a veiled master plan. The
   shadowy manipulator in this case is playwright David Mamet (writing
   under a pseudonym), and his influence is evident. The result is a film
   that is intelligent, sharp and worth seeing.</P>
