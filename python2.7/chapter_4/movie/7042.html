<P>While The Whole Wide World may or may not fascinate all audiences, it will
certainly intrigue those devotees of pulp fiction who revere writer Robert
E. Howard (1906-1936).</P>
<P>Texas-born Howard began to write at age 15. From the late 1920s to his
demise he was a hugely popular author of fantasy and sci-fi stories (he
called them yarns), mostly in the fanzine  Weird Tales. He created some
thirty lead characters who appeared in tale after tale. Conan, the most
famous of them, was in a record number of some 45 yarns.</P>
<P>In the 1970s pulp fiction became an object of study in American
universities for reasons that included breaks with and expansions of
established literary values, an interest in popular cultures, and in some
cases trend-seeking scholarly opportunism. Two Arnold Schwarzenegger
movies,  Conan the Barbarian  (significantly baptized  Conard le Barbare
in French) and  Conan the Destroyer  also contributed to a revival of
popular interest in Howard.</P>
<P>Novalyne Price, later Price Ellis, was from Cross Plains, in rural West
Texas, where Howard, his mother and his father (a respected M.D.) also
lived. Novalyne alternated between graduate studies and teaching to which
she was most dedicated. An aspiring writer, she was happy to meet Bob
Howard in 1934, when she was in her mid-20s. A curious relationship ensued.
It lasted under various permutations until Howard's end in 1936. She
continued college teaching, married William Ellis in 1947, was widowed in
1994 after 47 years of marriage.</P>
<P>The resurgence of interest in fantasy and science fiction caused Novalyne
to become indignant at the scholarly studies about Robert Howard and to set
out righting the wrongs with her memoir  One Who Walked Alone (1985). Her
version is the basis of the movie which was made by a first-time director
and a first-time scriptwriter.</P>
<P>The non-affair between Novalyne and Bob begins in a refreshingly un-cute
fashion which intimates that both people were originals. Soon however,
maverick Bob is revealed to be an authentic weirdo. While not a hermit, he
avoids the outside world in favor of shutting himself in his room to write
away. Material necessity does not explain this, since, even at half-cent a
word, Howard stretches out his texts, is prolific, financially well off and
lives very simply. The significant reason must be that Bob tends to escape
the real world and to sublimate his fantasies by working them into his
yarns. In a stentorian voice he reads his own fabulations and acts out his
creatures' parts.</P>
<P>He is exaggeratedly dedicated to his mother, a possessive, overly
protective woman with a life-threatening ailment. The relationship is
merely sketched out but clearly Oedipal, a tad incestuous and certainly
unhealthy.The father, out of the picture, is sad at his exclusion.</P>
<P>Novalyne and Bob have a slow-motion rapport that goes through a number of
minor adjustments that would take pages to relate. Its apex is when, many
months after their first date, they have their rather chaste first kiss.
Matters go no further. It is as if Bob's descriptions of his characters,
loaded with sexual references and often lurid, are all the sex he needs.</P>
<P>The virginal protagonists are well cast and played. Both have ordinary
faces and a sort of physical anonymity that makes Mr. D'Onofrio and Ms.
Zellwegger credible.  They are people, not actors, and they are a duo
rather than a couple.</P>
<P>My key to this odd relationship is "amitie amoureuse," (loving friendship),
an ambiguous, tricky concept that's quite common. Seen from another angle,
Bob is a mini-Pygmalion to the young woman. Surprisingly -- on the face of
it -- he gives her a book by the erotic writer Pierre Louys whose famous
The Woman and the Puppet (1898) was filmed as The Devil is a Woman,
starring Marlene Dietrich.  It would seem that Bob, in his spare time, is
trying to emancipate the lady.</P>
<P>Yet, for a progressive thinker, Bob often sounds sexist to the ears of the
1990s. I cannot remember a single instance of his calling his friend by her
first name, one that echoes futuristic fiction or medical products. He
always addresses her as "girl." "Listen, girl, "look here, girl, hey,
girl." This mode of address may grate today but was a Southern term of
endearment  for generations.</P>
<P>The depiction of Bob as neurotic, dysfunctional and a little mad occupies
center stage. To my ears, Brooklynite D'Onofrio's Texas twang sounded
authentic. Yet, setting aside the nasty cliche of some Southern accents
denoting hicks, the way Bob is written and performed does make him into
something of a bumpkin. This may not endear him to us but at least it
shatters preconceptions about what writers are like.</P>
<P>By mid-1936, the Bob and Novalyne had parted but without severing all
connections. The bad health of Bob's beloved mother had reached a point of
no return. When he heard that her end was near, he shot himself through the
head. He was 30.  Mother died 30 hours later.</P>
<P>Save for some awkward transitions, the film is a well-produced small slice
of Americana.  It must be one of the lowest low-budget  A  pictures ever
made given the tiny number of actors, locations, sets and props. Its rural
nature must have made it even cheaper than recent independent films set in
urban areas where "dressing" streets and controlling traffic add to costs.
I have the impression that the biggest expense in WWW went to recreating a
theater's marquee and renting some period automobiles.</P>
<P>To what extent the persona of Bob is genuine, or filtered by Novalyne's
memory (she was about 88 during the filming, living alone in Lafayette,
Louisiana), or fiddled with by the filmmakers, I cannot tell. The movie may
answer few questions about Robert Howard, yet it does present to us the
interesting case history of a one-of-a-kind individual.</P>
