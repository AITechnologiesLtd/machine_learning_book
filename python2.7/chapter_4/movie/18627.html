<P>To think that the two people behind the Ace Ventura movies would combine
to make a movie like this. It is true, Tom Shadyac (director of Ace
Ventura) is behind the camera, and Steve Oederkerk (director of Ace
Ventura: When Nature Calls) has written the screenplay in one of the
year's most touching films.</P>
<P>Robin Williams brings all his hilarious baggage and his dramatic side
with him playing the title character, Patch Adams, a med student who
believes that laughter is the best medicine to help his patients.
Discovering his talent to help people while admitted to a mental
institution, Patch sets his goal of becoming a doctor. Toting a fake
white overcoat to disguise himself (actually, it's a meat packing
jacket), Patch weaves in and out of hospital rooms making people laugh.
If at least a smile doesn't form across your face while watching
Williams make hospitalized children laugh, then you must be closely
related to the Grinch.</P>
<P>I'm not at all surprised to say this is an excellent movie. At the
same time, it is a long distance from being a perfect movie. But you
have to applaud a film when it has the ability to make you laugh and
cry so much in a limited 2-hour period. Despite the obviously serious
premise of Williams helping those in need, there is still plenty to
laugh about here.  One scene, in particular, will have to go on the
record shelves for one of the funniest moments in movie history. And
yet, the filmmakers never stray too far and fail to make the point
that they're attempting.</P>
<P>Robin Williams is again wonderful - heck give the man another Academy
Award. He's the heart and soul of Patch Adams, balancing the movie on
his shoulders like a scale about to tip at any moment. Amazingly, he
never lets it drop, or even budge, for that matter. He gets and
excellent supporting turn from Philip Seymour Hoffman, playing another
doctor who at times questions Patch's methods of viewing death, as
something humorous. Monica Potter is also memorable as his
self-conscious love interest, who's studying medicine herself.</P>
<P>There's lots of emotions to feel in this movie. Whether they are good or
bad, the entire project is so heartwarming you may have the urge to hug
the people sitting next to you. Patch Adams is a movie each and every
human being should see.</P>
