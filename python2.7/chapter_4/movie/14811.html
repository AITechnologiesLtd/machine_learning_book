<P>   "Savior" is a small-scale "Saving Private Ryan."  While
"Ryan"'s plot is propelled by an attempt of American soldiers
physically to save a GI from possible death in a global war,
"Savior"'s is nudged ahead by its emphasis on saving one
soldier's soul.  Filmed in the remote, exotic town of Budva,
Montenegro, "Savior" explores aspects of the Bosnian War
which began in earnest in 1992, a complex operation that
pitted three rival groups against one another.  In Predrag
"Gaga" Antonijevic's film, Serbs are at first portrayed as the
bad guys, inflicting brutal, unecessary cruelty on their
enemies, but in the interest of balance, the Croats are shown
inflicting similar malignity against Serbs and Muslims.  The
one group that appear to be victims throughout are the
Muslims, but at least one of their ethnic group are portrayed
as responsible for a senseless bombing against innocent
people patronizing a Paris cafe.  The film is an outspoken
antiwar document, more dramatized than the much honoed
"Welcome to Sarajevo" and more unadorned in form.</P>
<P>   Based on a script by Robert Orr, "Savior" utilizes primarily
the English language, using subtitles for limited moments that
Serb is spoken.  It opens in Paris as a member of an
American mission, Joshua Rose (Dennis Quaid), is enjoying a
happy moment with his beautiful wife Maria (Nastassja Kinski)
and their small son, whom he has promised to take to the
movies.  Interrupted by a uniformed American officer, he exits
the cafe just as a terrorist bomb goes off, killing his family and
all other patrons of the cafe.  Intent on immediate vengeance,
he walks angrily across the street to the local mosque and
mows down a group of probably innocent Muslims who are
praying there.  Together with his best friend Peter (Stellan
Skarsgard), he flees to Bosnia where he changes his name to
Guy, joins the foreign legion, and heads off to fight a modern
battle of Jericho.</P>
<P>   Director Antonijevic occupies the rest of the movie with
events leading to Joshua Rose's redemption from the horrible
crime he perpetrated in Paris, though at first we wonder
whether he is in fact becoming more hardened to the world,
more inured to violence.  At one point he even shoots a kid
almost point blank through telescopic sights, but as Gaga
Antonijevic soon points out, you can't trust even the most
innocent youngsters any more than Americans could have
trusted the women and children in Vietnam who appeared to
be friends.  The war, pitting the three groups against one
another, appears so brutal that few prisoners are taken and
civilians are treated with the same derision as are armed
fighting men.  </P>
<P>   "Savior" is Dennis Quaid's movie.  Nastassja Kinski gets
second billing strictly for her name, in line with an
objectionable habit of studios to prioritize casts more by
audience recognition than by actual input into their pictures. 
About all that Kinski, as Joshua's wife Maria, gets to say, is
"You promised to take him to the movies today!" when her
husband must abandon his commitment, and Stellan
Skarsgard, fast becoming a household name among
moviegoers, is billed third and yet gets little exposure this time
around.  </P>
<P>   The principal segment of "Savior" revolves around Joshua's
relationship with Vera (Natasa Ninkovic), a Serbian woman
who has become pregnant while in an enemy camp.  She is
now looked upon as a whore by her father and at first refuses
to speak to Joshua (who saved her life when a Serb
proceeded to beat and kick her) and declines as well to take
care of her newly-born infant, the product of apparent rape. 
When the little girl is orphaned and Joshua determines to
care for her, he is redeemed.</P>
<P>   Antonijevic's portrayals of violence on both sides is
wrenching, the sort of depiction that would strengthen
American resolve to support NATO strikes anywhere in the
world in which "ethnic cleansing" programs are being carried
out.  In one scene an old Muslim lady, babbling incoherently
as the sole survivor of a Serbian raid on her household, is
ruthlessly stabbed to death by a Serbian soldier who
exclaims, "Let the Muslim bitch bleed to death."  As though
these brutalities are not sufficient in themselves to evoke our
sense of horror, director Antonijevic pumps up the music
unnecessarily to manipulate audience emotions further.</P>
<P>   Perhaps the principal reason to see "Savior" is to savor
Dennis Quaid's performance as a man who has given himself
over to thoughtless revenge, a hardened individual who both
saves a helpless infant and who is himself redeemed by the
little girl.  Should we cheer his character's re-conversion to
humanity?  Perhaps.  But what about the need to inflict justice
on a man who has mercilessly murdered a group of
blameless Muslims in a Paris mosque?</P>
