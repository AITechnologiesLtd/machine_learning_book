<PRE>Psycho Beach Party
A film review by Robert Strohmeyer

<P>Not since Rocky Horror has the film world produced such a vibrant farce
of teen angst, violence, and sexual deviance.  And here comes Rocky's
comeuppance, as off-Broadway cult icon Charles Busch has scripted a work
of sheer demented brilliance in the gleefully absurd Psycho Beach Party.</P>
<P>Originally performed on the stage, Psycho Beach Party is the story of a
teenage girl who wants desperately to surf.  It's also the story of a
female cop who used to be a man.  And some homoerotic surfers.  And a
beautiful movie star who's hiding from Hollywood.  And an alcoholic
mother with no grasp of the present.  And a psychotic killer who hacks
people up for their imperfections.  And it all takes place at Malibu
Beach in 1962.</P>
<P>Visually resplendent and constantly hilarious, this film has all the
makings of a teen cult favorite.  Combining the setting concepts of
production designer Franco-Giacomo Carbone and the costuming of Camille
Jumelle with the romping weirdness of an absolutely bizarre cast, Psycho
Beach Party is a hilarious revelation of the pervasive neuroses welling
up within the generation it represents.</P>
<P>Deftly acted to a sprightly, refined camp under the direction of Robert
Lee King (Boys Life, The Disco Years), the entire cast deserves kudos. 
Particularly noteworthy is Lauren Ambrose (In & Out, Can't Hardly Wait)
as Chicklet, the 16-year-old tomboy around whom the film's drama
revolves.  Through Ambrose's performance, Chicklet comes off like a
psychotropic Gidget, the sort of girl the word "spunk" might seem to
have been invented for.  Her sudden, schizophrenic shifts from one
personality to another are refreshingly ridiculous, riding a thin wire
of sincerity and self-mockery one seldom sees in celluloid.</P>
<P>Thomas Gibson (ABC's Dharma & Greg) is funny in his role as surf-guru
Kanaka, but often appears to be left out of the joke.  Fortunately, the
rest of the cast appears to get it and keeps the story rolling through a
cavalcade of dorky music, lame plot twists, and insanely bad special
effects.  This is a movie you can laugh both with and at.</P>
<P>Charles Busch's role as Captain Monica Stark is funny and self-effacing.
Australian beauty Kimberly Davies (The Next Best Thing) gives a
performance evoking Gilligan's Island's Ginger as B-movie
starlet-in-hiding Bettina.  And keep and eye out for Splendor's Kathleen
Robertson as Rhonda the wheelchair-bound psychobitch.</P>
<P>This movie is everything it sets out to be.  Go for the cheap thrills;
stay for the surprise ending.</P>
