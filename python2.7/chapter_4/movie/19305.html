<P>I was dragged to go see this film by my better half. I do not enjoy
time-period pieces. I am not a particular fan of Minnie Driver or her acute
jawline. British films generally do not "light my fire". Having said all of
that, I quite enjoyed this film, its actors, its setting and Minnie Driver
and her goofy head.</P>
<P>PLOT:
The time is 1895, and society is run on extremely high morals. Men rule the
country and women, well, women want to marry the "perfect" men. One
particular "ideal husband" suddenly finds his career as a politician and
loving marriage in complete jeopardy, when an indiscretion from his past is
set to blackmail by a woman, in exchange for a political favor. His good
friend, who at 36 has yet to encounter a need to get married, attempts to
help him out.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Charming, delightful, comical at times, interesting at others, this film is
drenched in beautiful settings and costumes, witty dialogue, and a great
cast of actors in their top form. The plot itself is not very thick, and
does seem to finish just a little before its time, but for some very strange
reason, kept me interested, kept me listening, and kept me watching. My best
guess is that the solid performances from Julianne Moore and Rupert Everett
were at the crux of my enjoyment, as well as the rest of the consistently
entertaining cast, the moral intricacies of their day, and the well-styled
direction coming from the man behind the film, Oliver Parker. Double-props
go out to him from me, most particularly since I am generally bored stupid
during these kinds of movies, so "good show, young man!". Now while I did
enjoy watching the characters in the film jostle at the slightest
impropriety or lie told by a person, I could not help but notice the lack of
appreciation that today's society had towards any of their "simple" moral
boners.</P>
<P>I guess we have all gotten so used to the immoralities running rampant today
(The President of the United States was getting headjobs under his desk from
an intern, for God's sakes!), that the outrage supplied by the characters in
the film feel quite exaggerated. Then again, perhaps it is time for us to
begin revising our own moral agendas of the day. Then again, perhaps it is
time for me to loosen up and get back to my review of this film, instead of
rambling on about stuff that is of no consequence to this critique, per se.
Arrrumphh.....now where was I? Ah yes, despite my original misconception,
there is no gay content in this film, despite its lead actor being an openly
gay man, and the story being based on an Oscar Wilde play, another gay man.
Now there's another remark that has absolutely nothing to do with my review,
just a fact that I thought might help another sap like me, who would go in
thinking the same. Overall, a harmless little ditty is this film, with some
great performances from all involved, most particularly Julianne Moore as
the Queen Beeyatch, and Rupert Everett as the ultimate slacker bachelor.
It's funny, it's serious, there's romance, there are twists and turns, and
all in all, it is quite pleasant to look at. Fun English times.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Minnie Driver's real name is Amelia Driver. She has dated everyone from John
Cusack to Matt Damon to Josh Brolin to the drummer from the "Foo Fighters".
Up to this point, she's only been humiliatingly dumped in public by Matt
Damon. She stands 5'10".
Rupert Everett turned down the Daniel Day-Lewis role in A ROOM WITH A VIEW.
Juliane Moore's real name is Julie Anne Smith. Her father was a judge in the
Army's Judge Advocate General Corps and her mother was a psychiatric social
worker. She stands 5'5", and was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina.
Actor Jeremy Northam's first American film was the forgettable NET (5/10)
with Sandra Bullock. He was born in Cambridge, England.
Oscar Wilde's full name was Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde. This play,
AN IDEAL HUSBAND, was also produced as a TV movie in 1969 starring Jeremy
Brett (Not sure if he was gay or not :).
