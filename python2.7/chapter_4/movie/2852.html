                      Film reviews by Evelyn C. Leeper

<P>THE ARCHITECTURE OF DOOM, directed by Peter Cohen, Sweden, 1989, 1:59:
"This fascinating film takes an amazing look at the Third Reich from
the point of view of aesthetics, particularly Hitler's.  With
shockingly accurate logic and a wealth of visual material, the
filmmaker offers a strong new answer to the question of how it could
have happened in the first place."</P>
<P>     This film starts at the beginning, discussing Hitler's early
artistic ambitions and his failure to be accepted into the Art School
in Vienna.  Some of Hitler's early water colors are shown (described as
being of the picture postcard level), and indeed the fact that many of
the upper echelon of the Third Reich were failed artists in one medium
or another figures strongly in Cohen's thesis.  This rejection of their
work, it is implied, may have led to the Third Reich's rejection of
modern art and its proponents as "degenerative," "decadent," and
representative of a general decay in society.  (Sound familiar?)
Hitler declared that the Reich would save society from this decay.
This was, of course, just another way of saying that art must serve the
state.</P>
<P>     Basing his artistic goals on his three obsessions--antiquity,
Richard Wagner, and his home town of Linz--Hitler gradually expanded
his artistic philosophy into other fields.  Cleanliness, for example,
was seen as an expression of beauty and stressed to the populace.
Later, when the gassings of "undesirables" began, this could be
presented as just another effort towards cleanliness.  And Hitler
fought the war not with 20th Century objectives, but with those of
antiquity: enslave the enemy, level their cities, destroy the land.
Had he not followed this policy, Cohen suggests, the Russians might not
have opposed him so strongly.</P>
<P>     Cohen uses only archival footage to demonstrate his theses.  While
he at times seems to drift somewhat off his purpose of showing the
aesthetic basis for all of Hitler's policies, on the whole he covers
that well and has produced a very engaging and thought-provoking film.
Rating: +2 (-4 to +4).</P>
<P>MISS AMERIGUA, directed by Luis Vera, Paraguay/Sweden, 1:33:</P>
<P>     We chose this film in part because the description reminded us of
SMILE, an unfairly over-looked American film about a day in the life of
a beauty pageant.  (Vera was present at the screening and I asked him
if he had seen SMILE--he hadn't.)  MISS AMERIGUA is much more political
than SMILE, but still contains a lot of wit and character development
as well.</P>
<P>     The film begins twenty years ago, when Evaristo Morales's father
is killed by Sergeant Banderas, and Evaristo, still a young child, must
flee for his life.  It then flashes forward to the present, the day of
the big beauty pageant in Amerigua, sponsored by many companies,
including "Coca-Cola--always Coca-Cola," as the rather nerdy-looking
reporter says.</P>
<P>     The film primarily follows three of the contestants through the
day: Rosa Morales, sister of Evaristo and mistress to the now-Colonel
Banderas; Maria Descamparo, fiancee to the Colonel's son; and Carmen
Banderas, the Colonel's daughter.  We also meet Inocencio Lopez, the
reporter; Reencarnacion, the somewhat effete hairdresser; and various
other characters who will shape the day's events.</P>
<P>     Imbued with an atmosphere of magical realism and witchcraft, MISS
AMERIGUA is an entertaining film with political content (though the
latter is fairly predictable and delivered as speeches as much to the
audience as to the other characters in the film).  The contrast between
the old ways and the new is perhaps more subtle and runs as an
undercurrent trough the film, without a blanket declaration that one is
better than the other.  The English subtitles were not always perfect
("know" instead of "now," for example), but were readable, and usually
fairly accurate to the Spanish dialogue (though I caught a couple of
mistranslations, such as "damned town" for what is closer to "shitty
town").  Rating: +2 (-4 to +4).</P>
<P>     (Vera was apparently very impressed at how many people were in the
audience for a 9 AM showing, since he commented on it not only when he
spoke at the showing, but also the next day in a radio interview.)</P>
<P>L'HISTOIRE DE YUNNAN (THE STORY OF YUNNAN), directed by Zhang Nuanxin,
China, 1:37:</P>
<P>     During the Japanese occupation of Manchuria, the Japanese often
brought their families over to Manchuria with them.  At the end of the
Sino-Japanese war (the Chinese aspect of World War II) most returned to
Japan, but some found themselves left behind in China.  Such was the
fate of Jai-Teng Shuzi, a young woman who came to Japan when she as
only fifteen.  Rescued from suicide by a Chinese soldier, Xiasha, she
eventually marries him and returns with him to the remote province of
Yunnan.  How she makes a life and a home there for the next thirty-five
years forms the core of this movie.</P>
<P>     It is quite a change to see a film from and about China that is
not terribly depressing.  Yes, Shuzi undergoes hardships, but she also
has much happiness and satisfaction in her life.  She isn't sold by her
husband, beaten by her mother-in-law, tortured by the government, or
subject to many of the trials that so many recent Chinese and Chinese-
American films (e.g., THE JOY LUCK CLUB) have emphasized.  This is
perhaps all the more surprising in that this film is about a woman and
directed by a woman, and commentary on the poor position of women in
Chinese society seems to be almost a trademark of Chinese film these
days.  But THE STORY OF YUNNAN is filled with good people--not all
perfect people, but not unthinking and uncaring people either.</P>
<P>     In her press conference afterwards, Zhang emphasized that this
film was not about war, but about a woman's life, and how what's best
is not money or material objects, but love and family life.  She said
that while this was an accurate portrayal of village life of the time
period, villages are much more modern today.  Interestingly, in order
to appeal to the Taiwanese market, the lead actress (Lu Xiuling) is not
Japanese, but Taiwanese.</P>
<P>     Although there is less government support for films in China than
previously, there is apparently still the same amount of control, and
Zhang had to make some compromises, such as spending very little time
on the Cultural Revolution and showing hardly any of the love scenes,
and this in spite of the fact that the film was financed out of Hong
Kong.  (I suppose I'm a bit surprised that the government didn't seem
to object to showing a large family as a good thing.)  Zhang said there
was equality between the sexes in the film industry in China, and that
there were probably twenty to thirty women directors, but I don't think
their pictures get as wide a distribution as some of the men directors'
films do.</P>
<P>     The scenery is, of course, gorgeous, and the music by Lin Wai Zhe
quite appropriate to the feel of the movie.  See this movie if it comes
your way.  Rating: +2 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>THE REVENGE OF ITZIK FINKELSTEIN, directed by Enrique Rottenberg,
Israel, 1:23:</P>
<P>     Itzik Finkelstein is a failure at forty and just when he is about
to kill himself, help (of a sort) arrives.  It's not a deal with the
devil, but rather a deal with a monk from a secret order dedicated to
chaos and destruction.  "The Earth is a mess," Anselmo de Medici (the
monk) says.  "Lies and stupidity everywhere."  And the only way to save
the Earth is to find destroy it.  So he offers Finkelstein a chance for
him to get revenge on whichever person ruined his life.</P>
<P>     A lot of the jokes in this are old, but it's still funny,
certainly as funny as a lot of American comedies.  Though made in
Israel, there is no real Jewish content to the film.  Nevertheless, I
expect that if this plays at all in the United States, it will be in
cities with large Jewish populations.  It would appeal, I suspect
mostly to older audiences (meaning thirty and up), and is a pleasant
enough way to pass the time.  Rating: +1 (-4 to +4).</P>
<P>CARL--MY CHILDHOOD SYMPHONY, directed by Eric Clausen, Denmark, 2:05:</P>
<P>     We had originally planned to see only one film today, but then
decided to pick a couple more to fill in the day.  Our first choice was
a split choice: Mark wanted to see FEDERAL HILL and I wanted to see
FRESA Y CHOCOLATE.  unfortunately, both were sold out, so we decided on
the spur of the moment to see CARL--MY CHILDHOOD SYMPHONY instead.</P>
<P>     This is the story of the early life of Carl Nielsen, probably
Denmark's most famous classical composer.  The film starts in 1871 when
Carl is still a young child first being introduced to music, then shows
him as a slightly older boy, then joining the army to play in the
regimental band, and finally leaving the army to spend all his time
composing.</P>
<P>     The main problem with this film is that Nielsen's life seems to be
neither particularly harsh nor particularly wonderful.  In spite of
their poverty his family seems to live fairly comfortably.  There is
illness, injury, and death, but it seems to be taken as totally
ordinary, without any major angst over it.  There are lots of scenes of
beautiful scenery, and kindly, quirky villagers.  When Carl goes into
the army you figure, "Oh, now we'll see how brutalizing the army is,"
but, no, that's an easy and comfortable life for him as well.  Even his
disappointments in love don't seem to affect him very much.</P>
<P>     It's a very pretty picture, and I suppose sheds some light on
Nielsen's music, but cannot compare to other film biographies of
composers such as AMADEUS or MAHLER.  Rating: +1 (-4 to +4).</P>
<P>EL AMANTE DE LAS PELICULAS MUDAS, directed by Pablo Torre, Argentina,
1:32:</P>
<P>     I had hoped for more from this film, but it was somewhat of a
disappointment.  (It is, of course, possible that after seeing eighteen
other films, including three earlier today, I was not in as receptivea
mood as I might have been.)  This story of an aging silent film star
has strong echoes of SUNSET BOULEVARD, and also the same films of the
opening of THE JAZZ SINGER that we saw near the beginning of the
festival in JACK WARNER, THE LAST MOGUL.  Interestingly, in the Warner
documentary, they represented the start of something; here they
represent the end.  This film sounds a bit like CINEMA PARADISO: a
young boy meets a silent film star who talks about the early days of
the movies.  But this is a dark film, with far more menace and
unsettling atmosphere than CINEMA PARADISO.</P>
<P>     One of the mis-steps the film makes is in its use of music.  The
boy's mother gets a job playing the piano in the film star's funeral
home.  But she plays Schubert's "Trio for Piano, Violin, and
Violincello," and when she does, the sounds of a violin and a
violincello mysteriously appear from nowhere, and it is clear that the
piano music that is being played is not sufficient to stand on its own.
On the other hand there is good use of old film clips, as well as newly
created black-and-white footage purporting to be of the film star (as
played by Alfredo Alcon) in the Hollywood of the 1920s.  (The "fake"
footage is not as good an imitation of what the real old footage looks
like as that used in the television series "Young Indiana Jones," but
then Torre probably had neither the money nor the facilities that
Spielberg did.)</P>
<P>     For its somewhat nostalgic look at Hollywood in the era of the
silent film, this is worth seeing, but probably only for fans of that
era.  Rating: +1 (-4 to +4).</P>
