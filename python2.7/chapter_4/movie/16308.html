<P>        It's a shame when a film comes so close to getting it right.
"Patch Adams" seems to know what it's doing and where it's
headed for so much of the time that its gradual descent into
cheap, manipulative melodrama is a far greater tragedy than anything
depicted in the story itself.  As a comedy, there are plenty of
wonderful moments... but as a drama, this film needs immediate
medical attention.</P>
<P>        It's been said that laughter is the best medicine, and Hunter
"Patch" Adams (Robin Williams) apparently agrees.  A fun-loving
and mischievious (but big-hearted) scamp, Patch thinks the power
of humor and kindness are traits that can be used to facilitate
healing.  As a medical student, Patch's outlandish antics earn him
the scourn of the medical powers that be... even as this same
behavior endears him to his patients.</P>
<P>        Does that plot summary seem a little familiar?  Of course
it does: it's the same basic formula used in any number of other
Robin Williams vehicles, including "Good Morning Vietnam,"
"Dead Poets' Society," and, to a certain extent, "Good Will
Hunting."  Although the same basic storyline appears in each of
these films (kind-hearted mentor uses unorthodox methods to
reach out to others as supervisors frown), "Patch Adams" does
not reach the dramatic heights attained by its illustrious
predecessers, despite a number of attempts.  The main reason:
a complete lack of subtlety on behalf of its screenplay.  This
film is shameless in the way it assaults the audience with its
manipulative juices.  Let's take inventory: we have (1) an
abundant supply of sick, lonely children; (2) an orchestral score
that beats you over the head with the pure force of its saccharine;
(3) the death of not one but *two* characters important to our
protaganist over the course of the story, which leads us straight
into (4) a heartfelt speech delivered to a tombstone.  All this I
might be willing to overlook, but there is a moment towards the
end of the film that it so blatant and astoundingly ridiculous that
I must make mention of it.  I won't reveal the specific details,
but it involves all those sick, lonely children making an appearance
when  Patch's spirits are at their lowest ebb.  I was so moritifed
at this obvious attempt to give the audience 'warm fuzzies' that I
actually grabbed the arm of my chair to prevent myself from
walking out.</P>
<P>        If the dramatic elements of the story are disappointing,
however, the comedic moments are a lot of fun.  The film is most
successful when it deals with Adams's effervescent personality, for
it's then that Williams is allowed to do what he does better than
any other actor in Hollywood: go completely crazy.  I can't deny
that the character of Patch is a lot of fun to watch, which once
again proves my theory that when Robin Williams is having a good
time, the audience will too.  The gags are fast, frequent, and
laugh-out-loud funny, with the best moments involving Adams's
special preparations for a visiting gynecological convention, and
the hosting of a "balloon safari" in a patient's room.</P>
<P>        The stumbling blocks (and alas, there are many) show up
when the film attemps to convince us that it's a far more important
work than it actually is.  Unquestionably the story deals with
important issues, but the delivery of this material is so heavy-handed
that I felt quite put off by it.  Basking in stereotype, "Patch Adams"
paints everyone in strict black and white terms; they are either
"good," like Patch and his shy friend Truman (Daniel London), or
"bad," like Dean Walcott (Bob Gunton) and most of the other authority
figures we meet.  I don't know a single person in the real world who
is strictly one-dimensional, yet this film is overflowing with them.</P>
<P>        "Patch Adams" has flashes of creative inspiration, a message
that's worth hearing, and a tremendous performance by Robin Williams
in the title role; these three items are enough to make me
hesitatingly recommend it.  It's a shame, however, that these positive
traits are forced to fight for screen time with cardboard-like
supporting characters and countless attempts at audience manipulation.
A good drama can make an audience cry, but "Patch Adams" jams a tube
in its viewers' eyes and attempts to siphon their tears.</P>
