<P>Tom Cruise, #3 on the list of box office stars who have generated the
most income for the studios at a take of 1.51 billion dollars.  Tom
Hanks, #2 at 1.52 billion and Harrison Ford is #1 with a take of 2.08
billion dollars.  After all the years Harrison Ford has been around,
I've never seen a guy who can be so likable, even when he makes a bad
movie.  Born in 1942, his early roles in 'American Graffiti' (1973) and
'The Conversation' (1974) had him in gear as an interesting looking
character actor who was about the same age as I am now.  Then, of
course, his breakthrough film, 'Star Wars', had him engulfed in the full
context of success and the phrase, "never looking back", can rarely be
applied as strongly as in the case of Ford, who later took on the
challenge of a leading man and 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' made him a full
fledged superstar.  Thankfully, Tom Selleck's schedule made him
unavailable as Indiana Jones and stories I've read from multiple sources
said Harrison Ford was Oliver Stone's first choice to play Jim Garrison
in 'JFK'.</P>
<P>'Six Days, Seven Nights' has Ford under the direction of Ivan Reitman,
the man who made Arnold Schwarzenegger funny in such films as 'Twins',
'Kindergarten Cop' and 'Junior'.  Too bad Sylvester Stallone's voyage
into comedy was a disaster.  Maybe Reitman can do something for his
career later on.  In 'Six Days, Seven Nights', Ford looks entirely like
an everyday common man playing his role with a likable quality in a
mediocre film.  Ford plays a somewhat broken down commercial pilot who
lives in the South Pacific who meets a New York City magazine editor
(Anne Heche) and her fiancee (David Schwimmer).  He flies them to their
eventual destination and Heche and Ford later travel alone as Heche's
boss asks her to interrupt her vacation and make a 15-hour stop over in
Tahiti to do a magazine layout.</P>
<P>As they are flying, a violent storm kicks up forcing them to turn back
and upon doing so, the plane is struck by lightning and they crash land
on a deserted island in a 'Gilligan's Island' type of scenario.  Spoiled
with her bottled water, business lunches and NYC lifestyle, Heche can't
comprehend this disaster and asks Ford what he's going to do.  There are
some clever lines as Ford talks about the plane's landing gear and says:
"Sure, I'll just glue it back on".  Her sarcasm is not to be out done as
she says: "I've flown with you twice and you've crashed half the time".
Her best line is when she asks Ford if he's "One of those guys.  Those
handy guys who, when you give them a pocket knife and a Q-tip, they
build you a shopping mall."</P>
<P>Their isolation on the island puts them into an unpleasant confrontation
with some modern day pirates.  They also deal with the conflict of each
other's opposite tendencies, the humourous pratfalls of inexperience in
their situation and the unexpected situations in nature.</P>
<P>I couldn't quite get my mind around the fact that I was watching some
scenes straight out of movies such as 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance
Kid', 'Romancing the Stone' and others and while pleasant enough in
content, the movie is a one time deal you want want to re-visit and
while Ford isn't quite upstaged by his female companion, Heche is still
more believable in her role and gives a better performance.  I was
surprised.</P>
