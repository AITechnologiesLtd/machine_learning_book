<P>Indian (not Pakistani) Om Puri is one of the sub-continent's greatest 
actors as well as a major player in international cinema and TV.. He 
must have one the best-known pockmarked faces in the world, along 
with actor Robert Davi (the drug lord in the James Bond film "License 
to Kill"), and Manuel Ortega (Panama's former lord). In 1998 Puri 
attracted more world attention in "My Son, the Fanatic" in which he 
plays a Pakistani cab-driver, in England for 25 years and most 
assimilated --too much by Pakistani standards --while his only child 
reverts to Moslem fundamentalism.</P>
<P>Those roles are reversed in "East is East." Puri plays George Khan, 
who, in 1937 emigrated from Pakistan to Manchester, married 
Englishwoman (Caucasian) Ella, had seven children with her. We meet 
the tribe in the early 1970s living in Salford, a working class 
suburb  of Manchester. Ma, Pa  and some of the kids run their fish 
and chips place. Husband and wife are a loving --and sexually active 
--couple, in spite of George being bullheaded and mercurially 
autocratic, as well as often charming, especially to Ella. The 
children (six sons and one dancing daughter) have grown up in a 
spirit of  total assimilation. They may be "brown kids" to racists, 
but they feel like most other English youths of their social class.</P>
<P>When it comes to religion, all but one pious son go through the 
motions of pleasing and obeying Dad.  Ella acts just like a Muslim 
mother (but she is no convert), mediates between kids and Dad, uses 
wiles and strategies to keep the peace and is lovable totally but not 
soupily.</P>
<P>The children are so westernized that when Dad's away they consume 
gluttonously ham and sausages. When Dad's head is turned, one son 
flirts (or more?) with a neighbor's blonde daughter and most of the 
siblings do "unacceptable" things.</P>
<P>Matters, however, really come to a head when the senior son is about 
to wed a Pakistani belle in an arranged marriage. At the start of the 
ceremony, the young groom, in a switch from Hollywood movies about 
brides fleeing the altar, runs away, and off.</P>
<P>We are left wondering a bit about the earlier years of the Khan 
family when George gets to center stage as a newborn  Muslim. 
Pakistanis and Brits seem to co-exist quite well. although racism 
does lurk in the background. And reverse racism too.  But there's no 
Paki-bashing by hooligans, no egregious discrimination. Perhaps 
because those are Enoch Powell years when the racist. politician 
wages war on immigration, perhaps too because of a mid-life crisis, 
George reacts with increased traditionalism of which the most acute 
symptom is his strong desire is arranged marriage for sons 2 and 3.</P>
<P>Thereby hang the most comical events of the film, in fact 
transitions from benevolent irony to farce and to near-screwball 
comedy. I will give no details, not even clues as to the developments.</P>
<P>"East is East" is a grand little movie, funny yet also pathetic, 
amusing but also touching on very serious matters regarding 
immigration, the many faces and degrees of assimilation or 
non-assimilation, mixed-marriages, the old and the new, and much else 
of crucial importance to the brown or white or black or whatever 
inhabitants of the British Isles.</P>
<P>The source play was a major hit in England, and so was the movie. The 
British Film Academy gave it several nominations, the "Evening 
Standard" and the London Film Critics voted it as Best British Film 
of the Year. It was Dublin-born Director Damien O'Donnell's first 
feature and the play (1996) as well as the film-script, both firsts 
by actor-turned-writer Ayub Khan were highly honored in the UK and 
the Continent.</P>
<P>The acting is impeccable, all the more so since many of the players 
are also newcomers. The Khan children, by the way, are all but one of 
mixed parentage and all felt in familiar territory. Not so director 
O'Donnell, an Irishman who steeped himself in the cultures of 
Pakistanis in the UK as well as of England in the 1970s -- with 
wonderful success.</P>
<P>The movie is knowledgeably and intelligently built, with credibility 
and authenticity, a number of un-telegraphed surprises (from a 
strange circumcision to a barber's chair) and a heartfelt feeling for 
all involved, including the dictatorial George, whose likable sides 
survive his imperiousness.</P>
<P>My single caveat comes from the sometimes hard to catch in full some 
bits of dialogue spoken in (there must be a term for it but I don't 
know it) working-class English. But I had no problem with some of the 
Arabic formulas and courtesies.</P>
