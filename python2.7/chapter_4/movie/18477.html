<P>An honest, passionate, and ultimately mysterious note is the subject of 
Peter Ho-Sun Chan's romantic comedy-drama, "The Love Letter," based upon 
the novel by Cathleen Schine. There's a lot to like here, and even 
though it is only the start of the big summer movie season, it was nice 
to sit back, relax, and watch a movie about realistic people; it's just 
too bad the story surrounding the characters comes off as a mere 
contrivance, and that the supporting cast, all wonderful actors, are 
criminally wasted.</P>
<P>Helen MacFarquhar (Kate Capshaw) is a 40-ish single mother who lives in 
the quaint New England town with the dreamy title, Loblolly By The Sea. 
The fact that she has a young daughter is completely pointless to the 
film, since she is shipped away to summer camp during the opening 
credits to never be seen again. Helen works at one of those cute little 
bookstores that you only see in the movies; the kind that is constantly 
swarming with employees, but never has one customer. Maybe it's because 
the town is so small, or maybe it's because the residents are 
illiterate, or not big readers. Either way, how could they have the 
money to keep the shop in business? Anyway, one day Helen finds a love 
letter wedged between the cushions of a couch, and immediately believes 
that someone has written it for her. As she walks around the town 
daydreaming of all of the possible authors, she soon narrows down the 
list to George (Tom Selleck), a recently divorced father who has been 
her life-long friend, or Johnny (Tom Everett Scott), a 20-year-old 
college student working at the bookstore for the summer, who finds the 
note himself and believes it is from Helen. Things grow more complicated 
when Helen's best friend, Janet (Ellen DeGeneres), discovers the letter 
and suspects it to be directed for her, while Helen starts to doubt her 
blossoming relationship with the much-younger Johnny and sets her sights 
on the more mature, lonely George.</P>
<P>"The Love Letter" is a very well-intentioned and mildly entertaining 
distraction from life, but at a too-short 88-minutes, the distraction is 
not nearly long enough, and is unnecessarily slight. The screenplay, 
written by Maria Maggenti, is fine with what it has, but desperately 
needs more meat to it, as the movie stubbornly centers directly on 
Helen, while the rest of the intriguing characters are more or less 
pushed to the wayside. Still, there are a lot of nice moments and a 
subtle deeper meaning that shines through with a quote that appears on 
the bookstore's chalkboard late in the film. Although the writer of the 
love letter is eventually discovered, the movie probably didn't even 
need to resolve such a thing, as the major thread running through the 
film is that of Helen's self-discoveries about herself, and her life. It 
was also a pleasant change of pace to include a conclusion that doesn't 
turn out quite as you might predict, but that is stronger because of its 
honesty.</P>
<P>Kate Capshaw, recently seen in numerous indie films ("The Locusts," "The 
Alarmists"), jumped onto the scene in 1984's rousing adventure, "Indiana 
Jones and the Temple of Doom" (where she met a guy named Spielberg and 
married him), but "The Love Letter" is her first major film vehicle in a 
long time. I like her, and yet it's funny how so many movies choose the 
most uninteresting character to be the center. This is exactly what 
happens in "The Love Letter," as all of the characters around her are 
more original, starting with Tom Everett Scott, as the young man of 
Helen's desires. Scott has stumbled lately in such mediocre fare as "An 
American Werewolf in Paris" and "Dead Man on Campus," but he has found a 
better role here. Playing off of him splendidly is Julianne Nicholson, a 
young woman closer to his age who has strong feelings for him, even 
though he's too concerned with Helen to really process it. But the 
absolute bright spot in the cast is Ellen DeGeneres, who is so very good 
in everything she's in that, if I were to make a movie, she'd be the 
first one I'd cast. She is the picture's comic highlight (as usual), but 
is not merely replaying her other characters, and has a serious scene 
with Capshaw that is perhaps the most powerful moment in the film. 
Meanwhile, Blythe Danner and Gloria Stuart (her first role since 
"Titanic") briefly appear as Helen's mother and grandmother, but have 
nothing to do, particularly Stuart, one of the sweetest old ladies I've 
ever set eyes upon. It's a real shame she was put in such a throwaway 
role, but does garner a few laughs in only her three scenes.</P>
<P>Like Loblolly By The Sea, "The Love Letter" is an enjoyable enough way 
to spend an hour and a half, but doesn't end up having much to offer in 
the way of substance. On Oprah this week, Capshaw said that when she 
read the novel from which this adaptation stems from, she fell in love 
with the idea of it becoming a motion picture and immediately joined on 
as star and producer (it probably didn't hurt that she is married to Mr. 
Dreamworks SKG). Either the book must have been infinitely superior, or 
Capshaw should have definately held out for a better project.</P>
