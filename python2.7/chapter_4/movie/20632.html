<P>Susan Granger's review of "BLUE STREAK" (Columbia Pictures)</P>
<P>         Martin Lawrence reminds me of Jerry Lewis with his silly
antics in this action comedy and of Eddie Murphy with his fast-talking
glibness. Lawrence plays a jewel thief who, after spending two years
in prison, discovers that the under-construction building in whose air
duct he stashed a $20 million diamond is now the 37th L.A. Police
Precinct.  Undaunted by this ironic stroke of bad luck - and unable to
infiltrate the crime unit disguised as a buck-toothed pizza delivery
man - the ex-con concocts an outrageous plan to impersonate a cop so
that he can gain entrance, locate and retrieve the gem in a matter of
hours. But, as fate and the screenwriters would have it, he
inadvertently captures an escaping convict (Dave
Chappelle). Everything that could go wrong does go wrong, and so it
goes...</P>
<P>Director Les Mayfield ("Encino Man") attempts to keep the pace
fast but, despite lots of shtick, the necessary energy just isn't
there. He also relies heavily on Martin Lawrence to carry the vehicle
as an action hero which is a mistake. There's lots of action - sound
and fury - but it signifies very little. Now, if you're a real Martin
Lawrence fan, devoted to his raw, edgy stand-up comedy, and
sympathetic after his recent collapse while jogging, I don't want to
discourage you. It's just that the plot is predictable and has too
many holes in it to suspend disbelief - besides, you're in on the joke
from the beginning. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Blue
Streak" is a manic, formulaic 4. I'd advise you to go to a bargain
matinee or wait for the video.</P>
