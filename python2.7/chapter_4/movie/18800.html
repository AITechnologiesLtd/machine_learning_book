<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
2 and a half stars</P>
<P>Recently cinema looked at what happened when an ordinary man rose to
instant stardom in EdTV, and in Notting Hill the premise is almost
reversed: what happens when a man whose mother barely remembers his name
becomes romantically involved with the world's most famous actress?
Surprising, not much.  Richard Curtis, who has established himself as a
fine comedy writer after Four Weddings and a Funeral and his work in
Blackadder and Mr. Bean, penned this gentle romantic comedy that takes
few risks and lacks a steady pace.  The highlights (and there are many)
of the picture do not come from Roger Michell's glossy direction, but
rather Curtis' sense of what type of humor works and when.</P>
<P>Hugh Grant plays William Thacker, owner of a travel bookstore in Notting
Hill, described as a "small village in the middle of a city."  He lives
with the "roommate from hell," Spike (Rhys Ifans), a lovable but
repulsive man who'd just as soon eat mayonnaise as he would yogurt.
Thacker lives a quiet, reasonably lonely life until our woman in
question, Anna Scott (Julia Roberts), walks into his shop and buys a
book.  Through a lucky coincidence (actually, there's quite a few in
this film), the two bump into each other again (literally), and love is,
um, in the air.  Of course, Thacker experiences a few problems with
dating the world's hottest star, ranging from a Hollywood boyfriend to
the paparazzi.</P>
<P>Hugh Grant reprises the style of acting that made his rise to fame
formidable.  His gentleman-like manners coupled with humorous dialogue
is an agreeable combination, and Grant, whose reputation has suffered
somewhat over the last few years (remember that incident with a
prostitute, anyone?) would be well advised to choose more roles of this
nature.  Julia Roberts really plays Julia Roberts, and does so with such
a loud sense of fame that she becomes a little irritating.  A cleverer
move would have been to cast Roberts' character to a relative unknown.
This would enable Anna Scott's fame to feel more original and fresh,
rather than forced.   I'm convinced that Roger Michell took the easy way
out.</P>
<P>But there's still plenty of things to like in Notting Hill, none of
which are quite as refreshing as the film's supporting characters.
William Thacker's group of friends are a delightful bunch.  One of them
fails to recognize Scott and, upon hearing that she is an actor,
explains that it is a low-paying profession ("So how much did you make
from your last film?" "Fifteen million.").  There's even a scene near
the end that positions most of them in a car, racing against time, all
screaming and screeching.  The driver stops the car and exclaims, "James
Bond never had to put up with this shit!"  Once again, Richard Curtis'
comedic sense is right on.</P>
<P>Although Notting Hill boasts fun characters and funny jokes (nowadays
its quite rare to find a romantic comedy that's actually funny), at its
heart is a relationship that's almost passionless.  I suspect that this
is largely due to Michell's direction, which seems to imply the romance
rather than develop it.  I got the sense that perhaps the best romantic
parts of Notting Hill were left on the editing room floor, or perhaps
they just weren't there to begin with.  Either way, Grant's
performance - though very enjoyable to watch - doesn't help.  He must
have something against revealing any emotion in his dialogue.  But
besides this rather major fault, let me stress again that Notting Hill
is a pleasing and often involving film.  And, if you can, I suggest that
you duck out of the cinema five minutes early to avoid a dreadful final
reel.</P>
