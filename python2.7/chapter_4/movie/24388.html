<PRE>Essex Boys - Review</PRE>
<P>by Julie Kimpton and Heather Williams</P>
<PRE>05 April 2000</PRE>
<P>It looks like scissors cutting a light silk curtain, but somehow you
know it must be a knife ripping through flesh. With the cloying agony of
fingernails clawing down a blackboard, as soon as the opening titles hit
the screen, you know that Essex Boys is going to be no easy ride.</P>
<P>Essex Boys is a snapshot of life in the Essex underworld, narrated by
Billy Reynolds (Charlie Creed-Miles), a young taxi driver who is hired
by John Dyke (Tom Wilkinson) as a driver for Jason Locke (Sean Bean), a
local villain who has just been released from a five year prison
sentence.</P>
<P>Billy is a wannabe on the periphery of Locke's shady world. He has
carried out small delivery jobs for Dyke in the past with no questions
asked, and is impressed by the glamour of Locke's lifestyle. He's
envious of the big cars, the money, and - absurdly - that he manages to
get into nightclubs without queuing.</P>
<P>This is the life that Billy yearns after. This is what he wants. But he
soon sees that it goes way beyond that. His naive ideals of a glamorous
lifestyle are quickly shattered as he realizes he's in way too deep -
and that being part of Locke's circle has a very uncompromising
downside.</P>
<P>Jason Locke is a man with absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever.</P>
<P>Unflinching in its dialogue and depiction, Essex Boys is a brilliantly
acted portrayal of the lives of a disparate group of villains who form
the underbelly of Essex society. Occasionally, this uncompromising
inside look makes the hairs on the back of your neck prickle. At times,
it is not an easy film to watch, and there are scenes of frighteningly
realistic violence. There are moments when Sean Bean's character is
relentless in his brutality, letting fly with a viciousness that is
almost palpable.</P>
<P>"Jason is a volatile time-bomb just waiting to go off," Sean says. "He's
headstrong and very temperamental. He will fly off the handle without
notice, and it's this unpredictability that makes him very dangerous to
be around."</P>
<P>Too true. His performance was disturbingly believable.</P>
<P>Director Terry Winsor adds, "The violence is pretty real, and it's not
done for fun."</P>
<P>Terry Winsor's direction is a masterpiece. He has equated it to Martin
Scorsese's Goodfellas, and there will inevitably be comparisons with
Gary Oldman's recent Nil by Mouth. But unlike the factual, documentary
style of Scorsese's film, or the fly-on-the-wall approach of Oldman,
Winsor and co-writer-producer Geoff Pope have gone for a style that is
largely driven by narrative.</P>
<P>Sean has worked with Winsor before, in Fools Gold, and seems to work
well with his style of direction. Winsor said that the film was not
written with particular cast members in mind, but then he backtracks
somewhat: "I kind of had Sean at the back of my mind as I'd worked with
him before. There was always something that seemed to come back to the
qualities that he could offer, and then it became a natural process to
offer the part to him."</P>
<P>Those who remember Sean Bean only from roles such as Mellors, the
gamekeeper in Lady Chatterley, and Sharpe, where he plays the hero,
famous for getting out of his clothes and into bed with the ladies,
might be disappointed by Essex Boys. But fans of Sean Bean (an actor of
consummate skill and considerable range - witness Caravaggio, The Field
and Clarissa) will be stunned by his performance as the volatile, brutal
Locke.</P>
<P>The relationship between Jason Locke and his wife Lisa (Alex Kingston)
is an important part of the plot, and their interaction is explored in
some depth. Lisa is a very strong character; she has to be, to survive
in Locke's world. Several scenes involve Lisa being violently assaulted
by Locke, who is paranoid that she has "played away" during his time
inside.</P>
<P>Alex Kingston was understandably nervous about filming some of these
scenes, but found that working with Sean made the process easier. "I'm
an instinctive actress, and watching Sean he seems to be an instinctive
actor too. He's very at home physically with his body. We seemed to work
together well as a couple - we were well matched."</P>
<P>All the characterisations in the film are excellently scripted, and
written with considerable depth. Charlie Creed-Miles plays Billy with
aplomb, his naive desire to get "in" with the villains leading him to
carry out ever more brutal acts, which he continually tries to explain
away. One of the most difficult characters to assess is that of Dyke
(Tom Wilkinson) - you never quite feel you have got his full measure.
Wilkinson skilfully brings out these incongruities in his portrayal of
Dyke as a seemingly soft-touch with a steely core.</P>
<P>The film was inspired by a real life incident in which police found
three men shot dead in a Range Rover. However, the writers are keen to
stress that is a fictional study of the events leading to that night.
"Those are real people with real families," Pope says, "so we didn't
want to make it that story."</P>
<P>In fact, this could have been any place, at any time; but armed with
their inspiration, the writers adapted their ideas to an Essex setting,
where camera shots of boggy marshes and spreading mud flats lend
themselves wonderfully to an atmosphere which at times is exceptionally
bleak.</P>
<P>The result is a fast-moving story with a plot that, at first, seems to
follow the standard gangster movie trail of heist and subsequent cross
and double cross.</P>
<P>But there are unexpected twists and stings in the tail which confound us
as much as they seem to confound Billy, our guide though this nightmare
world.</P>
<P>A couple of moments are reminiscent of Michael Caine's narrative to
camera in Alfie, and though Essex Boys is infinitely darker in approach,
the film's cynical portrait of street life is just as observant. Like
Alfie, Billy addresses us directly, and casually, as though this might
be familiar ground to us. We've been away for a while and just need to
catch up with what's been going on. His narrative is a useful scripting
tool, which links the various parts of the film together and furthers
the storyline in a very effective way.</P>
<P>Seeing things from Billy's point of view helps us to understand what
life in his situation would be like...the uncertainty, the horrors, the
pain and the laughter.</P>
<P>And there is a lot of humour in Essex Boys. It's black humour - to match
the tone of the film - but it's there and it makes you laugh, wryly, at
the fact that these characters still have time for levity in their
lives.</P>
<P>A large proportion of the film's scenes were shot at night, but this
isn't a problem. The results are excellent - we don't have to peer into
the darkness to see what is happening or bend our heads forward to hear
what is being said. The dialogue is completely understandable; the
action is well-lit and clear.</P>
<P>Confession time: this was not a film, given other circumstances, that we
would have chosen to go and see. It's not "our" type of film. We would
have prejudged it as a Big Mistake.</P>
<P>I'm glad to say we were very, very wrong. Essex Boys is a gripping,
compelling story. We need to know what is going to happen to each of the
characters: we feel compelled to locate the victims, but we're thwarted
at every turn, as each seemingly innocent personality reveals a new and
ever more tainted layer.</P>
<P>Essex Boys is a film about betrayal. Ultimately, everyone betrays
someone, and, in turn, they are also betrayed. Life in this underworld
has no Hollywood-style happy endings; there are no morality tale rules
that dictate good must always triumph over evil.</P>
<P>"Pete says it's good. But then Pete always says it's good," several
presumed acquaintances of Essex Boys' PR guru were overheard remarking
before the film screening began.</P>
<P>Don't worry, Pete: this time you were perfectly right. This is a film
which deserves to be a huge success.</P>
<P>Because the miracle of Essex Boys is that you do actually care what
happens to such irredeemably abominable characters. Because, in the end,
they're victims - all of them.</P>
