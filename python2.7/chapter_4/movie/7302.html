<PRE>                                 THE SAINT
                       A film review by Michael Redman
                        Copyright 1997 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Val Kilmer's super spy for hire is one part James Bond and one part
"Fletch" (a decidedly mediocre Chevy Chase film based on an excellent
detective book series) and doesn't succeed as well as even the Chase
disaster.</P>
<P>A master of disguise with a habit of using the names of Catholic saints,
Simon Templar is hired by a Russian crime boss turned politician to find
the secret of cold fusion. In order to do so, he must romance Emma
Russell (an uninteresting and apparently uninterested Elisabeth Shue),
the good doctor with the secret. Although not a part of his plan, he
falls in love with her.</P>
<P>Someone has stolen all of the fuel oil in Moscow and whoever comes up
with a new energy source will rule the country. If you can swallow that
far-fetched plot device, perhaps you'll go along with the rest of the
film. I found almost everything that happens equally implausible.</P>
<P>Kilmer can be a first-rate actor, but it doesn't happen here. The scenes
of his Fabio-inspired long-haired naked lounging are difficult to take
seriously. In all fairness, the two women that I spoke to after the
movie both loved the film...but then they had serious Val Kilmer
blinders on.</P>
