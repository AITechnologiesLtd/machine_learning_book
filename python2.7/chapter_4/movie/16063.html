<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
4 stars</P>
<P>Perhaps for the first time in Hollywood history, Dreamworks has made the
seemingly impossible: an adult animated musical.  Anyone who says that
The Prince of Egypt is not a rare find is either an extreme pessimist or
a Disney employee; this film is a breakthrough for animation, in terms
of writing and conveying a potentially controversial screenplay and
creating breath taking visuals.</P>
<P>In fact, Dreamworks went to great measures to make sure that The Prince
of Egypt would not be a victim of religious criticism for not following
the book of Exodus accurately.  Drafts of the script were approved by
religious leaders, and there is even text before the film explaining
that "artistic license" must be taken into account.  Quite miraculously,
for a story based on Christian text, The Prince of Egypt does not
preach, bore or intimidate.  Against all odds, this is the best animated
film of 1998, and one of my personal favorites of the last few years
(ranking with The Hunchback of Notre Damn and Batman: Mask of the
Phantasm).</P>
<P>The highlight of Prince of Egypt is the dynamic chemistry between its
two crucial characters; men who are brothers in their hearts but have
very different futures ahead of them.  One is Rameses (voice of Ralph
Fiennes), the son of Pharaoh (Patrick Stewart), who was born destined to
rule Egypt.  The other is Moses (Val Kilmer), who was adopted by the
Pharaoh's wife after he was found floating down a river as a baby, in
the time that Pharaoh ordered all Hebrew infants to be killed.  By the
time that Moses realizes that he is a Hebrew - the same people who are
slaves to Pharaoh - he is a young man and is chosen by God to lead his
people out of slavery.</P>
<P>That's quite a story for a "family film" to handle.  In my Babe: Pig in
the City review I stated that some scenes would be distressing for
children to watch, and it seems only fair that I issue a similar warning
in regards to The Prince of Egypt. This film depicts the harassment of
the Hebrew people openly and vividly, but whereas Babe often seemed like
nothing more than a freak show, The Prince of Egypt is honest about its
setting and doesn't pretend that everything is harmless and innocent.
As Moses battles Rameses for the Hebrew's freedom towards the film's
conclusion, we can understand what he is fighting for and at the same
time what he is missing out on - the life of a prince compared to the
life of a true leader.</P>
<P>Visually, The Prince of Egypt is a triumph.  Just as Antz and A Bug's
Life had unique styles of animation, so does this.  Some moments of the
film go beyond just being visually impressive; they are enchanting and
sensational.  These scenes include Moses' encounter with God (in the
form of a burning bush) and the parting of the Red Sea (which alone took
animators over two years of work to complete).  However terrific the
visuals may be, though, is nothing compared to the potency of the
screenplay.  I haven't been this impressed by a script since The Truman
Show, and this mesmerized by visuals since What Dreams May Come.</P>
<P>Whilst there are (thankfully) no singing animals in The Prince of Egypt,
it is very much a musical.  If you can imagine a biblical story brought
to life with the power of, say, Les Miserables, you may have a
reasonable idea of what this is like.   Some of the featured songs are
powerful and moving - such as "Deliver Us," which is performed Ofra Haza
and Eden Riegel, and "When You Believe," performed by Mariah Carey and
Whitney Houston.  These songs are great, and help make the film
accessible for all ages.</P>
<P>I can honestly say that while watching The Prince of Egypt, I never
really noticed the talented array of voices until I looked at the
credits.  Val Kilmer and Ralph Fiennes are sensational in the two
hardest parts, but everybody is impressive.  This is the first animated
film I have seen in which I not only forgot about its voices, I often
forgot that it was animated.  Which is strange, since the color and life
that the animation generates is unlike anything that a live action film
could create.    As impressive as The Ten Commandments was, The Prince
of Egypt is both an epic and a spectacle, packaged as a mainstream and
accessible film by musical numbers and illustrious animation.  This is
cinema in its grandest form, combining an aged but unforgettable tale
with breath-taking visual techniques.</P>
