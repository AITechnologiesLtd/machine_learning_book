<PRE>Rating: * * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Rated R for violence and gore, and for language.</P>
<P>Starring: Bill Pullman, Oliver Platt, Bridget Fonda.</P>
<P>'Lake Placid' is definately not your typical creature attacking people movie,
ok so maybe it is, but this one is enjoyable, and clever. Actually it comes off
more of a comedy than a horror film. Well the ending is kinda scary, but in
most horror/comedies they are. I will admit that 'Lake Placid' isn't an Oscar
Worthy film, but it does come off as an inventive movie that is original and
funny.</P>
<P>Bridget Fonda plays a palentologist who after finding out her boyfriend is
cheating, is forced to go to Lake Placid and investigate a tooth, after a man
is bit in half. She gets there but really doesn't understand why she is there.
Bill Pullman plays a man also investigating what happened, along with the
sherriff and a rich croc obsessed man, they go out and find what is going on.
What they find though isn't great. A huge and I mean huge crocodile is living
in Lake Placid, over 150 years old, he has migrated here for who knows why. </P>
<P>They have to fight against the croc and try to trap him so they can study him
and see where he came from. Betty White plays a woman who lives on the shores
of Lake Placid, and well you'll have to see the movie to find out. Her
character is very funny and foul-mouthed, which is surprising to hear Betty
spew words and phrases that are pretty bad, but funny. </P>
<P>To me the movie came off as a spoof of Jaws. With the opening sequence, and
some others, it is not original and is. When you watch this movie, you
definately notice the smartness and cleverness of it. David E. Kelly who is the
mastermind of The Practice and Ally McBeal, writes this movie with ease and
surprisingly does a great job. The characters have smartmouths, two foul, and
some great one-liners. </P>
<P>But believe me, don't take 'Lake Placid' too seriously or you won't like it.
But it is a movie that can be enjoyed as a fun 'popcorn' type movie. But I
guess it rates above the 'popcorn' rating. Sit back, watch the movie, laugh,
scream, and whatever you want. Even though the movie is R, and I put violence
and gore. There's really not that much gore, but what there is might seem kinda
gross to some. 'Lake Placid' is a smart, clever, funny, and scary movie that I
enjoyed and I think you will too.</P>
