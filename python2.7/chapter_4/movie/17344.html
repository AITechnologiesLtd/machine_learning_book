<P>    "Personal Note: When I was a kid my mother told me not to stare into the
sun, so when I was six, I did.  The doctor's didn't know if my eyes would
ever heal.  I was scared, alone in that darkness, but slowly, light began to
creep through the bandages. But something in me changed that day.  That day
I had my first headache."</P>
<P>    Thus bgegins Darren Aronofsky's 1998 independent trek into the surreal
Pi, an incredibly complex and ambigous film filled with both incredible
style and subtance.  To get an idea of the director in case you have never
seen him before, imagine the cinematography originality of Jim Jarmush's
Stranger than Paradise mixed with the perfect dialouge of Kevin Smith's
Clerks and the bizarre and cryptic storyline of David Lynch's Eraserhead.
Any surprise that all three of the aforementioned films are black and white?
It shouldn't be.  Pi uses an 8mm for the majority of its duration and film
in a grainy black and white, giving the impression that you are watching a
nightmare.</P>
<P>    The first large challenge of reviewing this throughly intriguing movie
is describing its plot.  Max Cohen (Sean Guilette) is a brilliant number
theorist.  He has three assumptions about the universe, one of which is that
all things have an underlying pattern, an order.  The hypothesis that he
creates out of this is that he can predict anything, given enough variables
and knowing the underlying pattern.  His place to test this hypothesis: the
stock market.  In his search for answers in the stock market, he discovers a
216-digit number that seems to be the key to it all: it predicts Black
Monday.  Jewish mystics (Ben Shenkman) believe it to be the real name of
God.  Market manipulators (Pamela Hart) believe it to be the key to a
fortune.  A brillaint mathematician (Sol (Mark Margolis)) believes it to be
a bug caused when a computer becomes conscious in the instants before it
dies.  Max is quickly launched into a world so paranoid it makes the
Orwelian works of Andrew Niccol look safe.</P>
<P>    Max is also plauged by headaches.  These headaches, strong enough to
force him unconscious at regular intervals, have him taking a cocktail of
painkillers in order to subdue.  As he creeps closer and closer to the
answer, the headaches increase in their intensity.</P>
<P>    I think the best way to interperet this massively cryptic film would be
as a single man's search for peace.  Through the movie, Max is gripped by a
violent obsession with numbers and a complete phobia of social interaction.
He constantly shuns the advances of his neighbor Devi (Samai Shoaib).  He
finds himself unable to take a break from anything and, as a consequence,
finds himself inside of a complete nightmare.  The only way to get away from
this nightmare is to give up the one thing that has been his lifelong
passion: numbers.
The suspense of the film is helped along with an elecritc score by Clint
Mansell, a soundtrack that keeps you on the edge with its razor-sharp notes.
Also helping is the cinematographer Matthew Libatique, who gives us an
infectious feeling of paranoia with the black and white film and the
constant use of an unsteady camera to show the fast movement of Max.</P>
<P>    The film, although making numerous references to number theory, is
fairly easy to understand with no mathematical knowledge: not to say that it
doesn't help to know how to add and subtract.  What is difficult is to view
this film without a mind seeking to be intrigued, because, if you don't want
intrigue, you shouldn't be watching Pi.</P>
