<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>I'm a cat lover by nature. The only pets I've ever kept have been cats,
and I have absolutely no interest in owning a dog. Sure, I like dogs in
general (well, some dogs), and I can appreciate the pleasure that others
derive from them. But I've never comprehended the more bizarre extremes
that dog owners can sometimes go to: dressing them up, trimming them in
bizarre patterns, that kind of thing. And I definitely don't understand
dog shows.</P>
<P>Christopher Guest ("This Is Spinal Tap") seems to share my perplexity. His
new mockumentary "Best In Show" is a delicious parody of the dog show,
complete with eccentric competitors, bombastic hosts, and even
idiosyncratic pets. It is not a scathing attack on dog shows -- the movie
is too gentle and bemused for that -- but it certainly has a lot of fun at
their expense.</P>
<P>Guest follows several dog owners as they make their way to the Mayflower
Kennel Club's annual show in Philadelphia. None of them are entirely
normal. There's Guest himself who portrays Harlan Pepper, the backwards
proprietor of a backwoods fishing gear store. Harlan's mood seems
perfectly matched by his faithful bloodhound, and it comes as little
surprise that his world is comprised of very little beyond his dog and his
store.</P>
<P>Michael Hitchcock and Parker Posey play Hamilton and Meg Swan, a couple
whose pooch seems to have developed a severe case of depression. Meg
thinks it's because the dog walked in on them having sex, but maybe it's
because the two high-strung individuals are perpetually stuck in
hypertense mode. (Tellingly, they first saw each other at Starbucks -- not
the same Starbucks, of course, but two Starbuckses across the street from
each other). One of the movie's best scenes has Posey, desperate for a toy
to replace their dog's missing stuffed bee, entering a pet store and
irrationally ranting against the clerk (Hiro Kanagawa) because, although
he has several similar toys, he doesn't actually stock a plush bee. When
Posey finally picks a toy at random, the clerk is in disbelief: she has
successfully chosen the least bee-like toy in the store.</P>
<P>Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara are Gerry and Cookie Fleck, a pair of
middle-aged losers. Gerry has two left feet -- literally -- while Cookie
seems to be intimately familiar with virtually every man on the dog
show circuit. The Flecks are completely obsessed with their dog, to the
extent of even composing songs (really, really awful songs) in his honour.</P>
<P>Then there's Michael McKean and John Michael Higgins as homosexual twosome
Stefan Vanderhoof and Scott Donlan. Scott is flamingly gay and loving it,
while Stefan is more of a sophisticate. It's telling that, of all the
couples in the movie, theirs is probably the most stable relationship.
Scott's prance when walking their shih tzu around the convention floor is
perfect: he's as much on display as the dog.</P>
<P>Jennifer Coolidge plays Sheri Ann Ward Cabot, the voluptuous wife of an
aged and sickly millionaire. One early scene sees Sheri Ann painfully
trying to provide examples of substance in their marriage. She ends up
asserting that they share great conversation, and equally valuable
"We could not talk or talk forever and still find things to not talk
about," she explains. Sheri Ann is the owner of a toy poodle (surely the
most nauseating canine in existence) which has won best in show at the
Mayflower two years running, and is competing for a third win. Assisting
Sheri Ann is professional trainer Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch), who seems
as interested in Sheri Ann as she is in the dog itself.</P>
<P>Rounding out the principal cast are Fred Willard and Jim Piddock, who
portray the television commentators for the dog show, Buck Laughlin and
Trevor Beckwith. Buck is a loud, vapid man in the grand tradition of
American football announcers; he obviously knows as much about dogs as he
does quantum physics. Beckwith is his long-suffering sidekick, who
desperately tries to steer Buck back on-topic when he starts rambling
about dressing the dogs up in Sherlock Holmes outfits to improve their
chances.</P>
<P>With the feel of something that has been at least partly improvised, "Best
In Show" manages to maintain a spontaneous feel while still setting up a
number of hilarious set pieces. Guest is equally adept at capturing
smaller comedy moments, emphasising the strange habits and obsessions
which are brought out during events like these. Consider the hotel manager
(Ed Begley Jr) who offers a learned discourse on the topic of what 
cleaning agents are best for the variety of pet accidents he encounters.
On its own, it's a dry but reasonable topic; put into the context of "Best
In Show", its faint absurdity becomes evident.</P>
<P>"Best In Show" does lose its way somewhat around the middle of the film,
as the comic potential of the characters on their own seems to near
exhaustion. Fortunately, just as ennui starts to creep into the
proceedings, we move from the preliminaries into the dog show itself,
which revitalises the film. In particular, the introduction of the double
act of Willard and Piddock is wonderful, and their commentary is amongst
the picture's highlights.</P>
<P>Several of the actors also stand out, particularly Posey and Higgins, who
attack their roles with great gusto. On the other hand, a couple of
characters never quite seem to find their way; McKean's Stefan, for
example, lives in the shadow of the outlandish Scott, and surprisingly
Guest's own Harlan Pepper is a man who always seems to be building up to
a punchline but never actually gets there.</P>
<P>All the same, there is a lot to recommend in "Best In Show". Given his
success here, I'd love to see Guest tackle something which attracts
similar levels of obsession and hysteria in the future. If Guest let loose
at a dog show is this funny, I can only imagine the hilarity which would
ensue should he train his sights on, say, a science-fiction convention...</P>
