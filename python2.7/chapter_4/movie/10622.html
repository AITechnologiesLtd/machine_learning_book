<PRE>The Endless Summer
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1998 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>*** (out of 4) Brown loves to surf. It was his dream to spend one year
surfing, switching hemispheres as the seasons changed, and circling the
globe in the process. This documentary gave him the perfect excuse to
fulfill his dream. The title refers to the year in his life when, for
him, summer would never end. </P>
<P>Along the way, we learn a little about surfboards and waves. What types
of waves are the best? Little curly ones that don't collapse. What does
great surfing mean? Long rides. </P>
<P>But more interesting is the human story. </P>
<P>The tone of the film is a little staged and familiar at first. Brown
seems like a big self-assured lug going for cheap clever laughs. He
realizes he has a movie camera and sets up a couple of visual gags, as
if that's what one is expected to do with a camera. But as he moves
around the globe, the novelty of the camera wears off and his wonder and
enjoyment grow. He stops TRYING so hard, which is for the best, because
the adventure he is living is enough for the camera. </P>
<P>He arrives on the west coast of Africa with his two "stars" and
companions. Blond, white, well-dressed, and carrying 10-foot surfboards,
they stand out like a couple of sore thumbs. They catch some waves at a
nearby beach and are mobbed by locals (adults and children) who have
never seen a surfboard, much less a person riding one. The surfers let
their "hosts" try the boards, which are such a fascinating novelty that
they fear the locals won't give them back. This first encounter is a
real culture shock and it makes them grow up fast. What little "we're
Americans so respect us" attitude they started with, goes away fast. </P>
<P>As they travel south along the coast, they gradually become more
streetwise, more confident, and more mature. </P>
<P>In the most memorable scene of the film, the two surfers find the most
perfect spot on the globe for surfing. It is a little beach in South
Africa, miles away from the nearest civilization, only accessible by
walking 20 minutes from the road across some sand dunes. The spot itself
is pretty, but to the average viewer, it is no more amazing than any
other spot on earth. To these surfers, it is paradise. Their
enthusiastic declaration that it is the best surfing in the world makes
us feel privileged to have seen it and sorry not to have been there in
person (especially in light of what became of the spot . . . but more on
that in the next review). </P>
<P>The movie is a favorable cross between a home movie and a serious
documentary. Bruce Brown's personality is apparent from the pranks he
pulls at the beginning, and through his more serious evaluations of
friendships and waves. But the movie is also long enough and of a broad
enough scope to be taken seriously. The mix is very effective. The
storyteller's personal enthusiasm for the subject matter is contagious,
and it makes both Brown and surfing much more interesting. In fact, it
will probably make you want to try surfing. </P>
<P>Not many of us get to fulfill the kind of dream that Brown fulfilled by
making this movie. He knew he was lucky to be making THE ENDLESS SUMMER,
and by the end, he seems genuinely grateful for the chance. The year of
the endless summer was clearly the best year of his life, and we got to
see it all. </P>
<P>He was a wonderful tour guide for one of the most interesting tours on
film.</P>
