<P>Susan Granger's review of "SIMPATICO" (Fine Line Features)</P>
<P>        Jeff Bridges, Nick Nolte, Sharon Stone, and Albert Finney try
valiantly but even their compelling performances can't effectively
elevate this somber, slowly paced screen adaptation of Sam Shepard's
1994 play about friendship and betrayal set against the backdrop of
high-stakes horseracing. Written by David Nicholls and Matthew
Warchus, a British theatrical director who makes his debut as a screen
director, it's deeply symbolic, filled with bitter, rambling
ruminations about corruption. Jeff Bridges plays a multi-millionaire
horse-breeder in Lexington, Kentucky, who - in the midst of selling a
champion thoroughbred stallion named Simpatico - is interrupted by a
phone call from a boozy bar-fly, an old friend, Nick Nolte, who
threatens to expose a racetrack scam they pulled when they were young,
involving Bridges' now-dissolute, unhappy wife, Sharon Stone, and
Albert Finney, as a former horse-racing commissioner whom they
slandered and vilified. Catherine Keener (Being John Malkovich)
emerges as the most likable character, playing a supermarket check-out
clerk who serves as an awkward, reluctant intermediary between the
overwrought antagonists who share this gritty, guilty secret. There
are lots of flashbacks, skillfully integrated by editor Pascquale
Buba, in which Liam Waite, Shawn Hatosy and Kimberly Williams play the
trio of principals in the '70s, their ambitious, younger years. On the
Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, Simpatico is a sly, melancholy,
bittersweet 6, revolving around vindi cation and vengeance.</P>
