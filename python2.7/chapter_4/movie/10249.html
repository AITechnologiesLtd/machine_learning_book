<PRE>YES VIRGINIA, THERE IS A POSTMAN </PRE>
<P>Forget the Little Caesars advertisement with the dancing dog. "The
Postman"  is now the most entertaining commercial I have ever seen. I
didn't know until the credits rolled that I had actually been watching a
movie - I thought it was an ad for the US Postal Service to help clean
their image after all of those disgruntled postal worker controversies.
This truly is a propaganda film. Everyone loves the postal service in
"The Postman," the mail is always on time, and the Postman from the
title is even called a "god send." </P>
<P>I don't mind being brainwashed if I'm having a good time, and for the
most part, that's what "The Postman" provides. But don't confuse this
flick with the award winning Italian movie "Il Postino" even though
there are similarities. Massimo Troisi, the guy who played Mario in "Il
Postino" refused to have his heart condition fixed until the filming of
"Il Postino" was complete; he died from heart disease one day after
production was finished. "The Postman" is so long (190 minutes) that the
same thing will probably happen to anyone with a heart condition who
goes to see Kevin  Costner's "The Postman" and refuses to have his heart
fixed until after the movie ends! </P>
<P>Even after the nearly disastrous "WaterWorld," Director Kevin Costner
has enough confidence to direct yet another post-apocalyptic future
movie. He even gives a nod to the unsuccessful "WaterWorld" by having
two characters in "The Postman" discuss a place called "St. Rose," a
possibly mythical haven that is talked about in the same terms that
DryLand was in WaterWorld. What distinguishes "The Postman" is that it
has an especially frightening view of the future. At one point, a town
is established that is made up entirely of postal workers... and they're
armed!! That's even worse than living on a world completely submerged in
water! </P>
<P>In the world of "The Postman," there is no government, food is scarce,
towns are terrorized by thieves on horseback, et cetera. Of course
things are bad - This is a future movie! Thankfully, the cause of the
woes of earth is  never bluntly stated. There's nothing I hate more than
characters talking about stuff they would  already know ("Remember how
the apocalypse started?" "How could I forgot when China dropped the bomb
on us because we assassinated one of their exchange students?" "Yeah,
and remember how we blew up Canada for selling our secrets to the
Russian government?"). There are hints that perhaps racial problems
caused the deadly conflict. Because of that, I feel that this movie is
more important than "Amistad" - and probably more historically accurate
too! From what the screenplay tells me, here's my take on what happened
- after California passed Proposition 209 banning use of race in hiring,
there was a huge war in America. This is a helpful message - "Do the
Right Thing" and don't nationally abolish affirmative action or most of
us will die! </P>
<P>And this certainly is a message movie. Another message is that improved
communications will bring peace to the world, and that's terrific, but
this movie never dealt with the problem of countries overseas with
inhabitants who speak foreign languages. That's how these wars get
started - ignorant tourists go on vacation to an unusual place and
irritate the wrong people. Judging from the ending of "The Postman,"
maybe the world wised up and accepted English as the only truly holy
tongue. </P>
<P>After I heard Kevin Costner's first line, I thought to myself - "This
movie was really good until the characters started talking," because the
visuals are excellent. The dialog sounds very bad and bookish at first,
but it gets less bad. To his credit, Kevin was talking to a mule at the
beginning, so he probably wasn't too concerned with intelligent
conversation. </P>
<P>You can watch "The Postman" and pay attention only to the surface of it
and still like it, but I wasn't content to do that - I wanted to analyze
all of its metaphorical complexities, complexities that I'm sure it
doesn't know it has. Little does Kevin Costner realize, he has directed
a brilliant satirical political allegory. </P>
<P>"The Postman" details the ultimate battle between whining big government
liberals and selfish wimpy gun-worshiping libertarians. I guess that
explains the movie's catch phrase: "Similar names. Dissimilar
ideologies." </P>
<P>The villain in this picture is named, symbolically I guess, Bethlehem.
He represents former libertarian presidential candidate Harry Browne. At
the end, not only does this guy get blocked from the presidential
debates, he's shot in the chest! How do you like near-anarchy now,
Browne?? The problem I had with the ending is that it glossed over the
inevitable huge tax hike when the liberals won. It instead focuses on
the fact that because Bethleham is killed with a gun, Postman uses the
oppurtunity to sign a gun control bill called the "Bethleham Bill,"
which creates a two-week waiting period for firearm purchases. President
Starkie would be proud, Kevie!</P>
<P>Bethlehem is the leader of a "clan" of warriors who go from town to town
and accept handouts because they are feared. They are also constantly
recruiting people for their army, but in such small numbers that I don't
understand why they even bother. Kevin Costner happens to enter a town
just before it is struck by the bandits, and Bethlehem happens to choose
him as one of the new soldiers. </P>
<P>Bethlehem's army takes Kevin Costner back to their marvelous looking
camp and cooks his mule. It is here that the new soldiers are trained
and Bethlehem demonstrates his devotion to libertarianism, shows off his
love for Shakespeare, and his tendency to punish those who are slow
learners. These are your usual bad guy soldier types, but one thing
makes them different - they hate to watch "Universal Soldier," but love
to watch classics like "The Sound of Music." </P>
<P>Bethlehem's hero is a farmer turned author/libertarian activist named 
Nathan. Nathan wrote an anti-government book that Bethlehem reads an
obscure quote from. When this book, titled "I Want to Tell You," was
published, it evidently helped Nathan start this whole mess that
destroyed the world. I'll never understand these libertarian farmers.
They want to overthrow the nation's government and destroy every living
creature, yet they STILL want their farm subsidies! In his book, Nathan
states that the government should be abolished and replaced with the
"Rules of 8." If I remember right, those rules are: 1. Obey the head of
the "clan." 2. Mercy is for the weak (That's more of an opinion than a
rule). 3. Punishment is swift. 4. Punishment is death. 5. No food after
midnight. 6. Keep away from water. 7. Stay away from bright light. 8.
Anyone can challenge the head of the "clan." I think a lot of those
rules are a little redundant. I could have condensed them down to six at
most. </P>
<P>Kevin Costner is named Shakespeare by the libertarians because he was an
actor before the "Really REALLY big war," and as one of the villagers in
the beginning points out, he's Really REALLY bad at acting. Another
thing that  characters like to point out about Kevin is that he's
"funny," but some of the quips he makes that are supposed to make him
Mr. Comedian make me long for Joe Piscapo. </P>
<P>Kevin escapes from the camp, and not that it's much of a surprise, but
this is another one of those movies where it's impossible to kill the
good guy even with excellent marksmen and unlimited bullets, but it's
easy to kill the bad guys. When Kevin is floating down a river at a
steady speed, bullets splash all around him, but later on when he's
captured by the baddies, he's rescued easily by a gun-toting love
interest. </P>
<P>Kevin's escape is followed by one of the most unintentionally hilarious
scenes in the movie. It's very cold and Kevin discovers a wrecked car.
He hides inside of it and finds a skeleton wearing a postman's uniform
and holding a bag of mail. He puts the uniform on to stay warm and finds
a lighter near the skeleton. As he strikes the flint, he grunts like a
caveman. "Look, ma! I discovered fire!" </P>
<P>The next morning, Kevin, soon to be known as Postman, walks to the
Pristine Town of PineView, and is let in the gates because he has a
letter for one of the citizens. The townspeople love him even though the
sheriff is suspicious, and at a dance that night, a woman named Abby
asks him to get her pregnant, because she has a husband who can't
produce a baby because he had a case of the "Bad Mumps." "Bad Mumps"? Is
that the clinical term? Abby explains that she'd rather get pregnant by
a wanderer who wouldn't stick around and make her and her husband
uncomfortable. Unfortunately for her, but fortunately for Postman and
for the plot, her husband is later conveniently killed, paving the way
for a romantic relationship between Postman and Abby. </P>
<P>In PineView, Postman meets a starry-eyed optimistic youth named Ford
Lincoln Mercury who wants to be a Postman too. He must have seen those
"Be All That You Can Be" commercials. Postman invents an oath and dubs
Ford Lincoln Mercury second postman in command. Ford later organizes a
whole fleet of postmen. </P>
<P>The thrust of the story is that the country starts to become more
patriotic and nationalistic because of the mail deliveries, and
Bethlehem's tyranny starts being questioned. Bethlehem reveals his
anti-Americanism when he forces Abby's soon to be dead husband to burn
an American flag. Hey Newt! Where's the flag burning Amendment when we
need it? </P>
<P>The best unintentionally funny part in the movie is the scene where
Postman rides past a sad-faced kid who is holding a letter up in the
air. He rides on for quite a while after that, and the kid says to his
disenheartened mother: "I guess I missed him." But wait! The Postman
must have overheard from nearly a mile away. He stops. He looks behind
him. He turns around, and... he takes off back towards the kid! He was
very far away, but for some reason, he's only a foot away from the kid
after a couple of seconds. And in slow motion, Postman heroically grabs
for the letter still in the air, and takes it from the formerly
sad-faced child. When the scene was played again at the end, I think I
saw written in fine print in the corner of the screen, "paid for by the
Government of the United States of America." </P>
<P>Soft money will be pouring in to pay for the huge amounts of airtime for
the democrats to show this movie and say - "Do you want the world to
turn into a desert wasteland like in 'The Postman'? Then make the right
choice. Vote Democrat!" But 190 minutes is way too long for an attack
ad, so I imagine they'll cut out all the parts where Kevin is doing his
really bad Shakespeare routine. We can't have our spokesman looking like
a dweeb! </P>
<P>The only thing conservative about this movie is that it advocates
increased military funding, but only temporarily so that the postmen can
get disgruntled and kill a whole slew of libertarians. In fact, that's
the best scene in the entire movie. After the "Postal Massacre" wherein
the postal workers blast their way to victory against the libertarian
fleet, I was able to appreciate the realism of the movie and the
convincingness of the characters' portrayal of insane postal workers.
Finally the bottled up anger in postal workers is put to constructive
use! </P>
<P>This movie has everything. One of Kevin Costner's most heroic moments is
when he sees the smoke from Rush Limbaugh's cigar floating from around a
rock, and he shoots him dead without even looking.  There's even a
riddle. Kevin Costner as Postman asks, "How much mail can a dead postman
deliver?" It's a great question, but the filmmakers had the gall not to
answer it. I suppose it was more "artsy" and "gutsy" to leave it up to
our imaginations. </P>
<P>The key to tricking people into liking bad movies is to get them hooked
in with likeable characters, and I'll admit that I fell for the ploy. To
tolerate this movie you have to forgive it for a lot of detriments, and
I was willing to forgive and let the movie grow on me. </P>
<P>One thing this movie has going for it is that it's so long, that there
just had to be some good stuff in it, even if it was accidental.
Studios, take note - next time you force a director to cut scenes before
distribution, you're probably requesting the only good scenes to be
taken out! </P>
<P>Mostly what I admired was the picture's emotional aspects, even if they
are sappy a lot of the time. The battle scenes are pretty standard, and
at the end when Postman is riding around on a horse between two lines of
soldiers, the filmmakers actually used stolen footage from "Dances With
Wolves!" </P>
<P>I had very mixed feelings while watching "The Postman." I didn't know
whether to cheer or throw up! Overall, I enjoyed the film, but there is
much not to like. There are moments of questionable character
motivation, a silly rescue scene, and really bad lines of dialog
("You're weird"). I probably wouldn't encourage anyone to see this
movie, but I wouldn't try to stop anyone who already wanted to go.</P>
