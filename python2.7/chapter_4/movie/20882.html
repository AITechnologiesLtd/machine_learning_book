<P>Did I miss something? Along with the sleeper hit `The Blair Witch
Project', Mark Illsley's `Happy, Texas' was the most
talked about film at 1999's Sundance Film Festival. It was picked
up by Miramax for a hefty sum, and is now being released to critical
acclaim.  Disappointingly, the `Happy, Texas' which I saw is
nothing more than a dumb attempt at quirky humor that never finds its
footing.</P>
<P>Jeremy Northam and Steve Zahn portray, respectively, Harry Sawyer and
Wayne Wayne Wayne, Jr., two jailbirds who are freed when the van which
is carrying them crashes. The wanted criminals then rob an RV and head
for the nearest town, which happens to be Happy, Texas, `the town
without a frown.' Once they arrive, they are mistaken for a couple
of gay beauty pageant producers who are supposed to help the town
qualify for the statewide pageant. Fish out of water `comedy'
ensues.</P>
<P>Harry has his eye on the town's bank, which is run by Jo McLintock
(Ally Walker). She, like the rest of the town, believes that he is
gay, and they quickly become close friends. Harry, however, just wants
access to the bank's safe.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Wayne gets stuck with the job of training the town's
girls. Along with a lady named Ms.  Schaefer (Illeana Douglas), Wayne
eventually figures out how to teach singing and dancing, through
rather unconventional methods. Soon he and Ms. Schaefer are a couple,
even though he's `gay'.</P>
<P>But the only sporadically funny bit of the film occurs when Harry
catches the eye of Chappy (William H. Macy), the town sheriff. Chappy,
a closeted homosexual, works up the courage to ask Harry out on a
date, and Harry reluctantly agrees. Being the typical movie small town
sheriff, Chappy is too dumb to realize that these two men are the
fugitives which he has been notified of in numerous notices.</P>
<P>`Happy, Texas' basically focuses on the four key relationships:
Harry and Chappy, Harry and Jo, Wayne and Ms. Schaefer, and Harry and
Wayne. Aside from the comic fireworks that William H.  Macy brings to
the proceedings, these main characters are rather dull creations.</P>
<P>The film, which does not live up to quirky small town gems like
`Cookie's Fortune', may have been more successful without
some unprecedented miscasting. The prospect of seeing Steve Zahn, who
has grown on me through his portrayals of stoners in `SubUrbia'
and `Out Of Sight', and Jeremy Northam, who has done fine
dramatic work in `The Winslow Boy' and `An Ideal Husband',
together in a comedy initially seemed exciting. But Northam can't
handle this type of comedy, and Zahn's characters have somehow
become similar and annoying. William H. Macy, who is almost as good
here as in `Fargo', should have been the one carrying `Happy,
Texas'.</P>
<P>The film has supposedly been edited since its premiere at Sundance,
and it shows. `Happy, Texas' can't be the same film that
people were raving about in Park City, because it just isn't very
good.  The screenplay, written by Ed Stone, Phil Reeves, and director
Mark Illsley just isn't very funny, and there isn't much that is
fresh or new. `Happy, Texas' is like `Some Like It Hot'
crossed with `In and Out', except with nowhere near as many
laughs or smarts as either of the two.</P>
<P>I guess good buzz can either be real (in the case of `The Blair
Witch Project') or way off (as in `Happy, Texas'). This
instantly forgettable trifle should be taken off Northam and Zahn's
resumes because both of them are fine actors, but `Happy, Texas'
proves that an actor is only as good as his role.</P>
