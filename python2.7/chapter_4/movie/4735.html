                       A film review by Michael John Legeros

<P>     This straight-forward corruption tale is wholly unremarkable, save
for a few good scenes and the occasional insight into the arena of
municipal politics.  Four writers-- including Nicholas Pileggi (CASINO)
and Paul Schrader (TAXI DRIVER)-- are credited with this Big Apple fable
of how a New York City Deputy Mayor (John Cusack) and his boss (Al
Pacino) deal the with the ever-expanding problems caused by the acci-
dental shooting of a young black boy in Brooklyn.</P>
<P>     The casting of Pacino is dead-on, but John Cusack is a loss.  He's
a lightweight and doesn't belong at the center of such a serious story.
The supporting cast-- which includes Danny Aiello and Martin Landau--
fares a little better, when the script isn't ignoring them.  (Aiello, in
particular, has a dandy confrontation with a mob boss played by Tony
Franciosa.) Director Harold Becker (MALICE) keeps everybody busy and
that adds to the illusion of dramatic tension, of which there is none.
Most disappointing is the missing sense of grandeur.  For such a big
town, CITY HALL sure feels small.</P>
