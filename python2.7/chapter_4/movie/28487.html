<P>PLOT:
A clumsy nerd with a lofty dream to find Atlantis, the lost continent, 
finally finds a believer in his cause, gets a crew and heads towards the 
unknown.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Hmmmmm. Remember when Disney used to churn out animated greatness during 
the 1990s? Well, it appears as though those days are far behind us, as 
this film checks in with rather unimpressive features. First of all, 
this isn't a "kids" movie. This seems to be an animated movie created 
for adults, but one that doesn't completely click on either level. It's 
not a film that will bore anyone stupid, I mean, it does sprinkle a 
little bit of entertainment here and there, but once all is said and 
done, the only thing that I was left with was a nasty case of the 
ho-hums. Which is why I'm not recommending this film to anyone in the 
theatres (especially since the animation in the film is less than 
impressive), but might suggest that you check it out on video one day, 
if the topic interests you. Actually, much like its counterpart opening 
film this weekend, the missed opportunity that was TOMB RAIDER, this 
picture also lacked a certain "energy" about it. It wasn't all that 
funny, all that interesting, all that exciting or all that entertaining. 
Sure, the movie sets up an interesting premise, but why did it have to 
spend half an hour showing us how they all get to Atlantis? We already 
know that they're gonna end up there anyway, and since the development 
of the story up to that point isn't all that interesting (no real funny 
moments, little action, no real "bad guy", etc...), the film just helped 
me shrug my shoulders during its opening half.</P>
<P>They also set up all of these "quirky" side characters (all of whom 
seemed ideally picked to cover as many races/ethnicities sitting in the 
audience), but I really didn't think that any of them were all that 
humorous or interesting. Actually, I did like the "Italian" guy a 
little, he was pretty funny at times, but what was the deal with that 
Mole character? Talk about seeming "out of place" in a movie! Hmmmm, I 
don't know. This movie is definitely not the next SHREK. But to be fair 
to Disney, I guess this film wasn't really trying to be funny or reach 
for the "kids" audience either (at least, it didn't appear to be). I 
guess this film was more of a "serious animation" experiment, which for 
the most part, just didn't do it for me. None of the characters really 
stood out, the story was somewhat interesting, but not really all that 
engaging, and the animation, well...I'm sorry but there was practically 
nothing that was special about the animation in this film. It was quite 
rudimentary, to say the least.</P>
<P>But yeah, I did still appreciate the whole Atlantis "behind-the-scenes" 
stuff, dug the connection between the lead character and the chick from 
Atlantis, and did finally "get into" the movie during its final 15 
minutes or so (which concluded on a pretty touching moment and some cool 
action scenes). But overall, the film just didn't live up to all of the 
previous Disney animated movies, or any of the cooler, hipper 
computer-generated animated flicks that have rocked the box-office over 
the past couple of years. I don't know what it was exactly, but 
something was just missing from this movie. All in all, a 
disappointment.</P>

(5/10) - Mulan (7/10) - The Road to El Dorado (7/10) - Shrek (8/10) - 
Titan A.E. (7/10) - Toy Story (7/10) - Toy Story 2 (8/10)</P>
