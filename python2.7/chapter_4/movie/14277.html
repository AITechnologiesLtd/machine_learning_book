<PRE>                   THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                      Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                         2 :-) :-) for that girl!</PRE>
<P>Director: Bobby Farrelly & Peter Farrelly
Writers: Peter Farrelly, Bobby Farrelly & Ed Decter & John J. Strauss
Cast: Cameron Diaz, Matt Dillon, Ben Stiller, Lee Evans, Chris Elliott</P>
<P>There certainly is something about Mary. In one of the funniest and
darkest comedies this year we have a mixture of the vile and the
hilarious, that will keep you simultaneously shocked and amused at the
same time. This seems to be the winning combination for the Farrelly
brother team.</P>
<P>Cameron Diaz is undeniably charming as Mary, who has up to five guys
obsessed with her throughout the movie, if not the entire male audience.
She is the gal of every straight guy's fantasy – pretty, wholesome,
intelligent and outright nice. Of course a woman like Mary doesn't exist
in the real world, that's why we have Hollywood to create the illusion.
There's a lot to disbelieve about Mary, but because we are always
looking for the perfect someone, she exists in all of us.</P>
<P>This movie has interesting ways of dealing with issues like
masturbation, kissing dogs, wrinkled breasts, hair gel, missing sperm,
intellectually disabled people, hives, testes and zippers. Every time
you are on the brink of throwing up, the humour some how pulls you back
in time before you barf in shock. It is a dangerous tight rope of
balancing what is acceptable to watch on screen and pushing the limits
of the viewer's tolerance. This could easily have been a disaster if it
was just out to shock, but the witty script and intelligent plotting
saves the day and somehow makes Mary a success, when it could easily
have been a Turkey.</P>
<P>Other notable notes is Matt Dillon, who plays against his usual
stereotypic role of body hunk and plays a sleaze with big teeth,
graciously. Ben Stiller is wonderfully naïve and everybody else seems to
team up extremely well, making Mary one of the zanniest experiences
you'll come across this Spring.</P>
