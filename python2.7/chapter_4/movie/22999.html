<PRE>THE TIGGER MOVIE</PRE>
<P>Bouncy, flouncy, trouncy, pouncy, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun….  The
wonderful thing about The Tigger Movie is it's fun for everyone.  And it
truly is.  Guaranteed to bring both smiles and tears to every face,
young and old alike, Walt Disney Pictures' The Tigger Movie is a
refreshing surprise.</P>
<P>OK, I'll be the first to admit it – I wasn't looking forward to this
picture.  Yet another Disney animated epic, jam-packed with computer
generated cels, overdone musical numbers, and one-dimensional characters
that long ago stopped being characters and became cartoons.  "More
colorful fluff to sell t-shirts, pajamas and tennis shoes," I mumbled to
myself as I took my seat.  "Eye candy."  But as the curtain drew up to
reveal a pre-movie Disney-style mambo from Lou Vega (of "Mambo No.9"
fame), I was whisked back to a time when a man named Walt Disney first
introduced us to our imaginations.</P>
<P>The new Tigger Movie is simply, beautifully done, and art director Toby
Bluth has indeed created the definitive Pooh film.  The line drawings
are incredibly true to the original E.H. Shepard drawings from the A.A.
Milne books, and they are layered upon a breathtaking watercolor canvas.
Light and air seem to be literally washed into the scenes, giving the
Hundred Acre Wood an authentic English countryside feel, complete with
light-reflecting moisture. The color palette and the weather cleverly
follow the emotional arc of the story, ranging from rich and warm autumn
days to cold, purple and gray snowstorms.</P>
<P>If the stunning look of the new movie doesn't reel you directly in, the
script and characters will.  Kudos to first-time director and
screenwriter Jun Falkenstein for breathing life into the classic world
of Pooh that we remember.  The vernacular and dialogue hold true to the
original stories, and the characters are rich and full, giving a
perspective to each player that we have never seen before.  Falkenstein
allows us to delve a little bit deeper into the characters, and he
really makes them come alive.  Tigger displays a range of emotions that
is really quite sophisticated, and our lovable, bumbling Pooh bear
remains as willy-nilly silly as ever.</P>
<P>In another brilliant brainstorm, Falkenstein has reunited the
award-winning songwriting team of Richard and Robert Sherman with
Disney.  Disney fans will remember the inimitable word play and charming
melodies of the Sherman brothers from movies such as Mary Poppins,
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, and The Jungle Book, to name a few.  In 1990,
the Sherman brothers were named `Disney Legends,' and we are not let
down by the six wonderful new songs from this movie, including a
Tiggerific new tongue-twisting `Whoop de dooper, loop de looper, ally
ooper bounce' song.</P>
<P>At the core of this new adventure is a heartwarming story that everyone
can relate to.  Tigger is in search of his family and embarks upon a
quest that inevitably leads him right back to the Hundred Acre Wood and
the friends who truly love him.  Tigger learns that family, more than
looking alike or being related by blood, is really about the people who
are closest to you and who really love you, through good times and bad.
The story stays simple and true, with a message that even the youngest
viewers will appreciate and enjoy.</P>
<P>Bouncing full of fun, laughter, tears and "indomitibibble" spirit, The
Tigger Movie has everything we hope for from the original Pooh, with new
life and depth.  Complete with the narrative talents of John Hurt
(replacing Sebastian Cabot), an exquisite vocal cast, and even one epic
Fantasia-esque song sequence full of all the pomp and color we expect
from Disney (yes, there are even synchronized Tigger-swimmers and a
hummingbird chorus), The Tigger Movie (that's T-I-double Guh-E-R-R) is
not to be missed.  Take your kids, take your date, take your grandma –
this one would do Walt proud.</P>
<PRE>4.5 stars</PRE>
