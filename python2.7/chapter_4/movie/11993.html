<P>AWAKENINGS, with Robin Williams, gave us a side to a part of the world that
is a bit on the sordid side, and almost always not helpful to the few that
are a bit on the needy side.  Where AWAKENINGS leaves us feeling sad, and
unable to live with the consequences, BEAUTIFUL DREAMERS comes through.  And
it comes through  showing that there are many ways to deal with the human
condition,
love being the single most important factor of all....and experimenting with
elements which science almost never considers being the other.</P>
<P>All in all, the late nineteenth century is shown as the century where
medicine begins to study its more sordid side for curing people by cutting
more into them, instead of the option of trying different things and
processes which have been used for many ages, by many different cultures.
And the film begins with just that.  The disabled, physically and otherwise,
are the test rats upon whose bodies all forms of experiments are conducted,
and at a famous conference a certain R. M. Buck goes to detail his own
ideas, only to quit before he gets started because almost all the serious
doctors are veritable doctor Frankenstein's, rather than healers.  And in
the audience is an elder gentleman with a large beard and temperament, who
makes fun of a few of the experiments, much to the chagrin of the audience
of doctors.  And this elder man as it turns out is the free thinker Walt
Whitman, in a time when this type
of thinking is not considered to be in vogue, although he seems to do very
well.</P>
<P>Mr. Buck's wife, who is having doubts about her husband's ways, as is the
institution that employs him, is also planning on ending a relationship,
because she herself does not understand what is going on, and how the free
thinking poet is actually interfering with her relationship.  But in her
solitude and despair it is the few words of the poet which bring her around,
to realize that what is happening is more than meet the eye, and in
actuality, it is the correct and best thing....and the humane thing to do.
Amidst all this, is the poet who refuses to be pegged down to a definition,
and comes up with a line or two at a party which alienates the crowd
somewhat.....certainly not the classical style of words they wanted to hear.</P>
<P>As time goes by, and with the suggestion of the poet, the doctor begins to
lead his motley crew into exercises of fun, and socializing with the
affluent which in the end leads to success and the fall of the priest and
mayor whose attitudes are more conformist than they are positive and
spiritually guided.
Of all the films I have seen this year, few stand out as true victories of
the human spirit, and it takes one story of a free thinker, or two, to bring
out a sense of beauty in the human spirit which is not always found in many
films.  The winners are the disabled, that are now considered better people
instead of test animals.  And unlike the film AWAKENINGS, this film makes
other doctors turn their minds to what is happening, and how it is going to
be.</P>
<P>All in all, it also shows the desire that a few countries have for finding
new cures for the most disabling things, rather than the strict medical
style that tends to be de-humanizing.  In England, there still are
experiments being carried out which also involve arts and totally different
ways of dealing with society's disabilities.  R. M. Buck's ways was but one
of them.</P>
<P>With an excellent cast, and an ability to show something which is poignant
and at times unpleasant, this film is truly beautiful and stands out as one
of the few.</P>
<PRE>Must see.
