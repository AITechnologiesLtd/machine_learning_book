"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Did you hear the one about the priest, the rabbi and the Scientologist?
It's not a joke, but rather Keeping the Faith, the directorial debut of
Hollywood wunderkind Ed Norton, who co-produced the film with his buddy
(and the film's screenwriter) Stuart Blumberg.  Norton casts himself as
the priest, Ben Stiller as the rabbi and Jenna Elfman – a Scientologist
in real life – plays the woman that comes between the two pious pals.</P>
<P>Like Norton's Fight Club, the film has the disheveled star telling most
of the film through flashback, this time as his character Father Brian
Finn.  In the sixth grade, Brian and his best friend Jacob Schram
(Stiller, Black & White) form an inseparable, platonic bond with fellow
student Anna Reilly (Elfman, Dharma & Greg).  The three are joined at
the hip for two years, until Anna's father gets a job transfer.  Brian
and Jacob remain close, but they never see Anna again.</P>
<P>As adults, Brian and Jacob pursue their respective spiritual careers,
incorporating honest, comedic routines to their sermons, which soon are
delivered to packed rooms as the word spreads through their neighborhood
that faith is hip again.  Nicknamed `The God Squad,' the priest and
rabbi even plan to open a multi-faith senior citizen karaoke/dance club
to which their flocks can flock.  Everything is going well, until Anna
calls and announces that she's coming to New York for an extended
business trip.</P>
<P>Of course, when the two men pick Anna up at the airport, they find that
she's a stone-cold fox. Despite previously having only a friendly,
non-physical relationship with Anna, you know it won't be long before
Brian and Jacob are beating their chests and tugging at her like two
lions tearing apart a gazelle.  Yup – there's nothing like vagina to
ruin a good friendship.  And unless you're talking about a Gregg Araki
film, there is really only two ways the film can end – Anna leaves New
York alone and Brian and Jacob stay friends, or Anna stays in New York
and all three remain friends.</P>
<P>Faith has a very funny trailer, which is always a concern these days
since it seems that a film's best moments are usually shown in its
preview.  That's not the case here, as Faith blows through most of the
trailer's highlights in the first five minutes.  There are some great
religious gags in the film, usually revolving around Judaism (Jacob
plays with `Heroes of the Torah' playing cards and is dogged by
persistent Jewish mothers that fix him up on dates that he can't
refuse), while Norton uses the film to show off his dead-on impressions
of Rain Man and Latka Gravas.  The usually annoying Elfman is downright
charming as the high-powered something-or-other businesswoman.</P>
<P>Two-time Oscar nominee Norton, who has already logged five amazing
performances in just six major releases, lets the film get away from him
about two-thirds of the way through, where things begin to drag.  It's
really too bad, because Faith would be a great film if about twenty
minutes were hacked out of it.  His style is pretty unobtrusive (save a
few odd shots during a sex scene), which may have something to do with
the actor working with heavy-hitting directors like Milos Forman (The
People vs. Larry Flynt), David Fincher (The Fight Club) and Woody Allen
(Everyone Says I Love You), the latter of whom was an obvious influence
on Norton.  Faith contains plenty of shots of its characters yelling at
each other on the sidewalks of New York.</P>
<P>Norton even casts Forman in Faith.  Has the student become the master?
Not quite, but it's certainly a promising debut.</P>
<P>2:11 - PG-13 for adult language, adult situations and mild sexual
content</P>
