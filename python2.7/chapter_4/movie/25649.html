<P>Aggressive, bleak, and unrelenting film about an interracial couple,
Steve and Sam (Damon Jones and Elexa Williams respectively), who are
viciously attacked in a parking garage one night by a gang of
skinheads.  The skinheads beat Steve, then force him to watch as they
brutally rape his girlfriend over and over again.  When Sam kills
herself later that evening, Steve decides that the skinheads must be
taught a lesson.  Waiting seven months for the thuggish skinheads to
forget about the incident entirely, Steve shaves his head, dresses in
combat boots and suspenders, tattoos his flesh with Nazi symbols, and
tries to infiltrate the gang.  As he gets closer and closer to the
people who committed the horrible crime against his girlfriend, he
begins to learn just how vicious these people really are and starts to
question his own motives for violence.</P>
<P>Randolph Kret's script, based on two real life incidents that affected
not only his life but the life of the film's producer Shaun Hill, is an
affront on violence and intolerance.  The film causes its audience to be
subjected to such brutality and ignorance that one can't help but be
disgusted by the events presented within.  I've seen it said that this
is the film Fight Club should have been, but David Fincher's film was
trying to define a generation.  Kret's film is a wake up call to a
generation and his message is a powerful one.  If Fincher is the Kubrick
of our generation, then Kret is our D.W. Griffith (thematically
speaking).</P>
<P>There is not a single likable character in the film.  The skinheads are
obviously the most repulsive characters in the film, not only because of
their beliefs but because they are in a constant state of fury (not just
against other races but within their own circles).  The African-American
characters in the film are constantly shown as sexually assaulting drug
abusers who are always on a joyride looking for someone to accost.  Even
gay men get in on the act, locating the skinheads' lair and beating them
severely with lead pipes and other blunt objects.  The main character
Steve is also unlikable because of the person he becomes just to seek
out revenge.  What all of this comes down to is the simple message that
violence begets violence, and the constant clashes between factions will
do nothing but continue the endless cycle of violence inherent in our
society.</P>
<P>The cast of this film is absolutely remarkable.  Damon Jones shows a raw
energy that many actors can't seem to summon these days and his
performance seems nothing less than powerful.  His initial reaction to
hearing about his girlfriend's suicide is one of the most affecting
scenes I have ever seen in a film.  David Lee Wilson, who plays
(appropriately enough) David Lee is accurately evil as the second in
command skinhead who also makes extra money performing oral sex on other
men (an irony that seems lost on the other skinheads).  Wilson's
character is pure hatred and he brings out this hate perfectly.  Sadly,
actor Dave Ward, who portrays the character of Crew, will not be able to
follow up his excellent performance as he was the victim of a vicious
act of violence himself at the hands of a fellow actor during an
incident of road rage.  Ward showed immense promise and he will be
greatly missed.</P>
<P>Note: It is a shame that the filmmakers had to add a disclaimer to the
end of the film stating that neither they nor the musicians contributing
music for the film condone racism.  The message about hatred couldn't be
spelled out any more clearly than it is here, but there are those who
would probably find this film much more akin to a training video than a
condemnation.</P>
<P>There are no "winners" at the end of this film either.  No character
gets his or her comeuppance and the ending leaves us almost right where
we began.  Where American History X had redemption for most of its
characters, no such victories are in store for Pariah's band of twisted
souls.  It is this bleak ending that carries the film's most powerful
message: the message that, despite what you may be able to momentarily
do to put your own mind to rest, evil will still be with us (and in many
forms) and there is very little than can be done to eradicate it
entirely.</P>
