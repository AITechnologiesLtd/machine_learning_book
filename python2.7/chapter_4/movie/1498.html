<PRE>                         POLICE STORY III: SUPER COP
                       A film review by Leong Heng Cheong
                      Copyright 1992 Leong Heng Cheong</PRE>
<P>     This summer, Hollywood brought us LETHAL WEAPON 3 -- a movie about
two buddy cops out to get the villain.  Hong Kong brought us POLICE
STORY III -- a movie about two undercover cops out to get the villain.</P>
<P>     POLICE STORY III: SUPER COP (same Chinese title) stars Jackie Chan,
one of the hottest HK action movie actors at the moment.  It also stars
Michelle Khan, together with Maggie Cheung in a very very minor role.
It is directed by Stanley Tong.</P>
<P>     POLICE STORY III: SUPER COP is about a Hong-Kong police/detective
who was sent to China as an undercover cop against an international
druglord.  There, he was paired with the Chinese counterpart in the
mission.  By the end of the movie, the two had travelled back to Hong
Kong, then to Vietnam/Thailand border, and Kuala Lumpur of Malaysia with
the villain of the movie.</P>
<P>     For those who are looking for a tight plot, you won't find it here.
I don't think there is much of a plot anyway.  Even by the end of the
movie, I still am unsure of what exactly is the objective of the
mission.  And then, there are many various plot holes all the way from
the beginning till the end of the movie.  You really have to heavily
suspend your belief when watching this movie.  Or better still -- don't
think.</P>
<P>     And if you ceased to use your brain power, you will find POLICE
STORY III: SUPER COP a very fun and entertaining action movie.  The
stunts are spectacular, and the action coordinating tightly packed.
Those who are bored by the action sequences in LETHAL WEAPON 3 will find
POLICE STORY III much more energetic.  This is the strength of HK
action movies: they pack in all the wonderful stunts with almost no
regards to the plot or feasbility.</P>
<P>     Except for a few jokes that are linked to the previous films, this
sequel is almost an independent film.  Jackie Chan, who directed the
earlier film in the series, concentrated on the action and the acting in
this sequel.  Almost all of the stunts are performed by the actors
themselves, which is quite rare in Hollywood productions.</P>
<P>     So far, I've only seen two type of films that can attract (almost)
all of the audience to stay throughout the closing credits.  One of
which is from the producers/directors/writers of NAKED GUN and TOP
SECRET!  The other: Jackie Chan's movies.  As usual, after the end of
the movie, the audience are treated to outtakes of the show, and scenes
where the stunts failed.</P>
<P>     In short, POLICE STORY III: SUPER COP is a very entertaining piece
of action film.  Audience should never look forward to the plot nor the
acting in these kind of HK films.</P>
