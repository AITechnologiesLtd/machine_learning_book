<P>Starring Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Sydney Pollock. Rated R.</P>
<P>Eyes Wide Shut isn't the masterpiece many were hoping to see in Stanley
Kubrick's final film, but it is an impressive achievement; a
mesmerizing, haunting, adult psychodrama about marriage, fidelity and
sex. It's a Stanley Kubrick film from beginning to end, consistently
exhibiting the auteur's trademark penchant for long, continuous takes,
his unparalleled deftness behind the camera and his uncanny ability to
extract gorgeous performances from his exhausted cast (indeed, Eyes Wide
Shut attained infamy even before its release for its notoriously
laborious shoot: Kubrick, a renowned perfectionist, reportedly held his
cast "hostage" on the set for nearly a year).</P>
<P>In an uncharacteristic maneuver, Kubrick cast two big-name stars in the
lead roles, namely real-life husband and wife Tom Cruise and Nicole
Kidman. They play Bill and Alice Harford, a volatile couple who, during
the course of a couple nights, ponder the validity of the idea that a
husband and a wife must be faithful to each other. He is an M.D., she's
unemployed and we are introduced to them as they are getting ready to go
to a fancy party. At the affair, they are both propositioned and both
nearly succumb to the temptation to play around with someone else.</P>
<P>When they return to their lavish New York apartment Kidman (after
smoking a dash of weed) inquires whether her husband had sex with two
models who approached him during the night. He (truthfully) says that he
did not and asks what happened with that Hungarian guy she was dancing
with. They proceed to argue until Alice tells her spouse a lustful
story: evidently some time ago, she had a thing for a young naval
officer. She admits that she was ready to give up her whole future with
Bill and their young daughter if this guy wanted her even for one night.</P>
<P>Bill is jolted by Alice's story and we anticipate his reaction, but at
that moment he gets a phone call and has to go "show his face" at the
house of a just-deceased patient. This turns out to be the beginning of
a long and eventful night on the town. The daughter of the dead patient
hits on him but he wisely turns her down. He almost does the dirty deed
with a kindly hooker who approaches him on the street. Then, through a
series of coincidences, he winds up at a gothic mansion where a
ritualistic (and frankly, creepy) orgy takes place, with costumed people
performing various public sex acts on each other. Erotic dread mounts as
Cruise (who's not supposed to be there) wonders the spacious halls
watching the "action" until he is discovered to be an outsider.</P>
<P>Much hoopla has been raised over the fact that Warner Bros. digitally
edited the orgy scene. With the help of a computer, they put in cloaked
figures to block some of the actual sex acts (they can still be seen,
just not in all their glory) in order to avoid the dreaded NC-17 rating.
European viewers will see the film as Kubrick envisioned it. Roger Ebert
calls the American version the "Austin Powers version," and many others
have bashed the alterations. I am of the potentially controversial
opinion that the figures only supplement the scene's mystical
atmosphere.</P>
<P>The first thing one notices about Eyes Wide Shut is how it looks. This
is an artful, distinctively gorgeous production, shot in dark, moody
hues and featuring some elaborate, beautiful scenery. From the giant
mansion used in the film's centerpiece to the decor at the Christmas
party to the Harford's apartment, this film is always a pleasure to look
at. To boot, a great soundtrack makes it more atmospheric still.</P>
<P>At the core, behind the graphic, controversial content and unappealing
mood, this is a good-natured movie that emphasizes the importance of
fidelity. It looks at sex as almost perfunctory by portraying it as
unnerving rather than erotic. It's something superficial and yet
something necessary to achieve a deeper relationship. At the end, it
seems, Bill's eyes are wide open to the special kind of love he and his
wife have for each other, more meaningful than anything he could ever
hope to find on the streets of New York.</P>
<P>Kubrick elicits wonderful performances from both Cruise and Kidman. Tom
is completely convincing as Dr. Harford, a man who seems guided solely
by destiny, with no control of the course his life will take. Nicole
projects a quiet intensity as the jittery yet aggressive wife and her
performance is stunningly effective: she's headed for an Oscar nod. The
movie has some help from a similarly strong supporting cast, at the head
of which is director-cum-thespian Sidney Pollock, enigmatic and
articulate as Harford's mysterious friend.</P>
<P>Eyes Wide Shut is not perfect: the last hour could have used a slightly
more scissor-happy editor and both Cruise and Kidman are too good-
looking for me to believe that either would have a very strong
temptation to philander. Still, this is an important work from a great
director, and while it may not be on par with some of Stanley Kubrick's
best it is a worthy final film, a complex exploration of jealousy and
faithfulness.
