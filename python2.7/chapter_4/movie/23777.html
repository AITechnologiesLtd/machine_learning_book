<P>"Villainy wears many masks, none of which are more dangerous than virtue."
Ichabod Crane, SLEEPY HOLLOW</P>
<PRE>RATING: 9/10</PRE>
<P>Imagine: Sherelock Holmes encounters a mystery, where murder and other
unexplained events are caused by no human, but truly a supernatural force.
"Sleepy Hollow" begins in New York. The year is 1799. The new millenium is
right around the corner and the progress of science and technology has no
limits. The virtuous constable Ichobod Crane (Johnny Depp ), reflects that
mentality and stands as a symbol for the upcoming era, a man ahead of his
time in his belief in scientific evidence and forensics, at the dawn of a
new century of enlightenment -- a sophisticated and moral man, who has
chosen the police work of noble and even poetic reasons. Ichobod likes to
think of himself as a progressive citizen, a pioneer of his work and a
scientist of the modern world. His scientific inventions and humanistic
attitude has become a problem for his superiors. He is therefore sent to
investigate an ancient and unsolved mystery. A row of bizarre murders in an
isolated village, called Sleepy Hollow, where victims have been found in the
woods..decapitated. As Ichobod nobly accepts this task, he finds himself in
a completely different world, a parallel universe, where logic doesn't exist
and science can't help. The frightened villagers reveal the shocking truth
of a demon, a headless horseman that haunts the woods. Determined to
discover the "true identity of the assassin", and paying no attention to the
warnings, he continues to investigate, using his scientific inventions.
While heads continue to fly, Crane experiences frightening childhood visions
of his own, remembering things he wanted to forget. His science and
technology, on which he depended on, show no results, and all he believed
in, slowly fades away. He is on the brink of a complete mental breakdown,
when he falls in love with a mysterious beauty (Christina Ricci ), who
wishes to help him in his quest. Ichobod continues to blindly trust in logic
and reason, until he goes into the dark woods and sees the demon for
himself..</P>
<P>Andrew Kevin Walker ("Se7en" ) and Kevin Yagher have both done a great job,
transforming Washington Irving's primitive ghost story ("The Legend of
Sleepy Hollow") into a likable film. But it is director Tim Burton that has
made it into a memorable experience. He has created a staggering and
beautiful magical world, which is nothing less than a visual feast. This is
simply the most beautiful and visually enchanting film since Francis Ford
Copolla's Dracula. This being the case, it is not hard to guess that the
visual power of this film overshadows the acting, which by the way is
surprisingly convincing. Johnny Depp is fabulous as the confused scientist.
A delightful and fresh performance, combining high humor with some serious
psychological themes. Christina Ricci is solid but a little less impressive
than she has been of late, but she gracefully floats in her role as a clean,
kind hearted white witch who captures Ichabod's heart -- an untamed, free
spirit of the wild. Ichobod and Katrina are completely different souls,
completing each other with their opposites. Their love story is one of the
key elements in the film, but it is the personal evolution of Ichobod Crane
that is its heart. And as the story progresses, we learn more about him and
his past. He is a man blinded by science and naively believing in
technology, reason, logic and simple explanations. Although he would like to
think otherwise, his vision is rather limited and primitive. As he enters
this strange parallel universe, he doesn't know what to do, how to react or
how to explain the events happening around him. This, his aristocratic
origin, dry wit and emotional inexperience serves both as terrifying horror,
philosophical thoughts and comic relief. Caught between dream and reality,
he takes a step into another world and another life...</P>
<P>Like "Don Quixote", "Sleepy Hollow" is a bittersweet parable about the
perils of the imagination as it's affected by reading or hearing stories.
Like Copolla's Dracula, this is a surreal filmatic experience -- a fairytale
vision. Sleepy Hollow is a place lost in time, somewhere between dream and
reality. There's no one that can copy Burton in his work. His exceptional
visual imagination allows him to create wonders on virtually every shot.
There's something undeniably touching about such unreasonable passion and
devotion, and I suppose some of the same sort of piety can be found in
Sleepy Hollow. All his movies have the fervent fanaticism of a cult taste
projected into the mainstream with affection as well as confidence. He
creates a dark and moody atmosphere of contrasts and symbolism. Seeking
balance, Burton paints a landscape of extreme contrasts, purely good and
evil; the man of science, that keeps his feet on the ground, and the woman
of nature, a wild spirit that flows with the wind, are set against the
landscape, which is a reflection of mood and atmosphere -- and what a
magical landscape it is! The only problem is that the film gets rather
unfocused after the all-too-traditional climax, where evil is unmasked and
good prevail. But then again, this is a fairytale.</P>
<P>Sleepy Hollow presents a magical art direction, enchanting cinematography,
moody musical score and some fabulous visual effects--a ravishing visual
experience, and an entertaining and interesting detective story, with the
right dose of horror, romance and humor. This film is a thrilling ride back
to the turn of the 19th century.</P>
