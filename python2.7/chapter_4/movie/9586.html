Gattaca - Genetic Tale Not Fully Developed
by Homer Yen
(c) 1997</PRE>
<P>Imagine that immediately after birth, a single drop of blood from the
newborn is taken and analyzed.  The genetic sequence reveals the
baby's entire future.  Its likelihood of disease, brain disorder,
baldness, and even its life expectancy is disclosed with a
slap-in-the-face cruelty.   In the not-so-distant future world of
Gattaca, medical science has evolved to such a point whereby this
procedure is commonplace.  The societal implications are more
profound.  Looking at one's genes is like looking at one's SAT scores.
Your results will predict (rightfully or wrongfully so) your success
and what you'll be able to accomplish.  </P>
<P>But why chance a less-than-perfect creation?  Medical science has also
progressed to the point where you can take the best of what the mom
and dad has to offer and genetically engineer the perfect baby.  And
as Gattaca begins, we see the young lives of two brother's who develop
a bitter sibling rivalry.  One is the perfectly engineered Anton
(Loren Dean).   The other, Vincent, (Ethan Hawke) was naturally
conceived.  He is God's child; an "de-gene-erate"; an "in-valid."  He
is diagnosed with a learning disorder, suffers from extreme myopia,
and is projected to live only 30 years.</P>
<P>But despite all of his imperfections, he has the desire to live, and
works hard to enter the Gattaca corporation, which launches manned
space flights.  But this is a fearsome world that subtly promotes
genetic discrimination.  After all of his attempts are thwarted
because he doesn't have the correct genetic makeup, he uses an illegal
DNA broker who sets him up with Jerome (Jude Law), a "valid" who was
paralyzed in a previous accident.  Jerome provides urine samples, hair
samples, blood samples and other body flotsam so that Vincent can
assume his identity and pursue his extraordinary goals.</P>
<P>Melancholy in atmosphere, the film focuses on Vincent's ascension
through a system that seeks to ground those who are genetically
deficient.  Danger presents itself for him in several ways.  A murder
at Gattaca makes Vincent the prime suspect, and he must summon all of
his wit to hide behind the facade of Jerome.  A slow-developing
relationship with a co-worker (Uma Thurman) may reveal his true
identity.  And there is also the uneasy relationship that he shares
with the real Jerome who at times seems unstable, cynical and
suicidal.</P>
<P>Jerome's character is fairly complex, who is a prisoner of perfection.
When they first meet, he displays his Olympic silver medal in disgust.
"I was supposed to be perfect, but only came in second.  How do you
expect to succeed," he asks.  Their relationship is one of the better
elements of this movie as both need each other to accomplish the
impossible.  However, other components of the genetic story line fall
short of their potential.  The storytelling is deliberate, but
ultimately boils down into a minor battle between the archetypes of
structure (Gattaca) vs. passion, intuition and heart, all of which are
embraced by Vincent.  Ethan Hawke does a good job emoting the
frailties of humanity against the lab-generated expectations of
perfection.  However, the script suffers from a lack of impact.  They
do well to give us a stimulating look into their antiseptic future.
Plausible and interesting, Gattaca poses what promises to be one of
the most complex moral issues that we will eventually face.  However,
the movie seemed unsure in its direction, and then ultimately decides
to "go Hollywood" by relying on a feel-good ending to wrap things up.
A tidy ending for such a tidy-looking movie?  That was a bit of a
shame when there were so many complex layers that could have been
further explored.</P>
<P>Science fiction in the movies has recently specialized in alien
invasions, but the best of the genre deals with ideas that peek into
our own humanity.  It was smart for this movie to stress character and
atmosphere over computer-generated effects.  The futuristic look is
also nicely accomplished.  Unfortunately, Gattaca only achieves a
slightly better-than-average composition.</P>
