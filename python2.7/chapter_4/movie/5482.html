<PRE>                              SHADOWS AND FOG
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1992) ** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        Woody Allen is the man. We all know that. But he's not 
the man in SHADOWS AND FOG, which is probably overall the 
worst film he's ever made. Not that it isn't worth watching or doesn't 
have its moments, because it does. Allen has done a terrific job here 
of creating the visual style of the great black-and-white crime 
movies of the past, where a town would take on a different identity 
in the dead of night after all the responsible people went to bed, 
changing into a frightening, claustrophobic place you don't want 
to encounter alone.</P>
<P>        The citizens now have a personification for the 
metaphorical fears of loneliness and the dark -- a strangler on 
the loose. It's the whole Jack the Ripper thing without the English 
accents. Set in the 1920's, SHADOWS AND FOG opens with a 
silhouette of the strangler doing his work on the latest victim and 
cuts to Allen's house, where an angry mob ready to take justice 
into their own hands demands that he join them in hunting down 
the killer. Allen, of course, doesn't want to go, counting himself 
one of the responsible people who should be sleeping at such a 
late hour.</P>
<P>        But he does put his clothes on and step out into the street, 
making his way to the doctor's office. Donald Pleasance makes a 
great three-minute contribution to the movie as someone who is 
constantly around cadavers and is fascinated with death, a journey 
he makes a few minutes later as he becomes the strangler's next 
victim. Funny how the guy could survive five HALLOWEEN 
movies with Michael Myers but along comes one lousy strangler 
and -- POW! -- lights out.</P>
<P>        Speaking of people who make great three-minute 
contributions (and I'm not talking about Woody's sex life here), 
the big draw of SHADOWS AND FOG is its incredible all-star cast. 
Mia Farrow and John Malkovich play lovers who are in town with 
the circus. Farrow storms out into the night upon walking in on 
Malkovich and Madonna doing a nude vogue and is offered free 
board by hooker Lily Tomlin at the local whorehouse. Farrow 
accepts, of course. It's nothing new to her. She's been living with 
Woody for ten years.</P>
<P>        The movie turns into STEEL MAGNOLIAS for five minutes 
as Mia and the girls chat about life and love to a constantly rotating 
camera, the highlight of the conversation being when one of the 
prostitutes asks her what she does at the circus and Mia says she's 
a sword swallower. The hooker replies, "No kidding. That's my 
specialty too." This brothel includes den mother Kathy Bates and 
her #1 whore Jodie Foster, along with a young customer (John 
Cusack) who wants something that isn't on the menu -- Mia. The 
price for a helping of Farrow, we learn, is $700, which Cusack is 
more than willing to pay.</P>
<P>        Mia eventually ends up wandering the streets with Woody 
for an hour, while a couple minor subplots develop. In the end, the 
strangler situation isn't even resolved. Woody padded the movie 
(which is still only 86 minutes long) with a bunch of needless 
comedic and dramatic scenes but didn't think to write an ending for 
the central plot. The visual world he created is great, as are the 
many stars, but in the end, there's no substance and very few laughs. 
It's like wax fruit. It looks great and you think you're getting the real 
thing until you actually take a bite out of it. Once again, I'm not 
talking about Woody's sex life...</P>
