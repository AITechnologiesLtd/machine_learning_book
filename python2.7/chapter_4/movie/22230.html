<P>        When the pressures of the world become too much, we all wish we
could escape to a place of peace, and there's no better spot for rest
and meditation than Shangri-La, the utopia conjured up by author James
Hilton in his best-selling novel "Lost Horizon."</P>
<P> The book has been adapted for the screen twice, first in 1937
by director Frank Capra and again in 1973 by director Ross Hunter.
Hunter's version, one of the great fiascoes of its time -- it was
renamed "Lost Investment" by Columbia Pictures executives after they got
a look at its balance sheet -- has become a campy curio, but Capra's
epic still holds up some 60 years after its debut. It's just been
reissued on DVD, with plenty of extra features certain to delight, such
as a documentary on the painstaking restoration process on the picture
and previously unseen sequences featuring stars Ronald Colman, Jane
Wyatt and Isabel Jewell.</P>
<P> In the mid-1930s, Columbia was a studio still trying to shake
off its small-time reputation. "Lost Horizon," which cost a
then-staggering $2.5 million and was promoted as "The Mightiest of All
Motion Pictures," represented a major risk for the company. Much of the
budget was spent on production values: "Horizon" is played out on a
series of exquisite sets, many of them obviously influenced by the
designs of Frank Lloyd Wright.</P>
<P> Despite deservedly earning an Oscar for Best Art Direction and
a nomination for Best Picture, the film did not recoup its cost on its
first go-around. By the time it was re-released a few years later, WWII
was raging and the pacifist message of "Horizon" was no longer in vogue,
which led Columbia to re-edit the 132-minute film. It took film
historian Robert Gitt 25 years to reassemble Capra's original vision, in
some cases using still photographs and the surviving soundtrack to
represent sequences which have not survived.</P>
<P> Although Hilton's story of a crew of refugees discovering a
blissful secret society in the hidden Valley of the Blue Moon is still a
potent fantasy, what makes "Horizon" truly fascinating today is noting
some of the more offbeat aspects of the picture. Although no one in
Shangri-La has any use for money or property, Capra takes pains to
inject a less-than-subtle anti-Communist message by including a crabby
Russian (Margo) who insists on leaving paradise and suffers greatly as a
result.
 The various relationships detailed in the story are also rather
provocative. Certainly the combative friendship between Barnard (Thomas
Mitchell) and Lovett (Edward Everett Horton) can be read more than one
way, especially when Barnard insists on calling his buddy "Lovey" and
suggests they play games of "honeymoon bridge" and "double solitaire."</P>
<P> In the book, the heroic Conway (Colman) falls for a Tibetan
woman named Lo-Tsen. But since onscreen interracial attraction was still
a major taboo in the 1930s, his love interest here is a schoolteacher
named Sandra, played by the radiant Wyatt. Although their affair appears
to be mostly platonic, there's an attention-grabbing scene in which
Conway spies on a skinnydipping Sandra.</P>
<P> "She," adapted from H. Rider Haggard's timeless tale, is
another story of perils and passion in a forgotten land. Like "Horizon,"
it's been produced multiple times, although never as lavishly and
entertainingly as the 1935 version (available on both VHS and DVD),
starring the imposing Helen Gahagan as She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed, the
eternally beautiful ruler of the lost kingdom of Kor.
 This would be the only film appearance of Gahagan, a noted stage and
opera star who later entered the political arena as Helen Gahagan
Douglas. Reportedly, Gahagan was embarrassed by the movie and vowed
never to heed Hollywood's call again. But perhaps she was her own
severest critic: "She" represents Depression Era escapism at its very
peak.</P>
<P> The movie was produced by Merian  C. Cooper, who'd struck it
rich two years earlier with "King Kong." Those with sharp eyes will note
that the enormous gate cutting Kor off from the outside world is the
same one which served -- for awhile -- to hold Kong in his natural
habitat on Skull Island. A box office failure in its day, "She" all but
vanished into the RKO vaults for the next 40 years, not even showing up
on the Late, Late Show.</P>
<P> What a loss. This outrageously opulent adventure tale stars the
stoic Randolph Scott as American explorer John Vincey, who ventures into
the Arctic to find the story behind a cryptic 500-year-old letter.
Accompanying him are the jolly Holly (Nigel Bruce, later to become a
familiar face as Dr. Watson in the Nigel Rathbone "Sherlock Holmes"
movies) and the feisty Tanya (Helen Mack), who's secretly attracted to
John. After surviving an avalanche and battling cave-dwelling cannibals,
the intrepid trio come face to face with a much greater danger, the
imperious She, who has been bathing in a flame of eternal life and
biding her time for centuries, looking for true love. "I am yesterday
and today and tomorrow," She muses, shortly before deciding John is the
man worth waiting half a millennium for. Tanya, however, has other
ideas.</P>
<P> Thrillingly scored by Max Steiner and featuring backdrops you
won't believe (check out the patio of Holly and Tanya's apartment),
"She" climaxes with a dazzling ceremony in the Hall of Kings, featuring
hundreds of extras performing some of the most bizarre choreography ever
filmed. That sequence alone would make the movie worthwhile, but it
turns out to be only one of the many treasures of "She." James Sanford</P>
