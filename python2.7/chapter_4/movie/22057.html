WALKABOUT
A review excerpt by Joe Barlow</PRE>
<P>STARRING: Jenny Agutter, Lucien John, David Gulpilil
DIRECTOR: Nicolas Roeg
WRITER: Edward Bond (based on the novel by John Vance Marshall)
RELEASED: 1971</P>
<P>"We want water. That's as simple as I can make it. Anybody can
understand that." --The Girl, Walkabout </P>
<P>Nicolas Roeg's Walkabout is quite literally a diamond in the rough.
It's difficult to name a single other film in which the setting
becomes quite so much a part of the tale, or another that is
photographed quite so lovingly. Freeze any frame and you have a
potential National Geographic cover shot. Every scene is deliberately
chosen for its cinematic effect, and there's not a moment in the film
which doesn't convey astonishing beauty--visual poetry, if you
will--even when the narrative is at its bleakest. </P>
<P>But 'poetry in motion' is too simple a description for the wonders of
Walkabout; its success and brilliance stem not just from Roeg's
masterful use of the camera, but from the haunting, human characters
which inhabit this world. The film, an adaptation of the celebrated
novel by John Vance Marshall, follows the struggles of a fourteen
year-old girl (Jenny Agutter) and her little brother (Lucien John, son
of director Roeg) as they find themselves stranded in the Australian
outback after an excursion with their father ends in tragedy. </P>
<P>An Aborigine boy (David Gulpilil) appears. He appears to be about
sixteen years old, and speaks no English. He's on his walkabout--an
Aborigine right of manhood in which a boy spends six months living in
the wilderness, surviving on his wits and hunting prowess. Realizing
that his two new friends are stranded, he travels with them, teaching
his companions (via gestures) how to survive in the Outback. </P>
