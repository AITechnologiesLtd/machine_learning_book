<PRE>Entrapment **1/2</PRE>
<PRE>rated PG-13
released by 20th Century Fox
starring Sean Connery, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Ving Rhames, Will Patton,
Maury Chaykin
story by Ronald Bass and Michael Hertzberg
written by Ronald Bass and William Broyles, Jr.
directed by Jon Amiel</PRE>
<P>Sean Connery, in his 68th role, plays Robert MacDougal, a well-known art
thief who matches
wits and falls for Gin Baker, an insurance agent played by Catherine
Zeta-Jones, fresh off her first
starring role in "The Mask of Zorro." The film is Jon Amiel's "Entrapment."
The comment is,
"Come on, Mr. Connery. I never thought I'd say this, but you're out of
you're league."</P>
<P>I'm a little tired, so I'll sum up "Entrapment's" plot rather vaguely. After
a Rembrandt is stolen from
a corporate building, Gin Baker(Zeta-Jones), an insurance agent, decides to
try to catch the
thief(Connery). Slowly, she starts to like the thief, and she ends up
playing both sides; helping him
steal, and helping to catch him.</P>
<P>Catherine Zeta-Jones is once again good in the heroine role she perfected in
"Zorro", but I'd like
to see her try something else(a romantic-comedy, perhaps?). Sean Connery is
also suave as ever.
But the film's plot doesn't always make sense and the movie is too glib for
its own good. Director
Jon Amiel wants "Entrapment" to a Bond-style crime caper, but the most it
provides is harmless
fun.</P>
