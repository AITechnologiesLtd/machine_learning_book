ACROSS THE PACIFIC (1942)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>Thanks to the unwritten dogmas of "political correctness"
Hollywood moviemakers these days are supposed to avoid
ethnic or racial stereotypes in their films. We might argue
whether Hollywood puts considerable effort in this, or
whether overzealous implementation of those rules affects
the quality of recent films, but most of the people would
agree that Hollywood made significant progress, at least
compared with previous decades. Reputation of some older
Hollywood films is often tarnished (or controversial, at
best) because of the negative portrayals of certain ethnic
and racial groups. This is especially the case with films
made during WW2, notably those that deal with Japanese. One
of such examples is ACROSS THE PACIFIC, 1942 spy thriller
directed by great John Huston. Additional reason why this
film often gets overlooked is because Huston used cast and
crew of THE MALTESE FALCON, and many of the film scholars
see ACROSS THE PACIFIC as nothing more than much inferior
and rather insignificant follow-up to Huston's true
masterpiece.</P>
<P>The plot, based on the screenplay by Richard Macaulay,
starts on November 17th 1941, few weeks before American
entry in WW2. Rick Leland (played by Humphrey Bogart) is
U.S. army officer who had been dishonourably discharged from
service for embezzling regimental funds. Since soldiering
happens to be his life, he travels to Halifax in order to
offer his services to Canadians, but his bad reputation
precedes him. Out of desperation, he decides to join Chang
Kai-Shek's army and, in order to travel across the Pacific,
he boards Japanese freighter "Genoa Maru". Charming Canadian
girl Alberta Marlow (played by Mary Astor) boards same
vessel and Leland soon falls in love with her. Their
shipboard romance is shadowed by the presence of elegant,
but nevertheless sinister Doctor Lorenz (played by Sydney
Greenstreet), university professor who used to live in Far
East for 30 years and who doesn't hide his strong
pro-Japanese feelings. Lorenz is aware of Leland's
bitterness towards US government and wants to use it in
order to recruit ex-soldier for some covert activities in
Panama.</P>
<P>ACROSS THE PACIFIC represents craftsmanship of Hollywood
Golden Era at its best - plot is a rather interesting
combination of international spy intrigue, melodrama and
humour. Cast of MALTESE FALCON is giving another great
performance - Bogart is quite believable as disgraced
officer and has incredibly good chemistry with Mary Astor,
this time playing somewhat simpler, but definitely more
charming character than in previous film. Greenstreet is
very impressive as villain, albeit not very different from
characters he had played in many similar films. Dialogue has
a lot of great lines, including some not so subtle Freudian
references (especially when characters compare size of their
guns). However, the ending of the film is very weak -
interesting plot is drowned in cheap melodrama and not very
believable method of providing obligatory Happy End. Perhaps
Huston is not to be blamed for this, since he left the
shooting in order to go to war and left directing to Vincent
Sherman who was not up to the task.</P>
<P>Depiction of Japanese characters, although questionable for
our standards, may be useful for those who want to study
inter-racial relations in 1940s America. Japanese are
portrayed as evil, insidious and utterly alien to American
society. Attempts of integration or assimilation are bound
to fail, which is suggested with scene in Panamanian cinema
featuring Japanese immigrants preferring technically
inferior movies from their old country to more glamorous
Hollywood. Moviemaker's scepticism towards individuals
overcoming their cultural and racial background is also
underlined with the character of Lorenz's henchman Joe
Totsuiko (played by Victor Sen Young) who wants to look and
sound more American than Americans themselves only to become
a caricature; in the final scenes, Doctor Lorenz, who made a
great deal of superiority of Oriental culture, fails
miserably in his attempt to follow example of his Japanese
role models. This worldview might look unacceptable for most
of today's audience, but it is presented very skilfully,
which is another reason why ACROSS THE PACIFIC should be
seen as something more than simple WW2 propaganda.</P>
