<PRE>                             THE JACKAL 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
             3 :-( :-( :-(  for stopping dead in its tracks</PRE>
<P>Cast: Bruce Willis, Richard Gere, Sydney Poitier, Diane Venora, Mathilda
May, Tess Harper Director: Michael Caton-Jones Screenplay: Chuck Pfarrer
based on the motion picture screenplay THE DAY OF THE JACKAL by Kenneth
Ross</P>
<P>If I could sum this movie into a single word, it would be SLOW. If I had
the pleasure of renaming THE JACKAL it would become THE TURTLE. I
haven=92t seen an action thriller with so little action and so few thrill=
s
since the days I was a connoisseur of budget movies made for television.
Even with two popular stars like Willis and Gere, this movie still
suffers from a lack of charisma, charm and character. It=92s hard to pump
life into this dead animal of a movie, when the only thing going for it
is an overdone scavenger hunt between two middle-aged Hollywood stars.</P>
<P>The plot is simple. Assassin extraordinare, THE JACKAL (Willis) has been
contracted to kill somebody important. When I found out who it was, I
yawned and went back to snooze. This movie is so quiet that you could
have a good 45 minute nap between the 1st and 2nd bullet, a 30 minute
doze between the 2nd and 3rd bullet, before finally being rudely awoken
by a sudden spurt of loud explosions, frenzied firing and frantic
screaming. Some people would say save the best till last, I call it post
mature ejaculation =96 too loud and very messy.</P>
<P>In this movie Bruce baby doesn=92t have to worry about the missing hairs
on his head, or the flab on his tum. He is THE JACKAL, the man with a
hundred faces, a thousand smiles, a million disguises, but hey Bruce
you=92ll never fool us into believing you=92re a Super Model. His nemesis=
,
IRA sharp shooter Gere, is as authentic as serving somebody Earl Grey
when they asked for Irish Coffee =96 sadly miscast.</P>
<P>In conclusion, THE JACKAL is as mysterious as a fart in a crowded room,
as action packed as pointing a finger at an unsuspecting victim and as
thrilling as getting away with it. A very disappointing effort overall.</P>
