<PRE>NOW AND THEN: FROSH TO SENIORS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Dan Geller and Dayna Goldfine's documentary NOW AND THEN: FROSH TO
SENIORS, the sequel to their thought-provoking FROSH: NINE MONTHS IN A
FRESHMAN DORM, finishes up the story of the 10 Stanford University
students. Although not as insightful as Michael Apted's UP documentary
series, it shares a similar construction in the way it contrasts
people's opinions over a span of time.</P>
<P>Overall, the participants and the movie this time are much mellower and
laid back. The original was full of attempts by the kids to be as PC as
possible with relentless diatribes against sexism, racism, and all the
popular ism's and with putdowns of anyone who dared question the dogma
of the day. The first movie contained more surprises, but this one is no
less enjoyable and fascinating. It is also much more polished, as the
filmmaker's skills have advanced considerably in the interim. They
recently won an Emmy for the television documentary "Kids of Survival."</P>
<P>The 10 participants are an ethnic melting pot of men and women who are
labeled in the press notes as African-Americans, Mexican-Americans,
Chinese-Americans and that non-hyphenated catchall, Caucasians.</P>
<P>Somehow the filmmakers have managed to chose 10 kids who go to the top
school in the Silicon Valley and yet have found only one genuine
entrepreneur in the lot. Of the group, almost half have majors such as
Feminist Studies for Political Science and African-American Women's
Studies. No matter how representative the group looks, one wonders if
they really are. Nevertheless, each of them have intriguing stories.</P>
<P>Monique, the African-American daughter of a crack-addicted mother,
laughs at rich white kids who say that money doesn't matter. She goes
from scheduling her classes as a freshman around her soap opera viewing
to being a GPA-centric senior, as she tries to get into a good grad
school.</P>
<P>Cheng, who lives his life in constant overdrive, has had subscriptions
to Fortune and the Wall Street Journal since he was a freshman in high
school. He's off to be an investment banker, assuming his interviews go
okay. He figures that whatever he does, he'll have to work 80+ hour
weeks, which will not allow enough time to date. In contrast, his mother
says that all she wants for him is for him "to meet a nice girl, be
married." Easily the most accomplished student of the group, he is,
nevertheless, filled with anxiety and doubt. "The people I interview
with just don't like me," he worries, without any real need. "I wish I
could change to be a different person." Expect to see Cheng someday on
the cover of his beloved Fortune.</P>
<P>Binge drinking is shown as being as natural a part of the curriculum as
English composition. The filmmakers, whose biggest problem is that they
ask softball questions, never confront the students with their budding
alcoholism. Nick, for example, loves college partying and boozing, since
he says that he knows his dad lives far away.</P>
<P>Sexual orientation is a problem for some, most noticeably two male
buddies (Gerardo and Chris) who aren't gay, but who liked hanging out
together all of the time as freshmen. They confront their friends who
refuse to believe that they aren't gay, but it turns out to be a waste
of time.</P>
<P>Nick realizes over the course of his college years that he's strickly
gay. He said in the first movie that he was bisexual, but after
realizing that he never dated women, he finally admits to himself that
he is just plain gay.</P>
<P>Debbie, a happy and good-spirited student, is always questioning others.
When a freshman, she asks that seminude pictures of women be taken down
from men's rooms, but by the time she's ready to graduate, she's happy
to have seminude male pictures on display in her room. She assaults poor
Sam, who takes it well enough, claiming that all women hate him because
he is a white male. "There is no happiness for women in this society,"
she says in one roundtable classroom discussion, which the others accept
without question as being an obvious truth.</P>
<P>After an unsure beginning, Sam becomes the most at peace with himself.
"I care far too much about what others think of me," he says with brutal
honesty about why he made one of his choices as a freshman. By his
senior year, he is president of his fraternity -- most of the group
pledge, although one recants later. "I think that I personally have
become pretty much what I wanted to become," he says with satisfaction
as graduation approaches.</P>
<P>"I'd love to just be happy," says Brandi, an upper middle-class
African-American, who has always known her career path would include a
good college. "To be happy, you have to have a good job." She drops out
for a time, seeking her happiness in, of all places, retail sales at a
mall.</P>
<P>With a traditional but nonetheless satisfying ending, the movie tells
what happened to each of the students after they graduated. There aren't
many surprises, but each of the them has become such a friend by the end
that you want to personally wish each of them well.</P>
<P>NOW AND THEN: FROSH TO SENIORS runs 1:29. It is not rated but would be
an R for some profanity and sexual discussions. The film would be fine
for teenagers and should probably be required viewing for college-bound
teenagers and their parents. But even if you aren't in either of these
categories, the mesmerizing movie is something well worth seeing.</P>
