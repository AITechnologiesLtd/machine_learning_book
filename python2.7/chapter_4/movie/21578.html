<P>   As I was leaving the theater playing "Anywhere But Here," I
realized that the movie had contributed a personal insight. 
This wasn't an intuition that came on me like an epiphany but
more like one that strengthened a belief I had always had but
about which I needed more convincing.  When I was thirteen
years old, about to graduate from junior high school, I
received an acceptance letter from Stuyvesant High School in
Manhattan.  To this day Stuyvesant is a special place, a
competitive school for kids who pass a rigorous entrance
exam.  I happened to be the only one in my JHS to be so
lucky, so you can imagine my disappointment when my mom
announced that I was instead to go to a different place--a
prep school which she had chosen for me and for which she
and my dad would have to work even harder to afford.  I
didn't particularly rebel against this decision of theirs but
rather felt unable to resist her determination to send me
there.  Years, even decades later, I wondered about her real
motivation.</P>
<P>   Now with "Anywhere But Here" comes a story that clarifies
her resolve.  Like the character of Adele August, she wanted
what was best for me, what might open more doors in my
future.  If this sounds in hindsight like a simple enough piece
of wisdom--the "duh" factor--strangely enough this had
scarcely entered my mind at the time.  </P>
<P>   If a book, play, or movie can clarify some important facet of
our own lives, then that's a big plus for the art form; is it not? 
"Anywhere But Here" may be conventional as coming-of-age
dramas go, but with photographer Roger Deakins's sharp,
wide-lens photography throughout forty locations in Los
Angeles, Alvin Sargent's solid screenplay from Mona
Simpson's novel (and one which avoids excessive
sentimentality), and most of all some absolutely wonderful
performances by Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman as a
mother and daughter team in conflict, the film is a remarkable
achievement.  Its skillful direction by Wayne Wang, whose
"Joy Luck Club" gives him all the credentials he needs for
helming such a drama, is not the least of the reasons for its
successful, down-to-earth portrayal of family rivalry and
reconciliation.</P>
<P>   The most arresting twist of this comedy-drama is a reversal
of the roles we usually expect from parents and their children. 
Adele August (Susan Sarandon) is the mother of a 14-year-
old girl, Ann (Natalie Portman), but as you watch them driving
across half the country from Bay City, Wisconsin to Beverly
Hills, California, you'd not know from their actions which was
the adult and which the child.  Adele, a bouncy, Auntie Mame
type, turns up the radio to a Beach Boys' rendition of "Surfin'
Safari," bopping along to the music, singing the lyrics lustily,
while her teen daughter mopes on the passenger side
complaining "I hate the Beach Boys."  Ann is furious and
depressed that she is being "kidnapped" by her mom, taken
away from the small town she loves which includes all her
friends and especially the cousin she dearly loves, Benny
(Shawn Hatosy).  In Ann's mind, her mother is selfish, simply
wanting to get away from her second husband, a nice guy but
one whom Adele considers boring.  Not for Adele is a lifelong
partnership with a guy who will always be an ice skating
instructor and a claustrophobic town full of people who look
forward to a life's career as supermarket checkers.  Instead,
Adele wants her daughter to take up a career in acting, one
in which the young woman has no interest.  How's that for
role reversal?</P>
<P>   Director Wang exploits the talents of these two first-rate
performers wonderfully, displaying for us a collage of
episodes that, taken together, elegantly defines the character
of these people.  Adele's vulnerability, hiding only slightly
beneath her bluster, emerges when she confuses a one-night
stand with a dashing orthodontist with true romance.  But in a
great many situations she is on the money.  In one scene,
she is dropping her understandably anxious daughter off at
her new school in Beverly Hills.  "They look like they're going
to the beach," Ann protests upon seeing kids that could have
come out of Amy Heckerling's "Clueless." "The intelligent
ones are inside," comforts her mom.</P>
<P>   Wayne Wang may want us at first to share Ann's belief that
her mom is looking out only for herself each time he shows
Adele grasping for material goods.  In one comic display, the
two are about to check into the Beverly Hills Hotel. 
Discovering that the room would be $1200 a night, Adele
complains that the lodging is too small and asks for a villa,
breathing more easily when she is told that there are none
left that week.  Adele's embarrassment at her lack of funds
comes to a head when the electricity in their ordinary flat in
the unfashionable part of Beverly Hills is shut off.  </P>
<P>   Throughout the film, however, we see that mother and
daughter need each other despite their arguments: that mom
is terrified about losing her, and Ann, for all her whining, both
needs and has a great affection for Adele.  As the picture
approaches its conclusion, we're all aware that this portrayal
of the most basic relationship we have will come to an
optimistic conclusion.  But as we ride along with the duo's
1978 Mercedes from occasion to episode, we realize that this
movie, while perhaps more appealing to women in the
audience (whose male friends would rather see Ms. Portman
in "The Phantom Menace"), is not a chick flick.  We've all had
mothers and none of us can honestly claim an unabashedly
joyous connection with them.  Fortunate is each of us indeed
when we discover, as does the beautiful and talented Ann,
that "when she dies, the world will be flat...too reasonable."</P>
