<P>The Bone Collector: calcium deficient</P>
<P>It used to be enough just to have a serial killer on-screen, but then all
the movies had a serial killer, meaning that if a movie wanted to
distinguish itself, its serial killer had to be unique. And uniqueness
translates easily into eccentric. Norman Bates wearing-your-mother's-dress
type stuff. Or, later, Buffalo Bill, making his dress from human skin,
preening in front of the mirror, etc. But then that too got old, ubiquitous,
overdone. Meaning that that eccentricity by which a movie distinguishes
itself had to be displaced elsewhere, spread around some; the detective had
to become the eccentric one, now. And there are endless variations on this,
the most popular perhaps being the Eyes of Laura Mars approach, where the
killer has some vaguely telepathic access to the killings, which turn out to
be mundane. Another variation is the one used in The Bone Collector, where
the burden of eccentricity (the movie's 'draw') is again placed on the
detective, but that eccentricity is physical this time: Lincoln Rhymes
(Denzel Washington, Fallen) is quadriplegic, which is to say not what we
expect a homicide detective to be.</P>
<P>Not that the perp in The Bone Collector is run of the mill, either, though.
Hardly. He's (yes, spoiler, 'he') more akin to the game-players of Copycat
or Se7en, which is to say The Bone Collector continues the tradition of
partially inverting the cat-and-mouse dynamic, via making the killer both
the prey and the one doing the toying. Or, conversely, the killer toys with
his victims and is turn toyed with by the detective. Either way, it
satisfies the need we have in drama to dress the familiar up so it's
difficult to recognize. What's particularly nice about The Bone Collector,
though, is what Lincoln Rhyme's quadriplegia brings to the table: shades of
Cyrano de Bergerac. At times it's practically Roxanne, with Officer Donaghy
(Angelina Jolie) in the field, Rhyme's willing puppet, 'seducing' the killer
out for him.</P>
<P>Too, however, The Bone Collector also has what's practically a requirement
for every cop show: the buddy dynamic. All the predictable little
hostilities and age/culture/race/ethnicity differences etc which are
evidently a necessary ingredient for successful crime-fighting. Even here,
though, The Bone Collector alters things just slightly, by making the
reluctant partner not the older one--Rhymes, whose looming euthanasia plans
are very similar to a certain Sergeant Murtough's similarly imminent
retirement plans--but the younger one, Officer Donaghy. The older officer is
actually the eager one here, which we haven't seen before, even when the
dynamic is used in another genre. Think Unforgiven, the eager young (non-)
killer and the aging, reluctant one.</P>
<P>As for the rest of The Bone Collector, it's conventional, with all the
profiling and forensic insight and gore the genre demands. Se7en type stuff,
without all the Fincher coloring and Fincher sounds and Fincher magic. As
far as genre goes, it even has Michael Rooker (Henry, the original serial
killer) hopping in and out of things, offering all the mandatory
interdepartmental resistance any good detective needs as motivation. And
don't forget Ed O'Niell, in the detective role he's been honing for some
time now (Ford Fairlane, Disorganized Crime, Spanish Prisoner), to good
effect.</P>
<P>Up to this point, The Bone Collector's been an excellent movie. But then. As
has to happen, the serial killer turns his attention to his pursuers, the
detectives, a shift in gaze which The Bone Collector as a movie imitates,
similarly taking its eyes from the prize. Which is to say it loses it. It is
conventional in the way it loses it, at least: the same way Laura Mars does,
by having the perp be mundane (-ly motivated). It doesn't help that we could
identify him so early on, either. In spite of all this, though, The Bone
Collector--in the last few frames--still has the chance of pulling the whole
thing off, but then it takes the easy way out, doesn't tie the narrative
together in the way, say, Se7en does, but instead goes for the Hollywood
ending. Which yes, in this case (quadriplegia, euthanasia . . .) is
definitely the socially responsible way out, but still. Do we really want a
serial killer movie to be safe? Not really. If The Bone Collector would have
just followed through, it could have passed itself off as a serious movie.
As is, though, it's just typical fare.</P>
