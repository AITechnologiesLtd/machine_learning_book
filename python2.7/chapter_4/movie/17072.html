<P>starring: Ron Livingston (Peter Gibbons), David Herman (Michael Bolton), Gary

<P>Seen Feb. 26, 1999 at 7:40 p.m. at the Hoyts Crossgates Cinema 18
(Guilderland, NY), theater #18, with my brother John for free using my Hoyts
critic's pass. [Theater rating: ****: excellent seats, sound and picture]</P>
<P>        Making a biting satire of the real working world shouldn't be too difficult
of a task. Most people can relate to the subtle politics of the modern office
environment and how going to work is like stepping into a whole other world.
But trying to sum it all up is a job itself, which might explain why `Office
Space' only scratches the surface.</P>
<P>        You don't see too many movies or television shows where people actually work
regular jobs (most of us aren't cops, FBI agents or criminals). That's
probably because Hollywood figures 1) people don't want to be reminded of
their work in their leisure time and 2) what could be so interesting about an
office?</P>
<P>        The truth is the working world is probably the most complex and grittiest
reality possible. Not even the most gut-wrenching human drama, fictional or
non-fictional, could stack up to it. That's the biggest obstacle standing in
the way of this film's success and it could have overcome it by simply
sticking to its guns.</P>
<P>        The film shows a lot of promise throughout its first act, especially the
first few scenes alone. The setting seems to be L.A. in the present day where
we're introduced to a gang of working stiffs at some type of corporation whose
jobs involve working with computers, fax machines, memos, meetings, overtime,
staplers, cubicles, constantly-ringing telephones and of course intimidating
bosses. </P>
<P>        Right from the get-go there's a tasty sense of satire here. Our hero, Peter
Gibbons (Livingston), finds trying to maneuver through traffic with the
thousands of other nine-to-fivers is a tedious, painful chore. He does
everything he can to move just that extra 1 mph faster but he never seems to
move any faster than an old man using a walker on the sidewalk. It's the fable
of `The Tortoise and the Hare' for the 1990s!</P>
<P>        Then there's the office itself where Peter's daily exercise in futility
begins. His co-workers aren't exactly his best friends since each has their
own personality problems. There's Michael Bolton (Herman), whose shared name
with the adult contemporary singer is played for laughs but soon becomes
annoying (maybe it's so we can emphasize with him?). There's also Samir (Ajay
), who probably emigrated to the U.S. from India thinking his smarts would
lead him to success, but he's just another schlob. </P>
<P>        The other characters include an annoying fat secretary who worships the boss,
a paranoid veteran worker afraid of downsizing, and a mentally-challenged man
named Milton (an under-used Stephen Root playing the character who starred in
Judge's animated shorts upon which the film is based) whose life revolves
around his love for staplers and secret yearning to burn the building down if
he's pushed around by the boss one more time.</P>
<P>        Speaking of whom, the boss here, under-sub-assistant V.P. Bill Lumbergh
(Cole), does make for a good catalyst of the story and enemy of the
characters. He's very soft-spoken but in a menacing way (he seems to start out
every sentence with, `yeaaaah... we're going to need you to... greaaaat').
Everyone can relate to that.</P>
<P>        Considering all this, it's clear the film definitely has potential. The first
act is very funny as it utilizes a lot of character interaction to get the
ball rolling and establish the satirical, often cartoony setting. For example,
Peter forgets to put a cover sheet on a memo and he is constantly subtlety
scolded for not doing something so routine.</P>
<P>        But where the film begins to weaken is when an actual plot begins to form and
the focus shifts from the office space to Peter's personal life. There's a
lame joke involving Peter having an epiphany and having a constant good
feeling. Then the company brings in two specialists to interview the workers
to see who's really needed and who's not. By this time Peter has become so
disgruntled with everything he simply tells them the truth and in the process
is recommended for a promotion for his `potential.' This just didn't seem
realistic to me.</P>
<P>        There's also a sub-plot involving Peter's crush on a waitress named Joanne
(Aniston, who basically rips off her performance from the first few seasons of
`Friends') who loathes her job too and endures the same type of work B.S. as
Peter. She isn't cheery enough, her boss says, and she certainly can't compete
with the dorky waiter who seems to think waiting on customers is the best
thing that ever happened to him. Needless to say Peter and Joanne hit it off,
but their relationship is used mostly as reserve for hit-and-miss jokes and a
poor attempt at a cute romance.</P>
<P>        The film takes an even bigger turn for the worse by the time the third reel
rolls in which Peter, Michael and Samir seek vengeance on their company. It's
basically the same as `going postal,' but with computers. Their plan never
really makes sense to begin with and quickly blows up in their faces. </P>
<P>        The ending proves that Judge just couldn't write his way out of the hole the
film dug for itself and is just another example of what happens when
television guys try to do movies.</P>
<P>        So much more could have been done with `Office Space' had it just lived up to
its title. Its spoof of office politicking really works, so why get so wrapped
up in a plot?</P>
<PRE>        (3/6/99) [also by Judge: `Beavis And Butt-Head Do America']</PRE>
