<P>HUSH is one of those few films that means to entertain, and does to some
degree.  However, it also contains its fair share of problems, namely
its unfortunate title.  Originally titled "Kilronan" and "Bloodline"
(both better titles than HUSH), HUSH is one of those films that will
fail at the box office because of its name.  It's got an appealing cast,
but it seems that even that isn't enough to draw a crowd these days.
Selecting a title that appeals to everyone is a difficult process, but
we take it for granted.  That is, until we hear a title like HUSH, which
makes you want to laugh at it.</P>
<P>However, nitpicking titles is not a critic's job, and so I will move on
to bigger and better things.  HUSH is another entry in the genre that we
thought died with THE GOOD SON (has there been another "evil
_______-in-law" film since that one?).  Despite this, HUSH is
surprisingly effective, boasting good performances from the cast, and
keeping it real enough to be semi-scary.  Many films of this type fall
into the cliched formula of beginning as a light drama, and then
twisting (usually quickly) into a psychologically frightening film.
HUSH begins the same, but I was quite surprised at how smoothly the
transition was.  Instead of having the "evil" character do something
completely evil that establishes them as the antagonist, HUSH gives this
character a background that explains what she does.</P>
<P>That character is Martha (Jessica Lange), and at first glance she seems
normal enough.  She loves her son Jackson (Johnathon Schaech), and her
new daughter-in-law Helen (Gwyneth Paltrow).  The film begins with
Jackson taking Helen down to his mother's home, Kilronan, a large
horse-farm.  Jackson and Helen live in New York City, so the trip to the
country is gladly welcomed.  Helen is especially thankful for the warm
hospitality she receives from Martha.  Unfortunately, this hospitality
begins to break down, as Helen becomes more aware of Martha's motives.
And as is the tradition of all these films, no one believes
Helen--except for one person: Alice (Nina Foch), Martha's
mother-in-law.  Of course, Alice happens to be in a nursing home, and no
one believes her either.  As the countless cliches come into order, the
film begins to take on a life of its own.  We know where it will go, but
we don't know how it's going to get there.  And as the film approaches
its conclusion, we begin to wonder if it will follow in the grand
tradition of this genre--a bloody shootout or fight between good and
evil.  It doesn't.  Instead, it goes for a more psychological and
realistic ending.</P>
<P>The difference between HUSH and the countless other films of this genre
is pretty basic: HUSH maintains a level of believability.  Whenever the
characters do anything, it is usually upon instincts and not as a plot
convention.  These characters think for themselves, and sometimes it
gets almost too real.  There is one moment in HUSH that scared me the
most.  It is a very small and seemingly insignificant moment, but it was
startling nonetheless.  It comes close to the end of the film.  Martha
enters the room of Helen, in order to do some evil deed to her, but she
is startled by her son's presence.  As she tries to convince him to
leave the room and fails, she turns and pauses for a brief second.  This
pause is the moment.  It occurred to me that this woman is not insane at
all.  She is fully rational, thinking everything out and planning her
next move.  It's amazing what a good performance can do for a role.</P>
<P>There are several problems with HUSH, however.  Most of them are rather
apparent, but some lie in the details.  While many critics complain
about the Schaech character being too dumb for his own good, I think he
is actually quite effective (I will explain later).  The problem lies in
the actual presentation of the story.  Director Jonathan Darby isn't
able to hold together a decent pace, making some scenes riveting, while
others boring and dull.  Overall, there are more scenes of the latter.
Some include the preposterous, as when Helen and Jackson begin taking
each other's clothes off in the middle of the hallway.  Martha walks
back in and stares at them.  She smiles, and then walks back into her
room.  During another moment, I tried to remember if those steam
machines had handles on them for cold water.  I can't recall that they
do.  But mostly, HUSH relies on a lot of coincidental plot tricks, as
when Helen decides to check out the room above the barn ("The light was
on...").  I would also like to know if the same medicine that is used
for horses can be used for humans, or if that was just to move the plot
along.  I also noticed that one scene in the trailers of HUSH was cut
out of the film (The part involving the poison in the bathroom).  But
despite all these flaws, the cast does come through as fun and
appealing.</P>
<P>Jessica Lange has proven to be quite a reliable actress.  It seems that
she excels at playing these crazy characters, although sometimes she'll
give a bravura performance as in BLUE SKY.  This is probably one of her
better performances, as she is very fun to watch.  The only problem I
can see is that the producers were trying to make her look more crazy
than the character needed to be.  I began to feel sorry for her
character, even towards the end of the film.  This isn't Lange's fault,
as she gave a very good performance.  Gwyneth Paltrow is also appealing
in the cast, giving the film some emotional depth.  As for Schaech, he
surprisingly gives a decent performance.  Other critics complain that
his character is too slow to catch on, but I disagree.  First, you have
to put yourself in his position.  You lived with your mother for years
and years, but have only lived with your wife for a couple of years.
Whom would you believe in this situation?  Everything Lange does,
Schaech is probably used to, and he doesn't think it is very strange.
Another performance deserves to be noted, and that is by Nina Foch.  Her
wiseacre character is hilarious and adds a lot of humor that could have
been used more throughout the film.  She also provides the best line in
the film ("I am answering, but you can't see my finger!").  A very good
cast which is forced to plod through this uneven plot.</P>
<P>HUSH is rated PG-13 for some violence, sensuality and brief strong
language.  There is a brief glimpse of Paltrow naked, but it's very
quick.  There is a graphic description of how horse-breeders "help" the
horses mate, though it's not as graphic as it could have been.
Surprisingly, the language is nearly non-existent, though a few words
(including on f-word) are rather harsh and unnecessary.  While the
screenplay and plot may not be original or very good, the cast does its
best to make the film enjoyable.  For the most part, they succeed.  But
sometimes, they fall victim to contrivance and coincidence, and that
makes HUSH a mild disappointment.</P>
