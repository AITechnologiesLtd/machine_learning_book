by Hanif Kureishi from his short story. Photography, Alan Almond.

Skarsgård, Akbar Kurtha, Gopi Desai, Harish Patel, Bhasker Patel. A 
BBC production released by Miramax. 89 minutes. R (sex, prostitution, 
drugs) At the New Art Theater.</P>
<P>Om Puri, a major actor in India (with credits in Western productions 
too), was 46  or 47 when MSTF was made. With his leathery, pitted 
face, he looks older than that, but is as energetic as a younger man. 
He plays Pakistani-born taxi-driver Parvez who came to Bradford, in 
the industrial Midlands, 25 years ago. He has a Pakistani wife 
(Desai) and one child, the  English-born, twentyish Farid (Kurtha).</P>
<P>he film opens with dad, mother and son visiting the home of 
Madeleine, the daughter of the local Chief Police Inspector, to 
celebrate her engagement to Farid. Quickly and deftly it sketches 
Parvez as an exuberant, voluble extrovert who is happy with his 
family's new connection with (for him) upscale Brits. But a discreet 
subtext implies that the Inspector and his spouse are politely 
displeased by their alliance.</P>
<P>Proceeding to its main themes, MSTF makes its main points clearly. 
These are based on a reversal of the more familiar mentality of 
immigrants, where the older, often-homesick and traditional 
generation has trouble assimilating, while the young people feel at 
home with their Englishness. Here, Parvez feels totally Westernized 
and happy to be so. But soon enough, Farid falls under the spell of 
Muslim fundamentalists, joins them, breaks his engagement, gets 
religious fervor, even transforms his parents' home into a 
guest-house for visiting, white-garbed co-religionists. The friction 
with his father grows. The young man accuses him of being blind to 
the decline of a West that has no values yet demonizes the Muslims: 
"You have swallowed all this white and Jewish propaganda."</P>
<P>Farid's mother seems to accepts ther son's changes. She also accepts 
her new status as the inferior gender that  cooks for the visitors 
and takes her own meals alone in the kitchen. Kureishi's script is 
not overtly political. It is obvious that he does not want the fate 
of Salman Rushdie. But it is also obvious where his sympathies lie.</P>
<P>>From the very beginning two threads are developed. In his taxi Parvez 
also ferries prostitutes and their clients, considers sex in the back 
seat and his providing visitors with information about hookers to be 
natural parts of his job.</P>
<P>One girl in particular, Bettina, has a friendly rapport with Parvez. 
An attractive, quiet, natural charmer, she is  played by Aussie 
Rachel Griffiths with a certain cachet and inner elegance. Her 
excellent movie debut was in the Australian "Muriel's Wedding" where 
she was second-billed, as Muriel's lively and promiscuous first 
friend. Her other credits include "My Best Friend's Wedding" and 
especially "Hilary and Jackie" (NOT about Mrs. Clinton and 
Mrs.Kennedy ) which brought her several festival nominations, plus 
one for an Oscar.</P>
<P>Parvez and Bettina are thrown closer when the cabbie is regularly 
hired by  Mr.Schitz, a visiting German businessman (played by the 
Swedish actor Stellan Skarsgård) who also keeps hiring Bettina. 
Skarsgård has been in many movies since 1972, yet is familiar mostly 
from the 90's films "Breaking the Waves" and "Ronin."  His accent is 
oddly American, his part so underdeveloped that no persona emerges. 
We only know that he is heavily  and cynically  into sex and does 
drugs. He uses Parvez as a sort of pimp, even pays him to recruit 
hookers and organize taxis for their transportation for an 
ill-defined orgy, presumably to improve his business contacts. At the 
end of this affair, Parvez is given money to pay the girls one by one.</P>
<P>The several scenes that include Schitz are murky. There is also some 
lack of connection, continuity and development in other sections, 
including those with or about Parvez and/or Bettina. But at least 
there is enough rapport as well as superior acting (it feels 
effortless and natural)  between the older Pakistani man and the 
British girl, before, during and after they become lovers. In fact, 
in different, diffident, idiosyncratic ways, the cabby and the hooker 
have sweet --but never maudlin-- and touching personalities and an 
evolving relationship treated with much originality.</P>
<P>The gulf between father and son reaches a point of no return when an 
intolerant  Muslim group sets fire to a dwelling of hookers, attacks 
them physically. Farid beats Bettina, his father comes to her rescue.</P>
<P>With the young convert taking off with his fellow-believers, and with 
the mother leaving the home, Parvez finds himself alone in an empty 
house. But without hints about the fuure. There is, to the picture's 
credit, no closure.</P>
<P>MSTF, though imperfect, is a warm, gripping film. Its major flaw, in 
common with many contemporary British movies, is that no concessions 
are made to non-British ears. The melding of British English and 
sing-song Eastern  intonations (Parvez, his wife, etc), as well as 
the "white" Midlands accents , made the film critics at the movie's 
preview agree that only  50 percent of the dialogue was understood. 
The sounds of speech, and their recording are increasingly neglected 
in many movies from the UK and the USA.</P>
<P>Much of this is avoidable. The proof is that Parvez has an erratic 
enunciation which ranges from impenetrable to (in his quiet talks 
with Bettina) perfectly clear. On the other hand, the dialogues we 
miss are not all that important, since Parvez and Bettina
are wonderful at body language and facial expressions. There is also 
a particularly good (and symbolic) use of Western pop and jazz  that 
Parvez loves, while some Muslim chants and sounds are heard as 
counterpoint.</P>
<P>Although MSTF was released in England in 1998, it was premiered in 
the Directors' Fortnight series at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival. Its 
source was a short story by Hanif Kureishi in the New Yorker 
magazine, later collected in the writer's Love in a Blue Time. Three 
previous films scripted by Kureishi were "My Beautiful Laundrette" 
and "Sammy and Rosie Get Laid" directed by Stephen Frears and "London 
Kills Me" directed by the writer.</P>
