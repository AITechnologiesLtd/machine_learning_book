   A teen-aged boy tells this story, which is at the heart of the
movie...A mouse wanders around the railroad tracks when a
train comes and cuts off his tail.  The mouse does not notice
this until he arrives home.  The next day he runs back to the
tracks to search for what's missing when a train comes and
cuts off his head.  The moral of the story: If you chase tail,
you'll lose your head.  "Post Coitum, Animal Triste" is the
story of a woman who chases tail, so to speak, who loses her
head, but who gets an opportunity to set it right back on
again.  It's a love story--and the French know about such
things--and it goes against the stereotype that French
romances are talk, talk, talk and little action.  There is some
interesting talk, all right, but the passions are so strong that
the visceral reactions of the principal character Diane Clovier
(Brigitte Rouan) will make you squirm.  
   This girl-gets-boy, girl-loses-boy story engages us because
of the way director Brigitte Rouan cleverly weaves a subplot
into her principal focus, but even more because of Ms.
Rouan's remarkable acting.  She has the uncanny ability to
change from a writhing, despair-ridden, suicidal victim of lost
love, as we see her in the opening scene, to a woman
involved in her career, then on to a peak of sexual frenzy and
ecstasy and back again, playing all parts beautifully.
   Diane proves that women can have mid-life crises that
easily rival those of the male gender.  She has hit the big 4-0,
has a job of some power at a small publishing company,
enjoys the love of her husband and two teen kids.  What's
wrong with this picture?  Nothing, that is, provided that no
outside force intervene.  But when the 20-year-old friend of a
writer she is encouraging, Emilio (Boris Terral), 
literally sweeps her off her feet, her love-at-first-sight becomes
an addiction for both.  They meet, sometimes openly in a
park, in one instance brazenly in a public ladies' room, where
they consummate their affection with utter freedom.  All the
while Diane must try to get one of her authors, Francois (Nils
Tavernier) to overcome writers' block--he claims he cannot
understand a woman's desires.  Conveniently enough, Diane
has a new experience to help him over the hurdles.
   In a fascinating subplot involving the gruesome and sudden
murder of a cheating man by his wife of 43 years, Madame
Lepluche (Francoise Arnoul), Rouann, successfully adapting
the screenplay she wrote with four others, shows us yet
another way a mouse can lose his head by chasing tail. 
Helpfully, Mme. Lepluche is defended in court by Diane's
loving husband Philippe (Patrick Chesnais), and will be able
to use his own cuckoldry to try to move the jury.
   "Post Coitum Animal Triste," which bears the French title
"Un Certain Regard," closed the 50th Cannes International
Film Festival 1997 before being screened at New York's own
annual festival.  It includes one visual which is particularly
humorous of Diane literally floating on a cloud while in the
throes of her new passion and a convincing chemistry
between Diane and the lover who is twenty years her junior. 
The enormous trouble which marital betrayal brings hits home
in this movie through both a swift but graphic murder scene
involving a woman who stabs her cheating husband in the
neck with a carving fork--and the break-up of Diane's own
family through her own mad fling.  "Post Coitum" is wonderful
at bringing out an adage repeated by Diane: "When you're
twenty and love goes wrong, you cry because you think you'll
never love anyone again.  After 40, you cry because it's far
more likely that you never will again." Not Rated.  Running
Time: 95 minutes.  (C) 1997 Harvey Karten</P>
