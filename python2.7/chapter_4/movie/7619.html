<P>DIRECTOR SIDNEY LUMET'S LATEST FILM COVERS FAMILIAR TERRITORY WITH A NEW
TWIST </P>
<P>His first big screen film as a director came in 1957 with '12 Angry Men' and
he was already showing dimensions of talent that would place him in film
history as one one Hollywood's most searing and dramatic filmmakers.
 Throughout they years that have passed since then his other films such as
'Long Day's Journey Into Night' (1962), 'The Pawnbroker' (1965), 'Serpico'
(1973), 'Dog Day Afternoon' (1975), 'Network' (1976) 'Prince of the City'
(1981) 'The Verdict' (1982) and many others have served not only as obvious
social commentary but as scorching indictments of the 'system'.  His name is
Sidney Lumet, a man with a mind as diverse as the subject matter he
successfully tackles and rarely does he miss the mark.  </P>
<P>His latest effort 'Night Falls on Manhattan' shows signs of a well seasoned
mind ready to bring an old story to the screen with a very new twist.  Based
on the novel 'Tainted Evidence' by Robert Daley it focuses on a police
officer turned lawyer (Andy Garcia) who wins an important case as an
assistant D.A. for the city of New York in the trial of a major drug dealer
and is nominated to run as head D.A. when the one in office (Ron Liebman)
suffers medical problems.  During the trial that made his career he butts
heads in court with a liberal, idealistic defense attorney (Richard Dreyfuss)
and falls romantically for Dreyfuss' assistant (Lena Olin).  This needless
romantic subplot is about the only thing that's really not necessary to the
film's success.  Garcia's father (Ian Holm) and his father's partner (James
Gandolfini) are under suspicion as rogue cops who may have accepted money
from the dealer convicted by Garcia and the story gains depth and subtext
better than practically any other film released so far this year with a top
notch cast in fine form all around.</P>
<P>What makes 'Night in Manhattan' such a credible and well textured film is the
fact that Lumet served not only as the film's director but worked directly
from the adapted screenplay he wrote on his own without anyone else's point
of view disrupting his work and does justice to Robert Daley's novel in the
process.  With overtones of 'Serpico' mixed in as well, Lumet has not
duplicated his own success but has created a film brimming with emotional,
moral and legal factors that are credible and ones that make us shake our
heads while watching the evening news or looking at our daily newspapers.</P>
