<PRE>                                 THE FAN
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1996) ** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        I'm sure this seemed like a good movie somewhere along 
the line. But then sh*t hit THE FAN, turning a surefire success into 
cliche-ridden thriller crap. Robert DeNiro has played some good 
crazies in his time, from TAXI DRIVER and the 1991 remake of 
CAPE FEAR to his star-stalking fan in THE KING OF COMEDY. 
Now he's the baseball player-stalking fan out to make sure Wesley 
Snipes gives credit where credit is due. This is all retread territory, 
from DeNiro as the stalker to Snipes as the baseball player. Or 
have we forgotten a lame 80's comedy called MAJOR LEAGUE?</P>
<P>        Watch the commercials for THE FAN and you'll know 
where it's headed in thirty seconds. But it takes over an hour for 
the actual movie to go anywhere. No, we have to watch DeNiro 
DeGenerate from a knife salesman to an unemployed lunatic, and 
we have to watch Snipes suffer through a severe slump after being 
signed to a $40 million contract with the San Francisco Giants. 
There are more unnecessary expository scenes than you can 
count and we even have to sit through Aaron Neville's rendition 
of the national anthem on opening day. I wondered for a few 
minutes why they chose Neville before realizing DeNiro probably 
demanded they put someone with a bigger mole than him in the 
movie.</P>
<P>        Meanwhile, the supporting players worm their way into 
the movie. John Leguizamo, el mexicano tokeno, plays Snipes' agent 
and best friend. Ellen Barkin plays the "ball-busting" radio reporter 
who serves no other purpose than to display her new Aniston 
haircut. She runs the call-in show that DeNiro frequently runs his 
mouth on.</P>
<P>        You see, DeNiro is completely obsessed with the game 
and has a Shrine-O-Snipes in his house. So it's only natural that, 
after another player (Benicio Del Toro) gets on a winning streak 
that Snipes attributes to his wearing the number 11 on his uniform, 
DeNiro sneak into the steam room and stab Del Toro in the leg with 
one of his company's knives, as a free demonstration of their quality, 
of course. Up to that point, there's no action whatsoever in THE 
FAN.</P>
<P>        And after that point, the movie still doesn't get any better. 
That's when Snipes starts hitting again but tells DeNiro it's because 
he stopped caring, the cardinal sin for DeNiro. Not only do you 
care about the game, you also thank the psychos who kill off your 
competition, something Snipes apparently never learned in the 
minors. Now he's got a crazed ex-pitcher on his hands, an ex-pitcher 
who knows the one thing in the world Snipes cares about is his 
son. So guess what DeNiro does to the son? Imagine a kid taking 
a nap and the answer will come to you.</P>
<P>        There's not a single move in THE FAN that isn't apparent 
several scenes before it happens. The whole time I was waiting for 
the movie to catch up to me, but it never did. I was on third base 
by the time the movie was on first. Not only was it unoriginal and 
predictable but the cutting-edge tilted camera angles got on my 
nerves before the first reel was up. That stuff can benefit a movie 
aesthetically only if it's used sparingly. Film every scene that way 
and it becomes annoying.</P>
<P>        Normally you can count on DeNiro and Snipes both to 
appear in high-quality movies but not even the best all-stars hit 
home runs all the time. With an average like theirs, though, you 
can forgive the occasional strike-out, which is exactly what THE 
FAN is.</P>
