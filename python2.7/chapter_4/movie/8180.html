                         FEELING MINNESOTA 1996
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon</PRE>
<P>Cast: Keanu Reeves, Vince D'Onofrio, Cameron Diaz, Dan Aykroyd, Delroy
Lindo, Tuesday Weld, Michael Rispoli, Courtney Love Director: Steven
Baigleman Screenplay: Steven Baigleman</P>
<P>I'm trying to think of a saving, good point to make about this movie,
but unfortunately I can't. Keanu Reeves choice of movies seems to be
getting from bad to worse.</P>
<P>Think of all the bad things in life like petrol station hold ups,
murdering family members, blackmail, corrupt police, and dysfunctional
relationships - this is the ugly feeling that 'Feeling Minnesota' leaves
you with.</P>
<P>The older brother (D'Onofrio) forces a young girl to marry him. The
younger brother (Reeves) arrives on the wedding day, sleeps with his
newly-wed sister-in-law (Diaz) and runs away with her. She instigates
the younger brother to steal from the older brother, who then shoots her
in a jealous rage. She survives, sleeps with the corrupt policeman
(Ackroyd) investigating the crime, before escaping to Las Vegas with the
money.</P>
<P>Some people will say, well that's life. Sure, but it's also meant to be
a movie, and it's not even entertaining.</P>
<P>Comment: This movie only serves to give Minnesota a bad name.</P>
