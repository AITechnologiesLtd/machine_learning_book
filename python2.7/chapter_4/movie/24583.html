Gladiator (8/10)</PRE>
<P>If ever a genre was dead beyond hope, the sword-and-sandal epic was it.
Who on earth would consider making such a film again, and, more to the
point, who could raise the mountain of cash required to make such a
movie? Director Ridley Scott and Dreamworks, that's who. If Gladiator
had been a monumental flop, everyone would have shaken their heads and
commented on the amazing stupidity of the whole idea. "Who wants to see
a gladiator movie? A gladiator movie ferchrissakes!" Well actually,
based on the film's performance at the box office, we do. Forget the
cheesy and homoerotic Steve Reeves movies that inspired the pilot in
Airplane! to ask "Do you like gladiator movies?", this is a full-blooded
action drama for real men. Quiche-eaters should stay away.</P>
<P>The film opens with Maximus (Russell Crowe) about to launch the attack
that will seal victory in the Roman empire's campaign in Germania. The
dying emperor (Richard Harris) intends to end the line of imperial
succession and restore the republic, and he calls on his friend Maximus
to use his army to protect the new government. The emperor's son
Commodus (Joachim Phoenix) has no intention of relinquishing his
birthright, and assumes power as the new emperor. Instead of being the
protector of Rome, Maximus finds himself a slave, competing as a
gladiator and nursing the mother of all grudges against Commodus.</P>
<P>Action heroes of the recent past have tended to be musclebound airheads.
Russell Crowe is a new breed: a believable hero whose pores ooze dignity
and testosterone in equal measure. Crowe's effectiveness on screen is
nothing to do with time spent in the gym - he's built like a pretty
average guy - but has everything to do with being a magnificent actor
who can excel in physical roles. Joachim Phoenix is an effective slimy
scheming villain, but he sometimes delivers lines so flatly it's as if a
take from a read-through made it into the final cut by mistake. Oliver
Reed, who plays Maximus's owner and trainer, died during production and
in one scene a performance had to be coaxed from a pseudo-Ollie
fashioned from a body-double and some fancy CGI work. Reed's public
image was, probably unfairly, that of an appalling drunken buffoon, but
at least his career ended on a high note - he has rarely been better
than he is here. At one point his character tells Maximus, "I'm an
entertainer." He was certainly that, and he could not have chosen a more
appropriate film to be his last.</P>
<P>The scenes of gladiatorial combat are breathtaking. Limbs are hacked,
heads are smashed, torsos are skewered and the air is full of blood.
Comparisons have been made between the combat sequences in Gladiator and
the Normandy landing sequence in Saving Private Ryan, but the approaches
are completely different. Whereas Spielberg used camera and post-
production techniques to give the combat scenes the look of a
documentary and presented the carnage as might a journalist - there it
is, now look at it - Ridley Scott never dwells on the blood and gore,
but instead uses an impressionistic approach to give flashes of brutal
savagery and cutting away immediately. Not only does this solve problems
with scissor-happy censors, it's very effective - in this form of
combat, a new mortal threat is hardly more than 1/24 of a second away,
so there's no time to waste dwelling on the mess you've just made of
another person's body. The smell of fear and sweat and blood leaks from
the screen. The battle sequence that opens the film is equally
impressive. Shot in a gloomy and muddy English forest, the scale and
savagery of the fighting makes for heart-pounding movie-going.</P>
<P>The CGI team worked their magic in creating a completely convincing
interior for the Colosseum. When the gladiators first enter the arena,
they are amazed at the scale and spectacle of what they are seeing. As
they look up and around this vast amphitheatre, the viewpoint tracks
around them and as we see the entire stadium with its thousands of
spectators, we share the gladiators' amazement. The film also benefits
from John Mathieson's photography and the stirring musical score, mainly
by Hans Zimmer, which borrows from varied sources, notably the Mars
segment of Holst's suite The Planets. </P>
<P>The script (by David Franzoni, John Logan and William Nicholson) sticks
to genre conventions and gives the characters plenty of overwritten
stagey dialogue in which to plot their various intrigues and revenges.
Maybe that's the way it has to be in this sort of movie. If centurions
and emperors talked like real people, the whole thing might,
paradoxically, become less believable. I don't know if any general would
really say "at my command, unleash hell" - but it's great stuff. And as
is usual with such traditional epics, there is plenty of chat between
the memorable set pieces, but the film hardly ever drags - we are really
made to care about Maximus, through his fall and rise and eventual...
well I'll only say that the script provides a satisfying but poignant
resolution, only slightly spoiled by the implausibility of the final
showdown. </P>
<P>Although the script could have been written during Hollywood's last
fling with this genre nearly forty years ago, Gladiator is still a
technically astonishing entertainment of the most spectacular kind and
demands to be seen on the biggest screen you can get to.</P>
