<PRE>ZERO EFFECT
RATING:  6 / 10 --> Barely recommendable</PRE>
<P>Jake Kasdan, son of legendary screenwriter/director Lawrence Kasdan,
writes and directs his first picture entitled ZERO EFFECT at the tender
age of 23. </P>
<P>PLOT:
The world's most "private" detective Daryl Zero is hired by a rich man
named Stark, to find his lost keys to a security box which contains
information that could be used against him, and to figure out the
identity of the person who is also blackmailing him. Zero's faithful
assistant, Arlo, acts as the middleman between the two men, since dick
Zero does not believe in meeting his clients. Let the unraveling begin.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Quirky, original, but ultimately overlong and not so interesting tale
of the self-proclaimed "world's greatest private investigator." Bill
Pullman has never really excited me in any of his works (even my
favourite film of 1997, LOST HIGHWAY (8.5/10)), and continues to do his
humdrum work in this "trying to be hip" crime film, that never really
grabs a hold of anyone or anything. The film's premise is certainly
very cute, with the detective not wanting to meet any of his clients,
and being some sort of an acutely sensitive psycho-analyst who could
tell almost everything about a person after meeting them for only
thirty seconds. </P>
<P>But ultimately, the film's plot and execution never really generate
enough drama, interest or zing to keep the film enjoyable at any level.
It seemed like a quirky film at times, a crime drama at others, and
ultimately degenerated into some half-assed romantic crime tale, which
didn't seem to know which end was up anymore. There were some original
points in the script, and even some clever moments about the detective,
his methods and motivations, but not enough to constitute anything
close to a successful movie.</P>
<P>Even Ben Stiller seemed wasted in his underplayed role of the assistant
who was torn between his love and his job. On top of everything, the
film packed it in a little under the two-hour mark, without justifying
at least thirty minutes of that lengthy total. In the end, I believe
that your enjoyment of this film will be strongly correlated to your
appreciation of the work of Bill Pullman, your desire to see
experimental films that may quirk your interest, and the unimportance
of the money that you are willing to invest in this video pick. If all
three traffic lights seem green to you, then please go ahead and watch
this movie and try to enjoy your time on board. If your interest is not
peaked by my guidelines, then I suggest you go out and rent the
ultimate hip, quirky, crime film: RESERVOIR DOGS (9/10), by Quentin
Tarantino, and have a blast! </P>
<P>Little Known Facts: 
Bill Pullman made his big screen debut in the Danny DeVito / Bette
Midler comedy RUTHLESS PEOPLE (7.5/10) in 1986 and followed that with
two lead roles in SPACEBALLS (8/10) and THE SERPENT AND THE RAINBOW.
Pullman has a Master of Arts in theater studies, and while teaching at
Montana State University, one of his students was director John Dahl,
who subsequently gave him a role in his 1994 film THE LAST SEDUCTION
(7.5/10). 
Ryan O'Neal is the father of actress Tatum O'Neal, who was once married
to tennis great John McEnroe.</P>
