<PRE>THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong

<P>I'll admit up front that I've only become a big fan of the James Bond films 
after I saw GoldenEye.  I've seen one or two Sean Connery Bond films, one 
Moore, and all of the Dalton ones.  Strangely, it was Dalton's Bond that 
truly introduced me to the Bond franchise.  But, it was Brosnan's Bond that 
got me hooked.  Dalton's Bond was, well, terrible.  Brosnan is the better 
Bond.  And to stir some controversy, I think that Brosnan is a better Bond 
than Connery, I think that Brosnan is the best Bond of all.</P>
<P>So, it is to no surprise that I loved The World is Not Enough.  It's a 
Don't Miss film, packed with action, intrigue, and well, everything that 
we've come to expect from a Bond film:  "Bond, James Bond", "Shaken, not 
stirred", M, Q, beautiful women with funny names, and heaps of sexual 
innuendo.  Brosnan's Bond films have revitalized the Bond franchise.   With 
each film getting better, The World is Not Enough is the best of the three 
Brosnan Bond films.</P>
<P>The storyline is convoluted and in the tradition of Bond storylines, it 
needs a lot of suspension of disbelief.  I must say though, the story was a 
little more fleshed out than other Bond films, especially the 
characterizations.  More on that later.  An oil tycoon is killed and Bond 
is asked by M (Judi Dench) to protect his daughter, Electra King (Sophie 
Marceau), because she may well be the next victim.  The terrorist that 
killed Electra's father is a man named Renard (Robert Carlyle), who lives 
after having a bullet lodged into his brain by another MI6 agent.  The 
bullet is killing Renard slowly, but with everyday it is lodged in his 
brain, he becomes stronger - don't see Bond films for medical class.  It 
seems that Renard has bigger plans than just killing Electra.  Somehow, in 
this entire story a physicist, Dr. Christmas Jones (Denise Richards), gets 
sucked into being Bond's sidekick.  (Yes, I know what you're saying, 
"Denise Richards?  A physicist?"  Yes, it's true.)  So, Bond must save the 
world from Renard and someone else, which you'll find out in the film, but 
it's not too hard to figure out.  There are other little sub-plots in the 
film and they are, though light in treatment, well written.  There is also 
an introduction of a new character to the franchise, R (John Cleese), which 
seems to be Q's (Desmond Llelewyn) replacement.</P>
<P>If you've seen the last two Brosnan Bond outings and liked them, you'll 
absolutely love The World is Not Enough.  There are enough explosions, 
gunfire, and chases to make your heart glow.  The film opens, like all Bond 
films, with a well-executed action sequence.  The one in The World is Not 
Enough is an extended sequence that starts in an office goes to boats in 
the Thames and ends in a hot air balloon.  Quite a rousing start to the 
film with the action gets better from there.</P>
<P>Brosnan is cast perfectly as Bond.  He has just enough of a sly boyish 
charm to fill the shoes of Bond.  Yet he has a detached front to all of 
it.  This time around, Brosnan has gotten the role down pat, maybe gotten 
it down just a little too well.  At times Brosnan seems to be bored with 
the role and looks as if he's just going through the motions.  At other 
times though, Brosnan seems to be going all out with the role - look at the 
scene with Brosnan and the sunglasses in the casino.  He's mixed in this 
outing, but he's still the best Bond in my mind.</P>
<P>Carlyle is cast as the villain in this film, but he is only half the 
badness of the film.  And, well, he's not the memorable half of the 
badness.  Known mostly, in America at least, for his part in The Full 
Monty, Carlyle's part feels padded.  His part is wholly forgettable and 
underwritten.  He also doesn't have enough menace in him to be scary on 
screen, at least not enough to be a good villain.  Carlyle does what he can 
with his role.</P>
<P>Marceau is the standout performer of the film.  She gives such depth to her 
Bond-girl role that the role can't even be called so.  She is classy in the 
role, giving it a full and rich performance that will be remembered for a 
while - and that is saying a lot since, as you may remember, this is a Bond 
film!  Kudos to Marceau for putting such great effort into her character.</P>
<P>And, well, finally there's Denise Richards.  She can't act worth a lick and 
I think the only reason she's in the film is so that she can run around in 
tight t-shirts, tight shorts, and tight pants - getting the box-office grab 
from the male audience.  Oh, and not to forget, she also gets a scene in a 
wet white t-shirt.  Yes, Richards is the true Bond-girl of The World is Not 
Enough.  She fills the role OK.  She really can't act, but she does seem to 
be putting in a good effort and it looks like she's having fun with the 
role.  Her role is fairly thin and her lines are even worse.  But, I guess 
she's there for eye candy and she works well as so.</P>
<P>The film is directed by Michael Apted, who is better known for his 
documentaries (7 Up series) and non-action films (Nell).  Apted does just 
fine as the director of this film.  Putting together some finely crafted 
action sequences that get the adrenaline pumping.  I loved the opening 
sequence, the skiing sequence, and the caviar sequence.  They are all well 
done.  Apted is a notch better at action direction than Tomorrow Never Dies 
director Roger Spottiswoode.  The cinematographer, Adrian Biddle (Aliens, 
Thema and Louise), works well with Apted and the film is strikingly 
beautiful.  Maybe for Bond 20 the producers can sign John Woo into for the 
director's chair and see how much better the action can be.  The three 
Brosnan Bond films have been directed by directors not really known for 
directing action (Martin Campbell, Roger Spottiswoode, and Michael 
Apted).  I'd love to see what kind of Bond film would come out of it being 
directed by a director strictly known for his action work.</P>
<P>What needs to be noticed in this film is the score by David Arnold 
(Stargate, Independence Day, Tomorrow Never Dies).  Eric Serra scored the 
first Brosnan Bond film, GoldenEye.  Serra took the stance that John 
Barry's Bond theme was old, worn out, and, well, wouldn't work for the new 
Bond films.  Serra's generic score for GoldenEye didn't do the film 
justice.  Serra dead wrong about Barry's Bond theme.  Arnold proved Serra 
wrong with his score to Tomorrow Never Dies, weaving Barry's Bond theme 
into an original score, making the score reminiscent of Bond without 
copying Barry outright.  Arnold's score for Tomorrow Never Dies took me 
aback.  The day before the release of The World is Not Enough, I bought 
Arnold's score for the film.  Arnold has outdone his Tomorrow Never Dies 
score with his The World is Not Enough score.  This score is wholly 
original, yet it draws enough from Barry's Bond theme that it seems quite 
familiar.  The Bond feeling is back in the score and it works really well 
with the film.  Kudos to Arnold for putting together a wonderful score.</P>
<P>Bottom line?  Don't Miss The World is Not Enough.  This is the best Bond 
film to date.</P>
