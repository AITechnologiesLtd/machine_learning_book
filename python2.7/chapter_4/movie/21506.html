<P>   Can't you just see it now... a reprise of the old joke about
the Robert Redford appearance in "Indecent Proposal"?  As
the predominantly female audience stream out of a screening
of "The Bachelor," one sweet one thing turns to her friend
and wonders, "Would you marry Chris O'Donnell for one
hundred million dollars?"  "Sure," her friend replies quickly,
"But you'll have to give me a few weeks to raise the money."</P>
<P>   Obviously, as with "Indecent Proposal," the situation is
reversed.  The O'Donnell character must find a woman to
marry him in less than 24 hours.  Whoever accepts the
proposal and says "I do" within that time gets to share an
estate worth a hundred mil.  Would one of the handsomest
young men in Hollywood, attached to such a fortune as well,
have the slightest problem getting the job done?  You
wouldn't think so, and indeed, hundreds upon hundreds of
eligible females turn up within minutes of hearing of the offer,
competing vigorously for his hand in marriage.  Oddly
enough, though, the handful of people he could live with
reject both him and his lucrative offer.</P>
<P>    If you think this sounds like the basis for a rollicking
comedy, you'd be on the money.  In fact, the thought is
hardly original.  One guy had a ball with the theme in a movie
he directed and starred in about a man who must be married
by 7:00 the very evening if he is to inherit a fortune, but a
miscommunication with his girlfriend leads to his pursuit by
thousands of would-be brides.  If you remember seeing this
film when it first came out, well dearie, as the Ethel Merman
song goes, you're much older than I.  We're talking Buster
Keaton in "Seven Chances" (1925), which had a great role for
young Jean Arthur, the girl of his dreams who turns him
down.</P>
<P>   Now, however, in blazing color with a hefty budget of
perhaps a third of that whole estate, New Line Cinema has
come out with an old-fashioned comedy that shouldn't work
but does, thanks to adorable performances by Chris
O'Donnell as swinging bachelor Jimmie Shannon and Renee
Zellweger as his dreamgirl, Anne.  When Jimmie's eccentric
grandfather (Peter Ustinov) dies and leaves his entire estate
to Jimmie--provided that Jimmy marry no later than 6:05 p.m.
on his thirtieth birthday (which occurs in 24 hours)--you'd
think that the two lovebirds could quickly and happily tie the
knot.  But Jimmie, a freedom-loving guy in no hurry to be tied
down, had previously messed up.  When he had first
proposed to Anne, he made clear by his body language and
unromantic vernacular as well that he was not really ready for
the big step.  Since "The Bachelor" is a romantic comedy,
Anne turns him down, leaving Jimmie to spend the rest of the
story hoping to get together again--which is what people in
romantic comedies try to do.</P>
<P>   The plot is contrived as all get-out and the story is as old-
fashioned as anything that Capra has ever done, but if you
suspend disbelief--as all veteran moviegoers can do without
being asked--you're in for a fun time in San Francisco.  You'll
watch as Jimmie's best friend Marco (Artie Lange) plays
Cyrano, doing what he can to round up the right person for
Jimmie to marry.  Director Gary Sinyor, working with a lighter-
than-air script from Steve Cohen, makes clear to us that
Jimmie may be stubbornly independent but he's not selfish. 
If he does not get his hands on the dough, the plant he had
inherited would be sold out from under him leaving a couple
of hundred workers out of jobs, including Marco.</P>
<P>   Aside from the penultimate scene featuring a chase up and
down the San Francisco hills that resembles a rough July day
in Pamplona, the most fun comes from the proposals that
Jimmie makes to a few individuals he had dated in the past,
each wholly different in temperament from the others. 
Foremost of these is a bid for the hand of Buckley, played by
an unrecognizable Brooke Shields.  Buckley, as opportunistic
as they come, is a poised debutante perfectly willing to marry
in an instant--until she discovers that she will have to live
under the same roof as her husband for ten years and have
at least one kid with him.  A clever parody of radical feminism
issues from a skit with perpetual student Carolyn (Sarah
Silverman), who tosses out the usual cliches against
marriage (a property transfer from father to husband; roses
are a metaphoric sexual organ designed to seduce),
prompting the frustrated Jimmie to cry out "I'm not interested
in your vagina...I just want you to marry me!"</P>
<P>   Renee Zellweger plays the usual ditzy self that has been
her hallmark since her great success in "Jerry Maguire"
(though her best role was as a Hasidic woman in "A Price
Above Rubies") and Chris O'Donnell will draw in the women
for this delightful bit of fluff.  A visual metaphor that seems
heavy-handed but is at least original involves a frequent cut
to a racing band of wild stallions, representing the allegedly
joyous freedom of bachelorhood.</P>
