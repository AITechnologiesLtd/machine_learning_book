<PRE>Disturbing Behavior
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring James Marsden; Katie Holmes; Nich Stahl; Ethan Embry & Natassia
Maltke</P>
<P>Disturbing Behavior is your typical teen oriented horror flick. It's
certainly not going down as one of the classics in the genre. To be
perfectly honest, probably the only reason it will be remembered is because
of the presence of Katie Holmes. While her performance isn't quite as good
as fan's of her TV show Dawson's Creek might have come to expect from her,
she does make the most of the material that she has to work with. As do the
rest of the fairly talented, if not exceptional, young cast.</P>
<P>Steve Clark (James Marsden) and his family move to a small Pacific Northwest
community where something seems just a little to good to be true about some
of the local high school students. They are high over achievers and very
community oriented. They also have the tendency to become homicidal on
occasion (nobody's perfect). Like every school, this one also has its less
than perfect students. They are the leather clad, drinking and smoking (not
necessarily cigarettes) bunch, who aren't exactly on the honor role. Their
numbers seem to be diminishing slowly as many of them are joining the ranks
of the preppy elite in the school. This is all due to the influence of the
school guidance counselor who is doing a little experimenting on his
students. The basis of this movie is how Marsden and his new friend the
leather- clad Katie Holmes run head on into the preppies.</P>
<P>First, I should start by saying that Katie Holmes in leather is more than an
adequate reason for me to recommend this movie. If that isn't enough for you
(and I can't see why it wouldn't be), I'll give the movie a couple of more
points in the win column. As I've already alluded to, the acting is solid,
and is certainly better than most films of this genre, although not quite up
to films such as Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer. This is a good
looking film, very well photographed, and the Pacific Northwest scenery is
used to full advantage. At least to the extent that it looks god in the
daylight shots. Which, as horror fans know, are few and far between in
horror flicks.</P>
<P>The basic premise of the movie is a pretty tired one. The population slowly
being converted into something else has been done more times than I care to
imagine. There are really not a great deal of new twists that make it
considerably different from other films of this type. Even though it's not
particularly original, it does add enough twists to keep your interest
through the whole movie. Not exactly ringing endorsements, but considering
the horror films of just a few years ago (pre Scream), this could almost be
considered a masterpiece.</P>
<P>If taken for what it is, a formula horror flick, Disturbing Behavior isn't
half bad. My guess is 10 years from now the only reason that anyone will
remember this is for the fact that it was one of the very talented Katie
Holmes' first starring roles.</P>
