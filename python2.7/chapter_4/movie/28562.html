<P>crazy/beautiful tries awfully hard not to be formulaic but fails miserably
in the process.  It's not like we haven't seen this story before - the whole
girl-falling-for-the-boy-she-isn't-supposed-to-love thing can be traced at
least as far back as Romeo and Juliet and as recently as Save the Last
Dance.  crazy is so similar to Dance - the story of a painfully white blonde
girl and dark-skinned boy from a poor neighborhood - that one critic has
already dubbed the film Save the Last Burrito, because, in this picture, the
boy is played by a Latino actor.</P>
<P>crazy's opening credits show us a collage of arty photographs (like Dance,
this cracker also has a creative outlet - photography) before we meet our
two romantic leads.  Carlos Nuñez (Jay Hernandez, MTV's Undressed) spots a
fair-haired cutie picking up trash as part of a community service sentence
for robbing a convenience store.  She is Nicole Oakley (Kirsten Dunst, Get
Over It), a classmate of Carlos' at the predominantly white Pacific High.
She lives in giant glass house overlooking the ocean; he lives in the barrio
and has to take a two-hour bus trip (uphill both ways) just to attend
Pacific.</P>
<P>But wait, there's more.  Nicole's neglectful father is a U.S. Congressman
(Bruce Davison, X-Men) and she's a real problem child.  Daddy can't seem to
get his bleary-eyed, belly-baring beauty to stop drinking, drugging, banging
loads of different guys, or mouthing off to her young stepmother (Lucinda
Jenney, Thirteen Days).  Meanwhile, Carlos is a football star with an Oscar
de la Hoya smile who plans on becoming a Navy pilot (even though he's never
stepped foot on a plane) and has a closet-sized bedroom (complete with bare
light bulb) as well as a very supportive family.  Get it?  It's a twist on
the typical good-girl-dating-the-boy-from-the-wrong-side-of-the-tracks
story.</P>
<P>But wait, there's still more!  When Nicole and her dog-faced girlfriend
(Taryn Manning) drive Carlos back to the barrio for the first time, they
aren't all, like, "Oh my God - these street signs are all in Spanish!"
Instead, the girls hop out of the car and give a lap dance to each patron of
a taco cart.  When Nicole's dad gives Carlos the "Stay away from my
daughter" speech, he's not doing it because he's a racist - he's doing it
because he thinks his daughter is going to screw up this boy's obviously
bright future.</P>
<P>You know, if you really want to break the stereotypes found in these types
of films, do something drastic.  Make the guy the popular black quarterback
and the girl the slutty, pregnant daughter of a drunken crack whore.
Afflict one of them with AIDS.  Make one a serial killer.  Or at least have
a couple of the over-30 Latino females clock in under 300 pounds.  Even
though some of the specifics have changed, crazy is still the same-old
same-old.  If it's a hit, like Dance, you should expect to see a film where
a lily-white poet played by Kate Hudson falls for an Asian gangster played
by Rick Yune.</P>
<P>As bad as Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi's script is (they're both feature-film
rookies), crazy is made somewhat palatable by director John Stockwell, who
wrote and helmed the enjoyable HBO film Cheaters.  crazy is filled with
interesting shot composition and editing, often using nice montages to get
its tiresome point across.  The film also has a bunch of TRL-ready songs,
some of which are embarrassingly effective.  But it's all easily forgotten
by the laughable ending.</P>
<P>Hernandez does well in what should be a breakout role.  Dunst is a great
actress, and she gets a couple of scenes to show off her chops here, but if
you compare any of her weepy drug-addled rants to Traffic's Erika
Christensen, they just don't measure up.</P>
<P>1:35 - PG-13 for mature thematic material involving teens, drug/alcohol
content, sexuality & language</P>
