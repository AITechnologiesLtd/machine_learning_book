<PRE>Inspector Gadget (PG) **
Starring Matthew Broderick, Rupert Everett
Directed by David Kellogg
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Inspector Gadget is another one of my favorite cartoons. Rugrats and Doug have
been made into movies, why not this classic series? However, Disney decides to
take the production another way. This Inspector Gadget is a live action super
crime fighting machine. He's always in control, he's not stupid, and the whole
Mission Impossible bit from the TV show is completely lost.</P>
<P>Broderick is a security guard one night when Brenda (Joely Fisher) and her
father have been working on creating a fully robotic anamatronic crime fighting
machine, Claw (Rupert Everett) breaks in to steal their prototype foot and they
break into a chase. Broderick is sent to intensive care, but not before hitting
Claw's hand with a bowling ball.</P>
<P>Claw then proceeds, (with the help of mad scientist Andy Dick) to create a
clone of Gadget.  He's decked out with guns and other killing machines, his
mission is to destroy the original Gadget. Claw's idea is to make everyone in
the world pay for his killing machines so he can become rich. Add a couple of
bad spoofs and you've got another bad Disney movie.</P>
<P>Plus, this movie loses all sight of the original cartoon. It throws in a
miscast Michelle Trachtenberg as Penny, D.L. Hughley as a talking car, and
Dabney Coleman as the chief of police. There however is enough content here to
make this movie watchable, the gadgets are pretty cool, and some of the humor
is funny, (the was extremely surprised to find no fart and poop jokes) this is
mostly credited to Cheri Oteri who plays the town's glamorous, if not
dim-witted major.</P>
<P>So why would I give this movie ** stars you ask? Stay for the credits! There
are two scenes, one in particular (where we get to hear Brain talk) that make
up (at least for me) almost the entire movie. If your kids drag you to it, it
won't be that painful, but I still give it ** stars.</P>
