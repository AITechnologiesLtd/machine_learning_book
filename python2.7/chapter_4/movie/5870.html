<PRE>                              DOWN PERISCOPE
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1996) *1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        Even the best comic actor is at the mercy of his or her 
material, as this subpar submarine comedy proves. DOWN 
PERISCOPE stars Kelsey "Frasier" Grammer as an inept Navy 
captain who is given command of his own ship as part of a corrupt 
officer's (James Coburn) plan to get him out of the Navy. Like any 
lame emsemble comedy, the officer assigns him to a group of misfits 
like the guy who wants to be kicked out, the fat guy who eats all the 
time, the beautiful woman who doesn't belong there (Lauren Holly), 
the second-in-command who does everything by the book (Rob 
Schneider), the crazy old guy who freaks everyone out (Harry Dean 
Stanton) and so on.</P>
<P>        Then comes the transparent plotline. First Grammer has to 
fix up the delapidated Korean War ship the Navy has given him, 
and that comes courtesy a sad sight gag montage that includes a 
guy with a mop knocking Schneider overboard. After the ship is 
fixed up come the early drills, where everyone seems completely 
inept, like the electrician who can't connect wires so instead lets 
the current run through himself every time Grammer gets on the 
phone.</P>
<P>        Finally, and this covers the final hour of the movie, 
Grammer has to lead his men (and Holly) to overcome the other 
ships in a wargames exercise. And he has to be a clever rebel to 
do it, in scenes that stretch all levels of believability. First they're 
singing "Louie Louie" like a bunch of drunk sailors to throw the 
radar of the other ship off, then thirty minutes later, they're making 
whale mating noises to throw the radar of the other ship off. The 
whole while, Evil Captain Coburn is overacting underwater, 
cursing Grammer (as most people watching the movie probably 
are too).</P>
<P>        It's all predictable without any original humor to redeem 
it. The jokes are right out of "McHale's Navy" and other cut-rate 
sitcoms of the past. There's one scene where Schneider looks 
through the ship's pantry in disgust, holds one food can up and 
announces, "This expired in 1966!" I yelled back at the screen, 
"So did these jokes." I watched this movie with the whole family 
and everyone hated it. My mom was so bored she brought out 
the coupon book midway through and, around the start of the 
second hour, I started writing my will.</P>
<P>        The blame can't really be placed on the stars, though. 
Kelsey Grammer is good in this, he just doesn't have anything 
to work with. His character is said to have gotten so drunk one 
night that he had "Welcome Aboard" tatooed on his penis. Grammer 
probably did something even worse -- got really drunk and agreed to 
appear in a movie he knew nothing about. Same for Holley (save the 
penis part), who is likeable in DOWN PERISCOPE just because 
she's so gorgeous. As for Schneider (whose character is downright 
annoying), there was nowhere to go but up after SURF NINJAS, 
although he's still in the depths of the comedy ocean after jumping 
the "SNL" ship.</P>
<P>        My theory is that DOWN PERISCOPE is one of those 
movies that got the green light before the script was even written 
as a formula comedy ("Okay, it's POLICE ACADEMY in the Navy 
with Frasier at the helm and the chick from DUMB AND 
DUMBER.") and after everyone was signed on turned into a 
disaster. Judging from the video box, most other movie critics 
agree with me. The only quote the DOWN PERISCOPE copy writers 
could dig up came from the Prevue channel's Jim Ferguson. I guess 
even Jeff Craig from "60 Second Preview" (who said TANK GIRL 
"kicks butt!" without ever seeing it) didn't like this.</P>
