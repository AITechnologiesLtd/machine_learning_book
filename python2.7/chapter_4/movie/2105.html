<PRE>                                THE PIANO
                       A film review by Max Hoffman
                        Copyright 1993 Max Hoffman</PRE>
<P>Seen in English with French subtitles at the Gaumont Gran Ecran Cinema, 
Place d' Italia, Paris</P>
<P>Rating: (1 to 10) ... "off the scale"...  Rated "RV" for "required viewing"</P>
<P>     Since causing a seven-minute standing ovation at its world
premiere in Cannes this year, Jane Campion's film has sent waves of
anticipation across the Atlantic for its impending opening in North
America.  Upon seeing it, you may wonder if seven minutes was enough
recognition for this brilliant film!  Campion (ANGEL AT MY TABLE,
SWEETIE) earned her Palm d' Or award (the first ever for a woman
director) for this brilliant, timeless film.  THE PIANO is destined to
join the pantheon of classics inhabited by CHILDREN OF THE PARADISE,
SHOP ON MAIN STREET, THE HEIRESS, and CITIZEN KANE.  Its simple
dignity and heart stopping beauty will literally take your breath
away.</P>
<P>     Campion's deft direction and brilliantly original screenplay have
drawn stunning performances from the unlikely cast of Holly Hunter, Sam
Neill and Harvey Keitel.  (After RESERVOIR DOGS and THE BAD LIEUTENANT,
the last place you'd expect to see Keitel is in a reverently hushed Art
House....)  The three leads form a love triangle, centered around a
mute woman, (whose unbreakable will transforms all of the
participants).  Campion exercises remarkable skill in keeping the
amazing performances subdued enough to not overpower the beautifully
tender story-line.</P>
<P>     Holly Hunter's heart-stopping, speechless performance demands
multiple viewings, and could well become a text for film students.
Actress and director had every opportunity to go too far in making this
a mawkish, sentimental "shoe-in" for the Oscars.  Their restraint and
subtly lets the brilliance of Hunter's performance creep up on you,
and allows you the freedom to  "take in" the rest of the film.  You
will not recognize Hunter as the "perky" gamin from BROADCAST NEWS or
MISS FIRECRACKER.  Her wan face transmits "messages" and subtexts
more effectively than any performance I've seen since the advent of
sound in films.  Unlike those of silent films, Campion's characters are
richly drawn, complex, and may leave you vacillating in your sympathy
with all of the characters.</P>
<P>     Though a startlingly original film, THE PIANO has a lot in
common with the best of great Silent cniema.  It has a simple premise,
a plot that maintains the clarity of a biblical parable, and wonderful
use of symbols and counterpoints ... a woman "without a voice" in a
man's world ... a piano left out in the rain ... a small child running
through the mud with angel wings ... a church pageant about Bluebeard's
wives ... the "fore-shadowing" of a limb being amputated....  The film
leaves many stunning images indelibly engraved in your memory (I saw
the film five nights ago, and it's still with me.)</P>
<P>     Lee Swarth's incredibly clear soundtrack captures the emotion
contained in each piano note, the incessant buzz of flies, the constant
sound of mud and rain.  (Michael Nyman is responsible for the
compelling score.)  The cinematography (didn't catch name off the
titles) is an equal match for the magnificence of story and
performance.  New Zealand literally looks like the ends of the earth
though this telling camera; often the interior scenes resemble lovingly
hand-tinted photos from the last century.</P>
<P>     On the surface, it would be tempting to label this a "woman's
film," this time about a wronged mail-order bride from the last
century, who has to endure the indignities of her husband's "property
rights."  Campion's screenplay, however, defines Ada (Hunter) as a
complete and complex woman, whose "will" at times attracts or repulses
you.  The men are no less fully drawn than Hunter's character.  The
performances so pull you into the present moment that you won't be able
to anticipate the film's ending.</P>
<P>     We only hear Hunter's voice  briefly, at the beginning of the
film, as "the voice in my mind."  (She's been mute since she was 6,
cause unknown).  Hunter's forbidding demeanor is counterpointed by her
free-spirited child-daughter (a phenomenal performance by Anna
Paquin).  At times, mother and daughter seem like aspects of the same
person, the daughter almost "the inner child" exposed to the outside
world.  They share a secret language, which supplements Hunter's
frequent need to spell out her needs with a pad and pencil.</P>
<P>     Hunter's character needs little interpretation for those drawn
into her orbit.  Her face tells all.  Hunter's piano is her "voice,"
which she plays with a soul-shattering touch.  (Throughout the film I
was marveling over how convincing Hunter was on the keyboard, wondering
who was "really" playing it, and deciding to buy the soundtrack--the
credits shocked me with the line "piano solos played by Holly
Hunter"--her amazing range of talents doesn't stop with acting!)
Hunter, a mute, unwed mother, is married off, sight unseen, to a
recluse in New Zealand (Sam Neill).  Hunter, daughter, and piano are
unceremoniously dumped off on a blustery, remote beach, where her
husband-to-be has missed his appointed meeting.  One of the most
unforgettable images is of mother and daughter spending their first
night ashore beneath her hoop skirt, which makes an impromptu
"igloo."  Neil hadn't planned on transporting a piano, so it is left
on the beach "to be picked up later."  Later, the look on Hunter's face
through a rain streaked window (echoing her unspeakable horror over the
piano warping on the beach) ranks with Lillian Gish's visage through
the sand-covered window in THE WIND.  (In the Paris theatre where I
saw THE PIANO, I could hear several members of a sophisticated-looking
audience suck in their breath at that point ... by the end of the film I
was very used to that sound.)</P>
<P>     Without consulting his new wife, Neil decides to swap the piano
(including "lessons") to back-woodsman Harvey Keitel for a few acres
of land.  Keitel suggested the deal, having had a catharsis of sorts
while watching Hunter play the piano, still boxed, on the beach.
Hunter is eventually drawn into a labrynth of negotiations and
deceptions to maintain access to her "voice."  Keitel is gradually
transformed by his "lessons," and by the film's end, you've released
every prejudice or preconceived notion you had about his character.</P>
<P>     The three leads are wonderfully backlight by a rich supporting
cast, (an ingredient entirely missing from big budget "star
vehicles").  THE PIANO is the type of film Hollywood seems to have
forgotten how to make.  It has every ingredient destined to make it a
classic as enduring as THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS, (another film made
without Hollywood's support.)</P>
<P>     A seven-minute standing ovation at Cannes?  Not half long enough,
in my book, for a woman from the other side of the world who's taught
us to dream again, and who has delivered the promise that enduring film
classics can and will be made in our lifetime.</P>
