                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     It's round two for Heather Graham.  Will she make it in comedy?  Or
will she drag the genre down in flames?  Unlike her earlier attempt at
yucking it up just a few months ago in AUSTIN POWERS 2, Graham is
actually pretty good here, as are all the principals.  Imagine my
surprise when, ultimately, BOWFINGER just doesn't gel the way a good
comedy should, although it certainly has some merit.</P>
<P>     The problem isn't the premise: Never-has-been, aging filmmaker
Bobby Bowfinger (Martin) is so desperate to make a movie, he decides to
film impromptu scenes with major, but paranoid, star Kit Ramsey (Murphy,
basically playing himself).  Wackiness ensues when the scenes (a sci-fi
action film) get crazier and crazier.  Sounds like a good plot to me.</P>
<P>     It's not the stars.  The idea of Martin and Murphy together has had
me salivating for this film all summer.  Supporting stars like Graham,
Stamp (as a Scientology-esque guru), and Baranski all hold up their
parts of the picture well, and Murphy's second role as a nerdy Ramsey
lookalike is the best part of the movie.</P>
<P>     It's not the pacing.  BOWFINGER jumps along from scene to scene and
never gets boring.  And on technical merits, the film is a success.</P>
<P>     The problem, I think, lies in the comedy.  Try as it might,
BOWFINGER just never manages to be hysterically funny.  A few bright
spots aside, BOWFINGER's jokes almost universally fall flat, with missed
comic opportunities buzzing by at every turn.  I really wanted to love
this picture, but compared to POWERS or AMERICAN PIE, this isn't a
brilliant flick.</P>
<P>     I think the fault lies with director Frank Oz (best known as the
voice of Yoda), none of whose credits (including IN & OUT) have
impressed me very much.  Oz obviously wanted to craft an adult comedy
here, but ended up making a PG-13 film that tries to appeal to all
tastes.  It's no surprise that it doesn't really click with adults or
kids.</P>
<P>     On a personal note, Eddie Murphy Productions was *this close* to
buying a script I wrote last year.  Who was my contact at the company?
Eddie Murphy's brother.  Think about that... after you see the movie.</P>
