<PRE>                     BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS
                      A film review by Ken Johnson
                       Copyright 1993 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>1:49, NC-17, Drama/Comedy, 1970
Director: Russ Meyer
Cast: Dolly Read, Cynthia Myers, Marcia McBroom, John LaZar,
      Michael Blodgett, Edy Williams, Charles Napier</P>
<P>     This film shows three rock singers, Dolly Read, Cynthia Myers, and
Marcia McBroom, who go to L.A. and start to make it big.  They run into
many problems on the fast track and try to make it through them
successfully.</P>
<P>     BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS (the sequel to VALLEY OF THE DOLLS
by name only) has just been re-released on CBS/FOX Home Video (now just
called FOX Video I believe) and may be showing up in your local video
store.  This black comedy is worth seeing, if you can take weird dark
films.  On a scale of zero to five I give BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE
DOLLS a four (with reservations).  BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS is
rated NC-17 for female nudity, adult situations, explicit language, and
violence.</P>
<P>     The biggest problem with BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS is that it
is rather slow in some places and probably could have been cut by half
an hour.  Other than that, the story, which was written by Russ Meyer
and film critic Roger Ebert, is well written.  On of the best things
about this film is that it doesn't conform with Hollywood standards,
which is probably what earned it the NC-17 rating.  The ending to the
film is very well done and leaves the viewer with a satisfied feeling.</P>
<P>     The actors and actresses are normal B grade film actors.  They
don't have a lot of talent, yet they are not horrible.  In some ways
though, they make the film better than if it had a higher grade cast.
Because the film is about the lower class talent, it fits better, I
feel, to have a lower class cast.</P>
