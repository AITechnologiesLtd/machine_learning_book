<P>   They say that things were simpler when we were kids back
in the early fifties. That's easy to trumpet now, but when
you're struggling to add and subtract fractions in sixth grade,
life seems as complex as it would ever be. For relaxation,
you could always go to the movies on Saturday--every
Saturday in fact--to enjoy a cartoon, a serial, two features
and a newsreel.  And oh how redundant and violent the
animations were!  Elmer Fudd never could gun down the
carrot-eating Bugs Bunny with his shotgun and Tom never did
get to eat Jerry.  The moral of these cartoons was always
that it pays to be an underdog--or cat or bunny--because the
oppressor always got blown up trying to get you.  The
Japanese animes that have come our way during the nineties
are just as violent, but they're obviously more adult.  The
complexity is mind-boggling.  Satoshi Kon's "Perfect Blue" is
not that intricate, featuring a leading character who sinks into
psychosis and gets into an awful lot of trouble because like
Willy Loman, presumably, she seeks out a career that she
was not meant to bear.  </P>
<P>   By contrast Hayao Miyazaki's epic "Princess Mononoke" is
a veritable Fuji of a complicated, difficult story about as
multidimensional as a series of Marcel Proust recherches. 
But the time the tale is over, though, the pieces come
together.  You won't place the old moral that the underdog
will prevail in this one but rather a whole succession of
themes, universal in scope, among which is the idea that
warfare among competing clans (and even species) does not
necessarily take place between the forces of good and evil. 
The gods are not on anyone's side in this anime, because
both positions have validity and, in fact, a single human being
can possess elements of good and evil.  Sounds strangely
enough like the current reality, no?</P>
<P>   The story is set in feudal Japan, more or less the
fourteenth century, a time in which that archipelago was in
ways more democratic than it is today.  Women were helpers,
just like the western women of 19th century America who
would fight alongside the men, and spoke right up against
their boorish husbands.  Peasants and samurai were virtually
indistinguishable.  The laborers worked with their hands--ore
diggers, charcoal makers and drivers of oxen.  (In this film
they are from the Tatara clan).  The forests are devoid of
people--thick, pristine, a Rousseau-esque state of nature. 
But the ironworkers are homeless and have located in the
forest to mine the fields for iron where their presence is
opposed by the gods and creatures of the woodlands,
including the title character who has been raised by the wolf-
gods, who does not identify herself as human, and who hates
everything that moves on two legs.</P>
<P>   The film is dubbed in English for an English-speaking
audience with well-known actors assuming the voices of the
human beings and the animal gods. The story centers not on
San aka Princess Mononoke but on the hero and lover of
peace, Ashitaka (Billy Crudup). When Ashitaka kills a huge,
fierce and vindictive boar, he is cursed like Coleridge's
ancient mariner but instead of wearing the great big beast
around his neck, he receives an imprinted burn on his arm
which causes him great pain and is destined to kill him
unless.....He must leave his tribe (symbolized by his cutting
his hair) and make an odyssey to the Tatara workers led by
Eboshi (Minnie Driver), winding up in the middle of a complex
life-and-death struggle involving not only the ironworkers and
the forest gods but at least two feuding groups of human
beings as well.  </P>
<P>   What follows comes across as perhaps the most
sophisticated video game you've ever seen.  As with the
amusement park machines, when arrows hit their targets,
whole heads fly off, indicating that director Hayao Miyazaki
may have been inspired by some Monty Python episodes. 
Moro (Gillian Anderson), the Wolf Spirit, is a leading fighter
for the preservation of the pristine woodlands and he is
accompanied by the human woman he raised, San (Claire
Danes), who talks to the wolves and thus is called Mononoke
("spirits of things").  Not being wholly committed to feminism,
San is the bitter enemy of the other principal female, Eboshi,
who is intent on destroying San and killing all the gods--even
though such a feat would be somewhat more difficult than
slaying mere animals.</P>
<P>   Obviously a labor-intensive effort despite the dependence
on computerized digital animation, "Princess Mononoke"
excels in giving the viewer the broad panorama of nature,
from the cloud-covered hills to the verdant forests, with the
characters gliding through the air with the grace of Mikhail
Barishnikov floating across the Lincoln Center stage.  Arrows
fill the air, occasionally sliced into pieces by fearsome
samurai swords, and elks, wolves and other four-legged
creatures loyally guide their human cargo into the fray.  What
we're made privy to is the virtual world of the film's director, a
land more primeval than Thoreauvian, where human beings
must learn to reconcile themselves with nature instead of
trying to tame its majesty.  </P>
<P>   The plea for humanity to live in harmony with nature is in
no way an original supplication, but Miyazaki puts a decidedly
original and distinctive spin on the theme and has made fine
use of actors like Claire Danes, Billy Crudup, Minnie Driver
and Billy Bob Thornton, and the particularly resonant and
guttural tones of Gillian Anderson as the wolf Moro.  What
comes across best is the idea (previously mentioned) that in
warfare, good does not necessary fight against evil.  We are
continually baffled trying to label the wolf, the boar, the
humans like Eboshi who despise San and San herself, who
hates all human beings despite her being one of that very
species.  The 135 minutes that Miyazaki takes to put across
his many motifs are deserved considering the complexity of
his task and the movie, which avoids repetition despite the
many battles, does not fail to entertain.</P>
