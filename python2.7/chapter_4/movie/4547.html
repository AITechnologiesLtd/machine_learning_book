                       A film review by Edwin Jahiel
                        Copyright 1996 Edwin Jahiel</PRE>
<P>PASSION FISH (1992) *** Written, directed and edited by John Sayles. 
Cinematography, Roger Deakins. Production design, Dan Bishop. Music, 
Mason Daring. Cast: Mary McDonnell, Alfre Woodard, David Strathairn, 
Vondie Curtis-Hall, et al. A Miramax release. 134 min. Rated R 
(language). </P>
<P>A New York cab accident paralyzes TV soap actress May-Alice Culhane 
(Mary McDonnell) from the waist down. Bitter, rebellious and given to 
corrosively black jokes on herself,  May-Alice makes a "difficult" 
paraplegic. She stays angry after she moves to her empty family home in 
rural Louisiana. Becoming something of a hermit, she swills wine, 
watches TV non-stop and keeps firing nurse-companions. May-Alice may be 
a royal pain, but the nurses, in a clever twist of the script, are 
themselves pains in sundry ways. </P>
<P>The moment Chantelle (Alfre Woodard) shows up, any film or TV-watcher 
over age 9 knows that between the once spoiled, now hostile white woman 
and the pan-faced black graduate of the school of hard knocks, there 
will be bonding.  Predictable too are the sparks that will fly in the 
process of generating a rapport  between the two, as well as alleviation 
of the women's aches.  But writer-director Sayles has a way of taking 
the foreseeable and giving it, if not total originality, at least 
freshness. </P>
<P>In a photographic darkroom of her house, May-Alice finds a Leica M-3 
camera. This is a model introduced several decades ago, a classic 
without the gadgetry and automation of no-think modern cameras. It still 
works beautifully, it is still used by photographers.  Like the Leica, 
"Passion Fish" is something of a classic movie story plot, one that  
generally works well, without  having to resort to audience manipulation 
or gimmickry.</P>
<P>>From the start to about the midpoint the film engrosses and captivates.  
McDonnell's acting, natural looks and appeal (even when she bitches), 
the script and the direction, make May-Alice's rage entirely 
understandable. There is self-pity here, of course, but not of the 
viewer-alienating kind. </P>
<P>What is really a tour-de-force is that without fake sentimentality, 
without condescension, and without diminishing May-Alice's hurt, John 
Sayles's film entertains and makes you laugh. The writer-director also 
holds in reserve some minor surprises, mostly dealing with Chantelle's 
own problems.  </P>
<P>Sayles has a good stock of ingenious, inventive and funny touches or 
scenes, most of them plausible.  Among the best : three satirically 
treated visits to May-Alice :by former schoolmates; her soap opera 
colleagues; and her producer. All of them stress that no matter how sad 
May-Alice's situation is now, her former life was one of immense 
inanity. By "lfe" I mean her professional life, since, oddly, we learn  
almost nothing about her private existence before the accident. </P>
<P>Also bizarre is the nature of new romances that develop for both women. 
It is no doubt unintended, but I have the feeling that Chantelle and 
May-Alice are slumming sentimentally.</P>
<P>Chantelle meets Sugar (Vondie Curtis-Hall), a local Don Juan, bon vivant 
and rake. As for May-Alice, there is a serious rekindling of attraction 
for Rennie (David Strathairn), erstwhile "wild boy" school chum, now a 
subdued gas-pumper, handyman and bayou guide, father of five and husband 
of a prudish, puritanical termagant. Like much else that is left to 
one's imagination in the film, Rennie's wife is heard about but not 
seen. </P>
<P>Sayles, an independent and "different" filmmaker, has respect for his 
audience and does not spell out everything. But extending this 
sketchiness to the women's  new male relationships makes me rather 
uncomfortable.  </P>
<P>These are not matches made in Heaven. Sugar's past record and present 
attitudes do not bode well for the kind of steady, supportive rapport 
that Chantelle needs. Granted, too, that May-Alice is not presented as a 
thinker (the dialogues are naturalistic but of no particular depth or 
interest), she still towers, in appeal and sophistication, above Rennie 
the Redneck.  </P>
<P>The slow, deliberate tempo of the film works very well initially.  It is 
around the halfway mark that one starts becoming conscious of slowness 
-- and of some arbitrariness.  One example: when May-Alice starts 
shooting pictures,  this, we realize, will help her psyche. But 
photographers' eyebrows will go way up as May-Alice develops and prints 
her work with antique chemicals and paper that must be moldy by now -- 
and all this without assistance or special equipment.is she does. </P>
<P>"Passion Fish" has the appeal of a solid subject done without 
Hollywodian preaching or moralizing.  All-around performances are good, 
Woodard's  and McDonnell's are excellent.  The movie feels like a 
"Kammerspiel " (a chamber play) opened up, with the best sections 
happening in and around the house.  May-Alice, for example, starts 
taking pictures. Whether she realizes it or not, the audience knows that 
this will help her psychological rehabilitation -- a plus point in the 
film.   </P>
<P>No matter how warmly you might feel about some of the characters, except 
for May-Alice's plight, there is nothing that's particularly strong or 
involving about the problems of the rest.  And neither the protagonists 
nor the supporting cast are given many dimensions. </P>
<P>To put it differently, Sayle's script, especially when it is ironical, 
is more interesting than the creatures it contains. </P>
