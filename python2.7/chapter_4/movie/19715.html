Cranky Critic® movie reviews: The Blair Witch Project
not rated, 87 minutes
Starring Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, and Joshua Leonard
Written and Directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez
website: www.blairwitch.com</P>
<P>IN SHORT: The buzz was better than the movie.</P>
<P>Cranky has written before of how those of us who make our living
reviewing movies are a small, compact community, who share the buzz on
"small" or independent flicks that may otherwise be overlooked. Over the
last six months there's been major buzz about a no-name flick -- that
means no star actors or production folk. It's no reflection on talent --
called The Blair Witch Project. Word was this documentary style horror
flick was tremendous, which explains the packed house in the screening
room when we got our first look at the flick this past June.</P>
<P>The story concept was great: Three budding filmmakers, Heather Donahue
(director), Michael Williams (sound), and Joshua Leonard (camera) are
shooting a documentary on an 18th century "witch" named Elly Dedward
when they vanish forever into a Maryland woods. A year later, their film
and tape is found and is edited into a coherent form by the team of
Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, revealing the physically
deterioration and psychological self-destruction of eight lost days
during which the group finds themselves hunted by an unknown entity.</P>
<P>The only problem is, the history of the "Blair Witch" isn't well
documented in the film. The "filmmakers" spend more time focussing on a
1940s child killer who stalked the town and don't make a strong link
between that "possession" and others that have occurred over the past
two centuries (I'll get back to that). Residents of the town of
Burkittsville (formerly Blair) are interviewed about what they know of
the witch or the killer in the first half of the film that is very
entertaining. Once they get lost in the woods, and I'll not give most of
that away, the film begins to feel like something that was made up on
the spot.</P>
<P>Which it was. Myrick and Sanchez gave the three actors film and video
equipment to shoot with and story notes from which they were then left
to improvise. The net result are scenes that sometimes look totally
natural, and sometimes look like a bunch of scenery chewing. "Mike" goes
through mood swings that a) make you wish he had brought a Valium drip
with him and b) detract from the better than usual improv job done by
"Heather" and "Josh". That pair are more consistent in their
characterizations but the overall picture just isn't scary.</P>
<P>No one ever implied that BWP was a slice 'n' dice flick. If that's what
you expect in your scareflicks, you won't like this.</P>
<P>This is one of the few times that the website is a vital resource, and
more entertaining, than the film. There's a tremendous amount of
material documenting the "witch" or the alleged possessions (there are
more than one). Having the background details down cold will help fill
in the gaps for you and may raise the tension levels high enough that
you get a fright or two. Cranky got the material just before his
screening, and knowing the details only pointed out the failure of the
improvisations.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to The Blair Witch Project, he would
have paid...</P>
<PRE>$1.00</PRE>
<P>and, as we used to say in school, an "A" for effort. The sum of the
parts do not make for an enthralling whole.</P>
