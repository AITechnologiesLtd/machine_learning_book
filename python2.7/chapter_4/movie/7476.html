<P>     The first five minutes of GRAY'S ANATOMY are as squirm-inducing as
any five minutes of film you'll see this year.  In a series of
black-and-white talking head interviews, people describe every possible
horror which could befall the human eye, including close calls with Super
Glue, aneurisms and inch-long shards of metal.  Though nothing is
graphically depicted, the descriptions are detailed enough to give a
surgeon chills.  It's a sensational set-up for an examination of the
fragility of vision; if you've never worried about going blind before, you
may be inspired to start.</P>
<P>     Spalding Gray had to worry about it, and for all I know it was very
traumatic.  That's certainly not the impression you get from GRAY'S
ANATOMY, however.  GRAY'S ANATOMY is a staged monologue about Gray's
experience dealing with a retinal disorder called a macular pucker,
particularly the various alternative treatments he explores in an attempt
to avoid surgery.  Gray is one of America's finest story-tellers, and some
of the stories about Native American sweat lodges and obsessive
nutritionists are quite entertaining.  But the story-telling is very
detached; Gray's milieu is the ironic observation, not the soul-baring
revelation.  It's true that plenty of frightening things seem ridiculous
with hindsight, but Gray shows us all the ridiculousness with little of
the fear.  The whole ordeal seems more like an amusing inconvenience than
an existential crisis.</P>
<P>     GRAY'S ANATOMY feels even more detached because of the way director
Steven Soderbergh has chosen to stage it.  This is the third of Gray's
monologues to receive a film treatment, but it is the first to be filmed
without a live audience.  The advantage of that choice is that Soderbergh
is free to create a surreal mood with arresting visuals.  The disadvantage
is that Gray seems adrift without an audience.  He becomes a story-teller
trying to be an actor, playing things too broadly in an attempt to
generate the energy he can't draw from audience reaction.  Like fellow
story-teller Garrison Keillor, Gray's strength is a straightforward
delivery which makes you laugh without _signaling_ you to laugh.  GRAY'S
ANATOMY is like "A Prairie Home Companion" turned into a performance art
piece.</P>
<P>     Soderbergh is a gifted director (SEX, LIES AND VIDEOTAPE; KING OF THE
HILL); Gray is a gifted monologist (SWIMMING TO CAMBODIA).  They're just
not a very good match for the creation of a film.  Soderbergh's direction
creates an intensity of mood which Gray's stoic demeanor can't sustain,
and Gray's ability to wow an audience while sitting in front of a
microphone is undercut by Soderbergh's visual theatrics.  The absurdity of
some of the stories in GRAY'S ANATOMY is bound to generate some laughs,
but while you're chuckling at the stories you may feel there's something
missing, something the opening five minutes promises but doesn't deliver.
In this case, the eyes just don't have it.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 eye messages:  5.</PRE>
