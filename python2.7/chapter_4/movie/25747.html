<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A tearjerker love story, about the handsome Richard Gere as a
48-year-old womanizer and Winona Ryder as a 22-year-old Emily
Dickinson-quoting, hat designer, who doesn't have long to live because
of a tumor in her heart. There's nothing that isn't predictable about
this sappy formula sob story and there's nothing about this flat romance
between these two good-looking upper-middle-class yuppies that is
endearing. It is a disappointing film, lacking imagination, turgidly
acted, and laden with a mechanical script, a real downer after the
director's more sweeping last film, "Xiu-Xiu: The Sent Down Girl."</P>
<P>At Gere's trendy upscale Manhattan restaurant, Ryder is celebrating her
birthday, and Gere recognizes an old acquaintance, Ryder's irascible
grandmother, Elaine Stritch, and she introduces this wolf, whom she has
little use for, to her granddaughter, and right on the spot, they both
fall in love. Stritch goes back to the time Gere wooed her daughter and
left her emotionally upset by jilting her. He also knocked up her best
friend and left her without ever seeing the child. They haven't seen
each other for some time, so I guess granny has a memory lapse of what
she thinks of him, as for some inexplicable reason she helps get this
romance started.</P>
<P>Gere, who is a smooth liar, skilled in seducing women and then leaving
them, unnecessarily tricks Winona into going to a formal gala event with
him. It was unnecessary because this silly girl who loves to say wow, is
dying to go out with him. He quickly gets her to bed, but honoring the
old-fashioned conventions of films shot in the 1930s, we don't get to
see any sex. The next morning the playboy deceptively tells her that he
is too old for her, and then gives her his standard non-commitment
speech, "All I'm able to offer you is this--what we have right
now--until it ends. We have no future."</P>
<P>She cheerfully tells him, "I collect antiques." She also tells him that
this romance is taking place only because she will be dying soon. Ryder
finds him so irresistible, that she swallows all these tired playboy
lines and they go on a whirlwind May-December romance. Anthony LaPaglia
is a loyal friend to Gere, and he also is the host in Gere's eatery. His
job in the film is to say cliché lines that reprimmand Gere for being
such a cad to women. He warns him that if he doesn't find the right
woman, someday when he gets too old to be a wolf, he will be alone
drinking egg nogs to himself on Christmas. I guess in the way this film
looks at things, that would be a terrible retribution.</P>
<P>Gere has a quickie with an old flame on the roof, at a Halloween party,
while Ryder is telling bedtime stories to LaPaglia's children. Gere can
only tell her that he felt like having sex with her, it was no big deal.
This shakes up Ryder, who is the one in this relationship, committed to
telling the truth. To add to the melodramatics, Gere tries his best to
woo her back, thinking of himself as a better man now that he has
suffered from some momentary pains due to her leaving him. This love
story never convincingly goes beyond the depth of two good-looking
people falling in love based on their looks.</P>
<P>Gere's neglected daughter (Vera) tracks him down from a picture of him
that appeared in a popular magazine, and she eagerly meets him for the
first time, wondering if he's a good guy. She is about Ryder's age. Gere
goes through a redemptive phase after talking with her, asking for
forgiveness, which had about the same amount of sincerity in it as
President Clinton's apology to the nation had for his inappropriate
conduct.</P>
<P>To pile on some more weepie scenes, Winona keeps fainting and Gere keeps
trying to find a miracle to save her. When she faints while skating at
Rockefeller Center, a surgeon flies in to save her. Since everything
about this film is manipulative, the odds are 4 to 5 against her living,
since this film is just as corny and as predictable as the 1970 film
"Love Story."</P>
<P>The only good line in the film comes from Gere, when asked by Ryder what
made him become a food guy: He says, "Food is the only beautiful thing
that truly nourishes."</P>
<P>This is basically an exterior movie, as Manhattan is warmly
photographed, but the interiors of the two lovers was never made to seem
warm. The romance never rung true and the stars did not have a good
chemistry together. Gere seemed to be content to be in love with
himself, always smugly smiling while everyone said how handsome he was,
while Ryder was too shrill to be engaging. At one point in their
romance, Ryder when in Central Park, waxes poetic and tells him, "I can
smell the rain." She then coos and makes a contorted face of pleasure,
and with this trite dialogue and mushy call for love, amid the autumn
splendor of the golden leaves beautifully photographed by Changwei Gu,
we are asked to believe that these unreal lovers are for real.</P>
