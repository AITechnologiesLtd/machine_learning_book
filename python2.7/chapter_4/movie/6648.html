<PRE>                        THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1997 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This is a high-level and frequently
          very rushed look at the career of wildcat
          pornographer Larry Flynt with emphasis on his
          battle against government censorship.  Milos Forman
          gives us a more superficial treatment of the legal
          issues to make way for a familiar doomed love story
          and other more salable aspects of Flynt's career.
          In doing so he makes this a much less engaging
          film, albeit more profitable, than it might have
          been.  Rating: +1 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     As portrayed in this new film, the first directed by Milos Forman
in seven years, Larry Flynt is a free spirit who spent most of his life
drifting.   He makes the decision to publish a magazine with pictures
of the dancers at his sleazy Cincinnati strip club, just as a publicity
stunt, after that things pretty much just happen to him.  The magazine
become popular; Flynt becomes rich and famous filling the demand; the
local government decides to prosecute him; his cause becomes a major
civil liberties case; he becomes a national figure in the anti-
censorship movement.  In the course of all this he occasionally tries
to make decisions that will change the course of his life and his
magazine, but none of these decisions ever sticks.  He decides to have
his Hustler magazine mix fundamentalist Christianity with pornography,
but somehow the combination just does not sell.  Flynt fires the entire
executive staff of his own magazine only to be ignored. He decides that
he and his wife, Althea, should kick their drug habits and though he
succeeds himself,  he finds he has no control over her.  Flynt seems to
want to scuttle himself when he to be as uncooperative as possible with
his lawyer, but his defense goes on in spite of himself, all the way to
the Supreme Court. During all of this Flynt shows no admirable traits
at all beyond loyalty to Althea.</P>
<P>     The film opens with a prologue set in the early 1950s in Kentucky
where a young Larry Flynt is already giving the public what it wants by
making and selling his own moonshine.  Cut to two decades later and
Flynt is running the Hustler Club in Cincinnati.  He has the idea to
have a magazine to promote his club. Once that is in place he decides
to make his HUSTLER magazine what PLAYBOY is not, a magazine overtly
aimed at the shotguns and pickups types who come to his club.  While at
his club he meets dancer Althea Leasure (Courtney Love) who shows
immediate romantic interest in Flynt.  The publicity says that Flynt is
an unlikely hero for a film and that is a true statement.  But the hero
of the film is Alan Isaacman the civil liberties lawyer who took his
principle of defending the First Amendment to the Supreme Court in
Flynt's name, often frustratingly sabotaged by the childish antics of
Flynt himself.  Had there been some nobility shown in Althea beyond her
initial loyalty to Flynt, she might have made an interesting character.
But eventually she will show herself to be even weaker than her
husband.</P>
<P>     Forman tells the story of Larry Flynt, but never gives us much of
an emotional investment in his character. Flynt is never anything but
selfish in the course of the film.  With other characters his love for
Althea might have been touching, but only occasionally is there any
chemistry between the two of them or any feeling that it is good that
these two people have found each other.  Interestingly Courtney Love
made her film debut in SID AND NANCY, in some ways a very similar film
with very similar problems.  Forman may have seen parallels between
Flynt and McMurphy in his ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, but he was
able to capture an emotional core and a nobility in McMurphy that seems
lacking in Flynt.  Even when his lawyer is winning in court, Flynt
seems determined to play the Bad Boy and to derail the proceedings.
Forman's telling of the story of Flynt moves too quickly with too
little explanation of what is going on.  Flynt will be in jail in one
scene and out the next organizing a free speech rally without
explanation of how he got out of jail.  Other obvious production
details seem to be ignored.  Edward Norton, playing the idealist
lawyer, seems not to age at all over the course of the many years the
film covers (not including the prologue).</P>
<P>     Woody Harrelson will probably never be a great actor.  Here Flynt
is supposed to behave in an eccentric manner, and Harrelson does.
Flynt is supposed to be superficial and have a fly-weight intellect
easily influenced by others, and Harrelson does that sufficiently too.
And he is supposed to be juvenile in unexpected places, and he is.  On
the surface this does not seem like a difficult role to play and
Harrelson is just fine.  Curiously he is out-performed by the much less
experienced Courtney Love as Althea.</P>
<P>     THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT has positioned itself to be an engaging
film on the meaning of the First Amendment of the constitution.  It
also is supposed to be a little titillating, though in a style much
more subdued than is Flynt's enthusiastic approach.  Frankly the film
does a better job of the former than the latter.  I rate it a +1 on the
-4 to +4 scale.</P>
