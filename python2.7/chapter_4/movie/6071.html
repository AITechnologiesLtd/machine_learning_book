                       A film review by Edwin Jahiel
                        Copyright 1996 Edwin Jahiel</PRE>
<P>FEELING MINNESOTA **  Written and directed by Steven 
Baigelman. Photography, Walt Lloyd. Editing, Martin Walsh.

Naomi Shohan.  Producers, Danny DeVito, Michael 
Shamberg,  Stacey Sher.  Cast : Keanu Reeves (Jjaks),

Lindo (Red), Courtney Love (Waitress), Tuesday Weld 
(Nora), Dan Aykroyd (Ben),Levon Helm (Bible Salesman) A 
Fine Line release. 100 min. Rated R (language, sex, 
violence) </P>
<P>There goes again this pesky rating by stars. Got to do it, 
but you don't have to consider it like a grade from 
Consumer Reports. Fact is that "Feeling Minnesota" can be 
so bad that it can get good, and so very dumb that it can 
become funny. Miss it, and you save time and money. See 
it, and you won't feel like sueing the theater.</P>
<P>This very motion-full motion pictureis one of those 
independent films that, contrary to their label, are very 
dependent. Dependent on trendiness, from Tarantinoisms 
to modish grunge. Dependent scene by scene 
improvisations: the writer-director, in his first 
feature,seems to have not the vaguest about what must 
come next. </P>
<P>Dependent on neo-clicheism. Just as in hippie days the 
reaction to the bourgeois dress code led to jeans --torn 
at the knee if possible, --long hair and other 
accoutrements which became the new uniforms of the new 
conformism of revolt; just as today back to front baseball 
caps express reverse individualism, in certain movies 
studio cliches are often countered by new sets of 
statements, preferably absurd, and repeated from picture 
to picture. I won't give you specific examples. Glance, and 
you'll see them.</P>
<P>"FM" is, sort of, about a kind of sex-and-money trio, sort 
of, a Cain-Abel thing closer to a Cain-Cain, sort of, a 
sickish All in the Family.  A blondie,  Freddie (Diaz), in a 
sort of wedding dress, is pursued by a car. Red (Lindo), 
drags her violently to her own wedding to creepy Sam 
(D'Onofrio). Seems that Red (who is black) runs a 
strip-joint plus a drug operation. He accuses Sam, his 
accountant, of stealing money. He punishes him with that 
marriage. (Go figure). </P>
<P>Sam's younger brother is Jjack, so named after a typo on 
his birth certificate --but really in one of the many 
efforts of a script straining for cuteness and novelty.  
Sam was always lording it over Jjack, as seen in the 
opening flashback of the two in their childhood. </P>
<P>Jjack (Reeves) is a smalltime hood who can't stay out of 
jail. He surfaces at his brother's wedding, one that 
breathes low-class taste through every pore, assuming 
weddings have pores. This is nicely done, from 
outrageously ugly clothes to the kind of music that Martin 
Scorsese's Mafiosi love).</P>
<P>The brotherly antagonism has not abated. Jjack meets the 
new missus, he looks at her, she looks at him and, in a 
flash,  they rush to vigorous sex in the john. (Oddly, the 
film "Maybe, Maybe Not" has a similar scene early on). ) </P>
<P>A the party, the boys' Mom keels over dead, is buried 
pronto. Immediately after the ceremony, Jjack and the 
bride re-engage in sex, boucing and unsafe since it is 
inside a car that rolls down, like Jack and Jill Went Down 
the Hill.</P>
<P>Up to now matters are kookily, sporadically amusing. 
These are followed by Jjack and Freddie sort of eloping 
and Sam going after them. The menu includes stealing 
stolen money, fights, beatings,a corpse that may not be 
corpse, other niceties.  Weirdly, much of the action takes 
place in contiguous places, a motel out of "It Happened 
One Night," a restaurant, etc. </P>
<P>Things get exponentially looser and more unplanned. 
Freddie, an ecdysiast, dreams of joining the chorus girls in 
Nirvana, which for her is Las Vegas with its four-dollar 
steaks and other goodies. As funny a line as any comes 
when she vocalizes her desires.  Sitting with Jjack by the 
dirtier-than-in-"Diabolique," empty pool of a third-rate 
Minnesotan motel,  she yearns for the Vegas pools "with 
water in them." </P>
<P>Later, in the midst of troubles, mayhem and confusion, 
Jjack returns to his and Freddie's room with a jovial "Hi, 
honey, I'm home!" which, given its usual Family Values 
context, also becomes funny. </P>
<P>The main performers are good, but handicapped by all 
being idiots. Dan Aykroyd is miscast against type as a 
dishonest cop. Still,  somewhere in this salad there's the 
kernel of a possibly good idea, but it gets lost in the 
nonsense, sketchiness, incoherence and other Achilles' 
heels of the story. Many heels. Just count the characters 
and multiply by two.</P>
