<PRE>THE FIFTH ELEMENT</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * * * 1/2</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Luc Besson
Written by: Luc Besson, Robert Mark Kamen</PRE>
<P>Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis) is an ex-fighter pilot in the 23rd century who 
now flies a cab. His life takes a sudden turn when a beautiful young woman 
named Leeloo (Milla Jovovich) falls into his cab. Leeloo is a perfect 
entity, sent to Earth to fight the ultimate evil, which comes every five 
thousand years. Four groups are searching for Leeloo: Priest Vito Cornelius 
(the excellent Ian Holm), whose line has assisted in the fight against evil 
for centuries; Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg (the wonderful Gary Oldman) and 
his flunkies, who work for the ultimate evil; an evil warrior race known as 
the Mangalores, who were betrayed by Zorg; and the Earth government, led by 
the ever uncertain President Lindberg (Tom "Tiny" Lister Jr.) and his chief 
General, Munro (Brion James). Now Korben and Leeloo have to meet up with 
Cornelius, find four sacred stones needed to fight the evil, and get back to 
Earth in just a few days or all life in the universe will be destroyed. 
Along the way Korben will meet such peculiar characters as a cross-dressing 
radio host named Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker), a galactic Diva named Plavalaguna 
(Maiwenn Le Besco), and a mugger (Mathieu Kassovitz) with a very interesting 
hat (don't ask, it has to be seen).</P>
<P>"The Fifth Element" is not a movie designed for all tastes. Viewers will 
most likely be divided into two groups: those who don't like their movies 
far-fetched and ridiculous, and those who love their movies to be comically 
bizarre (I fall into this category). The first group is going to loathe this 
movie because it represents all they detest in cinema. The plot (despite my 
rather confusing description) is child like in its simplicity. The 
characters are really nothing more than cartoon characters given human form; 
and all the movie's events are so ridiculous these people will no doubt be 
hitting the stop button after about thirty minutes. The other group is going 
to have an absolute blast. These people won't care about how ridiculous the 
movie is, so long as it entertains with fantastic visuals and off-the-wall 
humor. Is "The Fifth Element" entertaining? It is, quite possibly, the most 
flat-out entertaining movie I've seen this decade. It has no qualities one 
would associate with a great film, but if that's what you're looking for 
when you watch this movie you've obviously heard nothing about it. Rather 
than giving a deep, meaningful, Oscar worthy (you know, boring) picture, Luc 
Besson ("The Professional") instead chooses to give us a movie which 
promises to be just one thing - fun. "The Fifth Element" delivers on this 
promise in spades.</P>
<P>Dramatic acting is obviously not going to be of supreme importance in a 
movie like this, but comic acting is all important. Bruce Willis does quite 
a good job as the jaded Korben Dallas, dead-panning nearly everything but 
occasionally letting just a trace of amusement at his surroundings leak out 
(watch for his scene with the mugger; it's too funny for words). Milla 
Jovovich delivers a very amusing performance since she spends over half the 
movie speaking in gibberish. Word has it she actually made up her chattering 
language as she went along. Chris Tucker's ("Friday") performance is 
something of an acquired taste. When he first showed up on screen, I'll 
admit, I was rather shocked; but as the film went on, his character grew on 
me (maybe like fungus, but whatever works). The two actors who truly deliver 
outstanding comic performances are Gary Oldman ("Lost In Space") and Ian 
Holm ("Brazil"). Oldman hams it up like you've never seen as the 
multi-zillionaire Zorg. Zorg has a limp, a southern twang, a bizarre 
wardrobe, and an even stranger haircut. In the hands of anyone else, this 
character would have been a pathetic failure. Oldman actually manages to 
make Zorg likeable enough that a small part of you wants to see him get 
away, if not win. Ian Holm displays some of the best comic timing I've seen 
from an actor, well, anywhere. The way he delivers some of his lines is 
nothing short of perfection (one of my personal favorites was Ian Holm 
saying, "We're going to save the world my son." Korben responds with, 
"You're um, heh, gonna save the world?" Holm says, in an exasperated tone, 
"Yes!").</P>
<P>"The Fifth Element" is one of those marvelous movies which contains scenes 
that will stick with you for days, weeks, possibly even months afterwards. 
My favorite scenes were Leeloo's reconstruction in a futuristic (though very 
peculiar looking) laboratory; Korben's cab being chased by the police 
through the futuristic city; and the Diva's scene where she sings a 
beautiful (though very alien) opera while Leeloo fights a horde of 
Mangalores. Those first two I mentioned show Besson's visual imagination in 
two very different ways. The scene where Leeloo is being assembled is 
something quite extraordinary. It shows her skeleton being assembled 
quickly, piece by piece, then muscle and tissue being created over it, and 
finally skin being created. It's a remarkable scene in a remarkable movie. 
Korben's car chase gives us a chance to see most of Besson's futuristic 
city, and it's a sight to behold. The city is comprised of massive 
skyscrapers, surrounded by row after row of flying cars, going up as far as 
the eye can see. The scene with the Diva singing her opera while Leeloo 
beats up the Mangalores is exquisitely filmed (I must have re-watched that 
one scene five or six times). It combines Leeloo's martial arts style 
fighting with the singing flawlessly. Again, none of these scenes are going 
to win any major awards, but they're ever so much fun to watch.</P>
<P>Those who have seen Besson's work on "Nikita" and "The Messenger" know he is 
one of the more erratic directors in Hollywood. "Nikita" was a suspenseful 
tale which bordered on masterpiece, while "The Messenger" was quite the 
opposite. His work on "The Fifth Element" is far closer to that in "Nikita". 
One of Besson's trademarks is his frantic pacing throughout the film; this 
didn't work in "The Messenger", but it works perfectly in "The Fifth 
Element". The movie runs 126 minutes, which should have felt like an 
eternity, but with the combination of Besson's quick pacing and constant 
laughs, it feels more like 45 minutes (I'm not kidding). The soundtrack to 
"The Fifth Element", by composer Eric Serra ("Goldeneye"), is one of the 
film's strongest points. It's such a bizarre mix of different types of music 
(everything from something which sounded Jamaican during the car chase to 
beautiful instrumental music at the film's conclusion) that it could have 
sounded awful, but each song is somehow perfectly suited to its scene. I'd 
recommend the movie to anyone who likes their movies more than a little on 
the strange side and give it four and a half out of five stars.</P>
