                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     The title character of EL MARIACHI is the mariachi (Carlos
Gallardo), an itinerant musician who goes from town to town in Mexico
looking for a new place to play his music.  Dressed in black and
carrying his guitar in a case, he inquires at various bars and
restaurants if they will hire him.  Unfortunately for the mariachi,
Azul (Reinol Martinez) has just broken out of prison and is on his way
to kill crime boss Roco (Peter Marquardt).  No one except Roco has seen
Azul, so the description of the escaped criminal is sparse: he dresses
in black and carries a guitar case (which, instead of containing a
musical instrument, has a selection of knives and guns).  An obvious
case of mistaken identity arises as Roco's thugs think the mariachi is
Azul.  Suddenly, the simple musician is on the run from men trying to
gun him down.  Fortunately for the mariachi, he finds a sympathetic ear
in the person of Domino (Consuelo Gomez), but her introduction into his
life only adds new and previously unforeseen complications.</P>
<P>     EL MARIACHI is the $7000 wonder.  For less money than many
television commercials are budgeted at, Robert Rodriguez took his crew
down to Mexico and filmed a tightly-gripping, eminently entertaining
thriller that outdoes most of what Hollywood is putting out today at
costs three orders of magnitude greater.  This is proof positive, if
any be needed, that film quality should not be measured by the amount
of money put into a production.</P>
<P>     EL MARIACHI is an old-fashioned thriller based on a case of
mistaken identity.  It's the kind of film that Humphrey Bogart might
have been at home in.  The only noticeable difference between this
movie and something produced in the 1940s is the level of graphic
violence.  Rodriguez doesn't pull any punches when it comes to showing
people getting shot.  There's enough blood and gore in this film to
earn it an R rating.</P>
<P>     The script is clever, and, although the plot occasionally relies
upon contrivances, these instances are no more frequent or glaring than
in most other modern action films.  They are perhaps more noticeable in
EL MARIACHI because of the consistently high quality of the writing.</P>
<P>     Thrillers are expected to deliver a lot of pulse-pounding action,
and EL MARIACHI complies without difficulty.  The elements of
exploitation in this film, while present, are kept to a minimum - on
Rodriguez' budget, anything else would have been impossible.  For the
most part, the characters are not three-dimensional, but they have
enough quirks to give them more personality than the average stock
action film creation.  Numerous moments of irony and humor keep the
movie from descending too deeply into grimness.</P>
<P>     On only a few occasions is it obvious that Rodriguez is a novice
director working on a limited budget.  For the most part, EL MARIACHI
appears like a professional film produced for a sizable amount of
money.  It doesn't look Hollywood - the subtitles and the cleverness of
the script make that much obvious - but neither does it look like the
$7000 creation of a film student.</P>
<P>     The actors, all of them complete unknowns (and friends of
Rodriguez), have some ability, especially Consuelo Gomez.  But whether
they make another film appearance or not, we can only look forward with
baited breath for the director's next project.  If he can do as much,
or more, with a bigger budget (Columbia has signed him to a contract),
we may be in for a real treat.  Until then, EL MARIACHI is an excellent
introduction to the talent of Robert Rodriguez, and a truly remarkable
film in its own right.</P>
<PRE>                        Rating: 8.6 (A-, ***)</PRE>
