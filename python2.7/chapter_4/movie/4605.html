<PRE>                             DEAD MAN WALKING
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Among the bitterest disagreements people have (right after
religion) is on the subject of the death penalty.  Put at its basic
is "an eye for an eye" vs. "Who is man that he should play God?
There are many sub-issues to the arguments and DEAD MAN WALKING
takes on many of them.  The film is based on a book by Sister Helen
Prejean, C.S.J., but dramatic liberties are inevitably taken as this
is not a documentary.  The basic story, however, is true.</P>
<P>     Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn) is in prison after having been
found guilty of rape and then the killing of the teenage lovers.
Penn's performance is superb, now cocky, now desperate, sneering and
laughing with disdain.  Sister Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon)
learns about Poncelet and, understanding his anguish, decides to try
to comfort him despite his horrible crimes.  At the same time, the
nun has to consider the feelings of the parents of the slain couple,
the fierceness of their understandable hatred and their wanting full
retribution knowing that their children are gone forever. Director
Robbins keeps everything as fair as possible</P>
<P>     Sister Prejean is asked by Poncelet to be his spiritual advisor
and to accompany him in his last moments before the execution.  It
is the final hour before his death that lifts the film onto a new
plateau as we are shown, in detail, what happens at an execution to
the prisoner, to the parents who want to watch, to the warden and
the jailers, the reporters.  It is a film to make you think and to
think hard.</P>
<P>     Robert Prosky has the role of the lawyer who seeks a
last-minute stay of execution.</P>
