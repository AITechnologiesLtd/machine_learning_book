<P>Pokemon: The First Movie (Mewtwo Strikes Back)</P>
<PRE>Rating: * *½ out of * * * * </PRE>
<P>Rated: G but contains mild animated violence. </P>
<P>Voices...Veronica Taylor, Racheal Lillis, Eric Stuart, Iikue Ootani. </P>
<PRE>Running Time: 104 minutes. </PRE>
<P>Ok so your probably wondering why I gave this movie the rating I did. Well the
answer is because the movie was actually good. Even though you can tell it's
definitely made for kids, the message it gives in the end and it's charming
characters bring out the good side in the movie and cover up the bad. It's far
from being a great movie however kids will love it because it is Pokemon and
parents will like it because of the end and the important message it gives to
kids without being mean or complicated. </P>
<P>Since there really isn't a strong plot I will try and explain it the best I
can. Ash is a Pokemon trainer trying to become one of the world's best. He
receives an invitation to go to a championship hosted by the world's best
Pokemon trainer. Ash of course being a trainer wants to immediately go and
compete. Well in the meantime a new Pokemon has been created from another
Pokemon. This Pokemon is Mewtwo, an evil psychic Pokemon which can read
people's mind and wants to take over the Earth. While Ash is on his way to the
Pokemon championship, Mewtwo causes a big storm so no one can pass through and
get there. Other trainers however take their Pokemon to get them there and
eventually do as does Ash. What Mewtwo's evil plans are to clone all the
Pokemon and make them fight each other. Ash has to try and stop him in a battle
in the end that will leave you heartbroken as well as feeling good with it's
important message of fighting. </P>
<P>That's about all there is. Pokemon: The First Movie is not Disney, you can tell
that by first glance. The story is one that is light and fluffy with a heart
hidden below somewhere we can't see. From the plush animation and rich colors
to the kicking soundtrack with some great songs and noticeable voices. Pokemon
has become a big thing in the last couple of months: Trading Cars, Toys,
Clothes you name it Pokemon is on it. My little brother and sister are huge
Pokemon fans and do not miss any episode and if they do they are depressed
until the next episode comes on. </P>
<P>You really can't meet a kid now who doesn't like Pokemon. It's the new trend
I'm sure other things have been big like this but when both theatres sell out
on the first day, it's a big bet Pokemon is going to be huge. I've also heard
that this was Japan's biggest grossing movie of all time. You can call it an
anime if you want, but I really do not think it deserves the name of an anime.
The movies only real big flaws come from spots that are so slow that it could
put one to sleep and that fact that it takes itself too seriously at times even
though the TV series doesn't. </P>
<P>When you see Pokemon you wonder why this just couldn't be a direct-to-video
feature. I mean it is a low-brow kids movie with overviews of humor and
violence. But it has something there that makes it worth all the while and
trouble to see it. I wasn't surprised that all the kids came out of the movie
with a huge smile on their face saying over and over Pika Pika after the cute
and cuddly little Pokemon Pikachu. </P>
<P>Overall Pokemon: The First Movie is a surprisingly sweet, funny and good
animated movie that the whole family can enjoy. With it's lovable character,
plush and colorful animation and humor all embedded in one Pokemon fans will
not be let down. Kids will definitely love it for the fact it's Pokemon and
it's big important message at the end will make parents proud and knowing that
even though a movie is all about fighting it can actually be against it too.
Doesn't make any sense? See the movie. </P>
