<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This is a winning madcap comedy, enhanced by the mercurial pairing of
Jackie Chan with
Owen Wilson, featuring a fluid script and some irrespressible comedy
routines. Though the plot of the film revisits familiar territory, of
the rescue of the princess tale, and the idea of a buddy movie, where
characters who are opposites must mesh together. But, what overcomes
that familiarity, is the energy and chemistry the two co-stars have and
their ability to look good on-the-screen together. Jackie Chan is Chon
Wang -- if you say it fast it sounds like John Wayne -- a screw up in
the Imperial Guard in the Forbidden City of China in 1881, while Owen
Wilson is Roy O' Bannon, a non-stop talking, screw up bandit, who robs
trains in the Wild West.</P>
<P>Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) refuses to marry the 12-year-old emperor,
whom she says reminds her of a toad. When her American tutor (Connery)
offers to smuggle her out of China to Carson City, Nevada, she accepts,
but it is a hoax, as she ends up being kidnapped by a renegade Imperial
Guardsman whom the American acted for, Lo Fong (Roger Yuan). He holds
her for a king's ransom in gold and makes her into a slave with the
other Chinese he keeps around so that the Americans can have cheap labor
to build the railroad.</P>
<P>The Emperor sends three of his best Imperial Guards to exchange her for
the gold, but Chon Wang, having a secret crush on the princess, talks
his way into going along to carry their bags. Out West, their train gets
robbed by the O'Bannon gang and Chon gets separated from the other
Imperial Guards. While in the woods, trying to figure how to get to
Carson City, he saves a Sioux Indian boy from the Crow through his
ability in the martial arts, and the chief rewards him with a squaw
(Brandon Merrill) and the Indian name of "Man-Who-Fights-In-Dress."</P>
<P>Still resolved to find the princess, he meets Roy O' Bannon again, and
the two somehow end up in jail together, and make a shaky pact to be
partners -- with Chon only interested in rescuing the princess, while
Roy is pretending to be interested in her, but really is interested only
in the gold. After they escape from jail, a ruthless and corrupt
sheriff, Van Cleef (Xander Berkeley), who rides with a posse after the
wanted desperadoes, tracks them down, and a series of comically inspired
shootouts, a spoofing of the traditional Western and of Lee Van Cleef's
spaghetti Westerns, and a chance for Jackie Chan's martial arts thing to
develop full blast, which all take place with much zest and a surprising
amount of wit (not sophisticated but the lowbrow kind).</P>
<P>Shanghai invests more time in comedy than in martial arts, using the
odd-couple relationship between Chon and Roy to its maximum comic
advantage. What results are well-executed pratfalls, lots of sight gags,
ingenuous fight scenes, some stupid ethnic jokes and the flaunting of
Indian stereotypes, but whereas those old Westerns had the bias be for
real, here's its in jest and, all the while, the film keeps the comedy
rolling on. Though not all the comedy works, the scenes of Owen in the
whorehouse were stale and offered the lowest kind of vulgarian  humor.
But there is something inexplicable about the stars that make this film
effective and able to overcome its triteness. It was better than what I
expected from a Jackie Chan Hollywood film, and credit must be given to
first-time director Tom Dey for making the film so appealing and so
people friendly. It should prove well in the box office, probably
reaching past its targeted teenage audience, and after all, this is a
business film...whose purpose is the bottom line.</P>
