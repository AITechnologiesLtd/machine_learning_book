                       A film review by Perry Mercer
                        Copyright 1997 Perry Mercer</PRE>
<P>EIGHT HEADS IN A DUFFEL BAG *1/2
starring: Joe Pesci, Andy Comeau, Kristy Swanson, David Spade, George 
Hamilton, Dyan Cannon
directed by: Tom Schulman</P>
<P>If the filmmakers thought that the film's title "EIGHT HEADS IN A DUFFLE
BAG" was a catchy and cute one, then give them points for being
distinctive. However, if you want to reward them for the premise and
value of this same movie, give them 3-D points: distasteful, decadent, 
and dumb. Instead of calling this awful film EIGHT HEADS IN A DUFFLE
BAG, how about renaming it appropriately "EIGHT BRAINLESS HEADS WHO
WROTE A MOVIE SCRIPT THAT NEEDS TO BE BURIED IN A BARF BAG". This newest
offbeat flick tries its best to be dark and comedic but ends up daub and
corruptibly contrived.
   Just as one would expect to see sunshine when the sun rises, Joe
Pesci yet again plays his redundant role as a feisty New York mob hitman
out to deliver a bag of "cut up craniums" of former wiseguys to Los
Angeles. When the hacked-up-hitmen-heads are taken by mistake from an
unknowing medical student (newcomer Andy Comeau), Pesci's frustrated
hitman character Tommy Spinelli must follow him to Mexico and retrieve
that decomposed duffle bag. Of course we follow our peculiar
protagonists to Mexico where our poor med student Charlie must meet and
greet the parents of his 
girlfriend Laurie (Kristy Swanson).  As if the movie characters and
situations are not preposterous enough,  Kristy's mother is an alcoholic
who jumps off the wagon after inadvertently seeing the heads in
Charlie's duffle bag. And her father (George
Hamilton) is an overbearing baffoon. And how convenient that the film
ships all this farce-driven excitement to Mexico where we can see yet
another barrage of Mexican 
stereotypes amongst the zaniness of these American airheads.
   EIGHT HEADS IN A DUFFLE BAG wants to be exceedingly irreverent and
naughty with its forced taboo comedy of hitmen, high jinx, and
haplessness. Unfortunately, all this film does is to remind us how
irascible one can get watching all this moronic mayhem. Writer-director
Tom Schulman has done amusing work before with funny material such as
his previous film "WHAT ABOUT BOB?". However, in EIGHT HEADS IN A
DUFFLE BAG, he overdoes his outrageousness in this film with lame and
insipid results. "HEADS" is Schulman's directing debut I must point out.
Let's hope that Schulman has better luck in the future trying to
overcome this atrocity. If you're 
going to do a dark comedy about body parts and kooky characters, make
sure your premise is fresh and unpredictable. Having Pesci do his
"gangster" goon bit for the umteenth time in the movies not to mention
featuring that smug-looking, smartalecky David Spade with his Saturday
Night Live sarcasm routine does not instill any confidence in a film
that's supposed to be unsuspecting and viciously vibrant. All the ones
responsible for this mockery of a movie need to bury their heads in the
sand, never mind in a duffle bag!</P>
<PRE>Frank rates this film: * 1/2 stars
