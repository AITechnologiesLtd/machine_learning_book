<PRE>                                HOLLOW REED
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     British couple Martyn and Hannah Wyatt are divorced but are living
in loving relationships with their live-in lovers.  Martyn has an
idyllic and monogamous relationship with his gay lover Tom Dixon.
Hannah has had similar luck with her heterosexual lover Frank Donally.
The Wyatt's son Oliver, about eight or nine, lives with Hannah, but
Martyn's has been granted "reasonable access" by the courts.</P>
<P>     This pastoral scene is shattered when a battered Oliver shows up
at his Dad's flat.  The boy explains how he was beaten up in the
commons by some strange boys.  Soon a swirl of unanswered questions
arise that make it clear that someone may be abusing Oliver, but if so,
who?  When he is hurt again, Oliver has a different explanation.  This
time he claims to have smashed his hand on an derelict car in the park.</P>
<P>     HOLLOW REED is a great film of intense power and ensemble acting
that tells the story of these two families.  Films like this defy
characterization.  The exquisite script by Neville Bolt and Paula Milne
is a thriller and a mystery, an examination of child abuse, a
discussion of what constitutes a family, an exploration of trust and
love, and most of all, a character study.  (Every time I try to tell my
friends what SLING BLADE is about, I can see from the looks on their
faces that they will never go see it.  So I fear it may be with HOLLOW
REED.  The more you know about the superficial aspects of the plot, the
less likely you are to want to see it, and yet this compelling film has
the power of SECRETS AND LIES and deserves a wide audience.)</P>
<P>     In a cast of wonderful actors, Martin Donovan, playing the father
Martyn, stands out for his incredible and yet understated performance.
Donovan is a character actor only recently coming into his own.  Most
people probably saw him last in THE PORTRAIT OF A LADY where he played
Ralph Touchett, Isabel's cousin who was dying of consumption.  As the
father in HOLLOW REED, he gives an empathetic reading of the character,
who is caring, confused, and vulnerable.  His loves his boy and
transmits his feeling of hopelessness to the audience.</P>
<P>     New film actor Sam Bould gives a touching performance as the small
boy, Ollie, at the heart of the controversy.  His big, but sunken, eyes
speak of the horrors that have befallen him even if he will not talk
about them.  You will want to hold him gently and reassure him that he
must tell the truth.  But you must know, what is he covering up and
why?</P>
<P>     Joely Richardson, who played Anita in the most recent 101
DALMATIANS, gives a complex and tender performance as the mother
Hannah.</P>
<P>     Also quite good as the respective lovers are Ian Hart (MICHAEL
COLLINS) as Tom and Jason Flemyng (STEALING BEAUTY) as Frank.</P>
<P>     In excellent minor roles, David Calder, from the BRAMWELL TV
series on Masterpiece Theater, plays Martyn's sincere, but not very
reassuring lawyer.  Even better is Edward Hardwicke as the judge who
looks as though he may require the wisdom of Solomon to sort the case
out.  Hardwicke was last seen in the film RICHARD III and as Dr. Watson
from the latest SHERLOCK HOLMES series on television.</P>
<P>     The script takes care to build a detailed story, not the outline
with which most plots content themselves.  We know that Martyn is a GP,
Hannah is a nurse, Tom works at a record store, and Frank is a
stay-at-home architect.  It also lets the characters make the stupid
but normal mistakes and false assumptions that happen in real life,
especially when a withdrawn and incommunicative child is at the center
of a predicament.</P>
<P>     Although the mystery is fairly transparent, director Angela Pope
nevertheless manages to keep the tension high.  In the best of
thrillers, of which this is one, the eerie calmness of most of the
scenes creates more foreboding than cataclysmic events ever could.
There is a composed, redemption scene that will have you wanting to
scream, "No!"  And when Hannah says, "It'll never happen again," about
the abuse, your stomach will likely go into knots.</P>
<P>     I am not going to give anything away.  If you've seen the trailers
or read any of the other reviews, you already know more than the little
I've told you.  I want you to see the film fresh so its power can
overwhelm you as it did me.  Although never manipulative, the
intelligent script and moving acting may reduce you to tears even
though almost all of the abuse happens off screen.  I saw it at a
press-only screening with only a half dozen critics present, but I
could hear frequent weeping around me.  Rarely does this happen at such
an event.</P>
<P>     The ending of the movie is strikingly photographed by Remi
Adefarasin and directed with precision and power by Angela Pope.  As
the cameras rapidly circle our players, we know the drama is at an end.
Although the brief epilog afterwards is satisfying, since it allows you
to know how the players put their lives back together, it detracts
slightly from the film's intensity.  Then again, perhaps most viewers
need that catharsis to make their emotional system whole again after
such an experience.</P>
<P>     HOLLOW REED runs 1:44.  It is not rated but would be an R for
mature themes, language, sex, and nudity.  This is not an NC-17 film,
and the abuse is of a physical and not a sexual nature.  The film would
be fine for mature teenagers.  I recommend the picture strongly and
give it *** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
