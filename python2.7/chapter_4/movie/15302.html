LA SEPARATION
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>There are certain unmistakable omens in a long-term relationship.  Anne
and Pierre, who live together with their adorable toddler, experienced
theirs at the cinema.</P>
<P>As Pierre reached over to hold Anne's hand, she pulled it away.  When he
confronted her with the faux pas later that night, she had a
devastatingly, simple answer, "You bothered me."</P>
<P>In LA SEPARATION, a film whose meanings are revealed mainly in subtle
nuances of the characters' body language, Anne's outright admission of
her displeasure forms one of the story's more explicitly dramatic
moments.</P>
<P>Eventually, Anne will nonchalantly tell Pierre that she has fallen in
love with someone else -- someone "who pays attention to me."  Since
Pierre thinks he is particularly attentive to Anne and to their son, on
whom he dotes, he is perplexed.</P>
<P>Isabelle Huppert, winner of the French best actress award in 1996 for LA
CEREMONIE, plays Anne, the film's enigma.  An attractive professional
with deep brown eyes, Anne possesses a breezy confidence.  She does what
she wants in life and isn't the least bit concerned how it might affect
those around her.  Whether she's happy or sad, she keeps her emotions
firmly in check.</P>
<P>Daniel Auteuil, winner of the French best actor award in 1996 for THE
EIGHTH DAY, plays Pierre.  Strikingly handsome and sweetly sincere,
Pierre's personality is as open as Anne's is closed.  He is sure and
certain that he wants Annie to stay with him, regardless of whether
Annie has another lover.</P>
<P>"Every couple goes through crises," one of Pierre's friends advises him.
"It's normal."  Well, the relationship that Pierre and Anne evolve into
isn't.</P>
<P>As an author (the most popular occupation, it seems, in French films),
Pierre works at home while a sexually alluring, college-age nanny takes
care of their son.  Annie doesn't see much of any of them since she
meets her other lover after work.  Still, as long as she does not leave,
Pierre's willing to go along with this.  On the surface they look like a
completely contented couple.</P>
<P>The story by Dan Franck and the director, Christian Vincent, is as
remarkable for the scenes that don't occur as those that do.  The big
angry outbursts are almost totally absent, and Anne's other lover is
only discussed but never shown.</P>
<P>In the typically French style, the characters talk incessantly.
Cinematographer Denis Lenoir keeps the camera rigid during these
talkfests, letting the two characters' heads and shoulders fill the
frame.  The movie is a character study, and the director clearly wants
us to focus on the two leads.  In order to accomplish this, he takes a
minimalist approach to the sets and the dramatic actions.  LA SEPARATION
is a subtle movie in which facial expressions are where the action is.</P>
<P>"A couple's a transient thing," Anne casually but firmly tells Pierre.
"It doesn't last forever."  Like the band on the Titanic, Anne and
Pierre keep going through the motions of the relationship, ignoring the
unrepairable hole in the side.  But beneath their false calm, they both
know it's all over.</P>
<P>LA SEPARATION runs just 1:28.  The film is in French with English
subtitles.  It is not rated but would be PG-13 for a little profanity
and mature themes and would be fine for teenagers.</P>
