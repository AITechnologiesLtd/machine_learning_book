***1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>James Cmaeron's breakthrough feature was the first of his films to 
showcase his obsession with technology and more specfically technology run
amok. For those of you who do not know the plot: in 2029 machines have
engineered a nuclear for the expressed purpose of wiping out the human
race. Human survivors are systematically hunted down and destroyed.
However, some humans are fighting back led by the heroic John Connor. To
stop Connor, the machines send a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back
to 1984 to murder Connor's mother, Sara (Linda Hamilton), and thus prevent
Connor from ever being born. In response, the humans send a protector,
Kyle Reese, played by Michael Biehn.</P>
<P>Images of machines and of humans' reliance on machines
dominate the film. Even though the characters know that the benign
oil drillers of 1984 will become the ruthless hunter killers of 2029,
humans continue to use the machines. In the climax of STAR WARS, Luke
relies on the Force alone--his own spiritual power--to destroy the Death
Star. In THE TERMINATOR, however, Sara must use another machine--a giant
hydraulic press--to vanquish her enemy. Cameron seems to be implying that
this reliance on technology is inescapable--and he's not happy about it.</P>
<P>Unabated technological growth brings about THE TERMINATOR's other
obsession: the apocalypse. We have plenty of imagery regarding armageddon:
thousands of human skulls line the streets of future LA. Children watch
the flames in a burning television. When the Terminator arrives in 1984 an
almost Biblical lightning storm precedes him. </P>
<P>Even though the "future is not set," there is no doubt about where
the world is headed at the end of the movie: the machines will rise and
the humans will have to struggle for their very existence. All Sara can do
is await it. (Cameron doesn't wimp out like he does in TERMINATOR 2)</P>
<P>The end of the world is the human race's own fault, too. After all
it is the humans that created in the evil machines in the first place.
Back in 1984, when the Cold War was still in full effect, the film must
have been seen as a very apt metaphor for nuclear war (another obsession
of Cameron's). </P>
<P>These days, one can read a criticism of machine-like behavior in
humans. True, humanizing touches are put into Paul Winfield's and Lance
Henriksen's detective characters, but the Terminator is also able to move
through the city undetected. Cameron also draw parallels between the
mechanical efficiency between the Terminator and Reese when they first
arrive in 1984 LA.</P>
<P>From a technical standpoint THE TERMINATOR is very well done.
Arnold Schwarzenegger is a perfect antagonist--unstoppable, merciless,
obdurate. We are not meant to empathize with this ultimate killing machine
as we are in some of Schwarzenegger's later works (eg, COMMANDO), but fear
him.</P>
<P>Cameron and Hurd's script basically depicts a one hour and
forty-five minute chase, taking a few moments here and there to explain
time travel and develop the romantic subplot. While we do see the
hackneyed dialogue Cameron is now so well known for, there is also
considerable suspense especially for the first time viewer who may
be unsure of Kyle Reese's intentions.</P>
<P>Cameron directs the film at a rapid, kinetic pace. Either the
camera is moving or something within the frame is moving--usually
both occurs. The violence is not particularly graphic (TEMPLE OF DOOM's
heart-pull scene outgrosses THE TERMINATOR's), but it is brutally staged
making it that much more effective.</P>
<P>For a low budget film, THE TERMINATOR's special effects and art
direction (especially in 2029 LA) are remarkably well done. Special
mention should be made of the stop motion effects work at the end of the
film depicting the Terminator Endoskeleton. It is some of the best stop
motion I have ever seen.</P>
<P>One thing that doesn't hold up after all the years, however, is
Linda Hamilton's hairdo.</P>
