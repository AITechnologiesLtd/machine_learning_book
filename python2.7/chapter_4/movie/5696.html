<P>     Each week, the magazine "Entertainment Weekly" includes a blurb in
their movie section which compares the opinions of several national
critics.  Their ratings are averaged and compared to the weekly results
of an audience exit poll.  Not surprisingly, the public tends thinks
more of most movies than the critics do.  One of the explanations for
this might involve the concept of popular versus critical opinion.  I
won't go down *that* road.  Another likely reason is the simple fact
that most people want to enjoy what they pay for, even if they don't
really like it.  Think about that.  Add in the price of popcorn, plus
the investment of time required to wait in traffic, wait in the lobby,
and wait for the trailers to end, and you're stuck in a situation where
the only alternative to feeling good about a movie, is to feel shame for
the wasted effort.  For this reason, I presume that most folks will
*not* be walking out of THE FRIGHTENERS, a failed supernatural comedy
that is nearly unwatchable for the first thirty minutes.</P>
<P>    The beginning is the worst-- a sloppy, incoherent mess that shows
such silliness as a woman (Dee Wallace Stone) being chased through an
old mansion by special-effects induced apparitions, a short "psychic
investigator" (Michael J. Fox) attempting to crash a funeral, and that
same person later careening down a hill in an out-of-control jalopy.
Huh?  Is bad driving what New Zealand director Peter Jackson (HEAVENLY
CREATURES) thinks is funny to us Americans?  Next comes the appearance
of a floating Elvis statue-- "he lives," utters an unbeliever-- and the
discovery that Fox's character is a con man, thankyouverymuch.  Though
he really *can* see the spooks, he's actually on fairly friendly terms
with them.  They help him scare up business.  Of course, nobody in the
small coastal town is particularly fazed by these ghoulish goings-on.
Maybe they've seen GHOSTBUSTERS a few too many times, but the residents
sure take their psychic investigator in stride.  Just as they seem
unfazed by a recent rash of inexplicable deaths...</P>
<P>     Mercifully, the movie gets (a bit) better as it goes.  The human
element is execrable, but a clever cast of Caspers often amuses.  Chi
McBride is funny as a jive-talking spirit still wearing bell- bottoms.
That's John Astin under make-up as the (literally) jaw- dropping Judge;
he has some salacious fun with an Egyptian mummy.  Also look for a
memorable appearance by R. Lee Ermey, reprising his FULL METAL JACKET
role as a deceased drill instructor.  I rather enjoyed all the
oppressive imagery of death and decay.  You may want to leave the
younger ones at home, though, as the rotting corpses and dusty skeletons
may send them screaming into the lobby.  Heh, heh.  A macabre finale,
set inside of an abandoned hospital, is the high-point of this low
movie.  Jackson cross-cuts between the present (Fox and Trini Alvarado
in peril) and the past (Jake Busey as a mass-murdering orderly) and it's
a grisly gas.  With exploding heads and carved foreheads, the sequence
might even have been scary, if the rest of the movie hadn't so
completely dulled our senses. </P>
