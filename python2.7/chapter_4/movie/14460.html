<PRE>                          THE PARENT TRAP 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                      Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
    2 :-) :-) out of 4, for a rose coloured view of family disharmony</PRE>
<P>Cast: Lindsay Lohan, Dennis Quaid, Natasha Richardson, Elaine Hendrix,
Lisa Ann Walter, Simon Kunz.
Screenplay: David Swift and Nancy Meyers & Charles Shyer, based on "Das
Doppelte Lottchen" by Erich Kastner.
Director: Nancy Meyers.</P>
<P>The danger of revamping a Disney classic is that it becomes unbelievably
difficult for the successor, to fill the shoes of the original. Try as
you might to revive the magical feel of the first Parent Trap, somehow
the nineties version lacks the same charm and grace, that made the first
an instant hit.</P>
<P>For beginners, Lindsay Lohan, the new Hallie and Annie Parker, who try
to reunite their long separated parents, somehow lacks the adorable
cheek of the original Hayley Mills. The basic story line is much the
same from memory, throw in a butler and a maid and the matchmaking
begins. If one word were needed to describe this film, it would be
incredibly perky.</P>
<P>If one knows the story line already, you may question why two seemingly
sensible adults, like Elizabeth James (Natasha Richardson) and Nick
Parker (Denis Quaid), would split up so quickly after the birth of their
daughter's; each taking a twin to care for on opposite sides of the
earth. There is no answer, and the question remains unanswered. They
just need to be apart, or the novelty of two girls finding out they're
twins would be lost, and the fun, pranks and plotting would not begin.</P>
<P>If anything, this movie brings some hope to those children who are
hurting after the separation or divorce of their parents. However,
Disney has a rather simple minded knack of superficially dealing with
such problems - the magical ending suggests that everyone lives happily
ever after. Unfortunately, the reality is that many parents don't get
back together, and the children carry much of the pain of family
break-ups into their adult life. Perhaps, the more truthful, unhappy
ending, which Disney has so obviously avoided, is the fact that
Elizabeth James and Nick Parker would in reality never get back together
again. But such is the policy of Disney, that this remote possibility
could never be so.</P>
