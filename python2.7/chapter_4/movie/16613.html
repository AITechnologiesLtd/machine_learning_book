<P>Unpolished and ungainly, but thoroughly likable, "Blast From The Past" is 
the conceptual opposite of last year's magnificent "Pleasantville." Where 
"Pleasantville" magically threw two contemporary teens into the 
monochromatic world of a "Father Knows Best" style '50s sitcom, "Blast 
>From The Past" takes a young man raised in complete isolation with 
wholesome early '60s values and thrusts him into modern-day Los Angeles. 
But while "Pleasantville" addressed a variety of serious issues, "Blast 
>From The Past" makes only passing glances at social commentary, instead 
keeping the focus on silliness. Due to some inspired casting choices, the 
fish-out-of-water comedy succeeds more often than not.</P>
<P>It begins in 1962, at a cocktail party held by affluent suburbanite 
Calvin Webber (Christopher Walken) and his pregnant wife Helen (Sissy 
Spacek). Moments after friends in another room remark that Calvin, while 
a brilliant scientist and wonderful husband, is more than a little 
paranoid, President Kennedy appears on TV with grim news about the Cuban 
Missile Crisis. Fearing the worst, Webber sends his guests home, then 
retreats to the family's incredibly elaborate bomb shelter, hidden 
beneath the house. Just as he is closing the hatch, a small plane crashes 
into his roof. Mistakenly convinced that the Big One has decimated the 
planet, Webber sets the shelter release timer for 35 years, his estimate 
of when it will be safe to return to the surface.</P>
<P>With their radio destroyed by the plane crash, the Webbers are completely 
isolated from the outside, sealed into a 1962 mindset. When Helen gives 
birth, the couple optimistically christen the child Adam and devote 
themselves to raising the consummate Renaissance man. Adam grows into 
adulthood with dreams of seeing the sky, while Dad teaches him about 
science, sports and the art of avoiding both Communists and post-war 
mutants. Meanwhile, Mom schools the boy in manners, dance and proper 
courtship of young ladies. Finally, the day comes for the now-grown Adam 
(Brendan Fraser) to venture forth onto the surface, which, on a drizzly 
night in urban L.A., bears a remarkable resemblance to the post-Atomic 
world his father anticipated.</P>
<P>"Blast From The Past" is divided into two sections. The first, a portrait 
of the Webbers' life underground, works because it offers the rare 
opportunity to watch Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek do comedy. 
Walken takes his standard slightly-demented persona and gives it a benign 
twist, with delightful results. While bemoaning the destruction of 
humanity, Calvin thrives in the bomb shelter, quite pleased with himself 
for having the foresight and resourcefulness to have sealed his family 
safely from the devastation. Walken makes Calvin an appealing anachronism,
 a deliciously geeky spin on Ward Cleaver. Meanwhile, Spacek plays Helen 
as June Cleaver quietly coming apart at the seams. Ever the dutiful wife 
and mother, she nonetheless succumbs to a massive case of cabin fever, 
seeking solace by taking slugs of any available liquor. The desperate 
character could have become cartoonish or tragic, but Spacek maintains 
just the right tone to keep Helen believable and funny.</P>
<P>The second part of the film chronicles Adam's adventures on the surface, 
with a nifty performance from Brendan Fraser making up for numerous weak 
spots. Fraser is an exceptional serious actor, most recently evidenced by 
his outstanding work in "Gods and Monsters," but he also possesses a real 
gift for comedy, particularly when playing lovable, innocent goofballs. 
Fraser shined in "George of the Jungle" because, instead of being overly 
cautious about protecting his leading man image, he threw himself into 
the role completely, and his gusto was irresistible. He is particularly 
adroit here, beginning his journey as a total babe-in-the-woods, then, 
using a series of subtle stylistic moves, transforming Adam into a 
romantic hero, without ever betraying the character.</P>
<P>I wish more of Fraser's portion of the film had shown such subtlety. A 
running gag about a group of burn-outs who build a cult around the 
Webbers would have been funnier if it had been toned down. As a cynical 
young woman who reluctantly serves as mentor for Adam (guess what her 
first name is), Alicia Silverstone must act excessively wary of him 
solely because that's how romantic comedies are structured. Silverstone 
displays ample energy, but her suspicious shtick grows old quickly. </P>
<P>On a brighter note, "NewsRadio" star Dave Foley takes one of contemporary 
film's most tiresome character clichés, the gay best friend, and makes 
him sparkle, using his limpid eyes and sharp phrasing to maximum effect. 
For fans of Foley's "The Kids in the Hall" days, he plays Troy as an 
smart, sincere cross between Hecubus and the "Steps" guy. For everybody 
else, well... he's damn good.   </P>
<P>Despite being structurally sloppy and going for the obvious jokes too 
often, "Blast From The Past" is a lot of fun, thanks to some ingenious 
moments and the efforts of its exceptional cast. No one will mistake this 
for comic gold, but it's an amusing, affable way to spend 106 minutes, 
and sometimes that's enough.</P>
