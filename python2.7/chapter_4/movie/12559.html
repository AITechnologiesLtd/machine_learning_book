<P>Nearly all of Balzac's novels dramatize Karl Marx's observation in the
Communist Manifesto that "The bourgeoisie has torn away from the
family its sentimental veil, and has reduced the family relation into
a mere money relation." Des McAnuff's film "Cousin Bette," based on
Balzac's novel of the same name, is faithful to both Balzac and Marx
on this score.</P>
<P>This is no bland and pretty costume drama in the Merchant-Ivory mold.
The aristocrats and the haut-bourgeoisie are repellent gargoyles in
McAnuff's film, just as they are in Balzac. The film is a gritty,
radical satire of bourgeois mores that constantly reminds us of the
price-tag attached to all human relations. McAnuff explains what drew
him to the Balzac novel:</P>
<P>"When it comes to choosing a project, I look for something that
illuminates my life and times. 'Cousin Bette' began to feel more and
more like a story about a large American city, where we have perhaps
some of the same social and political problems that Paris faced in the
nineteenth century...Paris was in a depression in the 1840s and no one
in fact saw the turmoil coming. Having gone through the riots in Los
Angeles, it began to feel remarkably similar. When I saw this link to
current times, that's when I really climbed aboard and started to
shape the story."</P>
<P>Cousin Bette (Jessica Lange) is a forty year old seamstress who works
backstage in a music hall. Her sister has just passed away and she
hopes to snag the wealthy grieving husband Hector Hulot (Hugh Laurie).
When he meets with her, he certainly seems to have this intention
since he speaks about the vacuum in his life and the need for someone
to look after his college-age daughter. To her disappointment, she
discovers that he is merely offering her a job as a housekeeper. This
blow to her self-esteem ratchets up her resentment against the world
one more notch. While she is the protagonist of the film, one can feel
no sympathy toward her or any of the other characters for that matter.
The key to the success of the film, and the novel it is based on, is
that it caters to our morbid curiosity. The cast of players, who are
all essentially corrupt and money-hungry, fascinate us like a bunch of
scorpions under glass.</P>
<P>We are introduced to Hulot's daughter Hortense (Kelly MacDonald) as
she is being propositioned by the superrich Crevel (Bob Hoskins), who
offers her 200,000 francs to look at her naked body. She turns him
down.</P>
<P>Another central character is the young, handsome fallen aristocrat
Wenceslas (Aden Young) who lives in poverty in the same rundown
tenement as Cousin Bette. He is trying rather unsuccessfully to launch
a career as a sculptor. At night he tiptoes into her apartment in
order to steal cheese from her rat-trap and sneak a drink of wine from
the bottle she keeps on a shelf. He is not aware that she has been
awake when he makes these nocturnal visits and, moreover, has fallen
in love with him.</P>
<P>One day Cousin Bette discovers Wenceslas unconscious in his flat,
where he has tried to kill himself by filling the room with fumes from
his coal-stove. She throws open the window and revives him. Then she
offers to subsidize his career, albeit in a modest fashion. She will
pay for his rent and his meals, but emphasizes that she will keep a
strict account of all sums advanced. Like Crevel, she is consumed with
love but knows that everything has a cash value as well.</P>
<P>The singer-dancer Jenny Cadine (Elisabeth Shue) rounds out the cast of
miscreants. In her spare time, she is courtesan to Hulot. We meet her
onstage as she is complaining that her costume does not show off her
best features. Cousin Bette, her seamstress, approaches her from
behind and cuts a large patch in the fabric covering her backside. She
then announces that everybody can now see the star performer's best
feature. Jenny looks at her naked ass and likes what she sees. From
that night on, she performs bare-assed.</P>
<P>After Wenceslas has become Cousin Bette's protégé, the young Hortense
decides to steal him away. After Bette discovers that the two have
become lovers, she confronts him in his studio. What about us, she
asks. He tells her that he will always love her as the mother in his
life. This rejection inspires her to take revenge against all who have
caused her misery and disappointment. Like Iago, she conspires behind
the scenes to set one character against another until they are all
ruined. In contradistinction to Othello, the major character in
Balzac's tale is the villain, not the hero. Since Balzac's cynical
world-view excludes heroism, this has an air-tight logic. Furthermore,
in some sense, villains are more interesting. Milton's Lucifer is one
of the great characters in literature. We remember him, not any of the
angels.</P>
<P>One of the greatest achievements of the film is the casting and the
way McAnuff directs his cast. You lose track of the associations you
have with the various actors in previous films and only know them as
the Balzac characters. Jessica Lange is perfect as the dark and
vengeful Bette. Hugh Laurie, best known for his Bertie Wooster on the
PBS series, brings the vain spendthrift aristocrat Hulot to life.
Hoskins has often played vulgarians, so his perfection as Crevel comes
as no surprise. What is a surprise, however, is Elisabeth Shue's Jenny
Cadine. Shue is best known for her role as another prostitute in
"Leaving Las Vegas." What she brings to the role of Jenny is a keen
sense of the class antagonism between her and Hulot, who pays for her
love. When he--or any other of her wealthy clients--can no longer pay
for her services, she instantly turns cold and haughty. As such, she
is the perfect illustration of Marx's dictum that capitalism has left
no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than
callous "cash payment." By implication, the same thing is true of man
and woman.</P>
<P>What makes "Cousin Bette" exceptional cinema is the modernist
aesthetic vision of director Des McAnuff, who never worked in film
before. He is a two-time Tony Award-winner ("Tommy," "Big River") who
understood completely how to bring Balzac alive. He has entirely
rejected the temptation to romanticize 19th century France. Thus,
certain directorial decisions make perfect sense, among them the
decision to use cinematographer Andrzej Sekula, who worked previously
on "Pulp Fiction" and "Reservoir Dogs." Instead of the languid camera
work of an Ivory-Merchant film that dotes self-consciously on
wallpaper or petticoats, we get a hard-edged vision of the underbelly
of French society.</P>
<P>McAnuff was clear about the look he expected from Sekula:</P>
<P>"This film is about outsiders and insiders, about
contrasts...Visually, it was a question of finding a chateau for the
Hulots that was spacious and had that fading first Empire look,
reflecting the end of an age of abundance and plenty. Then, we wanted
to contrast that with Bette's neighborhood, a medieval city that was
suffering from the diseases of the early industrial revolution...We
wanted to avoid romanticizing the suffering of the people...We wanted
cobblestone streets, very narrow lanes, a sense of claustrophobia,
almost a rat's maze, full of smoke, coal dust and dung, alongside
spectacular eighteenth century architecture."</P>
<P>In other words, he wanted to convey sharp class distinctions.</P>
<P>The film concludes with fighting in the streets as the  revolution of
1848 erupts. The decadence of aristocrats and haut-bourgeoisie like
Hulot, Wenceslas and Crevel has finally brought the masses into the
streets. The most resolute section of the masses was the proletariat,
of whom Marx wrote the following in "Class Struggles in France
1848-1850":</P>
<P>"It is well known how the workers, with unexampled bravery and
ingenuity, without leaders, without a common plan, without means and,
for the most part, lacking weapons, held in check for five days the
army, the Mobile Guard, the Paris National Guard, and the National
Guard that streamed in from the provinces. It is well known how the
bourgeoisie compensated itself for the mortal anguish it suffered by
unheard -- of brutality, massacring over 3000 prisoners. The official
representatives of French democracy were steeped in republican
ideology to such an extent that it was only some weeks later that they
began to have an inkling of the significance of the June fight. They
were stupefied by the gunpowder smoke in which their fantastic
republic dissolved."</P>
<P>Balzac hated the bourgeoisie and workers equally. Only as the
industrial working-class became better organized politically and more
self-confident, did novelists such as Zola begin to champion its
cause. Balzac's importance is that he wrote brilliantly about the
social decay that capitalism breeds. Thus, he is a novelist who
remains very contemporary. As such, McAnuff's bitter, dark comedy
"Cousin Bette" does Balzac perfect justice.</P>
