<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>I admit, I had some concerns about "Hannibal" heading into the theatre. 
Thomas Harris' novel of the same name (unread by me) was hardly a critical 
darling, and neither "Silence Of The Lambs" director Jonathan Demme nor 
Clarice Starling originator Jodie Foster -- in many ways the lynchpin of 
the earlier movie -- were returning for the new installment. Sequels are 
often a mixed bag, anyway: for every successful follow-up such as "The 
Godfather Part II", there have been dozens of odious imitators like "The 
Lost World".</P>
<P>As a sequel to "Silence" and as a movie in its own right, "Hannibal" falls 
somewhere around the upper middle of the pack. Certainly, it is very 
different from its predecessor -- whereas that film was a taught, 
atmospheric thriller, "Hannibal" tends toward dark comedy. "Silence" 
boasted a superb, absorbing plot; "Hannibal" is almost entirely a 
character piece, with a patchwork story which primarily exists as a 
showcase for the title cannibal. And make no mistake, this movie is 
entirely owned by the murderous Hannibal Lecter, played once again by 
Anthony Hopkins.</P>
<P>When last we saw him at the end of "Silence", Lecter had escaped custody 
and fled to Europe. "Hannibal" picks up the story a decade on, with Lecter 
masquerading as the interim head of a Florence art museum. Investigating 
the disappearance of the museum's previous director is the 
unfortunately-named Inspector Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini), who soon 
uncovers the truth about Lecter's identity. Rather than bring his 
suspicions to his police superiors, however, Pazzi keeps the knowledge to 
himself, hoping to capture Lecter and win the substantial reward offered 
by American millionaire Mason Verger (Gary Oldman).</P>
<P>Verger, it transpires, was the only survivor of Hannibal's original 
killing spree. A paedophile, Verger had been placed in Lecter's 
psychiatric care, only to suffer abhorrent tortures at the murderer's 
hands, resulting in his gruesome disfigurement. Verger wants revenge on 
Lecter, and has secretly engaged the services of FBI lawyer Paul Krendler 
(Ray Liotta), who puts him in touch with Agent Clarice Starling (now 
played by Julianne Moore). Starling has problems all her own: a drug bust 
gone wrong has threatened her entire career. As Verger draws the threads 
of his plan together, it is only a matter of time before Hannibal and 
Clarice meet once more.</P>
<P>As good as Foster was in "Silence", few people will dispute that it was 
Hopkins' portrayal of Lecter that was the most memorable aspect of that 
much-laurelled film -- despite the fact that he was on-screen for less 
than one-fifth of the running time. In "Hannibal", Hopkins takes centre 
stage, and his performance is more than up to the challenge. Lecter is 
truly a quintessential movie villain, up there with Darth Vader and Bela 
Lugosi's Dracula. Despite his atrocities, no matter how inherently 
reprehensible his bloody lifestyle, Lecter is charming and captivating. If 
you had to be eaten by a fellow human being, is there anyone you'd rather 
have devour your kidneys than Hannibal the Cannibal?</P>
<P>Much of the attraction of the character comes from the deep conviction 
Hopkins brings to the role. Yes, by traditional human morality, Lecter is 
a monster. But, in Hopkins' hands, Hannibal is lifted beyond such 
pedestrian mores: he is a law unto himself, adhering to his own beliefs in 
spite of society. Even his murders have their own perverse logic and 
nobility. In some ways, then, he is a classic anti-hero (albeit as warped 
an anti-hero as they come), a man who refuses to let petty strictures 
deter him from how he wants to live his life. Consequently, it is 
difficult not to admire Lecter's clarity of self; add to this his 
gentlemanly demeanour and you have a perfect role model (well, if only he
didn't kill and devour people).</P>
<P>So engrossing is Hopkins' performance that all else pales in comparison. 
Particularly ill-served is Clarice, who is even more of a secondary 
character here than Hannibal was in "Silence". It is not surprising that 
Foster turned down the picture, which barely develops the character beyond 
her earlier appearance. Moore's version of the role is at best 
serviceable, but it seems clear that this is the fault of the script and 
not the actress.</P>
<P>Oldman does what he can with Verger, but his madman is doomed to toil in 
the shadow of Hannibal. So firmly ensconced is Hopkins in his role that 
Oldman simply cannot compete. Similarly, Giannini is never entirely 
satisfying as Pazzi -- the character lacks substance and motivation, and 
his ultimate fate is so clearly telegraphed that it is difficult to feel 
much connection with him.</P>
<P>But maybe that's entirely intentional. Rather appropriate to the European 
setting which dominates its first half, "Hannibal" is a rare Hollywood 
example of Grand Guignol, the late-nineteenth century French theatrical 
tradition of comedies thick with rape, murder and deeds equally heinous. 
Given how firmly established Hannibal's culinary preferences are in the 
minds of the audience, director Ridley Scott and scriptwriter Steven 
Zaillian (David Mamet authored an earlier, discarded draft) mine them for 
a number of creepy laughs. This builds up to a truly revolting -- yet 
somehow uncomfortably funny -- climax which will, I expect, cause the
cancellation of any number of dinner parties in the next few weeks.</P>
<P>But, for all the Grand Guignol trappings of "Hannibal", Zaillian and Scott 
have otherwise forgotten to give the movie a real sense of story. There is 
a disjointed, episodic feel to events: even the aforementioned dinner 
scene feels like a tacked-on coda rather than a natural development of the 
plot. As a result, "Hannibal" possesses none of the atmosphere of 
"Silence", and for all its gross-out moments is nowhere near as scary.</P>
<P>Were the movie theatre a circus, "The Silence Of The Lambs" would be the 
centre ring. "Hannibal", on the other hand, would be the freak show just 
outside the main tent -- watchable and even mesmerising in its own right, 
but not something that will have stayed with its audience ten years later.</P>
