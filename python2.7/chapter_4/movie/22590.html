<P>GALAXY QUEST:  By Grabthar's Hammer, What A Movie!</P>
<P>by Curtis Edmonds -- <A HREF="mailto:blueduck@hsbr.org">blueduck@hsbr.org</A></P>
<P>The only thing wrong with Galaxy Quest is that it was released at the
wrong time of year.  If any film ever deserved a mid-February release,
it is this one.  For Star Trek fans (and you know who you are) Galaxy
Quest is a great big gushy Valentine of a movie.  Galaxy Quest is to
Star Trek, in a way, what Shakespeare in Love is to Shakesperian
theater:  a warm-hearted, affectionally satirical love-letter.  Both
movies poke fun at their respective conventions while staying true to
that which is important.</P>
<P>(Not to say that The Trouble With Tribbles is equivalent to Romeo and
Juliet, mind you, just trying to make a point here.)</P>
<P>Galaxy Quest works because it hits the three points of the Star Trek
strategic triad:  the actors, the fans, and the show itself.  The movie
begins with the crew of the USS Enterprise... ahem, that's the NSES
Protector, sorry, preparing for their appearance at a convention.  Like
the Star Trek actors, the Galaxy Quest actors are trapped in Stereotype
Hell:  they can neither get another acting job nor escape their fans.
Some, such as Sigourney Weaver's communicatons officer, are touched but
bemused by the attention.  Others, like Alan Rickman's obligatory alien
life form, are sick to the point of despair at the prospect of another
sci-fi convention.</P>
<P>And then, way at the far end of the spectrum, there's Tim Allen, playing
actor Jason Nesmeth, playing Galaxy Quest star Commander Peter Quincy
Taggart.  Nesmeth is an egomaniac of staggering, galactic, even (if I
may say so) Shatnerian proportions.  (One even expects him to take off
his toupee at one point, such is the resemblance.)  Naturally, he loves
the attention from the fans, though he doesn't understand it.
Naturally, he hogs the limelight, to the annoyance of his co-stars.  And
naturally, he's the one who gets kidnapped by a race of space aliens who
believe that the "Galaxy Quest" show is real and that he can command
their replica starship to victory over the space lizards.</P>
<P>This starts the show, which we'll get to in a moment.  First, a word
about the fans, who are at once the core audience for Galaxy Quest and
the target for much of its satire. Accordingly, Galaxy Quest has adopted
an attitude that's mocking, yet respectful.  Most of the comedy directed
towards the fans is in the form of sight gags -- middle aged people
walking around with alien makeup on their heads.  It's possible that
some fans might take offense to this portrayal -- the woman in Arkansas
who showed up to the Clinton trial decked out in Starfleet regalia comes
to mind -- but the mockery in Galaxy Quest is nothing if not
affectionate.  (There is a Shatneresque explosion directed towards one
fan by Allen, but Allen gets his comeuppance, you just watch.)</P>
<P>The real true fans of the show are the Thermians, the alien race that
constructed the "Protector 2".  They have been monitoring Earth
television and are so convinced that what they see on TV is real that
they have remodeled their entire civilization around "Galaxy Quest"
reruns.  (Star Trek fans will recognize this as one of the show's
typical conceits -- the original show featured alien civilizations based
on the Roman Empire, Chicago gangsters, and even the Nazis.)  When the
Thermians show up at the hung-over Allen's house, he takes one look at
their pasty faces and Moe Howard haircuts and assumes they are fans.
(One wonders if this is an everyday occurence for Shatner.)</P>
<P>Allen's Buzz Lightyear character in Toy Story 2 asks himself at one
point, "Was I ever that deluded?"  Allen is plenty deluded here, at
first, thinking that the Thermian vessel is just an elaborate set.
(This is one of more existential moments in Galaxy Quest:  you have an
actor on an elaborate set playing the part of an actor who thinks he's
on an elaborate set.)  Allen, however, eventually realizes the truth and
hustles back to collect his "crew" for another joyride.</P>
<P>This is where the real show begins, and it's a splendid, hysterical
farce.  Galaxy Quest manages, one way or another, to spoof every single
Star Trek episode there ever was.  Every one of the show's conventions
is gleefully, impishly trashed to the point that I won't even bother to
catalog the goofiness.  The Galaxy Quest screenwriters are operating
with an immense amount of knowledge about the Star Trek universe -- so
much so that one wonders if they haven't been to a few sci-fi
conventions themselves -- but they manage to distill it all down into a
series of funny skits that should delight even those who have never seen
the show.</P>
<P>Like Star Trek itself, Galaxy Quest is an ensemble piece.  And like the
Star Trek actors themselves, the Galaxy Quest actors have experienced
stereotyping themselves.  The underappreciated Sigourney Weaver is back
in space again, but she's cleverly cast as the anti-Ripley, a blonde
bombshell with little to do and less to wear.  After his boffo
performance in Die Hard, Alan Rickman was typecast into sardonic villain
roles, and he appears here as a sardonic good guy.  (Unfortunately, he
doesn't steal the show hear to the degree and extent that he stole the
show in Dogma.)  Tony Shalhoub and Daryl "Chill" Mitchell are both
refugees from Must-See-TV ("Wings" and "The John Larroquette Show",
respectively).  Mitchell isn't given much to do, unfortunately.
Shalhoub isn't given much more, but he makes the most of what he has --
including one line that still makes me giggle every time I think about
it.</P>
<P>Tim Allen, of course, has the most stereotyping of anyone on the crew.
It's hard to say if Allen is a victim of stereotyping or if he just
doesn't have much range as an actor.  (Probably both.)  Nevertheless,
this is the perfect part for him, and he plays it with brio.  Allen is
allowed here to be cocky, overconfident, and incompetent but still be
charming and funny.</P>
<P>If Galaxy Quest is too early to be a Valentine, it is the funniest New
Year's card you'll get.  Star Trek fans will howl with laughter, kids
will giggle uncontrollably, and everyone else will, at least, be
entertained.  Go see it.</P>

<P>"JANUARY 1, 1000:  This was the historic day that humanity celebrated
the dawn of our current millennium. The occasion was marked by feasting,
dancing, and the public beheading of a whiny, tedious group of people
who would not stop insisting that, technically, the new millennium did not
begin until January 1, 1001."  -- Dave Barry</P>
