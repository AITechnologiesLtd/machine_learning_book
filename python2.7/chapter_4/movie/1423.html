<PRE>                                  SPOTSWOOD
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1992 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     SPOTSWOOD is an Australian film directed by Mark Joffee, from a
screenplay by Max Dann and Andrew Knight and based on their novel.  It
stars Anthony Hopkins, Ben Mendelsohn, Rebecca Rigg, Toni Collette,
Alwyn Kurts, and Russell Crowe.  Rated PG for mature humor.</P>
<P>     SPOTSWOOD is a modest, small film with a lazy pace and one of the
most acclaimed film actors of this decade, Anthony Hopkins.  More
importantly for me, it also featured a fresh cast of characters,
especially the endearingly awkward Ben Mendelsohn and the plain and
beautifully strong Toni Collette.  This film will remind you of a number
of others, LOCAL HERO being the most obvious.  It begins like one of
those whimsical comedies of postwar Britain that celebrated eccentricity
and working-class virtues, this time with a lot of daffy people at a
moccasin factory, schlepping around in fuzzy bedroom slippers and
quilted bathrobes, a factory where the real product is a tight little
family of happy people.  Hopkins enters this fool's paradise (it is
going broke, after all) like a serpent to help the owner save the
business by destroying it, cutting out manufacturing, trimming the
staff, and introducing capitalist discipline.</P>
<P>     The opening sequence, as Hopkins and the audience explore the Balls
Moccasin factory for first time and get our first incredulous ganders at
its loony inmates, is very funny, very charming, and tightly paced.  And
then director Mark Joffee abruptly pulls the plug on his own momentum.
The movie continues in this uneven way to its inevitable end.
Certainly, the story holds no surprises, and the point of the film is
the characters; we do learn to care about them and to see past their
eccentricities.  We also learn to dislike one or two of them, the ones
who will never learn from this cast of industrial no-shows.  Hopkins'
character, Wallace, of course, is not amongst the short list of true and
lasting bad-uns, and we and he have a wonderful 1/24th-scale slot-car
racing sequence to thank for that.</P>
<P>     Hopkins is a fair treat.  He is more like the Hopkins of 84 CHARING
CROSS ROAD than either Hannibal Lecter or Henry Wilcox of HOWARDS END,
but then there's this little eye tic, this one chilly sentence, or the
briefest return of a disused smile that are texts on art of small
gestures and great acting.</P>
<P>     By the way, Russell Crowe was last seen in the U.S. in the
Australian film PROOF, this time playing quite a different sort of
character.  However, whereas PROOF came as close to being a perfect film
as I've seen in a long while, SPOTSWOOD is far from perfect.  It is
sweet, good natured, well intended, and entertaining; what it lacks is
sustained energy.</P>
<P>     I can recommend SPOTSWOOD, but not at full price.  It is receiving
a somewhat wider release than a small film from Oz would normally be
accorded thanks to the box-office power of Hopkins.</P>
