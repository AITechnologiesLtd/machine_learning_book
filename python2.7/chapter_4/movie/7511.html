                       A film review by David Wilcock
                        Copyright 1997 David Wilcock</PRE>
<PRE>STARRING JIM CARREY
DIRECTED BY TOM SHADYAC
A UNIVERSAL PICTURES RELEASE</PRE>
<P>After the lacklustre success of The Cable Guy, you would think that Jim
Carreys career might have been over. But (sadly?) it isn't. Thankfully,
however, he has actually made a funny film. Yes, thats right, funny.</P>
<P>Jim Carrey plays a lawyer, who, naturally, lies. But he also lies to his son
a lot aswell. So, on his birthday
(the sons, not Carreys) he wishes that his dad cannot tell a lie for 24hrs.
And, of course, hilarous
consequences ensure. </P>
<P>This film is good, mainly becuase of Carreys mugging. Watching his face
screw up when he's desprately
trying to lie is hillarous, and theres also a few good one liners in it. </P>
<P>Sadly, the film gets a little too bogged down with emotion, (with a sickly
sweet sequence at the end) but
generally this film is enjoyable.</P>
<P>In fact, this is the funniest movie Jim Carrey has done. And its far better
than the terrible The Cable Guy. I
recommended it to anyone who finds Jim Carreys face hillarous, and people
who want to see Jim Carrey for the first time. </P>
<PRE>RATING=***1/2 out of *****
