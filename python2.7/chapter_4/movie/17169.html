<P>   "Ravenous" tries to be both a hoot and a horror but despite
some breathtaking photography succeeds in being neither. 
The targeted audience is probably teen-aged males who
probably would not have the title word in their vocabularies. 
To get an idea of its driving force, pretend you are in poor
health: you have fierce headaches, your skin is always pale,
five cavities are diagnosed during your last dental visit, and
you're afflicted with borderline tuberculosis.  Then a
pharmaceutical company discovers a cure but there's a heavy
price, more than you can easily afford.  Would you buy the
prescription drug?  Of course you would.  You would pay any
price.  Now make believe that the drug does not exist but
health practitioners discovered that eating the flesh of dead
human beings could shape you up.  Could you go for it? 
Sounds disgusting, but probably, yes.  Push the envelope a
notch or two further.  You have to kill other human beings
because the flesh must be fresh.  No?  Probably not.  But
don't put this solution past some people, particularly those
with addictive personalities, for whom the sense of elation will
cause them to turn their backs on the usual moral standards. 
In that respect, "Ravenous," an unusual piece of storytelling,
could be taken as an allegory about heavy drug users who
would steal, prostitute themselves, even kill to get their hands
on that nostrum without which live seems not worth living. 
The theme is a powerful one which, given the right treatment
on the big screen could mesmerize an audience.  But
"Ravenous," whose strangest notion is that it is directed by a
woman whose previous movie "Safe" offers little indication of
this current output, is oddly devoid of suspense.  Antonia
Bird, whose movie features only a single female, goes for the
gore instead.  </P>
<P>   A twist on the vampire legends, "Ravenous" is the story of
men who kill other men and eat their flesh in part to appease
their voracious appetites, in part because their diet makes
them feel stronger, healthier, better.  They are like vampires,
who each have the strength of ten men but who are not
limited by a need to remain indoors during bright, icy,
California days.  The tale takes place in the Sierra Nevada
mountain area of our most populous state in 1847, at the
time of the Mexican War--which added a large and wealthy
territory to the U.S.  The great Gold Rush would come in a
handful of years and Manifest Destiny was America's logo. 
As the most villainous character in the movie tells us, "This
country is stretching out its arms, consuming all it can." 
Colqhoun is the story's central scoundrel, of Scottish bent,
who takes that slogan personally.</P>
<P>   The film opens on Captain John Boyd (Guy Pearce),
considered a hero by some but exposed as a coward by his
commanding officer--who banishes him to a forsaken military
fort in an icy region of California.  He reports to Hart (Jeffrey
Jones), who commands a motley, dissolute bunch of sad
excuses for soldiers.  They include Toffler (Jeremy Davies),
the fort's religious leader; Knox (Stephen Spinella), who
"never met a bottle of whiskey he didn't like;" Reich (Neal
McDonough), a Nordic-looking zealot; and the drug-addicted
Cleaves (David Arquette).  Colqhoun (Robert Carlyle), a
shivering, starving Scot arrives looking for shelter, and
promptly rivets the ragtag bunch with a yarn about a group of
settlers who killed one another for food in order to survive a
treacherous snowstorm.  He guides the soldiers to a cave
that reveals a stack of mangy-looking skeletons, soon
revealing that it was he who killed the entire bunch to satisfy
his unusual gourmet tastes.  After additional, graphically
depicted bloodbath, a showdown develops between Colqhoun
and Captain John Byrd.  Byrd, who retains some semblance
of moral behavior, is faced with a choice that would send
most of us running to the psychiatrist's couch.</P>
<P>   The picture's leading attribute is Anthony B. Richmond's
dazzling photography, using the sparkling mountain scenery
of the Czech Republic and Slovakia which stand in for the
California of the mid-19th century.  In one extended and
particularly well-staged sequence, a character leaps from a
cliff like a championship bungee jumper and is photographed
in free fall down the rocky mountainside, his plummet broken
by a series of tree branches--all to Michael Nyman and
Damon Albarn's inviting soundtrack.   Parts of Ted Griffin's
screenplay provide a modicum of amusement--but not
fright--to the intended audience.  Much of the humor comes
from Hart's wit, which has dried up during his extended stay
at a barren, godforsaken outpost and delivered effectively by
the always amusing Jeffrey Jones.  "It's lonely being a
cannibal," he moans, "It's tough making friends."  Believe it or
not, there are references to Plato and Aristotle, with a quick
debate on whether Aristotle's highest good was happiness or
truth.</P>
<P>   Robert Carlyle, known to a more select audience for his
comic role as Gaz in the surprise hit "The Full Monty" and his
capacity as Glasgow bus driver George in "Carla's Song," has
mastered an American accent (despite his usual shtick
uitilizing in a barely decipherable Scottish dialect), though he
occasionally slides back to his native enunciation amusingly. 
Guy Pearce manages to keep a dour face, though we can
imagine his breaking into laughter frequently during
rehearsals of this sophomoric horror-comedy.  Jeffrey Jones
remains the comic centerpiece, reminding us at one moment
of Harvey Keitel's plea in "From Dusk Till Dawn," to kill him
when he turns into a vampire.  The big disappointment all
around is Antonia Bird, who has opted for playing it box-office
safe after affording us the pleasures of sophisticated
charmers like "Priest" and "Face."  Inspired by the box-office
success of "From Dusk Till Dawn," Bird has afforded us a
reasonably charming first half with good character
development and a fascinating image of a man's throwing up
when cutting a steak.  She spends the remaining time dishing
up the usual banalities of the carnage and general mayhem.</P>
