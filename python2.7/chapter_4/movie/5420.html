<P>     The mountains of North Carolina are the setting for this agreeable
period drama (1815) about a lonely, widowed farmer (Jason Patric) who
befriends a runaway slave (Thandie Newton) on his three-day trek back
from trading.  He's a quiet, gentle man who consents to conceal the girl
in his horse-drawn cart, along with the geese, pig, and cow that he's
carrying.  Her owner (a squinty Larry Drake) is also on the trail, as
are numerous other people, which makes the journey all the more
dangerous.  (And dangerously graphic!  Cover your eyes after a male
slave is captured.  The fate that befalls him involves one of the most
violent acts that I've seen in some time!) Rather engrossing for both
the excellent period detail and the breathtaking scenery, THE JOURNEY OF
AUGUST KING doesn't muster much in the way of dramatic weight.  Missing
is a sense of August King The Person.  We're shown what he *does*, but
not who he *is*.  Thus, whatever metaphorical "journey" he undergoes can
only be inferred.  And that's no good.  Nice use of the accompanying
animals, tho.  They are a small supporting cast unto themselves.  Filmed
entirely in North Carolina.</P>
