<P>In what circumstance would you deem someone lucky to have been involved in
the production of the critically panned GODZILLA (6/10)? When the
circumstance is such that you are the second unit director on said project,
and big-time movie director Roland Emmerich decides to take a chance on you
in his next producing gig, which ultimately turns into this movie.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A virtual reality program in which one could consciously transport oneself
into another universe is at the heart of this story that begins with the
murder of the man who invented the simulation itself. When one of his prime
employees is accused of the man's murder, he must go inside the machine
himself, in order to find out who really killed his boss and how he ended up
on the most wanted list.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
It is very appropriate that the famous quote of "I think, therefore I am"
precedes this film's credit run, since "thinking" is the primary exercise to
which this movie will have you subscribe. To a certain extent, it is quite
unfortunate that this "virtual-reality" film comes on the heels of other
similarly themed ones such as THE MATRIX (7.5/10), eXistenZ (7.5/10) and
DARK CITY (9/10), since we cannot help but compare it to the others, and
depreciate from its originality which is diluted due to its repetitive
ideas. Having said that, I still did enjoy most of this film which actually
starts off feeling more like a BACK TO THE FUTURE movie than anything else.
Its grainy, vintage look also appealed to me, as did the murder mystery that
absorbed its first half.</P>
<P>Unfortunately for its creators, the film does seem to lose ground during its
second half, when everyone and their grandma seems to be moving from one
parallel universe to the other (One dude walked out of our screening
mumbling something about "not knowing what was real anymore"). The only
scene that confused me was the final one which did not seem to make sense to
me according to the explanations that had preceded it before, but alas, I
might've missed something. The actors were all pretty good with Mol and
D'Onofrio pulling off fine dual roles, and newcomer Craig Bierko (new to
me!) punching in his best poor man's George Clooney imitation (Nice 'burns,
tough guy!). All in all, the movie had enough mood and mystery to spark my
initial interest, enough plot to keep it going in the midsection, but
ultimately too similar in story to many of the better films specified
earlier to register in my mind as anything more than a virtual-noir sci-fi
leftover plate. By the way, if it's action or special effects you're looking
for, this film is not for you! It contains neither of the two, but does play
many a mindgame with your head, if that's your vibe.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
This film is based on the book "Simulacron 3" written by Daniel Galouye.
Producer Ute Emmerich is director/producer Roland Emmerich's sister.
