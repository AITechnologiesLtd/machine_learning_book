<PRE>The Corruptor
Reviewed By Vince Yim</PRE>
<P>   Despite being proclaimed as one of the coolest actors in the world,
Chow Yun-Fat's first Hollywood picture, The Replacement Killers, failed
to have the desired impact. However, his latest, The Corruptor,
reassures Chow's coolness factor.</P>
<P>   The Corruptor tells the tale of two New York cops: the head of the
Asian gang unit, Nick Chen (played by Chow Yun-Fat) and Danny Wallace
(played by Mark Wahlberg), the young idealistic cop who's partnered up
with Chen amidst recent tensions between two gangs, the Triads and the
Fukienese Dragons. Both of Chen and Wallace have hidden agendas, as Chen
has ties to the Triads while Wallace is torn between his loyalties to
Chen and turning him in for corruption. </P>
<P>   Coming up with a good short plot summary for this film (at least
without giving away the story) is difficult, although that is one of the
charms of the film. While The Replacement Killers is a mindless
shoot-'em-up action film, The Corruptor has a complex storyline with
characters you actually care about, which gives the ending a lot more
impact (loyal fans of Chow Yun-Fat will know what I'm talking about).
While the film is not without its action sequences, they simply cannot
compare to the masterful bullet-ballets of Chow Yun-Fat's frequent Hong
Kong collaborator, John Woo.</P>
<P>   Not that they aren't memorable, though. The film has its share of
wonderfully violent shoot-outs and a nerve wracking car chase on a very
busy street. The end result is that a lot of stuff gets trashed and few
people get to walk away from the incident.  </P>
<P>   Chow's English has improved much since The Replacement Killers, which
is a good thing, especially since his dialogue consists of much more
than "I...need...forged...documents" and "I...need...guns." This is a
film that requires a bit of thought, albeit a bit much, as some of the
storyline tends to gets a bit muddled near the middle. Either that, or I
was just anticipating the next shoot-out too much.</P>
<P>   Simply put, The Corruptor is not a film that you can just turn your
brain off before you watch. The film is more than endless scenes of
bullets flying and bodies falling. Best described as an "intellectual
action film," it puts story and characters ahead of the action
sequences, while still including one of the coolest car chase scenes in
recent memory. As well, the two leads pull off very good performances,
especially when compared to their last films (although I really did like
The Big Hit, also starring Mark Wahlberg).</P>
<P>   While saying this film is better than The Replacement Killers isn't
saying much, the film can definitely stand on its own (even if I did
happen to like both of them). While not the best film starring Chow
Yun-Fat, it is definitely one of the better films around, which is
something sorely lacking in today's film market of mind numbing fare.</P>
