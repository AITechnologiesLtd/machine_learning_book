Three Kings</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Three kings and a joker (all US military) stumble across an "ass map" during
a cease-fire during the Gulf War. The map (which was found in an Iraqi
buttocks) could very well reveal the location of a great deal of gold. In an
attempt to return home rich, the four find themselves having to choose
between material or humanitarian wealth. It's a tough choice, so with death
on their heals they go for both.</P>
<P>Strangely resembling a journalistic version of "Saving Private Ryan," "Three
Kings" is really more like Tarantino in the Middle East. The grainy
overexposed footage goes a long way toward making you feel that this is
really happening. And the gruff point-blank bullets to the flesh make
blaring contrast to deadpan, stumbling humor. Oddly, it's not the humor that
takes you out of this "reality" the director carefully creates -- it's the
hyper-stylized cinematography especially present during an exchange of
gunfire. The camera stabs like a bayonet from the shooter to the target as
if to follow the bullet. A brave directorial option.</P>
<P>Thrown into the mix (none too subtlety) are sharp messages of politics and
humanitarianism. In one scene an American soldier who really believes he's
there to liberate Kuwait has oil forced down his throat in an attempt to
illustrate the truly "crude" reasons for his (the American) presence.</P>
<P>Though altruism prevails, the film is still a war comedy. And laughing at
such tragedy may be too much for some people to take (especially those who
have experienced combat first hand or their surviving loved ones).</P>
<P>Nonetheless, it's a strong, bold film with an incredible pace (which levels
off midway), outstandingly creative direction, rock solid acting (Wahlberg
is great), an aggressive (only slightly imperfect) script, and a fiercely
subtle sense of dark humor.</P>
