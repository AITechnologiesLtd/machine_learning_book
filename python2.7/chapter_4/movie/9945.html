<P>Released by 20th Century Fox. Directors Don Bluth & Gary Goldman.
Producers Bluth & Goldman.</P>
<P>Fox takes the plunge into mainstream animation feature films with the
utterly conventional "Anastasia." Few things really stand out about
this movie but at the same time, there is nothing noticeably bad about
it either. It's a pleasing, and successful, one and a half hour sortie
at Disney's megalomaniacal animation division that spells stiff
competition in the future.</P>
<P>The base of the story is taken from the historic Romanov family from
Czarist Russia. A rather unlikely source for an animated feature, Don
Bluth and Gary Goldman (both who have extensive Disney experience)
and their team of writers manage to put together an enjoyable, albeit
routine story that should do well to appeal to young and old.</P>
<P>The year was 1916 and Anastasia's (voice by the always likable Meg
Ryan) family, the Romanovs, was celebrating its 300th anniversary as
the ruling dynasty in Russia. Her grandmother, the Dowager Empress
Marie, returning to her home in Paris, gives Anastasia a beautiful
music box that played their special lullaby. The Empress, resembling
Angela Lansbury after taking classes in royalty (incidentally, played
by Angela Lansbury) had a special inscription placed on the key to the
music box - "Together in Paris." Someone should have warned them that
the evil Rasputin had returned from exile to St. Petersburg seeking
revenge. Sporting a beard that would make ZZ Top jealous, escorted by
spunky sidekick Bartok the albino bat, ultimately consumed by hatred,
he sold his soul for a dangerous power to curse the family. From that
moment on, revolution begins to rage across the country, ultimately
destroying most of the Romanov family. </P>
<P>With the aid of a courageous kitchen boy named Dmitri, the Empress and
her granddaughter make their perilous escape from the horde which is
attacking the Romanov palace. Pursued by the fervent Rasputin, Marie
and Anastasia's only hope is to catch the last train from the crumbling
capital. </P>
<P>Rasputin tries to catch and kill the two, but he falls into an icy
death, pardoning the lives of Marie and Anastasia. But as they struggle
to escape the mob that has become St. Petersburg, Marie and Anastasia
are separated when the princess falls from her grandmother's grasp and
hits her head. As the distraught Marie heads toward Paris and safety,
Anastasia lies unconscious, alone and an amnesiac.</P>
<P>Along the way, she comes across a grown-up Dmitri and his friend/
business partner Vladimir. These genial rogues have a get-rich-quick
scheme, that scheme being to get an actress to play the lost princess
Anastasia and then collecting the reward of ten million rubles from the
Empress. Lucky for them, Anya just happens to be the lost princess.
Unlucky for them, she does not even know it despite the telltale
pictures of the royal family in the now abandoned palace.</P>
<P>History purists and devout Russian nationalists will be obviously
perturbed by the watered-down storyline   but the Bluth/Goldman script
works for what is supposed to be, an animation feature geared towards
the young and the young-at-heart.</P>
<P>Fox shamelessly plagiarized the successful formula that earned Disney
so many millions, from the rags-to-riches heroine, the handsome suitor
that crosses her path, to the all too cute sidekicks that no animated
feature can do without. They're almost as successful. "Anastasia,"
though having a plot that is relentlessly conventional, yet serviceable
is saved by the shrewd casting for the voices of the main characters.
Ryan is perfect as the perky yet strong-willed princess, and John
Cusak's voice suits the charm of Dmitri quite well. Christopher Lloyd
is gleefully evil in his ranting and raving. However, Hank Azaria
steels some spotlight as Bartok the ambiguous-conscienced bat. Cliched
lines like "stressed is a killer sir" would not work had it not been
for his lively, if indecipherable, accent.</P>
<P>Ryan and Cusack work well off each other, with a lively banter that
hints at the inevitable romantic tension between the two. Ryan devotees
will recognize the style of that dialogue that made her so likable (and
famous) and "When Harry Met Sally" so enjoyable.</P>
<P>The Disney influence shows plainly in some of the shots of the interior
of the palace ballroom, as does the relationship between Empress Marie
and the grown-up Anastasia. When Anya dresses up for the final ballroom
event, one cannot help but have "Beauty and the Beast" running through
their heads at the moment. Right down to Lansbury's voice to that
elegant yellow dress.</P>
<P>The computer generated animation is near flawless, just slightly less
polished than Disney's best works. The sweeping "cinematography"
covering the ballrooms is especially impressive however; the illusion
of camera movement, or panning, being smooth and realistic.</P>
<P>"Anastasia" will no doubt be the first of many features Fox will throw
into the already saturated movie market, and if the following films get
better as Fox gains experience they will have a bright future indeed.
As it is, this is a pleasing, enjoyable and sometimes too cute movie
that hits its target almost on the mark.</P>
