I now include a section where YOU the surfer can recommend movies to
ME and other netheads. Have a freakin' good time.)</P>
<P>starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Gabriel
Byrne, Gerard Depardieu
based on the novel by Alexandre Dumas
written and directed by Randall Wallace</P>
<P>DiCaprio is a wonderful screen presence, possessed of an androgynous
beauty; he would have been at home in a silent film, for his cat's
eyes telegraph everything he's feeling. He's also very much a product
of the nineties: the only reason he worked in Titanic is because Jack
Dawson was a man out of his element, a bad boy hipster on a ship full
of snobs. Put frilly clothes on Leo and ask him to portray a historic
Frenchman, and said eyes suddenly convey confusion. He is an actor out
of his element as Rimbaud in Total Eclipse and, now, as King Louis XIV
in The Man In The Iron Mask.</P>
<P>The film begins with heinous King Louis ordering the slaughter of
Jesuit traitors to D'Artangan (Byrne), his loyal Captain of the Royal
Guard. Then Louis falls in lust with the engaged Christine, and orders
the slaughter of her fiancee. This leads Athos (Malkovich), the father
of the dead fiancee, on a rampage. He reteams with ex-Musketeers
Aramis (Irons) and Porthos (Depardieu), and they concoct a revenge
plan: the release of Phillipe, Louis's secret identical twin, who has
been kept for years in a dungeon, his face shielded by an iron mask. A
switcheroo is performed, with harrowing results.</P>
<P>DiCaprio is not the only weak link in the chain. Malkovich's
performance feels phoned-in, Judith Godreche as Christine is
unremarkable, and the remaining members of the cast are forced to
repeat "All for one and one for all" ad nauseum. Randall Wallace's
adaptation is problematic: the dialogue lacks flavour, wit,
intelligence, and period nuances. As a debut director, he brings
nothing unique to the table cinematically; picture a high school play
enacted on Masterpiece Theater. There are a handful of decent moments,
and Depardieu stands out as the womanizing, suicidal Porthos. He's
also the only male Francophone to be found in a story that takes place
entirely in France.</P>
<P>It's a shame DiCaprio had to follow up the biggest film in history
with The Man In The Iron Mask. Perhaps working with this stellar cast
convinced him it might work. The film, despite being miles ahead in
quality of Disney's recent Musketeers picture (Charlie Sheen, we
hardly knew you were gone), is simply not the grand, powerful epic it
wants to be.  Diverting, yes, but I think the next time I crave The
Three Musketeers, I'll stick with the chocolate bar.</P>
