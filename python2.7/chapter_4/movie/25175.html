<P>Ken Russell's "Gothic" is one of the crudest, most excessively
overwrought, unimaginably worst films ever made - a travesty of the
memory of Percy Shelley, Mary Shelley, Lord Byron and anyone else
involved in that hallucinatory evening back in the summer of the early
1800's. Yes, the film purports to be about that evening but I am sure
it was a lot classier and civilized than Russell's version of it.</P>
<P>Not to say that it was not a sexual, druggy romp for all involved, as
I am sure it was, but this often looks like wild outtakes from
"Woodstock" crossed with "Caligula." Natasha Richardson is the
tranquil Mary Shelley, Julian Sands is the laudanum addict Percy
Shelley, and Gabriel Byrne is the laughably miscast, brutish, devilish
Lord Byron, in exile at the Villa Diodati where all the hanky-panky
takes place. Also on hand is the highly loony Dr. Polidori (Timothy
Spall) and Mary's stepsister (Miriam Cyr), who all indulge in
debauchery (free love as Percy calls it), and hallucinatory fever
dreams where reality and fiction sort of cross over. There are snakes
(a typical Russell visual), corpses, stillborn babies, hands
puncturing nails, abortions and lots of sex. The question is that in
all of Russell's mishmash of fiery, bloody images, when did Mary
creatively think of her idea for "Frankenstein" or Polidori think of
his "Vampyre" story? The film only shows the hallucinations b!  ut
precious little time is invested in any of the characters. They are
vapid, one-dimensional cartoons in Russell's universe, and the fact
that these literate minds read horror stories to each other during a
brutal thunderstorm is only barely hinted at. It's all fire and
brimstone played to the hilt, and likely to bore anyone to tears who
is not interested in a Heavy Metal music video with Thomas Dolby's
overused electronic score groping for our attention.</P>
<P>"Gothic" has the stylish look of a rock video but none of the
atmosphere or subtlety of a Universal horror flick. It sputters, spits
itself out in stylistic strokes and tries to thrill us with
nightmarish overkill, but it ultimately fails to enlighten. I admired
some of Russell's other visionary trips but "Gothic" is strictly
subterranean junk.</P>
