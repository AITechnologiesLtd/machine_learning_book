Review: SLIDING DOORS [1998]
[Miramax/Paramount]</PRE>
<PRE>Cast:         Gwyneth Paltrow as Helen Quilley
        John Hannah as James
        John Lynch as Gerry
        Jeanne Tripplehorn as Lydia
Written and Directed by:         Peter Howitt</PRE>
<PRE>Review by:        Joy Wyse</PRE>
<P>The day starts off as usual for Helen Quilley, the sole female in a London
Public Relations firm, but the morning meeting suddenly  leaves her
jobless and on her way home.  Unknown to Helen, her live-in lover, Gerry,
is having a  meeting of his own with Lydia, a former girlfriend who has
come back into his life.  </P>
<P>The SLIDING DOORS of the underground train shut before Helen can board. 
Then, the film goes into reverse causing Helen to walk backwards up the
stairs.  Switch to forward and this time, she manages to squeeze through
the SLIDING DOORS before they close, enabling her to arrive home earlier
than expected.</P>
<P>>From this point on there are two story lines that show how her life could
unfold.  To enable the viewer to keep them straight there are obvious
differences such as a bandage, or a different hair color.   In one
scenario Helen discovers Gerry in bed with Lydia.  In the other, she only
has suspicions that Gerry is having an affair.  </P>
<P>While Gerry, Lydia, and their friends remain more or less the same in both
plots, it is Helen herself who displays the greatest differences.  One
Helen becomes a self-sufficient, semi-successful business woman while the
other Helen becomes an object of our pity.  It is a wonderful acting job
by  Miss Paltrow, probably her best to date.</P>
<P>Although Gerry tries to get up nerve to tell Lydia that he wants nothing
more to do with her, he can't bring himself to end the relationship. 
Enter James, a charming, Monty Python quoting suitor who meets Helen and
begins to pursue her.  </P>
<P>The movie is so well written that you find yourself changing back and
forth.  Sometimes you're wanting her to be with James.  Other times you
want her to make up with Gerry.  There are many character traits that you
like and dislike about each Helen from self-sacrifice to self-confidence.</P>
<P>It is definitely a screenplay that makes you think.  What if?  In my case
it particularly hit home.  As luck would have it, I was in London less
than a month ago.  I entered the Underground at the same station, rode the
same moving sidewalk, and boarded a train that looked exactly like the
train that Helen boarded.  I couldn't help but ask myself....  What if?</P>
<PRE>SLIDING  DOORS is well worth seeing.   I want to see it again, soon.  I
keep thinking about it.    I give it a B+.</PRE>
<PRE>SEE YOU AT THE MOVIES!</PRE>
