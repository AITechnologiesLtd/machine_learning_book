<P>Adapted from Jacquelyn Mitchard's best-seller - which had the
distinction of being the first novel honored as an Oprah Winfrey book
club selection - "The Deep End of the Ocean" is a flawed but often
effective family drama that turns on the deepest fear of every parent
or guardian: that one dumb move, a single moment of neglect that can
turn the rest of your life inside out.</P>
<P>Though she somehow keeps things together, forgetful and disorganized
Beth Cappadora (Michelle Pfeiffer) is no model mom. But neither does
she deserve what happens to her after she makes the foolish decision
to take her three kids to her high school reunion in Chicago.  Shortly
after the family arrives in town, Beth's 3-year-old son Ben
disappears, sparking a frantic search that culminates with Beth
standing outside a detectives' office, listening to cops speculating
about whether or not Ben is still alive.</P>
<P>Predictably, the effect of this on Beth, her husband Pat (Treat
Williams) and the Cappadora's 7-year-old son Vincent (Cory Buck) is
cataclysmic, and director Ulu Grosbard manages to make this section of
the story both taut and heartwrenching. In one of the movie's sharpest
scenes, Vincent uses his baby sister Kerry to curtail a bitter fight
between Beth and Pat, who accuses his wife ofhaving "made a career out
of being unhappy."</P>
<P>At this point, "Ocean" jumps ahead nine years to show us the aftermath
of the tragedy on the household; the Cappadoras have survived, but
everyone's a little worse for the wear. Then everything changes again,
thanks to a near-miraculous discovery, the kind of twist of fate that
tends to happen more often in literature than in real life.</P>
<P>But if the plot goes off the deep end, even throwing in a caring
detective (Whoopi Goldberg) who becomes Beth's best friend, the
movie's emotional core is solid and the understated performances - a
Grosbard trademark - ensure that "Ocean" gets the tearducts working
overtime.  Pfeiffer, Buck and Jonathan Jackson (who plays Vincent at
age 16) are particularly good at getting across their characters'
emotional states without grandstanding.</P>
<P>Credit screenwriter Stephen Schiff (who did the similarly subtle
recent adaptation of "Lolita") with keeping what could have been a
soapy free-for-all under control. Once it has exhausted its surprises,
"Ocean" calms down to become a thoughtful, observant study of
self-persecution and the power of forgiveness.</P>
