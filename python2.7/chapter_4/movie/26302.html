<P>Ah, the joy of the newsgroup.  These psuedo-anonymous message boards can be
home to freaks, weirdos, and just about anyone else that would like to walk
in the door and put their opinion on the ground… myself included.  They also
can be home to the flame war, a particular brand of argument with well
thought-out yet often incoherent point-counterpoint arguments that more
often than not sound like the ravings of a truculent drunk (go ahead, flame
me for that comment, see if I care).  Of course, I'm not exempt from this.
My profession as a critic makes me the prime target of many a flame war,
such as one going on at present at alt.movies discussing the fate of the
cinema, and whether the entire form has gone to crap.</P>
<P>The key argument in this has been that younger individuals are incapable of
writing a screenplay: a point I vehemently disagree with, yet my antagonist
has missed a prime example: Billy Madison, Adam Sandler's attempt at getting
out all of those demons of k through 12 school (God knows what will happen
when he gets out those collegiate demons… a former classmate of Sandler's
described him as `the kid who thought he was really funny that just annoyed
everyone.').  After all, with a concept as unimaginative as a man going back
through all of his grades so he can inherit a company, how far can your
really go?</P>
<P>The movie reeks of desperation.  Nonsensical musical numbers, imaginary
penguins, and cheap sex jokes… they're all here.  No one will escape the
wrath of Adam in his quest for laughter and a better tomorrow.</P>
<P>In case you really wonder about the plot, Adam Sandler is Billy Madison,
loony toon son of a millionaire who stands to inherit a hotel chain if only
he'll stop acting like a moron.  But instead of placing Billy around mature
individuals to accomplish this, his father sends him back through every
grade, giving two weeks for each one.  Billy goes to school, falls for his
3rd grade teacher, and sings crazy selfmotivational music numbers as he
attempts to pat himself on the back so he can make it through high school.</P>
<P>Adam Sandler, please learn that many (extending the `I' here) don't like
your catharsis, and you should keep the moral message in check and just
deliver an idiotic comedy.  As an idiotic comedy, Billy Madison almost
works – after all, Sandler is immature enough to nail the part – but the
film also has misguided attempts to insert such goody-goody messages as
`love thy [insert unloved party here]' that just interrupt what would have
been enjoyment.  The result: a dumb comedy that I can only stand if I'm
watching it out of the corner of my eye and paying attention only during
certain scenes.</P>
<P>This, needless to say, is not great filmmaking.</P>
<P>Oh well.  Like The Blob, there is no escape from the Adam Sandler film.
They have become cultural icons, films that are regularly broadcasted when
they should have been boycotted.  But now I have been there, I have done
that, and I would love it if Adam Sandler would just leave us alone.</P>
