<P>   They say that Sir Winston Churchill and his wife Sarah slept
in separate bedrooms, which would make any modern person
assume that they were unhappy together.  This could be true,
but the Robert Altmanesque "The Anniversary Party," written,
directed and acted by Alan Cumming and Jennifer Jason
Leigh, might give you pause.  The premise of the movie, I
think, is that loving another person is easier than being
together with that individual.  Yes.  Love is difficult to find but
living together is even more demanding.  Look at the
marriage rate in the U.S. and then examine the divorce rate. 
Despite the alleged unpopularity of matrimony, I believe about
90% of Americans get married at some time in their lives. 
Fifty percent of them, however, get divorced.  The other fifty
percent?  Miserable, maybe.  If my thinking about "The
Anniversary Party" is correct, the way to get those divorce
figures down is either to outlaw marriage (which would bring
the divorce rate down to 0) or continue performing the
services but have the couples live apart.  What's wrong with
banning marriage altogether if so many people are miserable? 
Probably that being single is worse.  How does "The
Anniversary Party" support my premise?  Look at what's going
down in this picture, which is sometimes emotionally
wrenching, at other times challenging the viewer to think that
these incredibly rich people should just shut up and enjoy
their money.</P>
<P>   The principal couple, the ones holding a party for their sixth
anniversary, are Joe Thierrian (Alan Cumming) and Sally
Therrian (Jennifer Jason Leigh).  Joe made his money as a
novelist and is about to direct a picture based on his latest
piece of fiction.  Sally is an accomplished actress but despite
her good looks and athletic build is beginning to get long in
the tooth, at least from the standpoint of what the movie
audience demands of leading women.  They had broken up
five months before. Now they're together and have invited
some friends, business associates, and neighbors to their
Hollywood Hills home (architecturally designed virtually to
erase the border between the interiors and the exteriors) to
show all that they are really together this time around.</P>
<P>   In like manner, the people who are invited to the house
have erased the borders between their acting roles and their
real selves because they are the actual friends of Cumming
and Leigh.  They are an ensemble of some of the big names
in Hollywood today.   Most striking in appearance is Gwyneth
Paltrow as Skye Davidson, a woman in her early twenties
who is being paid 4 million to act the role of the lead
character who seems--at least to Sally--to be based quite
closely on her and on her marriage.  Sally is furious that her
husband even invited the young star to the celebration, and
Skye doesn't make things any better by telling Sally, "I've
been watching you since I was 4 years old.  I'm so thrilled to
be playing you as a young woman."  That Skye assures her
that she was always a big fan of hers does not assuage the
wound.</P>
<P>   The film, which should remind viewers of Lawrence
Kasdan's 1983 pic "The Big Chill"--a look at a group of former
college-radical friends who have dropped back into society--is
even more unstructured and devoid of anything resembling a
tight narrative.  While the slack might well turn off those who
insist that the story's always the thing, the ensemble acting of
this talented bunch and to an even great extent the chemistry
among them which signals that these folks have known each
other for a while makes "The Anniversary Party" an engaging,
bitterly-humorous bit of eavesdropping into this long day's
journey into night.  While it's a stretch to think that real people
can go through such drama at a single party, the credibility
and the bon mots make watching this quite an enjoyable
experience.  Acting to type, Jane Adams out Parkers Parker
Posey (who is also a guest though a toned-down one) as the
group's most overt neurotic, gesturing wildly as she holds
tightly to a cell phone with which she expects to hear from her
baby sitter a few times each hour.  The unborn come in for a
drubbing as Sophia Gold (Phoebe Cates) reports "once you
have children, you can't commit suicide since kids rob you of
that option."  </P>
<P>   Others who take turns entertaining the guests at the party
while entertaining us in the audience with their pithy sayings
and emotional outbursts include Kevin Kline as Sophia's wife
Cal, while John Benjamin Hickey is the guy a lot of us can
relate to--an outsider, invited only because he's a neighbor,
though his invite comes only as a way to stop him from suing
over Joe and Sally's perpetually barking dog Otis.</P>
<P>   What seems to be dividing critics so far is the use of digital
video, which is not only cheaper but can give more of a
cinema-verite look to the proceedings.  To cite distinguished
online critic Steve Rhodes of Internet Reviews, "John Bailey
demonstrates that digital video can indeed look sharp,
sumptuous and generally steady," while equally distinguished
online critic Chuck Rudolph of Matinee Magazine disagrees:
"Digital Video can only debase a movie to make it look like
the barren home videos of birthday parties and weddings." 
My view?  Looks fine to me, but at any rate I was more than
sufficiently absorbed by the spiked dialogue of these poor little
rich folks to worry about the sharpness of the photography.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running time: 115 minutes.  (C)2001,
