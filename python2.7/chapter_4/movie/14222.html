<P>Susan Granger's review of "YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS" (Gramercy Pictures)</P>
<P>        Neil LaBute's caustic, dark comedy about sexual politics is a
follow-up to "In the Company of Men" and similar in its edgy,
tough-talking bitterness and emphasis on emotional isolation. Rather
than the singles scene, this time he attacks marital relations,
focusing - like a voyeur - on two upper middle-class couples. Ben
Stiller plays an analytical, pretentious college drama professor with
the disturbing habit of talking continually during sex. Catherine
Keener is his cynical, live-in girl-friend.  "Love," she says
succinctly, "is a disease." His buddy, Aaron Eckhart, suffers from
sexual dysfunction, leaving Amy Brenneman, as his gentle, dissatisfied
wife, with perpetual tears in her eyes. The guys work out at the gym
with Jason Patric, a calculating misogynist who enjoys humiliating the
women in his life and tape-recording raunchy sexual banter while he's
exercising. And Nastassja Kinski meets the other five characters in
her job as an assistant in an gallery; clearly, she's desperate for a
significant relationship wherever she can find it. Basically, this is
a nasty, sexually explicit social commentary about selfish,
egocentric, abrasive losers who love to verbalize about the awful
choices they make that wreck their lives. The steam-room scene in
which the men brag about the best sex they ever had is one of the most
appalling I've seen on the screen. Obviously, what Neil LaBute is
trying to communicate is that these hateful on-screen people are not
larger-than-life; instead, they're similar to the excruciatingly
vulnerable people we all meet every day, at home and at work. On the
Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Your Friends and Neighbors" is a
slow-moving, often disturbing, bleak 5. Hey, if these folks were real,
I'd be outta the neighborhood.</P>
