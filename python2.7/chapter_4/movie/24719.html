<P>I walked into THE BIG KAHUNA not quite knowing what to expect--and came 
out realizing I had just watched 91 minutes filled with three guys 
jawjackin' about Life, The Universe, And Everything.</P>
<P>Bless its character-driven little heart.</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
The three primaries in THE BIG KAHUNA are industrial lubricant salesmen 
who've reached different stages of their lives: Bob Walker (Peter 
Facinelli) is still young and wet-behind-the-ears; as clean-cut as they 
come, Bob is an unabashed Christian who takes his faith and how it 
defines him, seriously--maybe a bit *too* seriously--to the point where 
it seems more a crutch than an aide.  Larry Mann (Kevin Spacey), a 
fast-talking, cynical, take-no-prisoners sort, immediately challenges 
everything that Bob holds dear.  And Phil Cooper (Danny DeVito) is weary 
of it all; having gone through a nasty divorce, and feeling useless, 
Phil is used to Larry's caustic nature, and has seen plenty of Bob-types 
before--but he has reached the point in his life where nothing surprises 
him anymore, and he wouldn't care even if it did. </P>
<P>While the men are waiting for an important client--a big kahuna--to 
visit them in a run-down hospitality suite in a run-down hotel deep in 
the heart of Wichita, the three discover things about themselves and 
each other that they never realized existed before.</P>
<P>The Upshot:
You must know, straight off, three things about "Kahuna": first, it 
takes place almost entirely in the smallish suite that becomes the bane 
of Larry's existence in the time that he's there; second, what little 
plot there is revolves around the three men's search for Richard Fuller, 
the kahuna in question; and third, the movie is based on a play 
(HOSPITALITY SUITE) - and looks every bit like one.  If you cannot get 
with that, then it's best to exit, stage right.  As for me, in the 
waning days of one of the worst five months of movie releases in recent 
history, and on the cusp of summer's Big! Movie! Events!, a film like 
THE BIG KAHUNA - all talk, little plot, much character development - is 
just what the doctor ordered.    </P>
<P>Obvious comparisons to GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS will be made, especially 
because Spacey was in both.  And while "Glengarry" was in many ways a 
superior film, "Kahuna" has its charms as well; not the least of which 
is the fact that because of its smaller cast, we get to "know" these 
characters a wee bit more, especially the Phil character.  Rumor has it 
that Kevin Spacey, one of the producers of THE BIG KAHUNA, talked Danny 
DeVito into co-starring in the movie under somewhat shady pretenses.  
After seeing DeVito's performance, I can say that the ends very much 
justified the means; shady pretenses or not, DeVito most def steals this 
particular show.</P>
<P>It's been a long time since I've seen DeVito so convincing in a role; 
known primarily as a comic actor (in flicks like ROMANCING THE STONE, 
WAR OF THE ROSES, and his TAXI TV series), not since his turn in L.A. 
CONFIDENTIAL has he impressed me as much as he did in "Kahuna".  Hard as 
it is for me to believe, DeVito outdid even Kevin Spacey, easily one of 
my favorite modern-day actors.  But don't be fooled; as Larry, Spacey 
was no slouch.  It is to his credit that Spacey didn't play Larry like 
part two of his "Glengarry" character, or rest on the laurels of his 
Oscar win in last year's AMERICAN BEAUTY.  A lesser actor might have 
done just that.  Between Larry's  snarkasm  and Phil's 
I-don't-give-a-damn (but, really, I'd *like* to) attitude, "Kahuna" did 
a fine job of showing, in an exaggerated sense, the desperate measures 
taken by men who feel themselves defined as what they do rather than who 
they are--even if those measures are taken only in words.</P>
<P>Of the three men, the least interesting to me was Bob; Peter Facinelli 
was workable in the role, and definitely looked the All-American Boy 
part, but I like my characters with some fat on their cheeks and some 
world-weariness in their bones, thankyewverramuch.  Which is, of course, 
The Point behind Bob's fascination with Phil; impressed by Phil's 
integrity of character (and, conversely, turned off by Larry's seeming 
lack of same), Bob sets out to create character lines in his own face as 
a reflection of what he sees in Phil.  And of course, it ain't that 
easy.  Hmmm...perhaps Bob was somewhat more interesting to me than I 
gave him credit for being.</P>
<P>To be sure, THE BIG KAHUNA had its faults.  Seemingly running without 
focus for much of the first half, the viewer was left to wonder whether 
they were ever going to get to The Point before the end credits rolled.  
And during the first half of the first half, the emphasis seemed to be 
put on one-liners and cute schticks, especially from Larry/Spacey.  But 
once Spacey's and especially DeVito's burners kicked in, "Kahuna" took 
off running, and brought audience members willing to make the effort to 
work with it, along for the ride.  Humorous and intense--especially in 
the final bits--"Kahuna" is a refreshing, though challenging, change of 
pace from the typical summer Hollywood movie.</P>
<P>[Though I do have to wonder whether the guy in my audience that damn 
near busted a gut throughout, was a shill.  Uh, doode, it wasn't that 
funny.  Well, except for that "spoken word" song in the end credits, 
"Everybody's Free [To Wear Sunscreen]".  Now *that* was worth a laugh or 
two].</P>
<P>I have to chuckle at the timeliness of this movie for me; in a few days, 
I'll be headed off to a computer-buyers convention, and very likely will 
be "wined and dined" by Phil, and Larry--and Bob--types, hoping to lube 
me up, so to speak, for my business.  So does that make me a big kahuna?  
Lord, I hope not.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
No, this "talkie" is not for everyone; but it worked for me. I loved THE 
BIG KAHUNA, for all the same reasons I loved its cousin-in-type, 
GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS.  The real surprise for me was, I liked Danny DeVito 
in it even more than Kevin Spacey.  </P>
<P>THE BIG KAHUNA (rating: greenlight): 
Easily one of the better of the "I could watch [insert kickbutt actor's 
name here] read the telephone book" group of films.</P>
