<PRE>                                     EVITA
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1997 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Now I understand why Argentineans wanted Madonna to go home during
the filming of EVITA!</P>
<P>     What the fuss is all about, I have no idea, because EVITA is just
another bad movie starring one of our worst actresses, Madonna.  The
catch is, this time she gets to sing sing sing for 2 1/2 hours -- sing
until she can sing no more -- sing until your ears bleed.</P>
<P>     EVITA has had a long and sordid past as a motion picture project,
and it's easy to see why.  The fact that EVITA makes a mockery of
Argentina's most beloved personage *and* the filmmakers wanted to shoot
there is almost beside the point.  There's the problem that movie
musicals have tended to be huge flops over the last 40 years; the
problem of Madonna's inability to act; the problem that Eva Peron was
basically an egomaniac that died 40 years ago and that no one in America
really cares about anymore.  And when co-screenwriter Oliver Stone gets
involved... yikes!  They might as well have made a musical called
OSWALD!</P>
<P>     But they didn't.  Instead, EVITA rumbles through the plot points in
Eva Peron's life like a freight train.  From stargazing child to slutty
gold-digger to talentless actress to the wife of the President, it's no
wonder why Madonna fought so hard for this part -- it's straight out of
her life (except for the President part... so far)!  No acting
required!  *And* she gets to sing the whole time!</P>
<P>     And what's with all this singing, anyway?  Yes, I know it's from
Andrew Lloyd Webber (who, after seeing "Cats," I believe is seriously
disturbed), and as a traditional musical, EVITA might have had a
prayer.  But electric guitars and synthesizers?  Discordant,
headache-inducing chants?  A capella, sing-song dialogue between
characters?  Sheesh, EVITA is more like THE WHO'S TOMMY than SINGIN' IN
THE RAIN.  (It's no surprise that director Alan Parker also created PINK
FLOYD'S THE WALL.)  I half-expected Madonna to start rolling around in
baked beans a la Ann-Margret!</P>
<P>     No such luck.  Instead we have to listen to the likes of Antonio
Banderas's singing narrator, which sounds a lot like he has his cajones
in a vise.  Or the very British Jonathan Pryce as Juan Peron (!),
singing about how he ran the British out of Argentina.  The hilarity of
these two performing is *almost* as much fun as the real treat of
EVITA:  trying to see how many ways Madonna can cover up her blossoming
pregnancy.  How many arms, hats, and flower bouquets can she hold across
her waist?  A lot.</P>
<P>     In all fairness, Banderas is a diamond in the rough here, in a part
of comic relief that is desperately needed among the Very Serious
performances.  Also, a few of the songs are tolerable, even memorable,
even if they rarely make sense.  But, in the end, I have to pan EVITA,
if for no other reason than it's just plain goofy.  And some parting
words for Madonna, in a lyrical fashion she may be able to finally
understand:</P>
<PRE>     I saw your movie/
     Now keep your distance.</PRE>
