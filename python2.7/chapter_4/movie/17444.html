<P>I have little against remakes and updates of older films and tv series. If
there's a will, there's a way; and I believe that anything, no matter how
great or revered can be effectively improved upon. This is the reason that I
responded so well to Gus Van Sant's universally panned update of Psycho; I
thought it to be not only an intriguing cinematic experience, but also very
on-par with an original. But I do have a big problem with remakes that are
blatantly bad. You see, the point of a remake is, or at least it should be,
to iron out the original's flaws and bring the work that much closer to
greatness or even perfection. But what if the source material on which the
remake is based isn't any good to begin with?
That is the only cinematic question pondered by the bland actioner The Mod
Squad. I've only seen a couple episodes of the late 60s tv series on which
it is based, and to be honest, I didn't like it all that much. It has a
concept that -- and still is -- interesting; a group of corrupt young
adults, all in their early 20s are given a choice: they either go to jail
for the various crimes that they all have committed, or they can become
undercover cops, helping the police get into places that they normally
wouldn't be able to access. Obviously, all 3 opt for the latter option and
become undercover policemen (and policewomen).</P>
<P>The three main characters here are played by Claire Danes, Omar Epps and
Giovanni Ribisi. Of the three, only Danes has a real character. Ribisi's
dumbass 20 year old is played exclusively for laughs; Epps' slightly more
intelligent one is used to create various chase scenes. When the squad's
superviser gets killed off and his reputation dirtied in death, the three of
them, sure that their beloved master was framed, go off and investigate on
their own, discovering corrupt cops, lots and lots of expensive whores and
very lucrative drug operations. All kinds of good stuff!</P>
<P>The only times that The Mod Squad comes even close to working is in its
comedic moments. Although Ribisi is a trite actor and his characters repeat
movie after movie, his man here is really rather amusing, when the script
gives him a chance. Epps' straight man is effectively played against
Ribisi's clueless spontaneity. But the rest of the film is dull, boring and
singularly uninteresting. A drug-op action plot is no longer anything new,
not even with teenage action heroes, and the way it's executed here, it's
also nowhere near exciting or suspenseful.</P>
<P>Claire Danes' character has potential, but it is buried under heaps of
cliches and her performance is too restrained. She could have been a
tour-de-force, but instead director Scott Silver puts shackles on her and
simply does not allow her to do anything really significant with her role.
Epps and Ribisi fare slightly better and do as well as can be expected,
although their characters aren't nearly as rich as Danes' could have been.</P>
<P>The Mod Squad is a mind-numbing marketing plot of a film, and teens will
jump all over it. It's full of bad dialogue, scenes and concepts that make
no sense and -- get this -- drug dealers that like to tango with other guys
in their spare time. Nothing is remotely intriguing or worth paying for.
Claire Danes is no longer alluring -- mainly because she's got a horrible
hairdo, so that draw is out. There are, however, cool explosions, guns and
chases which may lure a viewer into thinking that he or she is about to
experience an exciting thriller of some sort. Do not be fooled. Some may
call this escapist fare -- I call it escape-as-quickly-as-you-can fare.</P>
