                       A film review by Andrew Hicks

<PRE>(1997) **1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        The movie hitman always exhibits several common traits. 
Like the Schwarzeneggerian action hero, he is a calm, collected killer 
who manages to crack one-liners about that most morbid of topics: 
death. And he seems to get away with -- if you'll excuse the expression 
-- murder, without anyone ever realizing that, when he says he's a 
professional killer, he's not kidding. The hitman this time is played by 
John Cusack and the main difference between this and other hitman 
films is that GROSSE POINT BLANK is a high-minded satire centered 
around Cusack's visit to his 10-year high school reunion.</P>
<P>        Cusack has disappeared from the town in which he grew up, 
leaving everyone to wonder what's become of him, especially his bitter 
ex-girlfriend (Minnie Driver). He stood her up for prom and she 
hasn't seen him since. Now all she has to her name is a low-rent radio 
show on 79.5, a frequency which doesn't even exist on radio receivers. 
When Cusack shows up after all that time away, Driver can't talk to 
him in private. She puts him on the air instead, more interested in 
entertaining the listeners than working out her personal problems with 
Cusack. It serves as a buffer between her public and private lives. See, 
I know the psychology of entertainment -- I _live_ the psychology of 
entertainment.</P>
<P>        Cusack, like Romy and Michelle, doesn't want to go to his 
high school reunion, but his secretary forces him to go. The secretary, 
played by Cusack's sister Joan (in her perpetual comic supporting 
roles), is one of the enjoyable characters that lend GROSSE POINT 
BLANK its comic charm. Another is Dan Aykroyd, who is in his first 
decent movie since MY GIRL, and even that one is debatable to most 
film buffs. He plays the villain of the film, a rival hitman who wants 
Cusack to join his union of professional killers. They've gone without 
benefits for too long. So has Aykroyd, actually.</P>
<P>        Cusack finally agrees to head for his reunion because he'll be 
in the area for a job anyway. So he stops in and has a few bizarre 
scenes with Driver before those two become hot and heavy again. He 
also meets a few old friends, including another of the great comic 
supporters, Jeremy Piven. All the while, a few mysterious men are 
following Cusack for reasons that become clear later. This subplot 
takes away from the comedic intelligence in favor of the traditional 
gunfight ending.</P>
<P>        The main trip-up of GROSSE POINT BLANK is that, despite 
its great cast and interesting premise, it has too much convention. The 
Cusack-Driver romance is predictable, and so is the Cusack-Aykroyd 
conflict. Whenever any of that plays out onscreen, the movie turns 
mediocre. GROSSE POINT BLANK works when it gives us the biting 
satire on the politics of murder show and how pathetic all the high 
school people are 10 years after graduation. And you thought your 
high school classmates couldn't get any more pathetic...</P>
