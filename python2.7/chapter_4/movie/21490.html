<PRE>                              TOY STORY 2
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Previously destined for a straight-to-video release, the TOYS are
back in the long-awaited sequel to 1995's massively successful TOY
STORY.</P>
<P>     Thank God!  Almost as good as the original, TOY STORY 2 is an
unabashed crowd-pleaser to children and adults.  With enough
(non-offensive) adult humor and plenty of good-natured kid stuff, this
film had our tiny audience in stitches from start to finish.</P>
<P>     TOY STORY 2 picks up right where the original left off.  With Andy
(Morris) off to `Cowboy Camp,' Mom (Metcalf) decides to throw a yard
sale, and Woody ends up being stolen by the evil toy magnate Al
(Knight), owner of Al's Toy Barn.  Turns out Woody (Hanks) is a relic
from a 1950's TV show, and he completes an extremely valuable collection
which is set to be shipped off to a museum in Japan.</P>
<P>     Held prisoner, Woody runs into the rest of the cast of `Woody's
Roundup'--his horse Bullseye, prospector Stinky Pete (Grammer), and
spunky cowgirl Jessie (Cusack).  Turns out they're okay with the Japan
trip, and soon, Woody starts to like the idea of moving overseas to be
idolized forever.  But it's Buzz Lightyear (Allen), to the rescue!  With
the aid of the usual gang of followers from the original, a massive
mission to save Woody is launched.</P>
<P>     A huge chunk of TOY STORY 2's humor is derived from clever
referential jokes to the original, so be sure you've seen it first.
Also, the story is tons of fun, but--and believe me, I feel weird about
typing these words--it also lacks the depth of the first film.  As
messages go, the original TOY STORY's themes of blind acceptance were
more powerful.</P>
<P>     Still, Hanks and Allen are incredibly fun, but it's Cusack's Jessie
that steals the show with as the over-the-top cowgirl.  Overall, TOY
STORY 2 is simply a whole lot of good, clean fun.  And there ain't
nothing wrong with that.</P>
