<P>PROJECT X (1987) *** Directed by Jonathan Kaplan. Written by Stanley 
Weiser. Story by Weiser.Photography, Dan Cundey. Editing, O. Nicholas 
Brown. Music, James Horner. Cast: Matthew Broderick (Jimmy Garrett),

(Robertson) Jonathan Stark (Sergeant Krieger),  Robin Gammell 
(Colonel Niles), Stephen Lang (Watts), Jean Smart (Dr. Criswell) , et 
al,  Producers,  Walter F. Parkes ,  Lawrence Lasker. A 20th Century 
Fox film, 108 minutes, PG</P>
<P>This X is a PG that could entertain the entire alphabet of audiences.</P>
<P>It seems to be telling us that, statistically, films about apes are 
doing better than films about humans. In previous and recent years, 
there was Greystoke; The Legend Of Tarzan, Lord Of The Apes (1984), 
Link (1986) And Now Project X.  Greystoke is, in my opinion, an 
underrated, humanistic film, hurt in part by its shortening before 
release. Link is a clever, witty but un-smug movie with splendid 
simian effects and astute cross references to other films. Because of 
vagaries of  misdistribution it went practically unseen, but  was 
later re-released in New York where the reviews were very good.</P>
<P>Project X has much appeal. So, apes now stand at a perfect score of 3 
on 3 that no other movie subject can approach. Perhaps this is owed 
to the fact that the serious ape-movie makers are smarter, more 
intelligent and caring than their colleagues.</P>
<P>In the movie, Teri, (Helen Hunt),  a University of Wisconsin graduate 
student,  has been training for three years the Africa-born 
chimpanzee Virgil, teaching him sign language. It's nicely done, 
without cuteness or gratuitous picturesqueness or laughs. Teri looks 
like a real student. Virgil is smart  (it seems that chimps have the 
intelligence of a 5-year old.)  Less convincing is the fact that 
Teri's grant is not renewed --most universities know a good project 
when they see it. This arbitrariness is, of course, introduced for 
dramatic reasons, as Virgil is sent to a secret Air Force laboratory 
in Florida.</P>
<P>Jimmy (Matthew Broderick), a young flier with a record of messing up, 
is  let out of military jail , assigned as a last chance to that lab, 
and given charge of, natch,  Virgil --who, with nice parallelism is 
in a cage.</P>
<P>Inevitably it is love at third sight between the two. Broderick, at 
that time, came from that vast reservoir of anonymous-faced young 
actors. Both young and older,  generic non-stars are one of the banes 
of world (not just American) cinema today , unlike the days when a 
Clark Gable could never have been taken for a Spencer Tracy or a 
Robert Taylor, not a Charles Boyer for a  Jean Gabin.</P>
<P>Yet here, having Broderick play an ordinary , un-quirky fellow --and 
play him naturally and well -- you get the paradox that his Jimmy 
rapidly gets personalized.
The lab's hush-hush project is to teach apes to fly  simulators in 
lieu of human pilots. Jimmy senses there's more to it than this, but, 
fascinated by the chimps, busies himself with Virgil, even discovers 
(in a clever sequence) that monkey  speaks sign language.</P>
<P>The moment comes, though, when the X in Project X takes on its real 
and sinister significance... one that I will not reveal and spoil 
surprise and suspense. It is at this point that the film leaves the 
ground of scientific and humanistic  realism and plausibility, and 
soars into the fantasies of Movie Space. Teri reappears, high drama, 
pathos, action and the simian version of Spartacus follow one another 
with a speed that just might,  temporarily,  camouflage the 
silliness, especially since it is entertaining silliness. The ending 
is happy...and outlandish.</P>
<P>The introduction of monkeyshines and  shenanigans comes late enough 
for the movie to have already conditioned you through its leisurely, 
low-key, credible developments . The film-makers --the two producers 
were the co-writers of War Games) exercised restraint,  even made a 
modest, valid point about Jimmy's growth and new sense of values. 
Both in the early and later parts, the acting by the monkeys, Jimmy 
and his co-workers (in that order) is very good, while the  military 
higher-ups and scientists are ho-hum.</P>
<P>But the  film sets a solid sense of poignancy that builds up and 
could carry you through the frenetic wind-up.</P>
<P>The chimps are irresistibly interesting and entertaining. Credit the 
unseen studio trainers who are the real stars of the movie. Mind you, 
not everything is in the training. Many shots that look entirely 
spontaneous involve a very large amount of editing and trickery. Apes 
play multiple roles, reaction shots are painstakingly chosen among 
thousands to match whatever the apes are reacting to, and so on.</P>
<P>The movie does raise serious issues about the treatment of animals as 
guinea chimps, as well as more general  questions on man-and-beast 
relationships. More important yet is the unstated fact of the 
obscenity of war, the war that underlies military research and 
expenditures. There's finally the equally unspoken but  inescapable 
question of why we can teach apes but not human children?</P>
<P>  Project X certainly will not go down in history as a great movie, 
but it is one of those films (much fewer than one thinks), of which 
one can say that they give you your money's worth in charm, fun, and 
sentiment while you're watching. I took quite enthusiastic notes when 
I saw this film again. As the days went by, I modified my notes 
downward, because, in retrospect, less and less of the movie stayed 
with me . And thinking about it, its out-and-out Hollywoodisms tended 
to crowd out some of its better aspects. Even so, I'm keeping it on 
the recommended list of above-average flicks.</P>
<P>Jonathan  Kaplan was a low-budget film-maker until he directed the 
1983 sleeper Heart Like a Wheel. He has excellent control over 
Project X,  shows sensitivity and (too much) imagination.</P>
<P>Matthew Broderick, then fresh  from his title role in the delightful 
Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986), was and still is one of our most 
likable young (and later, youthful) actors. In particular he was a 
joy in  Biloxi Blues (1988),  impressive in Glory (1989, a howl  in 
the relatively underrated The Freshman (1990),  and a key presence in 
the very underrated  Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle (1994) .</P>
<P>Constantly employed for close to thirty years, in TV (mostly) and 
movies, Helen Hunt is here in one of her earliest  "legit" features 
and shows clear promise. She had to wait until As Good as it Gets 
(1997) for her Oscar and her Golden Globe.</P>
<P>Production values are very good, from the  difficult photography and 
special effects  to the appropriately cold look of aseptic sets that 
contrast with the warmth of the chimps and their trainers. Only the 
music is annoyingly intrusive as it goes from strong beats of  break 
dancing and disco to a relentless, deja heard assemblage of 
audience-conditioning devices.  The apes' noises are much nicer.</P>
