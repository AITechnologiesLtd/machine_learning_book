<PRE>He Got Game (1998)
reviewed by: Paul B. Miller</PRE>
<PRE>Director:  Spike Lee</PRE>
<P>        In the pre-release hype for "He Got Game," marketers made sure
that, by repeating the film's release date (May 1) over and over like
a mantra, it was engraved in our memory.  And yet a more appropriate
release date for the Spike Lee's new film would have been one month
before, on April 1, or the day after the NCAA Basketball Tournament
finals (Kentucky won again, in case you forgot). For without a doubt
one of the strongest sides of this solid but ultimately disappointing
film is its definitive commentary on the sleaze and hypocrisy of the
recruitment process in big-time college athletics.</P>
<P>Lee's portrait of Jesus Shuttlesworth, the most sought-after
high school basketball player ever, communicates a convincing moral
truism that all of us ordinary, anonymous people know or should know
already: that fame and stardom, those most envied and coveted of
attributes, are in many ways unenviable burdens, because you can no
longer be sure just who your friends are and just who is
gravy-training.  If you were Kobe Byrant, how complicated would it be
to go out and make a new friend?  Whom could you trust?</P>
<P>Jesus is in fact surrounded by Judahs, including his high
school coach, girlfriend, and uncle-guardian, who try to cash in on
his lucrative future.  He is left to fend for himself in a sea of
sharks, a feat requiring almost as much skill as on-court prowess.  In
one particular scene, an NBA agent tries to woo the him with a Rolex
and a Ferrari whose stereo system "costs as much as a small trailer
home.".  The real drama of the movie, however, revolves around a
certain irony: Jesus's father Jake (Denzel Washington) also wants to
profit off his son's talents.  If he can convince Jesus to attend Big
State University, the governor will cut short the time he is serving
in the state penitentiary (for having accidentally killed his wife,
Jesus's mother).  Is Jake a gravy-trainer like the rest?  Or is it a
father's prerogative, especially given his circumstances, to make such
a request of his son?</P>
<P>That dilemma unfolds brilliantly in the film, and Ray Allen's
performance and presence on the screen are a wonderful surprise.  His
voice and delivery qualify him as a bonafide talent. Director Spike
Lee deserves tremendous credit for both casting and directing here
(NBA stars Travis Best and Rick Fox also give credible performances).
And yet the film suffers from a certain unevenness.  The very least I
expected was unforgettable basketball scenes, and, granted, the
one-on-one match-ups between Father and Son (one flashback when the
father is twice the size of the son, one climactic scene when the son
is a head taller) are well done.  But the pick-up game depicted
towards the beginning of the film rather disappointing.  I have yet to
see a fictional "basketball movie" that successfully captured the real
rhythm of a full court game -- the moves, jump shots, steals, blocks,
dunks, and fast breaks.  While Lee assembles these elements in a
fast-moving sequence on a grandiose scale, with lavish cinematography
and the music of Aaron Copeland's "Hoe-Down," the scene suffers the
same misfortune as the cathedrals in Spain: that is, we are not
permitted enough visual distance to take in the entirety of the
spectacle.  Our vantage point is on the court, from within the lane,
and I somehow kept wishing I had a cheaper seat.  While other
reviewers have referred to Copeland's sound track as "unforgettable,"
I found the "Hoe-Down" sequence to be incongruous, the sounds coming
from the court drowning out the music and relegating it to the
background.  The "Appalachian Spring" introduction, accompanying
images of people playing basketball all over the country, is more
effective.</P>
<P>Those, however, are merely the quibbles of a reviewer who also
happens to be a basketball fanatic.  There are other weaknesses in the
film that are more serious. We all know that one of Spike Lee's
biggest problems as a director are the women in his films, and "He Got
Game" is no exception.  One of the potentially most interesting
aspects of the story is the relationship between Jake and his daughter
Mary (Zelda Harris), Jesus' younger sister.  Mary is a strong
character, whose relationship with her father is different from Jesus'
and whose independence adds to the complexity of the other characters.
Yet she dissapears almost entirely from the second half of the film in
favor of the manly one-on-one confrontation between Jesus and Jake.
Likewise, Jesus' Aunt Sally (Michele Shay) is a positive character,
one of the few who refuses to even discuss the idea of profiting off
her nephew, yet she too dissappears, never to be seen again, though
kowtowing Uncle Bubba (Bill Nunn) reappears in a new Lexus.  The other
women who frequent the film are, frankly, sluts and whores, from the
coeds at Tech University who like to sleep with basketball players, to
the bare-breasted sex-kittens whose services are hired to convince
Jesus to matriculate there.  Jesus's girlfriend Lala (Rosario Dawson)
doesn't fare much better.  Her self-serving financial motivation is
portrayed in a quasi-sympathetic light (there's no way her
relationship with Jesus will survive, why not make some money off
it?), but she also sleeps around behind his back, lies, and, in
another flashback, is shown to be the one entirely at fault for an
unwanted pregnancy.</P>
<P>But the episode that almost ruins the film, in my opinion,
involves the relationship between Jake and the (yet another!)
prostitute (Milla Jovich) whom he saves from the clutches of some evil
pimp.  Not only does she set aside her professional motives to
pleasure Jake free of charge, he, of course, practically reforms her
at the end.  Though the performances in this sub-plot are decent, how
can viewers possibly take such a preposterous cliche seriously?</P>
<P>In the end, we are left with a good film, but one with
serious faults.  I agree with Roger Ebert that the final scene is
"daring and original" but I am more wary of its effectiveness.  No
doubt "He Got Game" stands above "White Man Can't Jump," "Blue Chips,"
"Hoosiers," "Eddy," et. al, but "Hoop Dreams" retains the title as the
definitive basketball movie.</P>
