<P>How do you review a film like "Scary Movie"? Certainly not on the basis of
plot. The "story" of a spoof is usually just a framework for gags -- to
assess it on that criterion would be like judging a dress on the quality
of the hanger. Acting isn't really all that important either, as long as
the performers possess a certain amount of charisma and some notion of
comic timing. Direction? Virtually irrelevant. Cinematography? Get real.</P>
<P>No, all that matters in deciding whether or not "Scary Movie" is any good
are the laughs. And "Scary Movie" is the first parody I've seen in years
that has laughs in droves. But fair warning first: I'm a big fan of the
"Naked Gun" movies. I enjoyed "Spaceballs". If your sense of humor runs
contrary to my own, this review likely won't apply much to you.</P>
<P>"Scary Movie" started life as two separate screenplays -- "Scream If You
Know What I Did Last Halloween" and "Last Summer I Screamed Because Friday
The 13th Fell On Halloween" -- which were merged into one by director
Keenen Ivory Wayans. Ironically, the final moniker was a working title for
"Scream", the progenitor of the current crop of teen-oriented slasher
films. If you haven't already guessed, "Scary Movie" is a pastiche
of this whole genre. If you've been avoiding these sorts of pictures, you
might want to give this one a pass too, as you might not get many of the
jokes.</P>
<P>The storyline of "Scary Movie" broadly follows the plot of "Scream", with
elements of other films (notably "Scream 2" and "I Know What You Did Last
Summer") thrown in for good measure. We again start off with a Big Star
making popcorn. In "Scream" it was Drew Barrymore (playing "Casey 
Becker"), here it's Carmen Electra (playing "Drew Becker", wink wink). The
phone rings, and sure enough it's a serial killer on the other line,
wearing the same Ghostface get-up as in "Scream". The voice on the phone
wants to know what the noise is. Carmen explains she just farted. The
killer was referring to the popcorn.</P>
<P>Soon Carmen is racing through the house and across her lawn. She comes to
a signpost with arrows reading "Safety" and "Death" pointing in opposite
directions. You can probably guess the rest. The movie plays out
predictably from there, as teens are stalked and slain by the masked
villain -- or is it villains? But, really, who cares about the story?
It barely even makes sense, and the ending is particularly incredulous.</P>
<P>What is important is the way "Scary Movie" subverts its source material,
and this it does very well. The "Father Death" mask, for instance, has
gained the miraculous ability to reflect its owner's mood, generating some
bizarre visuals when the killer is toquing up. Toward the end, the(?)
murderer does a terrific imitation of Matthew Lillard, one of "Scream"'s
homicidal teenagers.</P>
<P>"Scary Movie" doesn't just target the slasher genre, either. Everything
from "The Matrix" to "Dawson's Creek" is up for grabs here, and there are
some great send-ups of human behaviour. One of my favourite scenes has
black actress Regina Hall attending a showing of "Shakespeare In Love". In
a terrific pastiche of rude moviegoers (and, in particular, the reputation
African-Americans have of talking back to the screen), Hall just doesn't
stop chattering. She even talks on her cell phone, loudly, to the disgust
of the all-white, upper-middle-class crowd. Ghostface slinks into the
audience to stab Hall, but the audience gets to her first, pulling out
their own weapons. "This is for 'Schindler's List'!" exclaims a
Hassidic Jew. You'll have to hear for yourself what film Hall ruined for
the Pope.</P>
<P>(When I saw "Scary Movie", there was a moron waving a laser pointer across
the screen during certain scenes -- the first time I've encountered this
particular brand of rudeness at a local theatre. Intriguingly, they 
stopped doing it after the scene I've just described. Coincidence?)</P>
<P>Not all the jokes are winners, though, and "Scary Movie" is hamstrung by
following the plot of "Scream" a little too closely; greater variation
would have made for a funnier, more dynamic film. Some of the humor is
rather tired -- the gag of giving the characters cutesy, referential names
("Buffy" Gilmore) was even done already in "Scream 3". And sometimes
"Scary Movie" just doesn't know when enough is enough, like the running
gag about Ray (Shawn Wayans) being a closet homosexual.</P>
<P>Furthermore, whereas the truly great spoofs set you up with an obvious
joke, then knock you down by taking it one step further, "Scary Movie" is
often content to go only halfway. A parody of the confession scene from
"The Blair Witch Project", for example, is an awful lot like every other
"Blair Witch" parody of the past year.</P>
<P>No doubt the most controversial aspect of "Scary Movie" will be the sheer
explicitness of many jokes. Remember two years ago, when the "franks and
beans" scene in "There's Something About Mary" was considered 
groundbreaking? Well, there's a "franks and beans" scene about every
fifteen minutes here, although for the most part they're pretty amusing,
fortunately. Consequently, parents may want to be wary of letting younger
children attend "Scary Movie". It strikes me as a movie for strictly high
school age at minimum, and even that might be pushing it.</P>
<P>Amongst the cast, the only real standout is newcomer Anna Faris, playing
Sidney -- er, Cindy Campbell, succeeding impressively at portraying the
virginal heroine while uttering and engaging in sheer filth. It's almost
eerie. Otherwise, the castmembers are basically just vehicles for the
jokes. There aren't characters here, just ciphers and cliches.</P>
<P>Yes indeed, "Scary Movie" is plotless, crude, and possessed of mostly 
marginal performances -- all the things film critics are supposed to 
abhor. But did I laugh my ass off anyway? You bet I did. Do I recommend
"Scary Movie"? God help me, yes.</P>
