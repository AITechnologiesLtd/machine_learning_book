<PRE>THE LOVE LETTER (Dreamworks)</PRE>
<P> There's one in every fiction workshop in college: the divorced mom
who's come back to school after 20 years to take some classes to help
her get started on her novel, which, as fate would have it, turns out to
be about a divorced mom who comes back to school after 20 years, wows
her fellow classmates, catches the eye of a hunky young professor and,
most importantly turns out a truly brilliant novel.
 Give one of these aspiring authors half a chance and she might turn out
something like "The Love Letter," a flaccid romantic comedy that proves
once and for all that (a) Kate Capshaw lacks the charisma to carry a
film on her own; (b) Tom Selleck should seriously consider setting up
"Magnum P.I. '99" instead of continuing to try to pass himself off as a
leading man on the big screen; and (c) it's time for Ellen DeGeneres to
finally move beyond the wink-wink lesbian jokes.
 Intended as an ode to the power of words, "Letter" is rarely worth
listening to, let alone watching, and matters aren't helped by
slice-and-dice editing that sometimes makes you wonder if the camera
started rolling in mid-scene or shut off before director Peter Ho-San
Chan called "cut." After awhile, the movie's utter lack of continuity
becomes much funnier than any of its attempts at humor.
 "Letter" is set in Loblolly By-The-Sea, the kind of provincial New
England town that exists only in lousy movies, a place where everyone is
intimately familiar with the plot of "Tosca," the local cinema runs a
Buster Keaton festival and the divorcee owner of a used book store can
somehow afford a sprawling mansion full of antiques. The divorcee in
question is Helen (Capshaw) who's managed to make it to her 40s while
still retaining the self-conscious tics of a schoolgirl. She's forever
tugging at her turtlenecks, wiping her nose with her hand and scurrying
mouse-like from room to room. For reasons known only to screenwriter
Maria Maggenti, most of the Loblolly men find this kind of behavior
irresistibly sexy, and when Helen comes across an anonymous love letter
brimming with passionate prose, she can't imagine which of her bashful
admirers might have sent it.
 Or perhaps -- since the letter had no addressee -- it was meant for
Helen's co-worker Janet (DeGeneres), a good-time gal who'd love to
kindle some flames with fireman George (Selleck). But George is hot for
Helen, who's somehow certain college student Johnny (Tom Everett Scott)
is her secret Romeo. The May-September affair that develops between
Helen and Johnny is a fairly interesting plot development -- especially
since Scott is by far the least irritating member of the cast -- but
Maggenti doesn't seem to have any idea what to do with it.
 So "Letter" soon drops that story thread in favor of giving us entirely
too much information about Helen mom's (Blythe Danner) and Grandma
(Gloria Stuart), both of whom are introduced with a burst of piccolo
music so you'll know right off the bat they're a nutty pair. No,
eccentricity is not in short supply here; as for laughs, charm and
passion, that's another story. James Sanford</P>
