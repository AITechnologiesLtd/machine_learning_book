<P>     In early 1992, Interscope Communications released a Paul Michael
Glaser film called THE CUTTING EDGE.  While admittedly not a great
example of cinematic grandeur, this formula love story/sports movie had
a certain charm which managed to lift it slightly above many similar
films.  Now, that same Paul Michael Glaser (also Starsky of STARSKY AND
HUTCH fame) has turned his attention from skating and hockey to
basketball.  Once again backed by Interscope Communications, Glaser has
fashioned another formula-choked motion picture, only this one doesn't
boast Moira Kelly or D. B. Sweeney.  THE AIR UP THERE makes it painfully
clear how important their chemistry was to THE CUTTING EDGE, because
without it, there's very little worthwhile remaining.</P>
<P>     Once, Jimmy Dolan (Kevin Bacon) was the star point guard for the
Saint Joseph's Bulls, leading his team to a National Championship.
Then he blew out his leg and his hopes of playing in the NBA were
crushed for good.  Several years later, Dolan is one of two Bulls'
assistant coaches, waiting for his opportunity to take the head seat.
But, just as the old coach announces his retirement, Jimmy finds
himself in the unenviable position of having chased away a promising
recruit.  To polish his tarnished image, he decides to take a big
gamble and track down Saleh (Charles Gitonga Maina), a young native of
the Winabi tribe in Africa who has shown amazing instincts for the
game.  After crossing the ocean to find his would-be star, however,
Jimmy discovers that while Saleh may harbor fantasies about the NBA,
but he is the son of the Winabi's chief, and his first duty is to his
father and his village.</P>
<P>     Anytime there's a movie strictly based on a formula, it has to
have a hook to hold the audience.  The biggest failing of THE AIR UP
THERE is that, moving along for over one-hundred minutes with everyone
doing the expected things, it has none.  The big basketball game at the
end lacks any semblance of tension since, unlike in a real (or even
well-simulated) sporting event, the outcome is obvious from the
beginning.  Perhaps a romance might have spiced things up, but that
probably would have taken away from several tedious male bonding scenes
between Jimmy and Saleh.</P>
<P>     With the except of the nagging tendency to use slow-motion shots,
most of the pseudo-basketball games are well-choreographed.  Glaser,
who used Robin Cousins as a consultant in THE CUTTING EDGE, here uses
Bob McAdoo with similar effective results.  While several slam dunks
are obviously staged, the scenes on the court look uniformly good.</P>
<P>     Oddly enough, perhaps the most interesting element of THE AIR UP
THERE--Jimmy's induction into the Winabi tribe--is given approximately
five minutes of screen time.  Potentially worth an entire movie in its
own right, this sequence is relegated to a few quick clips of Kevin
Bacon climbing a mountain and huddling against some rocks during a
thunderstorm.</P>
<P>     As premises go, the one underlying the major conflict of THE AIR
UP THERE is feeble.  It stretches credibility beyond the breaking point
to imagine that two tribes would willingly battle each other in a
basketball game for the rights to Winabi land, especially when one of
the contestant doesn't have a team.  Even in lighthearted movies like
this, there are bounds to what a thinking audience will accept, which
THE AIR UP THERE flouts.</P>
<P>     Another problematical issue is that Saleh doesn't seem like the
kind of phenom to engender the kind of interest he gets.  In fact, from
what we see, his brother is a better player.  In that way, perhaps the
casting of 18-year-old Charles Gitonga Maina is a mistake.  He's
adequate as an actor, but not all that impressive on the court.</P>
<P>     Kevin Bacon is at his impish best, but even his bubbly performance
can't save a film with this little substance.  He manages to invest
Jimmy Dolan with a few human traits, and he does his best with the
trite "self-centered guy coming to really care for others" subplot, but
there's only so much an actor can do with inferior material.</P>
<P>     There are good basketball movies out there, HOOSIERS being the
obvious example of a tightly-scripted story with a buildup to a rousing
climax.  THE AIR UP THERE is appealing and unthreatening, and therein
lies its weakness--the unwillingness to take a risk.  Those who don't
mind viewing a recycled story probably will enjoy this film.  It has
the COOL RUNNINGS/MIGHTY DUCKS mentality--a lightweight, brainless
family movie chronicling the triumph of the underdog.</P>
<P>     As for Paul Michael Glaser, he should return to skating movies.
This time around, he's on thin ice.</P>
