<PRE>                                FREQUENCY
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     The time travel/time bending genre always seems worn out.  The very
topic lends itself to the production of hacky movies like Millennium,
and yet I am constantly surprised to see one film after another making
good on the hidden promise of the genre.  Witness the Back to the Future
series and the powerful 12 Monkeys.  As it turns out, mucking with time
actually pays off more often than not!</P>
<P>     Not only is Frequency a good flick, it's fully worthy of a place
among one of the best timetwisters ever made.</P>
<P>     Incorrectly being marketed as a sci-fi movie (not to mention
poorly-titled and bearing the dumb tagline "What if it changed
everything?"), Frequency is the story of a father and son, reunited
across time through a ham radio and the rare appearance of the aurora
borealis over Queens.</P>
<P>     In 1969, Dad Frank (Dennis Quaid) is a star firefighter with a
loving family.  30 years later, his son John (Jim Caviezel) is a NYC
cop.  When John, just about scraping the bottom of his life, finds his
long-dead dad's old radio set in a footlocker, he plugs it in and hears
a mysterious voice on the other end.  As you can imagine, beyond all
expectation, it's his father communicating from back in time... the day
before he is about to die.</P>
<P>     Frequency soon becomes infinitely more complex when John tells
Frank of his imminent demise.  "Go the other way" in that burning
warehouse, and he would have lived.  A skeptical Frank tests Jim's
prognostications (the "Amazin' Mets" World Series being the backdrop for
the 1969 action), and when the warehouse fire materializes as promised,
Frank decides to take the advice, surviving the blaze.</P>
<PRE>     And, er, it really does change everything.</PRE>
<P>     All those geeky "what if" questions you may have had about mucking
with the past are addressed in Frequency, with much of the film taking
on the form of a whodunit, as father and son try to find a serial killer
that crops up when Frank's survival alters the course of history.  The
twists and turns are fascinating and unpredictable; in fact, Frequency
marks one of the extremely few times I've watched a movie where I
honestly had no idea what was going to happen next.</P>
<P>     Even more amazing is that Frequency marks writer Toby Emmerich's
first script: Emmerich is actually a music executive at New Line
Cinema!  Director Gregory Hoblit's best-known work is probably that dog
of a movie Primal Fear, and he's come up with genius here.  And the
acting is first-rate, especially Quaid, who I haven't seen shine in a
decade.  Altogether, if there is any justice in the world, Frequency
should become this year's Sixth Sense.</P>
<PRE>     Highly recommended.</PRE>
