<P>Alan Reed and Mel Blanc are probably rolling over in their graves. Joseph
Barbera and William Hanna might just go into shock. It's not that the latest
Flintstones movie, Viva Rock Vegas, which `posthumously' credits the latter
two as executive producers, is a live action interpretation of their classic
animated television series that will cause such reactions. Rather, it is
that the movie seems to lack all the non-material traits that made the 1960'
s series an integral part of American culture.</P>
<P>A prequel to both the 1994 film and the television series, this installment
of Bedrock's favorite two families actually pre-dates their being families.
Fred (Mark Addy) and Barney (Stephen Baldwin) are two young bachelors with
nothing but their lives ahead of them. Barney is optimistic, exclaiming `we
get to spend the rest of our lives working in a rock quarry – who says
dreams don't come true?' Fred, on the other hand, desperately seeks a
companion and realizes that this will require action, pointing out `it's not
like something is just going to drop out of the sky, land right in front of
you and change your whole life.' Being that the movie seems to have no
original humor, you can guess what happens as soon as Fred finishes the
aforementioned statement.</P>
<P>Enter Gazoo (Alan Cumming), the pint-sized alien who is temporarily expelled
from his own planet and banished to earth where he is to study human mating
rituals. This leads to numerous sexual jokes and an awkward homosexual scene
that shouldn't be in a film aimed at America's youngest moviegoers. It is
also most ironic that such a subplot is used in a film co-starring Kristen
Johnston (Wilma), an actress who has earned notice for her role in
television's `3rd Rock from the Sun' – a show with an all-too-similar plot.</P>
<P>Opposite Fred and Barney are Wilma and Betty (Jane Krakowski), who are
actually opposites themselves. Wilma is the classic poor-little-rich girl as
she struggles with pressure to marry Chip Rockefeller (Thomas Gibson); she
is a citizen of the upperclass even though her heart is in the unruly valley
of Bedrock, which her mansion overlooks. Borrowing a chapter from another
abysmal movie, Titanic, it turns out that Rockefeller is even sleazier than
Wilma thinks with his sole purpose of luring her being that he needs her
fortune to escape some mob debts. For the mean time, he has Rocko (Danny
Woodburn) and Rocko (Tony Longo), his two `favorite made men' on his
pre-historic tail. And, should he not wed Wilma by a quickly-approaching
deadline, he will `be sleeping with the tunasaurus.'</P>
<P>Betty, on the other hand, is a single waitress with an average apartment and
constant smile on her face. She is hip, she is cool and she not only takes
Wilma under her wing but accepts a date with Fred even though his pickup
line is nothing but a series of incomprehensible grunts. Barney tags along
to make it a double date at the carnival and by night's end the couples have
swapped, Dino is born and Gazoo is viciously assaulted on a Ferris wheel.</P>
<P>The similarities between Fred and the Coen Brothers' Dude Lebowski, from The
Big Lebowski, are a few too many to go unnoticed and far too many to be what
Hanna and Barbera had in mind. Yes, they did create Fred's famous two-toe
bowling technique but surely they didn't mean for him to be the portly bum
he is here. Additionally, Wilma is far larger than she should be, Barney
decidedly more pathetic (how appropriate for one of the Baldwins –if only
that old SNL skit would come true!) and Betty too promiscuous. Perhaps this
could be ignored, although it would certainly be difficult, if the film had
the guts to take off its training wheels and ride on its own rather than
take the time to pay homage to the original Flintstones couple in a mid-film
montage that only serves to remind of more pleasurable entertainment.</P>
<P>Just making matters worse, watching the scenes where the film does venture
astray from traditional Bedrock is like taking The Great Movie Ride over and
over for 90 minutes. Everything from significant plot lines to quick jokes
are stolen from movies ranging from Arsenic and Old Lace and some Three
Stooges pictures to the more recent Honeymoon in Vegas and Aladdin.</P>
<P>Yet, despite all the negative aspects of Viva Rock Vegas, I did discover a
tear streaming down my face right before the credits rolled. I wondered how
this could be and then it struck me – my contact lens had slipped.</P>
