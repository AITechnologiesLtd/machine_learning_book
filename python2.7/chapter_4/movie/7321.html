<P>     The honeymoon is a short one for young American film-makers, a
distressing fact of life Kevin Smith had to learn the hard way.  In 1994,
Smith was the wunderkind behind CLERKS, a low-budget, day-in-the-life
twentysomething comedy which became a critical darling.  Only a year
later, Smith made a studio-financed follow-up called MALLRATS, a film so
widely reviled that Smith publicly apologized for it, announcing "I don't
know what I was thinking."  Smith was thinking much more clearly when he
returned to a sub-seven figure budget for CHASING AMY, but more
significantly, he was thinking more maturely.  Though he sometimes
explores his themes with more earnestness than clarity, Smith gives
CHASING AMY both a wicked sense of humor and a genuine sensitivity about
the complications of sexual politics.</P>
<P>     Smith's trademark pair of Jersey-bred buddies are Holden McNeil (Ben
Affleck) and Banky Edwards (Jason Lee), childhood friends who have
co-created a popular alternative comic book called "Bluntman and Chronic."
At a comic book convention, Holden meets a fellow artist named Alyssa
Jones (Joey Lauren Adams), with whom he is instantly smitten.  There is a
small impediment to his adoration, however:  Alyssa happens to be a
lesbian.  Holden's love appears destined to be unrequited -- a fact about
which Banky actually seems to be pleased -- until his relationship with
Alyssa begins to take some unpredictable turns.  As Holden struggles to
deal with all the complications of being with a woman like Alyssa, cracks
begin to develop in his relationships with both Alyssa and Banky.</P>
<P>     For the first half-hour of CHASING AMY, Kevin Smith concentrates on
churning out the laughs with his often-crude, usually pop-culture-heavy
dialogue.  He shows an admirable willingness to take on potentially thorny
topics like gay stereotypes -- there's a great sequence involving a gay
black comic book writer (Dwight Ewell) who is forced to keep up a public
image as a militant Afro-centrist -- and a conversation about Archie and
Jughead as gay lovers works despite its forced Tarantino-as-a-slacker
quality.  Smith even pulls off a riff on Jaws in which Banky and Alyssa
compare wounds from oral sex horror stories like an emotionally immature
Richard Dreyfuss and a lesbian Robert Shaw (though the flashback
literalization of those stories is ill-advised).  While the jokes are
rarely profound, they are usually effective and delivered with zing by
the actors.</P>
<P>     Smith _does_ try to get profound as he focuses on the relationship
between Holden and Alyssa, and it is there that CHASING AMY gets clumsy.
When there is a point to be made in CHASING AMY, it generally gets made by
people making speeches -- Holden as he confesses his love to Alyssa,
Alyssa as she responds to Holden's jealousy about her past, even Smith
himself in his recurring role as taciturn layabout-cum-philosopher Silent
Bob (the film's title comes from Silent Bob's story about an ill-fated
romance).  Smith is still a writer first and a director second, and
CHASING AMY gets awfully sluggish as he lets conversations drag into
exchanges of soul-baring testimonials.  It doesn't help that two of the
longer speeches are delivered by Joey Lauren Adams, a talented actress but
one whose Jennifer Tilly voice becomes grating when emotional scenes force
her to wail for several minutes at a time.  Smith clearly wants to stretch
himself beyond satiric comedy, but he never quite finds a pace which gives
the more serious moments in CHASING AMY a spark to match their sincerity.</P>
<P>     It's a shame Smith's romantic observations never quite click as
drama, because his ideas are far more intriguing than most of what is
served up in contemporary romantic comedies.  CHASING AMY is really about
male sexual hang-ups, and Smith digs deep into the insecurities of his
characters to find out why guys dwell on the sexual histories of their
partners.  There is an impressive lack of judgmental posturing in the way
Smith develops his characters, and he shows keen insight into how
different people respond to societal norms about sexual behavior.  It's
simply clear that Smith is still a guy who writes like people sitting
around talking, and that style works much better with comedy than with
drama.  When it is at its funniest, CHASING AMY reminds you why everyone
was so high on Kevin Smith in the wake of CLERKS.  And even when it
falters as a drama, it proves that Smith isn't content with making CLERKS
over and over.  Or, perhaps more important, that he won't make MALLRATS
over and over.  Anyone for a second honeymoon?</P>
