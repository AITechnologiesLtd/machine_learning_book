<P>     Take a little Quentin Tarantino, a little Martin Scorsese, and a 
little Richard Linklater, add a $4 million budget, then dilute it all 
with a derivative script, and you get KICKED IN THE HEAD, director 
Matthew Harrison's third feature (the other two were SPARE ME and RHYTHM 
THIEF).  Harrison, who has been making movies since he was a kid, 
apparently has yet to develop a unique film making voice.  KICKED IN THE 
HEAD has a tired, unoriginal feel, as if it was put together using the 
spare parts from numerous better entries.</P>
<P>     KICKED IN THE HEAD is about losers and lowlifes in the Generation X 
world.  The main character, Redmond (Kevin Corrigan), is a 
twentysomething slacker who is just about the most irksome individual I 
can imagine having as a motion picture lead.  Redmond is a shiftless, 
self-pitying whiner who spends the entire film coming up with reasons to 
feel sorry for himself.  He doesn't have job (and doesn't want one), 
pines for a stewardess (Linda Fiorentino) who won't give him the time of 
day, and ignores the one person (Lili Taylor) who appears to truly care 
for him.  </P>
<P>     Redmond's Uncle Sam (James Woods) is a two-bit crook who has gotten 
his hands on a nice stash of dope.  Using Redmond as his delivery boy, 
he hopes to extricate himself from the "deep doo-doo" that he's in.  
Unfortunately for both Sam and Redmond, things don't go down as planned, 
and Redmond finds himself stuck with a package of cocaine while a local 
crime boss named Wacky Jack (Burt Young) breaths down his neck.</P>
<P>     During the course of its 90 minute running time, KICKED IN THE HEAD 
offers very little that's new or innovative, and the storyline fails to 
rise above the level of "passably interesting."  Harrison tries too hard 
to give his film the quirky, darkly comic tone that's in vogue today, 
and the result feels forced and artificial.  Redmond is the kind of 
character who might be at home in a Linklater film (particularly 
SUBURBIA).  The New York streets that he wanders are the territory of 
Martin Scorsese (who executive produced this movie).  And some of the 
pop-culture, pseudo-intellectual banter recalls that of Tarantino or 
Kevin Smith (there's a bit about the PLANET OF THE APES movies and an 
exchange about the difference between a "flight attendant" and a 
"stewardess").  The problem with Harrison isn't that he borrows from 
these directors, but that he fails to take it further.  And, since he's 
not as adept as any of them, KICKED IN THE HEAD comes across as a pale 
attempt to pilfer from their work.</P>
<P>     As generally uninvolving as KICKED IN THE HEAD is, it does boast a 
few innovative moments.  The film features several gunfights which are 
highlighted by the complete ineptitude of the participants.  Men fire 
off round after round after round, and, even at close range, they never 
manage to hit anyone.  Then there's the way Harrison gives one character 
his comeuppance.  Not only is the actual method deliciously ironic 
("hoist by his own petard" is the expression), but the matter-of-fact 
manner in which Harrison films it is noteworthy.  </P>
<P>     Although the director managed to snag some fairly well-known names 
for this film, we aren't inundated by top-notch performances.  Kevin 
Corrigan, who was in RHYTHM THIEF and WALKING AND TALKING, plays Redmond 
as if the character is a half-wit (maybe that's the point).  Michael 
Rapaport is his usual grating self.  Linda Fiorentino is absolutely 
wasted.  Only James Woods and Lili Taylor (who is trying to recapture 
the "Queen of the Independent Films" title from Parker Posey), playing 
against type as a sweet, innocent girl, turn in respectable work.</P>
<P>     As seemingly must be true of any Generation X character, Redmond is 
filled with self-doubt and unfulfilled longings.  His life, as revealed 
through this film, is a mass of questions and unresolved issues.  Does 
he find real love?  Does he uncover the elusive "truth" that he's always 
talking about?  Does his "attendant godling" re-discover her way?  Sad 
to say, I didn't really care one way or the other.  Somehow, Harrison 
managed to create a protagonist whom I was apathetic towards and place 
him in situations that I wasn't interested in.  And that's one aspect of 
movie-making that he didn't lift from Scorsese, Linklater, or Tarantino.</P>
