<P>     JADE is for cinematic anglers.  There are a lot of fish inhabiting
the murky, muddy waters of Joe Eszterhas' latest script, and, except for
the occasional shark or two, most of them are herrings--red herrings,
to be precise.  However, unlike a good mystery, where disparate plot
elements are knitted together into a satisfying (if occasionally
contrived) conclusion, JADE's loose ends unravel.  The finale
shamelessly cheats the audience, echoing that of another Eszterhas
disaster:  SLIVER.</P>
<P>     We've seen this story before--many, many times.  There's the sexy
femme fatale, the hard-nosed husband, and the generally-likable
investigative sort who's looking into the killing of a high-profile rich
guy with important ties.  This time, the actors aren't Sharon Stone and
Michael Douglas; they're David Caruso (assistant DA David Corelli),
Linda Fiorentino (psychiatrist Katrina Gavin), and Chazz Palminteri
(Katrina's top-notch lawyer husband, Matt Gavin).  These three get
tangled together in a web of sex and murder that involves fertility
masks, hidden video cameras, blackmail, a crooked governor (Richard
Crenna), and all sorts of other predictable twists.  (Ho-hum.)
Ultimately, it's not hard to guess the guilty party's identity, and,
even if you get it wrong, the manner in which the truth is revealed is
likely to leave you asking "Who cares?"</P>
<P>     The cast looks impressive, but none of these performers are likely
to underline this film on their resumes.  Caruso is as flat as a sheet
of paper.  This underplayed role definitely doesn't show off his screen
presence.  He has some, to be sure (check out MAD DOG AND GLORY), but it
hasn't emerged since his well-publicized departure from TV's NYPD BLUE.
Chazz Palminteri, who can play just about any kind of role--bad good
guys and good bad guys--isn't much of a standout, either, never
seeming to find more than a caricature in his big-money lawyer
character.  And Linda Fiorentino just re-works her LAST SEDUCTION
persona by adding a dose of humanity.  When you do something as well as
she did, typecasting is inevitable, I suppose.  The relationship between
these three, which is supposed to be a cornerstone of the film, isn't
believable.  Love, hatred, jealousy, and anger are portrayed with a
lukewarm lack of passion.</P>
<P>     Director William Friedkin has created a stylistic picture, but this
is an example of style without substance.  In THE FRENCH CONNECTION,
Friedkin oversaw one of the great chase sequences in screen history.
There's a chase scene in JADE, too, but it's far from the same class.
Repetitious and tedious, this stretches for the better part of ten
minutes and concludes with a highly-anticlimactic splash.  Maybe if
there had been an underwater camera at this point, we would have seen a
few of those red herrings swimming around.</P>
<P>     Eszterhas can take solace from his paycheck and the realization
that this is actually an improvement on his last screenplay (the better-
to-be-forgotten SHOWGIRLS), although not by much.  Like the streets of
San Francisco as portrayed in JADE, the quality of his work lately has
been all downhill.  There's not much right about this film, but at least
it illustrates a valuable point:  even a talented director and a
promising cast can't redeem a moronic storyline.</P>
