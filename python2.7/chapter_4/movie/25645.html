<P>A cross between "Quantum Leap" and "Field of Dreams" this sci-fi drama tells 
the story of a grown up son
who is able to talk to his dead father with his old hamm radio 30 years in 
the past. The son (James
Caviezial) saves the father (Dennis Quaid) from dying by telling him the 
future, but somehow they change
history and the mother dies at the hands of a serial killer. </P>
<P>There's a lot of time travel paradoxes that twist the story in knots but it 
doesn't matter much because at the
center of it all is a lot of heart and pure goodness. It's quite amazing the 
film is able to string together a
story about tracking down the same killer both in the past and the future. 
Maybe it's a little too Hollywood
at times but nevertheless it's enjoyable. </P>
