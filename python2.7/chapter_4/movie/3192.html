<PRE>                                LITTLE WOMEN
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Winona Ryder, Gabriel Byrne, Trini Alvarado,
           Christian Bale, Kirsten Dunst, Claire Danes,
           Samantha Mathis, Susan Sarandon.
Screenplay:  Robin Swicord.
Director:  Gillian Armstrong.</P>
<P>     It would be a tremendous disservice to think of LITTLE WOMEN as a
picture post card with a plot.  Sure, it is lovingly photographed, rich
in atmosphere and steeped in period detail.  But does Louisa May
Alcott's saga of 19th century adolescence have anything to say in
1994?  Is it really *about* anything?  The answer is a resounding yes.
It's about family, love, and the struggle of young women to find their
voice.  As brought to life by a magnificent cast and directed with
restraint by Gillian Armstrong, LITTLE WOMEN is sweet, glorious and
relevant.</P>
<P>     Set in Civil War-era Massachusetts, LITTLE WOMEN is the story of
the March family:  aspiring writer Jo (Winona Ryder); social Meg (Trini
Alvarado); shy, frail Beth (Claire Danes); and romantic Amy (Kirsten
Dunst, later Samantha Mathis).  Living with their mother (Susan
Sarandon) while their father is off fighting the war, the Marches
struggle with matters financial and personal.  Jo befriends a wealthy
young man (Christian Bale), and Meg is courted by a teacher (Eric
Stoltz).  Eventually, Jo finds herself in New York to pursue her craft,
where she meets Friedrick Baehr (Gabriel Byrne), a German scholar who
sees potential in her that even she herself is unable to recognize.</P>
<P>     Director Armstrong, who addressed the subject of women struggling
in a man's world in MY BRILLIANT CAREER, has done a splendid job with
this latest version of the oft-filmed story.  She never attempts to
inject inappropriate action into the narrative, and keeps her actors
quiet and naturalistic.  She is also assisted by a wonderful technical
crew.  Cinematographer Geoffrey Simpson captures snow-covered
landscapes and glowing fall colors with grace, and production designer
Jan Roelfs fills the screen with lovely interiors.  The crowning touch
is Thomas Newman's beautiful score, which perfectly complements the
beautiful images Armstrong provides.</P>
<P>     The primary reason the screen glows, however, is a remarkable cast
which features the most talented young actresses in the business.  Jo
is the showcase role, and Winona Ryder gives her most complete
performance yet in taking it on; she is full of ambition, joy, and
self-doubt.  Physically, she's quite wrong for the part (it's hard to
believe anyone would consider Ryder's hair her "one beauty," even
without makeup), but she's so impressive emotionally that her looks can
be forgiven.  Trini Alvarado is an effervescent Meg, and Kirsten Dunst,
fresh from her triumph in INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE, is the perfect
image-conscious Amy.  Claire Danes, from TV's critically-praised by
largely unwatched "My So-Called Life," may be the best of the bunch.
Beth's role is small, but Danes injects phenomenal emotion into every
one of her scenes, and her large, sad eyes guarantee that many eyes in
the audience will be damp at certain moments.  As a group (and
including Susan Sarandon as the progressive matriarch), they are so
uniformly good that they seem to keep making each other better.</P>
<P>     What may be most impressive about this LITTLE WOMEN, adapted by
Robin Swicord, is how it seems as though it might have been written
yesterday.  There is no anachronism in Alcott's Transcendentalist
proto-feminism, though upon first glance it might appear so.  These
little women struggle with all the issues involved in becoming grown
women, from the mundane (Meg's concern about the dress she wears to a
society function) to the profound (coping with the difficulties of
love).  Most of all, they struggle to assert themselves as individuals
in a world which still questions their motives for wanting to be
individuals.  Jo is frustrated in her first attempts at publishing her
work because she is attempting to something and someone else; her
realization that her own experience is valid, and that she can touch
others through its expression, is a revelation.</P>
<P>     I saw LITTLE WOMEN in a theater where perhaps one third of the
audience consisted of girls under sixteen.  LITTLE WOMEN may be a story
to which they are most attuned, but it is a delight for anyone who
appreciates genuine emotion, insight, and beautiful filmmaking.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 little women:  9.</PRE>
