<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Sometimes the lamest ideas translate into the funniest films, and Galaxy
Quest is a perfect example of this strange paradox.  Basically a Star
Trek spoof, Quest follows the exploits of five washed-up actors that
appeared years ago on a hokey but popular sci-fi television series,
aptly called `Galaxy Quest.'  Through a series of bizarre circumstances,
the group find themselves battling real aliens on a real spaceship, with
real lives (including their own) at stake.</P>
<P>Having burned through their fifteen minutes of fame during the run of
`Quest,' the unemployed actors have since been relegated to making
appearances at nerd-filled show conventions and opening electronic chain
stores.  Like Trek, each member of the cast despises their on-air
leader, and the show's most popular character, Commander Peter Quincy
Taggart, who is played by Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen, Home Improvement).
Among his hilariously predictable underlings are Dr. Lazarus of
Tev'Meck, portrayed by Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman, Dogma), a
Shakespearean-trained Brit that proclaims, `I was in `Richard III!' and
hates his character's silly catch-phrase, `By Grabthar's hammer, by the
suns of Warvan, you shall be avenged!'</P>
<P>Sigourney Weaver (Alien: Resurrection) plays Gwen DeMarco, who in turn
plays Lt. Tawny Madison, a blonde sex-kitten whose only apparent duties
are to repeat whatever the computer has just said and to have buoyant
breasts.  The hilarious Tony Shalhoub (Stark Raving Mad) tackles the
role of Fred Kwan (Tech Sergeant Chen) while 10 Things I Hate About You
scene-stealer Daryl Mitchell is Tommy Webber, playing a grown-up Lt.
Laredo (the character was just a `Webster'-sized kid in the TV show).</P>
<P>During one `Quest' convention, Nesmith is approached by a gaggle of
geeks with hopeless haircuts and alien attire that claim their planet
will be destroyed without his help.  Since these conventions are a
breeding ground for costumed kooks and tech-babbling buffoons, he thinks
nothing of it.  At the next convention, a hungover Nesmith mistakes the
same group for the bookers of his next convention appearance and takes
off with them.</P>
<P>But the geeks aren't really geeks – they're bona-fide aliens (including
Just Shoot Me's Enrico Colantoni) that have picked up satellite
transmissions of `Quest' and mistaken them for historical documents of
Earth's continual triumph over its interstellar adversaries.  They've
recreated the spaceship from `Quest,' incorporating every facet of the
show into its design, and legitimately need Nesmith's help to fend off a
barbaric alien race from wiping out their planet.  The chief baddie is,
I think, the bass player for Gwar.</P>
<P>Long story short, Nesmith persuades his fictional crew to join him as he
battles genuine evil in outer space.  Of course, they're clueless, since
they have no real knowledge of space travel or interplanetary war.  But
that's what makes the film funny.  Screenwriters Robert Gordon (Addicted
to Love) and David Howard don't let one space cliché go unused, and
director Dean Parisot shows some promise after last year's abysmal mess,
Home Fries.  Allen does a super Shatner, and the others do a great job
of acting jealous of his fame.  Since the cast shares jokes and
one-liners, the film seems to be more balanced than you would expect
from a silly space comedy.</P>
<P>1:49 - PG for some action violence, mild language and some adult
situations</P>
