<PRE>                                THE ROCK
                       A film review by Steve Kong
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>Many men have died behind enemy lines, and the US Government has chosen to 
forget them.  Well, this has to stop now, and General Francis X Hummel (Ed 
Harris) will do this.</P>
<P>Hummel along with a small group of Marines have taken over Alcatraz, and taken 
81 hostages.  The rescue of the hostages would be easy if not for the batch of 
rockets that the General has pointed at the San Francisco Bay Area.  The 
rockets aren't standard rockets either.  They are armed with the highly lethal 
VX gas.</P>
<P>The Pentagon has two solutions.  One is to bomb the island with bombs that 
will incinerate the deadly VX gas upon contact.  But this solution will also 
take the lives of all the hostages.  The second solution is to attempt a 
nighttime raid on the island with a small group of Navy Seals.  But no one 
knows how to get into the fortress island.  Except for the only man to ever 
escape the island, John Patrick Mason (Sean Connery).  Mason is imprisoned for 
stealing government secrets 30 years ago.  And if they get into the fortress 
island, can they disable the rockets?  Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage) is a 
chemical expert who specializes in deadly gases such as the VX gas.  Mason is 
let out of prison to help the SEAL team get on the island.  Goodspeed is going 
to the island to disable the rockets.</P>
<P>The driving force behind Goodspeed to disable all the rockets is the knowledge 
that his pregnant fiancee (the beautiful Vanessa Marcil) has flown into San 
Francisco and is now in danger of being killed.  Mason also has a driving 
force, and that is his daughter, for which he has met once in only 30 years, 
is also in San Francisco.  Hummel wants to get the attention of the US 
Government with one final try, and get them to honor the men that he has lost 
in his covert operations.</P>
<P>The Rock is a shined and polished action movie directed by Michael Bay (Bad 
Boys).  The movie takes no risks in trying to be original, what Bay does is 
polish everything and make the movie shine.  The actions consist of 
fistfights, car chases, guns fights, and people hanging from precarious 
places.  But what might sound like an increasingly boring string of action 
sequences turns out to be a roller coaster ride of action.  This is the case 
only because of the heavy camera work and heavy quick editing.  I admit the 
story is a little thin, but it is enough to create the background and push for 
all of the action.</P>
<P>Though the story is more or less a standard action driven type, the characters 
are not the typical characters.  Ed Harris' Hummel is not the typical 
wide-eyed crazy man who has his finger on a big red button ready to kill 
millions.  He has a conscious.  As an example, early on in the movie, before 
he takes the island hostage, he tells a class of children to get on a boat and 
off the island right away.  Cage's Goodspeed is not some 
hotshot-straight-firing tough FBI field agent.  Instead he is a self-described 
"chemical superfreak."  He is the character that goes through the most change 
through the movie.  Connery's Mason is a great character, but probably the 
weakest of the trio.  Other characters and actors that are worth mentioning 
are Vanessa Marcil, in her first big budget film, as Goodspeed's pregnant 
fiancee.  William Forsythe as Paxton a FBI agent.  And last, but not least, 
David Morse who gives a great performance as Major Tom Baxtor.</P>
<P>Mason and Goodspeed share most of their screen time together, often saving 
each other's life.  Their relationship on screen also makes for some funny 
scenes.  And it is with these types of scenes that make the movie stick 
together.  There is balance between action and humor.  Whenever I felt that 
the action was just about to wear me out, something humorous kicks in and I'm 
ready for more.</P>
<P>I only have one small complaint about The Rock.  That is the heavy camera work 
that I mentioned before.  Most of it works very well, but then there are times 
where it is just overused.  This is most evident in the car chase through the 
streets of San Francisco.  Though the sequence is the most enjoyable car chase 
sequence I've seen in a long while, it is marred by the hyper-kinetic camera 
work.</P>
<P>The Rock is an adrenaline rush, and should be seen no matter what.  The Rock 
is on my most watched and most loved film lists.  It is no Shakespeare, but it 
is two hours of pour entertainment.  So, go see it and get ready to be rocked.</P>
