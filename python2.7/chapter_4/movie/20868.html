"Love who you are and fight for the right to be the imperfect you," is a
seriously wholesome theme smack in the center of this quirky Australian
straight-faced comedy.</P>
<P>A tow-truck driver loves his paneled pool room and pre-fab house despite the
747's thundering overhead. But when the airport decides to expand the runway
and buy out the neighborhood, this man (as optimistic as he is average)
stands in the way.</P>
<P>Narrated by his third son, a character who ironically has nothing to do with
the plot, "The Castle" is a live action "Wallace and Grommet" without the
Grommet (and action for that matter). But it is full of dry and subtle humor
simultaneously ribbing and admiring the rural blue collar middle class. "I'm
going to take the Coronado, so if you can move the Mustang and the Duster, I
can get it out of the driveway -- and don't sideswipe the Torino."</P>
<P>Fine performances by all involved. "The Castle" is not a blockbuster; it's a
little film that accomplished everything it set out to do.</P>
<P>Starring Michael Caton, Anne Tenney, Stephen Curry, Sophie Lee, Anthony
Simcoe and Charles Tingwell.
Directed by Rob Stitch. Written by Santo Cilauro, Tom Gleisner, Jane Kennedy
and Rob Stitch (in 11 days I'm told).
Produced by Debra Choate.
Presented by Miramax/Village Roadshow/Working Dog.</P>
