       FAST, CHEAP & OUT OF CONTROL
       --------------------------------------------------------------
                                                            GRADE: A</PRE>
<PRE>       "A chair has four legs. Now, an animal has a one-track-mind,"
       circus trainer Dave Hoover explains, describing his reduction
       of a furious lion to a big, befuddled cat just by waving a
       chair at it. "This agitates him. He can't comprehend those
       four points of interest."</PRE>
<P>       "I've been told by several people, 'You're old fashioned. You
       want to do everything by hand,'" topiary gardener George
       Mendonca complains, defending his continued resort to hand
       shears in trimming his intricately privet-sculpted animal
       creations. "This is the only way you can do it and do it
       right." Snip, snip.</P>
<PRE>       "Some people believe that we are gonna replace ourselves by
       building these machines, and that may be," muses MIT robot
       scientist Rodney Brooks, who builds robots that run on
       instinct. "There may not be a place for humans in the future,
       if we're really successful."</PRE>
<PRE>       "You feel that there's a  and
       looking directly into Errol Morris's camera. "I know you are.
       You know I am."</PRE>
<P>       In some ways the slickest film yet from nonfiction auteur
       Morris (THE THIN BLUE LINE, A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME), FAST,
       CHEAP & OUT OF CONTROL is reportage of the highest order.
       Journalism students should dream of making connections like
       these. Cross-cutting among interviews and filmed segments,
       Morris traces the lives of four disparate professionals who
       seem to share nothing but an immersion in their work, and
       then threads them around one another in an intricate
       quadruple helix. The fun is settling into your theater seat
       and wondering just what the hell one story can possibly have
       to do with the other. What Morris manages is something akin
       to an intellectual magic trick, an interrogative sleight of
       hand.</P>
<P>       One of the things that feels different about an Errol Morris
       documentary -- besides the always-striking visuals -- is the
       interview style, where subjects seem to look directly at the
       viewer. Weary of pressing his cheek against the camera lens
       to get this effect during conversations, Morris developed an
       elaborate double-camera gadget he calls, half-jokingly, the
       Interrotron. Through a rig that uses a pair of teleprompters
       to project video images of the interviewer for the subject
       and vice versa, these folks talk, startlingly, right to the
       camera -- to the video image of Morris, and by extension to
       the audience.</P>
<P>       The gardener wonders whether, after his death, anyone will be
       interested in maintaining the garden that he's devoted half
       his life to tending. The robot scientist is more than a
       little pleased to note that his creations may be primal
       examples of what an insect or even an animal is -- a
       complicated set of sensory receptors. The mole rat specialist
       is delighted to catalog the ways in which these vermin
       animals behave like insects, and notes that they may be more
       suited to long-term survival than people. And the circus
       trainer pines for a long-lost ideal that was exemplified by
       world-renowned trainer and showman Clyde Beatty, who starred
       in such serials as ZOMBIES OF THE STRATOSPHERE (excerpted at
       some length here, with affection).</P>
<P>       Starting to detect the patterns? FAST, CHEAP & OUT OF CONTROL
       contains a multitude of parallels and tiny intersections,
       culminating in what feels like an elegy (the film is
       dedicated to Morris's late mother and stepfather). The film
       is balanced on that airy precipice dividing the already musty
       past from the alternately exhilarating and terrifying space
       that is the future. (The title is taken from Brooks' wish
       that NASA would send a payload of hundreds of expendable
       robots to scurry about the Martian surface, creating a sort
       of road map for the terrain -- fast, cheap, and out of
       control.)</P>
<P>       With able assists from editors Karen Schmeer and Shondra
       Merrill and cinematographer Robert Richardson (Oliver Stone's
       longtime collaborator), this becomes a cinematic contraption
       that's a wonder of narrative divergence and coherence.
       (Further enhancing the picture's wacky intellectual mood is
       the playful score by Alloy Orchestra founder Caleb Sampson.)
       Different story threads inform and comment on one another
       with the serene inscrutability of a Kieslowski film, or a
       surrealist dream. By cobbling together out of these motley
       musings a thesis on the nature of craftsmanship, invention,
       and existence itself, Morris reveals the presence of cosmic
       themes -- creation, evolution, death -- in earthbound lives.
       At the same time, and just as significantly, he pays tribute
       to a consuming passion for one's work. This breakdown of the
       dichotomy between the everyday and the extraordinary is
       likely as profound as anything you'll encounter in pop
       culture this year, and the visuals cry out for the big
       screen. Don't miss it.
