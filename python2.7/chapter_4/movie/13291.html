<P>Entering a teenage girl's bedroom, a group of renegade toy soldiers spot 
her collection of Barbie-style dolls on the shelf. "Ooooh, fully poseable,
" leers one of the plastic warriors, "Permission for R&R, sir!" </P>
<P>Based solely on its trailers, "Small Soldiers" has been dismissed by some 
as a "Toy Story" rip-off, but they're mistaken. Actually, it's a 
"Gremlins" rip-off, directed by Joe Dante, who also helmed both of the 
"Gremlin" films. Packed with comic mayhem and loads of pop culture 
references, "Small Soldiers" is enjoyable lightweight summer fare, 
despite its threadbare storyline and anemic characters.</P>
<P>Set in the same beatific small town where all the people in Steven 
Spielberg productions live, "Small Soldiers" deals with action figures 
run amuck. Implanted with computer chips pirated from the military, two 
groups of toys go to war, with the Commando Elite soldiers determined to 
eradicate the peaceful Gorgonites, and any humans who help them.  </P>
<P>It's a simple, but cute concept that pays off with some big laughs, 
although the finished product doesn't live up to its potential, due to a 
number of poor choices from the filmmakers. </P>
<P>The human cast is painfully bland, just another group of sit-com 
stereotypes. There's the bumbling teen hero, his preoccupied father and 
ineffectual mother, the beautiful girl next door, her boobish parents, 
etc., etc. They're all sketchy as can be, making it difficult to care 
when they get in trouble. Only the late, greatly missed Phil Hartman 
makes any impression, adding what bite he can as the neighbor girl's 
loutish dad. </P>
<P>Okay, since we don't care about the humans, what about the toys? Here's 
where things really get odd. The appeal of a film like "Small Soldiers" 
comes from the wish-fulfillment notion of seeing the toy soldier battles 
we staged as children come to life, but it doesn't play out quite the way 
you might expect. </P>
<P>The Commando Elite soldiers are actually the bad guys, little military 
psychopaths out to defeat the enemy at all costs. And the Gorgonites, 
monster action figures with peaceful hearts, have been pre-programmed by 
the toymakers as timid losers. Their characters are sympathetic and 
appealing, but we don't get a chance to know them, because their 
programming ordains that they stay out of sight as much as possible. </P>
<P>Why would a toymaker program one of its armies to lose? I certainly have 
no idea. Why would Joe Dante make a film without sympathetic characters? 
Now, that one's easy. It's because Dante is far more interested in satire 
and mayhem than in people. As with both of the "Gremlin" films, he loves 
to fixate on funny, nasty little monsters, while whipping up colorful 
ways to destroy them. </P>
<P>Ultimately, comic mayhem is all that "Small Soldiers" delivers. 
Thankfully, Dante is pretty good at it. He uses the Commando Elite 
soldiers to send up countless war movie stereotypes. Look for satiric 
nods at everything from "Apocalypse Now" to "The Dirty Dozen." </P>
<P>Speaking of the "Dirty Dozen," don't be surprised if you get a strong 
sense of deja vu, as several veterans of the 1967 World War II flick turn 
up here. Ernest Borgnine provides the voice of Commando Kip Killagin, 
with Jim Brown as Butch Meathook, George Kennedy as Brick Bazooka and 
Bruce Dern as Link Static. Tommy Lee Jones heads the troops as leader 
Chip Hazard.</P>
<P>Keep your ears peeled for another mini-reunion, with "Spinal Tap" stars 
Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer providing voices for 
the Gorgonites. Frank Langella plays Archer, the spokesman for the gentle 
monsters.</P>
<P>"Small Soldiers" virtually bursts at the seams with pop culture 
references. Standing over a fallen comrade, leader Chip Hazard solemnly 
intones, "his battery has died, but his memory keeps going and going and 
going." A doorbell rings the key notes from "Close Encounters of the 
Third Kind," one of several nods to executive producer Steven Spielberg. 
Dante even makes references to his own work, with "Gizmo" turning up as 
an online password.</P>
<P>Seamlessly blending computer graphics with live action footage, the film 
has a number of well-done set pieces. Particularly striking is a creepy 
sequence where the Commandos fit the neighbor girl's "Gwendy" dolls with 
computer chips, leading to a nightmarish Barbie-goes-berserk scene where 
the young woman finds herself under attack from her own dolls. "Let's 
give her a makeover," says one psycho-Gwendy ominously, while another 
horribly mutilated doll coos "Don't hate me because I'm beautiful."</P>
<P>There's a lot of clever moments in "Small Soldiers," but ultimately the 
film still feels like a warmed-over "Gremlins." Joe Dante has a real 
knack for cartoonish sadism and light satire, but he's covered this turf 
before. Had the human characters been less bland, or the Gorgonites less 
timid, they might have provided the spark to ignite this story's 
potential. As it is, "Small Soldiers" is another sterile summertime 
trifle, frenetic, funny and quickly forgettable.</P>
