<P>The first three months of 1998 have been a textbook exercise in the
effect of star power on major American motion pictures: DESPERATE
MEASURES (Andy Garcia, Michael Keaton), SPHERE (Dustin Hoffman, Sharon
Stone, Samuel Jackson), and PRIMARY COLORS (John Travolta, Emma
Thompson, Billy Bob Thornton) are all good examples of otherwise weak
movies turned into average or better fare. There is no denying the fact
that audiences will see a movie simply for the principals in it. While
THE NEWTON BOYS follows this trend to a certain level, its four
headliners - some of today's best up-and-coming actors - do not account
for the entirety of its liveliness. </P>
<P>Rather, the script is peppered with fun-loving, aw-shucks humor that
grows on the audience. The story is set in a day that no movie-goer
today is old enough to have lived in, and hence derives a sort of
romanticism that works towards its advantage. The story is also highly
unused. It's been a good while since a down-home, all-American bank
robbers story has been told. The most recent film of similar value is
the Laurence Fishburne starrer HOODLUM, but the racial, social, and
political overtones of that 1930s film seem drab in comparison. There is
little that this 1920s recreation lacks, and every bit of it plays to
the public's image of the Old West. </P>
<P>The characters, too, are bright and colorful, although not all of them
are used to the film's fullest advantage. Matthew McConaughey and Ethan
Hawke are the top names here, starring as Willis and Jess Newton. They,
along with their brothers Doc and Joe (Vincent D'Onofrio and Skeet
Ulrich), are America's most successful bank robbers. Their heists are
meticulously planned and skillfully executed, resulting in their take of
several hundred thousand dollars. However, when technological advances
in the construction of safes and lockboxes make their conventional
methods impossible, they turn towards a more daring - and more lucrative
- mail train robbery. If completed, the resulting payoff of several
million dollars will set them up for life. </P>
<P>Even by today's standards, the Newton boys' ambitions are quite high.
This, of course, drags the audience in, for who doesn't like to see a
perfectly planned robbery go off without a hitch? Unfortunately, the
scenes after the train robbery take too long to play out. The movie has
reached such a full head of steam that when the movie doesn't wind down
quickly the audience becomes bored and loses interest. Other than that,
THE NEWTON BOYS is a movie that's full of color and ambition, most of
which pays off. This is a worthwhile film, especially compared to other
movies now playing. </P>
<P>FINAL AWARD FOR "THE NEWTON BOYS": 3.0 stars - a good movie.</P>
