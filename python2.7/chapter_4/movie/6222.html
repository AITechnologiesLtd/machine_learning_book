                         American Buffalo (1996)
                      A film review by Dave Cowen
                       Copyright 1996 Dave Cowen</PRE>
<P>The last two films by David Mamet, GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS and OLEANNA, have both
had titles that seem to have little to do with the plot at hand, but are 
instead obscure or cunning references.  That's why, upon watching AMERICAN 
BUFFALO, I was very surprised to see that most of the movie's plot and events
are given away by the title.  The word buffalo doesn't just have meaning 
as a noun, but also a more obscure meaning as a verb, to loosely describe 
the process of trying to butt one's way into a situation to keep a person from
acheiving their goals or desires.</P>
<P>The three central characters of AMERICAN BUFFALO, Don (Dennis Franz), Teach 
(Dustin Hoffman) and Bobby (Sean Nelson) play havok with each other's lives
in the fashion outlined above.  Don owns an antique shop that seems to have
quite a bit of stock but little that is saleable.  Teach seems down and out,
griping about a relationship and spending his day at Don's.  Bobby is a young
boy who hangs out at Don's shop to make some cash.  The three form allegiances
between each other which change rapidly: Don could be defending the actions 
of Bobby one minute, and then scorning him the other... with Teach switching
from being critical to being supportive of the young boy in the same amount
of time.  The film takes a slice of one day in the life of these three, as a 
plan to steal an American buffalo nickel develops, sours, and does each of 
the three a lot more harm to each of them than good. </P>
<P>Of the three actors who make up AMERICAN BUFFALO, only Dennis Franz seems 
comfortable with Mamet's fragmented, repetitive dialogue.  Franz plays Don
with conviction, and the viewer is able to understand his motivations when
aligning himself either with or against the Teach and Bobby characters. 
Dustin Hoffman overplays Teach to a ridiculous degree, often giving Mamet's
dialogue a kind of oratory bravado that destroys the rhythm of the text,
and Sean Nelson seems confused not only as to the motivations of the 
character of Bobby, but also as to the rythym of the dialogue.</P>
<P>Despite the surprisingly poor acting, AMERICAN BUFFALO is still of value.
Mamet's plays are fun-house mirrors of real-life confrontations, distorting 
the way we speak and the way we act into hyper, inarticulate overblown 
battles of misunderstanding: the way men struggle to desperately keep control 
of a situation they're in is exaggerated in a Mamet script but ultimately 
based in reality.  The character of Teach speaks with a sense of dogma, as if 
everthing he says is absolutely correct even when the logic is frayed, 
and Bobby comes off as threatening or confusing even when he's acting with
the best of intentions, traits which serve to mean more in a confrontation 
than facts or evidence.  Mamet's stories are the perfect glimpse into 
seemingly petty arguments which develop into life or death struggles -- 
similar to the worst of the arguments that occur in real life -- and the 
consequences of the way that men and women deliberately mislead each other to 
gain control of power, or wealth, or money.  It's a pity that AMERICAN BUFFALO 
wasn't able to explore these issues without a brand of acting which buffalos 
the message of the film as much as the three characters buffalo each other.</P>
