<P>Juliette Binoche, perhaps the most unlikely (and most undeserving) Best
Actress nominee in recent memory, does a full 180° with her latest film, The
Widow of Saint-Pierre.  In the dazzlingly overrated Chocolat, Binoche played
Vianne, a woman with some serious man issues.  She was always either running
away from the opposite sex, or helping other women to do the same. But in
Widow, her character is a firm believer than even the most vile man can
change under the right circumstances.</P>
<P>Binoche plays Pauline, a resident of tiny Dog Island off the coast of
Newfoundland, which was a French territory at the time the film is set
(1849).  She's married to a Parisian man named Jean (Daniel Auteuil, Girl on
the Bridge), who is referred to simply as The Captain by the rest of the
island's crusty inhabitants.  Note: In case you're unfamiliar with French
cinema, the presence of Binoche and Auteuil in the same film is a little
like seeing Brad and Julia in The Mexican.</P>
<P>One morning, the residents of Dog Island awake to a grisly scene.  It seems
the evening before, two fishermen cut up their boss to settle a drunken
argument (one thought the man was fat, and the other merely big).  The town,
of course, is outraged, the men are quickly tried, and the Powers That Be
declare the man who did the cutting should lose his head, while his cohort
is sentenced to a life of hard labor (he dies shortly after transport).</P>
<P>The problem is that Dog Island has neither an executioner nor the means to
perform an execution.  They order a guillotine from Paris, but it won't
arrive until the following spring.  In the meantime, Pauline decides the
surviving prisoner, Ariel Neel Auguste (played by the great Yugoslavian
filmmaker Emir Kusturica), should be rehabilitated.  She excuses his drunken
actions, letting Auguste live in her house and help her with her greenhouse.
Pauline even gives him intimate reading lessons, and none of it seems to
bother Jean, who seems to like his horse even more than his wife.  Does
Pauline have tingly feelings for Auguste, or is she just another left-wing
crybaby?</P>
<P>When spring finally rolls around and the guillotine arrives, Dog Island has
become quite attached to their wonderful prisoner, at which point Widow
becomes kind of a preachy, anti-death-penalty film.  If somebody wanted to
watch one of those, they'd rent The Chamber (and judging from its box office
take, nobody does).  Claude Faraldo's script just isn't that interesting,
especially compared to director Patrice Leconte's last film, the wonderfully
original Girl on the Bridge (Leconte is becoming the John Sayles of France,
picking drastically different projects each time around). The highlight here
is the lovely photography from Eduardo Serra (Unbreakable).</P>
<P>Binoche is nearly good enough to make you forget how ridiculous Chocolat
was, and Auteuil clocks in with another typically strong and stoic
performance.  Kusturica does well, especially for a first-time actor (he
recently directed the arthouse hit Black Cat, White Cat).  As an aside,
Widow is the first of two imports we'll see this year that show prisoners
being rehabilitated through gardening.  The other, due this summer, is
called Greenfingers and stars Croupier's Clive Owen as a convict with a
green thumb.</P>
<P>1:52 - R for a scene of sexuality and brief violence</P>
