<PRE>                             THE RICH MAN'S WIFE
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     There are a couple of rules inherent to the thriller that any
filmmaker should be aware of.  First, you have to keep the pace moving
so fast that the audience doesn't have time to think about whodunit. 
And second, if you kill off most of the cast, whoever's left alive at
the end of the movie is the one who did the killing.</P>
<P>     THE RICH MAN'S WIFE blindly ignores both of these rules, but still
manages to float, thanks to a united effort by an exceptional cast and
exquisite production values.  Amy Holden Jones directs her own
screenplay here, a modern-day reworking of Hitchcock's masterful
STRANGERS ON A TRAIN.</P>
<P>     Hitch's story revolved around a man who took a joke too far -- an
offer to kill the other's wife.  This time, it's wife Josie (Halle
Berry) kills ultra-rich husband Tony (Christopher McDonald) with the aid
of friendly sociopath Cole (Peter Greene).  Jones also throws in some
interesting twists about Josie's forlorn lover Jake (Clive Owen) and his
ex-wife Nora (Clea Lewis from TV's "Ellen") -- the latter who all but
steals the show.</P>
<P>     But the main problem is that despite a tight 100 minute running
time, Jones's pacing is slower than a Yugo headed uphill, primarily
because there's not a lot of story filler off the main path of the film
(this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just doesn't work right here). 
The other problem is that none of the characters in the film are very
good at being criminals; leaving mile-wide trails for the cops.  (Then
again, this may or may not have been intentional.  Whatever the case,
they're really slow about it.)  This lethargy left me restless during
much of the movie, but it works to great effect when Jones finally revs
into action phase...</P>
<P>     Any time a gun comes out on screen, watch it, because sparks are
about to fly.  The confrontation between Tony and Cole is a powerhouse
of a cat & mouse sequence which almost makes the film worth seeing on
its own.  Jones also uses the mixed-race marriage of Josie and Tony to
explore (on a very limited scale) some of the racial dynamics of their
situation and of society in general.</P>
<P>     The bottom line is that everyone in the film could have stood a
shot of adrenaline, but by the time it's over, the thriller will have
captured the minds of most of its audience.  After all, patience is a
virtue, right?</P>
<P>     P.S. My biggest complaint -- while you find out *who* did it, you
never really find out *how*.  If any of my readers figure it out, please
drop me a line and let me hear your theory.</P>
