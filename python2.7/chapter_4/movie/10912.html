<P>     They're back, and this time they're not on a mission from God.  
Strictly speaking, however, only one of the original Blues Brothers has 
returned -- Dan Aykroyd's Elwood.  His partner, Jake (played by the late 
John Belushi), died in prison, so now it's up to the survivor to find a 
new lead singer, re-form the group, hit the road, run from the police, 
and end up in a band competition to end all band competitions.  Any 
similarities between the sequel and its classic inspiration are entirely 
intentional.  In fact, in many ways, BLUES BROTHERS 2000 is as much a 
remake as it is a follow-up.  The familiar elements are certainly all 
there. </P>
<P>     The difference between the two Blues Brothers movies can be summed 
up simply:  the original 1980 release worked as a musical and a comedy; 
the 1998 installment functions as a musical masquerading as a comedy.  
That is to say, the songs are still great fun, but the level of humor 
has dropped off considerably.  BLUES BROTHERS 2000 is rarely funny.  
Fortunately, after a rather tedious first half-hour, the music kicks 
into high gear, and that gives the film enough energy to bulldoze over 
its numerous shortcomings.  BLUES BROTHERS 2000 isn't anywhere close to 
the landmark its predecessor was, but it's still enjoyable.</P>
<P>     BLUES BROTHERS 2000 appears to have set out with two primary 
objectives:  re-create the feel of the first movie and crash even more 
cars.  The colossal smash-up sequence in BLUES BROTHERS 2000 not only 
tops anything in the original, but it garners the picture's biggest 
laughs.  It's an amazing piece of over-the-top entertainment, and proves 
that director John Landis (who also helmed THE BLUES BROTHERS) is still 
capable of creating a cinematic moment with an edge.</P>
<P>     This time around, there are four men in black.  Aykroyd plays 
Elwood much the same as he did eighteen years ago.  In fact, with the 
hat, suit, and sunglasses covering up the most obvious signs of aging, 
it's hard to believe that so much time has passed.  Taking over for John 
Belushi is John Goodman as the surprisingly timid Mighty Mack.  
Initially, this role was earmarked for Jim Belushi, but scheduling 
conflicts prevented him from appearing.  Joe Morton joins the group as a 
cop who undergoes a conversion to the blues.  Then there's ten-year old 
Buster (played by J. Evan Bonifant), who specializes in stealing scenes.</P>
<P>     If the tag line in the original was "We're on a mission from God," 
this time it's "The Lord works in mysterious ways."  Many members of the 
supporting cast have returned, including Aretha Franklin, James Brown, 
Kathleen Freeman (as Sister Mary Stigmata), Frank Oz, Steve Lawrence, 
and the members of the band.  As expected, there's a powerful lineup of 
guest performers.  The roster numbers about two dozen, half of whom 
appear as members of the Louisiana Gator Boys, the band that challenges 
the Blues Brothers during the film's goosepimple-generating musical 
finale.  Familiar faces (and voices) include Eric Clapton, B.B. King, 
Isaac Hayes, Bo Diddley, Dr. John, Erykah Badu, Lou Rawls, Travis Tritt, 
Jonny Lang, Grover Washington Jr., Steve Winwood, Wilson Pickett, and 
Junior Wells.  (Apologies to those I have forgotten -- and there are a 
lot.)  Playing everything from familiar standards to new songs, BLUES 
BROTHERS 2000 has something for viewers of almost any musical persuasion 
(standout numbers include "How Blue Can You Get" and "New Orleans").  On 
more than one occasion, it's hard to keep from at least tapping a foot.</P>
<P>     BLUES BROTHERS 2000 is the kind of movie that needs to be seen with 
an audience to be fully appreciated.  Almost like a live concert, the 
energy of the viewers adds to the atmosphere.  The experience wouldn't 
be nearly the same alone, at home, on video.  The film also has the good 
sense to build to something, leaving the dullest, least-invigorating 
elements for the first two reels.  By the time the end credits arrive, 
the production is on a roll.  And it's nice to see film makers come up 
with a way to keep most members of the audience in their seats until the 
house lights go on.  In the final analysis, despite the cries of 
"sacrilege" by some BLUES BROTHERS and SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE (where the 
Belushi/Aykroyd act started) die-hards, BLUES BROTHERS 2000 represents a 
respectable follow-up to a uniquely American classic.</P>
