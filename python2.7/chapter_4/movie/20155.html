<P>The notion that television is corrupt and that it corrupts minds is as old as
the invention of television itself. There have been a plethora of films
concentrating on this technological theme from the classic "Network" to the
recent successor "Wag the Dog." Both films are indictments against the idea
that television is the medium containing the message. "The Truman Show" is a
startlingly original, comically engaging portrait of a world where the medium
is not only the message, but it encapsulates an entire town. </P>
<P>Rubber-faced clown Jim Carrey plays Truman Burbank, an insurance salesman who
has a beautiful, almost too beaming wife (Laura Linney) whom he says good-bye
to before leaving for work. Every morning, Truman is greeted by his neighbors
and the townspeople to whom he responds with the catch phrase "Good morning.
Good evening, and good night." This Connecticut-style town where Truman lives
is Seahaven, a polished, "Father Knows Best" community completely and yet not
so completely removed from reality. It is reminiscent of a huge shopping mall
where there's no traffic, no noise, and no problems - everything is picture
perfect. Before you can whisper "The Stepford Wives," we gradually discover
(before Truman does) that nothing is what it seems. Apparently, Truman is the
unknowing star of a 24-hour television program where he is the main attraction
(and has been since birth), and his home in Seahaven is actually a giant,
dome-like television studio! To make matters worse, he is the star of the
biggest hit on television. </P>
<P>The film's idea is like something out of "The Twilight Zone," but writer Andrew
Niccol fleshes out this story with care and humanity, as in a Ray Bradbury
novel. What could have been a one-joke premise becomes a deep, philosophical,
unusually poignant film. The humanity emanates from Jim Carrey's uncanny
Everyman character affected by the very people in his life - his mother who
reminds him of an ersatz Mount Rushmore vacation, his wife who may or may not
be a nurse and always wears a red sweater, his best friend (Noah Emmerich) who
brings a six-pack along every time Truman has a problem, a former girlfriend
(Natasha McElhone) hauled away by her father never to be seen again, and the
general townsfolk who try to put him in front of advertisements hung in the
town square. Truman's whole life is a fabrication - a lie for the sake of
entertaining millions of viewers on television, and the TV cameras are at every
corner of Truman's existence documenting his daily life. </P>
<P>Jim Carrey is in super tip-top form here playing the bewildered Truman with
admirable restraint and complete assuredness. Don't expect fart jokes or
scatological humor of the "Ace Ventura" kind here; this is Carrey's first
dramatic role and he does wonders with it. At every turn, he suggests and
implies Truman's innocence, even when Truman starts to get suspicious about his
surroundings. It is a role Charlie Chaplin could have played with the same
degree of panache and heartbreak. My favorite scene is when Truman has an
argument with his wife and notices that she is addressing someone other than
himself when she utters:</P>
<PRE>        'How about trying some delicious Mocha Hot Chocolate?'</PRE>
<PRE>        Truman's response: 'What the hell are you talking about?' </PRE>
<P>And before I forget, there's the crucial role played by Ed Harris, who excels
like no other actor from movie to movie, and here he is at his unqualified best
as Cristof, the God-like creator of the show who barks orders such as "Cue the
sun!" or "Bring out the rain! Make the thunder louder!" Harris's final moments
where he discloses Truman's life, from his birth to his childhood memories, is
deeply touching and as emotionally discreet as this actor has ever been on
screen. </P>
<P>"The Truman Show" is directed by Peter Weir ("The Last Wave," "Dead Poet's
Society") and he does a remarkably acute job of showing the world Truman
occupies which is not that different from what America is now becoming - a
Rockwellian nightmare where everyone pretends to be what they aren't. If Truman
is not real in his own eyes because of the part he unknowingly plays on
television, then who is he? </P>
