<PRE>THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>If you ever find yourself in a simulated world, don't tell the natives.
It can be very upsetting to learn that your flesh and blood is just a
stream of bits on someone's computer.</P>
<P>Opening with the "I think, therefore I am" quote of Descartes, Josef
Rusnak's THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR serves notice that this is a pretentious
movie.  Indeed, the script by Josef Rusnak and Ravel Centeno-Rodriguez,
based on Daniel F. Galouye's novel "Simulacron 3," does a masterful job
of setting up a plot with an intriguing premise.  With shades of THE
TRUMAN SHOW and THE MATRIX, the movie takes so much risk that it is a
shame that about its only memorable parts are the cinematography and the
set decoration.</P>
<P>A billion dollar software company lead by Hammond Fuller (Armin
Mueller-Stahl) has just finished creating the ultimate virtual reality
system.  Fuller's company, housed in a large building, appears to have
only 2 employees, a pair of programmers named Douglas Hall (Craig
Bierko) and Whitney (Vincent D'Onofrio).  All 3 characters have
counterparts in the simulated world that their system creates.</P>
<P>The present is a hazy, neon blue world filled with bright laser beams,
ominous skyscrapers and dark supercomputers.  The simulated past is set
in a handsome 1937.  Colored in hazy sepia tones, this attractive world
features showgirls that dance the night away to big bands.  The sets in
the past are art deco masterpieces.  Between the two, the choice is
easy; go for the inviting past.</P>
<P>As the story opens, Fuller is in the past but quickly makes his way back
to the present, where he is murdered.  A scruffy, black cop, Detective
Larry McBain (Dennis Haysbert), dressed in classic film noir garb, tries
to investigate this multiple-reality murder.  Complicating his
investigation is the appearance of a woman named Jane Fuller (Gretchen
Mol), who claims to be the daughter of the dead man.  Since Hammond
Fuller had no known relatives, this confuses everyone.</P>
<P>As the mystery deepens, the story has our two software designers getting
on and off the laser light table that transports them between
timeframes.</P>
<P>The film's coldly antiseptic present matches all too perfectly the style
of the acting.  None of the characters has any warmth or genuineness.</P>
<P>The screenplay has so many logical holes and out-of-left-field events
that you're liable to end up snickering at it, as our audience did.  And
suspension of disbelief is a prerequisite.  If you're a grownup and have
never been out of town, take this as a sign that something may not be
quite right in your world.</P>
<P>Still, for all of its flaws, the story possesses a strange fascination,
and you're unlikely to be bored.  "You can't just plug your brain into
this machine and not be affected by it," Jane says.  Watching this movie
is like that.  It becomes more intriguing that it has any right to be,
given its limitations.</P>
<P>If you want a good science fiction film, then this frustrating one may
not be the one for you.  On the other hand, if it's a good-looking
science fiction film you're after, then look no further.  THE THIRTEENTH
FLOOR is exquisite eye-candy for the sci-fi set.</P>
<P>THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR runs 2:00.  It is rated R for violence and some
profanity and would be fine for teenagers.</P>
