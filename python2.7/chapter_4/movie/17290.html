<P>PLANET SICK-BOY:  <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Warner Bros.' second serious foray into the animation market is just as
ineffective as its first (the anemic The Quest for Camelot).  Here, they
hack about forty-five minutes off of the popular 1956 Rodgers &
Hammerstein musical starring Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner, who reprised
his Broadway role and nabbed the Oscar.  And, believe me, you'll be
thankful for every minute that's missing.</P>
<P>The story is the same as it always was – Anna (voiced by Miranda
Richardson, Merlin) is a widowed English schoolteacher who travels to
Siam to teach the children of its overprotective and strong-handed
King.  She butts heads with His Holiness almost immediately and must
also deal with the obligatory evil cartoon guy who wants to dethrone the
existing King and rule the country as he deems fit.  This guy also has
magical powers, at one point conjuring up a dragon to attack Anna's boat
before her arrival.  Luckily, Anna is able to fend the serpent of with
her amazing power of song.</P>
<P>The King is as empty as Paul McCartney's stomach at an all-you-can-eat
ribs festival.  The animation is horribly jerky and the evil guy's comic
sidekick (voiced by Saturday Night Live's Darrell Hammond) is downright
offensive – unless all Asian men are really short, stupid, bald, and
have both rotting teeth and bad accents.  And the songs – don't get me
started on the songs.  You'll probably be better off waiting for the
real remake – not of the musical, but of the 1946 Oscar winner featuring
Rex Harrison and Irene Dunne – which will star Jodie Foster as the
British governess and Hong Kong action legend Chow Yun-Fat (The
Corruptor) as the King.  (G – 1:28 for mild violence and the possibly
offensive portrayal of the entire Asian race)</P>
