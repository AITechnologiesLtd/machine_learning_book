<PRE>                                12 MONKEYS
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>     If you are of the school of thought that movies like medicine can
only be good if they are painful to endure, then do I have a movie for
you, TWELVE MONKEYS.  It is a dark, depressing and ugly science fiction
mystery involving time travel and schizophrenia.  It is a movie that is
about as much fun to watch as getting your teeth pulled, and yet the
mystery is so compelling that your mind will not let your feet walk out
of the theater early no matter how hard they try.</P>
<P>     When the movie opens, it is the 21st century.  As any Hollywood
writer will tell you, in the next century we are all going to revert to
acting like animals and our technology will be more like the past than
the present plus most of the equipment will be covered in grime.
Screenwriters David and Janet Peoples's script based on another one by
Chris Marker tells of a future that is full of angry and mean people.
It goes on to show a present and past that is equally mean spirited.
In a set by Jeffrey Beecroft that is a cross between BRAZIL and ALIENS
3, we find a filthy and ugly world.  In this movie the sets for the
present and the past are equally sinister and morose.</P>
<P>     It seems that in 1996 someone, believed to be "the army of the
twelve monkeys", unleashed a virus on the world that killed ninety-nine
percent of the humans on the planet.  The few survivors went
underground, and the surface thereafter became inhabited only by wild
animals.  James Cole (Bruce Willis) is a prisoner who is picked out of
his tiny cage by a crane and sent first to the surface in the present
and later to the past to uncover hints as to exactly what the original
virus was so that the 21st century scientists can get a clue as to how
to make an antidote.</P>
<P>     The 21st century scientists use old fashion devices more
mechanical than electrical, and their time machine is not very
accurate.  First, James is sent by mistake to 1990 and then to the
French trenches in World War I.  Eventually they get it right, and he
lands in 1996 right before the virus is unleashed.</P>
<P>     Since the people in 1990 think he is schizophrenic and is making
all this future plague and pestilence stuff up, he is sent to a mental
institution where he meets fellow patient Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt).
Jeffrey is the son of a famous virologist named Dr. Leland Goines
(Christopher Plummer).  Jeffrey is most certainly nuts, and James
begins to think that he is too and that he is making it all up in his
mind.  While at the hospital he meets and forms a relationship with his
psychiatrist, Dr.  Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe).  Since the mystery
is the only thing good about this disgusting but innovative show, I
will not describe the plot more.  Suffice it to say that it is
convoluted, and there is lots of it.</P>
<P>     The cinematography (Roger Pratt) is full of dark grays and
contrasting bright white lights to create a somber and desolate feel.
The sets in the past, present, and future are all depressing and
apocalyptic.  James's make-up has him extremely bloody and full of
scars, and he drools constantly.  His keepers kept him high on drugs so
he spends most of the movie, not only dripping blood and drooling, but
also stoned out of his mind.  I found the bleak and lugubrious images
of the show infectious.  As I left the theater, I felt terrible -
hopeless and depressed.</P>
<P>     Director Terry Gilliam puts a strong stamp on a movie.  I loved
his BRAZIL, but hated his THE FISHER KING.  Although I was intrigued by
the TWELVE MONKEYS story, I was angry at myself for not having the good
sense to walk out of it.  Many times I started to leave since I was not
enjoying myself at all and was finding the images painful to endure,
but I kept wanting to know the resolution of the mystery, which I must
admit is wrapped up nicely.</P>
<P>     Besides the intriguing plot, there is some good acting even if the
movie is pretty unbearable.  Brad Pitt proved to me that he is more
than just a pretty face.  Willis, whom I frequently dislike, is quite
good, but hard to watch.  Stowe, whom I always like, is good and is one
of the few characters in this movie that you not only like, but
actually care about.</P>
<P>     TWELVE MONKEYS runs way too long for my taste at 2:09.  It is
correctly rated R for gore and violence and a vision of the world that
could give you nightmares for a long time.  There is male nudity, but
no sex.  Do not let teenagers see this show unless they are quite
mature.  This is an ugly film that I wish I had never seen, and I
certainly would not wish it inflicted on others.  I am giving it a
single * for some good acting and an intriguing mystery.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
