<P>   In "The Merchant of Venice," Shakespeare conveys his
feeling about song:</P>
<P> "The man that hath no music in himself,
 Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
 Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils."</P>
<P>   The playwright might have had no one in mind.  I've never
met a soul who disliked all music, have you?  We differ
greatly, however in our tastes. During the 1980s when the
chic crowd went with the beat of disco and hard rock, one
unique troupe emerged, led a man whose special sound
might best be called funk, or perhaps avant-punk.  David
Byrne, whose band of four--expanded in concerts to nine--
electrified his followers with a more intellectual inflection than
that found in, say, the performances of Mick Jagger of the
Rolling Stones.  His lyrics are filled with irony. His band was
"The Talking Heads," and perhaps the great irony in the
movie made in 1983 about his group is that Jonathan
Demme's documentary is anything but a talking heads piece. 
There are no backstage interviews with the musicians, no
conferences with his third-grade teachers.  In fact we get to
know nothing about the man except what we glean from his
work, which is just the way a film of this sort should be.  </P>
<P>   "Stop Making Sense"--whose title comes from a verse in
the group's song "Girlfriend is Better"--is a film put together
from three evening concerts of the Talking Heads staged in
Hollywood's Pantages Theatre in December 1983.  While the
three concerts have been superbly edited to give the
impression of a single night's delirium, director Demme
deliberately subverts traditional thinking by avoiding the usual
MTV jerky-camera style.  Using six fixed cameras together
with one hand-held and another for pans, Demme focuses in
on the principal's face when he spots particularly eccentric
expressions, panning to Mr. Byrne's crotch when the man
does his own rendition of Elvis's pelvic thrusts.  For the most
part, though, we in the audience cannot help feeling that we
are present at the actual, live event, digging the music
without the ambiance-destroying breaks that musicians 
frequently take.  We sit back and listen to one hit after
another, and given that this 1999 remake of the work on its
15th anniversary has been redigitalized to be played in
theaters with improved sonic systems, we essentially hear
purer sounds than did the lucky folks in Hollywood during the
historic festival of funk.</P>
<P>   If this gives you the impression that I'm a fan of David
Byrne's music, you'd have the wrong notion.  My taste is
fairly eclectic, from Bach to acid rock, and the particular niche
filled uniquely by the Talking Heads does not dazzle and
hypnotize me or even knock my eyeballs out--as reviewer
Chris Morris virtually guaranteed it would in his October 1984
interview with Byrne.  We'll leave the judgments of music to
the music critics. As a film, however, Demme's craftsmanship
pays off mightily, perhaps the best movie of its kind since
Martin Scorsese's 1976 "The Last Waltz," whose performers
included Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, and Muddy Waters. 
Leonard Maltin calls Demme's creation "one of the great rock
movies ever made," citing its conception, editing and
performance.  </P>
<P>   What fascinates me about Byrne is that he is the antithesis
of what you'd expect from a lead musician.  One reviewer put
it best by calling Byrne a black man's send-up of a white-
bread singer. Not that Byrne is another Eddie Fisher.  He's
tall and gaunt, with a mop of black hair cut in the most
traditional of styles.  He wears an open-collar shirt--nothing
flamboyant in the costume, nothing that would make you
think he's anything but a nice young man who escorts old
ladies across the street and studies hard for his CPA.  When
he stolls onto the stage just after Demme's portentous image
of a guitar's shadow, he says to his audience simply, "I've got
a tape to play for you."  There he stands, alone on a
minimalist platform, putting a small machine on the floor to
the knowing chuckles of an audience that has yet to become
wildly enthusiastic.  Warming up by strumming the beats of
his first song, the witty and ironic "Psycho Killer," he is joined
first by one, then another, and finally by all nine members of
his integrated band.  </P>
<P>   Those not already familiar with his style may wonder what
he's getting at when he moves across the stage, not in the
exaggerated flamboyant style of Mick Jagger but in the
spastic, nervous movements of a paranoid perpetrator who
has just made off with the loot from the small local bank.  As
the minutes roll on, the entire band becomes seized with an
almost other-worldly energy, its leader falling back, flat on his
back like a turned-over turtle eager to right himself, belting
out the avant-punk melodies as securely as though he were
planted firmly on the ground.  While Byrne has the modesty
on stage to allow each member of his troupe to get his or her
minute or so of fame, there is never a question about who is
the leader.  Only once does Byrne take a break, giving the
rest of the group its head to perform in a comic style which
does not quite come off.  We are eager for the man's return.</P>
<P>   As a physical force, Byrne is Elvis with variety.  Not only
does his pelvis undulate.  As the mood strikes, he indulges in
aerobic dancing, at one point waving his arms like The
Golden Cockerel and at another pacing about the stage like
Big Bird.  Jonathan Demme's lighting designer has a ball
aiming his beam at one point just under Byrne's chin, giving
the effect of a schoolboy trying to scare his classmates on
Halloween Eve.  The comic highlight of the night displays the
singer in a suit tailored for a man at least twice his size at
which point he knocks out the gospel-influenced "Take Me To
The River.</P>
<P>  Byrne's presence is a commanding one, his charisma
carrying over to his group, which consists of a drummer, a
few female singers, a bass player, all of whom caught up in
the syncopation as though they had just arrived from Kansas
and were experience the thrill for the first time.  Would I want
to see the movie again?  I couldn't say I would.  For all the
glories of the cinematography, for all the energy emitted by
the artists, for all the genuine enthusiasm of the audience, I
simply am not a fan of this unique type of euphony.  Byrne
found a niche amid the clutter of styles prevalent in the world
since the sixties, capitalizing on his special niche with a
particular audience.  Whether his sort of audience exists
today will have to wait until mid-September when the 15th
anniversal revival is re-introduced to a changed America. 
Whatever you think of the music, though, you've got to hand
it to director Demme for not falling into the trap of so many
documentarians who talk their subjects to death.</P>
