Susan Granger's review of "ARLINGTON ROAD" (Sony Pictures/Screen Gems Release)</P>
<P>  This contemporary thriller stars Jeff Bridges as a college
professor whose FBI-agent wife was killed in a botched raid on an
alleged right-wing cult. The film was scheduled to open in May,
shortly after the Columbine High School massacre in Littleton,
Colorado. With its tagline, "Fear thy neighbor," its release was
understandably postponed. The theme revolves around how everyday
appearances can be deceiving. This concept is personified by a
seemingly normal, all-American couple - Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack -
who move with their three children into a suburban Washington,
D.C. neighborhood.  Gradually, Bridges, who teaches a course in
terrorism, senses something suspicious about them. Is he just paranoid
or are they part of a lethal, para-military conspiracy?  "There's no
gratuitous violence," Bridges says, "but it does deal with a violent
subject, with militia groups - and how some people express unhappiness
toward the government and their own lives. Certainly, I would hope it
doesn't lead to copycat crimes. However, it's a tough subject: whether
the arts reflect society or lead society. I don't know if we want to
put restrictions on creativity, but, at the same time, we certainly do
not want to inspire people to do violence." Writer Ehren Kruger and
director Mark Pellington are obviously manipulative as they explore
this volatile subject with a stylish scenario that leads to a grim,
uncompromising, over-the-top conclusion. Both Cusack and Robbins seem
to relish their intriguing, intimidating roles with an evil glee, and
Jeff Bridges delivers a solid performance as the tormented widower who
becomes a pawn in their plot to dismantle American society.  On the
Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Arlington Road" is a sinister, scary
6, making you skeptical about anyone's safety. It delivers a chilling
shiver on a hot summer's night.</P>
