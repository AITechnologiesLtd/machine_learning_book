"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>In 1998, first-time filmmaker Darren Aronofsky set the entertainment
industry on its ear when his $60,000 ? took the Director's Award at the
Sundance Film Festival.  The grainy 8mm black-and-white film, which was
about a super-genius mathematician who found a 216-digit pattern in the
world that could both predict the stock market and reveal the true name
of God, jettisoned Aronofsky into the upper echelon of young, hip and
talented directors ready to be seduced and corrupted by the Hollywood
system (he's supposed to be making the next Batman installment).</P>
<P>The temptation to make a bigger and better film must have been
incredible.  Imagine having a budget nearly 100 times larger, as well as
the ability to cast well-known acting talent as opposed to friends and
family.  The result is Requiem For a Dream, a frighteningly dark look at
addictions in modern society.  It's a good film, and it's certainly
bigger than ?, but unfortunately, it's just not better.</P>
<P>The film is set in present-day New York City near Coney Island, where a
middle-aged mother and her junkie son regularly square off over the
television set.  Harry (Jared Leto, American Psycho) keeps taking the
appliance to a pawnshop to support his heroin addiction.  Sara (Ellen
Burstyn, Playing by Heart) is tired of buying her set back from the same
pawnbroker.</P>
<P>Harry's friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans, Scary Movie) and girlfriend Marion
(Jennifer Connelly, television's The $treet) are hopheads as well.  They
figure out a way to make a bunch of money from a really big drug score,
but their plan goes awry.  Like big drug scores ever go down correctly
in the movies.</P>
<P>In the meantime, Sara is just as addicted to television as her son is to
smack.  Sara particularly loves this one game show, and her life is
thrown into disarray when she receives a phone call telling her that
she's been chosen to be a contestant.  She dyes her hair and digs out a
flashy red dress that can no longer be completely zipped.  Long story
short, Sara ends up strung out on prescription diet pills, thanks to an
unscrupulous doctor.</P>
<P>So you've got four characters hopped up on various chemicals.  Can the
gifted Aronofsky capably handle hallucination scenes?  Oh, Lord, yes.
They're the slickest since Trainspotting (although they aren't set to
Lou Reed and Iggy Pop songs).  Aronofsky uses so many different filming
techniques (split-screen, fish-eye lenses, altered playback speeds,
scene repetition and even cameras strapped to his actors) that Requiem
often feels like an all-out assault on the senses (but in a much better
way than, say, Armageddon).  Don't attempt to adjust the picture.
Turning around and heaving popcorn at the projection booth won't stop
Requiem from damaging your tender eyes.</P>
<P>Actingwise, Requiem is a one-man show.  Burstyn is incredible as the
tormented Sara.  If she fails to get an Oscar nomination, there should
be rioting in the streets.  She should get the award for one scene
alone, where she's simultaneously being hypnotized by the television and
chased by the refrigerator.  Interestingly enough, October is a banner
month for the 67-year-old actress.  In addition to knocking them dead in
Requiem, she's lighting up the box office with the re-release of The
Exorcist, and stars in That's Life, one of the better-reviewed
television shows debuting this fall.</P>
<P>On the other side of the acting coin are Leto and Connelly.  Although
they're both pretty easy on the eyes, their talent remains very much in
question.  Connelly's greatest asset is widely believed to be her chest,
which is usually more prominently displayed than her acting chops.  Leto
tries out a New York accent here, but mainly just offers more of the
same blank stares that made him so popular as the dim-witted Jordan
Catalano on My So-Called Life.  Guess what, kids?  He wasn't acting.
How does a guy with talent this marginal keep getting cast in cool, edgy
films, like American Psycho, Fight Club and The Thin Red Line?  Wayans
is nearly unrecognizable as Tyrone, but that's probably because it's his
first role where he isn't acting like a retard.</P>
<P>The plot isn't much to write home about.  Most people already know that
a drug addiction can do a pretty good job of messing up your life
without having cinema cramming a similar message down their throats.
Requiem is based on a novel written by Hubert Selby, Jr. (he also wrote
the book that became Last Exit to Brooklyn) and adapted for the screen
by Aronofsky and Selby.  The story follows four characters to ? ‘s one,
and Aronofsky seems to have a bit of trouble with the pacing of the film
because of it.  But just when it seems like Requiem is about to derail,
the director tosses in an unexplainably cool, repetitive clip of the
three kids cooking up their stuff and getting bent.</P>
<P>Requiem was photographed by Matthew Libatique (Pi) and edited by Jay
Rabinowitz (Ghost Dog), the latter of whom is probably deserving of some
year-end accolades, as well.  The film contains one of the more sexually
explicit scenes you'll see in a mainstream film (featuring – surprise! –
Ms. Connelly).  This one is definitely not for the kids, the faint of
heart, or people who suffer from epilepsy.</P>
<P>1:42 – Not rated, but contains nudity, strong sexual content, adult
language and violence</P>
