<PRE>AN IDEAL HUSBAND
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>"To love one's self is the beginning of a lifelong romance," Lord Arthur
Goring tells his butler (Peter Vaughan) in AN IDEAL HUSBAND.  Arthur is
played in a dazzling performance by Rupert Everett from MY BEST FRIEND'S
WEDDING.</P>
<P>"Do you always understand what you say?" Arthur's father (John Wood)
asks Arthur later in the story.  "If I listen attentively," he replies.</P>
<P>Writer and director Oliver Parker's richly sardonic AN IDEAL HUSBAND is
a brilliant and biting adaptation of the classic Oscar Wilde play.
Thoroughly entertaining, the film moves from one scene of deliciously
subtle humor to another.  When you're not laughing out loud, you'll be
grinning from ear to ear.</P>
<P>When we meet Arthur, he is starting another hard day in the life of the
rich and famous.  Having his breakfast in bed, he complains of the
pressures before him.  "Busy day today," he tells his butler.
"Distressing little time for sloth or idleness."  Oscar Wilde is a
master of self-deprecating humor and saying what everyone thinks but
wouldn't dare say.</P>
<P>This comedy of manners and misadventures has been adapted before.  In
1969, the BBC, for example, did a fine production starring Jeremy Brett
and Susan Hampshire.  Yet, none of the previous attempts had an ensemble
cast like this one, which is filled with many big name actors and
previous Oscar nominees.</P>
<P>Jeremy Northam, so brilliant in THE WINSLOW BOY, plays Sir Robert
Chiltern, the character in the center of the story's storm.  It seems
that this wealthy Member of Parliament may have obtained his initial
financial nest egg through less than honest means, or so thinks Mrs.
Laura Cheveley, who tries to blackmail him.  As the wonderfully wicked
Mrs. Cheveley, Julianne Moore (BOOGIE NIGHTS) shows evil in every curl
of her devilishly disarming smile.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH's Cate Blanchett plays Lady Gertrud Chiltern, Sir Robert's
naively loyal wife.  Whenever she and Robert's friend Arthur are in
close proximity, small sparks are detectable from a previous, smoldering
relationship of theirs.  Arthur, the film's playboy, was once engaged to
Mrs. Cheveley, albeit only for three weeks.</P>
<P>To complete this complicated love pentagon, GOOD WILL HUNTING's Minnie
Driver plays Robert's sister, Mabel, who also has eyes for Robert, and
vice versa.  Driver demonstrates considerable talent in the movie as the
master of the reaction shot.  When other characters deliver some of
their best lines, she ends up stealing the scene with her facial
responses.</P>
<P>The picture's look is a joy to behold.  The sumptuous mansions are
filmed in the lush tones of dark English oak paneling.  The men, who
dress in tails with cream-colored vests and ties and tall black, top
hats, manage to outshine the women in their finery.</P>
<P>"Morality is simply the attitude that we adopt to those whom we
dislike," Arthur lectures Gertrud.  The entire movie is peppered with
such aphorisms, which puts the audience through a delightful cycle of
laughing, thinking, and then laughing again. AN IDEAL HUSBAND is a treat
for the heart, the mind and the funny bone.</P>
<P>AN IDEAL HUSBAND runs a fast 1:36. It is rated PG-13 for brief
sensuality and distant nudity. Although there isn't anything to offend
anyone, a child would probably have to be at least 11 to be interested.</P>
