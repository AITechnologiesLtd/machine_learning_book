<PRE>                                 HACKERS
                       A film review by Joan Ellis
                    Copyright 1996 Nebbadoon Syndicate</PRE>
<P>"Hackers" is a landmark movie that has not an ounce of
artistic merit. You will see the worst performance by an actress
in recent memory (Lorraine Bracco as Margo), and you will suffer
a group of unpleasant teenage cretins, who turn, undeservedly,
into unsavory heroes. With an uninteresting script and no plot to
speak of, the movie is one long MTV video set in a computer-
generated landscape.  </P>
<P>Since you will probably not see this film unless you are
sentenced to it, you may wonder why anyone would bother to review
it. It's simple: As grotesque as it is, the film is an
announcement that computer power is passing from nerds to cool
guys, that juvenile hackers are taking over white-collar crime as
surely as street gangs stole neighborhoods. 'Bad Kid' movies have
a way of becoming reality.</P>
<P>Using professional I.D.s like "Zero Cool" and "Razor," this
particular group of young criminals, obsessed with planting
viruses and stealing information, becomes distracted from
everyday crime by an in-house corporate theft that involves Swiss
bank accounts and the possibility of the destruction of oil
tankers, but don't be mislead into thinking these are the
elements of a plot. </P>
<P>Dade (Jonny Lee Lee Miller) and Kate (Angelina Jolie, in the
single worthy performance), initially seen as petty on-line
thieves, are finally anointed as saviors of the corporation and
the tankers. But the mantle of hero is a very bad fit on these
spoiled, self-indulgent, slovenly, lazy, unsocialized creeps. </P>
<P>Dressed in various shades of contempo-chic, these
unattractive, wild-eyed high school kids argue over french fries
and ride their roller blades through computerized circuit boards
that morph into cities as fast as a mouse can click. </P>
<P>Pulling floppy disks from their pockets as crisply as street
kids pull guns, the hackers know that their ability to manipulate
information will allow them to tamper with the infrastructure and
security of the country. The ability to create havoc is a far
headier experience for them than the sex, drugs, or alcohol that
fueled kid cultures of the past. As a path to power, the laptop
makes guns seem almost quaint. </P>
<P>As bad as it is, the movie is a real echo of the headlines
that have trumpeted the first convictions of hackers who have
already broken into bank accounts and vital statistics. It is not
a stretch to imagine what they could do to airborne planes and
military orders. </P>
<P>As a landmark, this very bad movie is probably the first
drop from a ruptured pipe that will become a torrent of movies
about the ingenious ways criminals devise to upset society in an
explosion of computer crime. </P>
<P>Let's hope some towering figures emerge to lead the film
parade that will chronicle this new turf. May they have in their
human brains the imagination and talent to create suspense and
strong characters who move through good plots. May they also be
wise enough to hire good actors.  </P>
