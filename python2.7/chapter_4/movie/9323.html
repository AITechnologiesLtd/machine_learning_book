<PRE>Wishmaster      
Review by Larry McGillicuddy

<P>** (out of 4)
Directed by Robert Kurtzman
Starring Tammy Lauren, Andrew Divoff, Jenny O'Hara, Robert Englund</P>
<P>The success of movies like From Dusk Till Dawn, The Craft, and especially 
Scream have revived the once dead horror genre. Movies that for the past 
few years have been released by companies like Full Moon entertainment 
are now getting released to theaters. Wishmaster (I refuse to attach 
Craven's name to this) is a current and annoying example of this recent 
trend. Unfortunately, the very flaws that killed this genre in the late 
80's are evident in this movie.</P>
<P>Wishmaster tells the story of a Djinn, an evil genie who must receive 
three wishes from the person who awakens him to conquer the world. He has 
magical powers, but can only utilize them if someone makes a wish. The 
movie begins in medieval times, where a Djinn grants an unwise wish to a 
King and makes a mess of a party in his castle. The king's magician 
advises against a 3rd wish and is able to trap the Djinn in a gemstone.</P>
<P>Flash forward to the present. An art dealer is receiving a shipment of a 
statue. There is an accident however, as the crate comes loose and 
crushes someone underneath. Guess what gem is found in the wreckage?</P>
<P>The gem is taken to a local gemologist (Lauren) for an appraisal, and 
guess who she wakes up? The Djinn escapes during an examination by her 
colleague and longtime friend, who is of course killed.</P>
<P>The Djinn then promptly goes searching around for the gemologist who 
awakened him, so he can receive his 3 wishes. During this, he tricks 
several unexpected victims into making some very unwise wishes. The best 
moments of the film come here, when the film shows the creative ways in 
which the victims are conned.</P>
<P>There is some good material here that could've worked in the hands of a 
talented director. Unfortunately, the direcotrial chores were given to 
Kurtzman, a former makeup and FX artist who was more interested in 
showing us how creative he is with gory makeup and special effects than 
suspenseful sequences with horrific payoffs. The movie turns out to be a 
freak show, as Kurtzman seems to be pissed off he didn't get the Freddy 
vs. Jason job (which unfortunately also went to a makeup/FX guy). I don't 
mind much gore in my horror movies, but this movie goes way too far over 
the top several times.</P>
<P>Tammy Lauren is a very weak and uninspired lead. She doesn't even know 
how to scream right for this kind of movie. Her ineptness kills several 
moments. However, Andrew Divoff (who has a very cool voice) is very 
effective as the Djinn, and veteran character actress Jenny O'Hara plays 
the part of a kooky theater director and expert on Djinn's on the perfect 
note of wide-eyed oddity. </P>
<P>My advice to Kurtzman: Watch Halloween and Psycho. Look at how much gore 
is in those movies. Look how scary and suspenseful each of them are. 
Learn how to direct a movie. then get back to me.</P>
