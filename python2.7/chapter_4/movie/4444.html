<PRE>                                 LE CHEVRE
                       A film review by Edwin Jahiel
                        Copyright 1995 Edwin Jahiel</PRE>
<PRE>(France, 1981)
Original comedy-farce made by Francis Veber.</PRE>
<P>     The accident-prone daughter of a Parisian tycoon disappears in
Mexico.  Police investigations and those of private eye Gerard
Depardieu fail.  The psychologist of the father's firm suggests sending
back Depardieu with Pierre Richard, a bumbling, klutzy accountant even
more accident-prone than the missing girl.</P>
<P>     The kooky theory is the variant of "set a thief to catch a thief."
It works, but not before a steady series of gags and incidents, some
hilarious and imaginative, all well-timed.  The teaming of the
searchers is inspired.  Richard, in top form, is comically insufferable
as he believes that he is Depardieu's boss.  His stubborn,
absent-minded naivete gets him into impossible situations.  Suffering
Depardieu shows again a genuine talent for farce, but in a different
vein, infinitely more restrained than his outrageous playing in
provocative sex comedies.</P>
<P>     Although comic French cinema does not have the standing of the Big
Three productions (America, England and Italy), for a commercial
product by a non-auteur filmmaker this film is inventive and
fast-paced enough to stand comparison with non-French "comedies
loufoques"(crewball comedies).</P>
<P>     The title means "the goat," like a goat set as wolf-bait.  The
film has excellent subtitles.  It was also written by Francis Veber
who holds a record for Hollywood remakes of his movies.  The remakes
are all inferior to the originals.  Among them Veber's THE TALL BLONDE
MAN WITH ONE BLACK SHOE (also starring Pierre Richard) remade into a
weak comedy with Tom Hanks, THE MAN WITH ONE RED SHOE.  Ten years
after LE CHEVRE came out it was redone as PURE LUCK.  The picture
was directed by Australian Nadia Tass, starred Martin Short and Danny
Glover.  It was awful.</P>
