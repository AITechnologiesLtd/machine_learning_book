<PRE>                                  ORLANDO
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1993 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  This is a critically acclaimed
     adaptation of the novel by Virginia Woolf, but while it is
     visually beautiful, the story is empty.  This is a story
     about someone who has lived for ten times my age through
     fascinating periods of history--lived for some period as a
     man and some as a woman--yet who seems to have learned
     nothing beyond the superficial and has none but the blandest
     insights to share.  Rating: 0 (-4 to +4).</P>
<P>     It has been said that youth is wasted on the wrong people.  In ORLANDO
we see eternal youth wasted on absolutely the wrong person.  We are led to
believe that Orlando is immortal due to a promise he made to Queen Elizabeth
that he would remain forever young, and his later conversion to a female is
due to some unknown mystical process (perhaps similar to the process Gregor
Samsa encountered).  Actually, this film supports the interpretation that
Orlando is so slightly invested in living at all that s/he never uses up the
life he was born with.  Orlando is barely alive at all, much less male or
female, so shifting from one to the other seems hardly surprising.  Tilda
Swinton manages this feat of seeming barely alive with a face that is
drained of color and nearly impassive.  Her reactions are entirely performed
by widening or narrowing her eyes while leaving the rest of her face
deadpan--the same acting technique that Bud Cort used in much of HAROLD AND
MAUDE.  In face, it can be an effective technique that leaves the audience
to read their own interpretation into the expression.</P>
<P>     The story is, of course, that the handsome Orlando is a favorite of a
near-death Elizabeth I.  The aging queen is played by Quentin Crisp in what
is apparently a casting pun.  In short episodes Orlando has an ill-fated
love affair with a visiting Russian noblewoman and an ambassadorship to
someplace in Central Asia.  He then falls into a coma and wakes up a woman.
"Same person; no difference at all, just a different sex," she tells the
audience after having almost no reaction to her gender flip-flop.  It does,
however, raise her consciousness on women's issues.  I will not ruin the
story and tell how it ends except to say it is not really a story, nor does
it have an end.  It does, however, take Orlando to a time in the 1990s--or
certainly in the last quarter of this century--must require some license in
adapting Virginia Woolf's 1928 novel.</P>
<P>     ORLANDO is a novel adaptation for the 1990s.  The visual imagery far
outstrips the plot.  The film has superb camerawork and terrific costume
designs.  Tilda Swinton is often upstaged by her own clothing, which is as
over-stated as her performance is under-stated.  The film is really not a
lot more than a series of historical tableaux.  It is like walking through a
museum of British dress of the last four centuries.</P>
<P>     This film has been very popular with critics, and perhaps I was looking
for another film, but the absurdity of the story bothered me.  Not the
fantasy premise of the deathless person moving through the ages or even the
changing of sex, but for the idea that Orlando could have lived so long and
apparently remained so vapid and lacking in insight.  This is apparently a
person who takes a long, long, long time to learn anything.  Twice she is in
love relationships.  They are very parallel relationships, or even the same
relationship, that she goes through once as a man and once as a woman.  Yet
there is no sign that she recognizes the situation and she says nothing
insightful about it at all.</P>
<P>     ORLANDO is a short ninety-three minutes.  Some scenes seem to go on too
long and when it is over one feels that not much has happened.  When it was
over I had the distinct feeling that neither I nor Orlando had learned much
from the extraordinary experience.  I rate this one a 0 on the -4 to +4
scale.</P>
