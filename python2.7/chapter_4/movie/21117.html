<PRE>Double Jeopardy (R) ***
Starring Ashley Judd, Tommy Lee Jones
Directed by Bruce Beresford
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Now as much as I like independent movies, you know, all those movies that
feature plausible storylines and actual ideas, I couldn't help liking this
movie. Now this didn't just start with the movie, the first time I saw the
trailer with Wild Wild West I was excited about it. While not legally accurate,
this fun idea of a woman being framed and then trying to track down the man
that framed her instantly caught my attention. This is no original film, mind
you, but it is a whole lot of fun.</P>
<P>Libby Parsons (Judd, destined to become a great actress) is thrilled when her
husband buys her a new sailboat, she loves it of course, and after a romantic
evening they go to bed. But when she awakens she finds blood all over
everything, and she finds a bloody knife on the deck, and picks it up right
when the coastguard is coming to arrest her. Nick, (Bruce Greenwood) her
husband, left her $2 million in insurance money, the jury sees this as a motive
for killing him and she is put in prison.</P>
<P>It turns out Nick isn't dead at all, he's kidnapped her son and is now living
in San Francisco with her best friend. But then someone gives her a holiday
present, it's called double jeopardy. It says that any person cannot be brought
to justice on the same crime twice. While this is not actually legally
accurate, the crime would have to be commited in the same location for it to be
legal, it's a great set up and the film has fun with it. When she's put on
parole and commits a crime, her parole officer (Lee Jones) must track her down
as she tries to kill the man that framed her. This begins a thrilling chase
through the Mardi Gras season in New Orleans.</P>
<P>Double Jeopardy is too unbelieveable, even for a Hollywood film. Seriously,
anyone who fires a gun that close to themselves (I'm making a point without
giving away any plot points) would be deaf for the rest of the movie. But if
you can push aside anything you know about law you should have a good time.
Tommy Lee Jones doesn't do much for the film, and actually doesn't have that
big of a role. Ashley Judd is great as Libby, an excellent casting choice, now
if only there was a way to make a sequel. Fun, exciting, and suspenseful,
Double Jeopardy gets *** stars.</P>
<P>The Young-Uns: Lots of tension, suspense, and gunfire plus a sex scene that
doesn't show much nudity. Good Age 14 & Up</P>
