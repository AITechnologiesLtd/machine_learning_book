<PRE>Believe him or not
The Talented Mr. Ripley</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>As the title appears on screen, the word "Talented" arrives only after
shuffling tentatively through a series of other fitting words: passionate,
confused, misunderstood, lost, etc. Telling insight into Ripley's character.</P>
<P>A powerfully strong first act, Ripley (Damon) is commissioned by a rich
American shipbuilder to persuade Dickie (his aloof son) to return home from
Italy. Ripley a master of impersonation, forgery, lying, and the piano
becomes so fatally seduced by the lavish lifestyle with this obsession
extending to Dickie (Jude Law) that his original mission is abandoned at
sea. But when Dickie doesn't share Ripley's jubilance over this new found
relationship -- well, the film takes an ugly murderous twist from which it
never recovers.</P>
<P>Having arrived early to the screening, I took a peaceful stroll in a nearby
park where I came across an unusually shaped tree. Leaning nearly 45 degrees
into the path, it seemed to cut back 90 degrees in the opposite direction.
But further inspection revealed that the tree had been cut to avoid blocking
the path. What I had thought to be the trunk was actually just a very thick
branch, elbowing from its grossly severed trunk. I had no idea this was some
freakish foreshadowing for a movie I was soon to screen. "Ripley" builds at
an interestingly artful angle, takes a lethal twist, then just keeps going;
no peak, no climax, no resolution.</P>
<P>That said, the acting, dialogue, direction and cinematography are fantastic.
I've not seen Damon stronger. And Jude Law is absolutely stunning, he fills
the Dickie character with magnificent fervor. Paltrow is nothing less than
convincing as a fine cast of actors front exacting direction (spectacular
really) and warm wonderful cinematography faulted only slightly with its use
of a soft focus filter that I found distracting. The film's seldom-surfacing
sinister sense of humor is also delightful.</P>
<P>But like Ripley and his mission, this gorgeous film sabotages the bizarre
journey it originally offered -- only to become a serial account of
psychosis, betrayal and murder.</P>
