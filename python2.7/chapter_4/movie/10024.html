<PRE>RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (1980)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Mike Watson
Copyright 1997 Mike Watson</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: 5 out of 5</PRE>
<P>You know what most adventure films ultimately lack?  A sense of
wonder, that's what.  But RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK is an utterly
delightful exception.  Not to say that this is a deeply philosophical
film.  Hell no!  But it does possess something that adventure films
often strive for but rarely achieve: a real sense of the mystical.</P>
<P>Archaeologist Indiana Jones' quest to beat the Nazis in the search for
the fabled Ark Of The Covenant is certainly a pretty intriguing
premise.  Still, in less inspired hands such a story could easily have
fallen prey to limp writing and empty spectacle.  Luckily for us, the
team of writer George Lucas and director Steven Speilberg have created
such cracking good action sequences and invested the film with such a
sense of awe and mystery that RAIDERS is able to stand alongside the
most thrilling Hollywood movies ever made. </P>
<P>Of course, the other vital components of a great action film are also
in place: solid storytelling, colourful characters, spicy romance, and
exotic mid-Eastern locales, topped off with some very convincing - and
horrifying - special effects.  Oh, and a terrific sense of humour.
One short sequence about mid-way through when Jones is confronted by a
showy sabre-wielding bad guy is a bonafide all-time classic sight gag.
If by chance you haven't yet seen it, you're guaranteed a belly laugh.</P>
<P>Although RAIDERS is based on the old Saturday-afternoon matinees of
the 30's & 40's, it doesn't date the film one iota.  Indeed, Karen
Allen's strong, gutsy female lead is very much an exception in action
films.  Not for her the stupid, passive damsel-in-distress of years
gone by.  Nor of sequels to come, I might add: witness Kate Capshaw's
unbearable hysterics in the follow-up TEMPLE OF DOOM.  As Indiana
Jones, Harrison Ford is more the traditional action hero, but what a
hero he makes. </P>
<P>A nod must also go to composer John Williamson for his near-perfect
score, particularly that haunting minor-chord theme which appears
right on cue at the most awe-inspiring moments.  And the film is
beautifully photographed by Douglas Slocombe, so if you're seeing it
on video, the widescreen version is a must.</P>
<P>RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK is absolutely terrific American filmmaking,
worth seeing again and again as an example of Hollywood at its most
inspired.  A massive box office success, and richly deserved. </P>
