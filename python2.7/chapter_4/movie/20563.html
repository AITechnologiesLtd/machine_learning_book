<P>While exiting the theater after a recent showing of Outside Providence,
I heard this remark from a fellow audience patron: `Well, it was no
There's Something About Mary... but I liked it.' Of course it's no
There's Something About Mary. Comparing this to Mary would be a mistake,
because where that film is filled with outrageous sight gags and various
bodily fluids, Outside Providence is sweet and genuinely funny. It may
be co-written by the Farrelly brothers, but this is an earlier effort
that reveals a softer side. At least, softer than their previous
directorial efforts (also including the gross-out comedies Dumb and
Dumber and Kingpin).</P>
<P>70's nostalgia seems to be popping up often at the cinema lately, with
Dick and then Detroit Rock City appearing amongst the late summer movie
crowd. This entry features Shawn Hatosy (who recently fought alien
administrators in The Faculty) as Tim Dunphy, a trouble-making pot head
from Rhode Island. Tim is always involved in wrong-doings with his
friends (well, what does it tell you when his best chum is named Drugs
Delaney??). On this occasion, he runs into a parked police car, most
likely due to his impaired vision from a vehicle full of billowing
smoke. His father (Alec Baldwin) finally draws the line, and sends him
to a prep school named Cornwall Academy. This is the type of place that
forbids everything that Tim usually takes part in, namely smoking and
drinking.</P>
<P>Outside Providence is the kind of movie that, while not achieving
anything groundbreaking, has you leaving the theater with a smile
plastered across your face. The main protagonist is easily likable, and
the material is reasonably well-written. Those expecting another
`outrageous' comedy in the tradition of Mary should perhaps tread
elsewhere - the down-to-earth realism in this film may leave them
slightly disappointed. But, that's not to say Outside Providence isn't
funny. There are some great comic moments, captured perfectly in time by
director Michael Corrente (American Buffalo) and the Farrelly's nicely
paced screenplay.</P>
<P>The performances are also impressive. Hatosy doesn't have to work hard
to achieve a certain charm, and Alec Baldwin is wonderful. Playing a
poker-faced widower who sits around in his underwear eating ice cream,
Baldwin is delightfully convincing, and without putting an unnecessary
spin on his character. He plays it straight, fitting the character
requirements nicely (he's also got an interesting nickname for his
son...). As his poker buddy, Cheers veteran George Wendt is solid, and
Amy Smart displays all the charisma and vibrance needed for an adequate
romantic interest.</P>
<P>There is some moralizing going on beneath it's core, but the film
handles everything surprisingly naturally. Certain important issues are
dealt with, including (but not limited to) the loss of Tim's mother and
a member of the poker group coming out of the closet. There is also
plenty of drug use going on, so much, that it almost drains the film's
real purpose. There is nothing special about Outside Providence, which
is what could be described as a change of pace `coming-of-age' story
from the notorious brothers' Farrelly (aka Bobby and Peter). But the
film is entirely enjoyable, and fully equipped with a toe-tappin' 70's
soundtrack that aids the atmosphere nicely.</P>
<P>And those yearning for more classic Farrelly moments (like the widely
popular `hair gel' sequence) still will have a few brief seconds of
redemption. But those most likely to enjoy Outside Providence should be
expecting an honest, well-acted dramedy - a movie with real characters
instead of cardboard cut-outs designed to draw laughs. Yes, it's no
There's Something About Mary. But it remains good-natured fun in it's
own right.</P>
