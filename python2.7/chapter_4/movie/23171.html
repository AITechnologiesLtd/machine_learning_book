<PRE>Ten Million to Kill
The Whole Nine Yards</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>A light-hearted contract killer and nervously pathetic dentist toggle
between teaming up and double crossing each other in this fun and funnier
near-farce comedy. Matthew Perry, playing a part that could have been
written for Jim Carrey, apprehensively stumbles all over himself - but it
works. Perry admits, "I'd do anything for a laugh in this movie." Director
Jonathan Lynn calls him an "Immensely talented clown."</P>
<P>Not a serious bone in its body, the film creates a cast of caricatures that
tangle and tango atop a slightly twisted dance floor. Perry is the wormy
good-hearted dentist that flops over strategically placed ottomans with all
the grace of a young Dick Van Dyke. The innocent-faced Perry even looks like
a dentist - doesn't he? The physical comedy is admittedly cheap - but Perry
pulls it off, he had me laughing every time. Perry's wife, Rosanna Arquette
playing Perry's wife, attempts to portray a French Canadian "ornerian" from
a comedic angle, but fails. Then there's Bruce as the slick contract killer
living next door. Willis is 100% smooth as he walks the fine line between
real person and comic book abstraction. Kevin Pollack's, mob boss's son
character that pronounces "W's" as "V's" falls short, but shoots no holes in
the film. In the end, it's the impeccable timing, pace and one liners that
give "Nine Yards" its zing:</P>
<P>"Have a nice day." Perry wishes his wife.
"I would if you do me a favor and die." She smilingly retorts.</P>
<P>"You like living in Canada?" Willis innocently asks Perry.
"I live here with my wife." Perry responds curtly, as if it were absolutely
obvious that the word "like" could not be used in any context involving his
wife.</P>
<P>After Willis easily intimidates the jittery Perry into momentarily
abandoning a few select body functions, the whimsical Willis grabs his keys,
"Come on, change your pants. We're going out!"</P>
<P>With perhaps the film's finest line betwixt his golden teeth, a
sparkling-eyed Willis savors this gem through a crooked smile, "It doesn't
matter how many people I've killed. What matters is how I treat those who
are still alive."</P>
<P>A price on his head, Chicago gangland contract-killer Willis moves next door
to Perry who's wife forces him to go back to the States to acquire a
"finder's fee" for ratting on the new neighbor. There, Perry meets up with
the huge Michael Clarke Duncan's loving fists and writer Mitchell Kapner's
plotting twists.</P>
<P>A few winceable story progressions in the front and end are easily
outweighed by a fine "body" of fun film in-between. I laughed out loud very
often.</P>
