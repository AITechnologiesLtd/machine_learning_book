<PRE>Review: Very Bad Things</PRE>
<P>Starring: Jon Favreau, Christian Slater, Cameron Diaz, Daniel Stern, Leland Orser, Jeremy Piven</P>
<PRE>Directed by Peter Berg</PRE>
<P>There aren't many films which have such an appropriate title. Very Bad
Things is very telling of what you are going to see if you view this
picture. It starts off pretty bad, then gets VERY bad. Actually, it
gets worse. This is truly an evil picture. I kind of liked it.</P>
<P>Jon Favreau and Cameron Diaz are about to get married. He seems
aimless in life, she is set on only one thing, getting married, and it
doesn't really matter to whom. All she wants is to walk down the
aisle. Try and stop her. Favreau and his buddies head off to Las Vegas
for a rowdy and raunchy batchelor party which includes, among other
things, cocaine, pot, and a strippin' hooker. Once the Jeremy Piven
character accidentally jams her head into a bathroom wall hook while
having wild sex, the madness begins. The film's most despicable
character (Slater) pushes the group to cut her up into itty bitty
pieces and bury her in the desert. "No one knows she's here, I called
her personally," he reasons. Just as the group decides to forego
leagal action, a hotel security guard enters the room and finds them
out. Slater's character takes it upon himself to do away with him
(using nothing but a handy corkscrew). Now they are in deep
doo-doo. So they have two bodies to cut up an bury. Then they have to
"reassemble" the sawed up parts for religious purposes. It is after
this that the film gets nasty.</P>
<P>Yep, Very Bad Things is full of very bad things. In actuality, most of
the gore comes with what I've already told you. But everything that
takes place after that is just evil.</P>
<P>Though there are a few funny moments, Very Bad Things, despite what
you may have read, is NOT very funny. It is the definition of black
comedy. In fact, it may redefine the genre. The film is truly sick,
and snowballs into whatever is past sick. Much of the audience
reaction is nervous laughter. You can't believe what you are seeing,
so you laugh, much like seeing a close up of male genitals caught in a
zipper in There's Something About Mary, or male goo hanging off the
side of someone's face in the same film. It isn't funny in and of
itself, but you certainly aren't expecting it, so you laugh.</P>
<P>Favreau gives a solid performance, despite having a one dimensional
character. Slater is perfectly cast as the worst among a bunch of bad
dudes. Most surprising is Jeremey Piven, who does a great job of going
bonkers as the film progresses. Diaz is wasted in this very small
role. She plays a real bitch with very little character, and one
wonders if she just took the part because she liked the script aside
from her role.</P>
<P>The squeamish should avoid the bathroom dismembering scene. Those that
want a redeeming film, should go see something else. And those who
want to see just how whacked one mind can get (Peter Berg's mind, he
wrote and directed) should definitley see it.</P>
