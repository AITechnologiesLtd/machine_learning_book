<P>QUEST FOR CAMELOT

creativity)

Seidler <HR>"Quest for Camelot" is Warner Bros.' first feature-length, 
fully-animated attempt to steal clout from Disney's cartoon empire, but 
the mouse has no reason to be worried. The only other recent challenger 
to their throne was last fall's promising, if flawed, 20th Century Fox 
production "Anastasia," but Disney's "Hercules," with its lively cast 
and colorful palate, had her beat hands-down when it came time to crown 
1997's best piece of animation. This year, it's no contest, as "Quest 
for Camelot" is pretty much dead on arrival. Even the Magic Kingdom at 
its most mediocre -- that'd be "Pocahontas" for those of you keeping 
score -- isn't nearly as dull as this. </P>
<P>The story revolves around the adventures of free-spirited Kayley (voiced 
by Jessalyn Gilsig), the early-teen daughter of a belated knight from 
King Arthur's Round Table. Kayley's only dream is to follow in her 
father's footsteps, and she gets her chance when evil warlord Ruber 
(Gary Oldman), an ex-Round Table member-gone-bad, steals Arthur's 
magical sword Excalibur and accidentally loses it in a dangerous, 
booby-trapped forest. With the help of hunky, blind timberland-dweller 
Garrett (Carey Elwes) and a two-headed dragon (Eric Idle and Don 
Rickles) that's always arguing with itself, Kayley just might be able to 
break the medieval sexist mold and prove her worth as a fighter on 
Arthur's side. </P>
<P>"Quest for Camelot" is missing pure showmanship, an essential element if 
it's ever expected to climb to the high ranks of Disney. There's nothing 
here that differentiates "Quest" from something you'd see on any given 
Saturday morning cartoon -- subpar animation, instantly forgettable 
songs, poorly-integrated computerized footage. (Compare Kayley and 
Garrett's run-in with the angry ogre to Herc's battle with the Hydra. I 
rest my case.) Even the characters stink -- none of them are remotely 
interesting, so much that the film becomes a race to see which one can 
out-bland the others. In the end, it's a tie -- they all win.
That dragon's comedy shtick is awfully cloying, but at least it shows 
signs of a pulse. </P>
<P>At least fans of the early-'90s TGIF television line-up will be thrilled 
to find Jaleel "Urkel" White and Bronson "Balki" Pinchot sharing the 
same footage. A few scenes are nicely realized (though I'm at a loss to 
recall enough to be specific), and the actors providing the voice talent 
are enthusiastic (though most are paired up with singers who don't sound 
a thing like them for their big musical moments -- Jane Seymour and 
Celine Dion???). But one must strain through too much of this mess to 
find the good. Aside from the fact that children will probably be as 
bored watching this as adults, "Quest for Camelot"'s most grievous error 
is its complete lack of personality. And personality, we learn from this 
mess, goes a very long way. <HR>© 1998 Jamie Peck

'Look Who's Talking Back,' in which the audience gets its turn?" --
