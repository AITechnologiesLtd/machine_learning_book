<PRE>_Baby_Boy_ (R) *** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        Given the fact that _Baby_Boy_ marks writer-director John
Singleton's cinematic return to the 'hood of South Central Los Angeles a
full decade after his acclaimed debut _Boyz_N_the_Hood_, it makes sense
for Columbia Pictures to play up the connection to that seminal double
Academy Award nominee in its advertising campaign.  However, the
sure-to-be constant comparisons (which are further encouraged by
erroneous reports calling _Baby_Boy_ a sequel to _Boyz_) will only be a
disservice to what is a distinctive and worthy film in its own right.</P>
<P>        While not a _Boyz_ sequel, _Baby_Boy_ can be seen as a companion
of sorts since it also traces a young African-American man's coming of
age in South Central.  Similarities end, though, with the central
character, Jody (Tyrese Gibson).  Jody is 20-years-old and father of two
children by two different women, yet he's a layabout who still lives with
his rather young mother, Juanita (A.J. Johnson).  Jody, who spends most
of his days hanging out with his equally directionless best friend
Sweetpea (Omar Gooding) is every bit as selfish and immature as he
sounds, and while this has an unavoidable distancing effect on the
audience, it's a credit to Singleton and Gibson that they don't sugarcoat
Jody's unsympathetic qualities.  Whenever his girlfriend (and mother to
his eldest child) Yvette (Taraji P. Henson), Juanita, or her O.G.
boyfriend Melvin (Ving Rhames) express their frustration with Jody's
behavior, one feels their impatience right along with them--as one
should.</P>
<P>        Jody's belligerent act is often laid on a bit thick, as if his
outbursts are less a natural result of his short temper than it is the
manner in which he believes people expect him to behave.  His biggest
problem, it becomes clear, is not his attitude but his buying into the
fatalist mindset of the young inner city black male.  The image of his
own death recurs in his dreams and thoughts, but the visions don't really
"haunt" him per se; he seems to welcome them, as if being a "man" is to
constantly prepare himself for dying.</P>
<P>        But Jody isn't beyond redemption and/or redirection, and
ironically a great deal of his buried sincerity comes through in his
rather destructive relationship with Yvette.  _Baby_Boy_ may in essence
be a study of Jody, but the heart of the film is Jody and Yvette's
tortured romance.  Their moments of tenderness, and the chemistry between
Gibson and Henson, convince that these two people genuinely love and care
for each other.  But those pure moments are rare, and one is left to
wonder if their feelings are worth all the pain they put each other and
themselves through.  Singleton points no fingers, for both parties do
their part in perpetuating the vicious love/hate cycle.  "Baby boy" Jody
constantly cheats on her; the ever-suspicious but easily forgiving Yvette
can't bring herself to leave him, at least not for very long.</P>
<P>        The two screen newcomers are nothing short of exceptional in the
leads.  Given how abrasive his character is a lot of the time, the strong
charisma that Gibson has previously exhibited in his music, TV hosting,
and modeling careers is key to the character's engagement of the
audience.  Gibson's natural presence hooks the viewers in, and thankfully
he has the solid acting chops to keep them riveted.  He's more than able
to hold his own with the seasoned likes of Rhames and Johnson (who are
also terrific), and he is able to subtly convey what's behind Jody's
tough veneer: vulnerability, self-doubt, and, to a certain degree,
self-loathing.  Considering a number of Yvette's scenes involve her
angrily yelling at Jody, the true worth of Henson's work  can all too
easily be discounted; there's real soul behind the sometimes shrill
surface.  Most indelible is a nonverbal scene where a teary Yvette
envisions--as he sexually services her--what a life spent with him could
be like.  If pictures speak a thousand words, the looks on her face speak
a million.</P>
<P>        The largely internal nature of the drama in _Baby_Boy_ is
gripping enough that it's a bit of a letdown when external conflict
arises.  When Snoop Dogg turns up as Rodney, Yvette's just-paroled--but
hardly reformed--convict ex,  Singleton ends up retracing steps he and
many other filmmakers have taken in the past.  This is not to say that he
doesn't find some fresh spin, but for a film that had taken a hard look
at difficult people in difficult situations, this narrative direction
seems a bit too easy, making way for a resolution is a little too tidy.</P>
<P>        Nonetheless, however diluted the film's initial power feels at
the end, with _Baby_Boy_ Singleton has again succeeded in making a
thoughtful and provocative film that long resonates in the mind.</P>
