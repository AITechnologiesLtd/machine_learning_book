<P>With Marisa Tomei and Quentin Tarantino currently getting mixed
reviews in the big-budget Broadway revival of Frederick Knott's
1966 suspense play "Wait Until Dark," this would be a good time
to revisit the 1967 film version, which starred Audrey Hepburn
(who was nominated for an Oscar), Alan Arkin, and Richard Crenna.
Although I have not seen the current stage revival, I've read
enough reviews to ascertain that its essential problem is its
lack of ability to overcome what has always been the play's
fundamental weakness: it is horribly contrived.</P>
<P>The screen version, directed by Terence Young, is also thoroughly
contrived, but it is a perfect example of how mood, atmosphere,
music, and direction can overcome plot weaknesses. "Wait Until
Dark" is far from the greatest suspense movie ever made, but its
twisted tale of three con men swindling and eventually
terrorizing a blind woman alone in an apartment has just enough
momentum to sustain it for the duration of the film.</P>
<P>The story goes something like this: a beautiful drug dealer named
Lisa (Samantha Jones) is smuggling heroin in from Canada. The
drugs are carefully sewn into the back of a fancy doll. When
she's getting off the plane, she sees someone she doesn't want to
see, so she hands the doll to a complete stranger and tells him
to please hold it for her because it's a present that she doesn't
want her daughter to see. (This is the first of many strained
plot elements.)</P>
<P>The stranger is Sam Hendrix (Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.), and not
knowing what the doll contains, he takes it home to his New York
apartment, where he lives with his wife, Susy (Audrey Hepburn), a
determined woman who was recently blinded in a car wreck and is
still learning how to take care of herself while alone. Although
she can handle most of her daily chores alone, she still requires
some help from Gloria (Julie Herrod), the pre-teen girl who lives
upstairs.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, a mysterious criminal named Harry Roat (Alan Arkin)
hashes out a plan with two con men, Mike Talman (Richard Crenna)
and Carlino (Jack Weston) to get the doll back. When Sam is
called away on business and Susy is left alone one night, the
three criminals put their plan into action. They know the doll is
somewhere in Susy's apartment, but they don't know where (they
suspect it is in a safe in the living room).</P>
<P>However, instead of using bullying tactics and violent threats
like so most psychotic criminals, Roat and Co. develop a severely
and unnecessarily complicated con game to trick Susy into giving
up the doll willingly. The con involves Mike posing as an old
Army buddy of Sam's, Carlino playing a police detective, and Roat
playing several roles, including a deranged old man and another
man who suggests that his murdered wife might have been having an
affair with Sam, and Sam might be suspected of the murder.</P>
<P>As the film progresses, the audience becomes more and more aware
of just how little story there really is. Every plot element is
developed for the sole purpose of keeping the limited plot
chugging ahead. In all reality, there is no defensible reason for
this elaborate and labored con game except to serve the purposes
of suspense. Of course, without the con game, there would be no
movie. The only problem is that, unlike masterful con movies like
"The Sting" (1973) or "House of Games" (1987), the con in "Wait
Until Dark" isn't very clever, and it is certainly unnecessary.
There are so many more simple and more effective means of getting
the doll back, that the criminals end up looking more silly than
sinister.</P>
<P>There are three things that save "Wait Until Dark": the fine
performances by Hepburn, Arkin, and Crenna; a great, jangy music
score by Henry Mancini; and Young's direction. Young - who
directed some of the early Bond films including "Dr. No" (1962)
and "From Russia With Love" (1964) - should be commended
especially because he keeps the film flowing, even when you want
to stop and question the plot.</P>
<P>The movie's great climax, with Roat stalking Susy in the
apartment which she has made pitch black by knocking out all the
lights, is a small gem of direction, editing, and especially
cinematography by veteran Charles B. Lang. He and Young are
constantly wrangling with how to stage a chase sequence in a
small apartment with dark lighting from odd places, and they
manage to pull it off, making it both chilling and coherent. It's
somewhat ironic that the whole con game was devised to avoid
using violent tactics to get the doll, but in the end it is only
violence that can truly get the job done.</P>
<P>The film makes little effort to overcome its origins as a play. 
The majority of the action takes place in Susy's apartment, which
is one of those specifically stage-designed habitats where all
the rooms run horizontal to each other in a straight line, so
they can all be seen on stage at the same time. However, this
set-up ultimately works in the audience's favor because, by the
time the climax is at hand, we have seen the apartment enough
that we know where everything is. So when the lights go out and
we are left with the two antagonists in pitch blackness, we feel
like we're trapped with them.</P>
