<PRE>THE LUZHIN DEFENCE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>"Nine thousand, two hundred and sixty-three days, four hours and five 
minutes," that's precisely how long it has been since Alexander Luzhin 
(John Turturro) started playing chess, and he's the kind of guy who 
doesn't lose count.  Alexander, played with pensive intensity by John 
Turturro, is a compelling and endearing character who's rather like an 
idiot savant.  A chess champion, Alexander is at a fancy hotel where he 
is busy defending his title against an Italian Grand Master, Jean de 
Stassard (Christopher Thompson).  Alexander's former teacher and 
manager, Valentinov (Stuart Wilson), is there to cast an evil eye on 
Alexander in the hope of pressuring him into failure.</P>
<P>Marleen Gorris's THE LUZHIN DEFENCE, based on the novel by Vladimir 
Nabokov (LOLITA), uses chess not only as the sole focus of Alexander's 
life but also as a universal metaphor.  We learn, for example, that the 
king is the center of attention but has limited powers, whereas the 
queen is more cunning and agile.</P>
<P>Also staying at the hotel is Natalia Katkov (Emily Watson) and her 
mother (Geraldine James).  Two-time Academy Award nominee Watson 
(BREAKING THE WAVES and HILARY AND JACKIE), whose talent is so large and 
impressive that she quietly dominates most movies she appears in, 
manages to be no less accomplished this time, but her performance is 
eclipsed by an even better one by Turturro.</P>
<P>Thanks to strange but instant chemistry, Alexander and Natalia fall in 
love.  In order to convince Natalia's mother that he would make a proper 
son-in-law, Alexander has to engage in what is the most difficult thing 
of all for him -- small talk.  After a long pause, he tells her mother, 
"Your daughter likes -- uh -- cooling beverages."  With his bad suits, 
unkempt hair and constant need for a shave, Alexander sticks out like a 
sore thumb at the expensive resort.  No amount of awkward small talk can 
convince the mother that he is anything other than the last man on earth 
whom she would want her daughter to marry.  </P>
<P>The exquisite story, which is filmed in a Merchant-and-Ivory kind of 
period lushness, lays the proper groundwork for Alexander's many demons 
with several key flashbacks to his childhood.  We learn that he is the 
product of an uncaring mother and a philandering father and that he is 
basically addicted to the game of chess.  And, like a drug, chess is 
consuming his life.  You will be consumed watching the movie.  After 
several twists, only some of which are easy to guess, the story ends 
quite surprisingly and quite satisfactorily, although not in any 
conventional sense.  One shudders to think how a big studio version of 
this story would conclude.</P>
<P>THE LUZHIN DEFENCE runs 1:48.  It is rated PG-13 for some sensuality and 
thematic elements.  Although it would be acceptable for most kids, it 
has little to offer those under 13.</P>
