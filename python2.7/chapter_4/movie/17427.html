<P>        What turns regular people into celebrities?  I suspect
it's the public's need to adore, to project their own dreams
of glamor and stardom onto others.  People often become famous
not because of any spectacular talent or achievement, but simply
because we see them on television every day.  In an era when
committing adultery with the President of the United States is
not punished but rewarded with book deals and invitations to
Hollywood Oscar parties, it's clear that John Q. Public is
willing to elevate anything that walks across the TV screen
into a cultural icon.</P>
<P>        Ron Howard's "EDtv" is an intriguing satire about this
disturbing trend.  Smart, involving, and howlingly funny, the
movie has the courage to (subtlely) scold its audience for
engaging in hero worship.  A cross between "The Truman
Show" and a pack of slobbering paparazzi, "EDtv" takes an
unflinching look at society's preoccupation with fame, and
doesn't like what it sees.</P>
<P>        The story: a small cable network called True TV finds
itself unable to break free of dismal ratings.  "We're getting
our butts kicked by the Gardening Channel!" frets a nervous
executive.  "People would rather watch soil!"  But network
programmer Cynthia Topping (Ellen DeGeneres) has an idea: why
not take an average guy, specifically chosen to appeal to the
masses, and put him on television 24 hours a day?  Observing
how the public tends to bond with people on television, Cynthia
hypothesizes that such a person would end up as a sort of
'virtual friend' to the viewing audience... and who doesn't like
to spend time with their friends?</P>
<P>        Many people are auditioned before the network finally
decides on the personable Ed Pekurny (Matthew McConaughey).
Ed, an amiable loser in his thirties, agrees to have every
moment of his life broadcast on television for one month.  As
compensation, Ed will be paid a princely sum, which he hopes
will help his financially-strapped family.</P>
<P>        The idea seems like a win-win situation, and Ed has fun
with the role for a while.  But when his life becomes a national
phoenomenum, our hero is unsure how to handle his sudden fame.
People become so addicted to watching Ed's every move that they
forget to live their own lives.  Everyone he knows suddenly
treats him differently: his mom dresses in her finest clothes
any time Ed (and the camera crew) comes to visit, while his
brother Ray (Woody Harrelson) never passes up an opportunity to
tell his brother about his new gym, effectively obtaining free
advertising by doing so.  Indeed, Ed learns that his endorsement
can be a valuable commodity: when he casually orders a Pepsi on
TV one day, the Pepsi Corporation makes sure Ed's apartment is
filled with their products from that moment on.  As in "The
Truman Show," much of the humor here comes from the various
attempts by people and businesses to use the camera as a way to
obtain free product placement.  Ed learns to use this to his
advantage: when his father Hank (Dennis Hopper) finds himself
unemployed, Ed offers to promote any company's product on the air
if said company will give his dad a job.</P>
<P>        But fame has its downside: everywhere he goes, poor Ed
is hounded by rabid fans, and the novelty soon wears off.  But as
the program nears the end of its month-long run, Ed makes an
unpleasant discovery: his ratings are so high that the network
has decided to renew the program; due to a clause buried deep in
his contract, Ed is powerless to prevent them for doing so.  The
feeling of claustrophobia is contagious, as director Ron Howard
("Apollo 13") has wisely chosen to shoot much of the film with
oppressive close-ups, which make the audience feel as though
we too are sharing Ed's nightmare.</P>
<P>        The constant presence of the camera crew is enough to
strain the budding romance between Ed and Shari (Jenna Elfman),
his brother's ex-girlfriend.  (How does Ray find out that Ed is
dating his ex?  By watching their first kiss on TV, along with
the rest of the nation.)  This displeases the viewing audience,
who generally don't like Shari: she's too "real," and not
glamorous enough for a big star like Ed.  (A poll in USA TODAY
reveals that most viewers think Ed should hold out for a more
Hollywood-esque lover.)  The network executives pay attention
to the survey, and bring an actress named Jill (Elizabeth Hurley)
into Ed's life.  Ed doesn't realize that Jill is merely a network
ploy designed to further improve the show's ratings; the poor lug
thinks the beauty queen is actually interested in him.  This is
perhaps the scariest aspect of "EDtv": the thought that
someone's life could be so heartlessly manipulated in order to
garner ratings' dollars.  If the market research doesn't approve
of Ed's relationship with Shari, then sorry, she's gotta go.</P>
<P>        Matthew McConaughey does wonderful things with this
role, making Ed Pekurny likable and empathetic.  He's a genuinely
nice guy, just going with the flow as best he can.  He does not
ask for the flood of attention and adulation he receives; because
of this, he remains human right through to the end.  Nor is
McConaughey the only actor doing fine work here: Rob Reiner
has a terrific time as the cartoonish Whitaker, the villainous
network president who refuses to release Ed from his contract
after the show becomes a hit.  But the film is stolen by Martin
Landau's warm portrayal of Al, Ed's elderly stepfather.  I was
reminded of his fine performance as Bela Lugosi in Tim
Burton's "Ed Wood" (for which Landau deservedly won a "Best
Supporting Actor" Oscar), because, just like his performance
as Lugosi, Landau here is sensitive yet irreverent, serious yet
zany, crass yet loveable.  ("I've gotta go to the bathroom," he
cheerfully informs his family at one point.  "Wish me luck!")</P>
<P>        There are a couple of minor problems.  Although we're
cheering for Ed to win back his independence and elude the
cameras, even if temporarily, the least satisfying moments of
the film are those in which our hero does just that.  Without
the camera crew to play against, the movie's storyline and
romance feel a bit mundane.  Seeing Ed and Shari share a
romantic moment alone is not nearly as fun as seeing them
share the same moment with millions of people.  Although we
want Ed to succeed, we have to admit that his story is more
interesting when he doesn't.</P>
<P>        Nor is the film's final solution to Ed's problem
particularly satisfying.  It's an unwarranted and inappropriate
descent into potty humor, feeling like something tacked on at
the last minute specifically to appeal to the same audience
the film so brilliantly satirizes for the rest of its running
time.</P>
<P>        These are minor problems, however.  "EDtv" is rich in
pointed satire, centering around our tendency to make people into
celebrities.  Why do people become famous?  Because they're on
TV.  Why are they on TV?  Because they're famous.  "EDtv"
serves as a reminder of something we often forget: people on TV
are just that: people.  They needn't be placed on pedestals,
worshipped, or forced to life their lives under the unwelcome eye
of public scrutiny.</P>
