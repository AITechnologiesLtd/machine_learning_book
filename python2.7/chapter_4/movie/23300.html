<PRE>"Reindeer Games" (2000)</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by John Frankenheimer
Written by Ehren Kruger</PRE>
<P>Starring Ben Affleck, Gary Sinise, Charlize Theron, Dennis Farina, Danny Trejo,
Clarence Williams III, and Isaac Hayes.</P>
<PRE>Grade: * (out of four)</PRE>
<P>What makes Reindeer Games even more disappointing than just a predictable,
lifeless action flick is the cast and crew who signed onto the project. Most of
the people involved in Reindeer Games just came off terrible slumps with
excellent comeback performances in their most recent films. John Frankenheimer,
who made the unforgettable Cold War drama The Manchurian Candidate way back in
the early 60's, recently showed critics and fans alike that he still had some
magic left in his directorial skills when he created the brilliant car chase
scenes in Ronin. Screenwriter Ehren Kruger gave a remarkable first impression
when he wrote the script for the underrated Arlington Rd.  Ben Affleck
displayed his comedic talents in Dogma and Boiler Room, and even on Saturday
Night Live directly after the horrible Forces of Nature and 200 Cigarettes.
Even Charlize Theron, who I was convinced couldn't act, did a decent job in
Cider House Rules. When all of these bright stars come together, one would
assume that the movie will have great potential to be entertaining. After
coming out of the theater showing Reindeer Games, disbelief was my first
reaction…then frustration. The movie could have premiered on Cinemax at two in
the morning starring an all-rookie cast and still would have been equally
lacking in entertaining. The acting is so pitiful and the script so dull, I may
have to rethink some of my opinions on how talented these actors actually are.
It seemed like everyone was restricted to just the script and not given a fair
amount of improvisational rights. We have all seen Ben Affleck have some fun on
the set, it is so apparent in a number of scenes in Good Will Hunting when he
exchanges jokes with his friends at a bar. The actors in that movie were having
fun and, from that, the audience had fun. Reindeer Games is the complete
opposite; the actors don't seem to want to be their characters (even Danny
Trejo, who will do practically anything, doesn't look like he is enjoying
himself), causing the audience to quickly lose interest. Evidence of public
disapproval was noted when a woman behind me yelled "Boy this movie is
horrible!" and when there were scattered giggles during the most dramatic
moments.</P>
<P>The story follows a man, Rudy (Ben Affleck), who is leaving prison in a few
days along with his best friend and cellmate Nick (James Frain). Nick has been
exchanging love letters with a beautiful woman, Ashley (Charlize Theron), and
cannot wait to leave prison and meet her in person. When Nick is killed in a
prison riot, Rudy decides to pretend to be Nick and take Ashley out on a date
for the Christmas holidays. Unfortunately Ashley's brother, Gabriel (Gary
Sinise) interferes with their relationship. Thinking Rudy is Nick, he kidnaps
Rudy and threatens to kill him unless he helps rob a casino, which Nick use to
work at as a security guard. Now Rudy must pretend to be Nick so he can protect
Ashley from her brother Gabriel. Confused? The movie only gets more complex as
it goes on, until it gets way, way too complex at its climax. </P>
<P>But Reindeer Games makes its first serious mistake during the first half an
hour. The hero commits a greedy, selfish act when he decides to pretend he is
his dead cellmate in order to date Ashley. Some hero. The point of a hero is to
do the morally correct thing, a person for the audience to relate to or admire.
When Rudy lies and cheats his way into trouble, instead of gathering support
from me for him to ultimately succeed in getting the bad guys, I felt more like
he was getting what he deserved and even wanted to see him fail at times. The
most irritating part of the film (besides the fact that this is a Christmas
movie released in February) is the number of chances the bad guys get to kill
Rudy but fail or delay for some idiotic reason. The routine in which the bad
guy must explain his genius plan to the hero before attempting to kill him with
some elaborate machine is getting so tired nowadays, especially when I eagerly
want to see the hero dead. </P>
<P>The only saving grace keeping this movie from receiving zero stars is an
amusing but pointless cameo from Isaac Hayes as a prisoner upset with his food.
Why he was in this movie for such a pointless role beats me. Why any of these
people had anything at all to do with this movie beats me.  </P>
