<PRE>"Thirteen Days" to Remember
by Homer Yen
(c) 2001</PRE>
<P>On a chilly October day in 1962, America teetered on
the verge of war.  A national crisis had developed
when it was discovered that Russia was secretly
installing nuclear missiles in Cuba, giving our Red
adversary first strike capability.  America was
adamant in finding a way to remove them.  However, it
was unclear as to whether diplomacy would work or
whether military force would be needed.  Had the Cuban
Missile Crisis escalated out of control, it would have
started an irreversible chain of events that could
have, in all likelihood, sent mankind on a trajectory
towards Armageddon.  That is, unless cooler heads
could prevail.</P>
<P>"Thirteen Days" is a wonderfully suspenseful and
dramatic retelling of the Cuban Missile Crisis when
America hoped for the best but virtually expected the
worst, showing us why cooler heads did prevail. 
Culled from a host of sources, including historical
records and documents, White House tapes, memoirs, and
interviews with some of the key players, the
screenplay centers on three people that ultimately
helped to pull America and the world back from the
brink.  The most crucial, of course, is then-President
John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood) who must
simultaneously act decisively to address the grave
threat to national security, maintain a sense of
decision-making integrity to appease opposing
political forces, and exercise temperance in this time
of high volatility.  We learn that it's not just the
"big red dog digging in our backyard" that poses a
threat.  Equally menacing is the zealous military
brass that wants to take immediate, forceful action. 
Greenwood turns in a strong performance who makes a
believable Kennedy, allowing the audience to
internalize the agonizing political decisions that
would not only affect the future of his administration
but the future of the world as well.  </P>
<P>The other two key players are Attorney General Robert
F. Kennedy (Steven Culp) who remains edgy about any
path they undertake but is committed to carrying out
the decisions of his Presidential brother.   Also,
Kenneth P. O'Donnell (Kevin Costner) is a brusque
political advisor that helps to keep the political
machine from unraveling.  Both also give fine
performances, making it easy to accept them as the
people that they portray.</P>
<P>The movie chronicles the crisis from when offensive
missiles are first discovered being assembled in Cuba.
 Every action that the U.S. takes in countering the
threat seems reasonable.  However, the results bring
frightening consequences that push us closer towards
the unthinkable with alarming momentum.  Throughout
the film, the sense of urgency and tension mounts. 
For President Kennedy and the world, the stakes are
unspeakably high and the territory that they have
entered is uncharted.</P>
<P>The stark nature of the drama is heightened as some
scenes are shot in black and white.  Additionally, to
give the onscreen turmoil a more profound sense of
realism, many scenes feature video footage from that
period.  We witness the pandemonium at the stores as
citizens stocked up on goods; watch venerable news
anchor Walter Cronkite struggle to find the words to
adequately describe the frenzied situation; and most
haunting, view images of school children running for
cover during a bomb drill.</P>
<P>This is a riveting, message-driven film about a
pivotal point in our history when a handful of men had
the power to save or destroy the entire world.  It's a
chapter of America's recent past that should never be
forgotten.  After seeing it, you'll feel lucky to be
alive.</P>
