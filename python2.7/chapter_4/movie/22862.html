<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Harry Cohn, head of Columbia Pictures, gave Joseph H. Lewis his first
break to make a classier picture than his previous low-budget ones, and
when he saw the early rushes of the film, he elevated "My Name Is Julia
Ross," from a 10-day "B" to an 18-day "A" picture.</P>
<P>Though not original in motif, nevertheless this film is a beauty, one
that is able through its visualizations to strike a fresh looking chord.
It is noted for its brooding atmosphere, its classical noir camera work,
as the heroine is seen forlornly looking out of windows with bars on
them, and the film is particularly noteworthy for the fine performances
of its stars, Nina Foch as Julia Ross, Dame May Whitty as Mrs. Hughes,
and George Macready as Ralph Hughes.</P>
<P>Julia Ross is an American who came to London to see a doctor for her
illness. She might or might not have a boyfriend in Dennis Bruce
(Varno); that relationship is cloudy and not fully explained as the two
quickly meet and exchange pleasantries. What is clear to Julia, is that
she needs money, as she owes her landlady three weeks back rent, and
that she has just gone to an employment agency and, after being
questioned by a Miss Sparkes (Bolster), who requests the need for her to
have no family or friends in London, which Julia says fits her to a tee,
she is hired as a live-in secretary for Mrs. Hughes.</P>
<P>She departs that night to go to her new residence and leaves a note to
Dennis and also leaves the back rent, with the cleaning lady
(Harrington). When Dennis comes by to see her, he is surprised that she
is not there and that the cleaning lady tells him nothing, as she plans
to keep the rent money and has ripped up Julia's note.</P>
<P>The suspense builds, as Julia wakes up in a Cornwall mansion and looks
out at the sea, as the camera pans completely around the strange room
she is in. She is told that she just got released from a mental
institution and is married to Ralph, Mrs. Hughes' son. Julia realizes
that she has been drugged last night and brought here from London, but
can't explain to the maid, Alice (Queenie), who comes from the village
and is not part of Mrs. Hughes' scheme, what is happening to her in a
believable way. When Julia tells her she is not crazy and just wants to
get out of here, the maid is puzzled at what to do.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Dennis senses something is wrong by her unexplained absence
and when he returns to Julia's boarding house he confronts the cleaning
lady and gets her to admit that Julia left him a note. When he goes to
the employment agency, he is told they moved out in the night and left
no forwarding address.</P>
<P>Julia tries to escape, but finds she is blocked by a high wall around
the house and a locked gate in front. She makes another attempt to
escape in the vicar's car, but he falls for Mrs. Hughes' explanation of
Marian, as Julia is now called, as someone who is mentally ill. So he
dutifully returns her to Ralph.</P>
<P>Ralph is a rather frightening character, often seen whittling intensely
away with his knife. As Julia is anxious to find out what is going down,
she finds out from Ralph, by surreptitiously questioning him that she is
supposedly his wife Marian and some of the details of their short
marriage. Suspecting that harm will come to her, she keeps her ears open
and is able to hear a conversation between Ralph and his mother, about
how they plan to kill her and make it look like a suicide, and thereby
substitute her body for the real Marian, who had found out that Ralph
married her for her money and had lied about his financial
circumstances. She then slapped him and the quick-tempered Ralph went
berserk and knifed her to death, dumping her body out to sea.</P>
<P>Lewis comes up with a few interesting plot twists to make the story even
more scary, as the trapped Julia fights desperately to save her life,
figuring her best chance, is to get word to Dennis. She leaves a letter
out in the open in her room that is addressed to Dennis and that tells
of Mrs. Hughes' plans to kill her. The foxy Mrs. Hughes discovers that
letter and tells her son to drive Marian into town and let her post the
letter she just switched. Julia is able to empty that phony letter out
the car window and substitute her real letter, which Ralph lets her
post.</P>
<P>But when Julia hears that they plan to murder her right away, she fakes
taking poison and demands to see a doctor. Mrs. Hughes cleverly gets her
butler, Peters (Mudie), who she keeps on the job by blackmailing him, to
act as a doctor. Julia is fooled into thinking that he is really a
doctor and tells him about the letter she sent Dennis.</P>
<P>Mrs. Hughes sends Peters to Dennis' house to retrieve the letter, but
when he steals it from under the nose of Dennis' landlady, she spots him
and has him arrested. The police are able to get it out of him what Mrs.
Hughes plans to do to Julia, as they set a trap for Ralph back in
Cornwall.</P>
<P>The last scene has Dennis and Julia riding away to be married, as she
tells him before they kiss to happily end the film, "that the next time
I ask for a job, I'll ask for their references." The result is a pretty
good suspense story and the beginning of Lewis's illustrious career in
directing a better type of a film.</P>
