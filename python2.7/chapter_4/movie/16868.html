 Rounders (1998) 2 stars out of 4. Starring Matt Damon, Edward Norton, John
Malkovich and Gretchen Mol. Directed by John Dahl.</P>
<P> Rounders is like a high-stakes poker game. Sometimes it shows its hand too
early, sometimes it holds back some of its cards, but a lot of the time it
merely bluffs.</P>
<P> Director John Dahl's drama centers on a law student (Matt Damon) who has a
secret night life as a player in high-stakes underground poker games.</P>
<P> After losing it all in a big-stakes game, Mike McDermott (Damon) swears
off the cards to concentrate on his legitimate life as well as his
girlfriend, Jo (Gretchen Mol).</P>
<P> But an old friend, Worm (Edward Norton), newly released from prison,
forces Mike back into the life to help Worm make good on his old gambling
debts.</P>
<P> Worm is a complete screw-up. Whereas Mike plays poker for the thrill, to
Worm it's all a con to make money. Worm cheats, and in doing so, not only
gets Mike deeper in debt but gets him beaten.</P>
<P> Dahl (Red Rock West, The Last Seduction) does what he can with the
material. But writers David Levien and Brian Koppelman hedge their bets.
They create a part Cincinnati Kid, part good buddy-bad buddy film with a
bit of love story thrown in.</P>
<P> The movie, at a bit over two hours, drags in many spots and spends too
much time focusing on Mike's determination to stay away from the gambling
tables when it is obvious that he really yearns for the game.</P>
<P> And when he is playing, the suspense is diluted by Mike's voice-over
narration, explaining the intricacies of the game and how to spot a mark so
you can win his money.</P>
<P> Actually, Mike's narration is the most interesting part of the film, as he
gives an insider's look at the high-ante games and what is needed to win.</P>
<P> Damon is appealing as Mike. He has that clean-cut, fresh look that makes
his double life believable. He has that charming smile that he utilizes to
escape from tough situations.</P>
<P> What is hard to understand is his determination to stick with Worm even
beyond the point of common sense.</P>
<P> Norton is all posing and vulgarity as the cheating card shark. He is a
seedy liar totally lacking in charm. He is a boorish trickster, and it's
amazing that a low-life such as him can even find someone to sit at a table
with him.</P>
<P> Mol has little to do except berate Mike for his return to his old ways.</P>
<P> John Malkovich, as the gambling kingpin, talks with a thick Russian accent
that sounds almost like something from an old vaudeville routine.</P>
<P> John Turturro, as a professional gambler who tries to help Mike, is cool
and cerebral, explaining that the game must be looked at as a business or a
profession.</P>
<P> Overall, Rounders, though a bit too long, is interesting but uneven. It's
more intriguing than a game of rummy, but it fails to reach the high stakes
at which it aims.</P>
