<P>   To paraphrase Jean-Jacques Rousseau, in the beginning
there are ideals.  Society interferes, and scruples are
corrupted.  As Costa-Gavras might have expressed this
philosophy is his latest melodrama, "Mad City": When we get
started in our professions, we're ready to change the world, to
make it a better place.  We become callused and begin to
look out only for Number One.  The character in "Mad City"
who best illustrates this is Mia Kirshner, in the role of Laurie,
an enthusiastic intern with a local California TV station. 
Laurie, who is bright, spirited, and very young, is in love with
her job as a budding broadcast journalist and more than
willing to attach herself to a mentor she naively believes to
share her interest in the Pursuit of Truth.  In short order she
becomes disillusioned with the possibilities of her medium
while at the same time develops the hard shell of a woman
who knows what she really wants: to zoom up the career
ladder and carve out a niche for herself in a most lucrative
profession.</P>
<P>   Costa-Gavras, a director whose sympathies have always
been firmly on the left of the political spectrum, jolted the film
world in 1970 with his third film, "Z," a stunning indictment of
the military junta which was at that time ruling his native
Greece.  At that time Costa-Gavras seemed to be believe he
was standing at the historical moment in which movies
themselves could transform history.  Ironically enough, the
famed director, born Konstantinos Gavras in 1933, seems to
have turned cynical himself, no longer believing that his
products could be much more than entertainment, however
thrilling.  With "Mad City" he continues the downhill move
signified by such ordinary diversions as "Hannah K.,"
"Betrayed," and "The Music Box."  "Mad City," an indictment
of the TV news industry, has its moments, but because Dustin
Hoffman and John Travolta do not themselves seem engaged
by their activities and because the action of the film often
seems like a photographed play taking place largely within the
confines of a museum, the film, while believable, fails to
captivate.  What's more, Costa-Gavras does not even educate
us about the depravity of the establishment he debunks. 
Whether we're news junkies or casual followers of the blow-
dried anchors who nightly illuminate our TV screens, we
digest nothing more than what we already know.</P>
<P>   The tale centers on Max Brackett (Dustin Hoffman), a sharp
investigative reporter who has been demoted to backwater
stories because at one time he publicly ridiculed anchorman
Kevin Hollander (Alan Alda).  (A flashback midway into the
movie portrays Hollander as an egotistical seeker of high
ratings who grills reporter Brackett very specifically about the
content of body parts which have flown hither and thither after
a airline accident.)  When Brackett is assigned to interview
Mrs. Banks (Blythe Danner), the director of a museum which
has fallen on difficult financial times, he stumbles upon an
incident involving a former security guard, Sam Baily (John
Travolta), who has been laid off from his job and who,
entering the museum with a shotgun, compels its director to
listen to his grievances.  What seems at first an interesting,
though unexceptional event, turns into a national
phenomenon involving the rapt attention of the American
public.  </P>
<P>   Seeking to exploit the protests of the previously honest and
intellectually vacant security guard, Brackett coaxes his
station to give him a live, nationwide hookup, which allows
him to present the human side of the unfortunate gunman. 
Every technique of the TV industry is marshalled, including
reportage of polls--which show that a majority of viewers have
become quite sympathetic to the felon.  Rejoicing in his
newly-found fame as a TV journalist, Brackett becomes 
Baily's adviser, insisting that Baily make substantial demands
on the police forces which have gathered outside the museum
and becoming, in effect, a strong segment of the story.  As
hawkers gather to sell souvenir T-shirts with Sam's picture,
clashes develop between the FBI and the local police chief
and between anchorman Hollander and reporter Brackett for
ownership of the story.  Meanwhile Laurie tracks down the
felon's mother to broadcast an interview largely sympathetic
to Sam, who has by now become the taker of hostages,
largely children, and who has accidentally shot the man with
whom he had worked.</P>
<P>   "Mad City" fits in with several other movies which have
taken their pleasure in exposing the debauched underside of
American institutions.  "Critical Care," which opened at about
the same time as "Mad City," satirizes the hospital industry,
which is far more concerned about the financial health of its
patients than about their well-being.  Just recently, "Devil's
Advocate" unfolded a scenario in which a brilliant lawyer
begins to question the ethics of defending people whom he
knows are felons.  Years back, "The Hospital" turned a
serious situation into Marx-Brothers comedy while "Network"
exposed the TV industry's willingness to do anything to
increase ratings.  "The Big Carnival," Billy Wilder's 1951 film
about an embittered reporter who seeks the brass ring by
exploiting a human interest story, was a more biting story than
"Mad City," one which featured superior acting by Kirk
Douglas and Jan Sterling.  Perhaps the passage of time has
made us all so cynical about the banalities of doctors,
lawyers, politicians and journalists that "Mad City"--which
offers nothing fresh--is simply unable to shake us up.  Rated
PG-13.  Running Time: 114 minutes.  (C) 1997 Harvey Karten</P>
