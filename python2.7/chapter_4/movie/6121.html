<P>     Cable TV channel involvement in the motion picture industry is 
nothing new.  HBO and Showtime have been financing movies for years.  
However, in 1996, other cable networks have begun to stake out their 
piece of the action.  Nickelodeon made the Paramount Pictures release, 
HARRIET THE SPY, MTV produced JOE'S APARTMENT, and now the Discovery 
Channel has come out with THE LEOPARD SON, a beautifully-photographed, 
thoroughly charming documentary about the coming of age of a male 
leopard on the plains of the Serengeti.</P>
<P>     Even frequent viewers of made-for-TV nature specials won't be fully 
prepared for the majesty of THE LEOPARD SON.  This is a singularly 
cinematic experience that will lose much when cropped for television 
viewing.  And, because the cinematography is by far the most important 
aspect of this movie, the high aptitude level evidenced by directors of 
photography Hugo Van Lawick and Matthew Aeberhard makes this a rewarding 
motion picture experience.</P>
<P>     Van Lawick is a Dutch photographer and naturalist who has spent 
most of his adult life living on the plains of the Serengeti.  In his 
own words, "To be as close as possible to nature as I could -- that was 
my dream."  THE LEOPARD SON is his filmed journal of two years in the 
life of a young male leopard.  Van Lawick's camera first captures the 
cub when he's only a few weeks old, then follows him through youth and 
adolescence to adulthood.  Along the way, we observe his relationship 
with his mother, his first attempts at hunting his own meals, and the 
harsh lessons that identify his place in the food chain.  And, in a film 
which has a leopard as the central character, there are supporting 
appearances by all manner of other African wildlife, including baboons, 
elephants, giraffes, hyenas, rhinos, cheetahs, and lions.  Some children 
may rightfully see this as a kind of live action LION KING.</P>
<P>     What's unusual about THE LEOPARD SON is that it's a nature film 
with characters and a plot.  We are drawn into the drama of the title 
creature's life, and find ourselves rooting for him to hunt down a meal, 
rediscover his mother, make peace with his half-siblings, and, in the 
end, find a mate.  As in any well-constructed motion picture, there's 
humor, pathos, passion, and danger.  Unfortunately, however, we are 
subjected to an irritatingly repetitive and superfluous voiceover 
provided by Sir John Gielgud.  This would have been a better film 
without it.  THE LEOPARD SON is so well-crafted visually that it doesn't 
need a narrator.</P>
<P>     Van Lawick is discreet when it comes to showing the brutal 
consequences of being inattentive on the Serengeti, but even his 
carefully-edited shots of death have power.  As a whole, THE LEOPARD SON 
is a long string of memorable images -- a twitching tail sticking above 
breeze-blown grasses, golden sunlight streaming through broken clouds, a 
misty, pastel dawn, a leopard silhouetted by the setting sun.  Depending 
on the circumstances, the photography can be intimate or panoramic.  
There are nearly as many shots of the leopard's eyes as there are broad, 
sweeping views of the plains.</P>
<P>     While THE LEOPARD SON doesn't match Jean-Jacques Annaud's 1988 
feature, THE BEAR, for creativity and emotional power, it is still the 
best wildlife drama to reach theater screens in years.  Even those who 
find Gielgud's voiceover intrusive will be so captivated by the visual 
splendor that they're unlikely to complain.  Despite its low-key, 
limited release, THE LEOPARD SON is a family gem that's worth seeking 
out... even if you don't have a family.</P>
