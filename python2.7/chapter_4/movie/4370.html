                       A film review by Greta Christina

<P>     Life is getting a bit too surreal for me, folks.  I just saw a
movie that had some of the best, most interesting, most varied female
characters that I've seen all year.  And it was a James Bond movie.  No
shit.  I kid you not; they made a James Bond movie with really
spectacularly cool women.</P>
<P>     I don't know what this world is coming to.  There's probably not
much point in summarizing the plot of GOLDENEYE; it's a James Bond
movie, and that's all you really need to know.  But I suppose a plot
summary is traditional in a movie review, so here goes.  James Bond
(Pierce Brosnan this time) runs around saving the world from a
brilliant but psychotic arch villain.  He drives fast cars, shoots big
guns, blows a lot of stuff up, sneaks around doing spy stuff, and
horses around with pretty women.  GOLDENEYE is a pretty good example of
the genre; the production values are high, the stunts and explosions
are bitching, and Brosnan does a more-than-adequate job as Bond.</P>
<P>     And the women are fucking amazing.  All of them (well, most of
them, anyway).  The women in GOLDENEYE are tough and strong and
competent.  No matter what field they're in, whether they're running an
intelligence agency or plotting to destroy the world, they know what
the hell they're doing, and they do it with gusto.  They don't wait
around passively for men to do all the fun important stuff; they're
active participants in the action, doing fun important stuff their very
own selves.</P>
<P>     Anyone who is familiar with the Bond ouvre will recognize
immediately that this is a radical departure.  Most 007 movies have
very specific, very standardized types of women.  There's the
fashionably beautiful airhead, generally in a bikini or an evening
gown, whose sole purpose in the movie is to fuck James Bond.  There's
the good-girl, also fashionably beautiful, marginally less airheaded
than the fuckbunny but with a pronounced tendency to cringe and cower
in a crisis, whose sole purpose in the movie is to get saved by James
Bond.  There's the villainess, often competent in some traditionally
male field but ruthless, unprincipled and indifferent to human life,
who acts as a foil to James Bond (although never as his primary
antagonist-- she always works for the arch-villain) and is killed or
destroyed in the end.  And there's the misguided bad-girl, who is both
beautiful and competent but has somehow been misled into working for
the bad guys, who is converted to Truth, Justice and the British Way of
Life by getting fucked by James Bond.  None of them ever instigate any
of the action, and their lives are entirely focused in one way or
another on Bond.  (In the interests of fairness, I should point out
that I haven't seen every single 007 movie every made; this analysis is
based on the six or seven that I have seen.)</P>
<P>     But GOLDENEYE departs from this formula in some very drastic
ways.  I'd like to start with the secondary characters; since one of
the more fabulous things about GOLDENEYE's women is their variety, the
minor characters wind up contributing a great deal to the surprisingly
feminist flavor of the movie.  Take the character of M, head of British
intelligence and Bond's superior officer.  "Now, wait a minute," I hear
you cry.  "M's not a woman.  M changes from movie to movie, but M has
never been a woman.  No woman has ever given James Bond his working
orders." Well, she is and she does in this one, played with a
delightful hardassed professional edge by Judi Dench.  Bond doesn't
much like her; but although he gives her shit, he doesn't question her
authority.  Interestingly, her management style is presented as less
intuitive and impetuous, more analytical and responsible, than the
spy-boys are really happy with; the exact opposite of the criticism
usually levelled at women in power.  And in her confrontation with 007,
she reads him the riot act with the best of them, calling him a
"sexist, misogynist dinosaur, a relic of the Cold War, whose boyish
charms are wasted on me."  Quite a departure from the female fawning
and groveling that characterizes most Bond movies.</P>
<P>     And look at Moneypenny (Samantha Bond), Bond's devoted assistant.
In previous 007 movies, Moneypenny is an aging, unattractive spinster
with a schoolgirl crush on 007 and no life outside her job, who lives
for the approval and bantering flirtation that James occasionally
deigns to bestow upon her.  In GOLDENEYE, however, Moneypenny is none
of the above.  She's attractive--not as a bimbo, but as a striking and
stylish adult woman--and she has a life as well as a career.  She
flirts with Bond, but the flirtation is anything but servile.  In fact,
when he makes some suggestive comment to her, she points out that what
he's doing could be considered sexual harassment--and then challenges
him to come through on all the innuendos he's aimed at her for so
long.  Again, I've never seen anything like it in any 007 movie.</P>
<P>     Moving on to the major characters, we have the villainess, Xenia
Onatopp (Famke Janssen).  That's right:  Onatopp.  Even the name is a
departure form previous Bond temptresses such as, say, Pussy Galore.
Onatopp is a ravenous, sadistic beauty, a former Soviet fighter pilot
who smokes cigars and drives Ferraris and gets sexually aroused by
machine-gun fire and kills men by crushing them to death between her
thighs.  She takes her martinis "straight--with a twist," and she looks
hot as hell in a uniform.  I, for one, have fallen in love.  (Side note
for Star Trek TNG fans:  Janssen, the woman who plays Onatopp, also
played Kamala, the metamorph babe who falls for Picard in "The Perfect
Mate."  Yum.)  In many ways she's quite similar to previous Bond
villainesses; beautiful but ruthless, sexy but dangerous, plays second
fiddle to the real (male) villain, dies a horrible death.  But her
appropriation of traditionally male attributes into a distinctly female
persona, as well as her aggressive, audacious, wildly kinky sexuality,
make for a significant deviation (if you'll pardon the pun) from the
007 standard.</P>
<P>     Finally, we come to the heroine, Natalya Simonova (Izabella
Scorupco), a cute but sort of geeky computer programmer.  Yes, folks,
blasphemy of blasphemies; Bond's girl is a smart, competent
techno-geek, a serious professional in her own right, who can do
something difficult and important that he can't do.</P>
<P>     Like the other women in GOLDENEYE, Natalya is utterly lacking in
the passivity and the cringing subservience that most Bond babes have
had in the past.  When her world comes (literally) crashing down around
her head, she uses her head to keep herself safe and then crawls out of
the wreckage with her bare hands.  She doesn't hesitate to mouth off to
Bond; in fact, she gives him a piece of her mind about his
testosterone-addled lifestyle on more than one occasion.  And when
they're sneaking around in the bad guy's hideout and Bond tells her to
stay put, she totally ignores him and runs to the computer room to jam
the bad guys' program.</P>
<P>     What's more, she dresses like a regular schmoe; during most of the
movie, she's in a cardigan and a plain skirt and thick black tights,
and for much of the rest of it she's in combat trousers and what looks
an awful lot like a long thermal undershirt.  They do get her into a
bikini at one point--it must be in the contract somewhere that Bond's
girlfriend has to wear a bikini for at least one scene--but for the
most part, she dresses like any sane human being would if they lived in
freezing Russia or were running around trying to defeat bad guys.
She's definitely a babe; the outfits suit her, and she does have the
standard Hollywood female body of the 90s.  But she comes across as a
sexy and attractive real-life non-plastic human being.  Once again,
quite unlike any Bond women I've ever seen.</P>
<P>     But what makes Natalya such a radical and delightful departure
from the usual good-girl Bond-meat isn't her skilled professionalism,
or her charming geekdom, or her feisty spirit.  It's not even her
intelligence or courage or physical strength.  What makes her so great
is her participation in the action of the movie.  She doesn't just run
around after 007, squealing and cowering and waiting to be rescued
(well, not much, anyway).  She gets in there and gets her hands dirty;
she can shoot guns and fly helicopters (no, I don't know why a computer
programmer would know how to fly a helicopter); she comes up with ideas
and whacks bad guys in the head.  And her computer skills are central
to the plot, indispensable to solving the puzzle and thwarting the bad
guys' evil scheme.</P>
<P>     Granted, it's still Bond's game; it's his puzzle that she's
solving, it's his arch-enemy that she's battling, and of course it's
his pants that she wants to get into.  But she's still one of the
coolest women I've seen on the screen all year.  She reminds me a lot
of the Sandra Bullock character in Speed; she's basically a regular
schmoe in a bad situation, and she does freak out about it on occasion,
but overall she handles the crisis with grace and courage and style.</P>
<P>     I'm impressed.  It's not just that I've never seen women like this
in any 007 movie; I've seen damn few women like this in amy movie.  The
filmmakers didn't just manage to come up with a decent female
character; they came up with several, all strong and competent and
nervy, and all in their own unique way.  It's almost as if Hollywood
finally figured out that lots of women enjoy action movies, and will
pay to see ones that don't insult us.  I applaud their efforts, and
hope they keep it up.</P>
