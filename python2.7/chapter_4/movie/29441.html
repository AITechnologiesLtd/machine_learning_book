<PRE>"The Musketeer" – Sharp Swords, Dull Adaptation
by Homer Yen
(c) 2001</PRE>
<P>If Alexandre Dumas only knew that his most famous
work, "The Three Musketeers," was going to be adapted
into umpteen big screen variations, his conversation
with Hollywood might go something like this: "I'll
take $100,000 for every good adaptation and a million
dollars for every bad adaptation."  Well, with this
latest effort, Dumas would be a millionaire.  </P>
<P>Actually, that's a bit unfair, for this installment is
not terrible.  It's a pretty looking film.  There is
obviously great care taken to evoke the 17th-century
French atmosphere from its verdant countryside to its
beautiful castles, from the regal nobility to the
gloomy street urchins.  It also boasts some
imaginative action sequences.  </P>
<P>But from a story telling point of view, it's not any
more rousing or dramatic than any of its predecessors.
 In fact, the story of the Musketeers seems so
familiar that even when they sound their battle cry of
"all for one and one for all," it is practically an
expected occurrence rather than a spirit-lifting
charge.  Without new dramatic juice, it's like being
served leftovers with only a new piece of garnish.</P>
<P>That garnish, however, is the wild sword fights.  The
trailers for this Musketeer adaptation have touted it
as a completely reimagined piece of work, which is
largely attributed to this.  There are about a dozen
or so battles, and the incredible athleticism
displayed seemingly requires a black belt in martial
arts, an ability to fence while blindfolded, as well
as two years experience performing with the Cirque du
Soleil troupe.  It's not surprising that there are 25
stunt doubles.</P>
<P>The film's plot revolves around D'artagnan (Justin
Chambers), who as a child, sees his parents
slaughtered by the evil Febre (Tim Roth) and vows
revenge.  He grows up wanting to be a Musketeer,
protectors of the King, and eventually learns about
the machinations of Cardinal Richelieu (Stephen Rea),
who is trying to undermine his highness in an attempt
to seize power.</P>
<P>The word "Musketeer" should conjure up a vision of
heroism.  But Chambers-as-D'artagnan lacks neither the
needed heft nor the charisma to fill the shoes of a
hero.  He delivers all of his lines with a similar
amount of intensity whether it's "You're beautiful" or
"Don't fight me, for you will die."  But casting this
pretty-boy suggests that the movie studio is looking
to appeal to an age group that watches Dawson's Creek,
who perhaps are more concerned with good looks rather
than a moving story.  </P>
<P>Yet, it's easy for D'artagnan to lose focus as during
the course of his comeuppance, he meets a slew of
ill-defined characters.  They include a feisty ingenue
and love interest (Mena Suvari); a despondent
Musketeer army led by Athos, Portos, and Aramis; a
sympathetic queen (Catherine Deneuve), as well as the
scheming Cardinal and arch-enemy Febre.  The story
thus becomes needlessly complicated, saddled with
unnecessary scenes.  </P>
<P>Again, the main draw is the fight sequences, and most
are neat to watch.  A climactic battle atop a series
of careening giant ladders, for example, is something
that most American moviegoers have never seen.  Yet,
the action is so over-the-top that instead of
achieving a sense of escapism, it becomes somewhat
absurd and goofy.  In one scene, D'artagnan's steed
even collapses before he does.  </P>
<P>We can live with the so-so characterizations and can
likely enjoy the fighting sequences.  But we needed a
more compact and affecting story.  Someone has
forgotten that the pen is mightier than the sword.</P>
