                         Big Night (1996)
                   A film review by Dave Cowen
                    Copyright 1996 Dave Cowen</PRE>
<P>"My brother is a world above you," says Secondo (Stanley Tucci)
to Pascal (Ian Holm) about his idealist brother Primo (Tony
Shaloub).  Primo makes subtle, authentic Italian food and
refuses to serve watered-down, traditional fare at his
restaurant.  "I'm a businessman," retorts successful but
commercial restauranteur Pascal, "what are you?"  One of the
many maddening things about BIG NIGHT is that we never do get to
find out who Secondo really is... and a lot more is missing as
well.</P>
<P>Primo and Secondo have come over from Italy in the 50's with the
dream of making it big in America by doing what they know best:
making the greatest Italian cuisine known to man.  After two
years of preparation, they've just opened their restaurant and
found that the patrons in the unnamed east coast city they've
settled in don't seem very interested in genuine Italian
cuisine, preferring instead the "spaghetti and meatballs" style
of "Italian" food available down the street at Pascal's
restaurant.  The bank has demanded a payment by the end of the
month on their loan, and the brothers don't have the money.
Pascal, in a seeming fit of goodwill, has recommended the
brothers' restauarant to jazz great Louie Prima to hoist the
brothers out of debt and into the restaurant spotlight.  BIG
NIGHT covers the boys on their quest to serve the greatest meal
ever on the last night their restaurant is open.  In doing so,
the film brings up the themes of brotherly love and the myth of
the American dream.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the movie doesn't stick to that quest, instead
bringing in puzzling subplots about the romantic affairs of the
brothers.  Primo's affair with Ann (Allison Janney), a widowed
Florist, is cute but brings little to the plot.  Secondo's
relationship with his girlfriend Phyllis (Minnie Driver),
however, borders on the nonsensical.  Secondo refuses to make
physical advances to Phyllis, instead telling her that he wants
to wait until they are more financially secure.  Throughout the
film, Secondo ignores Phyllis, showing little attraction or
desire for her, and all of the exchanges between the two are
awkward.  We later find out that Secondo is having sex with
Gabriella (Isabella Rosellini), Pascal's mistress.  At the end
of the film, Secondo seems genuinely distraught that Phyllis,
after seeing Secondo and Gabriella together, wants nothing to do
with him -- something that I really had a hard time believing.</P>
<P>I don't mind not liking a character, but Secondo's motivations
in BIG NIGHT make so little sense that I truly had no idea why
he was doing the things he did.  It's not that his character was
an enigma, but that his actions are never adequately explained.
Later in the film, Secondo insists that he will stay in America,
after his brother reveals that he's lined up a job for both of
them at their Uncle's restaurant in Rome.  Why?  It's explained
only in the vaguest of ways.  While the plot expresses Primo and
Pascal's motivations clearly in the script, Secondo, the focal
character, wanders through the action making idiotic choices for
no explained reason.  Some of the most sympathetic characters in
film are shown as having made poor choices in life -- and it's
easy to sympathize with a character if they make a bad choice as
long as they had a good reason at the time to do so.  I don't
even mind characters who make completely arbitrary decisions
provided that the character's poor judgement is explained in the
film.  However, I get the feeling that Tucci wants us to
sympathize with Secondo, and to like him -- and other
individuals upon seeing the movie seem to have found him a
"likable" character -- but I found the character to be so
idiotic and unlikable as to spoil the rest of the film.</P>
<P>Ian Holm's portrayal of Pascal verges on the ridiculous.  Every
other word out of Holm is an obscenity filtered through an
obviously fake accent, and he comes off as being entirely
unconvincing as an Italian restauranteur.  The comedy in the
film is played as being extremely broad -- overstated reactions
are the norm (the "heavenly" reactions of those biting into
Primo's food are extremely overdone, and by the end of the film,
had me wincing every time any character had anything to eat).
Other than Tony Shaloub's sublime and noble Primo, the rest of
the characters have little depth.</P>
<P>While some of the food prepared by Primo looks truly delicious,
pictures of food are not enough to make me enjoy a film.  While
the static camerawork is acceptable, tracking shots and zooms
seem hesitant and jittery, strange for a film that lists a
Steadicam operator in its credits.</P>
<P>It seems equally strange for a movie that seems to value Primo's
sense of subtlety and richness in flavor of food so highly to
play the comedy in such an over-the-top way, to make only the
basest of observations on the topics it brings up...while
supplanting the film with shallow characters, little plot and
less than amazing camerawork.  So I ask the viewer of this
movie, as the choices this film makes seem less like Primo's
artistic virtuosity or Pascal's commercial mechanations, and
more close to the arbitrary decisions of Secondo, "What is BIG
NIGHT?"  To that, I answer, "confused" -- a quality that left me
with a bad taste in my mouth after the BIG NIGHT.</P>
