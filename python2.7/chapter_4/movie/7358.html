<P>        Well, I just came back from Broken Arrow, and I must say, I was
disappointed.  While I still enjoyed it, it could have been a lot
better.
        First of all, the good stuff:  The action scenes are awesome(of course,
this being a John Woo film, anything less would be horrific)and the
stunt work is impressive.  As for the acting, it ranges from the
Great(John Travolta, who can now play a bad guy whenever he wants) the
Good(Delroy Lindo, great as always in a small part) the
mediocre(Christian Slater needs work before trying another action hero)
to the awful(Samantha Mathis... acting lessons anyone?).  Travolta, as
the loony navy pilot who steals two nuclear weapons,  has a calm style
of villainy and wisely doesn't go over the top.  This shows best when he
calmly asks a bad guy: "Would you please be so kind as to not shoot at
the thermal nuclear device?"  A lesser actor would have screamed at the
guy and probably killed him for a cheap laugh.  Sometimes this works,
but sometimes we wish villains would stop being so damn hyperactive.
        As for Slater, he just doesn't fit my idea of an action hero.  And his
stiff, wooden delivery does nothing to convince me otherwise.  But
Mathis is much, much worse.  She has absolutely no purpose to the film
other than to tag along, be saved by Slater, take her shirt off, and
keep saying: "This is a bad idea!" once every 10 minutes.
        But my big problem is that not enough happens in the movie.  Basically
the entire movie can be summed up in one sentence: Travolta steals
bombs, and duels with Slater, first in a desert, and then on a train. 
An action film of this type needs more locations.  Raiders of the Lost
Ark probably had a dozen different battle grounds.  This film has two.
        Another problem is the lack of surprises.  The film opens with Slater
getting his brains punched out in a sparring match. Travolta tells him
he lacks the will to win.  Is this foreshadowing?  Anyone who has seen 4
action movies in a lifetime can probably guess exactly what is going to
happen and when.  How do we know that Travolta is a bad guy?  Well,
during the opening flight, he squints his eyes and the camera gives him
a looming close-up!! Uh, huh...
        Also, there seems to be a lack of emotion in this film.  If your best
friend pulled a gun on you, tried to kill you, then ejected you out of a
plane, only to try to blow you up many times, just to get rich, wouldn't
you be a little hurt?  Also, after all this, you are unable to talk your
buddy out of this plot, you are forced to beat him up and leave him to
die, wouldn't this sadden you a little bit?  The script fails to give
one line or reaction of sadness to Slater over the fact that his best
friend has betrayed his trust.
        The plot seems a bit simplistic.  Hell, all you have to do to start a
bomb is punch in a 5 digit code, and all you have to do to disarm it is
to enter the wrong code three times,  or get this, touch a single button
on a remote control.   And, yes, this film's bombs do have those
convenient red timers, counting the seconds till doom.  
        Still, I did like the film.  It was well paced, with some amazing
stunts and action sequences. John Travolta has a lot of fun playing a
heavy.   And it does let Slater pull the official "Woo Dive" which is
when someone jumps forward or backward, while firing one pistol in each
hand at an enemy.  This time, it's a forward, head first dive.  And,
when it came, those who understood cheered.        "B-"</P>
