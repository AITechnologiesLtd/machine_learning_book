<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
2 and a half stars</P>
<P>To its credit, Beloved is not a conventional period piece.  In fact,
there is really nothing ordinary in the themes that are explored in this
film.  Oprah Winfrey's labor of love that she nurtured for over a decade
is a peculiar and often unsettling mixture of horror and drama. The film
succeeds in crafting extraordinary characters and moments, but with an
almost three-hour running time one might question the existence of an
editor.  It's difficult to put a finger on what director Jonathan Demme
(Silence of the Lambs, Philadelphia) and the screenwriters are trying to
tell us, not because it is something incredibly profound, but rather
because there are too many subplots that detract from the story's
meaning.</P>
<P>Sethe (Winfrey) is a runaway slave who has a simple existence with her
daughter Denver (Kimberley Elise), in rural Ohio.  The year is 1873, and
an angry spirit haunts the house they live in.  Sethe's past, we learn,
contains disturbing memories of unforgettable sins, which seem to get
progressively worse as the film plods along.  The two are joined by Paul
D (Danny Glover), a former slave who stays with Sethe and Denver in the
hope of becoming a family.  But a mysterious guest who goes by the name
of Beloved (Thandie Newton) arrives on the scene.  Where she came from,
who she came with and why she is there is at first a mystery, but later
things are revealed as the past once again comes up to bite Sethe.</P>
<P>Although adapted from Toni Morrison's Pulitzer Prize winning novel,
Beloved doesn't seem very literate. There are moments in novels that
cannot retain much of their power once a conversion to film has been
made; that's just the way it is, I guess.  As easily as a picture can
tell a thousand words, words usually have greater meaning.  The pictures
that cinematographer Tak Fujimoto uses are very fine indeed, ranging
from the ghostly looking old house (which was built especially for the
film) to the grainy texture of the story's flashbacks.  Where Beloved
fails is sustaining power in its imagery; for all the disturbing images
evoked, the script doesn't have the power to back them up.  Illiterate
is not the right word - inferior, perhaps, is.</P>
<P>That's not to say that Beloved was a mistake to make, since Jonathan
Demme has a solid shot at getting it right.  He squeezes strong
performances from all of his cast, notably Oprah Winfrey and Danny
Glover.  Beloved's strange actions and manner of speaking no doubt
demanded a lot of talent from Thandie Newton, but her character
frustrated me for those reasons.  I was patiently waiting for Beloved's
emotional climax in which her actions would form a basis of
understanding for her character, but that never came.</P>
<P>Demme also directs with a flair for the bizarre, which isn't surprising
considering this is the man who turned the grim Silence of the Lambs
into an Oscar winning success.  Needless of how good the final product
turned out to be, Beloved deserves respect as an artistic creation that
ventures into the realms of the extraordinary, without losing sight of
what _makes_ something extraordinary.  But Beloved as a whole does not
fit into that category.  It is a film that attempts to be better than
most but ends up falling behind, primarily due to inefficient scripting
and editing.  To see an extraordinary film that is extraordinarily
made - now that would be something.</P>
