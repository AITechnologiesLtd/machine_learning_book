<P>     A funny thing happens when the characters start dancing in Whit
Stillman's THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO:  they stop talking.  Set in the early
1980s, the story follows several young people whose social lives revolve
around a super-trendy Manhattan disco referred to only as "the club."
Among them are Alice (Chloe Sevigny) and Charlotte (Kate Beckinsale),
roommates and co-workers as manuscript readers for a publishing house;
Jimmy (Mackenzie Astin), a junior advertising executive whose job depends
on getting potential clients into the club; Tom (Robert Sean Leonard), a
Harvard man Alice admires from afar; Josh (Matt Keeslar), an assistant
district attorney with a history of manic-depression; and Des (Chris
Eigeman), the club's womanizing assistant manager who ends his flings by
claiming to have discovered that he's gay.</P>
<P>     Most of the time, these characters do what characters in films by
Whit Stillman (METROPOLITAN, BARCELONA) typically do:  they engage in a
whole lot of urbane conversation.  They share views on the value of group
social activities versus "ferocious pairing-off."  They wax philosophical
on contemporary male-female relationship dynamics.  They complain about
being perceived as "yuppies" despite feeling that their career prospects
are limited.  They exchange observations on pop culture phenomena
(including how BAMBI sparked the environmental movement and LADY AND THE
TRAMP indoctrinated young girls into desiring "bad boys") like Tarantino
characters toting highball glasses.  They talk and talk and talk and talk
until amusement at their bon mots gives way to frustration as you begin
wishing you could grab every one of them by the collar and beg someone,
anyone to do something, anything.</P>
<P>     What they eventually do -- all they eventually do, really, besides
talk -- is dance.  For several seconds at a time, Stillman will hold the
camera on a couple doing their clumsy middle-class boogieing to Chic or
Diana Ross or Evelyn "Champagne" King with nary a sound to be heard but
the tunes.  These moments anchor a two-pronged approach by Stillman to the
disco culture.  On the one hand, he clearly appreciates selected songs
from the much-derided genre, and enjoys providing a showcase for some of
the livelier, funkier numbers (including a surreal closing scene with
subway riders jumping up to the O'Jays' "Love Train").  On the other hand,
he doesn't seem to care much for the disco environment, a haven for drugs,
corruption, sexually-transmitted diseases and ultimately disappointing
pairings of convenience, all tarted up to be irresistably hip.  For an
inveterate gab-meister like Stillman, the disco is practically his concept
of hell -- a vacuous place where people fall into bed together after
having shared only token words.</P>
<P>     The social angle is occasionally intriguing, but you have to wade
through an awful lot of tediousness and sloppy plotting to get to it.
It's hard to keep track of the various romantic permutations in THE LAST
DAYS OF DISCO, not because Stillman tears through the narrative at a
breakneck pace but because his characters are so interchangeably earnest
and clever.  The notable exceptions are Eigeman (a veteran of Stillman's
previous features) and Beckinsale, who at least add a bit of self-absorbed
spice to the proceedings.  Otherwise it's not easy to care about who ends
up with whom, or why Stillman muddles through plot devices like an
undercover investigation of the club's finances while abandoning the
repercussions of one of Alice's one-night stands.  The scattered comic
high points are too subdued to overcome the incongruity between the
subject matter and Stillman's approach to it.  For a film about the
flame-out of a flashy era, THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO is just too languid and
verbose.  Only for those few moments when the music starts and the talking
stops does the film feel like it's got to be real.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 discothequeniques:  5.</PRE>
