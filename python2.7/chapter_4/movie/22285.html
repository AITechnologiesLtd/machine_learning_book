<P>STUART LITTLE, featuring the voices of Michael J. Fox and Nathan Lane; starring
Geena Davis, Hugh Laurie, Jonathan Lipnicki, Julia Sweeney and David Alan
Grier.  Directed by Rob Minkoff.  1999.</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by John Carroll.</PRE>
<P>   Ever since The Adventures of Roger Rabbit, the combination of live action
and computer generated grpahics or animation has always been a big ticket for
studios.  Stuart Little puts a computer generated mouse in the main seat,
voiced by Michael J. Fox, and while it may not be a great movie, it is still
solid and a good view...As long as you have already seen the wonderful Toy
Story 2.</P>
<P>   The curse a lot of "cute" movies suffer is that they are too cute, too fast.
 The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland suffered from this, but luckily, Stuart
Little manages to keep most of your interest by trying to play Stuart as funny,
not cute.  While these attempts at humor do not always succeed, it nonetheless
is much better than just flashing Stuart's face to get a few "awww"s from the
audience.  This one aspect alone keeps Stuart Little afloat.</P>
<P>   The main cast, aside from Stuart, consists of the Little family.  Mrs.
Little, played by Geena Davis, Mr. Little, played by Hugh Laurie and George
Little, played by Jonathan Lipnicki.  Considering it is a children's movie,
acting does not need to be impeccable.  The cast is sufficient enough,
especially considering that Stuart is on-screen most of the time, and
rightfully so.  The film drags when human interaction takes place, as sad as
that may seem.  Even so, the film moves along at a rapid pace, but still seems
to drag on despite its attempts.</P>
<P>   Michael J. Fox voices Stuart, and Nathan Lane voices Snowbell, the cat who
is Stuart's archnemesis for most of the film.  The interaction between these
two characters brings most of the laughs throughout the film.  The rivalry that
exists brings up some good jokes, and some off-beat humor for the children. 
The reason these interactions are so successful is becuase when humans enter
the scenario, the film takes itself way too seriously.  While most children's
films always have a lesson, this one misses a definite lesson, and tries to
play on your emotions.  Unfortunately, an emotional bond with the characters is
never devloped to extract this type of emotion, that is until the end, and at
that point, it seems the director, Bob Mikoff, just gives up trying.</P>
<P>   The blend of Stuart into his live action enviroment is decently done,
although it does seem very staged a lot of the time.  It is a very difficult
process to act with a ten-inch character who is represented by an "X" on the
floor, and at some points during Stuart Little, this is very noticable.</P>
<P>   Overall, Stuart Little turns out to be an average children's movie.  The
movie takes no children's issue at heart, and tries to be sentimental at the
same time.  As you watch Stuart Little, you want to feel some emotion towards
the characters, and aside from Stuart and Snowbell, all you feel is boredom. 
In the end, however, Stuart Little is a decent film for a rainy day.  Although
Toy Story 2 is the best film out there, and probably worth a second look,
Stuart Little can deliver on some levels, just do not expect the wit and
lessons of Toy Story 2.</P>
