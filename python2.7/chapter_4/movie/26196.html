"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>If you liked Waiting for Guffman, you'll love Best in Show.  Both films
were directed by Christopher Guest and largely improvised by similar
ensemble casts.  Guest has clearly perfected the `mockumentary,' a craft
he honed as a performer and writer on Rob Reiner's classic film This is
Spinal Tap.  This time out, Guest point his cynical lens at a ripe
target – dog shows.</P>
<P>Show begins with a scene featuring two yuppie attorneys from suburban
Illinois (Michael Hitchcock, Happy Texas and Parker Posey, Scream 3).
You think they're getting advice from a marriage counselor, but as the
scene unfolds, it becomes clear that the couple is really speaking to a
pet psychiatrist (it's been done before in Bruce McCulloch's Dog Park,
but that's a minor complaint).  It seems that Meg and Hamilton Swan are
concerned that their Weimaraner, Beatrice, suffered severe psychological
damage when she saw them having sex.</P>
<P>The kooky Swan's are just the tip of the iceberg.  Show's other dog show
participants include:</P>
<P>· Harlan Pepper (Guest) and his bloodhound, Hubert.  They live in
backwoods Pinenut, North Carolina, where Pepper runs a bait and tackle
shop called The Fishing Hole.</P>
<P>· Gerry and Cookie Fleck (Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara from SCTV)
and their Norwich Terrier, Blinky.  Based in Fern City, Florida, the
Flecks are living proof that opposites attract.  Gerry has two left feet
(literally) and resembles Kirk Van Houten from The Simpsons, while
Cookie's past sexual promiscuity becomes a running gag in the film.</P>
<P>· Stefan Vanderhoof (Michael McKean, Mystery, Alaska), Scott Donlan
(John Michael Higgins, Bicentennial Man) and their Shih Tzu, Miss
Agnes.  This homosexual couple from Tribeca are, respectively, a
hairdresser and a professional dog handler.</P>
<P>· Sheri Ann Cabot (Jennifer Coolidge, Stifler's mom from American Pie),
Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch, What Planet Are You From?) and Rhapsody In
White, a `Standard' Poodle.  Sheri Ann is a buxom blonde married to a
man with one foot in the grave (Patrick Cranshaw from Guest's Almost
Heroes).  Christy is Rhapsody's butch trainer, and the defending
two-time champion of the Mayflower Dog Show.</P>
<P>Each of these dogs competes in the prestigious Mayflower event in
Philadelphia's top kennel club (a knock-off of New York's Westminster
Show), which is celebrating its 125-year of competition.  The first
round of the contest chooses the best dog from each breed.  The winners
of each breed compete for the coveted `Best in Show' award for the top
dog.</P>
<P>The show is hosted by two television commentators – one well informed
and serious (Jim Piddock, Mad About You) – the other a hysterically
clueless boor (Fred Willard, Austin Powers 2).  Their banter is easily
the funniest part of the film (I've got my fingers crossed that there
will be more on the DVD).</P>
<P>In addition to rousing drop dead hilarious performances from his cast,
Guest also adds in little touches that you might miss the first time
around.  Like the row of clocks that all give the same time behind the
front desk of the Mayflower competitor's hotel (signs underneath each
clock let you know that they're all for east coast cities, like
Baltimore, New York and Boston).</P>
<P>Show was loosely written by Guest and Levy, who also framed the story
for the critically acclaimed Guffman.  It's a big step in the right
direction after Guest bombed with 1998's non-mockumentary debacle Almost
Heroes.  There isn't one thing that would have made Show a more
enjoyable film (other than making it longer).  You won't see a funnier
film this year.</P>
<P>1:30 – PG-13 for language and sex-related material</P>
