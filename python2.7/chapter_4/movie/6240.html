<P>     Here's another long sit-- an elaborate revenge fantasy based, for
all we know, on events that best-selling author Lorenzo Carcaterra
pulled out of his butt.  (The story is supposedly true.) Written for the
screen and directed by Barry Levinson (DISCLOSURE, TOYS), SLEEPERS is a
textbook example of bad-choice filmmaking.  Jason Patric's impoverished
narration sets the tone of something's-not- right and the rest of the
movie is just as wrong.  My favorite flub is the entire third act, which
is too cramped to be comprehensible.  I mean, there's a good twenty
minutes in there where *nothing* makes sense.  Who are these adult
characters?  And why should we care about them?  The plot keeps surging
forward, with momentum in its sails and believability in its wake.
(Most disappointing are all those could've-been-better bits, such as
Brad Pitt feeding Dustin Hoffman his lines in court.  We need to savor
such scenes.) Yeah, this movie is easy on the eyes.  Yeah, enough
happens on- screen to pass the time.  Just don't expect to enjoy what
you're watching.</P>
