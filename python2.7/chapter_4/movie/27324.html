<PRE>WHEN HARRY MET SALLY...
A film review by James Brundage

<P>It was the 80s, the time when acid washed jeans went, the Ephrons could
turn out a decent script, Rob Reiner could direct something worth
watching, and Billy Crystal hadn't succumbed to the sequel curse.  And
Meg Ryan?  Well, Meg Ryan's still pretty much Meg Ryan: sickeningly Top
40, an actress who seemingly lives in fear of picking a role that could
be too controversial (never mind her recent marital scuffle).</P>
<P>When Harry Met Sally... closed out a decade fondly remembered by Grosse
Pointe Blank and Romy and Michele's High School Reunion and darkly
satirized by Bret Easton Ellis' American Psycho.  It's a romantic comedy
that has spawned a plethora of knockoffs so terrifying that, like its
counterparts in all other genres, it may have been better if the script
were never penned, if only to save us from the aftermath.  But still, we
have to give When Harry Met Sally... credit for what it did: Make one of
the few romance films that bears any kind of truth without also being a
dark comedy.</P>
<P>Two people who want absolutely nothing to do with each other in the
beginning of the story, Harry Burns (Billy Crystal) and Sally Albright
(Meg Ryan) end up driving together to move into separate apartments in
New York City after they both graduate from college.  By the time they
reach the Big Apple, they're talking about their disbelief that
friendship and sex can coexist, and as we all know from experience (and
now cliché) they eventually hook up -- it's unavoidable.</P>
<P>Rather than make the mistake that countless copycats have by making
their tryst a quick cut away from a sex scene to appease the MPAA, When
Harry Met Sally... takes its time to the inevitable end.  And I mean
takes its time: For 10 years Harry's and Sally's paths weave back and
forth like Robert Downey Jr. trying to walk the white line.  At
years-long intervals they befriend each other, drift apart, befriend
each other again, and, at long last, find themselves testing their own
theory (to the inevitable happy ending).</P>
<P>As for why When Harry Met Sally... still contains cinematic merit a
dozen years after its initial release, it actually has all of the
strengths that make a movie last.  Nora Ephron's dialogue is sharp,
witty, and intelligent, Billy Crystal shows us a movie in which he
(mostly) acts instead of does a stand up routine with other actors
present, Rob Reiner directs a simple story instead of trying to preach
on God-knows-what-tangent, and even run-of-the-mill Meg Ryan takes a
huge risk with her squeaky clean image by faking an orgasm in a deli (a
now-legendary scene worth the rental alone).  And don't forget Harry
Connick Jr.'s stellar soundtrack.</P>
<P>While to this day it is a mark of masculine shame to admit to actually
liking the movie, I personally am not afraid to give it my seal of
approval.  And I'm awfully manly.</P>
<P>[Editor's Note: The new DVD release features a ton of extra footage,
commentary track, and a making-of documentary.  Worth checking out.]</P>
