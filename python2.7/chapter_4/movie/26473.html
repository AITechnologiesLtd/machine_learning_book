<PRE>WAY OF THE GUN</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * * 1/2</PRE>
<P>Directed by: Christopher McQuarrie
Written by: Christopher McQuarrie</P>
<P>Mr. Parker (Ryan Phillippe) and Mr. Longbaugh (Benicio Del Toro) are two 
lazy fellows who spend their days unemployed and making cash off petty theft 
and trips to the sperm bank (I think their names were an homage to 
Tarantino's "Reservoir Dogs"). One day they hear about a woman, Robin 
(Juliette Lewis), who is carrying the child of a millionaire named Chidduck 
(Scott Wilson). So, the two decide to kidnap Robin and ransom her back to 
Chidduck for fifteen million dollars. The catch is, Chidduck works with the 
mob and soon has his army of goons, led by the world weary Joe Sarno (James 
Caan), after our daring duo. So the two and their kidnappee are now on the 
run, and right on their tails are Sarno, Chidduck's two chief bodyguards 
(Taye Diggs, Nicky Katt), and a young doctor named Allen Painter (Dylan 
Kussman), who may be more than just Robin's doctor. In the meantime, 
everyone is backstabbing everyone. One of the bodyguards, Jeffers (Taye 
Diggs), is sleeping with Chidduck's wife, Francesca (Kristin Lehman); Allen 
Painter is plotting against everyone; and Sarno has a personal interest in 
the affair and is willing to kill anyone for his own inscrutable purposes. 
In fact, the only people who aren't scheming are Parker and Longbaugh.</P>
<P>Sound a little confusing? Well that's because it is. Yet nearly every fault 
with Christopher McQuarrie's (writer of the brilliantly twisted "The Usual 
Suspects") "Way of the Gun" can be attributed to one man: the editor, 
Stephen Semel (he also edited "Three to Tango", which explains a lot). "Way 
of the Gun" is a good movie which could have been a lot better if about a 
half hour of its running time had been cut out. The film starts off with a 
bang, as our two protagonists get mobbed in a fight for sitting on a guy's 
car. After the rather long opening credits it stays interesting as the duo 
plans the kidnapping and then carries it out. Yet just as I was getting my 
hopes up things start to lag - a lot. So my hopes began tumbling through the 
floor, and things pick up again. Then come crashing back down. You get the 
general trend here? This keeps happening till the film's climax, which 
actually managed to run longer than the climax to "What Lies Beneath". The 
climax, while entertaining, wears out its welcome after about fifteen 
minutes (yes, it's that long). Then, finally, after this roller-coaster ride 
of a movie, the film just sort of stops. I was starting to think Hollywood 
writers, particularly an intelligent Oscar winner like McQuarrie, had 
learned how to end a movie. Guess I was wrong.</P>
<P>"Way of the Gun" does feature an impressively large and talented cast. 
Leading the cast is Ryan Phillippe ("Cruel Intentions"), who I usually think 
has about as much acting talent as your average parking meter. Yet he proves 
me wrong here, giving an adequate performance which might even have 
qualified as good if it wasn't held up next to Benicio Del Toro's ("The 
Usual Suspect") performance for comparison. Del Toro gives an awe inspring 
turn and I only hope he is recognized by at least one awards committee out 
there at year's end. Next up we have Juliette Lewis ("What's Eating Gilbert 
Grape"), playing the film's only truly sane character. She does a good job 
with her speaking lines, but her portrayal of a pregnant woman just doesn't 
work. I've seen pregnant women walk, even women due to give birth at any 
time, and they don't waddle around like large penguins. James Caan ("Mickey 
Blue Eyes") does a surprisingly good job as the bag man, Sarno. Taye Diggs, 
who was the very definition of cool in "Go" plays a similar, though far 
colder character here. The only weak link (but what a weak link it is) is 
Dylan Kussman ("Dead Poets Society"). It doesn't help that this guy gets the 
film's only really bad dialogue (a monologue about how his life turned out), 
but I think he could have made even the best dialogue sound like your 
average highschool playwright wrote it. Nicky Katt ("Boiler Room") is given 
very little screen time as the other bodyguard, but watch for a quick 
appearance by SNL's Sarah Silverman as a raving girlfriend.</P>
<P>Let me first cover the things that really work in "Way of the Gun". First, 
the dialogue is quite wonderful. McQuarrie's dialogue in "The Usual 
Suspects" was good (who doesn't know the line about the greatest trick of 
the devil?), but some of the dialogue in this film puts it to shame. One of 
my favorite lines was: "You wanna know what I'm gonna tell god when I meet 
him? I'm gonna tell him I was framed." There's also a great scene where 
Parker, Longbaugh, and Robin sit down to play hearts. Longbaugh and Parker 
explain the rules to Robin, but everything they say has an intentional 
double meaning about her situation. "Do you understand the game?" Parker 
coldly asks, and Robin breaks down crying. Second, the story is strangely 
interesting, if a little bizarre. No, I don't mean interesting like, "Gee, 
I've never seen a building fall down like that before." I mean McQuarrie 
takes what could have been a basic kidnapping story and turns it into a 
clever, Tarantinoesque tale where everyone is plotting against everyone, and 
there's a surprise waiting around every turn. Finally, the film's score, by 
composer Joe Kraemer, is a wonderful blend of Spanish style music; soothing, 
slow segments; and fierce melodies used during the many gun fights.</P>
<P>On the downside, we obviously have the editing. All I can figure is the film 
was made and released before Stephen Semel even had a clue what was going 
on. I don't mean the movie was poorly edited, I mean it appears to have 
skipped the editing process entirely. The film also suffers from a fairly 
poor ending. Not only does it go on far too long, but the gunfights go from 
being interesting and even realistically made, to tedious and video game 
like. This becomes even more true when a group of bag men show up at the 
film's end for no other purpose than to act as human targets. Last we have 
McQuarrie's direction. Was it bad? No, it was actually rather promising. 
However, this being his first time in the director's chair, his inexperience 
is painfully obvious in the way he paces the film. So, while I enjoyed "Way 
of the Gun", I have no desire to see it again. If you are interested in 
seeing it, I'd suggest catching a matinee or waiting for video (given its 
poor performance at the box office it shouldn't take long to get there. The 
film runs far too long at 119 minutes, which could easily have been cut to 
100 if not 90. I give it three and a half out of five stars.</P>
