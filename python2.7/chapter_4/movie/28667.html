<PRE>"Snatch" </PRE>
<P>The heist of a flawless, 84 carat diamond, fixed bare knuckle fights, Irish 
gypsies and a dog are just some of the goings on in director Guy Ritchies's 
sophomore feature, "Snatch." </P>
<P>"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" intro'd helmer/scripter Ritchie with 
a hyper-kinetic, in your face underworld comedy that grabbed the viewer's 
attention from beginning to end. His protagonists were innocents set adrift 
in a see of sharks to swim or be eaten alive. With "Snatch," the director 
doesn't remake his first work, but he does delve more deeply into the 
criminal underbelly of London, mining a rich collection of characters in 
the process. </P>
<P>>From the very beginning, "Snatch" tosses you into the action with the theft 
of the fabulous diamond, the desire of New York gangster Avi (Dennis 
Farina). En route from Antwerp, diamond thief and courier Frankie Four 
Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) stops in London to make a separate deal with 
Avi's partner and cousin, Doug "The Head" (Mike Reid). Frankie's addiction 
to gambling tempts him into making a bet on an illegal boxing match for 
Boris "The Blade" (Rade Sherbedgia), a ruthless Russian mobster. The bet 
turns out to be a setup for a robbery by a trio of bumbling incompetents - 
Vinnie (Robbie Gee), Sol (Lennie James) and portly Tyrone (Ade)- that goes 
miserably awry. </P>
<P>Meanwhile, a couple of young toughs, Turkish (Jason Stratham) and Tommy 
(Stephen Graham), are trying to break in to the boxing game with the help 
of local villain Brick Top (Alan Ford), who also owns a pig farm. When 
their first fighter is put out of action, with one punch, by a wild Irish 
gypsy named Mickey O'Neil, they figure to put the loose canon in as the 
contender in a fixed fight. Mickey proves less than reliable and goes 
against Turkish and Tommy's deal. Brick Top, impressed by Mickey's 
performance, decides to gives them another chance - after calmly explaining 
that it takes 16 pigs about eight minutes to completely devour a corpse. </P>
<P>When Avi doesn't get his precious rock, he jumps on a plane for London and 
hires a local legend, "Bullet Tooth" Tony (Vinnie Jones), to find Frankie 
and the diamond. Things spiral out of control as all these forces head on a 
collision course of double-cross and double-deals - and a dog that ate a 
squeaky toy. </P>
<P>Guy Ritchie (Mr. Madonna to some) is an extraordinarily talented auteur who 
has a wonderful knack for pulling together his unique collection of cast 
and crew and feeding them funny and gritty dialog that spews out of the 
characters' mouths like machine gun fire. The helmer marshals his large 
ensemble actors in a frantically paced caper comedy that makes you laugh 
and feel queasy at the same time, the above description by Brick Top being 
just one example. </P>
<P>The assemblage of actors and non-actors in rough-and-tumble settings gives 
"Snatch" an earthy feel in its depiction of London's criminal underworld. 
The cast of characters is too large to credit here, but two of the 
performances - first among equals, you might say - are worth noting. Alan 
Ford is brilliant as the ruthless, evil Brick Top. When he refuses sugar in 
his tea because "I'm sweet enough," it makes you shiver, even as you laugh. 
His is one of the best gangster characters I've seen in years. </P>
<P>The other outstanding perf is given by none other than Brad Pitt, the name 
actor the movie's popularity may hang upon, at least initially. Pitt, as 
Mickey O'Neil, is hard drinking, hard fighting, highly unreliable and 
nearly incomprehensible with a unique Irish brogue and dialect of the 
pikers, the Irish travelers of Europe. This gypsy brigand would steal the 
fillings from your teeth, especially if it would benefit his beloved mum 
(Sorcha Cusack). When Brick Top threaten the safety of Mickey's family, he 
makes an enemy that cannot be stopped. Pitt puts a credible spin on his 
character and does some incredible physical stuff, too, as a bare-knuckle 
boxer. </P>
<P>The production team behind the camera includes Ritchie alumni, producer 
Matthew Vaughn and lenser Tim Maurice-Jones, and other talented technical 
artist that bring the hyperactive imagination of the author to visual life. 
There is a patent feel to the look of "Snatch" and "Lock, Stock and Two 
Smoking Barrels" that reeks of "signature" for Ritchie, but I'm not sure 
how this will translate in his future works. There is so much talent in the 
filmmaker that I would like to see him branch out in other directions. 
Nonetheless, "Snatch" is terrific sophomore effort, a darn good action 
comedy and a hoot to boot. I give it a B+. </P>
