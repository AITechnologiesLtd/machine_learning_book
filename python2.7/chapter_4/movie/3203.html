<PRE>                             IMMORTAL BELOVED
                       A film review by Eric Grossman
                   Copyright 1995 LOS ANGELES INDEPENDENT</PRE>
<P>     January may be the wet season for weather but it is the dry season
when it comes to movies.  Having fired the last of their big guns for
Oscar contention and still completing their new blockbusters for spring
and summer, January typically consists of movie dregs.  Fortunately,
there are leftover goodies from December.  Such is the case with
IMMORTAL BELOVED, an engaging new film about the life and loves of
Ludwig Van Beethoven.</P>
<P>     The movie begins just after Beethoven's death.  His trusted
friend, Anton Schindler (Jeroen Krabbe), discovers a cryptic letter
from the late composer stating that  all of his possessions and money
are to be left to his "Immortal Beloved."  Since the letter does not
state specifically who the beneficiary is, Schindler sets out to find
Beethoven's mystery woman.   In the course of his search, he discovers
several  of Beethoven's love interests and as they talk, the film fades
into flashbacks where Gary Oldman plays the famous figure at various
stages of his life.</P>
<P>     Part love story, part mystery, writer/director Bernard Rose
provides a great deal of atmosphere and passion in this movie.  Using
powerful visuals and highly effective sound design, Rose takes us into
the mind of Beethoven.  We hear what he cannot and see what the music
creates in his mind.  There is one shot in particular that I think
everyone who sees this film will remember.  During the Ninth Symphony,
we see a boy running through the forest until he reaches a lake and
lies down.  When the music climaxes, we pull away from the boy until he
is lost in an oblivion of stars.  The image fits so well with the music
that if there was a best shot award for last year, this one would be
the winner.</P>
<P>     Beethoven was a great composer, but as a human being, he gives Ty
Cobb a run for his money.  After his brother died of consumption,
Beethoven stole away his nephew from the widow.  He had a terrible
temper and was self-centered, although much of this can attributed to
the frustration of losing his hearing, a sense so important to him that
its loss was enough to push him over the edge.  Oldman plays the man
without judgment and we are left with the right balance of fascination
and disgust for his character.  His performance is one of controlled
ferocity, with rising fits of love and anger that captivate but never
fall into the realm of over-acting.</P>
<P>     A strong supporting cast includes Isabella Rossellini as the
beautiful, Hungarian Countess, Anna Marie Erdody, a woman who was in
love with the man as much as his music.  Valeria Golino plays Julia
Guicciardi, a former Countess who is the opposite of Anna Marie.  Julia
is completely enthralled with Beethoven's music, so much so that she
overlooks his faults.  Jeroen Krabbe does a fine job in his role as
Schindler, the character who leads the audience on their journey
through the film.   Other cast members include Johanna Ter Steege and
Marco Hofschneider as Carl, Beethoven's nephew.</P>
<P>     Shot in Prague which doubles for Vienna, the film is filled with
stunning locations.  Cinematographer Peter Suschitzky deserves extra
recognition for the outstanding lighting and shot design.  Film editor
Dan Rae finds the right pace and effectively weaves the images to Nigel
Holland's sound design.  Jiri Hlupy's production design and Maurizio
Millenotti's costumes are of the highest order.  Of course, the real
star of the film is the music, all taken from Beethoven's compositions
by music director Sir George Solti of the London Symphony Orchestra.</P>
<P>     Now in wide release, IMMORTAL BELOVED is the answer to the
January movie blues.  Bernard Rose has combined great filmmaking with
great music to create a film that both educates and entertains.</P>
