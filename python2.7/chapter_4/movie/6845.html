<PRE>                         EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>I screamed all the way through Woody Allen's latest film, stopping only
to catch my breath but maintaining a fixed grin.  Only Allen could have
pulled off so many outrageously funny scenes.  No other writer would
have thought of the scenes that Allen envisioned; no other director
would have dared attempt those scenes if he had ever thought of them;
and no other director could have made the scenes come off perfectly.
Genius.</P>
<P>When Allen realized no one had made a musical in some ten years it
immediately hit him that that is what he should be doing . . . except
it would be an Allen musical than which there are nor ever have been
anything similar.  The songs used in the film, of the 1930s and 1940s
era, are nostalgic but Allen does not rest on that;  the songs have to
further the story, not be inserted merely because they are melodic.
When the engaged-to-be-married Holden and Skylar break up, (Edward
Norton and Drew Barrymore), Holden sings "I'll Never fall In Love
Again."   This holds true for all the approximately 25 songs used. . .
always either carrying the story along or describing the emotions of
the singer.</P>
<P>Every scene is a belly laugh . . . even when tinged with a bit of
nostalgia.  Try these: The engagement ring, the funeral parlor, the
Groucho homage, the hospital, Steffi (Goldie Hawn) and  Joe  (Woody
Allen), ex-wife and her husband, doing a dance.  Then there is
Halloween, there is Charles Ferry (Tim Roth), an ex-convict who is
invited to her home by the liberal Steffi.  And Itzhak Perlman and
Julia Roberts and Alan Alda . . . and on and on.</P>
<P>If a good story about dysfunctional families means anything; if great
entertainment and feeling good mean anything; if brilliant writing and
fast-paced  direction mean anything for Oscar consideration, Woody
Allen and Company deserve a clean sweep. Don't miss the cinema genius
of our times as he works his magic.</P>
