<P>"HALLOWEEN: H20" -- Reviewed by Paul K. Bisson</P>
<P>What's the difference between a good film and a bad one?  Or, more to
the point, what would make a potentially bad movie good?  If there was
just one element that could make an otherwise mediocre flick worth
it's eight buck admission, what would it be?  And what if this picture
was a sequel?...A sequel with the number "7" in the title?</P>
<P>Well, sometimes, it all comes down to one thing.  In this case:
nostalgia.  That's the reason "HALLOWEEN: H2O" worked for me.  In
fact, that's the only reason it worked for me.</P>
<P>Good or bad, say what you will about the modern horror movie.  But be
sure not to deny the fact that in 1978, John Carpenter's "HALLOWEEN"
changed the face of it with what has since become known as the
"slasher genre."  That's big stuff.  Unusual.  But not entirely rare.
Hitchcock did it with "PSYCHO."  Craven & Williamson did it with
"SCREAM."  But while "PSYCHO" shocked an unprepared generation with it
and "SCREAM" redefined it, "HALLOWEEN" pushed us headlong into the
core of it.</P>
<P>And any Hollywood producer worth his weight in the industry would have
been crazy not to capitalize on the success of it.  There was the
"FRIDAY THE 13TH" franchise, followed by the "NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET"
series.  And, of course, "HALLOWEEN II-VI."  And while some of these
enjoyed moderate to huge successes, it wasn't long before "slasher"
became synonymous with a big fat "yawn."</P>
<P>So what's so special about another "HALLOWEEN" sequel?  Especially
after we've been spoiled by the intelligence and wit of "SCREAM" and
"SCREAM 2?"  Well, like I said, nostalgia.</P>
<P>There's something special about Jamie Lee Curtis returning to her
cinematic roots and reprising her role as Laurie Strode.  There's
something special about rediscovering this character, learning what
has happened to her in the last twenty years, understanding the person
she has become and why.  There's also something utterly fascinating
about a new confrontation with an old nemesis, the Shape she has
eluded all these years, her brother, Michael Myers.</P>
<P>20 years ago, Laurie Strode died in a car crash and Keri Tate was
born.  Now a divorcee with a seventeen year old son, Curtis gives a
credible performance as the older Strode/Tate, an overprotective
mother who holds the position as Head Mistress of a prestigious
private school.  Addicted to drugs and alcohol, she goes through life
seemingly normal on the outside but fighting an emotional battle
within, living in constant fear that one day her brother will track
her (and her son) down and finish what he started.</P>
<P>And as October 31st arrives, her fears become reality.  Most of the
students and faculty have gone on a camping trip for the holiday,
leaving a handful of pickings behind for the kill.  We know, from an
earlier scene, that Myers has located his sister and has set out to
find her.  From there the movie plays out as we expect it to and as it
should.  There's no guessing game here, no tricky surprises.  Just the
Bogeyman and Laurie Strode, together again for the first time in
twenty years.</P>
<P>Yes--kids are killed in a variety of ways, yes--there are stalking
chases, yes--there are bumps-in-the-night and sudden shocks.  But what
did you expect?  This is a horror movie.  It would have been nice to
know what Myers has been up to all these years (especially since the
movie ignores sequels 4-6).  It would be nice to learn more of the
evil that drives him (instead we are treated to a flashback of Donald
Pleasence's haunting monologue).  Yes, this movie could have provided
us with a few more insights and details.  But it doesn't give us that.</P>
<P>What it does give us are wonderful cameos by Janet Leigh (paying
homage to Carpenter's inspiration) and Nancy Stevens (reprising her
role as Dr. Loomis' Nurse Wittington from the original).  What it does
give us is Jamie Lee Curtis.  What it does give us is a final
confrontation between good and evil.  A Do Or Die re-match between the
masked villain that started it all and his, the original, scream queen
heroine.  All to the newly arranged orchestration of that menacing
little tune.</P>
