<PRE>                               WHAT ABOUT BOB?
                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  **1/2  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1991)</PRE>
<P>        WHAT ABOUT BOB? serves up Bill Murray's most delectable character,
and performance, in a long, long time.  Murray is both funny and tender in
the role of an obsessive-compulsive agoraphobe coming out of his shell.
Unfortunately, the rest of the cast doesn't measure up: Richard Dreyfuss,
as Bob's put-upon psychiatrist, is untypically uninspired--and Jill Hagerty
(who plays Dreyfuss' cookie cutter wife) gives what will probably end up
being the worst performance of the decade.</P>
<P>        The first of the movie half zips along smoothly, but then,
frustratingly, the film takes a disastrous nose dive.  Tom (DEAD POETS
SOCIETY) Schulman's disappointing script becomes more and more contrived
until--THUD--the movie ends with a painful belly flop.</P>
