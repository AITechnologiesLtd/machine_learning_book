<P>"Elizabeth once told me she was conducting a field investigation in
psychological warfare, and the enemy was Daddy."</P>
<P>Starring John Travolta, Madeline Stowe, James Cromwell, Timothy Hutton,
Clarence Williams, James Woods, Leslie Stefanson. Rated R.</P>
<P>I despise filmmakers that use plot exclusively as a means of getting
their movie exactly where they want it to go. Plot is a film's most
important element and it should be respected; attempts to manipulate it
for the sake of convenience will more than likely come back to haunt the
movie. The General's Daughter, a self-serving and sloppy new murder
mystery for John Travolta, is guilty as charged.</P>
<P>At the center of The General's Daughter is a mysterious rape and murder.
The victim is Captain Elizabeth Campbell, the daughter of a newly
retired military general (James Cromwell), which gives the case a high
profile and a desire by many to keep it under tight wraps. Thus, Officer
Paul Brenner (John Travolta), from the military's criminal investigation
division and his new rape-expert partner Sara Sunhill (Madeline Stowe)
are given 36 hours to investigate before the FBI comes in and any hopes
of keeping things quiet are destroyed.</P>
<P>Sooner than later, Brenner finds out about Elizabeth's spooky "extra-
curricular activities" such as an S&M fetish, complete with equipment
and violent porno tapes in a secret room in the basement. Some evidence
from the crime itself convinces his partner that this was no ordinary
rape. They then embark on a mission to "Go behind the lies", as the
movie's promotion immodestly trumpets and uncover the truth behind the
murder of Captain Elizabeth Campbell.</P>
<P>The General's Daughter, bless its soul, keeps the relationship between
Brenner and Sunhill completely platonic thereby avoiding the cliches
that plague movies that feature romances between two law enforcement
officials working together. Actually, I'm not even sure that the
filmmakers could have inserted a romance into this film if they tried --
its 115 minutes are already full to the brim. Alas that may be part of
the problem: there is sure a lot going on, but the story seems to have
been hastily put together and is not thought out thoroughly enough to
make so many plot elements blend together successfully. This is
especially evident in the ending, when the film apparently tries to give
us two separate explanations for what actually happened but never
bothers to sort it all out. I'm still not sure whether the first
solution we are given is merely an indirect approach to the second or
whether we are supposed to believe that Brenner never fully succeeded in
"going behind the lies".</P>
<P>Writer Christopher Bertolini and director Simon West (the man
responsible for Con Air, the only movie I know with a 50 minute climax)
are so concerned about the numerous details of the crime that they
completely forget about the characters at its core. Brenner and Sunhill
are little more than plot devices inserted to take us through the story.
We are never presented with any reason to care about these people or
what they do. Brenner is supposed to be a passionate man with a fierce
determination for uncovering the truth but the movie never tries to make
the character dynamic. How are we expected to give a damn about the
story if we can't get involved with its protagonists?</P>
<P>But what angered me the most about The General's Daughter is how it
winds up conveniently dispensing with anyone directly involved with the
crime so it can focus solely on its final theme. The movie knows what it
wants to say and is determined to say it even at the cost of sacrificing
plausibility and plot resolution. It's like a bulldozer making its way
to its final destination, blindly destroying everything in its path.</P>
<P>There is little in The General's Daughter to satisfy a viewer seeking
thrills and absolutely nothing to appeal to anyone seeking a
cinematically sound work. It's a movie that needs to go back to the
drawing board.
