<P>        Perhaps one of the greatest feelings one can experience while watching a film
is realizing how complex the story is and yet how easy it is to follow. It
takes a lot of effort and craftsmanship to construct a screenplay and film it
in such a way as to give the viewer this experience, therefore it's no
surprise "The Big Lebowski," which epitomizes this concept, is delivered to us
by veteran filmmakers Ethan and Joel Coen. </P>
<P>        From film to film the Coen brothers never fail to top themselves by making
their stories more bizarre and/or complicated, and yet still very enjoyable.
Just describing the basic elements that make up this film would prove this
idea as it manages to combine bowling, kidnapping, two wars, sadomasochist
art, pornography, washed-up rock stars, and many other things. But what's most
amazing is the fact the film is essentially a straight comedy, and yet an
intricate web of mystery, all strung together through a script chiseled to
perfection.</P>
<P>        Jeff Bridges stars as Jeffrey Lebowski - an L.A. roundabout who always seems
to be in his pajamas, whether he's bowling at the local lanes or smoking weed
in his apartment (that's about all he does). Lebowski hates his name and
prefers to be called "The Dude," and calls everyone else "Man," just like a
hippies (apparently, he hasn't been able to get over the 1960s). The film's
first joke perfectly establishes his character in just a few moments time as
we see him buy a quart of half & half at the supermarket by writing a check
for $0.68.</P>
<P>        Within a matter of minutes a conflict and plot are quickly thrown into the
mix as The Dude is mistaken for another Lebowski by slow-witted bookies who
have mistaken him for a millionaire by the same name (hence the film's title).
When one of the thugs "soils" his rug a hilarious scene of dialogue between
The Dude, and his raving Vietnam vet friend Walter (Goodman) and always-two-
steps-behind friend  Donnie (Buscemi) ensues. Immediately the atmosphere of
minute details is present as we are able to get a reading on these characters
and their situations through their conversations alone. Bridges is great, but
it is Goodman who is surprisingly affective here - always making for comedy
simply through attitude, not one-liners or slapstick.</P>
<P>        Soon the plot becomes complicated as The Dude get mixed up in the kidnapping
of The Big Lebowski's wife, as he is asked to deliver the money to the
kidnappers, but his efforts are hindered when Walter decides to help him out.
>From this point on the story keeps twisting and turning and never ceases to
surprise us in where it goes. Things never go according to plan in crime
movies, especially crime comedies, and The Dude is thrown from one strange
situation to another.</P>
<P>        If ever there was an example of the genus to this film's script, and to the
Coens in general, it would be how the film transitions itself from conflict to
conflict and even scene to scene. At no point in the film is it possible to
predict where it will go next, even the aforementioned examples of plot
devices would not act as spoilers. And what's most amazing is not just that
said examples could be used together, but that they are done so in such
original, enjoyable manners that anything less extraordinary would seem
incorrect.</P>
<P>        But it is not just the terrific scripting to the film that makes it great, it
is its comedic elements and outstanding acting which executes the script
flawlessly. Bridges and Goodman are both outstanding as they never kill their
character's personalities even when they say and do the same things over and
over again. Both are able to turn generic slapstick bits and the occasional
one-liners into fresh forms of comedy.</P>
<P>        "The Big Lebowski" is a film so grand on every level, it's almost frustrating
in trying to evaluate it for fear of over-looking elements. Still, it is
filmmaking at its best as every subplot, every scene, even every individual
line of dialogue and camera angle have meaning here, absolutely nothing is
wasted nor gratuitous. </P>
