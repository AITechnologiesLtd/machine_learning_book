<PRE>Elizabeth</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Shekhar Kapur</PRE>
<PRE>Written by Michael Hirst</PRE>
<P>Starring Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, Joseph Finnes, Richard Attenborough,
and Christopher Eccleston</P>
<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>     Of all of the things that Whoopi Goldberg said at the Academy Awards,
outrageous, often unfunny, and definitely uncreative as s most of them were,
the one most true was her opening.  Her opening stated, while she was
dressed in full Elizabethan regalia, that `this is a year about movies made
to honor me.'</P>
<P>     Elizabeth is one of the two movies with the Virgin Queen (hah!) of
England in them, the other, and far better one being Shakespeare in Love.
It follows Elizabeth, portrayed by a much thinner Cate Blanchett, through
being a princess to being the target of multiple assassination attempts to
eventually marrying herself to England.</P>
<P>     I will grant the film a point of merit on the account that, in my four
years of work as a film critic, I have never once watched a political
thriller set in the 16th century.  I will also grant it a few kudos on
performances, on costumes, on lighting, cinematography, and rather skilled
direction all together.  But, please, Best Picture?</P>
<P>     Normally, when viewing the nominations for the awards, some of them
(i.e. Sound F/Xs Editing and Special F/Xs) have only three nominees, three
films which were judged to be the best.  Why can't they do Best Picture the
same way?  This year we deserved tie between Saving Private Ryan,
Shakespeare in Love, and Life is Beautiful, three excellent films that all
equally deserved the prize.  However, as our shoo-in nominations we gave The
Thin Red Line, a nod (which it didn't deserve, although I maintain my
support of the film) and we also gave Elizabeth a tap on the shoulder.</P>
<P>     I can understand The Thin Red Line.  For one, it is a much better film.
For two, it was directed by Terrance Malick, a man who is the J.D. Salinger
(or Thomas Pynchon, if you prefer the truly postmodernist trend) of
filmmaking.  Here is a person who hasn't made a film in 20 years and still
hasn't lost his touch.  Counter this with the Shekhar Kapur, a man who has
never made a film I have heard about much less seen.  Not to say that a
first major work of a director isn't always a bad thing (i.e. David Lynch,
Jim Jarmush, Kevin Smith, Gus Van Sant), but please make it something that
just doesn't ride Hollywood's latest binge of the costume drama.</P>
<P>     I am not saying, mark you, that the film was bad.  Far from it, it is
actually one of the best films of the last year that I saw, but let us
contrast this with the concept that, in order for a film to be nominated for
Best Picture, it should display a mastery, not a plain old good job, of all
aspects of filmmaking.  Elizabeth, although featuring outstanding
performances, falters on storyline.  Were this political thriller set in
modern day, with the same performances, I would review it terribly.
However, it is not.</P>
<P>     Elizabeth does have certain interesting qualities, which are the only
aspects that make the film enjoyable.  For one, it displays a brilliantly
dark character in Geoffrey Rush's portrayal of Sir Francis Walsingham, a
cold-blooded killer.  Christopher Eccleston similarly gives an excellent
performance of the `villain' of the film, although with a movie like
Elizabeth, Mr. Hyde would seem like a nice guy.</P>
<P>     The biggest flaws in the film are very simple, and the same mistake
that A Perfect Murder made: all of the characters are so utterly unlikable
that the story has no hold over you.  Even knowing the ending (based on
history), I personally wanted Elizabeth to get killed.  It's not bad acting:
the acting was great.  It's bad parts.</P>
<P>     I will spend my last little bit complaining about the writer.  The
writer, a no one named Michael Hirst, will be completely forgotten after
this review.  Aside from people like Stephen Zallian, no one knows who
writes the movies, and thus this man will be forever forgotten for taking a
movie that had excellent potential and sinking it like a submarine in
`Battleship.'</P>
