<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>     "Yo." - U.S. Senator Jay Billington Bulworth</P>
<P>   That, in a word, sums up the appeal of Warren Beatty's project
   BULWORTH, essentially a one-gag premise stretched kicking and
   screaming to feature-length.  While the film's scathing concept is
   inspired and often wickedly funny, it's swamped by familiar
   extraneous material which subverts the comedy, and a sociopolitical
   message too jarringly self-conscious to mesh with the film's other
   elements.</P>
<P>   It's the eve of the 1996 California primaries, and we're at the
   "doorstep to a new millennium".  Incumbent Democratic Senator
   Bulworth (Mr. Beatty) is despondent -- his life is in a shambles, he
   hasn't eaten or slept in three days, and he's sick of spewing out the
   same meaningless deliberately-worded rhetoric -- so sick, in fact,
   that he's ready to end it all.  After ordering a hit on himself, he's
   obligingly trotted around Los Angeles by his handlers, led by
   media-savvy campaign manager Dennis Murphy (Oliver Platt), for a
   final round of campaigning.  Liberated by his impending mortality,
   Bulworth's free to throw caution to the wind, and he uncorks a
   barrage of decidedly politically-incorrect platitudes at his various
   stops, stunning and outraging his audiences and launching Murphy into
   a state of panicked spin control.  Ultimately transforming himself
   into a rapping homeboy of a senatorial candidate, complete with
   hip-hop duds, Bulworth also undergoes a political reawakening, and
   his rhyming, disarmingly blunt liberal tirades begin to strike a
   chord with the weary, seen-it-all populace.  Bulworth is reborn --
   but will he survive long enough to enjoy it?</P>
<P>   BULWORTH is at its best when it's at its most irreverent, with the
   newly-metamorphosized title character cheekily blurting observations,
   or strutting through the darkened streets of South Central backed by
   Cypress Hill on the soundtrack.  There's discernable glee when the
   senator is given an impromptu crash course on hip-hop culture during
   an all-night party, and it's often great fun to take in a wildly
   animated Bulworth incongruously bursting out into rap, but the gag
   begins to lose its bite after constant repetition -- how many times
   can we cut to the faces of scandalized spectators before the humour
   dissipates?  It's only through Mr. Beatty's engaging performance that
   this aspect of the film doesn't wear out its welcome.</P>
<P>   We've got the makings of a fine political farce here, but the film's
   raison d'etre is its underlying impassioned rant against the status
   quo political system, and here's where BULWORTH loses its footing.
   Mr. Beatty's a famously avowed liberal, and his convictions are
   clearly heartfelt, but his film skewers each of its meaty targets --
   from the impact of media manipulation to the role of politician as
   industry puppet to the touchy race issue in America -- in a manner
   that's not only lacking in eruditeness, but also rather simplistic
   and obvious.  The film allows its characters so much screentime to
   wax eloquently on the state of inner city life that it becomes
   painfully sermonic.  Corrupt officials, spin doctors, poll-watching,
   harassment of black youth by white cops: it's all been addressed in
   more sophisticated and thought-provoking fashion elsewhere.</P>
<P>   If the film spins its wheels with its sociopolitical commentary, it's
   with the hitman subplot where it swerves and crashes.  Distracting at
   best and aggravating at worst, this thread begins as a series of
   merely intrusive scenes involving the senator, associate Eddie Davers
   (Jack Warden), and faithful hit go-between Vinnie (Richard Sarafian),
   and quickly degenerates into mindless, annoying chase sequences, with
   Bulworth diving into shrubbery or burning rubber alongside mysterious
   new admirer Nina (Halle Berry) to evade a menacingly omnipresent
   suspected assassin.  Best left on the cutting room floor, this aspect
   of the film is a drain, failing to add any comic or dramatic
   interest, and comes off as a weak excuse to include some action in an
   already-kinetic movie.</P>
<P>   When I first saw the teasers for BULWORTH several months ago, my
   first though was that of cynical amazement that a film which
   superficially resembled AS GOOD AS IT GETS -- loud-talking
   protagonist cheerfully spewing racial jibes for comic effect -- could
   make it to market so quickly.  In fact, this is a film whose
   gestation period has been a long one; Mr. Beatty, who wears multiple
   hats on the project (star, director, producer, co-writer), took great
   deliberations in his pitch to Fox (only the barest plot outline was
   given, with all of the political and racial angles excised), and
   leveraged monies owed from DICK TRACY in order to assume total
   control.  This is clearly a personal project for Mr. Beatty, and he
   throws himself into the film with utter abandon -- rarely does an
   actor seem to be as filled with enthusiasm as he does here.
   Consistently amusing throughout, there's an extra bounce in his step,
   a delightful grin on his face that's infectious.  Mr. Beatty's a
   wonderfully awful rapper, and it's disarmingly funny to watch a
   sexagenarian employing street hand gestures and gleefully rhyming his
   way through a televised debate.  Taking a sizable risk, he pulls it
   off with flying colours -- Mr. Beatty's performance is by far the
   strongest aspect of BULWORTH.</P>
<P>   The remainder of the cast is more hit-and-miss.  Ms. Berry, a
   luminous onscreen presence, is nonetheless rather uninspiring as
   Bulworth's new devotee, playing Nina with such fierce remoteness that
   not only is she sufficiently ambiguous, she's also uncompelling; by
   the time the gloves are off in the third act, one can scarcely raise
   an eyebrow.  Meanwhile, Mr. Platt's a wonderful character actor and
   does what he can with his frazzled Murphy character, but he's given
   only a few notes from which to riff as the aggravated aide.</P>
<P>   Mr. Beatty has spent much of his life deeply involved in American
   politics, working alongside the likes of Robert Kennedy, George
   McGovern and Gary Hart, and with BULWORTH comes his opportunity to
   express some of his reflections and concerns on the direction the
   system is heading.  The elements are present for a spectacularly good
   political lampoon, but ultimately the film is most memorable not for
   the message it conveys, but the sight of the iconic actor swaggering
   around, microphone in hand, chanting lines like "Billions to Mexico
   and never have to fear / Coz taxpayers, taxpayers take it in the rear
   / Yeah yeah yeah".</P>
