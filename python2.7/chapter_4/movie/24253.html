AMERICAN GRAFFITI
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>Last few years it became very fashionable to portray 1970s
as the Golden Age. People that actually had to live in that
particular period had somewhat different perspective. In the
Gloomy Decade lamentation over kinder and gentler past was
quite fashionable. In 1973 George Lucas, young and unknown
film director at the time, was one of the first to profit on
such feeling of nostalgia. His semi-autobiographical drama
AMERICAN GRAFFITI, shot in four weeks with small budget,
turned out to be one of the most popular, and therefore,
most profitable films of the year. Financial success,
critical praise and "Oscar" nominations later allowed Lucas
to engage in the next and even more successful project -
STAR WARS.</P>
<P>The plot takes place in Modesto, small town in Northern
California during one night in summer of 1962. Curt
Henderson (played by Richard Dreyfuss) and Steve Bolander
(played by Ron Howard) are two high school graduates who are
about to travel back East next morning in order to enrol in
college. Two of them have different views on their immediate
future - Curt has some second thoughts about leaving
friends, familiar settings and carefree teenager lifestyle;
Steve is, on the other hand, quite adamant about going to
college, even if it jeopardises relationship with his long
time girlfriend and Steve's sister Laurie (played by Cindy
Williams). Steve, while trying to settle things with Laurie,
borrows his expensive car to Terry "The Toad" Fields (played
by Charles Martin Smith), nerdy friend who would use that
machine to cruise the town's strip and pick beautiful blonde
Debbie Dunham (played by Candy Clark). John Milner (played
by Paul Le Mat), the oldest of the bunch, has quite another
problem - during the course of his nightly cruise, he was
tricked into babysitting obnoxious 13-year old brat Carol
(played by Mackenzie Phillips), and while he tries to dump
her, new hotrod driver Bob Falfa (played by Harrison Ford)
challenges Milner's title of local drag race king.</P>
<P>AMERICAN GRAFFITI is often cited not only as one of the best
1970s, but also one of the best American films of this
century. On the other hand, its current popularity was
perpetuated, at least partially, by the later success of
STAR WARS and instant name recognition of its creator.
Overrated or not, AMERICAN GRAFFITI is a fine piece of
filmmaking. It has anything a good period film should have
-costumes, hairstyles, cars and other details characteristic
for the early 1960s, all shot by a good photography by Harry
Wexler (although some scenes look too dark at times). The
period atmosphere is also brought by almost semi-documentary
style in which Lucas shows us fast food restaurants, drive
ins, high school dances, night cruising, drag races and
other social customs of that era. The characters are well
written and played by a great ensemble cast of young and
unknown actors who would later (at least in most of the
cases) enjoy respectable careers, including Harrison Ford in
a small but very uncharacteristic role of villain. The music
is not original, but great nevertheless, with an excellent
collection of late 1950s and early 1960s songs that play
almost non-stop, followed by the voice of Wolfman Jack,
legendary DJ of the period who appears in a small but
memorable cameo role in the film.</P>
<P>However, this film, despite being very good, lost part of
its initial appeal through the passage of time. Some of the
flaws in the script by George Lucas and Gloria Katz are
becoming more transparent - like the lack of coherent plot
and adequate closure. Many situations and character types
became overused in multitude in later films that covered the
same period, turning AMERICAN GRAFFITI in large collection
of cliches and stereotypes. And even its message of growing
up and facing the world seems less universal than Lucas
wants to admit. Those who would understand this film the
most are still those who used to grow up in nearly fairytale
world of post-WW2 American prosperity and whose illusions
got shattered by Kennedy assassination, Vietnam and great
social turmoil that followed those traumatic events. The
others would probably have different perspective on this
film, but AMERICAN GRAFFITI still bears the mark of a superb
filmmaking talent.</P>
