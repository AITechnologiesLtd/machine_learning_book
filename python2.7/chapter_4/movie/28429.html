<P>Glory be, Halle was actually *good* in this one.  Maybe she should loose
her breastesses more often; removing that sling seemed to have had a
freeing effect on her acting.</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**)
Gabriel Shear (John Travolta) needs a few good men to help him liberate
nine billion dollars from a high-security government computer, to fund a
project which I will not spoil for you [unlike a few of my fellow
reviewers. But that's Another Rant For Another Time].  Enter Stanley
Jobson (Hugh Jackman), a former "hacker" [*cracker*, dammit!] who served
two years in prison for doing Bad Things to a computer that didn't
belong to him, and isn't allowed to see his daughter Holly (Camryn
Grimes) because her drunk shrew of a mother got a court order against
him.</P>
<P>Gabriel sends his assistant, Ginger (Halle Berry), off to recruit Stan
to break into the supercomputer, with promises of helping Stan regain
custody of Holly - not to mention a few million dollars of his own - as
incentive.  But Stan, who could go to prison for simply *touching* a
computer again, must elude the agent who put him away in the first place
- burnt-out cybercrimes supersluth Agent Roberts (Don Cheadle) - and try
to figure out how to survive Gabriel, aka The World's Most Dangerous Spy.</P>
<P>The Upshot:
Oh, I reckon I could kvetch about how SWORDFISH slung around
TechnoBabble like it was going out of style, and how laughingly AOL-ish
Stan's Graphical Hydra was ["You've Got Worms!"], and how Dell is making
beaucoup bux from product placement, and how this movie was chock full
of gratuitous dialogue and shots (and nope, I'm not just playa-hatin' on
Halle's Friends), and ultimately, how derivative SWORDFISH was of any
number of Summer Action Flicks (pick one, *any* one; start with John
Travolta's BROKEN ARROW, mix in DIE HARD, work a little SPEED in
there...you get my drift).</P>
<P>I reckon I could, but I won't - because SWORDFISH was exactly what it
set out to be: a straight-ahead Summer Testosterone Rush wrapped up in
Action Flick clothing.  I can diggit.</P>
<P>I have to admit, too, that Halle Berry really surprised me; she worked
this flick like nobody's business.  Berry and John Travolta left poor
Hugh Jackman in the dust (much in the way Christopher Walken walked all
over doe-eyed Johnny Depp in the similar daddy-struggles-to-save-his-kid
actioner, NICK OF TIME).  None of their characters were all that deep,
though at least they weren't completely predictable, or written wholly
in good/evil tones.  Yes, I gave a bah humbug to Gabriel's Declaration
of exactly who he was, but by that point in the movie, even the blatant
compugeek name-dropping ["Torvalds"? Guffaw!] or the underuse of Don
Cheadle and Vinnie Jones (Marco), didn't phase me anymore.</P>
<P>I do have one true complaint, though: the first 15 or so minutes, set a
"Matrix"-like pace that the next 80 or so minutes lived up to only
sporadically; let's just say that director Dominic Sena blew too much of
his action wad in the trailer (yes, I know; not his fault).  Still,
SWORDFISH was interesting - ok, I'll admit it: fun - even when it was
downright silly.</P>
<P>And the irony of Gabriel's monologue about Bad Movies - especially
considering Travolta's last two contributions to the world of Ugly
Cinema: LUCKY NUMBERS ad BATTLEFIELD EARTH - was completely delicious.</P>
<P>The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
If you've visited the 3BC "Viewer Voices" webboard lately (and if you
haven't, you should), you'll notice that some of us have been discussing
Halle Berry's decision to bare her breasts, for - as rumor would have it
(a rumor she's since denied) - $500,000 [another irony, considering what
the Stan character was paid to talk to her character's boss.  But I
digress].  Much of the discussion on the VV board centered around a
statement Berry was said to have made as to why she did her first
semi-nude movie scene; a 3BC reader saw an interview in which Berry was
quoted as saying:</P>
<P>   "For the first ten years of my film career, I've always said no
    to nudity. I wouldn't even read a script that called for nudity.
    But a lot has changed in my life...So, I finally feel free to
    explore myself as an artist. Not to say that the minute I got
    that revelation I decided to take my clothes off. But I feel
    free to make choices from an artistic standpoint, and that's a
    very empowered place to be.  But instead of focusing on a role
    you might not approve of, I'd like people to note that this was
    a role written for a white woman, opposite a big star like
    John Travolta.  Doesn't this take us to another level in the
    industry as black women?"</P>
<P>My take on the matter?  First, as long as she's not hurting anyone in
the process, I don't think Halle Berry owes anybody any explanations for
what she chooses to do with her body, on- or off-screen.  Like I said on
"Viewer Voices", if she decides to run around butt naked and pour baby
oil on her knees, that's her business.</P>
<P>But please, Ms. Berry, don't be fooled into thinking that showing your
Perky Tits (tm, alt.tv.homicide) is any Giant Leap For Blackwomankind,
especially as done in the (mostly gratuitous, though still effective)
SWORDFISH scene.  Political Statement, it ain't.  Not that Hugh Jackman
and half the men (and some of the women) in America, mind.  But you go,
girl, and don't sweat about having to Uplift The Race; uplift your
asking salary, even if you have to uplift your breasts to do it.  I
ain't mad atcha.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
Call it derivative, call it an homage, but SWORDFISH made me hungry
[nyuk nyuk] for a little DOG DAY AFTERNOON action.  I wonder if
(ObProductPlacement) Netflix's open this late at night...</P>
<P>SWORDFISH (rating: greenlight):
Wanna bet that Halle's Pups'll get nominated for two MTV Movie Awards?</P>
