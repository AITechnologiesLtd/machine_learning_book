<P>     One hallmark of great cinema is that, even when the story is 
tragic, a viewer can leave the theater both reflective and satisfied.  
JUDE, Michael Winterbottom's ambitious, big-screen adaptation of Thomas 
Hardy's heartbreaking classic, JUDE THE OBSCURE, fits perfectly into 
that category.  This is a film of tremendous scope and emotional depth 
that uncovers the soul of a novel and brings it to life on the screen.  </P>
<P>     In every way that matters, JUDE is faithful to its print 
inspiration.  The rhythm of some of the dialogue has been changed to 
make it sound more natural to contemporary viewers, and a number of 
minor characters have been deleted, but the story arc is rigorously true 
to Hardy's vision.  One of the great strengths of the novel is that it 
centers on two believable, sympathetic characters.  JUDE effectively 
captures not only their humanity, but their uniqueness, fashioning a 
delicate rapport between them and the audience.</P>
<P>     For a widescreen period piece, JUDE is surprisingly subtle in 
presenting its setting.  Any time you study the background, you'll be 
confronted with all the appropriate late-19th century surroundings, but 
the film is so deeply character-oriented that its easy to forget that 
we're looking back in time.  With one very important exception, there 
are no scenes designed to specifically highlight time and place.</P>
<P>     That lone exception happens early in the film.  Young Jude (James 
Daley) has accompanied his beloved school teacher, Phillotson (Liam 
Cunningham), to the top of a hill outside his town of Marygreen.  
Phillotson is traveling to Christminster to become a scholar, and, with 
Jude by his side to bid him farewell, he points out the distant place, 
shimmering and gleaming on the horizon like Camelot.  This vision 
becomes a driving force in Jude's life.  Though he grows up to be a 
stone mason by trade, his dream is of scholarship, so he spends long 
hours studying, hoping eventually to follow Phillotson.</P>
<P>     Years later, in the wake of a failed marriage to a pig farmer's 
daughter (Rachel Griffiths), Jude (now played by Christopher Eccleston) 
finally journeys to Christminster.  And, although he fails in his quest 
for admission to a university, he meets his beautiful, young cousin, Sue 
Bridehead (Kate Winslet), a modern woman who refuses to be governed by 
religious superstitions.  As she and Jude spend time together, they fall 
hopelessly in love.  But, because they can never marry, the pressures of 
society doom their relationship.  (In fact, it was Hardy's harsh 
condemnation of society's intransigence, in addition to his sexual 
frankness, that caused such a stir when JUDE THE OBSCURE first reached 
the public.)</P>
<P>     JUDE couldn't have been more perfectly cast.  Christopher Eccleston 
(SHALLOW GRAVE) develops Jude as a somewhat naive dreamer who is forever 
chasing an elusive image of happiness.  For a while, that's the 
existence of a scholar, then, for the bulk of the film, it's a life with 
Sue.  Eccleston gets us to care about Jude, a development that is 
critical to the film's success.  His chemistry with his leading lady, 
Kate Winslet, is electric.  When Phillotson says of Jude and Sue, 
"Sometimes I think [those] two are one person split in two", we believe 
him.  Their initial sexual encounter is both funny and touching.</P>
<P>     For her part, Winslet is luminous.  The film makers indicate that 
they chose her because she's "easy to fall in love with", but the 
strength of her performance far outstrips her natural charisma.  Winslet 
was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role in 1995's 
SENSE AND SENSIBILITY; what she does for Sue in JUDE is both more 
sublime and more noteworthy.  </P>
<P>     Liam Cunningham (A LITTLE PRINCESS) plays Phillotson as a tragic, 
but never pathetic, figure.  Rachel Griffiths, who won international 
attention and acclaim for her role as Rhonda in MURIEL'S WEDDING, brings 
a similar zest to Arabella, the partner in Jude's ill-fated marriage.  
Veteran actress June Whitfield (of the British sit-com ABSOLUTELY 
FABULOUS) is delightful as Jude's aging aunt, who's never short of 
advice.</P>
<P>     The emotional intensity of JUDE rivals that of films like 
CARRINGTON and THE REMAINS OF THE DAY.  The honesty of the story and the 
faithfulness of the production are two key factors why.  But top notch 
production values and strong performances aren't the only reasons for 
JUDE's success.  More important than even these critical elements is the 
universality of the sad, unforgettable love story that Thomas Hardy 
first told, and Michael Winterbottom has so effectively re-interpreted.</P>
