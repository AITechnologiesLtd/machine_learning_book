<P>"Shanghai Noon" (2000) *** (out of four)</P>
<PRE>Directed by Tom Dey
Written by Miles Millar, Alfred Gough</PRE>
<P>Starring Jackie Chan, Owen Wilson, Lucy Liu, Roger
Yuan, Walt Goggina, and Xander Berkely.</P>
<P>When Rush Hour became a surprise box office hit in
1998, Jackie Chan simultaneously became a household
name in America. Much like his character in the film,
Chan was someone different - a welcome change from now
fading stars like Dolph Lundgren, Jean-Claude Van
Damme and Sylvester Stallone. Completing his own
stunts, Chan's dexterity is a marvel to watch, and
with a quiet, gentle manner of speaking, he is also
unstoppably amiable. Rush Hour, for Hollywood and
audiences alike, was too good to be true - everyone
and their dogs knew a follow-up was inevitable. Enter
Shanghai Noon, a bright, enjoyable action comedy that
isn't a sequel to Rush Hour but might as well be
considered one. With Chan, an identical plot, and the
same East-Meets-West-With-Hilarious-Consequences feel
to it, if you didn't like Rush Hour you won't like
Shanghai Noon, and vice-versa. </P>
<P>Gone is the comedic sidekick Chris Tucker of Rush Hour
(what has happened to Tucker these past couple of
years anyway?), his replacement: the equally
loquacious and hilarious Owen Wilson. An actor who is
finally getting the recognition he deserves, Wilson
had blandly humorous supporting roles in Armageddon,
Anaconda, and The Haunting but his greatest
accomplishment remains his involvement in the fresh
comedies Bottle Rocket and Rushmore as co-writer.
Coming into the movie, I felt that the performance of
Wilson would crucially make or break the film. Since
Chan's fighting scenes were near-guaranteed to be
entertaining (they were), would the rest of the movie,
which Wilson dominates, be as exciting? Happily,
Wilson came through. As a two-timing wannabe outlaw,
his acting was exactly what the role demanded; a
combination of confidence and low self-esteem - a guy
who can talk the talk but comes nowhere close to
walking the walk. Wilson impressively completed the
difficult task of filling huge gaps of plot with witty
subplots and one-liners. His job was to hide the fact
that Chan's English vocabulary is somewhat limited,
and he succeeds with high honors.</P>
<P>But, then again, without Jackie Chan, this movie would
be nothing. He is a true expert at what he does - cool
stunts without the commanding aid of special effects,
and his good old fashioned fighting skills (no matter
how often he does them) never get old. But the actor
Jackie Chan is developing as well. He seems much more
mature and comfortable here then in Rush Hour,
sporting a long pony tail hanging below his
fashionable cowboy hat. </P>
<P>Shanghai Noon, poking fun at the old time Westerns in
which pardners are inseparable (until it comes to gold
or women, that is), relies on the chemistry between
Wilson and Chan is excellent, although it does take a
little too long for them to finally team up. The story
follows Chon Wang, an 18th century imperial guard who
is sent from China to the Wild Wild West in order to
rescue the kidnapped princess (Lucy Liu) he has a
crush on. On his way, he stumbles into some trouble
and eventually is helped by the suspicious Roy
O'Bannon (Wilson). The real challenge for the two is
whether they will survive each other before they
attempt their rescue mission.</P>
<P>With numerous references to older classics (the movie
is called Shanghai Noon, get it? Shang-High Noon…haha,
also a shot similar to the famous final scene of Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) and names (Wilson's
birth name was Wyatt Earp, Chon Wang conveniently
sounds just like John Wayne), the smaller jokes work
best. </P>
<P>A small predictable comedy, occasionally sprinkled
with gigantic laughs and "how-did-they-do-that?"
action scenes, Shanghai Noon does run a bit too long,
but otherwise is great, clean fun. Oh and don't forget
to stay for the infamous bloopers at the end of the
movie, they're very funny. </P>
<PRE>Grade: *** (out of four)</PRE>
