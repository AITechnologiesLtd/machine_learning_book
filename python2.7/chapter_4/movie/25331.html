<P>It has taken over twenty years for Marvel Enterprises to adapt one of their 
comic books into a live-action motion picture, but they have finally 
succeeded with "X-Men," arguably their most popular current superhero series. 
Having never read the comic before, or seen the animated series, my only 
relation to the world of "X-Men" came eight years ago (when I was in middle 
school), at a time when the collectors' trading cards were all the buzz. I 
remember looking at my schoolmates' cards, and one night I even attempted to 
go buy some, but either I looked in the wrong place or they were all sold 
out. In the sixth grade, collecting "X-Men" cards was the "in" thing to do, 
and being an impressionable preadolescent, it was relatively easy to get 
swept up into the world of Wolverine, Cyclops, Storm, and the many other 
characters. However, the fad never truly rubbed off on me, and aside from a 
cursory knowledge of some of the "mutants" and their powers, I went in to see 
the first "X-Men" movie, which is already shaping up to become a franchise, 
without knowing very much in the way of details.</P>
<P>Being a non-fan, it is with pleasure to report that "X-Men" is a good, 
respectable film--not 'great' by any stretch of the imagination--but one of 
the very few comic book adaptations that has been successfully translated to 
the big-screen. The opening chapter in the "X-Men" saga, I suspect, is more a 
set-up for grander, more satisfying, things to come, much like the original 
"Star Wars" was back in 1977. Some of the central characters are developed 
more than others, and there is a great deal of exposition for which the 
occasional action scenes are built around, but that is just fine, because 
like "The Empire Strikes Back," "X-Men II" will begin to fill in the missing 
puzzle pieces and concentrate on the characters and backstories that there 
was no time for in the original.</P>
<P>Set in the not-so-distant future, when the United States Senate is attempting 
to pass a bill against mutants (i.e. human beings who have obtained special 
powers due to DNA mutations), headed by the discriminatory, close-minded 
Senator Kelly (Bruce Davison). Magneto (Ian McKellen), a mutant whose family 
was taken away from him during WWII, suspects that another present-day 
Holocaust is at hand, and sets out with his henchmen, Mystique (Rebecca 
Romijn-Stamos), a blue-skinned shapeshifter; Toad (Ray Park), who has a very, 
very long tongue; and Sabertooth (Tyler Mane), a hairy man-beast, to prepare 
for war. On the opposing side, the so-called X-Men, mutants who strive for 
peace and acceptance, must stop Magneto before the point of no return. Headed 
by Professor X (Patrick Stewart), a wheelchair-bound telekinetic, the X-Men 
run a school for gifted mutants, with the faculty run by Dr. Jean Grey (Famke 
Jannsen), also a telekinetic; Cyclops (James Marsden), whose eyes shoot laser 
beams if not shielded by sunglasses; and Storm (Halle Berry), who can control 
the weather.</P>
<P>The X-Men acquire two new mutants to their team after saving Wolverine (Hugh 
Jackman) and Rogue (Anna Paquin) from an attack on a wintry Canadian country 
road by Sabertooth. Rogue, a frightened 17-year-old high schooler, has run 
away from home after kissing a classmate and inexplicably putting him in a 
coma for three weeks. Holing up in a bar, she meets Wolverine and suspects 
that they both may be mutants after seeing him get attacked by a group of 
troublemaking men and defending himself by extracting sharp blades from in 
between his knuckles. Because they both are outcasts, and Rogue cannot ever 
come into human contact with anyone without sucking their life energy from 
them, they quickly bond, and at first, do not know what to expect from the </P>
<P>Without the careful handling of the characters of Wolverine and Rogue, 
"X-Men" would   feel like a shallow excursion to oft-covered territory, just 
as most comic book adaptations fall into the trap of. However, as played by 
Aussie newcomer Hugh Jackman and Academy Award winner Anna Paquin (1993's 
"The Piano"), and scripted by David Hayter, Wolverine and Rogue spring to 
life, forming the heart and soul of the rather simplistic story. The 
camaraderie that develops between the two, with Wolverine sort of becoming 
the surrogate guardian of Rogue, is nicely developed and sweet.</P>
<P>The other X-Men aren't nearly as fully drawn, with most slinking in the 
background for large periods of time, only to come into their own when they 
must use their powers to save themselves or those around them. The exceptions 
are Patrick Stewart ("Star Trek") and Ian McKellen (1998's "Gods and 
Monsters"), as Professor X and Magneto, respectively, the leaders of their 
conflicting sides. Both performers are effective and suitably cast, and this 
is an especially nice change from Stewart's usual role as Captain Picard in 
the "Star Trek" movies.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, despite having next to no dialogue, is 
seductively threatening and leaves a memorable impression as Mystique, 
arguably the nastiest villainess since Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman in 1992's 
"Batman Returns." As the other evil opponents, Ray Park, as Toad, and Tyler 
Mane, as Sabertooth, are fairly inconsequential characters, and the film 
neither benefits nor suffers from their appearances. On the "good" side, 
Famke Janssen (1999's "House on Haunted Hill") and Halle Berry (1998's 
"Bulworth") are likable as Jean Grey and Storm (who has my personal favorite 
superpower), but they have very little screen time and even less to do. In 
the next "X-Men" installment, I am sure they will be more prominently 
displayed. Finally, James Marsden is sorely disappointing as Cyclops, 
although it is difficult to say whether his utter blandness is the fault of 
the actor, or merely because he has the least to do. Based on his strong 
previous work in 1999's "Disturbing Behavior" and 2000's "Gossip," my 
suspicions point to the latter. </P>
<P>Unlike the "Batman" series, which catastrophically plummeted in quality 
following "Batman Returns," "X-Men" relies more on storytelling than the 
visual flair of the set design and cinematography, which is a wise choice. 
Whereas "Batman" is a fantasy almost through-and-through, "X-Men" is set in a 
realistic version of today's world, with characters that only happen to have 
powers beyond normal human capabilities. Nonetheless, the visuals are 
occasionally impressive, particularly a beautiful shot of a snow-covered 
Canadian vista that is reminiscent of 1999's gorgeous "Snow Falling on 
Cedars," as well as the climax set atop the Statue of Liberty.</P>
<P>At 100 minutes (including end credits), "X-Men" reaches its finale about 
fifteen minutes too quickly, leaving a sneaking feeling that a fair amount of 
footage was left on the cutting room floor. Better to end while leaving its 
audience wanting more, however, rather than wearing out its welcome with an 
excessive running time. In an attempt to bring a Marvel comic book to life, 
20th Century Fox has created an entertaining, if slight, motion picture in 
"X-Men," undoubtedly only the beginning in a successful new franchise, and if 
it's any indication that director Bryan Singer (1995's "The Usual Suspects") 
has succeeded, I am already anxiously awaiting a sequel. Look for it to be 
released in 2002. You can mark my word with a capital "X."</P>
