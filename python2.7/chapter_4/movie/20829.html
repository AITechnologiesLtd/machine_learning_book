<P>IN SHORT: The best li'l kidflick of the year.</P>
<P>And, yes, I know that kids past the age of five or so think Elmo is for
"babies". We'll get to the guts of the flick in a second. For those of
us to whom the Muppets of Sesame Street (or otherwise) were our teevee
pals growing up, and we're talking over 25 years of growing kidlets
here, Elmo in Grouchland  makes everything complete in the Sesame Street
Universe.</P>
<PRE>Bert and Ernie are back.</PRE>
<P>Unless something to the contrary has happened on Sesame Street (which I
don't watch), Bert and Ernie were retired as active characters when Jim
Henson died a number of years ago. The first thing you see in Elmo is
the pair, directly addressing the audience -- a brilliant idea by
screenwriters Mitchel Kriegman and Joseph Mazzarino, all of whom seem
aware that kidlets have limited attention spans and love to bother their
parents with questions throughout any movie they watch. Well, Bert and
Ernie are just like the kids, Bert moreso, and every couple of minutes
the film stops and Bert comes frantically into frame, wondering what is
happening and why. Ernie plays parent, the pair exit and the film moves
on. More important, they make the viewing experience an interactive one,
asking the kids to yell at the screen, counting down the timing strip
that precedes every film. It's a great idea, and is used several times
during the film.</P>
<P>Elmo is, after all, a li'l monster who communicates on a one to one
basis with his audience. He's polite but extremely self centered (think
of a terrible two year old screaming MINE! MINE! MINE!) which has always
annoyed the heck out of me on the small screen. On the big screen, it's
not so bad.</P>
<P>Elmo loves his blanket (didn't we all??) which seems to have a life of
its own. Possessive li'l monster that he is, he gets annoyed when his
friend Zoe wants to cuddle with blankie. Push comes to shove, the
blanket tears (oh! the horror!) and before you know it Elmo is climbing
into Oscar the Grouch's garbage can to get it back. But it's not a trash
can, it's a portal to another place called Grouchland populated by more
of Oscar's kind all of whom live in fear of the monstrous Huxley (Mandy
Patinkin), who covets everything he sees. Which includes the blanket.</P>
<P>Sure, other residents of Sesame Street take the trip down the can to try
and help Elmo. The joy here is the appearance of dozens of new
characters and non-stop jokes that work for both kidlets and parents.
Aided by Grizzy Grouch (Stephanie D'Abruzzo), Elmo must climb Mount
Pickanose to Huxley's Castle, avoid a giant chicken and an "ultimate
test" by the luscious Vanessa Williams as the Queen of the Dump. The
kidlets were yelling at the screen to help the Red One (though they got
help from the surround soundtrack) and this grownup couldn't believe
what a blast it all was. And lots of Bert and Ernie. Oh happy happy joy
joy!</P>
<P>Lest I forget, a tip of the hat to the Muppet Players: Kevin Clash
(Elmo), Carroll Spinney (Big Bird and Oscar), Martin P. Robinson (Telly
Monster), Frank Oz (Bert, Grover, Cookie Monster), Fran Brill (Zoe),
Steve Whitmire (Ernie), Jerry Nelson (The Count). First time bigscreen
director Gary Halvorson does a bang up job keeping everything moving
quickly (but not too quickly -- us adults are a lot slower than the
kidlets), dropping in a musical nod to STOMP! and concentrating more on
story and muppets, than on songs and cameos as have other Muppet flicks.</P>
<P>Technically, this can't be called a "Muppet" movie, which has something
to do with trademarks and creative rights and the original deal made
between Henson and the Children's Television Workshop. Luckily, I can
call Elmo what it is. It's the best Muppet movie since The Muppet Movie.</P>
<P>And you know how almost every kidlet flick gets the rental rating 'cuz
that's where they all wind up? Think again.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to The Adventures of Elmo in
Grouchland, he would have paid...</P>
<PRE>$6.00</PRE>
<P>Gee. I haven't thought about my blankie in years . . .</P>
