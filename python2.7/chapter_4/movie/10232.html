<P>I've been watching films for roughly half of my natural life. I would
like to think that I have seen a lot of them--more than most people.
Until this day, however, I have never seen anything like Titanic. This
film makes me want to invent new words just to describe it, because most
of what I've witnessed here is truly unfathomable. It is impossible to
speak of Titanic and not gush with excitement, but my words are not
hyperbolized--James Cameron's masterpiece is the very best film of 1997.
This picture is the closest I have ever seen to perfection, a love story
filled with real human emotions, and a disaster epic more real,
shocking, and intense than anything ever shown in film. I'm sure someone
at some point has made a checklist of everything that goes into a great
film. Every box would be checked for Titanic. This film fails in
absolutely nothing: the love story is one of the most moving I have ever
experienced. The disaster is flawlessly depicted on screen. The
integration of the two is not only smooth, but ultimately the central
meaning of the film.</P>
<P>And yet, at the core, the story is so brilliantly simple and direct:
Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a drifter who wins a ticket for the
Titanic. On board, he meets Rose (Kate Winslet) who is engaged to a rich
man named Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). Rose is unhappy, both with her
engagement and with her new-found social climate. She and Jack fall in
love, and then the Titanic hits the iceberg. This story is actually in
the middle of another story, in which deep sea explorer Brock Lovett
(Bill Paxton) in modern times is searching the wreckage, looking for a
lost diamond. He finds a picture of a woman instead, and this woman
turns out to be Rose, who is now one-hundred one years old. She tells
the story of her experiences on the Titanic to Brock and his crew.</P>
<P>Titanic is what I'd call a religious experience. I didn't pull my eyes
away from the screen. I was mesmerized. Cameron spent years making this
film, and well over 200 million dollars, and every bit of his effort is
right there for audiences to feel and experience with wonder and
amazement. The list of positives could be endless.</P>
<P>At the top of this list is Kate Winslet. Now, most people would agree
that liking an actor or actress will enhance the viewing of the film in
which he or she stars. Kate Winslet is the most talented young actress
working in the business today. Her ability to convey emotion, especially
in this film, is unmatched by any other actress of her generation.
Watching her on screen, I feel the kind of strength and presence that I
see in powerful women like Sigourney Weaver and Linda Hamilton, but
Winslet has even more than these women do--a gleam in her eye, an edge
in her voice. There is something almost inexplicable about her presence
that makes her so supremely wonderful in any film that no film graced
with her performance could ever be bad. Titanic, which would have been
great without her, manages to exceed greatness because of her. And
though I hesitate to say it, I must admit that she is--without a
doubt--the most attractive woman I have ever seen. This obviously
doesn't hurt.</P>
<P>Even though the other actors pale in comparison to Winslet, they all
turn in superb, memorable performances. DiCaprio, as always, is great as
Jack. This is a more grown-up role than I'm used to seeing him in, and
so I was impressed with his progressive talents. He makes this strong
character believable and likable. One speech he gives while in the
presence of a group of rich individuals at a dinner is particularly
convincing, and he carries this kind of aura throughout the film without
fumbling it. I actually believed that Jack's strength is what gives Rose
such a powerful drive to live.</P>
<P>Billy Zane plays the evil, sneering Cal with that kind of evil, sneering
attitude that only Billy Zane can portray. Not unlike his portrayal of
the hopelessly psychotic antagonist in Dead Calm, Zane can be
particularly evil while still managing to convince us that there is
something human buried inside of him. He does everything for his own
good, but the reasons for this are evident from watching the film, and
he isn't a one-note bad guy intended simply to instigate an insurrection
from Rose. He is an unusually genuine antagonist, one that, although he
is bad, the audience can understand.</P>
<P>Cameron's script is astounding. Here we have a love story in which the
man teaches the woman how to live, but their situation is inherently
ironic given their placement on the doomed ocean liner. Without giving
away too much, I must mention the profound and brilliant metaphor that
Cameron has created here--the Titanic is the love between these two
people. The scale is so grand that the love story does not subside when
compared to the sinking of the ship; in fact, it actually outshines the
disaster in many ways. What I'm left with are, of course, the images of
the ship sinking, but what has left a more significant impact on me are
the implications given here by the two main components of this film and
the way they work with one another.</P>
<P>I imagine most of the box-office draw to this film will be from the
obvious fact that it's about a sinking ship. Although I hope most people
will get out of it what I have, there is no way disaster and action film
fans will be disappointed by Cameron's spectacle. He recreated the
disaster down to the last detail. A more convincing film could not have
been made had the sinking ship been filmed this year by a professional
camera crew. The line between models and digital is not noticeable, and
the shots of the vast ship travelling in the lonesome ocean are
breathtaking--the best special effects one could hope to see. When the
ship is sinking, there isn't a moment that doesn't scream pure realism.
Even the physics behind the water rushing down the corridors appears
real. Aside from all of this, Cameron has mastered the nearly-impossible
task of making the incident real-time in its execution. The ship sunk in
about an hour, and that's how long it takes on screen.</P>
<P>Cameron's heart and soul went into this film. I can see from the outcome
that it is exactly what he wanted--every shot, every word of dialogue,
ever nuance between the characters is intentional and meaningful. Films
as completely spectacular as Titanic come about once every few years,
but I doubt any of them had or will have the kind of hype that surrounds
this one. Titanic doesn't just live up to its hype: this film exceeds
everything I could have imagined it to be, and the result is something
that you must see for yourself to believe. And when the film is over, it
may take you a little while to return to reality, but you're just going
to want to get right back on that ship again, even though you know what
happens. But then again, that's the trick, isn't it?</P>
