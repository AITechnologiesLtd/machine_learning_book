<PRE>                                CLIFFHANGER
                       A film review by Roger Rubio
                        Copyright 1993 Roger Rubio</PRE>
<P>Starring Sylvester Stallone, Janine Turner, and Michael Rooker
Directed by Renny Harlin</P>
<P>     The return of Stallone?  I would assume this question is on the
mind of the wary movie-goer wondering whether or not he/she should put
down his/her $7-$9 and see Sly climbing on rocks and dodging bullets.
Well, if you're one of those wary viewers, I have two reviews to offer
you of this movie: the review for those looking for an art movie and
those looking to have a good time.  The first is the former, the second
is the latter.</P>
<P>     CLIFFHANGER is one those flicks that a total cynic would have a
ball tearing apart and ripping to shreds.  The dialogue is less than
intellectually intelligent, the acting is not Oscar caliber, and
sometimes you can tell that the actors are not five codzillion miles
into the air hanging by their very lives.  Most of the sequences are
implausible, the meanie villain doesn't do most of the dirty work, and
there are plenty of 'talking killers.'  Lots of foreign accents too (as
if only foreigners are bad).  One might think that this movie is a
clone of DIE HARD or the like, but ask even the most light-hearted
cynic and he/she will tell you even DIE HARD was ridiculous.  So why do
they compare all other action flicks such as CLIFFHANGER to DIE HARD,
if DIE HARD was so ridiculous?  (Answer in the second review.)  Yep,
there's lots to ridicule in this movie, and if you go to the movies
just to bitch and moan about plots, special effects, acting, blah blah
blah, DON'T go see this movie.</P>
<P>     As for the others, who like to have a good time at the movies
(this excludes most cynics), CLIFFHANGER just might be a good vehicle
for consideration.  Most of the stunt sequences in this movie are
amazing, and well worth the price of admission.  The story is mediocre;
it is enough to put the characters into some sticky situations, but
that's about all.  But the actions sequences make you feel like you're
on a roller coaster (which is what I believe was the intent).  Yes,
Stallone does do some acting, and it is tolerable, considering his
previous movies (OSCAR, STOP OR MY MOM WILL SHOOT).  I believe
Stallone's best acting is the subtle type, not the overtly comedic.
This movie is a good way to get back into the acting fray.  I don't
think he's Oscar material, but if he sticks to this kind of movie he
will be fine.  As for the rest of the movie, the action sequences are
the real star of this movie, and if you want a decent thrill, check
this movie out.  (By the way, cynics don't think DIE HARD was as
ridiculous as they would have you believe--it's merely convenient for
comparison purposes.)</P>
<P>     I have skimmed the gamut on this movie; some see it as an
adrenalin ride, others get sidetracked by Stallone and his previous
movies (interestingly, not this movie, but his previous ones).  If you
hate Stallone, of course, don't see this one.  But if you can tolerate
him, or if you like him (I'm sure there are some out there--the
silent minority), check this one out.  It's a good romp at the movies.</P>
