<PRE>                               Conspiracy Theory
                       A film review by Hanson Yoo
                       Copyright 1997 Hanson Yoo</PRE>
<P>Yet another Donner/Silver/Gibson team-up with Julia Roberts thrown into the mix,
Conspiracy Theory really does little to go beyond the formula of the Lethal
Weapon series - the set-up, the funny middle, and the sagging, auto-pilot,
guns-a-blazing ending.  The difference?  Gibson is partnered with a woman and
there aren't any big explosions.  My theory is that anteing up for both Gibson
and Roberts didn't leave enough budget left over to blow things up.</P>
<P>The story sets up a bit slowly - Gibson is Jerry Fletcher, a cabbie with a mind
grounded solidly in conspiracy theories.  Julia Roberts is Alice Sutton, a
Justice Department lawyer and the object of Jerry's affections.  Jerry seems to
have made a habit of gaining entry to the Justice Department offices to meet
with Alice and apprising her of his latest conspiracy theories (you know, it's
impossible to recap the plot without constantly mentioning the title.  Do you
think it's all a… nah).  She humors him, although grudgingly, because he saved
her from a mugging six months prior.  Alice has an obsession of her own - she's
still investigating the murder of her father, even though the case is officially
closed.  And Alice hasn't ridden her precious horses since her father's death.
Will Alice find out who really murdered her father?  Will this all tie in with
Jerry?  Will she ever ride again?  Take a wild guess.</P>
<P>There are some nice touches besides the kooky conspiracy theories (there's that
title again).  Jerry never enters his apartment the same way twice in a row, and
he leaves toothpicks in strategic places to ensure that his apartment hasn't
been entered without his knowledge.  His refrigerator and it's contents are all
locked up to ensure nothing is tampered with.  And metal lines all his walls
(although we later find out that it's not just to block out CIA mind control
transmissions).  In short, Jerry's not only sees conspiracies around him, but
he's also one paranoid puppy.  Of course, Alice doesn't believe a word of it
until...</P>
<P>Well, you'll have to see the movie to find out.  But it's not really all that
clever nor is it original.  Pretty soon, the movies runs rampant with shadow ops
baddies (including Patrick Stewart) and doubts about who's telling the truth and
who's in on the conspiracy (not that the film leaves any doubts).  Sure, the
second act is well made - it's both funny and interesting with a couple of very
good performances from Gibson and especially Roberts (who hasn't been this
fetching since Pretty Woman).  Stewart seems to waver between a passable
American accent to full Jean Luc-Picard mode.  Note to Patrick - you're supposed
to be sinister.  Go with the English accent.  Who cares about plausibility in a
film like this?</P>
<P>About the time the duo hits Connecticut, the movies loses all it's charm and
steam.  Right about then you can see the ending coming from a mile away because
you've seen it about a hundred times before.  It's as if the filmmakers reached
for a box of "Instant Action Movie Ending" and just added water without even
bothering to stir (which may be another reason why there weren't any
explosions).  Not that the movie was great up until that point, but at least it
was entertaining.  The last act is so generically blah that there's hardly a
reason to watch it - most of the audience can connect the dots at this point.</P>
<P>As if the ending isn't perfunctory enough, stick around for the credits -
there's yet another seemingly obligatory hip-hop remake of an older song (this
time it's the Frankie Valli standby, Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You).  And like
My Best Friend's Wedding, people singing the song in unison are used for cheap
laughs.  </P>
<P>Conspiracy Theory is another one of those "starts interesting, ends formulaic"
Hollywood movies that coasts more on the charms of it's stars than anything
else.  In other words, yet another summer action flick.    </P>
