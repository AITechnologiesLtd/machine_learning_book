<P>I'm not sure why the formal structure of a film review requires that a
brief synopsis of the plot be provided.  Readers who have seen the film
in question aren't going to be interested in a brief retelling of the
story; they're just interested in the opinion of the critic.  Readers
who are considering seeing the picture aren't going to want to know a
lot about the film before seeing it.  Sometimes, however, the film
itself begs a review with no plot synopsis.  Roland Joffe's Goodbye
Lover is this kind of film.  The trailer tells far too much about the
picture, and any plot synopsis that explains beyond the first ten
minutes is too explicit.  So, what you learn in the first ten minutes is
as follows:  Sandra (Patricia Arquette) likes sex.  She likes sex with
Ben (Don Johnson), who just happens to be her husband's brother.  Her
husband is Jake (Dermot Mulroney).  What these three people do is
something you shouldn't know going into the movie.</P>
<P>But that won't stop me from mentioning that the film is so busy and
packed with subplots that you're likely to walk away feeling assaulted. 
Goodbye Lover is a strange little film, one that passes for
entertainment but probably won't linger in the memory for long.  I liked
a lot of it, starting with a few of the performances, and there are some
very clever sequences scattered about the movie.  But it lacks
inspiration, and more often feels derivative of flicks associated with
Quentin Tarantino.  The Tarantino genre can be put to good use (recent
examples include Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels and Go), but
Goodbye Lover doesn't deliver the way it could.  It's also the kind of
movie that ignores the characters in favor of an elaborate plot, and so
emotional investment in the story is nearly impossible.</P>
<P>That's not to say that there aren't any characters, because there
certainly are.  They may be stock characters with one-note
personalities, but they're all interesting to a degree.  Arquette is
perfectly lurid and ridiculously sexual, and the motivations behind
Sandra's actions are fascinating; we're led to believe that she just
wants a comfortable life (later, this turns out to mean that she wants a
lot of money).  Johnson and Mulroney are believable as brothers, though
neither character is understandable on any human level.  The interesting
characters are on the periphery:  Ellen DeGeneres (whom I love) is grand
as Sgt. Pompano, a cynical cop who investigates the situation that
Sandra creates.  I also enjoyed Ray McKinnon, who plays Pompano's naive
partner.  Mary-Louise Parker is funny as the woman Ben seems to fall in
love with; she appears intensely uncomfortable in every scene she's in. 
And I like Joffe's direction; there are a lot of nice stylistic touches,
some tricky camera work, and an appropriate musical score by John
Ottoman.  I also loved the last scene, for it features a burst of irony
so overt that I couldn't help but laugh.</P>
<P>One problem I noted early on is the lack of inspiration; much of the
film marches relentlessly to its conclusion, force-feeding us obligatory
scenes just because they're required to tie up loose ends.  And you
might be wondering how all these characters are worked into the
labyrinthine plot that the screenwriters (Ron Peer, Joel Cohen, and Alec
Sokolow) have constructed.  You might also wonder why the picture
contains a serial killer named The Doctor, who kills young women by
injecting them with a deadly chemical, or why Vincent Gallo is present
as a hired killer, or why there are loud sex scenes that take place in a
church (though I did enjoy the sarcastic references to religion and
existence).  Goodbye Lover is fluff, but it didn't have to be -- there
is a place for complex black comedies, but the good ones make
characterization essential to plot.  And though Goodbye Lover is a
convoluted mess, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen that couldn't
be synopsized in two tightly-written paragraphs.</P>
