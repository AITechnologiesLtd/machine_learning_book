<P>`Do you ever get the feeling you're dead?'  That's the first line in
Henry Bromell's Panic, and it's uttered by an upper-middle-class man in
the throes of a midlife crisis.  Sounds a little like the beginning of
American Beauty, eh?  If you think that's bad, wait until you learn that
the character is also a killer-for-hire who visits a shrink.  Now
there's something we haven't seen in a while.</P>
<P>Thankfully, Panic isn't just a derivative knockoff of Beauty or the
whole shrink/hitman thing from Analyze This and The Sopranos.  While the
film's characters are pretty decently fleshed out, and its story follows
a fairly predictable trajectory, Panic's real drawing card is its
fantastic cast.  Each turns in great performances that keep the film
interesting and fresh, despite the fact its content was lifted from the
day-old rack at the Hollywood Food Market.</P>
<P>William H. Macy (State and Main) plays Alex, unhappy husband to Martha
(Tracey Ullman, Small Time Crooks) and father to precocious six-year-old
Sammy (David Dorfman, Bounce).  Alex has two jobs – one running a
moderately successful mail-order business from his home, and the other
as a contract killer for his father (Donald Sutherland, Space Cowboys).
It's the latter that lands him on the couch of Dr. Josh Parks (John
Ritter, Felicity).</P>
<P>Alex tells Dr. Parks about meeting a girl named Sarah (Neve Campbell,
Scream 3) who doesn't make him feel dead.  Coincidentally, he met Sarah
while waiting in Dr. Parks' waiting room (never a good place to pick up
women, if you ask me).  Alex explains that he was instantly smitten with
Sarah, and that the no-nonsense bisexual eventually fell in love with
his wonderfully sad eyes.</P>
<P>Dr. Parks bolsters Alex's confidence to stand up to his overbearing
father, who simply refuses to believe that his only son wants to quit
the family business.  When Alex receives a photograph of his next
target, it sends him reeling.  His life is truly at a crossroads.  Does
he choose his supportive wife, or the hot manic chick?  Mail-order or
contract killing?  Wouldn't we all like to have choices like these to
make?</P>
<P>Bromell, an executive producer for Northern Exposure and Homicide, makes
his feature-film writing and directorial debuts with Panic, with the
latter easily outclassing the former.  He cleverly uses flashbacks to a
series of firsts in Alex's life (first encounters with Martha, Dr. Parks
and Sarah, first firearms lesson from his father, first professional
hit) to bring us into the character's life.  The scenes featuring Alex
and little Sammy are touching and done rather well.</P>
<P>With this role, Campbell displays talent we haven't seen since the first
two seasons of Party of Five.  It's really nice to see Ullman doing
something where I don't want to choke the shit out of her (read:  not
playing multiple, unfunny characters), and what can you say about Macy?
He turns in another typically incredible performance as Alex – a bit of
a cross between his `Quiz Kid' Donnie Smith from Magnolia and Jerry
Lundegaard from Fargo.</P>
<P>1:28 – R for adult language and violence</P>
