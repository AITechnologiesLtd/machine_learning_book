<P>     In a scene early in TITANIC TOWN -- a drama set in Belfast during the
early days of the Troubles circa 1972 -- British soldiers go on a
house-to-house raid of a neighborhood called Andersonstown. One of the
raided residences is that of Bernie (Julie Walters) and Aidan McPhelimy
(Ciaran Hinds), quiet and non-political parents of four children. While
neighbors rage in the street at the soldiers' actions, Bernie's response
to the impending invasion of her home expresses concern of a different
kind. She frets that the army will find the beds unmade; when they search
under her daughter's bed, she laments to the child, "Ah, the dust!"</P>
<P>     It's a small bit of business, only one of many in the film, but it
shows how interested director Roger Michell and screenwriter Anne Devlin
(working from Mary Costello's autobiographical novel) are with
establishing character. Over the course of the film, Bernie becomes a bona
fide political celebrity, though not a much-beloved one. Incensed over a
friend's death at the hands of an IRA sniper, Bernie dares to criticize
the IRA's tactics. She joins a peace movement, and finds her criticism
drawing the ire of IRA sympathizers in the form of vandalism and threats. 
Nevertheless she perseveres in an effort to collect signatures for a
petition calling for a change in IRA tactics. What's extraordinary about
Bernie is that she's so un-extraordinary. She's simply a house-proud 
mother concerned more with keeping her kids alive than making a statement. 
At her core, she's a woman who likes the beds made, and with no dust under
them.</P>
<P>     This simple focus on a simple but very determined woman helps TITANIC
TOWN avoid the most common pitfall of films set against a political
struggle: It never stops to lecture about the futility of war or to make
any other grandiose statement about the events that form its backdrop. 
Walters delivers a witty, thoroughly engaging performance as Bernie, who
stumbles into a position as spokesperson by sheer accident. She's
convincing both in Bernie's political innocence -- reading a list of IRA
demands to a British official with no clue as to how implausible they are
-- and her gradual embrace of the spotlight. TITANIC TOWN paints a picture
of a world where life can't be separated from politics, and where one
person's odd brand of heroism is born of sheer necessity.</P>
<P>     Bernie is such a solid center of the film that its sub-plots often
feel fairly thin by comparison. There's unrealized potential in Aidan's
character, an ulcer-ridden man whose resentment of his infirmity bubbles
over into resentment of his wife's very public actions. There's also a
romantic angle involving Bernie's 16-year-old daughter Annie (nicely
played by newcomer Nuala O'Neill) that doesn't always feel connected to
the story as a whole, despite the framing structure of the story as
Annie's reminiscence of her mother's fame. TITANIC TOWN draws its strength
from Bernie's incongruous involvement in matters previously beyond her
comprehension. Nothing else in the film is ever quite as compelling.</P>
<P>     That one story is still compelling enough to keep TITANIC TOWN moving
briskly, and to offer a vivid insight into the chaos of 1970s Belfast. 
Ultimately, despite its milieu of wide-scale violence and strife, it's a
film that works thanks to its small moments: avid reader Annie looking out
at the war in the streets with a gasp of, "Agincourt!"; a woman dropped
suddenly in her tracks by a stray bullet; Bernie deducing the location of
the IRA meeting spot through keen recollection of interior design. Films
about Big Issues need those small moments to keep them human. TITANIC TOWN
is never the monolith its title might suggest. Tragedy sometimes appears
in a form less like a sinking ship than like an unmade bed.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 female Troubles:  7.</PRE>
