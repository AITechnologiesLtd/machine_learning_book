<PRE>                                    HAVANA
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1990 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  CUBABLANCA.  A victory of detailed
     setting over a much weaker political thriller plot and a love
     story of little interest.  Rating: 0 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     Gambler Jack Weil (played by Robert Redford) has a piece of advice for
revolutionary Bobby Duran (played by Lena Olin) about how to play roulette.
You should not put all your money on one number.  You go for a more modest
bet, like betting on black.  "You still lose you money, but you lose it more
slowly."  Or another example: Hollywood should bet on a bankable combination
like Sidney Pollack directing Robert Redford in films like THE WAY WE WERE,
THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR, ELECTRIC HORSEMAN, and OUT OF AFRICA.  Eventually
you will come up double-zero on a $45 million spectacle, but it will take
longer.  Double-zero is essentially what Universal has with HAVANA.  One of
the zeroes is a political thriller that pits the pre-revolutionary scummy
government of Batista against the idealistic supporters of Fidel Castro,
most of whom we know are destined to have a rude awakening in the years to
come.  The other zero is a love story in which the lovers have all the
chemistry of champagne and Miracle Whip*.</P>
<P>     Redford plays Jack Weil, a wise-cracking gambler who sticks to
business, but might have more going on below the surface, much like Rick
Blaine in CASABLANCA.  He becomes the third side of a triangle in which the
other two sides are a married couple of revolutionaries (Lena Olin and Raul
Julia) living a dangerous life, much like Ilsa Lund and Victor Laszlo in
CASABLANCA.  Weil must decide if he will do nothing and let events take
their course, try to steal the woman, or become committed to the cause, much
as Rick does in CASABLANCA.  Now it seems to me that some film other than
HAVANA has used this plot before.  It's on the tip of my mind, but ... oh,
well.  Seriously, one reason that this film does not engage the audience
like CASABLANCA did is that Bogart was an actor who could show pain.
Redford can wince a little.</P>
<P>     Of the love story, the political thriller, and the setting, the setting
wins by default.  Much of that humungous budget went into creating the look
and feel of Havana of 1958.  Others have vouched for its accuracy; I can
vouch only for its believability.  Not that pre-revolutionary Havana was
that interesting a city but, filming in the Dominican Republic, Pollack has
captured at least a believable look.  And at nearly two and a half hours in
length, the film lets you get a long look.  And you might as well look at
the background; you are not missing much in the foreground.  I give this
film a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
