<P>What a heap of limping, lurching cliches.  This tear-jerker, well-recieved in
the US, is a terrible movie which depends for its freshness on the Asian faces
and cliches with which US audiences are unfamiliar.</P>
<P>Many critics have already skewered this film, but I won't let that stop me
from piling it on.  Not only does this movie portray certain stereotypes
which others have pointed out, in some ways depends on the racism of
Westerners in order to work.  For example, most westerners can not/do not
discriminate between Asians of different ethnic origin, thus, for most
viewers, the use of actresses of Japanese and Vietnamese origin to portray
Chinese women was a success.</P>
<P>This film has come under much criticism for its allegedly "sterotyped"
portrayals of Chinese men.  As one who lives in Taiwan and is married to a
Taiwanese, I disagree.        It is relatively faithful in its portrayal of Chinese
men (women and children are still sold in China and Taiwan even today), where
it errs is in its relentless depiction of Chinese women as saints put upon by
males.        The behavior of the various mothers toward their children is not
overshadowed by the authoritarian patterns of dominance and control which
mark even the most well-intentioned interpersonal relationships in Chinese
society, but always by some dark secret in the past.  The mystifying behavior
(from the mother's point-of-view) of the daughters, which in real life would
be a struggle to move beyond this control, in the movie are generally
depicted as a mere cultural/generational clash. This is the sort of
white-washing one sees daily in soap operas on Taiwanese TV.</P>
<P>The acting is excellent, the directing competent, but the storyline is so
riddled with triteness nothing can save it.  The individual stories of the
aunties will be recognized by anyone familiar with romances, soap operas and
TV dramas in Asia.  The use of flashbacks is a good idea, but the pace is too
slow at times.</P>
<P>The film's strongest point lies in its depiction of Asians as people too. 
It's refreshing to see so many faces, marginalized in other films, stand tall
here. If only they'd been given something to really sink their teeth into. 
1.5 out of 5.</P>
