<PRE>                  I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
               1 :-)  for an amusing old fisherman's tale</PRE>
<P>Cast: Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe,
Freddie Prinze Jr., Anne Heche, Muse Watson Director: Jim Gillespie
Screenplay: Kevin Williamson based on the novel by Lois Duncan</P>
<P>>From a psychopathic serial killer point of view, why is it more fun to
murder blondes? This post-teen slasher-hacker, man-with-hook gore fest
consist of two blondes and two brunettes. It becomes cliche if I told
you the blondes are a bitchy bimbo beauty queen and a wealthy boozing
boastful bastard, whilst the brunettes carry brains and better
disposition. So who lives and who dies actually becomes a little
dependant on hair colour and the associated characteristics that go
along with it. Nobody wants to see likeable characters become victims of
a butchering heaven, so unleash the wrath of the monster on those who
deserve it the most - the blonde bitch and her bitchier sister, the
bastard boyfriend with blonde hair and the uptight brunette who should
have been a blonde.</P>
<P>If fair was fair and not dependant on the colour of your hair, everybody
should have died by the end of this movie. This is the tale of a murder
within a murder. Four high school grads make the imprudent mistake of
concealing a crime that will haunt them forever. Their actions cannot be
justified by the fact that the person they ran over deserved to die.
What were they thinking? Run a dog over and hope that it won't bite
again? Personally I thought they did a good job. With speeds estimated
at 110 kms/hr it is unlikely the average human being could have survived
such a collision. However, we are referring to the average monster
tormentor from hell and these have a tendency to live forever. So run
the beast down with a car and he'll keep coming after you. Drown him in
the murky depths of a lagoon and he'll open his eyes and wink at you.
Cut of his hand and fling him into the sea and he'll rise again for more
fun.</P>
<P>So I did scream aloud once in this movie, and embarrassingly so. It was
just a loud noise but then again, I'm the jumpy sort and finger shadows
on the wall could scare the daylights out of me. However, I didn't find
this movie as terrifying as "Scream" - purely because there was twice as
much blood curdling screams, multiple mutilating stab wounds and
entrails galore in the latter. But still there is enough blood spilt in
this movie to keep a vampire happy in it's grave this summer. So I did
like this movie's quaint perspective on butchering the blonde and the
beautiful, but I disliked the ordinariness of the villain made out to be
as frightening as my Uncle Ted gone fishing. If you gave me a hook, a
hood and hat, I'd probably think you were going on a holiday.</P>
<P>So last summer was rather forgettable despite the fact we ran a man over
with a car, dumped his body in the sea and tried to lead normal lives
after. Perhaps next summer we should resurrect the two young lovers
separated by an accident and death. That way the monster with the hook
will be motivated to write uplifting notes like:</P>
<P>"I'm sorry I tried to kill you last summer. Let's kiss and make up."
"Forgive and Forget. Let's get together for a BBQ."
"Peace. I only use my hook for the laundry now."</P>
<P>There's nothing better than a peaceful solution to what happened last
summer.</P>
