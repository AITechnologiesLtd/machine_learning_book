<P>Susan Granger's review of "BRINGING OUT THE DEAD" (Paramount Pictures)</P>
<P> Martin Scorsese is one of our most respected auteurs but this
hollow melodrama is a major misfire. Marking the fourth collaboration
between Scorsese and writer Paul Schrader, it's an adaptation of Joe
Connelly's novel about the rescues and failures of a New York City
paramedic. Nicolas Cage plays a tormented EMS worker on the graveyard
shift in Hell's Kitchen who, in a week of full moons, is so
sleep-deprived that he wants nothing more than to be fired. Subsisting
on whiskey and cigarettes with an occasional pizza, he's a hyperactive
adrenaline-junkie, spiked by the surreal filth and loathing that
surround him and haunted by the face of an underage girl named Rose
whom he once failed to rescue. One night, this burnt-out wannabe hero
punches life back into the cardiac arrested chest of Mr. Burke, while
striking up a relationship with the man's estranged, ex-junkie
daughter, Patricia Arquette (Cage's real-life wife). As opposed to a
plot, the film consists of aimless, loosely connected episodes
narrated by Cage, working with a series of wacko partners. There's
John Goodman, who's resigned to holding on to his sanity amidst the
blood, pain, and despair; Tom Sizemore, who's heavily into violence
against the parasites of humanity; and Ving Rhames, who fancies
himself infused with the Holy Spirit. The camera technique is tricky,
the pace frantic, and the sound track filled with pop music with a
thumping bass. The eccentric characters say weird things which may
relate to guilt and redemption but that's not too clear. And there's a
crazy "Isn't-this-cool?" attitude when you realize that Scorsese
voices the ambulance dispatcher. But that's it. Nothing more. On the
Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Bringing Out the Dead" is a chaotic,
wretched, frenzied 3. It's so cool, it's stone cold.</P>
