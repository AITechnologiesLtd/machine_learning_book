<P>In 1989, Tim Burton took the legendary comic book figure of Batman and
turned him into  a huge box office hit with an atmospheric little film that
created an utterly distinct feeling somewhere between film noir and The
Godfather. Was it "deep"? Nope. However it was a perfect entertainment and
the audience ate it up. It was natural that Roger Ebert trashed it writing
that it was "without the comic book uplift" of the Indiana Jones and
Superman pictures. Which was true. If what you were looking for was the
tale of a heroic man's escadapes and adventures you were looking in the
wrong place. If those films were Tom Sawyer, then Batman was Huckleberry
Finn. Some critics ( Glenn Lovell of The San Jose Mercury News and Peter
Travers of Rolling Stone ) realized that it was something special; Mr.
Lovell gave it ***1/2 and wrote that "This is Batman as Batman should be.";
Mr. Travers called it one of the ten best films of the year. The praise was
deserved - from start to finish the film was enthralling, exciting, and
superb in every respect. There was no doubt that there would be a sequel
directed by Burton.</P>
<P>The result was Batman Returns which forgets that it wants to be fun within
the first five minutes.  The villains ( the hideous Penguin and seductive
Catwoman ) take over, and our epectations are always left unfulfilled -
when we wanted the Penguin to bite off Batman's nose he simply gets mad, 
and when we want Catwoman to slither over Batman's body she gets pushed off
a building. I admire Mr. Burton 
for trying to do more then entertain, but the result is a mess. Nothing
works out as planned - it fails both to entertain and to enlighten. Hints
are made to the audience that this film could be a blast. Alas, these are
only hints. There are, don't misunderstand me, several moments of cinematic
genuis contained; Catwoman and Batman understand eachother perfectly
without a word on the subject being said; Christopher Lloyd is trapped, by
the Penguin, within a giant cage; a small basket is dropped into a large
river; but nothing is drawn together and Burton is unable to make the film
work on any regular basis. A weak followup, both career and sequel wise,
Batman Returns is sometimes dazzling, but to often dissapointing.</P>
