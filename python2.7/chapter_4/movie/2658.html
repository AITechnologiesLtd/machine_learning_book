<PRE>                                    KIKA
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1994 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     KIKA is a Spanish film written and directed by Pedro Almodovar.  It
stars Veronica Forque, Victoria Abril, Peter Coyote, Alex Casanovas,
Rossy de Palma.  Rated NC-17--no one under 17 admitted because of sex
scenes, graphic rape scene.  English subtitles.</P>
<P>     KIKA represents a return to the earlier, more vital energy and
spirit of the older Almodovar films, the ones made before 1988's WOMEN
ON THE VERGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN (MUJERES AL BORDRE DE LA ATAQUE DE
NERVIOS) made him an international star director.  WOMEN ON THE VERGE
for all its style and wit is an experiment in artificiality, like the
deliberately unconvincing Madrid skyline as seen from the terrace of
Pepa's (Carmen Maura) apartment.  Or like the closing song, "Teatro
puro," WOMEN is pure theatricality, all style, in which life is a chic
joke made up of many little jokes.  KIKA, to some extent, shares these
qualities with WOMEN, but here the joke is a very dark one and
Almodovar returns to something like the anger of his earlier, pre-WOMEN
films, films like LAW OF DESIRE (1987) and WHAT HAVE I DONE TO DESERVE
THIS? (1985).</P>
<P>     And what symbolizes and encapsulates this dark, angry joke?
Television tabloid "news" shows and the end of privacy.  Victoria Abril
plays Andrea Scarface, the last word is exploitative, invasive, and
manipulative voyeurism, as host of "Today's Worst."  She hosts it
wearing dresses shredded, black, red, with artificial breasts exploding
through the bodices, like Morticia Addams after a bad experience with a
Cuisinart.  She even highlights with makeup the scar that gives her her
name.  In addition, she cruises around Madrid on a motorcycle and
wearing an outfit that makes her look like a Martian: her high-tech
leathers featuring camera lights for breasts (ever heard a woman's
breasts called headlights?) and topped off by a crash helmet with a
surmounting camcorder.  The video camera takes on a life and
personality of its own in one crucial scene and the question is where
is the human here--not the insensitive Andrea inside the suit, not the
suit with its buttons and controls, maybe the camcorder?  Abril is an
extraordinary actress with staggering powers of invention, who can be
sinister, funny, and pathetic at the same time.</P>
<P>     Kika herself is played with exhausting energy by Veronica Forque,
she of the hyperactive motormouth, a makeup artist who meets her future
husband, Ramon, when she's called upon to make up his presumably dead
corpse.  Ramon is played by Alex Casanovas in a typical Almodovar male
role--withdrawn, uncommunicative, secretive, a cipher.  It's the women
Almodovar loves to depict and explore in his films; men, he says, bore
him.  Kika gets to do a little growing up in the course of the film and
it is she who must suffer the now infamous rape of the film, infamous
because the scene is played for laughs.  She's scared, she's in danger,
she's mad at the rapist, a former porno star who's escaped from prison,
but she also wants him not to take all afternoon.  She has things to
do.  It's what comes afterwards that is the real rape in this case, the
police, the husband, and especially the helmeted camera of Andrea who
wants to interview the victim as she's comes out of the shower.  This
is the point that critics who condemn this film miss.  There is nothing
funny about this second rape.  It's far and away the more damaging and
leads directly to bloodshed and death.</P>
<P>     Also in the cast and complicating the story are Peter Coyote as
Ramon's stepfather and lover to just about ever women in the film,
Santiago Lajusticia, as the rapist, and Rossy de Palma, she of the
Picasso face, here playing Kika's lesbian maid and sister of the
rapist.  Almodovar is the consummate actors' director and he continues
to get the most astonishing performances out of his actors.</P>
<P>     KIKA has its faults.  At 120 minutes, it is too long to sustain
itself.  It should have concentrated more on Andrea Scarface and less
on Kika, a not very interesting person before her rape, as superficial
as her makeup.  Abril was supposedly given her choice of which
character to play.  She chose wisely.</P>
<P>     Nevertheless, I highly recommend KIKA to you.  It has the flash,
wit, and style of WOMEN ON THE VERGE, the standard for better or worse
by which all Almodovar films are judged, as well as the rage and
satiric bite of his earlier work.</P>
