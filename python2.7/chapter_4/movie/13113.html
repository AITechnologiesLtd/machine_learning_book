<PRE>DIRTY WORK
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Like so many other former Saturday Night Live-ers before him, Norm
Macdonald attempts to make the jump to feature films...and falls flat on
his face. Dirty Work is an embarrassingly bland comic failure.</P>
<P>Macdonald stars as Mitch Weaver, a pathetic loser who can't hold a
steady job or even a girlfriend.  He has only one good friend, Sam
(Artie Lange), whose father (Jack Warden) is in desperate need of a
$50,000 heart transplant... money that neither Sam nor Mitch have.</P>
<P>All looks bleak until Mitch discovers a way to make money from his one
true talent:  creating elaborate revenge schemes.  He and Sam start up
Dirty Work, a revenge-for-hire business.  They help people to get
even...from little old ladies to billionaire Travis Cole (Christopher
McDonald). But will they be able to make enough money in time?  And will
anyone stay in the theater long enough to find out?</P>
<P>The film boasts a wide variety of cameos.  Chevy Chase, Don Rickles,
Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, John Goodman, and even Gary Coleman all
appear at one time or another. But aside from simple shock value, they
have very little to add.</P>
<P>Norm Macdonald doesn't have much of a repertoire here.  His one smug
tone might make him a good straight man...but it doesn't work well when
he's supposed to be the comic center of the film.  The film simply hops
from one oddly bland revenge gag to another with little humor in
between.</P>
<P>There are slight glimmers here and there of moments of humor trying to
break free in the film's darker moments.  When Dirty Work unknowingly
pulls a revenge prank on a bunch of murderous drug lords, for example,
the movie skates eerily close to humor.  Alas, what could have been a
quirky dark comedy quickly collapses back into the dull, stale routine.</P>
<P>There may be a good film lurking in the heart of Norm Macdonald...but
Dirty Work shows that it's buried deep.</P>
