<PRE>La Strada (1954)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 56</PRE>
<P>Every now and then I come across a film that is
universally acclaimed, but when I finally see
it, I cannot give it a high grade.  This is
always a downer experience for me, for I would
much preferred to have enjoyed the film as others
have.  I end up writing a review that will convince
no one, and will simply generate strong disagreement.
Such is the case for Italian writer/director
Federico Fellini's "La Strada", which translates
to "The Road" in English.</P>
<P>"La Strada" has received universal critical praise.
It was the first Oscar winner in the category of
Best Foreign Language Film.  The British Academy
Awards nominated it for Best Film, and it won the
New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Foreign
Language film.  It won at the Bodil Festival for
Best European Film.  "La Strada" remains highly
regarded today, especially given the success of
Fellini's subsequent films.</P>
<P>"La Strada" starred Fellini's wife, Giulietta Masina,
who plays a simple peasant woman named Gelsomina.
She is sold in marriage to Zampano (Anthony Quinn),
a growling bear of a man who ekes out a living as
a circus and street performer.  Their marriage is
not happy, but Gelsomina stays with Zampano because
she doesn't want him to go through life alone.
That is to say, she loves him despite his abusive
and animalistic ways.  By film's end, it is apparent
that Zampano has loved her in return.</P>
<P>Zampano joins a circus, where he is ridiculed by
Matto (Richard Basehart), an engaging clown.  Matto
befriends Gelsomina, and teaches her that despite the
humbleness of her life, she is not worthless.  Soon,
however, Zampano attacks Matto, resulting in tragedies
for all concerned.</P>
<P>I feel sorry for Gelsomina, Matto and even Zampano.
The characters have depth and are well cast: Quinn
reminds me of Toshiro Mifune when playing a wild man,
and Masina is a capable mime.  Still, the magic that
so many others have found in "La Strada" completely
escapes me.  Quinn does his 'lungs of iron' routine
over and over.  A truck is dumped over a bridge and
bursts in flames, which seems unlikely and out of
place.  Basehart only has a few scenes, and Quinn's
character is limited, so the film's worth rests on
Masina's character and performance.  Her performance
is good, but her character is a simpleton, capable
only of alternately smiling and moping.  Zampano's
fist-pounding misery at film's end also seems
unlikely for his brutish, unreflective character.</P>
<P>But, this is only my opinion, and it has to be
tempered by the fact that nearly everyone else who
has seen the film thinks much better of it.</P>
