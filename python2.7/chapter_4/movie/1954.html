<PRE>                       WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT
                   A film review by David N. Butterworth
        Copyright 1993 David N. Butterworth/The Summer Pennsylvanian</PRE>
<P>     Little Anna Mae Bullock sure loves to belt it out during her
Sunday morning gospel choir sessions, so much so that this young,
disruptive prodigy is often dragged outside.  Make no bones about it,
this kid can sing.  But life in Nutbush, Tennessee isn't all sunshine
and song.  Before we know it, her mother and elder sister have packed
their bags for St.  Louis, leaving the sad and frightened Anna Mae
behind.</P>
<P>     "Anna Mae who?" you may ask yourself.  "Never heard of her."  Well
maybe you know her better by her stage name.  Tina Turner.</P>
<P>     WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT is a straightforward but thoroughly
irresistible biopic of the sultry rock legend who finally struck out on
her own after suffering years of abuse at the hands of husband and
mentor, Ike Turner.  The film is based on I, TINA, the 1986 biography
co-authored by Turner and MTV straight man Kurt Loder, and stars Angela
Bassett in an impassioned performance as the big-haired and big-heeled
pop diva.</P>
<P>     Twelve years after being abandoned, Anna Mae joins her estranged
family in St.  Louis, where she is bowled over by the sights and sounds
of life in the big city.  One such sound is that of lounge singer Ike
Turner (played by Laurence Fishburne), whose band performs in the
nightclub at which sister Jackie (Vanessa Bell Calloway) tends bar.
It's open-mike night, and before long that shiny metallic object is
dangled in front of Anna Mae.  The expression on her sister's face when
Anna Mae cranks out a gutsy blues version of "(Darlin') You Know I Love
You" is priceless.  A star is born.</P>
<P>     Ike takes Anna Mae under his wing and before long she's on the
road to stardom with a new name and a future.  But there's a price to
pay for success.</P>
<P>     The film contains more black eyes and bloody noses than ROCKY.
Like SWEET DREAMS, COAL MINER'S DAUGHTER, and LADY SINGS THE BLUES
before it, WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT is a tragic chronicle of the
physical abuse suffered by one of our most beloved female
entertainers.  The scenes of domestic violence are extremely potent and
painful to watch.  Tina's explanation for enduring Ike's viciousness for
so long is "I know what it's like to have your own flesh and blood walk
out on you."  But when she finally finds the strength to fight back,
the crowd goes wild.</P>
<P>     Fishburne is excellent in a very unsympathetic role.  Ike Turner
could so easily have been portrayed as one-dimensional, but the
talented Fishburne gives this frightened wife-beater some depth.</P>
<P>     Angela Bassett, too, has done her homework.  Although she doesn't
physically resemble her, Bassett's body language and stage persona are
pure Tina Turner.  One of the film's many musical highlights is the
"Shake a Tail Feather" sequence, a loving recreation of Phil Spector's
THE BIG T.N.T.  SHOW.  Here Bassett struts her stuff with uncanny
accuracy.  The way she chases around the stage; the way she trails her
left arm behind her as she gyrates; the way she tips her head and
flicks her hair--all Tina Turner.  The lip-synching isn't always
perfect, but you'll be so caught up in the film's emotional energy that
you'll barely notice.  Turner did re-record some numbers for the film,
and her voice is as raspy and seductive as ever.</P>
<P>     It's a little eerie watching a movie about a rock star who's still
alive, and cutting to concert footage of the real Tina Turner at the
film's conclusion is somewhat jarring, as it tends to de-emphasize
Bassett's fine work in the film (especially when the transition from
teenager to middle-aged woman has been handled so deftly).  But it's a
small nitpick.</P>
<P>     Propelled by two star-making performances, WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO
WITH IT is an infectious, energetic musical experience that doesn't
attempt to smooth over the sordid details of Tina Turner's life.  It's
a success story with heart, and soul.</P>
