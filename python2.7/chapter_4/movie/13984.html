<P>Note: Some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers.
      Be forewarned. </P>
<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   The remaking of classic films, always a risky artistic proposition,
   is under scrutiny more than ever these days by the cynical and savvy
   masses -- consider the current sentiment of disapproval at Gus Van
   Sant's ongoing recreation of Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO, prompting
   cineastes to collectively shake their heads and wail in dismay.
   "Don't remake masterpieces!" thundered Roger Ebert on a recent
   episode of his weekly television program.  "If it works, don't fix
   it!"</P>
<P>   While film buffs passionately rail against remakes, it's easy to
   understand why studios continue to churn them out at prodigious
   rates.  There's a certain name recognition carried over from the
   earlier versions which reduces the effort involved to sell the new
   flicks to the public -- no longer is there a need to enticingly
   sketch the movie's elements ("There's a guy, see, and he *really*
   loves his mother...") when everybody's familiar with the original --
   and a nostalgic fondness that's culled from audiences' memories of
   the tried-and-true predecessors.  Even skeptical cynics are counted
   upon to grudgingly drag themselves to the theatre to partake remakes
   of old favourites, if only to witness how the new version bastardizes
   their beloved original.  Remakes aren't always risk-free commercial
   endeavours -- witness, for example, at the crash-and-burn of Jeremiah
   Chechik's edition of DIABOLIQUE (that he's behind the helm for the
   upcoming cinematic adaptation of THE AVENGERS is suddenly not
   particularly reassuring) or the decidedly mediocre performance of
   Andrew Davis' recent A PERFECT MURDER -- but there's a bit of a
   safety buffer.</P>
<P>   No studio in recent years has been cannibalizing its past hits as
   much as Disney.  Admittedly, none of the revisited originals would
   classify as masterpieces -- I feel safe assuming THAT DARN CAT!
   didn't *just* miss the cut on the AFI list -- but Team Mouse is
   meddling in a particularly tempestuous kettle: beloved family
   classics.  I suspect that the public would scarcely bat an eye should
   a half-assed version of CITIZEN KANE churn out the pipe, but a
   filmmaker who desecrates iconic crowdpleasers like THE WIZARD OF OZ
   had better assume a new identity and move to the tropics.  So far,
   Disney's faring remarkably well -- among others, FLUBBER, DR.
   DOLITTLE, and THE NUTTY PROFESSOR have been unqualified box-office
   hits -- but with the release of the Nancy Meyer-helmed version of THE
   PARENT TRAP they're treading on especially shaky ground.  (The 1961
   original, a cross-generational hit starring Hayley Mills, was so
   revered by the younger set in its day that this edition's top-billed
   actor, Dennis Quaid, freely admits that his involvement in the
   project was due to his child.)</P>
<P>   Avowed curmudgeons would do best to avoid the newest version of THE
   PARENT TRAP, a film so sunny and cheerful that extended exposure will
   cause surly audience members to undergo allergic convulsions.  A rare
   picture whose photobook conclusion feels truly earned rather than
   obligatorily appended, its slick, high-spirited nature and eager,
   almost desperate willingness to please is winning, and the film
   benefits from its great casting (Mr. Quaid, charming; Natasha
   Richardson, luminous; Lindsay Lohan, darling), but in terms of
   fundamental filmmaking and storytelling it's sometimes irritatingly
   uninspired.</P>
<P>   Obviously, there's a requisite of faithfulness to the original film,
   and one hardly expects inventive or groundbreaking filmmaking in a
   carefully-crafted family picture, but novice director Ms. Meyer has
   the frustrating tendency to repetitively go for the most obvious gag
   possible, making the entire two hour-plus experience vaguely tedious.
   If there's a blatant establishing shot of a needlessly perfunctory
   swimming pool, you can bet that somebody's going to fall in.
   Likewise, even sly visual send-ups aimed at older audiences are
   similarly telegraphed; Beatles fans should spot the film's quick
   homage coming a mile away.  Most of the humour is similarly impaired:
   breezily pleasant but not particularly witty.  (I did like one line
   regarding the villainess' spelling aptitude.)  It's all competently
   helmed, but not particularly engaging.</P>
<P>   I found the film's first half hour to be especially worrisome.  It
   starts off well enough, with both separated twins Hallie Parker (Ms.
   Lohan) and Annie James (ditto) arriving at summer camp to inevitably
   reunite, but when Annie and her mother's trusty butler Martin (Simon
   Kunz) spontaneously burst out into a choreographed hand-slapping,
   hip-swiveling dance, it all seemed a bit Too Precious.  Later scenes
   including Hallie arriving for a late-night poker session, decked in
   black leather and sunglasses and backed by a rock guitar soundtrack,
   and an insanely elaborate camp prank staged like a Wile E. Coyote
   scheme weren't very reassuring.  Fortunately, the picture does pick
   up when the two girls finally realize their blood ties and set out on
   their grand master plan to reunite their long-divorced parents.  (And
   I enjoyed the scene where naughty Hallie and Annie are banished to
   the camp's clearly-labelled Isolation Cabin, which is probably bigger
   and better furnished than my house.)</P>
<P>   The bulk of the film rests upon the capable shoulders of Ms. Lohan,
   who seamlessly plays both twins (often opposite "herself") and imbues
   Annie with a reasonably credible British accent.  The lively young
   freckled redhead is great fun to watch and makes for a wonderfully
   charming set of protagonists, full of spunk and sly spirit, although
   ultimately her dual roles act simply as a device to set up the
   rekindling romance between Nick Parker (Mr. Quaid, who's given a
   great introductory shot and whose wide grin is disarmingly likeable)
   and Elizabeth James (Ms. Richardson).  He owns a vineyard; she's a
   bridal gown designer; they're obviously made for each other, and it's
   just a matter of time before all the pieces fall into place.  As a
   dramatic obstacle, a vampy fiancee named Meredith Blake (gamely
   played by Elaine Hendrix) is introduced, and the film provides comic
   relief in the form of the kooky help -- the aforementioned Martin as
   well as Nick's straight-shooting nanny Chessy (Lisa Ann Walter) --
   but it all boils down to the romantic core of the picture, whose
   spectre dominates the final third of the film and is played out with
   warmth and simplicity.</P>
<P>   Overlooking some of the story's implications -- what sort of parents
   would shield their daughters from the knowledge that they have a twin
   sister? -- it's interesting to examine the basic appeal of this
   story.  I think it's derived not from wacky hijinx, but from the
   empowering notion that the twins are able to right a wrong and
   against all odds succeed in reuniting their parents; in this case,
   Daughters Know Best.  This film has a bit more of the former than I'd
   prefer, but thanks to fine performances by the cast, the latter
   aspect shines through with good-natured amiability.</P>

"...a first screenplay unaccompanied by a powerful agent or industry
