<P>If you charted the success of Sam Raimi's films on a graph, it would
look like a big `W.'  He started with the deliciously diabolical Evil
Dead trilogy and the first Darkman film, only to follow them up with the
extremely disappointing The Quick and the Dead.  Raimi rebounded with
the amazing A Simple Plan, but then, in a surprise to the director's
fans, he decided to make a baseball film with Kevin Costner.  Baseball?
Kevin Costner?  Fool me once (Bull Durham), shame on you.  Fool me twice
(Field of Dreams), shame on me.  Fool me three times (For Love of the
Game), and you'd better be wearing some kind of protection over your
private parts.</P>
<P>Luckily, Raimi's latest film, a welcome return to the frightening fare
that made him famous, is a big step in the right direction (his next
project is the new Spider-Man film).  The Gift is a nifty little
thriller with a terrific cast full of recent Oscar winners and nominees,
highlighted by a strong performance from Cate Blanchett (The Talented
Mr. Ripley).  Raimi proves he can still make with the creepy, but The
Gift has the misfortune of following three of the best hair-raisers in
quite some time (What Lies Beneath, The Sixth Sense and The Blair Witch
Project).  It's moody, atmospheric and, at times, downright unnerving,
but The Gift just isn't in the same league.</P>
<P>The film's first five minutes establish Annie Wilson (Blanchett) as a
recently widowed single mother with three children who live in the
swampy Georgia burg of Brixton.  She's a psychic, but more of a social
worker to her customers than a carnival sideshow act.  Annie prods
people to call their doctors when she sees something in her tarot cards
that indicate a medical problem.  When one client (Hilary Swank, Boys
Don't Cry) appears to have been beaten by her husband, Annie desperately
tries to talk her into leaving the brute (Keanu Reeves, The
Replacements).  She is admired and respected by the people she helps and
regarded as a bride of Satan/witch doctor/voodoo high priestess by the
rest of the redneck town.</P>
<P>The Gift's story, co-written by Plan's Oscar-nominated actor Billy Bob
Thornton and his One False Move and A Family Thing writing partner Tom
Epperson, centers on the disappearance of a local girl named Jessica
(Katie Holmes, Wonder Boys), who is engaged to the school principal
(Greg Kinnear, Loser) and the daughter of a prominent businessman.  Like
Laura Palmer, Jessica was a hot, young nymphomaniac, doing pretty much
every guy in Brixton, and eventually her nude carcass is discovered in a
body of water.  And, like Twin Peaks, Brixton is a town full of kooky
suspects, each of which seem to have a motive in Jessica's murder.
There's enough red herring here to fill Brixton's swamp.</P>
<P>Showing he's no stranger to the horror genre, Raimi fills The Gift with
enough of Annie's unnerving flashes forward and backward to keep you on
the edge of your seat.  When you can feel the tension in an audience
rise by a character simply drawing a bath, you know the director is
doing something right.  There is an awkward courtroom scene that feels
out of place, but, for the most part, Raimi does a very good job keeping
the somewhat clunky story moving along.  The supporting cast does well
(even Keanu) and seems to be having a pretty good time acting like
hillbillies (look for Danny Elfman in a two-second cameo as a
fiddle-playing hayseed).  But The Gift is as much Blanchett's film to
carry as it is Raimi's.  And they both do a splendid job.</P>
<P>1:51 – R for adult language, violence, nudity, sexual content and some
disturbing imagery</P>
