<PRE>                            THE LAST SEDUCTION
                       A film review by Rich Siegel
                        Copyright 1995 Rich Siegel</PRE>
<P>Starring: Linda Fiorentino,  Peter Berg,  J.T. Walsh,  Bill Pullman
Directed by:  John Dahl
Screenplay:  Steve Barancik
Produced by: Jonathan Shestack
Released by: October Films</P>
<P>     THE LAST SEDUCTION is director John Dahl's follow up to his
sleeper hit RED ROCK WEST, and like his prior film, this one involves
a decent, honest, albeit somewhat naive small town guy who unwittingly
gets between a criminal couple who've developed a rather lethal dislike
for each other.  In this case, small town insurance adjuster Mike
Swale (Peter Berg) falls for Bridget Gregory (Linda Fiorentino), a
mysterious no-nonsense, tough-talking  New Yorker who shows up at his
hometown bar and immediately bowls him over with her sophisticated
style and unselfconscious expression of her sexual needs.  What Mike
doesn't know is: she's hiding out from her crooked-doctor husband Clay
(Bill Pullman) from whom she's just stolen all the proceeds from a big,
once-in-a-lifetime drug deal he's just completed.</P>
<P>     The film centers on Bridget, who's brutally cold and manipulating,
a natural-born grifter.  She unfolds her crafty schemes to safeguard
her stolen fortune with the cool precision of a master spy from the old
"Mission Impossible" TV series.  You can almost see her mind racing ahead
of each scene,  planning just the right moves to keep the hapless
Mike--or anyone else she needs to control--on her string.</P>
<P>     Linda Fiorentino is a joy to watch in this role.  Despite her
character's utter lack of kindness or conscience, her virtually
unshakable confidence, her wit and her sexual brashness  make her
character engaging and enjoyable to watch.</P>
<P>     Bill Pullman, as Bridget's husband Clay, is effective as a sort of
pale reflection of Bridget.  While he has the same basic sensibilities
as his wife, he just doesn't have the smarts or talent to compete with
her.</P>
<P>     Peter Berg's Mike is an appropriately self-conscious yokel; keenly
aware of his lack of sophistication and judgment when it comes to "city
girls." He's not stupid--well, maybe a little;  But basically, he's
just a regular guy.  Against the likes of Bridget, however, he has no
chance.</P>
<P>     Bridget's lawyer (J. T. Walsh) is the only person Bridget seems to
have any respect for.  He provides Bridget with sage advice and moral
support over the telephone.  He's the only one who understands her true
nature: "Anyone check you for a heartbeat lately?", he asks her at one
point.</P>
<P>     THE LAST SEDUCTION is tighter and more suspenseful than RED ROCK
WEST.  The dialog is crisp and to the point.  The cool-but-tense feel
of the film is sustained throughout.   The understated jazz score by
John Vitarelli adds the perfect mood to this very enjoyable film.</P>
<P>Rated: R - (language, nudity, sexual situations)</P>
