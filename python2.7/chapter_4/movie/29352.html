<PRE>THE MONKEY'S MASK
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>Samantha Lang's THE MONKEY'S MASK is about nudity and bad poetry -- really bad
poetry.  The nudity is in the context of a lesbian affair that's about as
convincing as a Playboy photo shoot.  There is also a murder mystery of sorts,
but, with the film going in what feels like slow motion, you'll probably not
care.  If the film works for you at all, it's likely to be as a guilty pleasure
for the eye candy it parades before you.  There may be little genuine chemistry
between the two leads, Susie Porter, a petite woman with reddish brown hair and
a million freckles, and Kelly McGillis (WITNESS), who is over a head taller and
much older, but you can't deny that they both look terrific in the buff.</P>
<P>As the story starts, private investigator Jill Fitzpatrick (Porter) is asked to
investigate the disappearance of Mickey Norris (Abbie Cornish), a college
student and the story's worst poet.  When Jill goes to interview Mickey's poetry
professor, Diana Maitland (McGillis), she quickly gets the hots for her. 
Although it is clear that the professor is a prime suspect in Mickey's
disappearance, Jill and Diana spend much of the movie naked in each other's
arms.  At one point, the professor compliments Jill's ability in bed while
mocking her detective skills.  So true.  Jill could have had a great retort
given that the professor's success in developing young poets was pretty
laughable.</P>
<P>The director never gets a credible performance out of any of the actors.  It is
as if she kept forgetting to yell, "Action!" before having the cameras roll. 
Speaking of cameras, Garry Phillips's cinematography is the one bright spot of
the movie.  Using a blend of extreme close-ups set off center and stunning
widescreen shots, he creates a look that's much better than the material
deserves.</P>
<P>Of course, the lack of chemistry in what is really a lesbian love story, not a
murder mystery, is the movie's biggest problem.  But beyond that there are so
many smaller problems that begin to grate on you.  The clichés abound.  When we
get to see the college student's bedroom, it is filled to overflowing with teddy
bears like a little girl's room in order to emphasize her vulnerability.  The
dialog is not only trite and overblown -- "You lesbo!" being one insult -- but
hard to catch since the actors have a proclivity for speaking only in whispers. 
 On the other hand, maybe missing some of the lines isn't such a bad thing after
all.   Missing the entire movie, however, would be a better idea.</P>
<P>THE MONKEY'S MASK runs a long 1:33.  It is not rated but would probably be NC-17
for strong sex scenes, pervasive nudity, language and some violent images.  It
would be acceptable for high school seniors and older.</P>
<P>The film is playing in limited release now in the United States.  In the Silicon
Valley, it is showing at the Camera Cinemas.</P>
