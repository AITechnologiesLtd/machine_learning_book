<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>If you've seen any number of American independent films in recent
years, you've no doubt run across the ubiquitous PARTY GIRL herself,
Parker Posey, who seems to literally appear in every third recent
movie.  From early 1997 releases like Christopher Guest's WAITING FOR
GUFFMAN, Greg Motolla's THE DAYTRIPPERS, Richard Linklater's
subUrbia, and Peter Cohn's DRUNKS to upcoming films such as Jill
Sprecher's feature debut CLOCKWATCHERS and a reunion with Hal Hartley
in HENRY FOOL, Ms. Posey is, along with the similarly-prolific Lili
Taylor, the reigning Queen of the Indies, and has been extremely
impressive throughout her career with her sassy, infectiuously
energetic and dynamic performances.  Her astonishing vivacious turn
in Mark Waters' debut film THE HOUSE OF YES, for which she was
awarded a Special Outstanding Performance prize earlier this year at
the 19th edition of the Sundance Film Festival, is the pivotal
performance in her career, and should serve as her big breakout role
into mainstream recognition and future stardom.</P>
<P>While most black comedies typically feature one or two decidedly
eccentric characters in order to heighten the inherently perverse
natures of their plots, the witty THE HOUSE OF YES deliciously takes
this concept a bit further -- virtually every character in the film
is quirky and bizarre to varying degrees except for cheery,
sweet-natured donut shop waitress Lesly (Tori Spelling), who acts as
the audience surrogate and plays as the interloper into the strange,
deranged world of the Pascal family.  Set on a stormy Thanksgiving
evening, conventionally handsome Marty Pascal (Josh Hamilton) returns
home with new fiancee Lesly, looking every bit like a fresh-faced
wholesome young couple, to his strikingly odd and scandalous clan:
dim and overly eager-to-please younger brother Anthony (Freddie
Prinze Jr.), supercilious and largely-preoccupied matriarch Mrs.
Pascal (Genevieve Bujold), and, most notably, his recently
deinstitutionalized and highly emotionally volatile twin sister (Ms.
Posey), who goes by the name Jackie-O and is completely obsessed with
the former First Lady to the point of trotting about the house
sporting a pageboy hairdo, in various looks immortalized by the late
Jacqueline Onassis: pink Chanel ensemble complete with pillbox hat,
or simple black dress with strand of pearls.  Jackie-O's fixations
aren't limited to the late First Lady; acerbic and hysterical while
preparing for Marty's return, she greets her twin brother at the
front door with a euphoric, impassioned embrace befitting that of a
savior, virtually vaulting herself into his arms.  When the inclement
weather knocks out the power and causes a hasty postponement of
Thanksgiving dinner, Mrs. Pascal retreats into the darkness, leaving
the four young characters to make do for the remainder of the
evening, and by candlelight the sordid family secrets of Lesley's
future in-laws are gradually revealed.</P>
<P>The antecedent of THE HOUSE OF YES as a 1990 stage play penned by
Wendy MacLeod (which had a long, successful run in San Francisco) is
clearly evident from the single locale and the heavy reliance on
dialogue to drive the plot forward.  However, despite a faithful
adaptation of Ms. MacLeod's play by Mr. Waters in his screenplay, the
stage roots of THE HOUSE OF YES do not prove to be restrictive --
indeed, attempts to greatly open up the story for the film medium
would likely destroy the claustrophobic tone set early in the film
and shatter the metaphoric barrier separating the unique world of the
Pascal family from normalcy, undermining the depiction of their
disturbed behaviour and resulting in their appearance coming off more
as ridiculous than distinctively quirky.</P>
<P>While THE HOUSE OF YES is a highly stylized and peculiar black comedy
with a truly inspired storyline, its clear strength is its wholly
original dialogue.  The film's astonishingly clever banter is wicked,
biting, and hysterical, and Mr. Waters' makes a fine feature debut
with his confident, assured helming of THE HOUSE OF YES, with some
inspired kinetic camera work and crisp cutting of the terrific verbal
interplay in an effectively precise, rhythmic pattern.  An inspired
and inventive opening sequence is wonderfully realised.  Mr. Waters'
ability to guide the film between viciously comic and stirringly
dramatic scenes are most impressive and clearly evident, and his
solid, capable work here heralds him as a promising new talent.</P>
<P>While the remainder of the ensemble cast of THE HOUSE OF YES is
generally solid, there can be no doubt that this film essentially
belongs to Ms. Posey, who dominates throughout with her wonderfully
entertaining and captivating performance.  An on-screen dynamo with
remarkable intensity, she can turn from delightfully witty and
hilariously cruel to remarkably unstable and utterly pathetic on a
dime, and Ms. Posey's rendition of Jackie-O is a completely
fascinating creation: a needy, fragile, and helpless mentally ill
young woman with a barely-suppressed hysteria who nonetheless lords
over the household by sheer audacity.  Hers is easily the most
interesting character in the film, and one is left wanting more when
she's offscreen.  Her delivery of the volley of stinging barbs at Ms.
Spelling's hapless character is brilliant -- savage and gleeful.
It's a stunning performance, highlighted by Ms. Posey's customary
fierce energy and mercurial appeal, and one which should catapult her
into the limelight.</P>
<P>"Independent film is where the heart is and where the stories are,"
Ms. Posey once commented, but after her triumphant performance in the
vastly entertaining THE HOUSE OF YES, it will be interesting to
observe how she reacts when Hollywood begins to pursue her with a
vigor.</P>
