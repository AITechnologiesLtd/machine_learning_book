<PRE>                        UNDER THE SAND (Sous le sable)
                        A film review by Jeremiah Kipp

<P>François Ozon has been busy the last couple of years dickering around
with the crude sensationalism of Sitcom and Criminal Lovers, films that
resemble biting the heads off chickens.  This talented young auteur
offers a welcome change of pace from this recent spate of puerile
shock-value thrillers with the restrained, quietly haunting character
study, Under the Sand.  Ozon's latest feature returns to the quietly
haunting rigor of his first international success, See the Sea:
disturbing, minimalist, perceptive.</P>
<P>Much of the tension in Ozon's best work remains unspoken, or
deliberately unexplained.  In that spirit, he concocts a delicious
mystery in the extended opening sequence as middle aged professor Marie
Drillon (Charlotte Rampling, superb as ever) enjoys an annual summer
vacation to the south of France with her husband of 25 years, Jean
(giant teddy bear Bruno Cremer).  They seem a happy couple, comfortable
in their silences as they go about the routines of putting their chateau
in order, cooking meals, sunbathing on the beach.  Jean goes for a swim
one day, but to Marie's shock, he never comes back.</P>
<P>What became of her husband?  Did he accidentally get caught in an
undertow and drown, or was it suicide?  Or perhaps he never told her how
much he hated her, and just ran away to begin a new life?  Rather than
deal with these questions, Marie returns to her ordinary habits.  Her
friends become increasingly concerned when, six months later, she still
carries on as if Jean remains a part of her life.  With no proof that
he's gone forever, she's happy to delude herself.  Her relations and
colleagues attempt to ignore this unusual behavior, even attempting to
set her up with a new beau (sheepish character actor Jacques Nolot, from
Nenette and Boni).  How long can she go on pretending, and what will she
do if Jean is ever found?</P>
<P>Interesting roles for middle-aged women are hard to come by.  Charlotte
Rampling has been blessed this year to appear as virile, sexually
attractive older women in this formidable performance as well as in
Jonathan Nossiter's intriguing Signs and Wonders.  Marie is not a
particularly wonderful person -- she takes her husband for granted and
treats her would-be lover like dog shit.  But she's smart, graceful,
fiercely independent -- and though she's gone a bit too far consoling
herself in ghostly dreams, Rampling invests her choices with dignity.</P>
<P>The opening scenes bear a passing resemblance to the striking Dutch
psycho-drama The Vanishing, but Ozon quickly slows things down for a
meditative, observational character study that fills the 95 minute
running time.  This is slow, heady stuff that a mainstream audience
might find tedious, but Ozon wisely eschews the obtuse art house
pretensions of Krzyzstof Kieslowski's Blue (another study in mourning). 
Ozon may not always reveal every piece of information, but he keeps his
narrative clear and precise.  At least we know what's being cropped out
of the picture.</P>
<P>Ozon depends heavily on Rampling's performance, which carries him
through sections of Under the Sand that feel overly repetitive.  For all
his talents, he remains more comfortable with the short film format,
struggling to fill the running time of a feature length story.  Still,
if Under the Sand is any indication, Ozon is gaining confidence with his
low-key parables of cinematic dread.  We're looking forward to seeing
where this enfant terrible goes next.  Those crazy French...</P>
