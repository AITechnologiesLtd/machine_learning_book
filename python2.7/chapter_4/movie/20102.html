<P>   Coincidentally, the New York Times Circuits section that
came out on the day of the critics' screening of "The Muse"
highlighted a directory of software that can be used by
screenwriters.  The software includes Plots Unlimited, which
gives the writer logical options among 5,000 situations;
WritePro, which takes the user through essential rules for
creating well-written material; John Truby's Blockbuster, for
brainstorming a plot; and DramaticaPro, which advises the
scripter about motivations, inner thoughts, moral dilemmas
and courses of action.  I'd guess that whoever actually does
get a play onto the screen using computer help is going to
receive critical notices that call the movie "apparently written
by a computer."</P>
<P>   If computers are not the answer, just how does a dramatist
get ideas that are saleable?  Chances are most who are
successful at this difficult and highly competitive trade have
the knack, the talent, the genius at knowing what will come
across to an audience.  For some gifted people, the notions
for new movies pop into their heads annually.  Look at
Woody Allen, for example, who no sooner finishes one work
than he is busy filming another.  Others need inspiration:
they're the kinds of people who may go for a decade or so
without a single good idea and suddenly become enkindled. 
"The Muse," which is directed, co-written, and stars Albert
Brooks deals with the latter situation.  Brooks, performing in
the role of Steven Phillips, a screenwriter who has lost his
edge, has just been fired by Paramount Studios and doesn't
know how he's going to feed his family of four.</P>
<P>   "The Muse" is an imaginative yarn, yet another movie
following closely on the heels of "Bowfinger." Like that vehicle
for Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy, this one sends up the
unique culture which is Hollywood--a town filled with a small
number of successful studio department heads, producers,
writers and directors and afflicted as well with many times
that many wannabees and has-beens.  Brooks, one of our
most talented and successful comics who has done great
work in "Defending Your Life" (considered by one critic to be
"imperfect, like all of Brooks's movies, but hard to dislike"),
and "Lost in America" (co-written, as is this one, by Monica
Johnson, a send-up of yuppies), is true to form with a movie
having a sit-comish design.  Brooks, who was a regular on
TV programs hosted by Ed Sullivan, Johnny Carson and
Merv Griffin, frames his comedies around punch lines,
presumably to be judged by how many sequences draw the
laughs or chuckles and how many fall flat.  Happily, most of
the gags this time around can be appreciated, especially by
an audience of regular moviegoers who are hip to Hollywood
society with its celebrity chefs, producers who do lunch with
their talent, and actors who consider themselves princes and
princesses deserving all the benefits of a world enamored of
American cinema.</P>
<P>   Brooks's character, Steven Phillips, has just received the
"humanitarian" award at a dinner presided over by Cybill
Shepherd, who announces that the man has written
seventeen films, "some of which are about the human
condition."  At home with his wife, Laura (Andie MacDowell)
and his two daughters, he is asked what the award means
and explains that this is what is given to people who do not
win Oscars.  Much of the humor throughout the 97-minute
movie are of this self-deprecatory nature as Brooks runs
through the role of a slightly neurotic and anxiety-ridden
author. (This is sort of role that could have been played as
well by Woody Allen.)  Phillips's friend, Jack Warrick (Jeff
Bridges), advises him to consult an actual living muse--
explaining that the muses in Greek mythology are nine
children of Zeus whose role is to inspire people in the arts. 
Phillips consults with Sarah (Sharon Stone), the alleged
source of inspiration, hoping to get back on track.  He soon
finds that Sarah is more a princess than a god, insisting that
if she is to do her job properly she must be put up in the
city's most expensive hotel, be treated to expensive gifts, and
even given the run of Phillips's home.  At various points in
the film, Sarah is visited by the grateful people whom she has
inspired, including Martin Scorsese (who does an amusing
job as a motormouth who seems to have overdosed on
Starbucks), Wolfgang Puck, Rob Reiner, and James
Cameron--all playing themselves.</P>
<P>   If Brooks successfully performs in the role of an annoying
pest, constantly sniveling about the hand he's been dealt by
unappreciative producers, Sharon Stone is even more notable
in her portrayal of a woman who exploits her godlike position
to extract expensive gratuities.  </P>
<P>   The point to "The Muse" is that the creative people in
Hollywood are on a different planet, one which has furnished
the chic set nationwide with such benefits as bottled water,
arugula, sun-dried tomatoes, and in this case, the world's
best cookies.  The picture has even broader implications in
portraying Hollywood as a dream factory which produces utter
fantasies (such as the belief in living muses) that allow us to
leave behind our real lives for a couple of hours each week. 
If some of the jokes fall flat, chalk those sections of the movie
up to the periods that writer-director Albert Brooks's mentor
was out to lunch.  Fortunately, there's enough good fun in
this yarn to make us believe that the highly talented Brooks
has spent most of his creative time in the presence of his
muse.</P>
