<P>   "There's something about Mary," croons comic troubadour Jonathan
   Richmond by way of explanation at one point in the remarkably silly
   film of the same name, which prompts one to take inventory: as
   portrayed by Cameron Diaz, perpetual object of desire Mary Jenson is
   gorgeous, kindly, wealthy, sunny and altogether charming.  She has
   the propensity to change clothes while standing in front of open
   windows, and even watches SportsCenter, which, needless to say,
   induces one to ponder what's *not* to like about her?  Well, okay,
   she's a golf aficionado -- nobody's perfect.</P>
<P>   The ridiculously idealized Mary is the eye of the vortex in THERE'S
   SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, an assemblage of zany bits of scatological
   humour themed around -- err, stalking.  Unlike the sugar-coated
   nastiness of last year's ADDICTED TO LOVE, though, this year's
   summer stalking comedy (a most improbable genre, one would have
   thought) has a bright, bubbly core; amidst all the crude sight gags,
   the decidedly-politically incorrect witticisms, and lowbrow
   raunchiness, the film has such an infectiously cheerful, carefree
   spirit that its offensive material comes across as mischievous rather
   than malicious.  Indeed, the sibling filmmaking team of Peter and
   Bobby Farrelly clearly take such glee in stretching the limits of
   good taste that it's nigh well irresistible to simply toss decorum
   aside and revel in the bawdiness.</P>
<P>   The film's (semblance of a) plot is a basic underdog tale structured
   around a lovelorn geeky guy named Ted Stroehmann (Ben Stiller) and
   his earnest attempts to woo the seriously-out-of-his-league goddess
   Mary while competing for her affections against a bizarro,
   ever-expanding collection of misfits, chief of which is the caddish
   Pat Healy (Matt Dillon), the private eye whom Ted hired to track Mary
   down.  In its outline, then, it's a tried-and-true, well-worn formula
   which leaves no doubt where the film is headed, though familiarity
   isn't much of an impediment given that the narrative essentially
   serves as a framework for a series of gags.</P>
<P>   There's little doubt where the film's greatest strengths lie; there
   are moments in THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY which are as funny as
   anything that's been released to theatres this year.  And, as per the
   reputation of filmmakers, the humour isn't exactly sly and subtle --
   the comedy is brazen and in many cases quite literally in-your-face,
   all gross sight gags and frenetic slapstick.  In its best moments,
   the silliness is so abundant that one can't help but choke with
   laughter; there's one scene where the audience is lulled into
   complacency by madcap discussion of a certain uncomfortable
   circumstance that when the brothers Farrelly fling the image onscreen
   (in a zoom shot, no less), filling the frame in all its
   wince-inducing glory, it's hilarious not only in its absurdity and
   grotesqueness, but also for its sheer unexpectedness.</P>
<P>   "I can't believe they *showed* that!" murmured someone behind me
   during one of the film's big comic moments.  "That's *so mean*!"
   gasped the woman next to me.  (The guy in front of me was too busy
   howling with laughter to comment.)  The film's humour is so broad and
   unabashedly confident that it often provokes not only laughter, but
   bonafide audience reaction; at the screening I attended, one prime
   sequence left the crowd buzzing so loud and long that the dialogue in
   the entire subsequent scene couldn't even be heard.</P>
<P>   However, this didn't prove to be a problem, and here lies the down
   side of the film.  THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY is deliriously
   scatological, tossing practically every sick joke in the book at the
   screen in its attempts to elicit laughs, with a rather iffy success
   rate; its big moments are explosively funny, but more often than not,
   the gags sputter and fizzle, and in between comic crescendos the
   whole thing gets rather dreary.  As a result, the film seems to run
   far too long -- some liberal trimming could have be conducted with
   negligent effect to the narrative while improving the overall pacing.
   In addition, the film curiously seems to consider its romantic angle
   far more sweet than it actually plays, frequently lending a sense of
   sincerity to scenes that isn't really merited.</P>
<P>   Still, while wildly uneven, the film is a hoot, replete with a
   handful of memorably audacious moments.  It left me considering which
   was preferable -- a carefully-modulated picture of consistent
   amusement, or an agreeable one peppered with instances of hilarity,
   like THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY.  While in general I find myself
   leaning towards the former, I can't help but appreciate a film which
   takes the tired Good Times montage endemic to the romantic-comedy
   genre, and gives it a special hook.</P>

"...a first screenplay unaccompanied by a powerful agent or industry
 sponsor is generally a pathetic fetus of a film, nothing more."
