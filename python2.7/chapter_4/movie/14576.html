<PRE>Ronin
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1998 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*** (Out of ****)</PRE>
<P>The people who completely devote themselves to a leader or a cause live with a
double-edged sword. In one sense their life is easy. They are positive about
what is right and justified in doing anything and everything to achieve their
goal. On the other hand, if that to which they are dedicated disappears, they
are lost, without purpose.</P>
<P>In ancient Japan these rogues were called Ronin. Nowadays they are called
former CIA and KGB agents.</P>
<P>When a Japanese feudal lord was killed, his samurai were masterless and often
roamed the countryside selling their skills to the highest bidders. In
<I>Ronin<I>, after the fall of the Soviet Union, the modern homeless samurai
become criminals-for-hire.</P>
<P>Ex-CIA operative Sam (Robert De Niro) is recruited by comely Irish lass
Deirdre (Natascha McElhone) to help engineer a high jacking. No one knows much
about the job. For Seamus (Jonathan Pryce), an unseen employer with an unknown
motive, he's supposed to steal a metallic box with a mystery content from an
unknowable number of men who are somewhere. Sam doesn't care about the
details: he's in it for the bucks.</P>
<P>In Paris, he's joined by ex-KGB computer expert Gregor (Stellan Skarsgard),
weapons specialist Spence (Sean Bean), driver Larry (Skipp Sudduth) and their
local French connection Vincent (Jean Reno). Slowly they find out more about
their mission but never more than they need to know and often not even that much.</P>
<P>The heist becomes more complex than they expected when they have to race an
unidentified group of Russians to the prize while entangled in betrayal,
double and triple-crosses. The audience rarely knows anything more about what
is going on than do the participants. Like the owls in "Twin Peaks", no one is
what they seem.</P>
<P>In the early sixties, director John Frankenheimer gave us two masterpieces of
political suspense, "The Manchurian Candidate" and "Seven Days In May". This
film doesn't live up to its ancestors, but there are aspects that make a
strong stab at it.</P>
<P>"Ronin" has an odd feel throughout. The colors are severely muted, as if it
were shot entirely at twilight on an extremely hazy day. This lends itself to
an indistinct visual aspect that mirrors the hazy plot. It also makes it look
like a washed-out film from decades ago.</P>
<P>As is to be expected in action films, there are plenty of car chases, but they
are the strangest that I can remember. Even though there are explosions and
wrecks galore as a shoot-out takes place racing against traffic on an
expressway, they are remarkably unspectacular. </P>
<P>Huge trucks overturn and explode, but they're only onscreen for a second. Cars
flip over and over but are only seen out of the corner of your eye. This is
contrary to the current style of focusing on the disasters, seeing them over
and over from different points of view. Although this imparts a participatory
feeling to the action -- after all, if you're in a speeding car you're not
going to spend a lot of time looking in the rear view mirror -- there's a lack
of spectacle which leaves the audience wanting something with a little more oomph.</P>
<P>There's a coldness to the characters that doesn't allow us to get to know any
of them very well. This makes some sense as people in their particular
profession can't afford to let too much out or get very involved. But this
prevents the audience from caring much about them. The one time where the
detachment does work well is when Sam kisses Deirdre to fool passing police.
The ice princess' passionate response has more impact because it is the only
time during the movie that she lets loose with any emotion.</P>
<P>Sam's friendship with Vincent is one of the few human relationships in the
film. Although they know little about each other, they bond out of necessity,
trusting each other with their lives. In the world of the Ronin, you take it
where you can get it but you also know that the next time you meet up, you
might be on opposite sides.</P>
<P>The success of the film lies mostly in the strength of the actors. De Niro is
always a master on screen. His weary but dedicated Sam is exactly what he
should be. Although he's made some questionable choices in his career
("Mission Impossible", "Godzilla"), Reno has a face and presence made for
movies. He's the tough guy that you want to like. The rest of the players are
equally up to the task although you'll find yourself desiring a bit more warmth.</P>
<P>The script, by an uncredited David Mamet, is nothing exceptional but his short
repetitive style fits well in the mouths of the men without a past or future.
The Nice streets and French countryside offer plenty to look at and provide a
picturesque backdrop to the story.</P>
<P>Although it only runs two hours, the film seems long. The car chases are
excessive and become tiresome after a while. Some of them could have been left
on the cutting room floor to leave room for character development.</P>
<P>The end of the cold war resulted in a calmer world, but after seeing "Ronin",
you are left to wonder how many of these loose cannons are running around out
there. I suppose they'll find new masters in time. Let's hope that they end up
working for the good guys…whoever the good guys are.</P>
