<P>This movie garnered Oscar nominations for both stars Jon Voight (Best
Actor) and Eric Roberts (Best Supporting Actor) at the 1986 Acadamy
Award celebrations. Director Konchalovsky creates an intense thriller
that takes two escaped convicts, slaps them on an unmanned train
barreling down some tracks at lightning speeds, and surrounds them with
the wonderful white world of winter.    </P>
<P>PLOT:
Con of steel Manny (Voight) gets let out of the "hole" after three
years of solitude in a maximum-security Alaskan prison. Soon enough, he
escapes the terror of the jail and its psychotic warden, alongside a
prize-fighting, dimwitted prisoner named Buck (Roberts), and hops onto
the nearest train. Unfortunately for either escapee, the train suddenly
loses its engineer, picks up excessive speeds, and hurdles down the
wintery tracks without brakes or a final destination.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Gritty, suspenseful, stylish, overlong thriller that combines chompin'
good dialogue with solid acting performances by its main leads. Despite
the fact that I found both performances by Voight and Roberts a little
"overdone" at first, I eventually saddled into their tough guy
characters, and forgot to pay attention to the actors themselves
(always indicative of great performances). The story lends itself to
deep interpretations, none of which I will expand upon in this review,
but needless to say that the gist of the plot bleeds around freedom,
and the harsh price that many people are willing to pay for it.</P>
<P>The directing of this picture was highly stylized and wonderfully
achieved, while its cinematography was as sweet as the winter
wonderland that it chillingly portrayed. The dialogue was fresh (see
Little Known Facts below for possible reasons behind its authenticity),
and the acting was strong by both main men. On the down side, I do
think that the picture could have been cut by about fifteen to twenty
minutes, with some of the later scenes dragging on a little, and the
soundtrack was a little too synthesized for my predilection, but hey,
it was the eighties...what do you expect?! </P>
<P>The final scene of the movie is also a classic shot that should stick
in your mind for years to come, with the accompanying music (Very
TITANIC-like (7/10), if you ask me. Hmmm...I wonder if James Horner
ever watched this cool flick?) icing the somber cake over which it
played. This film is definitely nacho material, and lends itself
greatly to newer condiments such as sour cream and/or ketchup (for
tomato fans). Overall, I would say that this movie is a little
overlong, authentically acted, wonderfully shot, and quite suspenseful.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Co-writer of this script, Edward Bunker is also known as Eddie Bunker,
who is also known as the actor who played Mr. Blue in RESERVOIR DOGS
(9/10). Eddie Bunker is a convicted bank robber, who was the youngest
convict ever to be sent to the San Quentin penitentiary at the time of
this conviction. At one time, he was on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List.
He also makes an appearance in this film as Jonah. The script was based
on a story written by famed director Akira Kurosawa.
Eddie Bunker also acted in director Andrei Konchalovsky's 1989's film
TANGO & CASH.
Eric Roberts' famous sister is the PRETTY WOMAN (7.5/10) herself Julia
Roberts. In February, 1995, Eric was arrested and charged with spousal
abuse.
Jon Voight is the father of actress Angelina Jolie, who in 1995 married
"Sick Boy" from TRAINSPOTTING (8.5/10) Johnny Lee Miller in a black
rubber dress (she wore the dress, not him :))</P>
