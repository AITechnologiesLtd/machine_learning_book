                       A film review by Michael Redman
                        Copyright 1997 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Eddie Murphy=92s latest comedy action film owes much of its commercial
appeal to his previous "48 Hours". Unfortunately director Thomas Carter
and writer Randy Feldman seem to have forgotten that the earlier movie
not only had a plot, but had at least a few scenes that were not
time-worn cliches.</P>
<P>Murphy is police hostage negotiator Roper who forms an arch-enemy
relationship with a sadistic psycho played by Michael Wincott. Although
the two turn in more than adequate performances, as does girlfriend
Carmen Ejogo and partner Michael Rapaport, the story goes where _every_
cop buddy movie has gone before.</P>
<P>The story was so predictable that I found myself in a time warp,
watching the film ten minutes beyond what was on the screen. When
Roper=92s older police mentor goes into an apartment building to "just
talk" to a suspect and tells Murphy to wait in the car because it=92s no
big deal, you know what=92s about to happen. After the inevitable, Murphy=</P>
<P>wants to track down the killer and is ordered off the case by his boss.
What do you think he does?</P>
<P>Early in the film, streetwise tough guy Roper is assigned a white
partner with no experience but lots of book learning. Ever seen this
before? Wincott escapes from jail eager for vengeance and Roper and
girlfriend are about to leave for a vacation when she goes back to her
apartment alone. You can guess the next plot development.</P>
<PRE>And it goes on and on. =</PRE>
<P>There are so many plot lines that are not followed up that I suspect
there are five films on the cutting room floor where these scenes made
sense. The cop pals spend an afternoon at a race track for some reason.
Ejogo=92s boyfriend makes a brief appearance and then vanishes.</P>
<P>Murphy=92s performance makes the movie watchable. Miraculously he is able=</P>
<P>to wring some freshness out of most tired scenes by his over-the-top
persona. Looking leaner and meaner than in past films, he does a
commendable job in the dramatic role. Rapaport turns in a decent job,
but his character is underused and goes nowhere.</P>
<P>Like all good cop films, there are car chases and explosions aplenty.
After the popular chase sequences in "Bullet", every action movie filmed
in San Francisco has an obligatory high-speed-flying-through-the-air
spectacle through the city of hills. Here we are treated to that sight
so many times that it bores rather than thrills.</P>
<P>There is an out of control cable car chase that is more interesting and
features a unique method of applying the brakes to the picturesque means
of transportation. The scene would have been even more exciting if it
had an hour or two trimmed from it.</P>
