<PRE>                                    PERSUASION
                A film review by Anthony E. Wright and Jessica Wilcox
                        Copyright 1995 Anthony E. Wright</PRE>
<P>     Jane Austen is getting a Hollywood make-over.  She might have been
the ghostwriter for the summer hit CLUELESS, so closely did it follow
her book "Emma" scene-by-scene: it just transported the story into
present-day teen Valley culture.  Later this year, Merchant-Ivory
veteran Emma Thompson will add her star (and Oscar) power to a film
version of SENSE AND SENSIBILITY.</P>
<P>      Some Hollywood agent is probably calling on Steven Spielberg to
direct MANSFIELD PARK, starring Jeff Goldblum, Laura Dern, and
computer-animated aristocrats.  With all this movie-making, the BBC
arthouse productions of Austen's work might get lost in the shuffle.
That would be a mistake for both Austen fans and neophytes.</P>
<P>     PERSUASION is opening nationally after its one-theater run in
Manhattan, with its adaptation of what some Austen fans believe is her
best novel, bursting with romantic tensions and incisive social
commentary.  There's little Hollywood glitz here: The scenery is
pleasing and real.  The language is understandable but retains its
clever wit.  And while attractive, the characters much more plain than
the perfect creations that movies usually attempt to claim as real
people.  Little makeup is used: No one would mistake this for one of
those dressed-up Merchant-Ivory galas.  Narratively, we see how truly
dreary being English aristocrat can be.  The houses are silent except
for the creaking floor boards.  Rooms are lit with only sunlight or
candles.  The directing capitalizes on these aspects for good effect:
The camera actually rocks with the movement of a ship, or the bustle of
a horse-drawn carriage.  We get the full ride, with the bumps
included.</P>
<P>     Those familiar with PERSUASION be forewarned: while this film
attempts to capture the spirit of the book, many details were deemed
expendable.  The basic story remains intact, but scenes are switched
around, dropped, and even tweaked.  The movie changes some of the
action to make plot points stronger.  It even draws from early drafts
of the book--so some Austen lovers might be needlessly concerned about
the eventual outcome.  Yet even the most rabid Austen fanatics will be
pleased by the movie.  Those who don't remember reading "Pride and
Prejudice" and the like in high school might need a little coaching and
careful viewing in the first half to get all the characters and
relationships straight, but the experience is still worth it.</P>
<P>     The story focuses on Anne, the white sheep of a ludicrous
aristocratic family, when she meets up with Captain Wentworth, a sailor
whose hand she was persuaded to spurn, by her friends and family
concerned by his lack of money.  Although now he has come back from the
wars a rich man, and she has become more independent to boot.  But
getting the two together still requires a lot of maneuvering.  Anne is
the protagonist that we like: A literate, unpretentious lady that even
deigns to visit with friends below her on the class scale, which
predictably rewards her with valuable gossip later in the story.</P>
<P>     The acting between these two main characters gets at some of the
romantic tensions that light up the book....  The (perhaps too) frequent
close-up of Ann's wide eyes are remarkable, because with only a twitch
they convey her longing and amazement at her predicament.  Most
everyone else does well portraying the silly characters that Austen
created.  In fact, the moviemakers were generous: director Austen might
have made the characters more ridiculous.</P>
<P>     But besides the story of romance, the social satire is biting.  To
our amusement, we see the stultifying boredom and pointlessness when
the family give a courtesy call to a well-connected relative.  Anne
talks with a friend about the difference between "good company"--an
obsession among the aristocrats--and the "best company," for which Anne
has a fairly different criteria.  When an associate makes a point by
referring to the women characters in novels, Anne pointedly reminds him
that the novels are written by men.  Even just the cruelty of it all is
portrayed:  when discussing the family finances, her absurd, vain
father exclaims, "Ask Anne? Whatever for?"</P>
<P>     Perhaps the only problem is that social satire of another century
is similar to a day-old wedding cake: it still looks beautiful, and one
can appreciate the craftsmanship, but to some it loses a delicate touch
that makes it so tasty.  Yet when leaving the Paris Theater in downtown
Manhattan, one is immediately greeted with the horse-drawn carriages
running along the base of Central Park; the historic Plaza Hotel,
perhaps the most expensive lodgings this side of England; FAO Schwartz,
the literal playground of the rich; and around the corner, Trump Tower,
the most visible symbol that if Jane Austen were a screenwriter today,
she would have a lot of material to work with.  Despite Hollywood, we
may need her now more than ever.</P>
