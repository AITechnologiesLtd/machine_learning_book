Rated R.</P>
<P>Actors love this stuff. They love to dress up as army guys, stand really
straight, and salute a lot. I mean, it made the careers of such actors as
Louis Gossett Jr. and George C. Scott, while somehow making Demi Moore look
like a respectable actress. This time, John Travolta tries it in "The
General's Daughter," a movie that desperately wants to be a Tom Clancy
adaptation, but falls just short of stuff like "A Clear and Present Danger"
and "Patriot Games." Travolta? Well, he's no Harrison Ford, but he's pretty
good. Too bad the story isn't given the same effort as Travolta gives to his
performance. Otherwise, we'd have a nice little political thriller here.</P>
<P>Travolta plays Sgt. Paul Brenner, an investigator for the military currently
working on an undercover mission to bust a weapons shipment to the leader of
a militia. While on the mission, he meets Elisabeth Campbell (Leslie
Stefanson), a pretty young officer working in the army's psychology
department. After Brenner finishes his original mission, he is called out on
another job, which has Elisabeth dead, bound, and naked in an army training
ground, the apparent victim of rape and strangulation. Brought in to help
Brenner with the investigation is Sarah Sunhill (Madeline Stowe), a rape
expert with whom Brenner has had a romantic past. Further complicating
matters is the fact that Elisabeth is the daughter of respected General
Joseph Campbell (James Cromwell), under whom Brenner served in Vietnam and
who wants the matter kept entirely within the military. Brenner and Sunhill
discover that there is more to the murder than simple rape, as they find
that Elisabeth was involved in sadomasochistic sexual activity, and has more
than her share of skeletons in the closet.</P>
<P>The strongest part of "The General's Daughter" is that all the actors give
enthusiastic performances. Travolta does his best to emulate Harrison Ford,
playing the man with unshakable moral character who must fight for what's
right while everyone else tells him to keep his nose out of it. While he's
not nearly as compelling as Ford was in "A Clear and Present Danger," he
still does a respectable job of carrying the film. He hits the right note in
most scenes and delivers one-liners with fine comic timing. His scenes with
James Woods, playing Elisabeth's teacher who obviously knows more than he's
letting on, are among the best in the movie. Woods' character is a
psychological expert, and Travolta matches him line for line as the two go
through a nicely-written little psychological battle. James Cromwell now
seems to be making a living of playing seedy high-ranking officers with
plenty to hide. After his role in "L.A. Confidential," he's up to his
villainous old tricks here. We're not sure if he's the killer, but there is
little doubt that he had something to do with it. Madeline Stowe, being the
woman, is (not surprisingly) underwritten. These movies just aren't made for
female actors. She has little more to do than follow Travolta around and
make vague allusions to some romantic rendezvous they had years ago. Won't
the writers please give her more to do?</P>
<P>Veteran screenwriter William Goldman was brought in on this project to spice
up the dialogue, and it shows. There are plenty of clever one-liners and
scene-closing zingers in "The General's Daughter." While Goldman may have
gone a bit overboard by ending practically every scene with a snappy joke,
his dialogue is quite good in most scenes. Now, one would think that snappy
dialogue and above-average performances would make for a great movie, but
they don't, because the story is not nearly up to par. What's wrong with it?
First off, the whole thing is pretty routine and, at times, downright silly.
Bad guys are bad guys and good guys are good guys. While we are at no time
certain who the killer is, there is no doubt who was involved. The film runs
into a problem near the end when, after throwing us red herring after red
herring about the identity of the killer, it suddenly has to decide on
someone, and the decision left me somewhat nonplused. The choice seemed
rather arbitrary and was not explained terribly well, a surprise after the
movie has held our hand most of the way through, explaining in great detail
exactly what is going on, and leaving nothing to the imagination. The film
also gets into trouble because of that very dedication to detail. We see the
events of Elisabeth's rape in harsh and unnecessary flashbacks, while her
naked corpse is left out in the open for an awfully long time. I thought it
was standard procedure to cover up the body at a murder scene. In "The
General's Daughter," it is apparently not. Not only that, but most of the
major revelations come in a sort of "Whoops, I found a clue" fashion.
Brenner is constantly noticing things out of the corner of his eye, and
after a while it becomes annoying.</P>
<P>Director Simon West keeps the film moving quickly, if nothing else, but his
direction is far too obvious when it comes to setting the tone for a scene.
There are "meaningful looks" galore in "The General's Daughter." Travolta
walks into a bar and it seems that everyone, even the extras, is glaring at
him. West's attempts to set "mood lighting" only give the impression that
someone forgot to pay the lighting bill. Nobody ever has a well-lit
basement, apartment, or office in a movie like this, and for some reason the
investigators decide to drop in on the crime scene in the dead of night. The
director, along with the screenwriters, also allows random subplots to
disappear at whim. A bit about a meddling local sheriff ends up being used
only as comic relief. The story of Brenner and Sunhill's relationship goes
nowhere, and it becomes clear that it was only mentioned to set up romantic
"tension" between the two, not to develop their characters.</P>
<P>"The General's Daughter" is obviously not trying to win any points for
originality, but at least it could have tried to tell us something new.
Instead, we get mixed messages about women in the military and corruption of
high-ranking officers, nothing that we didn't already see done much better
in "G.I. Jane," or any number of Tom Clancy adaptations. It's too bad that
the story doesn't provide better punch, because this film has a few things
going for it: (1) It's mercifully short (after sitting through oppressively
long films of this genre, a two-hour running time is a blessing), (2) it
boasts an A-list cast, and (3) it has plenty of good dialogue. With those
things going for it, "The General's Daughter" stood a good chance of being
an intriguing military drama. With such a formulaic and obvious plot,
however, it stands as a mediocre entry into the realm of political
thrillers.</P>
