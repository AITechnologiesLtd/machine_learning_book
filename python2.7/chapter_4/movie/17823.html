<PRE>GOODBYE, LOVER
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>*1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        "Goodbye, Lover" sat on the shelf for almost a year since its
lukewarm reception at the Cannes Film Festival last May, and one look will
tell you why.  It's a mess.  And that's *way* before Ellen DeGeneres shows
up.</P>
<P>        The film is one of those torrid double-indemnity crime stories
that, in this case, required the services of three screenwriters.  I
suspect that one wrote a sexy thriller, one wrote a murder mystery, and one
wrote a comedy, then director Roland Joffé tried to piece it all together
in the editing room while scratching his head in bewilderment.</P>
<P>        I didn't laugh at Ellen DeGeneres much (I think I was supposed to).
DeGeneres is horrible and her character is even worse, a tough-talking
vulgar cop with a bad wardrobe and bad hair.  Either DeGeneres is wearing a
wig--as most of the actors appear to be--or she doesn't yet have enough
clout to secure a hairstylist.  Every single word out of her mouth is
supposed to be racy and hip, but her incessant wisecracking is
poorly-written and merely stupid.  Her reaction to the brutal killing of a
jogger is "at least she died healthy."  And that's one of her wittier
asides.</P>
<P>        DeGeneres' Sgt. Rita Pompano is called in to investigate the
allegedly accidental death of...wait.  To give away too much of the plot
would all but ruin a film that has very little going for it outside of its
numbing plot twists and multiple triple-crosses.  It's best described this
way:</P>
<P>        Sultry sexpot/real estate agent Sandra Dunmore (Patricia Arquette)
is married to Jake, a "creative yet unfocused" (and alcoholic) advertising
rep, played by Dermot Mulroney.  Sandra likes to act out her deep-seated
sexual fantasies and Jake's brother Ben (the suave-as-ever Don Johnson)
likes to help.  Ben is also coming on to his petite, mousy co-worker Peggy
Blaine (Mary-Louise Parker) and someone, somewhere, is planning to cash in
on that huge life insurance policy of his.</P>
<P>        The film is ripe with cheating lovers cheating on each other and
back again.  Although there are some genuine surprises, the plot twists get
too contrived too quickly.  Probably around the time DeGeneres' gumcracking
gumshoe appears.</P>
<P>        At least the former "Ellen" star is going for something a little
different.  Arquette turns in Yet Another of her stiletto-heeled, platinum
blonde bombshell roles (see: "Lost Highway," "True Romance") while quoting
embarrassing lines like "I'm not wearing any underwear."  I hope she got
paid a lot of money to do this.</P>
<P>        Here's an example of some of the film's flat-out stupidity.  Sandra
purchases a used car and disguises herself in a red wig prior to stalking
two of the film's duplicitous lovers.  She drives the motorbiking couple
off a cliff while blaring her favorite "The Sound of Music" on her car
stereo, intent on identifying herself to her hapless victims.  So what was
the point of the wig and the car?</P>
<P>        "The Sound of Music" stuff might be a reference to "The Wizard of
Oz" allusions in David Lynch's "Wild at Heart," but if so Joffé must have
forgotten that "Wild at Heart" was a despicable movie.  It's hard to
believe that "Goodbye, Lover" was directed by the same person who made "The
Killing Fields" and "The Mission."  It's not, however, hard to see why it
sat on the shelf for so long.  It should have stayed there.</P>
