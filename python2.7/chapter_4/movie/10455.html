<P>Beavis and Butt-head Do America (1996)</P>
<PRE>Grade: 69</PRE>
<P>If you had never seen MTV and ran across this title, you
would think that it was among the worst ever, possibly
even a porn movie.  Mike Judge has reached mainstream
acceptance with his FOX show "King of the Hill", but
his earlier characters Beavis and Butt-head are not for 
everyone.  If you have seen and enjoyed the MTV shorts, 
however, the film "Beavis and Butt-head Do America" will
not disappoint.</P>
<P>Beavis and Butt-head are about fifteen years old.  They
are stupid, naive and depraved, and have spent most of their
lives watching television.  From a societal point of view, 
they have no redeeming qualities.  This doesn't prevent them
from being hilarious, as their very weaknesses reflect
the base feelings and actions that everybody has.</P>
<P>Our animated anti-heroes wake up to find that their beloved
television set has been stolen.  A search to find a working 
TV set gets them (as always) into increasing trouble, which
they remain oblivious to.  Somehow Beavis and Butt-head
are taken for professional killers, get a biological weapon
implanted on their clothes, and are sent on a cross-country
mission to "score" with a femme fatale arms trader.
Meanwhile, fanatical government agents are on their trail.</P>
<P>Mike Judge directed and wrote the script.  His gifted 
vocal chords voice the major characters.  He pulls no
punches when it come to satire.  Beavis and Butt-head,
who assumedly represent young america, are hopelessly
stupid, shallow and clueless.  Stereotypes of the liberal
middle school teacher and the relentless federal agent
(who has a thing about deep cavity searches) are lampooned.
The opening credits slam Godzilla movies, and 1970s
TV detective shows.</P>
<P>The animation is merely perfunctory, even ugly.  This does
not detract much, as it suits the mood of the film.
The story isn't always credible, such as the sudden
change of status for Beavis and Butt-head from America's
Most Wanted to hero.  The dumb-dumbs also survive a
definitely fatal jump from a moving vehicle, and are
not arrested after re-joining their tour bus.</P>
<P>Bruce Willis and Demi Moore provide the voices of the
arms trading couple.  David Letterman, who is a big
fan of Beavis and Butt-head, also has a voice
characterization.</P>
