<PRE>                               ZENTROPA
                  A film review by Thomas E. Billings
                   Copyright 1992 Thomas E. Billings</PRE>
<P>Synopsis:
A few months after the end of World War II, an idealistic young American
returns to his native Germany.  There he takes a job as a sleeping car
conductor on the reconstructed Zentropa railway line.  He gets involved
with a beautiful woman, pro-Nazi terrorists, and U.S. occupation
forces.  A stylish fantasy that is interesting, but of only average
quality.</P>
<PRE>Denmark, 1991, 113 minutes.
Director/Writer: Lars Von Trier</PRE>
<P>     The story centers on Leopold Kessler, an idealistic young American
of German origin, who returns to Germany right after the end of World
War II (late 1945); his return is something of a goodwill gesture.
Thanks to the influence of his uncle, he gets a job as a sleeping car
conductor on the recently reconstructed railway line, owned by the
Zentropa Corporation.  In the course of his job, he eventually gets
involved with a beautiful woman, the head of the Zentropa Corporation,
pro-Nazi terrorists (referred to as "werewolves" in the film), and U.S.
occupation force authorities.</P>
<P>     The above plot description is deliberately vague, to avoid
spoilers, and because the plot develops rather slowly in the first half
of the film.  The film is very stylish -- in fact, the stylishness gets
in the way at times.  Most of the film is in black-and-white, with a few
scenes in color and some scenes that are a mixture of color and
black-and-white.  Part of the dialog is in English, part is in German
(with subtitles in the German portions).</P>
<P>     The film is presented as a sort of dream, with a narrator voicing
over scenes to describe the character's emotions or thoughts at times.
Back-projection is used (not very well, I might add) to superimpose
scenes, particularly when the narrator calls for a scene change.
Although the narrator does provide important information at times, I
felt that the film might have been better if there was no narration.
The film develops slowly in the first half, however the pace gets
frantic in the last half.  There is some humor in the film, but not very
much.</P>
<P>     To summarize, I would describe the film as a stylish fantasy, that
is of only mediocre quality.  A newspaper review (San Francisco
Chronicle, 4/24/92) described the film as "think of BLADE RUNNER crossed
with BRAZIL".  The preceding quote is so marketable that I wouldn't be
surprised if the U.S. distributor (Miramax Films) uses it in their
advertising when the film is released later this year.  After seeing the
film, I would counter the quote by saying that it is technically correct
in some ways.  However, if you go to this film expecting a film of the
quality of BRAZIL or BLADE RUNNER, I suspect that you will be very
disappointed!</P>
<P>     The comparison to BLADE RUNNER comes from the post-apocalyptic
state of Germany after World War II, which is comparable to the vision
of Los Angeles presented in BLADE RUNNER.  Comparisons to BRAZIL can be
made because of the authoritarian bureaucracy present everywhere, and
perhaps to the atmosphere of the film (the latter point being
subjective).  Instead of these comparisons, I would offer a different
comparison.  Because the film is mostly in black-and-white, and presents
post-war Germany as a world of its own, comparisons to the work of
Canada's Guy Maddin are reasonable.  Maddin's films are in
black-and-white, and present worlds that are quite different from our
own; his films include TALES FROM THE GIMLI HOSPITAL and ARCHANGEL.  So
I would say that ZENTROPA is what you might get if Guy Maddin did a
conventional film.</P>
<P>     There is one other piece of information that I want to pass on.
This film is/was released in Europe under the name EUROPA.  Do not
confuse ZENTROPA with a recent German film released in the U.S. under
the name EUROPA, EUROPA -- they are two different films!</P>
<P>U.S. Distribution: currently on the film festival circuit. The U.S.
distributor is Miramax Films, and general theatrical release is
planned for sometime later this year.</P>
