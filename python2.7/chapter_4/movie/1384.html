<P>Review in short:  An excellent movie from the same creative team that
brought us A ROOM WITH A VIEW.  Highly recommended, +3.5 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>     HOWARD'S END is another film from the same team (Dir: Ivory,
Producer: Ismail Merchant, Screenplay: Ruth Prawer Jhabvala) that brough
us another E. M. Forster book, A ROOM WITH A VIEW.  This film reminds
one very much of A ROOM WITH A VIEW--it has the same feeling to it.</P>
<P>     The direction manages to set a pace that is slow without ever
seeming to bog.  The actors are allowed to unfold the story like a
wonderful origami swan.  Vanessa Redgrave is not in the film very
long, but her presence as Ruth Wilcox is felt throughout the movie.</P>
<P>     This is a better film than A ROOM WITH A VIEW.  The story is
handled better, and there is none of the confusion that seemed to mark A
ROOM WITH A VIEW.  Helena Bonham Carter, who played Lucy in A ROOM WITH
A VIEW seems to have a gift for playing a headstrong late-Victorian
era young lady.  She is more mature in this role, and more head-strong
as well, though she is not the center of the story this time.</P>
<P>     Who is the center of the story is a question that could spark some
argument.  My opinion it must be Ruth Wilcox (Redgrave).  Either her or
Howard's End itself (a charming country estate).</P>
<P>     The plot of the movie revolves around the interconnected lives of
two sisters, Margaret and Helen Schlegel (Thompson and Carter) and a
English family, the Wilcoxes, primarily Ruth Wilcox and Henry Wilcox
(Redgrave and Hopkins), and a young man named Leonard Bast (Sam West).
The plot is involved and interesting, but this is not a plot-driven
movie.</P>
<P>     We see a remarkable performance from Anthony Hopkins as a rich
upper-class Englishman of rather questionable morals.  He is not an evil
man, but he is a hypocrite.</P>
<P>     I must take the time to comment on the film itself, I saw it in 70
mm (from a 35mm print I believe) and was very impressed with the quality
of the image.  The colors are soft and moist looking, and there is a
gauze-like feeling to the outdoor shots.  It is much like A ROOM WITH A
VIEW in this regard.</P>
