<PRE>BROKEN ARROW (1996)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: John Woo
Writer: Graham Yost
Starring: John Travolta, Christian Slater, Samantha Mathis, Delroy
Lindo, Frank Whaley, Bob Gunton, Howie Long, Kurtwood Smith, French
Stewart</P>
<P>If you know me, you know that I think of John Woo as a God.  His action
films are probably the best in the world - filled with stylistic,
balletic, and visceral bloodbaths; plots motivated by characters; and a
strong, multi-leveled opposition between characters.  Indeed, his
"Face/Off" was probably the best film of the summer, and one of the most
entertaining of the year.  But every great director has their little
slip-ups.  Danny Boyle, Quentin Tarantino, Kevin Smith, Robert Altman,
Woody Allen...everyone.</P>
<P>"Broken Arrow" isn't BAD, really, but it's not very good either.  It's
horrible compared to Woo's other films (you'd hardly believe the guy who
directed this directed "The Killer," or even "Face/Off").  But I try not
to review from that particular stand-point (example: "The Frighteners"
sucked compared to Peter Jackson's other films, but was still a good
film overall and received a 3-star review from me), so basically all
this film needed to do was be fun.  Well, it really wasn't.</P>
<P>But anyway, this is the little premise: two pilots (Travolta and Slater)
are ordered to fly some nuclear weapons on a new jet thingy, but
Travolta goes nuts, sends Slater out on a parachute, and steals the
weapons as a tool of ransom.  Slater teams with annoying-park ranger
chick (Samantha Mathis, teaming them up after "Pump Up the Volume"), and
they go on to stop Travolta from ripping off the government, and perhaps
setting one or two of those nukes off.</P>
<P>There's a lot of action, yet the film is never really exciting. 
"Prepare to o ballistic" was one of the little promotional mantras this
had when advertised, but when I saw it (even in a surround sound home
theatre system thingy), I wasn't really all that moved.  I mean, this is
the guy who got adrenalized watching Dustin Hoffman beat up a bunch of
cockney thugs in "Straw Dogs," and I was damn near limp with this one. 
I think Woo's other films are damn near orgasmic, but this was pretty
tepid, even with some cool stuff in it (Travolta's exit is pretty cool).</P>
<P>Why weren't these action scenes as adrenalin-pumping-exciting enough for
me?  I'm not really sure.  He has some slow-mo shots of people dying,
but of course they're not as poignant without the gallons of blood
escaping their body (a cliche, but I love it).  And there's some really
cool little action sight-gags in it (a shot with a helicopter wing
almost slicing Mathis into thirds is pretty cool).</P>
<P>But I think the problem lies within the characters.  In earlier John Woo
flicks (and "Face/Off"), he creates strong characters (in that they're
pretty well-developed, although not all the time); people who we care
about.  When Chow Yun-Fat and Danny Lee are in the church fighting off
the huge gang of their opponents, I was excited.  Because I didn't
really care if Slater and Mathis were shot up or something, I was never
really in any tense situation.  When you have a character you care about
in a life-threatening situation, things get tense.  When you actually
would prefer Mathis to be shot by Travolta so she would stop being
annoying, you have a bit of a tension problem.</P>
<P>John Woo also has a great trademark of creating character opposition
between two of the characters.  In "A Better Tomorrow," the fractured
relationship between the two brothers was pretty moving.  In "Face/Off,"
there was also a parallelism between Sean and Castor, setting up a lot
of irony, and made us care about both of them, even if one was a raving
maniac (actually, it actually asks us whether or not we like the villain
or the hero).  Here, Travolta is likeable JUST because he's funny.  But
Slater is only likable because Slater does a good job with the role, and
because the script has ordered us to like him.  The extent of the
opposition between the two seems to be that they box, and Slater keeps
loosing.  I was not thrilled at all by their relationship, and it causes
the film to suffer.</P>
<P>There are some plusses, though.  The two leads (Travolta and Slater)
both do good jobs.  I mean, I usually don't like Slater a lot, but he
was good here.  And Travolta certainly knows how to make a good old
campy villain.  With his cool-ass cigarette smoking, striking visage,
and...well, everything, he just does a great job of making us like him. 
In later scenes, he seems to show some human qualities to his role, even
if they're not even in there, which actually seems to help the
relationship between the two, even if very minimally.  But at least he
tried where the writers would not.</P>
<P>"Broken Arrow" is not a horrible film, but it's very disappointing for a
great filmmaker like John Woo.  If he and the writers had spent more
time on it, they probably would have been able to make an amazing film,
but alas, they failed.  But at least he came back with the jaw-dropping
amazing "Face/Off."</P>
