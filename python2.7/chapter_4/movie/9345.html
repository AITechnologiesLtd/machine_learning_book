<P>With teen scary movies, the most relevant consideration is the Jump 
Factor. Plot, style and character-development are all well and good, but 
audiences go to these kind of films for the same reason they visit 
haunted houses; to have someone spring out of nowhere and shout "Boo!" "I 
Know What You Did Last Summer," the latest offering from "Scream" writer 
Kevin Williamson, delivers the scares on a regular basis, including one 
"Boo!" that rates a full 10 on the Jump Scale. 
Williamson and director Jim Gillespie were determined to make "I Know 
What You Did Last Summer" more than just another slasher film. Working 
from Lois Duncans novel, they create an effective creepy mood, as four 
teens, returning home from a night of partying, hit a man with their car 
on a desolate stretch of road. Faced with possible manslaughter charges, 
they decide to dump the body into the sea and keep the tragedy a secret. 
Guilt from that night destroys their bond, and the kids stay far away 
from each other until a year later, when one of them receives a letter 
stating "I know what you did last summer." 
Set in a Carolina fishing village, "Last Summer" establishes a 
distinctive atmosphere and boasts characters better defined and far 
smarter than most in this genre. Jennifer Love Hewitt ("Party Of Five"), 
Sarah Michelle Gellar (TV's "Buffy The Vampire Slayer"), Freddie Prinze 
Jr. (outstanding in "The House Of Yes"), and Ryan Philippe ("White 
Squall") are effective in the lead roles, but the most memorable 
performance comes from Anne Heche as a loved one of the victim. With an 
odd gait and even odder mannerisms, Heches disturbing character is like 
the sister of that kid with the banjo from "Deliverance." Shes a creepy 
hoot.
After a number of well-stage scenes, particularly the initial accident 
and a riotous teen beauty pageant, "Last Summer" stumbles towards the end,
 falling into far too ordinary genre clichis. Still, the film is a fun 
diversion, and never fails to shout "Boo!" at just the right moment.</P>
<PRE><HR>*********</PRE>
<P>"I Know What You Did Last Summer is a departure from Scream, said 
Kevin Williamson, who wrote the screenplay for both films. "Scream was 
sort of a comedy horror film, set outside of a genre that it poked fun at 
and paid tribute to, all at the same time. This film is the movie 
Scream was parodying, it sits right inside of the genre. In the wake of 
Scream, I wanted to see if a straightforward horror story could be done 
again, if a level of wit and sophistication could be brought to it and if 
we could make a really good scary movie that didnt rely on the gimmick 
of self-aware, self-reflexive pop culture references."
In "I Know What You Did Last Summer", based on Lois Duncans novel, 
tragedy strikes when four young people are driving home from a night of 
drinking on the Carolina coast. While speeding down a winding stretch of 
road, their car slams into a man. Standing over the body of the stranger, 
the youths consider the ramifications of the accident and make a fateful 
decision to dump the body into the sea and keep the nightmare a secret. 
Cut to one year later, when one of the now-scattered group receives a 
letter saying "I know what you did last summer." The situation forces the 
estranged teens to reunite, as they try to discover who is stalking them.</P>
<P>The film stars four hot young actors, Jennifer Love Hewitt ("Party Of 
Five"), Sarah Michelle Gellar (TVs "Buffy The Vampire Slayer"), Freddie 
Prinze Jr. ("The House Of Yes") and Ryan Phillippe ("White Squall"), but 
most of the attention at a recent press gathering in L.A. focused on 
writer Kevin Williamson. His clever script for the smash hit "Scream", 
the first horror film to break the $100 million mark domestically, 
revived the moribund genre. 
"When Scream hit we said Oh brother, everyones going to expect a 
comedy here and this film is serious. Last Summer is a morality tale 
about four kids who make a decision they think will preserve their future 
that actually destroys it. It talks about how deadly secrets are, that 
secrets can kill you. This is not a comedy."
Director Jim Gillespie agreed, adding "Its not a slasher film, really. 
Its a throwback to the Hitchcock type of thriller. I wanted to do things 
in a more subtle fashion, to let the audience use their imagination a 
little bit more. Its also a character study. Thats what draws the 
audience into the film, getting to know the kids. Everything hinges on 
the accident. Its a five minute scene and the acting is critical. If 
that scene didnt work, then nothing else would. Thankfully, I had a 
great script and four extremely talented young actors to work with."
Williamson is proud of the scripts character development, saying "I 
tried to infuse it with savvy, to keep it smart, not to give it the stick 
characters we see walking through the Friday the 13th movies."
Despite the emphasis on character development, both men recognize that 
the scare factor is crucial. Gillespie explained, "Because the film is 
character, rather than plot driven, it requires a certain number of 
scares every few minutes, otherwise you lose the attention of your 
audience. Younger audiences expect you to keep the scares coming fast.
"Its funny, with this kind of film theres always one moment that you 
think is a medium level scare and that turns out to be the biggest scare 
of all. You jump and then you resent it because its complete manipulation.
 But that manipulation is part of the fun."
Williamson is still amazed at the level of "Screams" success. "I sat 
down and said All right Kevin, stop being an artist, youre unemployed 
and starving, be a businessman. I looked around to see what was missing, 
whats wasnt happening in the film market, and decided to take a shot at 
scary movies. I wrote Scream to draw attention to itself. I thought if 
people saw it they might think I had a voice for something else. Then it 
sold. Who could have dreamed all of this would happen."
"Scream 2 opens in December and Im very proud of it. I saw the 
finished film the other day and its scarier than the first one, it rocks.
 I just hope audiences will appreciate what weve done with I Know What 
You Did Last Summer. The approach may be more traditional, but I 
guarantee this film will make you jump!"</P>
