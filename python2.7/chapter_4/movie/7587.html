<P>     Gay movies have come a long way since the release of the seminal 
THE BOYS IN THE BAND more than twenty-five years ago.  With the advent 
of the millennium, film makers have taken a more even-handed approach to 
homosexuality.  Mainstream films such as PHILADELPHIA and JEFFREY have 
attracted big-name actors to play sympathetically-written gay men.  Now, 
with the release of first time film director Joe Mantello's LOVE! 
VALOUR! COMPASSION!, the American movie industry has taken another step 
forward.</P>
<P>     LOVE! VALOUR! COMPASSION! began life in 1994 as an off-Broadway 
stage production.  It drew rave reviews and eventually captured the Tony 
Award for best play.  Now, only three years later, the celluloid 
adaptation has reached screens, and will become the first widely-
available American motion picture to address issues of male intimacy 
openly and honestly, without resorting to hooks like PHILADELPHIA's 
courtroom battle.  During the last two weeks of May and into June, Fine 
Line Features intends to distribute the film in dozens of cities across 
the United States, beginning in New York, San Francisco, and Los 
Angeles, and spreading outwards from there.</P>
<P>     While LOVE! VALOUR! COMPASSION! will obviously appeal to gay 
audiences (considering that all eight characters are homosexual), the 
film has plenty to offer straight viewers as well.  Much of the humor 
and drama presented here is universal -- love is, after all, love, 
regardless of whether it's between a man and a woman, a woman and a 
woman, or a man and a man.  LOVE! VALOUR! COMPASSION! doesn't use 
homosexual shock tactics to enliven the proceedings.  Instead, it 
carefully and realistically examines a series of relationships, both 
sexual and platonic, between men.  </P>
<P>     The eight characters in LOVE! VALOUR! COMPASSION! are not intended 
to represent a cross-section of gay America, and, as a result, there's 
little evidence of stereotyping.  It's rare for homosexuals in 
mainstream motion pictures to be presented as individuals rather than 
icons; LOVE! VALOUR! COMPASSION! defies tradition by proffering its 
characters as real people with believable problems.  </P>
<P>     Over the course of three holiday weekends during one summer, a 
group of eight friends gathers together at a secluded Victorian house 
for swimming, picnicking, volleyball, and talking.  The house is owned 
by an aging dance choreographer, Gregory (Stephen Bogardus), who lives 
with his younger, blind companion, Bobby (Justin Kirk).  Their guests 
include John Jeckyll (John Glover), a surly British composer, and his 
current lover, Ramon (Randy Becker); John's twin, James (also Glover), 
who is as nice as his brother is nasty; Buzz Hauser (Jason Alexander), a 
flamboyant showtune aficionado whose HIV+ status casts a grim shadow 
over his life; and Arthur (John Benjamin Hickey) and Perry (Stephen 
Spinella), a couple who have been together for fourteen years.  As the 
season progresses from Memorial Day to Independence Day to Labor Day, 
relationships begin and end, revelations occur, and betrayals are 
committed.  </P>
<P>     As is often true of stage productions adapted for film, LOVE! 
VALOUR! COMPASSION! turns out to be a talky affair, and, even though the 
dialogue is rich, there are times when the characters seem to be 
speaking just to hear the poetry of their words.  The film also takes a 
while to get going.  This is not an unusual trait for an ensemble piece 
-- until you get to know the characters a little, it's difficult to 
become involved in the story.  After about the first half-hour, however, 
LOVE! VALOUR! COMPASSION! hits its stride, and, from that point on, it 
becomes consistently more engrossing.</P>
<P>     Six of the seven New York actors who were featured in the stage 
version of LOVE! VALOUR! COMPASSION! have re-created their characters 
for the film, including Tony Award-winner John Glover.  The lone no-show 
is Nathan Lane, who played Buzz and has been replaced by Jason 
Alexander.  Alexander's portrayal is curious, since there are many 
instances when he appears to be mimicking Lane rather than just playing 
the character.  It's not an ineffective approach, but it occasionally 
becomes distracting.  </P>
<P>     For the most part, since the actors know their characters so well, 
we are treated to a relaxed set of performances.  There are hiccups, 
such as when Justin Kirk goes over-the-top reacting to a family tragedy, 
but such occasional flaws can attributed to the inherent differences 
between performing for a camera and on stage.  The chemistry developed 
within the group is evident even to the most casual observer.</P>
<P>     As play-to-movie transitions go, LOVE! VALOUR! COMPASSION! is about 
average.  Mantello, who helmed the stage version but has never before 
directed a film, doesn't do anything especially interesting or radical.  
He opens things up a little bit, and occasionally uses the closeup 
effectively, but this is by no means a stunning motion picture debut.  
Nevertheless, the material he's working with is so strong that even a 
mundane approach like this fashions a funny, poignant motion picture 
that's worth seeing regardless of your sexual orientation.</P>
