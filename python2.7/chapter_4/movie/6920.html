<PRE>                           THE ENGLISH PATIENT
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     An international group of archeologists is engaged in making maps
in the previously uncharted desert in Egypt.  The leader is Almasy
(Ralph Fiennes), a Hungarian, and his explorer partner, Peter Madox
(Julian Wadham.)  Also prominent is a  newly married English couple,
the Clintons.  Husband Geoffrey (Colin Firth) is interested in
aviation;  his wife Katharine (Kristin Scott Thomas) is an outspoken
fearless  woman, well educated as well as being a painter.</P>
<P>     Without having planned it, Almasy and Katharine suddenly fall in
love, hopelessly and erotically.  When World War II breaks out, this
international group of friends and co- workers find they are now also
nationalists; more so than friends.  Add to this that Geoffrey
discovers his wife is being unfaithful with Almasy,</P>
<P>     The movie moves back and forth in time.  Hana, a French-Canadian
nurse suddenly loses a close friend when that nurse steps on a land
mine.   Hana is filled with a feeling that  anyone she touches is
getting the kiss of death.  As the convoy of wounded moves along she
decides she will devote her life to a badly burned soldier, to make
what are surely his last days as comfortable as possible.  When the
convoy passes a bombed-out monastery, she has them unload the patient
(henceforth referred to as The English Patient as they do not know his
name) and has him taken to the monastery and settled into a bed she had
just cleaned..</P>
<P>     Here the film ask the viewer to make judgments.  The patient's
only possession is a Greek history book with some personal letters,
photos,  drawings and maps in the book.   Hana reads to him and what
she reads jogs his memory which we see in flashbacks that give the
viewer an idea of who The English Patient is (or may be) and what he
had experienced, including a plane crash that resulted in  burns over
all of his face and body.</P>
<P>    There is more.  There is Kim, (Naveen Andrews) young and handsome,
a Sikh bomb-defusing expert, There is Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe) who has
had his fingers cut off for refusing to give the Germans any
information.    All of these people and their stories are woven into
the film as each plays a role with the others in a tense, dramatic film
that will make you think long after you have left the theater.</P>
