<PRE>                               PULP FICTION
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  What would you get if Robert
     Altman tried to do a super-violent crime film, a cross
     between SHORT CUTS and SCARFACE?  Quentin Tarantino
     tells a weird collection of inter-connected crime
     stories peopled by a weirder collection of thugs than
     Damon Runyan could have imagined on drugs.  This is a
     film with comedy, heavy violence, some terrific
     dialogue, and a whole lot of entertainment.  Rating:
     high +2 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>     At the heart of it all is Marsellus Wallace (played by Ving
Rhames), a Los Angeles crime lord who employs two vicious hitmen, Vince
and Jules (John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson).  The hitmen are on an
errand for Marsellus, killing some young hoods who tried to steal from
Marsellus.  Their conversation is disarming as they discuss how fast
food restaurants are different in Europe and what a "TV pilot" is.
They also talk about Marsellus's wife Mia (Uma Thurman) and what the
crimelord did to someone who gave her a foot massage.  It starts likea
normal job for the two hoods, but it will not be a normal day and
thereby hangs a tale.  Meanwhile super-jealous Marsellus is planning to
ask Vince to look after Mia for a few days while the crime lord is away
on business.  But things are not going to happen like Marsellus plans
and thereby hangs another tale.  At the same time,  the crime lord is
planning to buy off an aging prizefighter, Butch (Bruce Willis), and to
have a fight fixed.  Marsellus is not just in for a surprise, but
genuinely the shock of his life.  And thereby hangs yet another tale.
Harvey Keitel has a terrific little piece proving that an expert
janitor can have more prestige than a hired gun.</P>
<P>     This is a film with some of the weirdest and perhaps among the
most engaging criminals ever put on film.  Tarantino has a real talent
for creating interesting characters and situations, and even for how to
set up a scene so that the audience is constantly seeing the
unexpected.  Even when the plot slows down, as it does during Vince's
night out baby-sitting, the film never bogs down.</P>
<P>     Tarantino, who authored the script based on stories he co-wrote
with Roger Avary, has chosen to tell those stories out of chronological
order.  That throws the viewer a little off balance, but never to the
detriment of the story-telling.  Many scenes are familiar, but
Tarantino makes us see them with a fresh eye.  Whan a character shoots
up with heroin, we have a close-up on the hypodermic with red blood
swirling into the colorless heroin solution before it is injected.  A
visit to a chic hamburger restaurant is a setpiece recreating 1950s
culture.  A taxi ride appears just a little strange until the viewer
realizes everything seen out of the windows of the cab is in black and
white.</P>
<P>     Tarantino has given us a film that is fresh and funny.  It is
peopled with some of the weirdest characters we have seen on film in
quite a while.  It will be interesting to see if he can please both
fans of his ultra-violent action films and a wider audience looking for
interesting stories.  If you do not object to the violence this is a
most rewarding films with authentic horror, action, and characters of
some depth.  I give it a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
