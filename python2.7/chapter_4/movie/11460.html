<PRE>Men With Guns</PRE>
<PRE>Written, directed and edited by
John Sayles</PRE>
<P>The film begins with a Mother(Iguandili Lopez) and Daughter(Nandi Luna
Ramirez) making tortillas in the jungle. They are discussing the impending
arrival of a doctor. This a very alien jungle, and this is a very alien movie.</P>
<P>The doctor is Humberto Fuentes(Federico Luppi), a white haired widower who's
in need of a vacation. Usually he and his wife would go to the beach, but this
year, the first on his own, he decides to visit some students of his who he
thinks are in the mountains. Their training was paid for by the `progress for
peace' program from the USA. </P>
<P>Everyone he knows tells him not to do it. There are rumors of atrocities he
does not belive. Then he sees an ex-student(Roberto Sosa) in the street and
follows him. He confirms the rumor.</P>
<P>But the good doctor still refuses to belive, and heads off into the bush.</P>
<P>The quest for the other students begin.</P>
<P>John Sayles is a great but perverse writer. He begins the journey with the
comic relief. Andrew (Mandy Patinkin) and Harriet(Kathryn Grody) are  two
lefty tourists who keep popping up at the weirdest times. They also get some
of the best lines [how do you say fajita in spanish?].</P>
<P>But most of the rest of the movie isn't at all funny. At his first stop, the
people are all afraid of him except a blind woman(Lolo Navarro), who tells him
that the second of his students has gone off to ‘school.' </P>
<P>A young boy named Conejo(Dan Rivera Gonzalez) agrees, for a fee, to show him
where the school is. And tell him what really happened.</P>
<P>Through a series of adventures, Conejo and the Doctor collect more companions:
Domingo, the soldier(Damian Delgado), who originally stole the doctors tires,
then his money, and needs him to tend his wound, Padre Portillo, (Damian
Alcazar) a priest on the run from the men in the title, and finally,
Graciela(Tania Cruz) rendered mute since she was raped by Domingo.</P>
<P>Each has a story, told either out loud or in flashback. All are interesting. </P>
<P>The ending is a revelation. Don't mind the subtitles, they work.</P>
