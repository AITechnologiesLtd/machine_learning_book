<PRE>                   AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN PARIS 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                    2  :-( :-(   for the hairy beast</PRE>
<P>What started out as promising, spoofy fun took a turn for the worse when
the werewolf started getting nasty. You can't keep laughing when there's
an arm hanging here, a leg hanging there and a bit of blood splattered
everywhere. So what was I expecting? I wanted a tale as tragically
romantic as BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, as touching as BORN FREE and as
carefree as HARRY AND THE HENDERSONS. Too much to ask you might say, but
a subject as overdone as werewolves deserves only the utmost attention.
I was disappointed, not so much because it wasn't original, but because
it didn't carry any heart except within the jaws of the beast.</P>
<P>So I grimaced as I witnessed this blood bath reminiscent of hyenas
ripping apart prey on the Savannah. These mythological men who turn to
beasts at full moon, awaken to feast on the hearts of humans was too
difficult to swallow, even with popcorn and coke on hand. Remember the
Christians being fed to Lions in the Colosseum, well this time round
it's the Americans who get fed to werewolves at numerous night clubs.
Somehow, the French werewolves prefer American blood. This may be pure
coincidence, a subtle hint that Americans aren't welcome in Paris or
more likely that the over-friendly Americans make the easiest prey for
partying wolves. Anyway it was quite amusing to see werewolves
massacring Americans in Paris. It's not a sight you'll find at the zoo.</P>
<P>The cast includes Julie Delpy who talked too much with Ethan Hawke in
BEFORE SUNRISE. In this movie she says less but carries a lot more bite.
She is otherwise charming when she tries to calm the hallucinating Tom
Everett Scott (THAT THING YOU DO) post wolf bite. Her idea of helping
him through the difficult transition from man to wolf is to keep his
hands on her breasts. I've heard that this particular naturipathic
treatment is also effective for insomnia, anxiety and good for
rebuilding finger strength. Unfortunately, this is as enchanting as the
movie gets. Gone are the days when only a silver bullet will kill a
werewolf, now any bullet will do the job. Three cheers for modern
technology, but an overall unhappy movie experience.</P>
