<PRE>"The Conversation" (USA, 1974)
A Film Review by James Kendrick</PRE>

MPAA Rating: R /
Review: **** (out of ****)</P>
<P>As "The Conversation" slowly weaves its absorbing
and intricate web, it works its way under your
skin, drawing you into its sense of paranoia,
until you are sharing the same feelings as the
protagonist, who in this case is a man named Harry
Caul (Gene Hackman).</P>
<P>Caul's profession is surveillance -- watching and
recording other people. Even one of Caul's
fiercest competitors (Allen Garfield) admits that
he is "the best bugger on the West Coast." He is a
private contractor, and will work for anyone,
including rich businessmen or even the government.</P>
<P>When the film opens, Caul and his assistant, Stan
(John Cazale), are in the middle of a difficult
assignment. A mysterious man known only as The
Director has paid Caul $15,000 to record a
conversation between his wife (Cindy Williams) and
another man (Michael Higgins) as they walk in
circles in a park in the middle of downtown San
Francisco during crowded lunchtime.</P>
<P>Caul completes the assignment by using three
recording devices: one in a shopping bag carried
by a man following them, and two parabolic
microphones of his own design positioned over two
hundred yards away. Of course, none of these three
recordings is complete, but back in his studio,
Caul works carefully to assemble the raw footage
into a complete conversation. The scenes depicting
Caul at work reminded me of Antonini's "Blowup"
and Brian De Palma's "Blow Out." Like those
movies, "The Conversation" invites the viewer to
watch over Caul's shoulder as he puts the pieces
together, slowly deciphering what was said.</P>
<P>The conflict comes when Caul breaks his strict
rule of not getting personally involved in his
work when he realizes that when he turns the tape
over to the Director, a murder might ensue. He
doesn't know for sure, but several years ago he
was involved in another assignment that resulted
in three deaths, and he doesn't want to live
through it again. Of course, his job is to listen
to conversations, not to hear them. When Stan
shows curiosity at what the conversation is about,
Caul snaps back this his profession is to not be
curious. "I don't care what's being said," he
says. "I just want a good recording."</P>
<P>Hackman plays Caul as a tightly-strung, paranoid,
and intensely personal man who is incapable of
being involved in human relationships. Early on we
see him with a semi-girlfriend (Teri Garr), but
the relationship sours because he hates being
asked questions, even simple ones like "Where do
you work?" His unrelenting privacy blocks him off
from the rest of the world, so much that he
becomes distraught when he learns that his
landlady has a key to his apartment.</P>
<P>In this way, "The Conversation" is an affecting
tragedy. Although it is a brilliantly written and
expertly-paced mystery with some fantastic twists
and scenes that might make Hitchcock proud, it is
also a finely-tuned character study, mostly due to
Hackman's outstanding performance. It also
incorporates a running theme of how privacy is
slowly being eroded by society and, more
specifically, technology. Caul is paranoid simply
because he knows that any person can be recorded
at any time in any place. He knows because he's
the expert, and even though he is one of the best,
there are others out there.</P>
<P>"The Conversation" was written and directed by
Francis Ford Coppola when he was at the height of
his talent. He had just won Best Picture in 1972
for "The Godfather," and even though "The
Conversation" was nominated for Best Picture in
1974, it lost out to his own "The Godfather Part
II."</P>
<P>But unlike the sprawling "Godfather Saga," "The
Conversation" utilizes Coppola's striking ability
to create a closed sense of claustrophobia and
suspicion. He successfully taps into the primal
fear that we can never be alone, that someone is
always watching. This is one of the few films that
might be more relevant today than it was
twenty-three years ago, because in the age of the
Internet, global telecommunications, and satellite
cameras, the threat of invaded privacy is more
real than ever, and always getting worse.</P>
