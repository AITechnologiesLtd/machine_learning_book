<PRE>                          WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE
                       A film review by Lewis Butler
                        Copyright 1995 Lewis Butler</PRE>
<PRE>In Short:
        Director Todd Solondz has crafted a wonderfully biting
        film, filled with all the horror and angst and pain that
        is, was, and ever shall be Jr. High School.  +3. where
        is average and the scale runs -4 to +4.</PRE>
<P>WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE is a painful movie to watch.  I found myself
cringing in my seat throughout.  However, unlike most films that cause me
physical pain, WTTD is a good film.  The pain comes from reliving Jr. High
school, a fate that can seem worse than death.</P>
<P>The story, such as it is, revolves around Dawn Wiener, aka "Weiner Dog",
played with near-tragic precision by Heather Matarazzo.  Dawn is 11 years
old, is in Jr. High, and her life sucks.</P>
<P>Dawn lives in a surreal version of suburbia.  Her younger sister, Missy, is
so pretty and perfect that the audience can't help wishing great harm to
befall her.   Her brother is the ultimate nerd, even to the point of trying
to start a rock-band (drums, keyboards, and clarinet) to fill an
extra-curricular slot on his college resume.  Her mother hates her, and her
father is ineffective.  These aren't real people, these are caracatures
seen from Dawn's point of view.  Face it, all older brothers are hopeless
dweebs to an seventh grade girl, and all little sisters are perfect and
pretty and revolting.  And all mother hate eleven year-olds, it's how the
world works.</P>
<P>The audience is caught up in Dawn's view of the world, and Dawn's view is
distorted by the sudden realization that most of use have had that life
sucks.  Life is not fair.  Life, and especially Jr. High life, bites.</P>
<PRE>Spoilers</PRE>
<P>There's quite a bit of irony in the fact that Missy, who we all hate,
becomes the focal point of the movie near the end.  Here we've been,
thinking, "someone should really strangle that child" when all of a sudden,
there's a real possibility that someone might have.  Director Todd Solondz
(who also wrote, drawing on personal history) has set the audience up,
fulfilling their wish, and turning that against them.  We sit there,
uncomfortable in our seats, and we identify with Dawn's feelings of guilt.
She thinks it's her fault Missy is missing, but we know better.  We know
it's because of US.  Because of our hatred.</P>
<P>It's a dangerous trick, making the audience feel guilty, but Mr. Solondz
brings it off without a hitch.  He makes everyone identify with Dawn.  It
doesn't matter if you were the most popular kid in school, you're going to
identify with Dawn.  Everyone felt like Dawn at some point in their lives.
Maybe for you it was 6th grade, maybe it wasn't until your freshman year of
college, but we've all been there.</P>
