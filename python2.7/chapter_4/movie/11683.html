MPAA rating: PG-13
review: ** (out of ****)</P>
<P>"The Man in the Iron Mask," based on the classic novel by Alexandre
Dumas, is a well-made adventure film that doesn't have much adventure.
It has a lot of beautiful French locations, a stunning A-list cast of
actors, and technical merit oozing from every corner, but it never
really grabs hold of you the way a good swashbuckling adventure should.</P>
<P>Maybe it has something to do with the fact that the Three Musketeers,
Aramis (Jeremy Irons), Athos (John Malkovich ), and Porthos (Gérard
Depardieu) are retired when the film opens. Or maybe it's because much
of the plot deals with intrigue and mystery rather than swordplay and
gunfights. But no, I think it's something deeper than that. There's an
underlying problem with "The Man in the Iron Mask" that keeps it from
ever being truly entertaining or rousing in the way that it should be.
Simply put, it never convinces us that it's not a costume movie.</P>
<P>The story takes place in France in 1662, where the spoiled young King
Louis (Leonardo DiCaprio) rules in decadent luxury while his subjects
are starving in the streets. The original Three Musketeers have retired,
leaving their fourth, D'Artagnan (Gabriel Byrne) as the head of the
Musketeers, sworn to protecting the King. Louis is a self-absorbed, evil
brat of a king, and he finally pushes the original Musketeers over the
edge when he uses one of King David's nasty tricks from the Old
Testament: he sends Athos's son, Raoul (Peter Sarsgaard) to die in the
front lines of battle so he can make off with Raoul's fiancee, Christine
(Judith Godrèche).</P>
<P>Although D'Artagnan refuses to betray the King, the other Musketeers
conspire to get rid of Louis. It turns out that Louis has a twin brother
that not even his mother, Queen Anne (Anne Parillaud), knows about
because she was told he died after birth. In order to maintain his
unchallenged claim to the throne, Louis had his brother, Philippe (also
played by DiCaprio) put in prison and locked inside an iron mask so no
one would know his identity. The Three Musketeers plan get rid of Louis
by breaking Philippe out of jail and switching him with the evil King.</P>
<P>"The Man in the Iron Mask" was adapted from the Dumas novel by
first-time director Randall Wallace, whose main claim to fame is his
Academy Award-nominated script for Mel Gibson's "Braveheart." Because of
his connection with that film -- also a period movie filled with swords,
evil royalty, and revolution -- comparisons will be inevitable. The fact
is, "Braveheart" worked brilliantly because it pulled use into the story
from its opening moments and convinced us that we were watching William
Wallace fight the English armies in the 12th century. "The Man in the
Iron Mask" never gets us to make that leap, and we are so consciously
aware that it is a period movie that it becomes impossible to be fully
engulfed by it.</P>
<P>Technically, the film is a marvel. Wallace assembled a team of cinematic
professionals who have worked in this kind of material before. The
production design by Anthony Pratt, who did such a brilliant job on John
Boorman's Arthurian epic "Excalibur," is as glorious in the wealth
surrounding King Louis as it is grotesque in the dingy dungeon occupied
by the prisoner of the title. The costumes were designed by James
Acheson, whose experience ranges from "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" to
his Academy Award-winning design for "The Last Emperor."</P>
<P>Ironically, the movie's main drawback is the cast of Academy Award
darling actors. DiCaprio, hot off "Titanic," hits a wall from the get-go
-- he never convinces us that he's a French king. Irons, Malkovich, and
Depardieu all come off like themselves with hair extensions and
Musketeer clothing. Their performances aren't bad, they're just
inadequate for the material. Depardieu has some amusing moments as
Porthos, who is traditionally the fun-loving jokester of the group, but
Irons is too grim and Malkovich is terribly miscast as the grieving
Athos. All these actors have worked in period pieces before, but you
wouldn't know it; their acting is much too stagy to be taken seriously
on film.</P>
<P>Of course, some of the fault can be laid at the feet of Wallace's
dialogue, which is all too often stilted and showy. Not even an actor as
talented and multi-faceted as Gabriel Byrne can pull off a line like,
"To love you is treason to France. But not to love you is treason to my
heart." But, as bad as that sounds, at least we can take heart in the
fact that he didn't even attempt a French accent.</P>
