<P>     Not to be confused with DEAD MAN WALKING, this tedious, episodic
anti-western stars a bespectacled Johnny Depp as William Blake, a timid
accountant from Cleveland whose first day in the muddy frontier town of
Machine is a busy one.  In order, he loses a job that he didn't have,
has a gun pointed at him by the plant owner (Robert Mitchum), beds a
friendly flower girl (Mili Avital), kills her ex-boyfriend (Gabriel
Byrne), rides off into the woods wounded, and is mistaken as the famous
dead poet by the frank-speaking, world-traveled Indian (Gary Farmer) who
rescues him.  There's also trio of bickering bounty hunters (Lance
Henriksen, Michael Wincott, and Eugene Byrd) on the trail, as the dead
man courting was also the plant owner's son.</P>
<P>     Long on interesting characters, but short on interesting action,
DEAD MAN is engaging for, oh, about an hour.  Robby Muller's crisp
black-and-white photography adds a welcome layer of grit to several
sights not normally seen in a western.  As Depp mucks his way down Main
Street, for example, we see a prostitute performing a sex act here and a
horse urinating over there.  The realism is refreshing and goes a long
way toward balancing the more-absurd moments, like Robert Mitchum
speaking to a stuffed bear, Iggy Pop appearing in drag, and Lance
Henriksen feasting on human flesh.  (Need a hand?  No thanks, got one!)
And how about that wild, weird guitar-only score by Neil Young?  Written
and directed by Jim Jarmusch (NIGHT ON EARTH). </P>
