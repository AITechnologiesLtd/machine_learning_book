<P>    We shouldn't be at all surprised that "An Ideal Husband," a
frothy and witty play with melodramatic undertones written in
1895, could almost take place in our own time.  Oh, the
clothing is certainly different now.  Women nowadays who
want to be taken seriously wear somber colors to work,
leaving the excessive jewelry and brightly-colored clothes to
those not on the fast track, while the raiment was quite the
opposite in 1895.  And men looking for executive posts now
shoulder cell phones and dark grey suits while the upper
classes at the turn of the nineteenth century dressed like
penguins.  But though the apparel ofts proclaims the man, dig
beneath the surface and you'll find the same emotions driving
us vulnerable human beings: greed, envy, lust, and a desire
for power over others.  In his play, Oscar Wilde takes pokes
at the mores of the haute societe but his thrusts are so muted, so
tempered by his gentility and frolicsome repartee, that you
sense that Wilde was enamored of England's betters.  As for
his society's structure, he probably wouldn't have it any other
way.  </P>
<P>   In fact in "An Ideal Husband"--as in Wilde's comic
masterwork, "The Importance of Being Earnest"--you'd
scarcely know that a commercial class and (horrors) a
division of unwashed even existed in England.  We meet
only lords and ladies even in Oliver Parker's filmed version,
which greatly opens the stage play and in fact improves the
show. Where a theater director can best succeed by
punctuating its sophisticated language with its paradoxes,
ironies and all-around wit, director Parker--known for his
glowing command at the helm of "Othello"--makes us privy to
all the exquisitely decorated rooms in the homes of these
aristocrats and the lavish grounds trod by elegant stallions
whose grandeur would pass forever with the invention of the
automobile.</P>
<P>   Where you might expect a satirical work to linger upon the
imperfections of the gentry, "An Ideal Husband" turns this
convention of the genre on its head.  Wilde wants us to
realize that we human beings are just that--human and
flawed--and that any effort to place us upon pedestals could
lead to calamity.  Incorporating most of the bon mots of
the four-act play, Parker--who penned the screenplay as well-
- pares away one major incident involving the theft of a
brooch.  He adds some depth, however, to the youngest
character of the story, focusing on a husband who is
ultimately ideal only because both he and his wife can forgive
and come to terms with an indiscretion.  </P>
<P>   The action is launched when the beautiful but icy Mrs.
Laura Cheveley (Julianne Moore), once engaged to the idler-
playboy Lord Arthur Goring (Rupert Everett), approaches Sir
Robert Chilton (Jeremy Northam) at a fashionable London
party of politicians and diplomats.  She wants Chilton, an
influential member of parliament, to give a speech in support
of an Argentine canal in which she has a financial interest. 
Though Chilton knows the canal to be a swindle, he is
brought up sharply by Mrs. Cheveley's threat: if he refuses to
back the canal, Cheveley will take an incriminating letter to
the press which will prove that Chiltern got his wealth 
through an illegal stock scheme some years earlier.  When
Lord Goring advises Sir Robert to confess his lapse of
judgment to his wife, Lady Gertrude Chiltern (Cate Blanchett),
Chiltern refuses lest his wife--who has kept Chiltern on a
pedestal--leave him.  In a later complication with elements of
farce, Lady Chiltern is herself compromised by a suggestive
letter she has written to Lord Goring.</P>
<P>   Much of the fun of this successful movie adaptation comes
from the character of Lord Goring, who at the age of 36
remains a womanizer fearful of committing himself to
marriage. In that role Rupert Everett--perfect as a gay man,
George, in P.J. Hogan's "My Best Friend's Wedding" but
miscast as Oberon in the recent "A MidsummerNight's Dream"--
comes back into his own.  He is splendid as a sometimes befuddled 
but usually astute man-about-town pressured to get married by his 
bemused father (John Wood) and by Chiltern's young sister, Mabel 
(Minnie Driver).  Driver and Everett function in a subplot as comic mimics 
to the more weighty relationship between Northam and Blanchett,
while the fifth person in this quincunx of quidnuncs, Mrs. Cheveley, plays 
the others off against one another while scarcely revealing her own
emotional vulnerabilities.</P>
<P>   The dialogue is anything but flat, virtually every line both
driving the plot forward and functioning as a key to the
playwright's sense of irony.  Like people today, the horsey set
in fin de siecle England often communicated cautiously,
indirectly, and even falsely, as when Cheveley treacherously
assures Goring, "I hate to stand between a man and his
past."  When in a flashback Baron Arnheim (Jeroen Krabbe)
counsels his then-secretary Chiltern that "information can
make you powerful," you'll think immediately of mischievous
stockbrokers today like Michael Milken, who served a term in
jail for feloniously using inside information to make millions </P>
<P>   You come away from this movie with a more forgiving
attitude toward your fellow human beings, at least until you
are hurt by tomorrow's treacheries.  Only extremist groups
will be disgusted by Wildean notions of grace and mercy. 
After all, perhaps Cheveley is not so far off the mark in
pronouncing morality as nothing more than "what we adopt
toward people we dislike."  "An Ideal Husband" has an ideal
balance of wit, farce, and melodrama, crisply edited to keep
the action flowing cinematically from manor to estate, from
parliament to the lavish grounds traversed by London society. </P>
