<PRE>                      THE ANNIVERSARY PARTY
                 A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>    CAPSULE: This is a film of characters and interactions rather 
    than pyrotechnics.  The film is driven by the personalities of 
    the characters.  That's good.  What's missing is the reason to 
    care much about these characters and their interactions.  
    That's bad.  The film has a gamut of emotions presented but 
    few rub off on the viewer.  We need not just more films like 
    this but also better films like this.  I would invest interest 
    in Jennifer Jason-Leigh and Alan Cummings not for current 
    value but for growth potential.  Rating: 5 (0 to 10), low +1 
    (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>THE ANNIVERSARY PARTY is a film about characters and 
relationships. Most of what happens in the film is talk.  We have 
seen a number of such film like John Sayles's THE RETURN OF THE 
SECAUCUS SEVEN, Lawrence Kasdan's THE BIG CHILL, and a personal 
favorite, Bruce Beresford's DON'S PARTY.  I am not sure why the 
latter is a favorite of mine unless perhaps because it is 
Australian and has a little bit of that country's politics.  In 
any case these films are perhaps cautionary tales suggesting that 
parties and get-togethers should be kept brief and free from mind-
altering substances to avoid indecent exposure of painful truths 
(and assorted body parts).</P>
<P>THE ANNIVERSARY PARTY does not take place in an exotic local 
(assuming that DON'S PARTY does) unless you consider the suburbs 
of Los Angeles exotic.  The film is produced, directed, and stars 
Alan Cummings and Jennifer Jason Leigh, but sports a hefty 
ensemble of actors from independent films who are anxious to play 
opposite other actors rather than digital effects.</P>
<P>Sally and Joe (played by Jennifer Jason-Leigh and Alan Cummings) 
are celebrating their sixth wedding anniversary, but not 
celebrating six years together.  They have been together only a 
few months of the six years and have just recently gotten together 
again.  They have invited their friends, most of whom they cannot 
stand.  Though the film Joe is to direct has a character based on 
Sally, He has cast a younger actress, Skye (Gwyneth Paltrow), in 
the role and Sally is less than pleased with Skye.  Also among the 
invitees are the neighbors (Denis O'Hare and Mina Badie) with whom 
a thin coat of civility covers a festering feud over the behavior 
of the Tom and Sally's dog.</P>
<P>Where THE ANNIVERARY PARTY failed for me was in my lack of empathy 
for any of the characters.  The script fails to give us much 
reason to care whether these people are going through a bad patch 
or not.  The script seems contrived to set up ironic dramatic 
revelations and superficial insights into people's characters.  
These people are more involving than checkers on a board, but less 
than chess pieces.</P>
<P>There is not much that can be told in a review about a film like 
this because the characters are introduced, they party, and then 
there are ironic plot twists about the characters.  Introducing 
the characters without telling the plot twists is pointless.  
Revealing the plot twists would spoil the experience of seeing the 
film.  Not that what happens is so dramatic, but in a description 
of such a film less is more.</P>
<P>Alan Cumming and Jennifer Jason Leigh have assembled a cast of 
familiar actors including themselves and Paltrow, but also Kevin 
Kline, Phoebe Cates, Jane Adams, John C. Reilly, Jennifer Beals, 
and Parker Posey. If you do the math, not every one of these can 
be use to his full potential.  Each is part of some small subplot 
and each does a little fun acting exercise.  The feel is as if 
Cumming and Leigh wanted to actually throw a party for their 
friends, mixing business and pleasure.  The result is diverting 
enough to eavesdrop upon but really rather un-engaging as a while.</P>
<P>THE ANNIVERSARY PARTY keeps several plots going, each of which 
will be resolved by the end of the party.  Once they are resolved 
the viewer will happily simply drop them.  There is little to 
think about here after the film is over. I rate THE ANNIVERSARY 
PARTY 5 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.  </P>
