Hannibal (2001) 2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Anthony Hopkins, Julianne
Moore, Ray Liotta, Giancarlo Giannini and Gary Oldman. Written by David
Mamet and Steven Zaillian. Based on the book by Thomas Harris. Directed
by Ridley Scott. Rated R.</P>
<P> Hannibal is a very engrossing, thriller with strong performances,
clever writing and first-rate cinematography. It also is a stomach
turner.</P>
<P> This definitely is not a ìdinner-and-a-dateî movie. Dine at your own
risk before viewing this feature.
I
 f I had to choose one word to describe the difference between Jonathan
Demmeís Silence of the Lambs and this sequel by Ridley Scott, it would
be restraint.</P>
<P> For all the suspense and terror dredged up by Demmeís Oscar-winner, it
is difficult to recall any scenes of graphic violence. Most of the
horror was either spoken about or occurred off screen.</P>
<P> Not in Scottís Hannibal. He shows it all and seems to relish it.</P>
<P> Basically what it highlights is a divergence in style and technique.
For Demme, less was more. He was satisfied with leaving many of the
filmís gruesome details to the imagination of the viewer.</P>
<P> Scott, not wanting to trust the audience of force it to think,
spotlights every depravity. I prefer Demmeís approach, but Iíve always
felt ó like the master filmmakers of years past ó that what is most
terrifying is what the viewer conjures in his or herís mindís eye.</P>
<P> Another difference between the two films is in the presentation of
Hannibal Lecter. In Silence of the Lambs, you were fascinated and
appalled by his actions and while ìrootî may not be the exact emotion,
you probably admitted to yourself that you were glad to see him roaming
free at the finale.</P>
<P> In Hannibal, Lecter  again portrayed by Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins,
is the nominal hero of the piece. While in Silence, your sympathies and
emotional ties centered on FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Oscar-winner
Jodie Foster), in this sequel your investment is with the good, bad
doctor.</P>
<P> And thatís because screenwriters David Mamet and Steven Zaillian,
working from Thomas Harrisí best-selling novel, give us people seemingly
more morally corrupt than Lecter.</P>
<P> How can that be since Lecter not only kills his victims, but eats them?</P>
<P> Simple. Itís because those seeking Lecter are doing so ó not for
justice ó but for revenge and out of avarice.</P>
<P> The revenge is orchestrated by Mason Verger, a billionaire who once was
a patient of Lecter. Lecter convinced Verger, a pedophile, to peel the
skin from his face, leaving him horribly disfigured. Verger (played by
an unrecognizable and unbilled Gary Oldman) has bred a pack of wild
boars for the specific purpose of chomping on Lecter.</P>
<P> The avarice comes in the guise of a Florentine police detective, Pazzi
(a scruffy Giancarlo Giannini), who plots with Verger ó for a price ó to
capture Lecter and deliver him for his retribution.</P>
<P> And finally there is Justice Department official Paul Krendler (Ray
Liotta) who also plots with Verger to use Starling (now played by
Julianne Moore) as bait to lure in Lecter.</P>
<P> As Lecter, Hopkins remains the quintessential human cobra, ready to
uncoil and spring in a second.  What is lacking in his performance is
that element of surprise that was so captivating in the original. He is
a more flamboyant Lecter and thus his sense of menace is diminished.</P>
<P> Moore, as the more mature and cynical Starling, nearly makes you forget
Foster. Nearly, being the operative word. Mooreís Starling remains the
moral heart of the story, unbending, single-minded, dogged and
dedicated.</P>
<P> Yet in Mooreís eyes you can see the doubts, the questioning that has
helped to erode Starlingís youthful idealism.</P>
<P> Hannibal, at two hours and 10 minutes, is a bit uneven. The suspense
fails to build as in the original. Here, Scott gives you a series of set
pieces aimed more to shock than create tension.</P>
<P> The movie is very stylish, very colorful, as is Scottís trademark. It
also is very bloody and gross, almost gratuitous.</P>
<P> Where as Demme would pull back, Scott charges in at full speed, making
sure the audience has the time to savor every sickening act.</P>
<P> It is difficult for any sequel to live up to its predecessor,
especially one as anticipated as Hannibal. That it succeeds most of the
time is a tribute to the collaborative efforts of the filmmakers and
stars.</P>
<P> Yet, you walk out of Hannibal a bit shocked and dazed, but ultimately
unsatisfied. Itís as if Scott served you an appetizer and a dessert, but
forgot the entree.</P>
