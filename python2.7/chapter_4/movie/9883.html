The Ice Storm (1997)</PRE>
<P>Seen on 18 October 1997 with Linda at the Lincoln Plaza Cinemas (birthday
outing for me)
Seen again on 7 November 1997 with Andrea at the same theatre ($17.00)
(her birthday outing)</P>
<P>What exactly is an ice storm? Well, it's the sort of storm that is warm
enough to let it rain but cold enough to let everything freeze. Even the
tiniest tree twigs are covered in heavy, thick ice, that allows you to see
the living thing it encases.</P>
<P>The year is 1973, Nixon is trying vainly to defend himself, and life
follows its dysfunctional pace for two families in well-off New Canaan,
Connecticut. What is truly dysfunctional in the movie is authority.
President Nixon is clearly on the decline, as are the parents in the
movie; they rarely know what is going on in their parents' lives, and the
feeling is mutual. When Jim Carver (Jamey Sheridan) returns from a
business trip and announces his arrival, his alienated son Mikey (Elijah
Wood) says, "You were gone?"</P>
<P>The backdrop of the 1970s does make for  a lot of lighthearted
moments--toe socks, garish interior decor, hideous fashions, and
wife-swapping; but there is a deep sadness and disturbing feeling
throughout *The Ice Storm*. Ang Lee makes wonderful use of silence and
music in between the poignant moments of dialogue. </P>
<P>The Hoods and the Carvers have a variety of problems. Ben Hood (Kevin
Kline) barely knows how to talk with anyone in his family and is having an
affair with Janey Carver (Sigourney Weaver). Elena Hood (Joan Allen) looks
like a completely stressed out Michelle Pfeiffer, as she envies her
daughter's freedom and fends off the advances of the pastor. Jim Carver is
almost completely clueless to everything going on around him. </P>
<P>The children fare no better. They are as empty and joyless as their
parents. Wendy Hood (Christina Ricci) shows a sexual precociousness with
the two Carver boys, while her brother has to fend for himself at private
school, tortured by his own virginity as his roommate makes the moves on
every girl he wants for himself.</P>
<P>*The Ice Storm* is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. All
the performances are great (Christina Ricci stands out in particular), and
the direction, music, and settings all underscore the film's basic themes
of longing, emptiness, loneliness, and sadness. The 1970s kitsch and the
many quirky and humorous moments keep the movie from being overwrought.</P>
<P>Director Ang Lee's short filmography includes *Sense and Sensibility*
(1995), *Yinshi nan nu* (1994 -- aka *Eat Drink Man Woman*), *Hsi Yen*
(1993 -- *The Wedding Banquet*), *Tui Shou* (1992 -- aka *Pushing Hands*,
all of which are wonderfully made and highly entertaining. </P>
<PRE>Based on a novel by Rick Moody.</PRE>
