<PRE>THE BIG GREEN
=============</PRE>
<P>     Has it really been two decades since Walter Matthau coached THE
BAD NEWS BEARS?  Nineteen years and two MIGHTY DUCKS later, the formula
is still going strong.  POLICE ACADEMY graduate Steve Guttenberg stars
as a small-town deputy sheriff corralled into co-coaching the school's
hastily formed soccer team.  His partner-in-crime is the new British
"exchange teacher" (Olivia D'Abo), a lively lass who has obviously seen
DANGEROUS MINDS and knows that the best way to gain the respect of a
disinterested, outer-city audience is to teach them something neat.
Like soccer.</P>
<P>     Most of the good-natured gags are of the fast-motion variety, such
as runaway cows and out-of-control lawnmowers.  Kids will laugh at the
occasional belching bit, while their parents peacefully doze beside
them.  Other than letting a supporting character named Newt go
unscathed, what's missing from THE BIG GREEN is a better integration of
music and comedy.  Instead of a peppy pop score, which would arguably
work to better effect, most of the action is set to a bombastic
orchestral score that belongs somewhere else.</P>
<P>     Comedy needs music.  Just watch any old Bugs Bunny short.  The
Marx Brothers knew it.  Mel Brooks knows it.  Unfortunately, the
current trend is to "overscore."  Lush strings and booming brass in
every scene, at every moment.  Remember the simple strains of Bizet's
"Habanera" in the original BAD NEWS BEARS?  These days, it's usually a
bellowing fanfare that threatens to smother every scene in its path.
Much like adding frosting to already frosted cake.</P>

<PRE>AN AWFULLY BIG ADVENTURE
========================</PRE>
<P>     The reteaming of director Mike Newell and star Hugh Grant is about
as far removed as you can get from the lightsome comedy of FOUR
WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL.  Their second collaboration is a downbeat
theatrical drama about a young intern (Georgina Cates) struggling to
survive in post-W.W.II Liverpool.  Hugh plays the gay director, an
*extremely* unappealing character who may alienate whatever fans are
left after the nonsense of NINE MONTHS.  Bleak make-up and thick
accents conspire to make this a difficult story to settle into.  AN
AWFUL ADVENTURE is not without *some* rewards, tho.  The Peter Pan
subtext is intriguing.  As is the diverse ensemble cast that includes
Peter Firth, Alan Rickman, and Prunella Scales.  Basil!</P>
<PRE>Grade: C</PRE>
<PRE>DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS
=====================</PRE>
<P>     The comparisons to CHINATOWN are easy enough, except for the fact
that this film isn't nearly as gripping.  Writer/director Carl Franklin
(ONE FALSE MOVE) is the force behind this accomplished-but-stiff
adaptation of Walter Mosley's crime novel.  Denzel Washington is as
sturdy as ever, but he's burdened with a miscast supporting cast.  Tom
Sizemore and scene-stealer Don Cheadle are both fine.  The problems
start with Jennifer Beales, who never registers as the plot's femme
fatale.  She's a pretty face and nothing more.  Also underweight are
Maury Chaykin and Terry Kinney.  They play opposing mayoral candidates
in 1948 Los Angeles and neither actor commands enough authority to
stifle giggles.  John Huston, we miss you!  Fine period detail and a
strong sense of humor are a plus.  They help to overcome a pace that's
too polite for Mosley's jazzy, swingin' story.</P>
<PRE>Grade: B </PRE>
<PRE>STEAL BIG, STEAL LITTLE
=======================</PRE>
<P>     I can't say much about this one.  Director Andrew Davis follows
THE FUGITIVE with a wildly unfunny farce about twin brothers (Andy
Garcia) with opposing moral codes.  They're fighting over their
adoptive mother's estate, a 40,000-acre ranch worth millions and
supporting dozens of migrant farm workers.  So many different plots are
trying to come together--feuding brothers, reconciling husbands,
loan-shark hired hitmen--that you have to admire the director's
ambition.  Too bad that almost every single person or plot-line is out
of sync.  That is, with the exception of Alan Arkin.  He's the best
thing in a movie that--despite the work of four credited
writers--*still* manages to waste such diverse talents as David Odgen
Stiers, Kevin McCarthy, and Joe Pantolinao.  And what the heck does
that title mean?</P>
