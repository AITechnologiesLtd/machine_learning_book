<PRE>In Brief -- by Zachary McGhee</PRE>
<P>U-571 [Mostow] -- To summarize Breakdown, Jonathan Mostow's previous
endeavor, I'd offer about sixty-seven synonyms for the words taut,
powerful, suspenseful, professional, so on, so forth. Or, to much more
magnify the apparent slump that he appears to be in, I offer The Game,
1997's best film, as far as I'm concerned, for which Mostow served as
executive producer. This, for the observant among you, however, is not
Breakdown -- nor, by a long shot, The Game. Very little of this one
works, thespians included. The plot is interesting, I suppose, but it's
execution is not. The action is tepid: in fact, some of it is laced with
such boredom that the exit sign appeared much more interesting than the
goings on screen.</P>
