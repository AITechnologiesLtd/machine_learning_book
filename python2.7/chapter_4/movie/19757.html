<PRE>THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Brian Takeshita</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: *** out of ****</PRE>
<P>The premise is pretty simple.  Three young film students go out into
the woods of Maryland to get footage for a project on what locals call
the Blair Witch, an entity who supposedly comes to claim lives from
the local population every so many years.  Although their foray is
supposed to last only a couple of days, they get lost and have a
difficult time getting their bearings despite their possession of a
map and a compass.  Worse yet, each night they are tormented by
strange, haunting noises, and each morning find evidence that someone
or something knows they are there.  Is it the Blair Witch?  Whatever
it is, the students never come out of the forest again.  Sounds like a
fairly run-of-the-mill horror movie, but what's different about this
film is it's a documentary.</P>
<P>Well, okay, it's a mockumentary, but the style in which THE BLAIR
WITCH PROJECT is filmed is so natural, it takes on a very eerie
reality.  Directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez hired three
actors, gave them sketchy details about the roles they were to play
and the rough outline of the plot, and turned them loose in the woods
with cameras, food, and a global positioning system receiver so they
would at least know where they were at any given time.  Myrick,
Sanchez, and a small crew followed the actors at a distance and left
them food and new camera batteries at predetermined checkpoints.  The
actors were free to improvise dialog, and shot all the footage
themselves with a small videocamera and a 16mm black and white, giving
the whole thing a documentary-like look and feel.  The improvised
script is also very effective, for even though much of the dialog is
repetitive and simplistic, it's probably more akin to what real people
would say in this situation than anything pre-written could have
achieved.  It's as if what these three actors are experiencing is
very, very real, making the film even scarier than you'd think.</P>
<P>Aiding in the illusion of reality has been a campaign of rumors and
publicity implying that the story of the disappearing film students
were true.  Even though the directors and actors have been
subsequently interviewed for printed articles, many unknowing viewers
have been uncertain as to the origin of the footage, purported to have
been found mysteriously in the basement of an abandoned house a year
after the "students" disappearance.  Believe me, creepy as this film
was, the fright factor would have gone up exponentially if I had been
under the impression it were real.  If you've got friends who don't
know the secret, don't spoil it for them yet.</P>
<P>Except for a few rare instances, the film doesn't explicitly show us
anything that would actually scare us.  Instead, most of the scares
come from the reactions of the actors, leaving the sources of their
terror to your imagination.  Moreover, a few of the occurrences are
even left up to your own interpretation, causing mild chills for the
next several days as you run the possibilities through your mind.
Those looking for definitive answers, or those who are more fond of
today's "show everything" style of horror film may find this film
lacking, but others will find this approach a breath of fresh air.</P>
<P>THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is not one of those barn burners that throws
scares at you the moment the film starts to roll.  Instead, it's a
slow pot boiler that gives you circumstances and information that
ultimately lead up to an incredibly scary last 20 minutes.  So
frightening is this portion, that "It's not real" was a mantra I said
to myself every so often.  However, that's not to say that the film is
badly paced with nothing to offer until the end.  On the contrary,
while the first hour of the film may not be exactly frightening, it is
a very interesting character study as the film students realize their
hopelessly lost situation, then become aware that they may not be
alone in the forest, and ultimately lose their presences of mind.  As
they slip down that slope toward their ultimate fate, we're right
there along with them.</P>
<P>However, as effective as this film is, there are at least two things
which stand in the way of making it more enjoyable.  First is the fact
that the cameras keep rolling through virtually everything.  The
students have an argument and it's caught on tape.  The students are
scared out of their wits at something they can't see, and yet manage
to keep the 16mm going the whole time.  It occurs to you more than
once that any regular person would drop the camera once things started
getting desperate, and therefore the illusion of reality is shattered
in a few places.  But to their credit, the actors provide a
semi-decent explanation (looking through the camera filters reality,
and they sure don't want to be there), and besides, without the
constant filming there would be no movie.</P>
<P>The second problem is the constant jarring motion of both cameras,
especially the video camcorder.  I realize it would be pretty
difficult to keep a hand-held camera steady while on the move, but the
shakiness was to the extreme and left many at my screening with a
headache or nausea.  Be warned that if you're susceptible to motion
sickness, this film may not be for you.</P>
<P>If you see THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, just keep in mind that the payoff
doesn't occur until the end.  I've heard reports of people walking out
prematurely because "nothing happened," but to do so would be a
definite mistake.  If you wish to be scared, be patient and you will
be rewarded.  But as they say, be careful what you wish for.</P>
