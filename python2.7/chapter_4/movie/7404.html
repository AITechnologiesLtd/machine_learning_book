<PRE>                                PASSENGER 57
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>     After seeing and admiring Wesley Snipes's work in the recent and
preposterous film MURDER AT 1600, I viewed one of his earlier films,
PASSENGER 57.  When PASSENGER 57 was released in 1992, I carefully
avoided it because its reviews were abysmal.</P>
<P>     (1992 was back in the old days.  Today I see most films, promising
or not, so I can review them.  Without this policy, I would have never
seen PRIVATE PARTS or LIAR LIAR, both of which I loved, so there is
something to be said for the see-them-all principle.)</P>
<P>     Like MURDER AT 1600, PASSENGER 57's script (by Dan Gordon and
David Loughery) takes an already questionable premise and contorts it
beyond any hope of credibility.  Hopeless plots have only two
successful strategies, either go for parody or cast a strong lead and
hope the lead can carry the film.</P>
<P>     PASSENGER 57 has exactly one jewel -- Snipes.  He imbues his
character, counter-terrorism specialist John Cutter, with a beautiful
blend of the athletic and the comical.  Although Snipes sometimes seems
too smart for his character, his performance is always interesting,
albeit not as good as in MURDER AT 1600.</P>
<P>     The plot, such as it is, surrounds the hijacking of a plane by
terrorists.  As luck would have it, Cutter happens to be on board the
hijacked plane.</P>
<P>     Bruce Payne, whose specialty seems to be playing in numerous
obscure movies, plays the terrorist leader Charles Rane.  Rane is the
quintessential elusive terrorist whom the police have never been able
to keep under lock and key.  Payne relies on his ever shifting eyes to
express emotion.  His performance is the sort that elicits laughter at
the wrong times.  Elizabeth Hurley plays his side kick, Sabrina
Ritchie.  Her acting relies on a silly collection of sneers.</P>
<P>     Most of the cast plays the material dead seriously, except for
Ernie Lively as Chief Biggs.  Lively did not get the message on the
film's intent and goes for pure parody as the racist southern cop with
an IQ only slightly higher than his age.  Although somewhat
out-of-place, he is just ridiculous enough to be funny.</P>
<P>     Director Kevin Hooks, whose most recent film was FLED, likes lots
of guns and action to keep up the energy.  Bright sets help, with one
scene at the ever popular locale of an amusement park.  On which ride
does one of chases occur?  The Ferris wheel, of course.</P>
<P>     PASSENGER 57 provides brainless entertainment for couch potatoes,
but little more.</P>
<P>     PASSENGER 57 runs a quick 1:24.  It is rated R for violence.  The
film would be fine for teenagers.  Although I enjoyed watching Snipes,
I cannot recommend the film and can only give the picture * 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
