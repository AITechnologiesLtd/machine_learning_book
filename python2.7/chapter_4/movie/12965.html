<P>Note: Some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers.
      Be forewarned. </P>
<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   After months of speculation, the secret is finally out.  The team
   behind GODZILLA have gone to extreme lengths to keep the revamped
   look of the new monster under wraps for the past ten months, even
   obligating cast and crew to sign strict confidential agreements.  The
   teasers and trailers have deliberately revealed precious little, as
   well -- a scaly foot here, an enormous eye there.  Well, to much
   media frenzy, the eagerly-awaited film has finally been unveiled, and
   the truth can be revealed.  It's big.  It's green.  It's reptilian.
   I mean, come on, this is Godzilla -- what *else* is it supposed to
   look like?</P>
<P>   The appearance of the mighty behemoth is the least of the concerns
   for the filmmaking team of Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin, who
   previously brought forth the 1996 smash hit INDEPENDENCE DAY.
   Working from a story they conceived along with Ted Elliott and Terry
   Rossio, GODZILLA has an utterly hackneyed, inane screenplay -- but
   with a film like this, perhaps that's as it should be; anything with
   a shred of legitimacy would probably only serve to underline just how
   ridiculous the premise of a giant lizard stampeding through a
   metropolitan center truly is.</P>
<P>   The original 1954 Japanese film, GOJIRA (released domestically as
   GODZILLA, KING OF THE MONSTERS) was at its heart a cautionary tale
   about the dangers of nuclear escalation.  This new production doesn't
   carry such lofty messages -- and perhaps wisely so; poorly handled,
   and it'd be SUPERMAN IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACE all over again -- but it
   remains faithful to its predecessor in respect to the beast's origin
   as an unforeseen side effect of nuclear testing.  Incorporating
   actual footage of the Abel, Baker, and Castle Bravo test blasts of
   the early 1950s in an inspired, moody opening, Godzilla's inception
   here is from an reptile egg irradiated by fallout from French nuclear
   testing in the South Pacific.</P>
<P>   It doesn't take long for the big guy to get into action.  Sinking a
   Japanese fishing ship with the greatest of ease, only glimpses of the
   amphibious monster are revealed during the attack, and it's not until
   it reaches its final destination that the reinvented beast is
   completely revealed.</P>
<P>   In the meantime, we're introduced to Howdy Doody hero Dr. Niko
   Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick), a biologist from the U.S. Nuclear
   Regulatory Commission who studies effects of radiation leakage.
   Whisked away from his Chernobyl earthworm studies (I am not joking)
   by the military in order to examine the irradiated wreckage of the
   Japanese vessel, he repeatedly encounters mysterious Frenchman
   Philippe Roache, who, accompanied by a small entourage of fellow
   countrymen (all of which are amusingly named Jean-something), may or
   may not be a mere insurance company representative.  (My bet would
   be: not.)  Mr. Broderick imbues his character with such flagrant
   ingenuousness that a scene where a pull-back reveals him obliviously
   standing in the depths of a gargantuan footprint, intended to strike
   awe into the hearts of the audience, only serves to make his
   character appear like a floundering idiot.</P>
<P>   Our other two protagonists are found in New York City, "the city that
   never sleeps" according to Sinatra and the text crawl which
   introduces the bustling metropolis -- given the ominous aesthetic Mr.
   Emmerich aims for, it might have been better described as the city
   where it never stops raining.  In an insipid thread, Audrey Timmonds
   (Maria Pitillo) is spinning her wheels as assistant to egotistical
   hotshot TV news anchor Charles Caimain (Harry Shearer).  Stifled in
   her attempts at career advancement to full-fledged on-air
   correspondent, she spends much of her time bemoaning her woes to a
   sympathetic Victor "Animal" Palotti (Hank Azaria), a rough-'n-tumble,
   ready-for-anything TV cameraman.  Luckily for the frustrated Audrey,
   she just so happens to be the former flame of Nik, which
   automatically means by the end of this film, she'll have fulfilled
   her career aspirations in triumphant fashion, and outwrangled her
   oppressive, villainous superior to boot.</P>
<P>   Although the film's four protagonists are human, the real star of the
   show is Godzilla, and when it finally makes its bow in the
   waterlogged Big Apple, it's quite a sight to behold.  The shots of
   the monster are suitably impressive, if not quite awe-inspiring; it's
   not a CGI effect that hasn't been seen before in the JURASSIC PARK
   pictures -- it's only bigger.  In fact, the creature's sheer
   magnitude is somewhat problematic in that it's vaguely offputting --
   it's *too* big.  Size *does* matter, but when the beast towers over
   the city to the degree that it does here, it becomes increasingly
   distant and uninvolving, and Godzilla loses some of its indescribable
   charisma -- an important factor here, since the filmmakers are
   clearly aiming for the audience to sympathize with the giant reptile,
   at least to some degree.  Gone is the cheerfully malevolent Godzilla
   of old, toppling buildings left and right as it stomped its way
   through anything in its path -- our new-age Godzilla is much more
   tidy, accidentally leaving in its wake a path of destruction as it
   thoughtfully navigates up and down city streets and boulevards.  And
   this fearful Godzilla actually flees from its minuscule human
   attackers!  Where have you gone, Godzilla Senior?</P>
<P>   Predictably, I found myself rooting for the marauding Godzilla rather
   than our heroes -- not because the filmmakers were successful in
   winning audience empathy for the beast ("It's only an animal," whines
   sensitive, ecologically-minded Dr. Tatopoulos), but by default, since
   all of the human characters are so inept that it's impossible to
   cheer for them.  The military, in particular, is woefully pathetic;
   they're suffering from stormtrooper-itis, unable to hit a target 200
   feet high.  I felt like running up with a can of red paint and
   marking a giant bullseye on Godzilla's back in the hopes that it
   might help.</P>
<P>   Dr. Tatopoulos hypothesizes that Godzilla has traveled to New York in
   order to lay its eggs; the military dismisses this as preposterous
   and refuses to heed his warning, so by default you know that he's
   right.  Consequently, while the armed forces lick their wounds and
   prepare for a rematch with the big green guy, Tatopoulos and Roache's
   team, trailed by newshungry Audrey and Animal, inflitrate the
   evacuated city in search of Godzilla's nest, eventually finding
   hundreds slimy eggs within the devastated confines of Madison Square
   Garden.  (What, no Yankee Stadium?)  While fumbling Audrey and Animal
   finally reveal their presence, Roache's squadron set out to destroy
   the nest with explosive devices, while Ripley torches the eggs with
   her flamethrower.  Whoops, wrong movie.  And when an irate Godzilla
   itself stumbles onto the scene, we're set for an action-packed finale
   where our four protagonists confronts the giant lizard.  "Mommy's
   very angry," whispers one character as the reptile bellows in rage.
   Whoops, wrong movie.</P>
<P>   While the film is often inconsistent with respect to Godzilla's
   abilities (how can the beast outrace attack choppers in one chase
   scene, yet is unable to keep up with an old clunky automobile in
   another?  I guess its fish diet binging hampered its mobility), some
   of the action sequences are entertaining.  The cat-and-mouse game
   with the infant 'zillas in Madison Square Garden is old hat after
   similar sequences in the Spielberg JURASSIC PARK pictures, but
   they're sufficiently well-executed by Mr. Emmerich to be exciting.
   For Gothamites, there's much to cheer about as various familiar city
   landmarks are depicted in various states of disarray in the wake of
   Godzilla's destructive path; in a scene which ends with the
   exclamatory instruction to destroy MSG, I wouldn't be surprised to
   learn that New York prints of the film have applause cues here.</P>
<P>   The monster scenes are adequate, but any time people are onscreen
   instead of the creature, there's an overwhelming compulsion to give
   the film the MST3K treatment.  The character development is anemic,
   and the gags and one-liners are outright pathetic (even the Siskel &
   Ebert spoof is milked a bit too far; I wonder if Ebert minded,
   though, since the Gene character was his subordinate).  None of the
   human characters are remotely engaging, and the dialogue is utterly
   banal.  In fact, the human side of the story, with its various inane
   subplots, is so blissfully hackneyed that it begins to take on a life
   of its own.  It's so ridiculously weak that I could barely contain
   myself from chortling anytime anyone said anything.  GODZILLA is a
   film best approached if you're prepare to laugh; otherwise, you'll
   just end up groaning a lot.</P>
<P>   Of course, one might have hoped for a bit more than just a good bad
   movie from a project budgeted at $120 million.  With regards to the
   genre, Mr. Broderick commented, "You have to care about the people
   being chased by aliens or monsters for the movie to work.  Otherwise,
   it's just a bunch of explosions and special effects."  Exactly.</P>
