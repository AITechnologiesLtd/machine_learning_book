<PRE>                              AMERICAN PIE
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     This is certainly the year for comedy, with SOUTH PARK, AUSTIN
POWERS 2, and now AMERICAN PIE making the last month alone nothing short
of a gut buster.</P>
<P>     With all the sophistication of PORKY'S 2, AMERICAN PIE is a teen
sex comedy (and was originally titled as such) that leaves taste and
sophistication at the door and goes straight for the comedic jugular.
The highest-of-concepts plot is simple:  Four high school virgins vow to
lose their virginity by the end of school, and the prom is only three
weeks away.  Plots and schemes are hatched out the yin-yang.</P>
<P>     What these guys will do for sex is... well, is what any guy will do
for sex, of course.  But these guys are really funny about it.  Antics
include paying off a girl to spread rumors of one's endowment.  A secret
book of advanced technique.  Joining the choir to meet chicks.  Hooking
up a net-cam to catch the exchange student undressing.  And of course, a
practice session with the titular pie.</P>
<P>     AMERICAN PIE isn't so shocking as SOUTH PARK, which has mercilessly
stolen its thunder, but it's got moments of such sheer hilarity you
can't help but feel drained (from laughter) after leaving this pic.
Sure, it isn't going to appeal to everyone, but if you've grown tired of
the histrionics on shows like `Dawson's Creek,' this movie is a breath
of fresh air.</P>
<PRE>     Take it from me; I left the theater hungry.  So to speak.</PRE>
