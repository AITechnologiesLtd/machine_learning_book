<PRE>American Pie (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>review</PRE>
<P>If you take a look at this movie's poster, then you will find this movie
probably not worth seeing. No big names and not an attractive title.
Probably another high school movie. But if you go and see this movie, all of
that will change.</P>
<P>This movie must be one of the funniest movies since There's Something About
Mary, but this time without a hot Cameron Diaz.</P>
<P>It's about four regular high school seniors, Jim, Oz, Finch, and Kevin. They
are not the studs of the school, nor the nerds. Just the average student,
which you'll probably forget after 5 years. At one party they made a pact to
have sex and lose virginity, after they hear that Sherman (the nerd a.k.a.
The Sherminator) brag about sex. And what better time to lose virginity than
on prom night?</P>
<P>So the story goes on, with each character using their own method of getting
laid, or at least a date to prom night. What makes it very real is the
reality of this condition. Regular guys not being able to "get some" during
high school years, and with peer pressure this becomes very obsessive to
some of us... eh... them.</P>
<P>In this movie you'll find funny but very real things: watching scrambled
adult movies on television when his/your parents suddenly walked in (most
probably at least once happened to you guys), father gives son adult
magazines (luckily that didn't happened to me), parent find condoms in
his/your drawer, and premature ejaculation.</P>
<P>This movie is as real as it can get, and with the R-rating it gets better.
Not because the audience can see some tits, but also because teenagers these
days live in a R-rated society. The cast also portraits the average high
school senior, not too cocky or too nerdy or even too beautiful.</P>
<PRE>And by the way, cool soundtrack!</PRE>
<P>Will Jim, Oz, Finch, and Kevin score on prom night? American Pie is just not
about the quest for sex, but also about relationship, friendship, safe sex,
love, and offcourse home made American apple pie!</P>
