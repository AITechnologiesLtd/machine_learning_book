<PRE>A review by John Beachem</PRE>

 Jamie Kennedy - Walter Wogeman</PRE>
<P>If there's one new idea that I could quickly become irritated by, it's major
motion pictures being shot with a home video camera. This idea, which proved
popular in "The Blair Witch Project", is now being used in the Gulf War film,
"Three Kings" for no apparent reason. Well everyone, if you thought we were the
good guys in Desert Storm, you were wrong. According to "Three Kings" the
Americans are evil intruders, save four renegade soldiers.</P>
<P>Archie Gates is a commander at the end of his career. He therefore has nothing
to lose when three soldiers Troy Barlow , Chief Elgin , and Conrad Vig discover
a map to a stash of gold stolen from the Kuwaities by Saddam. While stealing
the gold back however, they break the cease fire by killing several of Saddam's
troops. Soon, they've teamed up with a group of rebels and their only concern
is to save the people of Iraq. During this entire affair, we're treated to an
utterly pointless subplot which involves one soldier, Walter Wogaman leading a
reporter on a wild goose chase.</P>
<P>There are so many irritating details in this movie that I'm not entirely sure
where to begin. The utterly pointless violence in some scenes is quite
irritating. For example, Clooney describes what a bullet does once inside the
body to his cohorts. During his description, we're treated to a scene actually
displaying the gruesome subject. We are also given the chance to see such
things as a cow exploding (this is apparently very funny), a mother being shot
in the head, a baby and mother being blown to bits, and a child being crushed
by debris.</P>
<P>The grainy, home video like shooting is apparently supposed to add realism,
though I think it is present only to make the film appear more "arsty".
However, about half way through, the filming suddenly shifts to regular
Hollywood style. Almost all the humor in "Three Kings" falls flat, being
completely out of place in a movie as violent as this. The script is also
predictable and rather poorly written.</P>
<P>There are a few redeeming qualities here. The acting is solid all around, and
some of the gun fights are truly interesting when shot in slow motion. These
few things aren't nearly enough to save this sub-par film however. I grant it
two stars, and a recommendation to steer clear unless you're looking for a nap
or a sick stomach.</P>
<P>* * * * * - One of the greatest movies ever made, see it now.
* * * * - Great flick. Try and catch this one.
* * * - Okay movie, hits and misses.
* * - Pretty bad. See it if you've got nothing better to do.
* - One of the worst movies ever. See it only if you enjoy pain.</P>
