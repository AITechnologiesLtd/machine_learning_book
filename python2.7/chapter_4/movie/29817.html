<P>People looking for escapist fun at the theatre may be polarized by Rod
Lurie's The Last Castle.  While it doesn't deal with terrorism and isn't set
in New York City, the film does feature a scene where a helicopter is
hijacked and used to plow into a building in order to kill a guy who's just
doing his job.  And that's not even counting the patriotic, flag-waving
(literally) finale.</P>
<P>In the film, Robert Redford (The Horse Whisperer) plays a three-star U.S.
Army General named Irwin, who, after pleading guilty to a crime, is shipped
off to a maximum-security military prison run by Colonel Winter (James
Gandolfini, The Mexican).  Although we don't know anything about his
background, it is assumed Irwin is some kind of military hero, on account of
Winter being all geeked up about his impending arrival.  The other inmates
don't feel quite the same way, as some place bets with the prison bookie
(Mark Ruffalo, You Can Count on Me) about potential suicide attempts.</P>
<P>The two men butt heads almost immediately, launching a
who's-got-a-bigger-cock battle for control of the prison (it's called The
Castle, by the way).  Winter has fun using the inmates as pawns and watches
it all from a big third-story window like a kid with an ant farm, while
Irwin quickly earns the respect of his peers in a very silly scene that
involves moving a large pile of heavy rocks (it probably should have been
set to Aretha Franklin's "Respect").  Winter looks down from on high,
proudly declaring, "He's playing soldier," as he surveys Irwin from an
office filled with shiny war toys he has collected over his combat-free
career. How's that for subtle?</P>
<P>We slowly begin to learn things about Irwin (he was both a bad father and a
POW), but as Castle approaches the 70-minute mark, there are still two huge
questions left hanging in the air:  What crime did he commit, and where the
hell is Delroy Lindo?  But the background of his character barely matters
when he's so busy questioning and undermining Winter's authority.  Like the
song goes, Irwin wants to accentuate the positive when it comes to these
incarcerated soldiers, while Winter would rather dwell on the negatives in
their lives, like the times they committed murder and assault and stuff.
It's hard to say whether Irwin is doing it all for one last battlefield
victory, or out of sheer boredom, or because he has a legitimate beef with
Winter and his managerial style.</P>
<P>Castle was directed by former film critic Rod Lurie (The Contender), and
while his casts keep getting bigger and better, this is his first picture to
be penned by someone else.  Unfortunately, that "someone else" is David
Scarpa and Graham Yost, the latter of whom has churned out a whole lot of
crap (Mission to Mars, Hard Rain) since hitting pay dirt with Speed a decade
ago.  Their story is as far-fetched as anything you'll see on the screen
this year, and is worsened by their decision to make hardened criminals into
something resembling the football players in Remember the Titans.  I've got
a problem with prison pictures that are, essentially, about a guy who isn't
supposed to be there (which is why Oz is so frigging great), but making
every single murderer and rapist into a sympathetic character is going way
too far.</P>
