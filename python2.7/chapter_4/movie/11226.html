<PRE>Twilight (R) ** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Three, count 'em, three Academy Award winning thespians in prime
form--Paul Newman, Susan Sarandon, and Gene Hackman--lead the cast of
Robert Benton's Twilight.  While that would appear to be enough to
distinguish the film, Twilight is curiously missing the one element that
should be a mystery-thriller's stock-in-trade: the element of surprise.</P>
<P>But I suppose Twilight _does_ hold some surprise in its lack thereof.  The
story is not without promise.  Burnt-out former cop, ex-private
investigator, and recovering alcoholic Harry Ross (Newman), has been in the
exclusive employ of married actors Jack and Catherine Ames (Hackman and
Sarandon) ever since rescuing their rebellious young daughter (Reese
Witherspoon, whose character's major contribution is appearing topless)
from an illicit Mexican getaway with an older lover (the ubiquitous Liev
Schreiber) years before.  As the poster's tagline goes, "Some people can
buy their way out of anything.  Except the past."  This dark past starts to
come to light when the cancer-stricken Jack enlists Harry to drop off a
stash of money to a woman at a seedy apartment.  Instead of finding the
woman, Harry finds a gravely wounded, gun-toting man, which leads to the
reopening of the mystery behind years-ago disappearance of Catherine's
first husband.</P>
<P>Benton and co-scripter Richard Russo run into trouble once the set-up is
out of the way.  While they infuse the proceedings with an appealing sense
of humor, and Newman's Harry is an unconventionally self-effacing hero, the
story's would-be twists are obvious and telegraphed, and to call its
resolution a "payoff" is to suggest a satisfaction that it does not
deliver.  Benton and, surprisingly, cinematographer Piotr Sobocinski (who
created the gorgeous palette of Krzystof Kieslowski's Three Colors trilogy)
botch the atmosphere, which is much too light to create an appropriate aura
of mystery; only Elmer Bernstein's evocative score generates the right
effect.  At the very least the top trifecta of Newman, Sarandon, and
Hackman turn in terrific work, but, again, where is the surprise in that?</P>
<P>It is nice to see three fine actors in the upper reaches of age headline a
major project from such a youth-obsessed industry.  As refreshing as that
fact is, though, it is dispiriting that the film they are given to carry is
as unsatisfying as the dull (and dully titled) Twilight.  (opens March 6)</P>
