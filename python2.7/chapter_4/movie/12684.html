<PRE>DEEP IMPACT **1/2 (out of four)

That's Film FREAK Central)</PRE>
<P>Starring Tea Leoni, Morgan Freeman, Robert Duvall, Elijah Wood
Written by Bruce Joel Rubin and Michael Tolkin
Directed by Mimi Leder</P>
<P>I thought the "competing projects" trend had reached its zenith in
1992 when two overwrought Christopher Columbus movies reached the
screens. The fact that both of them died quickly at the box office
didn't deter the studios from financing separate films about
volcanoes and track-star Prefontaine. Now, Deep Impact is the first
asteroid picture out of the gate - July brings us Armageddon - and
it's certainly no embarrassment to the ‘end of the world'
genre.</P>
<P>Freeman is the President of the United States, bearer of bad news: a
comet the size of Mt. Everest is careening towards Earth, and unless a
team of astronauts can throw it off course, the world as we know it
will end. In three separate stories, we see how this information
‘deeply impacts' U.S.  citizens. Leoni is an MSNBC reporter who
first cracks the story and hopes that her divorced parents will
reunite before certain doom. Duvall is a veteran astronaut who
accompanies green pilots on the impossible mission. (These are the
best scenes in the film, but the idea that these young astronauts
shun, rather than look up to, Duvall is questionable-false
conflict.) And Wood is a teenage astronomer whom, essentially,
discovered the deadly rock and has it named after him; he wants to use
his fame to bring his girlfriend (Leelee Sobieski, a dead ringer for
Helen Hunt) and her family underground with him, where 800 000 people
have been randomly selected to live during and after the possible
devastation.</P>
<P>After the boring The Peacemaker, Leder's debut, I was not looking
forward to Deep Impact, but she brings an energy to the proceedings
here that she previously employed on the adrenalized series "E.R." She
handles the material with sensitivity, though she skimps on how the
public copes during the year leading up to destruction. As well, by
following three stories focusing on less-than-average people (a
reporter, an astronaut, and a famed-astronomer), a perspective is
skewed-these are characters with a constant inside track to
scientific progress, also presumably more rational than typical John
Doe. I also didn't buy Wood and Sobieski-they seemed more like
brother-and-sister than high-schoolers in crush.</P>
<P>Yet the gripping moments in Deep Impact almost compensate for its
flaws.  I really enjoyed the landing-on-the-comet
sequence-Armageddon will have its work cut out. Freeman and Duvall
are outstanding, as is Vanessa Redgrave as Leoni's mother. In
addition, whenever the film slowed down-a scene in which Duvall
reads "Moby Dick" to fellow teammate Ron Eldard is downright
leisurely-it hints at a bigger, meatier movie that might be on the
cutting room floor. One thing's for sure: the climax will have a
deep impact on anyone who envisions environmental eradication when
Freeman makes his first speech-nightmarish in spectacle, it's
possibly worse, and more terrifyingly beautiful, than you could ever
imagine.</P>
