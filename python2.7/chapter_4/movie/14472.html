<PRE>Twin Dragons (1992)</PRE>
<PRE>Review by Chris Meadows
Review Rating: 8 out of 10</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Tsui Hark & Ringo Lam
Produced by Teddy Robin Kwan</PRE>
<P>Starring Jackie Chan, Maggie Cheung, Teddy Robin Kwan, Nina Chi Li,
    Philip Chan, etc.</P>
<PRE>MPAA: Unrated</PRE>
<P>Many people laud Jackie Chan's kung-fu fighting and stunt-performing
abilities without realizing the true secret of his cinematic success.
Martial artists and stuntmen are a dime a dozen, but what really sets
Jackie Chan above the rest is his wonderful knack for physical comedy.
He has few equals in that field, at least among those working
today--Bruce Campbell and Jim Carrey are the only other names that
come immediately to mind.  And it is comedy, rather than fighting,
that makes "Twin Dragons" worth watching.</P>
<P>The premise of "Twin Dragons" is that Jackie Chan plays both halves of
a pair of twins who were accidentally separated at birth, grew up into
entirely different people, and eventually run into and get confused
for each other in Hong Kong.  Sound familiar?  The same basic idea was
done by Van Damme in "Double Impact," which was also set in Hong Kong
and made the year before...but whereas in "Double Impact" the point
was to have two Van Dammes to show twice as much beefcake and kick
twice as much butt at once, "Twin Dragons" plays up the comedy aspect
of mistaken identities--in fact, one of the Jackie Chans can't fight
at all.</P>
<P>After the opening, in which the twins are split, they grow up
separately--the one who was lost becomes Boomer, a tough auto
mechanic, road racer, and street hustler, while John Ma, the one who
went with his parents to America, grows up to be a virtuoso piano
player and orchestra conductor.  </P>
<P>As the film begins, Boomer's friend Tyson (played by Teddy Robin Kwan,
also the film's producer) falls for a karaoke singer named Barbara
(Maggie Cheung).  In pursuit of her, Boomer and Tyson bust up a party
for a Triad (mob) figure, Brother Wing (Alfred Cheung).  In lieu of
breaking Boomer's leg, Wing challenges Boomer to a road race, with
stakes of three hundred thousand Hong Kong dollars (about $33,000 US).
When the twosome attempts to flee Hong Kong, they get into a boat
chase with Wing's men which ends up critically injuring Wing.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, John Ma has come to Hong Kong for the first time since his
family left, to conduct a concert, and is set up with a rather
attractive female nurse, Tammy (Nina Li Chi), by Tammy's father, an
old family friend.  As fate would have it, the Ma twins _almost_ meet
several times, confusing all those with whom they come into contact
(including Tyson, a waiter, Tammy, Barbara, Tammy's ex-boyfriend
Rocky, and each other), accidentally get switched with each other,
meet, switch back and forth two more times, and get stuck in each
other's roles when it comes time to conduct the concert and the
mobsters have a job they need Boomer to do.  In the end, they join
forces to save Tyson from the mob brothers in a climactic kung-fu
comedy battle.</P>
<P>Chan fans expecting the sort of back-to-back fighting action seen in
"Double Impact" may be disappointed.  This movie has only one fighting
Chan in it, that being Boomer--when the thugs come after John Ma, he
has to run away or get beaten up.  However, the fight scenes where
Boomer does his thing are everything we've come to expect from Jackie
at his prime--constant motion, use of handy props as improvised
weapons, and fast and furious action.</P>
<P>Chan fans shouldn't fret too much, though, because there _are_ two
_comedic_ Chans in "Twin Dragons."  As might be expected, each Jackie
Chans is constantly being mistaken for the "other" Jackie, and neither
one quite realizes what's going on at first.  The funniest scene of
the movie comes in John Ma's hotel suite, when Tammy unknowingly
corners the two Jackie Chans in the bathroom and they have to convince
her that there's only one of them...while taking a bath together.
There is physical comedy, too: being twins, the brothers share sort of
a psychic link.  When John Ma is playing the piano, Boomer's hand
twitches as though he were playing the piano, too.  When Boomer is
racing a speedboat, attempting to escape from Brother Wing's thugs,
John Ma is jerked this way and that (disrupting their dinner in a fine
restaurant) as Boomer tries to keep his balance.</P>
<P>The version of "Twin Dragons" that I saw was dubbed and
pan-and-scanned, bought from Best Buy for under $5.  While I
personally prefer subtitled and letterboxed films, this one was
nonetheless well worth the money.  The voice acting was quite good,
and Cam Clarke, one of my favorite voice actors, did a fine job of
differentiating the two different Jackie Chans.</P>
<P>All in all, this very entertaining film gets a rating of 8 out of 10
from this reviewer.</P>
<P>An interesting side note: "Twin Dragons" was made as a charity project
by the Hong Kong Director's Guild, and features cameo appearances by
many reknowned Hong Kong directors.  Most notably, John Woo is the
priest on the left at the wedding, Tsui Hark and Ringo Lam (the
directors of "Twin Dragons") are two of the card-playing mechanics in
the Mitsubishi testing facility, and Philip Chan (who played the
police superintendent in Woo's "Hard-Boiled," and who, interestingly
enough, also had a role in Van Damme's "Double Impact") is the hotel
manager.  Other Hong Kong directors, who will probably not be
recognized by non-Hong Kong-cinemaphiles on this side of the Pacific,
fill many of the film's other minor roles.</P>
