<PRE>Directed by Joel Coen</PRE>
<PRE>Written by Ethan Coen and Joel Coen</PRE>
<P>Starring Francis MacDormand, Steve Buscemi, William H. Macy</P>
<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>     The Coen brothers have a good track record with dark comedy.  Everyone
who knows the business knows this.  With Raising Arizona, the gave us the
funniest chase scene ever captured on celluloid.  With Fargo, however, they
through their track record with comedy out the window and attempt to be
serious.</P>
<P>     Well, not really.  Fargo still contains an offbeat humor.  It still
contains a sense of the quirky and strange.  However, it takes it into a
darker, more insane level.</P>
<P>     Fargo, like The Big Lebowski, and Raising Arizona concerns a
kidnapping.  This kidnapping's perpetrator is Jerry Lundergard (William H.
Macy).  The target of the kidnapping is Jean Lundergard.  Jerry, a car
salesman as dirty as the deals he does, is in debt.  He hires a couple of
thugs (including Steve Buscemi) to kidnap her.  They're going to be paid out
of half of an $80,000 ransom, a ransom which Jerry is telling his
father-in-law (who's paying the ransom) is $1,000,000.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, something goes wrong.  When a cop stops the thugs car on
the road outside of Brainard, he is shot and killed, along with two innocent
people who witnessed the murder.  The thugs demand the full $80,000, and
tensions start to develop.  The smart Chief of police of Brainard, Marge
(Frances MacDormand) is brought in to investigate the murders and we have
the makings of an intelligent mystery.</P>
<P>     Taking its cue to generate humor on the Minnesota accent, the film is
dotted with it's famous (or perhaps now infamous) line of `yah', which
almost every character says at least once.  The profanity, as characteristic
of the area, is also low.</P>
<P>     Also, the Coens create one of the most startling works of imagery done
in recent years.  Using the snow as a symbol for both a moral and physical
bleakness (this was also used by their friend Sam Ramni in A Simple Plan),
the entire movie is set in the winter of Minnesota and North Dakota, an area
startling cold as anyone who's ever been there can tell you.  The characters
seem to be as cold as their environment.  Also, in another feat of imagery,
the statue of Paul Bunyan in Brainard is often displayed in a film noir
aspect: it is lit from below and shown at night to be a menacing item.  The
entire film has an aura of cruelty about it.</P>
<P>     In fact, cruelty seems to be its point.  Not being cruel to us, but
proving how bad cruelty is.  It displays its openly essayistic point a
little too blaringly at the end… although moral ambiguity dots this film, no
one can misinterpret the message.</P>
<P>     That is the only fault I can find in this film.  The script, although
frighteningly odd and not at all part of any conventional formula, is
excellent, worthy and winning the Best Original Screenplay award in 1996.
The acting is top notch, earning it another Academy Award for Best Actress
(Frances MacDormand).  The direction is steely.  For this excellent film,
all I can say is I have no other complaints.</P>
