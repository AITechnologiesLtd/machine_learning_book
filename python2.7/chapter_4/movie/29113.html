<PRE>"Osmosis Jones"</PRE>
<P>Frank (Bill Murray) is not what you'd call a health nut. His idea of haute
cuisine is to smear a boiled egg with mayonnaise and load it with salt.
When, after dropping said egg on the ground at the zoo where he works and,
against his daughter Shane's (Elena Franklin) advice, he eats it, he
doesn't realize the trouble he is in? He ingests a deadly virus and it's up
to the denizens within Frank's body, led by a cocky white blood cell, to
save him from himself in "Osmosis Jones."</P>
<P>Peter and Bobby Ferrule enter a brave new world when they take us into the
less-than-healthy body known to its inhabitants as the City of Frank.
Osmosis Jones (Chris Rock), an anti-body with an attitude, is a member of
the Frank PD and is always getting into trouble with his boss, the Chief,
for his renegade moves. When the deadly virus named Thorax (Laurence
Fishburne) invades Frank's body, only Osmosis sees that their host is in
great peril. That is, until he is joined by Drib (David Hide Pierce), a
twelve-hour time-release cold pill with germ-fighting power. It's up to
this unlikely duo to search out the evil Thorax and eliminate him.</P>
<P>Watching "Osmosis Jones," I kept having a feeling of familiarity with the
concept. What came to mind most strongly, at first, was the 1966 sci-fi
flick "Fantastic Voyage." That F/X extravaganza took us inside the human
body for the first time to show us what makes it tick. But, it didn't
attempt to bring anthropomorphic life to the inner workings of the body.
Then, it struck me - Woody Allen had just such a vignette in his ambitious
1972 comedy "Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex (but Were
Afraid to Ask)" where the inhabitants of a man's body work together to help
him get laid. It was an amusing short that used actors (such as Burt
Reynolds and Tony Randall) to give human faces to the various internal
parts of the body.</P>
<P>The Farrelly brothers take the idea a quantum leap from short vignette to a
feature length animation that is part cop show, part action flick and
populated with police, crooks, corrupt government officials, laborers,
white collar workers, villains and a sexy babe. They combine the
live-action story about Frank, a widower that, when his wife died, lost
nearly everything - his job, his life and, very nearly, his mind. He gave
up caring about himself, eats junk food and doesn't exercise, much to the
chagrin and concern of his daughter, Shane. When he invokes the "ten second
rule" (if you drop something on the ground for less than ten second, it's
edible) at the zoo he now works at, he unknowingly introduce the Red Death,
Thrax, into his body. The killer virus, which has a string of victims under
his belt, vows to finish the City of Frank off in less than 48 hours.</P>
<P>Thrax sets up shop with his henchmen in the festering in-grown toenail on
Frank's foot and mercilessly plots to set a fever ablaze within their host
and add Frank to his growing list of casualties. No one in the city, save
Osmosis Jones, recognize the peril the city is in. With only the help of
Drix and a sexy little red blood cell, Leah (Brandy Norwood), to depend on,
Osmosis begins his own fantastic voyage as he hunts down the deadly virus
to put a stop to his mayhem.</P>
<P>Utilizing the talents of Hollywood's top animators and CGI artists, the
Farrellys have created a unique city within the man. Combining a
hard-boiled detective story with animation fantasy is no easy task and the
Farrellys are partially successful with their effort. It helps that Bill
Murray is willing to get down, dirty and disgusting as the bedraggled Frank
who wants to do the right thing for his daughter but is mired so deeply in
his grief, he doesn't care what damage he inflicts on himself. The makers
flash back and forth between Frank's self-abuse and the citizens of the
city trying to cope with his bad habits.</P>
<P>The vocal talents that give life to the inhabitants of Frank are focused on
Rock, the always-amusing Hyde Pierce, TV's "Moesha" star Brandy and, as the
incumbent, corrupt mayor of the City of Frank, William Shatner. None,
however, with the exception of Drix, do much in the way of creating
memorable animated characters. The same goes for the limited live-action
cast. Murray, as always, is one funny guy and gives "disgusting" new
meaning. Wasted are Molly Shannon as Shane's teacher, Mrs. Boyd, and Chris
Elliot as Frank's sidekick and coworker, Bob. Young Elena Franklin is fine
as Frank's loving, caring daughter.</P>
<P>Animation is first rate, with a variety of settings in the human body. The
lymph nodes are the headquarters for the ever-vigilant Frank PD where
Osmosis is routinely told by his boss, the Chief, to "get out of my
office!" in typical cop show fashion. The stomach is the terminus for all
incoming nourishment while the cardiovascular system reps the highways that
the citizens of Frank use to get around. It is all very clever and
entertaining to watch, but like other aspects of the film, is not
particularly memorable.</P>
<P>The gross-out equation that permeates much of the film is obviously geared
to entertain the youngsters that "Osmosis Jones" is out to attract, and
there is plenty to gross them (and you) out. The Farrellys, with Marc
Hyman's original script, do inject some clever humor and visual cues that
are made to entertain the adults who will, inevitably, attend the film with
the kids. It's an ambitious animation effort, but lacks that certain charm
to make it remarkable work. I give it a C+.</P>
