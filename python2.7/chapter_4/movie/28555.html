<PRE>DR. DOLITTLE 2
Directed by Steve Carr
With Eddie Murphy
UA North     PG      88 min.</PRE>
<P>     There are plenty of horse laughs in Eddie Murphy's return 
engagement as John Dolittle, doctor and animal counselor.  There is also 
an environmentally-friendly plot about deforestation and endangered 
species.  Murphy himself is smooth and likeable as the zoophonic 
physician, and the animals are cute and move their lips when they talk.  
In the dog days of summer, it's hard to ask a great deal more of a 
popular comedy. </P>
<P>It certainly seems to be too much to ask for a moratorium on 
scatological humor, although Murphy, writer Larry Levin, and director 
Steve Carr show a modicum of  restraint, holding off on the heavy stuff 
for the first hour or so.  But their self-discipline only lasts so long 
before giving in to the toilet humor that has become indispensable to 
modern lowbrow comedy.  Here, at least, one of the gags does come to 
grips with the classic question of whether a bear exercises a certain 
bodily function in the woods; the answer is: not always. </P>
<P>As the picture begins, Dolittle is minding his own business, giving 
a positive-image mantra to a stray dog support group ("I am somebody's 
best friend") and dealing with his Father-Knows-Best family life when he 
is summoned by a tough-talking wiseguy raccoon (voice of Michael 
Rapaport) to a meeting with the Godbeaver (Richard C. Sarafian).  The 
beaver alerts the doctor to the rapacious activities of a logging 
company bent on clear-cutting a local forest.  There are many bits of 
information one might need animal language skills to uncover, but this 
wouldn't seem to be among them - surely environmental activists would 
have already pushed this item to the front page.  But logic is not the 
bottom line in this movie. </P>
<P>Dolittle agrees to take the case (how could he refuse), and with 
his lawyer wife (Kristin Wilson) he gets a court injunction to stop the 
logging on the grounds of irreparable harm to an endangered species - 
the Pacific Western Bear.  But there is only one such bear in this 
stretch of woods - a female (voiced by Lisa Kudrow).  To qualify as a 
savable species a mate will have to be found for her, and Dolittle 
locates one in a circus sideshow - a tap-dancing ham of a bear named 
Archie (Steve Zahn).  Trouble is, Archie has no talent or taste for the 
rustic life.  It's up to Dolittle to persuade him to take the gig, and 
then teach him how to survive in the wild and win the bear lady.</P>
<P>Levin's script relies on clever one-liners, not on story or 
consistency.  There's no follow-through on the animal mafia premise, for 
instance, and a subplot involving the emerging sexuality and 
independence of Dolittle's sixteen-year-old daughter (Raven-Symone) goes 
nowhere: a promised trip to Europe and a promising boyfriend (Lil' Zane) 
are dropped unceremoniously from the screen.  But you won't really care 
about that sappy subplot, anyway.  What makes DD2 worth while are the 
jokes, and if you like talking animals with a sense of humor (and who 
doesn't?), you'll have a good time.  Eddie Murphy has the charisma and 
comic talent to hold it all together, although for the most part his 
character here is so tamed that he seems to have moved from Mr. 
Robinson's neighborhood into Mr. Rogers's.</P>
