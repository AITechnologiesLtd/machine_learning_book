<P>A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1996 David N. Butterworth/The Summer Pennsylvanian</P>
<P>Danny DeVito's MATILDA isn't about a boxing kangaroo.  It's an adaptation
of Roald Dahl's beloved tale of a little girl with amazing powers who's
"born into a family that doesn't always appreciate her."</P>
<P>As Matilda, Mara Wilson (one of the kids in MRS. DOUBTFIRE) is predictably
annoying.  Someone must have told her once that acting means blinking a lot
and I, for one, felt sorry that they didn't cast the marsupial instead.</P>
<P>Fortunately, there's enough to like outside of the title character to make
MATILDA worthwhile.</P>
<P>Neglected by her worthless parents Harry and Zinnia Wormwood (Danny DeVito
and Rhea Perlman), Matilda is forced to feed, clothe, and educate herself
from a very early age.  By the time she's four, she's read every magazine
in the house and starts walking ten blocks to the library each day in order
to enjoy such classics as Ivanhoe, Moby Dick, and The Pickwick Papers.  She
can also do complex calculations in her head.</P>
<P>Her parents are so caught up in their tiny little lives that they barely
notice Matilda's burgeoning genius.  When Harry finds her reading novels,
he chastises her with "there's nothing you can learn from a book that you
can't learn from TV more quickly."  His idea of quality family time is
snarfing cheese doodads while watching endless game shows.</P>
<P>DeVito and Perlman are clearly having fun in their roles.  Perlman is
colorfully over-the-top as the Brooklynesque, bingo-obsessed Zinnia and
DeVito is equally excessive--and very funny--as the shady car dealer Harry,
who fails to realize Matilda's true potential.</P>
<P>Harry's booming trade in stolen auto parts interferes with this daughter's
formal education.  "Who'll sign for the packages!?" he gasps, when his
six-and-a-half year old finally asks to be sent to school.</P>
<P>But sent to school she is, to the bleak and imposing Crunchem Hall, whose
principal Agatha Trunchbull is a tyrant of monstrous proportions.  An
ex-Olympian at shot-put, hammer-throw, and javelin, Trunchbull instills
fear in the students with the crack of a riding crop, throwing these
"squirming worms of vomit," "walking pustules" and other sleights out of
windows, or locking them in the "chokey."</P>
<P>"Use the rod, beat the child" is Trunchbull's personal adage, and it's in
keeping with the school's particularly downbeat motto: "If you are having
fun, you are not learning."</P>
<P>As Trunchbull, British actress Pam Ferris offers a tour-de-force
performance.  Ferris is rarely photographed more than two inches from the
camera lens, so we get to see her blemished skin and decaying dental work
in excruciating detail, adding to her gargantuan nastiness.  There's a
nicely bitter and twisted tone in her portrayal of the brutish
headmistress.  DeVito obviously delights in the macabre--witness the black
humor in THE WAR OF THE ROSES and RUTHLESS PEOPLE--and when he revels in
the darker side of Dahl's original story, MATILDA works best.</P>
<P>Being big fans of Mary Kate and Ashley, my daughters had no problem with
Mara Wilson's acting prowess.  They liked Matilda and her sweet yet
ineffectual teacher Miss Honey (Embeth Davidtz); they laughed at the funny
bits and cowered during the scary bits; and they cheered at the ending,
when Matilda uses her phantasmagorical powers to thwart the evil
Trunchbull.</P>
<P>The caricatures of evil in the film may be one-dimensional, but they're
infinitely more fun than Matilda's forced precociousness.  If you can look
past Wilson's cloying exhibition and appreciate the supporting
performances, MATILDA is everything it should be--an enjoyable children's
fantasy.</P>
