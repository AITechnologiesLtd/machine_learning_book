<P>MANNEQUIN TWO: ON THE MOVE
Starring: Kristy Swanson, William Ragsdale, Terry Kiser,
          Stuart Pankin, and Meshach Taylor as "Hollywood"
Produced by Edward Rugoff
Directed by Stewart Raffill</P>
<P>     MANNEQUIN ON THE MOVE (which is its title; MANNEQUIN TWO was its
advertising title to let people know that this movie is a sequel) is the
story of a young prince and a peasant girl who, about one thousand years
ago, fell hopelessly in love with each other, much to the princes'
mother's dismay.  As punishment for falling in love with peasantry, the
prince's mother has a sorcerer cast a spell on the peasant girl, which
is enforced by a necklace she wears around her neck.  It cannot be
removed by anyone for a thousand years, and if she is to become human
again after that period of time, she must find true love at the end of
it.  Her story eventually becomes a legend which no one really believes,
except for the great-great-great-(and a lot of other greats) grandson of
the sorcerer, who just happens to look just like his great-great-great-
(and so on) grandfather.  The now "Enchanted Peasant Girl," who now
closely resembles a mannequin, is the center of a show for foreign
fashions at Prince & Co. (fans of the original MANNEQUIN will recognize
this store); a store at which a young man, who just happens to look
exactly like the prince the peasant girl fell in love with a thousand
years ago, is a trainee.  Hence the story.  It is really hard to
articulate the plot without making it seem ridiculous.  But that is what
it is supposed to be...ridiculous.  No one would go to see a structured,
intelligent, epic love story about a man who was a prince in a past life
and a woman who has been on ice for the last ten centuries.  Where would
be the fun in that?</P>
<P>     This movie is a formulaic, run-of-the-mill, and probably studio-
controlled movie that the studio believes the people want to see.  Since
the story is about two people who have already fallen in love, the
audience doesn't get the same feeling as the first movie, where the two
are in the process (really) of falling in love.  The first also provided
for more funny scenes, because Jonathan Switcher (Andrew McCarthy) was
the only one who could see Emmy (Kim Catrall) alive.  Everyone else saw
her as a mannequin.  In this movie, the mannequin is played by Kristy
Swanson, and she alternates between humanness and mannequinness (due to
the necklace she wears, whether it is on or off).  In the first movie,
Switcher is an unappreciated artist who finally gets a break at Prince
& Co. by getting a great job and a beautiful woman.  I got no sense of
anything like that in this movie.  I got the feeling that this movie is
just "there" for anybody that wants it.</P>
<P>     Maybe it was just me, but Kristy Swanson didn't really come across
as a woman who was transplanted from the Tenth Century into the
Twentieth.  Maybe, because of pathological Hollywood stereotyping, I was
hoping for or expecting some kind of accent (after all, she did come
from a foreign land).  Swanson is not at all hard to look at (she's very
attractive, in my humble opinion), but she did not convince me very well
that she was a foreigner in a different time and place.  I don't know if
she is a good actress or not; I've only seen her in FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY
OFF, as Simone (correct spelling?), the girl who told that history
teacher what she heard about Ferris Bueller ("My best friends' sisters'
boyfriends' brothers' girlfriend heard from this guy who knows this kid
who's going with a girl who saw Ferris pass out at 31 Flavors last
night.  I guess it's pretty serious.").  William Ragsdale was, on the
whole, average.</P>
<P>     Meshach Taylor, however, was great.  Taylor plays the character of
"Hollywood" in both films.  I loved him in the first one, and in this
one, he's toned down a little bit, but he is still as funny as ever.  I
heard somewhere that the gay community did not like the character of
"Hollywood" at all from the first film, and I think maybe that's why he
is toned down in this one, but otherwise he is hilarious.  I think he
makes the entire movie.  He gets to play another character briefly in
this one (I won't say who).  I think this is good; it shows that Meshach
Taylor doesn't just play "Hollywood."  </P>
<P>     This movie has a different director, casting agency, and three new
writers (Edward Rugoff is the fourth, and the only original writer
returning).  I have always been cautious about movies with four writers
(if one or two couldn't get it together, why should three or four);
movies of the type I mean are movies like SEE NO EVIL, HEAR NO EVIL and
TWINS, both of which had four writers.  They weren't exactly bad movies,
but they weren't that great either.  In my experience, movies with two
writers have always fared better than others, but that may just be
coincidental.  I am especially cautious of movies with overhauled film
crews (like this one).  The sequels that have done as well or better
than their predecessors have usually been the ones that bring back the
crew that made the first one successful.  When a whole new crew makes a
sequel to a successful movie, I start hearing the cries of blasphemy
from the down-trodden fans of the original.  Don't get me wrong, these
"blasphemers" occasionally do a good job, but it nevertheless makes
fans cautious.  In this movie, only a skeleton of the original crew is
present.  But as I am writing this review on the day it premieres
nationwide, I may be forced to eat my words--who knows.</P>
<P>     If I were paranoid, I would say that this movie is insulting to my
very intelligence.  But since I'm not, I'll say that this movie is just
something you can go see without having to really think about anything.
It's not that great compared to the first one, but it is not that bad
either.  It's sort of a "fuzzy carbon copy" of the first one.  If I were
to give a recommendation of some sort, I would say to go see it if for
nothing else but Meshach Taylor.  I thought he was hilarious in the
first movie, and even though he doesn't have as many funny lines in this
one, it's worth seeing just for him.  And if you liked Kristy Swanson
from the very small role she played in FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF, I'm
sure you will not be disappointed by the way she looks in this one.</P>
