<P>Tim Burton creates another fantastical world of dark imagery and
isolated characters, and douses this world of the macabre within a
wonderfully upbeat and original musical menagerie by Danny Elfman. This
Academy Award-nominated stop-motion film is geared towards children,
but could thoroughly be enjoyed by adults with youthful & darkened
imaginations as well. This film annually visits the inside of my VCR,
and should be dubbed as one of the most original and classic Halloween
stories ever told.  </P>
<P>PLOT:
Jack Skellington, is the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town. Every year, he
demonstrates his delicious capacity to deliver scares and frights to
the entire town's grotesque population, but this year, he has run bored
with his annual routine. He sets out to find something different, and
does in the town of Christmas. The lights, the joy, the happiness of
this town burn the dimmed light within Jack's head, and lead him to
attempt a Christmas parade of his own in Halloween Town. The
consequences of this blending of the holidays leads to various
misinterpretations, excitement, harmonies and hilarity.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Wonderfully dark and moody children's Halloween tale that gently stirs
all of the required elements of humour, musical charisma, children's
imagination and amazing special effects in a successful simmering pot
of entertainment. This film is filled with many wonderful images and
sounds from the wildly imaginative mind of Tim Burton, the man behind
the original BATMAN (8/10) and EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (8.5/10). The story
is as original as any one that I've ever seen for Halloween, and moves
along at an excited pace through its short running time of only 76
minutes.</P>
<P>The special effects are stunningly coordinated and surpass any Disney
animated films that I have ever seen. After a few minutes of staring at
these characters in awing disbelief, I completely fell under their
spell and in love with the personas. The musical numbers are easy to
understand and hummingly addictive (The album was nominated for a
Grammy for Best Musical Album for Children), while the dark and moody
atmosphere created in Halloween Town (Dali and Gaudi would be proud!),
is equated only by the cheery and charming ambience of Christmas Town. </P>
<P>There are elements of other Halloween tales intertwined in this
masterpiece, along with a little GRINCH WHO STOLE CHRISTMAS, but
overall, this story is truly original, and gave me a truer appreciation
of both seasons involved. Of course, Halloween has always been my
favourite holiday of the year by a long shot, but don't let that bias
sway your vote. This film should capture anyone's dormant imagination,
with its wild visuals, upbeat musical renditions, sharp and exact
imagery, and creative story. See this one with your kids, if you have
any...if you don't, rent some for the weekend, it's worth it!</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Tim Burton began drawing at an early age, going on to attend the
California Institute of the Arts, studying animation after being
awarded a fellowship from Disney, for whom he went on to work. Some of
his trademarks include films with a Gothic feel to them, plots that
often focus around a misunderstood outcast, the frequent use of
composer Danny Elfman, the featuring of dead or dismembered dogs, and
the fact that he often likes to open his films with a quiet nighttime
snowfall.
Music composer Danny Elfman has been involved with most of Tim Burton's
directorial projects (except ED WOOD (6.5/10). He also provides the
singing voice for Jack Skellington in this movie. Furthermore, Danny is
the uncle-in-law of TV's "Dharma & Greg" star Jenna Elfman. His mom is
Blossom Elfman, an author of children's books. He is also a member of
the music band Oingo Boingo (nowadays known simply as Boingo), and
wrote the score for 1994's BLACK BEAUTY for his two daughters from a
collapsed marriage. Danny's brother Richard Elfman directed the
cult-classic sci-fi musical FORBIDDEN ZONE. Danny Elfman played Satan
in that very film.
Director Henry Selick followed this effort with another stop-action
feature titled JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH, which was also produced by
Tim Burton.</P>
