<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
2 and a half stars</P>
<P>Even though it's been about twenty years since Ron Howard starred in
'Happy Days,' I still giggle after reading the words "a Ron Howard
film."  There's just something about picturing Ritchie Cunningham
directing a Hollywood blockbuster that you can't help but laugh at.
Howard's new movie EDtv will inevitably be compared to Peter Weir's film
The Truman Show, which has similar themes.  But whereas Truman focused
on a character who was oblivious to his world-wide fame as a star of his
own TV show, the protagonist in EDtv eagerly volunteers himself for a
media experiment, only to realize that perhaps it wasn't such a good
idea.  Howard has proved himself more than capable of handling heavy
material after the successes of Apollo 13 and Ransom, but here he
doesn't manage to direct with the kind of cynical detachment that made
Weir's piece succeed so well.</P>
<P>After two years worth of bad ratings, cable television channel 'True TV'
decides to try something different.  Headed by program director Cynthia
Topping (Ellen DeGeneres), they plan to create a show that follows, for
24 hours a day, the life of an average Joe.  Enter Ed Pekurny (Matthew
McConaughey), who is the perfect loser they are looking for.  Thus,
'EDtv' is born.  Sure enough, a camera crew follows Ed everywhere he
goes, and it doesn't take long before Ed's life becomes a lot more
complicated.  Trouble arises when he catches his brother Ray (Woody
Harrelson) having an affair on national TV, which leaves Ray's
girlfriend Shari (Jenna Elfman) predictably furious.  Shari and Ed are
attracted to each other and carve a relationship of their own, whilst
Ed's long-lost father Hank (Dennis Hopper) arrives on the scene and
causes domestic problems with Ed's flamboyant mother Janette (Sally
Kirkland).</P>
<P>If cameras didn't follow Ed everywhere, I'd swear that this was just
another average drama.  At least that's the way that Howard approaches
his material; instead of focusing on the media's influence on society,
he merely gives a twist to a typical domestic story.  Most frustrating
in his direction is his lack of attention to interesting themes.  When
Ed experiences his fifteen minutes of fame, it's clear that he is no
longer an average citizen, and thus 'True TV' loses the very thing that
made it so popular - its ability to follow an ordinary, fame-less
citizen.  But the 'True TV' executives are just as oblivious to this as
Howard is.  He obviously wanted to keep the film simplistic and able to
succeed on its own entertaining merits, thus much intrigue is lost.</P>
<P>Edtv consistently tries to persuade its audience that Ed is a character
who deserves to be barracked for.  Matthew McConaughey mouths his
dialogue with the kind of Southern American simplicity that quickly
becomes irritating, and although there is nothing drastically wrong with
his performance, the film's script doesn't have the strength to support
him.  Ed succeeds as a likeable nice guy, but hardly somebody who will
have you cheering in the aisles (unlike Truman, who's portrayal by Jim
Carrey made him impossible not to like).</P>
<P>EDtv is entertaining and sometimes quite funny - after all, this is A
Ron Howard Film.  But the media-induced world in which the film's
characters revolve in is not the unrelentingly cold world we know.  The
only time I was truly engaged by EDtv was near its completion, when Ed
realizes the horror of being stripped of privacy.  This diminishes, of
course, into an expected happy ending in which everybody departs the set
smiling, but most cinema-goers will leave only with a taste of what
could have been.  EDtv is largely an ineffective film that is hard to
hate but easy to forget.  Not bad for entertainment value, but don't
look for anything profound in Howard's light-hearted direction.</P>
