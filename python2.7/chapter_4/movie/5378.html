<P>     This sometimes-tedious and often-moving documentary charts the life
and times of Anne Frank, the young diarist and most-famous victim of
Adolph Hitler.  Writer/director/producer Jon Blair has collected a
staggering amount of historical material on both Anne and the Frank
family.  We meet Miep Gies, one of the family's protectors who is still
alive.  She recounts how she found the diary in the days after the
Germans captured the Franks.  We watch Otto Frank, Anne's father and
surviving family member, in interview footage filmed before his death.
Blair successfully combines these clips, footage, and other historical
records to recount exactly what happened during that terrible period of
European history.  As narrated by Kenneth Branagh and with diary excepts
read by Glenn Close, ANNE FRANK REMEMBERED retells more than just Anne's
story.  We meet and learn about the *many* friends, family members, and
acquaintances whose lives were touched by this young woman and her
writings.  Winner of the last year's Academy Award for Best Documentary.</P>
