<PRE>                               HEAR MY SONG
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>100 min., R, Drama , 1991
Director: Peter Chelsom
Cast: Ned Beatty, Adrian Dunbar, Shirley-Anne Field, Tara Fitzgerald,
      William Hootkins, David McCallum</P>
<P>     Adrian Dunbar is going to be evicted from the building where his
club is located.  He promises the landlords that he is going to get
Irish tenor Ned Beatty to sing at the club, and they let him stay open.
Instead of Beatty, Dunbar ends up with an impersonator.  Dunbar loses
the club, his girlfriend Tara Fitzgerald, and his friends.  He sets out
on a voyage to Ireland to try to locate Beatty so he can get Fitzgerald
back.</P>
<P>     HEAR MY SONG is a wonderful film, is well written and beautifully
filmed.  It is well worth going to see if it comes to a theater near
you.  Personally, this film didn't sound the most interesting to me, but
it was playing as a double feature to the other film I went to see, so I
figured I might as well watch this film too.  I was surprised at how
much I liked it.  On a scale of zero to five, I give HEAR MY SONG a
four.  It is rated R for female nudity, adult situations, and explicit
language.</P>
<P>     The locations used for this film were great.  The Irish country
side where Beatty was living looked beautiful.  Ned Beatty, who is
really starting to get old (53, I think) did a great job, even though he
didn't do his own singing.  Some opera singer, I think, did all of the
singing for him.  Dunbar, who I don't think I have ever seen before in
the movies, did a wonderful job and has a potential in movies, at least
in alternative cinema.  Tara Fitzgerald, although she wasn't on the
screen very much, did a memorable performance.  The rest of the
supporting cast also did a great job.</P>
<P>     The film was interesting.  I fully enjoyed watching it and never
got bored.  This is alternative cinema almost at its best.   I highly
suggest that if you have not yet seen this film that you attempt to.  I
don't think that you will be disappointed.  I certainly wasn't.  I feel
that this film should have gotten more exposure than it did.  At least
in my area it only played for four days, and I don't think that that was
near enough time.  I feel that this film probably would have done very
well at a mainstream theater which would have allowed more people to see
it.</P>
