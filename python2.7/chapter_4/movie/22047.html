<PRE>LIGHT IT UP
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<PRE>Excess.</PRE>
<P>Too often writer/directors such as LIGHT IT UP's Craig Bolotin don't
take the time to create a plausible plot and realistic dialog.  Instead,
they go for exaggeration and hope for audiences who don't care.</P>
<P>LIGHT IT UP opens with an inner city high school that could be a poster
school for more government aid.  A few of its deficiencies would be
credible, but the litany goes on way pass the level of plausibility.
Water drips from the ceiling onto the students' papers, smearing the
ink.  As the kids shiver in heavy coats and knit caps, snow blows into
their classroom from the windows that have been broken for months.  Not
seeming to have the usual dropout problem, this school has classes that
are standing room only because of a lack of chairs.  And when the
teacher moves the class off campus to the local coffee shop in order to
find a warmer environment, an ex-student with a shotgun assaults the
class.</P>
<P>Some of the students go to complain to the principal about the temporary
suspension of the their favorite teacher, Mr. Knowles (Judd Nelson from
THE BREAKFAST CLUB, after which, according to the press notes, the
movie's casting was modeled.)  Officer Jackson (Forest Whitaker) is
called in to take them away.  He's the school's in-house cop, whom the
narrator describes as "a $5 cop with a $50 attitude."</P>
<P>In the hall, there's an accident.  After a whirlwind of events, the
officer ends up being shot in the leg by one of the kids.  It is after
this that the story goes seriously awry.</P>
<P>Six students unbelievably barricade the school and hold the officer
hostage.  They issue a short series of demands over the Internet by
spamming news organizations worldwide.  (They may not have books, but
they have the right computer equipment and savvy.)  These demands
include books, an annual career day and the right to test their teachers
every month.</P>
<P>Rather than having just bad kids risk getting shot at by the army of
cops who quickly surround the building, the story has some model
students being stupid enough to take part in such a guaranteed loser of
a situation.</P>
<P>Basketball star Lester Dewitt (Usher Raymond) becomes the leader of the
group.  Stephanie Williams (Rosario Dawson), the most implausible of
all, is a future doctor, who is on the national dean's list.  Why she
doesn't just walk out at the beginning, as most of the other students
do, is never properly explained.  Other students include a
self-described "slag," who recently got pregnant by a guy because she
wanted him to kiss her.  She seems too bored to walk out.</P>
<P>Although there are lots of threats with a gun, the script will soon
teach us that it's not the kids' fault.  One turns out to be an abused
child, and another has a dead father, whom the police recently killed
without provocation.</P>
<P>After setting up the unbelievable situation, the story basically runs
out of gas and ends.  The ending, of course, is a dramatic confrontation
with the police, followed by a sentimental epilogue.  If the writer had
taken the time to create characters rather than caricatures, perhaps we
could have cared.  As it is, we're just glad that it's over with.  The
windows do get repaired, but the movie leaves us in doubt about whether
the students will get their career day or not.</P>
<P>LIGHT IT UP runs 1:40.  It is rated R for language and violent content
and would be acceptable for older teens.</P>
