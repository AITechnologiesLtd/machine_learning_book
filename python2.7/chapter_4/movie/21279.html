<P>Apparently, while Billy Crystal spends all of his free time tying to
figure out how to work the names of all five `Best Picture' nominees
into an irritating song and dance number, he has his mongoloid nephew
read scripts and recommend projects for him.  Note to Billy – IT'S OVER!</P>
<P>In his latest big screen blunder, Crystal (Father's Day) stars as an
unsuccessful New York talent agent named Sammy.  He currently has but
one client, an annoying pre-pubescent douche bag that is currently
filming a `Crusades' picture in Romania.  After travelling around the
world to the location, Sammy in unceremoniously dumped by the little
brat.  Why he had to go there at all, I will never know.</P>
<P>Thankfully, Sammy gets into a car wreck, but he doesn't die.  In fact,
he is saved by a seven-and-a-half foot glandular case named Max (NBA
star Gheorge Muresan).  The giant lives with a bunch of monks because
the townsfolk call him mean names.  These monks are the kind that don't
talk.  Or maybe they're the kind of monks who just don't talk in front
of Billy Crystal because they were raised to not say anything if they
can't say anything nice.  I do think there was one in the background
giggling about Mr. Saturday Night.</P>
<P>Anyway, Max drags Sammy back to his lair (which oddly resembles
Crystal's home in The Princess Bride) and prattles on and on about his
long lost love who moved to Gallop, New Mexico.  He even has stacks and
stacks of letters that he has written to her.  Why they are still in his
possession, I will never know.</P>
<P>Not the type of guy to pass up the exploitation of a big stupid freak,
Sammy talks Max into becoming a movie star as well as an opportunity to
reunite with his beloved.  This Max is some actor.  His dopey grin and
cross-eyed blank stare make Andrew Shue look like an acting great.
Although he is a better screen presence than Shaq and Michael Jordan,
Muresan still makes my want to bash something apart with some type of
power tool.</P>
<P>Here's an idea – when you make a movie about a big tall guy, how about
showing him in places that normal people find cramped.  Max gets to go
on an airplane and in a cab, but we don't get to see either.  I would
have loved to have seen him crushing his Frankenstein head into the
overhead compartment or try to use the bathroom.  Something…anything.
Instead, My Giant's script is loosely held together by one of the
greatest vomiting scenes in history.</P>
<P>Or here is an even better story – instead of helping Sammy, Max eats
him.  He still becomes a big movie star and even gets to present an
award at the Oscars.  Instead of reading the names of the nominees, Max
pulls down his pants and craps out Sammy, who burst into a song and
dance number.  Jesus, I've got to write a script.  All I need is the
address for Billy's nephew.</P>
