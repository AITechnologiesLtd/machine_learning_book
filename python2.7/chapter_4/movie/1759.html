                       A film review by Michael Stoneheel
                        Copyright 1993 Michael Stoneheel</PRE>
<P>Director: Brian De Palma
Cast: Michael Caine, Angie Dickinson, Nancy Allen, Keith Gordon
Released in 1980.</P>
<P>     A sexually active woman is brutally murdered.  Her son, a hooker
who was a witness to the murder and the victim's psychiatrist are
looking for the killer.  The main characters cope with terror, fear,
violence and sex until the mystery is solved.</P>
<P>     Brian De Palma is usually being accused of borrowing his ideas from
Alfred Hitchcock.  Using such opinions, this film is a mixture of a
Hitchcock suspense film and an erotic horror movie.  Personally, I think
that De Palma was also influenced by several realistic directors and by
Louis Bunuel.  Violence and sex are being used as the surface of the
film.  In a higher level De Palma is looking for the connection between
the senses and our behavior.  Aesthetically, the film is focused on the
relation between what we see and what we think and feel.  I will
describe two scenes to clarify my ideas.</P>
<P>     On the first scene, Angie Dickinson is sitting near a stranger in a
museum.  She desires him but in the same time she fears to approach him.
This common conflict is being illustrated by the way she looks at the
world.  When she wants the stranger she glances at him, and then she
immediately turns her head to the other direction.  After he is gone,
she is determined to find him.  She tries to follow him and looks at
every direction.  When she finally finds him in a position she wasn't
expected him to be, she decides to forget the whole thing.  The scene
continues in the same manner and the spectators see exactly what the
woman see, and also the expressions on her face.  The simple
interpretation of feelings and thoughts is due to the crucial importance
of the sense of sight in our lives.  In fact, what wee see is what we
think and vice versa.</P>
<P>     On the second scene, the hooker explains the boy how to perform a
sex conversion.  On the background several women conduct their own
discussion.  Every time the hooker completes a sentence, the first woman
on the background says yes to a woman we cannot see.  The second woman
on the background seems to catch on some of the hooker words, and she
reacts in a wide expression of shocking and surprise.  The difference
between both reactions makes this situation funny for the spectator who
understands that the sight of the background can be misleading.</P>
<P>     Although DRESSED TO KILL combines several styles, the film is
essentially realistic.  Except from the realistic sex and violence
scenes, De Palma has used several cinematography methods.  The
tremendous use of slow panning shots increases the importance of vision
and gives the audience more time to look at things and to respond by
creating emotions.  Another interesting method is the splitting of the
screen into two simultaneous scenes.  As a result, the spectator has to
choose what to see (It has the same realistic effect as deep-focus
shots).  The nightmares in the film are so real that it is not clear if
they are dreams or just thoughts.</P>
<P>     In the film, life is consisted of sights, thoughts, feelings and
nightmares which are being summed up to sex, violence and love.  Due to
the relations between feelings and visions, the spectator can reach a
better understanding by looking at things from "within the scene".  As a
result, the spectator becomes another participant in the film.  In my
opinion, a perfect harmony between the theme, aesthetics and
metaphysics along with excellent cinematography and acting turned into
a true masterpiece.</P>
