<P>     At the core of SCENES FROM A MALL there is both emptiness and a
saturation of movie references.  At the edges is a film connoisseur's
loving tribute to mostly European cinemasters.  This makes it more a
work for film historians than for seekers of movie entertainment.</P>
<P>     SCENES FROM A MALL is in effect a one-act, two-character play.
Nick and Deborah Fifer are a Beverly Hills couple preparing to
celebrate their 16th wedding anniversary, which coincides with the
Christmas season.  Woody Allen is a lawyer for sports figures looking
to endorse products.  Bette Midler is a trendy psychiatrist and
writer.</P>
<P>     A prologue offers us unsexy bedroom cavorting, movie-banal with
its interruptions by their his and hers telephones.  The couple's
passion, unconvincing and unappealing, is further undermined by the
camera's insistence on closeups of their decidedly un-Adonis and
un-Venus looks.</P>
<P>     The script keeps hammering us with dates in order to convince us
that both Nick and Debbie are 40.  In fact, in 1991, Midler was 45 and
Allen 55.  (Curiously, they were both born on December 1st).</P>
<P>     As Nick and Debbie drive to a mall to pick up their holiday
presents, there are some mildly satirical scenes of affluent Angelenos
stalled in traffic and using their cellular phones.  At the vast
shopping center, for unexplored reasons, Nick blurts out that he's had
an affair (it was over yesterday, at 4:30PM).  Soon after Debbie
'fesses up that she too has been carrying on with an older Czech
colleague .</P>
<P>     In a tour of upscale stores and ethnic eateries, the couple
fight, talk of money and divorce, reminisce, make up, clash
again, argue keep blowing hot and cold.  The camera persists in its
unflattering photography.  A mime (Bill Irwin) keeps hounding the
twosome as a diversion unjustified and unsupported by the script.</P>
<P>     With a bare minimum of other speaking parts, the supporting cast
is one of extras used as background decor notably several gorgeous
younger shoppers who contrast with the couple's homeliness.</P>
<P>Motivations are unclear, the tension is artificial, the dialogue 
uninteresting, the principals uninvolving and miscast, in spite of 
sporadic jokes, gags and one-liners.  Woody Allen the actor cries out for 
Allen the writer-director, He can act much better than this.  Back in 
1976 he had done superbly in THE FRONT, directed by the late Martin 
Ritt and scripted by Walter Bernstein. </P>
<P>     Of some interest to specialists are Paul Mazursky's peripherals.
Mazursky's filmic characteristic is to cook American meat with
European sauces.  His attraction to Continental cinema is enormous.  To
mention but two cases, the early ALEX IN WONDERLAND is imitation
Fellini, with young film director Donald Sutherland hounding the Italian
master; DOWN AND OUT IN BEVERLY HILLS is a remake of BOUDU SAUVE DES
EAUX (BOUDU SAVED FROM DROWNING), one of Jean Renoir's several
French classics of the 1930s.</P>
<P>     In the French New Wave of the 1960's, references to other films
were endemic.  In SCENES FROM A MALL too.  Among them, the traffic jam
just has to come from films by Fellini, Antonioni, Tati and Godard;
Allen is constantly lugging a banana-like surfboard--a cumbersome
phallic symbol of the Blake Edwards school and a reminder of Allen's
film BANANAS; a tacky Auguste Renoir mural in the mall refers to the
painter's son, Jean Renoir; a bench scene may well have been inspired
by Alain Resnais' HIROSHIMA MON AMOUR; the mime's provenance is
Marcel Carne's CHILDREN OF PARADISE.</P>
<P>     I'll say this much at least, that Mazurky's choices are most
eclectic and his devotion to great directors is touching.</P>
<P>     Less esoterically, this movie is kind of perverse upending of
Ingmar Bergman's SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE, combined with Paul Bartel's
SCENES FROM THE CLASS STRUGGLE IN BEVERLY HILLS, in which Mazursky
had a part.  And more blatantly, Nick and Debbie, for no good reason,
watch SALAAM BOMBAY in a mall theatre and make love, in contrast to
sad scenes on the screen.  The only audience is our sick couple and a
couple of shushing Sikhs.</P>
<P>     Those film games are cute but unintegrated.  Better woven in is
the real/symbolic soullessness of the mall and its horrid pre-fab
modernism, sterility and anonymous promiscuity.  Or the ethnic
restaurant with a Mexican-garbed waitress--a tired, middle-aged
Wasp--and deafening Mariachis who prevent the couple from talk about
splitting their assets.</P>
<P>     Potentially good is the use of music, from the opening credits of
Marlene Dietrich singing Cole Porter's " You Do Something To Me," to
more Porter ("Let's Do It," "Easy To Love"), to Louis Armstrong or the
Nino Rota scores for Fellini's AMARCORD and JULIET OF THE SPIRITS.
But again, those tuneful references come closer to nostalgia for people
of Mazurky's (or Allen's) background and generation than to anything
substantial.</P>
<P>     With its spot-the-source game, SCENES FROM A MALL does have, for
film buffs, a certain appeal, nostalgia and the shock of recognition.
But for seekers of originality as well as the general public, this work
is neither fish nor fowl, neither fresh nor foul.  Mostly it feels like
a set of unfinished ideas.</P>
<P>     Still, seen again, it is rather more interesting than the first
time, and does not quite deserve the critical lambasting it received
when it came out in 1991.</P>
