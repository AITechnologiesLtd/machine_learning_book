American Pie (1999) 3 stars out of  4. Starring Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, 
Thomas Ian Nicholas, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Eugene Levy, Mena Survari, Tara 
Reid, Natasha Lyonne and Alyson Hannigan.</P>
<P> In the telling, American Pie may sound like a semi-gross adolescent sex 
comedy.</P>
<P> In truth, though, it is a rather engaging and likable feature film that 
at times nudges the gangplank of bad taste without diving overboard.</P>
<P> The story is simple: Four high school seniors  all virgins  make a 
pact to lose their virginity by the time of the senior prom.</P>
<P> The quartet are basically all types: Jim (Jason Biggs) is the nerdy guy; 
Oz (Chris Klein) is the jock; Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) is the smooth 
one who already has a girlfriend; and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) is the 
brain.</P>
<P> Enough hormones are raging among these four to generate the heat needed 
to evaporate the Great Lakes.</P>
<P> The pleasure of American Pie is that despite it being a comedy, it 
convincingly covers the angst and awkwardness most young men experience 
when trying to connect with the young females of the species.</P>
<P> It's all here: the false bravado, the exaggerations concerning size and 
prowess, the lies about previous trysts. The boys all set out to find 
dates/potential partners for prom night.</P>
<P> Jim's plans go awry when the Romanian exchange student who shows 
interest in him is deported. This sequence, the funniest in the movie, 
involves some graphic magazines, the Internet and a most appreciative 
audience of peers and classmates.         </P>
<P> Oz joins an a cappella jazz ensemble where he meets Heather (an ethereal 
Mena Suvari), who begins to transform him into a caring and sensitive 
all-around person. </P>
<P> Finch hires a classmate to begin spreading rumors about him, while Kevin 
uses "the Bible" to learn how to please his girlfriend, Vicky (Tara 
Reid), and prepare them for the perfect night in which they will finally 
consummate their romance. </P>
<P> Credit for American Pie should go to screenwriter Adam Herz. In his 
initial screenplay, Herz shows a definite ear for the rhythms, mores and 
attitudes of contemporary high school students.</P>
<P> The one area in which he falls short is the privacy issue. No one locks 
their doors. Show me one teen who hasn't installed a dead bolt or 
trained a watch dog to keep intruders out of his or her room.</P>
<P> Director Paul Weitz keeps the film moving at a brisk pace. And while not 
every sequence pays off, there are no dead spaces. Even the throwaway 
scenes involving Jim and his dad, a funny, trying-to-be-hip Eugene Levy, 
are witty and a bit touching. </P>
<P> American Pie is a fine ensemble comedy. The entire cast deserves high 
marks: Klein, who played a similar character earlier this year in 
Election, is touching; Biggs, as the sympathetic Jim, is klutzy, but 
endearing; Nicholas shows a vulnerability and an awakening 
self-awareness; while Thomas is a bit cynical, yet as wanting as the 
others.</P>
<P> Also worth noting are the contributions of Natasha Lyonne as the 
frank-speaking Jessica, Vicky's best friend; and Alyson Hannigan as 
Michelle, the band-geek from hell who surprises the pants off Jim.</P>
<P> Since this is a teen comedy, American Pie does have some raunchy 
moments, but overall it is a warm, pleasant outing about the travails of 
growing up. It's fun and a bit wise, but without being preachy. </P>
