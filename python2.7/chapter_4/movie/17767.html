<PRE>Analyze This…</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Harold Ramis</PRE>
<P>Starring Robert DeNiro, Billy Crystal, Lisa Kudrow, and Chazz Plamantari</P>
<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>     We've seen it before.  We've seen Bobby DeNiro as a gangster in
Godfather, Part II, in countless Martin Scorcese films, as Al Capone in The
Untouchables.  But, what we haven't seen before is the humor.  Never before
has Robert DeNiro tried to parody himself, to make fun of his own standards
and stereotypes.  Sure, we don't get a parody of the monologue from Taxi
Driver (`You talkin' to me?'), but we get a steady does of mob film spoofs,
including a shot-by-shot parody of The Godfather.</P>
<P>     Harold Ramis takes the helm of this risky project about the original
risky business.  Paul Viti (Robert DeNiro) is a mobster with issues.  His
best friend has just been killed, and, to be honest, he's conflicted about
being his harsh old self.  He's having panic attacks, he's not willing to
beat information out of someone.  Let's face it, it's crimpin his style.
So, taking advantage of  a run-in (literally, Billy Crystal hits the back of
a sedan with a person on his way to be killed in it) with psychiatrist Ben
Sobol, he starts going to a shrink.</P>
<P>     Sobol is just your garden-variety shrink, leaning a little too much
towards the `Fraiser' side.  His son's a smart Alec, his fiancée (Kudrow) is
a bimbo.  He listens to the problems of neurotics all day long.  Of course,
when a gangster steps in the door, everything changes.</P>
<P>     Viti starts following him everywhere.  He becomes his only client
because he need to have a therapeutic breakthrough before a meeting of the
heads of all the families in two weeks.</P>
<P>     The fact is, though, that we have seen this before.  This was the plot
of The Don's Analyst, with Robert Loggia.  It's also the plot of the HBO
Series The Sopranos.  However, Analyze This… does it's job much better than
The Don's Analyst, which was dry and unfunny, ever could.</P>
<P>     Despite the fact that the script was plagued by last-minute rewrites
and a director who's only product that I've seen and respected was the
moderately creative (although now hackneyed) Groundhog's Day, it actually
doesn't seem as openly contrived.  It does its job: mix humor with a serious
plot fairly well, and it's fun to see Robert DeNiro break into tears at a
Prudential commercial.  Robert DeNiro, too, does his job.  He turns out a
performance that's good… for him, a man who has won two academy awards and
is one of America's finest living actors.</P>
<P>     The real disappointment in the film, despite a lack of originality in
plot is Billy Crystal.  Crystal turns out a lackluster performance as the
psychiatrist, and seems to merely sit around and be glad he landed a role
with DeNiro at all.  He delivers a few good scenes, such as the one where he
tries to act like the consillieri.  Lisa Kurdrow also does a good job as the
bimbo fiancée.</P>
<P>     As I've said, there aren't that many holes in the script.  One little
thing that bothers me is that, considering how much Kudrow seems to hate
Crystal, she ends up with everything honky-dory with him at the end.  Once
again, idiotic characters are constructed, but that's the price that is paid
for a funny movie, and it is a funny movie.</P>
<P>     Analyze This… isn't really quality cinema, but it's fun.  It's fun to
see people parody themselves.  It's fun to watch someone admit that they've
been doing to same part for so long (albeit, doing it great).  It's also fun
to watch this film, and is one definitely worth heading out to the theatre
to see.</P>
