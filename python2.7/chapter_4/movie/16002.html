<P>"The Celebration" is one of an elite kind of films that is completely
absorbant.  You know, where you sit down to watch it, and no matter what
you've heard about it before, you just can't help but be totally drawn
into its story and shocked by every single turn that occurs.  I prefer
films like these because these are what the best kind of films are
like.  I don't really feel there are to be any real "rules" for cinema;
a film can do anything, as long as it makes it work.  But I do ask that
all films have one thing in common: they create experiences.  When I
watch a film, no matter what kind of film it is, I want to be able to
take certain memories along with me.  "The Celebration" is great because
it's chock full of those.  It creates a world so completely realistic
that everything that occurs is as memorable as the little instances of
life that catch your attention and stay with you for the rest of your
life.  And then it makes things just a tad bit farscial, just to make
sure you're paying attention, which you are because what transpires is
just so goddam interesting that if you were to ever feel bored, then
you're of your attention span needs a bit of a tuning-up.</P>
<P>The story takes place at the extravagant home of an aging patriarch
(Henning Mortizen), who has just turned 60 and is having a party thrown
for him.  All his friends and family turn up, and for the first half
hour, we get introduced to everyone, simplistically and realistically
(no aggravatingly condescending posing for the camera deals here).  The
eldest son, Christian (Ulrich Thomsen, looking a bit like a young
Malcolm McDowell), is the first to be seen in the film, walking to his
father's home.  His brother, Michael (Thomas Bo Larsen), drives by,
pulls over, greets him, then kicks his family out of the car, forcing
them to walk to the estate, just so Christian can be comfortable.  We
then meet Helene (Paprika Steen), their sister, a woman who always seems
to be stressed-out, who invites the driver of her car (Gbatokai
Dakinah), an American, to to come join her at the party she's going to.</P>
<P>Once they're all there and settled in, the party begins, and as custom,
the eldest son has to make a speech to his dad, so Christian stands up,
at the head of the table, and reveals the film's punchline: his father
raped all his children at a young age.  But since this is a
family/friends affair, his confession becomes more detested than the
supposed truth, and is simply brushed off despite his efforts, and what
transpires is sorta like Jerry Springer crossed with Jean Renoir, and
it's all terribly interesting to watch.  Twists occur, and soon the film
has taken on a nearly-farsical nature, but still seems realistic because
the people involved really feel like they could reach such ends.</P>
<P>The most notorious thing about this film, which has been getting the
most notice, though, is that the director, Thomas Vinterberg has shot it
in a completely awkward fashion.  As a member of the Danish filmmakers
clan, Dogme 95, a group that has vowed to oppose "the auteur concept,
make-up, illusions, and dramaturgical predictability" so that they may
"purge film so that once again the inner lives of the characters justify
the plot."  I have not seen "Breaking the Waves," the other notable film
by a member of this group (Lars Von Trier, to be exact), but "The
Celebration" works exquisitely in this department.  It feels like
reality, like you're actually watching real people and not actors, and
as a major pointer, has been shot on video.  As a result, it looks more
like the home movies you never dare shot of your family than an actual
film, but always wanted to.  We see key moments in people's lives that
they wouldn't dare show to the world, and it captures the farscial
comedy of life so accurately and acutely that this style, as
ironically-showmanship as it really is, works perfectly for the nature
of the film.</P>
<P>The key, though, to this film, and the reason it's not just a cool
Danish import, is because this film is not about revealing the truth as
much as it is about the way people react to such an explosive truth.
Throughout the film, we see a completely realized debate over the truth
and the effects it has on the lives of those who have learned to live
with lies, a debate so three-dimensional that it could easily blow
Oliver Stone and his the-truth-at-all-costs reasoning out of the water.
Of course it was not right for the father to rape his children, and of
course, they couldn't have fought back then, and of course this has
created scarring suppression inside them.  And yes, it's thearapeutic
for one to release the truth years later, when they know it could easily
destroy the one who emotionally destroyed them earlier.  But then again,
the father, after all, is not a totally bad guy, and we can see the
emotional complications that arise thanks to a performance by Mortizen
which is just so great and touching that while we do believe that he
could have raped his children years earlier, we also see a man who has
also learned to live with what he's done, and deep down, feels true
guilt that is only now beginning to surface.  The final scene, involving
Mortizen and everyone else, is utterly devastating, thanks to him and
Thomsen, whose performance is utterly flawless and equally emotionally
complex.</P>
<P>Everyone else is flawless as well - the actors never seem to be stepping
into the shoes of their characters as much as they do walking
comfortably in them.  The actors or writers have not made the mistake to
judge these characters in the slightest: there are no whites or blacks
but instead all grays, exactly like life.  As such, "The Celebration"
may be the one truly bizarro film of the year: a work of art so eerily
close to reality that it's utterly disturbing and utterly fascinating.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ****</PRE>
