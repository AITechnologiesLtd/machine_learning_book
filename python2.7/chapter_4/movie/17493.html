<PRE>_The_Mod_Squad_ (R) * (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>My memories of TV super-producer Aaron Spelling's original late '60s-early
'70s action series are fuzzy at best.  I don't think I've ever seen a full
episode, but I do recall the image of three young, cool cops running
together in pursuit of a perp.  I may not know much, but I know this: the
new big screen revival of the series sure as hell isn't how I remember it.</P>
<P>The new _Mod_Squad_ is a study in how a surefire idea gets botched in the
execution.  The premise of having a group of three young ex-crooks--Julie
Barnes (Claire Danes), Linc Hayes (Omar Epps), and Pete Cochrane (Giovanni
Ribisi)--do undercover police work is a concept ripe for updating.  But any
high hopes are just about immediately let down, then wiped out completely
in one early scene where the three talk in a car.  Sounds simple enough,
but Danes, Epps, and Ribisi show no group chemistry whatsoever.  Some squad
this is--and for reasons known only to Silver and co-writers Stephen Kay
and Kate Lanier, they spend most of the film in individual plot threads.</P>
<P>Individually, though, these actors have problems of their own.  Danes is a
good enough sport, but she appears somewhat ill-at-ease in this, her first
popcorn movie.  Ribisi's Pete is only slightly more intelligent than his
character in _The_Other_Sister_, and his portrayal is every bit as grating.
 The only one who appears the slightest bit in place is Epps, but he
literally runs through the film.  In fact, those running scenes are all
that in-over-his-head director Scott Silver (whose only other film was the
low-budget indie drama _johns_) tries to pass off as action in this talky,
terrible film.  After the one-two failed franchise punch of this and
_The_Rage:_Carrie_2_, MGM is once again left to wait for James Bond to
rescue them with his next, certain-to-be-a-blockbuster adventure, due in
November.</P>
