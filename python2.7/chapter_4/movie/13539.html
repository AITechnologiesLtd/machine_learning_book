<PRE>The Mask of Zorro (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 44</PRE>
<P>"The Mask of Zorro" is action-packed escapist fun,
perhaps a guilty pleasure for some, but it is
too shallow and ridiculous to be considered a good
movie.</P>
<P>"The Mask of Zorro" begins in California in the
year 1820, when it was still a Spanish possession.
Anthony Hopkins is Zorro, masked action hero by day,
aristocrat by night.  Governor and bad-guy Stuart
Wilson learns Hopkins' identify, and jails him,
for good measure killing his wife and kidnapping
his infant daughter.</P>
<P>Twenty years later, Hopkins escapes from prison,
and being too old for the role, instructs enthusiastic
bandit Antonio Banderas to take his place as
Zorro.  Banderas' brother has been killed by
Matthew Letscher, who is Wilson's right-hand man.
Meanwhile, Wilson has a plan of buying California
from Mexico, with gold extracted via slave labor from
a local mine.  Hopkins seeks revenge on Wilson, Banderas
seeks revenge on Letscher, and Banderas romances
Catherine Zeta Jones, who is Hopkins' now-adult
daughter.</P>
<P>What can be said that is positive about "Zorro"?
The sets are excellent, especially the mine.
The costumes are very good, and the endless action
scenes are well choreographed.  Zeta Jones is
beyond beautiful, and the cast is energetic.</P>
<P>So, why isn't "The Mask of Zorro" (not to be confused
with "The Mark of Zorro", the silent epic starring
Douglas Fairbanks Sr.) a good movie?  It's all action
and no thought.  The film is riddled with little problems.
I'll just describe a few of them.</P>
<P>Hopkins spends twenty years in prison.  The day Wilson
returns from Spain and pays a visit looking for Zorro
is the very day that Hopkins decides to escape.  Well,
if it was so easy, why didn't he break out twenty
years earlier?</P>
<P>Both Hopkins and Banderas can fight multiple swordsmen
at once.  They can also outrun bullets.  But when
the duel their enemies one-on-one, they can barely
hold their own.  Hopkins and Wilson have numerous
opportunities to kill each other, but don't.  It is
almost as if they prefer the other to stay alive,
so as to make their own life more interesting.</P>
<P>Hopkins trains Banderas to be not merely a great
swashbuckler and acrobat, but a gentleman as well.
He must be a great teacher, since Banderas learns
it all in just a few scenes.  It took Professor Higgins
an entire three-hour movie to train Eliza Doolittle.</P>
<P>Jones is a big fan of Zorro, and espouses pro-peasant
attitudes, despite being raised by despot Wilson.
It is amazing to me, but not to the writers, that
she never takes her father's side, and falls for
Zorro immediately.</P>
<P>Scenes typical of a Zorro movie, such as hapless soldiers
fumbling in an attempt to catch Zorro, Zorro swinging
from convenient ropes and chandeliers like Tarzan,
and jumping two stories onto a stationary horse
(Wouldn't that break the horse's back?  Wouldn't that
cause an, um, groin injury?) are present.  It is
probably impossible to make a great movie about Zorro,
(or Godzilla, or Batman, for that matter) unless it
is done as a parody, such as was done in "Zorro, the Gay
Blade" some years back.</P>
