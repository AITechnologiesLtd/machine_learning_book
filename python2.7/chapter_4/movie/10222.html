<PRE>AMISTAD (1997)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Copyright 1997 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>James Berardinelli pointed it out best, Spielberg's Schindler's List is to
Jurassic Park what Amistad is to Lost World. I hope that this is a short
cycle for Spielberg, because the first cycle was a lot stronger than this
second one. Jurassic Park was a lot more fun than Lost World, and
Schindler's List is a lot stronger than Amistad. If this is a cycle for
Spielberg it looks as if the cycle is getting weaker.</P>
<P>This is not to say that Amistad is not a great movie, it's just not as
great as Schindler's List. Amistad is a good movie that stands not on its
plot and story but on the performances of its leads; Djimon Hounsou,
Matthew McConaughey, Anthony Hopkins, and to a lesser extend Morgan Freeman.</P>
<P>Spielberg opens the film with a harrowing sequence on how slaves take over
the ship that they are being shipped on, La Amistad. The sequence is very
graphic and shows clearly the feelings of the slaves towards those who have
taken them slave. After this the slaves try to sail the ship back to their
home country with the help of the captain. They though end up in
Connecticut where groups of different people, with different agendas, argue
about the "ownership" of these slaves. This includes the Prime Minister
from Spain representing the prepubescent Queen -- in which Spielberg
handles with some good humour and irony. But the real fight is between the
Attorney General of the United States and a small time properties lawyer
Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey). The Attorney General is fighting on "behalf"
of the United States and Spain. The current President at the time wants to
avert a civil war from this situation and in doing so also make Spain
happy. Baldwin wants to set the slaves free after he befriends one of them,
Cinque (Djimon Hounsou) the leader of the group.</P>
<P>Anthony Hopkins, starring as former President John Quincy Adams, has a
small introduction in the beginning and then is forgotten for almost half
the film. I wish that it wasn't so, but I guess you can't change history.
Hopkins is just wonderful as the former President, injecting into the
character a large dose of humour.</P>
<P>Newcomer, Djimon Hounsou, gives a great performance as the leader of the
slaves, Cinque. His strong stubborn performance is one that is inspiring.
You latch on to his cause and that is what really carries the film.</P>
<P>McConaughey, whom we last saw in this summer's Contact, gives a good
performance as the lawyer who wants to free the slaves, Baldwin. And Morgan
Freeman is given a somewhat smaller part as Theodore Joadson an
abolitionist who first brings up the case of the slaves to Baldwin. Freeman
who is always a strong screen presence does well, though he is not given
enough screen time. The star of the film is Hopkins though, his performance
is the staple of the film.</P>
<P>Spielberg makes a good film with Amistad, but it doesn't top Schindler's
List. I found that there was no real antagonist in Amistad, the only real
antagonist is the idea of slavery. The mid-portion of this film where
Cinque recounts how he had been brought into slavery is again like the
opening sequence. This sequence is disturbingly frank and the audience is
forced to sit through the sequence because as the audience knows, it's all
too true.</P>
<P>Spielberg is able to bring an emotional closing to the film through
Hopkins' speech. And again, I stress, Hopkins' performance in Amistad is
the one that holds the film together. This performance is Oscar material,
and I hope that he gets honoured for it. What I did like was that Spielberg
was able to insert different pieces of humour throughout the film to let
out some tension and to stir things up again. This was a good move from
Spielberg for such a long film.</P>
<P>Worth mentioning is John Williams' score for the film, which like all his
scores is brilliant.</P>
<P>Amistad is not a great film, but it is a good film that is worth watching
on the big screen. It is a good return for Spielberg after his special
effects driven and plot less dinosaur romp Lost World. It's also the first
film directed by Spielberg out of the DreamWorks SKG production house and
it is a good release at that. Don't miss Amistad on the big screen.</P>
