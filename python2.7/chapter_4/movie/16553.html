<PRE>
 The Governess (1998) 2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Minnie Driver and Tom
Wilkinson.</PRE>
<P> Images are the dominant motif in The Governess, an interesting period
piece by first-time director Sandra Goldbacher, who also wrote the script.</P>
<P> Many of the shots in Goldbacher's story view the protagonists reflected in
mirrors, through a camera lens, or some other object.</P>
<P> That is because The Governess is a study of people wanting to change their
image and of how they want people to see them.</P>
<P> Rosina Da Silva (Minnie Driver) is a Sephardic Jewish woman living within
the warmth and love of her family in London in the 1840s. Then her world is
turned upside down when her father is murdered.</P>
<P> In debt, Rosina, to provide for her family, decides to create a new
identity, Mary Blackchurch, and accept a job as a governess to a family
living on a remote Scottish island.</P>
<P> There she goes to work for the Cavendish family, who are the usual
assortment of Victorian dysfunctionals. Rosina/Mary's pupil, Clementina
(Florence Hoath), is precocious, spoiled and craves attention. Mrs.
Cavendish (Harriet Walter) is bored and snobbish, treating her new employee
with the utmost condescension. Mr. Cavendish (Tom Wilkinson) spends most of
the day cooped up in his laboratory completely absorbed in his pioneering
studies of photography.</P>
<P> Before you can say Charlotte Bronte, Mary has won over Clementina and
formed an uneasy friendship with Mr. Cavendish, who notices her interests
and aptitude in the natural sciences.</P>
<P> As quickly as you can say Jane Eyre, Mary is helping Mr. Cavendish - she
now calls him Charles - in his work, and soon after they are helping each
other undress.</P>
<P> Of course, this being the Victorian era, Charles is one of those repressed
types who pours all his emotion into his work. Though he is in infatuated
with Mary, he also mistreats her for diverting his passions from his
studies to her.</P>
<P> Added to the mix is the Cavendishes' black sheep son, Henry (Jonathan Rhys
Meyers), sent home from university in disgrace. He, too, becomes smitten
with Mary to the point of obsession. His curiosity about her leads him to
discover her secret.</P>
<P> As often happens in such melodramas, the lovers part and Rosina returns to
London where she begins a new life as a photographer, recording the people
in her Jewish community.</P>
<P> The Governess is a bleak movie. Goldbacher keeps her colors muted to fit
the tone of the story.</P>
<P> She derives a fiery performance from Driver, who is all-consumed by her
new-found passion for Charles.</P>
<P> Wilkinson is rigid and tightly would as the introspective inventor who
finds his newly-awakened desires an unbearable intrusion upon his
experiments.</P>
<P> Together Driver and Wilkinson form an odd alliance of heart and mind, or
the sensual and the logical.</P>
<P> Where Goldbacher's story fails is in the buildup to the relationship
between the two. It happens too quickly, and we are not sure - beside their
common interest in science - what could drive such two opposites to begin
such a fruitless venture.</P>
<P> The Governess, however, is a compelling period melodrama that touches a
bit on the anti-Semitism faced by London's Jewish populace and the
sacrifices and compromises some chose in order to grab what few
opportunities the world afforded.</P>
