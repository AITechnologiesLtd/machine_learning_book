<PRE>THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING (1988)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Philip Kauffman
Writers: Jean-Claude Carrièreand Philip Kauffman (based on the novel by
Milan Kundera)
Starring: Daniel Day-Lewis, Juliette Binoche, Lena Olin, Derek de Lint,
Erland Josephson, Pavel Landowsky, Donald Moffat, Stellan Skarsgård, Tomek
Bork, Daniel Olbrychski</P>
<P>"The Unbearable Lightness of Being" is one of the great stories about sex
primarily because it knows exactly how to tell it.  Here's a film that
takes eroticism completely seriously, existing on some kind of other plane
of being...a light plane if you will.  The entire film feels like one
sustained thought about eroticism, but it also contains thoughts on sex,
promiscuity, and the way that life constantly interrupts this kind of
being, and that sex is something that is truly a many splendored thing, but
it's also something that cannot be sustained.</P>
<P>The film is a 3 hour thought on all of this, told in a light-weighted,
almost ethereal tone which has prompted certain groups to refer to it as
"The Unbearable Lightness of Boring."  In some ways, these people are
right: few things occur in this film, and scenes are extended beyond what
they usually would last in a standard film.  But this film isn't interested
in details, or really telling a story as it is with establishing the
correct mood, and saying some very deep things in the process.</P>
<P>The story itself could be interpreted as melodrama: a promiscuous doctor,
Tomas (Daniel Day-Lewis, with big Ben Stiller hair), marries a somewhat
eccentric country girl, Tereza (Juliette Binoche, very pre-"English
Patient"), but also conducts affairs with numerous women while still
staying emotionally faithful to Tereza.  Tomas has always been a womanizer,
and in the first scene of the film, tells a nurse at his hospital whom he
has had some relations with to take her clothes off because he "missed
something last night."  And she does.  When he marries Tereza, it's a tough
thing for him to do because, unlike him, Tereza is not a person who can
have meaningless affairs, and Tomas's cheating on her worries her.</P>
<P>There's another main character: Sabina (sweedish actress Lena Olin), who is
introduced with a title card that says she's the only person who
understands Tomas and his "lightness of being."  She too is promiscuous,
and she is shown at one time conducting an affair with a man named Franz
(Derek de Lint) who sleeps with her, then shows up one night at her
apartment to announce that he's left his wife and wishes to live with her. 
This frightens Sabina chiefly because she too is falling in love with him
and still wants to keep on living the way she does.</P>
<P>There are few other characters, most who come and go in the film, much like
Franz does.  But we are introduced to a few people who pop up every now and
then, including a chief surgeon at Tomas's hospital in Prague played by
Donald Moffat (who played the president in "Clear and Present Danger"); and
other characters who show up for only a brief period of time and then
disappear, like an Engineer played by Stellan Skarsgård (who recently
played Proffessor Lambeau in the overrated "Good Will Hunting) who has an
all-too brief affair wit Tereza at one point in the film.  The triumverate
of characters are all the film is really interested in, and this creates a
closed vaccuum that the film lives in, protecting it from outside forces,
like these supporting characters who show up now and then.</P>
<P>The film also introduces politics and a war, as it takes place in Prague
during the "Prague Spring" of 1969.  It really could be any war, but this
war is special because it deals with communism and the freedom of
expression.  As the film goes on, Tomas becomes more and more outraged by
this war, and his entire livelihood is threatened, as well as Sabina's and
Tereza's.  The war of course is symbolic of reality's way of crushing the
finer parts of life, like sex and other forms of emotional liberation.  Sex
for Tomas and Sabina is a form of escapism, but this kind of living becomes
endangered because it has no center in reality.</P>
<P>The war scenes are handled nicely: without any real detail and with horror.
 The film never truly establishes what war it is, but later tells us that
it has to deal with communism.  The film is not concerned with such petty
details as the cause of the war, or even the outcome.  Such things are not
necessary to the film.  It wants to show the effects it has on the people
in the film, the way it causes them to have to break from their state of
being, and enter into reality.</P>
<P>But the film sustains a kind of hypnotic pull to it.  It's scenes are often
lengthy, filled with humor and a certain kind of eroticism.  Philip
Kauffman (who directed the first NC-17 film, "Henry and June," a couple
years later) directs the film with a light touch, making everything seem
effortless, and nothing but the war sequences coming off as jolting.  The
scenes themselves have lots of risque things going on which never seem to
attract attention themselves like they would in, say, a porn film.  We
delight in seeing them because they come off so nicely and with such a
gentle yet firm touch.</P>
<P>One scene imparticular stands out in the mind.  That's a scene where
Tereza, who's a photographer and just has gotten a job in Geneva (after
they've retreated there), discovers that to get more jobs, she has to
photograph naked women.  She visits Sabina, who's also in Geneva, and asks
her to pose nude for her.  Sabina agrees, and what occurs is so perfecly
orchestrated that it comes off as a 10 minute sustained breath.  Everything
they do is so sensual that I would be shocked if anyone was able to move
during this scene.  It's an example of how minimalism works perfectly in
creating eroticism: the two women never have sex, but they come so close
that it still comes off as satisfying.</P>
<P>The ending of this scene is perfect, with an intrusion into this form of
escapism that brings reality back to the foreground.  The entire film is
like this, dealing with sex on an intelligent level.  It views sex as a
form of escapism in life, and because sex can never last forever, there are
constant intrusions, spoiling the moment.  This is one of the only films
that view sex and promiscuity in a positive light.  It views it so kindly
because of the more philosophical ideas of it: it is a way to forget about
the terrors of the world, and while it's going on, we are almost not aware
of any outside influences and problems, like war or even STDs.</P>
<P>It also views this kind of living as something that some people have and
some don't.  While Tomas and Sabina have it, Tereza doesn't, and her few
attempts to gain it for herself come out as horrible and tragic.  But Tomas
and Sabina easily live with this kind of living, save for the constant
interruptions they have that break the moment.</P>
<P>You also have to respect how this film is so ungraphic about sex.  Despite
the fact that the subject of this film is sex, it doesn't have tons of
graphic sex or all sorts of nudity.  Yes, there is a little bit of both,
but the film does not become excessive at all.  It views sex as a kind of
hypnotic mystique, making it all the more erotic and sensual.  We never get
nasty close-ups, or linger over sex for long periods of time for the reason
that some person may find it fun to jack off to.  It has a deep respect for
sex, and Kauffman directs this with ease, but also the right amount of
restraint.</P>
<P>The title of the film is perfect: it's cynical, witty, and pretty much sums
up what this film is dealing with.  "The Unbearable Lightness of Being" is
about the way that having sex without the emotional entanglements is
something that will only last a short time.  Judging by this idea, as well
as the tragic ending, one might come to the conclusion that this kind of
living is bad, and that it will only lead to more horrible parts of life. 
But this story takes another angle, showing that while this kind of being
is not eternal, it must be enjoyed while it is happening.  Same goes for
this film, which, while it lasts, is a spellbinding film that transports us
to a whole other dimension of being, is interupted with a couple intrusions
of war and other horrors, then gets right back to where it was before. 
What other film treats sex so profoundly and with such love?</P>
