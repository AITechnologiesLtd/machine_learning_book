<PRE>                              CONTACT (1997)
                      A review by Chris Webb 7/31/97</PRE>
<PRE>        Cast: Jodie Foster (Ellie Arroway), Matthew McConaughey (Palmer
              Joss), James Woods (Michael Kitz), John Hurt (S.R. Hadden)
              Tom Skerritt (David Drumlin), Angela Bassett (Rachel 
              Constantine), Jake Busey (Joseph), Jena Malone (Young
              Ellie), Rob Lowe (Richard Rank).  Directed by Robert
              Zemeckis.     </PRE>
<P>        Robert Zemeckis could easily separate himself from Forrest Gump.  
After all, that movie is three years in the past.  By now, he should 
realize that not every movie he touches needs to have the same elements.  
Unfortunately, he doesn't.  </P>
<P>        The technical wonder that was Gump invades some scenes of 
Contact, and they are unwelcome.  Unwelcome to the eye and apparently to 
the man in those scenes, Bill Clinton.  What we have here is similar to 
Gumps meeting with President Kennedy, where characters are superimposed 
onscreen during a presidential speech that makes the archived footage 
seem to be a part of the movie.  Here we find two mistakes: one in 
motive, one in the technical uses of the President.  By now, we are 
aware that Zemeckis can do this sort of thing, and it has swerved into an 
annoying pattern.  Also, we can tell that the President did not make his 
speech indoors as sunlight glistens off his gray hair.</P>
<P>        My other complaint with Zemeckis' handling of this film is the 
gooey sentimentality to which we are subjected early on.  We discover how 
the main character, Ellie Arroway (Foster), has become the way she is 
through a series of flashbacks.  Groans were apparent during these scenes 
and should have been handled differently.   Nonetheless, Contact survives 
the heavy hand of Robert Zemeckis, and succeeds.</P>
<P>        The story has been in the making for seventeen years, the 
brainchild of super-astronomer Carl Sagan, who died last year of cancer.  
Pushed by a fascination with the prospects of alien life, Sagan turned 
Contact into a novel as production hit snags endlessly.  Translated to 
film, the effort is seamless.</P>
<P>        Ellie is a scientist who feels that there is someone out there 
trying to communicate.  Like the efforts to make the movie, Ellie 
hits bumps in her search for intelligent life as funding keeps 
disappearing from her projects.  Behind the sabotages is David Drumlin 
(Skerritt), a good old boy who has paid his dues and seeks the fame for 
himself.  However, just as the sheet is pulled from beneath her, Ellie 
finds a way to keep listening for signals, and one evening one appears 
from the star cluster of Vega, and it packs a punch.</P>
<P>        In a series of wrenching scenes, we watch as Drumlin successfully 
pulls the project away from Ellie.  The project consists of building an 
aptly named "machine" to launch someone to Vega to meeet the aliens.     
Soon enough the government takes over, led by skeptical Michael Kitz (Woods).  
Woods is once again brilliant as the sarcastic wit who has no reason to believe
that anything here is sensible.  These, however, are the mere bones of the 
film.</P>
<P>        Palmer Joss (McConaughey) is a Christian leader who plants the 
issue of God into the minds of the viewers and actors.  The science 
versus religion debate emerges and erupts.  As the machine is being 
built, religious and science fanatics line up along NASAs property to 
protest or support the mission.  Meanwhile, Drumlin and Arroway vie for 
the job to meet the Vegans.  Drumlin plays dirty to attain the position, 
while Arroway speaks from her heart during sessions.</P>
<P>        However, after a tragedy strikes, Ellie is allowed to run the 
mission.  She is guided by the Carl Sagan-as-billionaire, S.R. Hadden 
(Hurt), who helps her reach her goal, the stars.  Amazing are the 
wormhole effects of her entering different atmospheres and galaxies, as 
well as the Vegan land itself.  While on Vega, her meeting must remain a 
surprise.  Zemeckis does have a tocuh of flare with these scenes, and 
could have used more of them.</P>
<P>        Angela Bassett deserved more scenes, and comes up as the wasted 
talent.  Casting Rob Lowe as the conservative and Jake Busey as a lunatic 
were smart decisions.</P>
<P>        I believe that Face/Off is the best film we've been given this summer, 
but Contact is Academy-friendly.  It is almost assured that Foster will 
gain a nomination, and Skerritt, in his icy and calculating performance, 
deserves consideration.  Zemeckis almost blows it, but with the 
fascination behind Contact, even he could reap the benefits of an overall 
good movie.</P>
