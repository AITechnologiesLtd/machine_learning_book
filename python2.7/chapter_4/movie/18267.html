<P>Sometime around 1100 BC, an Egyptian guy named Imhotep had an affair
with the Pharaoh's wife, killed the Pharaoh, and then was subjected to
horrible torture and an eternal curse.  Several thousand years later, in
the 1920s, an American explorer and a British librarian go looking for
treasure, but end up finding Imhotep.  Imhotep is still alive, but now
he's a mummy, and he's very mad.  He proceeds to unleash the 10 plagues
of Egypt on the people around him, while simultaneously sucking mortals
dry so he can get his skin back (after all, it's been three thousand
years, and most of his skin has decomposed).  </P>
<P>Anyone who takes Stephen Sommers' The Mummy seriously is wasting his or
her time.  This is not a serious film.  It's a two-hour joke.  It's also
relentlessly funny and entertaining as heck.  Purists will agree that
The Mummy is not as good as Sommers' previous film, the woefully
underrated (but similarly hilarious) Deep Rising, but there's still fun
to be had here.  You see, Stephen Sommers is a man who understands his
genre and knows that the only way to truly avoid criticism is to
criticize your own movie.  So many horror films go for poker-faced
stiffness and end up completely absurd (Virus, for instance, would have
been ten times better with Sommers at the helm).  The Mummy is a film
bursting at the seams with logical inconsistencies and senseless plot
developments.  It also features gleeful use of anachronistic dialogue
("This country is really messed up!" would not have been a common phrase
in 1926, even for an American treasure hunter).  But I can't avoid
admiration of a film in which a CGI mummy explodes into a fearful cloud
of dust after being hissed at by a fluffy white cat.</P>
<P>Speaking of dust, The Mummy is the sandiest movie I've ever seen. 
There is so much dirt and sand and dust here that I felt like I needed
to shake out my shoes when the picture was finished.  In fact, one of
the neatest effects in the movie features a wall of dust that turns into
Imhotep's face and swallows an airplane.  The characters are constantly
covered in sand, they're always sneezing, and the Mummy himself bursts
into dust whenever he can.</P>
<P>The Mummy is a loose remake of the 1932 film of the same name.  I can
recommend this film in good conscience only because it is so acutely
aware of its own badness.  The cast, too, is in on the joke, which helps
a lot.  Brendan Fraser, an actor I admire for his range, is quite funny
as Rick O'Connell, the surly American treasure hunter; he goes for the
throat with the macho-man attitude and hits the right note for the
role.  Rachel Weisz, playing the British librarian Evelyn, is very
appealing and shows splendid comic timing (she's also a Kate Winslet
look- and sound-alike, which probably is no accident).  John Hannah is
on hand as Jonathan, Evelyn's wife, and has some of the funnier lines in
the film.  Kevin J. O'Connor, who stood out in Deep Rising, has a fine
supporting role as Beni, the cowardly Egyptian guide.</P>
<P>There are parts in The Mummy that I found immensely funny.  The hissing
cat is one such moment.  Sommers makes the most of every cliche he can;
after a mysterious brush of wind passes by our heroes for about the
fifth time, Rick says, "That happens a lot around here."  The film is
adequate as an action picture; I liked a lot of the special effects,
including the sand wall and the walking corpses, and the finale features
some truly amazing swordplay between Rick and a horde of CGI skeletons. 
On the whole, however, the film is more effective as a comedy.  That, I
believe, will be its box office downfall.  The Mummy had a good opening
weekend, but the picture was marketed as a serious action-horror film. 
Fans going in expecting to see serious action will be disappointed.  I
wasn't disappointed; I got what I expected after learning that Stephen
Sommers is responsible for the movie.  And though I believe that The
Mummy could have been even funnier and a lot more thrilling, it's a
commendable effort from a man who clearly would rather make a horror
picture that prompts laughter rather than screams.</P>
