<P>Copyright 1998 Nathaniel R. Atcheson</P>
<P>Guy Ritchie's relentlessly funny and violent picture is one of the most
artistically original movies I've seen in months. The ingenious plot,
which centers around four friends who get mixed up in a series of
crimes, is flawlessly designed and brought together in the conclusion,
and Ritchie never misses the chance for a terrific shot. The movie does
fail to create real people, and there isn't a shred of humanity to be
found anywhere in the picture, but Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels
is still great fun.</P>
