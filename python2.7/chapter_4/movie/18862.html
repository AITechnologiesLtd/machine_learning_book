<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>In 1995, Danish writer/director Lars von Trier established Dogma, a
oddly restrictive anti-establishment filmmaking manifesto that requires
its participants to take a vow of chastity forbidding the use of, among
other things, props, sets, artificial sound and light, lens filters and
superficial action, all while filming with one handheld camera.  To
date, it's worked wonders – producing von Trier's phenomenal Breaking
the Waves, Thomas Vinterberg's The Celebration and 1999 Cannes favorite
Mifune. von Trier's decree also forces its filmmakers to give up the
idea that they are creating art `at the cost of any good taste and any
aesthetic considerations.'  Yikes!</P>
<P>After watching The Idiots you could get the impression that von Trier is
probably more than a little like the film's lead, Stoffer (Jens
Albinus).  Stoffer is the ringleader of a very bizarre co-ed communal
household of fellow Danes that have shunned the normal life for that of
relative idiocy.  That's right – I said idiocy.  The David Lynch
lookalike Stoffer and his housemates venture out into civilization for
the sole purpose of acting like retards.</P>
<P>Now before you get all upset, think back to Matt Dillon telling Cameron
Diaz about his little friend `Mongo,' and tell me that you didn't laugh
up a lap full of popcorn.  Acting retarded isn't wrong.  In fact, Adam
Sandler gets $20 million per picture to do it.  Someday you might even
encourage your kids to do the same.</P>
<P>But these idiots are different than Sandler's.  They're probably closer
kin to Stanley Tucci and Oliver Platt in The Impostors – people using
their skills to con themselves into positions that are generally
unobtainable by the average Joe (or, in this case, your average Bjørn).
Acting retarded is handy when you're dining out and want to skip out on
the check.  It can also get you access to tour a factory that would
otherwise be off-limits.</P>
<P>Don't get me wrong – this movie shouldn't make you think of Pauly
Shore.  It's a fascinating character study that makes you wish that the
film could continue on after the credits role, just so you could learn
more about what makes these people tick (the handheld filming gives The
Idiots a very real, documentary feel).  Why is Stoffer so hell-bent on
obtaining perfect idiocy?  Why do the young lovebirds Jeppe (Nikolaj Lie
Kaas) and Josephine (Louise Mieritz) still act retarded during their
first romantic encounter?  Why does Karen (Bodil Jørgensen) seem so
willing to be kidnapped by the idiots during one particular scam?
Trying to answer these questions is pretty futile once the
full-penetration scene hits the screen.  But I'm not complaining…</P>
