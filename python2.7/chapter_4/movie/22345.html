<PRE>C</PRE>
<P>Czech director Milos Forman, in 1984, made one of the most moving and
eerie films I've ever seen.  His Amadeus is theatrical, breathtaking,
and frightening in its emotional power.  How sad that he is remembered
most for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, a slightly good film that
became one of the only movies to win all five major Academy Awards and
boasted Jack Nicholson's trademark performance as Randle McMurphy.  To
be sure, Cuckoo's is quite an intense movie but the intensity seems to
disguise a rather flawed basis.</P>
<P>In this story of human bondage, tyranny, authority, and liberation,
McMurphy (Nicholson) is a man who has been jailed for "raping" a fifteen
("going on thirty")-year-old girl.  He commits crimes to get out of his
boring job, but he eventually gets sent to a mental institution for
allegedly being insane.  He is well aware that he is not crazy and the
head of the asylum is certain he isn't, too; nevertheless, he is kept in
the hospital for further observation.  During his prolonged stay, he
meets several colorful characters including Billy, a childish,
stuttering young man in perpetual fear of his mother (Brad Dourif);
Harding, an intellectual man unable to get over his wife's adultery
(William Redfield); Martini, a man of an infantile nature (Danny
DeVito); and Chief, a silent, tall figure who later becomes McMurphy's
greatest companion (Will Sampson).</P>
<P>McMurphy becomes acquainted with the head nurse at the hospital, Nurse
Ratched (Louise Fletcher), a seemingly heartless, cold, and insufferable
woman who casts a wicked spell of anxiety over the dependent patients at
the asylum.  Eager to annoy this strict authority, McMurphy encourages
the impressionable group of fellow madmen to rebel against her and the
hospital staff.  After trying so hard to get away from the real world,
McMurphy realizes how dangerous his new surroundings are to the human
spirit.  The staff are crooked, law-abiding, and merciless and only
inflict a sense of hopelessness and entrapment on the already weak
patients.</P>
<P>McMurphy, being sane, sees what is happening to these men.  They are
without any independence and are in a state of mental isolation.  Since
they have not been exposed to humanity and real life, they have become
useless in a world of stringent routines and life-abandoning
activities.  McMurphy learns that most patients at the institution are
not committed as he is and are free to come and go as they please.  They
don't leave, however, because they are too afraid of the real world.
McMurphy raises hell and is convinced he must not be pulled by the
current of brainwashing that has become the seeming sole priority of the
hospital.  The doctors and staff may have good intentions, but their
methods of "curing" the mentally ill are dangerous and emotionally
lethal.  Many patients, including McMurphy, are being worked on with
electric shock procedures.</P>
<P>(*Spoilers ahead, do not read further if you have not seen the film*)</P>
<P>Eventually, the voice of the enigmatic character, Chief, emerges.  First
thought to be deaf and dumb, Chief forges a strong friendship with
McMurphy and both share the same dream of escaping the hospital.</P>
<P>One night, McMurphy summons two lady friends from the real world, asks
them to bring booze to the asylum, and all the patients get drunk and
have a party.  Billy, in particular, undergoes a metamorphosis during
this pivotal night in the men's lives.  Once a stuttering, mentally
immature character, Billy loses his virginity and gains confidence
during the party, only to have it snatched from him by Nurse Ratched
when she returns the next morning and threatens to tell his mother about
what went on the preceding night.  Billy, tragically, commits suicide.
This and the final sequence are the most intense and bleak moments of
the film.  They ring true, though, and are not overly extreme like much
of the rest of the film.</P>
<P>In the final sequence, Chief is ready to escape the hospital with
McMurphy, but his plans are ruined when he discovers McMurphy has
finally been ruined by the electric-shock experiments performed on him
by the doctors.  In one of the most heartbreaking moments of the film,
Chief hugs his friend and mercifully smothers and kills him, saving him
from the joyless life inside the walls of the hospital.  The dismal mood
of that scene is replaced with the triumph of Chief, who becomes the
focal point of the story at the end.  He follows through with the
inspiring encouragement of McMurphy and escapes the institution.</P>
<P>What is pitiful about One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is not these
scenes, which are memorable and not without their emotional pull.
Rather it is the repetitiveness of the rest of the story, which circles
aimlessly for more than two hours.  Instead of confronting the moral at
hand, Cuckoo's beats around the bush, diluting the power of the film's
message.  The atrocities of the hospital are accented while the truth of
the movie is allowed to fade into the background.</P>
<P>Aside from these criticisms, the performances are observant and, at
times, masterful.  Louise Fletcher is subtly cruel as Nurse Ratched.
Her performance is almost perfect.  Jack Nicholson, in a legendary
portrayal, is also worthy of attention and accolades.  He makes a great,
havoc-brewing hero.  Brad Dourif and Will Sampson also give poignant and
noteworthy turns.</P>
<P>However, this fails to compensate for the lack of enticing material in
the movie.  The horrors of the hospital are attention-grabbing, but are
of little interest to me in the muddle of a movie One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest is.  The movie is inconsistent: shifting from being
tedious to being very effective.  It is dark, moody, but only partially
successful.  With all the respect this movie has garnered from audiences
these past two decades, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest came across to
me as trying desperately to extract profundity out of outrageousness
and, in my eyes, it fails.</P>
