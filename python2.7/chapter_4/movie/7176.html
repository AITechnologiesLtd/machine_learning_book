<PRE>                              A SINGLE GIRL
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>The movies have always had pretty faces.  Not a year passes but that
some new and beautiful woman enchants the audience with her presence.
This year, the one who bowled me over is 19-years-old Virginie
Ledoyen.  Although she has been in French films for some 6 years, this
was the first time I had seen her.  In 1995 she appeared in this
current film (just being released in the U.S. now), in La Ceremonie and
in Mahjong, a film by Taiwanese director Edward Yang.</P>
<P>Virginie is not of the Hollywood mold.  In what may be described as
wholesome, intelligent, a delight to behold, Virginie (who in this film
is Valerie) has a unique kind of beauty.  Her eyes have depth; you can
see the wheels turning inside her head; happy and giggling, sad and
sizing up a situation,  Every emotion comes through that lovely
face.  Little wonder that she is in every scene in A SINGLE GIRL.
Little wonder that the director has the photographer, (Caroline
Champetier), slavishly follow her every move, whether sitting at a
table in a cafe, strolling briskly through the French city, bringing
Room Service meals to the hotel's customers where she works.  And
almost always, a look of independence on her face.  A pretty good
trick when you are only nineteen.  .  . and pregnant.</P>
<P>Valerie is in a cafe talking over a cup of coffee to her unemployed
boyfriend, Remi (Benoit Magimel).  She is waiting for the right
moment to tell him she is one month pregnant and does he have any
thoughts about the new situation.  He really does not; he is surprised,
of course, but speaks in generalities.</P>
<P>Employed as a waitress who serves the Four Star hotel's guests when
they ring for room service, she encounters some odd ones; those who
offer to pay for her sexual services, those who are freaky in other
respects.  There is also the hotel's manager who would like to get at
her (as he doing with another employee). Valerie wards them all off,
accepting her situation with stoic equanimity.  In short, she is a
person of exceptional character.  Her experiences enable her to
determine what she will do about the baby she is bearing.  Looking at
that face, you know that whatever decision she makes, it will be the
right one.</P>
