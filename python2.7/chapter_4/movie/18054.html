<P>     THE CASTLE is the kind of comedy that never could have been made in
Hollywood.  Scratch that -- it could have been made in Hollywood, but it
would have been a disaster.  The use of a voice-over narrator would have
turned into a crutch instead of a source of inspired brilliance.  The
working class characters might have been either salt-of-the-earth or
grotesque, but never the perfect blend of both.  The tale of a little guy
fighting the system would have been wrapped up by a wildly cheering
courtroom gallery, instead of a delightfully profane two-word summation.
And the neat and tidy 82-minute running time would have been bloated by
another 15 or 20 minutes.  Thank the gods of cinema that THE CASTLE was
made in Australia, where director/co-screenwriter Rob Sitch has turned the
1997 Aussie smash into the brightest, most raucous comedy to hit America
in 1999.</P>
<P>     The protagonist of THE CASTLE is Darryl Kerrigan (Michael Caton), tow
truck driver and proud owner of a house at 3 Highview Crescent on the
outskirts of Melbourne with his wife Sal (Anne Tenney) and sons Steve
(Anthony Simcoe) and Dale (Stephen Curry).  It matters little to Darryl
that the house is built on landfill next to the airport -- it's his home,
his pride and joy, his castle.  He's appalled to discover that the
government plans a forced relocation of the Kerrigans and their neighbors
to make way for an airport expansion.  Darryl, however, isn't going to
give up his castle without a fight, and launches a challenge -- legal and
otherwise -- that goes all the way to the Australian Supreme Court.</P>
<P>     It's no small task to laugh _with_ a collection of characters and
laugh _at_ them at the same time, but that's exactly what Sitch and his
three co-writers have accomplished.  In America, the Kerrigans would be
referred to as "white trash" -- dog pens in the back yard, a huge aerial
antenna on the roof, unsightly additions cobbled together when time
permits, a son (Wayne Hope) in jail.  Sitch turns the smiling bad taste of
the Kerrigans into perfectly-pitched comedy.  Making ideal use of Stephen
Curry's flat narration as Dale, the film-makers show us a family of simple
people who think they're living a life of royalty where beer steins are
high art and a meat loaf is a meal fit for a king.</P>
<P>     Yet it is exactly that skewed perspective that makes THE CASTLE so
endearing even as it sends you rolling on the floor with laughter.
Michael Caton's pitch-perfect performance as Darryl is a portrait of
brighter-side-looking that re-defines the term.  There's a beautiful
sincerity to the way he looks with awe on the combination hose/scrub brush
created by "idea man" Steve, to his love for the family's pre-fabricated
vacation home at a less-than-picturesque lake, to his simple speech at his
daughter's wedding.  It's a performance so warm that anyone who might look
condescendingly at the Kerrigans should feel ashamed.  A man's love for
what he has -- rather than envy of what he doesn't have -- has rarely felt
this genuine.</P>
<P>      Of course THE CASTLE is also a David vs. Goliath story, pitting
Darryl against the Big Corporation assisted first by a small-time attorney
(Tiriel Mora), then by a veteran barrister (Charles "Bud" Tingwell) moved
by Darryl's plight.  Yet the film is never really about that battle in the
way that you'd expect.  There are some marvelous comic moments as Darryl
takes on his adversaries, but the richness of THE CASTLE comes from the
fact that his victory is one of perspective even before a verdict is read.
Sure, in some ways it's a one-joke film, and perhaps some viewers will
grow weary of that one joke.  It just happens to be a joke told with the
kind of skill we just don't see very often.  An audience trained what to
expect from comedies by Hollywood will find expectations in this Down
Under comedy turned -- most appropriately -- upside-down.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 home sweet homes:  9.</PRE>
