<PRE>                 LOCK, STOCK, AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Comic chaos in the criminal class.
          We have seen this sort of thing before, but it
          remains amusing.  Six different groups of people,
          all on the shady side of the law, keep bumping into
          each other.  Our four main characters owe money to
          one so steal from another who are stealing from yet
          another.  The script manages to juggle all six so
          they are each in constant motion.  Rating: 6 (0 to
          10), +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     LOCK, STOCK, AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS is the kind of farce we have
seen before. It is a comedy of chaos.  This sort of comedy puts enough
groups of people together in a script, none knowing what the others are
doing and (perhaps) the audience can follow what is going on, but you
can reasonably expect that none of the characters has a clue.
Particularly good comedies in this vein are Martin Scorsese's AFTER
HOURS and John Landis's OSCAR.</P>
<P>     The plot of LOCK, STOCK, AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS works like a
well-oiled machine set on high-speed, with everybody doing things to
everybody else and nobody being sure who is doing what to whom. It
seemed like a good idea at the time. Four young London low-lifes figure
they have a good shot at getting rich if they can get into a high
stakes poker game.  They get together 100,000 pounds.  What they did
not count on was that the game was rigged and that they would end up
owing 500,000 pounds.  And they have one week to get it.  Luckily a
possibility presents itself.  Their next-door neighbors are planning to
rob an urban marijuana farmer.  Our group plans to steal the proceeds
of that crime.  But that is not all that is happening.  All told there
are about six different groups of people, all criminal in some ways,
running around bumping into each other, double-crossing each other, and
shooting each other up.</P>
<P>     Everybody is doing something illegal in this part of London; it
goes with the turf.  Set in a part of London where the law is something
of an irrelevancy, this frantic farce is the first outing for 30-year-
old writer and director Guy Ritchie.  Everyone here is a criminal, but
at least he is an eloquent one.  As has been the style for crime films
since PULP FICTION, the dialog leans to the clever and inventive side
and away, far away, from realism.  Everybody knows that few real thugs,
and certainly not the ones this far down the ladder, are as eloquent
and as engaging to hear as the ones in this film.  If they were this
bright, they would be in a less hazardous profession.  But then the
filmmaker's first responsibility is to entertain.  Some Americans will
have problems penetrating the thick accents that unfortunately obscure
some of the funniest lines.</P>
<P>     Most of the actors have good credentials in British films, though
they may be less familiar in this country.  One exception is a small
part for Sting. Supplementing the cast are some particularly ugly
actors, apparently by the credits supplied by a special agency
dedicated to providing ugly actors.</P>
<P>     The film has considerably more violence than an Alec Guinness
English crime comedy would have and some of it may cut against the
humor, but Guy Ritchie is a promising director.  Rate this a 6 on the0
to 10 scale and a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
