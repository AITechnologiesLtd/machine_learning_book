Antitrust</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony </PRE>
<P>"In the computer business there is no second place; it's binary, one or 
zero, live or die," a suspiciously familiar hi-tech czar played by Tim 
Robbins propa-"gates" his software product and company (Nurv) as he 
defends his corporate monopoly, "Hey, some kid in some garage could take 
us down at any time." </P>
<P>Milo is working over time with best bud Teddy (in a garage)... hoping to 
do just that when the phone rings. It's Bill (I mean Gary Winston, Nurv 
CEO) offering him a job. The offer splits these best friends as Milo 
goes off to work at Micros ... (I mean Nurv), and Teddy, repulsed by 
Nurv's fascist strategies, seeks private investors for his own software 
projects. It's actually a great springboard into a movie about best 
friends turned competitors. But that's not how the film is programmed. 
With young sharp techno-geeks dropping like flies, the film changes 
genres midstream; from smart buddy film, to cheap thriller, and almost 
back again. </P>
<P>Though not a great film, "Antitrust" handles several elements very 
nicely. I especially love Milo's realization scene. It's a crunch of 
sound and video that hit home. Speaking of sound ... the quality of the 
tracks in this production is quite high: the choice of alternative rock 
(which started in Seattle - nudge, nudge, wink, wink), the score, and 
the careful crisp mix. The acting is respectable, while the camera 
movement, direction and editing are very professional. Together they 
make this "B" movie look very good. </P>
<P>But this is still a "B" movie. At times the sharp script dips into the 
ridiculous, reducing the battle of geniuses to fodder for warehouse 
chase scenes ... complete with false scares and all. More than once, 
this audience giggled at the silliness projected on screen. Still, never 
a dull moment, well paced and suspenseful to the end. You'll fall more 
than once for the film's twist-traps and enjoy being fooled. As with 
"Save the Last Dance" I think it's a strong film for 14 to 18 year-olds. </P>
