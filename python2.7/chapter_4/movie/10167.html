<PRE>Boogie Nights (1997)</PRE>
<P>Seen with Tony on 10 November 1997 for $8.75 at the Sony 19th Street</P>
<P>Believe it or not, in life and in the movies, a 13-inch penis will only go
so far. If it happens to be attached to you, you ultimately might decide
it's more trouble than it's worth. Just look at what happens to Eddie
Adams in *Boogie Nights*. </P>
<P>The hoopla surrounding *Boogie Nights* is ill-deserved. You will spend a
nonrefundable 152 minutes watching truly stupid people rise and fall (no
pun intended) in the porno industry. This was my major beef with the
movie.  Nothing counters the complete stupidity of these characters. The
few moments of pathos are worthless because none of these characters are
drawn either sympathetically *or* demonically. There is no need for the
audience to love or hate these people; it's like eavesdropping on the shop
class kids who smoke near the bike rack at your high school. Would you
want to do *that* for 152 minutes? </P>
<P>Like many movies set in the 1970s, there are lots of unintentional laughs
in *Boogie Nights*, which spans 1977 through about 1985. One has to credit
the actors in this movie; it takes a lot of talent to act this stupid.
Eddie Adams (Mark "Marky Mark" Wahlberg) possesses the forementioned
13-inch penis. It is "his one special thing," and he uses it to his
advantage, because he is not a bright boy. He catches the eye of the
ridiculously named Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds), a pornographer who thinks
he is a "filmmaker." An overnight success, Eddie becomes "Dirk Diggler"
and is able to fund his hapless American dream--a house featuring a lot of
wood panelling, a closet full of hideous clothing, and a red Camaro. The
movie touches on the notion that he comes from a broken home; his shrill
mother (Joanna Gleason) inexplicably hates him, so he immediately becomes
a porn star. Rollergirl (Heather Graham) isn't prepared for a test, so she
runs off to become the porn star (who never removes her rollerskates). 
These are motivations? None of this is developed or makes sense! </P>
<P>There are other subplots too numerous and stupid to mention; in the end
none of it means much of anything. There are consequences to the
pornographer's actions, but instead of feeling for these people, all you
can think is, "Well, what did they expect would happen." Many
opportunities to make the characters more pitiful or more ironic or
nastier are missed; they remain simply annoying.  The idea that they form
a "special kind of family" is would be okay if it were not so
bizarre--like Amber Waves (Julianne Moore), who sees herself as a mother
to Dirk and Rollergirl. Ahem! Mothers usually do not *have sexual
intercourse* with their children! </P>
<P>Also, shame on director Paul Thomas Anderson for ripping off Quentin
Tarantino, and numerous others.</P>
<P>BONUS: In the event rampant drug use and pornography simply was not enough
for you, there is also senseless violence. </P>
