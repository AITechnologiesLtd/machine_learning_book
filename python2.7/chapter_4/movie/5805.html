<PRE>                                   EMMA
                       A film review by Desiree Sy
                        Copyright 1996 Desiree Sy</PRE>
<P>First, a general caveat; this isn't actually a review of EMMA,
per se.  I have a strong interest in Jane Austen, and a strong
interest in film adaptations, and this is an examination of how I
think the adaptation of EMMA works, and where it fails.  In terms
of the film itself -- I think it's about a 7 out of 10, and had a
great time.</P>
<P>As a self-professed fanatic Janite, I must meekly confess that
not only do I care for this novel the least of the set (yes, even 
less than MANSFIELD PARK!), but that I actually dislike both Emma 
and Mr. Knightley (actually, the latter fact probably accounts for 
the former).  Of all the little self-deprecatory remarks we've 
glimpsed from Austen's correspondence abt her writing, the only one 
I agree with personally is her assessment of Emma Woodhouse as a 
character that no one will much like but her -- I find Emma
spoilt, snobbish, interfering, and worst of all not living up to
her potential.  In turn, I think Mr. Knightley condescending in his
admonitions to Emma -- however well-deserved they are.</P>
<P>I have to compliment Gwenyth Paltrow for accomplishing what I
thought wdn't be possible; for making me like Emma.  This feat is
only outstripped by Juliet Stevenson's Nora in the TV adaption of
A DOLL'S HOUSE.  Jeremy Northam also entirely alleviated my
feelings abt Mr. Knightley.</P>
<P>On the whole, I think people who like movies based on English
classics with a lot of anglothespians acting in it shd get out
and see EMMA, and I think such people will have a good time.  I
certainly did -- it's funny, and the performances are wonderful.
Having said that, I like the film less than many critics do.</P>
<P>As I cannot really discuss why I feel this way without talking
about what happens in film and book, I add the obligatory spoiler
warning here.</P>
<P>EMMA is about the uncovering of truth, and about the restoration
of equilibrium through change -- and again, in perfect Austen
fashion, there are two levels to watch; the novel comments on the
societal discovery of truth, social imbalance and large changes
*using* personal misunderstandings, inequalities and changes of
heart.</P>
<P>In Douglas McGrath's film, unlike Emma Thompson's brilliant
rendering of SENSE & SENSIBILITY, the larger framework is
entirely absent -- he has essentially stripped the film down to a
comedy on the personal level.  I had been hoping for more when
the opening credits look down on Hartfield through a metaphorical
telescope which includes the scope of the whole world (like when
you were six and you wrote in your exercise books "Desiree Sy,
Street Name, City, Province, Country, Continent, The World").
But frankly, like much of the movie, this is just a glib and
clever one-off effect.</P>
<P>All the characters have, in a sense, three sets of values:  their
societal place, their monetary worth, and their truest worth, as
humans.  The uncovering of truth in EMMA is the gradual
revelation of what these values are for each of the characters,
as the first two values can obscure the most important value of
self worth.  The restoration of equilibrium in EMMA is depicted
as the central characters achieve the place in society that they
should through their self worth; in Emma this can only happen
through change.</P>
<P>For example, there are Emma and Mr. Knightley -- both
gentlepersons, but Emma very rich and Mr. K  rich, but not *very*
rich.  (It's this fact as well as the age disparity which
confuses Highbury -- and Emma! -- abt the sometimes too obvious
perfectness of the one for the other.)  Emma herself believes she
will never marry because there is no one who is her match in
pos'n or wealth -- this subtext is missing from her witty
explanation of wealthy old maids in the film. Of course, the
biggest disparity between Emma and Mr. K is that he's genuinely
considerate and can see true worth in others (even eventually
discerning the goodness in Harriet after his initial dismissal of
her qualities), whereas she often acts for the appearance of
kindness -- at least they punched her realization of this in the
film, but the film doesn't often enough depict her acting in a
way that *she* sees as kind, but is just interfering.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. Weston -- The film briefly alludes to the fact that
Miss Taylor "married up" in class (though not in terms of her
worth).</P>
<P>Miss Bates -- A "decayed gentlewoman", but poor and silly</P>
<P>Harriet -- Illegitimate, poor, ignorant but kind (and beautiful)</P>
<P>Robert Martin -- Above Harriet and below everyone else, a farmer,
and on terms of friendship with Mr. K and worthy</P>
<P>Elton -- As the vicar, above Martin, but below Mr. K and
Churchill; of course, a total cad in terms of personal merit.</P>
<P>Mrs. E -- The comic masterpiece of this tableau:  from trade,
married into gentility, rich -- and fantastically vulgar.</P>
<P>Jane Fairfax -- An orphan, dependent on the Bates and thus even
poorer than they, but raised by a friend of her father's --
gifted in intellect, elegance and beauty (more gifted, in fact,
through application, than Emma, which accounts for E's dislike of
J) but reserved.  Jane's is the greatest disparity between true
and perceived worth -- in a Bronte novel, *she* would have been
the heroine, not Emma.  Since it's not, Austen manages to make
her so pallid we don't care for her much.</P>
<P>Frank Churchill -- The most complicated situation of all: raised
above his station through upbringing, as was Jane, but through
adoption able to maintain his higher status of position and
wealth.  However, though charming and merry and witty, he lacks
integrity and consideration; he's a more harmless incarnation of
Willoughby, Wickham, and Henry Crawford.</P>
<P>The full range of knowledge about all these situations has to be
made absolutely clear for the impact of the misunderstandings and
changes to register, and in the film, they are *not* made clear.
In particular, the positions of Jane and Frank -- key to part of
Emma's self revelation -- are not explained in a way so that
people who don't already know the story will understand them.
This not only dilutes the "larger picture" effect, but leaves
some pretty big holes in the personal plots.</P>
<P>In the group I saw the film with, there was a clear division
between those who had read the novel and who hadn't, because
those who hadn't read the novel didn't understood the entire
Fairfax/Churchill subplot -- why was their engagement a secret?
One person went a step further -- he couldn't understand at all
why Emma suddenly falls out of love with Churchill and why
everyone is criticizing him -- what did he do wrong?  (In
CLUELESS, Amy Heckerling's recent updating of EMMA, as this
person pointed out, the Frank analogue is depicted as gay, so it
makes sense.  I think this viewer was half expecting Frank to
turn out to be gay. :) )</P>
<P>Churchill's delight in fooling everyone, and his ongoing
flirtation with Emma is only depicted in the piano scene -- he's
almost immediately shown as running after Jane Fairfax.  [Aside:
In this film, not only do we hear modern piano noises coming out
of a small pianoforte, but Paltrow plays the piano with elbow
length gloves on!  You try it sometime; I have.]  Also, we aren't
given nearly as many clues in the novel about the true sit'n with
Jane and Frank -- in the book, we don't clue in until Mr. K does
-- about three quarters through the book.  He only suspects Frank
of trifling with Jane, figuring that Emma is his matrimonial
object; our suspicion of Frank grows through his eyes -- and so
it should have in the film, too!</P>
<P>The film also missed a superb way to illustrate the social
pos'n/worth dichotomy by omitting the scene where Mrs. E must
proceed Emma in leading the ball, through her increased status as
the new bride.  "Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton,
through she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her.
It was almost enough to make her think of marrying."</P>
<P>Also, to bring off Emma's transformation with panache, she *has*
to be shown as more of a snob -- recognizing only a person's
first two values, except in those situations where she already
likes the person, in which case she *ignores* the values (in the
novel, Emma is clearly shown as having fabricated in her head a
noble bastardy for Harriet -- "the stain of illegitimacy,
unbleached by nobility and wealth, would have been a stain
indeed!" -- the film actually reverses this for a comic effect,
having Emma guess that Harriet's parents "might well be pirates!"
after hearing of H's love for Mr. K).  Near the beginning of the
story, even when confronted with clear evidence of Martin's true
worth -- his letter of proposal to Harriet -- she chooses to
ignore it.  In the Elton proposal scene, she rejects him not only
because she thinks that he has no integrity, but because she
considers *herself* above him in class and wealth.</P>
<P>In fact, Emma's gradual realization that she isn't in love with
Frank is linked in the novel to her inability to discover any
tangible evidence of his true worth.  When she asks herself the
question of whether she's in love with him or not (which occurs
over a much longer period in the book -- sort of like a daily
temperature reading), all she comes up with is the general
expectation of Highbury, and particularly of the Westons that she
*should* be in love with him -- he's rich, he's a gentleman;
there's never any measure of the man himself.  Should have left
the haircut scene in the film -- it's a lovely realization in
Emma of his surface qualities.  The climax of this should have
been at the revelation of his engagement with Jane Fairfax --
when Emma realizes that he's been using her as a shield. Except
of course, in the film, he *hasn't* been -- the degree of
overfamiliarity and flirting is not marked or extended enough.</P>
<P>E's second major self revelation is at the picnic when she
unworthily guns down Miss Bates. Here, Mr. K delineates exactly
why she did wrong (if Miss Bates were Emma's social and monetary
equal, then she could tease her, but as a true gentlewoman, she
should not have with those disparities in place -- Mr. K sees
this as he influence of Churchill), and unlike the other
disagreement that they have over Harriet and Robert, Emma
realizes the truth in what he is saying.</P>
<P>One thing the film gets absolutely right, through Paltrow's
performance, is
Emma's essentially transparent nature.  Unlike any of the other
Austen heroines (well, possibly Catherine Morland, too), Emma is
not reserved -- she doesn't reflect in her bedroom, she doesn't
think, and she certainly hasn't mastered the social lie (the lie
for personal gain, sure).  She's limpid and witty and a very
surfacey person -- but gradually, towards the end, she must reach
down deep.  And it's here that the film fails.</P>
<P>First, after the Miss Bates incident.  This is the first instance
in the novel where Emma is shown as "reflecting".  Unfortunately,
in *time* terms, there's not enough weight given to this
reflection in the film -- even if the editing had been slowed
during the scenes of self realization it would have been better.
Still, this isn't the biggest problem.</P>
<P>The film doesn't depict Emma's gradual understanding of
Churchill's lack of true qualities, and fails to capitalize on 
her attempts at self improvement after the picnic.  But worst 
of all, it entirely misses the climax of Emma's journey to self 
awareness, her most truly heroic act.</P>
<P>This is during the crucial, linchpin scene when she first hears
of Harriet's admission of love for Mr. K, and hears Harriet's
belief that he loves her back.  This is the moment when Emma, lit
with her own personal understanding, finally reaches the moment
of eclairissement about the dichotomy of class, money, and true
worth:</P>
<PRE>        A few minutes were sufficient for making her acquainted
        with her own heart.... She touched -- she admitted --
        she acknowledged the whole truth.  Why was it so much
        worse that Harriet shd be in love with Mr. K, than with
        Frank Churchill?</PRE>
<P>This leads, naturally to her self understanding:</P>
<PRE>        It darted through her with the speed of an arrow, that Mr. K
        must marry no one but herself!</PRE>
<P>The point is that it's the one realization that *leads* to the
other -- this is the exact opposite of her approach to trying to
understand whether or not she's in love with Frank Churchill.
She finally understands that she and Mr. K must match, because
their true selves match.</P>
<P>And then she does the most amazing thing in the whole novel:  she
sits and listens:</P>
<PRE>        Some portion of respect for herself....and a strong sense of
        justice by Harriet -- (there wd be no need of *compassion* to
        the girl who believed herself loved by Mr.  Knightley -- but
        justice required that she shd not be made unhappy by any 
        coldness now,) gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure
        farther with calmness, with even apparent kindness.</PRE>
<P>She has reached the height of her own growth.  Like all good
Austenian heroines, she learns to think of others, and suffer in
silence -- and our hearts ache.</P>
<P>It's absolutely wrong that the most poignant part of the film
should be the Miss Bates incident -- it must be *this* moment,
where love is revealed by truth, and then honour follows.</P>
<P>McGrath, in a fashion typical to the whole film, throws away the
emotion in favour of burlesque.  We cut immediately to an
improbable conversation with Mrs Weston where Emma is
*explaining* that she realized her love for Mr. Knightley -- we
don't see her listening to why Harriet thinks that he loves her
-- and McGrath immediately plonks in some funny lines.  We laugh,
but this isn't the right moment -- this is the point where we
should feel like crying for Emma, except that we know that K does
love her.</P>
<P>This isn't the only scene where we get emotions and impressions
once removed; there's altogether *too much* expository -- it's
exactly because Frank Churchill's situation is explained at
dinner before we ever see him that the information doesn't
register.  Then we never understand that Mrs. Weston always
wanted Frank to marry Emma, and planted that romantic notion in
her head -- while the *reader* has "met" the imaginary Frank
before he appears in the novel, the *viewer* does not.  (The
chance to do this -- the letter Emma is trying to hear from Frank
-- is instead used as a comic device to depict Elton's att'ns;
this is funny, but misses the larger point.)  To this we add the
chaser of Mr. K improbably saying *during his proposal*, "Why do
you think I never liked Frank Churchill?"</P>
<P>How much better it would have been to have *shown* his dislike of
Churchill *before* Frank arrived, and then his growing suspicions
as he noticed Frank's attentions to Jane.  The perfect vehicle
for the former is the converstaion he and E have before Frank
arrives, where he criticizes F for not coming to pay his respects
to his new stepmother; for the latter, the letter that F and E
use to tease Jane, as they are observed by Mr. K at the picnic.</P>
<P>And how *infinitely* better it would have been to simply *see*
Emma's realization of her love for Mr. K -- Paltrow's expression
is luminous and clear enough to make that perfectly obvious to us
without her having to tell us.  What that conversation with Mrs.
W should have been used for was to show us that she understood
the *other* point -- that Churchill and Mr. K were equally
available to Harriet using E's old, flawed measure of worthiness,
but that obviously Mr. K's true worth did not match Harriet's.
And the scene, if inserted, should have been a flash-forward, so
we could cut back to Emma w/Harriet.</P>
<P>Another problem is that by not staying, we never *hear* any
reasons why Emma thinks Harriet may be right.  One peculiar
consequence of this is that the double edged tone of the walk
with Mr. K before his proposal is lost. My brother said he
thought that when Mr. K said that he had "one reason to envy
Frank Churchill", he thought that Emma thought Mr. K was
referring to *Jane* -- at no point did my brother ever think that
Emma truly believed that Mr. K might love *Harriet*.</P>
<PRE>What a mess!</PRE>
<P>It also makes the balance of the film seem wrong that there's all
that stuff after Mr. K and Emma get together -- in the novel, of
course, it's further evidence of E's progress that she accept
Harriet and Robert's marriage.  The film that McGrath was making
-- without the social context -- shd have collapsed this incident
quickly -- it would have been better even if Mr. K mentioned it
immediately after his proposal ("Oh, by the way, you'll be sorry
to hear that....")</P>
<P>Okay.  You know what *else* I didn't like about the film?  I
thought the cinematography was *atrocious*!  First, the lighting
was weird through the whole film.  Obviously they were trying for
tricky window lighting, but the overall effect was distracting
and obscuring.  At many points, there are noticable lighting
imbalances between shots, and weird stuff:</P>
<P>- In a dinner scene, the candles seem to give off warm tungsten
balanced light, then from the reverse angle, bluer light</P>
<P>- At one point during the dance, it looks as if daylight through
a window, not candlelight, is shining on Harriet.</P>
<P>- During the tea scene (after the archery), the lighting levels
on (1) Emma shots, (2) Emma and Mr. K shots, and (3) the medium
of Mr. K are not the same!</P>
<P>- That weird choice at the door when people are moving out of
light into darkness, then speaking, and then moving back into the
light (why?).</P>
<PRE>- Lots of others.</PRE>
<P>And God -- those cheesy, cheesy pan and dolly shots!  The two
worst were the overhead through the bower shot swinging down to a
front medium -- and Paltrow obviously instructed to pause her
speech to wait for the swing -- when E first learns of Robert
Martin; and then that swing around to a two-shot of E and Mr. K,
with the hall in the background.  Ptui!  Right up there with the
worst shots in FRANKENSTEIN!  (Actually, I begin to get a taste
of what horrors Branagh might have inflicted on us for S&S had he
and Emma Thompson not mercifully come to outs first.)  And that
thunderclap at that crucial moment -- please, someone call the
taste police!</P>
<PRE>Okay, I've vented.</PRE>
<P>Having said all this -- it was still a damn funny film.  It
manages to get away with itself because all the performances are
so fine.  It will undoubtedly launch Paltrow's career -- she
looks so much like Blythe Danner in some shots; I think she has
the most beautiful neck since Audrey Hepburn's.</P>
<P>Go catch it, but it's not even close to being in the same class
as S&S, or PERSUASION.</P>
