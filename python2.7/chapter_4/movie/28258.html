<PRE>"Shrek" -- Big on Magic, Short on Story
by Homer Yen
(c) 2001</PRE>
<P>Once upon a time, there existed a fierce rivalry
between two powerful animation production companies. 
One was called Pixar, owned by a juggernaut known as
Disney whose name has become synonymous with great
animation and storytelling.  The other was a feisty
little startup company known as Pacific Data Images,
headed by Dreamworks.</P>
<P>Their battle began a few years ago when Pixar released
"A Bug's Life" and then Dreamworks/PDI released soon
afterwards the similarly themed "ANTZ."  Both
companies showed that they were capable of ushering a
new era of animation technology and that the public
could look forward to further sparring in the form of
more ambitious releases.  And now with "Shrek",
Dreamworks/PDI has taken their rivalry to the next
level with a film that not only showcases incredible
animation but also pokes fun at the wonderful world of
Disney.</P>
<P>"Shrek" is a lively and disarmingly silly tale of a
misanthropic ogre (voiced by the gleeful Mike Myers
with a Scottish brogue).  He values his solitude, but
becomes especially distressed when fairy tale
creatures wind up in his private little swamp.  The
creatures explain that the mean Lord Farquaad (voiced
by the deliciously malevolent sounding John Lithgow)
has exiled them there.  Our green hero, joined by a
wise-cracking donkey named Donkey (Eddie Murphy),
leaves to seek out the evil nobleman in order to claim
back their land.</P>
<P>The story itself never approaches the level of awe
that we have for the animation, which incorporates an
added level of detail, light, and texture that has not
been seen before.  The verdancy of the forest and the
meadows that sway in the wind are truly incredible. 
Donkey looks amazingly lifelike with his furry
exterior and ears that reposition itself based on his
emotions.  Extended sequences such as a song and dance
number with Robin Hood and his very Merry Men and an
escape from a dragon's keep is nothing less than
impressive.</P>
<P>There's plenty here to entertain kids of all ages. 
Young ones will like the colorful characters while
older ones will be reminded of their precious youth
when they see the likes of the Gingerbread Man (who
proclaims "Eat Me" when being threatened by Farquaad),
the Seven Dwarves, the Three Blind Mice, and dozens of
others.  Meanwhile, there are lots of humorous moments
derived from references to pop culture (with spoofs of
The Dating Game, The Matrix, and the WWF), but it also
takes great pleasure in teasing the Disney company. 
For instance, Farquaad's city looks very much like the
Magic Kingdom with its parking lots, turnstiles, and
musical information kiosks.  </P>
<P>"Shrek," unfortunately, never musters enough strength
to tell an involved story.  While our lovable oaf
laments that he actually has a good heart and is just
misunderstood, develops affection for the rescued
Princess Fiona (voiced by Cameron Diaz), and learns a
lesson about friendship and forgiveness, the ideas
seemed hollow.</P>
<P>"Shrek" seems more interested in dazzling us with its
animation and funny moments.  We are dazzled and we
laugh, but the cleverest moments occurred outside the
context of the plot.  More noteworthy animated films
such as "Toy Story", "Chicken Run", and Beauty and the
Beast easily outmatched this film's storytelling
muscle.  Regardless, this is a nice offering that will
undoubtedly leave a lasting impression in your mind.</P>
