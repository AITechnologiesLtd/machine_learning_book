<PRE>HANNIBAL
--------</PRE>
<P>Ten years ago, director Jonathan Demme gave us a serial killer movie that
was a masterpiece of its genre in "The Silence of the Lambs."  Taking over
the reins, director Ridley Scott ("Gladiator") brings Thomas Harris' third
novel to feature Hannibal Lecter to the screen.  Julianne Moore ("The End of
the Affair") takes over the role of Clarice Starling, Gary Oldman joins
the cast as the series' ever-present, yet changing, second villain Mason 
Verger, and Oscar winner Anthony Hopkins returns as the titular "Hannibal."</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>In the thirty odd minutes of screen time it takes for Hannibal to make an
appearance, we discover that prison orderly Barney (Frankie R. Faijon, "The
Silence of the Lambs") has been making a buck or two selling Hannibal Lecter
items to a lucrative underground market.  The unfathomably wealthy (home is
the Biltmore Estate, which served as Melvyn Douglas and Shirley Maclaine's
mansion in "Being There") and hideously disfigured Verger is a client of 
Barney's, being the only surviving victim of Lecter's.  Verger is obsessed 
with exacting revenge and is offering a private, three million dollar reward 
for Lecter.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Clarice Starling has become the whipping girl of the FBI after
her high profile drug ring bust results in five deaths, raining bad publicity
upon the Bureau.  Starling's woes have practically been engineered by Justice 
Department official Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta, "Goodfellas"), a corrupt man
in 
cahoots with Verger who puts Starling back on the Lecter case to lure him out 
of the shadows.</P>
<P>Across the Atlantic, Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini, "Swept
Away") meets Dr. Fell, a new library curator, while investigating the
disappearance of his predecessor.  Clarice's work in DC causes a request
to go through Pazzi's offices and he comes to realize the charming Fell is 
the notorious Lecter.  Rather than cooperate with the FBI in his official
capacity, Pazzi, the husband of a much younger, beautiful wife, makes a fatal 
mistake by attempting to reap the monetary reward.</P>
<P>Screenwriters David Mamet ("State and Main") and Steven Zaillian
("Schindler's 
List") have pretty faithfully adapted the Thomas Harris novel for the screen.
Yes, the notorious ending of the novel has been modified somewhat, but the
spirit is essentially the same and Starling's actions are better justified.
Unlike the first film, this Hannibal is presented as a thinner of the herd,
a killer of the rude and greedy.</P>
<P>Hopkins, an actor who can serve up ham (see Coppola's "Dracula"), is once
again note perfect as Dr. Lecter.  The performance accounts for ten years
of laying low while enjoying life's beauty and pleasures.  There's humor in 
this performance (listen to his delivery of 'Okee dokey') as well as menace
(watch him approach Inspector Pazzi, barefoot).</P>
<P>Moore is in a difficult spot reprising Foster's role.  "Silence" was about
Clarice and "Hannibal" is not.  Moore is OK, playing career disillusionment
by seeming tired and washed out, although she does show spark with the 
backbone she presents to male colleagues looking to mow her down.</P>
<P>The uncreditted Oldman is unrecogniable beneath the work of a special effects
makeup team which presents him with a reconstructed face resembling
a Leatherface mask from "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."  Oldman does his
job well, making Verger a more despicable character than Lecter, yet his
diction is too clear for a man with no lips.</P>
<P>The best support comes from Italian mainstay Giannini, who gains sympathy
for his actions and fear for his character as he treads too close, too often 
to a danger he does not comprehend.  Liotta does his best work when he 
gets brainy.</P>
<P>The production is first rate across the board, if not at the masterpiece
level of "Silence."  Where that film used Hannibal's cells as descents into
hell, this film uses motifs of pigeons, boars, and yes, even a lamb.
Location work in Florence is notable, including an original outdoor opera of 
Dante's death.</P>
<P>As a sequel, "Hannibal" may not be up to "The Godfather: Part II" level,
but director Ridley Scott and lead Hopkins have presented us with a buffet
worth lingering over.</P>
