<P>This is the first review I've ever written about a movie that I walked
out after only fifteen minutes. It riled me up so much that I had to
pour out my complaint. This movie purports to be some kind of edgy,
"new wavish" social criticism, but as I will point out, it is simply a
version of Saturday Night Live for the carriage trade.</P>
<P>Tod Solonz wrote and directed "Welcome to the Dollhouse," an "indie"
film just like "Happiness," his sophomore and sophomoric follow-up.
"Welcome to the Dollhouse" focuses on the unhappy life of a homely
high school student and her dysfunctional New Jersey middle class
family. The high school itself is just one cut below the concentration
camp depicted in Lina Wertmuller's "Seven Beauties" in terms of
debasement and physical abuse. As somebody who fled high school at the
tender age of 16 to go off to college, the movie struck a resonant
chord with me. The one thing I did have trouble with was the meanness
of the central character, whose losing ways did not inspire her to
turn against the mainstream. She remained anxious to join the
in-groups even though none of them would accept her. I preferred to
thumb my nose at the jocks and the cheerleaders, no matter how many
times this got me beat up.</P>
<P>Since "Welcome to the Dollhouse" received such glowing reviews (still
worth seeing in video), it must have convinced Solonz to make his next
film more of the same. Much more. In fact, too much more.</P>
<P>"Happiness" begins with a prologue involving one of the female leads
and Saturday Night Live alumnus Jon Lovitz. They are on a date in a
fancy restaurant. She, a plain but not unattractive woman in her
mid-30's has just rebuffed Lovitz. He proceeds to give her a
tongue-lashing, telling her that she is "shit" and that he is
"champagne". She sits there passively accepting his insults. This
exercise in humiliation sets the tone for the remainder of the film,
at least I presume it did since I walked out shortly.</P>
<P>Next we meet the woman's sister, a "successful" housewife married to a
psychotherapist, and living in a spacious suburban house. The sister
picks up where Lovitz has left off and in a conversation with her in
the kitchen tells her how much of a loser she is. The sister listens
to the insults passively.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, we discover that the psychotherapist, who is in
psychotherapy himself, is a closeted homosexual who is about to begin
an incestuous relationship with his pubescent son. In a conversation
between the two, the father explains what it means to "come". The
purpose of the scene is not to reveal complexity of character or to
establish dramatic conflict, but rather to shock a jaded audience in
the manner of "epater le bourgeoisie."</P>
<P>When it finally dawned on me that I was seeing an extended Saturday
Night Live sketch, I decided to walk out. The prologue set the tone
for the rest of the film, even to the extent of including a signature
SNL star Jon Lovitz. In the mid-80s, SNL developed a brand of humor
that went hand-in-hand with the dominant Reagan-era sensibility. It
depicted ordinary Americans, either suburbanites or the urban
underclass, as clueless losers. One was supposed to laugh at the
overweight, unsophisticated, culturally backward masses. If you were a
member of this group, you would laugh at yourself in masochistic
fashion. If you were a "hip" college student with more advanced
sensibilities, you got your pleasure in laughing sadistically at the
masses. This aesthetic eventually was reflected in the Letterman show,
where it was honed to perfection.</P>
<P>With Solonz, you are getting the aesthetic overlaid with an
"underground" sensibility. This is not the college fraternity ambiance
of the SNL or Letterman shows, but the lower east side hipster bars
that Solonz presumably attended while attending NYU film school..
Solonz, born in 1960, seems very much a product of this TV/pop culture
environment. He actually produced a short for Saturday Night Live,
titled "How I Became a Leading Artistic Figure in New York City's East
Village Cultural Landscape" in 1986.</P>
<P>The aesthetic of humiliation that Solonz has fine-tuned is shared by
other young film-makers. You will discover it at work in Neil Labute,
who directed the awful and misogynist "In the Company of Men," a film
that I also walked out of after fifteen minutes. His latest, "Friends
and Neighbors," appears closely related thematically and aesthetically
to "Happiness." Mr. Cranky, one of my favorite film reviewers,
describes this Labute film in the following terms:</P>
<P>"The names [of the cast] are straight from the press packet, since I
don't recall hearing them once in the film, which is LaBute's
simplistic way of reinforcing that 'everyman' quality. Barry is
self-absorbed and dependent. Jerry is self-absorbed and co-dependent.
Cary is self-absorbed and psychotic. Mary is indecisive
non-aggressive. Terri is decisive aggressive. Cheri is non-aggressive
co-dependent. Basically, this all amounts to a movie in which not a
person has a clue about anything, and they are all eager to
demonstrate that point in protracted, never-ending conversation."</P>
<P>Sounds like a Saturday Night Live sketch, right?</P>
<P>What interests me above all is the self-delusion that is at work in
directors like Solonz and Labute. They enjoy the reviews they get from
mainstream publications like the NY Times, which represent them as
"daring" and "experimental." But they are not creating anything which
deserves such adjectives. Instead what they are producing is highbrow
versions of television comedy. Television is the ultimate media of
late capitalism. It has the propensity to debase society while
returning maximum profits to the huge corporations which make the
awful spectacle possible. When you watch a Saturday Night Live sketch,
you get the message that you are a piece of shit while having to sit
through beer commercials for the next dose of abuse and degradation.
We should expect much more from a movie.</P>
