<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Look at the perfect suburban neighborhood, with the perfectly straight
street lined with perfectly spaced trees in front of each perfect home.
Look at the inhabitants of the house with the red door.  They seem to be
a perfectly ordinary family, but look closer.</P>
<P>Father and head-of-the-family Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey, Hurlyburly)
appears to be a normal middle-aged suburbanite.  He drives his Toyota
Camry to his job at Media Monthly Magazine, but if you look closer you
will see a man so broken of spirit that he has no qualms leering at his
teenage daughter's young friends or referring to his daily shower
masturbation session as the highlight of his day.  Lester explains, in
an opening narrative, that he is 42 and will be dead in a year – even
though it feels like part of him has been dying for years.</P>
<P>His wife Carolyn (Annette Bening, In Dreams) is a real estate agent with
a Mercedes SUV and an upbeat outlook on life, not to mention pruning
shears that match her gardening clogs.  Career-wise, Carolyn lives in
the huge shadow of Buddy Kane, the Real Estate King (Peter Gallagher,
The Man Who Knew too Little), whose face adorns park benches and
billboards around the unnamed town.  Look closer at the woman that
forces her family listen to elevator music during dinner each evening,
and you will see a person so afraid of professional and personal failure
that she actually beats herself in the face if she cries.</P>
<P>Lester and Caroline's only child is Jane (Thora Birch, Harrison Ford's
cute little kid in those Tom Clancy movies), a high school student
embarrassed that her lecherous dad will `spray his shorts' if she brings
home any female classmates.  She's a member of the school's pep squad,
but if you look closer, Jane finds herself struggling to escape the
shadow of her popular and brazen best friend (and model wannabe) Angela
(Mena Suvari, American Pie).</P>
<P>No longer able to stomach the daily grind of selling his soul at work,
Lester decides to quit his job and really live his life.  He trades the
Camry for the classic car he always dreamed of having.  He also starts
to work out and smoke pot, finding new employment at a fast food joint
called Smiley Burger – and he has never been happier.  Despite his
newfound euphoria, Lester's family suffers the brunt of the changes
brought upon by his revitalized outlook.</P>
<P>Their problem?  Lester really starts to push the envelope in a world
where you simply can't afford to be plain, but can't do much to really
stand out, either.  And that is the soul of the film.  Most men his age
are content to regale peers with tales of days past when they drove
across the country, stoned like Gonzo and his attorney, with The Allman
Brothers Live at the Fillmore East blaring from the stereo and the wind
whipping through hair they used to have.  Now older, married and
whipped, they are happy to have two minutes alone each day just to pinch
a loaf (or jerk off in the shower).</P>
<P>Not to be outdone by the reigning neighborhood dysfunction champions are
the Burnham's new neighbors, whose move into the vacant house next-door
coincides with Lester's mental collapse.  Their patriarch (Chris Cooper,
October Sky), a military man with a graying brush-cut, introduces
himself to everyone as `Colonel Fitts, U.S. Marine Corps.'  Wife Barbra
(Allison Janney, 10 Things I Hate About You) staggers through life like
a zombie, trying to mask whatever horrors life has previously dealt
her.  Like the Burnhams, the Fitts' have one child – a boy named Ricky
(newcomer Wes Bentley), who has just been released from a mental
institution, sells pot and captures life's quirks on a home video
camera.  Boy, did he move to the right neighborhood.</P>
<P>Likely to draw comparisons to both The Ice Storm and Happiness (all
three are interweaving tales of whacked-out suburban families with major
sexual issues), Beauty is nothing short of perfection.  Spacey has never
been better (plus, he has one of the best spit-takes of this decade) and
Birch is completely amazing for somebody who was in that cinematic opus
Monkey Business.  A role like Jane's would ordinarily be given to a
Christina Ricci or possibly an Anna Paquin, but Birch's performance
easily tops anything that either have done.</P>
<P>The scary part of Beauty (other than the content) is that it's the first
script written by Alan Ball and first picture helmed by Sam Mendes, who
has previously directed Broadway hits Cabaret and the Nicole Kidman
nude-fest The Blue Room.  Mendes' bold direction is technically
brilliant, recalling early efforts of Tarantino or Paul Thomas
Anderson.  Beauty is the kind of film that will reap loads of critical
praise, yet may not light up the box office and be too controversial to
be considered for Oscar nominations.  But it is so good that the Academy
may not be able to ignore it.  (1:52 - R for nudity, strong sexuality,
language, graphic violence and drug content)</P>
