<P>In light of the recent events involving President Clinton and Paula Jones, not
to mention the recent reports of the reemergence of Saddam Hussein, "Wag the
Dog" is as perceptive and realistic a satire as I have ever seen; a dark,
edgily written treatise on politics, Hollywood and the media, and how they are
all interrelated. </P>
<P>"Wag the Dog" starts with a momentous sex-scandal involving the President of
the United States - he apparently had a sexual encounter with an underage Girl
Scout in the Oval Office. Naturally, the nation is on its toes with this
scandal that threatens the upcoming election. Facing a desperate hour, the
White House enlists a spin-control doctor, Conrad Bean (Robert De Niro), to
divert the nation's attention by inventing a war with Albania! To do this,
Conrad gets assistance from a disbelieving presidential aide (Anne Heche), and
a veteran Hollywood producer named Stanley Motss (Dustin Hoffman) - together,
they have to create the appearance of a war by utilizing the power of the mass
media. Motss orchestrates the production by creating a stage where a young girl
(Kirsten Dunst) is supposedly running along the barracks of Albania carrying a
kitten. "Get me a calico kitten," shouts Motss, admitting he's never had this
much fun on a production before. Through a two-day process of computer
animation, some "Anne Frank sirens," and a hand-held camera, a fake war is
unveiled before the public's eyes. As Motss makes clear, "This is nothing. This
is a walk in the park. Have you ever shot in Italy? " </P>
<P>And this is just the beginning. The catch is that for every deceptive
performance they pull, the principals have to promise to never tell anyone, or
they will be killed. The ambitious Motss wants some credit for his work,
though: "The producer never gets any credit. How can you have a movie without a
producer?" Even the young "Albanian" girl can't mention her performance on her
resume - "It's just a pageant," declares Conrad. </P>
<P>"Wag the Dog" is based on the book "American Hero," a fictional chronicle of
George Bush's attempts to create an unwanted war in the Persian Gulf. Is the
movie outrageous and exaggerated, or is it speaking the truth? Considering the
recent events surrounding Clinton's presidency, the movie is so truthful and
acidly written, it is bitingly scary and sad to watch. The movie is basically
saying that the media reports lies, not truths. Of course, we have seen dozens
of movies that showed the corrupt amorality at the core of politics and the
media - we see it every day, from the nightly news intent on reporting bloody
crimes, to "The Jerry Springer Show" that advertises more and more fist fights,
to the absurd overexposure of the Paula Jones case. What "Wag the Dog" does
differently is to show how far politicians and the press are willing to go to
sell their "product," basically yellow journalism, to the American public. The
public will believe anything the media reports to them, so if there's a war
going on with Albania, by golly, they'll buy it. Anything will work as long as
it distracts attention from the President's sexual dalliances. In one of
several attempts to prove their credibility, they concoct an old blues record
called "Old Shoe," which becomes the nickname for a long-lost war hero (Woody
Harrelson) who is actually a psychotic prisoner!</P>
<P>The wonderful cast is first-rate. Dustin Hoffman is excellent as the showy,
nervous, fast-talking producer Motss who recalls the equally pretentious
producer Robert Evans - it is a performance that ranks with Hoffman's best work
in "Midnight Cowboy" and "Rain Man." Robert De Niro brings a smoothness and
calmness that I've not seen him do since "Stanley and Iris"; note the calm
precision by which he utters lines such as, "I'm working on it," or "We'll have
to kill you" with a smile. Watching De Niro and Hoffman perform together is as
pleasurable an experience as I've had in all of 1997. Anne Heche has a less
remarkable role as the presidential aide, but she holds her own with these two
heavyweights, especially during the conference scenes. Kudos must also go to
Woody Harrelson's explosive cameo as the dumb, naive rapist with rotten teeth
who pretends to be a war hero from Albania. It is equally delightful to see
other memorable supporting roles including Willie Nelson as a singer trying to
come up with a theme song for Albania; Denis Leary who is great fun as a slogan
specialist; and there's William H. Macy (a Mamet regular) as an FBI agent who's
curious about the credibility of this war. </P>
<P>"Wag the Dog" is as incisive and tragic a commentary on the amorality and lack
of values in today's media frenzy as Network was. A brilliant script by David
Mamet and Hillary Henkin, superb direction by Barry Levinson, typically
"contrasty" cinematography by Robert Richardson, and expert performances by a
game cast make for one of 1997's finest films. It's unforgettable, saddening,
hilarious, and honest about the manipulation of the media, and how they report
the news as if it was entertaining fodder for the dumb and dumber set. This is
not a film to be ignored. </P>
