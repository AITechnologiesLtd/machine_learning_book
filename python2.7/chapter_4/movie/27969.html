BLOW DRY</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Paddy Breathnach</PRE>
<PRE>Screenplay by Simon Beaufoy</PRE>
<P>With Alan Rickman, Natasha Richardson</P>
<PRE>De Vargas   R     97 min.</PRE>
<P>     The most intriguing thing about this uneven, formulaic British 
comedy is the writing credit:  Based on the Screenplay "Never Better" by 
Simon Beaufoy.  What does this mean?  Beaufoy is the screenwriter 
responsible for The Full Monty, and Blow Dry looks like an early, 
groping draft, with a hairdressing competition substituted for male 
strip-tease. </P>
<P>     If Beaufoy tried to distance himself from this one, it's 
understandable.  The screenplay is manipulative, predictable, and 
uninspired.  What gives it a brush of charm is the talents of its cast.  
Alan Rickman is Phil, a gloomy, embittered barber in the provincial 
Yorkshire town of Keighley.  He has some reason for his bitterness: his 
wife Shelly (Natasha Richardson) left him some ten years earlier to run 
off with another woman, their friend and model Sandra (Rachel 
Griffiths).  They didn't run very far - Sandra and Shelley have a 
hairdressing salon just down the street.  This is awkward for all 
concerned, especially Phil and Shelly's son Brian (Josh Hartnett), who 
works for his Dad and is painfully embarrassed by his lesbian Mom.</P>
<P>     This cozy little world is shaken up by two momentous revelations.  
Shelly has terminal cancer.  And the National British Hairdessing 
Championships are coming to Keighley.  The movie makes very little 
distinction between the emotional importance of these facts, but in plot 
terms the edge goes to the hairdressing competition. </P>
<P>     Phil and Shelly are former champion hairstylists, and Shelly, dying 
as she is, sees the championships as a chance to get the family back on 
speaking terms before she goes to the Great Salon in the Sky.  Phil of 
course will have nothing to do with it, but we don't put any stock in 
that - the question is not if, but when and why, he will come around, 
take up curling iron and blow dryer, and win the event. </P>
<P>     The plot bears no more discussion.  What makes this an 
entertainment worth something close to the price of admission in this 
slow cinematic season is the cast, or at least most of it.  Rickman, 
always a moody cuss, uses his appealing Bassett hound world-weariness to 
great effect; when he allows a smile to crack the dour crust it's like 
sunshine breaking through a gloomy sky.  Richardson uses all her 
considerable charm and skill to make us forget as much as possible the 
dreary plot device she's been saddled with.  Griffiths is good, despite 
an embarrassing scene in which she does a Japanese impression.  Bill 
Nighy (the lead singer in Still Crazy) adds a deliciously conniving 
character as Phil's unscrupulous hairdressing rival, and Warren Clarke 
is funny as the town's showbiz-happy mayor.  And any movie that has 
Rosemary Harris, even in a badly underwritten character, has some claim 
on our affections.  The young folks, imported from Hollywood for teen 
appeal, are a split decision: Hartnett does okay, mastering the 
Yorkshire dialect effectively, but the ingE9nue Rachel Leigh Cook is a =
washout.  Beaufoy's script should have been left in its drawer, and this 
cast used for something better suited to its talents</P>
