<P>Very wrong.  Comedienne Ellen DeGeneres makes her feature-film debut in 
this astonishingly unfunny romantic comedy about a girl who can't get rid 
of a guy.  The male in question is Bill Pullman-- or is it Jeff 
Daniels?-- a well-to-do smoothy who initially sweeps DeGeneres off her 
feet, until his increasingly bizarre behavior labels him as a 
card-carrying member of the Psycho Squad.  Director Nick Castle (DENNIS 
THE MENACE) and writers Chris Matheson, Kerry Ehrin, and Craig Munson 
botch it big-time.  The script isn't tight enough; the tone isn't right 
enough; and the comedy isn't black enough.  (Most disappointing to me: no 
references to that other stalker movie, CAPE FEAR.)  Ms. DeGeneres makes 
a bright impres-sion, sure, but the rest of the cast barely registers.  
Joan Cusack is a loss as Pullman's crazed ex-girlfriend; Dean Stockwell 
makes no impression as the P.I. that Ellen investigates.  And so on.  
Skip it. </P>
