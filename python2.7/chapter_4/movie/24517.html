JAILHOUSE ROCK
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>The author of this review must admit that he was never
particularly big fan of Elvis Presley. The undisputed
musical talent of King and his equally undisputed importance
in the history of modern culture have very little to do with
that. I tend to judge Presley mostly on his movie
appearances, which is most unfair, since his record in that
field, unlike music, wasn't very inspiring, to say the
least. Even JAILHOUSE ROCK, directed in 1957 by Richard
Thorpe and often cited as Presley's best film, could hardly
improve such unflattering impression,</P>
<P>The plot begins when Vince Everett (played by Elvis
Presley), young manual labourer who suffers from temper
tantrums. One of occasions led to the bar brawl that
resulted with his prison sentence for manslaughter. In
prison Everett is put in the same cell with Hank Houghton
(played by Mickey Shoughnessy), former country singer that
couldn't fail noticing the musical talent in his young
cellmate. Hoping for a lucrative partnership, Hank teaches
Everett few tricks that would make him a pop star after
release. Once free, Everett, however, has quite different
ideas and pursues his own career, which practically goes
nowhere until he meets recording industry employee Peggy Van
Alden (played by Judy Tyler). Guided both by the
appreciation of Everett's talent and her feelings towards
the young man, Peggy decides to become his partner and later
witnesses his meteoric rise to fame and fortune. However,
their relationship remains strictly platonic and later
deteriorates when Everett gets seduced by the irresponsible
and decadent lifestyle of a pop star.</P>
<P>The only reason to watch JAILHOUSE ROCK lies in the musical
numbers featuring Presley. However, in order to see them, a
viewer should endure truly horrible script by Guy Trosper
and mediocre direction by Richard Thorpe. Film lacks
coherent plot and looks like a various unfinished films
hastily patched into one. The acting is good, though.
Character actor Mickey Shaughnessy is more than passable in
rather complex role of Everett's mentor and young Judy
Tyler, tragically deceased after the shooting of the film,
is quite charming as Everett's romantic interest. Elvis
Presley here plays surly, arrogant character, closer to his
original image of 1950s youth rebel than his later, more
mainstream incarnations. Quality of his acting is merely
passable but quite adequate for the job, although Presley
looks like someone who could do much better with proper
script. Unfortunately, such better chances never
materialised in his lifetime and watching of this film might
be quite depressive experience for those aware of King's
unfulfilled potentials.</P>
