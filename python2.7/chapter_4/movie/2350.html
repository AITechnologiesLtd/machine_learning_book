<PRE>"I have AIDS."
        - Tom Hanks to Denzel Washington, when asked what happened to his
          face.</PRE>
<P>     PHILADELPHIA is Hollywood's first mainstream AIDS film and how
very mainstream it is.  There are few surprises or enlightenments in
this tasteful examination of the killer disease and its effect on both
the hetero- and homosexual population.</P>
<P>     Tom Hanks stars as Andrew Beckett, a favored young attorney at a
prestigious Philly law firm.  He's also gay and suffering from AIDS--
two facts that he has concealed from his employers.  After Beckett
begins displaying the first visible signs of the disease, he's fired.
His boss (Robards) says it's for incompetence, but Beckett believes
discrimination.</P>
<P>     The ailing attorney seeks counsel, gets several rejections, and,
finally, turns to Joe Miller (Washington)--a flashy, TV-advertising
lawyer who is quite vocal about his disapproval of the gay lifestyle.
Miller is willing to put aside his personal prejudices, however, and go
to court to fight for his dying client's wrongful termination...</P>
<P>     Though an exciting film by Jonathan Demme standards, PHILADELPHIA
is a bit of a bust as AIDS awareness.  Ron Nyswaner's story examines
homophobia from every angle, but offers far less insight into either
the disease or the lifestyle that contributes to it.  Given that the
title character is both gay and AIDS-afflicted, this discrepancy is
rather glaring.  And completely expected.</P>
<P>     PHILADELPHIA doesn't break too much ground.  The material is
treated in a standard, sterile fashion that could hardly threaten any
sensibilities.  Translated into plot specifics, this means virtually no
insight into Beckett's personal life and, essentially, no portrayal of
homosexual intimacy.</P>
<P>     Happily, in the hands of eclectic director Demme, even a
gloss-over doesn't appear glossy.  The director brings believability
and, even, fun to a solemn story.</P>
<P>     Demme is not a smooth filmmaker, by any counts, and PHILADELPHIA
is not a glamorous movie.  He populates Philly like he does all his
films--with characters that look and live like real people.  There no
mansions or storybook homes in Demme's universe.  Only authentic
characters.  And actors.</P>
<P>     Just as he strives to portray reality in all of its diversity,
Demme never lets his audience forget that they're watching a movie.  As
expected, the director peppers his product by rounding-up the usual
suspects.  The result is such seemingly non-sequitur casting as Charles
Napier as the trial judge and Roger Corman as a key witness.</P>
<P>     Move up to the majors and the top roles in PHILADELPHIA are played
equally well.</P>
<P>     Jason Robards is credible in a tough, but one-dimensional role as
Beckett's boss.  Mary Steenburgen shows up at the forty-minute mark
with a fine performance as a sharp defense attorney.  Washington, in
turn, shows off his OWN courtroom cool while making a nice
transformation from bigot to believer.</P>
<PRE>     But PHILADELPHIA is Hanks' show and he's nearly perfect in every
scene.</PRE>
<P>     (That is, with the exception of the film's Intentional Oscar
Moment--an ineffectual bit with Beckett driven to tears while
explaining the beauty of Maria Callas to his attorney.)</P>
<P>     Hanks also *looks* the part, courtesy of some very-real head-shaving
and intentional weight-loss.  His death-bed scenes are nothing short of
scary.</P>
<P>     One interesting/annoying aspect of PHILADELPHIA is the film's
omnipotent point-of-view.  Instead of a story told merely from both
Beckett's and Miller's viewpoint, Demme lets the audience eavesdrop on
EVERY character.  Does the narrative REALLY need the inclusion of such
things as the jury deliberations?</P>
<P>     To the credit of both Demme and writer Nyswaner, PHILADELPHIA
avoids most of the melodrama inherent in the subject matter.  Familiar
cliches, such as The Big Death Scene, have been graciously omitted.</P>
<P>Bottom: As the first mainstream AIDS film, PHILADELPHIA offers few
        surprises or enlightments into the killer disease.  Well
        acted, written, and directed, this tasteful film is more of
        an examination of homophobia than the disease that inspires
        it.</P>
