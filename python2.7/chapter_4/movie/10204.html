                           EXCESS BAGGAGE 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
                3 :-( :-( :-(  for a lug of heavy baggage</PRE>

Thompson, Harry Connick Jr., Nicholas Turturro, Michael Bowen Director:

Frenais</P>
<P>Ever gone on a holiday and suddenly realised that you took only enough
underwear for three days, but you really needed a weeks worth.
Fortunately most holiday retreats have a customer laundry and shops for
the accidental tourist with missing underwear in action. However, in a
movie like EXCESS BAGGAGE where do you turn when the most important
contents, like underwear, suddenly go missing? Missing elements like
passionate romance, witty dialogue, suspenseful action or light hearted
comedy? Surely there must be something worth wearing in this Alicia
Silverstone package. I remain sadly silent. It's like I suddenly woke up
one morning and discovered the world was naked, and I was the only one
wearing clothes and when I took my clothes off, there was nothing to see
underneath.</P>
<P>Like most young men who first saw Ms Silverstone in her starring role as
"Cher" in CLUELESS, I soon fell in love with her lips and the rest of
her body. I know sadly admit that the grand delusion of puppy love is
finally shattered by a ton of excess baggage. The basis of the story is
not too uncommon as wealthy rich girl tries to get attention from Papa
by staging her own kidnapping. She has nothing to complain about except
for the fact that her father has not given her the attention she needed
as a child, but then neither has half the human race. So I do not
sympathise entirely with her situation. However, this is not the
problem. The problem like most bad movies, is what you actually decide
to do with the material.</P>
<P>With romantic comedies, I'm not sure whether it is more difficult to
generate romance or comedy. Having both is like striking gold.
Unfortunately the romance factor in this movie doesn't take off at all.
It becomes hard to believe that this poor little rich girl falls in love
with a scruffy car thief who accident steals the car with her in the
boot. I haven't seen Mr Benicio Del Toro (car thief) act before, but I
think "subzero personality" best describes his character. He carries
that dark fazed look of a drug junky, and mumbles his lines with the
slurred, droll manner of a stoned alcoholic. My question is - is it all
an act or is it really him? If so, is this the sort of character that
attracts girls nowadays? The only reason I'm asking is because this
movie wants us to get all warm and fuzzy when he breathes down Ms
Silverstones neck after downing a bottle of Jack Daniels; and Ms
Silverstone's character isn't much better.</P>
<P>As for the comedy, I don't remember laughing once or hearing anybody
else laugh for that matter. The saddest factor is that Ms Silverstone is
out of her prime material. Gone is that innocent sweet girl that stole
the hearts of a generation of men. So perhaps it will take another
movie, or several more, before I fall in love again.</P>
