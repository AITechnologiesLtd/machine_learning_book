<PRE>UNFORGIVEN</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * * * *</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Clint Eastwood
Written by: David Webb Peoples</PRE>
<P>In the town of Big Whisky, Wyoming, a prostitute has just been sliced up by 
two of her clients. After the local sheriff, Little Bill (Gene Hackman), 
makes the attackers pay only by giving the prostitute's employer some of 
their horses, her friends take matters into their own hands. They pool their 
money and place a bounty of one thousand dollars on the two cowboys, and 
send word out far and wide. William Munny (Clint Eastwood) used to be a 
known thief and murderer. Now he tries to take care of his two children by 
running a pig farm out on the plains. He's approached by The Schofield Kid 
(Jaimz Woolvet), a young gunfighter trying to make a name for himself. The 
kid proposes that he and Munny go to Big Whisky and collect on the bounty. 
Munny has no desire to return to his old ways, but he's failing as a farmer, 
and he needs the money. So Munny agrees on one condition, his old friend Ned 
Logan (Morgan Freeman) be allowed to join them. The three head for Big 
Whisky, The kid eager to make a name for himself, Munny and Logan haunted by 
ghosts from their murderous pasts.</P>
<P>There are some who will no doubt claim Clint Eastwood is biting the hand 
that fed him. They will say he is now slandering the genre that made him a 
star, and for that he should be crucified, stoned, hanged, or worse. I 
completely disagree. I don't believe "Unforgiven" is anti-western, I think 
Eastwood is simply showing a different face to the old west. Be forewarned, 
the face he's showing is a dark, depressing, and sadly realistic one. In 
fact, the entire movie is saturated by a sense of sadness. Watching the film 
on mute, you would still be able to feel the sense of emptiness Eastwood 
brilliantly conveys with his direction. Make no mistake, this isn't an 
action movie. It's a character study, and while the outstanding performances 
add a lot to the film's characters what really makes these people real is 
the way they are written. In David Peoples' ("Blade Runner") script, 
everyone is human. There are no superheroes nor villains, no one's perfect 
and no one's inhuman. Every character makes mistakes, everyone has a 
breaking point, and the sad fact of the matter is, there are no good guys. 
Oh sure, there are protagonists and antagonists, but you can understand 
everyone's motives and actions. In a strange sort of way, you won't want 
anyone to die, not even Little Bill. Yet you'll know, deep in your heart, 
that Bill Munny's words are true: "We all got it comin kid."</P>
<P>One of the best things about "Unforgiven" is the cast. While I'm obviously 
referring primarily to the three main cast members, Eastwood, Freeman, and 
Hackman, the entire supporting cast does a great job as well. To start with, 
we've got Eastwood, the king of westerns himself. Eastwood does an amazing 
job as a man trying to convince himself that he has changed his ways. The 
way he plays William Munny we think this character is really all his past 
characters (Josey Wales, the man with no name, even Dirty Harry) rolled up 
into one, trying to both atone for and forget the things he's done in the 
past. Then we have Morgan Freeman, playing a man too loyal and honest for 
his own good. Freeman brings remarkable depth and intelligence to every 
character he plays, and that has seldom been more true than it is here. 
Finally we have Gene Hackman, giving a performance the likes of which I've 
seldom seen. Hackman makes Little Bill into something much more than just 
another archetypal western villain. Little Bill is already written as having 
a sort of twisted sense of justice, and a dream to do nothing more than work 
on his house (this provides some of the film's few comic moments), but 
Hackman imbues the character with something more. It's hard to describe, and 
I know I can't do it justice here. This performance actually has to be 
witnessed to be appreciated.</P>
<P>You're no doubt wondering if there's any action in the movie. Yes there is, 
but not in the traditional sense. One of the things that most impressed me 
about "Unforgiven" was the way in which Eastwood could film excellent action 
scenes without glamorizing them. In fact, quite the opposite approach was 
taken. For example, there's a scene in which Munny shoots a man from some 
distance off with a shotgun. The hapless fellow crawls behind a rock, 
trailing blood behind him while his friends take cover. There's no pulse 
pounding music here, no war cries from the combatants, only the victim 
crying for water. Finally Eastwood shakes his head sadly and yells out at 
the man's friends, "Will you give him a drink of water for Christ's sake?! 
We ain't gonna shoot!" Even the giant, climactic shoot out at film's end is 
like this (oh come on, you knew there was going to be one). There's nothing 
glorious about the killing, each character simply does what they feel they 
have to do. It's a remarkable achievement by Eastwood, being able to film 
the movie in such a way, and a lot of it has to do with his use of the 
score, by composer and longtime Eastwood collaborator Lennie Niehaus. The 
score is haunting and powerful, but never lively or upbeat. I know that 
sounds bad, but it's remarkably effective. If a loud, uplifting score had 
been written for the gun fights it would have taken something away from 
them. By keeping the music low, or even completely unused during the fights, 
Eastwood makes them much more realistic and saddening.</P>
<P>When I first saw "Unforgiven" back in '92, I dismissed it as a good, if 
overrated, western about growing old. I saw it again about two years later 
and dismissed it again, but decided it wasn't about growing old, it was 
about vengeance and not being able to escape ones past. I watched it for the 
third time about a month ago, and I'm still haunted by it. There's something 
powerful and moving about this film that, try as I might, I can't put my 
finger on. It manages to interweave not only the two story arcs I described 
above, but dozens more into a film that has a rightful place on my personal 
100 best of all time list. Those who shove the film away as just another 
western, or try to place a similar restrictive title on it do so at their 
own risk. Don't take this movie lightly, and don't ignore it or you're doing 
yourself a great disservice. I know it seems like a long film, running 131 
minutes, but I was so involved I didn't even notice the time going by. I'd 
recommend "Unforgiven" to everyone, whether you like westerns or not, and 
give it a full five out of five stars.</P>
