                       A film review by Jonathan Curiel

<P>Six good reasons to rush out and see Himalaya, a film that director Eric
Valli describes as a "Tibetan Western":</P>
<P>1) No Brad Pitt.  Valli worked on the Brad Pitt film Seven Years in
Tibet, which showcased Pitt and his pathetic German accent trekking the
Himalayas and befriending the Dalai Lama.  Instead of the overpaid,
perfect-toothed Pitt, we get real people from Nepal portraying
themselves, in roles that demand good acting and a credible screen
presence.</P>
<P>2) Unspoiled Tibetan culture.  While Tibet has been occupied by China
since 1950, Nepal has maintained the integrity of its borders,
especially in the remote northwest region of Dolpo, where Tibetan
Buddhism has thrived side-by-side with Indian Hinduism and other
non-Western influences.  Refugees from Tibet are prominent in Himalaya,
as are a bona fide monk and other Dolpo men, women and children with
tangible ties to an ancient homeland.</P>
<P>3) Biblical-looking peaks covered in snow.  Spending $8.50 to see
Himalaya is cheaper (and less exhausting) than flying to Katmandu and
bussing it to the base of the highest mountains in the world.  Climbing
those majestic peaks would take weeks.  With Himalaya, we are
transported there via celluloid for 104 minutes and treated to vistas
that have inspired generations of people around the world.</P>
<P>4) Yaks.  Lots and lots of yaks.  Himalaya is what you might call a yak
movie -- indeed, it's a Tibetan Western of sorts.  Dolpo's annual yak
caravan is the center of the film, showing off the herd of animals that
transport pounds and pounds of white salt to the lowlands.  The grueling
downward trek is vital to the Dolpopas' existence, letting them exchange
the salt for grain and other necessities.</P>
<P>5) Gripping storyline.  Though the film is closely based on reality
(Valli lived in Dolpo for years), Himalaya isn't a documentary -- it's a
fictionalized account of life among the Dolpopas, which means the movie
has death, romance, revenge, chaos, and emotional contours.  The
characters named Tinle and Karma dominate the film, giving it a friction
that sustains Himalaya for the full 104 minutes.  Tinle (Thinlen
Lhondup) is an old chief who blames Karma (Gurgyon Kyap) for his son's
death.  When Karma wants to embark on an early caravan, ignoring the
date set by ancient ritual, Tinle turns him down.  Karma takes his herd
anyway, followed four days later by Tinle and his entourage.  Dueling
caravans create powerful drama on Nepal's stormy mountaintops.</P>
<P>6) Viscerally moving soundtrack.  The songs that accompany Himalaya
(original work by Bruno Coulais) feature Tuva-like throat singing,
fragments of whispers, chants and shouts, orchestral chimes and strings,
and dreamy melodies that -- by themselves -- are worth the price of
admission.</P>
<P>The bottom line: Seeing Himalaya is to bear witness to a proud and rich
people.  Valli, who divides his time among Katmandu, Paris, and Los
Angeles, is a longtime National Geographic photographer who made several
documentaries before tackling this full-length feature film.  Here he
has made the type of movie that could -- and should -- be made more
often by the studios.  Applaud him.</P>
