<P>"Small Time Crooks" (2000) **1/2 (out of four)</P>
<PRE>Directed by Woody Allen
Written by Woody Allen</PRE>
<P>Starring Woody Allen, Tony Darrow, Hugh Grant, George
Grizzard, Jon Lovitz, Elaine May, Michael Rapaport,
Elaine Stritch, and Tracey Ullman.</P>
<P>In Small Time Crooks, writer/director/star Woody Allen
heavily depends on irony to provide big time laughs.
In the beginning it works. A thief who hates the
thought of owning too much money, a plan made by a
couple to energize their relationship ends up
seriously endangering it. It's original, unpredictable
fun…at first. But after a while, Allen throws so many
ironic situations into the simple plot, it inevitably
becomes annoying and ultimately unfunny. What starts
out as a pleasant light comedy complete with a rapid
fire of fresh jokes and characters, ends in a dull,
monotonous manner that must end immediately. The film
just loses steam a third of the way through. </P>
<P>Don't miss the first ten minutes of Small Time Crooks
or else you'll miss all of the excitement. Woody Allen
plays Ray "The Brain," a dishwasher (with a sarcastic
nickname) who used to be a thief before going to jail
for two years. But imprisonment did not change Ray. He
has his eyes on a bank and with the help of three
neurotic friends, he plans on robbing it, splitting
the money, then going to Florida. Renting out a store
half a block away from the bank, Ray's master plan is
to drill an underground passageway from the store to
the vault. In order to make the situation not look
suspicious, Ray begs his wife to act as a cover by
selling cookies in the store as the guys drill
downstairs. Ironically, the "cookie store"
unexpectedly becomes a popular and lucrative shop - so
popular that it makes them millionaires without having
to rob anything. The trouble is Ray and his wife, now
harshly thrown into the world of the high class, feel
uncomfortably out of place. Small Time Crooks dies
down just after the couple becomes rich. Except for a
few scenes, it's not worth seeing.</P>
<P>Competing this weekend against a totally different
kind of comedy, Road Trip, this one is more dialogue
driven and should attract older viewers. It's simple
and innocent storytelling (the movie is rated PG) is
reminiscent of older films and you have to tip your
hat to a writer who can make a movie funny without a
semen joke. I just expected Small Time Crooks to be
funnier, especially compared to the opening thirty
minutes when something actually happens. </P>
<P>Two things almost saved this movie from eventual doom.
First, the cast does a brilliant job. Woody Allen and
Tracey Ullman are perfect for their roles; the
chemistry they share is especially unique - whenever
together they incessantly argue and deride but you can
still sense that they love each other. And with their
equally whiny and high-pitched voices ringing together
in a chaotic form of harmony, it's obvious this is a
match made in heaven. The supporting cast does a
fantastic job of playing a slow-witted but amiable
bunch. Michael Rapaport, Jon Lovitz, and Tony Darrow
are very funny as Ray's "we-didn't go to high school"
partners in crime. The only problem is that this trio
is terribly underused; they completely disappear after
the satisfying first act and we never hear from them
again.  Elaine May is a scene-stealer as Frenchy's
cousin who according to Ray is as dumb as a cow or a
dog. She delivers the most laughs with her inane
comments and questions, and the dumbfounded look
plastered on her face throughout is classic. The only
complaint regarding the cast is Hugh Grant. Being one
of the only other major characters in the final
two-thirds of the movie, Grant faces the burden of
having to fill the shoes of Ray's friends. He is
neither funny nor emotional and, supposedly playing
the bad guy, he isn't too convincing.  </P>
<P>The second near-rescue effort from failure is small
but crucial. Small Time Crooks has one of the few
trailers in a long time not to give very much away
from the movie's plot. Thanks to that, there was a bit
of unpredictability that made watching a little more
interesting. But not interesting enough to recommend. </P>
<PRE>Grade: **1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
