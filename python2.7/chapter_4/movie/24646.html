<P>Don't go into this movie looking for a "good time", cause that's not what
this film is about. Of course, if they had billed this flick as the story of
three men going on and on about God, life and their jobs in a hotel room for
ninety minutes, I doubt the line-ups would be straddled around the block.
You can also forget the subtle hipness of GLENGARRY GLENROSS or the black
humor of AMERICAN BEAUTY, despite the commonality of the sales racket as its
setting, and the re-assessment of one's life, the main course on the menu.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Three salesmen, one quick and honest, one young and religious, and one tired
and fed up of the whole thing, prepare to spend a night entertaining clients
in a hotel room, while they await the arrival of the "big kahuna" (the big
lead). Despite this setup, the film is actually more about the interaction
between the three men, their inner thoughts, feelings and issues.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Talkity-talkity-talkity...this film basically takes place in one room, with
three solid actors babbling away about a lot of stuff that's funny and
interesting, and other stuff that is just slow and repetitive. I actually
had to "tune out" for a few minutes while some of the conversation went back
and forth and back again, only to regain my composure, and re-establish my
connection to the characters. Admittedly, I saw this film while I was pretty
sleepy, so that definitely might've played a factor in the game, but this
certainly is no nail-biter or tension-filled piece, by any stretch of the
imagination. In fact, it's actually more like a play (based on one), with
three characters basically ping-ponging a diverse lot of subjects back and
forth, with the crux of the story centering around the one young man's
progression into the sales game/adulthood. The actors all do formidable
jobs, with Spacey clocking in his usual fast-talking, smart aleck with a lot
of the funnier written lines. Facinelli, definitely one to watch for in the
future, delivers a solid showing as the ultra-straight mid-westerner who's
still wading in a mini-pool of naiveté. And DeVito, who I personally have
been pretty critical against over the past few years, essentially razzing on
his staple performances in various two-bit productions, actually stretches
his thespianatic muscles for a change, and delivers one of the deeper roles
of his career. You can't help but feel the poor bastard's pain all over the
place. Pretty rough.</P>
<P>The film on the whole is actually kind of uneven, with the first thirty
minutes or so concentrating more on the hip one-liners and straight-talking
sales bullshit, while the second half seriously switches into a high
existential mode. Psychology students could have a field day with this film,
with each of the prime players going through some kind of head-trip or
another during the film's quick ninety minutes. Of course, it is ultimately
DeVito's character who seems to anchor the gang's frustration, with just
enough resolve left in his heart to do something about the situation. But
even then, the game is played out mostly in the mind of the viewer. Plot is
actually secondary in this film, with the "big kahuna" dopplegangering as
the big client for whom the boys await, and the mid-life crisis which
DeVito's character is seemingly going through. All in all, this film is to
be suggested to those who enjoy the plotless, deep character studies rife
with conversations on top of conversations, on top of a few more
conversations. But I certainly wouldn't recommend this to anyone really
looking for an interesting "story", which this film only eludes to, or
tension, suspense and drama, three other noticeably absent members of this
film. Like actors and theatre in general? Then see it. Don't enjoy "talky"
movies and think theatre is "boring"? Skip this puppy or wait till video.
That way, you could fall asleep and nobody'll be the wiser.</P>
