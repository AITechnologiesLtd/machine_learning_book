<P>Attempting to adapt Frank McCourt's beloved bestseller Angela's Ashes is
a heck of an undertaking.  I'm not sure that many filmmakers would be
able to pull it off at all, let alone be able to present a decent
finished version to the teeming masses that devoured McCourt's
autobiography.  But Alan Parker and his crew show that they were more
than up to the challenge, and their bleak and haunting film will
certainly satisfy the appetite of Angela's rabid readers.</P>
<P>Like the book, Ashes starts with the impoverished McCourt family living
in a dank, muddy, rain-soaked tenement in New York City.  Unable to make
ends meet in the new world, the family high-tails it back to Limerick,
Ireland, leaving young five-year-old Frank and his family in the rare
position of waving `goodbye' to the Statue of Liberty.  Unfortunately,
Limerick was the only place in the world danker, muddier and rainier
than New York's slums.  In fact, the film depicts the housing in New
York and Limerick almost identically – old, decaying stone structures
threatening to crush the feeble hopes and dreams of anyone that dare
enter.</P>
<P>Frank's parents almost seem like caricatures, with mum Angela (Emily
Watson, Cradle Will Rock) barely able to muster enough energy to keep
spreading her legs and popping out kids, and dad Malachy (Robert
Carlyle, The World is Not Enough), an on-the-dole drunkard that can
neither hold down a job nor win the favor of his in-laws that despise
the fact he's a Protestant from Northern Ireland.  Frank starts out as
the oldest of four boys, but the McCourts gain and lose kids at such an
amazing pace, it's hard to keep track of the exact number at any given
point in the film.  It probably wasn't until the Kennedys burst on to
the scene that a more tragic family existed.</P>
<P>While you've probably seen dirt poor ‘30s families portrayed in film
before, Ashes kicks it up a couple of notches.  The McCourts are so poor
that they don't have a pot to piss in; they use a bucket.  Their first
floor is constantly underwater, and their neighbor's sewage ran down the
drainpipe outside their ramshackle abode.  Each family member is so
caked in filth and has so much dirt under their fingernails that you'll
want to go home and scrub your fingers raw while sitting in a steaming
hot tub as soon as you get home.</P>
<P>The story follows Frank's life from age five to sixteen, when he
returned to the United States.  In between, he suffered from hunger,
typhoid and conjunctivitis.  Frank is played by three different young
actors (Joseph Breen, Ciaran Owens and Michael Legge) and each does a
fine job looking destitute and downcast.  Watson and Carlyle contribute
to the film's acting pedigree, but the majority of Ashes' magic occurs
behind the camera.</P>
<P>Although Parker hasn't made a film since Evita, he shows that he is
still one of the most talented directors today.  Parker's script, which
he co-wrote with Oscar and Lucinda's Laura Jones, does a good job
incorporating the major points of  McCourt's novel into the film without
keeping it from getting too out of hand.  Cinematographer Michael
Seresin, who worked on Parker's earlier (and considerably darker) films
like Birdy and Angel Heart, and six-time Oscar nominee and longtime
Parker editor Gerry Hambling both do an amazing job at creating a very
realistic Depression era.  If the poignant images don't get to you, John
William's score swells in enough of the right places to all but
guarantee a lump in your throat.</P>
<P>2:25 – R for adult language, some mild adult situations and the
realistic portrayal of a dirt-poor family</P>
