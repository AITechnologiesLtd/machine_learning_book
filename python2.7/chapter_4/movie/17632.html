THE DEAD ZONE
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>Works of Stephen King are the clearest examples of good
literature being basis for bad or mediocre movies. Most
popular and influential contemporary horror writer in
America had seen almost all of his works adapted either for
films or for television. But in most cases, all those works
were mediocre, disappointing at best, or sometimes even
downright awful. Not even the talents of reputed directors
like Carpenter could save King's work. One of those talents
was David Cronenberg, Canadian director who had made
reputation with his inventive, yet disturbing and extremely
gory horrors in 1970s and early 1980s. THE DEAD ZONE, his
1983 adaptation of Stephen King's novel represents one of
his first departure from the horror genre.</P>
<P>The plot revolves around Johnny Smith (played by Christopher
Walken), mild- mannered English teacher that lives a normal
life and is just to be married to his beautiful girlfriend
Sarah (played by Brooke Adams). His life is shattered to
pieces when he becomes a victim of a terrible traffic
accident. Awaken from coma after five years, he finds that
he had lost his job, girlfriend and ability to walk without
a limp. But he gained something else in return - psychic
ability to have visions about someone's past and future. At
first it looks like a gift, but Johnny soon realizes that
all his visions concern death, violence, pain and misery.
Johnny shields himself from world, unsuccessfully trying to
get his old life back as a home tutor. In the meantime, Greg
Stillson (played by Martin Sheen), ambitious politician,
shows no scruples in his unstoppable campaign for U.S.
Senate.</P>
<P>On the surface, THE DEAD ZONE looks like a very good film,
one of the better Stephen King's adaptations. The story is
interesting, pace is good and Cronenberg is this time more
interested in characters and settings than blood or gore.
The atmosphere is also fine, with a clear contrast between
snowy, fairytale American Northeast and dark secrets that
lie within their inhabitants (the exception is sometimes too
monotonous musical score by Michael Kamen). Unfortunately,
what this film lack is coherence. Instead of clear plot we
have whole bunch of subplots patched together. The result
looks like a multi-part mini-series being edited into
feature film. The subplot that had the potential to be most
intriguing comes too late - somewhere in the last third of
the film. Until then viewer had been exposed to many
interesting storylines, all of them being dealt adequately,
but not enough to gather our attention. Interesting
characters, played by small army of very capable actors,
come and go without an apparent reason. One of those
storylines, for examples, is subplot dealing with serial
killer - its implausible, yet on the other hand predictable
resolution is probably the weakest part of the film; it also
provided some really gratutitous nudity and violence.</P>
<P>The actors in this film are rather good. Christopher Walken,
one of the most prolific character actors in contemporary
American cinema, is here in rare opportunity to play not
only the lead, but a good guy too. His minimalistic approach
is perfect for the role of the normal man who is constantly
tormened, first by the loss of his previous life, than by
the powers that force him to abandon human contact, and,
finally, with the greatest responsibility someone has to
imagine. His talent sometimes helps us to forget some of the
really dreadful lines provided by not too inspired
screenwriter Jeffrey Boam. On the other side is Martin Sheen
that sometimes goes too far playing the role of egomaniac
without scruples. Tom Skerrit as Sheriff Bannerman is good,
but he spends too little time on screen. Same is with
Herbert Lom as Doctor Weizak, who is very impressive and who
happens to deliver the most effective dialogue in the movie.</P>
<P>With an impressive atmosphere, good acting and some rather
interesting issues raised in the last segment, THE DEAD ZONE
still remains very good film. Unfortunately, it also leaves
the viewer with the impression that it could have been much
better. But, considering the really bad record with Stephen
King's adaptations, sometimes we must satisfy ourselves with
the less than stellar material.</P>
<P>(Special note to x-philes: William B. Davis, who later
became household name with his portrayal of Cigarette
Smoking Man in THE X-FILES, could be seen in this film in a
small role of ambulance driver.)</P>
