<P>Al Pacino's first movie as a director is an original, mesmerizing
exploration. The Richard of the title is Shakespeare's character Richard
III as well as the eponymous play. Pacino has made a documentary about a
stage production-in-progress, one that involves himself as director and as
actor in the title role, plus a host of other people: performers in this
production as well as performers not in it, but who have experience with
Shakespeare and opinions to share; writers; producers;  consultants;
scholars... the list is long. It even includes people casually met on the
street and who are queried about Shakespeare or their lack of knowledge of
the Bard. (Many amusing reactions occur).</P>
<P>You don't have to look closely to realize that this labor of love is a
busman's holiday. It must have occupied free snatches of time over a period
of years. There are clues to this, such as the changing looks of some
participants, the presence of actress Viveca Lindfors who died in 1995, or
the Pacino's hirsuteness that can differ from one scene to the next.</P>
<P>What  Pacino and Company try to do is to unscramble Richard III by
approaching it with as much understanding and as many insights as possible.
The result is a crazy quilt that explains, elucidates, discusses,
simplifies or sometimes complicates matters as they crop up. This may have
been like haphazard patchwork so far as the filming goes, but the excellent
and very hard editing has given hidden logic and relatively coherent
structure to this fascinating chaos.</P>
<P>>From the start, the method in the madness becomes apparent. "Now is the
Winter of our discontent" is analyzed and explained in terms of the War of
the Roses, the Yorks and Lancasters. Later the iambic pentameter is
illustrated (as a response to  Pacino's falsely naive question) via amusing
da-da-dee-dums.</P>
<P>A refrain pops up often, to the effect that "this is a very complicated
play," which it is,  not only for the director and the actors but for
audiences, especially lay, what with the many characters in a dedalus of
ambitions, real or false alliances, overt or covert enmities, and the maze
of history as Shakespeare saw it. So far as I remember, the word "complex"
is used either little or not at all, and rightly so: the play which is
there are either few or no mentions of "complex,"  in the discussions, and
rightly so.</P>
<P>The text is submitted to deconstruction, from which hang the
interpretations ,so that Shakespeare becomes attainable and more
"enjoyable" from artistic,esthetic,poetic,psychological and historical
points of view. The result is that staggering genius of the Bard is better
felt and comprehended yet, in a paradoxical way, even more mysterious. And
even though sometimes scholars are pitted against players, there is a
common ground of admiration for the playwright.</P>
<P>As Pacino says ( I imagine this applied to both actors and audiences), "You
don't have to understand every word. You get the gist of it." This brings
me to "Looking for Richard" as a film for non-native-English speaking
audiences. It was shown at Cannes last spring,where it was complimented,
but I have my doubts as to the comprehension of it via subtitles. The
language of Shakespeare plus the vernacular of the discussions require
linguistic familiarity. They make of "Looking" the opposite of silent
movies and their universality through images and simple intertitles.</P>
<P>On the other hand, thanks to the back-and-forth shifts between stage,
backstage and real life, the mechanisms of stagecraft are so unveiled that
the effect is one pure Brechtian distanciation, reinforced (for some
viewers) by Richard becoming a precursor of the villain in the parable by
Bertolt Brecht "The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui," in which a gangster
gains power in Chicago.</P>
<P>There are several views of what the purpose of "Looking" is. One opinion is
that Pacino, who has distinguished himself on the stage (including many
performances as Richard), was anxious to prove his theatrical skills to the
wide public that knows only the movie side of him. This may be the case,
but would that such polite vanity were more common and result in many more
"intellectual" and literate movies!</P>
<P>Another belief holds that "Looking"  is an introduction to Shakespeare
which, by stressing the humanity of the performers and demystifying
"difficulties" makes the play accessible to neophytes. I cannot share this
perception. It seems to me that a beginner, the street-person as it were,
or a young student, may identify with or at least recognize certain
universals in the Bard, but will not get the full impact. I believe that,
willy-nilly, Pacino is talking to the already converted -- though not
necessarily the specialists -- whose eyes will open more both to
Shakespeare's work and to the actors'.</P>
<P>I also see "Looking" as a direct-approach (and subsequent choices in
editing) work  of the cinema-verite school,  a documentary about a play
that, in its day, was, in its action and plot (though not its language) a
precursor of a  "film noir," with its dark moods, twists, murders and
treasons.</P>
<P>What we see of the "finished" Richard III is only a fraction of the
stage-play. It comes to us in fragments, yet cleverly shows a number of
telling, full episodes, such as the murders of Clarence and of Hastings or
the killing of the Princes in the Tower -- all riveting, all powerfully
suspenseful and touching.</P>
<P>Among the many bonuses of the film is its healthy discussion of the
American feeling of inferiority vis-a-vis the British when it comes to
doing Shakespeare, a feeling that lies a great deal in differences of
accents and intonations. I only wish someone had mentioned that the
performers of Shakespeare's day did not speak BBC or Oxbridgian English!</P>
<P>Here, not one actor falls into the trap of trying to sound ersatz-British,
nor, happily, does anyone have a regional accent, whether from  Brooklyn,
the South, the West or New England. It all comes down to a convincing
demonstration that Americans can deal with Shakespeare without having to
tend apologies.</P>
<P>If anyone had been told that Pacino would employ familiar movie people
(Kevin Spacey,Adan Quinn,Alec Baldwin, Winona Ryder and others), the first
reaction would have been "How incongruous!" if not "How dumb!" Yet, in
spite of this novelty of casting, those performers are surprisingly good
and convincing. If nothing else, "Looking"  revolutionizes our
preconceptions, our expectations and widely-held beliefs that our own movie
actors cannot shift from screen to stage the way the British have been
doing for close to one century, to their advantage and to the benefit of
both media.</P>
<P>The experienced Pacino plays with a great deal of nuances as he searches
for "his" Richard. Sometimes, like the movie Pacino (say, the son of
Godfather Brando), he is hollow-eyed, contained and menacingly quiet. But
often too he reclaims his Italian-American ancestry and the passion that
goes into flamboyant outbursts.</P>
<P>The atmosphere of the film is one of fascinating peeps into the
collaborative nature of plays. This is not devoid of humor. For example,
Kevin Spacey, whether as a civilian or in costume, maintains a delightful
look of skepticism or irony. Pacino shows a big, heavy book, "The Annotated
Shakespeare" and puns on "The Anointed Shakespeare." And when King Edward
finally dies, he lies in state with coins over his eyes, like a Mafioso
Capo.</P>
