<PRE>Victory, what victory?</PRE>
<P>Based on the novel set in 1914 by Joseph Conrad, Victory spins a tale
of a pair of lovers, Heyst (William Dafoe) and Alma (Irene Jacob),
who seek refuge on Heyst's isolated island. However, their idyllic world
begins to crumble upon the arrival of Mr Jones (Sam Neil), Martin Ricardo
(Rufus Sewell) and their servant, Pedro (Graziano Marcelli), who have
come to steal Heyst's rumoured plunder. While the novel is largely 
complex
in characterization, the   film sadly transposes Conrad's characters into
lacklustre leads, the most disappointing being Heyst himself.</P>
<P>Conrad's Heyst adheres religiously to his late father's ways of 
detachment
and isolation. His ascetic lifestyle is thrown into question when he 
meets
Alma, a helpless orchestra girl who charms him with her voice. The 
struggle
 to embrace the arrival of Alma into his solitude, however, is lost in 
Mark
Peploe's (director and writer) diluted version of Heyst. Without properly
establishing the crucial details of Heyst's character, all that is left 
of
Conrad's main character is a very shallow treatment of his internal 
conflict
 between detachment and human involvement. On the one hand, actualizing
the subtext is a mammoth task (though not impossible), but on the other
 hand, Dafoe's flat acting cannot be excused as an attempt at stoicism. 
In the
end, we are supposed to witness Heyst renounce his philosophy and finally
come to an understanding of what it is to love another. The final
transformation, while perceptible, lacks the cathartic revelation
which is undeniable in Conrad's novel. Its absence in the film is 
unforgivable.</P>
<P>The film seems more concerned about moving the plot along when so
much has yet to be said about the relationship between the two complete
strangers. Alma is supposed to have overcome great emotional barriers
in the relationship, namely Heyst's underlying philosophy of detachment,
which Heyst himself grapples with. The struggle against Heyst's ignorance
of true human involvement accounts for much of the greatness of Alma's 
love
for him. Jacob, fair-skinned, gentle and yet passionate, handles the role
with precision, detailing nuances where possible. Unfortunately, she is 
let
down by a superficial script. The couple's relationship develops too
hastily, leaving all subtlety effaced and replaced with a blatant 
show-and-tell
 approach.</P>
<P> All we know of the characters are mostly explained by their lines alone.
This is unsatisfactory when so much of the turmoil experienced by the two
stem from their buried thoughts and emotions. The sketchy handling of 
their
relationship stands out as sorely as Dafoe's American accent (an
inappropriate one since Heyst spent most of his life in London).</P>
<P>The other characters such as Schomberg (Jean Yanne), the owner
 of a hotel, and Mr Jones (Sam Neill) , also fall short of Conrad's
meticulous characterization. While Schomberg should have been more
 menacing and vindictive, Mr Jones should have been portrayed as 
something
 more of an enigma. Sam Neil's caricature of a slightly stout, effeminate
and soft-spoken gentleman-at-large nullifies the effect intended by
 Conrad who describes Mr Jones as "an insolent spectre on leave from
Hades, endowed with skin and bones and a subtle power of terror".</P>
<P>Poor characterization aside, kudos goes to Rufus Sewell for his excellent
portrayal of Ricardo, secretary to Mr Jones, a reckless  ruffian capable 
of
murder. Sewell, with his cockney accent and large expressive green eyes,
becomes the true terror of the unholy trinity, masterminding deceitful 
plans
behind Jones' back.  At the same time, we are entertained by the 
foolhardiness
of his plans.</P>
<P>Despite the authentic setting and marvellous cinematography by Bruno De
 Keyzer, very few images are left behind for us to savour after the film
has ended. Sourabaya and its surrounding islands and volcanoes may have
their charm, but mean nothing once the film fails to capture the essence
of an epic, which is what Victory deserves to be. The delicately
 inter-woven complexities in the love story are lost to an inadequate
production. At the end of the film, we are told that perhaps Alma's
 victory was in teaching Heyst how to love. A hollow victory indeed.</P>
<P>THE FLYING INKPOT's rating system:
 * Wait for the video.
 ** A little creaky, but still better than staying at home with Gotcha!
 *** Pretty good, bring a friend.
 **** Amazing, potent stuff.
 ***** Perfection. See it twice.</P>
