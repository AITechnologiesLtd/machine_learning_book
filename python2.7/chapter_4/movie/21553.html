<P>I must make a confession right off the bat: this review will be partially
tainted by my bias against thrillers. I don't know what I was thinking
when I decided to review this movie; as strong a Short Black Chick as I
am, I have an extremely weak stomach--and "The Bone Collector" sorely
tested me. Sad to say, I failed the test; not only did I get physically
ill, I cried at the end--and not because this flick was a tear-jerker (it
wasn't, by any stretch of the imagination). All this to say, you must take
my rating with the grain of salt that this most def wasn't a Bammer Flick
to begin with. However, I temper that statement by saying that, genre
elements aside, there are other factors in this movie that I was able to
be as objective as possible about, so don't discount what you're about to
read below just because I needed some Serious Therapy after watching
"Bone".</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: some spoilers contained below):
Link Rhyme (Washington) was a Top-Notch NYPD Forensics cop and true-crimes
writer, a Criminologist in the true sense of the term, until his career
(and almost life) is cut short when a huge beam falls on him during a
crime scene investigation. Paralyzed almost completely ("except for one
finger, my shoulders, my head, and my mind"), he is still able to use his
sharp mind and remain on the active duty roster, even from his
hi-teched-out apartment--but he fears the seizures he experiences will
leave him in a vegetative state. He makes a pact with Dr. Lehman (Hickey),
against the wishes of his health care worker, Thelma (Latifah), to
disconnect the health monitors that Richard Thompson (Orser) installed, if
that ever happens.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, on the other side of town...Officer Amelia Donaghy (Jolie)
discovers a gruesome crime scene, which she valiantly protects by stepping
in front of a moving train to stop it from disturbing the evidence.
Catching wind of her balls-y actions, Rhyme enlists her reluctant help,
along with Top-Notch police chemist Eddie Ortiz (Guzman) and Det. Paulie
Sellitto (Ed O'Neill), to stop a sadistic serial killer in his
tracks--much to the dismay of ObAsshole Capt. Howard Cheney (Rooker). But
who is the killer, and why is he committing such gruesome murders?</P>
<P>The Upshot: 
After watching "Bone", I know the "who". It's the "why" that makes me
shake my head with wonder at the lengths movie-makers will go through to
try to "entertain" their audience; or more bluntly, to get the duckets
rollin' in.</P>
<P>Oh, it started evenly enough. If you're into that sorta thing, the gory
thriller aspects were, literally, right out of the book; "Freddie Kruger"
and pals ain't got nuthin' on this crew. I Felt Amelia's Pain when she
said she couldn't handle dealing with the gore the killer left behind, but
had to; I wanted to bolt from the theater many times myself, but I made
the commitment to do this review, and (with my husband's help) forced
myself to look at the screen through my disgust at the nastiness involved.
But my disgust at the plot holes...well, that's a different story (I'll
come back to this in a moment).</P>
<P>For the most part, the actors were adequate, if not good, in their roles.
As foine as Washington is (and more to the point, as good an actor as he
is), he was restrained in this role, out of the necessity of having to act
the part of a totally paralyzed cop. All the gadgets and gizmos in the
room couldn't help him bring more...oompf...to this role; it makes me
wonder how a real quadriplegic actor would've handled it. Still, he wasn't
bad, per se, and during the next-to-last scene (the one that caused my
tension-related cry), he was quite good in what must have been a difficult
part for him to play (oh yeah; my co-reviewer--my husband, Bear--wanted me
to mention the sense of humor Denzel displayed, specifically when he joked
about Jolie's character being in trouble for "molesting the handicapped".
This, of course, must be seen in context to be fully understood). Jolie
was, I think, the better of the two leads; subtly beautiful (I was struck
by the way she looked good without trying to), more akin to "Homicide's"
Kay Howard than Renee Shepard [that one's for you, Jhim], I found her
believable in her role as a Street Cop With Skeletons. Guzman is one of
those great character actors who you always notice, but can never remember
his name. His easy sense of humor and firm grasp of his role made his
character stand out from the background, as did (surprisingly) O'Neill's
Sellitto, and mah gurl Queen Latifah (in Yet Another Role as an aide; but
that seems to be her speed, so I won't sweat it). And the camera work,
hilited in the rain-falling-down shots, as well as a brilliant, MTV-esque
sequence that moved with lightning speed from a street scene up to Rhyme's
apartment, was quite effective (though they went to the rain well once too
many times).</P>
<P>The shortcuts that were taken by the writer and director, though, were
what turned me off, almost as much as the nature of the film itself.
Though Rooker has a history of playing the ObligatoryAsshole, there was no
sense of backstory to show why his assholiness was so assholy, here;
surely, movie writers, there must be one New York Police Captain who isn't
"a living monument to ineptitude", eh? These kind of characters, stoopid
without cause, are just too through. And before I forget, what's up with
having those characters jump into a New York river on "November 9th" (as
the writer, for ghod knows what reason, had Thelma point out)--only to
come out basically dry, and more to the point, not suffer from at least
minor hypothermia? Man, I hate it when the strings show like that.</P>
<P>But the biggest crime comes in the form of the killer himself, the
"motivation" given as the reason he did what he did, and as the movie went
on, the "aha's" to the clues the killer left. It felt as if two writers
worked on this movie: one that handled the killer and Rooker characters,
another that took care of everything else. And the final insult was the
pasted-on final scene that DID NOT FIT the flow of the rest of the movie;
there was an audible "huh?" in the theater. There was one good though
about it, though: it shook the chill that pervaded my body during the
scene that preceded it, right off me.</P>
<P>The "Black Factor"    [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
In my review of "The Best Man", I spoke of "color indifference", the
mindset that, specific cultural issues aside, many experiences are
universal, and don't require an actor of a specific ethnicity to play a
given role (the Whitney Houston TV version of "Cinderella" was a good
example of this; it had actors of multiple ethnicities play roles that
made some people blink--especially with Brandy as Cinderella and
Bernadette Peters as her stepmother). Color-indifferent casting, though
still rare, is happening more often with big-name stars cast in what were
written originally as "White" roles. Washington, here in "Bone", as well
as Morgan Freeman in "Kiss The Girls" and "ER's" Eriq LaSalle's "Lucas
Davenport" from the "Prey" series, have been beneficiaries of such
color-indifferent casting; whatever the motivation behind this, I only
hope it's not just a passing fad.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
If gory thrillers with no real sense of direction, stock characters that
fit the Bad Guy mold to a T, and plot twists that aren't so twisty, are
your Thing, you'll probably be one of the millions that'll make this flick
the Next Big Movie of this week (or so says my husband, anyway; and I
think he's as right as the stylistic rain that kept falling, very
noticeably, throughout "Bone"). For me, though, the sheen on the surface
didn't hide the hollowness within. And be forewarned: you might want to
take a barf bag.</P>
<P>"The Bone Collector":  (rating: yellowlight) 
I tend to require more meat on my bones [bad pun...Baaaad Bammer...].</P>
