                       A film review by Shane R. Burridge
                        Copyright 1997 Shane R. Burridge</PRE>
<PRE>D.O.A. (1988) 96m.  </PRE>
<P>Remake of 1950 thriller is snappily directed, features popular lead
actors (Dennis Quaid, Meg Ryan), and has a great premise, but is
ultimately torpedoed by a misconceived script.  Quaid is an English
professor (and has-been writer) on a Texas campus who finds out that
he has been fatally poisoned.  With only 24 hours left to live he
tries to find out who is responsible.  While I thoroughly enjoyed this
on first viewing, it doesn't hold up so well the second time around. 
Story, which belongs to the =91what would you do if the world was going
to end in ten minutes=92 school of speculation, treads the path a number
of us would no doubt choose - what Quaid wants is answers.
What drives D.O.A. is the notion that fear of death can be taken to a
further stage - the fear of dying without meaning or reason.  In fact
Quaid is more preoccupied with solving the mystery behind his imminent
death than  the physical act of dying itself.  </P>
<P>The most puzzling thing for Quaid (and the audience) is the crime=92s
motive.  There is no apparent reason why anyone should want to kill
him.  This intriguing element is one of the best things the film has
going for it until the denoument, which is so absurd it undermines the
whole premise.  Worse, it trivializes Quaid=92s death.  There are other
glitches, most obviously that by the time the bodies start piling up
(and there=92s way too many for such a weak motive) there=92s not a lot of
suspects left over to pick the murderer from.  There=92s also a
convoluted exposition scene with Charlotte Rampling that for all
purposes is irrelevant to the main story.  Nor am I convinced about
the neccessity for Meg Ryan=92s character.  Her brief interlude with
Quaid supposedly reminds him of the quality of life that he has let
slip by - but does anybody really need this just before they=92re about
to die?  On a purely filmic level, however, the film succeeds, and 
there are enough inventive moments to make it interesting.  A 
promising cinema debut for Annabel Jankel and Rocky Morton - with all 
its plot holes it might have been a good idea for them to push style 
over content even further.</P>
