<PRE>                                     FARGO
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     The Coen brothers are back and in a big way.  Bigger, as a matter of
fact, than ever before, because with FARGO, the Coens have produced a
masterpiece of a film that outclasses anything they've done yet--from
RAISING ARIZONA to BARTON FINK to even BLOOD SIMPLE, the movie that put
them on the map.  FARGO is perhaps the best movie to come down the pike
since PULP FICTION--so good that it earns my seldom-awarded five-star
rating.</P>
<P>     FARGO is one of those rare pictures about which I have nothing
negative to say.  Based on a true story that took place in North
Dakota/Minnesota in 1987, FARGO is the instantly enthralling tale of the
financially-troubled Jerry Lundergaard (William H. Macy), a plan to kidnap
his wife (Kristin Rudrud), her wealthy father (Harve Presnell), the
halfway-competent criminals who screw everything up (Steve Buscemi and
Peter Stormare), and the pregnant cop who's on the case (Frances
McDormand).</P>
<P>     What makes a film like this, done a hundred different times in a
hundred different ways, so good?  Joel and Ethan Coen's script is the
base--a wickedly funny and quirky screenplay that is executed with
perfection by the leads, particularly Oscar-caliber Macy and McDormand. 
The brothers, who grew up in Minneapolis, where a large chunk of the
action takes place, have also imbued the film with a rich and realistic
regional flair--authentic from the weather to the clothes to (especially
good) the accents.  It's so real, I was actually hungry for back bacon
when I left.</P>
<P>     Every shot of FARGO is executed like it's a piece of art with the
Coens' typical style; there is nothing at all wasted in the film, as the
Coens make even what would normally be dull establishing scenes fun. 
Also, while FARGO is as black as black comedy can get, it isn't completely
over the edge (the problem that shattered THE HUDSUCKER PROXY).  More
restrained--very much "back to basics" a la BLOOD SIMPLE--the Coens have
truly found their stride.</P>
<P>     So don't read any more about the film.  Just go see it, and prepare
to have a blast.  Don't be daunted by the typically poor Coen brothers
film title of FARGO (not only is it nondescript, but not much of the movie
is even set in Fargo (that's North Dakota)).  Just bundle up against that
icy cold.</P>
