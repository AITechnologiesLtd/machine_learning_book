<PRE>                            Some Films from SIFF
                        Copyright 1992 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     Here are some films I've seen so far at the Seattle International
Film Festival (SIFF).  These are not reviews, merely mentions to alert
one or two of you in case they show up at a film festival or art house
near you.</P>
<P>BROTHER'S KEEPER is a documentary by Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky.
Four bachelor brothers have lived all their lives on a dairy farm in New
York state.  One of the brothers is accused of the mercy killing of
another -- or is it a sex crime?  -- the prosecution doesn't much care
as long it gets a conviction.  The local community that for decades
ignored the "boys" as smelly and unsightly messes rally round them now
to protect them from the outsiders.  This is a brilliant piece of film
making, initially repugnant (the brothers really are hard to take), the
story quickly becoming fascinating and moving and mysterious with drama
and comedy and wonderfully revealing interviews with the brothers, the
neighbors, the prosecution, the defense.  Highly recommended.  In fact,
this should be next year's Oscar winner, if there were any justice
(which there never is, in this category, at least).</P>
<P>HAPPY BIRTHDAY!  is a German film directed by Doris Dorrie and starring
Hansa Czypionka, Ozay, Doris Kunstmann, Lambert Hamel, Omer Simsek.
This is an interesting, funny, fascinating, entertaining, and original
contribution to the hard-boiled detective genre.  In this case, the
private eye is a German-speaking Turk Kemal Kayankaya, who is scorned by
the Turks in Germany because he's not a "real" Turk (he speaks no
Turkish, was raised by German foster parents) and constantly subjected
to the anti-Turkish racism of the Germans.  He's hired by a Turkish
woman to find her missing husband and gets involved in an ever deepening
morass of greed, corruption, and violence.  Highly recommended.</P>
<P>LOVERS (AMANTES) is a Spanish film directed by Vincente Aranda and
starring Jorge Sanz and Victoria Abril.  Based on a true story, set in
1954-55 in Franco Spain, it is the story of a weak but very sexy young
man who is caught in a struggle between two women.  Victoria Abril, who
was an Almodovar regular and whom I last saw in HIGH HEELS, won a Silver
Bear at the Berlin Film Festival for this performance.  The film was
Spain's highest grossing film last year and swept the major awards at
the Spanish equivalent of the Oscars, according to the producer who
spoke with the audience after the film.  This film begins as a comedy
and spins down into a very dark and disturbing drama.  It is admirably
paced and acted.  Highly recommended.</P>
<P>ON EARTH AS IN HEAVEN is a Belgian, French-language film directed by
Marion Hansel and starring Carmen Maura.  Maura, of course, is the first
Spanish actor to achieve real international popularity, mostly because
of her performance in Almodovar's WOMEN ON THE VERGE OF A NERVOUS
BREAKDOWN.  This film, in which she speaks French, is about a single
female journalist who decides to have a baby by herself, but the unborn
child has other ideas.  I had a lot of problems with the central conceit
of this film, viz., the mother communicating with her unborn baby in
words.  The movie is heavily message-laden, and while it is a worthy
message the power of the message is diluted by the unbelievable premise.
Probably, the movie is of interest only to real fans of Carmen Maura,
such as myself.</P>
<P>GOODBYE, BOYS (DO SVIDANIYA, MALCHIKI) is a Russian 1966 film directed
by Mikhail Kalik.  This film was suppressed by Soviet censors for
decades, but has finally emerged.  It is the coming-of-age story of
three boys, life-long friends, in a Yalta-like resort city on the
(Black?)  Sea.  This is the last summer of their childhood.  In the fall
they will be going to officer school in Leningrad.  It was shot in black
and white with minimal dialog and lots of lingering mood shots of
sunlight on the waves and footprints on the sand being washed away.  It
is a charmer, even though it seems dated and something of a period
piece, and technically somewhat crude or amateurish.  I was confused
through most of the film by the time frame.  It appears, when all is
said and done to be set in the late Thirties just before Hitler attacked
the Soviet Union.  Some German and Soviet newsreel clips are spliced in,
but I misunderstood them to be flashbacks, rather than contemporary
events or forecasts of the war to come.  Still, I think this film would
be of interest to many of us.  The three boys and the other actors are
all interesting and lively performers, and the film provides a glimpse
at a now vanished culture, too.  What I'm not sure about is why the
censors objected; perhaps the film failed to show proper enthusiasm for
war or they suspected it was making fun of communism, which are probably
both true.  Recommended with reservations.</P>
