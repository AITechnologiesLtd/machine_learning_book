<PRE>CHILL FACTOR (M).  
(Warner Bros/Village Roadshow)
Director: Hugh Johnson
Stars: Skeet Ulrich, Cuba Gooding jr, Peter Firth, David Paymer, Hugh 
Daniel Kelly
Running time: 102 minutes.</PRE>
<P>A contemporary variation of the classic Wages Of Fear, with
plenty of chases and mindless action thrown in for good measure.</P>
<P>In 1987 scientist Raymond Long (David Paymer) developed a new
chemical weapon for the US military that created a fierce heat wave
capable of stripping the flesh off humans and destroying all plant
life in its path.  But when 18 soldiers were killed after an
experiment went horribly wrong on an isolated pacific island, the
disgraced Colonel Bremmer (Peter Firth) took the fall and spent ten
years in the military prison at Fort Leavenworth.  Upon his release,
Bremmer plots to steal the prototype of the weapon, cutely nicknamed
"Elvis", and sell it to the highest bidder on the open market.</P>
<P>The mortally wounded Long manages to make off with the weapon
before Bremmer can get his hands on it.  He gives it to Tim Mason
(Skeet Ulrich, who played the gay hustler in As Good As It Gets), his
fishing partner and a "hamburger jockey" at a local diner.  Mason has
to get the weapon to Fort McGruder before Bremmer can get his hands on
it.  And, most importantly, he has to keep it cold - below 50 degrees
Fahrenheit - or else it automatically detonates, wiping out everything
within a hundred mile radius.  That's where Arlo's ice cream delivery
truck comes in handy.</P>
<P>Arlo (Cuba Gooding jr) is a disenchanted, ex-employee of an
ice cream delivery firm, and initially reluctant to become involved in
this dangerous task.  These two mismatched, reluctant heroes transport
their volatile cargo over twisting mountainous roads, trying
desperately to outrace Bremmer's heavily armed private army, and the
dim-witted local sheriff who thinks Mason is a terrorist.</P>
<P>Chill Factor is a rather clichéd, formulaic odd couple
action adventure.  However, it does provide some thrills, and moments
of excitement and tension that make it better than most of these
straight-to- video thrillers.  Director Hugh Johnson maintains a
reasonably fast pace throughout, not giving audiences much time to
dwell on the implausibility of the whole thing.</P>
<P>The performances are also better than one normally finds in
this type of film.  Gooding brings plenty of his usual smart arse
humour and scene stealing style to an otherwise fairly one dimensional
and clichéd character, and his presence lifts the film.  Ulrich is
new to action films, but he seems to have pumped himself up for this
role, and he handles the more physical elements quite comfortably.
And Firth, who hasn't been seen on screen much lately, is having a
fine old time as the villainous Bremmer.</P>
<P>Chill Factor may not be brilliant stuff, but it certainly
turns up the heat for a couple of hours of diverting fun and
excitement.</P>
