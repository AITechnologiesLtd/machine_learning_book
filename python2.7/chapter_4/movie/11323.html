                               TITANIC
                           A film review by
                            Frank Ochieng</PRE>
<P>starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Gloria Stuart, Kathy Bates,
Billy Zane
Director: James Cameron</P>
<P>TITANIC is James Cameron's 150 million plus water-logged extravagant
epic set afloat to a tremendous tune involving a touching love story
amid the devastating consequences that dictate this tragic footnote in
history--the sinking of this incredible vigorous vessel. What Cameron
does is essentially give us a history lesson in an empowering, emphat-
ic, entertaining way. This extraordinary flick feels like a big event
with a litany of emblematic scope and impressive visual
vitality. Cameron wants to lose the audience in his elitist approach
to this lavish production.</P>
<P>TITANIC stars Oscar-nominated heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack, a
wandering artist who captures the attention (and eventual love) of
Rose (Oscar-nominated actress Kate Winslet), a young socialite who
happens to be involved with a vain suitor (Billy Zane). This early
2oth century love story is as opulent and glossy as the whole film
itself. We digest every elegant nostalgic nuance that is provided in
this breathtaking period piece. The romantic bond that is cemented
between these two lovers serves as an eerie irony because it is their
attachment that proves to be the only thing considered durable,
reliable, indestructible, and resillient...not the mighty ship that
was used as the catalyst to encourage their lovelorn union in the
first place.</P>
<P>TITANIC is perhaps the first 100 million dollar plus film in quite
some time to actually carve a niche for letting its magnificent
special effects and big-budget billing match its human dimensional
heart.  Cameron's effort here is not all plastic and ponderous; he
delivers a humane scale of hope, beauty, and passion. TITANIC does
have that sinking feeling, and it's not because of the iceberg--it's
because of our emotional impulse for this exceptional film.</P>
<PRE>Frank rates this film: ***1/2 stars</PRE>
