<PRE>                                  A FEW GOOD MEN
                                    [Spoilers]
                       A film review by Michael S. Huang
                        Copyright 1992 Michael S. Huang</PRE>
<P>Directed by Rob Reiner
Starring Tom Cruise, Demi Moore, Jack Nicholson, Kiefer Sutherland, and
         Kevin Bacon</P>
<P>     The past few years have been lacking genuinely well-told stories
that are there for the essence of the yarn -- tales that make people
think and feel.  Movies of late have relied on special effects, sex,
violence, controversy, and big names to bring in audiences, and this is
the first movie in a while which I've seen that doesn't use any of these
except the big names and doesn't rely on *any* of them to keep your
attention.</P>
<P>     The story starts out with the brutal beating and murder of a
Private First Class at the United States Naval Base, Marine Barracks in
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</P>
<P>     Moore, as the officer in Internal Affairs finds out about this case
and wants to pursue this as a case of "Code Red," illegal hazing and
beating of marines who are not up to par for some reason.</P>
<P>     Her superiors deny her request to press this case, and forward it
to Tom Cruise who plays a Harvard Law School graduate who has been out
of school for nine months and in the Navy for only seven.  He's had a
history of brilliant plea-bargains, and has never actually defended a
client in court.</P>
<P>     Enter Nicholson, who is the Colonel in command of the Marines in
Guantanamo Bay, and Sutherland, his right-hand man (well, once removed.
:-)  Nicholson's character ordered the "Code Red" which eventually led
to the killing of the Private.</P>
<P>     This is the premise for the story of getting to the truth, and
Cruise and Moore's battle through Marine Code of Platoon, Corps, God,
Country.  They must dig out the truth through a group of highly
disciplined soldiers who are trained to obey orders, and to put nothing
above the word of their superiors.</P>
<P>     Reiner did an outstanding job with the movie's direction, and
Cruise was brilliant in a few courtroom scenes.  Moore gave much of
herself in her role as a very self-determined, stubborn, headstrong
Naval Officer, and Nicholson played an unbelievable courtroom scene
near the end of the movie.</P>
<P>     Cinematography was well-done, and music was moderately-well-done.</P>
<P>     This movie is a definite gem among today's common movies being
released.  Unlike others like BASIC INSTINCT, and TERMINATOR 2 it
doesn't rely on gratuitous sex or violence to convey an extremely
well-told story.  There isn't any gore or "skin," although there is a
bit of language spread through the film, although done well with the
type of story being told.  An extremely well-done story.  A definite
must-see.</P>
