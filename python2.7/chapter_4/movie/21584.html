<PRE>IN SHORT: Huh?</PRE>
<P>The phenomenon that is Pokémon so outstrips early kidlet addictions such
as Power Rangers or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles that you should be glad
that the American movie has been totally reedited and aimed at the
insistent low digit kidlet demographic target. Pokémon: The First Movie
is the final result of editing three Japanese vids into a single,
English dubbed movie. What was removed was described to me as a
slaughter sequence in which the Pocket Monster called Mewtwo,
scientifically cloned from the remnants of a long lost Pokémon, Mew,
goes on a bloody killing rampage that would make Kurosawa turn his eyes
away from the screen. Having problems with the concept that Pokémon are
subservient to their human masters puts this monster in such a funk
that, in the original film, it goes on a killing rampage that lasts
close to eight minutes. That's more reference to the Source Material
than I'm supposed to give you but, on the off chance that you come
across any of the bootlegged, subtitled versions of the original
Japanese versions, be very warned that the violence level in the
non-American released is far beyond what any adult would consider
acceptable for single digit kidlets.</P>
<P>That being said, in the American version, Mewtwo still questions his
Reason for Being, but only blows everybody up. No blood or anything that
would warp sensitive young minds. Just a Big Bang, unleashing upon the
Universe something that makes sense only to the properly initiated.
There's no explanation of what Pokémon are, why they are or where they
come from. Nothing about humans training them for battle or the unique
relationship between Ash Ketchum and his `friend' Pikachu. Either you
know what it is, or you sit with only the vaguest comprehension of what
is playing out on screen</P>
<P>Mewtwo's plan is to clone the existing Pokémon into super warriors who
have no inclination to be subservient to the Humans. Afterwards the new
Pokémon will destroy the old and Mewtwo will do his part by wiping out
humankind. The only thing in his way is the original, the very bestest
and mostest powerfulest Mew and a Pokémon battle unlike anything seen
before. The net result is that Mewtwo realizes that fighting is wrong.
He and the rest of the SuperPokémon fly off into the sky, but not before
wiping the memory of their existence out of the minds of the Pokémon and
trainers that witnessed the battle. Net result? The trainers and Pokémon
don't get to keep the knowledge that fighting is bad, and thus can go
off and have more Pokémon battles. Just as they did at the beginning of
the movie. Just as they''ve always done.</P>
<P>Does that strike anyone else as a screwed up message to send to the
kidlets?</P>
<P>The kidlets in the audience, especially the six year old sitting in his
uncle's lap, were happy as clams. They cheered and applauded and, for
the life of me, I can't tell you why. If you've had no exposure to
Pokémon, there's nothing here to widen your horizons. Two years from
now, there'll be something else to hold the next generation of kidlets
in its sway.</P>
<P>Preceding The First Movie is a short called Pikachu's Vacation. This has
something to do with how Pokémon behave when they're free of their human
masters. Beyond that, I was totally lost.</P>
