<P>     It's entirely possible that a film version of THE END OF THE AFFAIR
-- Graham Greene's novel of passion, obsession and faith -- could be made
without getting into the explicit details of its protagonists'
extra-marital exploits. And in fact it already has, in a weepy 1955 
version starring Deborah Kerr and Van Johnson. Some would no doubt argue
that the more restrained approach has its merits, but there's something
about this source material that demands an approach that couldn't be
filmed in 1955. I can't remember the last time a mainstream film featured
as much intense, forthright sexuality -- of the groping, grinding, gasping
variety -- as THE END OF THE AFFAIR. And I can't remember the last time it
would have been quite so thematically appropriate.</P>
<P>     The story begins in 1946, with a chance meeting between writer
Maurice Bendrix (Ralph Fiennes) and his neighbor Henry Miles (Stephen
Rea). Henry is distraught over a notion that his wife Sarah (Julianne
Moore) may be seeing another man, a notion in which Bendrix also has a
certain interest. In flashback, we learn that Bendrix and Sarah engaged in
a passionate five-year-long affair during the war, an affair which Sarah
had abruptly ended with no explanation. Still obsessed with Sarah two
years after the end of their affair, Bendrix decides he must know what
Sarah is now up to, and hires a private detective (Ian Hart) to uncover
her secrets.</P>
<P>     Neil Jordan's approach to much of THE END OF THE AFFAIR is in fact
fairly restrained. Michael Nyman's string score pulses throughout the
film, adding a layer of heightened drama, but the performances play
against the music effectively. Ralph Fiennes' work may be too reminiscent
of his character in THE ENGLISH PATIENT, but it's right for the role, as
is Stephen Rea's hangdog Henry. Jordan also takes a calculated risk by
playing some scenes more than once, after a key piece of information has
been revealed. Though the repetition of those scenes gives the film a
slightly lurching pace, it also shows how easy it is to misinterpret key
moments in our lives. Ultimately, the risk pays off.</P>
<P>     His even bigger risk pays off even more definitively. Let viewers go
in forewarned: THE END OF THE AFFAIR is a steamy affair, the sex scenes a
deft tightrope act between pure animal passion and intense emotion. THE
END OF THE AFFAIR is a story that depends on believing in the transcendent
connection between Sarah and Bendrix, a connection Bendrix feels is broken
any time they are apart. Jordan even manages to use the sex scenes for a
couple of great punch lines (Bendrix, when Henry returns home at the
height of the lovers' passion: "What if he heard us?" Sarah: "He wouldn't
recognize the sound"). THE END OF THE AFFAIR circa 1999 combines the
appeal of old-fashioned tragic romance with Greene's ahead-of-his-time
psychology of irrational desire (whether temporal or spiritual). It may
make you uncomfortable, but you can't deny its honesty.</P>
<P>     The film does begin running out of gas in the third act, as the
relationship between Sarah and Bendrix becomes subservient to the
relationship between Sarah and God. Jordan does an impressive job of
making the novel's philosophical musings solid cinema, retaining all the
thematic weight without too much ponderous voice-over. There's also the
ongoing pleasure of Ian Hart's sharp, understated work as the private
detective who takes tremendous pride in his professionalism. And even when
they no longer fill the screen, THE END OF THE AFFAIR's scenes of illicit
eroticism linger like a memory of addictive high. Jordan does justice to
Greene's 1950s narrative by doing what the 1950s couldn't do -- showing
the middle of an affair that made the end of the affair a tragedy.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 not-for-the-family affairs:  7.</PRE>
