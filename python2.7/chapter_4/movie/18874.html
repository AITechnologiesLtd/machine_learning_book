<P>PLOT:
Hero Navy-boy gets a posh job as a liaison in the Pentagon under the
Secretary of Defense, and soon starts up a secret affair with the same man's
mistress, initially unbeknownst to him. When the woman in question is
killed, our Navy-boy heads up an investigation for the Secretary to find the
other man with whom she was having an affair, also believed to be the
murderer.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A taut political thriller, this film offers us a touch of sex, plenty of
suspense and intrigue webbed inside a cliched 80s soundtrack, a powerhouse
performance by Will Patton, and a fascinating look behind the covert walls
of the US government's big-wigs. Kevin Costner also pulls off his greatest
looking part, while Gene Hackman continues his standout work, chewing right
into every one of his morally-challenged lines with fervor. The film itself
does take a little while to get going, but once the "chase" is on, it
doesn't let up until the very last visually-resounding scene. On the down
side, besides the dated soundtrack, I did not particularly enjoy Sean
Young's performance or the very last two minutes of the film, which seemed
gratuitously tacked on for inexplicable reasons. But even those small
oversights don't take away from the fact that this film comes through on all
cylinders in respect to plot, tension, acting, suspense and intrigue. All in
all, one of the best thrillers to come out of the 80s, and certainly one
that still holds up to the test of time.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Ten years after working together as actors, Kevin Costner co-starred and
directed Will Patton in the ill-fated THE POSTMAN.
The character of Nina is played by none other than international model, Iman
(full name Iman Abdulmajid), who happens to be married to the Thin White
Duke himself, David Bowie. She was born in Somalia.
Plot hole anyone? The Pentagon is one of the largest buildings in the world,
with 17 miles of corridors alone. For a single group to search it in two
hours is preposterous. Oh well, it's just a movie!</P>
