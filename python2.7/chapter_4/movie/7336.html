<PRE>                         PEE WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE
                       A film review by Jeff Alan
                        Copyright 1997 Jeff Alan</PRE>
<P>For various reasons, Paul Reubens, who created and played Pee Wee Herman for
more than a decade, is sometimes dismissed by critics.  There is no question
that Mr. Reubens's downfall was perpetuated (or climaxed) by the incident a
few years back where he was enjoying himself a little too much in a movie
theatre.  America was stunned:  The person that they let their children watch
on Saturday morning was now a sexually ambiguous figure.  Parents do not like
ambiguity when it comes to sexual orientation:  Take Ellen DeGeneres for
example, she in a matter of weeks will come out of the closet in a television
sitcom.  No public outcries here folks (except for the always outspoken Rev.
Jerry Falwell).</P>
<P>It is unforunate that Mr. Reubens's brilliancy is masked by one night in his
life which turned out to be a huge mistake.  Brilliancy?  Why would I say
that?  Well it's fairly simple:  The character in Pee Wee Herman that was
created by Reubens was an extremely unique character that first started off
being raunchy in specials he did in the late 70's for HBO, but then turned
into kids' oriented, really being perpetuated by the movie Pee Wee's Big
Adventure.  </P>
<P>Some very creative talents collaborated on this film:  Phil Hartman (co
writer) who is of SNL fame, and Tim Burton, one of this earliest movies,
which really showed how masterful he could direct with weird and make-believe
worlds (just as he showed us with EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and THE NIGHTMARE
BEFORE CHRISTMAS).  It is my point, that this film and Mr. Reubens's are
highly underrated:  I think Mr. Reubens's has done a lot more than people
think in the film industry.</P>
<P>Pee Wee's Big Adventure was a great film.  It was an entertaining piece of
film that was extremely appealing:  It involved a world where everyone was
happy and nothing could hurt you (well, except maybe your feelings when you
get your big red bicycle stolen!).  Some critics lauded it.  Some looked down
upon it, dismissing it as stupid.  I don't think you can appreciate this
movie if you do not appreciate the creative genius that Paul Reubens
possesses.  </P>
<P>Sure, Pee Wee Herman is now an old character.  Sure, Mr. Reubens has went on
to different projects, like playing small roles in films like BATMAN II and
GEORGE, and even the annoying product of nepotism in MURPHY BROWN, playing a
guy named Andrew.  But Mr. Reubens's creative genius should be noted.  Why?
 I think that if he and Burton and Hartman had not made that effort, there
would not have been an EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, nor would there have been a MARS
ATTACKS.  </P>
<P>In a nutshell, Pee Wee's Big Adventure was an entertaining film that let
creative genius be shown in the sheer limelight, allowing other directors to
expand upon the efforts of the film's creators.</P>
