<P>Often similar to a little boy lost in a park that he had no right 
venturing into, The Call of the Oboe (O Toque Do Oboe) is a 
disappointing film that seems to have wandered astray. Many elements of 
the film are solid, and have potential far greater than director Claudio 
MacDowell will ever know, but they simply don't convert into a solid 
work.</P>
<P>Although a setting is never established, it becomes apparent. The film 
takes place somewhere in a Latin American village in present day. The 
community is a dull one, where every day is a downhill slide from the 
last. Over time, the people have taken to themselves. The town cinema is 
closed, no tourist has passed through in years, and the daily funeral 
processions are accompanied by no one other than the grave digger.</P>
<P>So what happens when a "tourist" (Paolo Betti) does arrive one day? He 
sends this routine and dull town into mayhem and shock. It is revealed 
that he is a musician who plays the oboe as a hobby. When he sits down 
in the park one day to give a solo performance, the entire community 
gathers around for their first bit of entertainment in countless years.</P>
<P>It is from that that the musician meets some of the villagers, and 
agrees to play at the local cinema in accompaniment to a silent film, 
thus opening the theatre for the first time in ages. The woman that 
talks him into this witty task is the cinema owner (Leticia Vota) who 
also happens to be engaged to the town's police inspector, a figure who 
soon becomes suspicious of his fiance's involvement with this 
musician.</P>
<P>The rest of the plot closely resembles a freak show gone horribly 
astray. It features a character who literally rises from his grave, a 
woman who has a phone conversation with God, and the aforementioned 
inspector who goes from an intriguing and serious character, to an 
almost humorous drunk.</P>
<P>Technically, this film is a nightmare. The music score is poorly edited 
into the film, so it is often choppy, rough, and abrupt. The lighting is 
poor at best, which makes it increasingly difficult to focus on many 
scenes, and the English subtitles are full of misspelled words, and are 
often absent presumably on the assumption that the audience will be able 
to understand some simple Portuguese and Spanish phrases. This 
translation flaw is best highlighted at the beginning of the film when 
what seems to be a relevant fight is filled with dialogue, but the 
subtitles are limited to fewer than 25 words. </P>
<P>In addition, the pace of the film seems uneven. It opens with a series 
of long panoramic shots that alone can test one's patience. The film 
then moves into a faster pace, that again slows towards the end, as the 
director seems determined to reach the two hour mark.</P>
<P>There was, however, potential for this film. It is a piece exploring the 
beauty of cinema and music, and the re-unification of people. These are 
all topics that could easily fill a movie. Perhaps, if there were no 
freak show, and the technical aspects were to improve, there might just 
be a thing of beauty at the end. Most importantly, though, the director 
would have to patch up the plot and make it flow better so that the two 
hours aren't such a bore. Until then, there seems to be little more hope 
for this piece, than that boy has by simply crying out "Mommy" while he 
wanders astray in a park.         </P>
