<PRE>                              PRIVATE PARTS
                           PREDICTIONS OF FIRE
                       A film review by Dave Cowen
                        Copyright 1997 Dave Cowen</PRE>
<P>In order to write this review, I need to admit that at one time I 
considered myself to be something of a Howard Stern fan.  It was about
the time back in college when I had shown a number of friends Stern's
Pay-Per-View special, in which a man sets his private parts aflame.  
The man explained that he was trying to combat a case of the crabs and
had succeeded in burning them to death by dousing that area of his 
body with lighter fluid.  This sparked a discussion among my friends 
about the safety of using lighter fluid to burn off bodily hair, which 
ultimately ended in one of them running down the hallway of the dorm 
to the bathroom with a flaming hand.  He spent the rest of the day with
his hand in a bucket of water.  So much for the safety of using lighter 
fluid to burn off bodily hair. </P>
<P>But watching Howard Stern's PRIVATE PARTS provoked something in me 
that I've only felt one other time when watching a movie, and it wasn't
the kind of combination of titillation and amazement that Stern's radio
and TV work seems to inspire.  During the climactic scene, after Howard 
is cut off of the air after interviewing the first naked woman on radio 
and has stormed into his producer's office provoking a fight, I felt
nauseous.  My legs gave out, my stomach seized, and for once, I wanted
nothing more than to get out of the theater.  The other time this had 
happened was during the second half of Scorcese's GOODFELLAS, in which I 
was overwhelmed by the paranoia Ray Liotta's character was experiencing. 
At the viewing of PRIVATE PARTS I attended, though, it wasn't paranoia 
that made we want to leave the theater.  It was disgust.</P>
<P>Throughout the past couple of years, I've found myself strangely charmed
by two movies which portrayed men who found success in life by doing
things that offended other people: Terry Zwigoff's CRUMB, and Milos 
Forman's PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT.  CRUMB, seemed to overcome the 
insanity present in his family and provide brilliant social commentary 
by venting those impulses through brilliantly illustrated comics.  Flynt, 
in a somewhat inadvertant way, upheld the rights for Americans to parody 
public figures and display the human body without restriction.  I expected 
PRIVATE PARTS to trigger the same feeling in me: the triumph of an 
underdog who pays his dues, but ultimately gets what he wants in life by 
acting on his impulses, the "moral majority" be damned.  But after Stern's 
on-air massage from a naked woman, during the fight, I didn't find Stern 
heroic... but pitiful.  What was he fighting for?</P>
<P>Critics have expressed surprise that PRIVATE PARTS would portray 
Stern as being a good-hearted family man, and that at many times, 
PRIVATE PARTS seems to want to do nothing but espouse family values.
How could it be any different?  If you were making a movie about your
life, with you playing yourself in the starring role, would you really
make yourself look like, well, you really are?  Of course not.  With the
vast majority of life stories, the film would be a huge flop.  It's all
ridiculously cynical -- in order to make the film make money, you've got 
to play to the type of person that the masses want to see, so you make 
yourself seem like you're just "playing a role," that you're really a 
sweet person underneath it all to win over both friends and enemies.  
Throughout the film, Stern gripes that he's always misunderstood.  No
wonder!  With such brazen manipulation of public perception, glossing
over the contradictions in his personality, Stern seems nothing more 
than a money grubbing jerk.  "Put the kids in the last scene!  People
will eat it up!"  It's that cynical calculation of alternating 
sleaze with a family values image that made me literally sick to my
stomach.  </P>
<P>The film isn't without good points.  Stern's acting is natural, and
his co-hosts Robin Quivers and Fred Norris do an admirable job in front
of the camera.  The film moves at a fast pace, and Stern, when he's 
shown doing the show itself, never fails to be hilarious.  It's when 
the movie goes "behind the scenes" that it become artificial, treacly
and rings horribly false.  </P>
<P>The Neue Slowenische Kunst have a similar problem.  NSK, an art 
collective based out of Ljubljana, Slovenia, bathe traditional art
such as music, painting and dance with the overtones of fascism.  
Adopting the images and sounds of the totalitarian rule of their hometown 
Ljublijana, industrial musicians Laibach create pounding modern 
symphonies, often converting American or European pop standards into
a frightening, pounding industrial brew.  Their album Let it Be, in
which the entire Beatles album Let It Be is transmogrified into a 
throbbing, stomping teutonic sound, is a classic of industrial music.
It's also very funny, and very obviously an ironic joke.  It's a pity
that PREDICTIONS OF FIRE isn't as well.</P>
<P>In a completely deadpan style, director Michael Benson analyzes the
development of the Neue Slowenische Kunst and the origins of their 
art, linking it with Ljublijana's history of occupation.  Benson spends
most of the movie's time showing old newsreel footage and reciting,
in a dry and monotonous tone, the history of Slovenia.  </P>
<P>How does hostory ultimately affect Neue Slowenische Kunst's art?  Very 
little, it would seem.  In what brief moments of what we see of Laibach, 
Irwin, or any of the other artists in the collective, it would seem that
they're doing nothing more than pulling off postmodern pranks in the art 
world (similar to Britain's K Foundation, whose film debut was the much 
more impressive and direct WATCH THE K FOUNDATION BURN A MILLION QUID),
adopting the image of fascism to do nothing more than shock.  The
mixture of dry documentary footage and art terrorism never meld, and 
much of the output of the NSK is glossed over to make way for history 
lessons which sound recited from a textbook.  Like PRIVATE PARTS, 
PREDICTIONS OF FIRE seems to be revisionist history, trying to force
NSK's output into a historical context to make it look serious or 
important, and ultimately, PREDICTIONS OF FIRE rings just as false. </P>
