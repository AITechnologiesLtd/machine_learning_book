Susan Granger's review of "THE STRAIGHT STORY" (Buena Vista Pictures)</PRE>
<P> This delicately wrought, true story of Alvin Straight, a man
on a mission, is a marked departure for film-maker David Lynch ("Blue
Velvet," "The Elephant Man"), and charismatic Richard Farnsworth's
poignant performance has definite Oscar potential. The story revolves
around a stubborn 73 year-old - that's Farnsworth - who travels 260
miles from Laurens, Iowa, to Mt. Zion, Wisconsin, to visit his ailing
brother and patch up a quarrel. What makes his odyssey unique is his
mode of transport: a '66 John Deere lawnmower. With his own health
failing, Alvin can't see well enough to drive and refuses to let
anyone take him, even though he must hobble with two canes. So,
despite the protests of his speech-impaired daughter (Sissy Spacek)
and his cronies who consider him crazy, Alvin rigs up a small trailer
behind his lawnmower, packs up his gear, and putts along the highway
at 5 m.p.h. for six weeks. En route, he encounters some kindly folk
and spreads his simple brand of homespun wisdom. He counsels a
pregnant teenage runaway about the strength of family ties, recalls to
yuppie bikers how "the worst part of being old is remembering when you
were young," negotiates engine repairs with quirky twin mechanics, and
commiserates with a fellow veteran about his guilt of being a sniper
during World War II.  Screenwriters John Roach & Mary Sweeney and
director David Lynch show taste, discipline, and restraint in this
heartwarming, if slow-paced, geriatric "road picture," while
cinematographer Freddie Francis hauntingly captures the dramatic
skies-and-plains vistas of America's autumnal heartland.  On the
Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The Straight Story" is an
unforgettable 9. A delight from start to bittersweet fade-out, this
subdued, lyrical, mature film is a treasure.</P>
