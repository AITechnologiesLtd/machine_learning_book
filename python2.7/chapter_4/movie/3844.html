<P>     THIN ICE is sort of a low-budget, lesbian version of THE CUTTING 
EDGE, and represents one of the better gay romantic comedies to obtain 
some form of theatrical release.  Using the skating rink as a backdrop 
to character and relationship development, this movie traces the 
lifestyle changes of one young woman as she re-evaluates her sexual 
identity.  THIN ICE is fresh, breezy, and never condescending. </P>
<P>     Although this movie involves skating, it's not really about the 
sport. Unlike THE CUTTING EDGE, which featured extensively choreographed 
routines performed by professional skating doubles, THIN ICE uses the 
actors for every scene, and this means the level of difficulty remains 
low (for example, there are no jumps).  In total, very little time is 
spent on the ice; the Gay Games competition is really little more than a 
plot device to bring the two leads together.  It's the common ground 
where their vastly different personalities can mesh. </P>
<P>     Steffi (Sabra Williams) has enrolled as a pairs skater in the 4th 
Gay Games in New York ("It's our version of the Olympics, only bigger 
and more disorganized").  There's a problem, though:  at the last 
moment, the other member of her same-sex duo has backed out.  Now, in 
order to participate, she has to find a new partner, but candidates 
aren't lining up, and time is getting short.  As a last resort, she 
approaches Natalie (Charlotte Avery), a supposedly-straight young woman 
who has more love of the sport than talent in it.  As the two cram 
months of practice into weeks, a friendship -- and perhaps more -- 
develops. </P>
<P>     For any romantic comedy to work, a degree of effective chemistry is 
mandatory between the leads.  THIN ICE has this intangible quality.  
Williams and Avery, both giving unforced performances, work well 
together and, while there's never much overt sensuality in the 
relationship, it's not difficult to believe that Steffi and Natalie are 
in love, even when neither is able or willing to admit the truth.  The 
two actresses form a comfortable bond with each other and the audience. </P>
<P>     THIN ICE faithfully follows most of the expected romantic comedy 
formulas, doing everything with two women that a heterosexual love story 
might do with a male and female.  There's the falling in love period, 
followed by the break-up, then rounded out by the inevitable scene where 
all is forgiven and the lovers get back together.  Along the way, 
several subplots surface (most dealing with Natalie's family life) that 
don't add much value to the overall story.  An appearance by Sir Ian 
McKellen (playing himself) lends a little "star power" to the 
proceedings. </P>
<P>     Fiona Cunningham Reid, who directed, co-wrote, and produced the 
film, keeps the tone mostly light and playful.  While she clearly wants 
to highlight gay and lesbian issues (as shown in scenes such as a visit 
to the AIDS quilt), she's ultimately more interested in developing the 
romance.  Fortunately, that's where THIN ICE is at its strongest, and 
most of the running time is used in the advancement of this strength.  
If there's one message Reid is trying to convey (and it applies to those 
of all sexual persuasions), it's that true love is so hard to find that 
when it comes along, people should be open to changing their lifestyle 
to fit their lover rather than changing the lover to fit their 
lifestyle. </P>
