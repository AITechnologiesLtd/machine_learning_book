<P>Recently, there have been several movies using WWII as their background.
Three of the five films nominated for Best Picture at the 1998 Academy
Awards - Life is Beautiful, Saving Private Ryan, and The Thin Red Line - all
used this period as their political setting. Franco Zeffirelli's Tea with
Mussolini is the latest film to take place during this time frame. By using
a wonderful blend of plot and history, Zeffirelli proves that this backdrop
is still far from overused.</P>
<P>Much of Tea with Mussolini is a history lesson. The production begins in
Italy in 1935, continuing until 1942. The story takes place in Mussolini's
homeland the entire time. The film is careful to be as historically accurate
as possible, announcing several key dates as they occur during the seven
year span, and carefully portraying the various European political opinions
from the war. A fine example of this is when an Italian man dismisses the
rumors of Jewish suffering as "Pink Propaganda." This historic accuracy
allows for the all important backdrop of the film to be as smooth as
possible.</P>
<P>The protagonist of Zeffirelli's latest work is Luca Innocenti (Baird Wallace
as a child and Charlie Lucas as a teenager), a child born out of wedlock,
and therefore unrecognized by his father. Luca is cared for by his father's
employee, Mary (Joan Plowright) and her group of friends. Known as the
"Scorpioni," this group of eccentric women consists of Lady Hester (Maggie
Smith), Georgia (Lily Tomlin), Arabella (Dame Judi Dench) and the American,
Elsa (Cher). These ladies all look after Luca as he comes of age during the
film's seven year span. In addition, they look after themselves, all being
British with the exception of Elsa, and therefore enemies of Italy once the
nation enters into the war.</P>
<P>Tea with Mussolini features a rather impressive cast of proven actresses.
Unfortunately, Cher, one of the leads, fails to perform to her potential.
One such display of her substandard acting is in a scene that requires her
to be crying on her bed, in a state of hysterical denial. Not only is she
unrealistic, but her pathetic acting is almost comical at this key point of
the film, thus damaging the otherwise excellent production. Fortunately
though, Baird Wallace, who portrays the teenage Luca, is absolutely stunning
in his debut performance. Ironically, this is never more apparent than in a
part of the film where his character is alone in a room with Cher's
character, and is being asked to do her a favor. Not only does he carry
himself well enough to make the scene work, but his talent even manages to
make Cher look decent for that fleeting moment.</P>
<P>Don't be fooled by the big name studio behind this production. Although MGM
did make the film, it is far from a typical Hollywood work. Actually filmed
entirely overseas, Tea with Mussolini plays like an exceptional independent
film. The scenery is rich, the costumes are simple, and there are no special
effects in sight. Altogether, this gives the film a very warm and personal
touch for which Zeffirelli should be applauded.</P>
<P>Tea with Mussolini is a production well worth the price of a ticket. This
movie is not the greatest of 1999, and is injured by Cher's performance, or
lack thereof. But on the flip side, there is a wonderful plot interwoven
with history. Because of that history, and the marvelous setting it
provides, you realize that WWII certainly hasn't gone out of style, and Tea
with Mussolini may never.</P>
