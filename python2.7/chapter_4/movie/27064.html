<PRE>O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?</PRE>
<PRE> Reviewed by Harvey Karten
 Touchstone Pictures/Universal Pictures
 Director: Joel Coen
 Writer:  Ethan Coen & Joel Coen, based on Homer's "The
Odyssey"
 Cast: George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, John Turturro,
Daniel Von Bargen</PRE>
<P>   Thick and rich with Depression-era ambiance while making
no attempt to fashion critical political or social commentary on
its impact, "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" is targeted
principally to die-hard fans of the surreal and creative touches
of the Coen Brothers. If you liked "Fargo," which was blessed
by the magical casting of Frances McDormand who provided
a center for the layering of observations about Minnesotans,
you stand a good chance of smiling through "O Brother." 
Unfortunately, the Coen Brothers' latest offering has little of
the disarming comedy of "Fargo," the wacky style of "Raising
Arizona," and precious few of "The Hudsucker Proxy"'s
surreal moments.  While the picture is creatively
photographed by Roger Deakins in the traditionally sepia
tones usually reserved for pics about America during the
thirties, and while the musical score, particularly the
bluegrass mood, is disarming, the whole comes out less than
the sum of its parts.</P>
<P>   The intriguing title comes not from Homer's "Odyssey" on
which the story is loosely based but on Presten Sturges' most
important hit, "Sullivan's Travels," which featured Joel
McCrea in the role of a movie director who decides to do a
serious film and sets out with a dime in his pocket to
experience the real world.  Similarly "O Brother" focuses on a
trio of convicts on a Mississippi chain gain who cut away from
the daily round of breaking rocks to experience life in other
parts of the Deep South with no idea how they are going to
finance their commute or to evade the pursuing law.</P>
<P>   The breakout is motivated by the would-be leader of the
trio, Everett Ulysses McGill (George Clooney), who tells his
pals Pete (John Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson) that
if they escape with him, he can lead them to a $1.2 million
buried treasure.  In reality, Everett's goal is to get back with
his ex-wife Penny (Holly Hunter), who, it turns out, is about to
marry another.  As Everett announces his plans and his
dreams with a rich vocabulary obviously foreign to others in
the chain gang or in the staff of officers guarding the men, we
get the impression that he may be about the smartest guy in
the state--which is led by a thick-waisted, thick-headed
governor, Pappy O'Daniel (Charles Durning).  As the men
pursue the fictitious treasure, they embark on a Homeric
Odyssey which begins as a blind man pushing a railway
handcar gives them a lift while counseling them like a thirties
Cassandra that they will indeed find a treasure but one
different from that which they are seeking.</P>
<P>   Along the road they meet up with Tommy Johnson (Chris
Thomas King), a black guitarist who has allegedly sold his
soul to the Devil, in return gaining the ability to strum his
guitar like Orpheus.  They form a bluegrass company, The
Soggy Bottom Boys, which soars to number one on the
charts, leading the people throughout Mississippi and
Alabama to wonder who these gifted, mysterious musicians
are.</P>
<P>   Magical experiences abound as the three cons, one step
ahead of the law, are in turn seduced by a trio of
contempoary sirens, beaten by a kind of Cyclops (John
Goodman) who swindles them into thinking he is going to set
them up in the business of selling Bibles, and even
accompany an over-the-top Baby Face Nelson (Michael
Badalucco) on a bank robbery and a chase in which the
celebrated bandit roars, "Come and get me, coppers."</P>
<P>   The Coen Brothers display their most startling imagery at a
huge gathering of Ku Klux Klansmen, all in white robes
except for their colorfully attired leader.  As they prepare to
lynch Tommy Johnson, they engage in a dance number that
could have come out of The Wizard of Oz or even Dancer in
the Dark.</P>
<P>   "O Brother, Where Art Thou" can be appreciated for its
moments like these of bold imagery, while its soundtrack of
bluegrass gems can make us wonder how decades of hard
rock music ever supplanted this all-American breed of
melody.  Looking at the whole picture, though, I couldn't help
thinking that this is a road movie of one-damn-thing-following-
another, a story whose loose ends are tied up only in the final
moments.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running time: 106 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
