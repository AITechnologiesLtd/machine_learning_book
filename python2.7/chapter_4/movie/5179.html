<P>     A big, busy boxing satire with a surprisingly paltry punch, THE
GREAT WHITE HYPE stars Samuel L. Jackson as a shameless boxing promoter
whose plan to boost sagging pay-per-view revenues is to "invent" a white
contender (Peter Berg) to challenge his black heavyweight "champ" (Damon
Wayans).  (The logic is that people will pay more to see black vs. white
than black vs. black.) He may be right, in an absurdly accurate way, but
the film doesn't give us a reason to care.  As a scathing sports spoof,
HYPE is just that:  unfunny, unfocused, and, at times, just plain
pointless.  As a commentary on race relations, it's even *less*
effective.</P>
<P>     The dialogue is the best of this mess, lines like Jon Lovitz
exclaiming "I cannot make caviar out of fish eggs!" Writers Tony Hendra
and Ron Shelton also do good on the street slang, though we never hear
enough of it.  The script isn't strong enough, though, to support the
aggressive camera work of director Reginald Hudlin (HOUSE PARTY).  He
comes across as absolute overkill.  THE GREAT WHITE HYPE *almost* turns
around at the end, at the Big Match, when Hudlin attempts an extended
gag of rock-concert proportions.  With costumed dwarfs, gangsta rappers,
and the "champ" dressed as Death, only then do we get a glimpse of the
spoof that should've been. </P>
