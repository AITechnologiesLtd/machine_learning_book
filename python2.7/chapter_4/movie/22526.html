<P>DOUBLE JEOPARDY (M).  
(Paramount/UIP)
Director: Bruce Beresford
Stars: Ashley Judd, Tommy Lee Jones, Bruce Greenwood, Annabeth Gish, Roma 
Maffia, Davenia McFadden, Daniel Lapaine, Benjamin Weir
Running time: 105 minutes.</P>
<P>This exciting suspense thriller is probably the most formulaic
of ex-patriate director Bruce Beresford's mainstream Hollywood films
yet (Silent Fall, Last Dance, etc).  Yet he proves himself more than
capable of handling this familiar genre material with the same panache
and skill that he brings to even his more intelligent and personal
film projects.</P>
<P>Slickly written by David Weisberg and Douglas S Cook (The
Rock), Double Jeopardy is an action film that will also strongly
appeal to a female audience.</P>
<P>The film centres around Libby Parsons (Ashley Judd, from A
Time To Kill, Kiss The Girls, etc), a woman who wakes to a nightmare
during a pleasure cruise.  She is covered in blood, and her husband
Nick (Bruce Greenwood) has gone missing.  Eventually, Libby is charged
with Nick's murder, and even though the body is never found, the
circumstantial evidence against her is overwhelming.  When she is
sentenced to prison, she arranges for her best friend Angela (Annabeth
Gish) to take care of her young son Matt.</P>
<P>But Angela soon disappears.  By chance Libby discovers that
Nick is still alive and living with her in San Francisco.  Realising
that she has been framed and betrayed, she starts planning for her
revenge when she is released from prison.  A fellow inmate informs her
of the law of double jeopardy, which simply means that, since she has
already been convicted of her husband's murder once she can now kill
him with impunity.</P>
<P>However, Libby is no Rambette, but rather a woman out to
redress a wrong, although she proves herself quite adept at handling
herself in tricky situations.  She doesn't want to kill her husband,
she merely wants her son back and a chance to reclaim her life.  But
first she has to escape her parole officer Travis Lehmann (Tommy Lee
Jones), who won't hesitate to throw her back in jail if she steps out
of line while under his watchful eye.  Jones is again in Fugitive
mode, playing a gruff, laconic law enforcement officer whose dogged
pursuit of a runaway felon eventually, and reluctantly, turns into a
search for the truth about a miscarriage of justice.  The desperate
chase takes the pair half way across America.</P>
<P>Judd has her meatiest role yet here, and is quite convincing
as the desperate woman prepared to go to extraordinary lengths to find
her son.  With The Terminator, James Cameron forever changed the
perspective of female action heroines, and Judd establishes a credible
and formidable presence.  Greenwood (from Exotica, etc) is good as the
smarmy villain of the piece, and he oozes insincerity.</P>
<P>Even the scenery, ranging from Vancouver to New Orleans is
great to look at and provides a superb backdrop for the fast paced
action.  The plot has a few flaws in it, but Beresford proves such a
dab hand at handling the pace throughout that audiences are given
little time to dwell upon them until after the credits have finished
rolling.</P>
<P>Double Jeopardy's success at the box office will undoubtedly
propel him into the same league as compatriots like Phillip Noyce, who
have also established themselves as top notch directors of formulaic
Hollywood action thrillers.</P>
