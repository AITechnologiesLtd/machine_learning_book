Running time: 81 minutes
(German, with English subtitles).</PRE>
<P>This grungy, energetic, but off beat German film has been a
huge hit on the festival circuit, and should appeal to audiences
looking for something a little different from the usual bland
Hollywood blockbusters.  Exciting young German director Tom Tykwer
(Winter Sleepers, etc) takes the basic premise of the thriller movie -
the race against the clock scenario - and dazzlingly interweaves it
with a provocative look at how choices, destiny and fate can affect
our lives.</P>
<P>Unfolding at a breathless pace and set to a pulsating
electronic soundtrack, Run Lola Run tells three versions of the same
story.</P>
<P>Lola (wonderfully brought to life by the strikingly red headed
Franka Potente) and her boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) are a pair
of punks who have big plans for the future.  But then Manni becomes
involved in a simple courier run for a local drug dealer.  He
unfortunately loses 100,000 marks of drug money on a train, and has
just twenty minutes to find the money before he meets with the
mobster.  Unsure of exactly how she can help, Lola agrees to meet
Manni in twenty minutes, and thus begins a desperate race against
time.</P>
<P>The story unfolds in real time, as Lola races across town to a
rendezvous with an uncertain, pernicious fate.  But things do not go
smoothly for the pair.  The same story essentially unfolds three
times, but in each subsequent telling, chance, coincidental encounters
and accidents conspire to change the outcome.  The fate of the various
characters dramatically changes with each retelling.</P>
<P>The precociously talented Tykwer is clearly in love with the
process of film making and utilises a variety of medium to bring a
sense of kinetic energy to the film.  Tykwer uses a startling
combination of fast and slow motion camerawork, razor sharp editing,
split screen effects, animation, and flash forward montages to good
effect.  The clever structure is propelled along by the dynamic
presence of Potente, winner of the 1998 Bambi media Awards and one of
the most original screen heroines of recent years.</P>
<P>Run Lola Run is indicative of a new, emerging contemporary
German cinema.  This colourful, energetic, vicariously exciting,
brilliantly constructed, and breathtakingly executed film sweeps you
along with its pace and innovation and leaves you breathless and
exhausted at the end.</P>
