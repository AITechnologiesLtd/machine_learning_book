<P>RIDE WITH THE DEVIL A film review by Athan Bezaitis.  Copyright
filmcritic.com 1999.</P>
<P>Hands down, this is the best Civil War movie since GLORY.  RIDE WITH THE
DEVIL is captivating from the opening scene and its eclectic cast is
shockingly powerful.  Don't worry about Jewel ruining anything; she
convincingly makes the transition from pop star to actress, and Jeffrey
Wright's (BASQUIAT, CELEBRITY) performance of a former slave fighting
for the Confederacy is unprecedented and chillingly realistic.  I have
no clue what they were thinking with such a misleading title -- RIDE
WITH THE DEVIL isn't some supernatural, special effects-laden, cheesy
line-filled, end-of-the-millennium dud; it's a movie about a perspective
of American history rarely talked about in classrooms across the
country.  The plot sympathizes with the ideals of the Confederate
bushwhackers fighting a guerilla-style war against the Union Jay Hawks-
and to its credit; it almost makes you believe in their cause.</P>
<P>Our protagonist is Jake Roedel, (Tobey Maguire – THE ICE STORM) a young
Missouri-raised son of a poor Dutch immigrant, and he along with his
child hood buddy Jack Bull Chiles, the son of a Missouri plantation
owner, (Skeet Ulrich -- AS GOOD AS IT GETS, CHILL FACTOR) join up as
bushwhackers when their homes and families are seized by Union
soldiers.  They both become skilled gunmen and execute daring raids on
Union soldiers and sympathizers.  By 1862, their unit, headed by Black
John (James Caviezel), includes George Clyde (Simon Baker) and Clyde's
loyal former slave Daniel Holt (Jeffrey Wright).  With a harsh winter
looming, the Bushwhackers must disperse and find shelter.  Several
members hole up in a hidden hillside dugout.  While in hiding, their
food and supplies are provided by the young widow Sue Lee (Jewel).  When
casualties are taken from a Jay Hawk surprise attack the group is
splintered and Jake and Holt are united as soldiers in solidarity.  As
the war rages on, most of their remaining Bushwhacker compatriots are
either dead or lost on the Southern cause, so Jake and Holt must decide
whether to keep the fight alive or flee west.</P>
<P>The production of the film is outstanding; the settings, costumes,
imagery, and soundtrack add a strong dose of reality to the characters.
The gunfights are as exciting as any war movie I've seen, and the
dialogue is also vintage mid-1800s Southern jargon, which Ulrich pulls
off surprisingly well.  The real gold nugget of the film however is
Jeffrey Wright's character: Daniel Holt is a Southern black man fighting
against Northerners.  In principle, he's killing those who are fighting
for the freedom of his people.  This role has rarely been touched, if
ever, in modern filmmaking, however the reality of the situation is that
there actually were a number of black Southerners who fought for the
Confederacy, many of whom thought that it would lead to better treatment
after the war.  Throughout the film Holt's emotions are expectedly
hidden but when he reveals some inner demons the film is at its peak.</P>
<P>Believe me, I can understand why you wouldn't want to see it.  Jewel,
Skeet Ulrich, and nobody else you've ever heard of.  It's sounds hard to
take seriously, right?  Every once in a while a good one comes along
against the odds and that's the case here.  Director Ang Lee (SENSE AND
SENSIBILITY) has done a fantastic job and this film is really worth
watching, even at two hours and ten minutes.  I still haven't figured
out what RIDE WITH THE DEVIL means exactly, but it would be a travesty
if a lame title kept this one from being a real success.</P>
