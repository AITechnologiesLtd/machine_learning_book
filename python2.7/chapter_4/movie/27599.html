<P>For 107 minutes, "The Wedding Planner," a distressingly lifeless romantic 
comedy directed by Adam Shankman, stands as an embarrassment for every person 
that was involved in its creation. With the commitment of such talented movie 
stars as Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey, it is destined to stand as a 
negative footnote in both of their careers, as neither one even give us the 
pleasure of good performances. Lopez's strong point is most certainly not 
comedy, as she consistently resembles a deer caught in the headlights, while 
McConaughey simply looks bored. Together, they flounder and desperately 
overact in an attempt to bring life to the charmless screenplay, hideously 
written by Pamela Falk and Michael Ellis, and insipid direction by first-time 
director Shankman.</P>
<P>Mary Fiore (Jennifer Lopez) has been a dedicated and highly successful 
wedding planner for five years, effortlessly controlling everything involved 
in the festivities. In fact, so much of her time is taken up by her 
profession that romance has been absent from her personal life for two whole 
years. That all changes when she has a strained meet-cute with doctor Steve 
Edison (Matthew McConaughey), who saves her from a runaway garbage cart. 
Following a magical night which they spend watching an old movie in a San 
Francisco park, Mary is appalled to discover a couple days later that Steve 
is engaged to marry her latest client, Fran Donolly (Bridgette 
Wilson-Sampras). Forced to work with the couple as she plans their wedding, 
Mary cannot help but fall for Steve, who is likewise beginning to have doubts 
about Fran being "the one" for him.</P>
<P>The romantic comedy genre is one that you don't really expect to be 
unpredictable. In almost all cases, the two unlikely lovers end up together 
in the end. Because of this, it is vital that the film exhibit at least a 
modicum of sweetness and entertainment value, with the two characters 
invoking charisma together. Take the similar 1998 film, "The Wedding Singer," 
for example, which wasn't the least bit surprising in the story department, 
but flourished because of its bright writing and the standout performances by 
Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. The makers of "The Wedding Singer" had their 
hearts in exactly the right place, and it ended up being one of the best 
comedies of that respective year. "The Wedding Planner" is almost a carbon 
copy of every romantic comedy ever made, but its humor never fails to fall 
flat, and the whole production seems to be stuck on autopilot.</P>
<P>It cannot be denied that Jennifer Lopez (2000's "The Cell") and Matthew 
McConaughey (2000's "U-571") are attractive performers, but they are walking 
stiffs in this film, and their characters offer up no rooting interest. The 
supporting cast are a little better, but they, too, often overact with the 
skill of an untrained tiger. Judy Greer (2000's "What Women Want") at least 
has some fun as Mary's friend and coworker, which is more than can be said 
for the two main stars. The only two actors who come away unscathed are 
Bridgette Wilson-Sampras (2000's "Beautiful") and Justin Chambers (1999's 
"Liberty Heights"), who bring dignity and intelligence to their roles of 
Steve and Mary's potential suitors. Wilson-Sampras is especially good, and 
the final scene between her and McConaughey is one of the few well-written 
passages in the entire picture. Tellingly, it is a quiet, dramatic sequence, 
leading one to hypothesize that the movie might have been more successful 
without all of the stupid slapstick, which is not helped by Mervyn Warren's 
cartoonish, nails-on-a-blackboard music score. </P>
<P>You would think that romantic comedies would be one of the simplest genres to 
write for. After all, they don't ask much in the way of creativity, and only 
require the assistance of a sturdy screenplay and a cute couple. When even 
those slight requirements are not met, as they fail to be in "The Wedding 
Planner," you know that the whole enterprise is in serious trouble. By the 
time Lopez and McConaughey reunite at the end to consummate their love for 
one another in the crucial final scene, I caught my mind wandering to "The 
Pledge," the far superior film I saw right before this one. That is as 
telling a final statement as anything in "The Wedding Planner."</P>
