<P>     Ever wonder what makes mediocre thrillers like MALICE and BASIC
INSTINCT entertaining?  Perhaps it has something to do with watching
dozens of awful mass market entries into the genre, then hoping for
something just a little better.  Take THE TIE THAT BINDS, for
example--something scraped off the bottom of the barrel.  Nearly every
print and television ad compares this film to 1992's THE HAND THAT
ROCKS THE CRADLE.  As far as I'm concerned, the comparison is valid.
Both are inept, hard-to-swallow flicks that offer more in the way of
cheap shocks than legitimate scares.  For writer-turned-director Wesley
Strick, this is not an auspicious debut.</P>
<P>     The characters and plot situations are harvested from stock.
There's the happy couple, Russell and Dana Clifton, played with bland
sincerity--and not a whole lot of energy--by Vincent Spano and Moira
Kelly.  Then there's the psychotic pair, John and Leann Netherwood,
essayed with over-the-top insincerity--and far too much energy--by
Keith Carradine and Daryl Hannah.  The Netherwoods, who spend most of
their waking hours robbing houses and killing people, have a six-year
old little girl named Janie (Julia Devin).  When one of their capers go
bad, she's captured by the authorities and placed in an orphanage.
Days later, along come the Cliftons, eager to adopt.  Janie's smile
wins Dana over, and the three become a family.  The only problem is
that John and Leann want their daughter back, and they leave a trail of
bodies behind them in an attempt to fulfill that aim.</P>
<P>     One of the reasons THE TIE THAT BINDS doesn't work is that it's
boring--not a good sign for a picture that's supposed to keep viewers
on the edge of their seats.  I suppose the various random killings are
designed to spice things up, but when there's no discernable character
depth or development beyond the obvious, an audience tends not to
identify with or care about the protagonists or antagonists.  The first
hour is flabby and meandering, and when the rousing, by-the-numbers
climax finally arrives, it comes too late.</P>
<P>     Strick shows his inexperience with a grating tendency towards
obviousness--moments of subtlety are few.  Granted, he doesn't have a
great script to work with, but he fails to build on what potential
exists.  There's more lethargy than tension, and it's too easy to guess
the ending ahead of time (like right after the opening credits).  Plus,
apparently thrown in for good measure is the oldest thriller cliche:
the ubiquitous car that won't start.  Had Strick presented this scene
tongue-in-cheek, it might have been worth a chuckle, but the whole
thing is played distressingly straight.</P>
<P>     THE TIE THAT BINDS has far more to offer on the subject of what it
takes to be a real parent than what to do when a couple of psychos come
calling.  There are some early, "family" scenes with Spano, Kelly, and
Devin that are handled relatively well, but the contrivances of the
plot don't allow them to last for long.  Given the lack of an
intelligent script or any "big name" stars, it seems unlikely that
audiences will flock to this feature, but that's a chancy prediction.
Regardless of box office take, however, at least this film opened at
the right time of the year--it's about as unremarkable as most of its
companion late-summer releases.</P>
