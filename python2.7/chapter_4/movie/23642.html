Romeo Must Die</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Glaring streaks of reflected streetlights rebound off a black sedan as it
parks sharply next to a silver sports car. Beat. Like synchronized swimmers,
five doors swing open, five Chinese thugs in suits step out. Beat. Camera
pans sharp Chinese guy with cool shades as he pops out of sports car to lead
the gang into hip-hip club for a little "exercise." Cool is the paint of
this American-made Hong Kong-style martial arts film.</P>
<P>Rival gangs attempt to curb contempt for each other in order to secure a
jointly profitable business deal. Asian family on one side, African American
on the other. Mutual respect via mutual fear. News of an irresponsible
murder of one prominent member compromises the truce and prompts Jet Lee to
bust his Hong Kong prison chains and fly to the States to avenge his
brother's death. He's not interested in truces or illegal commerce - he
wants revenge.</P>
<P>In his search for the slayer Jet stumbles across help from the daughter of
the black gang's leader; she's recording artist, Aaliyah - Juliet (if you
will). Top rap artist, DMX also makes an appearance.</P>
<P>The high powered warlords are brought to real life with conviction by Delroy
Lindo and Henry O, their second-in-commands (Isaiah Washington and Russell
Wong) also do a kick-butt job of acting and re-acting. Pawn thug, Anthony
Anderson, maneuvers smoothly between punches and punch lines. He's very
funny.</P>
<P>Jet li, of course, is loveably dangerous, saying it all as he silently
shuffles across an oriental garden bridge carrying his late brother's
deflated basketball. Well, actually, he does have a bit more to say with his
fists, twists and computer graphic assists. In one charming brawl, Lee
manages to de-belt his opponent. As the pants fall to the ground, Lee
fastens the poor guy's harry leg to his head with the belt.</P>
<P>Though this is definitely an action flick, "Romeo" does a fair job of
portraying compelling and interesting relationship pairings in-between and
during scuffles. Hand-to-hand and Heart-to-heart, and don't forget the
tasteful funnybone-to-funnybone relief. Not in the now-popular, laden
fashion via comedic-costar as in "Rush Hour," here the humor is an added
flavor, not an equal balance.</P>
<P>Aside from acceptable improbabilities in fight set-ups etc., "Romeo's" only
mars are: 1) D.B. Woodside wavers in his role as gang-leader Isaac's number
one son. 2) a scene in which a Mercedes catches up to a BMW motorcycle in
less than 100 feet. I don't think so. 3) Strong from beginning to end, the
climax isn't weak, but not as resounding as the beginning and middle,
despite the low frequency thuds that resonate front row seats as the titans
plant fist to bone.</P>
<P>Still these imperfections are no match for the strong acting, fun dialogue,
graceful agility of Jet Li, and cool direction of first time director
Andrzej Bartkowiak. It's just a big cool fun movie.</P>
