A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Joe Chappelle</PRE>
<P>Written by: Dean Koontz and Tegan West, from a novel by Dean Koontz</P>
<P>Starring: Rose McGowan, Joanna Going, Ben Affleck, Peter O'Toole</P>
<P>Ingredients: 
Giant blob creature, four people trapped in a small mountain town</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
A giant ancient petroleum-based blob creature who thinks of itself as
Satan has killed a small town of 400 people, but it has left four people
alive: a sheriff (Ben Affleck),  a doctor and her sister (Rose McGowan,
Joanna Going), and a scientist (Peter O'Toole). Because the blob thinks
that it is Satan, it wants the four survivors alive to 'spread its
gospel.' Instead, the four people intelligently try to figure out a way
to kill the thing. Will they succeed?</P>
<P>Opinion: 
The movie starts out pretty well. A lady doctor and her sister are
driving their vehicle in the sunny mountains. They pass by a sign that
says, 'Snowfield, 4 miles.' Then the creepy music sets in. No sooner do
the sisters reach the town than they discover (gasp!) that everyone in
town is dead. In a better movie they might find themselves in a battle
for survival against an evil creature. But in this movie the evil
creature has already determined it wants the heroes to live, so there is
not much chance of the women ever being in danger. That's where the
movie begins to lose suspense; the audience already knows the girls can
never get hurt. The other thing is, since the blob has already killed
everyone in town in the first minute of the movie, there is not much for
it to do the rest of the movie but sit around and wait for people to
spread its 'gospel.' This doesn't make for an exciting or believable
movie. There are a couple of scenes were tentacles jump out of dead
people, and giant butterfly attacks the police, but it doesn't help the
movie gain any momentum.</P>
