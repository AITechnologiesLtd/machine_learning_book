Susan Granger's review of "AT FIRST SIGHT" (MGM)</PRE>
<P> Based on a true medical case of a blind man who was able to
see again, Irwin Winkler's film revolves around Virgil Adamson, played
by Val Kilmer ("Batman"), who was totally blind from the age of three
because of a combination of retinitis pigmetosa and congenital
cataracts, despite the painful probing and pondering of "experts"
ranging from eye surgeons to faith healers. Resigned to his condition,
he becomes an incredibly skilled and gifted massage therapist at an
Adirondack Mountain resort. That's where he meets a workaholic
architect (Mira Sorvino) who falls under the spell of his magic
fingers. Convinced by his new client who marvels at his emotional
depth, and ignoring the warnings of his wary, protective older sister
(Kelly McGillis), he submits to the ministrations of a top
ophthalmologist at Manhattan Eye and Ear Hospital (Bruce Davison) who
promises miracles - and, in fact, delivers sight to Virgil. But how
Virgil interprets what he is suddenly able to "see" is another
thing. Thousands of unexplainable images assault him. He stands in the
midst of New York's fast-moving traffic, unable to believe that a
speeding car could hurt him. When he spots his image in a mirror, he
says "hello" and is curious why he gets no reply.  He is confused by
"flirting" and bewildered by "disappointment." Val Kilmer wears a
moronic smile through much of the drama, rendering his performance
wooden, and Mira Sorvino doesn't fare much better.  Only a cameo by
Nathan Lane elicits real laughter. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to
10, "At First Sight" is a philosophical 5, echoing the sentiment of
the blind jazz pianist Ray Charles, who once said he wouldn't want his
sight restored because he senses a greater authenticity in his present
condition.</P>
