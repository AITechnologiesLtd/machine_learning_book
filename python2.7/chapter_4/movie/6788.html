<P>     Neither sequel nor equal to A FISH CALLED WANDA, this zoo-keeping
British comedy reunites the original cast-- and a portion of the
original production crew-- with looser, if not downright lazier results.
The timing isn't as sharp, the pace isn't as brisk, and the four
characters aren't nearly as tight together as an ensemble.  Both Michael
Palin and Jamie Lee Curtis are wasted, but, hey, that leaves the door
wide open for John Cleese and Kevin Kline to steal the show.  And they
do.  Kline actually plays two roles, including his character's father.
His younger self is a slightly sillier variation on Otto, his Oscar-
winning WANDA role.  Cleese treads equally familiar ground with an
update of his "Fawlty Towers" television character.  His script (co-
written with Iain Johnstone) rehashes several better-known Basil bits,
which, for the newcomer, should have them in stitches.  The seasoned
hotel guest, however, may react with less than total hilarity.  Sorry,
sorry, sorry.</P>
