<P>   Joan Baez, while hardly a stay-at-home woman, loved to
sing the lyrics of Marty Tipton's Appalachian folk song
during the seventies: "Hard is the fortune of all womankind,/
She's always controlled, she's always confined,/ Controlled by
her parents until she's a wife,/ A slave to her husband all the
rest of her life."  This was obviously before she saw the
movie "Heartbreakers," definitive proof that men are the
weaker sex--or, as Harry Belafonte would chime in, "Put the
man and the woman together, to see which one is smarter,"
coming the conclusion that the latter will always emerge
victorious.</P>
<P>  "Heartbreakers could be called the women's revenge for
Frank Oz's 1988 comedy, "Dirty Rotten Scoundels," which
despite the presence of Oscar ceremony host Steve Martin is
no more than a pleasant parody about a male con artist who
takes women for a ride.  A better one, Preston Sturges's "The
Lady Eve," featured Barbara Stanwyck as a ripoff maestro
who makes the moves on the wealthy Henry Fonda.</P>
<P>    The David Mirkin ("Romy and Michel's High School
Reunion") story is of two strong women not unaccustomed to
twisting men about their fingers by setting them up in a scam
which, looking at its possibilities in the real world, simply
would not result in capturing any bucks at all.  The
mother-daughter team of Angela Nardino (Sigourney Weaver)
and Wendy (Jennifer Love Hewitt) sets up men by having
them fall in love with and marrying mom who, finding
an excuse not to consummate the union on the wedding
night, arranges to have her little girl organize them into a
compromising position.  Caught in the act (although nothing
really happens), the men come across with fat settlements
rather than have the cases go before a court which--in at
least one case--would have the effect of ruining a crooked
guy's profitable business.</P>
<P>   The film was a big surprise for me as I had gone into this
thinking it would be yet some more commercial pap, more
sentimental than cynical and with gags that would not
challenge the mentality of my 10-year-old terrier.  Yet
"Heartbreakers" was involving throughout its two-hour running
time and did not at all depend on the expertise of Gene
Hackman to bring it to life a half-hour into the game.</P>
<P>   Fans of "Hannibal" will get a kick out of seeing Ray Liotta
with his head screwed back on.  Liotta performs in the role of
a stolen-car serviceman, Dean Cumanno, who falls madly in
love with the sexy Angela only to be left high and literally dry
on his icy wedding night.  The following morning, his attention
is riveted on his pretty receptionist, Wendy, and while she is
engaging him under the desk the two are caught in the act by
the "heartbroken" Angela.  Looking to make one last score
before they hang up their uplift bras, the two hone in on
aging billionaire tobacco executive, William B. Tensy (Gene
Hackman), figuring that even if he doesn't buy the daughter's
mock seduction after marrying Angela, he might do them a
favor by dropping dead, thereby leaving them the major part
of three billion dollars.  Perpetually puffing on his product, the
liver-spotted Tensy not only kills a parrot instantly with
second-hand smoke but brags about his experiments
addicting nine-year-olds with the weed.  This movie does
more to deride the tobacco industry than Michael Mann's
"The Insider" could.</P>
<P>   In the film's only sentimental motif, Wendy risks falling in
love with Jack Withrowe (Jason Lee), owner of prime property
in California's Palm Beach--the very hazard that her mother
had warned her against.</P>
<P>   The fifty-one-year-old Sigourney Weaver never looked
better, figuratively running rings around her adorable but too
outwardly meanspirited daughter played by Hewitt.  The
mother-daughter combination works well, giving the audience
the impression of a love-hate relationship between a girl of
scarcely twenty years old wanting independence and her own
life while at the same caring deeply about her and respecting
the moneymaking schemes on which they thrive.  Jason Lee
does fine as a somewhat goofy and naive owner of a bar,
unwilling to see that he is being taken for a ride despite
ample evidence, and Saturday Night Live's Nora Dunn has a
grand moment as Miss Madress, a billionaire's housekeeper
not fond of letting any woman into the life of her aging
employer.  </P>
<P>   Except for Lee's character, there's no one among these
dirty rotten scoundrels that you'd want to take home (wait: I
take that back), but who cares?  This is a well-paced,
genuinely amusing piece of work that subverts the tobacco
industry as well as the more potentially deadly institution of
marriage.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running time: 123 minutes.  (C) 2001 by
