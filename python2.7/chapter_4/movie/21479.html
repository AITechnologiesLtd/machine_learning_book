<PRE>Happy, Texas
Directed by:  Mark Illsley
Starring: Jeremy Northam, Steve Zahn, Ally Walker, Illeana
Douglas, William H. Macy
Running time:  100 minutes
My rating (5 star scale):  ****</PRE>
<P>Harry, a con man, (Northam) and Wayne Wayne Wayne, a car thief, 
(Zahn) are prisoners working on a chain gang in Texas.  They 
fight with a third prisoner and all three find themselves 
free due to a freak accident.  Harry and Wayne steal a van
belonging to a gay couple, David and Steven.  Soon they find
themselves in Happy, Texas and mistaken for the gay duo by
the local police chief (William H. Macy).  David and Steven 
specialize in little girl beauty pageants.  The citizens of 
Happy are desperate to win the Little Miss Fresh-Squeezed 
Beauty Pageant and have hired David and Steven to prepare 
their girls.  </P>
<P>Harry and Wayne decide to stick it out when they discover
how much money there is in the local bank.  They intend to
rob it.  The bank is run by Josephine (Ally Walker of 
Profiler fame).  Things get a little complicated as Harry 
falls for Josephine, the police chief falls for Harry, and
Wayne finds himself trapped with in a room full of little 
girls who expect him to teach them a winning number.</P>
<P>This is the kind of film that could easily be over the top
and not funny.  Instead, it is very funny.  It's directed
with a light touch and the performances are excellent.
Some of the best scenes are of Wayne trying to teach his
girls - who respond surprisingly well to his tactics.  Also
great is the date Harry has with the chief.  Macy gives 
his usual outstanding performance (when will he get the
lead role he deserves) and Walker is surprisingly good given
her mediocre performance on tv. There's even a small role
by Ron Perlman who always makes a movie for me.</P>
<P>I laughed throughout this film.  It's well structured and 
makes the premise work.  The laughs come fast and frequent 
and the plot loopholes are easily overlooked.  If you want
to see a funny film that doesn't focus on bodily fluids,
see Happy, Texas.</P>
