<P>Almost three years to the day after the release of Good Will Hunting,
Finding Forrester hits theatres with a similar but equally effective
story.  The connection extends beyond just a comparable script, since
both films were directed by Gus Van Sant.  Even more remarkable is the
source of the two scripts – the first was an out-of-left-field Oscar
winner penned by two struggling actors (Matt Damon and Ben Affleck),
while the second comes via a Portland radio personality.  And I won't
even get started on the surprise cameo in Forrester's epilogue.</P>
<P>Replacing Damon's Will Hunting is 16-year-old Jamal Wallace (Robert
Brown, in his acting debut), a promising basketball player and C-student
at Bronx's Coolidge High School.  Like Will, Jamal is whip-smart, but
hides his talent because he doesn't want to stand out.  He reads all the
heavy-hitters that usually scare off kids his age and even writes
religiously in a journal, which has recently grown into its fifth
volume.</P>
<P>One night, Jamal is dared by his friends to break into the apartment of
a ghost-like local legend known as The Window (a name garnered from
wielding a pair of binoculars from his third-story window).  Jamal gets
in to the mystery man's home, but he's spooked and accidentally leaves
his backpack (with journals) behind.</P>
<P>The next day, The Window (Sean Connery, Entrapment) unceremoniously
drops Jamal's backpack to the street, where the surprised student
discovers his journals have been covered in red pen corrections,
culminating with one question on the last page – `Where are you taking
me?'  Curious, Jamal goes to The Window's apartment, where the two
slowly develop a rapport revolving around writing.</P>
<P>What Jamal doesn't know is that hard-drinking man is really William
Forrester, the reclusive author of `Avalon Landing,' a Pulitzer
Prize-winning work heralded as The Great American Novel of the 20th
Century. Forrester disappeared after achieving incredible fame through
his first novel and has spent the last few decades holed up in his Bronx
apartment avoiding everyone and everything (a la J.D. Salinger and his
`The Catcher in the Rye').</P>
<P>When Jamal transfers to Manhattan prep school Mailor/Callow, he is
greeted with open arms because of his basketball abilities.  Nobody in
the school thinks he could possibly be interested in an education and,
as a result, Jamal grows a major chip on his shoulder because everybody
assumes he's some dumb black kid.  Meanwhile, Forrester is similarly
pissed at the world for assuming they know what his novel was really
about.  The two stories are nicely paralleled, without being too
obvious.</P>
<P>The antagonist in Forrester is a stuffy prick English professor (played
by F. Murray Abraham) who doesn't believe Jamal is capable of the
writing assignments he's been turning in.  The film comes together over
a writing contest at Mailor/Callow, which, although entirely
predictable, had me a bit choked up.</P>
<P>Van Sant, who followed up his Oscar-nominated Hunting with an
ill-advised, Razzie-winning, shot-for-shot remake of Hitchcock's Psycho,
does a fantastic job here with deejay Mike Rich's script.  Forrester
opens with a series of lovely shots of the Bronx and remains remarkably
well-paced throughout.  Even the basketball action is done nicely, and
better than we've recently seen in Love and Basketball and He Got Game,
which is pretty surprising, considering Van Sant is, essentially, an
indie film director.</P>
<P>Actingwise, Connery can do no wrong, no matter how lowly the project
(see Entrapment for further proof), but newcomer Brown steals the show
as the jaded teen whose life is altered by a chance encounter.  Anna
Paquin (Almost Famous) does a good job in her supporting role as Jamal's
classmate, and, thankfully, the film isn't slowed down by an unneeded
relationship between the two.  Technically, Forrester is a slick little
package, wonderfully photographed by The Yards' Harris Savides and
edited by Valdis Oskarsdóttir, the veteran of three Dogme films.</P>
<P>2:10 –PG-13 for brief strong language and some sexual references</P>
