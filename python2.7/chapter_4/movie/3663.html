<PRE>                             THE PEREZ FAMILY
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Back in 1980, the U.S. and Castro reached an agreement whereby
Fidel would allow thousands of Cubans to emigrate to the U.S.  This
became known as the Mariel boatlift.  Among those who in the film who
are on one of the boats is the hyper, lovely, sexy, irrepressible
Dottie (Marisa Tomei) and a handsome man, Juan Raul Perez (Alfred
Molina).  Juan has just been freed after 20 years in jail and expects
to have his wife Carmela (Anjelica Huston) waiting for him when the
boat docks.  In the turmoil of the landings, the going through a not
particularly friendly Immigration, they do not meet and she assumes he
is dead.</P>
<P>     Miami's Little Havana is colorfully photographed but only a hint
of the miserable conditions that exist there that have made it the
capital of crime in the U.S., is actually shown.  While not a political
film, it would not have hurt to show that the freedom the refugees
expected to find in the U.S. was not entirely all that they had been
lead to believe.  Drugs, prostitution, crowded conditions, are more or
less skimmed over.  Rather than a political film it is a romantic
comedy.</P>
<P>     When the detective (Chazz Palminteri), looking for illegal aliens,
arrives at Carmela Perez's home he is instantly smitten with her.  She,
for her part, thinking her husband is dead in Cuba, is amenable to his
advances.  Palminteri is one of the finest actors currently appearing
on the screen.  He looks like a Hollywood stereotypical Italian
gangster (he was the gangster in THE BRONX TALE ... and also wrote
the story) ... and was the gangster whose job it was to watch over
the dumb blond actress in Woody Allen's BULLETS OVER BROADWAY.  But
he exudes a certain charm, a goodness and kindness that are always
evident.  He is in a class by himself.</P>
<P>     Most of the story concerns getting together a Perez family as the
more there are in the family, the less time will have to be spent
before being released in Miami.  The hilarious comedy scenes derive
from getting this mythical family together to present to Immigration
and sexy Dottie will knock you out with her innocence, charm and
wiggling.</P>
<P>     Everyone in the cast is terrific but Tomei (who put on 20 pounds
on her derriere so she could swing it wildly) and her wholesome lovely
smile and good humor are what carries the movie.</P>
<PRE>Directed by Ms. Mira Nair.</PRE>
