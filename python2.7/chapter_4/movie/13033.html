<PRE>Bulworth
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1998 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Senator Bulworth (Warren Beatty) is a man facing his own demons. Coming from
an idealistic liberal beginning, he's now in bed with lobbyists and has sold
out everything he believed in. In the middle of a re-election campaign he's a
man with a plan. "Buying" a huge life insurance policy in exchange for voting
correctly, he then hires an unknown assassin to kill him.</P>
<P>With the new found freedom, Bulworth discovers life. He begins telling the
truth as he sees it - a definite no-no for a politician. In the beginning his
pronouncements are convoluted. He tells an all-black church that unless they
stop eating chicken wings and backing OJ, they'll never be rid of people like
him. At a Hollywood fund-raiser, he condemns movies as shoddy products and
says that the only reason that he's there is because they are all rich Jews.</P>
<P>At a Black after-hours club, he begins to have some fun. Dancing with the
luscious Halle Berry in one of the most erotic scenes ever involving two
vertical people, he falls for her and decides that he wants to live. Now he
has to figure out how to call off the contract.</P>
<P>There are some fascinating aspects of the film. The story follows traditional
mythological aspects of a heroic journey. The lost man travels deep into the
underworld to discover his soul and finds truth. Reborn a new person, he
attempts to right wrongs.
There is also the political angle. In this arena, the movie seems somewhat
anachronistic. It's a film that could have been made years ago and although
the circumstances are still the same, that portion seems dated.</P>
<P>The confusion comes when these two are mixed. Just when Bulworth's search for
his new life is becoming interesting, the election throws that line off track.
The assassination device also is troublesome. While it works to get the story
into gear, after that it gets in the way. Bulworth's dodging his murderer is a
waste of time in what is an otherwise enticing film.</P>
<P>Two weeks after mulling over the movie in the vast recesses of the back of my
mind, there are still a few things that I can't get a grasp on. The most
wondrous character in the film is an elderly homeless man who runs into
Bulworth at opportune times to say...something. He ties into the mythological
journey but how? Who is he and what is his purpose in the film? Either I'm too
dim to understand or he (and a few other scenes) is tossed in the mix just for
weirdness. I would prefer to think it's the latter.</P>
<P>Bulworth is a well-constructed ride and thought-provoking. The answers aren't
readily apparent and maybe that's a good thing.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman has written this column for over 23 years and realizes that
the Summer Solstice is just around the corner. Time flies when it rains every
day. <A HREF="mailto:Redman@bvoice.com">Redman@bvoice.com</A> is an eaddress for random notes.)</P>
