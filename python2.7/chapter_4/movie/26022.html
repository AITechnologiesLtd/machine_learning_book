<P>I've been hearing about this "up and coming" actress named Penelope Cruz for
what seems like years now. She's the next Salma Hayek...she's the next big
thing...she's this...she's that! Alright, now here was my first opportunity
to actually see her on the big screen. To be honest, I was pretty sick of
hearing about her and just wanted to get this over with already. To my
surprise, she was actually quite charming. In fact, I can freely admit that
she owns this film! If you don't like her or her personality, the film will
not win you over. If you are taken by her (which I was), you will be swept
away like many others. Now get ready to be taken on a Cruz...</P>
<P>PLOT:
A story about love, motion sickness and the art of cooking. A strange
description but certainly an accurate one. This film is about a beautiful
woman who loves to cook but cannot allow others to "control" her, due to her
motion sickness. She must always be "on top" of things. After finding her
husband cheating on her, she flies off to San Francisco to start anew. An
instant cooking star in America, she is eventually tracked down by her
wayward husband and asked to love again. Will she? Can she? Should she? Find
out...</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A cute comedic fantasy romance whipped out of a recipe with a pleasant bossa
nova groove, a LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE-type story, and dessert featuring
the adorable Penelope Cruz. This film is very light on its feet. It doesn't
take itself too seriously and doesn't ask that any audience member does
either. It's filled with fun Brazilian tunes, bright colors, tasty settings,
magical moments, easy humor and dashes of romance. It seems to be wrapped up
in a neat little bow asking for you to love it, and with Penelope Cruz's
enchanting charisma, it succeeded in tangling me in its web of fluffy
amusement. Do the characters attain any deep states of consciousness? Not
really. Is the ending telegraphed from scene one? Pretty much. But this
isn't that kind of film. It's the type of movie that you see in order to
"watch the pretty colors", or in this case, the pretty people, settings and
cuisine. I enjoyed it all the way through. It was an easy watch, moved along
at a rapid pace and presented just enough mystical mumbo-jumbo for me to buy
into its fantastical elements.</P>
<P>Not sure if "regular" audiences are ready to accept the
fantasy/comedy/romance combo, but I'm confident that this will find at least
a certain niche of red-hot lovers out there. The one thing that is sure
about this movie is that it's all about Penelope! She's glued to the camera
for the entire picture, with close-ups, tight shots and body parts swaying
across the screen throughout (no nudity though!). She makes this film with
her wonderful smile, her cuter-than-Hayek accent and her oh-so seductive
appeal. Is she a good actress? Sure. For what the role demands, she was
perfect but certainly could've benefited from a few more third-dimensional
characters around her. Everyone from her comic-relief-based best friend to
her Antonio Banderas Jr. boyfriend was decent, but mostly underwritten.
Ultimately, the film touches everything with a "light" brush. Light drama,
light humor, light fantasy, light performances, a light soundtrack and a
light ending. Personally, the film won me over with its top performance by
Cruz and its groovy tunes. For those who have seen LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE,
consider this its light American cousin. Perfect for dates and those cozy
late nites together in front of the VCR. A delicious fairy tale that goes
down easy.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
This is actress Penelope Cruz's first English-speaking lead role, despite
having over a dozen films to her credit, and already being a superstar in
her native Spain. She is probably best known in the States for her role in
the Oscar-winning film ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER, by Pedro Almodovar. Her upcoming
American projects set her up with Matt Damon (ALL THE PRETTY HORSES), Johnny
Depp (BLOW) and Nicolas Cage (CAPTAIN CORELLI'S MANDOLIN). Ironically,
Penelope became a vegetarian after filming ALL THE PRETTY HORSES.
Screenwriter Vera Blasi suffers from motion sickness herself and also spent
much of her own childhood and teen years going back and forth between Brazil
and San Francisco (as does the main character in this film). This is her
first produced screenplay.
All of the characters in this film speak English but when they sing, they
sing in Portuguese.</P>
