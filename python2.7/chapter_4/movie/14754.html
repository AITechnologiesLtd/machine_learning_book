<PRE>                    CLAY PIGEONS (United States)
         A review by Mark R. Leeper in bullet-list form
           from the Toronto Internation Film Festival</PRE>
<P>     CAPSULE: A non-murderer who broke the law avoiding a possible
murder charge finds himself deeper and deeper in trouble.  The plot is
tightly written and reminiscent of Hitchcock's FRENZY.  Tightly paced
and well acted.  Only the very last sequence rings false.  Rating:  8
(0 to 10), high +2 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>   - Nice vicious murder mystery with a patsy caught in the middle.
   - Should appeal to the same audience that liked RED ROCK WEST.
   - The viewer (almost always) knows what is going on, but the web of
     events becomes tighter and tighter around the neck of Clay
     (Joaquin Phoenix).
   - Great little suspense thriller set in Montana (though filmed in
     Utah).  Having caught Clay fooling around with his wife Amanda
     (Georgina Cates), one guy commits suicide, framing Clay for
     murder.  Clay decides to cover up the suicide starting a bigger
     and bigger chain of events linking him with other murders.
   - Vince Vaughn steals the film as Lester Long.  Vaughn is very
     natural in front of a camera with an easy charm and grace.  (P.S.
     He also was good in RETURN TO PARADISE and is going to play Norman
     Bates in the new version of PSYCHO.)
   - Sarcastic FBI agent played by Janeane Garofalo.  "A murder scene
     is not crowd-appropriate." (That sounds a lot like Garofalo's own
     style of humor and may well have been ad-libbed.)  She makes fun
     of deputy named Barney.
   - Sound editing has loud noises on soundtrack, made this audience
     jump.
   - Final scene does not make sense logically.</P>
