<PRE>                                 JANE EYRE
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Charlotte Bronte, on whose book the film is based, was one of
three sisters.  One was Emily, also a famed author, and the other was
Anne, a poet.  As was the custom among the writers of the early and
mid-nineteenth century, the stories ended with no loose ends,
everything being pat and complete.  Charles Dickens, a bit later,
was not of that genre.  What helps make JANE EYRE so intriguing is
that much of the story came from Chartlotte's own life.  Charlotte,
like Jane (Anna Paquin, who won Best Supporting Actress in The Piano)
was brought up in her early years in a parsonage school  for orphaned
girls, later becoming a governess.  The adult Jane is played by
Charlotte Gainsbourg.</P>
<P>     Love, real love, was what she wanted in life.  While in most
situations, the governess would be an employee of the master of the
house,  Jane was made of stronger stuff so that she is more like one
of the family.  From there it follows that she and the "master,"
Rochester, (William Hurt) fall in love.</P>
<P>     While films made from classics are seldom as good as the book
itself, a good director such as we have here, is capable of  bringing
out all that the book tries to tell.  Aided by such brilliant
supporting  actors as Joan Plowright as Mrs. Fairfax, all smiles, and
Miss Scatcherd (a name Dickens would have loved) played by Geraldine
Chaplin, strict and mean, the film is one you will not want to miss.</P>
<PRE>                    Directed by Franco Zeffirelli.</PRE>
