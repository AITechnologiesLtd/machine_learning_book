<P>     Nick Park's three Wallace and Gromit shorts for Aardman Animation --
A GRAND DAY OUT, THE WRONG TROUSERS and A CLOSE SHAVE -- are examples of
inspired, brilliant film-making. Park's feature film debut -- CHICKEN RUN,
co-directed with Peter Lord -- is not. Sometimes it's hard to accept
simple quality when you've come to expect genius; I suspect I'll cry a
river of tears when John Lasseter finally produces a film that's merely
good. CHICKEN RUN is unlike virtually any other animated film you're
likely to see this summer, and not just because the characters are
manipulated pieces of clay instead of drawings or CGI creations. It's an
appealing, well-crafted film with a unique sensibility and a few
wonderfully imaginative scenes. And its script can't manage one-tenth of
the wit verbally that the rest of the film creates visually.</P>
<P>     The familiar Aardman goggle eyes and extra-wide mouths are attached
to fowl faces in CHICKEN RUN, set at a Yorkshire poultry farm. One
industrious hen named Ginger (Julia Sawalha) is ever plotting her escape
from the clutches of Mrs. Tweedy (Miranda Richardson) and Mr. Tweedy (Tony
Haygarth), but every plan she hatches is thwarted by her well-intentioned
but bumbling fellow egg-layers. Then a potential savior literally falls
from the sky: Rocky (Mel Gibson), a cocky American cock who has escaped
from his gig as "amazing flying chicken" with the circus. Rocky has
wounded a wing in his crash landing, but Ginger sees him as the final
piece of the escape puzzle. After all, if Rocky can fly, he can surely
teach the chicks of Tweedy Farm a thing or two about getting airborne.</P>
<P>     The broad structure of CHICKEN RUN is a satire of World War II POW
films -- Ginger and her pals are "inmates" of Coop 17 -- but the genre
gags form only a tiny part of the film. The rest of the narrative involves
a fairly banal bickering relationship between Ginger and Rocky,
occasionally jazzed up by a nod to the love-hate relationship between
Brits and Yanks. The dialogue could have stuck to that angle for its
humor, but screenwriter Karey Kirkpatrick instead opts for a seemingly
endless litany of ghastly puns. Gibson, Sawalha and many of the other
performers do energetic voice work, despite the absence of much energy
devoted to developing characters. As long as the characters are flapping
their beaks, CHICKEN RUN is fairly limp stuff.</P>
<P>     That CHICKEN RUN soars highest when it's silent probably comes as no
surprise to Wallace and Gromit devotees, who know that Park has a gift for
elaborately constructed sight gags. CHICKEN RUN's finest moments showcase
that gift, from the opening credits montage of Ginger's unsuccessful
escape attempts to the climactic mid-air showdown with Mrs. Tweedy. In
between, there's the deliriously funny sequence in which Rocky comes to
Ginger's rescue when she's strapped into an automated chicken pot
pie-making machine. The clockwork comic timing is vintage Nick Park, with
the nods to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK actually underplayed so that they
simply add flavor to an already priceless set piece. And then there are
tiny pleasures like a teapot disguised as a hen, and a group of hens in a
synchronized tai chi display. The depth and texture of the clay-mation
world is satisfying enough; the things the film-makers do with that world
are a joy to behold.</P>
<P>     There's nothing about the Aardman style that demands the animated
equivalent of silent film storytelling; the classic short CREATURE
COMFORTS wedded person-on-the-street dialogue with clay critters to
charming effect. This particular story, however, has the processed flavor
of a dozen other animated films. The characters never get enough chance to
develop the personality Gromit packs into one furrowing of his plasticine
brow, because they're too busy clucking off Kirkpatrick's one-line 
groaners. I'm thoroughly convinced Nick Park has a positively glorious
feature film in him -- perhaps it's the Wallace and Gromit feature planned
for a few years hence -- but this one isn't quite it. It's an entertaining
warm-up, a few bits of brilliance packed in disposable kiddie fluff. In
short, it's simply good. When you've got a genius at your disposal, that's
not quite good enough.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 fair fowls:  7.</PRE>
