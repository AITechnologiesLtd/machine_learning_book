<PRE>SCARFACE (1983)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Mike Watson
Copyright 1998 Mike Watson</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: 4 out of 5</PRE>
<P>At one point during Brian De Palma's crime epic SCARFACE, the radiant
Michelle Pfeiffer turns to a ranting Al Pacino and pops a question
that the audience has no doubt been wanting to ask for themselves:
"Can't you stop saying 'fuck' all the time?"</P>
<P>Fucking good question, that.  It may not be an honour that instills
the filmmakers with pride, but as far as I can tell Oliver Stone's
script contains the said expletitive more times than any other film in
cinema history.</P>
<P>Yet it would be a shame if bad language is all De Palma's SCARFACE is
remembered for, because this is a damn fine gangstar flick.  The
overall structure is similar to Howard Hawks' 1932 original, but this
time the scene has switched to Miami, Florida and our anti-hero's
chosen vice is cocaine traffiking.  Pacino, sporting a thick Cuban
accent, gives one the best performances of his career (Golden Globe
nominated) as Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee with a criminal past who
flees Castro and comes to America to live the American Dream.</P>
<P>And live it out he does, with lashings of violence, abuse, murder and
the funny white powder.  From his earliest jobs as a drug runner for
various middlemen, Tony Montana makes it clear to everyone he meets
that he's not a man to be fucked (sorry).  Soon he's the king of the
cocaine heap, but his hot head and an increasingly out of control drug
addiction prove his undoing.  "Never do your own stash", warns one
character early in the film.  As sure as night follows day, the
Emperor Of Miami eventually falls.</P>
<P>Writer Oliver Stone and director Brian De Palma make an explosive
combination here.  Stone's script offers solid storytelling and some
fine character development.  Montana is fascinating; uneducated but
calculating, a straight shooter who speaks from the heart; an
ambitious, violent man yet one with a conscience.  A man fiercely
protective of his beautiful 20 year old sister, not wanting her to be
sucked into the glitzy, dangerous world which he inhabits.  Pacino is
dynamite, taking to the role with a brooding, bristling energy which
in his more recent films has often degenerated into just simple
overracting.</P>
<P>Pfeiffer also registers strongly as the gangstar mole with no inner
life.  Only once does Tony express real affection for her and his
desire to have children, and even then you sense all he really wants
is a regular screw and a beautiful object to show off to his friends,
and she's happy to oblige.  This isn't as meaty a role for Pfieffer as
Sharon Stone's was in CASINO, but its an effective one nonetheless and
she aquits herself well.</P>
<P>As director, De Palma sets up a number of dramatic scenes with his
typical stylistic brauva.  The escalating tension he creates in
various mob situations - a drug deal gone wrong, an assination attempt
- is often thrilling, and in this respect he is every bit the equal of
Scorese and Coppola.</P>
<P>Where he differs from, say, Coppola's Godfather trilogy is in his
overall treatment.  Coppola gives his crime sagas an operatic sweep,
whereas in SCARFACE De Palma opts for a grittier feel.  And it
perfectly suits the material.  The only major botch is Giorgio
Moroder's mostly crap synthesier score.  It's just not right, and
unfortunately compromises the impact of some otherwise good scenes.</P>
<P>As expected, SCARFACE is very violent at times, but you shouldn't be
watching gangster movies if that upsets you.  At over two and a half
hours in length it's a true epic, and if you're a fan of the genre
you'll love f**k-filled minute of it.</P>
