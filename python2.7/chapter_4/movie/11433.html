<PRE>                               TWILIGHT
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Mystery in a minor key.  A once-
          policeman, once-detective, Harry Ross is now unpaid
          an errand boy and friend for a wealthy man.  One
          errand gets him involved in a murder.  Soon the
          complications involves blackmail and the buried
          past.  There is a lot of talk and not a lot of
          thrills in this mystery set in modern Los Angeles.
          Rating: 6 (0 to 10), +1  (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Considering that TWILIGHT is only 94 minutes long and moves at
such a slow pace, the plot is surprisingly complex, not to say
downright confusing.  The three main male characters are in their
sixties and are taking that fact rather hard.  Harry Ross (Paul Newman)
has been a cop and a detective, but these days he is a houseguest for
the well-off Jack and Catherine Ames (Gene Hackman and Susan Sarandon).
Harry pays back his hosts by being a companion for Jack and
occasionally running errands.  Two years earlier the errand was to pick
up Jack's daughter who had run off with her boy friend to Puerto
Vallarto.</P>
<P>     Given a private package to deliver to a woman runs Harry into a
man dying of a fatal dose of bullets.  The man's last act is to try to
kill Harry.  Both the police and Harry are anxious to know why.  Harry
is able to discover that the dead man was anxious to uncover the story,
never fully explained, of what happened to Catherine's first husband
before she married Jack.</P>
<P>     Director Robert Benton, director of NOBODY'S FOOL, co-wrote this
film trying for the depth of character that film had and at the same
time the sort of mystery that Newman had with HARPER.  It must have
looked good on paper.  Clearly a lot of good actors had some respect
for the production and were willing to take non-starring roles.  We see
people like Stockard Channing and James Garner in supporting roles.
M. Emmet Walsh appears just long enough to die on camera.  It is hard
to judge from a script if a mystery will be a good one or not.  While
the plot complications were convoluted, I picked out the killer early
in the film, never wavered from my belief, and I was right.  I suspect
many viewers did the same.  The film was probably made with the
assumption that audiences would want to go along with Newman's easy-
going rapport with his fellow actors, particularly James Garner with
whom easy rapport does not seem like much of an accomplishment.
However, with too much being so mellow the film robs itself of a sense
of any real tension.  Hackman tries to give some power to his role, but
there is only so much he can do playing a man dying of cancer.</P>
<P>     Of some additional interest is that the Ames mansion was really
the home of Cedric Gibbons and Delores Del Rio.  Gibbons was the art
director on films like A NIGHT AT THE OPERA, THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL,
and LUST FOR LIFE.  Del Rio was a fiery Latin beauty in films of the
1930s and 1940s. The Ames's other home was one actually built by Frank
Lloyd Wright, though never completed.</P>
<P>     The aptly named TWILIGHT seems full of characters in the twilight
of their lives and reaching a point where they think and talk rather
than act.  The point is carefully driven home that Newman's character
is still a lover, but the viewer has reason to be skeptical.  The
actors give the feel of people going gently into that good night.  I
rate TWILIGHT a 6 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
