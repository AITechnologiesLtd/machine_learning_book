<P>     BOOTY CALL is a hilarious primer on safe sex, with Jamie Foxx and
Tommy Davidson as best buds told "no glove, no love" by their equally
eager counterparts (Vivica Fox and Tamala Jones).  The boys' quest to
acquire that which must be worn-- and which must be found in the middle
of the morning and in Chinatown, no less-- leads to a predictable, but
roll-on-the-floor funny comedy of errors.  (Davidson's tug-of-war with a
dog is a classic.  And don't miss an unbilled Art Malik as one of two
punning Punjabi grocers.) Though slow in spots, only the last half-hour
is tedious.  That's when the movie moves into a hospital.  Groan.
Still, *some* medical attention may be necessary, as there's a strong
likelihood that you'll laugh your ass off.  </P>

<PRE>Notes
=====</PRE>
<P>     BOOTY CALL was screened at General Cinemas at Pleasant Valley in
Raleigh on 3/8.  Understaffed, as us- ual.  And screen #7 stinks of
mold, from four rows of water-damaged chairs.  Ugh.</P>
