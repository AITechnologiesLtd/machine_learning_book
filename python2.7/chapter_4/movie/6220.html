                          Vertigo (1958)
                  A film review by David Cowen
                   Copyright 1996 David Cowen</PRE>
<P>Currently making the rounds in major market cities, the new 70mm
restoration of Alfred Hitchcock's VERTIGO is playing to packed 
houses.  While the film has been given the title "masterpiece"
by many, and the restoration is one of the most expensive ever
done, both VERTIGO and its restoration prove to be mixed blessings --
mostly impressive, but occasionally dissapointing.  </P>
<P>VERTIGO tells the tale of John Ferguson (JAMES STEWART), known as
Scottie to his aquaintances, an ex-cop who during a chase over the
rooftops witnessed a fellow officer plummet to his doom.  This has
had a tremendous impact on Scottie, now suffering vertigo when going
as far as a couple of steps on his friend Midge's (Barbara Bel 
Geddes) stepstool, thereby taking him "out of action."  Soon, after
a call from old college chum Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), Scottie
is back on the prowl watching over Elster's wife Madeleine (Kim 
Novak) who appears to be possessed by unnatural spirits.  As Scottie
becomes more and more drawn into the case, by the stunning third act, 
the film abandons the guise of being a "thriller" and becomes a 
psychological drama focusing on the obsessive relationship between 
Kim Novak's character and Scottie.  </P>
<P>This last third of VERTIGO is what makes it a classic: the motivations
behind the Rube Goldberg contraption of the plot that dominates the
first and second acts are revealed, the story is explained, and the
film is left to examine the feelings present between Novak and Stewart.  
The portrait VERTIGO paints of love is a frightening one, one based
more on obsession and image than one of understanding or companionship.
As Scotty's desire for the image of Madeleine grows, he placates
these feelings by dominating Judy Barton (also played by Kim Novak), 
shaping and modelling her back into the image of Madeleine that he 
desires, seemingly without care for her real feelings or respect for 
her personality.  Amazingly, Stewart allows us to remains sympathetic 
with Scottie throughout the film, and it's easy to understand how the 
character's actions are motivated.  Kim Novak plays a wonderful dual 
performance with a tremendous amount of range, believable both as the 
frigid Madeleine and the earthy Judy.  </P>
<P>Unfortunately, the first two thirds of the film take the viewer
through a setup which teeters on the absurd -- and that seems  
unnecessary complex and convoluted, as if Hitchcock were bound 
by the requirement to make a mystery full of red herrings.  The 
first half of the film also has a pacing that many have described 
as "dreamlike", but could also be considered unnecessarily 
slow-paced.  These detractions, however, are worth sitting through
to reach the supurb final act.</P>
<PRE>--</PRE>
<P>While I consider the restoration of VERTIGO to be a noble and 
worthy project, I feel that the restorers made some grave errors.
While the film seems brighter and more colorful in the outdoors
scenes, it often seems artificially dark and grainy indoors.  The
grain itself is often a problem even in the light scenes: despite
the restoration, the print is far from pristine.  In the first
few seconds of many scenes, colors will shift dramatically from
dark to light, or there is excessive noise on the print.  While
I realize that the lengths to which a film can be restored 
depends on the material that the restoration crew is working with,
and that there certainly is an improvement, the picture quality 
of VERTIGO seems underwhelming when compared with, for example,
the recent release of the restored TAXI DRIVER.</P>
<P>Bernard Herrmann's jarring score to VERTIGO sounds spectacular 
in stereo, but the foley work is distracting: certain sounds 
seem much brighter and clearly defined than others, and many new 
sound effects seem unnecessary.  Scuffling footsteps, jingling 
handbags and ocean waves seem overly "bright" sounding and are 
too loud in the mix, to an extent that I caught myself laughing 
unintentionally at some of the new sound effects.  Hopefully, 
if released on video, Universal will have an engineer EQ the 
sound effects tracks again to let them sound more in place with 
the dialogue and location. </P>
<P>Despite these qualms, the new 70mm Vertigo is definately worth
seeing -- catch it while you can.</P>
