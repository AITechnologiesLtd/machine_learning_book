<P>Ron Howard's 'EDtv' is full of ideas that double back upon their own 
trails, like tricky raccoons on the run.</P>
<P>Where else but in Hollywood would you find a work that indicts 
television, made by people whose roots are in television?  Ron Howard 
starred in 'The Andy Griffith Show' and 'Happy Days.'  Rob Reiner, who 
plays Mr. Whitaker the network honcho, was the meathead Michael Stivic 
in 'All in the Family.'  Woody Harrelson, the title character's brother 
Ray, attained major airtime in 'Cheers.'  Even Clint Howard, a fixture 
in all of his brother's movies, played a couple of seasons in 'Gentle 
Ben.'</P>
<P>Their experience certainly serves them well in 'EDtv,' as we see 
realistic treatments of what goes on behind the camera.  It seems that 
each character in the film has an agenda, a collection of motives that 
are always self-serving and selfish.  In the end the film is a dead-on 
satire that entertains but, paradoxically, contradicts itself with a 
Hollywood ending.</P>
<P>A producer at a floundering cable television network, Cynthia (Ellen 
DeGeneres) conceives a risky scheme intended to boost ratings.  She runs 
a contest in which countless average citizens audition to have their 
daily lives put on the air.  What is Cynthia's hope?  That she'll save 
her own career as well as the careers of her staff.  It's a last-ditch 
attempt, and it succeeds.  Though at first the life of Ed (Matthew 
McConnaughey) appears boring (how long can viewers be captivated by 
tours of Ed's apartment and by the flavor of his down-home stories?), 
the program soon becomes as exciting as the juiciest soap opera.</P>
<P>When does the ho-hum documentary become drama?  When the camera crew 
follows Ed to his brother Ray's apartment, 'EDtv' watchers discover Ray 
has spent the night with a woman who is not his girlfriend.  Said 
girlfriend Shari (Jenna Elfman, TV's Dharma) phones immediately to 
confront Ray.  The nastiness escalates when Ed takes the crew to the 
digs of the offended Shari, his purpose to plead Ray's case.  Passionate 
whims take over, however, and we witness an unwitting kiss as Ed and 
Shari fall for each other.  What follows is not as down and dirty as 
'The Jerry Springer Show,' but still vile and savage.</P>
<P>As the title character, Matthew McConnaughey turns in his best 
performance in memory.  Ron Howard directs well the sequences in which 
we see Ed's Texas charm.  Ed is a 31 year-old under-achiever, a video 
store clerk who is unremarkable but nevertheless likable.  In previous 
roles McConnaughey seemed two-dimensional at best, but here we care 
about his character when the television show begins to make off with his 
dignity.  Sure, Ed has fun for awhile;  McConnaughey elicits our 
sympathy for Ed when things start to go really wrong.</P>
<P>Woody Harrelson has no trouble being the most flamboyant presence in the 
film.  His Ray is passionate, rascally, vindictive.  We can imagine this 
guy writing a book called 'My Brother Pissed On Me,' though he has never 
even read a book.  It's unfortunate that Harrelson's screen time 
dwindles as the film progresses.</P>
<P>Jenna Elfman is fine as Shari;  she plays well the part of being 
embarrassed by the ever-present cameras.  Shari is a driver for UPS, and 
of course becomes the object of national scrutiny as her budding, 
somewhat forbidden romance with Ed appears in every living room.  Her 
wounded act becomes stale after awhile, though.  As Ed and Ray's 
stepfather Al, Martin Landau delivers another memorable supporting 
performance.  Too bad this movie appears too early in the year to be 
remembered for the Oscars.  In a small role, Clint Howard is convincing 
as the man faced with following Ed's footsteps, coordinating the 
broadcast from the television truck.  This outing brings some 
characterization, as Clint Howard's technician has hair plugs:  "I've 
stopped payment on the plugs.  You gave me doll hair!" he rages into a 
phone at one point.  Perhaps this Howard deserves a bigger part next 
movie - his face is certainly sharp and intriguing in middle age.</P>
<P>An unusual motif is noticeable in the way characters spend their spare 
time.  As they watch television - which is always on, in homes and bars 
- these people seem constantly to be exercising.  They peddle curious 
stationary bikes, lift weights, all in pursuit of the slimness and 
fitness that the filmmakers suggest are included in the goals of average 
Americans.  Even more curious is Ed's status as blue-collar hero:  in 
fact he's a chameleon with his accent, switching from a neutral 
middle-American diction to an East Texas twang at will.  The result for 
the viewer carries a disappointing, Roseanne-like effect.  This guy's 
posing as a good old boy but embraces the same materialistic and 
romantic ends as the rest of us.</P>
<P>Another of the film's agendas is to meet the standards of political 
correctness.  In portraying the audience of Whitaker's network, the 
writers show the gamut of races and preferences:  a homosexual couple, 
an African-American couple, even a group of factory workers.  Although 
the device of highlighting these viewers' responses is right out of 'The 
Truman Show,' it serves as a fascinating sort of subplot.  Many of the 
responses themselves are hilarious, but their ultimate purpose is a 
self-reflexive parody.  Let's face it - we American viewers are the 
targets of Howard's double-edged satire.  Yes, the movie attacks the 
executive schlumps, but it also assaults the mind-sets that demand the 
type of programming of which EDtv is a sleazy example.  What you have to 
love about the film is that it pokes so much fun not only at the average 
Joe - represented by Ed Pekurney and his family - but at the average 
jerk who tunes in. </P>
<P>There's no question Ron Howard knows the formula for a slick and 
successful Hollywood movie.  In 'EDtv' he and his screenwriters, 
veterans Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, depict life's hard knocks and 
nuances;  but the last quarter of the film neatly fits back into the 
mold of happy and romantic closure.  The film is generally pleasing, 
especially in its treatment of Americans' obsession with media in all 
its crafty forms.  Ideas flow freely here, and fans can only hope that 
at least one of the films in his future will buttress Howard's headiness 
with a risky and less mainstream ending.</P>
