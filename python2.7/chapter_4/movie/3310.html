<PRE>                              WINDOW TO PARIS
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     This is a fairy tale that, despite moments of comedy, illustrates
the life in Russia now that the USSR is a thing of the past and
everyone is on his own.  The current Russia is compared with the
outside world ... and vice versa.</P>
<P>     In a no-frills apartment house in St. Petersburg an old woman has
recently died.  A young man who is a music teacher, Nikolai (Sergei
Dontsov), rents the room which is part of Gorokhov's (Victor Mikhailov)
apartment where he lives with his family.  One evening, after a night
of drinking, Nikolai and Gorokhov, in a "Through The Looking Glass"
scene, discover that behind a closet in Nikolai's room there is a
window which leads on to a roof.  Climbing down a fire escape ladder,
they head for the nearest bar to do more frolicking. Morning reveals to
them that they are in Paris.  The window that led to the roof, they
discover, leads to the rooftops of Paris.</P>
<P>     On the Parisian side, an almost similar situation is unraveling.
Here lives Nicole (Agnes Sorall) a taxidermist whose skylight faces the
same rooftops of St Petersburg.  Although Nikolai falls in love with
Nicole, the Russians are more in love with the merchandise they are now
able to get while Greed takes over.</P>
<P>     This could be the greatest deal if it were not that they discover
that the magic window closes every twenty years and that date is just
about to show up on the calendar.  What now?</P>
<P>     Director Turi Mamin takes careful aim at both sides of the newly
opened world as he shows what we already know: people are people and
that is where the world's trouble starts.  "Neighbor" means not only
someone who lives near you; it also means someone to whom you should be
kind and helpful.  Director Mamin leaves that small option up to you.</P>
