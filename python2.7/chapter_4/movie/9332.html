<PRE>                DEVIL'S ADVOCATE
 By Harvey Karten, Ph.D.
 Warner Bros./Regency Enterprises
 Director:  Taylor Hackford
 Writer:  Jonathan Lemkin, Tony Gilroy
 Cast: Keanu Reeves, Al Pacino, Charlize Theron, Jeffrey
Jones, Judith Ivey, Craig T. Nelson</PRE>
<P>  Some viewers will put "Devil's Advocate" down because,
they'll say, it's just not believable.  True, there may be a few
items in the movie that will dare you to suspend disbelief.  But
only once does it become wholly incredible: when it suggests
that anyone married to an adoring Mary Ann Lomax (Charlize
Theron) might spend one minute looking at another woman. 
Otherwise, what comes out of the supernatural thriller are
words and hints of pure gospel.  For example: "New York is
the dwelling place of demons" (said by Mrs. Lomax played by
Judith Ivey).  That lawyers sometimes tell fibs.  That vanity is
everyone's preferred sin, (without which there would be hardly
any movies).  That giving cameo appearances to Senator
Alfonse D'Amato and boxing promoter Don King is silly.  That
it is impossible for Al Pacino to be anything but magnetic in
any medium he chooses to appear.  And that Keanu Reeves
really can act.</P>
<P>   "Devil's Advocate" is a morality tale whose ingenious coda
is not simply a final unravelling.  The tack-on--for which you'll
have to wait for almost all of its 144-minute length--confirms
screenwriters Jonathan Lemkin's and Tony Gilroy's view that
we human beings never learn.  The Devil will always take the
hindmost.  </P>
<P>  Dramatizing a case in which Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves)
successfully defends an obviously guilty sleazeball on trial for
molesting a high-school kid, director Taylor Hackford
acquaints us with a professional who has not known the
meaning of the word "defeat."  When Lomax was a Florida
prosecutor, he ran up a string of sixty-four consecutive
convictions.  Now, as a defense counsel, he continues his
unbroken record of victories.  The American legal system
does allow an attorney to do his best for his client even if he
believes the latter to be at fault--that's the adversarial
system--but "Devil's Advocate" is uncomfortable with the
presumption of innocence, allowing Lomax to work out for
himself the morality or immorality of his calling.</P>
<P>   Lured to New York by the charismatic John Milton (Al
Pacino), who runs a prestigious law firm, Lomax and his drop-
dead-gorgeous wife Mary Ann take up residence in a plush
Fifth Avenue apartment against the advice of Lomax's Bible-
thumping mother (Judith Ivey).  While his wife begins to go
bonkers with boredom and loneliness, Lomax continues his
string of wins, defending a bizarre man who sacrifices goats
in his basement (Delroy Lindo) and one Alexander Cullen
(Craig T. Nelson), a tycoon accused of killing his wife, 
stepson, and maid.  Like the Robert Rodriguez-Quentin
Tarantino film "From Dusk Till Dawn," the picture heads into
off-the-wall occultism at that point, giving way to excesses
which both debase its intelligently cynical tone and threatens
to turn it into juvenalia.  Mary Ann begins to see monsters. 
First, the face of her neighbor Jackie (Tamara Tunie) turns
momentarily hideous. Later the kind and supportive Pam
(Debra Monk) appears equally macabre.  Considering that we
know pretty much from the start that the sharply-dressed,
sophisticated and witty John Milton is the Devil, it's a
disappointment to see the movie lose its urbane veneer and
give itself over to adolescent indulgence.</P>
<P>   This fault aside, "Devil's Advocate" remains an edge-of-the-
seat stew peppered with comic dialogue throughout.  Its
extravagant budget shows through Bruno Rubeo's production
design, particularly his concept of John Milton's office with its
opulent bas-relief, its telltale fireplace, and its outdoor patio
featuring a pool which seems to run right off the penthouse
roof.  James Newton Howard's soundtrack is devilishly eerie,
fashioned to be played at full theater volume, adding
considerable tension and even wit to the production.  What's
more it is blessed by actors with remarkable chemistry for one
another, highlighting a climactic face off between Reeves and
Pacino and an intensely emotional relationship between
Reeves and Charlize Theron.  Theron, the 5'9" South-African
born beauty, has her career-making role as a spirited party
girl who goes off the deep end when she moves from her
laid-back Florida surroundings to the fiendish Big Apple in a
movie which--however excessive at many points--provides
chic repartee, handsome design, and professional
performances. Rated R.  Running Time: 144 minutes.  (C)
