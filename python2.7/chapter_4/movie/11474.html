<P>     Everyone knows someone like Giles De'Ath:  stuffy, arrogant, set in 
his ways, and at war with anything that could in any way be associated 
with "progress."  Giles is a writer, but the product of his typewriter 
is the kind of scholarly stuff that is immediately put onto library 
stacks where it can gather dust until some graduate student needs 
another reference for his or her thesis.  His house looks like an 
immaculate museum – with no television, microwave, word processor, or 
other technological gadgets, only the electric lights betray that he's 
living in the twentieth century, not the nineteenth. </P>
<P>     This is the kind of role that could easily be turned into a flat 
stereotype, but John Hurt, in what is certainly his best performance in 
a decade and possibly the most impressive of his long and distinguished 
career, turns "erstwhile fogy" Giles into a three-dimensional human 
being.  Despite his tunnel vision, it's impossible not to like the man, 
especially after his entire being is transformed by that singular 
affliction to which no one is immune:  love.  And, as Giles discovers 
during the course of this amusing, warm-hearted motion picture, it's 
possible to find the object of one's affection in the most unusual 
places.</P>
<P>     Giles, who is a widower and a recluse, does not frequent the 
cinema, but when he learns that an E.M. Forster film is playing at the 
local theater, he screws up his courage and decides to go.  What he 
doesn't realize is that the movie house is showing two films:  the 
Forster adaptation and a teen exploitation flick called HOTPANTS COLLEGE 
II.  A nonplused Giles ends up sitting in a darkened room watching buff 
male and female bodies in various states of undress.  Just as Giles is 
about to leave, however, he notices Ronnie Bostock (Jason Priestley), 
and, suddenly, it's love at first sight.  Giles is enraptured, and the 
moment HOTPANTS COLLEGE II is over, he beings to scour stores for 
Bostock memorabilia, including teen magazines and video tapes.  (In 
order to watch those tapes, Giles must buy a VCR, but he initially 
doesn't realize that he needs a TV to use the VCR.)</P>
<P>     Eventually, not satisfied with being the world's foremost authority 
on Bostock, Giles boards a plane and travels to Long Island, where his 
idol's home is located.  Bostock is away when Giles arrives, but the 
wily Englishman manages to befriend Ronnie's supermodel girlfriend, 
Audrey (Fiona Loewi).  Eventually, the actor arrives home and, impressed 
with Giles' demeanor and intelligence, he begins to rely on the older 
man's advice.  But, while Giles' affection runs deep, Ronnie's feelings 
are less constant.</P>
<P>     LOVE AND DEATH ON LONG ISLAND is a comedy, and a very funny one at 
that.  In fact, for its first half, the film is nearly-perfect.  It 
suffers a fall-off once Giles reaches New York, and the ending, with its 
none-too-subtle homosexual overtones, is a little too overbearing for 
the lighthearted material that precedes it.  In his gently satirical 
approach to popular culture and movie stardom, writer/director Richard 
Kwietniowski, adapting from the novel by Gilbert Adair, is 100% on-
target.  In the process, he not only creates a truly likable and 
memorable character in Giles, but says a few things about the 
transforming power of love, even if it is unrequited.</P>
<P>     From start to finish, this is clearly Hurt's movie – he's in almost 
every frame.  It's a role that the veteran actor must have relished, 
because he makes Giles an unforgettable motion picture figure, and does 
so by means of dialogue delivery, body language, and ever-changing 
facial expressions.  Jason Priestley, cashing in on his BEVERLY HILLS 
90210 image, is surprisingly effective as the shallow Ronnie.  He is 
charismatic, and it's not hard to understand why Giles is attracted to 
Ronnie.  Meanwhile, solid support is provided by the appealing Fiona 
Loewi and the always-reliable Maury Chaykin.</P>
<P>     LOVE AND DEATH ON LONG ISLAND is many things wrapped into one: a 
social commentary (it tackles the thorny issue of film as pure art 
versus film as mindless entertainment), a buddy picture/love story 
(Ronnie and Giles have one of the most interesting relationships found 
anywhere on a movie screen these days), and a "fish out of water" tale 
(Victorian relic Giles forced into the modern world).  Yet, despite the 
many laughs LOVE AND DEATH offers, it never takes cheap shots.  It has a 
vibrant, beating heart – and that makes the comedy all the more 
worthwhile.</P>
