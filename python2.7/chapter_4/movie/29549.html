<P>Susan Granger's review of "GLITTER" (20th Century-Fox)</P>
<P>    There's less here than meets the eye. Or, put it this way, if you
thought Madonna was awful in "Shanghai Surprise," Mariah Carey's worse in this
reworking of "A Star is Born."  She plays Billie Frank who, despite being
abandoned by her singer/alcoholic mother (Valerie Pettiford), believes she's
destined for greatness because everyone tells her she is. "You've got this
amazing gift, and you gotta use it," her roommate says. "Your voice - it's
incredible," says another singer. "I ain't never met anyone like you," proclaims
Julian "Dice" Black (Max Beesley), the hot New York DJ who becomes her
Svengali-like producer/lover. Problem is: her signature song, "I Didn't Mean to
Turn You On" is wretched. And when she fumes out of filming her first music
video because the director wants to "exploit" her by having her wear a bikini,
the audience bursts into laughter. Exploit Mariah Carey, who chooses to wear as
little as the law will allow? Come on! Writer Kate Lanier's script is fatuous
and director Vondie Curtis-Hall doesn't have a clue how to handle the glitzy pop
diva and, as a result of their incompetence, whispery-voice'd Ms. Carey seems to
be embarrassed on-screen. She almost cringes when the camera comes in for a
close-up, pursing her lips and averting her glassy eyes. Talented British
musician Max Beesley appears equally inept, and as cinematographer Geoffrey
Simpson pans around the Manhattan skyline, there's an audible audience groan
when the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center come into view. Perhaps one of
the reasons Ms. Carey suffered her highly-publicized nervous breakdown this
summer is because she saw a preview of this clunker. On the Granger Movie Gauge
of 1 to 10, "Glitter" is a pathetic 1. Right now, it's tops on my list of the
Worst of 2001.</P>
