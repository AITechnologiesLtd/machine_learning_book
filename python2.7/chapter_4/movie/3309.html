<P>     A snow-covered battlefield littered with the dead.  Bodies stripped 
of armor and clothing, then tossed naked into mass graves.  Seemingly-
uninjured young men whose throats are uncovered to reveal mortal wounds.  
Unmoving horses dragged through the snow to join their fellows on an 
ever-growing pyre.  Frozen corpses stacked like firewood.  And one man, 
still breathing, mistakenly thrown into a pit along with countless 
numbers of his dead compatriots. </P>
<P>     This still-living man is Colonel Chabert (Gerard Depardieu), the 
hero of 1807's battle of Eylau between Napoleon and the Russians.  
However, due to injuries, Chabert is unable to declare himself, and is 
presumed dead.  His wife (Fanny Ardant) re-marries, becoming a countess, 
and takes Chabert's considerable fortune with her.  Ten years later, 
however, in a RETURN OF MARTIN GUERRE-like turn of events, the Colonel 
comes back to Paris with the intention of re-claiming his lost life.  
After finding a sympathetic lawyer (Fabrice Luchini), Chabert confronts 
his former wife, now the Countess Ferraud. </P>
<P>     One of the underlying questions in COLONEL CHABERT is whether it's 
possible to resurrect a life that no longer exists.  Just because Chabert 
presents himself in the flesh doesn't mean that the hero of Eylau has 
come home.  After ten years spent in poverty and near-madness, the 
Colonel has become aware of how little intrinsic value there is in money 
and material possessions.  It's unclear whether his primary motive in 
revealing himself is to regain what he lost or to exact revenge upon 
those he views to have taken it from him--most notably Countess 
Ferraud. </P>
<P>     COLONEL CHABERT is not a romance about two former lovers finding 
each other after a tragic ten-year separation.  Any real affection 
between the title character and his former wife has long since burned 
out.  Instead, this film is about how those two manipulate one another in 
vying for control of a fortune that each has a legitimate claim upon.   
Cupidity and backstabbing lie at the center of CHABERT, and there's 
enough legal and political maneuvering to satisfy any who enjoy those 
sorts of murky machinations. </P>
<P>     Wonderfully photographed and deliberately directed, COLONEL CHABERT 
progresses slowly (sometimes painfully so), often lingering on images 
rather than proceeding to the next scene.  There are times when this 
method of storytelling works exceptionally well, but others when the 
attention to detail causes the plot to grind to a halt.  Fortunately, 
however, novice director Yves Angelo is savvy enough never to lose his 
characters amidst all the cinemtographic splendor.  Finely-furnished 
houses and scenes of battlefield dead never upstage Depardieu, Ardant, or 
Luchini, all of whom give honest, entirely-believable performances. </P>
<P>     Depardieu says he was attracted to this film version of Honore de
Balzac's novel because he was fascinated by the opportunity to play in
this sort of tragedy.  And, ultimately, that's what COLONEL CHABERT
is--a tragedy.  The question that looms large throughout the movie is
not whether Chabert will regain his honor and fortune, but whether
there's enough of him left to appreciate it.  Death, after all, has
many faces, and just because the body goes on doesn't mean the
personality still exists.  This is what Depardieu conveys to the
audience, and why CHABERT possesses a level of subtlety beyond that of
most historical dramas.</P>
