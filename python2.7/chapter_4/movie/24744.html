<P>As I walked out of "The Virgin Suicides", confused, and depressed about my 
confusion, a fellow member of the audience, whose girlfriend had walked ahead 
to the bathroom, struck up a conversation with me.
    "A bit strange, that, wasn't it?" he began.
    "I didn't get it," I replied.
    "Don't think it went down well. Not sure what it was about."
    "No, me neither. I've read the book..."
    "Was that a lot different?"
    "Not exactly, but... it was more metaphorical... this, I just didn't get 
it."</P>
<P>And I really didn't. I was glad to see that my view was shared; I'd 
considered that maybe my knowledge of the source material was distracting me, 
but perhaps that wasn't the problem at all. "The Virgin Suicides" is haunting 
in its performances, and engaging in its parts, but is also unbelievably 
bewildering, and not in the way it intends to be.</P>
<P>The setting is suburban America, 1975. Cecilia Lisbon (Hanna Hall), a 13-year 
old daughter of a boring maths teacher (James Woods) and a strict homemaker 
(Kathleen Turner), kills herself by jumping from her bedroom window. There 
are four other siblings in the household: 14-year old Lux (Kirsten Dunst), 
15-year old Bonnie (Chelse Swain), 16-year old Mary (A.J. Cook) and 17-year 
old Therese (Leslie Hayman).</P>
<P>The neighbourhood lads are fascinated by these beautiful creatures, and a 
grown-up version of one of them narrates the movie, which depicts the year 
following Cecilia's death. The boys try to gauge the girls' emotions, mix 
with them, judge what's going on in their household. And when the event 
suggested by the title happens, it is they who discover the corpses. </P>
<P>As a novel by Jeffrey Eugenides, "The Virgin Suicides" was about men who had 
not been able to come to terms with growing up. The Lisbon sisters were 
simply emblems of an adolescent male illusion of perfection, and in wondering 
why they had ended their lives, the flustered, elegiac narrator was really 
trying to figure out what happened to childhood innocence.</P>
<P>At times, Sofia Coppola's film adaptation seems to be trying to recapture 
that sense of confusion, mystery and loss. The voice-over narration, 
beautifully delivered by Giovanni Ribisi, speaks of "having pieces of the 
puzzle, but not being able to put them together" and "arguing about it 
still". But the movie contradicts this by unfolding like a straight drama, 
and seeing the girls too clearly as real people. It spends more time in the 
Lisbon household than it does with the boys, even though it wants to keep the 
Lisbon girls a mystery, and see things from the boys' point of view.</P>
<P>I can't quite give the movie a negative review, because I do concur with the 
critical consensus that Coppola has made an impressive directorial debut. Her 
most famous previous work was as an actress in "The Godfather, Part III", 
where she wasn't terribly good. "The Virgin Suicides" reveals her control 
over other performers, and strong ability to evoke a sense of time and place. 
I just don't think it works as an enigmatic mood piece. It wants to wonder 
about events, and yet show them onscreen as well. What's going on?</P>
