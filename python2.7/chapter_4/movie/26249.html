<P>   I don't recall hearing the "n" word spoken in hostility by a
white guy in the past twenty years.  In fact according to some
sociologists, there are white teens and college people in
various sections of the country who seem to want to be black. 
They imitate clothing fashions and colloquial speech of young
African-Americans and, believe-it-or-not, statistics prove that
whites snap up hip-hop CD's in greater numbers than blacks. 
This is not to say that racism is dead in the U.S. but if you
introduce a kid of any race to "Remember the Titans," he
simply would not believe what he sees.  Opening in 1971,
Boaz Yakin's movie from a script by Gregory Allen Howard
based on true incidents (and produced, strangely enough, by
a now socially conscious Jerry Bruckheimer), hones in on the
outright animosity shown by some whites in an Alexandria,
Virginia school district when their school and most particularly
their coaching staff is ordered integrated by the school board. 
By the time school opens in September, the kids of both
races seemed to be heading to their classes peaceably
enough but the enraged parents, carrying picket signs
showing their opposition to forced busing, were the
troublemakers--not the youngsters.</P>
<P>   "Remember the Titans" deals with a situation that occurred
just months prior to the commencement of the school year
when Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) is brought up from
South Carolina, appointed as head coach to the football team
of T.C. William High School, thus knocking successful white
coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton) into a subordinate position. 
Along with Boone, a company of black students were being
integrated into this southern institution, so that at the
beginning of summer vacation, desegregation was being put
to the test.  Not only was the white team threatened by the
black football players against whom they would have to
compete to keep their varsity uniforms: they were furious that
Yoast, a candidate for the hall of fame, was downgraded by a
newcomer.  Boone, as determined as a Marine boot-camp
instructor to get his boys into shape, even to court perfection,
leads them on a bus trip to a camp in Gettysburg, PA where
he would customarily wake them up at three in the morning
and penalize anyone who fumbled the ball by making him run
a mile.</P>
<P>   Of course "Remember the Titans" is not about football,
because if it were, it could not possibly compete with just
about any pro game that creates football widows around the
country every Sunday during the season.  Like every other
sports picture, "Titans" uses sport as a metaphor for life, or at
least for mankind-in-miniature, in this case as a testing
ground for racial harmony.  While racial melees break out
from time to time among the boys from the team known as
the Titans, Boone is determined to meld the disparate
groups, even forcing them to room together and giving them
an assignment to ask each other about their families and
their lives.  </P>
<P>   "Remember the Titans" is one of those films that could
easily be dismissed as a generic feel-good crowd-pleaser, the
sort that inevitably ends with your team winning in the final
seconds of play and all members of the team--and by
extension the school--getting together in peace and harmony. 
Yet despite the swelling music that virtually forces tears to
our eyes and lumps to our throats, and notwithstanding at
least one pretentious speech made by the head coach to
compete with no less than the Gettysburg Address itself, the
movie is so well-acted, with Will Patton's performance in
particular so quietly engaging, that we have to give the
ensemble credit for turning in an enjoyable and heartwarming
film.  </P>
<P>   Sure, Yakin throws in the obligatory precocious kid to win
over the parents in the audience--in this case the amazing
nine-year-old daughter of Coach Yoast, Sheryl (Hayden
Panettiere) who knows more about football than any of the
men in the school.  And sure, we get the recycled pop tunes
and the particular individuals who acquire self-esteem such
as the overweight Lewis Lastik (Ethan Suplee)--who from the
start doesn't give a fig what his teammates' race might be but
heads right over and sits down to lunch with the black teens. 
But darned if this picture--shot in Georgia without a single
spectacular football play photographed with the intensity of an
ordinary televised Sunday game--doesn't thoroughly entertain
even while devoid of a single four-letter word.  </P>
<P>Rated PG.  Running time: 113 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
