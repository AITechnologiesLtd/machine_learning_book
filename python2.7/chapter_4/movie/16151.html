<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>Will Hunting (new star Matt Damon, from Francis Ford Coppola's "The
Rainmaker") is the epitome of all of our hopes and dreams. A genius, a
charismatic guy, smart and funny. He's also the worst things in today's
society. An orphan, a victim of abuse, out of control, angry, rebellious. He
can solve math equations in his sleep that have baffled the professional
community for years. He also is haunted by abusive foster-parent after
abusive foster-parent.</P>
<P>Combine him with MIT's most brilliant mathematician, a burn-out psychologist
(Robin Williams), a pre-med student (Minnie Driver), and three of the most
over-the-top street boy kids that you can imagine, and you have a poignant,
funny, and touching story to tell.
"Good Will Hunting" is one of those films that leaves you with a smile in
the midst of one of the most brilliant and saddest stories this year.
Between brilliantly written characters and a story that makes sense for
once, with people in it that you can form definite connections to, the
result becomes near perfect. It resides now in my mind and in my heart, and
also occupies the #3 spot for best movies of the year (#1 is LA
Confidential, #2 is As Good as it Gets).</P>
<P>The movie is powered by the best original screenplay (quote me on that one,
Golden Globe and Oscar) of the year: a profanity-laced, smart-talking script
devised by Massachusetts natives Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, not to mention
the razor-sharp direction of the brilliant Gus Van Sant (Drugstore Cowboys,
To Die For). With this they draw you into the world of Will Hunting as he
struggles with his past, present, and future.</P>
<P>The film has Will Hunting proving one of the most devious theorems that the
Math Department of MIT has ever devised, and, in consequence, this proof
becomes his Get out of Jail Free card. One a condition: That he seek
counseling. He tries to screw around with the first few shrinks until one
from the same side of the tracks comes along (played by Robin Williams).
This man has high hopes for Will Hunting, as does everyone, but truly has a
desire to help the lost soul. What follows is a search for himself that you
will never forget.</P>
