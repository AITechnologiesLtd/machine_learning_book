<PRE>The Insider (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>review</PRE>
<P>Smoking is bad for your health. Everybody knows it. But people still enjoy
it. And the tobacco companies are making big money. Worse, they even lie
about the fact that nicotine is addictive. So what if it's addictive? People
are still going to smoke it.</P>
<P>Too bad these tobacco companies keep on lying, and with their big bucks,
they can do whatever they want, create whatever lies they want. Jeffrey
Wigand (Russel Crowe) used to be a top executive at Brown & Williamson, the
third largest tobacco firm in the US. That was until he got fired by his
boss because of "poor communication skills". But from his time at B&W, he
knew a whole lot of information that could bring the tobacco business down.</P>
<P>So Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), producer of CBS' 60 minutes, is looking for
Wigand and he tries to make Wigand confess in front of national television
about all these tobacco firms lies. But in doing that isn't easy.</P>
<P>Wigand has to deal with his ex-office. They have the money, he doesn't. And
with money, you can do almost everything. On top of that, he has to deal
with his wife, who can't support him, and keeps on whining about the money.
What a rollercoaster ride for Wigand, and Bergman can't keep up.</P>
<P>It's a fantastic investigative movie, based on a true story and true facts.
Although the movie exaggarated some facts, but at least they admitted it at
the end of the movie. No wonder that this movie is nominated for Best Film
at the Oscar. You can really feel the struggle that Wigand and Bergman have
to make during the whole process of being a whistle blower.</P>
<P>Russel Crowe's performance is outstanding, and he did just fine playing
alongside Al Pacino. Whenever Al Pacino is in a role that requires screaming
and confronting somebody, than he is the man.</P>
<P>Michael Mann is getting better. He made the bad guy the good one in Heat,
and he made everybody dressing up like Don Johnson during the Miami Vice
days. Here he put suspense from telephone conversations, not with fights and
gun shots all over the place.</P>
<PRE>Go see this movie if you haven't.</PRE>
