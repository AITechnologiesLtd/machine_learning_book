<PRE>SAVING SILVERMAN
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>SAVING SILVERMAN, by Dennis Dugan, the director of BIG DADDY, has a 
poster with a giant-sized thumbs down.  Consider it a giant-sized omen, 
for this movie has more stale leftovers than a refrigerator two weeks 
after Christmas.  There isn't a fresh joke to be found anywhere in the 
script.  </P>
<P>Your reaction watching the movie's grown-up teenagers is more likely to 
be yawns than laughs.  No matter how many times the characters fall down 
-- I think the count runs into the hundreds -- it is never funny, not 
even once.  When people aren't falling down, they do other "original" 
stuff like having food fights and making jokes about farts and 
masturbation.   </P>
<P>The story concerns a guy, Darren Silverman (Jason Biggs), who is 
perpetually unlucky in love, and a woman, Judith (Amanda Peet), who has 
him under her thumb, hence the intended meaning of the movie's poster.  
Biggs, of course, is the actor who was once lucky to have an infamous 
rendezvous with a pie, which catapulted him into undeserved fame.  
Peet's claim to fame is her body and her sassy attitude.  Neither of the 
two leads are the least bit good in SAVING SILVERMAN.  This might be 
expected, but the awful performances by Steve Zahn and Jack Black, as 
Darren's buddies Wayne and J.D., are a surprise.  Both have previously 
been brilliantly on the comedic mark, Zahn in HAPPY, TEXAS and Black in 
HIGH FIDELITY.</P>
<P>Judith calls Wayne and J.D. "pigs," and truer words were never spoken.  
The script, by Hank Nelken and Greg DePauls, revolves around Wayne and 
J.D. trying to get their buddy Darren back from Judith's clutches.  This 
scheme eventually involves kidnapping Judith, while trying to reinterest 
Darren in his old flame, Sandy (Amanda Detmer).</P>
<P>The movie, which is crude without ever being funny, features such 
gross-out gags as a butt implant scene.  There's also an attacking 
raccoon and a high school football coach (R. Lee Ermey) who literally 
kills a referee for making a bad call.  Stop me when you've finished 
laughing.</P>
<P>To be fair, there are two mildly diverting parts to the picture.  Amanda 
Peet's slit-down-the-middle, revealing blouses do add an undeniable eye 
candy factor to the film.  And Neil Diamond, whom the three guys 
worship, shows up for an extended cameo.</P>
<P>As soon as Judith first lays her eyes on Darren's buddies, she burns 
rubber with her car's tires, getting away from the guys as fast as she 
can.  Watching the movie produces a similar desire.</P>
<P>SAVING SILVERMAN runs 1:31.  It is rated PG-13 for crude sexual humor, 
language and thematic material and would be acceptable for teenagers.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, almost 12, gave the movie * as well.  He complained that 
it was utterly predictable and that he didn't laugh once.  He said the 
characters were all dumb and stupid but not the least bit funny.</P>
