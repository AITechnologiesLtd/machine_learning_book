<P>A quick poll about what the opposite of sex is produced the following
replies: "That's a dumb question" (3); "Excessive food" (1); " A PG rating
(1); "Running out of Viagra" (1); "No sex" (10), "Celibacy" (1).</P>
<P>The film opens with a small bang. Dedee's stepfather is being buried. He
may or may not have abused her as she later declares, but then Dedee has a
lot of imagination. A teen nymphette-rebel-with-probable-cause, she paces
around the graveside, smoking, and practically kicking the coffin into the
hole. This must mean that she didn't like the man. She clearly does not
like her life, her mother and perhaps herself. A troubled girl.</P>
<P>Post-burial she runs away --to what looks like a small Indiana town but is
a suburb of South Bend--, to stay with her long-time-no-see much older
half-brother Bill. He is a dedicated schoolteacher and seems to be a nice
sort. His lover Tom had died of AIDS and left Bill plenty of money and an
upscale house. He also seems to have inherited the late Tom's sister Lucia.
Rather nervous, insecure, sexually repressed,  and apparently Bill's best
friend, she's a protector of sorts who hovers around the man. Bill's
current lover is a handsome, likable, twenty-something Mattt. Neither man
evinces any gay mannerisms.</P>
<P>Dedee is 16, going at the same time on 30 and on 12. Like the combination
brat, tramp and "agent provocateur" that she is, she sets out to take out
her dysfunctionality on the Indiana Three. She thinks  highly of herself as
a philosopher-sociologist-shrink,  and talks a lot, a big lot. In spasmodic
ways, she also narrates the film. It's an old device but used here with
much originality. Dedee comments  to the audience about everything, acts
like the eye of God, like someone who has already seen the finished movie
The Opposite Sex, can tell us about it and about herself, pass judgments,
tell us what we are expecting but won't get, tell us what she's going to
tell us.</P>
<P>Dedee is a very fast talker. Her language is foul and trashy. She seems to
be savoring all her filthy words, rolling them around her mouth and putting
them in capitals. That kid is a mix of precocious wisdom and infantilism,
lies and truths, skepticism and cynicism, particles of sophistication and
big chunks of false sophistication.</P>
<P>She can be, and mostly is, unbearably irritating, but then that's part of
the script's strategy. Her foul language would disqualify her from being a
snake oil saleswoman, but she gets other  kinds of results. The first major
thing she does in Indiana is to come on blatantly to Matt, verbally and
physically (but the audience is shown no nudity). In a flash she convinces
Matt that he is, or can be a heterosexual, that in his affair with Bill
"you are basically [verb deleted] your father." She seduces him pronto. The
new couple takes off for California, and takes along ten thousand dollars
stolen from Bill as well as the precious urn in which he kept Tom's ashes.
Her seduction agenda. we learn later, is caused by Dedee's being pregnant
by, most likely, one of her Louisiana lovers, teen-ager Randy, famous for
having only one testicle.</P>
<P>This is just the beginning. If you want to pigeonhole the movie, is a sort
of black comedy/farce. Outrageous complications follow in all directions,
include flashbacks, home movies, everything and everybody.</P>
<P>There's local  sheriff Carl played by the bizarre, improbable Lyle Lovett.
He is a widower and sweet on Lucia. When the latter reproaches him "Your
wife was dying and you [verb deleted] her nurse," Carl missing no beat
replies "If Nancy didn't mind..." Bill gets blackmailed, then falsely
defamed by his former student Jason. The town is most receptive to anti-gay
feelings. and a scandal follows in the local media.</P>
<P>Bill and Lucia set out after Dedee-Matt who become Dedee-Randy when the
latter materializes from the sticks of Louisiana. Carl follows Bill and
Lucia. Add to this fights, guns firing, a motorcycle purchase, other
madnesses and non sequiturs. Add to that an incredible trip to Canada as,
by car, somehow (but how?) A follows B who follows C who has gone there
with D, and where E magically pops up, and where the entire cast is
reunited in a cabin in the woods!</P>
<P>The script  overdoes its wish to be topical, current and trendy. Trying too
hard to be original, it overloads the plot, overkills its gimmicks,
characters, absurdism. Admittedly, there are moments of comedy and farce,
but too many of them get drowned in much humor that thinks it is humor but
is not. Instead of Marx Brothers crazy-funny absurdism, we get
crazy-showy, uncensored absurdism, at full throttle. The would-be
avant-garde continuity, including time and space, is a mess.</P>
<P>Is the film worth seeing? Yes, for specialized audiences that are into the
off-beat. It 's an experiment whose originality is interesting, even if it
is too smug, self-conscious, frenetic and patchy. Screenwriter and now
first-time director Don Roos must know the tricks of Pirandello, Brecht and
the French New Wave, but has gone overboard. And we  still don't know what
the opposite of sex is.</P>
