<PRE>THE OTHER SISTER
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>It is apparent that the makers of The Other Sister intended their film
to be a thoughtful comedy-drama exploring the subjects of love and
mental retardation. But, the film's depiction of mental retardation
never rises above a simple gimmick. The end result is slightly
condescending to the audience (and its characters), and robs the film
from any hope of its intended dramatic impact.  However, The Other
Sister is still able to skate by (barely) on the merits of its comedy.</P>
<P>The main character of The Other Sister is Carla Tate (Juliette Lewis), a
mentally retarded teen who has just returned home from an institution.
Her rich parents, Elizabeth (Diane Keaton) and Radley (Tom Skerritt),
don't quite know what to do with her.  Carla's goal is to get a high
school diploma and become a veterinarian's assistant. Elizabeth thinks
that's out of the question.</P>
<P>But Carla is determined to declare her independence, whether her parents
approve or not. Soon, she's enrolled in the local PolyTechnic school,
and hunting for an apartment of her own.</P>
<P>The final test of her parents' patience comes when she meets Danny
(Giovanni Ribisi), a classmate of hers who is also mentally retarded.
The two form a quick friendship, and fall in love.  But when the topics
of sex and marriage are raised, Carla's parents are at a complete loss.</P>
<P>Juliette Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi apparently attended the same acting
class on the subject of portraying the mentally handicapped. They both
deliver the same affectations, and an overabundance of mannerisms that
bely a true lack of confidence in their characterizations. They are
never able to get lost in the characters; in each and every scene, you
are always acutely aware that you're watching someone acting.</P>
<P>The script provides them plenty of crutches to work with: She has a
childlike affinity for animals, and he has a childlike affinity for
marching bands.  She throws a childlike tantrum when people laugh at
her, he throws a childlike tantrum when he is called "stupid".  But
these lovable quirks are the end-all and be-all of their characters.
And it doesn't end with Carla and Danny...every single character in the
film can be singularly identified by a defining quirk.</P>
<P>The Other Sister has its cute moments, several of which actually do
work. However, the majority of the movie is elaborately over-staged. The
film is perfectly willing to sacrifice believability for a quick laugh.</P>
<P>The movie is also surprisingly long.  It clocks in at over two hours, an
excessive amount of time for what is in actuality a simple romantic
comedy.</P>
<P>The Other Sister is much too self-conscious to pack any dramatic weight.
But, as a lightweight, throwaway romantic comedy it's harmlessly
entertaining.</P>
