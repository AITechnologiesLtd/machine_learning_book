<P>It is not very seldom that films try to imitate Hitchcock. He is after
all, one of the twentieth century's greatest motion picture directors,
perhaps even the greatest. But, however, it is far too seldom that a
film or a director pays homage to Hitchcock without fake tenure.</P>
<P>Brian De Palma didn't make a poor man's thriller when he co-wrote and
directed Dressed To Kill. Instead, he made a blood-chilling, nail-biting
thrill ride that would make Hitch aficionados proud.</P>
<P>Angie Dickinson stars as a New York woman who is trapped (so she feels)
in a boring, dead-end marriage with a boring sex life. We find all of
this information out from her frequent visits to a local psychiatrist
(Michael Caine). She lusts for a change, and gets one in a mystery man
she meets in an art museum. Not a word is spoken between the two, nor is
anything implied during this scene, but De Palam wisely let the camera
so its job and made an eerie but effective scene.</P>
<P>Soon after that fateful encounter, the two sleep together. A little
later, Dickinson turns up murdered, and a high-priced call girl(Nancy
Allen), a witness to the murder, is hounded by a sleazy police officer
(Dennis Franz) and the killer. Dickinson's teenage whiz kid son (Keith
Gordon) also manages to help Allen out, and even winds up saving her
life in a chillingly terrifying scene that is very Hitchcock.</P>
<P>TO reveal any more would ruin the film. De Palma isn;t as good as
Hitchcock, nor will he ever be. No one ever will. but this taut,
suspenseful film full of shocking moments of originality and surprising
plot twists (although the ending is predictable), is a worthy attempt
and a beautiful tribute to the master of suspense.</P>
