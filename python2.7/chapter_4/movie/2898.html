<PRE>                              LITTLE DORRIT
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<PRE>     Has anyone else seen this wonderful film?</PRE>
<PRE>     The story is divided in two parts, each of about three hours.</PRE>
<P>     Part One is entitled NOBODY'S FAULT, referring to the general
feeling among the rich in Dickens' day that no one was to blame for the
miserable conditions that existed among the less fortunate.  Everyone,
it appears, passed the buck, while child labor, homelessness, illness,
and hunger engulfed the country.  Bureaucracy was rife.  One could
spend forever trying to get a patent, shuffling from one bureaucrat to
another.  But it's nobody's fault.</P>
<P>     The cast reads like a who's who of England's finest actors, with
Alec Guinness superb as the ex-wealthy patriarch of his family as he
keeps up his standards while in debtors' prison.  Derek Jacobi is
equally wonderful as the man who tries to help Little Dorrit by getting
her brother and father out of the prison, the same debtors prison where
she was born and lived for 20 years.   Little Dorrit, as an adult, is
played by Sarah Pickering.</P>
<P>     Part Two, entitled LITTLE DORRIT'S STORY, covers her birth in
prison, the death of her mother, how she learns to read and write and
sew and cook and take care of her "royal" father.  At times it covers
parts of what we have seen in NOBODY'S FAULT but here it is shown from
her perspective.</P>
<P>     George Bernard Shaw claimed Dickens' story was more seditious than
DAS KAPITAL because of what it revealed of society.  Although the film
showed the poverty and showed people sleeping under wagons in the
street, it did not dwell on it.  On the other hand it showed that there
were kind and generous people in debtors prison who would spend their
entire lives there unless some miracle caused their debts to be paid.</P>
<P>     Throughout the six hours, Christine Edzard's adaptation for the
screen, and direction, never falters; the interest and excitement are
sustained.  The acting is flawless, with many Dickensian characters
peppered along the way.  In addition, the sets and costumes, as well as
the extras employed as background, are wonderfully authentic.  This
belongs on a list of best films ever made.</P>
<PRE>4 big bytes.
4 Bytes = Absolutely must see.
3 Bytes = Too good to be missed.
2 Bytes = So so.
1 Byte  = Save your money.</PRE>
