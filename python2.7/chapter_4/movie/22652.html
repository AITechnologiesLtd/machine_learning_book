Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.</P>
<P>     It's time now for another chapter from Scott's Book of Cinematic Pet
Peeves. Our subject today is something I refer to as Characterization Via
Accusation. It's that annoying thing some films do in which characters'
psychological back-story is revealed not through the actions of those
characters, but through the things other characters say about them in the
middle of dramatic confrontations. It's the kind of lazy writing that can
wound even a film like AMERICAN BEAUTY, as when Ricky Fitts tells Angela
"you're ugly and you're boring ... and you know it." Film is a medium of
showing, not telling. A script full of probing psychoanalytical dialogue
is a script unable --or unwilling -- to show viewers what the characters
are all about.</P>
<P>     Susanna Kaysen's memoir GIRL, INTERRUPTED found the writer exploring
her 18 month experience in a psychiatric hospital with a journalistic
distance, as though she were describing the experience of another person. 
That's a restraint James Mangold's adaptation could have used a lot more
of. The film version shows us Susanna (Winona Ryder) as she is evaluated
after a possible suicide attempt as an 18-year-old in 1968. Susanna
eventually commits herself voluntarily to Claymoore Psychiatric Hospital,
where she finds herself in the company of some uniquely troubled young
women. Her roommate Georgina (Clea DuVall) is a pathological liar; Daisy
(Brittany Murphy) will only eat her father's deli chicken. And Lisa
(Angelina Jolie) ... well, Lisa's just a good old-fashioned sociopath. 
Through her experience, Susanna begins to question who she is, and how
easy it can be to be defined by others -- or even by yourself -- as crazy.</P>
<P>     The question of whether or not Susanna ever belonged at Claymoore was
central to the book, in chapters exploring how quickly she was diagnosed
with the vaguely-defined condition of "borderline personality disorder." 
Mangold takes the subject just a bit farther, flashing back to Susanna's
life as a morose, directionless teenager in an upper class family. The
time period itself plays a role as well, especially when symptoms of her
condition like "rebelliousness" and "sexual promiscuity" were symptoms for
a majority of her peer group in the late 1960s. GIRL, INTERRUPTED becomes
something of a coming-of-age story in which Susanna begins to realize that
her own "insanity" is an affectation compared to the much more profound
problems of her Claymoore cohort. As one nurse (Whoopi Goldberg) tells
her, her psychiatric problem may simply be that she's a "lazy,
self-indulgent little girl."</P>
<P>     The problem is that the nurse has to tell her -- and, by extension,
us. That's also only one of half a dozen or so scenes in which characters
begin dissecting the others by revealing their deep, dark secrets. Lisa
taunts Daisy about her relationship with her father; Susanna screams at
Lisa about her own problems; a psychiatrist (Vanessa Redgrave) tells
Susanna about why she uses the word "ambivalent." GIRL, INTERRUPTED
becomes a film all about cathartic movie moments, including a
happy-go-lucky, CUCKOO'S NEST-like outing and a chase through tunnels
beneath the hospital (a chase through tunnels?!?). Whatever points Kaysen
and Mangold might have been trying to make about the fine line between
sanity and insanity -- or about how those lines may be defined differently
for women -- are lost in tearful breakdowns and manufactured drama.</P>
<P>     It would be remiss of me not to mention Angelina Jolie's performance
as Lisa, the wild child who serves as the ward's alpha female. It would be
remiss not because Jolie's performance is exceptional -- showy, flashy and
fun, perhaps, though not exceptional -- but because it's a movie
performance of a real-life character. Everything in GIRL, INTERRUPTED
seems designed to be satisfying as entertainment, not to be true to
Susanna Kaysen's life or her unique perspective on that life. It's a movie
that feels always and forever like a movie. That means punch lines and
crescendos; it means Winona Ryder shouting a story better told in quieter
tones; it means one of the worst false beards in film history on Jared
Leto as Susanna's boyfriend. And it means everyone telling everyone else
how crazy they are or aren't, every character's story an open book ... or,
in this case, an open script.</P>
