<PRE>BANDITS
-------</PRE>
<P>Impulsive man of action Joe Blake (Bruce Willis) and brainy hypochondriac
buddy Terry Collins (Billy Bob Thornton) are escaped convicts who cook up
a unique bank robbing scheme in their pursuit of a Mexican retirement -
they take bank managers hostage in their homes, stay the night, and rob the
bank first thing in the a.m., before the bank opens for business.  After
Terry is hit by bored, somewhat crazed housewife Kate (Cate Blanchett), he
has her drive him to their hideout, and refusing to go home, she
stays making the duo a trio of "Bandits."</P>
<P>Directing from a script by Harley Peyton ("Keys to Tulsa," TV's "Twin Peaks"),
veteran director Barry Levinson ("Diner") delivers a road movie that's
part "Robin Hood" and part "Jules et Jim."  This gentle comedy slowly builds
to a pleasing payoff.</P>
<P>Bookended by narration from Darren Head (Bobby Slayton, "Get Shorty"), the
host of the fictitious 'Criminals at Large' TV show, we see the late Terry and
Joe in their final bank standoff arguing about which one of them allowed
Kate to get them into this predicament.  Flashback to their humorous prison
breakout, where Terry and Joe's opposite qualities are immediately
established.</P>
<P>Joe recruits his cousin Harvey (Troy Garity, "Steal This Movie"), a none too
bright wannabe Hollywood stuntman, as their getaway driver and 'The Sleepover
Bandits' are born, quickly becoming folk heroes and a media sensation.  The
guys are able to avoid capture by donning hilarious disguises for their 
overnight heists.  When Kate enters the picture, coming from a deadend 
marriage, she sees the romance of their escapades.  She also falls first for
Joe, then Terry, deciding that together, they make the perfect man.</P>
<P>The threesome are also the perfect costars.  Willis spins an affectionate
sendup of the action roles that made him a megastar, and looks cool while
doing so with his becomingly scruffy ponytail.  Thornton is all ticks and
twitches and physical comedy, as neurotic as Woody Allen, but quieter and
more laid back.  His performance is the most mannered of the three. 
Blanchett,
stunningly flame haired here, is all wide eyed enthusiasm with a flair for
the dramatic displayed as she lip synchs to Bonnie Tyler and Tanita Tikaram.
She joins Cameron Diaz ("My Best Friend's Wedding") and Candice Bergen 
("Starting Over") in the hilariously awful screen singing club with her 
rendition of "Walk on By."</P>
<P>Also strong are Garity as the dopey but true blue driver.  His practicing
of special effects and stunt work provide some of the film's best visual
jokes.
In a small role as the gang's last sleepover victim, Peggy Miley ("A Little 
Princess") is a small, stout, senior firecracker of a bank manager.  Willis'
daughters Scout and Tallulah Belle are featured as the children of the
first hostage.</P>
<P>Peyton's script is full of amusing dialogue and situations.  When Terry and
Kate are forced to take the last room at a hotel called the Pink Flamingo,
which is overrun with a Mary Kay-like cosmetics convention, it at first seems
like a one-off Elvis impersonator joke, but Peyton inventively takes it one 
step further.  Production design (Victor Kempster, "Natural Born Killers")
and cinematography (Dante Spinotti, "L.A. Confidential") take full advantage
of the charming small towns of the Northwest coastal region.  Levinson's
direction keeps everything just right at left of center, although the film
could have flown higher with some tightening, particularly in its early
meanderings.  The film features a terrific soundtrack ranging from U2's
"Beautiful Day" to "Wildfire."</P>
<P>"Bandits" takes a while to find its groove, but once it does it'll steal
its way into your heart.</P>
