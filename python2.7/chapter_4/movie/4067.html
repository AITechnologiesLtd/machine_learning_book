<PRE>                               SHOWGIRLS
                       A film review by Ed Powell
                        Copyright 1995 Ed Powell</PRE>
<P>     For the 6 dollars I shelled out for this flick, I could have
stayed home and bought a night of the "Spice" channel ... and gotten as
much plot and more vivid images of female bodies and sex.  This film is
proof that it is hype, not plot and story, that really sells a film.
(Sad, isn't it?)</P>
<P>     The film revolves around a sexy young woman named Nomi (Elizabeth
Berkley) who hitchhikes to Las Vegas, to seek a career as a dancer.  I
cannot really describe the plot, because there really isn't much of
one.  The film wandered aimlessly around for two hours, trying to
interweave several weak story lines into one central plot.  It starts
nowhere ... ends nowhere ... and fills the in-between with plenty of
jiggling breasts.</P>
<P>     While all involved played their parts adequately ... there was
something that didn't let me believe their parts.  This may be in part
to the writing of the film:  I cannot believe that Las Vegas, or
anywhere in the world, for that matter, is *that* sleazy.  Then again,
I live in a safe little suburb on the East coast....</P>
<P>     Since most of the film is apparently shot in Las Vegas, the
design of the film was filled with plenty of neon and tasteful glitz
(?).  In fact, the stage shows were incredibly well done ... I wouldn't
be all surprised if they were actual shows being shown in Las Vegas
right now.</P>
<P>     The director should be given another chance at directing a
feature film.  The film wasn't too fancy with the shot setups, but some
of them were obviously ill-planned.  If you go to see this film, be
prepared for some badly framed shots (but you'll never have to yell
"Focus!").</P>
<P>     If you are looking for an evening of sitting in a movie house
watching various parts of the female anatomy wobbling, this is for
you.  Otherwise, just stay home and rent the "Spice" channel.  This is
not a film where you will find higher forms of entertainment.</P>
<P>* Note:  I cannot judge this film on effects or family value.
There were no noticeable effects, and scoring on family value just
wouldn't be fair ... it is an NC-17 film, after all.</P>
<PRE>An United Artists release.</PRE>
