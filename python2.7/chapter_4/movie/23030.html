<P>         If you took five different jigsaw puzzles, threw the pieces
together on a table top and spent two hours trying to make a cohesive
picture out of the various bits, you might end up with something along
the lines of "Eye of the Beholder." Made in 1998, this maddening mess
features a pre-"Double Jeopardy" Ashley Judd and a pre-"Phantom Menace"
Ewan McGregor alongside a peroxide-dipped Jason Priestley, an
unflatteringly photographed Genevieve Bujold and, for reasons known only
to her agent and God, songstress k.d. lang. All concerned have seen
better days -- and been in much better movies -- than this one.</P>
<P> McGregor plays Stephen Wilson, a.k.a. "The Eye," a surveillance
expert who bolts from his job at the British Consulate to follow mystery
woman Joanna Eris (Judd) all over North America. Ostensibly a wig-maker
(and she does seem to have enough fake hairpieces at hand to shame even
Cher), Joanna is also deeply disturbed and has a habit of slaying every
man who tries to get close to her.</P>
<P> For most guys, this would not be a turn-on, but Stephen is
prodded into pursuing Joanna by visions of his long-lost daughter, who
tells him Joanna is really "just a little girl." A little girl who likes
to blindfold her lovers shortly before she stabs them to death perhaps,
but a little girl nevertheless. Aside from having been abandoned by her
own daddy one memorably miserable Christmas night, Joanna also received
counseling from a probation officer (Bujold) who may or may not have
helped to make her what she is today.</P>
<P> In its first half-hour, "Eye" is baffling but weirdly absorbing
as well. The rest of the film, however, is just plain weird, jumping
from Pittsburgh to San Francisco to Chicago to "The Cafe at the End of
the World," a flapjack shack located somewhere on the Alaskan tundra,
where Joanna becomes the world's least-likely waitress and Stephen her
most devoted customer.</P>
<P> How Stephen and Joanna have the money for all this traveling
and where Joanna comes up with all the disposable disguises she sports
are questions left unanswered. This is not a story in which logic ever
intrudes on the action. As in a dream, things seem to happen simply
because the characters want them to happen. Or perhaps, given Joanna's
obsession with astrology, because it was written in the stars.</P>
<P> Director Stephan Elliott labors long and hard to make this
nonsense look as slick as possible and manages to come up with a handful
of effective scenes, such as a split-screen image of Joanna in a bubble
bath and Stephen looking longingly at the wall that separates him from
her. But after nearly two hours of voyeurism, ghosts, sight-seeing and
chases, untidily wrapped with an extremely abrupt finale, "Eye" is just
like that mass of scattered jigsaw puzzle pieces: There might possibly
be a picture there, but who wants to waste their time trying to put it
all together? James Sanford</P>
