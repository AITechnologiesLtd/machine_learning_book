<P>     The sophomore jinx strikes again!  In the last twelve months, this 
mysterious cinematic malady has afflicted a number of up-and-coming film 
makers, including Robert Rodriguez (DESPERADO), Kevin Smith (MALLRATS), 
and now Eric Schaeffer.  Schaeffer is one-half of the duo responsible 
for 1994's quirky, often-hilarious MY LIFE'S IN TURNAROUND.  Little of 
the zest and originality of that film is evident in IF LUCY FELL, which 
makes one wonder how much of TURNAROUND's inspiration came from 
Schaeffer, and how much came from his former partner, Donal Lardner 
Ward.</P>
<P>     Lucy (Sarah Jessica Parker) and Joe (Schaeffer) share a New York 
apartment.  Best friends since college, these two have developed a more 
intimate (albeit platonic) relationship than most lovers.  They also 
have a "death pact":  if they aren't involved in serious romances by the 
time Lucy turns 30, they will join hands and jump off the Brooklyn 
Bridge together.  Lucy's birthday is one month away, and both of them 
are alone, so they have some serious dating ahead of them.</P>
<P>     The object of Joe's obsession is Jane (Elle Macpherson), his 
beautiful next-door neighbor.  Joe has been watching her through his 
apartment window for years, but he's never been able to work up the 
courage to talk to her.  Now, through a series of carefully-orchestrated 
moves, he has placed himself in a situation where a conversation can't 
be avoided.  Meanwhile, Lucy has become intrigued by an offbeat painter 
named Bwick (Ben Stiller), who can best be described as a sweet-but-
eccentric idiot.</P>
<P>     IF LUCY FELL tries desperately to recapture the feel of WHEN HARRY 
MET SALLY, but, even during its better moments, it falls short.  Harry 
and Sally seemed like real people -- they connected with each other and 
the audience.  The same certainly can't be said about Lucy and Joe.  
These two are cardboard cut-outs, and the only thing we feel for them is 
apathy.</P>
<P>     For the most part, IF LUCY FELL is a disappointingly superficial 
romantic comedy.  There's no chemistry between any of the characters.  
The acting is mediocre, with Schaeffer and Parker exhibiting no screen 
presence.  The best performance (gasp!) is given by supermodel-turned-
actress Elle Macpherson, which says something about the work of her co-
stars.</P>
<P>     On those rare occasions when it has a chance to examine a 
potentially-interesting issue (such as the relationship between 
voyeurism, exhibitionism, and fantasy), IF LUCY FELL lets the 
opportunity pass.  The result is that this film, which wants to be 
smart, funny, and hip, succeeds instead in being mostly irritating.  And 
the far-too-predictable ending is both contrived and manipulative.</P>
<P>     After MY LIFE'S IN TURNAROUND, one could reasonably expect 
something more than this -- a Generation X picture that takes angst to 
absurd levels -- from Eric Schaeffer.  Unfortunately, what we are 
saddled with is a whiney, talky, stagnant movie that's more pretentious 
than romantic, and more dull than funny.  IF LUCY FELL trips early on, 
and keeps stumbling for most of its ninety-two minute running length.</P>
