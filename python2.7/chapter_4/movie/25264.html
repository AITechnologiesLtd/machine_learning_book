<P>   What do mayors of New York City, the Apple's yuppies,
and Gotham tourists from the world over have in common? 
Simple.  They rarely if ever go to the outer boroughs.  New
York City means Manhattan, and even then, only that island's
stretch from the Battery to Ninety-Sixth Street.  Everywhere
else is the boonies.  To paraphrase the old song, how ya
gonna keep them up in the Bronx, after they've seen Macy's?</P>
<P>   Can you blame them?  Yes, but only in part. After all, while
Staten Island may have a unique Tibetan museum, the Bronx
a nationally famous zoological garden and Brooklyn the
inimitable view of the skyline at the Heights promenade,
there's only place to go for Broadway shows, slick hotels,
clean streets and dazzling shops.  On the other hand, while
Manhattan may have its fascinating ethnic conclaves like
Chinatown, Little Italy and Little Spain, a visit to
neighborhoods in Queens will open tourists to the way real
people live, people who crunch motor engines but not
numbers and bars whose tenders know thankfully little about
white wine spritzers and five-dollar bottles of Perrier.  First-
time director, Dublin-born Myles Connell, takes us to such a
neighborhood with his character-driven movie about plain,
basically good, hard-working people in the little-known vicinity
of Sunnyside, Queens, one of whom has been twice driven to
crime because he's down on his luck and wants to do good
by his family.  "The Opportunists" is the diametrical opposite
of slick, commercial films portraying smooth and articulate
robbers who have no identity other than the schematics of
the plot.  Because the noirish feature, developed at the
Sundance Film Makers lab in 1995, has few ups and downs
but moves ahead slowly, deliberately, with an emphasis on
exploring the dimensions of its players, "The Opportunists" is
not for everyone but for those who can appreciate a sincere,
attentive, superbly cast film. This indie is a good example of
the delights that small movies have over the likes of "M:I-2"
and "Pulp Fiction."</P>
<P>   As Vic Kelly (Christopher Walken) tells us early on, he did
serve time for a botched bit of safecracking but gave back
the take not really because his generosity reduced his
sentence but because after his wife left him, "I had no one to
spend the money on."  In other words, Connell introduces us
to a real family man, the converse of your common mugger
whose family life runs the gamut from dysfunctional to non-
existent.  He lives with his 20-something daughter, Miriam
(Vera Farmiga) and enjoys the affection of Sally (Cyndi
Lauper), who runs the neighborhood bar, but when he meets
up with an uninvited guest who is allegedly a relative back in
Ireland (Michael Lawler played by the raffish Peter
McDonald), he sees a way of picking himself out of a
mountain of debt.</P>
<P>   While the actual safecracking gives us the movie's only
moments of traditional suspense, the real achievement of this
picture is Connell's carefully drawn portrayal of a group of
eccentric characters, people who will convince skeptics that
outer-borough folks of similar ethnic and working-class
background are not all alike.  Tom Noonan, who was so
wonderful in the thoroughly human drama of dating, "What
Happened Was..." virtually steals the show as a shady
locksmith, while Christopher Walken proves that he can be as
vulnerable and compassionate in his quirky role as he was
barbarous in "Sleepy Hollow."  Adding special texture are
Anne Pitoniak as Vic's crabby aunt and Peter McDonald as
the wide-eyed Dubliner whose fantasy about a great
safecracker proves both correct and inaccurate.</P>
