<PRE>                                  METRO
                       A film review by Paul Miller
                        Copyright 1997 Paul Miller</PRE>
<P>If you are anything like me, you have not read one good review for Eddie
Murphy's new movie METRO.  At least now this is no longer true.</P>
<P>Metro starts off in an interesting fashion.  Roper (Murphy) is a hostage
negotiator and has a case on his hands.  He asks for a dozen donuts (I
still don't know why) and proceeds to go to the crime scence.  </P>
<P>The plot stops here.  All I will say is that Roper has one heck of a
case on his hands.  He also must take on a new partner (the always great
Michael Rappaport) and train him the right and the wrong ways to
negotiate.</P>
<P>I can say, however, that this is an imaginative movie.  It incoporated
many different views into a whole, this movie.  This movie was good
because of the exact reason I did not like Murphy's BOOMERANG, that
reason being that it didn't stress the comedy.  In here it stressed
supsence and action.  The BEST thing about this movie is that it ALWAYS
leaves you guessing.  Do not think you know what will happen next,
because you don't.  Don't try either, you'll just end up being more
confused than you already are.</P>
<P>If you are an Eddie Murphy fan (such as I am) this may not be the best
movie for you to see.  This isn't the usual Eddie role because the
comedy isn't stressed.  One thing I can say is that Eddie does a good
job with the role.  I think someone else possibly could have played both
parts (Murphy's and Rappaport's) role slightly better, but I think that
would be a very difficult thing to do.</P>
<P>If you want a suspence filled two hours, go see Metro. If you want
classic Eddie Murphy, try renting the Distinquished Gentleman.</P>
