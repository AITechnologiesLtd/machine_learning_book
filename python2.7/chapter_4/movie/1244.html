<PRE>                             FRIED GREEN TOMATOES
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1992 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     FRIED GREEN TOMATOES is a film by Jon Avnet, from a novel by Fannie
Flagg.  The film stars Kathy Bates, Jessica Tandy, Mary-Louise Parker,
Mary Stuart Masterson, with a special appearance by Cicely Tyson.</P>
<P>     FRIED GREEN TOMATOES is more like STEEL MAGNOLIAS than THELMA AND
LOUISE in its setting, intentions, ensemble casting, and effect.  It is
a film about the friendships of women, specifically two women of the
film's now, Kathy Bates and Jessica Tandy, and two women of the film's
post-WW I then, Mary-Louise Parker and Mary Stuart Masterson.  It is
their friendships that allow these women to survive, and flourish in
their own ways, their times and their male-dominated worlds.  But unlike
THELMA & LOUISE, there nothing of the overt rebellion and the final
joyous-violent withdrawal.  These women, these Southern women, mean to
survive and persist, not rebel and die.</P>
<P>     In terms of its effect on this audience of one, FRIED GREEN
TOMATOES is not the radicalizing experience THELMA & LOUISE was last
spring.  FRIED GREEN TOMATOES is basically a comedy of manners that has
nothing new to say about women, the South, or anything else.  Its
message is hackneyed, but may be somewhat empowering to some, and
certainly uplifting for most.  This is a feel-good laugher-weeper.  But
it is not going to threaten men the way THELMA & LOUISE did, and does.</P>
<P>     Like STEEL MAGNOLIAS, the real strength of FRIED GREEN TOMATOES is
not the story, but the cast.  And the cast is wonderful.  Kathy Bates, a
ineffectual, class-going, 40-ish, overweight, unliberated, unsatisfied
Evelyn, thrashing about for ways to refire her nearly hopeless husband
and their moribund marriage, looks and comes across like a Bette Midler
without the hand-waving.  Her life is transformed as she get acquainted
with Jessica Tandy's nursing-home character Ninny Threadgoode and gets
drawn into her stories about Ruth (Mary Stuart Masterson) and her sister
Idgie, the unconventional and free-thinking, pants-wearing, permanent
tomboy.</P>
<P>     Evelyn's story is mostly comedy, whereas the stories of Ruth and
Idgie are high melodrama for the most part.  This creates a certain
dramaturgic schizophrenia, and undermines the importance of Evelyn's
story, relatively unexceptional as it is.  I'm assuming that Ninny is
Idgie's older sister, but the film annoyingly hints time and again that
she might be Idgie herself.  This is one of several vague points that
first-time director Avnet indulges himself in, to no good effect.</P>
<P>     Jessica Tandy is a national treasure and with each performance
becomes even better.  In DRIVING MISS DAISY, she gave a finely tuned
portrait of a Southern Jewish woman over a long and tumultuous period in
history; it is hard to imagine anyone surpassing that performance.  But
she may have done so as Ninny, the ancient rememberer of vanished times,
town, and people, who at first seems a little senile.  But we get to
understand her and love her at exactly the same pace that Evelyn does.
Ninny is an 81-year-old who is not afraid of death and who is still
fascinated by life and the dynamics of friendship.</P>
<P>     Mary-Louise Parker plays Ruth, the good, conventional, nurturing
woman whose life is saved by the friendship of Idgie.  Parker plays Ruth
with an admirable and delicate blend of strength and frailty.  There is
something Parker does with her upper lip and nostrils, something we saw
a little of in GRAND CANYON, that completely conveys pain and
willingness to survive the pain.</P>
<P>     Mary Stuart Masterson is Idgie, who manages to avoid mannish
caricatures even while being a woman who has rejected conventional
femininity.  It seemed pretty obvious to me that Idgie was a lesbian who
loved Ruth, but somehow in the movie Ruth never seems to catch on.  The
latter has occasion several time to suggest that Idgie will be happy
when she "settles down," even though Idgie tells Ruth "I'm as settled
down as I'm ever going to be."  About this and about the Idgie-Ruth
relationship in general, the film seems unnecessarily coy and vague.</P>
<P>     All in all, I think FRIED GREEN TOMATOES is pretty good flick.
It's manipulative and presses all the emotional buttons with a slightly
heavy touch.  It makes mandatory passes at all the Southern Themes --
racism, the Klan, decay, Southern men, the plight of the black people,
corruption, -- but they are strictly for the record and are not
particularly heartfelt.  The value of friendship, of women's
friendships, specifically, is heartfelt and sincere, the sure moral
center of the movie.  FRIED GREEN TOMATOES has its faults, but it does
some have excellences, too, the acting not being the least of them.</P>
<P>     Therefore, I recommend that you see FRIED GREEN TOMATOES at a
bargain matinee.  If it really clicks for you, you can take what you
save on the first ticket and apply it to the next.</P>
