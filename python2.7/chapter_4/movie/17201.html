<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
4 and a half stars</P>
<P>Towards the end of Pleasantville - one of the most life affirming films
you're likely to see - two characters paint on the side of a local
police station.  Their vibrantly colored portrait depicts classic novels
with wings attached to them, flying above a bonfire that was intended to
destroy them.  Like the film, this picture is a metaphor for cultural
progression.  When there are so many films nowadays that look at our
modern world in a negative light, here is one that displays advancement
as something positive.</P>
<P>Would the world be a better place if it were based in a cheesy 50's
sitcom, where dinner is always on the table, husbands and wives sleep in
different beds, and teenagers hold hands at lovers lane?  Welcome to
Pleasantville, a quaint town that is, literally, black and white.  Two
teenagers - David (Toby Maguire) and Jennifer (Reece Witherspoon) - get
magically transported from the dangerous 90's to the mellow world of
Pleasantville via the usage of a strange TV remote control.  "We're,
like, stuck in nerdville," Jennifer exclaims.</P>
<P>Naturally, the film takes time to cash in on some jokes.  The word
"fire" means nothing to the fire brigade; their idea of an emergency is
rescuing a cat from a tree.  The local basketball team has never missed
a shot, no one has ever heard of the word sex, and the school's library
books are full of blank pages.  Like in Dark City (and, to a lesser
extent, The Truman Show), the residents of Pleasantville see nothing
strange about the way they live - they have accepted the reality given
to them.  At one moment, Jennifer asks a teacher what is outside of
Pleasantville, just to hear "I don't understand" in response.</P>
<P>Before the jokes become tiresome, Pleasantville becomes darker in tone
during its second half.  As Toby and Jennifer (known in town as Bud and
Mary Sue) initiate change in the society, things begin to turn into
color.  Most adults are unwilling to adhere to these new elements,
except soda shop owner Mr. Johnson (Jeff Daniels, in one of his best
roles in years) who has a dream to paint, and Toby and Jennifer's TV
mother Betty (Joan Allen), a likeable woman who craves more excitement
in her life.  Pleasantville mayor Bob (the late J.T Walsh, in his last
film performance) is especially determined to maintain old traditions.
Although Pleasantville begins as a light-headed comedy, it ends up
examining important issues of prejudice, rebellion, change and honor.</P>
<P>That is quite a lot to cram into 116 minutes, but debut director Gary
Ross (writer of Big and Dave) does it with style.  As color contrasts
with black and white, Pleasantville becomes a visual sensation.  It may
be the screenplay (also by Ross) that provides the film with its wit,
humor and emotion, but the special effects certainly play a large part
in reaching out to viewers.  It's hard not to be entranced by the image
of a single red rose amongst a black and white screen, or
Pleasantville's first ever fire (luckily, David shows the firemen how to
put it out).  This burning tree is quite a sight.</P>
<P>Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon have enough charm and interest to
make the two titles roles really work.  Witherspoon's Jennifer is at
first a sex crazed and self absorbed rebellious teenager, but she
gradually matures into a more respectable person.  Witherspoon makes
that transformation believable, and so does Maguire as his character
discovers the thrill of taking risks.  Jeff Daniels has a soft and
placid part, but his character is meaningful and, at times, almost
poignant.  Mr. Johnson's love for painting is understandable, and the
condemnation of his work by some of the town residents seems tragic.
William H. Macy (who regularly plays small parts) rarely catches my eye
as an exceptional performer, but here he does.  Macy's character (David
and Jennifer's TV father) is the only reason why we can relate to the
people who don't want Pleasantville to change.  They are happy living
controlled and repetitive lives, where their surroundings remain dull
but peaceful.</P>
<P>Pleasantville is a truly original film that soars with energy and
beauty.  It has deep meaning and relevance in today's society, and
should serve as a reminder for most that the world is made up of how its
residents think and act.  "You can't stop something that's inside you,"
says David, and that could be a summation of all that Pleasantville
stands for.  I was touched and inspired by this film, and for all the
right reasons.  Although Ross occasionally directs with a little too
much simplicity (his use of symbolism is usually quite obvious),
Pleasantville never complicates or intimidates its audience.
Imaginative, moving and entertaining, this marvelous Hollywood product
should be a prime example of how special effects can be used to aid a
story, and not the other way around.  It would be silly for me to point
out that films like Pleasantville are seldom found - that much is
obvious.</P>
