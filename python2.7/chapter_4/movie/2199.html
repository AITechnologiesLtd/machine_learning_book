<PRE>                       THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1993 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Voices:  Danny Elfman, Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara, William
Hickey, Glenn Shaddix.
Screenplay:  Caroline Thompson.
Director:  Henry Selick.</P>
<P>     If JURASSIC PARK proved one thing, it was this:  image *is*
everything.  What the public seems to want most from movies is
spectacle; show them something they've never seen before, and they'll
beat a path to the theater door, even if the story is fairly
simplistic.  This news should come as a great comfort to Touchstone
Pictures and Tim Burton.  THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS is a
straightforward, somewhat bland fable which would have put me to sleep
if done with live action or traditional hand-drawn animation.  However,
its stop-motion figures and incredible production design are dazzling
enough to give NIGHTMARE a delightfully timeless quality which make it
far more entertaining than it could have been.</P>
<P>     THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS posits the existence of separate,
inhabited towns which hold dominion over the major holidays.  In
Halloween Town, the residents are celebrating the successful completion
of another October 31st, but Pumpkin King Jack Skellington (voice of
Chris Sarandon, sung by Danny Elfman) is not so happy.  Tired of
Halloween after Halloween just like every other, Jack longs for
something different to shake him out of his ennui.  He finds it when he
stumbles onto Christmas Town, and is enchanted by what he sees.  Jack
decides to have Santa kidnapped and stage his own Christmas, despite
warnings from lovelorn rag doll Sally (Catherine O'Hara) that it will
be a disaster.</P>
<P>     First, the good news:  NIGHTMARE is truly unlike anything you've
ever seen before.  The look combines old Rankin/Bass Christmas
specials, Edward Gorey illustrations and the Beatles' YELLOW SUBMARINE
to create a remarkably distinctive and detailed world.  The animation
is incredibly fluid, to the extent that I began to wonder whether a
couple of characters were real humans somehow edited into the film.
Cheers also to the marvelous character design, from spindly Jack to the
lecherous Dr. Finkelstein (William Hickey) to my favorite, the
literally two-faced Mayor (Glenn Shaddix).  It was the kind of film
where I never took my eyes off the screen because I was afraid of
missing something.  Director Henry Selick avoids the pitfall of
"showing off" his toys; he keeps the camera moving, telling the story
visually with style and effectiveness, particularly Jack's graveyard
song after his Christmas coup.</P>
<P>     The down side of this complex and expensive animation technique is
that the story had to be packed into under 75 minutes.  There is no
time for nuance of character or well-developed motivations; the
filmmakers slam through the plot at a breakneck pace, avoiding lags in
pace but also avoiding a truly engaging story.  The biggest loser is
the romantic subplot involving Sally's unrequited love for Jack,
resolved out of nowhere.  The villainous character of Oogie Boogie also
comes up a bit short, and a slightly grumpy Santa could have been very
interesting.  The story is a fairy tale, so I don't take issue with the
simplicity of the plot.  I was just disappointed with the apparent
decision to throw everything into the visuals.</P>
<P>     Perhaps most disappointing is the song score by frequent Tim
Burton collaborator Danny Elfman.  Taking an operatic approach,
NIGHTMARE is almost entirely through-sung, making the songs a crucial
element of the film.  But with the exception of the lively "What's
This?" during Jack's discovery of Christmas Town, the tunes are fairly
tedious and the lyrics lacking in wit.  They seemed designed simply to
move the story forward, not to inspire humability like the best
Ashman/Menken tunes from the recent Disney films.  It's surprising
given Elfman's playful Oingo Boingo oeuvre that his songs here are so
somber and uninspired.</P>
<P>     Some movies are called feasts for the senses.  THE NIGHTMARE
BEFORE CHRISTMAS qualifies as a feast for the sense, singular.  While
there is very little worth listening to in the film, there is more than
enough worth looking at to compensate, particularly for those with a
slightly twisted sense of humor.  NIGHTMARE is delightfully unique,
just not a dream come true.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 pumpkins:  7.</PRE>
