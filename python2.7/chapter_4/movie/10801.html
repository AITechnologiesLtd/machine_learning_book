<PRE>THE STENDHAL SYNDROME (1996)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Mike Watson
Copyright 1998 Mike Watson</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: 4 out of 5</PRE>
<P>Stendhal's Syndrome: a condition where, in the presence of art, a
person becomes engulfed in a painting and hallucinates and may
afterwards suffer symptoms such as depression, suicidal behaviour and
personality disorder.  </P>
<P>Grim stuff, to be sure, but the subject of a remarkable film from
Italy's master of the horror thriller Dario Argento.</P>
<P>Boasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the grandfather of film
music Ennio Morricone, THE STENDHAL SYNDROME is a quite magnificent
return to form for Argento.  It follows his disappointing American
debut TRAUMA (1992), the patchy OPERA (1987) and several mediocre
films he produced for young Italian director Michele Soavi in the late
1980's.  </P>
<P>Based on the novel by Graziella Magherini, the film stars Argento's
daughter Asia as young Roman police inspector Anna Manni in pursuit of
a brutal rapist-killer.  Visiting Florence to follow up several leads,
she is lured by the killer Alfredo (Thomas Kretschmann) to an art
gallery, a favourite haunt where he hopes to identify exactly who is
on his tail.  At the gallery Anna is overwhelmed by a painting and
faints.  Posing as a bystander, Alfredo briefly comes to her aid and
having now identified his pursuer, a strange game of cat and mouse
begins.</P>
<P>A gripping story evolves, and a coherent one, too, which may surprise
those familiar with Argento's often lumpy narratives.  THE STENDHAL
SYNDROME is not a simple cop-hunting-killer scenario.  It is a
disturbing and often compelling study of the central character's
psychological disintegration.  The script explores its psycho-sexual
themes with intelligence and candour, perhaps too much so for more
sensitive viewers.  But as dark as its themes are, THE STENDHAL
SYNDROME emerges as one of the most artful and effective European
thrillers of the last ten years.</P>
<P>Argento is once again working in his native Italy, and he fully
exploits the opportunities to use art and architecture for both
symbolic statements and as departure points for several brilliant
hallucinogenic sequences.  Effects whiz Sergio Stivaletti serves his
director well here, and the cinematography by Giuseppe Rotunno is
consistently excellent.  The film's opening 20 minutes segues between
hallucination, flashback and real-time with tremendous style.  Proof
that, at his most inspired, Argento remains one of the world's most
exhilarating filmmakers.</P>
<P>The cast is generally good, though marred at times by dubbing into
English that renders speech all but emotionless.  Asia Argento's
performance is by turns risky, awkward and fascinating.  It's a
difficult role, and given her relative inexperience on screen she
deserves applause for her efforts.  Thomas Kretschmann is chillingly
effective as Alfredo, and Marco Leonardi (of CINEMA PARADISO, and
possibly the most gorgeous looking man in Italy) does okay as Anna's
work colleague and increasingly confused love interest.</P>
<P>But perhaps THE STENDHAL SYNDROME'S single most striking element is
Ennio Morricone's soundtrack.  Active since the 1960's, Morricone has
scored over 100 films in his career and this must rate as one of his
finest efforts.  It's mostly a variation on the one theme: a slow
circular melody for strings and wordless female vocal possessed with
an extraordinary, haunting beauty that lingers long afterwards.  It's
been three decades since Argento and Morricone worked together.  This
is a long welcome reunion.</P>
<P>If the film has a fault, it is that the last half hour drags a little
and the film doesn't quite reach a completely satisfying climax.  But
by the closing scenes, THE STENDHAL SYNDROME has already offered us
enough to qualify as one of the very best films of Dario Argento's
career.</P>
<P>*NOTE: See the uncut print from Japanese laserdisc if you can.  Dubs
of this version are available from various video dealers on the World
Wide Web.</P>
