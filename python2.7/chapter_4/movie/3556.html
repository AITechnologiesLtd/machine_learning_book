<PRE>                             CITY SLICKERS II
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1995 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>     In the continuing saga of Hollywood trying to recycle old hits (it
worked with the Godfather trilogy didn't it - they made zillions from
them), we now have CITY SLICKERS II, subtitled THE LEGEND OF CURLEY'S
GOLD.  Rather than a cattle drive, this time we have Crystal coping
with another mid-life crisis (the big four-oh) by searching for buried
treasure.</P>
<P>     Almost all of the actors (Billy Crystal, Daniel Stern, Jack
Palance, and Patricia Wettig) are back, but we have a different
director (Paul Weiland rather than Ron Underwood), and it shows.  He
has Crystal playing it too reserved.  I would have preferred any of
Crystal's 10 minute Academy Award opening monologues for this movie.</P>
<P>     Yes, there are funny scenes.  The ongoing joke about the
possibility of being bitten on the rear by a rattlesnake is the best.
Between the funny scenes is a fair amount of boredom.</P>
<P>     The worst part of the show is Crystal's kid brother played by Jon
Lovitz.  Most scenes with him in them are close to unwatchable.
Patricia Wettig (whom I LOVED in "thirtysomething") is wasted here as
she was in the original for that matter.  Wish some producer would
"discover" her.</P>
<P>     Don't get me wrong, I did laugh many times, but they dragged the
story out too much.  It was 1:56 long, but there was not enough
material here for even an hour and a half.  The same writers as in CITY
SLICKERS, Billy Crystal, Lowell Ganz, and Babaloo Mandel, devised a
clever plot, but the script itself, although it had a great ending, was
slow going.  CITY SLICKERS II is similar in quality to the other
retread on the market now, BEVERLY HILLS COP 3, but BHC 3 has bigger
laughs yet with even more boring parts in between.</P>
<P>     CITY SLICKERS II gets * 1/2 from me, and I suggest you pass it by.
It is rated PG-13 and would be fine for teenagers if they have to see
it.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
