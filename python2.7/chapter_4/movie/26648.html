<PRE>O Brother, Where Art Thou?
A film review by Pete Croatto

<P>Maverick movie directors eventually become domesticated. Don't believe
me? The same guy who directed The Conversation also directed Jack.  The
man behind The French Connection helmed Blue Chips.</P>
<P>        Whether it's through common sense, clean living, or skill, Joel and
Ethan Coen have avoided a creative snag.  After some 20 years, their
movies are still original, intelligent. and funny without being aloof. 
Their latest effort, O Brother, Where Art Thou?, is no exception.  Based
on Homer's epic, The Odyssey, and set in Depression-era Mississippi, the
brothers have done the unthinkable: They've taken classic literature and
made it fun.</P>
<P>        The tale, which includes references to the poem throughout, has three
escaped convicts (George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Evans)
overcoming various obstacles in retrieving a load of loot Clooney has
supposedly hidden.  Of course, things go awry in classic, semi-bizarre
Coen brothers style.  There's a meeting with a one-eyed Bible salesman
(John Goodman), a chance encounter with an overly sensitive Babyface
Nelson, and a flirtation with fame when the cons become hillbilly
singers.  Oh, and I forgot to mention encounters with the Ku Klux Klan,
the excitable governor of Mississippi (a hysterical Charles Durning),
three very sexy sirens, and a load of spirituality.</P>
<P>        A lot is thrown at the audience here, but Joel and Ethan (no, I don't
know them) continue to be experts at molding the workings of a fevered
imagination with dramatic substance.  Look at Fargo.  Yes, it is about a
kidnapping gone brutally awry and the excessively pregnant cop who
solves the case, but the film is really a portrait of a small-town
nobody (William H. Macy's car salesman) and how unbelievably desperate
he is to be someone -- so much so that he initiates his own wife's
abduction.</P>
<P>        The same magnificent trick happens in Brother.  The sirens, the fame,
the power of Babyface are all brilliantly presented as part of a
supremely entertaining road movie.  But these events and people are
material obstacles the characters must overcome to achieve real
happiness and awareness, which occurs in a climax I wouldn't dare spoil.</P>
<P>        The performances from the three leads are a huge asset, as they avoid
becoming three Forrest Gump clones.  Nelson is especially good.  I've
never heard of him, but I'd like to see more of him.  As a yokel who's
determined to get the family farm back, he has a goofy lack of
pretension that seems genuine.  He's the anti-Pauly Shore.</P>
<P>        As for Turturro, is there any role the man can't play?  I've been
watching him for years, and he's never given a bad performance.  He's
played child-molesting bowlers, card sharks, meek general store clerks,
and rednecks all the same way-superbly.  Clooney is also edging up on my
list of suave and talented actors.  His laid-back, articulate cool
provides the perfect tone for the movie.  It's a joy to watch him here.</P>
<P>        And it's a joy to watch this movie as a whole.  The Coen brothers are
all about pushing the envelope, and then reading the surprisingly
intelligent, thoughtful letter inside.  In Brother the skill and clarity
in which they do this is astounding.</P>
