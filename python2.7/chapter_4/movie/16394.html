<PRE>A SIMPLE PLAN
Review by Victory A. Marasigan

<P>A Simple Plan is a taut, gripping thriller-drama about a pipe dream
which becomes reality...and then strips three unsuspecting men of their
innocence.  At the film's outset, Hank Mitchell (Bill Paxton) considers
his life acceptable, if not spectacular.  He has a loving wife, a baby
on the way, and he's respected as a member of his midwestern community.
There may be hints of a strained relationship between him and his
hyuck-hyucking older brother Jacob (Billy Bob Thornton), but it's
nothing either of the boys feels deserves discussion. If asked, Hank
probably wouldn't consider changing a thing.</P>
<P>Hank's content perspective on life is skewed when, along with Jacob and
his brother's slovenly buddy Lou (Brent Briscoe), he discovers a crashed
puddle-jumper carrying over $4 million.  "No one's looking for this
cash," rationalize Jacob and Lou. "Who's gonna know?"  Hank, the only
one of the trio with an education and a steady job, tries to fight the
notion of keeping the money.  After some goading from Jacob and Lou,
Hank opts to store the cash and see what happens.  It isn't long after
taking the money home that Hank begins to feel his conscience
weakening.  But it's already too late.  Murphy's Law has already gone
into effect.  Before the boys can even begin to appreciate the
life-changing heft of their "lucky" discovery, an innocent man is dead
and people are talking.</P>
<P>Thornton's performance as Jacob is probably the best thing about the
film, laying to rest any post-Sling Blade doubt that Billy Bob is a
great actor.  Jacob is a simple man, a social outcast with with no
dreams to pursue.   His slow toothy drawl betrays his lack of
"book-larnin'," but some of the things that come out of his mouth
indicate a sharp if underused intelligence.</P>
<P>Director Sam Raimi, best known for his bizarre Evil Dead horror series,
is for once aesthetically subdued in his direction.  His camera seems to
care more about the actors on the screen than their visually brilliant
surroundings.   Perhaps this is because the director realized that the
way in which the three men's situation spins out of control is thrilling
in itself, without fancy cinematography getting in the way.  The
sheet-white nothingness of thesnow-covered town adequately illustrates
the moral void these men must traverse.</P>
<P>As another tale of money and murder in the snow, this film is sure to
breed comparisons to the well-crafted murder-and-money flick Fargo.  But
A Simple Plan works on a different level, addressing issues of family
discord and individual self-worth throughout its shocking story.  By the
time poor Jacob woefully asks his brother, "Do you ever feel evil?" it's
clear this film is no Fargo rip-off.</P>
<P>Only towards the end of A Simple Plan are we reminded that we're
watching a movie.  The final act plot twist is all too contrived and
convenient. Thankfully, it leads to a compelling ending with logical
implications.  When all is said and done, we are left with the notion
that sometimes what's best for us is what we already have.</P>
