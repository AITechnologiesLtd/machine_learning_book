<P>I was originally going to give The Spanish Prisoner two and half stars. From my
first viewing, I noticed that David Mamet's film was intense and clever at
times but boring and cliched at other times especially at the beginning. From
my second viewing however, I noticed that Mamet's script was actually a
masterpiece. The Spanish Prisoner, like The Usual Suspects or Chinatown, begs
for the viewer's complete attention. Miss a scene or even a small detail, and
you could miss the meaning of the entire film. Also like the aforementioned
films, it rewards its viewer for paying attention by delivering a surprising
and memorable ending. Mamet is success doing again what he once tackled in 1987
when he wrote and directed House of Games. Like his past gem, The Spanish
Prisoner fools the audience as much (or even more) than the victim. Because we
were deceived just like the victim, we feel a strong attachment to the main
character and consequently are more interested in the film. Mamet has the
talent of not completely ending a film gift wrapped, but rather leaving some
ambiguity towards the end. The power that he has in forcing the viewer to
determine who the good guys and bad guys are once the film is over, without
giving a right answer, is unique and ingenious. The Spanish Prisoner will leave
you seriously puzzled and intrigued. After seeing the film again, I noticed
that the details Mamet uses are so incredibly accurate it is frightening. His
direction is very subtle; as he leaves so many clues explaining what is going
on and who is who but it is still very difficult to tell what exactly is
happening even if you see all of them, or think you see all of them. </P>
<P>The story follows a young up and coming businessman, Joe Ross, (Campbell Scott)
who has just created a mysterious and lucrative "process" that everyone is
trying to get their hands on. Soon Ross does not know who he can trust or who
is after his "process." Through his journey Ross meets a number of mysterious
characters: The rich and popular Jimmy Dell, a secretary who has a huge crush
on Ross, and Ross' boss Mr. Klein. Played by Steve Martin, Rebecca Pidgeon, and
Ben Gazarra respectively, the supporting cast is very solid especially Martin,
who deserved an Oscar nomination for his commanding and manipulative role. The
most interesting character in the film, though, was Campbell Scott's Joe Ross.
The character's transformation from an ingenuous and polite rookie to a
paranoid veteran is very apparent and justifiable. </P>
<P>David Mamet's script is so interesting because we know people don't actually
talk like the characters in the film, yet we feel so connected to some of them.
His beguiling style could fool any viewer up for the challenge. This is a must
see, for those interested in solving a complex puzzle of a movie.</P>
