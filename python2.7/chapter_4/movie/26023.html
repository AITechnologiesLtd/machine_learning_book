<P>Much has been made about this film and its well-rounded cast. Here you have
some of the older school's finer wines including James Caan, Ellen Burstyn
and Faye Dunaway, mixed in with some of the new generation's younger punks
including Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron and Joaquin Phoenix. A diverse cast
to say the least. Add writer/director James Gray to the top of the totem
pole, a man who waited six years after his directorial debut of LITTLE
ODESSA to create this film, and you've got an interesting melange of
cinematic experiences. Now let's see how this mixture tastes...</P>
<P>PLOT:
Having taken one for the team, Leo returns home after spending some time in
the pen, hopeful to return to the straight and narrow. Working for his
uncle, Leo gets trained by his buddy Willie, an expert in the dirty
political games prevalent in their industry. But it isn't long before one
such shady incident goes terribly awry and it's every man for himself. Of
course, Leo is once again left flailing in the wind of suspicion.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
This is a decent morality tale strapped to a very dark and depressing
setting, ultimately salvaged by many top-notch performances. A "gritty urban
drama" is probably the best way to describe this damp flick, a film that
certainly does present an interesting story, but does so in a manner that
just didn't grab me as much as I thought it would. There is very little
enthusiasm in this film, it's slow-paced, dreary and pretty gloomy for the
most part. In fact, the lead character played adequately by Mark Wahlberg
looks like he's going to kill himself in almost every other scene. He's down
and out. The film reminded me a lot of Scorsese's breakout 1973 picture MEAN
STREETS in many ways. Both pictures take place in the "mean streets" of New
York City. Both flicks seem to have an aversion to bright shots. And just as
in Scorsese's film, the so-called "dire" circumstances in this story
underwhelmed me for the most part. I mean, it just seemed like people were
making too much of things that didn't seem to necessitate all that hoopla.
Now don't get me wrong, the film does contain real moments of suspense,
characters caught in situations in which they have little way out.</P>
<P>But on the whole, I never really felt very close to any of the characters,
and telegraphed much of the film's grinding progression. But despite all
that, the performances were strong across the board, with Caan and Phoenix
grabbing most of the gusto. Burstyn and Dunaway were decent, but had very
little to do, while Theron took on yet another look and still managed to
punch in a solid performance. But it is Joaquin Phoenix who will likely be
the one most remembered for this film. Alternating between the many
different facets of his character, Joaquin danced the perfect line and will
hopefully be tagged with a nomination of some sort at the end of the year.
And despite the many similarities between this film and his directorial
debut, James Gray did manage to put an authentic representation of the times
on the screen, but not without overstylizing some of the film's more
poignant moments (appreciated by others, I found some of his tactics to be
distracting). So don't expect any major originality points with this film
but do expect to see some great actors doing their thing. And if you enjoy
dramas which focus on family, loyalty, redemption and all that fun stuff,
this film certainly packs much of that in its mix. Just don't expect to be
smacked upside the head by it all. Maybe just a gentle tap...</P>
