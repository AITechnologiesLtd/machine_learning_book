<P>The Truman Show
1998  Dir: Peter Weir
7/10
 I went into this movie with a lot of expectations.  While I'm not a huge 
fan of Jim Carrey, the premise sounded extremely fascinating, and the 
word of mouth had been glowing.  Sadly, while the Truman Show is 'pretty 
good', it never quite becomes the masterpiece that it was meant to be.
 For those of you tuning in late, the film stars Jim Carrey as Truman 
Burbank, a man whose entire life is really a television show.  His wife, 
his friends, etc. are all actors.  His town is a set.  So on, so on. 
 Eventually he begins to discover what's going on.  
 The problem of the film lies mostly in its tone.  While for the most 
part it is a somewhat serious film, constant bits of humor are thrown in. 
 Sometimes this helps the film, as when we laugh at Truman's life.  But 
other times, such as when we see the reactions of a viewer to Truman's 
stormy sea voyage, it destroys any tension.  This movie doesn't quite 
know what it wants to be.
 The ending truly underscores this fact.  While it would be a marvelous 
ending for a satire about our society and our obsession with television, 
which this movie does court becoming, it doesn't fit the film we have 
seen, which is really about Truman.  The Truman Show could have been a 
brilliant satire about society, or it could have been a moving character 
study/Twilight Zone episode.  Instead, by not choosing a direction, it 
becomes neither and finally settles on pleasant mediocrity.</P>
