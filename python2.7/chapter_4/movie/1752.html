<PRE>                                THE VANISHING (1993)
                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     Barney (Jeff Bridges) is an eccentric college professor whose
unstable personality leads him to attempt kidnappings in order to
resolve certain issues about his inner self that he doesn't understand.
While his initial attempts at abduction are failures, he eventually
succeeds with Diane (Sandra Bullock).  Her disappearance drives
boyfriend Jeff into an obsessive frenzy to learn her fate--did she run
out on him after the argument they had shortly before she vanished, or
is there another, more sinister solution to the mystery?</P>
<P>     George Sluizer, the man at the helm for this version of THE
VANISHING, was also the force behind the original 1988 Dutch film.
What happened between the original and this remake is what too often
occurs when Hollywood attempts to meddle with something superlative -
an inferior product is born.  It's surprising, and a little sad, that
Sluizer not only condoned the changes made to the American story, but
championed them.</P>
<P>     The original rendering of THE VANISHING is a tense thriller,
powerful and compelling.  Co-written and directed by Sluizer, it shows
how good a film of this sort can be when it doesn't depend upon
formulas, stock situations, and pre-fabricated characters.  Of course,
some of the credit must go to Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu (the actor who
plays the kidnapper), who manages to create a personality who is at
once creepy, sympathetic, and hateful.</P>
<P>     The remake is nothing if not disappointing.  Although much of the
story follows the original, it's the parts that deviate which hurt the
film.  While Nancy Travis is a fair actress, it's her character of Rita
that singlehandedly destroys the movie's uniqueness.  The
sensationalization of THE VANISHING is painful to watch.</P>
<P>     The transition of the story from Holland to Washington state is a
smooth one.  Whole scenes are left intact, down to the dialogue and
camera angles.  The performers in this THE VANISHING are every bit as
good as their foreign counterparts, and the characters are equally
well-realized.  In the few short minutes they have on screen together,
Sutherland and Bullock manage to mould the Jeff/Diane relationship into
something that the audience can believe.  Likewise, Jeff Bridges'
Barney is as complex as the villain played by Donnadieu.</P>
<P>     Nothing about Rita is good, except perhaps the job done by Nancy
Travis in portraying her.  She is a stock character introduced into the
film simply to "Hollywoodize" the production.  Her relationship with
Jeff is contrived and unbelievable.  Her powers of deduction, which
would make Sherlock Holmes look stupid, are ludicrous.  Unfortunately,
they're also crucial to the resolution of the movie.</P>
<P>     THE VANISHING starts out with an interesting premise, and presents
a good study of two extreme characters (Bridges' deranged Barney and
Sutherland's obsessed Jeff).  However, what begins with promise 
degenerates into a typical stalker film, with an ending that is pat and 
predictable.  Too much of what is good about the original THE VANISHING 
has been taken out, and the material added to replace it is sub-par.  On
the whole, this isn't a particularly good movie.</P>
<PRE>                           Rating:  6.3 (C, **)</PRE>
