<P>Starring Samuel L. Jackson, Tommy Lee Jones, Guy Pearce, Bruce
Greenwood, Ben Kingsley. Directed by William Friedkin. Rated R.</P>
<P>I'm not the first to say this, but Rules of Engagement is a real
testament to the skills of three great actors. The movie itself is
utterly hollow, a confused diatribe unable or unwilling to determine
what exactly its convictions are. I've heard that the reason for this
is the film's commercialization for easy access by a wide audience and
for once, it may have been for the best. As it stands, I would have
probably enjoyed the film far less had it been a moral lesson rather
than just an entertaining popcorn flick.</P>
<P>The movie begins in the jungles of Vietnam, where Colonels Terry
Childers (Samuel L. Jackson) and Hayes Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones) are
under a surprise guerrilla attack by North Vietnamese soldiers. Hodges
is shot. A desperate Childers executes a Vietnamese soldier in an
effort to make the general tell his troops to back off. He then drages
Hodges to safety. This scene is there to set up the fact that Hodges is
indebted to Childers -- something that will become important later on.</P>
<P>Years pass. Hayes Hodges is now a small-time military lawyer about to
retire; Childers is still an active Colonel. One day, he is sent to the
American embassy in Yemen, where native protesters have surrounded the
building with the ambassador (Ben Kingsley) inside and are getting
rowdy. In essense, this is a babysitting mission: go in, get the
ambassador out, leave. But things get more complicated than that. It
seems there are snipers set up in strategic locations around the
building and the crowd also seems to have weapons. Childers' marines
start to get shot. Panicking, Childers orders his men to fire into the
crowd, yelling "Waste the motherfuckers." 73 Yemenese civilians die;
over a hundred are injured.</P>
<P>Back at home, the head honchos of the military are scared to death of a
scandal. The National Security Adviser (Bruce Greenwood) decides to
avoid fingers pointed at the American military by blaming the whole
thing on Col. Childers. He destroys the tape that proves that the crowd
in front of the embassy did indeed have weapons. Childers is court
marshaled and charged with murder. He asks his old friend Hayes to
defend him. At first, Hayes is reluctant ("I'm a good enough lawyer to
know that you need a better lawyer than me.") but finally gives in
because of his debt to his friend. Meanwhile, Major Mark Biggs (Guy
Pearce), a big-shot, Stanford-educated lawyer, volunteers to prosecute.</P>
<P>Rules of Engagement is one of the more engrossing military dramas that
I've seen. It was directed by William Friedkin (The Exorcist), who has
a flair for undistinctive, unpretentious but always effective
camerawork. He uses camera tricks but he doesn't over use them (ahem,
Oliver Stone) and the result is a movie that flows smoothly, grabbing
your attention from point one and never letting go.</P>
<P>Friedkin really has his stars to thank for that. Jackson is excellent,
despite having the most bombastic and least versatile of the roles in
the movie. Even in his character's most defeated state, he still exudes
authority. Jones has opportunities for poignancy, action and even
laughs. Despite being typecast nowadays, he's still a consistently
entertaining actor -- and as a lawyer, he's unbeatable. I also liked
what Guy Pearce did with the thankless role of the prosecuting
attorney. He's a villain in the story, yes, but Pearce makes him a
little more than that: a ruthless man with a little sympathy running
underneath.</P>
<P>It should be said that Rules of Engagement has absolutely no message.
It doesn't know what it wants to say, or even if it wants to say
anything. It takes a point of view: Col. Childers should not be
punished because the crowd had weapons and he was defending his men.
And then it begins to thematically eat itself by starting to make
arguments for the other side. It goes back and forth that way until we
abandon all hope of the film actually being significant and focus on
the glorious performances and the smart, concise, enjoyable dialogue.
The courtroom scenes, at least, have the force of conviction.</P>
<P>When push comes to shove, Rules of Engagement comes through as a
mindless courtroom melodrama and inevitably fails on the rare occasions
when it tries to pass itself off as something more than that. It's not
brain food, but no one will be bored.</P>
