<PRE>                            THE SANTA CLAUSE
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks

<P>        Tim Allen of "Home Improvement" stars in this winter's 
big family Christmas movie. At the beginning, jolly old St. Nick 
falls off Allen's roof on Christmas Eve. Santa agrees not to sue if 
Allen tries on his clothes and jumps in his sleigh. Sound like 
innocent family fun to you or a night at the all-male cinema? Just 
asking. Allen puts on the suit and is whisked away to the North 
Pole, where he meets the elves, who are actually just a bunch of 
kids who never grew up. In other words, the Hollywood script-
writers responsible for this childish movie.</P>
<P>        After a night of toy delivery, he turns up back in his own 
bed, convinced the whole thing was a dream brought on by some 
bad eggnog. However, he soons beginning gaining weight rapidly 
and sporting a thick gray mane and beard (so is this guy supposed to 
be metamorphosing into Santa Claus or Kenny Rogers?). The people 
around him think maybe it's a little weird that he's gained sixty 
pounds in a week and it doesn't help matters much when Allen's 
kid starts telling everyone his dad is the big S.</P>
<P>        But Allen eventually comes to grips with his Santahood 
and convinces his ex-wife and her live-in psychiatrist boyfriend (this 
may be the first Disney movie where two characters are "shacked 
up," if you don't count those dwarves from SNOW WHITES, also 
reminiscent of a night at the all-male cinema) that he's not really 
insane. Sure, people ride around in sleighs driven by flying reindeer 
and slide down people's chimneys all the time. What, don't tell me 
I'm the only one!</P>
<P>        At least in this movie the writers try to explain exactly 
how fat old Santa gets down all those chimneys and delivers all 
those toys in one night... even if it is a really stupid explanation. 
Thrown in a typical formulaic sappy and happy Michael Eisner 
ending and you've got a decent Christmas movie for the entire 
(dysfunctional) family.</P>
