<P>     "I finished shooting THE BLUE KITE in 1992.  But while I was
involved in post-production, several official organizations involved
with China's film industry screened the film.  They decided that it had
a problem concerning its political 'leanings,' and prevented its
completion.  The fact that it can appear today seems like a miracle...
The stories in the film are real, and they are related with total
sincerity.  What worries me is that it is precisely a fear of reality
and sincerity that has led to the ban on such stories being told."
     - Tian Zhuangzhuang, director of THE BLUE KITE</P>
<P>     THE BLUE KITE recounts how a child and his mother survive through
the turbulence of China during the 1950s and 60s, when political
beliefs that were proper one year might be deemed counterrevolutionary
the next.  It is a troubling climate, where nothing is certain, and the
greatest difficulty of growing up lies in determining what is proper
behavior and what is likely to get you taken away for "reform."</P>
<P>     The narrator of THE BLUE KITE is Tietou (played by Yi Tian as an
infant, Zhang Wenyao as a young boy, and Chen Xiaoman as an
adolescent), whose birth in 1953 occurs early in the film.  His
parents, librarian Shalong (Pu Quanxin) and teacher Shujuan (Lu Liping)
are supporters of the Maoist revolution, but that doesn't stop Shalong
from being accused of counterrevolutionary activities and sent off a
labor camp, where a tree falls on him and kills him.  It is Shujuan and
Tietou's struggles through this and subsequent trials that form the
background of Tian Zhuangzhuang's motion picture.</P>
<P>     Tian's criticism of the Chinese revolution is effective because of
its subtlety.  As was true in Chen Kaige's FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE, the
characters' stories are used to present the injustices of the system.
If anything, the methods employed in this film are less direct than
those in CONCUBINE, but no less disturbing.</P>
<P>     Tietou's courage, Shujuan's spirit, and the love between mother
and child are the immutable elements of THE BLUE KITE.  No matter what
year it is or how dire the circumstances faced by the characters (and,
at several points, circumstances become dire indeed), these three
things are constant.</P>
<P>     The acting by the principles, especially that of Chen Xiaoman and
Lu Liping, is superb.  Lu's unaffected presentation of the spectrum of
human emotions creates a very real Shujuan.</P>
<P>     Tian's method of storytelling, while reasonably straightforward,
will be unfamiliar to many American movie-goers.  Careful attention to
the story is demanded, especially for those unfamiliar with the
background.  Because numerous scenes end abruptly and are often
followed by sudden time changes, it's easy to lose track of what's
going on in THE BLUE KITE.</P>
<P>     Many of the movies coming from so-called "Fifth Generation"
Chinese filmmakers (such as Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou) are either
banned in their native country, or heavily censored.  The government
has shown an unwillingness to allow any criticism of their policies,
either past or present.  However, one proverbial "silver lining" in
this cloud of controversy has been the greater worldwide recognition
and distribution of productions such as THE BLUE KITE.  We in the West
should feel fortunate to be exposed to such well-crafted, provocative
motion pictures.</P>
