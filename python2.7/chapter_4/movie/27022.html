<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A steamy noir for its time, featuring the sultry, long hair-tossing Rita
Hayworth, the hard-boiled Glenn Ford, and the sinister George Macready.
This is sexpot Rita's finest moment in films as an actress and
chanteuse, which enshrined her as the love goddess of the 1940s. The
script has a field day with Freudian explanations and sexual innuendoes
dropped as easily as falling rain, as Rita lays on Glenn how much he
suffers from a fear of the female. This theme takes hold of this dark
film and overshadows the milder intrigue about Macready, himself a Nazi
collaborator, fronting for a Nazi-controlled tungsten cartel. A
fascinating film for all the dark avenues it opened up sexually for
future films. The film is all style and charismatic acting. The story is
absurd and could not be anything but risible, if if wasn't for the
bizarre performances by the stars to give it credibility.</P>
<P>Johnny Farrell (Ford) is a desperate adventurer, using loaded dice to
beat some American sailors and locals in an Buenos Aires casino. After
the game he is jumped by a thug about to clean him out, but is saved by
Ballin Mundson (Macready), who uses his dagger-laden cane to fend him
off. Johnny is the loyal sort and ends up working for Ballin in his
casino as his manager, dedicating his life to being Ballin's man Friday,
which is his way of paying him back.</P>
<P>Things are fine until Ballin returns from a business trip with a sexy
young bride, Gilda (Rita). What Ballin doesn't know but quickly senses
is that Johnny and Gilda were once lovers, until the insecure Johnny
walked out on her in a jealous rage. He shows a hatred for her, which
both Ballin and Gilda can see through as a love he secretly harbors for
her. Ballin is not only the possessive type, but he's a dangerous hombre
and threatens anybody who messes with his goods. The fun in the film,
comes from Rita realizing that both men look upon her as a sex object,
and she gets her kicks by taunting Johnny and acting like a loose woman
by running after other men. Ballin assigns Johnny to watch her and make
sure she behaves, and he does it, even if it gets under his skin that
he's the flunky always bringing her home to Ballin with an excuse for
her whereabouts, which he does only because he fears what Ballin would
do to her if he knew she was running around.</P>
<P>The police under Obregon (Calleia) keep a watch on the illegal casino
but do not close it down because they have bigger fish to fry. They know
but can't prove that Ballin made a secret deal with the Nazis to control
the world's tungsten production and that something fishy is going on now
between him and the Nazis over the patents he holds. They are keeping an
eye on those things by watching the casino and therefore have no plans
to close it.</P>
<P>Since the Nazis are coming after him, Ballin plans to take Gilda away
with him to escape them, but he spies her kissing Johnny and telling him
that her husband is a lunatic. Ballin leaves without her and fakes a
plane crash at sea, where there is a boat waiting to take him to safety
when he bails out of the crashing plane. The police believe he's dead,
and in his will he leaves everything to Gilda and makes Johnny the
executor of his will.</P>
<P>Johnny marries Gilda to punish her for cheating on his best friend. He
is so overcome with rage and jealousy, that he not only abandons her on
their wedding night but keeps her a virtual prisoner in Buenos Aires,
having his security men follow her, preventing her from seeing other men
and getting an annulment. The clearest summation of the story comes in
the film's most sensational and memorable scene, as Gilda is dressed in
a tight-fitting black satin evening gown and sings 'Put the Blame on
Mame,' intoning in an erotic manner what is eating away at Johnny while
suggesting a full striptease by removing a glove. This puts Johnny in a
frenzy, but it was her only way of getting back at his misogynistic
actions.</P>
<P>Spoiler in the next paragraph. Skip if you don't want to know how the
story is resolved.</P>
<P>Ballin returns from the dead to kill both of them and reclaim his
empire, but as he is about to kill them he drops his cane and decides to
shoot them, but the philosophizing casino shoeshine man (Geray), picks
up the cane and puts an end to Ballin. By this time Johnny realizes he
loves her and they both realize they had been stinkers as they get back
together.</P>
<P>Rita was simply stupendous here and makes this slight B-film a memorable
one. The film could be viewed as a study in the main characters'
pathologies and of a peeling away of the unconscious, highlighted by the
hinting of a quasi-gay relationship between Macready and Glenn, where
they only care about loyalty and do not seem to care what else they have
in common. Glenn's behavior is deviant, whether it is when he is asexual
before the arrival of Rita, or in the continual suppression of his
sexual appetite after he realizes that she's toying with him, even when
realizing that he's the one she really wants. Glenn's behavior is so
complex, that his actions toward Gilda after they marry, seem to be best
explained as a way he devised for punishing her for marrying and then
for leaving Macready. There are no innocents here, she married for
money, Glenn went into a business arrangement for money without caring
to know how evil his partner was, and Macready used his money to
greedily get what he wanted. This emotionally charged love triangle is
better acted than its silly story sounds. It's a studio film, with even
its revealing carnival scene, an unloading of sexual repression and
delve into the unconscious, done indoors on the cheesy Hollywood set.</P>
