MR. JONES
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>Richard Gere is a really great actor, but sometimes his
presence of the screen can be really annoying. It usually
happens because of his tendency to torpedo many promising
roles with his overacting, often inappropriate for the
occasion. However, while many conventional roles are simply
too conventional for Gere, there are roles that look like a
perfect fit for his usual screen personality. Many of those
roles deal with some forms of mental illness or deficiency -
fertile ground for Academy Awards, judging by the last few
decades.</P>
<P>Of all mental illnesses, manic-depressive psychosis (or
"bipolar disorder", as refered in modern American medical
literature) is probably the most suitable for actors who
want to push their limits. While the intellectual abilities
of the patients are untouched, that illness is characterised
with sometimes sudden, sometimes gradual mood swings that
vary between manic euphoria and almost catatonic depression.
In this film Richard Gere plays Mr. Jones, one of the people
who are suffering from that illness. But when we are
introduced to Mr. Jones, we see that he doesn't suffer at
all - we are exposed to his manic side, his "highs", and he
look like someone who enjoys life more than most of us.
Problem is that his euphoric outbursts often lead him to
trouble, like when he tries to fly off the construction
site, or conduct philharmonic concerto by himself. As an
aftermath of those incidents, he is always brought back to
psychiatric ward, and medical staff tries to control his
condition with various drugs. Doctor Libbie Bowen (Lena
Olin) is trying to treat him, but soon she finds that she
has more than professional interests in her patient.</P>
<P>British director Mike Figgis has already made reputation by
often dark and depressing dramas and thrillers like STORMY
MONDAY or INTERNAL AFFAIRS. In MR. JONES, his tendency
towards depressive subject was watered down due to the
script by Eric Roth and Michael Christopher. Two writers
decided to make this film light, despite its serious and
potentially very depressive subject. As a result, the
audience finds very little about the main character - at
least when he has his "bad" days. We also find very little
about the nature of the illness itself, and the dilemmas
psychiatrists must make when they deal with patients.
Finally, in order to make this film as formulaic as
possible, we are given unecessary and quite disappointing
romantic subplot.</P>
<P>But, it actually doesn't matter much in the end. Richard
Gere in this role behaves like a fish in the water and
literally chewes the screen with his acting. Of course, his
personality overshadowed anyone else, including his partner
Lena Olin, but we are still able to notice more than good
supporting roles, most notable of them being one played by
Delroy Lindo. In the end, film ends predictably, but for
most of its 114 minutes, audience isn't bored, mostly thanks
to Figgis' capable directing and good production values.
Hardly a masterpiece, and nothing more than a solid piece of
formulaic Hollywood entertainment, MR. JONES is still the
film to be recommended, and not just to Richard Gere fans or
those who like melodramas.</P>
