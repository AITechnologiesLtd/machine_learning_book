<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This well-conceived but ultra sugary coming-of-age film is not for
everyone, and I include myself as one of those who found it too sappy
for my digestion.</P>
<P>Joseph Cross (Joshua Beal) is a 10-year-old who is saddened by the
recent loss of his grandfather (Loggia) to bone marrow cancer. Loggia is
wonderful in relating to the child in such a wholesome manner, it almost
saves this film from drowning in syrup. The Beals are like a sitcom
idyllic family, where everyone is just so nice and affluent, and
properly religious without being fanatical. The Beals, the father (Denis
Leary) and his wife (Dana Delany), are both successful doctors; Julia
Stiles plays Joshua's older sister, needling her younger brother but
also showing that she really cares about him. This is a family seemingly
conceived in heaven, but living in south Philadelphia, sending their
children to a well-run Catholic school. Joshua, the protagonist and the
narrator of this yarn, is a handsome, sweet, intelligent, friendly, and
endearing child, who does well in school, relates to the nuns and
priests, and talks politely to his well-meaning parents. All this
mawkish interplay makes it almost too nauseating to watch.</P>
<P>The plot arises when Joseph has a problem coping with the death of his
beloved grandfather, who promised to be with him forever. His answer is
to search for God, pretty heady stuff for a youngster his age to do, but
that's just the way it is, sometimes.</P>
<P>This search for God takes us nowhere because, as his friend David
(Reifsnyder) says, where can you look for him if he doesn't exist. Now,
that's a smart kid. But Joseph looks for him in the usual places, and
what better place than to start in the parochial school he attends. One
of his teachers is the kind-hearted Sister Terry (Rosie O'Donnell), who
wears a Philly baseball hat and equates the Jesus stories with baseball,
making him the clean-up hitter, and in my opinion, if she wasn't a big
TV star, would have a vocation as a parochial school teacher, she is
that convincing. Throughout the film, she is saved from answering any
tough (sic!) question about God by the bell, as it rings to end the
class.</P>
<P>Nothing much happens in the search for God, there is no parody of the
Catholic school; though a visiting cardinal is found by the boy not to
be able to talk to God, but this is gentle stuff, no real criticism or
search for God is attempted. What comes next into play is some Hollywood
hokum, which is designed not to upset anyone, as Joseph has a reassuring
encounter with a real, live angel, a blond little boy his own age and
dressed like him in the Catholic school uniform who wears the innocuous
smile of a goody-goody. The film ends as this angel (!!!) tells him his
grandfather is all right. His quest is ended, as apparently angels don't
have wings and are approachable; and God, well, ... maybe that's for
another film down the road. This part of the film was the final straw
for me, I couldn't swallow any more goo.</P>
<P>As this film flopped commercially, his next one, The Sixth Sense, pared
down the schmaltz and came up smelling like a rose. Though if you look
through the cleverness of both scripts, this director is loaded with
hokum, all he has learned how to do, is hide the hokum better. Well, God
bless him, if he can do that. This is a nice family picture and there is
room for it in Hollywood. It's just too bad that it had nothing relevent
or even truthful to say about death, children in a parochial elementary
school, or for that matter, about God. And that family of his, they're
too good for words. Yet the film meant well and its benign message had
its heart in the right place. For those who want to see something soft,
without a bite to it, this is the one.</P>
