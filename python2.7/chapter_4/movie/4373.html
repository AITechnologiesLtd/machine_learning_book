<PRE>(*** out of four)</PRE>
<P>     There were two things I was looking forward to in June of 1995
(besides graduating from high school, of course): the Michael Jackson
HIStory album and BATMAN FOREVER, both of which turned out to be less
than ideal.  Everyone's saying this new Batman movie is a definite
improvement over the doom and gloom of the Tim Burton movies, which I
both liked, but there's really no way to compare the two because
they're so completely different.  In fact, it seems to me that great
measures were taken to ensure this movie was distanced as far from the
first two Batman movies as possible. Instead of calling it BATMAN 3, as
if to actually admit the Burton films exist, they called it BATMAN
FOREVER, which makes it seem more like a household cleaning product
than a movie ("Want to remove tough stains fast?  Use BATMAN
FOREVER.").</P>
<P>     Michael Keaton, who put on the cape and cowl in the other Batman
movies (and did an unexpectedly good job of it), has been replaced by
Val Kilmer, who makes Adam West seem almost Shakespearean. Kilmer's
portrayal of Batman is one-dimensional and wooden, and the manner in
which he delivers most of his serious lines borders on self-parody
("Are you trying to get under my cape, doctor?").</P>
<P>     Then there's The Riddler, played by a man you know I don't
like--Jim Carrey, who pretty much plays himself in a green
question-mark suit. I know there is a substantial percentage of people
out there who actually think Jim Carrey is funny, but then there are
also a lot of people who think they've been abducted by aliens and
stalked by Elvis. Most intelligent people see right through the strange
facial configurations and recycled soundbites (The only thing missing
is an "Al-l-l-l-l-righty then.") and realize there's nothing funny
underneath, particularly when you realize the Riddler character is
meant to be crazy but not a comedian, kind of like The Joker from the
first Batman, played masterfully by Jack Nicholson. Of course,
comparing Nicholson and Carrey is an exercise in futility, like
comparing The Beatles and Weezer.</P>
<P>     Tommy Lee Jones plays the other villain, Two-Face, the epitome of
duality. One side is normal, upright, law-abiding, and the other is
ruthlessly evil, as a result of a face-scarring acid accident. You have
to give credit to Jones for at least trying to stay in character (more
than I can say for Carrey), but his performance, while notable, still
comes off as second-banana to scene-stealing (the ultimate crime)
Carrey, or did you notice they devoted thirty minutes to The Riddler's
origin and a ten-second passing reference to Two-Face?</P>
<P>     The movie's best performance is delivered by Chris O'Donnell
(Pacino's lackey in Scent of a Woman), who plays Dick Grayson, a
tormented acrobat teen whose family has been killed by Two-Face. He is
taken in as millionaire Bruce Wayne's youthful ward and, upon learning
Bruce's identity, insists on avenging his parents' murder as Batman's
sidekick. For a "light-hearted" movie, this aspect of O'Donnell's
character, along with Kilmer's flashback dreams of his parents' murders
and the realization that revenge has become his life, is definitely as
dark and moody as anything Burton did.</P>
<P>     Rounding out the cast (with a stand-out performance) is Nicole
Kidman as Dr. Chase Meridian, who is obsessed with Batman but soon
finds herself drawn to Bruce Wayne as well. Gee, that's a tough
choice.  And what if Batman ever found out she has having an affair
with Bruce Wayne? That's a fight I'd like to see. Kidman is as sexy as
ever (especially since I don't remember her ever being particularly
sexy in the first place) and is as good a replacement for Kim
Basinger's Vicki Vale as anyone. Another example of the disowning of
the Burton Batman films by Batman Forever comes when Kilmer tells
Kidman no one has ever found out about his secret identity before, even
though Vicki Vale, Catwoman and Max Shreck (evil businessman
Christopher Walken) all stumbled upon his identity in the first two
movies.</P>
<P>     Then there are the supporting players. Two-Face's duality is
brought out further in his two girlfriends--nice-girl Sugar (Drew
Barrymore, in the stretch of her career) and naughty dominatrix (I've
always wanted to use that word in a review) Spice (No One I've Ever
Heard Of). And the only two returning actors from Batman and Batman
Returns, Michael Gough as Alfred, Bruce's butler and confidant, and Pat
Hingle as Commissioner Gordon.</P>
<P>     The BATMAN FOREVER director, Joel Schumacher, has abandoned the
dark, Gothic style sets of BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS in favor of a more
surreal, psychedelic comic book which helps create a mood that's
lighter and more trippy. It's blatantly obvious, though, that the
Gotham buildings are computer-generated, whereas the Burton skyline
consisted of tediously constructed miniatures, but again, comparing the
styles of Burton and Schumacher is like comparing apples and nipples
(whatever that means).</P>
<P>     The Batcostumes in BATMAN FOREVER are even more sleek and
streamlined than the Keaton costume, though for some odd reason,
Robin's costume includes fake nipples on the chest (so now it is like
comparing apples and nipples). Even the Batmobile is a different car.
This one shoots fire out the back all the time (fueled by Mexican food
apparently) and sports a strange-looking fin running the length of the
back of the car. Maybe Batman bought it used from Sharkman. One thing I
do know--the old Batmobile was a lot better.</P>
<P>     The plot this time has mad scientist Edward Nigma becoming The
Riddler after Bruce Wayne turns down funding for his invention "The
Box" (Isn't that a music video channel?), which makes interactive TV
possible, and also extracts knowledge from the minds of the viewers,
transporting it telepathically to the mind of The Riddler. It is
through this invention that The Riddler promises Two-Face knowledge of
Batman's true identity (which, according to Kilmer, has never before
been revealed--deliberate inconsistencies are the worst). In between,
the Chase Meridian/Batman and Robin story lines are developed and a few
death traps are thrown in to boot.</P>
<P>     All in all, BATMAN FOREVER is a good movie, but not as good as
it could have been with a few minor changes (drop Kilmer and Carrey,
tone down the set psychedelia, stick with the original costumes and
Batmobile, etc.). Still, I'm looking forward to that fourth Batman
movie in 1998.</P>
