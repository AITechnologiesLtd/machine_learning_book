<PRE>                               BAD GIRLS
                       A film review by Joan Ellis
                    Copyright 1995 Nebbadoon Syndicate</PRE>
<P>     BAD GIRLS is a good idea that is doomed by a terrible script.
There is fun to be had when a dormant genre reemerges in the packaging
of a new era, and the Western is now riding full tilt into the '90s
carrying new sensibilities about women.  Yes, they were there, but what
did they do?</P>
<P>     In this movie, they spring full-blown from the kitchens and beds
of the men they served, hang holsters on their hips and make their way
as ex-hookers bent on a new life.  Four game actresses - Madeleine
Stowe as Cody, Mary Stuart Masterson as Anita, Andie MacDowell as
Eileen and Drew Barrymore as Lilly - struggle with bad lines.  Ready
for a romp, they sink in embarrassment.</P>
<P>     Deciding to start a sawmill ("We sold our bodies, why can't we
sell wood?") on Anita's Oregon homestead land with Cody's life savings,
they trip over various barriers in their effort to flee their desert
surroundings.</P>
<P>     The barriers, which should create the plot but don't, are erected
by Kid Jarrett, Cody's former lover who is supposed to provide the
plot's tension but doesn't.  The Kid (James Russo) is a most
uncharismatic bandit whose sole redeeming characteristic is his open
air desert bedroom featuring a mirrored bureau and a bed draped in
luscious fabric, a sort of outdoor commercial for luxury living right
there in the raunchy, mean Old West.</P>
<P>     The whole state, it seems, is hunting the notorious Kid for reward
money while the truth of it is that the whiny little fellow seems to be
living a short ride from town, presiding over an unimaginably
uninteresting bunch of alcoholic simpletons.  In the manner of old
flames, Cody knows right where to find him when she wants her money
back, which makes the journey seem like a quick trip to the cleaners.</P>
<P>     The establishment townsmen are dressed in suits, the bandits in
dirty laundry and the women in bluejeans and guns - except when, in an
inexplicable genie-like poof, they materialize in glorious dresses.
Their faces carry smudges to indicate hard work.</P>
<P>     The very fine Andie MacDowall is reduced to curling her lip upward
to give us a lingering look at her beautiful smile.  Mary Stuart
Masterson has nothing to do except deliver one nice comment on a
timeless culture:  "I was worthless till I married, I'm worthless as a
widow.  I was worth something as a whore." Drew Barrymore does well by
her action scenes but has nothing to say.  Only Madeleine Stowe is
given a chance to draw a character, and she does it well given
impossible circumstances.</P>
<P>     "Bad Girls" aims for the adventure of "Butch Cassidy and the
Sundance Kid" without understanding the meaning of daring, music or
style.  Still, it did leave me wishing, among other things I've missed
in life, that I might just once have strapped a holster to my hips and
leapt onto a flying horse to escape my enemies.</P>
