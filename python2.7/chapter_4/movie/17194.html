KURT AND COURTNEY (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Ted Prigge</PRE>
<PRE>Copyright 1999 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<PRE>Director: Nick Broomfield</PRE>
<P>Starring: Nick Broomfield, Hank Harrison, Tom Grant, El Duce, Rozz 
Rezabak, Kurt Cobain, Courtney Love</P>
<P>Nick Broomfield seems to be in a minority when it comes to the amount of 
general interest in the subject of his newest documentary. I don't, of 
course, mean to imply that no one gives a shit about Kurt Cobain and/or 
Courtney Love and their subsequent relationship that ended in his 
suicide. I've always wondered exactly why Kurt killed himself, not being 
satisfied with the mere explanation that he hated fame. No one kills 
themself for one main reason; there are many many reasons why such 
things occur, and when this film unearths some of the possibilities of 
the reasons he killed himself, it's nothing short of interesting. For 
instance, I was fascinated when I heard from his aunt about her 
speculations on his death: that Courtney and him each wanted something 
else, that she was too controlling over him, and that she may have used 
him. It all sounds eerily like "A Star is Born" to me, and I know I'm 
not the first to point that out (thank you, Roger Ebert). And I'm not 
exactly ruling out a possible conspiracy - it's just that by now, any 
speculation about a possible murder sound goofy and too late in the 
forming. Once I too was obsessed with conspiracy theories, most notably 
revolving around one particular case inspired by the viewing of one 
particular movie many years ago that ended up shaping my initial descent 
into paranoia of all kinds (and thank you, Oliver Stone). But it's when 
this film decides at the crossroads, whether it should go to be about 
the two of them and their relationship or about possible murder theories 
implicating Courtney heavily to go for the latter that I soon tuned out.</P>
<P>And I grew more distated as the film plowed on from theory to theory, 
and trying to prove them. Broomfield, who not only made the Spalding 
Gray film "Monster in a Box" (great flick, mostly due to Gray, of 
course), but also a little documentary I watched in film class called 
"Soldier Girls" which is unbelivably interesting, abandons some of the 
wit and the observation with which he showed in those two films, and it 
becomes not really about Kurt and Courtney but about Nick Broomfield 
trying desperately to find anything smutty and/or controversial about 
Kurt and Courtney. Like a Michael Moore without screen presence or 
actual real wit, Broomfield travels the country meeting with people who 
knew them or were associated with them (and in one case, is one of 
them), in hopes of finding anything at all about them. He shoots 
interviews so that he's there in the frame, or at least in reaction 
shots during interviews. He shoots inside the car as he's traveling from 
place to place. And he comments continuously on the soundtrack about 
what's going on, what he thinks about his discoveries, and what he would 
have done with the film if Courtney Love hadn't found out he was making 
the film and pressured those who funded him (but I really wish he didn't 
have to explain that every ten minutes).</P>
<P>It's perhaps wrong that Love prevented him from exploring all the 
possibilities the subject allows, not only for ethical reasons, but 
really because the film hurts from it. Without a whole lot of funding, 
Broomfield is only allowed to explore certain things, and it turns out 
he only has the budget to talk to the cesspool of witnesses, those who 
no one would touch because they're implausible in any key testimony. 
Love's father, who wrote two books about Kurt's death and how it may 
have been a murder maybe by Courtney herself, voices his horrible 
dislike for Courtney, and in one interview shows that much of his 
ranting stems from deep emotional and psychological pain aimed at his 
daughter. Tom Grant, the detective hired by Love to find the missing 
Cobain in the last days of his life, voices how he thinks he may have 
been a coverup device, and whose sole proof of this is that Kurt was so 
high on heroin that he couldn't have held a gun (this is disproven 
shortly after, shockingly enough by Broomfield himself). An ex-lover of 
Courtney displays many of her quirks and mannerisms when it comes to 
fame, broadening our picture of her, then yells into the camera a long, 
priceless string of insults aimed at her. Weirdest of all, we see an 
underground punk rocker named El Duce, a man who looks like my 
perception of Satan, who says that he was hired by Love to kill Cobain 
but didn't do it (though he has since started haunting my dreams, it's 
nice to hear that he was later on killed when he stumbled into the path 
of a train). We meet groupies who knew them, journalists who were 
threatened by them, and best of all, Kurt's aunt who's the sanest and 
most plausible witness the film can offer.</P>
<P>Not only does "Kurt and Courtney" get nowhere on the murder rap, it too 
harshly aims scrutiny in the direction of Courtney, making a vicious but 
one-dimensional attack at her character. The bad thing about this is: 
Nick Broomfield fucking hates Courtney Love. Bad thing for a documentary 
director, since the one surefire thing that should encompass every 
documentary is that the director has an open mind. Broomfield is willing 
to explore his subject and opens the evidence he unearths to scrutiny 
(the detective thing, once again), but underneath the entire film is the 
subtext that Courtney Love is a bitch, and the entire film doesn't play 
like an unearthing of their relationship but as a way to demonstrate in 
what ways she is a horrible individual. The problem with taking a stance 
like this is that it makes it easier for audiences to take sides with 
the filmmaker, and while people may buy into Broomfield's vision of Love 
as a coldhearted, manipulative bitch, we can also see how 
one-dimensional his argument is. On one hand, Love has threatened 
journalists and made them scared for their lives...but on the other 
hand, the journalists were trying to unearth painful secrets to her, and 
to make her look horrible. When Broomfield himself gets up at a free 
speech ceremony, where Love has received an award, and makes a speech 
showing what a hypocrite she is, it's either easy to sympathize with him 
for not being able to tell his story completely, or with Love for being 
trashed so much by Broomfield. In fact, we could either symapthize with 
Broomfield for having his funds cut off (and thus buy into his beliefs), 
or we could sympathize with Love for trying to thwart the making of this 
film because if we put ourselves in her position, we wouldn't want some 
jerk journalist trying to spread bad shit about us either, would we? I 
always think a documentary should engage us and make us question an 
issue, but it should never make us question its own belief system.</P>
<P>That said, "Kurt and Courtney" is at the very least intriguing. Some of 
the issues it digs up, mostly on the relationship between the eponomys 
couple, are when the film is truly great. Other moments, when it's 
foolishly trying to prove a part of a conspiracy theory or when it's 
trying to destroy Courtney Love, or when it's lack of a budget kicks in 
(there's something about that bit where he tries to sneak into a Hole 
rehearsal with a video camera only to have the battery die when the door 
is opened that's eerily reminiscent of "This is Spinal Tap"), are when 
it's at the very least a "uh huh, whatever" experience. But when it's 
uncovering interesting aspects of the respective personalities of Kurt 
and/or Courtney and their fascinating relationship, I could almost 
ignore the frustrating usage of yellow journalism and annoying presence 
by pompous ass Nick Broomfield. Well, at least temporarily.</P>
