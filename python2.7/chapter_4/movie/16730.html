 Lethal Weapon 4 (1998) Starring Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Rene Russo, Joe
Pesci, Chris Rock and Jet Li. Directed by Richard Donner.</P>
<P> Lethal Weapon 4 is crass, vulgar, childish, ultraviolent, profane, stupid
and appealing to the lowest common denominator of movie audiences. And yet
...</P>
<P> It's hard to really hate this movie, simply because of the by-play and
chemistry of stars Mel Gibson and Danny Glover. Yea, it's the same old
shtick they've done in the other Lethal Weapon movies, but it still exudes
some magical pull that sucks you in.</P>
<P> It's like going to a strip joint. You enjoyed yourself, but feel dirty and
hope that no one saw you go in or out.</P>
<P> The plot of Lethal Weapon 4 is convoluted and really makes little sense.
The script is full of preposterous holes and dead ends. And yet ...</P>
<P> The ease with which Gibson and Glover, along with series veterans Joe
Pesci and Rene Russo, slip back so comfortably into their roles allows for
an easy familiarity that lets you ignore all the movie's shortcomings as
you just tag along for the ride.</P>
<P> The movie doesn't condescend to its audience as does, say, Armageddon.
>From the outset, Lethal Weapon 4 lets you know you're in for a fantasyland
shoot-'em-up, and any resemblance to real police work is purely
coincidental.</P>
<P> Lethal Weapon 4 really is a big, expensive game of cops and robbers played
by a bunch of overage adolescents who had several million bucks to spend.
Consider it the most expensive home movie ever made.</P>
<P> The team of producer Joel Silver and director Richard Donner know what the
audience wants - and gives them plenty of it. Lots of big bangs, car chases
and crashes, gunplay and fisticuffs, all done in such an outlandish manner
that you could probably substitute some of the critters from the Warner
Bros. animation stable and release the film with Wile E. Coyote and the
Road Runner instead of Gibson and Glover.</P>
<P> A saving grace is that no one really takes the proceedings seriously,
especially not Gibson. He mugs, chuckles, rolls his eyes and continually
lets the audience know that he's having a frolic.</P>
<P> Adding to the festivities is Chris Rock as an eager young detective who
teams up with veterans Riggs and Murtaugh to solve a case involving murder,
illegal smuggling and counterfeiting. The story, however, is secondary to
the interplay between the main protagonists.</P>
<P> The only breath of fresh air is offered by Hong Kong action star Jet Li as
the main villain, a human killing machine. Li does some impressive martial
arts moves that will have the audience gasping.</P>
<P> Lethal Weapon 4 is not art. It's not even good filmmaking. At a little
over two hours, it's a bit flabby and could have used some tighter editing.
But none of that really matters, does it?</P>
<P> It's the action - the stunts and pyrotechnics - that will lure moviegoers.
Lethal Weapon 4 does what a movie of this caliber is supposed to do. It
will take your mind off the heat, the rain, the flooding - whatever. And
that's the bottom line, isn't it? If you go in with low expectations, you
will walk out satisfied.</P>
