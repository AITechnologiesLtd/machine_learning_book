<P>         Historical epic. Dark, satirical comedy. Science fiction
parable. Costume drama. Horror.
         If one were to categorize Kubrick's films, these would likely
be the categories some of his greatest known works would fit into. While
much can gained from such a pursuit, I usually try not to categorize
films excessively, but, while viewing Kubrick's final work, it occurred
to me that this may be the one that would be most difficult to place in
a specific genre. Kubrick is an auteur and, like all great auteurs, his
work usually gains more value when viewed as part of a greater body of
work. This may sound as if it is some sort of excuse to like the film
more than I probably should, but it is not. Instead, I am merely trying
to state that Kubrick has always had a unique style and vision. His body
of work can nearly be considered as a genre unto itself-- a quality
seemingly inherent to the films of many auteurs.
         The category Eyes Wide Shut most seems to fit into at times
would be that of the psychological thriller. I often found myself
comparing the film to Carol Reed's The Third Man (1949), and, but for
the pacing, I think the parallels hold up well: A man who seems
relatively happy with his place in the world finds that the whole basis
of his security may have been faulty; he then descends into an
underworld that, while always present, he was never aware of. If one
considers the scene in which Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) witnesses the
results of Harry Limes' (Orson Welles) black market dealings in the
hospital full of bed-ridden victims as the centerpiece of The Third Man,
it really makes a nice parallel to the centerpiece orgy scene of Eyes
Wide Shut. It is this voyeuristic scene in which Cruise's character,
Bill Harford, begins to finally realize that he has entered a world he
is not prepared to deal with.
         An oddity about this scene is in the simple fact that it is a
centerpiece. Kubrick's films usually conclude with a scene that offers a
final seductive twist or irony, but the "twist" in this film seems to be
nearer the middle section. Oddly enough, considering the controversy
surrounding the sexual content of the film, this may be Kubrick's most
mainstream film yet-- even more so than Spartacus (1960). The conclusion
of EWS is so mainstream that it really changes the entirety of the film
and, in fact, because of this, perhaps one could say that it is a
characteristically "twisted" Kubrick ending.
         The strength of the film's plotting is that it simply flows...
It is much like the frequently repeated piano notes of the film's
highly-recognizable, yet somewhat simplistic, score. The film begins
somewhat lightheartedly [relatively speaking], then seems to crescendo
up to the centerpiece scene and decrescendo to the conclusion. Just as
with the most well-crafted symphonies, every moment of the dynamic
change is as intense as the next-- it is not a case of peaking
intensity, but of peaking dynamic.
         The credit for this can lie firstly with Kubrick himself. His
direction is as fluid as usual, adding just the right touch to every
moment, whether it be with camera angle or movement, mise-en-scene, or
anything else. Secondly, the film is able to rely on great performances
(apparently all those call backs for reshoots paid off). Tom Cruise may
give his best performance to date, and proves that he has come a long
way since his roles in such films as The Outsiders and Risky Business
(both 1883). He matches and compliments the intensity of the film itself
with his own intensity, often quiet. I especially liked the way he
seemed to be faking sincerity every time he would assume his role as
physician-- this may not have been intentional, but it worked. I must
say I was surprised by how little Nicole Kidman was actually in the
film, but when she was on screen, she was incredible. It may have been a
smaller role than expected, but it's the best I've ever seen her.
         Kubrick is a man of details, and that is why his films have so
often taken so long to complete. It pays off here, as it usually does.
The most prominent details are the supporting cast members. Even some of
the seemingly least important roles are filled with actors of apparently
high prowess, making the illusion of the film seem all that more real.
Beyond that, the art direction must be mentioned. The entire look of
this film is composed of details upon details. New York is so
realistically simulated in England that I often found myself thinking I
recognized certain places. A testimony to the attention paid to details:
the Village Voice newspaper dispenser below a street light in the
Greenwhich Village setting. The lighting and decoration of most of the
interiors suggests such decadence that it becomes quite believable that
you have entered another alternate reality where orgies and over-dosed
models are as ordinary as a filthy kitchen sink.
         All of this leads back to the story, as it should. Of course,
every viewer may have their own opinion (and that is one of the charms
of Kubrick), but it seemed to be the story of a man whose faith is
challenged, and, through numerous brushes with danger beyond belief, is
restored-- but not until he has confessed and received forgiveness (or
the nearest thing to it). Basically, it is a double-jointed attempt at
enforcing certain values by challenging them and, in my opinion, it is
successful.</P>
