<P>DEUCE BIGALOW: MALE GIGOLO (M).  
(Touchstone/Buena Vista International)
Director: Mike Mitchell
Stars: Rob Schneider, William Forsythe, Arija Bareikis, Eddie Griffin, 
Oded Fehr, Gail O'Grady, Jacqueline Obradors, Richard Riehle
Running time: 88 minutes.</P>
<P>Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo is the sort of crass, crude, loud
and generally unfunny low brow comedy that we have come to expect from
the current crop of Saturday Night Live stars.  Fans of the
deliberately dumb style of humour perfected by Adam Sandler will
probably get a kick out of this rather juvenile, politically incorrect
comedy.  Sandler produced this comedy, which stars his friend Rob
Schneider, who played a small role as the pizza guy in Big Daddy.</P>
<P>Schneider plays the eponymous Deuce, a rather innocent,
snivelling loser who cleans fish tanks for a living.  By chance he
finds himself minding a lavish apartment for Antoine (Oded Fehr), a
male gigolo who has gone to Switzerland on business.  Antoine keeps a
large fish tank full of rare fish, and also collects antique weapons
that are worth even more if they have actually been used to kill
someone.  But when Deuce accidentally breaks the tank and wrecks some
of Antoine's precious furniture he is forced to come up with enough
cash in a hurry to repair the damage before Antoine returns home.</P>
<P>With the help of jive talking pimp TJ (Eddie Griffin), Deuce
reluctantly becomes a "man whore."  But things do not go smoothly for
the inexperienced Deuce.  Rather than have sex with his eccentric
clientele (who are either overweight, gigantic, or suffer from
Tourette's Syndrome), Deuce helps them become happy with their own
bodies and their unique problems.  Complications arise when he begins
to fall in love with Kate (Arija Bareikis), the one legged nurse who
works in a hair donor clinic.</P>
<P>Mike Mitchell directs this nonsense with a remarkably heavy
hand and a lack of subtlety.  The performances lack any sense of
nuance whatsoever.  Most surprising of all, however, is the
unashamedly over the top performance from screen tough guy William
Forsythe (The Waterdance, etc), who plays a vice squad cop obsessed
with his sexual failures.</P>
<P>There are some wonderful sight gags, and some rather obvious
spoofs of recent movies, but there is precious little imagination at
work in the script, co-written by Schneider himself.  There is also a
preponderance of tasteless innuendo, smut and puerile toilet humour,
which may appeal to younger adolescent male audiences.  There is an
emphasis on childish slapstick humour and pratfalls, but there are
also many moments that fall flat.</P>
