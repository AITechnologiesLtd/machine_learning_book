<P>[Author's note: Before I begin this rant...</P>
<P>The astute follower of my normal 3BC reviews will note something 
different about this "review" right away: I dispensed with the normal 
credits which have always been part of my particular writing style, and 
the remainder of this text will be an all-out rant about that 
abomination masquerading as a movie, and calling itself "Supernova".  </P>
<P>For those who came here expecting a thoughtful, decent review, my 
apologies; I'll do better in the future, given better material to start 
with.  If you need a quick-n-dirty recommendation, I can sum it up in 
three simple words: "This Flick Sucked.", and direct you to read our 
other reviews for this week.  For those masochists for whom that is 
simply not enough, I give you: The Bammer Rant On The Godawful 
Abomination Masquerading As A Movie, Calling Itself "Supernova".</P>
<PRE>So don't say I didn't warn ya...]</PRE>
<P>The UnStory (no spoilers, since there was no story.)
Friends, romans, countrymen, lend me your ear: if you have even the most 
miniscule faith in my ability to judge a movie, you will run--not 
walk--run away from any movie review that suggests you go see this most 
dreadful collection of frames of moving images running swiftly together 
which would normally be called "film" but could not by any stretch of 
the imagination be honoured with such a label.</P>
<P>I have seen Bad Movies in my life.  I have seen "Lost In Space".  I have 
seen "A Night At The Roxbury".  I have seen "Caligula".  But nothing - 
y'all don't hear me; I'll say it once again: N O T H I N G - I have seen 
in my 37 years on this third rock from the sun, could possibly compare 
to the hour and a half of torture I endured watching the collection of 
frames of moving images that I won't dare name again, lest I suffer more 
seizures.</P>
<P>If the above does not convince you, consider this: the collection of 
frames of moving images was so ashamed of itself, it did not have 
opening titles or credits at all; if one was so inclined to ride out the 
length of the collection of frames of moving images (and more than half 
of the people in the theater during this showing, were not so inclined), 
one would have to wait until the end to know what the title was.  That 
might not be enough to convince you--after all, it could've just been 
Clever! And! Hip!  It wasn't, but it could've been trying to be, so 
consider this also: the collection of frames of moving images, stopped 
working during the final scene.  None of us in the audience, cared.  
Even when it started working again, none of us cared.  Many of us left, 
well before the break.  And when the torture was finally over and we all 
filed out of the theater with blood in our eyes and hatred in our hearts 
for the normally-decent James Spader, Angela Bassett, and Lou Diamond 
Phillips for the exercise in mental masturbation they performed on the 
screen, theater ushers greeted us at the door with free passes, 
apologizing profusely for the break.  I like to think that they were led 
by a Higher Power to apologize profusely for the excrement that made its 
way to the screen.</P>
<P>Please. Don't. Go. To. This...Thing.  And if you ignore me and do go, 
please let me know, so I can laugh heartily as you writhe in misery.</P>
<P>[End note to those review purists who'll no doubt wish to chastise me 
for wasting your time with this rant: save it.  I warned you at the 
beginning, and you read on anyway?  Your bad.] </P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line: 
This Flick Sucked.  It sucked the lifeforce right out of me; so much so 
that I was unable to stay in the theater to watch "Girl, Interrupted" 
afterwards, as I had planned on doing.  I had to run quickly out of the 
theater house before I stumbled upon the Projectionists Room; I had 
matches, and I knew how to use them.</P>
<P>May it die the quick boxoffice death it so richly deserves.</P>
