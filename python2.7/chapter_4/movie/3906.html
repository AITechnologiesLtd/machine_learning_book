<PRE>                                 VIRTUOSITY
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     In the not so distant future (1999 A.D.), Virtual Reality has
progressed to the point where the Virtual part isn't so clear.  With
the help of nanotechnology (read: really small) machines, VR
simulations can take on a physical form composed of millions of these
teeny robots.  When a semi-crazed engineer decides to bring his
ultimate bad guy VR program to life, he sneaks the chip into some of
this robotic glop.  Thus, Sid 6.7 is born.</P>
<P>     Sid (Russell Crowe) is version number 6.7 of a compilation of 183
personalities: mass murderers, serial killers, and Hitler-types.  The
ultimate villain, Sid is imbued with the ability to regenerate damage
at the touch of glass (silicon), almost superhuman powers, and the
cunning and mental imbalance of history's worst killers.  And who would
have thought ... when you let Sid out of the lab, Sid wants to kill.
Preferably on national television.</P>
<P>     Enter Parker Barnes (Denzel Washington), ex-cop sent up the river
for the accidental slaying of two people.  Turns out that Barnes is the
only one who has a chance of stopping Sid (see also, DEMOLITION MAN),
so out of the lock-up he comes.  Partnered with him is criminologist
Madison Carter (Kelly Lynch), who holds her own as the first lead
female I've seen in ages who *doesn't* get romantically entangled with
the hero.</P>
<P>     Full of wicked, cutting-edge special effects, VIRTUOSITY makes a
strong entry into a summer of lifeless films.  It takes a while to get
rolling, and the early character development is weak, but pretty soon,
everyone's caught up in this innovative take on the cat and mouse
game.  I won't spoil the twists, but the dynamic between Sid and Barnes
is quite interesting to watch.  Crowe, as Sid, is the real star,
playing the megalomaniacal killer with perfect poise and egocentrism,
eerily reminiscent of Malcolm McDowell's Alex from A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.
The only complaint I have is that with 183 professional killers inside
him, you'd think he'd be a better shot with a pistol.</P>
<P>     VIRTUOSITY has its flaws, though.  The main problem is that the
premise of Reality vs. Fantasy isn't taken as far as it could have been
(TOTAL RECALL was the last good example of this).  The filmmakers have
made it very clear which world we're in at all times, mainly because
they're really, really busy showing off what their visual effects guys
can do (expect an Oscar nomination).  Supporting cast is also boring
(even Academy Award winner Louise Fletcher (ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S
NEST) is wasted).</P>
<P>     Director Brett Leonard, who just came off the dismal HIDEAWAY, has
thankfully redeemed himself here.  Maybe the best recommendation I can
give is that VIRTUOSITY is still on my mind as I replay the intriguing
parts, and that's all too rare in Hollywood these days.</P>
