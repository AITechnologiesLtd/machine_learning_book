<P>     SENSELESS is a completely generic comedy that is only occasionally 
enlivened by the on-screen antics of Marlon Wayans.  Yet, while Wayans 
has the energy and malleable features to match those of Jim Carrey (whom 
he appears to be impersonating), he isn't endowed with quite as forceful 
a screen presence.  Of course, it doesn't help that he isn't given much 
to work with.  The screenplay is dumb, and director Penelope Spheeris, 
who has ridden her WAYNE'S WORLD success through a series of mediocre 
movies, can't seem to find a stable tone.  She seems to be striving for 
something more sophisticated than mere physical comedy, but her attempts 
never reach fruition.  In fact, there are isolated instances when 
SENSELESS almost seems grim.</P>
<P>     The screenplay does nothing with a potentially-interesting premise.  
Darryl Witherspoon (Wayans) is one of the hardest working men on the 
Stratford University campus.  Because he sends money home to support his 
mother and siblings, he has to work about three different jobs to make 
ends meet.  So, when the medical department advertises for human guinea 
pigs to test out their latest serum -- a wonder drug that magnifies the 
effectiveness of all five senses -- Darryl is first in line to collect 
the $3000 offered for being a subject.  But, although Darryl's first 
reactions to "Protocol 563" are negative (extreme itching, being 
bothered by seemingly-unobtrusive sounds, etc.), he soon begins to reap 
the benefits of having enhanced senses.  He turns into a leading 
candidate for a position at the Smythe Bates corporation, becomes the 
protégé of one of Smythe Bates' top men, Randall Tyson (Rip Torn), is 
transformed into a hockey star, and starts a romantic relationship with 
a fellow student, Janice (Tamara Taylor).  All of this doesn't sit well 
with Darryl's chief detractor, Scott Butler (David Spade), who is 
determined to do anything to undermine his rival's success.</P>
<P>     For the most part, SENSELESS falls into the category of "underdog 
makes good."  The autopilot script follows a well-known trajectory:  
someone gains confidence in himself because of an outside agent, then, 
once that agent has been removed, finds that his true strength comes 
from within.  In a case like this, when there's not much to be found in 
how the plot is structured, the movie's success depends on whether it 
offers enough laughs to camouflage its deficiencies.  Unfortunately, 
while SENSELESS can boast a few funny sequences, they're too few and far 
apart to allow me to describe this film as anything better than mundane.  </P>
<P>     Marlon Wayans' performance is uneven.  On some occasions, such as 
when he's running around buck naked on a city street, he is hilarious, 
but there are times when he's more bland than funny.  And the sporadic 
attempts to copy Jim Carrey didn't do anything for me.  Surprisingly, 
Wayans is perhaps most effective when working through the romantic 
subplot.  He and Tamara Taylor develop a nice rapport that isn't 
completely reliant upon sexual tension.  David Spade, despite being 
given second billing, is pretty much a nonentity.  Aside from an 
occasional low key put-down, Spade doesn't have much to do -- as a 
villain, he's decidedly unimpressive.  Supporting performers include 
SCREAM's Matthew Lillard as Darryl's excessively-pierced roommate and 
Brad Dourif as the doctor in charge of the Protocol 563 experiment.  </P>
<P>     There's really not a lot more to say about this film.  While the 
amusement level isn't high, the familiarity level is, but at least the 
movie is short enough that boredom never sets in.  Those who prefer not 
to be challenged by motion pictures, and who are willing to endure the 
same regurgitated material time-after-time, may enjoy SENSELESS.  For 
everyone else, the handful of good jokes aren't enough to justify ninety 
minutes in a theater.  </P>
