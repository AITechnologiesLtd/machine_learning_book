<PRE>                                PHILADELPHIA
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  This film has a muddled job of
     directing and a muddled script.  One often has the feeling
     that Demme is trying to say something that isn't quite coming
     across.  The subject of AIDS is brought down to a shallow
     courtroom melodrama.  This film has little to offer beyond
     Hanks' performance.  Wait for AND THE BAND PLAYED ON to come
     to video.  Rating: 0 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Andrew Beckett (played by Tom Hanks) is a successful lawyer for a
prestigious Philadelphia law firm.  He is clearly something of a hotshot
whom his firm has working for lucrative clients.  He also is gay and
discovers that he has AIDS.  When the first visible signs of his disease
appear he is fired over an alleged incident of incompetence.  He decides to
sue his former firm for wrongful dismissal.  The only lawyer he can get is a
flashy ambulance-chaser who is also an anti-gay bigot, Joe Miller, played by
Denzel Washington.  These two little-guys take on the big-guy law firm and
the result is the predictable courtroom battle which becomes a major media
event.  Beckett and Miller must slug it out with the legal giant in a
courtroom battle that Beckett may not live to see resolved.</P>
<P>     While the story is only too straightforward, the telling is not.  The
script by Ron Nyswaner has the feel of a stage play adapted to the screen
without sufficient consideration for the differences in the medium.  The
story will jump forward six weeks and then jump to a flashback to show
events that took place in that time.  At one point the evil law firm seems
to have dug up information that only Hanks and one of his lovers would have
known, but there is no explanation of how they know what they know.  Yet
with such a good case they make damaging admissions on the witness stand
without any thought of the reaction.</P>
<P>     There are major dramatic scenes that we would expect to see but which
are omitted.  We never see Beckett's immediate reaction to being told he has
AIDS, yet Demme takes screen time to give us an extended montage of street
scenes of Philadelphia and a helicopter ride around the rooftop statue of
William Penn.  Equally out of place is Hanks' extended and melodramatic
description of the beautiful aria "La Mamma Morta" from the third act of
Catalani's ANDREA CHENIER.  It is shot from odd angles at Hanks--Demme seems
to use a lot of strange camera angles in this film, bathed melodramatically
in red light from an unknown source.  Apparently Director Jonathan Demme
needed show Beckett was a man of deep passion while at the same time not
risking showing on the screen Beckett's passion for his lover Miguel, played
by Antonio Banderas.  In fact, there is virtually nothing in the film about
Beckett's private gay life, though we get to see a lot of his biological
family and the love and support he gets from his mother, played by Joanne
Woodward.</P>
<P>     Tom Hanks will probably be considered at Oscar time, though his
performance owes a good deal to his makeup artist.  Still his performance
was at least decent.  Neither Jason Robards, as the head of the law firm,
nor Denzel Washington seemed to be bringing much to their roles to
distinguish this performance from any of their others.  Joanne Woodward is
given about four scenes and may well be present only to lend her moral
support to the production.</P>
<P>     I suppose that Demme should be lauded for making a major Hollywood film
on the subject of AIDS, but PHILADELPHIA pales beside LONGTIME COMPANION and
this year's AND THE BAND PLAYED ON.  The best of intentions clearly went at
least somewhat awry.  My rating would be a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
