<PRE>                           A MAP OF THE WORLD
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     What AMERICAN BEAUTY did for the suburbs, A MAP OF THE WORLD aims
to do for the farm life.</P>
<P>     I said "aims," of course.  A MAP OF THE WORLD is deeply flawed yet
still worth a look, especially if you're into grandiose, weepy,
self-important dramas.  And hey, who isn't?</P>
<P>     Obviously based on an Oprah-class novel, WORLD is the story of
Alice Goodwin (Weaver), a put-upon school nurse who lives on a Wisconsin
farm as part of an "experiment" by her rather oblivious husband Howard
(Straitharn).  Right with the voice over at the film's beginning, it's
clear that Alice is going to have some Bad Times ahead, and within 20
minutes, said Times are upon us.</P>
<P>     Alice is so frazzled she can't even keep an eye on the neighbors'
precious daughter, who wanders off about 200 yards to the pond and
promptly drowns.  Hair tearing and chest beating ensues, and Alice's
mindset only gets worse.  Then the kicker: A real bitch of a woman
(Sevigny) accuses Alice of abusing her son, a student at the school
where Alice works.  Go to jail, Alice.  Courtroom drama follows.</P>
<P>     As a story, WORLD is all over the map (no pun intended) -- from
marital troubles between Alice and Howard to in-law problems (Fletcher
playing Howard's doting mother) to legal mumbo-jumbo to a bizarre and
out of place stretch with Alice doing time in jail during her trial.
The whole notion of jail as a metaphor for Alice's mental healing (you
know, a personal prison for dealing with her anguish over the death of
the neighbor child?) is unbelievably over-the-top and just comes off as
phony.</P>
<P>     In fact, very little of this holds together as a narrative, and at
127 minutes, so much of this is extraneous padding that the film
positively crawls.  Even worse is Weaver's character (not necessarily
Weaver herself, mind you).  Alice is so selfish, melodramatic, and just
plain dumb that the character hurts the film.  Contrary to speculation,
there will be no Oscar nod for Weaver this year.</P>
<P>     Still, there's something to like.  Most notable is Julianne Moore
as the too-perfect neighbor whose daughter dies.  Her character grows
more than the rest of the cast combined, and her heartfelt performance
makes up for a lot of the rest of this WORLD.  Still, the film can't
ride on her surprisingly small role alone, so unless this all sounds
like your idea of a great way to spend an evening, you'll probably want
to pass.</P>
