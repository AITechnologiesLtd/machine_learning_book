<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A routine Western from the 1950s that is distinguished by the presence
of Joel McCrea as John Cord, a trail boss who seeks revenge against a
town called Hamilton for falsely imprisoning him. In real life, McCrea
was a cowboy, a rich one who owned a thousand acre working ranch, which
he helped run. He was one of the most natural riding cowboys to hit the
silver screen, reminding many of the old legends Tom Mix and William S.
Hart. The other distinguished party in this revenge oater, is Daniel B.
Ullman, a noted "B" Western script specialist, whose unique stories were
used in a multitude of Westerns in that era.</P>
<P>The film opens, with the just released from prison, after serving 5-
years, John Cord, being dragged by rope across town. He is nearly dead
when on a buckboard, the blind Ralph Hamilton (Haggerty), his pretty
blonde wife Janice (Coates ), and Ralph's younger brother, Douglas
(Bing), arrive and Ralph insists on the men letting Cord go. The
townsmen want to drag Cord to his death, saying he should have never
shown his face in town again after what he did. They blamed him for
turning his drunken cowhands loose on the town after a cattle drive and
many of the locals losing their lives, with many others injured,
including Ralph, who was blinded by Cord in a fight. But Ralph insists
that Cord served his time and that the men should let him go, besides,
it was he who called for Cord to come to town to see him.</P>
<P>When Cord is back in Ralph's ranch, it is learned that Ralph's wife
married him after Cord was imprisoned, but before that she was Cord's
girlfriend. Ralph called for Cord because he desperately needs him to
drive the herd of over 4,000 cattle over a difficult territory and get
it to Fort Clemson where the army will buy it at a good price. He needs
Cord because he is the only one who could do it and get there before
Garth (Shannon) does. Garth is Ralph's former partner, who robbed the
wealthy man the town is named after, and is in position if he gets his
herd there first to surplant Ralph as the wealthiest rancher. Ralph says
Douglas is still too green to do it himself and besides, for Cord,
"Trail driving is like breathing."</P>
<P>Cord has revenge on his mind, as he tells Ralph he will lead the herd if
he can get the men in town who dragged him by rope to be part of the
cattle drive. Cord also goes to see Garth and tells him he will work for
him and will give him a three day start, and then he will lead the
cattle drive across to the Dismal River, which is as dry as a bone and
will kill off all the cattle. Cord plans to get his revenge on all these
men who wronged him.</P>
<P>The only loyal friends Cord has on the drive are Tom Jefferson Jeffrey
(Paul Brinegar) and George Washington Jeffrey (Hal K. Dawson), two
ornery old time cowhands who trust him implicitly. They also bring along
on the drive their attractive cousin Sandy (Talbott), who has a
schoolgirl's crush on the older man ever since she was a youngster.</P>
<P>When push comes to shove, Cord can't kill off the cattle, as he
instinctively wants to do a good job, which is what Ralph was banking
on. When Cord tells Garth of his change of mind and that he will now
take the cattle to where there is water, at Horse Thief Creek, Garth
doesn't believe him and decides to take his cattle to Dismal River.</P>
<P>On this arduous drive, Ralph confesses how he and Garth set Cord up,
that Cord never lets his men loose on a town, that he always keeps
whiskey on hand so that his men won't go stir crazy after a few months
on the trail, and that it was his men who ravaged the town not Cord's.
He said that he let Cord go to jail because he was feeling bitter about
going blind after the fight he had with Cord.</P>
<P>There is a classical shoot-out with Garth's men and some romantic
business to take care of, as Cord has both Janice and Sandy wanting to
run off with him, plus Ralph offers him a full partnership, no matter
what he does. But in the tradition of the lone cowboy, too pure for this
impure world, Cord rides off alone into the sunset, having made his
peace with everyone. ... If you want to see a Western, one like they
don't make anymore, this is as good a representative as most.</P>
