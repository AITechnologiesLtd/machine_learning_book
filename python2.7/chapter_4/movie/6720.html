<PRE>                               JOHNS
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     "I am not a prostitute," says young prostitute Donner, played with
naivete and sensitivity by Lukas Haas (WITNESS).  "I am an entertainer.
I do not go in for violence."  Life on the street is tough and weird.
Today's "date" is an eighty-year-old pervert who gets off by spanking
boys.</P>
<P>     JOHNS is a frequently shocking, intensely real, and always
poignant look at the lives of young hustlers.  First time director and
writer Scott Silver makes many of the mistakes of newcomers but,
nevertheless, shows much promise with his troubling, touching, and
sometimes humorous view of homeless kids.</P>
<P>     Silver's background is as a documentarian, and it shows.  In the
press kit he says he got the idea during his first Christmas in
Hollywood where the temperature was in the 90s, and "I felt utter
desolation, despair, and depression."  His approach to developing the
story for the movie was to interview young hustlers, paying them $20
each to hear their stories.  From these ideas, acknowledged in the
credits, he derived the script.</P>
<P>     JOHNS happens on the day before Christmas.  John, played quite
believably by David Arquette (SCREAM), is sleeping in the park when his
expensive, lucky shoes and his money in them are stolen.  The camera
focuses in tight for close-ups as his long dirty feet go running in
vain after the thief.  John gets some golf shoes with cleats from his
first trick of the day, Danny Cohen, played by John C. McGinley (from
THE ROCK).  John clanks along with these golf shoes through the rest of
the picture.</P>
<P>     Tomorrow is John's 21st birthday, and he has long had plans to
stay one night on vacation at the fancy Park Plaza Hotel.  Now he is
broke.  But it gets worse.  Because he took money during a drug deal
gone bad, Jimmy Warlock (Terence Dashon Howard) is looking for him to
collect the money -- one way or another.</P>
<P>     Donner is John's happy-go-lucky friend.  Donner has the innocence
of someone new to the street.  His parents disowned him because he was
gay, and now he is picking up tricks to make ends meet.  Although there
are some similarities to MIDNIGHT COWBOY, John and Donner are much more
clean-cut looking.</P>
<P>     Although I did laugh a few times, mainly I felt sorry for these
two kids.  The best parts of the show are the musical interludes where
they go about their everyday business while some dreamy tune is
playing.  The songs have all the happiness that the prostitutes lack.</P>
<P>     The supporting cast is strong, except for Alanna Ubach (from the
delightful DENISE CALLS UP) who plays John's girlfriend.  Ubach's
performance is unbelievably strident.</P>
<P>     Arguably the best performance is by an actor in the minuscule role
of hotel registration desk clerk Paul Truman.  Richard Kind takes what
has all of the markings of being the most cliched part in the film and
gives Paul great warmth and compassion.  I cannot say more or I would
give away some of the most precious moments in the film, and poor John
needs his few good times to preserve his dignity.</P>
<P>     Much is wrong and infuriating with JOHNS.  The cinematography has
an intentional low budget look in the constant outdoor scenes.  The
background is so overexposed that you feel like you will be blinded.
Although the film has a good narrative drive, it is too predictable.
The ending seems obvious from the start.  Nevertheless, the characters
are sympathetically drawn so that every time their predictable
tragedies arise, they touch your heart.</P>
<P>     JOHNS runs a fast 1:36.  It is rated R.  There is explicit sex,
drug usage, strong profanity, sadomasochism, violence, and quite adult
themes.  I do not think they show is for kids, even teenagers, but if
teenagers do go, they need to be quite mature.  I give the film a
thumbs up and ** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
