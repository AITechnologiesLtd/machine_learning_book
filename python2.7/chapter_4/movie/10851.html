                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                    2 :-) :-)  for the selfish giant</PRE>
<P>Directed by Brian Gilbert Cast Stephen Fry Jude Law Vanessa Redgrave
Jennifer Ehle Gemma Jones Judy Parfitt Michael Sheen Zoë Wanamaker Tom
Wilkinson (I) Written by Richard Ellmann Julian Mitchell</P>
<P>There is so much that can be said about a man who was so talented, that
he almost thought that he could have it all. This great play-write of
the late nineteenth century was undeniably one of the most charming men
to have graced the British Empire with his witty discourse and
intelligent writing. Yet somehow his downfall came not so much because
he was gay, but because he was selfish.</P>
<P>So why hasn't this movie been released in the US yet? Well I hear it has
to do something with the revealing homosexual scenes and the censorship
board. For main stream cinema this is not your average smooch between
Tom Selleck and Kevin Kline from IN AND OUT. These guys, Stephen Fry,
Jude Law etc etc really know how to kiss. I'm talking lips, tongues,
close ups you can tell they're all out, no holding back. This is not
surprising considering Stephen Fry (BLACK ADDER) has had plenty of
practice in real life prior to this excursion into male bonding. Not to
mention the numerous ‘pretty boys' recruited to fill Oscar Wilde's bed
get to cuddle him, sit on top of him, get behind him, play with each
other in front of him. There are no close ups of any erections
travelling the ways of in and out holes, but enough to give a gay man a
hard on throughout the movie – so I hear. This is after all an art house
movie and the director would not in any way want his film mistakenly
labelled as pornographic.</P>
<P>So the main characters are superb in this movie. The very talented
Stephen Fry plays Wilde as naturally as he is gay and portrays the man
with great humanity and dignity. Jude Law's temperamental impersonation
of ‘Bosey' is also memorable, but I fear the pretty lad may end up with
a price tag label wording ‘Hire me if you need a toy boy who isn't
afraid to show butt and kiss arse.' Vanessa Redgrave puts on a very
liberal performance as the unconventional Irish mother who brought the
genius into the world, and also worth mentioning is the darling Jennifer
Ehle from TV's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, as the silent suffering wife.</P>
<P>An end quote from Wilde, ‘One must do as one's nature dictates' is a
seriously flawed argument. He has overlooked factors like responsibility
and sacrifice. There are many things in life that we may want to do, but
we do not carry out these actions because the consequences are too far
reaching for all concerned. This statement is not in reference to being
gay or not being gay, but applies to everyone. Sometimes we must say NO
to the thing our very nature dictates. It has nothing to do with
sexuality, but to do with responsibility. Oscar Wilde had the
responsibility of a father and husband to fulfil. This became an
obligation when he allowed his passions to become unchecked. People will
argue that Bosey destroyed Wilde with his wanton desires, but really the
man was his own undoing when he travelled down the path of pure self
gratification with little thought of whom he hurt in due course. I think
Wilde knew that in the end his nature and poor choices destroyed the
people that mattered most, his wife and children. Perhaps if he were
never married Wilde would not appear the selfish giant he was, but the
martyr he tried to be.</P>
