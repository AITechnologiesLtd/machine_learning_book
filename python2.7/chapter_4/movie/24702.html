<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>The League of Gentlemen is a fine example of old-fashioned English
humor: droll and civil. Jack Hawkins is the brusque, control-freak,
ex-British army colonel during WW11 who has read the American novel The
Golden Fleece, which gives him the bright idea that he can rob a bank
with some ex-military personnel as experts. He is embittered that he was
forced out of the service after twenty-five years. He thereby plans this
spiteful caper, as he carefully chooses a seven-man team of similarly
discontented military men, but unlike him, those with checkered criminal
pasts in the service who were cashiered out. He gets them to a meeting
where he treats them to an expensive lunch and tells them his plans to
rob a bank for a million dollars; they are then told that they will all
have equal shares.</P>
<P>The film's strong suit is watching the precision planning that goes into
the operation as it unfolds and how all these older blokes exhibit their
odd personalties to mesh into a team-operation replete with proper
military decorum. Because of their untenable civilian situations, all
seven show why it is likely they would participate in this operation.</P>
<P>Nigel Patrick is the ex-major, always a schemer, involved in black
market activities in Berlin but also proud to be known as a survivor of
Dunkirk. He has fallen on hard times and has lost all his money in a
card game. He takes over as second-in-command for this caper. Roger
Livesey got bounced from the service for indecent exposure and has now
made a career of disguising himself as a religious man, his latest being
as a padre. Richard Attenborough is an expert radio operator who now
rigs slot machines for the casino owners. He was kicked out of the
military because he sold secrets to the Russians for the money not
because he shared their ideals. Norman Bird is an explosive expert who
got drunk on his watch and four men under him died because of his
negligence in a bomb-disposal operation. He is unhappily shown as a
henpecked husband in civilian life. Kieron Moore is an ex-fascist who
joined the army but was the odd man out in a criminal investigation and
is having money problems currently working as a masseur. Bryan Forbes
lives off middle-aged women and is finding his current life unbearably
confusing. Terence Alexander is a pianist who has not fared well in
peacetime England.</P>
<P>It is determined by Hawkins that they need military supplies for their
caper, so they impersonate high-ranking army officers and pull a
surprise inspection on an army base, while some of them cut the radio
wires and show up to do repairs but instead steal gas masks and other
supplies they need for their job. They cleverly speak with Irish accents
so that the IRA gets blamed.</P>
<P>The methodical job is pulled off with success, as in the midst of tear
gas they explode the criminals don their gas masks and walk off with the
loot. As they meet in Hawkins' house to divide the loot and celebrate
their good fortunes, a surprise ending takes place.</P>
<P>A very watchable caper movie, but with a decided British edge to it
which might inhibit some American viewers from enjoying it as much. The
lovable rogue characters give the film a spirited uplift, with Hawkins,
Patrick, Livesey, and Attenborough being particularly good in their
portrayals. What the film lacks is any kind of intensity, it's all
comedy and manners.</P>
