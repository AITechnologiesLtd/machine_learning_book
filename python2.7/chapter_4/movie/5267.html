                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  ***1/2  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1988)</PRE>
<P>     Imagine moving to a new town and assuming a new identity every year
because you are on the run from the F.B.I. for a crime you did not commit.
Now imagine having these problems at 17, that difficult age of college
applications, first love, and transition from adolescence to adulthood.  In
director Sidney Lumet's RUNNING ON EMPTY, River Phoenix finds himself in
just this predicament.</P>
<P>     His parents are Arthur and Annie Pope, left wing radicals who blew
up a napalm factory in 1971 as part of the war protest; the explosion
blinded and paralyzed a janitor who was not scheduled to be in the building
at the time.  To avoid imprisonment, the Popes went underground with their
then two year old son and cut off all ties to family and friends.  RUNNING
ON EMPTY is set 15 years later; their son, played by Phoenix, is now a high
school senior who has lived underground for as long as he can remember.</P>
<P>     RUNNING ON EMPTY opens with the Pope family fleeing from their
current home because the FBI is on the verge of discovering their
whereabouts.  The Popes assume new identities and move to a new town.  As
they settle in, Phoenix's character is the focal point of the story.  The
music teacher at the local high school takes interest in Phoenix's piano
playing and encourages him to apply to Julliard.  In the mean time, Phoenix
falls in love with, and bares his soul to, his teacher's daughter--a
rebellious free spirit played by Martha Plimpton.</P>
<P>     RUNNING ON EMPTY examines the conflict that arises when the time
comes for the Pope family to move on once again.  Phoenix does not want to
leave his family, but staying with them means separating from Plimpton and
abandoning his plans to attend college and study music.  On the other hand,
if Phoenix does leave his family, he may never see them again.  Phoenix's
father, played by Judd Hirsch, opposes his college plans.  Arthur Pope is a
stubborn man deeply committed to his family, which he views as an
inseparable unit; he cringes at the idea of it breaking apart.  In
contrast, Phoenix's mother, Annie, sees gross injustice in making Phoenix
give up his future for the crime she and Arthur committed.  One of the most
underrated actresses in the business, Christine Lahti--who was last seen in
the unjustly neglected HOUSEKEEPING--plays Annie Pope.</P>
<P>     Lumet's portrayal of the Pope family packs a powerful emotional
punch.  In fact, I recommend bringing a large supply of Kleenex since
RUNNING ON EMPTY is likely to bring you to tears several times.  For
example, the scene of Lahti visiting her father for the first time since
going underground is excruciatingly painful to watch.  Under Lumet's
sensitive direction, Lahti, Hirsch, Plimpton, and the rest of the cast give
first-rate performances, but RUNNING ON EMPTY really belongs to Phoenix.
As the conflicted young pianist, Phoenix is riveting in an Oscar-calibre
performance.  It's hard to believe that this is the same actor who just two
years ago played one of the young boys in STAND BY ME.  With his
performance in RUNNING ON EMPTY, Phoenix has successfully bridged the
transition from child acting to adult roles.  This heartbreaking drama is
one of the year's best films.</P>
