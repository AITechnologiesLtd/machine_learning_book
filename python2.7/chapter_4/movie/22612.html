<PRE>Review by Donlee Brussel</PRE>
<P>In the grand tradition of Tyler Durden and Frank T.J. Mackie, I give
you the ultimate penis power spokesperson of the new millenium, Oliver
Stone. Men's Journal calls him "the premier macho filmmaker of modern
times." He's the main man behind the football movie to end all football
movies, "Any Given Sunday."</P>
<P>What is it about football that intrigues America more than any other
sport? Why of all sports do more than 100 million people watch
football? Maybe because wrestling is faker than cubic zirconians,
baseball's only exciting when you're drunk, hockey is Canadian and
boxing doesn't allow ten guys to pile on top of opponents while their
face is in the ground holding a football for dear life because if they
don't keep the ball in their hands by the time the cameras or the ref
comes, that $10 million dollar contract they just signed is void. With
Oliver Stone, we know we will get one of the best sports films of the
90s as well as his name brand "cinematic masturbation" as my colleague
James Berardinelli puts it.</P>
<P>"Fight Club is not football on television. You aren't watching a bunch
of guys you don't know beating on each other halfway around the world
via satellite with a two minute delay, commercials pitching beer every
three minutes and applause now and then for station identification.
After Fight Club, watching football on television was like watching
pornography when you could be having great sex."</P>
<P>Today, Stone feels that the game is endangered: "I was talking to Jim
Brown about it, and he says TV money has had a pervasive influence.
Commercials interrupt the game's momentum. They have taken a one-hour
game that was beautiful and original and turned it into a three-hour
exercise in American style. It wrecks the concentration of the players."</P>
<P>Welcome to the playing field of "Any Given Sunday." Included in Stone's
all-star line-up is Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino), an over the hill
traditional coach; Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz),his ball-busting
team owner; Jack "Cap" Rooney (Dennis Quaid), the fallen legend
quarterback; Willie Beaman (Jamie Foxx), his arrogant young
replacement; Julian Washington (LL Cool J), the millionaire star
running back; and Harvey Mandrake (James Woods), the mercenary team
doctor. Here for support are Montezuma Monroe (Jim Brown), the
defensive coordinator; Luther 'Shark' Lavay (Lawrence Taylor), a
blocker; and Jimmy Sanderson (Bill Bellamy), the wide receiver.</P>
<P>They're all a part of the Miami Sharks family, and what a happy family
they are! These guys are involved in the most family friendly things:
drugs, greed, ageism, blackmail, racism, sexism, medical malpractice
and my favorite, prostitution. Yes, we all know Stone has been
directing subtle G rated family films like this for a long time. This
one is especially noble because of a full frontal shot of a black
football player that puts Marky Mark's prosthetic to shame.</P>
<P>"Any Given Sunday" also has the honor of being the most stylish MTV
music video ever. Oliver uses just about every visual effect known to
man while wigger music from DMX, Mystikal and Trick Daddy plays in the
background along with "original" music composed by Casio keyboard demo
user extraordinaire, Swizz Beatz. Also on the soundtrack are headbanger
favorites from Kid Rock and Hole. Stone probably has the best team of
editors working today because there is not a single dull moment in this
film. From minute one Oliver throws us right onto the field, right into
the game and never lets us off. Sadly, this is a prime example of a
style over substance film.</P>
<P>Dialogue in this film sparkles with poignancy and the acting is strong.
Al Pacino is at his intense best and Jamie Foxx provides a biting
dramatic breakout performance. So where did "Sunday" go wrong? What
happened? Clichés happened. Every sports film cliché is here. There's
the torch handing between the seasoned veteran and the rookie
phenomenon. There's the Big Speech before the Big Game which ends with
the Big Play where we see the Big Clock letting us know that the player
only has fill in the blank seconds left to make the Big Score during
which, a Robin Williams-type score plays in the background. Worst of
all, "Any Given Sunday" has a scene where it completely rips off "Jerry
Maguire."</P>
<P>Do I recommend seeing "Any Given Sunday" despite the flaws? You betcha.
It's the most realistic football film you'll ever see because all the
hits are real, all the plays are real. "Sunday" is the closest you will
ever get to the field without really being there.</P>
