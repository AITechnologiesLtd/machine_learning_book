<P>     Here's a pop quiz:  Can you name three things to do to make the 
time pass more quickly while you're trapped in a theater showing YEAR OF 
THE HORSE?</P>
<PRE>1.  Count to 10,000.
2.  Take a nice, long nap.
3.  Get up and walk out.</PRE>
<P>     Of course, the best course of action would be not to get caught in 
this position in the first place.  Unless you're a Neil Young die-hard, 
you're likely to find YEAR OF THE HORSE unbearable.  At the screening I 
attended, there were more walkouts than I have ever before witnessed at 
any movie (including such controversial titles as IN THE REALM OF THE 
SENSES, CLEAN SHAVEN, and KISSED), and for good reason:  this is quite 
possibly the worst documentary I have ever had the displeasure of 
watching on the big screen.</P>
<P>     Director Jim Jarmusch, the highly-regarded, maverick independent 
film maker (who is responsible for a number of intriguing films, 
including MYSTERY TRAIN and DEAD MAN) has intended YEAR OF THE HORSE as 
a loving tribute to one of his favorite bands, Neil Young & Crazy Horse.  
It's supposed to be a high-energy concert film that captures the 
intensity and camaraderie of the band members on and off-stage.  What it 
turns out to be, however, is an overlong home movie with bad video and 
barely-adequate sound.  YEAR OF THE HORSE falls into a rut very early, 
using a simple pattern that is regurgitated over and over again 
throughout the interminable 107-minute length:  interviews from 1996, 
clips from 1976 and 1986, the band performing a song in front of a live 
audience, then back to the beginning.  This recipe is repeated eight 
times.</P>
<P>     The interviews, which comprise roughly one-quarter of the film's 
running time, are among the most trite and unenlightening that I've ever 
heard.  Jarmusch asks soft, dull questions and receives banal answers.  
About the only thing I learned during these segments is that Neil 
Young's jacket says just "Crazy Horse" on it (rather than "Neil Young & 
Crazy Horse").  The behind-the-scenes footage that Jarmusch cannibalizes 
from the 1976 and 1986 tours is no more interesting.  The supposed 
reason to see YEAR OF THE HORSE, however, isn't to listen to Young, 
Molina, Sampedro, and Talbot babble, but to watch them perform.  Sadly, 
the concert footage isn't any more invigorating than the interview 
material.  While extended jams can be enjoyable in person, where the 
audience forges a rapport with the band, they make for terrible 
cinematic material, and, coupled with Jarmusch's shaky, muddy 
photography (accomplished primarily with a hand-held Super 8 camera), 
they become lifeless, tedious exercises in chord repetition.  Three-
minute songs are dragged out into 10-minute torture sessions.</P>
<P>     Unless you worship at the altar of Neil Young, I urge you to avoid 
this film.  Every year, I typically experience one or two movies that I 
find physically painful to sit through. YEAR OF THE HORSE is such a 
film.  What's especially shocking is that it comes from a talented 
director like Jarmusch, who is known for intelligent, thought-provoking 
pictures.  Evidently, his feature film making ability doesn't translate 
into the documentary realm.  YEAR OF THE HORSE is one of 1997's ugliest 
dogs.</P>
