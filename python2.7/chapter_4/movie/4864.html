<PRE>                                 TWO MUCH
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     This should have been called "Too Long."  Not only was the
two-hours film boring but it was entirely derivative and predictable.
Everything that you have ever seen in a comedy film (good or bad) was
thrown into this mess. When you see the comic hero (Antonio Banderas)
running out of a house which has a pool, you know he is going to end up
in it. Remember the famous scene in the Marx Bros. film where they are
facing each other as if they were looking in a mirror?  That was a
work of genius. This silly thing tried to imitate it with a variation
that was just a poor imitation.</P>
<P>     An art dealer/cum con man, Art (Dodge. . . is that a pun for
Dickens' "Artful Dodger?") pretends he is a twin brother to Bart.  Both
parts are played by Antonio Banderas.  As the twin, he lets his long
hair down and puts on glasses.</P>
<P>     The cast consists of well-known names.  Aside from Banderas, there
is Melanie Griffith, Daryl Hannah, Joan Cusack, Danny Aiello and Joan
Cusack.  What a waste of talent.</P>
<P>     Question, when is Aiello going to refuse to play a mafia-type
surrounded by bone-breaking bodyguards?  He has the talent but he has
been typecast as an Italian gangster and apparently the money that part
brings him overshadows the fact that he is a good actor and ought to
insist that his agent find him a new role.</P>
<PRE>                         Directed by Fernando Trueba</PRE>
