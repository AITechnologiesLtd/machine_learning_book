<P>It seems like I'm reviewing cheeseball horror movies on a monthly
basis now. Scream revitalized a genre the studios are now intent on
burying into the ground again-the serial killers in these new slasher
movies have nothing on Sony and Miramax in the "relentless"
department. I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is a terrible film
in many respects, but in the wake of the stupefyingly bad Urban
Legend, it's Citizen Hook. </P>
<P>Jennifer Love-Hewitt reprises her role as buxom teenager Julie
James-who apparently escaped certain doom at the end of the last movie
by...waking up. She lives in fear of Ben Willis, the vengeful
fisherman-victim of a hit and run by Julie and her pals. Paranoid and
beat, she accepts a free trip to the Bahamas from her friend Karla
(Norwood), winner of the local radio station's 4th of July getaway
giveaway. Bikini-ready Julie invites boyfriend Ray (Prinze, Jr.),
who-and here's the movie's biggest mystery-TURNS HER DOWN, but changes
his mind and plans to surprise her before take-off. Until he gets a
roadside visit from Captain Hell-liner himself, that is. Unaware of
this and feeling shunned, Julie goes on vacation, anyway, with Karla,
Karla's boyfriend (Pfeiffer), and Will (Matthew Settle), a real
boy-next-door type who's sweet on Julie. </P>
<P>To make a long story short-I can't believe it took a paragraph to
describe the set-up for this gratuitous sequel-the trip is a disaster.
Not only is it storm season, not only is the desk clerk (The
Frighteners' Jeffrey Combs) a jerk, not only are the few island
residents and our heroic vacationers getting picked off by the
resourceful Willis one-by-one, but the Karaoke machine isn't working
properly! (You think killing is hard? Try reprogramming a LaserDisc so
that Gloria Gaynor's "I Will Survive" now contains the lyric "I still
know what you did last summer!") All is not lost-Ray is on his way to
save the day, and a helpful witch doctor is saying little prayers for
Julie and co. </P>
<P>This picture is really about breasts: two of them. Julie, like a good
horror heroine, never does up her shirt to the collar, always wears
white in the rain, and keeps sexy underwear on in case of a sudden
desire to tan. Based on the hormonal charge I got out of the movie, I
can't imagine what it was doing to the ten year old boy who sat next
to me-he gets Jennifer Love-Hewitt, and my generation got Heather
Langenkamp! Lucky bastard. </P>
<P>I didn't like I Know What You Did Last Summer and I can't say I liked
this continuation any more or less. The pacing in both films is
languid-how is it that so much time passes with neither murder nor
character development? I Still Know What You Did Last Summer has a
better sense of humour than the first one, though, and at least it
explains away Willis's random selection of victims. (I don't think the
hotel maid or the stoner dude had the slightest idea what Julie did
last summer.) Director Cannon (Judge Dredd) is a competent filmmaker
but not a particularly imaginative one-if there is a part three (what
on Earth would they call it?), and the fun denouement suggests there
will be, here's my suggestion: hire a filmmaker with flair, someone
who can really energize this stillborn series-someone who won't rely
on so many shock notes. And let that person run wild with the camera.
(Aside: if Blandy [sic] must appear in the next one, try to keep the
number of times she says "baby" to a minimum. Thanks in advance.) </P>
