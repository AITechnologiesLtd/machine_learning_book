<P>Diane Keaton's portrayal of the frustrated Aunt Bessie is probably her best
role since "Annie Hall." Keaton plays a humane, misunderstood woman who is
trying to come to terms with her estranged sister (Meryl Streep) and her
troubled nephew (Leonard DiCaprio) after discovering she has leukemia. It is a
strong, subtle performance and it deserves to be in a much better movie than
the one provided. </P>
<P>At the start of the film, we see Bessie's estranged sister (Streep) majoring in
cosmetology, and raising two sons on her own. When her older son (DiCaprio)
burns the house down, he is admitted to a mental institution. Then Streep gets
a call from Bessie revealing her condition and her dire need for a bone marrow
transplant. Streep reluctantly agrees, and brings her two sons to Florida since
they qualify as good candidates for a transplant. </P>
<P>Bessie lives with her bedridden, senile father (Hume Cronyn) and kooky aunt who
cries while watching soap operas. Predictably, Bessie and her sister do not get
along whereas DiCaprio and Bessie do. I don't need to give away much more of
the tedious plot since you may have guessed the rest by now. </P>
<P>"Marvin's Room" is basically a TV movie with a better cast and stagy production
values (it is based on a play by Scott Macpherson). As aforementioned, Diane
Keaton is forceful and magnetic to watch - her scenes with Streep are powerful.
Ditto the scintillating DiCaprio who steals the scenes he shares with Streep
and Keaton - the scene with DiCaprio trying to eat chips while Streep insists
on asking permission from Bessie is tense and comical. Meryl Streep is
believably trashy and uptight - a performance that recalls her "Silkwood"
portrayal. There's also the ubiquitous Robert De Niro as an affable doctor who
rides in a bicycle and comes to work wearing a helmet (he's also one of the
producers of the film). De Niro delivers a blast of subtle, comedic touches -
too bad, his role is so short (as in "Sleepers") since he brings the film alive
whenever he's on screen. </P>
<P>'Somehow, "Marvin's Room" follows a very clear, formulaic path from the
beginning and ends just when things start to get really interesting. Every
scene is predictable, and there isn't a sense of spontaneity as you might
expect from such a great cast. Still, what distinguishes it from the norm is
its refreshing lack of overt sentimentality. That and Diane Keaton's bravura
performance warrants a look at this mild, flawed piece. </P>
