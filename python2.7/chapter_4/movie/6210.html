                            The Pearl (1945)
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     John Steinbeck was the champion of the poor and the downtrodden.
Through a long series of novels he tried to be their voice.  As a
youth, he was the first author with whom I became entranced.  I fell in
love with his writings so much that I read every book he ever wrote.
Only one other serious author, Sinclair Lewis, would have that same
effect on me and cause me to seek out even his obscure early novels.
I've also read all of the books of authors like Grisham, Clancy, etc.,
but those are just fun diversions.</P>
<P>     San Jose State University is having a Steinbeck festival this
weekend, and I caught the brief lecture about and the film of "The
Pearl."  Steve Gold gave the lecture based on notes from a professor at
San Jose State who was supposed to be there, but who got delayed at the
airport.  Since I had never seen Emilio Fernandez's THE PEARL (1945)
and since "The Pearl" was not among my favorite of Steinbeck's novels,
I looked forward to seeing my reaction to it.</P>
<P>     In the lecture part we learned that one third of Steinbeck's books
were set in Mexico as is "The Pearl."  There are two quite unusual
aspects in the development of the book and the movie.  This was one of
the rare cases then when the movie idea came first.  In 1941 Steinbeck
met director Fernandez while on vacation in Mexico, and he
matter-of-factly told the director "The Pearl" story he had heard from
the locals.  Fernandez said that he should make that into a book with a
movie in mind, which is just what Steinbeck did.  He even has
references in the book to music which were later captured in the film.</P>
<P>     The second unusual part is that the movie was filmed on location
in La Paz, Mexico using Mexican actors.  Although common now, it was
rarely done then.  Steinbeck's motivation was, "I want to keep the film
out of the hands of Hollywood."  Don't get confused.  The film is in
English and not Spanish with English dubbing.</P>
<P>     "This is a story that old men tell to children.  They aren't sure
where it happened or when," explains the opening narration.  From the
beginning, award winning cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa's black and
white photography dominates the picture right along with the heavy
music by Antonio Diaz Conde.  Sometimes it seems the story is only a
vehicle for these two talented individuals to show off their wares.</P>
<P>     The cinematography is highly imaginative.  Although much lower
budget, it reminded me of the innovative work done for CITIZEN KANE.
Figueroa films his characters from below, all the better to enhance
their stature into almost mythical figures.  His most intricate and
lovely scene is at a dance where the dancers and musicians play to a
backdrop of sparkling fireworks which create a complex lace pattern
behind them.</P>
<P>     Conde's music has all the subtlety of a hurricane, but is quite
impressive and moving nevertheless.  He likes to show off his trumpets,
kettle drums, and violins with maximum power plus he brings in romantic
Mexican folk music.</P>
<P>     As the story unfolds, the son of Indian peasants Quino (Pedro
Armendariz) and Maria Juana (Elena Marques) is stung by a scorpion, but
the local doctor (Charles Roones) refuses to even see the baby since
"Indians have no money."</P>
<P>     In a beautiful scene, Quino dives deep underwater without aid of
oxygen.  He is looking for pearls, and he finds the biggest pearl
anyone there has ever seen.  When he stands up in the boat holding it,
he looks up to heaven, but then gives a devilish laugh.  Like an opera
or like filmmaker Satyajit Ray's classic "Apu Trilogy," the acting and
the gestures are exaggerated, but none the less powerful.  THE PEARL is
not realist - it either works as a fable or it doesn't.  Thankfully, it
is a touching fable and is quite successful.</P>
<P>     So what would be your dream if you discovered great riches?
Humble Quino's one wish in life is not for himself, but for his son -
an education.  Or as he puts it, "my son will know and through him we
will know."</P>
<P>     Although some may subconsciously put them down Quino's sentiments
as trite, it reminded me of my childhood.  We were not very well off,
and my father, who dropped out of school in the tenth grade, had a
single ambition for me - that I would go to college.  That I went on to
Berkeley and got my Ph. D. was not as important to him as that enabling
first degree.  The day I got my B. A. was one of the happiest days of
his entire life.</P>
<P>     Soon Quino becomes drunk with the power of his pearl proclaiming,
"The pearl will make us free."  The doctor is now happy to treat his
son and even makes house calls.  Everyone in town become Quino's
friend, all the better to be able to try to steal his treasure.  His
wife is frighten by it all and warns him, "throw the pearl into the sea
or it will destroy us."</P>
<P>     The operatic style ending is dramatic and effective.  The narrator
closes solemnly with, "the pearl, which had been hope and beauty, was
turned to great ugliness and death."  THE PEARL is a touching movie
that speaks to everyone and is well worth renting.</P>
<P>     THE PEARL runs just 1:17.  It is not rated, but would be G or PG.
There is no sex, nudity, or bad language.  People are shot, but they
fall down quickly and bloodlessly like in a Western.  The film would be
fine for any kid old enough to be interested in it.  I recommend this
small cinematic gem to you and give it ***.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
