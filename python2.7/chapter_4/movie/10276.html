<PRE>THE POSTMAN</PRE>
<P> By Harvey Karten, Ph.D.
 Warner Bros./Tig Production
 Director:  Kevin Costner
 Writer:  Eric Roth and Brian Helgeland, book by David Brin
 Cast: Kevin Costner, Will Patton, Larenz Tate, Olivia
Williams, James Russo, Tom Petty</P>
<P>   "Strangers: do you say 'hi' or do you blow their heads off?"
queries the title character (Kevin Costner) well into his latest
long, epic movie. This rhetorical question is at the heart of this
sweeping odyssey, filmed smashingly in some of America's
most scenic, Pacific Northwest areas by cinematographer
Stephen Windom.  Based on a novel by David Brin, the
screenplay is loaded with conviction, taking the present
country--which the writers consider all too politically and
ethnically divided--into the year 2013, a land of strangers
living in isolated, fortress communities after a series of riots
and plagues has destroyed the government, the infrastructure,
the electrical systems, and just about everything that gives
meaning to its very name, the UNITED States.</P>
<P>   Genre-wise, "The Postman" is perhaps the oddest duck of
1997 crop of films, a pot-pourri of paradoxes.  It's possesses
a 21st-century sci-fi imagination but looks more like a 19th
Century, John-Wayne style Western.  Fifteen years have
elapsed since the present day, yet the surviving people look
as they they've come out of the Middle Ages.  The
government, such as it is, certainly does not bear out the
predictions of futurologists who think we are headed into a
world community united by intricate trade agreements and
political compromises.  Rather it has become a series of
feudal fiefdoms occasionally invaded by a warlord named
General Bethlehem (Will Patton).  Its hero is a solitary, rugged
individualist who is a staunch believer in community.  Like
"Titanic," which opened one week previous to this Costner-
dominated work, it's full of hokum, yet the cornball humor
seems meant to be taken at its word rather than as campy
buffoonery, and as such is likely to be derided by urbanites,
cynics and critics but embraced by Middle America.  In short,
"The Postman" is an original, an ideologically-driven movie
whose story line is a solidly conventional narrative, eclipsed
by an aw-shucks hero who is neither Superman nor Batman,
but, of all things, Postman.  If the United States Postal
Service had anything to do with its production, it has put over
one of the most extensive and vainglorious product
placements in cinema history.  Costner has done more to
glorify the position of mail carrier than anyone since Cliff
Claven (John Ratzenberger) of "Cheers" renown.</P>
<P>   The story opens on a solitary individual roaming a nearly
barren desert whose only conversations are with his burro
named Billy.  He's a peaceful sort, a would-be actor who at
one point entertains a small community of kids with some
badly performed monologues taken from Shakespeare which
delight his innocent, young audience as much as the duel he
fights with his four-legged friend.  Since the U.S. government
in Washington no longer exists and technology is kaput in this
post-apocalyptic land, a vacuum has been created, one which
is being filled by a marauding, crypto-fascist army under the
leadership of the merciless Bethlehem (Will Patton). 
Bethlehem, an out-and-out villain who fights not so much for
dominance as for the very love of skirmishes, adds men to his
rag-tag but vicious army by drafting unwilling members of the
towns he invades.  His big mistake is impressing the
Shakespearean actor into his service, a man who despite his
pacifism and love of the arts becomes his arch-enemy by
escaping from the well-guarded encampment, donning the
U.S. Post Office uniform of a deceased letter carrier he
comes across during his escape, and, discovering a sack of
undelivered mail, proceeds to deliver it to addressees in the
first community he encounters.</P>
<P>   We quickly become aware that this mail service, in the
absence of computers, becomes the principal hope of people
who have long been segregated into small locales and have
been unable to communicate with friends and relatives in
distant areas.  The Postman not only delivers during the
metaphoric gloom of night which has descended on the
country: he gives added faith to the people by fabricating
stories of a restored United States government under a
President Sharkey, with the capital city moved to Minneapolis. 
"The Postman" then turns into a road movie with a strong
romantic theme, as the title character is seduced by the
beautiful Abby (Olivia Williams) who without the slightest
timidity announces that she wants to be impregnated by him
since her husband is infertile.</P>
<P>   The team behind this movie, especially Costner who is
principal actor, director and co-producer, and the scripters,
Eric Roth and Brian Helgeland, envision a shattered nation
taken over by neo-Nazi gangs, making the point clear that
General Bethlehem--who is a mediocre painter with a
superficial knowledge of the liberal arts--has been modeled as
a 21st century Hitler, even to the point of tattooing his
unwilling conscripts.  With a bow to textbook psychology, the
movie shows us that some of the draftees become
enthusiastic members of the right-wing zealots, particularly
one slow-witted guy who insists, "I like it here...I want to
belong to something."  There is little attempt at subtlety in this
script: Costner seems to have a broad audience in mind when
he spells out every detail leaving little to metaphoric
speculation.  Even the baby who is born to The Postman and
his loving woman Abby is named Hope, showing the
importance of continuity as well as community if what remains
of the country is to be saved, to prosper, to re-unite.  The
statue of the Postman which is unveiled decades after his
passing can be dismissed by a hip audience as laughable, but
Costner's heart is in the right place and he seems perfectly
happy to throw in cloying message so that every last member
of his paying fans will get the central ideas.  </P>
<P>   Costner has the money to make the pictures he wants to
make, once again, as with "Dancing With Wolves," delivering
his purport with an expensive, sometimes ludicrous, but
always sincere and exquisitely photographed work.
Rated R.  Running Time: 177 minutes.  (C) 1997 Harvey
