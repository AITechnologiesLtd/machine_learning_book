<P>     No matter how you feel about cute, fuzzy puppets, it's difficult to 
actively dislike the Muppets.  From their 1976 television show until 
today, Jim Henson's creations have always appealed on more than one 
level, offering adorable playmates and positive messages to children and 
surprisingly sophisticated humor to adults.  MUPPET TREASURE ISLAND, the 
fifth big screen feature to star Kermit the Frog and friends, and the 
second directed by Brian Henson, delivers exactly what fans -- young and 
old -- expect.</P>
<P>     As was true of their 1992 outing, THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL, the 
Muppets are visiting familiar motion picture territory -- there have 
been over a half-dozen movie adaptations of Robert Louis Stevenson's 
TREASURE ISLAND.  Of course, none before now have featured singing 
crocodiles, warbling lobsters, talking frogs, and high-kicking pigs.  As 
usual, a few human actors get in on the fun, including Tim Curry and 
Kevin Bishop.</P>
<P>     MUPPET TREASURE ISLAND doesn't exactly re-invent the classic story, 
but it takes a few liberties with it.  Young Jim Hawkins (Bishop) is on 
board the ship of Captain Smollett (Kermit the Frog), bound for the 
Caribbean and buried pirates' treasure.  The crew, a mutinous group of 
thugs and cutthroats, are led by the one-legged bandit Long John Silver 
(Tim Curry).  Once land is sighted, Silver makes his power-play, nabbing 
Jim and his treasure map and seizing control of the ship.  The only 
obstacle still remaining between the rogue and unlimited wealth is an 
army of wild boars and their leader, Benjamina Gunn (Miss Piggy).</P>
<P>     There have been many great on-screen/off-screen couples -- Bogart 
and Becall, Tracy and Hepburn, Branagh and Thompson -- but none are 
quite as intriguing as Kermit and Piggy.  A match made in Jim Henson's 
workshop, these two have gone through some tough times in the last 
twenty years, but they have endured.  And, although they don't have many 
scenes together in MUPPET TREASURE ISLAND (Piggy doesn't show up until 
the film is two-thirds over), it's clear that the chemistry is still 
there.</P>
<P>     One of the chief pleasures of MUPPET TREASURE ISLAND is watching 
Tim Curry essay Long John Silver.  Curry, who no one would ever call 
subtle, creates one of the most memorable human characters in any Muppet 
film.  Kevin Bishop makes an appealing Jim Hawkins, the young 
protagonist in search of a family.  Jennifer Saunders and Billy Connolly 
have suitably overt-the-top cameos.</P>
<P>     As has always been true in Muppet movies, set design is superb.  
MUPPET TREASURE ISLAND is an impressive-looking motion picture, rich in 
color and contrast, and featuring some impeccable matte paintings.  
There are the usual musical numbers -- seven jaunty tunes that will be 
forgotten the moment you leave the theater.  They may not be memorable, 
but at least they're not irritating.</P>
<P>     MUPPET TREASURE ISLAND comes out under the Disney umbrella, and, 
like every movie that is favored with Mickey's Midas touch, this one has 
the potential to be a huge favorite.  The Muppets certainly have "family 
appeal", and the film is designed to keep parents interested and 
children enthralled.  It's not as eye-popping as TOY STORY or as magical 
as an animated feature, but MUPPET TREASURE ISLAND represents ninety-
plus minutes of solid entertainment, and you won't have to dig to find 
it.</P>
