A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Warren Beatty</PRE>
<P>Written by: Warren Beatty and Jeremy Pikser</P>
<P>Starring: Warren Beatty, Halle Berry, Oliver Platt</P>
<P>Ingredients: 
Completely honest Senator who says: "If you don't put down that malt
liquor and chicken wings and get behind somebody other than a running
back who stabs his wife, you're never going to get rid of somebody like
me."</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
In this sharp and hilarious comedy which combines madcap farce with
stinging political commentary, old Senator Jay Billington Bulworth
(Warren Beatty) is a pitiful, corrupted former 60s idealist who 'sold
out' to rich special interests, and as a result is engulfed in moral
guilt, shame, sadness and depression. On TV the smiling senator is
ostensibly running a successful re-election campaign, but actually he is
on the verge of a suicidal mental breakdown. After taking his last 10
million dollar insurance bribe, Bulworth arranges to hire an anonymous
contract killer and contracts a hit on himself, to take place sometime
within the next three days. </P>
<P>To his surprise, Bulworth suddenly finds out that - - now that nothing
matters - - he's at last free to be perfectly honest and candid. He can
say what he actually feels about his job, the American political
process, and real life in America. Elated, Bulworth decides to cancel
his assassination, but to his dismay, he finds out he's unable to get in
contact with the hit man in order to cancel the hit. </P>
<P>Thus begins the outrageous, loony and slightly paranoid behavior of a
completely honest, politically incorrect senator. For example, Bulworth
tells poor churchgoers that they are little more than photo
opportunities for politicians. When voters accuse him of past misdeeds,
he asks, "Isn't that obvious?"He tells rich movie producers that they
are bilking the American public with greedy, worthless, schlock movies.
Bulworth goes to south central LA and learns to rap, then takes up
wearing a knit cap and baggy shorts and begins to deliver his speeches
in rhymes. </P>
<P>As Bulworth's unorthodox ravings progress, he tackles life with
increasingly fearless, unrepentant abandon. Refusing to sleep, Bulworth
becomes the incandescent symbol of the discontented average American; as
a result, the American public jumps to his support. He also romances a
mysterious beautiful woman named Nina (Halle Berry).</P>
<P>What will happen to the romance, the campaign, and the hit contract? </P>
<PRE>Opinion:
Put simply, I like BULWORTH immensely because it is hilarious and it has
guts. </PRE>
<P>The reason why I say it's a gutsy film is because there will no doubt be
sensitive people who will want to take this movie too seriously. As the
Bulworth character  is completely nuts, outrageously irreverent, and
makes a target of the entire political spectrum, there are bound to be
folks who take offense to the farcical senator's delirious speeches.  </P>
<P>The reason why I say it's hilarious is because BULWORTH is meant to
provide farcical entertainment. Why else would the unshaven senator be
dressed in hip-hop clothing and spouting raps to a grooving soundtrack? </P>
<P>I highly recommend this film to anybody. You may like it, or you may
hate it, but I guarantee it will not leave you indifferent. </P>
