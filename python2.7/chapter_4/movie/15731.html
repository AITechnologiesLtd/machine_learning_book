Louise Wilson</P>
<P>   The oldest theme in the books is: boy meets girl, boy loses
girl, boy gets girl.  "Stepmom" capitalizes on this but with a
notable variation.  Boy loses girl, boy meets girl, girl hates
girl, girl likes girl.  Everything else about "Stepmom" runs its
course without a single mutation.  In a movie that's directed
and edited in a compulsively conventional manner suitable for
afternoon TV, Chris Columbus helms a dramatization of a
screenplay credited to five (count 'em) writers, a movie that
looks every bit like one penned by a committee.  Disjointed,
loaded with tired expressions and disconcerting exchanges,
"Stepmom" seems unable even to jerk tears from its targeted
audience of women who must be as tired of disease-of-the-
week pieces as the United States is of impeachment
hearings.</P>
<P>   Director Columbus has already proved his ability to deal
with stories about kids ("Home Alone") and about women's
issues ("Mrs. Doubtfire") but is not likely this time to approach
the well-deserved box office that those features received. 
Exploiting a theme as ancient as those explored by
Greek tragedies like "Electra," Columbus portrays the strife
that overcomes a family when daddy Luke (Ed Harris)
divorces mother Jackie (Susan Sarandon) and moves in with
the much younger Isabel (Julia Roberts).  Though Isabel
knows every rock song ever played and even bribes Luke's
two children with a Golden Retriever puppy, Luke's kids Anna
(Jena Malone) and Ben (Liam Aiken) treat her with contempt.
She is the meddler who has allegedly broken up the family,
exiling the very capable and loving Jackie and putting the
youngsters in the hands of a career woman who can't cook
and has no experience whatever with the care and nurturing
of children.  If you guess that by the picture's conclusion
Isabel will become a fully condoned member of the
household, you're telepathic.  And if you prophesy that the
beloved Jackie, considered by all to be the Earth Mother
herself, will suffer a recurrence of a deadly cancer, you're
positively clairvoyant.  </P>
<P>   The dialogue is fatuous throughout, featuring sentences
that you'd never hear in real life but have listened to all too
often in movies of this sort.  The women seem almost to
enjoy their catfights, lashing at each other with declarations
only a little more novel than 12-year-old Anna's, "I don't
have to listen to you...you're not my mother."  It gets even
better.  When the women ultimately reconcile as you vaguely
suspected they would, Jackie lovingly tells her former enemy,
"I have her past, and you can have her future."</P>
<P>   There are all too many cute scenes of the whining kids,
although Liam Aiken's Ben is less insufferable in his rejection
of his stepmom than his adolescent sister.  But performances
are fine all around, with Julia Roberts looking good as a
photographer of fashion models who absurdly gives up her
fast-track job to be more of a mom to her future stepchildren,
but it's disconcerting to watch her in a discreetly
romantic bedroom scene with Ed Harris--who is in real-life
seventeen years her senior and look five years beyond that. 
For an edgier, more mature and imaginative film about the
hostility between child and dad, take in Paul Schrader's
movie "Affliction," which features an Oscar-caliber
performance by Nick Nolte.</P>
