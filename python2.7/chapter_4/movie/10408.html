<PRE>Dear God (1996)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 17</PRE>
<P>"Dear God" is an alleged comedy.  The film stars Greg Kinnear
as a con artist brought before a judge and given the choice
of work or jail.  Kinnear chooses a job at the post office,
serving his time in the dead letter office.  There, he meets
his co-workers, most of whom are eccentric.  You will recognize
Tim Conway and Laurie Metcalf.  Conway isn't awful, but he
isn't given much to work with.  Metcalf is a candidate for
Most Disappointing Supporting Actress.</P>
<P>An attempt by Kinnear to steal money and valuables from the mail
to pay off bullying loan sharks somehow leads to a campaign by
his postal co-workers to do good deads for troubled folks who have
written letters to God.  This leads to a second confrontation with
a judge, for tampering with the mail.  I guess God is upset when
others read his mail.</P>
<P>This is a really bad movie.  I would never have suffered through
it, except that relatives actually paid money to rent it, and
kept waiting forlornly for Tim Conway to be funny.  Nothing in
the movie is funny, which is rare even for very bad comedies.
Kinnear has a love interest who doesn't care that he is a broke
con artist in trouble with both the law and the mob.  The film is
full of scenes that make little sense, such as a downtown parade
featuring five second cameos of has-been stars, and Metcalf
giving a bizarre courtroom demonstration that involves dogs,
chanting, and beating a trashcan like a drum.</P>
<P>The real con here is "Dear God" as a comedy.  Garry Marshall,
the Director and thus the man most responsible for this waste of
videotape, has a few cameo scenes.  Lock him up and throw away
the key, and tell Kinnear to read the script before signing
another contract.</P>
