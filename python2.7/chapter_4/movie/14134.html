<P>The barkers at old-time carnival freak shows lured customers in by 
promising they would witness spectacles like "The Incredible Two-Headed 
Dog" or "The World's Tiniest Man." After the suckers plucked their money 
down, they were led behind dingy curtains only to encounter a bored dwarf 
and a mummified puppy with a "second head" clumsily grafted on. "54" is 
the cinematic equivalent of one of those phony carny shows. After 
promising a festival of bare bodies, wild sex and debauchery set in the 
epicenter of late 70s - early 80s hedonism, they instead deliver a tepid 
morality tale that plays like a half-baked rip-off of "Saturday Night 
Fever."</P>
<P>It wasn't always this way. In an recent issue of "Interview," "54" star 
Ryan Phillippe described the film as an edgy work showing, among other 
things, a pivotal character free-basing onscreen. He spoke of kissing his 
buddy and co-star Breckin Meyer in one scene. Phillippe said "Who's going 
to deny that at Studio 54 in 1979 there were a lot of people going both 
ways, guys who'd make out with a boy upstairs and then head down to be 
with a girl? That was real; it happened. Why should I be afraid of 
evoking reality?"</P>
<P>Apparently all that evoked reality scared the bejesus out of the 
executives at Miramax, because the free-basing is gone, along with 
Phillippe and Meyer's kiss and virtually all of the gay and bi-sexual 
scenes (one anonymous male/male smooch remains, immediately followed by a 
reassuring glimpse of a hetero couple screwing with their clothes on). 
Hell, there's hardly even any straight sex scenes left in the film, for 
that matter. In their zeal to avoid making mainstream audiences feel 
squirmy, Miramax cut the hedonism out of a movie about hedonism. What in 
the world were these people thinking? Did they actually believe we wanted 
to see Studio 54 presented as a bowdlerized "Afterschool Special?"</P>
<P>So what's left? "Saturday Night Fever Jr." Phillippe plays Shane O'Shea, 
a lower-class Jersey kid who leaves his blue-collar neighborhood for the 
glitz, glitter and excess of Steve Rubell's Studio 54. After baring his 
torso for the smarmy Rubell, Phillippe gets hired as a busboy, making 
friends with barback Greg (Breckin Meyer) and his wife Anita (Salma 
Hayek), a coat-check girl with disco diva aspirations. Shane soon lands a 
coveted job as a 54 bartender, a position ensuring instant fame in 
Rubell's world of flesh and flash. The young buck sets his sights on soap-
opera actress Julie (Neve Campbell), even as his increasing drug use 
begins to numb his feeble little brain. Meanwhile, Rubell rolls in money 
(literally), taunts the IRS on television and swallows every pill in 
sight. You can figure out the rest of the story on your own.</P>
<P>Mike Myers gives a broad, but diverting performance as geeky dictator 
Rubell, playing him like a male version of his "it's like buttah" 
character from "Saturday Night Live." Rubell's notion of mixing 
celebrities and civilians in a glamorous exclusive neverland of 
debauchery was inspired, and watching this nebbish Napoleon rule his 
kingdom is fascinating, but Rubell serves only as a supporting player 
while the focus remains on the utterly vapid Shane O'Shea.</P>
<P>As Shane, Ryan Phillippe is very, very bland. One female admirer 
describes him as having "the body of Michelangelo's "David" attached to a 
Botticelli face." This woman clearly needs to get out to art museums more 
often. Phillippe is a slight, somber introvert and, try as he might, he 
is never believable as a stud here. Breckin Meyer displays far more 
charisma as the frustrated barback deemed too short to be a bartender 
(oddly, Meyer is only a bit shorter than Phillippe, who is not a tall man 
either). Salma Hayek is adequate as a would-be singer, while the 
cadaverous Neve Campbell barely makes any impression at all. </P>
<P>Memo to Miramax. Having Ryan Phillippe describe the wild life at Studio 
54 in voice-overs doesn't cut the mustard. We want to see it. If you're 
going to finance a movie like this, give the final cut to the director 
and have the balls to stand behind him. Memo to everyone else. If you 
want to see an edgy film about sex, drugs and excess, rent "Boogie Nights.
" If you want a gritty, well-acted portrait of the disco era, rent 
"Saturday Night Fever." But whatever you do, don't waste your money on 
the superficial, cowardly "54."  </P>
