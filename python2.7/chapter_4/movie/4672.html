<PRE>                        THE SPY WHO LOVED ME (1977)

<PRE>THE SPY WHO LOVED ME (1977) ***</PRE>
<P>        One of the most entertaining James Bond films from the 
Roger Moore era, THE SPY WHO LOVED ME is probably the biggest 
budget Bond movie, with huge sets and props as well as some 
blockbuster action scenes. And how can you not like a movie that co-
stars Ringo's wife, Barbara Bach, and features a non-stop disco version 
of the traditional series score?</P>
<P>        It's a globe-trotting action movie that has Bond and Mrs. 
Starr, a beautiful Russian spy, teaming up to end SPECTRE's latest 
threat. This time, it's a madman who kidnaps two nuclear submarines, 
one Russian and one American. His plan is to destroy the civilized 
world as we know it and begin an underwater society. This is 
somebody who went a little too far after seeing THE LITTLE 
MERMAID. I know the shell bra is a real turn-on, but give me a 
break.</P>
<P>        The Bond formula works especially well here. Even though 
the omnipresent disco score becomes annoying and the ski slope chase 
scene at the beginning is blue screen technology at its worst, there are 
still more than enough gadgets, explosions, chases, etc. to make up. 
And as usual, Bond's three-woman quota is reached with a little help 
from Mrs. Starr, who also makes the movie a standout in the series. 
Most of the beautiful women from the 70's were hidden behind the 
ugly bell-bottoms and poofy hair, which makes Bach's straight-haired, 
smartly-dressed Agent XXX a welcome exception.</P>
<P>        I'd have to say Ringo Starr is the luckiest bastard on earth. 
First his talentless self got to be in the greatest rock and roll band ever, 
then he married one of the hottest ladies of the 70's, now he gets to eat 
his pizza _crust first_! We should all be so fortunate.</P>
