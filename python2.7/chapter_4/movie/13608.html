<P>Europe, and it is something that very few Americans really relate to, has
been terribly damaged from the World Wars.  Not only were countries totally
decimated, so were complete family trees, specially the one relating to the
Jewish faith.</P>
<P>In the past forty years, many films have depicted this destruction, and the
human suffering which it had caused.  Be it an Italian film like THE
BICYCLE THIEF, or later, the polish film KNIFE IN THE WATER, and the ability
of many film makers to begin expressing themselves through the film medium,
the main theme was always someone's incredible journey of survival against
some incredible odds.  Aside from the more unusual films about the war, like
THE TIN DRUM, almost all of them, stand up for the defense of the faith,
indeed any faith, that was oppressed.</P>
<P>Today, there are some people who lived in those days as youngsters, and some
of them, have finally out lived their fears, to be able to tell a horrific
story, and while they still have a sense of religious piety, they more often
than not have yet, a larger sense of self, than most.</P>
<P>Solomon Perel, was just such a person, who basically along the way, got a
bit lucky, and was able to survive because he went to a few schools and
learned a language or two, which as it turns out, was his saving grace.  The
struggle for survival takes many turns.  But as almost all of them  around
him fall by wayside ( they all display an over emotional response,  by the
way ) he manages to hold his head together long enough to keep himself alive
until the war ends, or his freedom, if he can find a way.  Solomon
Perel was luckier than most, he escaped to Palestine, and now lives in
Israel.</P>
<P>This film is more about the indoctrination of the younger ones, than it is
about anything else.  The Germans spent a lot of effort educating their
future generation of Aryans to rule the world.  And the Russians spent a lot
of time convincing many that their atheistic view point was more valid than
the opposing view point.  And of course, the Jews in the film, merely remain
faithful to their creed, imposing some rules on the young ( no
different there ), but at least, it is on a more acceptable mode.   Except
for one thing which the young man has to hide during his youth, and is a bit
of a problem in the German schools.  He is circumcised, and it came close to
costing him his life.</P>
<P>The film moves along very well, and is not predictable at all, which is very
similar, I'm sure to what the young Solomon had to go through.  It doesn't
have boring moments, and even includes some flights of fancy by the young
man, who has a bit if a sense of humor, even if subtle.</P>
<P>NICE FILM. SHOULD BE SEEN BY CONSCIENTIOUS FILM VIEWERS.</P>
<PRE>3.5 GIBLOONS out of 5</PRE>
