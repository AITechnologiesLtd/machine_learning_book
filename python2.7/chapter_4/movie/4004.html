<PRE>                                  CLOCKERS
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     After the first two minutes of CLOCKERS, during which a parade of
bloody crime scene photos are splashed on the screen, you'll be ready
to put down your popcorn.  After the first fifteen minutes, you'll be
bored enough to go buy some more.</P>
<P>     You can't imagine how sick and tired I was of hearing the hype
surrounding CLOCKERS, Spike Lee's latest film about (surprise!)
African-Americans in Brooklyn who get into trouble with drugs, murder,
and betrayal.  Every other critic on the planet will probably say they
love CLOCKERS so as not to appear uncool.  I'll give it to you
straight.</P>
<P>     By and large, Lee has forgone the traditional concepts of
moviemaking (to tell a cohesive, interesting, entertaining story) in
favor of playing a lot of bad music, giving us some incomprehensible
and overlapping dialogue, photographing some meaningless low-light
images, and other sundry nonsense.  A plot does exist: Strike (Mekhi
Phifer) is a clocker (a drug dealer), and his boss (Delroy Lindo, a
shameless Samuel L. Jackson wannabe) sends Strike to kill the local
fast food franchise's night manager.  After all, who wouldn't?  The
cops (Harvey Keitel and John Turturro) close in, and everything comes
crashing down.</P>
<P>     To be honest, it never goes up high enough to crash, per se.  The
film just wallows in its hipper-than-thou attitude and never becomes
engaging in the least.  Characters come and go with no motivation,
spouting their lines as if...Spike Lee had written them for the
actors.  No one is likable at all.  Lee's ultra-stylish use of a
constantly moving camera gets old in about five minutes, annoying in
ten.  And the film just drones on and on ... for 132 very unnecessary
minutes.</P>
<P>     While CLOCKERS has its moments, they are few and far between.  By
the time the film starts to show some promise (about 90 minutes in),
it's much too late to save it.  Overall this is the perfect example of
how *not* to make a movie about the mean streets, coming off more like
a gory Movie of the Week than a feature film.</P>
<PRE>     The bottom line for this movie about drugs?  Just say no.</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  **</PRE>
