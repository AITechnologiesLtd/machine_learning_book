<PRE>A LIFE LESS ORDINARY (1997)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Danny Boyle
Writer: John Hodge
Starring: Ewan McGregor, Cameron Diaz, Delroy Lindo, Holly Hunter, Ian
Holm, Stanley Tucci, Dan Hedaya, Maury Chaykin, Tony Shalhoub, Ian
McNeice, Judith Ivey</P>
<P>I so wanted to love this movie.  I mean, after adoring both the awesome
awesome awesome "Shallow Grave," and the masterpiece "Trainspotting," I
was ready to see another absolutely amazing piece of film work by the
team of Boyle/MacDonald/Hodge/McGregor.  But, sadly, I have to give this
a disappointing rating.  It kills me to do that to a film which I had
hyped up so much, and it's definitely with a kind of tear in my eye that
I write this review.  Well, maybe I'm overly exaggerating this little
melodrama.</P>
<P>Well, as the ads had put it, this was to be a darkly comic twist on the
old 30s screwball comedy, which includes such films as "It Happened One
Night," "His Girl Friday," and "Bringing Up Baby."  Anyone who's seen
either of them knows how awesome they are - cleverly written,
wonderfully acted, and just plain memorable as hell.  After going
Hitchcockian with "Shallow Grave," and Kubrickian with "Trainspotting,"
it seemed that them going Hawks-ian and/or Capra-ian was a clever idea.</P>
<P>And it is.  And for a lot of the movie, the twist is great.  Here we
have the chief screwball element - two completely different people who
bicker so much that they eventually fall in love.  Take this, mix it
with a lot of black comedy, hitmen, graphic violence, and a great style
only Boyle can bring us, and sprinkle a bit of Coen on it, and we have
what this film is.  But this film has so much going on, that it seems to
fall apart after awhile.</P>
<P>The plot, which sounds a lot like the plot of that Alicia masterpiece
(ahem!) "Excess Baggage," deals with a down-on-his-luck loser/semi-idiot
named Robert (the Boyle staple Ewan McGregor) who loses his job,
girlfriend, and apartment in the space of 24 hours, and kidnaps the
dauther (Cameron Diaz) of his ex-boss (Ian Holm).  But the twist is that
these two completely different people (Ewan and Cameron, not Ewan and
Ian or Cameron and Ian) are bound to fall in love because of the help of
two angels (Delroy Lindo and Holly Hunter) who are assigned by the
grumpy Angel Gabriel (Dan Hedaya, perfectly cast) to unite these two in
bliss because God is a little perterbed of the amount of
divorces/seperation/general-love-unrest.</P>
<P>Soon,  the daughter, Celine, is cooped up in a falling-apart house with
her totally inept kidnapper, Robert, who totally forgets to even make
the ransom.  Soon it seems that Celine, who helped herself get
kidnapped, is pretty much running the show, and eventually has become
partners with Robert, whether he likes it or not.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the angels are running around as hired assasins for Ian Holm,
trying desperately to get them together, because if they don't, they
aren't allowed back in heaven.  And soon it seems that they're out for a
lot of money to back themselves up if they don't suceed with their job.</P>
<P>On a plus side, this film IS very funny.  I mean, I laughed a lot of the
time, especially at Robert's inept antics, which are really never
tiresome.  The William Tell deal is also done very well, ending in a
hilarious conclusion, but never used again (which kind of brings to an
empty experience, I suppose).  The style is great, with lots of the
traditonal Boyle film schtuff, like cool camera uses, and a great
soundtrack which blends nearly-perfectly with the action going on.  The
dialogue is very funny, but then what do you expect from John Hodge? 
The claymation at the end is humorous, and ends the film nicely.</P>
<P>The acting is also excellent.  Ewan is one of the best young actors
working today, or perhaps one of the best actors in general, and he
shows great prospects in comedy.  He has a great sense of comedy, and is
easily likable and sympathetic.  He also has a bit of singing to do, and
he sounds mysteriously like Liam Gallagher from Oasis.  Also, Cameron is
one of the better young actresses, someone who can do big budget flicks
like "The Mask" and "My Best Friend's Wedding," and then slip into indie
fare, like "The Last Supper."  The two of them have great chemistry
together, trying to hit the notes that people like Clark Gable and
Claudette Colbert hit in flicks like "It Happened One Night."</P>
<P>Also good are the two angels, Delroy Lindo and Holly Hunter, and, yeah,
they're two of the best actors out today too (this is getting redundant,
eh?).  In smaller roles, Ian Holm is a cold and funny evil boss/father,
Maury Chaykin is a bizarre backwoodsman who befriends the two
protagonists, Stanley Tucci is a perfect egotistical dentist (who
suffers an accident in one of the first scenes), Dan Hedaya (as I said)
is a flawless Gabriel, and Tony Shalhoub is good in the one scene he has
where he speaks (and we learn once again the horrible truth that his
italian accent is not real).</P>
<P>But.  The film has so much, goes in so many directions, and wants to be
so much, that it just falls apart.  The last half hour or so are
muddled, and the humor is never as hysterical as it should be.  The
karaoke scene should be absolutely mesmerizing, wonderful, and
side-splittingly funny, but it's just fractions of all those.  The angel
subplot, which is a nice idea, is not used to its fullest extent, but
ends on a very good note.  And the film isn't as greatly plotted as it
should be.  The plot should be more frantic, and more tightly-plotted,
which I suppose is Hodge's fault, but I suppose Boyle had a bit to do
with that.  And the direction, while being very stylistic, is still too
American.  In fact, the first scene, which parodies a Quentin movie,
isn't as hysterical as it should or could be.  This is typical of
modern-day romantic comedies, and the only thing saving this is the
black comedy, which isn't as good as it should be either.</P>
<P>Anyone who knows me knows that I worship the brilliant ground that the
team of Boyle/Hodge/MacDonald/McGregor walk on, but this group has made
one slip-up, which is okay.  It seems that a director (or team's) early
flims involve at least one bad film in the first three or four.  While
it's usually the second, it can be the third (like Quentin's "Four
Rooms," if you count that as a film).  Therefore, I think that they will
rebound nicely and realize the mistakes they made with this film.</P>
<P>I just want to say that although it's disapointing, I still had a good
time.  This isn't a bad film at all, just a near-miss.  It's quirky,
it's funny, it's violent, and it's slightly romantic, but it's never all
at once.  If they had found a great balance for it, then this would have
been a great flick.  But, it's not, and therefore the film suffers a
bit.  But even if it's not a great film, it's at least a good film, and
worth a viewing or two.</P>
