<PRE>A Christmas Story (1983)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 81</PRE>
<P>Back in December, the cable station TNT showed "A Christmas Story"
twelve consecutive times.  The film has become the most televised
Christmas movie, relegating "It's a Wonderful Life" to benchwarmer
status.</P>
<P>It is a story of about one month of Ralphie's life.  Ralphie
is a boy, about nine years old, growing up in a middle class
neighborhood during the (late?) 1930s.  He dreams of getting
a BB gun for Christmas, waits anxiously for his Little Orphan
Annie package to arrive in the mail, and suffers indignities
at the hands of the local bully.  The narrator is Ralphie
grown up, and his nostalgic and whimsical (but never patronizing)
comments bring across what it feels like to be a kid.
My favorite narrated line is "getting ready for school was
like preparing for deep sea diving", delivered as the kid
brother is weighed down by layers of winter clothing.</P>
<P>Darren McGavin plays Ralphie's father.  His character is
excitable and gregarious, and he plays it so winningly that
you forget that he is old enough to be Ralphie's grandfather.</P>
<P>Why is "A Christmas Story" so popular?  Because it's funny!
It is a rare comedy in which nearly all the scenes work, and
repeated viewings only add to the fun, since one catches things
that were missed the first time around.  For example, before the
mother sets out to "accidently" break father's ridiculous 
leg lamp, she has a knowing look on her face and has waited until
father is distracted by fighting the wheezing furnace.  And when
father whispers to mother the shocking obscenity that Ralphie
had just uttered, his young brother leans forward to overhear
with a huge grin on his face.</P>
<P>There is a department store Santa who definitely does not have
the Christmas spirit, and his elf helpers are even more surly
than he is.  One of the most intimidating Santas in film history,
it is no wonder that kids start crying as soon as they are dragged
by elf helpers to his lap.  Great stuff.</P>
<P>Only a few minor criticisms.  A joke about the word 'fragile'
doesn't come off.  Also, the film may have been secretly funded
by the milk lobby, as many kitchen scenes feature a large, full
milk bottle, and then there's the decoder ring secret...</P>
