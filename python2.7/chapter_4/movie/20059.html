<P>In 1978, when he was still a protégé of Steven Spielberg's, Robert
Zemeckis directed a film entitled 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand', named after
the hit song by the Beatles and the story revolved around a group of New
Jersey teenagers in 1964 who take a road trip to New York City to see
the Beatles live on the Ed Sullivan Show.  It gave us a look at their
antics as the mischief and misadventures they got into were entertaining
as sort of a second class version of 'American Graffiti'.  The funny
thing about the film was that it worked because it didn't try and do
anything else besides entertain.  Ditto with 'Detroit Rock City'.  </P>
<P>Set in the year 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand' was made, 1978, a group of
Cleveland teenagers do anything they can to see what they say is the
greatest rock and roll band of all time, KISS.  There is Hawk (Edward
Furlong), Lex (Giuseppe Andrews), Trip (James DeBello) and Jam (Sam
Huntington).  This quartet of misguided youth sort of grow on you after
a while and you'll swear you knew someone like each one of them when you
were their age.  They have a band entitled Mystery.  They illustrate the
letter 's' in their band after the letters 's' in KISS and anyone who
knows KISS' style of design will know what I'm talking about.  </P>
<P>There always seems to be a monkey in the wrench that prevents young
people from having a good time and often rebelling because of it.  In
this case it's Jam's religiously fanatical mother, who says that KISS
stands for Knights In Satan's Service.  The opening scene has Jam's
mother taking out a vinyl record from a cover labeled after the
Carpenters and it turns out to be a mix-up as a KISS record plays and
Jam's mother goes into a frenzy of anger and frustration.  She
eventually finds the four tickets the lads have to see KISS down the
road a ways along Lake Erie in Detroit and she burns the tickets.  After
taking a Volvo belonging to one of their parents, they have to find an
alternate plan to see the concert and try at every turn to get in and
get more and more desperate as the film moves along.</P>
<P>Adam Rifkin, who has directed 'Denial', 'Welcome to Hollywood' and 'The
Chase', keeps 'Detroit Rock City' moving along in an extremely leisurely
manner.  You come out feeling good, as if you've had a vacation.  It's
also the kind of film that makes you a little embarrassed to admit you
like it.  The thing that makes the film work more than anything else are
the bizarre confrontations.  There are Jam's encounters with his mother,
the four teenagers confront a group of mean spirited disco lovers on
Interstate 90 and there are some hilarious confrontations with anyone
who stands in the way of the guys trying to see the concert.</P>
<P>Filmed in Scarborough, Toronto and Hamilton Ontario, Canada, the film
looks very authentic in its depiction of the U.S. and the era in which
its set, 1978.  The mischievous teenagers are convincing and like in
every good movie of its kind, one of them is a scene stealer.  Writer
Carl V. Dupre has the dialogue and style of the late seventies down
perfectly.  In a decade that gets a lot of ridicule for its fashions and
certain music, it also happens to be the decade with some of the best
rock music and some of the best movies ever made.  Like the seventies,
'Detroit Rock City' turns out to be nothing more than a guilty pleasure
as a party film for the summer, but that's all it needs to be and is a
refreshing look at teenage antics in a recent slide where so many of
them have just plain failed.</P>
