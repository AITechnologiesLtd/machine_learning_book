<P>MIFUNE A film review by Athan Bezaitis.  Copyright Filmcritic.com 2000</P>
<P>In 1995, Danish directors Lars Von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg
established a code of ethics for an alternative form of filmmaking.  The
two directors were fed up by the way in which movie making was "raped"
by technology such as special effects, expensive gear, cranes, filters,
dollies, and spotlights.  They wisely knew that they could never measure
up to the Americans in that area, so they decided that European
filmmaking should head in an all-together different direction.  The
result was a vow of chastity complete with the ten commandments of what
they called Dogma filmmaking.  Some of these groundbreaking rules
included: on location shooting without the ability to bring in props,
the rule that music will not be used unless it occurs where the scene is
being shot, the camera must be hand-held, optical work and filters are
forbidden, and the films must not contain superficial action such as
murders, weapons, etc.  The purpose was to force a director to think
along unconventional and imaginative lines in order to create a Dogma
film, and the first two attempts, Vinterberg's THE CELEBRATION, and Von
Trier's THE IDIOTS, were both successful.</P>
<P>Director Soren Kragh-Jacobsen's MIFUNE, is the third film from the
Danish Dogma Collective.  Subtitled in English, it is the story of
Kresten (Anders W. Berhelsen) who has become an overnight sensation as a
businessman in Copenhagen.  The morning after his wedding to the boss'
daughter, he receives a phone call that his estranged father has just
died.  He has trouble explaining this to his wife, since he has told
everyone in the city that he has no living relatives, in attempt to
disguise his humble origins.  Now he must return to the family's run
down farm to bury his father and make arrangements to hide the truth of
his mentally retarded brother from his new family and friends.</P>
<P>Caught in a pack of lies with his in-laws, he comes up with a desperate
plan to advertise for a housekeeper to look after his brother.  But when
the beautiful Liva (Iben Hjejle) arrives, she only complicates things
for Kristen.  Liva also is not what she seems.  Out of a need to keep
her rebellious younger brother Bjarke (Emil Tarding) in private school,
she's been working as a high-class prostitute in Copenhagen.  Now she's
on the run from her pimp and a mysterious man who has been threatening
her on the phone.  When the two come together they get caught in a
whirlwind of hysteria as their troubles begin to compound.</P>
<P>The film is excellent, and the Dogma style only adds to the originality
of the production.  Supposedly, there is one scene with music being
played on a bent drainpipe, and another with an instrumentalist hiding
in a ditch.  The idea for the original Danish title ("Mifunes Sidste
Sang," literally "Mifune's Last Song") came to Dragh-Jacobsen when
Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune died in 1997.  In THE SEVEN SAMURAI by
director Akira Kurosawa, Mifune plays a phony samurai of peasant
origins.  The parallel is evident..</P>
<P>The Danish are really onto something with the proliferation of the Dogma
style.  Find out where MIFUNE is playing and enjoy it.  It's worth the
extra effort, and it's a breath of fresh air from the stale stench of
the overblown Hollywood mega-productions.</P>
