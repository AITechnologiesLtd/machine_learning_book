Mickey Blue Eyes</PRE>
<PRE> By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>A single delivery truck attempts to give this film a good name ("Ross
Movers") during the opening sequence. Unfortunately,the goods are a day late
and a dollar short -- how apropos of the film itself.</P>
<P>Hugh falls for Jeanne. Jeanne's pop (Caan) is Mafia; ditto for rest of the
males in her family. She fears for the corruption of her soon-to-be hubby.
"Mickey Blue Eyes" is the step by step account of that corruption. This
occurs in a rather unstructured way that gives the film little movement
until the third act (last half hour) in which an interesting and amusing
sting plan is conceived, flubbed, and twisted.</P>
<P>Poor editing plagues the picture, especially in the first act. A scene in a
Chinese restaurant could have been funny, but falls on its face due to
poorly-timed and over-abundant edits. Dry-whitted Grant is cute and
charming, but trudges through painfully flat film moments that made me
wince.</P>
<P>The handful of times that Hugh tries to act like a tough New York Italian
gangster are really quite entertaining. They may, in fact, be the most
amusing moments of the film. But they are a rarity in this back and forth
love story, Mel Brooks-like farce, "Get Shorty"-wannabe picture.</P>
<P>Starring Hugh Grant, Jeanne Tripplehorn, James Caan.
Directed by Kelly Makin. Written by Adam Scheinman and Robert Kuhn.
Produced by Elizabeth Hurley and Charles Mulvehill at Simian/Castle Rock.
Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>Grade..........................B-</P>
