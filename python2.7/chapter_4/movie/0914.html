<PRE>                                 THE VANISHING
                       A film review by Paultje Bakker
                        Copyright 1991 Paultje Bakker</PRE>
<P>     Have you ever gone to a public place, like a shopping centre, or a
pool, or a petrol station, and lost track of your friend/
sibling/wife/husband/child?  Have they then inexplicably failed to show
up at a pre-arranged meeting place, leaving you to torture yourself with
horrible thoughts about what might have happened to them?</P>
<P>     This is the topic of the newly released Dutch film, THE VANISHING.
This is no horror movie, and yet it can be very scary; it evokes that 
mildly terrifying experience of loss and panic that most of us have had.</P>
<P>     Although it's a Dutch movie, most of the dialogue is in French and
almost all of the action is set in France.  It's about a young Dutch
couple who drive to France for their summer holiday, as young Dutch
couples tend to do.  They stop at a petrol station, and red-headed
Saskia goes inside to buy a Coke and a Beer.  She never returns.  Her
husband (Rolf?) freaks out, but is unable to locate her and eventually
has to return to Holland.  For three years he runs a desperate poster
campaign to locate her.  Then, .... well, I don't want to spoil it for
you!  Suffice to say that the plot takes a devious turn, and the movie
climaxes in one of the  most surprising and emotional endings I have
ever seen.</P>
<P>     And most distressing of all, it's 100% believable.  SEE THIS MOVIE!
and if anyone tries to tell you the ending, KILL THEM!</P>
<P>     It's currently showing in Brisbane; I don't know about any other
cities.</P>
