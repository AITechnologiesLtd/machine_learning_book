<PRE>                                 GROOVE
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     According to Groove, the economics of throwing a rave:  Charge $2 a
head for some 200 people to inhabit an abandoned warehouse for one
night.  Provide free food, water, massages, and of course, music from a
parade of 5 or 6 DJs.  Sounds like a losing proposition to me.</P>
<P>     In fact, the last time I went to a rave (in 1991, when the scene
was already on its way out), it cost $8.  Today, it's like $20.
Groove's $2 rave sounds a little phony, a little dated.</P>
<P>     While Groove was the talk of Sundance (and for an entire year the
talk of San Francisco -- where it was shot and where I live), it seems
hopelessly unable to live up to its hype, a la The Blair Witch Project.
Counting conservatively, it's the fourth movie set in the rave scene to
hit theaters in the last year.  And by my account, it does the least
with the throbbing rave lifestyle of all of them.</P>
<P>     Why?  Because Groove, while ostensibly about "one night in the San
Francisco rave scene" is really about one night in the lives of a bunch
of Bay Area twentysomethings.  Mostly, they're Berkeley
twentysomethings, best known for their ability to whine about just about
anything.</P>
<P>     Berkeley twentysomethings like to talk a lot, and in Groove, that's
what they do.  One minute they get out on the dance floor, then they
retire to a back room or the basement to chit-chat, then a new DJ comes
out, and the cycle repeats.  Through this conceit, we are introduced to
people like Leyla (Lola Glaudini), a New York transplant looking to hook
up with the scene in SF, and David (Hamish Linklater), a Midwestern rave
newcomer.  Then there's David's brother Colin (Denny Kirkwood) and his
girlfriend Harmony (Mackenzie Firgens), to whom Colin intends to
propose... only later we find him making out with some guy.  Later, the
moral of the entire tale is spat out by Rachel True's character near the
end: "Eat dinner before you take drugs."  Huh?  This story is right out
of 90210.  No, it's worse than 90210.</P>
<P>     While Groove - the story is pretty limp, Groove - the slice of life
examining today's counterculture is far better realized.  Watching the
DJs (all real-life rave disc jockeys) interact with the (teensy) crowd
is probably the most fun there is to have in the movie.  Considering its
small budget, the set design and production values are uniformly high.
Groove looks more like Go than any indie flick.  That's impressive.</P>
<P>     Again, it's the pedestal that the crowd of Groove (and its
filmmakers) put DJs upon that makes the film so intriguing.  Who knew
that people with names like Polywog and Digweed (a really famous DJ)
would become recognizable on sight to rave aficionados, as famous as any
cut-rate film critic?  It's enough to make you want to learn how to
spin.</P>
