<P>Hmmm...let's see now. Julia Roberts was adorable in MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING
(7.5/10) and Hugh Grant was adorable in FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL (8/10),
so let's slap 'em together in another romantic comedy written by the same
dude who wrote the latter film, and voila...another great hit! Well...maybe
next time.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Ordinary boy meets extraordinary girl (famous movie star). Boy introduces
girl to friends and family. Boy falls for girl, girl falls for boy. Boy
loses girl to another boy (another famous movie star). Boy sulks. Girl
(still the famous movie star) comes back to boy. Happy once again. Boy loses
girl again. Darn! Girl comes back to boy...etc, etc, etc...well, you get the
picture!</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Very interesting premise starring two charming leads, offers a few chuckles
here and there, an unconvincing romance, languid pacing and a lot of empty
scenes played out specifically for laughs, to the detriment of plot. Add
that to the ending of this film which goes overboard in my opinion, despite
offering us the only true moment of action in the entire bit, and a complete
lack of any real drama, and you've got yourself a ho-hum romantic comedy,
built around a fantasy dream to which we could probably all relate. In fact,
before seeing this film I thought that the premise of this film was a
diamond in the rough, but only if they managed to build something more
around it than just the simple "boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy...".
After seeing this film, I'm afraid to report that there isn't much more in
there, folks.</P>
<P>Frankly, that would be fine if the actors in the film were convincing enough
in their roles, but I must say that I was far from convinced of anything
more than a simple novelty crush on a fidgety Englishman from the part of
Julia Roberts' character. And Hugh, well, every scene he was in basically
had him looking like a common Brit who was absolutely overwhelmed and in awe
of an American movie actress. Not in love with a woman. In awe of an
actress. I never FELT like either of these characters ever really cared for
one another as people, especially in the case of Hugh, who could not help
but look like a wounded puppy dog in every scene (blinking eyes and all),
whilst delivering some of the wittiest repartee this side of a
screenwriter's sharpest word processor. The supporting cast was pretty good,
but used strategically for laughs, and not much else. Admittedly, some of
the things that they were saying went right over my head (English accents
and all). Overall, a video rental at best, with a few grins here and around,
a fun and dreamy premise, but ultimately too repetitive, unconvincing and
just plain boring, to recommend with any enthusiasm.</P>
<P>Go rent WHEN HARRY MET SALLY (10/10) again, and thank me in the morning :)</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Hugh Grant received $1,000,000 for his role in this movie. Julia Roberts
received $15,000,000 for her role.
Julia Roberts turned down the female lead in SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE (5.5/10).
At the time, Daniel Day-Lewis was attached to co-star in the film opposite
her. She once tried out for a part on the TV soap "All My Children", but was
turned down. She is left-handed and stands 5'9". Bra size: 34B.
In 1995, Hugh Grant was arrested for lewd conduct after cops found him with
Divine Brown, a prostitute, in his car (She was apparently making on him,
like a monkey makes a banana). He pleaded no contest and got a $1,180 fine
and two years' probation. This is a man who graduated from Oxford
University.
Screenwriter Richard Curtis based the film in the backdrop of his own
residency, Notting Hill, a vibrant West London suburb. He is born in New
Zealand, and began writing comedy after leaving Oxford University in 1978.
He created the TV program "Mr. Bean" alongside Rowan Atkinson.</P>
