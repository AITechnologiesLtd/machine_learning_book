<PRE>                             IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER
                        A film review by Katherine Wickiser
                         Copyright 1993 Katherine Wickiser</PRE>
<P>Based on the true story of the Conlon Four</P>
<P>Starring:  Daniel Day-Lewis and Emma Thompson
Rating:  9.9999999999999999999/10</P>
<P>     This movie was INCREDIBLE!!!!!!  American Express has been showing
previews of movies for their loyal card members and I just happen to
know one of them who couldn't go to the show.  So, you guessed it, I
went in his place.  And it is something that I will be eternally
grateful for.</P>
<PRE>     As you might be able to tell this is my first try at a written
review so please bare with me.</PRE>
<P>     This movie is based on the true story of the CONLON FOUR who were
wrongly accused of the bombing of a London pub.  The movie starts out
in Belfast, Northern Ireland and shows the British military occupying
the city.  Daniel Day-Lewis plays Gerard (Gerry for short), a young man
struggling to live with the military watching his every move (the
British vs. the I.R.A.).</P>
<P>     I haven't cried so hard and for so long in a movie.  The movie is
a gut-wrenching tale of innocent people sentenced to prison for a
bombing that was done by the I.R.A.</P>
<P>     The acting was fantastic.  As usual Daniel Day-Lewis submerged
into his character so much in fact that I kept on asking my self is
that him????</P>
<P>     I am sorry that I am so sketch on details but PLEASE go see this
movie it is definitely worth seeing more than once.</P>
<P>     Since I am so "not gifted" in writing this if you have any other
questions you can e-mail me at <A HREF="mailto:kw2m+@andrew.cmu.edu.">kw2m+@andrew.cmu.edu.</A></P>
<PRE>GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
