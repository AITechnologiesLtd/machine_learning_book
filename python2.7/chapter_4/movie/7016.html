Running time: 109 min. </PRE>
<P>Spoiler Alert: The following review is full of spoilers.  Be aware and
stop while you can if you don't want to lose the suspense!!!</P>
<P>        It doesn't happen that often, but it happened today -- I walked
out of the cinema with shamelessly wet eyes and don't know how to explain
it.
         The film is the Russian production "Prisoner of the Mountains."
It's a story about 2 Russian soldiers captured in the civil war in Chechen
by some village people.  It is inspired by a Leo Tolstoy's short story
written 100 years ago.  Stunned by how perfectly it fits today's
situation, my friend who watch the film with me said afterward: "I thought
we were much civilized by now."  Well, we are.  Instead of horses, we have
tanks; intead of swords, we have machine guns and helicopters and bombs.
It is amazing how little we have evolved and such a theme about war and
human spirits in the war is so unexpectedly timeless. 
        In the beginning of the film, a group of Russian soldiers are
ambushed in the mountains by Muslin villagers.  Bruised but alive,
the only 2 survivors were taken hostage by a village elder Mehamed Murat,
who planns to trade them for his only son who is imprisoned by the
Russians in town.  Veteran actor Oleg Menshikov plays the older, more
cynical soldier Sasha;  while the director's son Sergei Bodrov Jr. plays a
naive young man newly drafted and inexperienced in the war.  Chained
together, the two men first do not get along, but soon develop a
friendship and bond in the desperate situation.  
        As time goes on, the 2 prisoners also grow fond of the village
people, among which are Murat's daughter, a cute teenage girl with some
very real headaches in life, and their mute guard Hassan, who has an
emotional story in his past.  Yet, as Sasha says to his young friend,
"It's war, Vanya, you have to (kill them)."  And he did, in an attempt to
escape.  It is chilling to see how the people who are basically good are
capable of killing in cold blood, from both sides.  
        Like an invisible hand, the powerful bureaucratic machine that
initiated the meaningless war has made a simple hostage trade into a
mission impossible.  Vanya's desperate mother comes down to the village
and fights with teeth and nails to save her son while Mehamed Murat trying
to save his own, who is a teacher, not a soldier, but just another
casualty of the war.  The showdown goes on and the situation gets more and
more impossible to resolve, until the writers of the film utterly
eliminate all the possible ways for Vanya to survive the fate of being
executed.  The ending is an incredible payoff that first took me aback,
but became more and more logical as I chew on it.  
        The acting and cinematography of this film are quite interesting.
They look very crude in the beginning and all the villagers look like
local people temporarily turned actors.  It is too real to be real for a
movie.  The cinematography is undoubtedly beautiful in the portrayal of
the magnificent mountains and harsh land where these villagers have lived
for hundreds of years.  But there is never an over-the-top shot that
shouts out "I'm Oscar material."  The filmmakers present the story, the
scenery and the Muslin villagers' lives and cuture with such realism,
patience and subtlety that they fooled me for at least half an hour.  The
only "visible" acting is Oleg Menshikov's Sasha as the flashy and witty
joker.  Everyone else is low-keyed and real as if walking out of a
documentary, yet incredibly interesting and intriguing.  The characters
are so real and presented to effortlessly that I never stop and think
about their authenticity until way after the movie.  No one in this film
is flat, yet no one is glamerous or conventional in any way.  Even the
weary commander is interesting with only several scenes.  And the actor
who plays Mehamed Murat (whose name is too long for me to remember) goes
through the entire film solemnly and almost expressionlessly.  It was not
until I stepped out of the cinema did I realize his great delivery of the
role.  Quite amazing.  Everything is done way too realistically that you
let the effort of the filmmakers and actors slip by unnoticed.  I have
never seen anything quite like this. 
        Above all, it's a story about issues beyond one war or the concept
of war.  It's a complicated study of human hearts and spirits, both the
great dignity and compassion AND the horror and stupidity we are capable
of.  It is a lesson, all too real, all too contemporary and all too
universal.  I think it can be done so perfectly only by Russian artists.
Anyone else who attempts to tell the same story would probably fall into
melodrama and unsincerity.  The theme and idea are presented so
effortlessly and so effectively that we cannot but sigh with appreciation.
        The theme is heavy, but delivered in a quiet and smooth way.  The
middle part of the film is actually quite humorous (a trait I thought
Russians didn't have).  The ending is captivating, surprising but logical.
It is sort of happy, but also sad, and above that, it's uplifting.  It
makes me feel better about us and mankind as a whole.  It presents hope
after all for the world that maybe, perhaps, we can still make it out of
this swamp of killing, war, hatred and ignorance and idiocy.  
        It is a great film, an unforgetable experience.  I give it an A+.
Go see it.</P>
