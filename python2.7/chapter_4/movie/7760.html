<PRE>                                   BREAKDOWN
                      A film review by David N. Butterworth
          Copyright 1997 David N. Butterworth/The Summer Pennsylvanian</PRE>
<PRE>Here's a rare bird:</PRE>
<P>"Breakdown," a top-notch thriller in which the protagonists act sensibly
and responsibly throughout.  Credit goes to director Jonathan Mostow, who
wrote the compelling story that never lets up, draws a terrific performance
from leading man Kurt Russell, and gives this tale a sensational,
white-knuckled ending.</P>
<P>When Jeff (Russell) and Amy's (Kathleen Quinlan) car breaks down in the
vast, desolate landscape of America's southwest, a friendly truck driver
Red (J.T. Walsh) offers them a ride into town.  Jeff is reluctant to leave
the vehicle, so Amy goes on ahead, arranging to meet her husband at the
local diner.  However, when Jeff discovers the problem with the car (a
loose wire under the hood) and next meets up with Red, the trucker claims
never to have seen him before.</P>
<P>To reveal any more of the plot would be irresponsible.  Suffice it to say
that the twists and turns of the script mirror those of the road ahead for
Jeff and Amy.</P>
<P>The film has many strengths yet perhaps its greatest is that, at its core,
it's extremely believable.  What befalls this hapless couple, who are
driving across the desert as part of a West Coast relocation, and how they
react to the situations, ring true.</P>
<P>Russell, who often plays swaggering, larger-than-life macho figures (in his
work with John Carpenter, for example), tones things down considerably
here.  His Jeff is an everyday Joe, clearly scared by increasingly bizarre
and frightening circumstances.  These circumstances do eventually drive him
to boiling point, yet it's understandable when he's forced to fight for his
and his wife's survival.</P>
<P>An example of the film's maturity is a scene in a bank.  Russell's
character, desperately trying to find a way out of his predicament, digs
around in a janitor's closet looking for a weapon.  The best he can come up
with is the handle of a sink plunger.  Jeff throws it down in disgust; the
search has come to nothing, but we can clearly relate to Jeff's frustration
and growing anxiety.</P>
<P>Superior acting, writing, and directing:  keys to an excellent movie.  And
"Breakdown," a smart, compelling, and absolutely plausible road thriller,
has got all three.</P>
