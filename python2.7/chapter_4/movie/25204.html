<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A most intriguing courtroom drama involving a brutal murder, interracial
sex and racial prejudice, adapted from Howard Frank Mosher's New England
Book Award winning novel, loosely based on a true story in Irasburg,
Vermont, about a black minister and his son who come to rural northern
Vermont in 1952 to preach to a white congregation.</P>
<P>When Walter Andrews, (Ernie Hudson) arrives in Kingdom County with his
teenage son Nathan (Sean Nelson), he is considered a fish out of water
and is subject to racial taunts by a few of the residents, surprised
that their new pastor is black. He was hired over the phone, as the
leading citizens were impressed by his record as an Army chaplain for
the last 16 years and did not realize he was black.</P>
<P>When an attractive and fiery young French woman, Claire LaRivierre
(Jordan Bayne), arrives penniless from Quebec to be a housekeeper for
the ornery drunkard Resolved Kinneson (Bill Raymond), at about the same
time the pastor arrives, she becomes another stranger around to upset
the provincial small town.</P>
<P>The film makes it a point to show that the fictional region has its
quota of local eccentrics, many of whom are related to one another. The
law is also shown to be arbitrary in the county, as the illegal
cockfights which are supposed to be banned are not. Charlie Kinneson
(David Lansbury) as the town's defense attorney is the lone voice of
reason. His cousin is Resolved, an old-timer with a penchant for doing
mischief, such as robbing a bank, is usually seen carrying a rifle on
him to back up his angry mood swings. He also believes that the Martians
have landed in town and is Charlie's main client. Elijah Kinneson
(Aldredge) is the church sexton, and is another cousin of Charlie's. His
father killed the town's only other black resident in the late 1800s, a
freed slave he brought to town but later on became disappointed with his
liberal attitude. The father died in a mental institution,  raving like
a lunatic. Frenchie LaMott (Segal) is a friendly but bigoted young man
who is in love with Claire, but doesn't know how to meet her, asking
Nathan for his help in introducing him. Harlan Kittredge (Rusty de Wees)
provides Kingdom County with its illicit nightlife--cockfights, strip
shows--and is an avowed racist, going so far as to call Reverend Andrews
a nigger, whereby he gets a broken jaw. And then there's Sheriff White
(George Dickerson), who hates blacks and enforces the law based on his
personal feelings.</P>
<P>The trouble starts when Claire can't stay any longer with the lecherous
Resolved, who wants only to bed down with her. Running away from him,
she goes to fun-loving Charlie' trailer and is discovered there by the
jealous Athena (Kelly), the young woman Charlie is engaged to. After
talking with Claire, Athena decides to help her and asks the Reverend
Andrews to put her up in his spare bedroom.</P>
<P>But Claire tries to take Charlie away from Athena and loses our sympathy
for her plight. She turns out to be a very mixed up young woman, who
will run away from the pastor's house to stay with Harlan, only to
return when he comes onto her sexually. Later on, Claire will be found
in the creek by the quarry, shot five times, and during the trial of her
accused murderer, Reverend Andrews, it will come out that she is
pregnant.</P>
<P>Martin Sheen makes a cameo as the state's visiting prosecuting attorney,
as he is called in to help the county's incompetent prosecutor (Gibson).</P>
<P>For the most part, the film is done in a campy way, balanced by veteran
character actor Ernie Hudson playing his role seriously, taking offense
at the racial slurs and showing that he's a powerful man, willing to
take a strong stand for what he believes in.</P>
<P>Jay Craven (Where the Rivers Flow North) has come through with a strong
independent film, clearly showing there is racial prejudice everywhere
in America, not just the South. This is a very compelling story, aside
from the weakness of Claire's role, where she acts more campy than real.
The film is most similar in racial tone to "To Kill a Mockingbird," but
is played more humorously and with less drive for its interracial sexual
motives being the source for the crime.</P>
