<PRE>                             STAR TREK: GENERATIONS
                       A film review by Jeffrey Graebner
                        Copyright 1994 Jeffrey Graebner</PRE>
<P>     Over the past 27 years, "Star Trek" has grown into a phenomenon
that is essentially unmatched in the entertainment world.  Gene
Roddenberry's original idea has now spawned four TV series (with a
fifth starting next year) and seven theatrical motion pictures.  There
are also numerous books and other merchandising.  All of this history
makes STAR TREK: GENERATIONS a tricky film to review.  It needs to be
discussed in terms of its own merits as a film while also looking at
how it fits into the entire "Star Trek" universe.</P>
<P>     This seventh film in the series is the first to feature the cast
of "Star Trek: The Next Generation" lead by Captain Jean-Luc Picard
(Patrick Stewart).  From the original "Star Trek" (and the six previous
films), Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) has a supporting role
while Scotty (James Doohan) and Chekov (Walter Koenig) make cameo
appearances early in the film.  All of the "Next Generation" cast
members that were still with the show at the end of its seven-season
run appear in the film.</P>
<P>     The principal villain in the film is Soran (Malcolm McDowell) a
madman who is struggling to return to the mysterious "Nexus," a place
where fantasies become reality.  The entrance is a strange "ribbon"
that travels through space.  Attempts to fly a ship into the Nexus
simply result in the ship being destroyed.  Soran's plan is to alter
the course of the ribbon to allow him to jump into it from the surface
of a planet.  This is accomplished by causing stars to collapse thus
generating gravitational fields that will require the ribbon to change
its course.  Picard and his crew discover his plan and must stop him
before he wipes out an entire civilization.</P>
<P>     This plot is rather ridiculous, but the biggest problem is that it
is also the most confusing plot that has yet been used in a "Star Trek"
movie.  In addition, there are several secondary subplots going on. The
film would have been helped a great deal if the script had been
simplified.  The screenplay is by Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga
from a story by Moore, Braga and producer Rick Berman.  All three came
directly from "Star Trek: The Next Generation" and the film includes
some of the same weaknesses that plagued the last few seasons of that
series.</P>
<P>     The single biggest problem that has been inherited from the series
is the cheat of solving problems by having the characters using
invented technical jargon and unexplained gadgets.  The earlier movies
did all use a lot of invented science, but it was always *explained* in
clear terms within the world of the film.  It was always clear what the
equipment or terms were and what they would do.  That isn't true during
many parts of STAR TREK: GENERATIONS.  Even the central phenomenon of
the "Nexus" is never particularly well explained.</P>
<P>     The script also suffers from a lack of focus.  The movie includes
several subplots that are not really that closely tied into the main
plot.  The most notable of these involves the android Data (Brent
Spiner) adjustment to a new chip that allows him to experience
emotions.  This subplot provides some of the film's best scenes (and
much of its comic relief) as well as the most significant character
development.  The writers never quite manage to tie it in with the rest
of the film, though.  This subplot is very good, but it seems to be
coming from a different movie.</P>
<P>     A subplot involving the Duras sisters, a pair of renegate Klingons
who were originally introduced on the TV series, is integrated a little
better.  It was kind of a shame that they insisted on including
villainous Klingons in this film.  They could have easily been replaced
by Romulans or some other Federation enemy without undermining the fact
that one of the biggest differences between the original series and
"The Next Generation" is the fact that Klingons are now *allies* of the
Federation.  The only hint of this fact in the film is the presense of
Worf (Michael Dorn) on the Enterprise bridge crew.</P>
<P>     Despite the film's script problems, there are some aspects of the
film that are *extremely* good.  The film's biggest asset is a cast who
know their characters well and who clearly work well together.  The
"Next Generation" cast members have built up seven years worth of
familiarity and chemistry all of which clearly shines through in the
film.  Some of the cast members are severely underutilized
(particularly Gates McFadden as Dr. Crusher, who is barely in the
movie), but with the exception of the fourth film (still the best of the
series), all of the "Star Trek" movies have tended to concentrate on
certain cast members to the exclusion of others.  It is very difficult
to give a lot of screen time to every member of such a large cast.</P>
<P>     Scotty and Chekov make their appearances during the film's opening
sequence in which they join Kirk in the dedication of the Enterprise-B
(The ship that was decommissioned at the end of STAR TREK VI: THE
UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY was the Enterprise-A while the ship flown by the
"Next Generation" cast is the Enterprise-D.)  This sequence exists
primarily to set up Kirk's entry into the Nexus so he can later emerge
in the "Next Generation" time frame.  Still, it was a nice touch to
include a couple of the other members of the original cast and they do
have some good scenes together.  It is rather obvious that the scenes
were originally written for Mr. Spock and Dr.  McCoy, though.  They
even have Chekov helping out in sick bay at one point.</P>
<P>     Kirk's presense in the film is clearly intended to ease the
transition of the movies from the old cast to the new.  I'm not
convinced that was entirely necessary (the new cast has had seven TV
seasons to build an audience), but the scenes between Kirk and Picard
are generally enjoyable.  It is nice to see these two characters
meeting face to face.  Over the years, "Star Trek" fans have spent a
lot of time discussing the significant *differences* between Kirk and
Picard, but this film actually concentrates more on the
*similarities*.  The two characters are more alike than one might
think.  It is a bit unfortunate that none of the scenes of Kirk and
Picard together are on the bridge of a Starship.  They missed the
opportunity to allow some first hand comparisons of the two captains'
different ways of commanding a ship.</P>
<P>     The technical aspects of the film are competent, but not always
spectacular.  At times, the TV origins of producer Berman and director
David Carson are noticeable.  The movie is filmed in Panavision, but the
whole frame is rarely used.  Industrial Light and Magic has provided
some very competent special effects for the film, but only two
sequences really allow them to shine.  The first is a wonderful scene
in a Stellar Cartography room on the Enterprise. This really shows off
some of ILM's computer graphics skills.  The second great special
effects sequence can't be described without giving away a key plot
point, but viewers will know it when they see it.</P>
<P>     For the score, Dennis McCarthy has a larger orchestra to work with
than he did for his TV scores, but it still doesn't sound significantly
different.  McCarthy's score isn't horrible, but it is rather bland.
The "Star Trek" film scores have all had a tough time living up to the
tremendous scores that Jerry Goldsmith wrote for the first and fifth
films and James Horner wrote for the second and third.  Like Leonard
Rosenman's score for STAR TREK IV and Cliff Eidelman's score for STAR
TREK VI, McCarthy's work simply doesn't stack up.  The score lacks a
distinctive main theme and McCarthy also repeats Eidelman's mistake of
failing to open the film with Alexander Courage's famous fanfare.
McCarthy (or possibly Carson) also made the very odd choice of leaving
one key fight scene completely unscored.  That sequence was
*desperately* in need of some music.</P>
<P>     While there are some major problems with STAR TREK:  GENERATIONS,
the film certainly does have enough going for it that it is sure to
please even the most casual fans of the series.  As a regular viewer of
"Star Trek: The Next Generation," it is very difficult for me to say
how the film will play for those that are unfamiliar with the TV show.
The film doesn't take much time to re-introduce the characters (many
long-time "Star Trek" fans were probably somewhat put off by the fact
that STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE *did* spend a lot of time
re-establishing the characters).  The actors all know their characters
well, though, and I suspect that even non-fans may be able to catch
up.</P>
<P>     This is a good first effort for the "Next Generation" cast and
crew and it demonstrates that the new cast certainly can carry
themselves on the big screen.  I look forward to additional films
featuring this cast, but I hope that Berman and co. will be smart
enough to concentrate on their current TV series and to pass the
feature films on to people who are more comfortable with that medium.</P>
<P>     There are two key sequences towards the end of STAR TREK:
GENERATIONS that need to be discussed, but which cannot be mentioned
without giving away key plot points.  As a result, I *strongly* suggest
that readers who have not yet seen the film stop reading here.  The
following paragraphs will reveal two major developments that occur in
the film:</P>
<PRE>[SPOILERS]</PRE>
<P>     The destruction of the Enterprise-D provides the film's most
spectacular special effects sequence and was also a surprisingly bold
move.  Even though this isn't the first time that the Enterprise has
been destroyed in a Star Trek movie (the original Enterprise was
destroyed in STAR TREK III: THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK), this marks the first
time that the ship has actually been destroyed by enemy fire.  In the
past, the ship has seemed largely indestructible and it was great to
see them show that *not* to be the case.</P>
<P>     Most importantly, the destruction of the Enterprise-D will allow
for the upcoming films to separate themselves more from the TV series.
The next movie will have to introduce an all-new ship providing endless
new possibilities.</P>
<P>     Of course, the other key plot "surprise" is the death of Captain
Kirk (although this is probably one of the worst kept secrets in the
history of movies).  I wasn't really pleased by the way that this was
handled.  Kirk is certainly the type of character that needs a big
heroic death, but this one really wasn't right for him.  STAR TREK:
GENERATIONS shows Kirk dying on a distant planet in another time to
save an unshown race of people.  The character really needed to die in
defense of *his* ship and *his* crew.  This death is very unsatisfying
and surprisingly unmoving.</P>
