<P>   A revitalized "Gone With the Wind" with a digitally
remastered sound track opened at about the same time as
"Argmageddon," and surprisingly enough, the two films share
common ideas.  Thematically, both are about the will to
survive in the face of disaster.  In the former story, Scarlett
O'Hara has been reduced to poverty by the devastation of the
Civil War and must use her wiles to subsist.  In the latter, the
entire world must use its cunning to endure a rendezvous with
an asteroid whose trajectory threatens the planet.  There's no
problem getting the young generation to the movies to see
"Armageddon."  But what would a demographic analysis say
about the crowd that views GWTW?  I'd guess that the curve
will be skewed greatly toward the 50+ folks who have seen
the film at least once before--either at its original 1939
opening or during the 1954 or 1961 incarnation, the 1967
widescreen version or the 1989 restoration.  More's the pity. 
GWTW is not simply the sort of story one goes to simply to
reminisce about the favorites of one's youth: it's perhaps the
best example of a classical theatrical romance which even
today does not reveal a single campy bone in its body.  For
all the grand, sentimental sweep of the Old South, the tears
and laughter of archetypal romantics, the stereotypical
portrayals of blacks and bandidos, GWTW is as believable in
today's cynical world as it was in the thirties when the crowds
packed the theaters for mushy fantasies.  And for those of us
who took our history classes in Northern schools and simply
assumed that the antebellum New Yorkers were the good
guys and the Georgians the reb terrorists, Margaret Mitchell's
account--sweepingly brought to the screen by David O.
Selznik (the Spielberg of his day)--portrays looting, "white-
trash" Yankess despoiling the gentility of the Confederates. 
Even the American Film Institute cannot be criticized for
putting this historical romance on its all-time best-100 list,
where it ranks close to "Citizen Kane" as The Great American
Movie.</P>
<P>   "Gone With the Wind" considers the dramatic changes
which take place in the American South between the period of
1861 and 1873.  The transfigururation is reflected in its chief
character, Scarlett O'Hara (Vivian Leigh), who mutates from a
spoiled, self-indulgent, strong-willed flirt, into a mature, giving,
and equally strong-willed woman.  In the role that any actress
would die for, Vivian Leigh portrays a bright-eyed, beautiful
southern belle residing on the lovely Tara plantation in
Georgia who is as sturdy as any woman of the 1930s (when
the film was first introduced) or even of modern times.  She
remins in love with a wishy-washy but genteel Ashley Wilkes
(Leslie Howard) even after he marries the saintly Melanie
Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland).  Ashley's flaw is that he never
convincingly rebuffs Scarlett's advances but as interpreted by
director Victor Fleming, he leads her to believe that he would
abandon his wife for Scarlett in a moment if only his honor did
not hold him back.  One of the intriguing puzzles of the film, in
fact, is Ashley's mbiguousness.  We puzzle to decipher the
man's true feelings throughout the work's entire 238 minutes,
his mild encouragement to Scarlett leading her to ultimate
comeuppance.</P>
<P>   Fleming received the combined help of an army of
directors, including George Cukor, Sam Wood, William
Cameron Menzies and Sidney Franklin in attempting to
overome the difficulties both on and off the set of GWTW.
Even on celluloid you'd  guess that Clark Gable (Rhett Butler),
the Robert Redford of his time, was a drinker and womanizer
in real life, and Vivian Leigh was a drug-abuser who treated
men off stage in much the manner that she dealt with them at
Tara.</P>
<P>   The best scenes in the movie are those involving the push
and pull of the O'Hara-Butler relationship, as Vivian Leigh
exerts her considerable talents to portray her conflict between
an unladylike attraction to a bold and impertinent blockade
runner and her need to appear as a Southern aristocratic
woman should.  GWTW's humor comes largely from the
stereotyped depiction of Mammy (Hattie McDaniel, who
captured one of the movie's eight Oscars), a slave who knew
Scarlett from the time she was born and who is looked up to
by the pretty lass as though she were her mother.  Like an
antebellum Aunt Jemima, Mc Daniel steals every scene she's
in, bossing around the household and condemning the actions
of the Yankees who somehow thought of themselves as
welcome liberators of the slaves.</P>
<P>   All of the drama of GWTW is successfully combined with
dazzling production values.  An immense fire is created when 
cars of ammunition explode as Scarlett and Rhett are fleeing
the advancing Northern armies.  The image could pass
muster even in the age of 1990s fx, the flames of Atlanta
providing a feverish testimony to the tragedy of this war
between brother and brother.  The most heart-rending scene
is of hundreds of broken bodies lying, bleeding, dying on the
streets as Erenst Haller's camera pulls back for a horrific
bird's eye view.</P>
<P>   "Gone With the Wind" is the sort of film that some have in
mind when they say "they don't make 'em like they used to." 
There is room in our movie theaters for the great classics like
this one and for the boldly original and independent works
that push back the frontiers of the cinematography.  Musically,
you might consider GWTH like a well-constructed work of J.S.
Bach while, say, a current sci-fi original like "Pi' can be
compared to a dissonant concert of Paul Hindemith.  True
cinemaphiles will always make room in their entertainment
schedules for a rich variety of works, and "Gone With the
Wind," bound to enjoy revivals for the century to come, will
rank among the finest of them all.</P>
