<PRE>   Here are some facts: try to identify the location being
described.</PRE>
<P>   Teachers' salaries are so low that the authorities have to
dig deeply into the barrel just to find uncertified substitutes. 
Regular teachers take too much time off, using their sick
leave: in one case an instructor takes a whole month to visit
his dying mother.  The kids are pretty wild.  Teacher turns
her back on the class and mayhem ensues.  Kids sneak out
during the day to such an extent that it's necessary to post a
guard at the door just to keep them inside the building.  While
the brighter kids can read the alphabet, some can't read at
all, yet all are tracked into the same class.  The dropout rate
is scandalously high.  Many of the youngsters are dirt poor
and need to find work just to keep their families afloat.  The
mayor promises more supplies and better pay but cannot be
trusted to keep his word.  </P>
<P>   What school system are we talking about?  If you guessed
Shuiquan Village in China's Hebai province, you're on the
money.  That wasn't hard, was it?</P>
<P>    "Not One Less" is an adorable fable which can draw tears
from those in the audience who are not yet enveloped by
hardness and cynicism.  Made by one of China's great
directors, the fifty-year-old Zhang Yimao ("Red Sorghum,"
"The Story of Qiu Ju," "Raise the Red Lantern"), Shi
Xiangsheng's story is of a small village school not too distant
from Beijing but light-years away from that country's capital in
sophistication.  "Not One Less" is not one of those thinly-
veiled allegories of its country's politics but is, rather, a
straightforward, heart-wrenching and frequently comic tale of
the difference one teacher can make on her students.  Since
Zhang was himself a farm hand and unskilled laborer during
the Cultural Revolution from 1968 to 1978, he constructs his
scenes from what he knows.  Yet this time around he has no
interest in exploiting China's great actors like Gong Li (who is
sold into a loveless marriage in "Red Sorghum" and is sent to
a feudal manor to become the new wife of a nobleman in
"Raise the Red Lantern").  In this case he employs the
talents of non-professionals, with most characters performing
in the precise roles they follow in real life.  The mayor of little
Shuiquan village, Tian Zhenda, is in fact the mayor of
Shuiquan village. The students at the Zhongxin primary
school are students at that very school.  Even the TV station
manager at the broadcasting station of the city of Jiangjiakou
is the TV station manager at Jiangjiakou's TV outlet.  While
watching these people perform with gusto and above all
without pretense, you can't help wondering why people need
to go to acting school at all.</P>
<P>   The story turns on an unusual plot device.  The sole
teacher of the rural school (Gao Enman) is called away from
his job for a month to visit his dying mother and, because it's
not easy to find a replacement willing to work for such low
pay in such a dirt-poor village, the mayor hires a 13-year-old,
Wei Minzhi (Wei Minzhi) as a substitute, promising her 50
yuan for her labor.  (The yuan is the same as the renminbi,
so each would be worth twelve cents.  Six dollars a month. 
Hear that Sandra Feldman?  You have some organizing to
do.)  But the $6 will not come to her that easily.  Because of
the high attrition rate at the school, she will get paid only if by
the end of the month, her roster shows the same number of
students--not one less.  When one kid--the class clown--
drops out because his sick mother needs him to find work in
the big city of Jiangjiakou--Wei's dignity is on the line and her
conscience is challenged.  Though the kid has made life
unpleasant for her in the classroom, she will spare no effort
in getting him back to school.  The latter part of the film deals
with Wei's adventures roaming the city with virtually no
money, trying despairingly to find the boy.  Your reaction to
the movie's climax--Wei's pleas to a TV audience in that city--
is a good barometer of the story's effect on your emotions.</P>
<P>   In supervising a cast of characters who are principally
below the age of fourteen, including some as youthful as six,
Zhang proves that he is as much a master at his trade as he
is when overseeing the performance of the wonderful Gong Li
in his more sophisticated dramas.  Mixing light moments with
inspiring melodrama, Zhang graphically illustrates the plight of
millions upon millions of kids in his Third World country who
must drop out of school yearly simply to locate jobs paying
the equivalent of sixty dollars a year.  Most of the population
in the city get around on bicycles, but let's not romanticize
the circumstances.  The relative absence of cars does little to
ameliorate China's problems with pollution: in fact of the ten
most pollutes cities in the world, I believe China has four.  </P>
<P>   During the closing credits, Zhang informs the audience that
inadequate schooling will continue to keep the rural
population as poor as those of the previous generation.  Yet
"Not One Less" is not meant to propagandize the country's
plight, to embarrass the current government, or to evoke
worldwide cries of sympathy and financial support.  Zhang is
surely smart enough to know that the audience for his art-
house fare is a small one.  In western nations where
American movies are more popular than the local fare, the
crowds go for plot-driven stories: what happens next? 
Whodunit? But in this touching road movie, the journey, not
the destination, is the essence.  The roads are rocky and
rough and the excursion long and slow, but the trip is ever so
worthwhile.</P>
<P>Not Rated.  Running Time: 106 minutes.  (C) 2000
