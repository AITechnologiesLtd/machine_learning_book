<P>_The_Thin_Red_Line_ (R) **** (out of ****)</P>
<P>Love a film, hate a film, all points in between--I generally know what I
want to say and how to say it.  So why, then, do I feel so ill-equipped
to thoroughly articulate my feelings about Terrence Malick's
_The_Thin_Red_Line_?  Perhaps it's just my own limitations as a writer,
or maybe it's just the natural limitations of words themselves, which can
only fail to accurately describe the challenging but wholly intoxicating
experience of Malick's long-awaited return to the directorial chair. 
_The_Thin_Red_Line_ is something that completely transcends the medium--a
film is as close to pure poetry than anything I've ever seen onscreen.</P>
<P>To state that _The_Thin_Red_Line_ centers on a group of American
soldiers fighting for survival in the Guadalcanal conflict of World War
II is to say everything and nothing about the film.  A number of violent
combat scenes occupy most of the film's three-hour running time, but the
war itself is perhaps Malick's most remote concern--and the soldiers'. 
The central fight in which the soldiers are engaged is not necessarily
the one with Japanese troops: it is the unique personal struggle within
each of them.  And the one thing whose survival their fighting for is not
their lives, but their eternal souls.</P>
<P>Malick uses his favorite device, the voiceover (used extensively in both
of his previous films, 1973's _Badlands_ and 1978's _Days_of_Heaven_), to
intone each of the soldiers' inner ruminations.  Yet while the sounds of
the voices and their specific subjects differ, the "voice" remains
constant: a stream of oblique thoughts attempting to rationalize--and
find an escape from--the horror of war and the world that produces it. 
Pvt. Witt (Jim Caviezel) searches for the light of beauty and order in
all things, from life in a simple native village to a comrade meeting a
tragic end.  Sgt. Welsh (Sean Penn) longs to find a numbness and truth
that will spare himself the psychological toll of his reality.  Pvt.
Bell's (Ben Chaplin) retreat is memories of his wife and his certainty
that they will be reunited--whether it be in this world or the next. 
Capt. Staros (Elias Koteas) prays his salvation and that of the soldiers
that have become surrogate family.  Col. Tall (Nick Nolte), a
much-passed-over veteran in the twilight of his career, doggedly pursues
the one victory under his command that would serve as a vindicating
legacy.</P>
<P>_The_Thin_Red_Line_ plays less like a film than a piece of fine art,
which accounts for the immeasurable difficulty of describing and
analyzing it (and the rather dull-sounding synopsis).  Malick's
screenplay, based on James Jones's novel of the same name, is a
remarkably textured piece of work, directly and (mostly) indirectly
addressing themes of varying complexity.  As such, like a painting, one
needs to distance oneself to experience the full breadth of its thematic
resonance; the film just grows richer with time.</P>
<P>But also like a painting, the film is not without its surface delights
that can be immediately noticed and appreciated.  Chief among these is
John Toll's exquisite cinematography, which captures the beauty of both
the stillness and chaos that comes with battle, from blades of grass
blowing in the wind, to the mine and bomb blasts that seem to erupt to a
steady rhythm.  Not to be overlooked is the fine work of the large cast. 
Pvt. Witt is the character closest to a lead, and newcomer Caviezel has a
quiet, calming presence that fits his character's--and the
film's--low-key mood.  That said, I much preferred the work of two actors
in smaller roles: Chaplin, heartbreaking as the lovelorn Pvt. Bell; and
Koteas, touching as the perhaps too-honorable Capt. Staros.  Of the more
marquee names in the ensemble, Penn, Nolte, and (to a lesser extent) John
Cusack (as Capt. Gaff) have the beefiest roles, and they impress the most
in this group.  Cameos by John Travolta and especially George Clooney are
more distracting than anything else, and Woody Harrelson tries a bit too
hard to stand out among the crowd--and that he does, albeit for the wrong
reasons. </P>
<P>The word that will undoubtedly be used most to describe
_The_Thin_Red_Line_ is "meditation," and that description could not be
more apt.  A person in a state of meditation outward appears to be doing
nothing, but he or she is engaging in an act of focus and clarity full of
rich internal rewards.  The similarly introspective nature of
_The_Thin_Red_Line_ accounts for the wildly polarized reaction to the
film; its detractors are obviously fixed on the blank exterior, while its
admirers are able to tap into the dense interior.  Chances are most
audiences will belong to the former group.  But much like another war-set
film not really about war, Francis Ford Coppola's _Apocalypse_Now_,
Terrence Malick's _The_Thin_Red_Line_ will receive its just due over
time.</P>
