<P>Let's talk beauty. Julia Roberts made her first big splash in and as 
"Pretty Woman." The title has stuck to the lyrically enthusiastic 
descriptions of her.</P>
<P>Is she really as incredibly gorgeous as the slick magazines keep 
hammering? What's happening to the classic canons of pulchritude? 
Through the ages the standards have changed. The chorus girls of 
1930s-40s motion pictures are, to say the least, plump by today's 
measurements. The pouty little mouths of the silent screen 
disappeared after talkies took over. "Glamor" is a moribund 
expression. Even so, some constants do remain.</P>
<P>Julia Roberts has a willowy figure. Her face is, to put it mildly, 
unorthodox. Both serve her well in "Erin Brockovich." Her noticeable 
nose and big slash of a mouth are respectively symbolic of Erin's 
amazing ability to sniff things out and to talk her way through the 
film with vigorous arguments, and expletives that are light years 
away (or 61 movie years) from Rhett Butler's "Frankly, my dear, I 
don't give a damn!"</P>
<P>Writer-director Steven Soderbergh's first feature "Sex, Lies, and 
Videotape" won the Golden Palm at the 1989 Cannes Festival. Almost 
all of his subsequent films have been remarkable, original, quirky 
and playing with time --but not commercial hits. Yet  his excellent 
"King of the Hill " was most accessible and his recent "Out of Sight" 
pleased audiences and critics.</P>
<P>Erin Brockovitch , correctly pronounced should be VITCH and not VIK, 
but I can't remember hearing the last name in the movie. I can flatly 
state however that the film will be a big hit. It is a mainstream , 
linear job without tricky flashbacks or other stylistic flourishes. 
It stars an enormously popular prima donna who is in just about every 
scene of this two-hours-plus story. And it is arguably the best 
performance to date by Roberts.  But don't let the word "mainstream" 
fool you. Soderbergh has assimilated audience-pleasing principles 
yet, in other ways injects novelty and imagination in his picture.</P>
<P>Take the opening. Erin, a twice divorced single mother of three, is 
scraping bottom financially. She needs -- and how -- a job. We meet 
her in a wonderfully scripted and performed interview with an MD for 
a receptionist position. Her febrile talk underlines her anxiousness 
as well as her lack of credentials. The doctor then says something 
like "Now look at this"-- and you just know that she won't get the 
job. The movie cuts away to Erin getting back to her car, which, 
seconds later, gets hit by the BMW of, ironically, another doctor. 
Fine, clever direction and editing.</P>
<P>Erin gets aging lawyer Albert Finney to sue. His firm is small, his 
girth is not. We get, refreshingly, the only courtroom trial in a 
movie that's chockfull with legalities. The scene is short, but not 
sweet for Erin. She loses. No explanations are given but we guess 
clearly that Erin's blatantly sexy outfit on the stand and her 
generous use of the f-word have done her in.</P>
<P>Increasingly desperate, the lady scours the want ads. She may have 
been a beauty queen in Topeka, but she was also a school drop-out. 
The absence of qualifications again. Things are tough. So Erin, with 
the irony that throughout the movie alternates with pathos, applies 
for a file-clerk job at Finney's very office, She gets it through 
mega-moxie which includes her special brand of outspokenness</P>
<P>The film tells you from the start: This is a True Story. That's more 
often than not an alibi for embroidering fantasies and inventions 
into facts. Yet in its basic, general lines the movie is fact indeed. 
Getting ahead of myself  I'll say that a real corporation,  giant, 
$28 billion Pacific Gas & Electric, had to pay the  largest 
reparation ever in the USA to a huge number of suing individuals.</P>
<P>True too is that the real Erin started it all, that she dressed, 
acted, spoke the way Julia Roberts does.  She also was a looker. You 
can ascertain this in the sequence where Erin takes her kids to an 
eatery. The comely waitress is the genuine Erin.</P>
<P>  When ordering food Erin pretends not to be hungry but then, back 
home, devours a can of something. It does not matter whether or not 
this  is an invention. It is touching, plausible and fleshes out the 
character.</P>
<P>The movie's Erin is an extraordinarily fast learner who uses 
efficiently her eyes, nose  and hitherto unexploited brains. 
Shuffling files she finds out that there is a connection between PG&E 
and the dreadful illnesses and deaths in the working-class California 
desert town of Hinkley, next to which the corporation had been 
dumping a poisonous chemical, hexavalant chromium. Forcefully 
persuading her boss Ed Masry (Finney) that she should and could 
investigate, she takes off with the energy of a rocket.</P>
<P>The unlikely Erin becomes a convincing sleuth as well as a sensitive 
and sympathetic interviewer of the population of Hinkley. All of its 
people have been and still are affected by the poison. Some of them 
are naive, in need of education and of persuasion to sue. Most are in 
awe of a mammoth power company's power. Additionally, there are 
strong layers in the film where the ordinary people mistrust lawyers, 
lawyers mistrust other lawyers, and legal firms are scared of being 
sunk by the billions of dollars the corporations can fight back with, 
as in the film "A Civil Action."</P>
<P>Increasingly Erin shows superb initiative, intelligence and an 
amazing comprehension  and specific details of her work. The movie 
works breathlessly as human interest and as a dandy detective story 
against a painful background. Deja vu?  Yes. Think "Silkwood," the 
aforementioned "A Civil Action,"" The Insider," etc. Yet the subjects 
are so enormous that there's room for several more works along those 
lines.</P>
<P>"EB" has a nice balance of tragedy, suspense, and humor. Erin herself 
is the right combination. She takes her work --in fact her mission -- 
as ardently as possible, and her role as mother too, At the same time 
she seems, slyly, to take her private persona un-seriously, 
sometimes self-mockingly. She dominates the story. Lawyer Ed plays 
second (but still major) fiddle to her. Puffy Albert Finney's 
performance is perfectly on-target. He is fully dimensional as a 
professional, as Erin's often annoyed boss, and in the ways he slips 
into the role of a friend and partrner. The varied supporting cast 
are well-drawn, with economy and feeling. Sensibly, the movie does 
not try to make of them picturesque characters. Instead it saves all 
its ammunitions of colorfulness for  Julia R. There is 
star-worshipping strategy here--not irritating, in fact quite 
pleasant, but
over-the-top .Even so, it's not an Achilles' Heel.</P>
<P>The main sub-plot (actually a sub-sub-plot) comes from Erin's plight 
in caring for her children. This is partly solved by new neighbor 
George, a  tattooed biker and construction worker who makes good 
money and gets jobs only whenever he pleases. He volunteers to 
babysit the kids, whom he likes.  Obviously  this service is also his 
entree to becoming Erin's new flame. The affair is not especially 
interesting, appealing or romantic. Mercifully George doesn't take up 
much movie time. He does have one good, telling moment, and I do mean 
a moment.  While he helps Erin in a "business" picnic of the Hinkley 
folks, bikers raise dust on the road. George's short look at them is 
neutral but says a lot in a  prime illustration of the Kuleshov effect</P>
<P>A major, indeed enormous distraction runs throughout the film : 
Erin's hooker-like outfits,  short skirts, long legs, spike heels and 
a push-up bra cleavage that constantly threatens to spill the goods. 
Her reverse dress code raises eyebrows and criticism. It also brings 
on Erin's snappy retorts. She does not mince her words. The 
spectacular views, whether cheap, cheaper or cheapest, underline her 
"take me as I am" attitude. One does wonder how many times the sights 
make males in the audience miss dialogue lines. They may also be 
missing the fact that this is a feminist film with a vengeance. Erin, 
if you half think of it, Wonder-Bra and all, is no bimbo but an 
activist who's pulling out all the stops. That she is is smart enough 
to ask for raises is natural.  But she has a true cause and feels 
sincerely the pain of others. Her themes song could be "Body and 
Soul."</P>
<P>The familiar formula of the film is the old David and Goliath one -- 
the triumph of the little people over mighty forces--which has fed 
countless movies, including several of Frank Capra's. It's 
irresistible, makes the audience rapt with suspense, causes it to 
cheer openly or inwardly when the good guys win.</P>
<P>"ER" 's scenario feels like the job of a veteran writer, yet it is 
Susannah Grant's first solo script, following her co-writing of 
"Pocahontas" and "Ever After." Remember her name.</P>
