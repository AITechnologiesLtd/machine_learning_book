<PRE>[comedy]</PRE>
<P>starring: Jim Carrey (Fletcher Reede), Maura Tierney (Audrey Reede), Justin
Cooper (Max Reede), Jennifer Tilly (Samantha Cole); written by Paul Guay,
Stephen Mazur; produced by Brian Grazer; directed by Tom Shadyac.</P>
<P>seen Sunday, October 12, 1997 at 9:10 p.m. at Cine 10 (Northway Mall, Albany,
N.Y.) with my brother John for $2.99</P>
<P>There's no denying the fact Jim Carrey's movies are aimed at the most
massive of audiences to make millions of dollars. Sometimes they are actually
good and funny, while others are stupid and ridiculous. "Liar Liar" is a film
that will test each viewer's loyalty to Carrey, as the humor is mostly
derived from his wild antics. I'm not a huge Carrey fan, but his performance
was funny enough to make the movie work for me.</P>
<P>As with most of Shadyac's films, this one opens with a sit-com-esque
atmosphere as we are introduced to Fletcher Reede (Carrey), a greedy lawyer
who can't help but constantly lie. He dodges phone calls from his mother, he
comes up with elaborate stories to convince his clients he's going to win
their case, and he kisses up to everyone all the time. Carrey is very
happy-go-lucky here, making Fletcher out to be a caricature if you ever saw
one. He spits out the wisecracks and one-liners like a machine gun, but
they're funny and there's nothing wrong with that.</P>
<P>It's not surprising Fletcher has an ex-wife (Tierney as Audrey) and has a
kid (Cooper as Max) who he loves but never has time to be with. It's Max's
fifth birthday and what else could a cute little kid in a movie like this
want more for his birthday than for his dad to stop lying? Max wishes for his
dad to stop lying for one day and his wish comes true.</P>
<P>The hook to the comedy starts off slowly, but within 15 minutes we find
Carrey doing his usual slapstick routine. It's funny how the situation here
is so prone to slapstick, but it works because Carrey is such a master at it.
There's a scene in which he must fight with his own hand over a pen, which is
pretty stupid in premise, but funny to watch at the time. </P>
<P>In fact, I'll have to admit a lot of what goes on here is pretty absurd as a
whole, but the actual breakdown is not. This film is a Jim Carrey comedy
machine, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's bad. Carrey puts his all into
every scene, so even if he's beating himself up (literally), or acting like a
lunatic in court, or insulting people to their face it's funny mostly due to
his delivery. </P>
<P>There isn't much else to say about "Liar Liar" because there isn't much to
it. The screenplay might be a little weak (the ending is bit much), but the
jokes usually connect giving the comedy a high batting average. The film is
about silliness and what makes it work is that it realizes this and doesn't
apologize for it.</P>
