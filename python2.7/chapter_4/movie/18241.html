RELENTLESS 3
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>Coinciding with the emerging popularity of movies that deal
with anything related to serial killers, RELENTLESS, 1989
low budget thriller about LAPD detective Sam Dietz, played
by character actor Leo Rossi, spawned three more sequels.
RELENTLESS 3, third in the row, features Sam Dietz again,
but this time detective, who had to catch vicious serial
killer in his very first case, doesn't want to deal with
similar line of work. Divorced, demoralised and transferred,
he reluctantly returns to his old post when Los Angeles
becomes a hunting ground for another serial killer, and
evidence indicate connection with one of Dietz's old cases.
To make things even more interesting, it seems that the
killer deliberately stages murders in order to bring Dietz
to the investigation.</P>
<P>Fans of the British TV films and mini-series like PRIME
SUSPECT or CRACKER would probably see a lot of similarities
RELENTLESS series of movies. They both feature vicious
psychopathic killers, yet also give a lot of, usually
depressive, details about chief investigator's private
lives. This one isn't an exception, but similarities with
British television are only in content. The execution and
style is different, which makes this film mediocre piece of
entertainment at best. Useless, gratuitous erotica also
doesn't help either, obviously making this film longer than
it should be. The actors are good, though - Leo Rossi is
fine as usual, and William Forsythe plays one of more
compelling villains in his career. Signy Coleman as Dietz's
love interest, is, on the other hand, quite miscast. But she
won't have to worry about it in the future career, since
RELENTLESS 3 wasn't supposed to be anybody's finest moment
anyway.</P>
