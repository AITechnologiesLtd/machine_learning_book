<P>   If you want to know why the cost of library paste has gone
up more or less proportionally to the price of gasoline, look
no further than Janusz Kaminski.  A master cinematographer
("Saving Private Ryan," "Schindler's List"), Kaminski took on
the job of directing this time and seems to have cornered the
market in glue, pasting together some strips of film to
construct a frustratingly fragmented, unconvincing movie
about satanic possession.  "Lost Souls," which I've been told
situated itself on a production shelf for about a year before
being released, is a godawful story about God's awful foe
whose only claim to fame is its grainy, stylized visual form. 
Even here, though, rather than having an audience sit
through 106 mintues of depressingly granulated film, couldn't
Kaminski simply deliver about ten minutes of the stuff and
then exhibit a subtitle saying, "OK, folks, you get the
idea...the texture is like that of 'The Blair Witch Project'
because this is one spooky story...now let's get on with the
tale using real film"?</P>
<P>   The film opens with an ominous black-white section,
numbers floating about as in Darron Aronfsky's "Pi," then
liquefying to transform into names.  A number of characters
are introduced helter skelter, none developed though each
needs to be told to lighten up.  Father Lareaux (John Hurt),
John Townsend (Elias Koteas) attended by parochial-school
teacher Maya Larkin (Winona Ryder) are testing their skills as
exorcists on jailbird Henry Birdson (John Diehl), and though
the rite is a failure, Maya is put in touch with the reality that
she was herself possessed at one time.  By scrutizing
Birdson's writings, she realizes that the handsome and
popular writer Peter Kelson (Ben Chaplin) has been chosen
for possession, but as an atheist he has only himself to
blame.  To prove his secularism, Kelson had told a TV
interviewer that there is no such thing as evil, i.e. not with a
capital E, but that what we ordinary people think of as evil is
nothing by a psychological state of narcissism.  Maya has a
tough time convincing the author about the danger which
Satan poses to his life given the man's fame, his good-
looking girl friend (Sarah Wynter) and his swank urban
apartment.</P>
<P>   If Pierce Gardner and Betsy Stahl's story is hopelessly
segmented, at least we're treated to a few (but far between)
scary sequences embodying Maya's hallucinations. The best
occurs in a women's room as Maya, putting on a fresh face,
is confronted with a veritable flood of sewage seeping from
the three toilets, crumbling walls, and enigmatic missives
written on walls.  But if you've seen the classics of the genre
such as "The Exorcist" and "Rosemary's Baby" you've seen it
all.  </P>
<P>   The film's conclusions, a confrontation in a car between
Maya and Peter, is laughable, which is more than you can
say about the bulk of this soporific, pasted-together disarray
of a film.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running time: 106 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
