<P>     More virtual-reality stuff from director Brett Leonard (HIDEAWAY,
THE LAWNMOWER MAN).  The year is 1999, Los Angeles, and convicts are
being used as test subjects against the VR criminal Sid 6.7 (Russell
Crowe).  Sid--a composite of 183 of the worst serial killers of all
time--was created for law enforcement purposes, but he plays too
rough.  Before the computerized killer can be shut down, he "escapes"
into reality via the body of a nano- machine android.  The only person
who can track him is an ex-cop convict (Denzel Washington) whose family
was killed by one of the aforementioned "psychos."</P>
<P>     There's lots to look at in VIRTOUSITY.  Leonard's hyperviolent
vision of a vaguely Fascist future is pretty cool.  (The LAPD drives
hummers.) The FX and production design are the best, and always
outshine the boring humans.  Without a single concern for
characterization, the old-fashioned story just chugs along merrily,
right up until the overwrought climax that features, yawn, two guys on
a roof with fists.  (Don't expect much suspense.)</P>
<P>     The cast is okay.  Russell Crowe breezes through his part with
minimal scenery-chewing, while Denzel Washington is a strong, bland
presence.  (He was *much* more fun in the underrated 1991
action-thriller RICOCHET, Joel Silver producer.) Other prominent
players include Kelly Lynch, Louise Fletcher (!), and William
Forsythe.  The latter sports a shaggy mustache and slicked hair that
makes him a dead ringer for Nick Nolte.  Or is it Pat Hingle??</P>
<P>CAMEO WATCH:  Yup, that's Traci Lords as a nightclub dancer.</P>
<PRE>Grade: C</PRE>
<PRE>BABE</PRE>
<P>     George Orwell meets E. B. White in this adorable Aussie import
about a pig who thinks he's a sheepdog.  Before you roll your eyes at
yet *another* animal comedy, check out director Chris Noonan's switched
perspective that puts the animals before the humans.  A combination of
live-action and animatronic tricks (from Jim Henson's Creature Shop)
make this barnyard gang appear to talk (via voice-overs).  The main
characters include a plucky pig, a neurotic duck, and a matriarchal
Border Collie. (We could all do without the Greek chorus of
squeaky-voiced rodents, though, who appear at odd intervals to announce
the title cards.)</P>
<P>     Co-produced and co-written by George Miller (MAD MAX), of all
people, from the children's book by Dick King-Smith.  Fine technical
credits throughout, including a delightful score that's based on one of
*my* favorite orchestral works, Camille Saint-Saens' "Symphony No.3 Op
78."</P>
<PRE>BACON BIT: Because they grow so quickly, a total of 48 little piggies
           were used for the filming.  So, how many center-cut loin
           chops does *that* translates into?  Uuuummmmmm, pork.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: A-</PRE>
<PRE>BELLE DU JOUR</PRE>
<P>     Called a classic in its day, now, twenty years later, BELLE DU
JOUR comes across as chaste, stiff, and only mildly intriguing.  The
story centers on a young housewife (Catherine Deneuve) whose frigidity
toward her husband--coupled with her lavish, sadomasochistic
dreams--compels her to take a job at a local brothel.  (Apparently,
she's never heard of therapy.)  The silence is the most
disconcerting--director Luis Bunuel includes very little in the way of
incidental music or sound effects.</P>
<PRE>In French, with English subtitles.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: C+</PRE>
<PRE>OPERATION DUMBO DROP</PRE>
<P>     We walked out after about an hour.  The slow, uninvolving
story--of an elephant's role in the Vietnam War--is based on a
real-life incident that was probably much more interesting than the
sanitized version presented here.  (This is ABC/Disney, where even
costar Denis Leary has to watch his mouth.)  The cast is agreeable,
though, and director Simon Wincer--how appropriate--finds the correct
tone to balance war and slapstick, which means that OPERATION DUMBO
DROP is probably okay for kids.  Pachydull.</P>
