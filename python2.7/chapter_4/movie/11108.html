<P>THE APOSTLE (1997) *** Written, directed, executive produced by Robert
Duvall. Photography, Barry Markowitz. Production design, Linda Burton,
Editing, Steve Mack. Music, David Mansfield. Cast: Robert Duvall, Farrah
Fawcett, Miranda Richardson, Tod Allen, John Beasley, June Carter Cash,
Walter Goggins, Billy Joe Shaver, Billy Bob Thornton, Rick Dial, Mary
Lynette Braxton, Zelma Lloyd, Sister Jewell Jernigan. Released by October
Films. 133 minutes. Rated R (some violence, marital unfaithfulness).</P>
<P>Robert Duvall tried for 13 years to pitch his creation, "The Apostle." In
vain. Hollywood not being Holy Wood, cautiously stays away from "deep"
movies about religion, except for many Biblical epics, the life of Jesus
(such as the underrated 1961 King of Kings) and "safe" historical movies
(e.g. A Man for All Seasons). Babylon-on-the Pacific has produced a few,
also safe films, about phony evangelists (Elmer Gantry, Marjoe and Leap of
Faith come to mind) and the classic The Night of the Hunter with its
demented killer-thief fake preacher.</P>
<P>Abroad, meaningful films that deal with faith, its problems, crises and
quandaries, do not abound but do exist --by Ingmar Bergman (several),
Robert Bresson (Diary of a Country Priest, A Man Escaped).Carl-Theodor
Dreyer (The Passion of Joan of Arc, Ordet). Or the "political" A Man for
All Seasons, or else Becket, taken from the Jean Anouilh play Becket or The
Honor of God.</P>
<P>Finally, Duvall had to finance The Apostle himself. There's a catch with
this film. Religion is not its soul. The film is a showpiece for Robert
Duvall, at about age  66. Does he need this? He is an all-time great. In
34 years (his debut was as Boo Radley in To Kill a Mockingbird) and in all
of his 75 movies, he showed extraordinary talent  and versatility. At a
rock-bottom minimum he should be remembered for THX 1138, Mash, the
Godfather, the Great Santini, Apocalypse Now, True Confessions, Tender
Mercies, Lonesome Dove, Wrestling Ernest Hemingway, Sling Blade.</P>
<P>In The Apostle he plays (and plays, and plays) "Sonny" Dewey, a wild and
woolly Texas Pentecostal evangelist (since childhood), with wife and
children. He has genuine faith, devotion, love for God and His creatures,
but he is flawed by his temper and his womanizing.</P>
<P>Duvall's affection for his subject leads him into mysterious paths. In the
opening sequence Sonny and his mother stumble onto a terrible car accident.
With amazing eloquence the preacher proceeds to "save" willy-nilly a
still-alive victim, then  prides himself for scoring points with the
Almighty. Soon after come "then" --colorful preaching when Sonny was a boy
-- and "now": spectacles of revivalism, crowds, testimonials from the
stage, people (including Sonny) shouting, singing, dancing, prancing,
bouncing. Whether  planned that way or not, this comes out  as ambiguous
(is Sonny a faker?) and as an ironic look at a certain slice of Americana.
There is even a shot of mass arm-raisings by the faithful that recalls Nazi
or Soviet salutes.</P>
<P>Confusing too is the status of Sonny and his wife Jessie (Farrah Fawcett).
He loves yet neglects her as he puts his preaching first. He makes no bones
about his infidelities. Jessie has taken a lover, Horace (Todd Allen) a
young preacher junior in rank to Sonny. Jessie leaves Sonny. She is seen in
bed with Horace -- openly?  in a small town? there's something implausible
here. (Some fellow-viewers thought that Jessie had divorced Sonny, others
that she was already married to Horace, etc.)</P>
<P>In another bitter pill, Sonny learns that he has been deposed as leader of
his church by the trickery of Jessie and Horace. He becomes violent. Soon
after, when he finds "his beauties" (his boy and girl), playing softball
with other kids, plus Jessie and Horace, he totally loses control, smashes
Horace's head with a bat, leaves him moribund.</P>
<P>Suddenly, keeping a oddly cool composure, Sonny leaves town in his car. He
ditches it in a stream and eventually makes his way to the small,
predominantly black town  of Bayou Boutte, Louisiana. His energy is
literally incredible. He makes quick decisions, gets an instant job as  a
mechanic (he knows everything about cars), contacts aged black preacher
Brother Blackwell (John Beasley) who had retired after two heart attacks,
talks him into reopening a derelict church that belongs to the Brother,
renovates it with the help of others  (you expect him to say :"I coulda
been a contractor"), restores a wreck of a school bus, does regular
programs on the local radio, baptizes the cleaned up church "One Way Road
to Heaven," gets an increasingly large (considering the small population)
congregation,  fires away with his preaching. Whew!</P>
<P>In Louisiana, Sonny changes his name to The Apostle E.F.,  which is pretty
immodest and hubristic. The point of all  this is supposed to be that
fugitive Sonny is seeking redemption, but  seemingly only for his attack on
Horace, since other sins are not mentioned. Certainly not promiscuity, as
the Apostle also starts fascinating and seducing Toosie, the radio
station's secretary. She is played by Briton Miranda Richardson sporting a
credible accent and looking rather anorexically thin (The affair-to-be is
not consummated).</P>
<P>What motivates Sonny must really be powerful compulsion to preach and
organize. The sin that only whispers its name, yet of which Sonny seems
unconscious, is megalomania, ego-tripping. It is also the sin of actor
Duvall who is  so taken with his own performance and with he character he
plays that he does not know (as a writer-director) where to draw the line.</P>
<P>The movie is Duvall/Sonny from A to Z  for  its long duration, 133 minutes
( 7,980 seconds). There is so much of Sonny that it robs the picture of
opportunities to flesh out any other character.</P>
<P>Duvall's performance is anti-Consigliere. I refer to his famous role of
advisor (Consigliere) to Marlon Brando in The Godfather. As Tom Hagen, the
single non-Sicilian-American of the "family," he was a strong, quiet
presence. Here, as a strong but voluble presence, Duvall gives himself the
only role that matters while letting some other elements of the movie,
including continuity and editing,  fall where they may.</P>
<P>In Apocalypse Now, Duvall's  Lt. Col. Kilgore had the unforgettable line "I
love the smell of napalm in the morning! "  In The Apostle it feels as
though he's thinking "I love the sound of me around the clock!"  That he is
superb at whatever he does is a given. But enough is enough.</P>
<P>On the other hand, this work that drips with colorful Americana, by virtue
of its nature and locations is gratifyingly color blind and not class
conscious. There is no racism  except when redneck Billy Bob Thornton gets
into a fight with Duvall. But soon Duvall' s powers of persuasion will tame
Billly Bob. Bibles used physically, plus Gandhian non-violent exhortations,
make him end up lacrymously embracing Duvall. This is a strong sequence --
but it does smack of Hollywoodist theatricality.</P>
<P>The overall concentration on religiosity (not religion) and on Sonny go on
and on to the point of making some viewers count the minutes. Still, the
tour-de-force performance by the master actor does sustain the film and is
undeniably impressive.</P>
