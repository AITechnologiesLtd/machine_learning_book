<PRE>Scrooged (PG)
A review by David Wilcock
(C)1997 DAVID WILCOCK</PRE>
<P>Starring Bill Murray and Karen Allen 
Directed by Richard Donner (Lethal weapon, The Omen, Superman)
A Paramount Pictures Release</P>
<P> Take a look at the following equation.... </P>
<P>A CHRISTMAS CAROL+GHOSTBUSTERS=SCROOGED </P>
<P>Yes, SCROOGED is the odd mixture of sentiment,
comedy and horror you would get if you mixed those two
elements toghether. SCROOGED is alternatively sick,
gross, funny, and then sickly soppy. </P>
<P>Bill Murray plays Frank Cross, a T.V executive with a
horrible personality. He's evil to secretary, actors, crew,
everyone, except the T.V's station's boss, of course
(played by the late Robert Mitchum) However, he is then
visited by a very dead exec, who warns Cross that he will
be visited by three ghosts, past, present and future (who is
called The Ghost of Yet to Come, for some reason) Sure
enough, they arrive, show Cross how much of a S.O.B he
is, and he changes his way.                  </P>
<P>However, throughout this simple plot, we've got to suffer
outlandish special effects, poor comedy, and an very, very
mean performance from Bill Murray. Frank Cross isn't
'funny' mean, he's just mean. He also isn't very good at
emotional scenes, and totally destroys the last ten minutes
of the film, with an utterly desperate speech saying how
great christmas is, and how he has changed. However, the
supporting cast are OK, with good performances from
Mitchum, Allen (who plays his girlfriend) and John Glover
(who plays Cross's 'partner') The ghost of christmas past
isn't that bad either. Sadly, though, the audience has to
suffer 25 minutes of 'Home Alone' style violence from the
ghost of christmas present, played by Carol Kane.
Whoever thought smacking that Kane smacking Murray in
the head with a toaster was funny, should be fired straight
away. And the audience also has to suffer Bobcat
Goldthwait (the guy with the annoying voice in Police
Academy 3, if I remeber correctly....) who, thankfully,
dosen't say much. 
        The script is horrendous. Michael O'Donaghue churns out
terrible, bad taste jokes (which I guess is the whole point
really) then changes direction completely to emotional
scenes. And he must of been on some drug when he wrote
the final ten minutes, which are awful. The special effects
look nice, but do nothing for the film. There's some
impressive make up effects also. The music is also good,
which is scored by Danny Elfman. But great effects and
make up don't make a great film. SCROOGED is an
appaling attempt to inject some christmas spirit into the
audience, seeing as the first 1 hour 20 minutes of the film
are so depressing anyway, and the last ten minutes had to
make up for it with an godawful speech. Why didn't Cross
just look out his exec window, and ask a young boy to buy a
goose for him? </P>
<P>Overall, then, you'd have a much better christmas if you
avoid this film like something that should be avoided
(perhaps a plague) </P>
<PRE>Overall Rating=*1/2 out of *****   </PRE>
