<P> Watching "The Whole Nine Yards" and waiting to laugh is almost as
futile as licking a popsicle stick in the hope it may eventually start
to taste sweet.
 This lumbering, colorless attempt at comedy brings together several
stars who look not only unattractive, but downright unhealthy. Instead
of laughing at the puffy Matthew Perry and the skeletal Rosanna
Arquette, you want to drive them to the nearest clinic for a check-up.
Perhaps on the way out the door you can take a second to remind Bruce
Willis his face is capable of more than just one grim expression.
 On the other hand, Willis isn't likely to be the only person who goes
through "Yards" without cracking a smile. Mitchell Kupner's screenplay
initially strives for both the corkscrew twists of "Ruthless People" and
the dark humor of "Analyze This," only to quickly settle for the mundane
rhythms of a bad TV sitcom. The movie's idea of a running gag is to make
repeated references to the curious Canadian habit of spreading
mayonnaise on hamburgers. Absolutely hilarious.
 Set in Montreal, "Yards" sets up Perry as Oz Oseransky, a dentist
married to a harpy named Sophie (Arquette, employing the corniest French
accent since Pepe Le Pew) who'd love nothing more than a ringside seat
at her husband's funeral. When their new neighbor Jimmy Jones (Willis)
is revealed to be none other than fugitive Chicago mobster Jimmy "Tulip"
Tudeski, Oz flies into a panic, while Sophie schemes to use Jimmy to
bump off her spouse. Oz zooms to the Windy City to report Jimmy to the
authorities, meets Jimmy's curvy missus Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge) and
learns the hard way why one should not covet thy neighbor's wife.
 "I haven't made love in five years," Cynthia confesses. "Neither have I
-- I've been married," Oz replies. That's Kupner's idea of really snappy
dialogue.
 As Willis practices his studied grimace and Perry wearyingly reprises
all his anxious tics, the only zip in the picture is provided by Michael
Clarke Duncan as a hard to figure associate of Jimmy's and Amanda Peet
(TV's "Jack and Jill"), who puts considerable life into the throwaway
role of Oz's goofy receptionist. With her enormous teeth and slightly
crazed eyes, Peet has exactly the sort of manic edge so desperately
desired by and conspicuously absent from the rest of the film. James
