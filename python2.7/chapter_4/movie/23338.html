<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>Shortly after her 1967 high school graduation, Susanna Kaysen (Winona 
Ryder) nearly kills herself with a cocktail of aspirin and vodka. "I had 
a headache," she explains after being committed to the Claymoore mental 
hospital. But Susanna's brush with death is really symptomatic of the 
sheer aimlessness of her life. She is the only member of her class not 
heading off for college. While much of the United States is swept up in 
the furor of the Vietnam War, Susanna seems almost oblivious. So it is 
hardly surprising that someone so lacking in direction could allow control 
of her life to be handed to the doctors and nurses at Claymoore. At 
least now, direction will be forced on her if nothing else.</P>
<P>"Girl, Interrupted" is based on true events, depicted in Kaysen's book of 
the same title. Kaysen lost a year and a half of her life in a women's 
mental ward, and the film recounts the experiences which inspired 
Susanna to retake control of her own destiny.</P>
<P>Despite a lack of real incident, the first half of the movie is 
riveting. We are introduced to some of the other girls in Susanna's 
ward, including a disfigured young pyrophile named Polly (Elizabeth 
Moss); Susanna's roommate Georgina (Clea DuVall), who seeks refuge in the 
"Oz" books of L Frank Baum; and Daisy (Brittany Murphy), a woman with 
peculiar dietary beliefs. These characters are portrayed evenhandedly; 
their mental problems are neither sugarcoated nor demonized, and they 
seem real. Watching over everything is Valerie (Whoopi Goldberg), a stern 
but caring nurse who understands in minutes what the psychiatrists 
themselves never really figure out: that Susanna has come to Claymoore 
not for help, but simply to be. "Do not drop anchor here," Valerie warns 
Susanna, knowing that the doctors are perfectly content to keep her 
locked up forever. Since there is nothing really wrong with Susanna, how 
can she ever be cured?</P>
<P>Everything is stirred up by the arrival of Lisa (Angelina Jolie), an 
aggressive young woman who is no stranger to Claymoore. Despite the fact 
that Lisa herself has no desire to remain hospitalized (when we first 
meet her, she has just been recaptured after a two week absence), it 
is her presence which is Susanna's most attractive reason for staying in 
the asylum. Lisa plays the leader of the ragtag band of patients, taking
them on secret midnight excursions through secret passages and into 
restricted areas of the hospital. For a time, Claymoore seems less like 
an insane asylum and more like summer camp. Of course, a mental ward is 
not summer camp, and eventually events conspire to remind Susanna of this
fact. It is this reality -- and how Susanna reacts to it -- which 
comprises the film's second, more uneven half.</P>
<P>Much of "Girl, Interrupted" is a careful character study. We are witness 
to how insanity affects everyone from the delusional themselves, to those 
charged with their care, to the average people who by some happenstance 
come into contact with them. The film also observes how madness can be a 
relative and elusive concept. Some of Claymoore's patients have no 
business being there (Susanna herself, for instance), while some are 
there purely because of social tenets which today seem increasingly 
outdated (one woman's only "problem" is that she is a lesbian). But, more 
darkly, not all of those released and declared sane truly are, and this 
sets up the movie's most disturbing sequence.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, after an hour of terrific characterization and  
well-chosen set pieces, "Girl, Interrupted"'s final twenty minutes are a 
huge step backward into melodrama. These scenes feel awkwardly grafted 
onto the rest of the film, as though scriptwriters James Mangold (who 
also directed), Lisa Loomer and Anna Hamilton Phelan were afraid 
audiences would not be satisfied with a straightforward character study. 
Instead, the movie ends with a lot of contrived angst and, yes, even a 
chase scene (albeit one that is nicely photographed by Mangold).</P>
<P>The cast is well chosen; while it would be very easy to play any of the 
Claymoore inmates over the top, all the actors stay grounded in reality, 
and this lends authenticity to the picture. Jolie is terrific in a role 
that has already earned her an Oscar nomination and Golden Globe award. 
Of all the characters, it is Lisa who could most easily have been taken 
too far, but Jolie knows her limits. It is clear that she is having a 
great deal of fun in the role; Jolie really gets her teeth into the part, 
portraying as much of Lisa's personality in her body language and the 
inflection of her voice as in her actual words and deeds. Ryder's 
performance, meanwhile, is understated but not bland, projecting Susanna's 
uncertainty and desperation while making it clear that she should never 
have been committed.</P>
<P>Denouement aside, "Girl, Interrupted" is an absorbing venture inside the 
walls of a mental institution. Both scripting and acting are up to the 
challenge of translating Kaysen's experiences convincingly onto the 
screen. Although it lacks the power and drama of "One Flew Over the 
Cuckoo's Nest", to which it is perhaps most readily comparable, "Girl, 
Interrupted" should not be overlooked.</P>
