<P>     A small group of forest critters goes on a quest to find herbs
with which to heal their friend after the local village has been
devastated as the result of a gas spill.  This is the premise of the
lackluster and very politically correct ONCE UPON A FOREST, the latest
subpar G-rated animated feature to go after the money of parents in
search of suitable entertainment for their young offspring.</P>
<P>     With its recent three animated features, Disney has proven that
animation capable of entertaining adults (as well as children) is not
dead.  I enjoyed THE LITTLE MERMAID, was enthralled by BEAUTY AND THE
BEAST, and had a lot of fun watching ALADDIN.  Other than those at
Disney, however, the only person around today capable of achieving a
high standard for animated features is Don Bluth, the driving force
behind AN AMERICAN TAIL.</P>
<P>     But wait--don't the ads for ONCE UPON A FOREST state that this
film comes from "the creator of AN AMERICAN TAIL"?  Yes, they do, but
the man they're referring to is David Kirschner, who served as
executive producer for TAIL.  Those going to this film expecting to see
a Bluth-quality motion picture are in for a rude surprise, although
it's a mistake Twentieth Century Fox would like to see repeated over
and over again.</P>
<P>     The story is pathetically thin, even by the limited standards of
an average five-year-old.  Children will enjoy this movie the way they
do Saturday morning cartoons, finding it mildly entertaining but
nothing special (does that make it worth an admission price?).
Mercifully, the running time is short, so parents accompanying their
children won't be bored to death.</P>
<P>     For the most part, the animation isn't worth mentioning.  The
characters move, but the background doesn't, and there are only a few
scenes where any real attention was paid to establishing some sort of
mood (those include a venture into a construction site and an adventure
involving a well-depicted owl).</P>
<P>     Remember last year's disappointing FERN GULLY: THE LAST
RAINFOREST?  Well, ONCE UPON A FOREST shares many of that movie's
traits, right down to the "don't destroy nature" theme.  However, while
FERN GULLY could at least claim the asset of Robin Williams' vocal
talents, ONCE UPON A FOREST is stuck.  It has Ben Vereen, but his voice
is used for maybe two minutes worth of screen time.</P>
<P>     There's not much else that I can say about ONCE UPON A FOREST.
Lackluster productions like this aren't worth additional words.  The
movie is dull and shows an obvious lack of innovation and creativity,
but for those desperate to take their kids to a "suitable" movie, this
one will fit the bill, although it might be better to wait a few weeks
for the re-release of SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARVES.  If you go,
however, remember this: it's the adults, not the kids, who will have
trouble sitting through the movie.</P>
