<PRE>"Hedwig and the Angry Inch"</PRE>
<P>Hedwig (John Cameron Mitchell) was born a boy named Hansel in East Berlin.
As a teen seeking his "other half," he reluctantly agrees to a sex change
operation in order to marry American G.I. Luther (Maurice Dean Wint). The
operation, performed by a hack surgeon, is botched, and the "angry inch" is
all that's left. Now a "she", Hedwig comes to America, is abandoned by
Luther, forms a rock band and falls for her 17-year old lover/protégé,
Tommy, only to be rejected by him later, too. She and her band, The Angry
Inch, shadows the now-famous Tommy Gnosis across the US (for revenge?), but
Hedwig is really in search of her lost other half in "Hedwig and the Angry
Inch."</P>
<P>First time helmer John Cameron Mitchell, along with composer/lyricist
Stephen Trask, created and starred in their acclaimed off-Broadway
production that has become the movie. And quite a movie it is in its
eclectic variety of songs, outrageous costumes, sets and makeup and,
especially, a riveting performance by Mitchell as the title character.
Mitchell and Trask have reinvented the movie musical and couple it with the
underlying story of just whom Hedwig is and what she is looking for.</P>
<P>I am, by far, not a big fan of musicals. Sure, there are exceptions, like
Bob Fosse's "All That Jazz" and "Cabaret," but, for the most part, they are
just not my cup of tea. "Hedwig and the Angry Inch" is an exception,
though, with its combination of humor, wit and a collection of tunes that
covers musical styles ranging from "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" and
Meatloaf to David Bowie to The Sex Pistols. The original songs, by Stephen
Trask (also appearing as one of the members of the band The Angry Inch),
are full of energy and variety and, even though it's not my kind of music,
I found every one entertaining and fun. The audience I saw "Hedwig" with
thought so, too.</P>
<P>The main attraction to this one-man/woman show is the presence of its star.
John Cameron Mitchell gives a solid, sometimes fun, sometimes angry
performance as a person searching for self-enlightenment and love. As a
young boy growing up in East Berlin, Hansel is abused by his G.I. father
and raised by his German mother in a tiny flat so small that "mother would
make me play in the oven" where he listened to pop music on Armed Forces
Radio. Later, as a young man, he meets Luther, another G.I. and is swept
off of his feet. The ensuing Angry Inch incident comes soon after.</P>
<P>Flash forward to a trailer park in Junction City, Kansas, and Luther is
leaving Hedwig for another boy. Frustrated and broke, she takes on
baby-sitting and the odd "job" to make ends meet. She also forms a band
with four Korean housewives and the musical talent of Hedwig is born. She
meets, falls for and loses young Tommy, who steals her songs and goes off
to become a rock sensation. Jealous and angry, Hedwig and her new band
begins a campaign to shadow Tommy's tours and, with the help of her
manager, Phyllis Stein (Andrea Martin), is trying get a law suit going
against the star for stealing her songs. Hedwig and The Angry Inch get
gigs, not coincidentally, at a chain of seafood restaurants that just
happen to be next to the forums where Tommy Gnosis is playing. Things
finally come to a head, so to speak, in New York City.</P>
<P>The popularity of the off-Broadway musical and its offshoots have garnered
a ready-made audience base for "Hedwig." The wit, humor, music and search
for identity has great appeal to young adults, but the charismatic presence
of Mitchell makes this a cut above what it could have been. It is this
one-man/woman show that casts its spotlight on its "internationally
ignored" rock star and Mitchell is outstanding in the role. There isn't a
lot going on with other characters, though there are amusing little
sidebars, like Hedwig's backup singer/lover, Yitzak (Miriam Shor), deciding
to break away from the band to join a Polynesian road show of "Rent" as a
Puerto Rican drag queen.
The low budget that the moviemakers have for the production belies the
quality of the film. Attention to details - Hedwig's costumes and
outrageous "Cabaret"-like makeup; the seedy trailer park setting; and, the
kitschy seafood restaurants - are loads of fun to watch and lend the
appropriate air to the proceeds, all on what has to be a beer budget.</P>
<P>"Hedwig and the Angry Inch" may not be for everybody, but the energy of the
effort, the songs, the imaginative sets and costumes and a fast steady pace
make it a pleasure to watch. If you're a fan of contemporary, edgy music,
it is an even bigger draw. I give it a B+.</P>
