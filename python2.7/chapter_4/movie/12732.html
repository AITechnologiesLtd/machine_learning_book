*********************************</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Wayne Wang</PRE>
<P>Written by: Jean-Claude Carriere and Larry Gross.</P>
<P>Starring: Jeremy Irons, Gong Li, Maggie Cheung, Ruben Blades</P>
<P>Ingredients: Dying photojournalist, 1997 Hong Kong hand over, street
waif, friend, lover</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
John, a British author who has adopted Hong Kong as his home, suddenly
finds out he is dying of leukemia six months before the hand over of
Hong Kong to China. He quits his job and tries to explore the meaning of
Hong Kong by wandering the streets with a video camera. Since John is a
character of internal feelings and few words, John's roommate Jim (Ruben
Blades) occasionally acts as the movie's mouthpiece.</P>
<P>What is Hong Kong before the hand over? Is Hong Kong like John's lover
Vivian (Gong Li), a Chinese woman who hangs on to him knowing he will
die? Is Hong Kong like the scrappy street waif Jean (Maggie Cheung),
cast off by a former boyfriend, who hustles to survive? Is it like a
business, merely getting a change of management? Or like a defiant
animal in the marketplace? A woman in blue jeans vowing to start life
anew? </P>
<P>CHINESE BOX explores these metaphorical images and more, and leaves the
answer unresolved, letting us come to our own conclusions. The only
thing we know for sure is that a tumultuous change is occurring before
our eyes, accompanied by an intensity of feeling similar to time spent
with a dying lover. </P>
<P>Opinion:
When Vivian compares herself to Hong Kong and the dying John (Jeremy
Irons) wonders to himself, "I wonder if I can last as long as  the
British" six months before the 1997 hand over, you can bet this film is
not about leukemia, but a metaphor trying to establish the meaning of
Hong Kong. </P>
<P>One of the weaknesses of the story is that it has very little story.
After quitting his job a dying John basically wanders around the city
with his video camera capturing images and occasionally falling into
weakness or frustration. His thoughts remain confused until the end of
the movie. This is likely to disappoint fans of strong storylines. </P>
<P>On the other hand, CHINESE BOX is powerful from the artistic point of
view.  In one scene, John's friend Jim takes a projector, and projects
the videotaped face of the talking street waif onto John's face,
creating an interesting effect. From images of jade and bloody hands to
a man beheading a chicken, to a scene where the street waif confronts a
British childhood boyfriend who abandoned her, CHINESE BOX offers us an
unending stream of metaphors for the complicated feelings that abound in
real life Hong Kong. Perhaps the strongest image (shown twice) is the
close up of the still-beating heart on a faceless chopped fish in the
marketplace. CHINESE BOX is also one of the few films in which the
soundtrack completely and perfectly matches the imagery, whether it's
the sound of traffic or the sound of silence. </P>
<P>Gong Li doesn't get many lines, (mostly gets to show emotions) but she
does a fabulous job within that limitation. Ruben Blades and Maggie
Cheung are outstanding, and Jeremy Irons puts in a solid
characterization of a man trying to come to grips with complicated
feelings. </P>
