<PRE>THE WINGS OF THE DOVE</PRE>
<P>There is a sense of familiarity about THE WINGS OF THE DOVE that appears to
cloud its subtle originality and inventiveness. There has been a plethora
of late eighteenth-century English period dramas over the last five years
and we have become accustomed to the overstated costumes, bombastic scores
and soap-opera narratives. In fact, there have been so many that this
little gem may get overlooked as yet another Merchant-Ivory imitation when
it is vastly superior in every way.</P>
<P>The film starts off innocuously with a romantic interlude on a crowded
train which leads to a passionate affair between Kate Croy (Helena
Bonham-Carter) and Merton Denscher (Linus Roache). However, their love
affair is thwarted by Kate's wealthy Aunt Maude (Charlotte Rampling) who
threatens to disinherit Kate if she continues her flirt with a middle-class
journalist.Their relationship appears doomed until they meet Millie Theale
(Alison Elliot), an American millionairess who happens to be dying of
cancer. As Kate forms a friendship with Millie, she gets this crazy notion
that if Merton should seduce Millie then they would be inherit her wealth.</P>
<P>The film's premise may appear slight and familiar but Iain Softley's
sensitive and intelligent direction transcends the film from mere soap dish
to a provocative and poignant drama about passion, obsession, greed and
ambition. What sets this film apart from the Merchant-Ivory drivel is the
restrained and subtle way the narrative unfolds without resorting to
stating the obvious. There is no unnecessary dialogue exposition stating
what we already know. For once, the audience is assumed to have an
above-average mentality and we are grateful.</P>
<P>The acting all round is outstanding. Helena Bonham-Carter deserved her
Golden Globe nomination and will definitely get an Oscar nod as well. She
gives a striking performance of a woman who is caught between her desires
and ambitions. She often see-saws from a sympathetic character to a villain
but at the end of the film, it was she who received our greatest sympathy.
The complexity of the character would have been quite daunting to any
performer but she pulls it off brilliantly and has now stepped up to the
big league of female actors. However, who knows what Hollywood would do to
her. We may see her in the next Scorsese flick or we may see her strutting
her stuff in SHOWGIRLS 2. Hollywood awaits!</P>
