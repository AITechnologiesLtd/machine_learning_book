                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  **1/2  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1988)</PRE>
<P>        TWINS, directed by Ivan Reitman and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger
and Danny DeVito, is the epitome of high-concept, disposable entertainment.</P>
<P>        In this check-your-brain-in-at-the-door movie, Schwarzenegger and
DeVito are fraternal twins, the result of a genetic engineering experiment
gone awry.  Schwarzenegger as Julius is the twin who received all the
"good" genes.  Raised by a scientist on an isolated tropical island, Julius
is intelligent, well-educated, physically fit, and good-natured, but he
lacks experience in the real world.  DeVito as Vincent is the twin who
received the "leftover" genes.  Raised in an orphanage in L.A., he is a
good-for-nothing car thief and general hoodlum.  Separated at birth, the
two brothers finally meet for the first time after Julius leaves his
island-home to track down Vincent in L.A.</P>
<P>        Given the brilliant casting and talent involved, TWINS has very
little ambition.  Although the movie is consistently entertaining, it never
really rises above the level of high-concept formula. TWINS is far too
willing to milk easy laughs from the striking dissimilarity between the
twins and far too reluctant to develop its characters.  The strength and
heart of TWINS is the relationship between the two brothers, who grow to
love and respect one another.  Unfortunately, the film's action-oriented
subplots distract from the strong chemistry that develops between Julius
and Vincent.</P>
<P>        The most pleasant surprise in TWINS is Schwarzenegger's knack for
comedy.  His performance as a fish out of water unfamiliar with American
culture is convincing and endearing.  His social ineptitude and
inexperience produce the movie's funniest moments.</P>
<P>        DeVito, on the other hand, is exactly what you'd expect.  He plays
the standard loud-mouth, smart-alec character that we've come to know and
hate.  This incarnation of the character is not much different from his
past roles; he's as obnoxious, immature, and irritating as ever.  Kelly
Preston also deserves mention; she gives TWINS a healthy dose of
pulse-raising sizzle as the sexy and stunning beauty who takes interest in
Julius.</P>
<P>        Fortunately, despite all its predictable and uninspired humor,
TWINS delivers a lot more fun and entertainment than you might expect.</P>
