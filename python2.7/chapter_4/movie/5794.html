<P>Ever feel you're spending your whole life on the Net (ouch!), eating,
breathing and excreting web sites ? That your most meaningful
relationships are being formed on the Net? That you get your best sex
on the Net ?</P>
<P>If first-time director Hal Salwen could shoot an entire movie of
characters typing at their computers, he would. As it is, he settles
for characters talking on the phone. DENISE CALLS UP is a movie for
and about the electronic generation, where characters are too caught
up with their work and insecurities prefer to live out their
relationships and fantasies on the phone. It's a satire - and a
sometimes funny one - about how we let handphones, call-waiting and
answering machines run our lives.</P>
<P>The problem: DENISE CALLS UP is a movie about an idea. A darn good
one, but still an 80 minute-long idea. And despite Salwen's attempt at
plots and sub-plots, despite some genuinely funny moments, you can
predict the movie's outcome within the first fifteen minutes. You get
the drift after a series of shots of characters explaining over the
phone why they all couldn't make it for a party - nobody is going to
be meeting anybody in this film, they would rather be talking on the
phone.</P>
<P>Here's Salwen's plot: while all the characters are in a dysfunctional,
telefixated limbo, loud quirky stranger Denise calls up Martin to
announce that she is pregnant with his child, courtesy of the sperm he
donated to the local bank. As Martin progresses from slamming the
phone on her to long phone conversations over the baby's name, his
friends - and his friends' friends - get involved, courtesy of
call-waiting and double-lines.</P>
<P>In the tigher and more tantalizing sub-plot, Barbara and Jerry are set
up on a blind date that neither turns up for. Both profess to have too
complicated schedules to ever meet, but they get it going over the
phone. With repeated phone sex comes a glitch; what if the other
person is simply faking it?</P>
<P>DENISE CALLS UP scores with some inspired moments. Mousy Barbara
metamorphoses into a vamp over her cordless, everyone shares the
excitement of Denise's delivery through a conference call to her
handphone, and Barbara's best friend Gale is killed in a car accident
while taling animatedly into another friend's answering machine. (As
Gale's overly-chatty aunt recounts, her cordless was knicked into her
ear and lodged in her brain.)</P>
<P>But these moments are not enough to sustain the movie. The pace sags,
the dialogue drags and not much acting appears to be required of the
telephone-touters. And the ending is literally a non-event as
expected, everyone is too chicken to turn up for the party Frank
throws in Gale's memory despite promising over the phone that they
will. We get the point.</P>
<P>The movie appears to be intent on flogging its terribly-'90s statement
until they have it coming out of your ears. Pun intended. There's even
a on the movie's web site where you can win cellular phones (as if we
haven't had enough of these things already). Watch the movie only if
you find it philosophy compelling enough for a earful.</P>
<P>THE FLYING INKPOT's rating system:
* Wait for the video.
** A little creaky, but still better than staying at home with Gotcha!
*** Pretty good, bring a friend.
**** Amazing, potent stuff.
***** Perfection. See it twice.</P>
