<PRE>VEGAS VACATION (1997)
A film review by Nick Schaden
Copyright 1997 Nick Schaden</PRE>
<P>        Midway through "Vegas Vacation", Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) looks
out his car window and sees Christie Brinkley in a red Ferrari.   This
is an obvious nod toward an near identical scene in the now famous
comedy "National Lampoon's Vacation", which started the entire Vacation
movie series.   A small tear nearly formed in my eye, remembering how
funny Chevy Chase and "Vacation" was, and how far downhill both the
actor and the series have become.   While in my opinion "Vacation" was
one of the funniest movies of the 20th century, "Vegas Vacation" is only
mediocre, and the series is showing its age.</P>
<P>        "Vegas Vacation" is the story of Clark Griswold, his wife Ellen
(Beverly D'Angelo), and their son Rusty (Ethan Randall) and daughter
Audrey (Marisol Nichols).   It's vacation time once again for the
Griswolds, and this time their destination is Las Vegas.   As expected,
the vacation is a humorous disaster.</P>
<P>        One on hand, like the other movies in the "Vacation" series, it
succeeds in several key points.   First, the movie successfully
satirizes much of the real problems for Vegas travelers, from gambling
traps to cheesy entertainment and nightlife.   In addition, while Chevy
Chase and Beverly D'Angelo stumble through a few portions of the movie,
for the most part they fill their respective roles as Clark and Ellen
well.   Finally, the Griswolds' cousin, Eddie (Randy Quaid) always
results in a few laughs, keeping the movie on its two feet.</P>
<P>        However, what "Vegas Vacation" falls short in (which frankly should be
a strong point of any good comedy) is the humor.  Put bluntly, "Vegas
Vacation" isn't incredibly funny, with mostly only chuckles coming from
my mouth while watching it.   This occurs mainly because of the one
prevalent joke throughout the movie: Clark's gambling problems.   While
watching Clark lose big time on the blackjack table is moderately
humorous the first time, seeing it again and again with little
variations in style or substance just plain isn't.</P>
<P>        In the end, "Vegas Vacation" has a few high points, but for the most
part is only a blatantly average movie. While there are several comedies
that are quite worse than "Vegas Vacation", there are many that prove to
be much better - I'd suggest seeking those out before watching this
movie.</P>
<PRE>        Nick's Rating: 0</PRE>
<PRE>        *** Movies rated from -4 (worst) to +4 (best), 0 = average movie ***</PRE>
