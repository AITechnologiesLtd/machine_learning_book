<PRE>
I guess there are two ways to look at Rugrats.  Here is one of them:</PRE>
<P>I've been fond of Rugrats the series since before my daughter was
born.  It not only provides a charming look into childhood, but also
lets us laugh at the parenting mistakes of ourselves and others as
Tommy's parents act all of them out.</P>
<P>When my daughter turned 3 a year ago, she was also charmed by the
series, and we would watch it together, she laughing at the kid jokes
and me laughing at the adult jokes.</P>
<P>So, how well does the series translate to the big screen?  That's the
wrong question, actually.  It's not a matter of translation, but of
implementation.  The possibilities of moving Rugrats to the big screen
are obvious -- better animation, bigger budget, clever use of
multichannel sound.  The opening underscores this by showing us the
classic opening on a tiny screen in mono sound, and then suddenly
opening to the big screen and full theater sound in the last few
moments.  Reminiscent of the Enhanced Star Wars trailer.  But the
implementation....  Ah, there's the rub.  It  isn't very good.</P>
<P>In fact, it's pretty bad.  There's only about a half hour of plot in
the 80 minute running time.  The rest is stretched out with unneeded
(and unfunny) scenes, and -this is the bad part- some of the worst
songs to assult our ears since Quest for Camelot.  The plot is...
embarrassing.  Not clever or illuminating as the series has been, but
just downright dull and painful to watch.</P>
<P>There are a few clever moments, but we've already seen about half of
them in the trailer.  There doesn't appear to be any reason for this
movie to exist, except to make us pay seven bucks a seat to see
characters we used to see for free.  And let's not forget the full
length commercial, excuse me, cartoon Catdog.  Or was that Dogcat?  I
forget.  And I wish I could forget that cartoon.  It reminded me
somewhat of Micky's Brain, in that I kept hoping that this was the
last scene... no, maybe this was... nope, maybe this one.</P>
<P>Anyway, on a 0 to 4 scale I'd have to rate the experience a 1.  Even
at discount prices, I didn't get my money's worth.</P>
<P>As I said at the beginning, there are two ways to look at this movie.
Here is the other one:</P>
<P>Kool, Duud!  Klasky/Czupo are geniuses.  With Rugrats they have raised
the bar for big screen parody, and have done it in such a subtle
fashion that almost no one will get it!  In the series, the Rugrats
scriptwriters routinely lampoon cutesy smarmy kiddie movies, and they
brilliantly continue the motif on the big screen.  Tommy, Chuckie and
the bunch want to see Reptar (an obvious reference to Godzilla and
other action movies) and couldn't care less about watching an achingly
saccarine movie about a bunch of babies.  So while the adults are
trying to figure out why Rugrats the movie is so bad, the kids are
sneaking out to watch Enemy of the State.  Oh, the humanity!  Check it
out -- all the morons who are assulting Rugrats because of poor plot,
awful music, bad dialog, are just too dense to understand that it's
SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE THAT!  It's SUPPOSED to be bad.  That's the POINT!
What Genius!  I'm going to see it again and again!</P>
<P>Ahem.  Anyway, whether you look at it as a rather flat kiddie movie or
a profound inside joke on the audience, one thing Rugrats the movie
certainly does not have is the charm and wit of the series.  If you've
never seen the series but were dragged into the movie, you owe it to
yourself to catch a couple episodes to see how it's supposed to be.</P>
