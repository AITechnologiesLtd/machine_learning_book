<PRE>                           MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1997 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>An out-and-out blatant chick flick from the first frame on, MY BEST
FRIEND'S WEDDING will be as enjoyable to its female patrons as it is
frustrating to its male ones.  Yes, Julia Roberts is back, and in fine
form -- playing Julianne, the bad girl, against Cameron Diaz's
squeaky-clean bride-to-be (Kim).  The best friend in question is Michael
(Dermot Mulroney), Roberts's long-time confidant.  When Michael reveals
his imminent marriage, Julianne develops a jealousy to be reckoned with,
and makes it her life's work to break up the couple.</P>
<P>In addition to its problems with alienating male viewers, the real flaw
in WEDDING is the lack of chemistry between the Mulroney and Roberts. 
While I'd probably be a little shy smooching on Julia, hey, that's no
excuse for a seasoned pro.  Then there's also the minor detail that the
trailer tells the story better than the film -- leaving some gaping plot
holes -- but who's quibbling?  Roberts is the one to watch here, along
with Rupert Everett as her gay editor and co-conspirator in this mess.
It's really these two that make this picture fun -- and funny.  And it's
in WEDDING's fall-down funny moments that the picture really shines.</P>
<P>Maybe the most annoying piece of the film is Diaz and her penchant for
bawling in every scene.  But then again, who's watching her?  I always
liked the redheads best, anyway.</P>
