                    A film review by Christopher Null

<PRE>     To understand the horror of Coyote Ugly is to understand how it was
made.</PRE>
<P>     It's 1993.  Some Hollywood bigshot reads an article in GQ magazine
about a nutty bar called the Coyote Ugly in Manhattan.  They only have
women bartenders, see, and they, like, dance on the bar with fire and
stuff!  And they don't serve water.  If someone orders water they hose
down the crowd!  Holy mackerel, what a nutty place!</P>
<P>     And then someone says, What a nutty place... for a movie!  Cart in
a screenwriter who invents a story about, say, a puppy-eyed girl from
New Jersey who winds up working at the Ugly while trying to make it as a
songwriter.  Make up some obstacles: she has stage fright, she gets
robbed, and her dad is fat.  Pop in a troubled love interest.  Toss in a
bunch of heaving-bosomed women to dance on the bar, get Jerry
Bruckheimer to produce, spend $40 million on advertising, and the
movie's done!</P>
<P>     But oops, someone forgot to make the movie any good along the way. 
Cliché-infested and so utterly tired and worn out as to make itself
appear a relic of the early 1980s, Coyote Ugly is just plain bad.  It
almost seems like they decided to take a real-life place and tried to
build a movie around it.  Er, uh, wait a minute...</P>
<P>     Piper Perabo, one of the most frightening newcomers to hit
Hollywood in the last decade, plays our young heroine, who faces
obstacle after obstacle en route to what must ultimately become
ridiculous success beyond her wildest dreams.  Note to Piper: Let's see
if we can't dye the eyebrows to match the hair, shall we?  Perabo's role
is so badly acted it would be cause for raspberries galore were it not
for an even worse script.</P>
<P>     Newcomers like Adam Garcia (the love interest) and wannabes like
Maria Bello (the bar owner) do their best with lines like "I could tell
you, but I'd have to kill you," but to no avail.  Their hearts aren't in
the movie, and for good reason: No nudity.</P>
<P>     Er, I mean: A really awful story that feels ripped from The Bold
and the Beautiful.  Does fat dad (John Goodman) really need to be
hospitalized to build drama?  Would someone really rob poor Piper's
rodent-infested Chinatown apartment?  Would anyone really stop fighting
in an all-out bar brawl to listen to the girl sing-along with the
jukebox?  I'd say all that was missing in Coyote Ugly was a wedding, but
they squeezed one of those in there too.</P>
<P>     For those not following along, Bruckheimer is essentially trying to
remake his own Flashdance, which made an incredible $95 million back in
1983.  They even dump water on the bartenders, "Maniac" style.  And I
think it's safe to predict that Perabo's career will likely follow that
of her predecessor, Jennifer Beals.  In other words:  Hello, Cinemax!</P>
<P>     Come to think of it, that's probably where most people will end up
seeing this movie.</P>
