<P>WHERE IS MY FRIEND'S HOUSE ?  (director: Abbas Kiarostami; cast: Babak
Ahmedpour, Ahmed Ahmedpour, Kheda Barech, 1987-Iran)</P>
<P>A young Northern Iranian schoolboy, Ahmed, wishes to return a school
notebook to his classmate, who is threatened with expulsion from school
if he does not bring in his notebook to school for tomorrow's class. The
problem is that the student lives in the next village and Ahmed does not
know his address. How he gets the notebook to his friend's house, turns
out to be an odyssey of great human endeavor, as this 8-year-old, looks
through wanting eyes at an adult world that is trapped in its own
misconceptions. Ahmed has to overcome his mother's harsh outlook on
life, his grand-father's caustic perception of how to raise a child, his
strict school teacher, and the adults he meets on the way who are
unconcerned with his problem.</P>
<P>That Ahmed goes on to the next village, despite warnings of not to go,
is a metaphor for how a childlike curiousity and a refreshing innocense
is the essential ingredient needed, if change is ever to come to a
society that is stagnant. The narrowness of life and the barren
landscape, are excellent props for the director's vibrant themes, shot
without professional actors and done in a low key, realistic style. The
aims of this film are set too low to make it a masterpiece, especially
when you compare it to a  Satyajit Ray film, but this is still great
cinema, something American filmmakers would be wise to observe. Abbas is
not afraid to let his camera do the work, to allow it to follow his
student around in real time, so we do get a feeling of what it is to
participate in the journey. His relentless pursuit is poetically
evocative, depicting life in its raw elements. What more can you ask
for?</P>
