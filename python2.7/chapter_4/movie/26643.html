<PRE>A TIME FOR DRUNKEN HORSES
-------------------------</PRE>
<P>Five Kurdish children struggle to survive by picking up odd jobs in a distant
town while their widower father is away earning a living smuggling over
the Iran/Iraqi border.  Madi (Mehdi Ekhtiar-Dini) is the eldest son, but he's 
severely handicapped so twelve year old Ayoub (Ayoub Ahmadi) bears the brunt 
of this responsibility while Rojin (Rojin Younessi), the eldest sister, acts 
as mother to the brood.  Ameneh (Ameneh Ekhtiar-Dini), the middle child,
helps both elder siblings, but mostly takes care of Madi.  Then their father
is returned home, dead from the landmines which pepper the landscape in 
first time director Bahman Ghobadi's Cannes Camera d'Or winner, "A Time
for Drunken Horses."</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>The biggest, freshest surge in international cinema has been coming from
Iran in recent years via the works of Abbas Kiarostami ("A Taste of Cherry"),
Majid Majidi ("The Color of Paradise") and father/daughter directors Mohsen
and Samira Makhmalbaf ("Gabbeh," "Blackboards").  Many of these films
focus on children.  Ghobadi's "A Time for Drunken Horses" is like a more
harshly realistic counterpart to Majidi's lush and fable-like "The Color of 
Paradise."  They have in common children of a widowed father who care for a 
handicapped sibling who proves to be a hindrance to a marriage.  
Ghobadi's film is distinct in that his characters are Kurds, an ethnic 
minority of twenty million who live in Iran, Iraq, Turkey and Syria.  </P>
<P>When their father dies, their uncle declares Ayoub head of household because
he's already burdened with eight children of his own.  Madi's doctor
tells Ayoub he needs an operation within four weeks to keep him alive for
another 8 months.  Ayoub begins the risky smuggling work that killed their
father, where mules, laden with tires, are given alcohol so they won't feel the
blistering cold crossing the snowy mountains over the Iraqi border.  Ayoub's
struggles maintain his family, but he's unsuccessful earning enough money
for Madi's operation.  (He does bring Madi the present of a picture.  Ghobadi
captures a brilliant image of the dwarfish Madi gazing upon a photograph of
a body builder.)</P>
<P>Ayoub returns from one trip to find that Rajin has been betrothed by his
uncle.  Rajin explains to the distraught Ayoub, frustrated by his
uncle's convenient return to head-of-household, that she's agreed to this 
because her new family will pay for Madi's operation, but on the wedding day, 
her new mother-in-law refuses to take Madi and offers a mule as recompense.  
Ayoub strikes out in a blizzard with Madi to sell the mule in Iraq to get his 
brother medical care.</P>
<P>Ghobadi returned to his Kurdistani village home, utilizing non-actors (and 
many relatives) to make this striking film.  The four eldest children are all 
extremely natural in front of the camera, possessing strikingly expressive 
faces (Ameneh, in particular, has the face of an angel).  These people have 
bleak lives with hardships unimaginable to western audiences.  Something as
basic as the procurement of an 'exercise book' (blank school notebook) is a 
treat to be savorred (we see this innocent merchandise and the truck which 
carried it impounded at a border patrol early in the film).  However, the love
among the siblings, which Ghobadi makes palpable, may seem rare to jaded
western auds.</P>
<P>The film is shot in a realistic documentary style, yet contains images of
stunning beauty, particularly when showing the harsh, wintery landscape.
(When Ayoub and Madi are caught between two ambushes, they witness the
other smugglers and their mules run down a snow covered hill into a valley,
with the mules' former tire loads rolling willy-nilly alongside them.)</P>
<P>"A Time for Drunken Horses" projects love, spirit and hope. The ending, 
in particular, is simplicity itself in projecting triumph over extreme 
adversity.  </P>
