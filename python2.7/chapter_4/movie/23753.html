"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Ever wonder how your life would have turned out if you had done a few
things differently in the past?  That question serves as the basis for
Pip Karmel's directorial debut called Me Myself I (not to be confused
with the upcoming Farrelly brothers/Jim Carrey gag-fest Me, Myself &
Irene).  Karmel's main character is a single woman that wonders where
she would be today if she had only accepted her high school sweetheart's
marriage proposal some thirteen years ago.</P>
<P>Rachel Griffiths (Oscar nominee for Hilary & Jackie) plays Pamela Drury,
an award-winning journalist known for hard-hitting magazine features.
As the film opens, Pamela has just given up smoking, found out that her
new crush is married, and received a male strip-o-gram from her
co-workers for her thirtieth birthday.  The combination of these events,
together with the nearly audible sound of her biological clock ticking,
drives Pamela to go home, get blasted and look at photographs of her Mr.
Right, Robert Dickson (David Roberts) – the guy she turned down several
years ago.</P>
<P>The next day, Pamela is hit by a car.  Her injuries are limited to a
bumped head, but when she comes to, Pamela notices that the car was
being driven by her apparent doppelganger.  They go to the twin's house,
where Pamela #1 learns that her twin isn't Pamela Drury #2, but Pamela
Dickson, an alter ego that said yes to her old boyfriend's marriage
proposal and squeezed out three of his kids.  Before she can get her
bearings, the doppelganger disappears, leaving Pamela #1 alone in the
house just as the kids are coming home from school.</P>
<P>Realizing that the double is gone and that the kids will obviously think
that she's their mother, Pamela is forced to switch gears and pretend to
be a happy housewife.  The trouble is that she doesn't know the first
thing about cooking, grocery shopping or carpooling, let alone the names
of her new children.  Things don't get any easier when Robert comes home
and Pamela has to figure out how to use a diaphragm.  I have a feeling
that this kind of thing happens to women all the time, which would
explain why they often seem like different people from day to day.</P>
<P>While Me Myself I may sound like a cross between Sliding Doors and
Freaky Friday, the film is actually quite well-written and deftly
executed.  Karmel, the Oscar-nominated editor of Shine, also wrote the
script for this first directorial effort.  Fellow Australian Griffiths
is very charismatic and, at times, resembles Juliette Binoche in both
appearance and demeanor.  The film is funny, touching and will probably
make you think of a few `what if' scenarios on the way home from the
theatre.</P>
<P>1:44 - R for brief nudity, sexual content and adult language</P>
