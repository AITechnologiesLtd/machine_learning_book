<P>     Following the spectacular failure of MARY SHELLY'S FRANKENSTEIN, 
Kenneth Branagh returned to England to make the kind of film he was most 
familiar with:  a very British, low-budget production rooted deeply in 
the works of William Shakespeare.  However, instead of filming "Hamlet" 
straight (as Branagh will do for his next film), the writer/director 
chose instead to focus his story on a small troupe of largely-untalented 
actors and their attempts to put together a Christmas week production of 
the Bard's most celebrated tragedy.  Echoing the farcical NOISES OFF, A 
MIDWINTER'S TALE is a first-rate comedy that offers far more laughs (all 
of them intentional) than anything Branagh has previously done.</P>
<P>     A MIDWINTER'S TALE is loaded with allusions, both cinematic and 
literary.  The most obvious are those from Shakespeare, which 
understandably permeate the film.  Not only are the characters 
attempting to perform "Hamlet", but certain scenes from the play hit a 
little too close to home for several of them.  Branagh also 
simultaneously pays homage to and pokes fun at one of the most respected 
British filmmakers of all time:  Sir Laurence Olivier.  Elements of A 
MIDWINTER'S TALE's presentation recall the work of Woody Allen, and the 
ensemble cast is the kind that Allen usually gathers -- although Branagh 
uses British names while Allen typically assembles Americans.</P>
<P>     With all of Branagh's energy focused on directing (he never appears 
on screen), A MIDWINTER'S TALE is almost always on-target.  Unlike the 
failed comedy PETER'S FRIENDS, melodrama never threatens to overwhelm 
humor.  In fact, most of the so-called dramatic aspects of this film are 
subtle parodies of traditional Hollywood cliches:  the struggling actor 
choosing love over fame, a reconciliation between a long-separated 
father and son, and a man finally earning his mother's approval after a 
lifetime of failure.  Branagh handles these themes deftly, treating each 
with enough respect to create emotional arcs for the characters, but 
making sure the audience knows he's fully aware of how overused the 
material is.  </P>
<P>     The main character is actor/director Joe Harper (Michael Maloney, 
who bears a strong physical resemblance to Ralph Fiennes, and whose 
acting style echoes Branagh's), who, during a slow time in his career, 
risks bankruptcy to stage an experimental Christmas-time production of 
"Hamlet" in his home town of Hope.  Unfortunately, auditions don't go 
well -- all the respected theatrical talent is involved in one 
production or another of "A Christmas Carol" -- and Joe finds only six 
willing participants.  Since the text necessitates 24 roles, everyone is 
forced to play multiple parts.  Thus, Hamlet's Ghost, Claudius, and the 
Player King all bear a strong resemblance to one another, Laertes is 
moonlighting as about five other people, and Rosencrantz and 
Guildenstern are one.  Gertrude is played by a drag queen (John 
Sessions), Ophelia is essayed by an amazingly nearsighted actress (Julia 
Sawahla), Horatio is a drunk (Gerard Horan), and the set designer (Celia 
Imrie) is a mystic who judges the likely success of a production by how 
stiff her nipples become.  </P>
<P>     Branagh has fun with his material, weaving a tale likely to 
generate guffaws even for those with little knowledge of the play upon 
which it is based.  As the "Hamlet" rehearsals get underway, Murphy's 
Law is in full effect.  Egos clash, Laertes' funny accent becomes 
incomprehensible, Rosencrantz/Guildenstern gets sauced, and Ophelia 
takes a nasty spill.  It's all enough to make Joe doubt the sanity of 
putting on a "400-year old play about a depressed aristocrat."  </P>
<P>     As usual, the director has surrounded himself with a group of fine 
actors.  Central roles go to Michael Maloney (OTHELLO), Branagh alum 
Richard Briers (MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING), AB FAB's Julia Sawalha (her co-
star from that show, Jennifer Saunders, has a cameo as an American movie 
producer), John Sessions (HENRY V), Gerard Horan (MUCH ADO), Hetta 
Charnley (as Joe's sister), and the ethereal Celia Imrie (MARY SHELLY'S 
FRANKENSTEIN).  Joan Collins goes intentionally over-the-top as Joe's 
vulture-like agent.</P>
<P>     No current film maker appears to love and understand Shakespeare as 
well as Branagh, and never has his affection for the Bard been more 
apparent than here.  This picture succeeds as a comedy, a satire, and 
even, to a certain extent, as a mild melodrama about choosing between a 
paycheck and the nourishment of the soul.  A MIDWINTER'S TALE is also a 
stylistic accomplishment.  Filmed in black-and-white, it's a movie of 
shadows and starkly contrasting images, all of which are used to their 
best effect.  Anyone who wondered about Branagh's future following 
FRANKENSTEIN can set their concerns to rest.  He's back on top in the 
independent arena with A MIDWINTER'S TALE, a film that offers ninety-
eight minutes of pure fun re-interpreting the phrase "the play's the 
thing."</P>
