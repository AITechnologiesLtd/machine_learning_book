<P>   The twists and turns featured in Mike Barker's thriller "Best
Laid Plans" offer nothing new to the genre, yet only the
sharpest devotees of the contortions and distortions of the
category will guess the design of this cinematic pretzel. 
At times we think we're looking at a photographed play,
particularly since Ted Griffin's script focusses strongly on just
three people who plan and scheme to enrich themselves and
then diagram ways to extricate themselves from onerous
circumstances.  The best reason to see this drama--which is
really the sort of piece you might encounter on a decent
cable station in the late evening--is the quality of the acting. 
The always reliable Reese Witherspoon ("Pleasantville,"
"Election," "Cruel Intentions") is absolutely incapable of fault
in any role, while relatively unknown Alessandro Nivola
("Face Off") turns in a smashingly convincing job as a guy
who gets kicked around and yet is sought out to disentangle
a former college buddy from a most untenable situation.</P>
<P>   Appropriately using a flashback technique, Barker opens
the movie in a bar as an increasingly inebriated Bryce (John
Brolin) loudly relates unamusing jokes to his pal Nick
(Alessandro Nivola).  Shortly after a sexy young woman
slinks into the pub and casts an eye on Bryce, Nick
gets a frantic call from his buddy who desperately needs
help.  After having having gone home with Bryce--a college
English instructor who is house-sitting for a fabulously
wealthy contact--the woman accuses her new companion of
rape, threatens to bring in the police, and is chained to a pole
in the basement.  A frantic Bryce pumps Nick for advice on
how to save both his career and his freedom.  When Barker
flashes back four months, we find out that things are not what
they seem.</P>
<P>   Much is made about the barren town in which the
characters are living, a nowhere place out West called
Tropico, which both Nick and his girl friend Lissa (Reese
Witherspoon) are eager to leave.  Scripters like Ted Griffin
and also like "Mrs. Tingle"'s Kevin Williamson seem to
believe people living in decaying towns can leave only if they
come into some money--in the case of "Tingle's"
valedictorian, Leigh Ann Watson, by winning a scholarship to
a big-city college, and in the situation of Griffin's screenplay
by coming into insurance money.  When Nick finds out that
the money he expected from his dad's life insurance will not
materialize, he falls into a trap.  He becomes an accessory to
a crime, one which expected to net him $10,000, but ends up
actually owing money to people who put extreme pressure
upon him when his best-laid robbery schemes gang a-gley.  </P>
<P>   "Best Laid Plans" features an amusing role by Rocky
Carroll as the Bad Ass Dude, who demonstrates in graphic
ways his determination to be paid off by the increasingly
despairing Nick, and who possesses some of the cleverest
dialogue in the story.  He comes across as no paltry street
hood at all, but more like a finance major who relentlessly
and humorously quizzes his prey on Adam Smith's theories
embodied in "The Wealth of Nations" and demonstrates his
knowledge of the Benthamite Calculus as well. Though the
anxiety-ridden Bryce serves largely as a straight-man, a
sounding board for Nick's shenanigans, all three principals
turn in crackling good performances in a story marred only by
a cop-out sentimental finale.  "Best Laid Plans" may not be
sport the clever dialogue of some of David Mamet's films on
similar themes ("House of Games" comes to mind), but as a
puzzler that inventively blends humor with chills, Barker and
Griffin's film is more than worthy of our patronage.</P>
