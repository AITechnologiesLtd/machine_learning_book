<P>While Very Bad Things shares a similar moral to A Simple Plan,
it is ultimately a vastly different film.  This grim black comedy
looks at how normally ordinary people can commit atrocious acts and
then be torn apart by their guilty conscience.  However, debut
writer/director Peter Berg (from Chicago Hope, etc) relentlessly
pushes the pitch black material down a vastly different path.  This
uncompromising and brutal film about murder and mayhem is pervaded
with an air of cynicism, misogyny, and delicious black humour, the
like of which has rarely been seen in mainstream cinema.  A week
before his wedding, Kyle Fisher (Jon Favreau, from Swingers) heads off
to Las Vegas with four buddies for a wild bachelor party.  It's an
orgy of drink and cocaine and male bonding, taken to excess.  The
weekend takes a turn for the worse following the arrival of the
stripper.  During some energetic sex in the bathroom with the callow
Michael (Jeremy Piven), she ends up impaled on a hook.  While everyone
else panics, sleazy real estate agent Robert Boyd (Christian Slater)
takes charge, suggesting that they bury the body in the desert.  The
simple plan does not go smoothly and before long the body count is
steadily rising.</P>
<P>When the five men return to Los Angeles, their uneasy sense of
guilt begins to consume them, and eventually explodes into hysteria
and anarchy, disrupting the smooth wedding plans.  The former friends
turn on each other with a frightening and unexpected ferocity.
Sibling rivalries and old jealousies boil over into murder, and they
all pay a hefty price for their sins.</P>
<P>Very Bad Things takes a number of unexpected and macabre turns
before the final sting in the tail.  Berg has a jaundiced view of
human nature, and he unerringly strips away the thin veneer of middle
class urban values and ethics.  He maintains a delicate balance
between outright farce and psychological drama.  The humour is often
quite uncomfortable and vicious, and will not be to everyone's taste.</P>
<P>The opening scenes are handled somewhat awkwardly.  However,
Berg quickly hits his stride, and directs this inventive, but
uncharacteristic and uncomfortably black comedy with assurance.  The
ensemble cast throw themselves into their unsympathetic characters
with relish, their frenetic performances capturing the spirit of the
material.</P>
<P>An often manic and mannered performer, Slater has rarely been
so perfectly cast.  His intense performance captures the demonic,
unscrupulous and completely amoral Boyd, who doesn't hesitate to act
when he recognises his smoothly laid plans beginning to unwind.
Cameron Diaz (There's Something About Mary, etc) is also good as
Laura, Kyle's tightly wound fiancée, who becomes increasingly
neurotic as the wedding approaches.  Laura is so desperate to ensure
that her wedding proceeds without a hitch that she eventually becomes
as morally bankrupt as everyone else around her.  Her performance
reveals an often unexplored nasty side to her usually sweet screen
demeanour.  Daniel Stern (Home Alone, etc) brings plenty of shrill
nervous energy to his role as the family man who succumbs to his
feelings of guilt and paranoia, and finally snaps under the mounting
pressure.</P>
<P>Very Bad Things is decidedly nasty stuff, but those attuned to
its perverse wavelength will also find much to enjoy.</P>
