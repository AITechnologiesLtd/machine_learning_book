<P>     Over the past few weeks, I have heard THE BUTCHER BOY compared to 
everything from A CLOCKWORK ORANGE to THE 400 BLOWS.  And, while I 
suppose there are some superficial similarities, those who are making 
such comparisons appear to be giving far too much credit to this film.  
THE BUTCHER BOY works best as a dark comedy and social satire, and is 
somewhat less successful as a character study of a deeply-troubled young 
boy whose violent impulses are fed by his unstable environment.</P>
<P>     After a pair of big-budget motion pictures (INTERVIEW WITH THE 
VAMPIRE, MICHAEL COLLINS), Irish director Neil Jordan has returned to 
the kind of smaller movies that earned him a reputation (MONA LISA, THE 
CRYING GAME).  And, while THE BUTCHER BOY, an adaptation of Patrick 
McCabe's novel, is far from Jordan's best work, it is a consistently 
engrossing and sporadically comic look at a seemingly-normal boy who 
turns into the biggest nightmare of a small Irish town.</P>
<P>     THE BUTCHER BOY takes place during the early 1960s, when the fear 
of atomic obliteration was on everyone's mind, even the denizens of out-
of-the-way villages like the one pictured here.  12-year old Francie 
Brady (Eamonn Owens) is the local bully.  He and his best friend, Joe 
(Alan Boyle), delight in tormenting other kids, especially the shy 
Philip (Andrew Fullerton), whose mother, Mrs. Nugent (Fiona Shaw), is 
Francie's personal nemesis.  According to him, everything that's bad in 
the world can be traced back to her.  Meanwhile, Francie's home life is 
less-than-ideal.  His mother (Aisling O'Sullivan) is on the verge of a 
breakdown and about to be sent off to "the garage" to be fixed up, and 
his father (Stephen Rea), "the best drinker in the town," is frequently 
drunk and abusive.</P>
<P>     At first, we view Francie as a fairly typical product of a 
dysfunctional home, but it soon becomes apparent that his problems run 
much deeper.  This isn't the story of a prankster who finds redemption 
in a Dickensian fashion -- it's a darker, more ominous tale about a boy 
whose hostile surroundings feed his inner anger and paranoia and turn 
him into an amoral monster.  Most coming-of-age films are about kids 
triumphing by overcoming adversity.  THE BUTCHER BOY shows what happens 
when a child fights back not by bettering himself, but by lashing out at 
others.  </P>
<P>     Jordan presents THE BUTCHER BOY as more of a black comedy than a 
tragedy.  Francie's internal monologues (the film is infected with the 
dreaded voiceover narrative) are sometimes corrosively funny, especially 
his descriptions of certain characters.  He shows contempt for just 
about everyone except his best friend, Joe, and, at times, his mother 
and father.  By playing up the most absurd aspect of almost every 
situation, Jordan manages to find the humor in even the most horrific 
sequences.  In some ways, I was reminded of the recent film INTIMATE 
RELATIONS, which possessed a similar, bizarre tone.</P>
<P>     Without a doubt, Jordan has a good sense of time and place, and 
uses it to the film's advantage.  This is a world where people go about 
their daily work under the constant threat of nuclear annihilation (the 
Cuban missile crisis occurs during the course of the film).  "The 
Fugitive" is on television, although the only one in the town to own a 
working set is Mrs. Nugent.  The accepted treatment for psychiatric 
patients is shock therapy.  And the influence of Catholicism is all-
pervasive.</P>
<P>     Jordan's occasional use of preposterous images and magic realism 
(including Sinead O'Connor as the Virgin Mary, invading space aliens, 
and an exploding A-bomb) are designed to draw us into Francie's world (a 
place that's created as a defense mechanism against the cruelties of 
Francie's environment, and is more than a few steps removed from the 
norm).  In reality, however, they accomplish the opposite by erecting an 
artificial barrier between the audience and the character.  There's no 
debating that Francie is a fascinating individual, or that newcomer 
Eamonn Owens gives an amazing performance, but this boy doesn't burrow 
under our skin in the same way that the two girls from HEAVENLY 
CREATURES (a not entirely dissimilar film) do.  We see Francie's 
explosive rage clinically, from a distance.  We do not experience or 
participate in it, and that keeps THE BUTCHER BOY from being a truly 
memorable motion picture.</P>
