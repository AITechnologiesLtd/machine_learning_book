<PRE>Mickey Blue Eyes</PRE>
<P>Starring Hugh Grant, James Caan and Jeanne Tripplehorn
Directed by Kelly Makin
Running Time: 1 hour 42 minutes</P>
<PRE>(Castle Rock Entertainment)</PRE>
<P>After the astounding success of Notting Hill, Hugh Grant returns to the
screens again in this humorous comedy. Hugh Grant 'plays' (although he
always just acts as himself) Michael Felgate, an auctioneer. He proposes to
his girlfriend Gina (Tripplehorn) who refuses. Michael tries to find out why
she won't marry him, and it turns out the problem is her dad, Frank (Caan)
who is a member of the mob. Grant tries to sort the situation out so they
can get married, but soon gets himself tangled up in all sorts of trouble
with the mob, passing himself off as 'Little Big Mickey Blue Eyes from
Kansas City.'</P>
<P>Although nothing particularly special, with an almost television movie feel
about it, Mickey Blue Eyes has a good sense of humour and enough charm to
get itself through. The film relies heavily on Hugh Grants shtick as the
stuttering Englishman, and thankfully the film survives because of this.
Although Grant tries nothing new, apart from an hideous Italian accent, he
charming enough to hold the audiences attention, and gets us through the
film. The same can't be said for Tripplehorn, however, who gives an uneven
performance. There's little chemistry between Grant and herself, and I
couldn't care less if Grant would get back with her. She comes off as a
little irritating, and not very watchable at all. James Caan, despite his
limited screen time, is fun as the mobster father, and a large supporting
cast of Italian stereotypes are fun enough to make sure the plot keeps
going.</P>
<P>The plot itself is nothing special, and the script is also uneven to make
this film truly funny. Mixed in with some funny lines are some obvious,
horrible gags that raise a groan rather than a laugh from true predictably.
The screenwriters, Adam Scheinman and Robert Kuhn, could of thrown in a few
more gangster film references, and apart from the Godfather theme playing in
the background during some scenes, there's a distinct lack of parody. The
writers also seem to have a problem with the non Italian supporting
characters, with James Fox's character being a stumbling British plot
element that serves little purpose but to power a few gags and get the silly
ending to work. He's nothing more than a plot device, which is a shame. In
fact, only Grant, Tripplehorn and Caan get any meat in the roles, the other
Italians look like they could provide many laughs, but the writers push them
to the side.</P>
<P>The direction, from Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy director Kelly Makin, in
bouncy enough, and keeps the plot moving. Most of the gags provide a smirk
and a smile, but none are laugh out loud funny. Although Mickey Blue Eyes is
good fun, there's an odd air about the film that it could of tried a little
harder, rather than relying heavily on the cast, Grant in particular, to get
the laughs.</P>
<P>Still, with it's fun performances, some good jokes and a nice soundtrack
with the usual Italian tunes mixed in, Mickey Blue Eyes is a good vehicle
for Hugh Grant, and provides 100 minutes of amusement. Well intentioned fun.</P>
