<PRE>IN SHORT: ludicrous nonsense</PRE>
<P>Sometime in the next week I'll get eMail from some outraged teen who
will call me an idiot and tell me that The Skulls was the best movie
ever made. To which I'll reply "Were you drunk when you saw it?"
(usually the answer is "yes" and I know this because the kidlets
inevitably spills the beans in the last line of the eMail) and "Did you
laugh at what you were seeing happen on the screen?" (which, if there
was even one person in that audience anything like the multitude I sat
with here in New York City, the answer is also "yes"). Net response:
look up the word "Ludicrous" in your Funk and Wagnall's and you'll
probably see, as definition 6: "as in a movie: ie. The Skulls" If ever
there was a movie that enabled its audience to feel inherently superior
to the alleged upper-classes seen in its scenario -- and that smug sense
of superiority is the key to laughing at, and thus enjoying, this flick
-- it is this one.</P>
<P>The idea of it all -- that a centuries old college secret society has
tendrils into the highest and lowest corridors of power in the country
-- is so fit for the conspirati madness that has gripped our country
ever since JFK got his head popped that I thought, "OK let's see where
it goes."</P>
<P>It went down pretty quickly. From the very first second of the flick,
after an ominous chord of music and a title card informing us of some
background material the audience I sat with was in stitches. We are
introduced to Luke McNamara (Joshua Jackson), a poor boy hoping that
he'll be tapped for The Skulls because he's heard that they'll cover the
ridiculous cost of the legal career he hopes to pursue. He's got a hot,
upperclass girl friend, Chloe Whitfeld (Leslie Bibb) and a journalism
major roommate, Will Beckford (Hill Harper), who is secretly trying to
do an expose on the secret societies that infest the campus (which is
Yale, though that word is never spoken in the flick).</P>
<P>Luke gets tapped, of course. Thus begins an elaborate ritual of
introduction to the group, called the Revelation process. Luke is
attached to a "soul mate," Caleb Mandrake (Paul Walker), to whom all
secrets must be revealed, and swiftly gets sucked into the world of The
Skulls, who provide money, cars, clothing, connections and even women
for the candidate's bed.</P>
<P>Then, the roommate commits suicide. The police detective (Steve Harris)
says it wasn't. Luke finds secret Skulls material belonging to "soul
mate" Caleb among Will's effects. Is it possible that The Skulls have
orchestrated a murder coverup to protect their own? And what would they
do to one of their own, if he spills the beans? Add to the mix a subplot
of a battle for control of The Skulls involving Caleb's father Judge
Litten Mandrake (Craig T. Nelson) and U.S. Senator Ames Levritt (William
Petersen), with Luke and friends stuck in the middle. The whole thing is
so lightweight ridiculous, filled with manipulative would be thrills,
that it is to laugh. Which half the audience did. To be fair, a good
hunk cheered at parts of this nonsense, but not I.</P>
<P>There are flat out stinkers and then there are the flicks that are so
bad that they're deserving of the purchase of the super-extra-large tub
o' popcorn with extra golden flavored topping to go with that bottle you
snuck into the theater, which pretty much sums up The Skulls. One day
you'll be sitting through this thing at a midnight show. The Skulls is
so bad that someone will proclaim it to be good.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to The Skulls, he would have paid...</P>
<PRE>$0.00</PRE>
<P>And God bless the audience member who walked out saying "It's Eyes Wide
Shut all over again. This was terrible," while another walked out saying
"This wasn't even worth renting." Cranky says maybe it'll be fun if you
get a friend to pay for the rental and get incredibly drunk before you
sit through the tape. That way you point at your pal afterwards and yell
SUCKER! and cackle some more.</P>
