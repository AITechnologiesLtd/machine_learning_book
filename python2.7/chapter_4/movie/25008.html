<P>Have you ever been to a rave party? Have you ever smoked a lot of dope, done
some Ecstacy or just gotten really ripped with some of your best buddies
over a weekend? Well, I hope for your sake that you have, since the fantasy
world of intoxication has always been known to drop many an inhibition,
loosen the façade of reality, and if anything, grant us with more than just
one memorable story for our friends. But if you're a straight player, have
only heard of the parties and the drugs and the sex, well maybe this movie
is just what you need. Buckle your seatbelt, Dorothy...it's gonna be a bumpy
ride!</P>
<P>PLOT:
This film follows the lives of five close friends during one typical rave
party evening, with a little bit of background on each of the main players,
a setup to the nite's activities, the parties, parties and parties, and
inevitably...the crash end of the evening.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Hard to truly rate this film since I did quite appreciate its visuals, its
soundtrack and its authentic portrayal of the rave/drug scene, but I just
couldn't get past the fact that the characters were uninteresting, the story
absent and the overall sense...deja-vu. Of course, movies like TRAINSPOTTING
and GO worked because they presented us with an overall picture including
intriguing characters and engaging storylines, two elements which were
ultimately missing from this fast-paced movie. In fact, this film could
actually be considered more of a documentary on the rave scene, with its
believable insights, actual drug depictions, which are generally glanced
over in other teen-party flicks, and its innovative filming style.
Unfortunately for the audience, at least in my case, all five of the main
characters were just annoying, unentertaining and generally, over-the-top.
Add that to the fact that the two lead girls looked like they were in their
forties, and not much investment went into these characters from my end.
Without that bond with the characters, without much of a story, and without
much of a high while watching this picture, I can't say that much of it
"did" anything for me.</P>
<P>Sure, there were a couple of definite funny scenes, including one which
broke down the politics of "passing the spliff" at a party...very funny! And
another one which showcased the uncomfortable feeling one has when
constantly running into someone whom you only know as an acquaintance, and
all of the bullshit conversation that you must carry on with that person. So
true, and pretty darn funny as well. Many of the other moments in the film
featured movie references attempting to be clever (both the TAXI DRIVER and
STAR WARS conversations didn't work for me), as well as kids basically
screaming, jumping up and down, and telling us how cool it is to be high. I
know what they're saying, but watching it for ninety minutes just didn't
click much for me. The ending was especially weak with a dopey romance angle
coming out of nowhere, but I will give the first time writer/director Justin
Kerrigan this much...the camera tricks are abundant and certainly quite
inventive.</P>
<P>Being a fan of stylish movies and not being afraid to admit that I have
personally "inhaled" some friendlies of my own, I might recommend this film
to those who love the raves, like to smoke a little doobie before watching a
movie, and anyone who doesn't mind watching a film with no actual plotline.
For the rest of ya'll, I would suggest skipping this puppy, and renting many
of the better films to which this movie makes mention, including TAXI
DRIVER, CLERKS, SCARFACE or THE SHINING.</P>
<P>Incidentally, I got the chance to interview 26-year old writer/director
Justin Kerrigan for this film, a conversation which you could read by
