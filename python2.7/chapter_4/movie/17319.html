<PRE>                                RAVENOUS
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     "You are who you eat."  So goes the tongue-in-cheek (so to speak)
tagline of RAVENOUS, the inexplicable black comedy by iffy directress
Antonia Bird.</P>
<P>     Set during the Mexican-American War, RAVENOUS starts with the
promising tale of a soldier named Boyd (Pearce, from L.A. CONFIDENTIAL)
who finds himself transferred to a remote Sierra Nevada outpost in the
dead of winter.  Enter Colqhoun (Carlyle), a traveller suffering from
frostbite and famine... and who turns out to be, well, a bit of a
cannibal.</P>
<P>     Sadly, RAVENOUS delves into the predictable and silly faster than
you can say "fava beans."  It's all very kitschy, with Colqhoun
developing a, well, ravenous streak in him for human flesh, resulting in
the steady attrition of the outpost's crew.</P>
<P>     Curiously humorous performances by Davies and Arquette are
welcome... until they are consumed by one character or another.  But
really, what's the point of this movie?  It's not that RAVENOUS is
offensive in the slightest.  Now that we've digested Hannibal Lecter (so
to speak), cannibalism isn't such a taboo.  Make it funny - well, *try*
to make it funny - and it's even less "shocking" and "controversial,"
both of which Bird was clearly shooting for.</P>
<P>     Two hours of feasting, and bah... I left the theater hungry.</P>
