<PRE>CAPTAIN CORELLI'S MANDOLIN
A film review by Annette Cardwell
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Captain Corelli's Mandolin is one of those films that most people can't
in good conscience say they hate.  In the tradition of films like Waking
Ned Devine and Cinema Paradiso, it's a sweet but flawed wartime romance
with enough gorgeous scenery and quaint villagers to choke a horse.  It
innocuously celebrates the triumph of true love, exalts the rise of an
everyman hero, toasts art's ability to eclipse the horrors of life, and
at times is even a visual feast (Miramax should charge the Greek tourist
board royalties).</P>
<P>Adapted from the best-selling novel by Louis de Bernieres, the story
begins in 1941.  Dr. Iannis (John Hurt) and his lovely daughter Pelagia
(Penélope Cruz) live on the idyllic Greek isle of Cephallonia, where
Pelagia is betrothed to fisherman Mandras (Christian Bale) who's eager
to prove his mettle in the growing war in Europe.  He goes off to fight
for Greece against the Italians; in the meantime, the Italians invade
his home island.  But these Italians aren't scary, Mussolini types;
they're jolly, good-natured and even kind.  According to them, Italians
are best at "eating, singing, and making love," which the filmmakers set
out to prove to no end in this movie.  Let's put it this way: Puccini
gets some serious screen time.</P>
<P>When the opera-crooning Captain Corelli (Nicholas Cage) -- beloved
mandolin in hand -- is placed in Dr. Iannis' home as a boarder, he and
Pelagia fall in love.  All seems wonderful, especially when word arrives
that Mussolini has surrendered to the Allies.  The Italians are ready to
go home, but in handing over their arms to the still-fighting Germans,
some of the fun-loving Italians get shot.  Soon, Corelli and his men are
working with the resistance to help liberate the island and avenge their
brothers' deaths.  But, can these few men defeat a huge Nazi onslaught? 
Can true love prevail?</P>
<P>Don't be so certain of the answer, but don't expect miracles either. 
Films about love and war should have pathos and grit, and Corelli's
gives us smatterings of each.  Unfortunately, those glimmers are
smothered by incredulously bad, syrupy dialogue ("I feel I could've
watched you forever.") and ludicrous -- almost comic -- accents.  The
performances are all passable, but Americans and Brits posing as
Italians and Greeks can be too much to bear at times.  Cage seems to
channeling a toned-down Roberto Benigni, exclaiming "Bella bambina!"
every time he catches sight of Cruz.  And Christian Bale as a swarthy
Greek revolutionary?  That casting decision is pure comedy.</P>
<P>While it's not remotely as bad as Pearl Harbor, the war here is
basically a nice device to teach us the important lesson of acceptance. 
We're all not so different (well, except maybe the Nazis, but everyone
hates them, right?).  Greeks, Italians, and Germans can remarkably
understand each other... in their accented English, of course, and these
cultural exchanges are where the film's painless platitudes come to
light.</P>
<P>Oddly, Corelli's does provide quite a bit of gruesome battle footage and
its fair share of brutal death, which gives you quite a jolt after
watching an hour of bucolic harmony, Italians singing happily, lovers
cooing at one another, and "Bella bambina!"  It's a welcome shock back
to reality.</P>
<P>But with the billing of "From the director of Shakespeare in Love," one
would hope John Madden's follow-up would have touted the same witty,
incisive and radiant dialogue as its predecessor, but this script is
made of lead.  Instead of clever, we're treated to cliché with a thick
artsy varnish, and there's certainly a big audience for that.  Too bad
he couldn't get Tom Stoppard to bail him out this time.</P>
