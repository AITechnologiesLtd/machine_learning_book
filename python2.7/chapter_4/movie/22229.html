<PRE>ROSETTA</PRE>
<P>A film Review by Athan Bezaitis  Copyright Filmcritic.com</P>
<P>Fair warning!!!  Don't eat a big meal before you watch ROSETTA.  If you
thought the hand held camera motion from THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was
bad, you'll be stumbling out of this one with a splitting headache and
nausea that only Dramamine can prevent or projectile vomiting can cure.
At least in BLAIR WITCH the technique served a purpose that added an
element of mystery to the film.  ROSETTA, on the other hand, was so dull
and convoluted that the hand held style fails miserably in its attempt
to create a `realistic atmosphere.'  Directors Luc and Jean-Pierre
Dardenne should issue a warning for theaters to block off the first
eight rows of every location that this movie opens so that nobody gets
too close to the screen, plus they ought to provide those handy little
barf bags, just in case you have a weak stomach like me.</P>
<P>Rosetta, played by newcomer Emilie Dequenne, is a seventeen year-old
adolescent suffering through a miserable life in Seraing, Belgium.  She
lives in a trailer park with an alcoholic mother who prostitutes herself
for booze and food.  Her home barely has running water and cannot even
provide shelter from the cold wind.  Despite her horrid circumstances,
the film chronicles her incredible perseverance and strength as she
attempts to get a job that will provide food and rent money for her
desolate family to survive.</P>
<P>The film's production is primarily at fault for its failure.  Subtitled
in English, several key scenes have white backgrounds, which make the
writing on the screen illegible.  Unless you speak French, you'll have
no clue as to what is being said.  Also, the film never explains the
significance of Rosetta's perplexing stomach ailment, which plagues her
whenever she expresses any strong emotions.  These crucial blunders,
coupled with the poor handheld photography, spoil Emilie Dequenne's
performance, which resonates as the only bright spot of the whole film.</P>
<P>This is one that should be avoided if you're a movie hound looking for
kicks this holiday season.  But if you insist on seeing it, I don't
recommend eating cheese-filled pastries right before, like I did.</P>
