 Lost and Found (1999) 1 star out of 4. Starring David Spade and Sophie Marceau.</P>
<P> David Spade is at his best - if such a word is applicable to this annoying
little man - when he plays the sarcastic twerp.</P>
<P> Trying to turn Spade into a romantic lead is like trying to convert me
into a figure skater. In other words, it can't be done.</P>
<P> However, director Jeff Pollack manfully tries to achieve the impossible in
"Lost and Found," a very uneven and dull comedy.</P>
<P> Spade plays Dylan Ramsey, owner of a small Italian restaurant whose dream
is to expand his operations into the vacant space next door.</P>
<P> He also would like to find the girl of his dreams.</P>
<P> Another stretch, trying to convince an audience that Spade is an
entrepreneur, a go-getter. That takes people skills, something most of his
characters lack in abundance.</P>
<P> "Lost and Found" revolves around Dylan's attempts to win the heart of his
new neighbor, Lila Dubois (the ethereal Sophie Marceau). She is a cellist
trying to start a professional career in the United States and, at the same
time, put a lot of distance between her and her smarmy ex-boyfriend Rene
(Patrick Bruel).</P>
<P> The love of Lila's life is Jack, her terrier.</P>
<P> So, how does Dylan go about winning her heart? He kidnaps Jack and then
spends a lot of time with Lila scouring Los Angeles for the "lost" pooch.</P>
<P> There's a pall that hangs over "Lost and Found," a shadow that grounds the
entire experience. And that is the late Chris Farley.</P>
<P> One of Dylan's employees is an oversized, not-too-bright, happy-go-lucky
slob named Wally who idolizes his boss to the point that he dyes his hair
to match Dylan's and dresses like his mentor.</P>
<P> Wally, as played by Artie Lang, does nothing more than remind you of
Farley's absence and how well he and Spade worked together.</P>
<P> Without him, Spade is like a tricycle with a missing wheel. He continually
spills.</P>
<P> "Lost and Found" tries very hard to be funny and, honestly, it offers a
couple of cute moments, especially that of Spade filling in for Neil
Diamond at a swank affair.</P>
<P> But aside from that, "Lost and Found" has little to recommend. Spade is a
comedian whose antics can only be tolerated in small doses. And when he
tries to act sincere, it's as believable and Bill Clinton swearing he never
had sex with that woman.</P>
<P> "Lost and Found" merely wanders aimlessly from sequence to sequence,
offering stale jokes and very few punch lines.</P>
