YELLOW SUBMARINE
A review excerpt by Joe Barlow
(c) Copyright 1999, Joe Barlow.  All rights reserved.</PRE>
<P>Yellow Submarine is the spirit of the '60s compressed into ninety
minutes of movie magic. I can't think of any other film, before or
since, that so completely encapsulates the era in which it was made.
For that reason alone, George Dunning's animated musical odyssey would
be worth seeing even if it didn't happen to be utterly charming in its
own right--a rock and roll Fantasia, if you will. </P>
<P>The plot is ridiculous enough to suit the story's offbeat narrative
style. When the benevolent citizens of Pepperland find themselves
threatened with impending invasion by the Blue Meanies, a force
determined to destroy all joy and music, they send the bumbling
Captain Fred (voiced by Lance Percival) away in a magical submarine to
find help. Fred, a kindly but incompetent soul, manages to convince
Britain's greatest band, the Beatles, to come to Pepperland and help
save his beloved utopia from extinction. Along the way, lots of
groanably bad puns will be spoken, much silliness will ensue, and some
of pop music's loveliest melodies will tumble forth from your
speakers. </P>
