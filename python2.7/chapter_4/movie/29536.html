<PRE>                      HEARTS IN ATLANTIS
               A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>    CAPSULE: In 1960 an eleven-year-old forms a friendship with 
    an elderly man who boards at his house.  Scott Hicks directs 
    with a great deal of period feel.  Anthony Hopkins stars as 
    the mysterious Ted Brautigan.  The story is told 
    sentimentally and well until the script or perhaps the story 
    falters in the final reel.  Rating: 7 (0 to 10), low +2 
    (-4 to +4) </P>
<P>Stephen King made his reputation on writing horror and that still 
seems to be the major portion of his output.  These days, however, 
the films made from his horror stories are definitely of secondary 
quality to those that do not have  strong fantasy content.  King 
is better when he concentrates on human drama than on the 
supernatural.  This film based on only one part of his novel 
HEARTS IN ATLANTIS basically ignores most, though not all, of the 
fantasy elements of the book. </P>
<P>Robert Garfield (played by David Morse) is a photographer 
returning to the neighborhood where he grew up.  He is visiting 
the funeral of a childhood friend.  He asks about Carol Gerber, 
the girl who was the other close friend, only to discover that she 
had recently passed away.  Robert thinks back to 1960 when he was 
eleven.  Bobby (played just a little too maturely by Anton 
Yelchin) lived with his widowed mother.  Then boarder Ted 
Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins) comes to live with the Garfields.  
Though his mother takes an immediate dislike to him, for Bobby the 
boarder opens up new worlds.  Ted turns Bobby onto the world of 
literature and forever changes Bobby's outlook on the world. </P>
<P>Bobby and Ted's relationship is made difficult by Bobby's mother 
(Hope Davis), a woman who makes all the wrong decisions in her own 
life and blames the result on others.  She has poisoned Bobby's 
mind against his dead father suspects the worst of Ted.  Bobby's 
mother is right about Ted in at least one regard.  There is 
something not normal about the recluse.  He seems to have psychic 
powers that tell him things about the future.  And Ted is on the 
run from men who know about those powers and want to use them.  
The book's fantasy element is much reduced in the William Goldman 
(MARATHON MAN, THE PRINCESS BRIDE) adaptation of one section of 
the book by Stephen King.  Scott Hicks who directed SHINE and SNOW 
FALLING ON CEDARS directs here.  In general his style is nostalgic 
and romanticized, though he somewhat unimaginatively creates a lot 
of the mood by playing the popular music of the 1960 period.  Also 
though the cars we see seem a bit old for the setting.  Goldman's 
or King's view of the "good kids" is a little too Simon Pure and 
cliched as he follows them down railroad tracks and swimming at 
the local water hole, slaking their thirsts with the carton of 
milk they brought along.  Nobody I remember was that good a kid.  
Once he has lulled us into this idyllic view of 1960 the 
introduction of some nasty violence in the latter part of the film 
comes as something of a shock. </P>
<P>HEARTS IN ATLANTIS is a Castle Rock Entertainment production.  
They do the best adaptations of Stephen King, including the now 
classic THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.  HEARTS IN ATLANTIS is a cut 
below that film, but still a good production.  I rate it 7 on the 
0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale. </P>
