<PRE>"Dragon" -- In Need of a Sense of Humor
by Homer Yen
(c) 2001</PRE>
<P>A friend of mine who recently visited France remarked
that the people there lacked a sense of humor.  But
how could that be?  After watching this film, how can
you NOT laugh at the French police force, which
appears to be the most inept law enforcement agency in
all of Europe?  Their bumbling methods make it seem as
if they all graduated with top honors from Inspector
Clouseau's Academy for the Dimwitted.</P>
<P>In "Kiss of the Dragon," however, the intent is not to
elicit laughter.  And that's too bad because there are
oodles of opportunities to make this a really fun
film.  Just think of all the wacky situations that our
hero, Jet Li, could have found himself in.  He plays
Johnny, an operative from Beijing sent to Paris to
help the local police crack an important case. 
Diminutive, unable to speak the language, and
unaccustomed to their way of police work, it makes you
wonder how these two governments could even agree to
such an arrangement.   Meanwhile, Johnny is humbly
reserved, but while in Paris, stays with a colleague
who makes his hideaway in a seedy, prostitute-infested
area.  Here is the perfect 'fish-out-of-water' set up.
 But the film's tone opts for moody atmosphere rather
than lighthearted earnestness.</P>
<P>Any laughter that occurs is more the result of the
absurdity of the on-screen action.  For example, every
time Jet Li dispatches a thug, there's another taller
and more muscular thug in the background that steps up
to attack.  He fells opponents in a variety of wild
ways such as by ramming a pair of chopsticks into the
throat.  My favorite scene, though, was when he
executed a balletic scissors kick that propelled a
pool ball across the room and into the forehead of a
surprised bad guy.  "Yeah, right!" we say to ourselves
under our breath.  It's a strange juxtaposition of
silliness and violence.   Alas, the one thing that Jet
Li really needs in his arsenal of lightning-speed
punches, roundhouse kicks, and weapons mastery is an
ability to give a beaming smile.  Yes, this film
desperately needs to strip away its stoicism and find
a sense of humor.  </P>
<P>But for those of you who just want to see Jet Li kick
butt, you won't be disappointed.  The plot provides a
string of sequences that showcases Li's athleticism
and martial arts skills, which are quite impressive. 
And he'll need every ounce of luck and skill to stay
alive after a corrupt French inspector (Tcheky Karyo)
frames him for the murder.  </P>
<P>Our villainous inspector is another absurd element
that will make you roll your eyes.  We don't so much
mind his cold-blooded nature, but it's hard to believe
his irritatingly odious demeanor and his incessant
snarling in that gravelly French accent.  Perhaps the
feedback levels of the boom mike were a bit out of
whack.</P>
<P>Our lithe hero manages to escape all of the
Inspector's attempts at capturing him even when he is
pursued through sewer drains by SWAT teams, seemingly
trapped on a boat, or surrounded in a dojo facility
with 3 dozen black belts.  Yes, some of this absurdity
becomes entertaining at some point.  And, when Li
decides to stop running and to take matter into his
own hands by infiltrating the Inspector's police
station, this sequence is kind of fun.  Yet, it's too
bad that Li never smiles. This film would have been
more enjoyable if we thought that he was having fun
too.</P>
