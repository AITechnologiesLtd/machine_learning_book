A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Anand Tucker</PRE>
<P>Written by: Frank Cottrell-Boyce, adapted from a book by Hilary and
Piers du Pre</P>
<P>Ingredients: sisters, cello, psychological problems</P>
<P>Starring: Rachel Griffiths, Emily Watson</P>
<P>Synopsis:
Hilary (Rachel Griffiths) and Jackie (Emily Watson) are two musical
sisters, but HILARY AND JACKIE is mostly about Jackie because it is
based on the real life of extraordinary cellist Jacqueline du Pre. In
the story, cello genius Jackie has mental problems. On the one hand she
maintains an intensely jealous psychological rivalry against her sister
Hilary. On the other hand, Jackie shares an overpowering bond of
sisterly love with Hilary. This leads to bizarre escapades such as
Jackie's trying to share Hilary's husband, and trying to destroy a
priceless cello by freezing it in cold weather. Will everything turn out
all right for the troubled cellist?</P>
<P>Opinion:
There are two ways to take this story. On the one hand, if you walk into
the film blind, the cinematic style is troublesome. The plot wanders
unfocused until an emotional ending puts up a syrupy "that's life"
theme. On the other hand, if you're a big cello fan, interested in the
material, and are familiar with the story of the brilliant Jacqueline du
Pre, then you could become intrigued by the enigmatic, factual element
of du Pre's tragic life. Emily Watson gives a solid performance as the
beloved cellist.</P>
