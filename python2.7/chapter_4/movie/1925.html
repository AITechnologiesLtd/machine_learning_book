<PRE>                                 MADE IN AMERICA
                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     As a result of a simple science class blood test, Zora Matthews
(Nia Long) discovers that the man she had long thought of as her
father couldn't be.  After confronting her mother with this disarming
truth, Sarah Matthews (Whoopi Goldberg) confesses to Zora that she is a
product of artificial insemination.  This sparks a quest for Zora to
discover her real father.  After getting the information from the sperm
bank's records, she goes to meet Hal Jackson (Ted Danson), and finds
out that the man whose sperm her mother used is rude, crude, and, worst
of all, white.</P>
<P>     Yeah, there are a lot of implausibilities in this script, but the
story moves along snappily enough that most of them are easily
overlooked.  More difficult to miss is Richard Benjamin's occasionally
inadequate direction.  There are numerous scenes that could have been a
whole lot funnier had Benjamin been more deft in choreographing them.
Too often, he is heavy-handed, but the film survives in spite of him.</P>
<P>     The first half of MADE IN AMERICA is highly amusing.  Comedy is
divided nicely between the outrageous and the subtle (although Bejamin
likes to "point out" the less obvious moments by using tricks such as
slow-motion).  Unfortunately, the comic momentum fades as the film
moves to a climax, with the big "plot twist" near the end seeming like
something out of bad television melodrama.  There are a lot of
different ways that the story could have gone; the route it chooses is
less-than-satisfying.</P>
<P>     Surprisingly, although this is billed as a romantic comedy, I
didn't find the romance between Sarah and Hal of particular note.
Despite the rumors linking Goldberg and Danson together off-screen,
there doesn't seem to be much chemistry between them.  Far better are
the interactions between mother and daughter, and father and daughter.
I could believe these, which are at times touching and sweet, and on
other occasions laced with bitterness.</P>
<P>     There's no question that the best performance is given by Nia
Long.  Goldberg and Danson don't have to stretch much to keep in
character.  Hal is little more than a southern extension of CHEERS' Sam
Malone and Sarah Matthews echoes roles that Goldberg has played in the
past (a politically correct African-American single mother).  Jennifer
Tilly has a minor role as Hal's blond, airheaded, helium-voiced
girlfriend.  This seems to be a part that she was born to play.  Never
have I been more impressed with Ms. Tilly's acting than when she
stares into the camera with that vacuous expression.</P>
<P>     One of the failures of MADE IN AMERICA is in the way it introduces
the two main characters.  At the outset of the film, both Sarah and Hal
are portrayed as irresponsible, arrogant, and thoroughly dislikeable.
Although they soften as the story progresses, and the audience
gradually warms to them, this is not a positive way to start a movie.
It's typical in a romantic comedy for one of the partners to be acerbic
and unpleasant, but it's unusual for this to be true of both of them.
Had the comedy been less fresh, MADE IN AMERICA might have lost me
early on.</P>
<P>     As far as comedies go, this one is above-average, primarily
because there aren't many clunkers among its jokes.  Character
development is so-so, and there are number of  problems, some of which
are significant, about the way the story progresses during the last
half-hour.  Overall, however, MADE IN AMERICA is enjoyable.  It handles
the issue of a mixed-race relationship sensitively (instead of
sensationalistically) and presents an intriguing look at a very
different family dynamic.</P>
