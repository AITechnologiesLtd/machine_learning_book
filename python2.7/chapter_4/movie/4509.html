<PRE>                          HONEY, I BLEW UP THE KID
                       A film review by Edwin Jahiel
                        Copyright 1996 Edwin Jahiel</PRE>
<P>HONEY, I BLEW UP THE KID (1992) * 1/2. Directed by Randal 
Kleiser. Written by Thom Eberhardt, Peter Elbling, Garry 
Goodrow. Cinematography, John Hora. Production design, Leslie 
Dilley. Cast: Daniel and Joshua Shalikar, Rick Moranis, Marcia 
Strassman, Robert Oliveri, Amy O'Neill, Lloyd Bridges et al. A 
Walt Disney release. 89 minutes. Rated PG. </P>
<P>A honey of a movie? Not. Its predecessor, "Honey, I Shrunk the 
Kids," was far richer in possibilities, suspense, plot, 
characters and humor. </P>
<P>Had the filmmakers kept faith with the original's grammar, the 
sequel would have been titled "Honey, I Blown Up the Kid." But 
nobody cares about tradition these days. </P>
<P>It's all about Adam, played by the Shalikar twins who are 
variously reported as 2 or 2 1/2 years old. It depends, I 
suppose, from whether you count the age at the start or the 
end of the filming.  </P>
<P>Accidentally zapped by a special ray, Adam becomes larger each 
time he is exposed to an electromagnetic force field. In 
stages, he reaches 112 feet--at least that's what the press 
release says--a world record for a human. The previous 
champion I could locate was "The Amazing Colossal Man," only 
60 feet tall.  </P>
<P>The ray's inventor is Wayne Szalinski, Adam's dad. He is once 
again played by Rick Moranis as a hyper type and a super 
high-tech Rube Goldberg. He looks dim and is inept with simple 
daily chores. Welcome back to the old cliche about the 
absent-minded professor, the spacey scientist or the 
intellectual discombobulated by "real" life. (A lot of 
strange people are named Wayne these days, in movies).  </P>
<P>"Honey 2" is a single-joker, whereas "Honey1" had variety. The 
Spanish saying "if you lie down with babies, you wake up  wet" 
applies here. If your entire movie is about a colossal kid, 
there's little you can do except follow him with the camera, 
hope for the best and try to be flexible, fitting whatever 
baby does to your framework. </P>
<P>As Adam's size increases so does the movie's yawn quotient. 
Two feeble mini-subplots--Wayne's nasty superior, Adam's older 
brother and a babysitter--are of small help. The film does 
very little with people, context or dialogue. It's all about 
special effects and Adam's "ooh, aah" cuteness. Big deal. Adam 
doesn't say much either. A little Eve would have been more 
interesting, since girls seem to develop speech faster.  </P>
<P>I retained just one nice, throwaway conceit and two good 
lines. The Szalinskis' suburb in desert-surrounded Las Vegas 
is called "Vista del Mar" ("Sea View"). The sentences, funny 
in context, are: "There's no way I'm changing those diapers" 
and "Look at that mother!"   </P>
<P>The special effects bring modern techniques to the venerable 
screen genres about gigantic people, animals or prehistoric 
creatures, whose size was caused by arrested evolution, 
encounters with aliens, nuclear radiation and such.  Some of 
those pictures became classics, like "The Lost World" (1924) 
or, better yet, "King Kong" with all its mythological, 
Freudian or sociological implications. Sometimes, as in "The 
Attack of the 50 Ft.Woman," the movies dreadful enough to 
become howls.  </P>
<P>"Honey 2" is neither campy, droll, or suspenseful. You know 
that no harm will come to the child, that Adam will do only 
material damage,  and that he will get back to regulation size 
at the end. I heard just one big laugh from the audience, and 
this from an adult. The many children in the theater were 
quiet throughout. Confused by the sights? By the technobabble? 
Overawed? Plain bored? </P>
<P>Nowadays even the best special effects seldom impress the 
public. We take movie magic for granted. It is no longer like 
earlier periods when giant squids, invisible men or 
Lilliputians took the spectators' breath away and had them 
asking each other: "How did they do it?"  </P>
<P>In the small part of a laboratory watchman is redhead Ken 
Tobey, that likable second-shelf actor, who, as Kenneth Tobey, 
had his hour of glory when he played the lead in the classic 
sci-fi horror "The Thing" of 1951. Nice to see him again. It's 
a small bonus for aficionados clutching at straws.  </P>
