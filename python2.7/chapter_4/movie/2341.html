<PRE>                                HEAVEN AND EARTH
                       A film review by Richard Montanari
                        Copyright 1994 Richard Montanari</PRE>
<PRE>Caution:  Falling Stone<HR></PRE>
<P>     It is a well known fact that, when testosterone seeps into the
brain, a host of aberrant behaviors are possible.  This condition seems
to be most virulent in the middle-aged macho radical who, when faced
with the grown-up notion that he really *isn't* going to change the
world, begin to mutate into a sort of heavily-armed Amway salesman from
Berkeley who won't get off your porch.</P>
<P>     For Oliver Stone, who has always fancied himself the keeper of
conspiracies in America, the Vietnam war has obviously been a very
difficult thing to expiate.  On the other hand, the Vietnam war has
also been very, very good to Oliver Stone.</P>
<P>     In his films, Stone has shown us the war through the eyes of a
naive young infantryman (PLATOON, 1986), an embittered, disabled veteran
(BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, 1989), and now, with HEAVEN AND EARTH, he
tells us the same story once again, this time through the eyes of a
Vietnamese woman.</P>
<P>     Based on the books WHEN HEAVEN AND EARTH CHANGED PLACES and CHILD
OF WAR, WOMAN OF PEACE by Le Ly Hayslip, HEAVEN AND EARTH chronicles
the war for Le Ly (Hiep Thi Le) a farm girl from a primeval village
near Da Nang.</P>
<P>     The story opens in 1953 with Le Ly's mother, played by Joan Chen,
teaching her daughter the ancient ways of the rice paddy.  But soon,
colonialism arrives in the guise of *the French*.</P>
<P>     Sure, the Vietnamese people had been enslaved and butchered by a
number of masters--including the Chinese--but, as Stone is quick to
remind us, this, like the Americans to come, is occidental occupation,
which makes it more insidious somehow.</P>
<P>     Under French occupation, we are witness to numerous scenes of Le
Ly's degradation.  She is raped by a local Viet Cong leader and
subjected to electroshock therapy at the hands of the South Vietnamese
army.</P>
<P>     Le Ly and her mother then head to Saigon, where they find employ
as maids to a local businessman and his socialite wife.  But the
businessman seduces and impregnates Le Ly, and she is banished.</P>
<P>     A few years later Le Ly meets army lifer Steve Butler (Tommy Lee
Jones).  Although it is clear to us early on that the war has unhinged
Butler, Le Ly takes pity on him, a feeling that eventually turns to
love.  After the war, they try to lead a normal life in San Diego but,
as Le Ly discovers, the jungle still rages within them both, and the
war, at least in their hearts and minds, is far from over.</P>
<P>     Oliver Stone's mandatory, fourth-quarter "duality of nature"
speech is, of course, intact here, this time covering heaven and
earth, good and evil, night and day, hot and cold, young and old, man
and wife, Vietnam and America--it's almost longer than Costner's
interminable wail at the end of JFK.</P>
<P>     But is not only subject matter that has stagnated Stone's work.
His metaphorical resources have run so dry that, for instance, every
time life confronts Le Ly in HEAVEN AND EARTH, Stone supports the
moment with a quick stare into space and some flashbacks to either
Buddha, Mom and Dad, an ox, a flame thrower or a straw hat blowing
across a rice paddy.  In fact, when Le Ly visits an American grocery
store for the first time, you half-expect her to call upon Lord Buddha
to shed spiritual light on her dilemma:  Frozen or Canned?
Batter-dipped or Lightly Breaded?  Paper or Plastic?</P>
<P>     As the seething Butler, Tommy Lee Jones brings an indefinable rage
to the under-written role, a character-type that was far better served
in ROLLING THUNDER (1977).  Joan Chen is superb as Le Ly's aging
mother, as is Hiep Thi Le as the fragile, resourceful Le Ly.</P>
<P>     But for those of us who remember him as the man who wrote MIDNIGHT
EXPRESS and YEAR OF THE DRAGON, Oliver Stone is rapidly becoming that
cigar-smoking, boozy uncle who always has to be carried out of the
party.  You want to like him, he occasionally gets off a good one, but
the act, like the smoke, is getting awfully stale.</P>
