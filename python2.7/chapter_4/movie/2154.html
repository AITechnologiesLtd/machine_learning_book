<PRE>                                    MALICE
                       A film review by Sarah M. Elkins
                        Copyright 1993 Sarah M. Elkins</PRE>
<P>     I have to compliment whoever made the TV ads for MALICE.  For
once, you get an accurate taste of the movie without the plot being
given away.  I would advise those intrigued by the ads to go ahead and
see it before reading a review which gives away more than mine -- even
reviewers like me who avoid giving spoilers without warning would be
hard-pressed to review MALICE without at least hinting at some of the
generous number of twists.</P>
<P>MALICE --  1993, original, complex thriller</P>
<P>PLOT/KICK-OFF:  A serial killer stalks a quiet college town.
Meanwhile, one of the college profs meets the new hotshot surgeon and
realizes that they knew each other in high school.  Meanwhile, his wife
suffers sharp abdominal pains from time to time.  What will be the
connections between these threads?  Not what I thought!</P>
<P>CHARACTERS/ACTING:  Alec Baldwin as the doctor, Bill Pullman as the
college professor, Nicole Kidman as his wife, Bebe Neuwirth (Lillian on
CHEERS) as the police detective.  With the exception of Bebe's valiant
attempt at some urban accent (Boston? Brooklyn? the Bronx? the fault
could be mine in simply not being familiar enough with the locale), the
acting is excellent, with a wide range demanded from Baldwin, Kidman,
and Pullman.</P>
<P>CINEMATOGRAPHY/FX:  Unobtrusive but sharp photography makes the cast
and scenery look beautiful, antiseptic, or gritty as the plot demands.
There's no one outstanding shot I can call to mind, but the look and
feel will suffer a bit on the small screen.</P>
<P>SCORE/SOUND:  Fine.  Some pop & rock, and "mood" music.</P>
<P>VIOLENCE/GORE/LANGUAGE:  Operating room scenes are a bit bloody but not
the worst I've seen.  Some obscenities and bullets thrown around.  A
nasty close-range fight (heads slammed into walls, objects swung at and
hitting bodies).</P>
<P>SKIN/SITUATIONS:  If you saw NYPD BLUES's opening night, expect a
similar amount of female skin.  More of Alec Baldwin than has been
shown before, though various nekkid women on top of him (not at the
same time or even in the same evening) barely cover certain
essentials.</P>
<P>ANALYSIS:  The movie is not a let-down compared to the ads.  It is not
a standard "main-character-in-jeopardy" thriller, either.  There is one
plot twist which seemed unlikely to me, but I can't think how they
could have fixed it without major re-writes, and it wasn't major enough
to get in the way of my enjoying the movie.  The pacing is good, though
it demands a few leaps of intuition on some of the characters' parts
(rather than slower periods of discovery).  Most of the pleasure I got
from this movie was from the many twists, most of which I had not
guessed beforehand.  There were also, though, some nice moments of
character interaction not required for what could have been just a taut
thriller.  I liked the way events and characters were developed in this
movie.  With the names involved, I was a little afraid of it just being
a vehicle, but this movie was a pleasant surprise.</P>
