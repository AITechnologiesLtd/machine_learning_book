<PRE>                           ROMEO AND JULIET
                       A film review by Tim Voon
                        Copyright 1997 Tim Voon</PRE>
<P>Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes, Brian Dennehy, John Leguizamo,
Pete Postlethwaite, Paul Sorvino, Miriam Margolyes, Diane Venora, Harold
Perrineau Director: Baz Luhrmann. Screenplay: Craig Pearce and Baz
Luhrmann based on the play by William Shakespeare</P>
<P>I have read reports that claim this movie glamorised teen-age suicide. I
cannot agree. If someone wants to kill themselves, they're going to kill
themselves. Although there is a small possibility, that some movies, may
just tip an emotionally unstable person over the edge; it doesn't have
to be Shakespeare.</P>
<P>Well, whatever. I'm sure Shakespeare didn't have these tedious, social
issues to worry about, when writing 'Romeo and Juliet.' Some people have
found this movie to be too loud, noisy, splashy and colourful for their
liking. I can understand what they mean, but I personally didn't mind.
What I was more fascinated with was the lyrical beauty of the language
that was spoken:</P>
<P>'Two households both alike in dignity,
In fair Verona where we lay our scene.
>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes,
A pair of star crossed lovers take their life.' .</P>
<P>Comment: Close your eyes and hear the TALENT that is SHAKESPEARE.</P>
