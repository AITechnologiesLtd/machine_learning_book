<PRE>                                    ERASER
                       A film review by Lori Ann Chauvette
                        Copyright 1996 Lori Ann Chauvette</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:
Arnold Schwarzenneger
Vanessa Williams
James Caan
Robert Pastorelli</PRE>
<P>What can I say?  Arnold has done it again with his latest film, "Eraser".</P>
<P>He plays Witness Protection Program employee John Kruger, in charge of
"erasing" people's identities in order to protect them.  This time his
charge is Lee Cullen (Williams), a woman who knows too much about the
dirty dealings at a weapons corporation.</P>
<P>There's not really much more you can say about the plot.  And I don't
think anyone who goes to see Schwarzennegar films really cares.  There
was a director who once said to Roger Ebert that in order for a movie
to be great, it has to have at least three good scenes and no bad
scenes.  And in Ebert's review, he said, "This movie has four good
scenes and no bad scenes."  And I would have to agree with him on that
point.</P>
<P>Despite the probably many impossibilities in this film, such as the
cannon-guns used by the bad guys, this movie kept my attention
throughout.  The one-liners (Arnold's trademark) were fast and funny,
the action was the best of any Schwarzennegar film in history, and
Pastorelli was great as the Mafioso- witness who was helped by
Schwarzennegar in the beginning of the film, providing even more comic
relief.  If I wasn't cheering, I was laughing.  And that's what an
action movie should be.</P>
<P>Three and a half stars (out of a possible four)</P>
