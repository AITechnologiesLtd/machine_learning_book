<P>     Tourists rushing to beaches and lakes.  Fireworks on the Fourth of 
July.  Lying outside, basking in the sun.  Going to a baseball game.  
These are some of the rites of summer.  Another is the time-honored 
tradition of movie studios jettisoning the dregs of their vaults every 
August.  Thus we are presented with HOUSE ARREST, a distressingly 
unfunny, unintelligent children's fantasy about what happens when kids 
ground their parents.  </P>
<P>     Had the film gone for the truly absurd, it might have worked.  And 
there's enough potential drama in key situations for things to have been 
salvageable if writer Michael Hitchcock's script had leaned in the right 
direction.  Unfortunately, HOUSE ARREST takes the predictably pointless 
middle road, burdening its viewers with failed comedy and artificial 
sentimentality.  This movie is put together with so little regard for 
the possibility that someone in the audience might have a brain that the 
experience of watching HOUSE ARREST becomes offensive.  This latest 
"divorce comedy" is vastly inferior to its predecessors, including the 
uneven-but-enjoyable MRS. DOUBTFIRE and the less satisfying BYE BYE 
LOVE.</P>
<P>     The premise has 14-year old Grover Beindorf (Kyle Howard) and his 
younger sister, Stacy (Amy Sakasitz), confining their parents, Ned 
(Kevin Pollock) and Janet (Jamie Lee Curtis), in the basement when the 
couple announces their intention to separate.  With images of divorce 
haunting them, the children decide to keep Mom and Dad imprisoned until 
they sort out their differences.  Unfortunately, Grover makes the 
mistake of mentioning his "solution" to his best friend, Matt (Mooky 
Arizona), and soon there are seven parents locked up for forced "group 
therapy" in the Beindorfs' basement, and six kids partying upstairs.</P>
<P>     Meanwhile, outside, an old police chief who looks like a retired 
Martian (Ray Walston) is trying to figure out what's going on in his 
neighbors' house.  So he starts snooping around, giving director Harry 
Winer an opportunity to exhume a few tired, HOME ALONE-type physical 
gags.  There's a problem, though -- when Chris Columbus did this sort of 
stuff six years ago, it was funny.  Here, ripped off and diluted, it's 
not worth even a half-hearted chuckle.</P>
<P>     Instead of using flatulence to generate humor, HOUSE ARREST falls 
back on another old standby:  food fights.  At one point, junk food is 
hurled across a living room in a grotesque orgy of cookies, chips, and 
chocolate.  Later, one character receives a cake to the face.  And I 
can't fail to mention the memorable scene where everyone spits champagne 
all over the dinner table.  How witty!  How funny!</P>
<P>     The so-called "characters" in HOUSE ARREST fall into one of two 
categories:  boring or obnoxious.  Classify Grover, his sister, his 
parents, and half of the other grown-ups as the former.  The rest, 
including a whiny Wallace Shawn, an overly-belligerent Christopher 
McDonald, and a ditzy-as-usual Jennifer Tilly, run the gamut from 
slightly irritating to fingernails-on-the-blackboard unbearable.</P>
<P>     For a while, it seems like HOUSE ARREST is going to have a message.  
As voiced by Jennifer Love Hewitt's teenage personae, it goes something 
like this:  "Our parents aren't going  to change just because we want 
them to."  Translated:  if Mom and Dad are screwed up, it's not the 
kids' fault.  Unfortunately, only moments after making this statement, 
HOUSE ARREST goes to great pains to invalidate it, since every parent is 
miraculously transformed into exactly what their offspring wish for.</P>
<P>     Undoubtedly, certain undiscriminating children will enjoy this 
film, if only for the vicarious thrill of imagining what it might be 
like to trick their mother and father into this parent trap.  However, 
unlike the season's better family-oriented offerings (like HARRIET THE 
SPY and MATILDA), few adults will find anything even momentarily 
diverting in these proceedings.  Opportunities to make the film 
palatable are frequently passed up, and we're left feeling more trapped 
than the adults in the Beindorfs' cellar.  After enduring HOUSE ARREST, 
I'm convinced it's the film makers who deserve to be grounded.</P>
