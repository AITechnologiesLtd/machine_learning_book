<P>"The Third Man" tells the story of a writer, Holly Martins, searching for the
true details regarding the mysterious death of a close friend Harry Lime. This
brief outline of the plot makes "The Third Man" sound like the majority of
films in the noir genre. However, Carol Reed's masterpiece is far from the
norm. The setting takes place in post World War 2 Vienna, Austria, a very
chaotic atmosphere in which the Allied Powers police the streets and the black
market dominates the economy. Since Vienna contains a number of different
nationalities living in the same region, there are various communication
problems and because of this, it is difficult to tell who is on whose side.
Reed takes full advantage of this chaotic, paranoid environment. His
unbelievable control over light and dark is what specifically makes this film
stand out from others. His use of shadows in dark alley ways or sewers creates
some memorable chase scenes. In these scenes, Reed mainly displays shadows
chasing after shadows, with very few shots of the actual humans. This is
extremely clever because with shadows you never know exactly where someone is
and also with dark figures it adds to the mysteriousness of the environment.
Reed presents some of the most beautiful black and white shots have ever seen.
It is truly amazing how detailed he makes some of the night scenes.</P>
<P>"The Third Man" is also strongly supported with an excellent script by novelist
Graham Greene. As the film progresses, we learn more and more about the
supposedly accidental murder of Lime (Orson Welles) and who Lime really is. The
film begins with Martins (Joseph Cotten) learning about Lime's accidental death
but when he reaches the funeral there is a very strained and dubious mood. This
mood shows that Lime's death certainly has another story to it. Thus the
mystery begins with Martins interviewing Lime's friends. Through these
interviews Lime and the viewer simultaneously discover more evidence until a
porter informs us that there was a third man carrying Lime's body when everyone
else swore there were only two. At this point in the film, paranoia reaches its
zenith. It is very difficult to tell what exactly is going on. Who is lying?
Who is telling the truth? Who is to trust? Who is the third man?? Greene asks
these questions and does not give the answer until you least expect it.</P>
<P>The performances in the film are also flawless. Cotten plays Martins perfectly
as your not-so-average hero. He drinks heavily, he is a failing writer, and he
does not get the girl. You may not even agree with some of his final moral
decisions. Martins' appearance just shows that the effects of the war were
devastating and virulent on all. Since Martins, once very successful, was
obviously hurt by the war even though the film never really adresses the topic.
The outcome of Welles' Harry Lime is another effect of the war. Driven away
from democracy, Lime goes against his friends and loved ones to succeed.
Welles' short but sweet performance answers all of the film's questions about
Lime in a heartbeat.</P>
<P>As this film turns fifty years old, it incredibly still contains the same
adrenaline. A must-see for film noir fans and to those looking for another
masterpiece starring Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten.</P>
<PRE>Grade: **** (out of four)</PRE>
