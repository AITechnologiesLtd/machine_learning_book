<PRE>                        GROSSE POINTE BLANK 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
     3 :-) :-) :-)  for a quirky little comedy about life and death</PRE>

based on a story by Tom Jankewicz</P>
<P>Ever wanted to know what happened to Martin Blank (John Cusack), that
otherwise pleasant young man who disappeared ten years ago leaving his
girlfriend (Minnie Driver) in a $ 700 prom dress. From the class of 86
Grosse Pointe High some will become wealthy real estate agents, others
lowly security guards. There will be a lonely radio talk show host, and
most, if lucky, will get married once or twice; but sometimes, on that
rare occasion of inspirational spontaneity, somebody will decide that
they have the psychological profile of a killer and become a
professional hitman. Three cheers for Martin Blank.</P>
<P>This movie made me laugh and laugh I did. It carries a free flowing
audacity and lack of respect for everything and anything considered
usual. Like when lovers meet again, under the tense circumstance of
separation ten years earlier – first a thick big fat kiss (instead of a
slap) before discussing the issues of hurt and betrayal over the local
airways. This is followed by a heart warming scene of lovers reminiscing
over old times by playing ‘aeroplane' on the bed – you know when
somebody lifts your whole body up with their legs, and you pretend you
can fly. God I love doing that, just don't do it on a full stomach.</P>
<P>So Martin has come back to Grosse Pointe to resolve the past, and also
to find his future. When he holds a baby in his arms we get the feeling
that it's time for him to put the gun down and start picking up the
nappies. After years of assassinating presidents, officials, dogs and
the odd other, there comes a time to settle and lead a more ordinary
life. So in order to be forgiven his past, Martin needs to save the girl
of his dreams and also her father. Only then can he properly proclaim
his love for the darling one he should have married a very long time
ago.</P>
<P>This is by far one of the most original, hilarious, quirky, well written
comedies I've seen this year. It by far outshines that other high school
reunion known simply as ‘Romy and Michelle', and is well worth watching
again.</P>
