<PRE>Numb and Number
Lucky Numbers</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony </PRE>
<P>"Lucky Numbers" is one of those botched criminal activity films where 
one thing goes wrong right after the other; only these culprits are more 
regular-person-esque and less bad-guy-like (a smiley, but dim weatherman 
and a bubbly, but cruel lotto girl for starters.) </P>
<P>Unfortunately, this cute chain of mishaps has little to tie together. 
There's no emotion arc and for a comedy, there's only a handful of good 
laughs. Still the acting is awesome, Travolta and Kudrow rock; and the 
somewhat amusing chain is directed well. </P>
<P>The end result ... a film that would make a fine watch on TV if there 
were nothing else to do, but at the theater ... just can't fill the big 
screen. </P>
