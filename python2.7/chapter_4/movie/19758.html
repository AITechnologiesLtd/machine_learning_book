<P>As Reviewed by James Brundage (MovieKritic2000)</P>
<P> Ah, the wonderful world of mediocrity.  That chasm between good and bad in
which so many movies exist.  You know where I'm talking about.  It is that
place where a movie is entertaining despite the fact that it is terrible.
That place where it has a message but you don't care.  The place where it
drifts aimlessly between the fine line between a good movie and a B movie.</P>
<PRE> No Escape falls into that place.</PRE>
<P> Ironically, No Escape falls into the chasm of mediocrity and seems not to
be able to escape from it.  Instead, it is rather like a crab in a crab
basket: its own competitive nature pulls it back in.</P>
<P> No Escape tries to be both a drama and an action film.  In order to do
this, it sets itself on a place called Absolom, an island prison some thirty
years in the future where two groups constantly compete against each other
for control of their jail.  Looking at the highly beautiful island, I can't
fathom why anyone would pick this place as a prison… but they did.</P>
<P> The story follows Robbins, ex Marine Force Recon who ends up in prison
after shooting a CO.  Being Ray Liotta, everyone is expected to root for
him.  I merely sit the film out.  Having a high aversion to authority, he
pisses the warden at the regular prison off and is sent to Absolom, the
island where no one wants to go.</P>
<P> Let's perform a reality check here.  With an island that beautiful, thirty
years from now it's going to be Club Med.</P>
<P> But, back to the review, Robbins is sent into Absolom where he quickly
encounters Merek, the villain of the story who is a psychopathic fascist
leader of The Outsiders.  Of course, having that same damn aversion to
authority, Robbins kills several people while escaping from Merek and, after
falling a thousand feet and landing in the water (on his back), he
miraculously survives and is taken in by a group of kinder, gentler people
known as The Insiders.  The Insiders run a socialist system, good of the
whole, etc. Their leader is called The Father, and is played by Lance
Henrikson, who's old enough that they should have called him The
Grandfather.</P>
<P> Everyone dreams of freedom but excepts their new life.  Tensions boil
between the insiders and the outsiders.  War erupts.  Ray Liotta saves the
day.</P>
<PRE> Yada, yada, yada.</PRE>
<P> Lifted off of the pages of a sci-fi book, No Escape is your classic
W.W.I.I. metaphor: Fascism versus Socialist and Democratic systems.  There
are spies, betrayals, and, of course, the Americans win in the end.  As I
said, it contains a message but no one, including me, cares.</P>
<P> The movie goes slowly for an action movie because it gets caught up in the
pseudo drama of the moment.  It tries to form characters, tries to form plot
twists, and fails.</P>
<P> However, the small bits of character that it contains are enough to
maintain your attention for roughly two hour running time… that is, along
with the action sequences.</P>
<P> Yeah, No Escape is one of those movies you can just sit back and not really
enjoy.  It is a solution to boredom, a show of mediocrity.  It is in the
chasm, that void of movies that we will all watch if they're on.</P>
<P> It is in the chasm, my friends.  Down at the bottom, leaning towards the
bad but still edible.<HR>MovieKritic2000: Reviews for the generation of a new Millenium
