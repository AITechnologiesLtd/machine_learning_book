-----</PRE>
<P>Ah, Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh, how well we've come to know them.
In "Lethal Weapon 4" they banter back and forth at a mile a minute,
exchanging one-liners so quickly that sometimes we can't keep up.
Sometimes we realize it's just as well we can't keep up; the jokes
probably wouldn't be all that funny if we didn't know these two and
their familiar shtick so well. The "Lethal Weapon" series has managed
to survive so long because it allows its lead characters to interact
in quirky, amusing ways, usually with rapid-fire dialogue exchange.
These two are the definitive team for the buddy cop formula. And Mel
Gibson and Danny Glover, who play the entertaining duo, usually look
like they're having a genuinely good time up there.</P>
<P>All things considered, "Lethal Weapon 4" is an entertaining but
muddled movie. I'll look back on it fondly because it puts these two
guys on the screen for one last dance. But the problem with "Lethal 4"
is that it's torn between two agendas and never quite finds the happy
medium.</P>
<P>On one hand we have a movie that tries tirelessly to bring us up to
date with the lives of all the characters we last saw six years ago in
"Lethal 3," while simultaneously introducing new characters into the
mix. On the other hand, we have the unfolding action movie cop plot,
which often seems so unfocused that it looks as if the screenwriters
considered it only as an afterthought.</P>
<P>On the character plane, we have Riggs and Murtaugh, who must set some
sort of record for continuing to talk at the same time. Meanwhile,
they must also set some sort of record for getting mileage out of what
should be increasingly stale jokes. As always, the two argue over just
when they should go when "going on three." And, of course, their
adventures are bound to answer the question of just how much of
Murtaugh's personal property can be destroyed in the course of a few
days. Here the potentially stale jokes seem more like old friends.</P>
<P>But when you bump into an old friend, that doesn't mean you can simply
ditch your job, which is what "Lethal 4" has a tendency to do. There
is a plot of sorts here, but it's so choppy and constantly interrupted
by more trivial matters that it's hard to get wrapped up in any of it.
It involves a mysterious martial arts expert from Hong Kong (Jet Li)
who is heading some sort of criminal conspiracy involving illegal
Chinese slave labor and some foreign prisoners. The nature of the
conspiracy I won't get into, but it takes so long for the movie to get
this aspect of the plot off the ground that the Li character simply
becomes one of those menacing, half-defined movie villains--and not
all that compelling of one, either. That's too bad, because Li has
some phenomenal martial arts moves.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, there's Li's connection to the murder of some immigrants
and Murtaugh's subsequent attempt to do right by inviting into his
home a family of homeless immigrants he finds at the crime scene. The
notion is amiable, and in the tradition of humanizing the "Lethal
Weapon" characters, but none of this really comes together to a
satisfactory resolution.</P>
<P>Director Richard Donner and the screenwriters don't seemed very
concerned about the plot. The film is more a comedy than anything
else, and plays more like a sitcom than a cop drama. Previous "Lethal"
movies managed to sustain some sort of serious dramatic undercurrent,
but "Lethal 4" can't seem to get its tongue out of its cheek for more
than five seconds at a time.</P>
<P>For example, Chris Rock appears in a major supporting role as a rookie
cop who joins Riggs' and Murtaugh's investigation. Much of Rock's
dialogue is fast and funny, but the personality isn't really a
character so much as an excuse to bring Rock's stand-up routine into
the movie. On that level, it's effective, but there's very little
story-building at work here, despite some of the obvious potential.
Even when it's revealed that Rock's character has been secretly
married to Murtaugh's daughter, it's played for sitcom laughs based on
contrived misunderstandings.</P>
<P>Joe Pesci's appearance as Leo Getz is merely perfunctory, as if he
came back just to recite his obligatory lines--although there's a
quirky scene where Rock and Pesci prove that louder can be better.
Rene Russo reprises her role as Internal Affairs officer Lorna Cole,
but because her character is pregnant she's forced out of most of the
action.</P>
<P>The other "Lethal" movies added something to the canvas of the
characters that felt like genuine development. This story,
unfortunately, is paper-thin and too interested in being lightweight,
warm, and fuzzy. Riggs and Murtaugh exist mostly to get on the screen
and engage their shtick full speed ahead, and not to face any new
personal challenges. Most of what they face in this movie is
trivialized merely to move the jokes along.</P>
<P>But even so, there's room for some stuff that's of interest. I
particularly enjoyed the notion that we've come full circle, and now
Riggs is finally feeling the burden of old age set in. No longer can
he beat the bad guy (or even his sparring partner) purely with his
manic physical prowess. Riggs is realizing that he himself, in the
tradition of the long-lived "Lethal" catchphrase, is "too old for this
s---."</P>
<P>Even if Riggs and Murtaugh *are* too old for such nonsense, the series
proves it still has some energy left in its action sequences. There's
an exhilarating chase sequence--involving Riggs being dragged down the
highway on a table attached with a plastic tarp to a mobile home--that
is gleefully destructive. I also liked the manic comic goofiness of
the opening minutes of the movie, where a madman in armor blow torches
an entire city block. A showdown with Li near the end is also nicely
staged, although it goes so far over the top that it becomes absurd.</P>
<P>There's also a bizarre interrogation scene that takes place in a
dental office, where, through events that I won't even begin to
describe, the room fills with nitrous oxide, causing everyone in the
room to laugh uncontrollably. The scene isn't one of the movie's high
points, but you've got to give the filmmakers credit for going all
out.</P>
<P>"Lethal Weapon 4" is the least of the series, but it serves its
purpose: It's goofy, mindless summer entertainment. It could've been
more than that, but for what it does it gets the job done.</P>
<P>It's obvious this film exists more to please fans of the "Lethal"
series--and to give its cast and crew their final curtain call--than
it does to tell a story. The ending has a ring of finality to it,
which is hammered home with a surprising overabundance of narcissism.
Indeed, the excessively cheesy final minutes of "Lethal Weapon 4" feel
almost like the final episode of a high-rated sitcom series. But I did
find the ending strangely infectious, even poignant.</P>
<P>I will miss Riggs and Murtaugh. And all of their friends and family as
well.</P>
