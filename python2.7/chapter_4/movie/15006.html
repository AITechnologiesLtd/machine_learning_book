<PRE>                              THE MIGHTY
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Two outcast boys, one learning-
          impaired but physically imposing, the other
          intelligent but physically handicapped, form a
          close friendship in this moving family film.  Max
          and Kevin help each other through their personal
          problems and together make one whole and formidable
          person.  While the plot is predictable, the film is
          substantial and as entertaining for an adult as it
          would be for a teen.  Rating: 7 (0 to 10), +2 (-4
          to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Nobody expects very much of Max Cane (Eldon Henson) the son of a
man in prison for murder.  Max himself is learning impaired and is
spending his third year in the seventh grade.  Nature has not been kind
to Max who is big, mean-looking, and rather ugly.  Kids in school call
him Killer Cane, (perhaps an allusion to the Buck Rogers character;
there are other science fiction allusions).  A local hoodlum gang, The
Dog House Boys, are not sure if they want to pick on him or if they
want him to join their ranks.  Max's life is somewhat less than
satisfying, living with his dour grandparents (Harry Dean Stanton and
Gena Rowlands) and getting the knocks he does at school.  Then a new
boy moves in next door.  This is Kevin Dillon (Kieron Culkin) with a
sadly twisted body and a genuine intellect.  Kevin lives with his
mother Gwen (Sharon Stone) and does "kid-intellectual things" like
reading and playing with scientific toys.  A birth defect has left
Kevin with a bent spine and an inability to walk without his crutches.
Neither boy is much good at making friends, but Kevin immediately sees
that Max is almost a perfect complement to himself. Where he is
strongest, Max is weakest; where he is weakest, Max is strongest.  But
Max has no interest in being friends with his bookish neighbor and
Kevin has to bribe him with money to act as his legs.</P>
<P>     Max is a poor reader and is given Kevin for a reading tutor.
Kevin has Max read Sir James Knowles's LEGENDS OF KING ARTHUR AND HIS
KNIGHTS and uses it to inspire Max to read like no professional teacher
has been able to.  Max carries Kevin on his shoulders and together they
become one person whom, after the style of King Arthur, they dub Freak
the Mighty.  Then time and again their frame their friendship in
Arthurian terms, as if they are a knight in quest of adventure.
Together each is able to face up to his personal problems and either
overcome them or accept them.  While the film travels a predictable
course, it is a credible one.</P>
<P>     This is director Peter Chelsom's third film and he seems to do
something entirely different each time.  His HEAR MY SONG was likable
nostalgic comedy set in London and Ireland.  His second film FUNNY
BONES was a very dark and strange look into the world of the stand-up
comic mostly taking place in bleak Liverpool.  Now he tells the story
about friendship set in South Cincinnati.  Eldon Henson is a good
choice for Max and is certainly not the appealing sort of young actor
one generally sees in film.  On the other hand Kieron Culkin is
obviously a Culkin but one who is not so saccharine as his brother
Macaulay.  Sharon Stone is making the transition from glamorous actress
to character player skillfully.  One sees little of her previous
sensationalist roles in her Gwen.  Here she does a forty-ish mother
with real strength.  Max's grandparents are supposed to be as humorless
as the people in "American Gothic," but they are played by Harry Dean
Stanton and Gena Rowlands.  The one problem in that casting is that
Harry Dean Stanton has a hard time looking humorless.  Even when he is
trying to be serious there is always a twinkle in his eye.</P>
<P>     THE MIGHTY is a Canadian production with a screenplay by Charles
Leavitt, based on the novel FREAK THE MIGHTY by Rodman Philbrick.  It
is broken into chapters, like a book, and narrated by Max.  The score
is melodic with a strong Irish influence that seems a little out of
place with non-Irish characters and the Ohio setting.  John De Borman's
camera seems to see Cincinnati as a city of hard steel bridges and
concrete, just over the hill from the boys' homes.</P>
<P>     This is really not simply a children's film but a family film and
one that adults can enjoy.  It had very good word of mouth at the
Toronto International Film Festival (though it was not one of the films
I saw there) and deservedly so.  I rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and
a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
