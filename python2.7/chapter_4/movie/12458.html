TAXI DRIVER
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1998</PRE>
<P>When people are talking about good old times, they actually want to make
some bad times look better. Nice example of such behaviour is
contemporary attitude of popular media towards the 1970s. For new
generations, Superseventies are the lost Golden Age of chic fashion,
cult TV shows and sexual freedom unchecked by AIDS. For people who
actually had to live in that period, it was the Gloomy Decade, marked by
lost ideals of 1968, rampant inflation and unemployment, international
terrorism, fuel crisis and loss of faith in almost anything that
previous generation stood for. Feelings of despair and nihilism found
its reflections in many films of that era. Martin Scorsese's TAXI
DRIVER, which symbolises both the glory and despair of the Seventies, is
most celebrated of them all.</P>
<P>The movie's protagonist is Travis Bickle (Robert de Niro), 26-year old
former Marine who takes the job of taxi driver in New York City because
he can't sleep at nights. The job gets him exposed to the dark side of
apocalyptic megalopolis, and Travis gradually gets alienated from the
rest of world. The only bright spot in his life is Betsy (Cybil
Sheperd), attractive woman working in Senator Palantine's presidential
campaign. Their date ends as humiliating fiasco because Travis makes
fatal mistake by inviting her to porno movie theatre. Losing his only
link to better side of the world, Travis gradually descends into
psychosis, becoming convinced that his mission in life is to battle scum
on the street. He purchases a formidable arsenal of guns and begins
physical preparations for the inevitable conflict. That conflict finally
comes when he takes personal interest in Iris (Jodie Foster), 12-year
old prostitute who temporarily took refuge in his taxi.</P>
<P>As many great movies that got cult status through the years, TAXI DRIVER
became the object of many interpretations. For some critics and scholars
it is an exploration of universal subjects that date back to Dostoyevski
- loss of moral compass in a bleak reality of dirty, overpopulated
industrial cities; the story could have been set in 19th Century same as
in our times. For others, the movie uses Raskolnikov-like figure in
order to portray burning problems of 1970s America - its apparent
inability to deal with the consequences of rapid social changes that
occurred in previous decade.</P>
<P>Brilliant performance of Robert De Niro in role of a lifetime can give
arguments for both sides. His Travis Bickle has a lot in common with
most of the average viewers of today - many of us share his feelings of
isolation, loneliness and outrage towards crime, drugs, prostitution and
senseless street violence. His pathetic attempts to establish some kind
of human connection with the people around him, sometimes in most
unusual circumstances - like with Secret Service agents, pimps or job
interviewers - make him a person too goofy to be the hero, and too
pathetic to be the classic villain. However, most of the average viewers
are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned
citizens or troubled souls from fanatical madmen. But despite anything,
average viewer at the end actually cheers for Travis - his crusade
against "scum" is something that average person wants, but doesn't have
a stomach/lack of brains to do it.</P>
<P>While De Niro's Travis might come in and out of particular times and
places, other persons that appear in the film (mostly played by the
character actors) give it distinctively 1970s feel. Wizzard (played by
Peter Boyle) presents the only link with America's better past; but only
because he is the oldest taxi driver in company and therefore everybody
assumes that he "knows stuff". His obvious inadequacy in giving advice
to troubled Travis illustrates the inability of pre-1960s generations to
find answers to the problems of Gloomy Decade. Other characters, on the
other hand, show the bad side of New Age. Matthew "Sport" (Keitel, who
befriended real-life pimps in other to prepare for his role of a
lifetime) is dressed like a hippie; Iris found excuse for her escape to
the world of drugs and child prostitution in a ideology of
Counterculture. Porno movies, that should be the element of new times of
sexual freedom, are too much even for supposedly "liberated" Betsy. Even
the politicians, like Senator Palantine, are lost in post-Vietnam and
post-Watergate mess; his broad and senseless "messages" that cover the
lack of any serious program can't fool even such idiots like Travis. The
Past is gone, The Present is bad, and even The Future seems bleak, and
the feeling of pessimism can't be washed away even by ironic happy end.</P>
<P>Travis and his world found themselves in a desperate situation, and
Martin Scorsese uses the best of his cinematic skills in order to spill
the gloom of Schrader's screenplay into the silver screen. New York City
in the night is portrayed as a Hell on Earth, and the red light and
steam coming out of sewers give it surreal, almost Stygian atmosphere.
Another important element of the atmosphere is score of great Bernard
Herrman, whose efficient use of jazz elements gives some melancholy that
softens the brutality of motion picture.</P>
<P>One of the greatest ironies of TAXI DRIVER is the fact that the movie
was, same as his protagonist, famous for the wrong reason. Instead of
receiving cult status because of his artistic merits, for many years it
was tabloid-fodder because of Hinckley and his real-life re-enactment of
events in the movie. Now, more than two decades later, when some other
"life imitating art" incidents get more attention, we can finally enjoy
TAXI DRIVER in all its artistic glory.</P>
