<PRE>Groucho Marx in a Concentration Camp
Life Is Beautiful</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Heck, I finally went to see this one. And now that I have, I recommend you
do.</P>
<P>Guido is a happy go lucky Jewish-Italian gentleman with the lovable ability
to make any event, no matter how big or small, work in his favor and lift
the spirits of all "good-hearted" passers-by to boot. Unfortunately, Guido
is living in Italy at a tragic time in world history. His sparkling ability
is put to the darkest of tests when he and his family are shipped off to
Nazi concentration camps in Germany.</P>
<P>This script is so smooth. There's nothing extraneous. It's perfectly focused
and the timing of events (especially in the first half) is smashing. Benigni
brilliantly spectacles the glorious to nauseating extremes the gift of life
affords us ... while encouraging our participation in the former.</P>
<P>Writer/Director/Actor: Roberto Benigni
Produced by Elda Ferri, Gianluigi Braschi and distributed by Miramax.
Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>Grade..........................A</P>
