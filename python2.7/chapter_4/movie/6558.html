<P>Tom Cruise recently won the Best Actor prize bestowed by The National
Society of Film Critics for his frenzied and poignant portrayl of a
sports agent who develops a conscience in a very unethical business
where the almighty dollar is sometimes put above the health and well
being of professional athletes and where kids are turned away from
receiving autographs from their sports icons because the icons are
under contract to only sign specified merchandise.  After distributing
a manual venting his frustration with the business he is dropped like a
hot potato by his boss at the agency where he works and manages to
retain only one client who's a second string wide receiver with hopes
of a big NFL contract.  The wide receiver is played in a supporting
role by Cuba Gooding Jr. who along with lead actor Cruise should be
Oscar bound for his selfish portrayal of a man with an enormous chip on
his shoulder and whose attitude is keeping him from fitting in with the
big leagues.  After losing his job Cruise is dumped by his girlfriend
and soon to be wife from hell (Kelly Preston) and becomes involved with
a young widow (Renee Zellweger) who has an adorable six year old son.
Director Cameron Crowe ('Say Anything') has crafted a special film with
touching aspects suited for both men and women.  The balance found in
the sports and the relationship aspects of the film make this a great
date movie and in particular a great first date movie.  Tom Cruise
gives his most uplifting performance to date and no one can argue about
Cruise's diversity and talent as an actor after seeing this movie.
>From his roles in 'The Color of Money' (1986) to 'Rain Man' (1988) to
'A Few Good Men' (1992) where fellow actors Paul Newman, Dustin Hoffman
and Jack Nicholson have all praised Cruise for his ability.  Jerry
Maguire paints a very real picture of present day sports where
integrity and ethics do have a place and where hard work and
determination can make a difference.  It's all in the desperation and
Cruise convinces us of that.</P>
