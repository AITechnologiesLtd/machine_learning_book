                          WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN              
                        A Film Review by Jon A. Webb 
                         Copyright 1994 Jon A. Webb </PRE>
<P>     "When a Man Loves a Woman" has serious flaws, but since it is 
topical, well-written, and has a popular, appealing lead actress, it 
will probably be successful.</P>
<P>     Meg Ryan plays an alcoholic mother who hits bottom, and enters a 
recovery program. Andy Garcia is the somewhat distant husband. When 
Ryan stops drinking, the reason why she was drinking becomes apparent, 
and Garcia finds he must change.</P>
<P>     The writing in the film is first-rate, and the direction is not 
bad either.</P>
<P>     It is interesting to note that Al Franken, the Saturday Night 
live creator of Stuart Smalley, the twelve-step program addict, was a 
co-writer. Clearly he has a lot of respect for the programs that he 
satirizes. They are seen as a god-send here.</P>
<P>     My main problem with this film is in the acting of Meg Ryan and 
Andy Garcia. Ryan does not give a convincing portrayal of an 
alcoholic. She seems fun and high on alcohol, and certainly 
overwhelmed by it, but she never shows any of the kind of emotional 
range needed to convey the experience of this woman.  She drinks a lot 
for some reason; Ryan is given lines to speak that are supposed to 
explain why to us; but nothing in her behavior connects us to her 
experience. She also never shows any of the physical changes 
alcoholics commonly experience -- weight gain, complexion changes, 
bloating, etc.</P>
<P>     Ryan's acting is deficient, but Garcia's seems almost totally 
absent.  He speaks every line in the same tone, as he has in other 
films.  He's about as well cast here as he possibly could be, since 
he's supposed to be emotionally distant and controlling.  But the 
movie would have been much better if an actor with more depth -- say, 
Nick Nolte -- had gotten the role.</P>
<P>     If you know someone who is an alcoholic or read the literature 
you will recognize many experiences in this film. The refusal to hear 
a call for help when asking for an explanation, the blaming of others 
for one's own deficiencies, the grown-up behavior from children, all 
are very well written and directed.  If only the actors had been up to 
conveying some of the experience rather than simply providing pretty 
faces for the advertising, this could have been a great film, rather 
than merely a mildly entertaining experience.</P>
<P>     One more odd thing: I was never able to understand why the theme 
from "Cats" plays such an important role here.  If you have an 
explanation, please let me know.</P>
