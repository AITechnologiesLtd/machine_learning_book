<P>Last October's "Pleasantville" found the innocent 1950s going up against
the liberal '90s and getting creamed, with teens from modern times
reforming the pristine and pure "Father Knows Best"-esque universe they
found themselves trapped in. The new comedy "Blast From the Past," then,
covers similar terrain in reverse, featuring a hero whose life-long
experience with early-'60s society and mores throws him into mass
culture shock when he's suddenly thrust into a contemporary setting. The
story, once set up, sounds incredibly goofy, but "Blast From the Past"
is somehow a blast for the present that fondly recalls the bygone era
with cozy warmth and comfortable affection.</P>
<P>In shying away from "Pleasantville"'s progressive preachiness - it's one
big flaw - "Past" has frothy charm to spare, and a lot of it comes from
the impeccable actors. That Brendan Fraser and Alicia Silverstone are
given the movie's romantic leads virtually promises a strong turnout of
loyal young fans, but the big surprise is how good they are - both apart
and together. He, too often cast as cartoonish lunkheads, radiates
nice-guy appeal in a performance guaranteed to induce smiles and grins;
she, who followed her stellar "Clueless" debut with less-than-stellar
turns in tripe like "Hideaway" and "Excess Baggage," gets terrific
mileage out of a smallish role.</P>
<P>Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek show up as Fraser's good-natured but
jaded parents, and their too-fun work here is the movie's equivalent of
a bonus prize. Writer Bill Kelly and co-scribe/director Hugh Wilson
("The First Wives Club") play all their best ideas first, resulting in a
terrific first hour that then begins to drag as it nears its conclusion;
after an inspired sequence set in a swing club, some frustrating
plotting takes place (that interlude with social services - huh?). But
the cast is the real blast in "Past," and they're alive and shining even
when the film isn't.<HR></P>

"Now you'd think that Karla the roommate would figure out that since
Julia has been living for two years with terrifying nightmares, and
since most of her friends and neighbors have been filleted by the
Fisherman, it would be unwise to sneak into her room in the dark, make
suspicious noises and hide in the closet. Roommates do not think like
this in slasher movies." -Roger Ebert on "I Still Know What You Did Last
Summer"</P>
