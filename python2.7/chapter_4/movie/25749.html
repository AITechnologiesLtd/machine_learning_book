<PRE>THE TAO OF STEVE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>"You've got so many great books," remarks Julie (Dana Goodman), a woman 
Dex (Donal Logue) has just met.  "All the better to seduce you with," 
replies the rotund but irresistible Dex.  "What?" asks Julie.  "All the 
better to deduce the truth with," he claims.</P>
<P>In the easiest film to enjoy this summer, Jenniphr Goodman's 
good-spirited THE TAO OF STEVE tells the story of a lovable philosopher 
who attracts women like honey even if he's way too big for his own good.  
The versatile Donal Logue (THE PATRIOT), who seems to show up in a 
supporting role in most movies lately, gets a rare starring role this 
time and makes the most of it.  Oozing charm from every pore, the sweet 
Dex is a chatterbox philosopher with a purpose -- picking up chicks.  </P>
<P>Dex quotes many philosophers, but his allegiance is to the Tao of Steve.  
("Steve isn't just a name, it's a state of mind. It's a way of living," 
we're told.)  You know, the famous Steves of history, including Steve 
McGarrett ("Hawaii Five-O"), Steve Austin ("The Six Million Dollar Man") 
and, most of all, Steve McQueen.  Being a Steve myself, I, of course, 
know these things, but I'll explain them to you in case you don't.  The 
fundamental principle in this philosophy is, "We pursue that which 
retreats from us."  This means, Dex explains to his friend Dave (Kimo 
Wills), that the way to get laid is to put it furthest from your mind 
when on a date.</P>
<P>The problem is that the first woman Dex really falls hard for, Syd, 
appears completely immune to his techniques.  Syd, one of the most 
genuine characters you're likely to see in the cinema, is played by 
Greer Goodman with the organic good looks of someone you might meet at a 
health food store.  She has a philosophy too -- "Just say no to nudity." 
-- that meshes exactly with Dex's, who is embarrassed by his body's 
superfluous 100 pounds, which he jokes is more like 200 extra.</P>
<P>Generally, however, Dex and Syd's chemistry together is great, albeit 
generally negative.  When Syd finds out that he's been seeing another 
woman while unsuccessfully pursuing her, she is upset.  "Am I supposed 
to remain celibate while I bask in the warm glow of your annihilating 
contempt?" he asks tartly.  The bright script by Greer Goodman, Jenniphr 
Goodman and Duncan North literally bursts with such gems.     </P>
<P>Dex has a glib response for every question, which drives Syd crazy.  
"What do you look for in a woman," Syd asks Dex seriously.  "Low 
standards," he snaps back.</P>
<P>Syd, who way back in their college days knew Dex in the biblical sense, 
can't understand why the smartest kid in class ended up so poorly.  With 
no ambition, little money, and a part-time job as a fun-loving 
kindergarten teacher, he is completely at peace with his complete lack 
of what goes for success.  "Doing stuff is overrated," Dex tells Syd, 
and then goes on to point out how much better the world would be if 
Hitler had been more laid-back.</P>
<P>To be fair, Dex has thoughts on more subjects than sexual pursuits.  He 
complains, for example, that people only talk to God when they want 
something.  Why, he asks Syd, don't people ask him, "Hey, God.  How was 
your day?"</P>
<P>The formulaic plot ends up exactly in the satisfying way that you would 
expect, but you'd be disappointed if it didn't.  One of the funniest 
parts of the movie may be missed by moviegoers who have never gone back 
to one of their school's reunions.  At Dex's class's 10th, which opens 
the movie, he is the only one who has gained weight.  The rest of the 
group are so trim that they could all be aerobics instructors.  Real 
reunions are celebrations of fat over fitness.  Anyone who hasn't gained 
weight stands out like a sore thumb.  Trust me.  I know.  I came back a 
100 pounds lighter.  My ex-schoolmates looked at me like they figured 
that I had contracted an emaciating and soon-to-be-fatal disease.</P>
<P>THE TAO OF STEVE runs a fast 1:28.  It is rated R for language and some 
drug use and would be acceptable for most teenagers.</P>
