<PRE>                               THE ROCKETEER
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     What better childhood fantasy than flying with a rocket strapped
to your back?  In 1991, Disney developed that idea into a movie called
THE ROCKETEER.</P>
<P>     The highly atmospheric script by Danny Bilson, Paul De Meo,
William Dear, and Dave Stevens is set in a glitzy Hollywood just before
the outbreak of World War II.  A happy-go-lucky time, full of lavish
nightclubs and barnstorming aviators.</P>
<P>     The gist of the story is that Howard Hughes (Terry O'Quinn) has
invented a personal rocket backpack, but a Mafia group led by Eddie
Valentine (Paul Sorvino) is trying to steal it.  They make off with the
rocket, during the getaway it is switched with an Electro-Lux vacuum
cleaner by mistake.</P>
<P>     The real rocket pack comes into the possession of ace pilot Cliff
Secord (Bill Campbell) and his older mentor Peevy (Alan Arkin).  Once
he flies with it, Cliff becomes known as "The Rocketeer."</P>
<P>     Cliff is head over heels in love with Jenny Blake (Jennifer
Connelly), who is an extra in a movie with famous actor Neville
Sinclair (Timothy Dalton).  Neville turns out to be a Nazi spy who has
been bankrolling Valentine and his boys to steal the rocket pack for
the fatherland.  Hitler has plans to use rocket packs to send a swarm
of soldiers to attack the United States.</P>
<P>     Marilyn Vance-Straker's costumes for Cliff are a delightful
reinterpretation of those worn by Buck Rogers.  The sets by James D.
Bissell capture a glamour that probably never existed except in our
minds.  James Horner's music stays energetic and sugary sweet.  One
gets the sense that all of the cast and crew viewed the film as a romp.</P>
<P>     In good BUCK ROGERS fashion, which is the series the show most
closely resembles, logic goes out the window.  Anyone wearing the
rocket would have a barbecued rear and legs.  The illogical aspects are
not germane since the story stays totally in Fantasyland.</P>
<P>     The problem with the film is that it is nothing more than an
exercise in whimsical style.  Nothing in the narrative is compelling.
In place of a story we have antics.</P>
<P>     Typical of the slapstick is the scene in which Cliff straps on the
jets for the first-time in order to rescue a clown who is attempting to
fly an airplane.  Cliff goes through all of the canonical gags
including shooting out-of-control through a clothesline of freshly
washed clothes.  Of course, a sheet gets stuck on his face almost
causing him to crash.  In another scene, there is a race through a
crowded restaurant kitchen, and the mayhem causes the obligatory flying
food.  One gets tired of recycled comedy.  Still the scenes of soaring
with the rocket are great fun, and they are fresh.  Well, fresh if you
are too old to remember early science fiction movies.</P>
<P>     The biggest failing of the film is the casting of the lead.  It is
easy to see why Bill Campbell has never been given an important movie
role before or since.  Campbell has no personality so his acting
detracts from instead of enhancing Cliff's persona.  Arkin, Dalton, and
Connelly give nice performances, but all have done much better work.</P>
<P>     Director Joe Johnson seems happy to let the actors in the film
drift just so long as the atmosphere stays completely nostalgic.
Exercises in style like this are rarely enough for adults, although
they can be enough to satisfy younger viewers.  But not too young since
Tommy guns blast everywhere, and scores of people die in the film.  A
particularly frightening scene has a guy with his face forced against a
hot range.  Nevertheless, the picture keeps its violence mainly at the
cartoon level.  And the acting too.</P>
<P>     THE ROCKETEER runs 1:48.  It is rated PG although given the level
of violence, PG-13 might have been more appropriate.  The film should
be fine for most kids say 7 or 8 and up, but be careful if they are
sensitive to violence.  My son Jeffrey, age 8, thought the movie was
"good."  His favorite part was The Rocketeer whom he would probably
love to be.  There is not enough for me to be able to recommend the
movie.  I give it **.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
