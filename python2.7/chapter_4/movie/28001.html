Susan Granger's review of "ENEMY AT THE GATES" (Paramount Pictures)</PRE>
<P>     Beware of any W.W.II movie in which you find yourself
rooting for the murderous Nazi! Because of unfortunate casting
choices, that's what happens in this otherwise impressive epic set
during the bloody battle of Stalingrad in '42 and '43, the pivotal
confrontation between Hitler's invading troops and the overpowered,
under-equipped Russian Army. When an overwrought Nikita Krushchev (Bob
Hoskins) demands a victory for Stalin, an enterprising propagandist
(Joseph Fiennes) turns a young shepherd boy-turned-sniper, Vassily
Zaitsev (Jude Law), into a national hero, thus changing an atmosphere
of hopelessness into optimism. Vassily has a brief romance with a
plucky comrade (Rachel Weisz) before an expert German marksman, Major
Koenig (Ed Harris), is sent to eliminate him. Pitting the country lad
from the Urals against the aristocratic nobleman is, of course, the
essence of class struggle. Staging the battle sequences, director
Jean-Jacques Annaud and co-writer Alain Godard lift liberally from the
combat-intensity of Steven Spielberg's Normandy landing in "Saving
Private Ryan," but their less-than-compelling story is further
weakened by mediocre acting. Jude Law is handsome but vacuous, while
Joseph Fiennes flounders in caricature. Only Ed Harris with his steely
blue eyes and soft speech, smoking gold-tipped cigarettes, delivers a
riveting performance. He's a cruel villain but, with the protagonists
so uninteresting, his dogged persistence ignites the screen. In
addition, the distracting accents of the polyglot cast are ludicrous
and James Horner's blatant musical score is downright intrusive. So,
on the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Enemy at the Gates" is a
flawed 5. And, if you want to know more about this historic battle, I
suggest renting "Stalingrad."</P>
