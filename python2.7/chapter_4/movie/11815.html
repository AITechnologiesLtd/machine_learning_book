<PRE>                        THE BUTCHER BOY</PRE>
<P>Born and raised with two strikes against him, Francie Brady (Eamonn
Owens), with a drunk for a father, Benny (Stephen Rea), and a
mother, (Aisling O'Sullivan) slowly going mad because of that and
their abject poverty, the one thing Francie needs but is denied him
is understanding and love. The consequences of being shunned are
horrendous.</P>
<P> Based on the novel by Patrick McCabe and beautifully directed by Neil
 Jordan whom we all remember from The Crying Game, the film is taut,
 tense with our knowledge that there can be no happy ending for young
 Francie.</P>
<P> Francie's only friend is Joe (Alan Boyle) who together enjoy a world of
 comic books and imaginative play.   Later, even Joe opts for friends who
 are more stable, leaving Francie further alone and devastated.  One of his
 biggest enemies is the gossip, Mrs.  Nugent (Fiona Shaw) who takes a
 great dislike to Francie, blaming him for all the troubles he experiences.</P>
<P> When Francie returns from reform school, he finds employment in a
 slaughterhouse, (hence, the film's title) hardly the right place
for a pre-teen, especially one with Francie's problems and
disposition.   Perhaps the last place where he should be working  is
where animals are hacked up and blood is all over the place.</P>
<P> Both his parents die.  Despite his having had nothing to do with
either, having received nothing from them, he is further alienated.
He latches onto an imaginary Virgin Mary icon (Sinead O'Connor) who
"talks" with him.   However, eventually all of these hardship descend
upon the child and he explodes in a rage of violence.</P>
<P> Despite the seriousness of the subject, there are, surprisingly,
moments of laughter.  As Shakespeare well knew, you don't  keep
everyone on edge without relieving the tension every now and then.</P>
<P> I have one caveat: the movie should have subtitles.   I've said it
before of other films made in Great Britain.  In particular, this
film is laid in a small out of the way village and the accents are
rough on the ears.  Despite being able  easily to follow the story
without understanding every spoken word, I felt I was missing
something by not hearing everything uttered.  When are those in
charge going to realize that some English-speaking films do require
subtitles?</P>
