<P>Plot: The town of Bolan is being terrorized by a killer. Teenage slacker and 
dopehead Anton Tobias makes the discovery, after finding his parents bodies, 
that he is the killer and that his right hand is possessed by a demonic 
spirit that always takes over the laziest person it can find. His murderous 
hand kills his two best friends who return as zombies. But the three of them 
find that not even severing his hand manages to stop it.</P>
<P>In the last couple of years, the teen horror film has made a major revival. 
It was all begun with 1996's ‘Scream' which nostalgiacally looked back to 
slasher films of the mid-1980s while wittily parodying the conventions of 
the genre. Its success was followed by the likes of the ‘I Know What You Did 
Last Summer' films, ‘Urban Legend' (1998), ‘Disturbing Behavior' (1998) and 
‘The Faculty' (1998), as well as the cult success of tv's ‘Buffy the Vampire 
Slayer' (1997- ). If ‘Halloween', ‘Friday the 13th' and their copious 
imitators were horror films of the early 1980s Me Generation leftovers, then 
these are Generation X horror films. Here the anonymous teens that filled 
the mid-1980s equivalents have been replaced by a more savvy, cynical teens 
who come wittily post-informed by the conventions of the genre and who will 
compare and paraphrase their situation with in-referents to other horror 
films at the drop of a hat. At their best - the likes of ‘Scream and ‘The 
Faculty' - these films are witty and intelligent genre deconstructions; at 
their least, the likes of ‘I Still Know What You Did Last Summer' and ‘Urban 
Legend', these are sad copies of films that lack the werewithal to see they 
are jumping on a bandwagon that roots itself in media self-awareness and end 
up in a case of the Emperor's New Clothes, of merely being slasher film 
imitators made on an A-budget.</P>
<P>If the ‘Scream' films et al are Generation X horror films, then ‘Idle Hands' 
is surely the first slacker horror film -one of its continuing comic riff 
concerns itself with the three principal teens' dope-smoking habits. But 
sadly there isn't a great deal to the film more than half a concept. (And 
most of its ideas are stolen from other films - the possessed and severed 
hand idea seems a feature-length expansion of the comic sequence that was 
done with far greater sophistry in ‘The Evil Dead II', the two undead 
friends are a blatant steal from ‘An American Werewolf in London'). The 
overall idea of a possessed hand is fairly lame - and in terms of horror the 
hand holds so little threat as to border on the laughable. And nothing on 
screen has any inspiration that transforms the film anywhat either - the 
scenes with Sawa contorting about as he fights his hand come out as 
singularly unfunny. A good comic performer and mime artist could have made 
this work but Sawa's performance abilities are thoroughly unexceptional. 
There's one mildly amusing sequence where Sawa's hand makes aggressive moves 
on Jessica Alba leaving him torn between its aggression and his natural 
introversion but which she decides she rather likes, even taking him tying 
his hand up to the bed as something kinky. The whole film gives the 
impression of wanting to open up into something much more raucous and 
vulgar, but director Flender does the criminal thing for this type of film - 
he is too tame, his vulgarity lacks imagination. At least it's a better film 
than Flender's debut feature ‘Leprechaun 2' (1994).</P>
