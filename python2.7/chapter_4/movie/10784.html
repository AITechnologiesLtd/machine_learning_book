<PRE>                   Our rating: one lava lamp (out of five).</PRE>
<P>Awful femme fatale movies had something of a mini-renaissance in the early
90's, including such noxious titles as Basic Instinct, The Crush, The
Babysitter, Poison Ivy... oh, the list goes on and on. They all feature,
in one form or another, a conniving woman who is initially attractive on
many fronts but eventually reveals her true colors and is nearly
responsible for the downfall of all who put their trust in her. We wish we
could say that The Temp is the worst example of this sub-genre, but the
truth is, most of them are easily as painful as this movie. However, don't
let that deceive you: The Temp is very, very bad indeed.</P>
<P>Peter Derns (Timothy Hutton) works as a marketing executive for the Mrs.
Appleby cookie company. The environment is highly competitive, especially
since Appleby was recently acquired by another company, constantly
referred to as "the boys in New York." When Peter's regular assistant
takes leave to be with his wife during childbirth, Kris Bolin (Twin Peaks
alum Lara Flynn Boyle) arrives to save the day. Not only does she finish
the all-important report due by noon, but she also reorganizes Peter's
entire life in the space of a week.</P>
<P>Kris decides she likes working for Peter so much that when the regular
assistant returns to work, she arranges an "accident" involving a paper
shredder. Personally, we're the types to check the power eight times
before sticking our hands into something with that much destructive
potential, but there it is. A whirring sound, a spray of blood, an
agonized cry, and Kris is sitting pretty in Peter's office again. She even
sends the poor cad a sympathy card.</P>
<P>Unfortunately for Peter, Kris doesn't stop there. She has found that she
likes being upwardly mobile, and so the company undergoes a colossal
series of accidents and firings as Kris works her way to the top, trying
to seduce Peter along the way. Peter, who is just exiting therapy for
acute paranoia, doesn't know whether he imagines that Kris is engineering
these events, or if she's really responsible. What he does know is that
she's not making it any easier for him to reach a reconciliation with his
estranged wife.</P>
<P>>From here, The Temp spirals downward into absurdity. Not only are we led
to believe that Kris can get away with murder (repeatedly), but she can
also engineer a batch of cookies that cause test market volunteers to
cough up blood, hack the company e-mail system, and perform a number of
other highly unlikely activities. We began to think that Kris might
actually be innocent, because her tally of crimes became too massive to
believe.</P>
<P>The script is not completely to blame for The Temp's hemorrhage-inducing
awfulness; the cast does its part to lower the film's quality even
further. Boyle should have gotten some sort of shame award for her
overacting as Bolin. Faye Dunaway (as Derns' boss, Charlene) did get a
shame award for hers -- the Golden Raspberry for Worst Supporting Actress
that year. Hutton chose to go the other route, becoming the most
relentlessly boring screen personality we've seen since Jeff Muldovan in
Trancers 4. Rounding out this roll call of shame is Dwight Schultz, who
should really stick to those oddball characters on TV. His dull executive
role in this movie made us pine for the wacky adventures of "Howling Mad"
Murdoch on The A-Team.</P>
<P>When we see films like this, we often wonder what could have inspired a
movie studio to make a film this wretched. Was the script re-written on
the set? Were all the people involved suffering some mass hallucination
that they were making a good movie? Perhaps the flick itself offers a
clue: maybe somewhere, in an office in Hollywood, a vengeful temp is
secretly greenlighting projects just like this one. Now that's scary.</P>
