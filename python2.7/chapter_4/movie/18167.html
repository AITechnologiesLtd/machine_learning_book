<P>This is a play more for Shakespeare aficionados than it is for film go-ers
specially anyone who is into entertainment and escape.</P>
<P>But this play, were it not for its famous 'mother', is an excellent exercise
in having a little fun, and see two goons get gooned around until they
themselves get done away with it.   The two actors, much like the
requirement for the stage production, are extremelly good and very tight,
meaning that  there is a smoothness of interplay which is very enjoyable
throughout the  whole production.</P>
<P>And unlike the original play, this story is not locked into a theatre stage
and has much more freedom to move around and show another side of the
characters and players than we otherwise could really get.  While travelling
to Denmark we see the rough terrain, and the forests which help the two
characters play word games to while away the travelling time.  All of a
sudden, the play is not a fun, wordy, game for two actors, but an
entertaining exercise in filling in the boring spaces in one's life.</P>
<P>The story concerns the two characters which Claudius hires to go kill Hamlet
in Denmark, during the latter's exile.  Shakespeare makes these two
characters look like a pair of little kids, playing a deadly game in an
adult world, which I tend to think that Tom Stoppard wanted to change.  In
this film, they are not so much two kids as they are a pair of pawns caught
up in a much larger chess game than they could imagine, and they do not
realize that they are getting involved in a game which is not specially
friendly or fun.</P>
<P>I have been involved in one production of this play, and like it a lot, not
only because of its avant-garde style, but also because it always invokes
settings for a stage which are very colorful and 'symbolic' if not totally
based on a 'visual' image.  The play works very well within the confines of
the absurdist theatre, with a stage that could be almost all too empty.  And
the film answers all the questions and problems which it might have on the
stage.</P>
<P>This film is worth seeing.....but a requirement is necessary that you allow
for time to let events shape up.....thus the story will become a bit clearer
to you.  Excellent acting and very good, sometimes funny, directing.</P>
<PRE>Richard Dreifuss is very good.</PRE>
