<PRE>'13th Floor' doesn't live up to its ambitions
by Wallace Baine

<P>Techies and software geeks need not get too jacked up over the glossy new
cyber-thriller `The Thirteenth Floor.' Sure, a really cool supercomputer is
at the center of things, but for all its nifty lighting effects, it might
as well be a Sharper Image version of an H.G. Wells-inspired way-back
machine.
Those waiting for a sophisticated fable about the computerized tomorrow
won't get too much sustenance from what is primarily nothing more than a
servicable noir borrowing plot points from virtual reality. This stylish
potboiler brings up fascinating questions, but leaves them on the table.
Not nearly as jarring an experience as `The Matrix,' to which it is
destined to be compared, `The Thirteenth Floor' -- like `The Matrix' --
plays with the notion of computer-invented planes of reality. But what
makes the thing go is a time-honored cinematic formula: dark interiors, a
mysteriously sad-eyed girl, a suspicious cop, a perplexed and paranoid hero
and an unsolved murder. Film Noir 101.
For such a high-profile pre-summer release (it comes from the same creative
team that afflicted us with `Godzilla'), `13th Floor' is pleasingly
star-less. The able cast is headed up by Craig Bierko (`The Long Kiss
Goodnight'), a kind of poor woman's Vince Vaughn, who stars as Douglas
Hall, a software hot-shot working closely with his mentor, the aged
computer science pioneer Hannon Fuller (Armin Mueller-Stahl). The two men
are on the verge of realizing a life-long ambition: the creation of a
virtual reality machine that re-creates a simulated world so real, the
computer-generated `people' have separate minds and free will.
The simulated world is Los Angeles, 1937, the period of Fuller's youth.
While the younger Hall is out of town, Fuller dives into his
virtual-reality machine before the kinks are ironed out to throw his money
around in nightclubs and bed down Depression-era show girls (talk about
your killer apps!).
One night, after one of these virtual joyrides, Fuller is murdered in a
dark alley and Hall, waking up not able to remember the night before, finds
a bloody shirt in his apartment. An intimidating cop (Dennis Haysbert)
fingers Hall as the prime suspect and Hall, not able to provide an alibi,
dives into virtual 1937 in search of clues on who could have murdered
Fuller, against the wishes of his techie assistant Whitney (Vincent
D'Onofrio, looking like a young John Malkovich).
Enter Jane (Gretchen Mol of `Rounders'), Fuller's mysterious but beautiful
daughter (whom Hall, Fuller's closest confidant, had never heard of).
Shooting off major seduction sparks in Hall's direction, Jane moves with
agility to claim Daddy's company.
If that weren't enough, Hall runs across more mysterious characters in 1937
(filmed in nicely burnished browns and golds). A suspicious bartender, a
virtual twin of his co-worker Whitney, holds the key to what happened to
Fuller. But the bartender, oozing malevolence, misleads a baffled Hall and
sets out on his sluething adventure. The bartender -- who is, remember,
just a computer-generated `unit' -- finds out the truth of his existence
and leads Hall to the humbling realization that he might not be `real'
either. Follow me so far?
Loosely adapted from Daniel F. Galouye's novel `Simalacron-3,' `13th Floor'
works on the proposition, as does `The Matrix,' that one's consciousness
can be downloaded into a living, breathing replica of one's self in a
artificially constructed world. It doesn't measure up to `The Matrix,'
however, in explaining the dangers and consequences of such reality
tampering, instead diluting its sci-fi ambitions with whodunit cliches. 
The film's reach exceeds its grasp when it settles into murky, existential
philosophizing on the nature of reality. The most advanced thinking in
computer science does indeed touch on the profound questions of
consciousness and perception. While `13th Floor' admirably ventures out
onto the shaky limb of such paradoxes, it does so in a facile manner,
postulating on what possibly isn't real but never really addressing is
real.
The film's most clever representation is, in fact, its view of 1937 LA,
balanced with just enough glitzy back-lot Hollywood touches to slyly
suggest that if we are able to create simulated worlds of the past, they
will be modeled more on romantic, movie-fed images of the past rather than
strictly historical models. Also, with the sober-minded professor Fuller
behaving in his made-up 1937 like Bill Clinton at a sorority mixer, the
film tantalizingly opens the question of whether morality and personal
conduct have any meaning in computer-generated worlds of pure fantasy.
These intriguing themes bow, however, to the demands of a rather rote
murder mystery, creating a faint but lingering air of disappointment -- an
emotion still unique to us carbon-based CPUs.</P>
