<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>Two years ago, the original "Urban Legend" was a surprise, proving to be
the most worthy of the litany of "Scream" rip-offs. Although by no means
classic cinema, it was entertaining and boasted an entertaining premise,
taking typical slasher-film shenanigans and dressing them up in the
context of popular urban legends. Aided by good performances and energetic
direction, "Urban Legend" turned out to be ideal popcorn fare.</P>
<P>Now comes the sequel of sorts, "Urban Legends: Final Cut". Instead of
being a continuation of the first movie, this one is intended to be more
of a thematic successor. Its events are inspired by the original, and only
two characters carry over. Most notable is security guard Reese (Loretta
Devine), now working at a university whose film students compete for the
prestigious and lucrative Hitchcock Prize. One night, Reese encounters Amy
Mayfield (Jennifer Morrison), who is casting about for a topic for her
thesis film. Reese tells her about the events she endured at Pendleton
in the original picture ("but that's just an urban legend," Amy protests
in one of the more clever lines of dialogue) and this inspires Amy to make
her own movie about a campus killer who bases his murders on urban 
myths. But as production gets under way, somebody seizes on the Pendleton
"legend" in a far more literal manner, and begins killing film students in
the same style.</P>
<P>Or, at least, that's what's supposed to be happening. But "Urban Legends"
is so ineptly written by Paul Harris Boardman and Scott Derrickson that
the central motif is virtually forgotten about, or treated more as a
crutch. Although Boardman and Derrickson go through the motions of
dressing their murders up in "urban legend" style, this is largely just
used as an irrelevant backdrop while the killings are carried out in
typical slasher style. There is a startling dearth of imagination here:
even the deaths, usually the high points of any movie of this genre, lack
invention.</P>
<P>There is a similar lethargy to many of the other plot points. Characters
are introduced who are so obviously intended to be potential suspects -- a
rival movie director, a mysterious twin brother, an eccentric movie
groupie -- that they deserve little flags. Having introduced such
characters, Boardman and Derrickson make little effort to heighten the
suspense by developing them further; they are pretty much just thrown
out there, and it is expected that the viewer will generate his own 
mystery trying to figure out which one actually did it. "Urban Legends",
though, is so thoroughly unengaging that there is no cause to contemplate
such things; there are far greater mysteries, like why a studio would
greenlight such a paltry, third-rate script.</P>
<P>"Urban Legends" has the feel almost of a serialised drama, with each
incident happening seemingly in isolation. Characters appear just so that
they can serve as the next victim. People die and are not mentioned again
for huge stretches of time. The movie evokes the sense of filmmakers going
through the motions -- murders and other scary incidents occur not because
the plot demands it, but just to fill time. This is moviemaking at its
most mechanical.</P>
<P>There is little in the way of characterisation to speak of, and few of
the castmembers engender any interest or sympathy. The revelation that
one character has a twin, for example, is completely defused by the fact
that we knew nothing about the character in the first place. Morrison
proves a poor successor to "Urban Legend's" spunky Alicia Witt -- not
because she doesn't try, but simply because she is given no material to
work with. Amy is a dull, monotonous character, and the filmmakers seem to
assume that we will empathise with her simply because she's the main
character, not because they have established her as somebody worthy of our
interest.</P>
<P>Amongst the other characters, Devine is downright embarrassing as Reese,
having apparently graduated from the "Police Academy" stable. Matthew
Davis, who plays twins Travis and Trevor, is aimless in either role.
Perhaps the biggest name actor, Joseph Lawrence (best known as the guy who
says 'woah!' on "Blossom"), is confined to a forgettable one-note part.</P>
<P>John Ottman's direction is unremarkable and drops the ball more than once
during action scenes, where the sequence of events is frequently confusing
and difficult to discern. Certainly, Ottman does little to cultivate an
atmosphere of suspense or terror. But then, there is precious little
mystery anywhere in "Urban Legends" -- a particularly galling fact given
that the film invokes such names as Hitchcock and Welles. It all comes to
a head with the revelation of the killer, which is done so off-handedly
and absurdly that I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop (it never
does).</P>
<P>Indeed, it was moments like this that made me wonder if "Urban Legends"
was perhaps intended to be more a satire of slasher films than just a
standard entry into the genre. But if that is the case, then it is a most
incompetent effort, totally failing to illuminate any truths about slasher
movies (except, perhaps, that they're all but exhausted) and instead
wallowing in their most dubious cliches.</P>
<P>"Urban Legends: Final Cut" is, quite simply, badly made. The direction is
hamfisted. The acting is without merit. The writing is on about the same
level as that roomful of typewriter-endowed chimpanzees. It is amusing
that the movie is set at a film school, because you have to wonder how
much time its creators actually spent at one.</P>
<P>The only positive thing that can be said about "Urban Legends" is that,
in the end, it could have been a lot worse. It is never actively
terrible; it is just incredibly lazy, inducing more a sense of ennui than
of critical revulsion. Nonetheless, it is yet another example of how the
teen slasher genre is in desperate need of either fresh ideas or a long
rest. Hopefully, this is indeed the 'final cut' for the "Urban Legend"
mini-franchise.</P>
