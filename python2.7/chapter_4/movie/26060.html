<P>   The Spanish artist Francisco de Goya once said that
without imagination, we are no better than the animals.  He
put his brushes where his mouth is: his lithographs and
canvases are so fanciful and innovative that he has been
called by some the first modern painter.  Few directors could
have done a better job in creating an imaginative biopic about
the great man than Carlos Saura, who has regularly shunned
the boredom of realism in his thirty films--which have included
such dramatic works as the violent "Bodas de sangre," and
the musically rich "El amor brujo," "Flamenco" and "Tango."</P>
<P>   The film opens on a plump, rapidly aging Goya at age 82
where, racked by blinding headaches and afflicted with
deafness from a disease he contracted while in his forties, he
hallucinates about his life.  Shifting from the painter's present
in the year 1828, Saura's photographer Vittorio Storaro takes
us on a journey that shows Goya as a middle aged man,
shifting regularly from the artist's portrayal as a younger man
by Jose Coronado to a rendition marked by a strong
performance from Francisco Rabal.  As Storaro emulates the
artist's own palette of colors, transforming the film into what
could be best be called paintings in motion, Goya is morphed
from the exterior of a butchered piece of meat that is strung
up on a wall into the ghostly face of a man who is shortly to
face death.  Transfixed on the favorite of his many loves, the
vibrant, whimsical and arrogant Duchess of Alba whom he
calls by her first name Cayetana (Maribel Verdu), Goya
follows this apparition while still in his nightshirt,
somnambulistically traversing a street where he is almost
knocked down by a horse and carriage and gets into an
argument with a fellow into whose companion he has
bumped.  Dependent on his young, impressionable but
quickly maturing daughter Rosario (Dafne Fernandez), Goya
is now cohabiting with his latest and last lover, Loecadia
(Eulalia Ramon)--whose aversion to the man's luridly
sorrowful works fortunately has failed to anchor the artist's
work in an insipid reality.</P>
<P>   As Goya fantasizes furiously about his better days, the time
that he produced a wealth of striking oils and also a number
of lithographs produced on a cumbersome machine, Saura
introduces his audience--an ethereal niche, I'd imagine,
because the slow pace and dreamlike ambiance would
challenge the typical moviegoer--to a series of scenes both
impersonally cruel and pictorially lovely.  The one scene that
even some teen horror fans might sponge up is a re-
enactment of a painting that Goya once created of a mythical
story of St. Anthony of Padua in which Anthony questions a
buried corpse, which rises from his box to clear an innocent
man of his murder while putting finger on the guilty party--
who is promptly executed by the saint.  The most theatrical
scene involves a performance by a theatre group, La Fura
dels Baus, which dramatizes the painter's "Disasters of War,"
an almost mechanical procession of Napoleon's soldiers firing
on Spanish prisoners who are tied to stakes.  </P>
<P>   "Goya in Bordeaux" would probably attract the sort of
audience that enjoyed the recent Canadian entry, "The Red
Violin," but while the latter picture is rich in glorious music
and an expansive landscape of people who at different times
possessed the instrument of the title, "Goya" is theatrical,
contained, and in fact cannot hide the fact that almost the
entire work has been filmed in studios.  The lighting is
perhaps its most striking attribute.  We see faces come into
focus lit presumably by the illumination of a plethora of
candles.  The death scene is also particularly arresting, a
shadow moving slowly over the nightshirt-clad body of a man
whose mind has been leaving him.  On the whole, the
picture, like the doddering artist himself, is generally lacking
in vitality and might be better served on the stage than on the
big screen. Nonetheless, "Goya in Bordeaux" is a welcome
work that sheds light on the artist, though Saura's screenplay
often focuses too heavily on his obsession with his greatest
love, Cayetana.</P>
