<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A disappointingly routine thriller considering the two headline stars
Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe are well suited for their roles (gossip has
it they found real romance together offscreen). Also, the locations
are gorgeous (actual location shots are in Ecuador's Quito wilderness)
and the escapist story about kidnap-and-ransom has enough of a tinge
of realism to catch one's interest...but all that is still not enough
to stop the thinly plotted story from dragging in spots, bringing on a
dullness to its critical life-and-death situations, and falling into
cliché territory from the get-go, as the film failed to be anything
but trite -- a film that tried desperately to have a heart, but all it
has to show for its effort is that it looks like a typical Hollywood
action film, something tried and marketed many times before. A good
film to rest your brain cells and get carried away by the star's
screen presence. And, if you do not judge the film on a more critical
standard, I think you'll get your money's worth, that is, if you're in
the market for seeing a beautiful looking escapist film.</P>
<P>In "Proof of Life," kidnapping is played as a business deal. Peter
(Morse) and Alice Bowman (Meg) are a married couple suffering some
turbulence in their relationship due to constantly traveling to Third
World countries and that she just had a miscarriage 8 months ago in an
African country. They are stuck in the fictional Tecala, a backward
South American country, where he is an idealistic engineer building a
dam for the impoverished people under a dubious arrangement the country
has with a major oil company -- the company gets to put in an oil
pipeline and the country in return gets a dam, which the oil company
subcontracts out. Peter is the head engineer on the dam project for the
subcontractors, but carries around an oil company employment card. This
will work against him when the kidnappers get a hold of him and identify
him with the hated oil company.</P>
<P>During a police road blockade he gets snatched by the guerrillas, a
radical Marxist group called the ELT, who are now into the business of
cocaine dealing and kidnapping for ransom. They bring him to the
mountains and call him a gringo, capitalist pig, and hold him for an
outrageous ransom. Thinking that he is covered by the oil company's
insurance policy, Terry Thorne (Crowe), a former SAS commando now
working for a London based organization that does hostage negotiations
worldwide is asked to take the assignment to bring Peter back home.</P>
<P>In an unnecessary waste of good film stock, the film opens with Terry
heroically rescuing a kidnapping victim from Chechnya's guerrillas. That
flat Rambo-like chopper rescue is a rehearsal for the expected rescue
that will set the scene for the film's payoff, showing us beforehand
what Terry is capable of doing.</P>
<P>A twist in the story comes, after the divorced Terry meets Alice and
Peter's suburban-type soccer mom sister Janis (Reed), who leaves her
family in the States to help Alice in her ordeal. Terry gains their
confidence as the only one around who knows what he is doing, but he is
called off the case when his Kidnapping-and-Ransom organization learns
that the oil company has no insurance policy for Peter. Alice is forced
to be on her own and rely on corrupt local officials to handle the case,
something that Terry warned her she shouldn't do.</P>
<P>Unbelievably Terry returns to help Alice on his own and for free,
without his company's support. Evidently he has the hots for her, but
that, unfortunately, remains under wraps the whole film due to her guilt
and his reserve, except for a brief kiss, as he instead puts all his
energy into getting her husband back. It is now months since the
kidnapping and the story ambles along showing the difficulty in
negotiating and making contact with the ELT. It is shown that it is a
game they have to play with them to bring the price down to the $650,000
they could afford to pay.</P>
<P>Peter has a temper toward his captors and has a tough time adjusting
to the cruel treatment he receives, as his role is reduced to dealing
with his foot injury and trading barbs with his cruel captors. He is
only sustained by the thoughts of his wife and the comfort of a fellow
hostage, a former soldier in the French Foreign Legion and now a
missionary who pretends to be crazy (Gottfried). Meanwhile Terry has
fallen for Alice, but the story fails to make their benign
relationship interesting. Instead Terry takes a lot of time explaining
the guerrilla's mentality to her and the audience, and about the
situation they are in. It made for dull film fare, even though it
smacked of some semblance of truth.  This film just got butchered
because it was unable to be imaginative and make its exciting plot
line come alive. It just stalls and falls into a rather trite escapade
into the jungles to rescue an American engineer from revolutionaries
who are caricatured as being stupid, cruel, lazy, and high on drugs.</P>
<P>The climactic commando rescue raid on the ELT in the jungle is led by
Terry and his fellow ransom expert (David Caruso)--in this country to
negotiate for an Italian hostage--and his band of indistinguishable
mercenaries. Their raid lacked any emotion, as did the film's final
scene between Crowe and Meg, where they shake hands and go their
separate ways after Morse comes home, even though the would-be lovers
know they love each other. Their romance was forgettable, leaving me
feeling too distant from the lovers and their flirtatious romance. It
certainly didn't have the impact of the romantic parting in
"Casablanca," an ending this film tried to emulate. The film just
didn't have too much juice in its hackneyed story, or in its
generalized characterization of revolutionaries, oil moguls, and
heroes.</P>
