Reviewed April 4, 1999</P>
<P>Based on the 1970 comedy written by Neil Simon and starring Jack Lemmon 
and Sandy Dennis, the '90s update of "The Out-of-Towners" contains the 
same basic plot, but comparisons pretty much end right there. Although 
the film doesn't have what it takes to pull over to the side of comic 
brilliance, the movie is fast-paced and enjoyable enough, aided by the 
dynamite duo of Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn.</P>
<P>Unhappy Ohio suburbanites Henry (Martin) and Nancy Clark (Hawn) are 
suffering through separate mid-life crisises. While Henry is harboring 
the secret that he has been laid off from his job and is about to travel 
to New York City to be interviewed for a high-profile advertising 
position, Nancy is depressed because all of their adult children have 
finally left the nest and her relationship with Henry has seriously 
dwindled. On the spur of the moment, Nancy decides to accompany Henry on 
his trip, and that is the start of a wild, dangerous, and crazy 24-hour 
period of hijinx in the city that never sleeps. It's pretty safe to say 
that almost every outrageous thing that could happen does happen. </P>
<P>"The Out-of-Towners" has two things going for it and, walking into the 
theater, you knew that at least one of them couldn't fail (the 
partnering of Martin and Hawn). Martin is one of the great modern-day 
comedians (as far as I'm concerned, he is funnier than all of the recent 
ones, like Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler), while Hawn is always a bright 
and winning presence. Since they both have perfect comic timing, many of 
the jokes were bound not to fail, and there are many that are downright 
hilarious (on the other hand, a few fall flat). One of the scenes that 
gave me the loudest laugh was when Nancy is reading the map to Henry as 
they are driving to the city. "You know this upcoming exit?" Nancy asks. 
Henry immediately turns off onto the exit. "Well, keep going past that," 
Nancy continues. Very funny. And how about the sequence where they 
accidentally walk in on a sexaholics anonymous meeting within a church 
and get caught up within the group discussion. These delightful moments 
are also thanks to the second reason the film is an overall successful 
venture, and that is Marc Lawrence's slight, but constantly snappy 
screenplay.</P>
<P>In a memorable supporting role, John Cleese plays the manager of a ritzy 
New York hotel who gets involved in the couple's plight and is 
discovered later on by Nancy dancing around a hotel room in women's 
clothes and stiletto high heels. Cleese has some subtly amusing moments, 
particularly one in which, while in the hotel's lobby, he stops for a 
second to admire a customer's outfit. Meanwhile, mayor Rudy Giuliani 
appears in a cameo and could have been used to fabulously zany effect in 
one of the film's key scenes, but is wasted and thrown to the wayside.</P>
<P>Inevitably, through all of the various mishaps that occur, Henry and 
Nancy start to come to terms with their marriage and begin to fall in 
love with each other all over again. It may very well be predictable 
(and it is), but it is the high energy of Martin and Hawn that keeps 
this light-as-a-feather comedy afloat. I hope they work together again 
real soon.</P>
