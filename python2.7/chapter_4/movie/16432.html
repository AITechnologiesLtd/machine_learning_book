<PRE>Tomorrow Never Dies</PRE>
<P>Officially, the new Bond will get back media because the media is the
villain, much like with Natural Born Killers. Unofficially, it still sucks.
But its, you must understand, more classic bond. That's true for all the
bond scripts, predictable with a bunch of one liners. Think of Bond as
Freddy or Jason, with a change for the good, better looks, and a Makarov
pistol instead of a chainsaw or the Edward Sciscorhands motif. You have to
like the classic kind to like any of them. Goldeneye WAS NOT classic bond,
and, in my mind, that made it an inferior sequel because it didn't work with
Sequel mentality.</P>
<P>That isn't to say that "Tomorrow Never Dies" didn't suck. In fact, most
"Bond"'s are only useful because we get a really good song at the beginning
(I.E. "Nobody does it better" in the beginning of "The Spy Who Loved Me").
That and to help along movies that spoof them (Spy Hard and the infamous
lines in Trainspotting: "He's always been lacking in moral fiber."
"He knows a lot about Sean Connery"
"That's hardly a substitute")</P>
<P>You gotta admit the stunts were good, and on the overall the technological
aspect of the movie was as good as any, but the acting, directing, etc. The
parts that make a movie good, sucked. Brosnan's British accent may be real,
but his part of 007 and his silly interactions, combined with his aged looks
make him not play 007 well. The idea that women would THROW themselves at
him just doesn't make sense. But, hey, women are one of life's mysteries.</P>
<P>As for the women in this movie, combined with Price (I'm reasonably sure he
either was once or wishes to be a woman (murder over jealousy, such a
feminine motive)). I don't know WHY anyone wanted to be in this bond film.
They don't get good lines at all, or good names (Wai Lin?? PARIS???) Nothing
compared to Onatop. Oh well, Expect great and you will be disappointed.
Expect nothing and you won't.</P>
