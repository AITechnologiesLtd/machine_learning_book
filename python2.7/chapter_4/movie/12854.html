<P>Walking out of this movie, a friend mentioned to me that, although not
every comedy is great, they all have their 'moments.' This needed no
explanation, for the law of averages says that as long as you keep
trying, you're bound to succeed sometime. What's unfortunate, though, is
that the genuinely comical setups in ALMOST HEROES are so far and few
between that all of the remaing humor - as crass, crude, and obtrusive
as possible - makes the movie completely not worth the money. </P>
<P>The foremost scapegoat for every failed comedy is the screenwriter, or
in this case the team of three responsible for this cinematic atrocity.
Mark Nutter, Tom Wolfe, and Boyd Hale, none of whom (save possibly
Nutter, who's had supporting roles in MICHAEL and TV's JAG) have any
experience in the motion picture industry and have penned no other
feature films, have drawn out a script that's painful to watch.
Literally painful as well, it's nothing more than a series of
half-hearted conversations which string together drug-induced
caricatures and non-sequitous physical comedy. You don't write much
worse than this. </P>
<P>But even the worst of screenplays can be made to look plausible with an
inspired bit of acting. Unfortunately that's all the audience gets: bits
and pieces. The late Chris Farley plays Bartholomew Hunt, and Matthew
Perry is Leslie Edwards. Together, the two, along with a hodgepodge crew
of derelicts and invalids, are mounting a mission to go west before
Lewis and Clark do. Farley is outrageously comical, but in this setting
his enthusiasm is mistaken for scene-stealing, and he doesn't win much
audience appeal. Perry is downright obnoxious, and his character is so
unlikeable that he has no chance either. The rest of the crew are simply
stereotypes which were designed solely for the purpose of being the butt
of many jokes. </P>
<P>This is the second movie of such low quality in a remarkably short
amount of time (after the earlier-in-May BLACK DOG). Maybe it says
something about the willingness of Hollywood to produce downright
unwatchable films, for the cinema is being increasingly saturated with
stale products such as ALMOST HEROES. This one can't be seen to light
under any setting, except for extremely enthusastic Farley fans. It
doesn't come near his other films in appeal or taste, and should be left
to wallow in the wake of more worthy, upcoming summer films.</P>
<P>FINAL AWARD FOR "ALMOST HEROES": 1.0 star - a poor movie.</P>
