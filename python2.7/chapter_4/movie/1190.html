<P>[I am posting five reviews of STAR TREK VI.  I could easily swamp the group
with reviews of this movie, so I will probably not post any more unless
they say something very different than those posted here (e.g., a review
of the fashions in STAR TREK VI :-) ).  Followups are directed to
rec.arts.startrek to keep the discussion in the appropriate group.

<PRE>                    STAR TREK VI: THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY
                                 [Spoilers]
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1991 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  This is a farewell to the original crew
     in a minor political thriller about Klingon perestroika and
     the old-line Cold Warriors who do not want to accept change.
     True fans of STAR TREK will be amazed at how closely the fall
     of the Soviet Union predicted what was going to happen in
     STAR TREK VI.  Not the best of the series, but it is
     entertaining.  Rating: +1 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     Dearly beloved, we are gathered for the final adventure of the original
crew of the starship Enterprise.  The remote control has been passed to a
new generation who are less and less interested in seeing swash-buckling
heroes the age of their grandparents.  And if the truth be known, Captain
Kirk, Scotty, and Uhura are all sporting spare tires around the middle these
days.  Bones looks old.  Spock seems to be ageing the best of the original
crew and comes the closest to still being dashing.  I guess on at least some
level that is not surprising.  We always knew there was something very
different about Spock and it just sort of rubbed off on Leonard Nimoy.</P>
<P>     So what sort of adventure is the final outing?  The title implies that
the plot in a major way involves "death--the undiscover'd country, from
whose bourn no traveller returns," an allusion to the "To be or not to be"
speech from Act III, Scene 1 of HAMLET.  So did the filmmakers have the
courage to kill off someone we loved and make that death meaningful, or did
they find some way to cop out?  Well, that would be telling!  In any case,
the main story is an end-of-the-Cold-War thriller, much like THE PACKAGE but
reset in the "Star Trek" universe.</P>
<P>     When the film opens, a Klingon Chernobyl incident has convinced the
evil empire that the time has come for perestroika.  On each side there are
hard-liners who still live with the paranoia of the past, and new-liners who
want to see a reconciliation and a new universe order.  One Federation
hard-liner is that crusty old Cold Warrior, Captain James Kirk (played
somewhat against type by William Shatner).  One of the new-liners is an old
associate of his, Commander Spock (played this time around by Leonard
Nimoy).  The plot then proceeds to set up a fairly intriguing mystery and
puzzle.  An incident occurs that seems totally inexplicable.  Kirk is framed
to appear to have sabotaged the peace.  This is the high point of the film.
Unfortunately, the mystery's solution is very unconvincing.  It is nearly as
bad as the strategy puzzle in STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN.  That one was
solved by the scriptwriter saying, "Oh, didn't you know?  The Enterprise has
the power to shut down the shields on other federation ships!"  The solution
to the puzzle here is not as bad as that of the WRATH OF KHAN problem, but
it is bad.  I will explain why in a spoiler after the review.</P>
<P>     Other touches were irritating, like repeated allusions to both
Shakespeare and Sherlock Holmes.  It is a strange and unlikely touch that
Klingons revere William Shakespeare and even claim him as a Klingon.</P>
<P>     With the exception of one violent scene in zero gravity the special
effects are not particularly new or creative, though many of the exteriors
in space are still quite beautiful.  Occasionally narrow-angle shots were
used when showing a new locale on a planet.  This was probably to save on
the creation of sets since less would be within the range of the camera, but
it is a stark contrast to earlier chapters.</P>
<P>     Two problems in casting were minor problems.  The first was an
unaccountable resemblance between the Klingon David Warner played in STAR
TREK VI and the kidnapped diplomat he played in STAR TREK V.  Also,
Christian Slater plays the kid who has won a contest and got to play in a
scene of a real "Star Trek" movie.  He has one brief, no-talent-needed
scene.</P>
<PRE>     All told, this is a minor thriller and a just okay entry in the series.
I give it a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</PRE>
<PRE>                         **SPOILER**</PRE>
<P>     Spoiler: For two reasons I think that the solution to the mystery
torpedo problem is bad.  First, it assumes a new piece of technology to come
along at a perfect but unlikely moment.  That is possible but it seems a
plot contrivance.  What bothers me more is the geometry of the situation.  A
photon torpedo travels in a straight line.  If that line does not intersect
your torpedo tubes, it was not your torpedo.  It would be hard to position
another torpedo tube so the trajectory could be close enough to fool the
bridge.  Ideally the attackers would want to be in front of your torpedo
tubes, but they could not because of the instantaneous loss of cloaking.
Their would have to position themselves so that their torpedo would fly in
just the right plane.  Even then, if the trajectory was observed from
elsewhere on the Enterprise, the jig would have been up.  If the victim ship
were watching the Enterprise, they would have seen an impossible torpedo
trajectory and also, for an instant, the ship that was firing on them.</P>
<P>     Question: if a shape-changer wanted to prove she was a shape changer,
wouldn't she just change her shape?  Evelyn asked this one.</P>
