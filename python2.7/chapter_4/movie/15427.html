Traveller (Reviewed on Nov. 7/98)</PRE>
<P>Starring Bill Paxton, Mark Wahlberg, Julianna Margulies</P>
<P>There's something about watching con men at work that never fails
to fascinate me.  Likely, it's because I know that I would never
be able to pull off a con, no matter how small.  I just don't have
what it takes to look a man straight in the eyes and lie to him.
Many of the characters in "Traveller" have the ability to do that, 
and much more.</P>
<P>The movie stars Bill Paxton as a con man at the top of his game,
and Mark Wahlberg as his young protoge.  They are teamed up when
Paxton sticks up for Wahlberg in front of his people, who refuse to
accept him.  His "people" are gypsies, who rely on con men like 
Paxton to keep the money flowing in.  The movie starts off predictably
with Paxton showing Wahlberg the ropes, but then veers off into 
totally unexpected territory.</P>
<P>"Traveller" is an odd movie in that you never quite know what it's
going to do next.  For a while, you think it's a movie along the
lines of "The Sting", with the older man showing the naive kid the
ropes.  But then it becomes something different, and I think that's
what I liked most about the film.  Too many films today have 
predictable outcomes, and a five year old can usually guess at how
the movie's going to end.  "Traveller" never quite settles into a 
niche, and I was happy to be watching a film that I couldn't quite
put my finger on.</P>
<P>The performances are first rate, with Paxton redeeming himself for
"Twister".  At the outset of the film, we're not too sure if we like
him.  He's taking advantage of innocent people and generally acting
like a bad-ass.  But as the movie progresses, and as he falls in love
with the Julianna Margules character, we start to see a different
side to him emerge.  And to me, this is the sign of a good actor.  
Someone who can make you think one thing, but later on, force you
to re-evaluate what you originally thought.  Wahlberg is good, too,
as a natural-born grifter.</P>
<P>"Traveller" is the type of movie that, after you watch it, you will
likely be suspecting everyone around you of ripping you off for the
next week.  Hey, it beats thinking an asteroid is going to destroy
the earth.</P>
