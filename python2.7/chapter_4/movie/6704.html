<P>WARNING: This review contains spoilers.</P>
<P>Until I saw Kenneth Branagh's 238-minute, full-text version of HAMLET, 
I thought nothing could rival Laurence Olivier's classic 1948 film 
version. I've always loved Olivier's subtle, sensitive, and poetic 
performance as Hamlet, in addition to the way that his film wrapped 
everything in a moody black and white chiaroscuro. But Branagh has 
created a powerful masterpiece that is psychologically complex and 
lushly cinematic. Never have all the nuances of Shakespeare's story 
been more vibrantly examined on screen. I predict that Branagh's 
HAMLET will eventually become the definitive film version of 
Shakespeare's play; yet, I make this prediction with some degree of 
sadness because Olivier's version has always been one of my favorite 
movies.</P>
<P>Of course, Branagh had advantages that Olivier could only dream of in 
1948, including a studio willing to finance and release a version that 
is nearly four hours long. With an hour and 20 minutes less to tell 
the story, Olivier's version is less dramatically coherent and omits 
some rather important minor characters, notably Rosencrantz and 
Guildenstern. Also, Branagh had at his disposal the magician's bag of 
technical tricks available to today's filmmaker, including digital 
special effects. I only hope that people who are excited by Branagh's 
HAMLET might be inspired to take a look at Olivier's film in order to 
compare different takes on Shakespeare's classic story.</P>
<P>Both Olivier and Branagh have managed to breathe the kind of life into 
the title role that makes for a classic film. Branagh's interpretation 
of Hamlet differs greatly from Olivier's, but then there is no correct 
way to play the role. Olivier's Hamlet is focused on the character's 
melancholia and indecisiveness, while Branagh encompasses a greater 
emotional range, running through a spectrum from an almost serene 
state of intellectual contemplation to an intense anger that 
threatens to tear his sanity apart. Thus, there are more nuances in 
Branagh's portrayal than in Olivier's.</P>
<P>Branagh's film is a veritable feast for the eyes with dazzling 
cinematography that is all the more vivid because of the crystalline 
clarity and trompe l'oeil depth of the 70 mm format. And Branagh makes 
excellent use of color in his film, made credible in part by changing 
the setting of the story to the latter half of the nineteenth century. 
This change also justifies impressive location shooting at Blenheim 
Palace, which plays the role of Shakespeare's Elsinore Castle. 
However, as richly visual as this film is, its dynamic visual aspects 
never detract from the substance of the story or the beauty of 
Shakespeare's words.</P>
<P>At the core of the artistry in Branagh's movie is that all the 
elements of film making come together in a seamlessly integrated work. 
Where Branagh's film outshines Olivier's is in its intricacy and in 
its ability to bring image, word, performance, and music into a 
gestalt of pure genius. </P>
<P>The story of HAMLET has to be one of the most famous in the English 
language, but I'll refresh your memory with a broad synopsis. The 
film's focal character is the Danish prince Hamlet, who is deeply 
disturbed over his mother Gertrude's (Julie Christie) quick marriage  
to Claudius (Derek Jacobi), the brother of Hamlet's dead father. Soon, 
Hamlet has an encounter with what appears to be his father's ghost, 
who informs him that Claudius murdered him and that it is now Hamlet's 
duty to take revenge for this murder by killing Claudius. The tragedy 
then grows out of Hamlet's delay in carrying out this revenge.</P>
<P>Branagh's film illuminates an often overlooked aspect of the story, 
namely that it is not merely a personal tragedy for Hamlet, but it is 
also a tragedy for Denmark and its people. Because of Hamlet's 
indecisiveness, the Danes must endure the consequences of a political 
power vacuum and corrupt leadership. Then, near the film's end, there 
are scenes of Hamlet fighting a duel in Elsinore Castle interspersed 
with scenes of Fortinbras, Prince of Norway, and his army closing in 
on the Castle. At the end of the duel, the Danish Prince, King, and 
Queen all lie dead and the fate of Denmark and its people has fallen 
into the hands of Fortinbras.</P>
<P>Branagh's HAMLET makes good use of the classic Shakespearean motif of 
illusion and reality. In a scene that filled me with terror, Hamlet 
meets the ghost of his father (played menacingly by Brian Blessed). 
Special effects along with excellent acting and direction make the 
ambiguity between specter and hallucination come alive on the screen. 
There is a supernaturally sharp focus to this scene, and Blessed's 
eyes are a deathly shade of blue and strangely distorted. At times 
his face and eyes fill the screen. The ghost's highly processed voice 
(it reminded me at times of Darth Vader's voice in STAR WARS) rumbles 
across the surrounding area, cracking open the ground under Hamlet's 
feet. When the ghost instructs Hamlet to "Remember me!", there is 
little doubt that Hamlet could ever forget.</P>
<P>The difficulty in distinguishing between illusion and reality is 
clearly a factor in Hamlet's delay in killing the King. Before 
carrying out this act of revenge, Hamlet must determine the veracity 
of what he believes he saw and heard. Was it a hallucination, an 
apparition, or even the devil in disguise? Or was it the actual ghost 
of his father's spirit? Dramatic tension is maintained throughout the 
film; and until the dueling scene near the movie's end, it is neither 
clear nor simple when or whether Hamlet should take action on the 
ghost's mandated revenge. </P>
<P>Another strong scene that also echoes the motif of appearance and 
reality is when Hamlet "tests the conscience of the king" by altering 
a play put on by a traveling group of players to mirror the ghost's 
description of the murder. Hamlet hopes that Claudius's reaction will 
determine if the ghost was telling the truth. Hamlet feigns an "antic 
disposition" to camouflage his actions and protect himself from 
Claudius, who poses a real threat to him if he knows that Hamlet 
suspects him of regicide. Branagh's performance is what makes this 
scene so dynamic. While waiting to see how Claudius reacts to the 
play, Hamlet struggles within himself trying to contain an anger that 
is tearing his sanity apart. As the scene progresses, it is not 
entirely clear whether the madness he is putting on is an act anymore.</P>
<P>Every aspect of Branagh's production, even set design, enhances 
meaning and emotional impact. The main gallery of Elsinore Castle 
contains a hall of mirrors that cast a dizzying myriad of reflections 
and conceal doors leading to secret rooms--a breathtaking visual 
metaphor that again echoes the motif of illusion and reality. It is to 
one of these mirrors that Branagh delivers the famous "To be, or not 
to be" soliloquy. As the soliloquy progresses, the camera comes in 
tighter and tighter on the reflection until it appears to be Hamlet 
himself who is speaking and not his reflected image.</P>
<P>Another strength of this film is how it uses visually stunning images  
to intensify dramatic impact. For example, in one scene Hamlet slowly 
inserts a blade aimed at the head of Claudius who is alone at prayer. 
On the surface, it appears to be the perfect time to act out the 
revenge. As Hamlet debates the merits of killing the repentant 
Claudius, the blade inches closer to the head of Claudius who is 
oblivious to the threat that is just a hair's-breadth away. Hamlet 
decides that killing Claudius would be an unsatisfactory form of 
revenge since Claudius's soul would go to heaven since he is at 
prayer, and the blade is then slowly withdrawn. The knife being 
inserted through the screen adds power and dramatic tension, making 
an already thrilling scene burn white-hot with emotion.</P>
<P>Branagh's performance is magnetic; his performance acts as a center of 
gravity. Yet, the other performances are strong enough not to be 
overwhelmed. Branagh assembled an international cast of the highest 
caliber, and most of the performances are exemplary. I'll comment on a 
few that impressed me most. Derek Jacobi's Claudius has a regal and 
controlled surface demeanor that occasionally cracks to reveal the 
dangerous monster lurking just underneath his public facade. Claudius 
here is a cold-blooded, pragmatic man, and Jacobi makes him as 
bone-chilling as the snow-covered landscape just outside the castle 
walls. The character of Gertrude has so often been portrayed as 
weak-willed and passive, but Julie Christie plays this role with a 
hedonistic charisma that speaks to Claudius's motivation--as evil as 
his actions are, they are not beyond the pale of credibility given the 
attractiveness of Christie's Gertrude. Kate Winslet is well cast as 
Ophelia, bringing an air of vulnerability to the role, which, when 
combined with  flashbacks showing a sexual relationship between Hamlet 
and Ophelia, makes the character's eventual emotional breakdown more 
believable to contemporary audiences.</P>
<P>Added to the mix of Shakespearian actors, there are quite a few 
recognizable faces from Hollywood--Charlton Heston, Billy Crystal, 
Robin Williams, Jack Lemmon. With the exception of Jack Lemmon, who is 
badly miscast as Marcellus, their performances hold up well against 
the competition. Heston is a wonderful choice for the role of the 
Player King; his rich voice and clear delivery are perfect for 
Shakespeare. And Crystal's considerable comedic gifts make the 
conversation between the two grave diggers sparkle with wit and humor. </P>
<P>The four-hour version of HAMLET was released on Christmas Day in New 
York, Toronto, and Los Angeles, in the 70 mm format, and a shorter, 35 
mm version will also be released nationwide at the end of January, 
1997. Given the positive response to the longer version, I hope that 
it will also remain in release, at least in larger cities and 
university towns. With its visual vividness, emotional depth, and 
complexity, the longer version is the one I recommend. Don't let the 
length scare you; the longer version is a highly entertaining film. 
Plus, a film like this produces an event atmosphere where you can 
catch a theater-like spark of excitement in the air during 
intermission. For Shakespeare lovers this is a dream come true; if 
you are not a Shakespeare lover, this might just turn you into one. 
Don't miss one of the film experiences of a lifetime--HAMLET has 
never before been realized with such power, passion, and pathos.   </P>
