<PRE>                             THE SECRET GARDEN
                       A film review by Eric Walker
                        Copyright 1993 Eric Walker</PRE>
<P>     Hollywood hates children.  The major studios see movies made for
the entire family as quick money-makers that portray the world as
sweetness and light.  They also have to be simple so that kids "can
understand them," with clear-cut good guys and bad guys and a happy
ending where the bad guys are defeated so that the good guys can have a
happy ending.  Movies for children these days must contain idiotic
slapstick, such as with the HOME ALONE movies and DENNIS THE MENACE, or
else they must be shameless, stupid tearjerkers like FREE WILLY or
HEART AND SOULS, or else they must be animated and full of special
effects and talking animals, as in the Disney films.  None of today's
Hollywood directors seem interested in making a challenging,
entertaining film that the entire family can enjoy.</P>
<P>     So it's no surprise that the most remarkable Hollywood debut since
Kenneth Branagh's HENRY V has come from Europe.  Agnieszka Holland, who
is best known for directing the outstanding drama EUROPA EUROPA, has
come to Hollywood, and in particular to Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope
Studios.  She made THE SECRET GARDEN, which utterly destroys the
conventions of Hollywood "family" movies.  It's the most amazing
feature film since THE BLACK STALLION (which also came from
Zoetrope--not a coincidence?), and it's a movie likely to be remembered
for years to come.</P>
<P>     This film has everything that Hollywood movies don't: a complete
lack of "good guys" and "bad guys," outstanding acting, believable,
lifelike performances from all--children and adults alike--beautiful,
haunting scenery, a warm, life-affirming message that everyone is good
(but the message is not the least bit sickly-sweet), and a storyline
that will genuinely touch your heart and soul.</P>
<P>     Based on the classic novel of the same name, it's the story of
young Mary Lennox, a spoiled young girl born to a "society" family in
India--but because her parents are part of society, they have no time
to give their daughter a proper upbringing.  She can't even dress
herself without a servant, and she is ignored her whole life.  She
never even learns how to cry.</P>
<P>     But when Mary's parents die in an earthquake, she is sent to
England to live with her uncle, Lord Craven, in a huge, mysterious
mansion in the English countryside called Misselthwaite.  It's a dark,
lonely place, completely shut up and seemingly trapping all life inside
it, refusing to let things grow.  Mary is promptly told by the head
servant, Mrs. Medlock, where her place is: just as before, she is to
keep to herself and be ignored, because Lord Craven refuses to see
her.</P>
<P>     But Mary is a stubborn, feisty spirit, and she will not allow
herself to be stifled.  It isn't long before she's out and about,
roaming the castle and the land around it, discovering the secrets of
why Misselthwaite came to be such a desolate place.  She soon unlocks
the door to the heart of the mystery: a garden, hidden away and
untended for ten years, visited by no one except the animals.  This
garden is not dead, however--underneath the weeds and the neglected
growths, there is life waiting to emerge and grow once again.</P>
<P>     Here's where the film's message makes itself clear: love and
caring will heal the deepest wounds and cause flowers to burst forth
from the most barren ground--even the cold, lonely hearts of
Mrs. Medlock and Lord Craven himself.  It's all told in an utterly
believable, careful fashion, so that we are never once hit over the
head by the message and we look at it as gooey Hollywood sap.</P>
<P>     As she breaks down the rigid order of things at Misselwaite and
allows life to enter the manor once again, Mary makes some friends at
last: the young, naive farmboy Dickon, who loves the animals and knows
how to care for the garden; and the pale, sickly Colin Craven, a young
boy who represents the stifling effect of the manor.  He's been
bedridden for ten years, tended by doctors and the well-meaning
servants, but what he really needs is love to bring him back to
health.  That's what all the residents of Misselthwaite need, and Mary
causes them all to sprout and reach for the sun once again.</P>
<P>     Much of the credit for the film's success goes to director
Holland, who is not afraid to use darkness to make us appreciate the
light.  We feel the ominous presence of Lord Craven's curse throughout
the entire film; it's there, behind every corner, waiting for the
chance to strike us down.  It's a far cry from the cheap, treacly-sweet
world of Hollywood kiddie movies, where you can't even say the word
"death" for fear of upsetting the children in the audience.  Its thesis
darkness that gives this film its resonance, letting us feel for Mary
and her friends.</P>
<P>     Animals are used as metaphors for the re-birth of life: a robin
leads Mary to the garden, it raises a family, and more and more animals
appear (squirrels, woodchucks, deer, lambs) as the garden is re-born.
It's been said that you should never appear in the same scene with
animals, because they steal away all of the attention, but that's not
true here.  They play their part as well as the actors, appearing on
the sidelines and making us smile, but never milking our sympathies so
that we say "aww, cute!" There's no "cute" here, but there is great
beauty.  The film exults in the joys of Nature, and we revel in it.</P>
<P>     This story seems obvious as I type it down, but on the screen the
elements blend together so beautifully--the darkness, the acting, the
scenery, the story--that not once did I ever think it was
predictable.  I found tears welling my eyes from the film's pure joy,
and my heart was stirred.  As the film moved towards its end, I found
myself thinking and even praying that there would be a happy ending.  I
cared for the characters so much that I did not want to see a tragedy,
such as death, put in to add cheap drama and make s cry.</P>
<P>     Suffice to say, the film does not descend to the level of crass
manipulation.  It never falters, from the first frame to the last.</P>
<P>     And here is where I have to report the bad news: it seems doubtful
that THE SECRET GARDEN will be seen by many of the people it was made
for.  This is a G-rated movie--an endangered species in
Hollywood--because it contains no violence.  It is not animated.  It
has no action scenes, no special effects (except for a scene where the
garden springs to life over the course of several weeks), and the
audience Hollywood caters to above all others--teenagers--will probably
find the movie boring because of this.  As a result, Hollywood decides
to promote ridiculously moronic comedies like THE CONEHEADS and
SON-IN-LAW as "family" entertainment.  Warner Bros., the studio
releasing THE SECRET GARDEN, is promoting FREE WILLY as the "family
movie of the summer!"  They don't realize what a treasure they have
here.  In the Boston area, this movie is only appearing at one single
theater (the Copley Place mall), while the mean-spirited and cruel
DENNIS THE MENACE was released to nearly two thousand theaters across
the country.</P>
<P>     Therefore, I urge you: go and see THE SECRET GARDEN now, before
it's too late.  It's an experience you won't forget.  You will be
delighted, entertained, moved, and you will leave the theater with a
smile on your face and joy in your heart.</P>
<PRE>     This film is a true garden of earthly delights.</PRE>
<PRE>.
