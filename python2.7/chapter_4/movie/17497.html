<PRE>CENTRAL STATION (M).  
(Dendy Films)
Director: Walter Salles
Stars: Fernanda Montenegro, Vincinius De Oliviera, Marila Pera, Soia Lira
Running time: 110 minutes
(Spanish, with English subtitles).</PRE>
<P>At heart, Central Station (Central do Brasil) is a road movie
in which two characters with little in common develop a strong bond of
friendship that changes them.  Central Station also has a humanity and
sense of compassion that sets it apart from a number of similarly
themed films.  The central story of an unlikely friendship that
develops between a hard hearted elderly curmudgeon and the young boy
who becomes her reluctant companion on an odyssey fondly recalls the
recent Oscar winner Kolya.  This simple, yet heart warming tale will
appeal to a similar audience.</P>
<P>Central Station is set in Rio De Janeiro, a sprawling and
pitiless city in which overcrowding, abject poverty and illiteracy are
rife.  Dora (played magnificently by veteran Brazilian actress
Fernanda Montenegro) is a retired school teacher who ekes out a living
as a letter writer.  Based in the heart of Brazil's sprawling Central
Station, Dora patiently writes letters for the illiterate population
at a dollar a letter.  However, every night she returns to her flat
where she and her neighbour Irene (Marilia Pera) decide which of the
letters to post.</P>
<P>One day she encounters Ana (Soia Lira) and her nine year old
son Josue (Vincinius de Oliviera), who wants to send a letter to her
husband, a drunkard who abandoned her years ago.  She wants to arrange
a meeting between him and the son he has never met, but Dora doesn't
post the letter, believing that Ana is better off without him.  A
couple of days later Ana is killed in an accident outside the station,
and Josue is left all alone.</P>
<P>Initially indifferent to the boy's fate, Dora eventually takes
pity on him and brings him home.  She then sells him to an adoption
agency for some desperately needed cash.  But when she learns that the
agency may actually be a front for an international organisation that
kills orphaned kids for the organs, she rescues Josue and sets out to
return him to his father.  It is a journey that transforms the two,
bringing them closer together.</P>
<P>As the odd pair travel into an increasingly remote and harsh
destination, Salles takes the audience on a parallel journey through
contemporary Brazil.  He exposes the harsh reality of this depressing
country, but he somehow finds an optimistic and hopeful streak that
augurs well for the future.  Dora is symbolic of the old, traditional
Brazil, while Josue comes to represent the future and change.  A grim
scene in which a young shoplifter is brutally executed shows the fate
that would probably have awaited young Josue.</P>
<P>The film benefits enormously from the two wonderful central
performances that grab the audience's sympathy.  Montenegro is superb,
and her wonderfully expressive and beautifully nuanced performance
conveys the spectacular emotional growth of her character.  She moves
from the bitter, weary and cynical old woman we meet at the start to
one who develops maternal feelings and experiences compassion for
probably the first time in her life.  It is an extraordinary
performance that makes this transformation credible.  In his debut
film role, young de Oliviera has a winning, unassuming and natural
charm that will melt hearts.  He almost steals the film away from
Montenegro.</P>
<P>A former documentary film maker with an interest in themes of
identity and exile, Salles brings a sense of compassion and compelling
realism to the film's political subtext.  However, he eschews the
cynical manipulation that suffuses most American movies that travel
this terrain.  Heavily influenced by legendary directors of the
calibre of John Ford, Visconti and the late Akira Kurosawa, Salles'
film explores a similar emotional and physical terrain.  This haunting
and moving film also resonates with a similar sense of epic sweep and
visual beauty.  Walter Carvalho's often breath taking cinematography
captures the harsh beauty and landscapes of Brazil and is an integral
part of the charm of this deeply affecting and moving film.</P>
<P>It's a pity that Central Station was nominated for an Oscar in
the same year as Roberto Benigni's wonderful Life Is Beautiful,
because it is would also have been a worthy winner.</P>
