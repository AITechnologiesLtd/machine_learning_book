<P>     THE POSTMAN, an Italian film from British director Michael Radford 
(WHITE MISCHIEF, THE ELIXIR), is a charming piece of cinema that takes 
several comfortable formulas and expands upon them in ingenious and 
emotionally-satisfying ways.  There's a little of everything here:  
poetry, politics, humor, love, and heartbreak.  Best of all, these 
elements flow together seamlessly in a production characterized by solid 
acting, balanced pacing, and eye-catching cinematography. </P>
<P>     Mario (played by the late Italian writer/director/actor Massimo 
Troisi) is a postman in a fishing village on a small island off the 
coast of Italy.  Arriving there in 1953 is famed Chilean poet Pablo 
Neruda (Philippe Noiret), exiled from his native country for espousing 
communist doctrine.  Mario is curious about this new resident who, 
despite his advancing age, has a seemingly magical power over women.  
Eventually, after delivering Neruda's mail for a while, he gets up the 
courage to engage the poet in a conversation about writing.  This begins 
an unusual collaboration, with Mario providing a sounding board for 
Neruda's ideas and Neruda teaching Mario about poetry and its 
relationship to life.  </P>
<P>     Although all of THE POSTMAN is wonderfully engaging, the last act 
lends added resonance to everything that has come before.  The final 
thirty minutes change this film from a good little movie to a *great* 
little movie.  Radford has a subtle touch that draws out the best from 
characters and situations.  One could argue that all films seek to 
manipulate; in the case of THE POSTMAN, it is done with the utmost 
skill.  This picture is affecting because, instead of relying on 
Hollywood's sledgehammer tactics of toying with an audience, it plumbs a 
wellspring of deeply-felt, honest emotion. </P>
<P>     In the final performance of a great career, Massimo Troisi (who 
died at the age of 41, shortly after completing this picture) gives us a 
memorable character.  Hesitant, shy, and uncultured, Mario has the heart 
of a poet, but little talent with words.  In this post-FORREST GUMP era, 
it would be easy to compare him to the Tom Hanks character, but Mario is 
really a more complex individual.  He occasionally makes some 
startlingly insightful observations, such as "the whole world is a 
metaphor for something," often without realizing how thought-provoking 
his comments are.  THE POSTMAN is about Mario, and Troisi imbues him 
with a captivating humanity.   </P>
<P>     Philipe Noiret's Pablo Neruda is the perfect foil for Mario -- a 
kindred spirit with all the experience and talent that the postman 
lacks.  Noiret plays Neruda as part father-figure, part dreamer, and 
part realist.  When Mario asks him how to become a poet, the older man 
responds by advising his "pupil" to take a walk along the island's 
shoreline and see what images come to mind.  After Mario has fallen for 
the stunning Beatrice (Maria Grazia Cucinotta), Neruda tells him about 
the many women of that name to have inspired poets. </P>
<P>     For two hours, it's possible to fall under THE POSTMAN's spell and 
be completely enchanted.  There is more vitality and genuine passion 
here than in any ten big-budget extravaganzas.  This movie about words 
and images will delight not just because it entertains, but because it 
takes the motion picture experience one step further, and fulfills.  
Look for THE POSTMAN this summer.  It will be one of the year's more 
rewarding theatrical experiences. </P>
