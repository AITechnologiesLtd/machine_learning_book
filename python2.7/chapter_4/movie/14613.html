A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Vincent Ward</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: Ron Bass</PRE>
<P>Ingredients: Heaven, hell, life after death</P>
<P>Starring: Robin Williams Cuba Gooding Jr., Annabella Sciorra</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
During his life, a guy named Christy (Robin Williams) finds his soulmate
in a girl named Annie (Annabella Sciorra), marries her, and fathers
children. After death, Christy explores heaven, but finds life empty
without his wife and children, so he goes searching for them. Annie is
hardest to find because she's not in heaven.</P>
<P>Opinion:
WHAT DREAMS MAY COME is colorful and daring in its vision because it
attempts to portray the imaginary universe of life after death, and how
the soul of an individual can see beyond the material world and in fact
create entire universes. In its portrayal of heaven, hell, and life
after death, WHAT DREAMS MAY COME is a visually exciting and wonderful
movie and a successful blend of computer technology with movie-making. </P>
<P>That being said, despite good acting and imaginative concepts of life
after death, the plot of WHAT DREAMS MAY COME is entirely staid and
predictable, and the ending comes as no surprise to anyone. The movie's
main value lies in its ability to inspire.</P>
