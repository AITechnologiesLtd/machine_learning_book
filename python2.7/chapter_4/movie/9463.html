<PRE>BOOGIE NIGHTS (1997)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Writer/Director: Paul Thomas Anderson
Starring: Mark Wahlberg, Burt Reynolds, Julliane Moore, John C. Reilly,
Don Cheadle, Heather Graham, William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Philip
Seymour Hoffman, Philip Baker Hall, Alfred Molina, Robert Ridgley, Nina
Hartley, Joanna Gleason</P>
<P>Everyone has something they can do better than anyone else.  Eddie Adams
(Mark Wahlberg) is good at fucking.  With a huge penis that is not shown
until the perfect time (in a hilarious scene), Eddie is nothing but a
good, dumb swinger.  I mean, the guy has a little sideline to his manual
labor job of showing his penis for 5 bucks, and stroking off for 10.</P>
<P>One night at his nightclub job, a man observes him.  This man turns out
to be none other than Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds), adult filmmaker.  He
approaches him in the dishroom, saying "You got something wonderful in
those pants just waiting to pop out," and after a little, uh, soul
searching, Eddie has renamed himself Dirk Diggler, seems to be living
with him, and two fellow porn stars - Amber Waves (Julliane Moore), a
coke-snorting maternal woman who has a kid from another marriage who she
wants to see more of; and Rollergirl ("Swingers"' Heather Graham), a
drop-out who seems to be glued to her rollerskates; among others; and
has soon become a rising porn star.</P>
<P>"Boogie Nights" takes place in the 70s, during a time when porn was
still made for film presentation, and when the artists cared enough to
include a story of sorts, or at least a couple hints of a plot (i.e.
"Emmanuel" and its numerous incarnations, and "Deep Throat," and ITS
numerous incarnations).  Jack himself states that his dream is to make a
porn that will keep the jack-offs in the seats even after they've jacked
off.  This is basically a parallel to fame: after the initial
breakthrough, something or someone looses the interest, and the quality
begins to wane.  That is, unless you're Martin Scorsese.</P>
<P>The film brings all the together in a flashy, almost orgasmic style,
luring us into their world, then watching as it tragically collapses.  I
mean, the story is set up a lot like Scorsese's "Goodfellas," that is,
of course, without the voice-over narration.  The film starts out
introducing us to a wide variety of characters, then brings them
together, then seperates them over the course of the film, as they all
deal with fame and numerous other problems, mostly incarnations of the
fame.</P>
<P>Among the several characters we meet in this ensemble cast are: Buck
Swope (Don Cheadle), an actual actor and very kind person who takes the
porn job to pay money, and who hopes to one day open a Hi-Fi shop of his
own so he can sell stereos (and 8-tracks); Reed Rothchild (John C.
Reilly), another porn star who becomes bosum buddies with Dirk, and ends
up being his a kind of more intelligent side kick of sorts, even though
he's only a hair smarter than Dirk; Scotty (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a
gay and very neurotic boom mike operator and other mechanical things
worker, who kinda has a thing for Dirk (nudge nudge); and Little Bill
(William H. Macy), a behind-the-scenes worker who doesn't seem very
comfortable with his job, especially since his nymphomaniac wife (porn
star Nina Hartley) is always having sex (well, whenever we see her,
which means that this is one of the only women whose name I know that I
have never seen with clothes on).</P>
<P>We also have the management, including a man named The Colonel (Robert
Ridgely), who has a little secret...; and Floyd Gandolli (Philip Baker
Hall), as a man who shows up on the cusp of the decade, with the
foreboding news of the death of porn "film" and the birth of porn
"video," which would bring about the demise of the former.</P>
<P>The acting by all of them is incredible, with no one really sticking
out, which is perfect since this is an ensemble film.  But notable
performances go to Jullianne Moore (big surprise here), the underrated
John C. Reilly (who is a great scene-stealer), Don Cheadle (for giving
one of the most sympathetic and human performances), Heather Graham, and
of course, Burt Reynolds, who gives what may be the performance of his
career.  And Mark Wahlberg is awesome as the lead role.  Who knew Marky
Mark could act?  Except for those of you who saw "The Basketball
Diaries."</P>
<P>While all the actors give stunning performances, the real star of this
film is without a doubt the Paul Thomas Anderson, writer and director
extraordinaire.  He brings us a hysterically funny, and incredibly
dramatic story, which engulfs us into its story, and holds our undivided
attention for the full two and a half hours.  Like "Goodfellas," there
is never a dull moment, and the story never fails to generate interest. 
I was shocked how this film didn't run out of steam for the full time. 
Not many directors can do that. </P>
<P>And the film is very funny, with several great scenes throughout that
are laugh-out-loud hilarious.  But, structured in the way it is, it's
mostly funny in the beginning, and gradually what was funny becomes
tragic and sad.  Take the whole Little Bill subplot, for instance, as
well as the whole Scotty spiel.</P>
<P>As far as direction, Anderson has an amazing flair for style, with lots
of steadicams, great zooms, tricky camerawork, and close-ups at the
perfect time.  He also has a great knack for picking the perfect music
or song to accompany a scene, with notable uses of "Mama Told Me Not To
Come" (hee hee, I said "come") during an introductory steadicam shot,
and the 80s classic "99 Luff Balloons" during a tense scene of
violence.  It's almost kinda like deja vu...that's because it's a lot
like that of Scorsese!  As I said, this is a lot like "Goodfellas"
story, theme, and structure-wise.  But also directing wise.  Some could
call him a "hack," but one has to realize that to pull it off so
perfectly is pure genius.  There's a reason Scorsese is so lauded by us
film geeks: part of it is because he's so original; the other is because
every frame and shot is choreographed to get the maximum effect for each
scene.  And Anderson knows damn well how to do this, so even if it
originated with Scorsese, you still have to respect Anderson a lot.</P>
<P>Besides, this film starts out as a homage, but just when it seems to
head into pure rip-off, it luckily steers towards parody (accentuated
with a hilarious scene based on the final scene of "Raging Bull").</P>
<P>I want to make a litte side-note about a great scene towards the end
during a little drug deal, which is one of the most tense scenes I've
seen in awhile.  With the potential of a bloodbath, bringing out the
impending death of three of the characters in this film, Anderson gives
the scene every kind of potential fear: loud, annoying music; a
drugged-up buyer; a large bodyguard with a gun; and to top that off, a
little boy in the house setting off those annoying-as-hell sounds that
sound distinctly like shots.  There are a couple things going on during
this sequence too, each tense in its own way.  I just wanted to point
that out, since it's one of the film's strongpoints.</P>
<P>I was blown away by "Boogie Nights," and the world it brings out so
garishly.  The whole film is amazing in bringing out the world of the
late 70s and early 80s, especially in such a mircrocosm.  Of all the
films I've seen so far this year, this is the best I have seen.  And of
all the new directors to arrive as of late, Paul Thomas Anderson will
probably get my vote for the best.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ****</PRE>
