<PRE>REMEMBER THE TITANS</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * *</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Boaz Yakin
Written by: Gregory Allen Howard</PRE>
<P>In the early '70s, a school in Alexandria, Virginia has just become 
integrated. That means an all black school and an all white school have 
combined and tempers are flying through the roof. Coach Boone (Denzel 
Washington) has been chosen to lead this new school's football team, 
replacing long-time and much loved Coach Yoast (Will Patton). Yoast will go 
on to become Boone's assistant coach and defensive coordinator, but that 
doesn't please him too much. Nevertheless, the two coaches decide to take 
all the prospective players out to training camp in preparation for the 
coming season. Obviously, the two races don't get along too well at first. 
Boone runs the camp like a drill sergeant, and forces players of different 
races to spend time together. The players don't react well at first, but 
slowly come together as the team's captain, Greg Bertier (Ryan Hurst), and 
his new friend Julius (Wood Harris) set an example. Camp ends, the players 
have all become friends, but can their friendship survive when they return 
to town and find nothing there has changed at all?</P>
<P>What is the most powerful force in a Hollywood movie? Love? Of course not, 
that's not a strong enough emotion for Hollywood. Hatred? A case could be 
made, but I don't think so. Possibly tragedy? Nope. No, the correct answer 
is schmaltz. Schmaltz so strong it tugs at the heartstrings of audiences 
everywhere and brings tears to the eyes of the most jaded film critics 
amongst us (well, except me, but I don't think I have tear ducts). You know 
the stuff I'm talking about. I'm talking about dramatic music pounding in 
your ears while statements about family and friendship are proudly brought 
to the screen. I'm talking about the sort of thing Producer Jerry 
Bruckheimer ("Con Air") is a master of. Make no mistake, "Remember the 
Titans" isn't a football movie (unfortunately), because we see very little 
actual football. It's not even yet another statement about racism 
(fortunately). It's a Jerry Bruckheimer movie, through and through. If you 
don't like having your emotions manipulated to the point where you're ready 
to cry rape, avoid the film. If, on the other hand, you're the kind of 
person who cried a river at "Armageddon", you probably don't need me to tell 
you that you should see this movie.</P>
<P>"Remember the Titans" does have one thing working strongly in its favor: the 
cast. Denzel Washington ("The Hurricane") leads the way, doing a great 
impersonation of George C. Scott impersonating General George S. Patton. 
Yes, Washington overdoes it at times, but during the film's rare quiet 
moments (a scene where he's reviewing plays with Yoast's daughter), he does 
an admirable job showing a man with two very different sides. Will Patton 
("Armageddon") has grown on me more and more with every film I've seen him 
in, and he continues this trend in "Remember the Titans". Patton underplays 
the role, which is a nice foil to Washington's occasional grandstanding. The 
other three stand-outs are nine year old Hayden Panettiere ("A Bug's Life") 
as Yoast's daughter; Wood Harris ("The Siege") as Julius; and the comical 
Ethan Suplee ("Road Trip") as Lastik, the only player who doesn't care one 
bit about race. Ryan Hurst ("Patch Adams") does an adequate job, but nothing 
special. The remaining cast members all do fine jobs, particularly 
considering the often painful dialogue they're given. One of my favorite 
lines was: "We aren't going to let anything, NOTHING, come between us! We're 
a team!" Ouch.</P>
<P>Only in a Jerry Bruckheimer movie could the problems of race relations be 
solved as easily as they are here. It turns out that all young people of 
different races need is to be yelled at by a drill sergeant, football coach, 
or whatever suitable authority figure might be handy. You think I'm joking, 
don't you? I wish I were, but the fact is, this is the sort of world 
Bruckheimer shows us in "Remember the Titans". I say Bruckheimer gives us 
these things, even those he's not the director. That's because Bruckheimer's 
legion of directors all direct in the exact same way (I've given up trying 
to tell them apart). Boaz Yakin (Ack, he wrote "The Punisher" back '89. 
How's that for a film credit?) is no exception, directing like all good 
Bruckheimer boys do. In other words, the film is frantically shot and 
chaotically choreographed, but it still manages to be quite dull. That's 
really all "Remember the Titans" is at its core: loud, frantic, predictable, 
and boring. Take the final game for example (oh come on, you knew in your 
heart it was all going to come down to a final game). It's loud, with 
players rushing about and yelling to the point where we can't understand 
anything; it's frantic, so much so in fact that I couldn't follow any of the 
action on the field; it's predictable because you know well in advance how 
it's going to end; and it's boring because we really see only a minute at 
the half, a minute in the locker room, and a minute at the end of the game. 
A game can't be interesting if we only see little bits and pieces of it.</P>
<P>So other than the acting, is there anything good about "Remember the 
Titans"? I suppose it depends on who you are. Being the cynical, hard-nosed 
critic I am, I don't get much enjoyment out of movies so predictable I've 
figured the ending out before the movie starts. If you like predictable, 
feel good movies you'll probably find more to like here than I did (that 
shouldn't be too hard). One last thing I want to note is the score, by 
composer Trevor Rabin ("Armageddon"). Rabin is a long time collaborator with 
Bruckheimer, and it's little surprise since the man is a master of dramatic 
music. Everything he composes swells to epic proportions at just the right 
moments. Take a scene where, uh, well every scene in the movie actually. 
Washington makes a dramatic speech (like his painfully bad one at 
Gettysburg); the camera pans slowly over the awed faces of his students; the 
camera flashes to the sun shining through dark clouds; the music swells high 
and our spirits are meant to soar. I, meanwhile, am rapidly jotting down 
notes about feelings of nausea sweeping over me. "Remember the Titans" runs 
far too long at 113 minutes. I'd recommend it to fans of cheesy, 
predictable, dramatic movies; or to any avid Bruckheimer devotees, and give 
it two and a half out of five stars.</P>
