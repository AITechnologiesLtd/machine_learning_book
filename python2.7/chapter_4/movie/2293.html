<PRE>                        GERONIMO: AN AMERICAN LEGEND
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1993 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  In spite of the presence of Gene
     Hackman and Robert Duvall, this is a bland telling of
     Geronimo's last uprising.  While all the major characters
     were real people, there are major lapses in historical
     accuracy.  At least it does not fall into the trap of making
     the Indians all saints and military all bad.  Rating +1 (-4
     to +4).</PRE>
<P>     I think that the most positive thing I can say about GERONIMO is that
it trusts the viewer.  It shows historical events and it trusts the audience
to make the right decision about who was right and who was wrong.  That
sounds like a small thing, but it was more than you got from films like
DANCES WITH WOLVES, THUNDERHEART, or, on another continent, GANDHI.  So
often when a film shows the old establishment as wrong, it shows everybody
who sided with or worked for that establishment as being totally
reprehensible.  I doubt that anybody can see GERONIMO and not come away with
the belief that a great injustice was done to the Chiricahua Apache.  But
many of the whites in this film are compassionate toward the Indians.  And
not all of the Indians agree with each other about their relations with the
whites.  Most of the people in this film are a bit bewildered about what is
happening and are ambivalent about United States Government policies toward
Indians.  As an example, Robert Duvall as an army scout professes his hatred
of the Indian in the early parts of the film, but it becomes clear later in
the film that underneath the surface he respects Indians and is also
indignant over injustices done to them.  While other aspects of this film
are not so well handled, the complexity of characters is a change from the
pre-digested Political Correctness we often see in films of this sort.
However, the film does twist facts to make it a more salable quantity.</P>
<P>     The story, as narrated by Lt. Britton Davis (Matt Damon) is not a full
biography of Geronimo, but only covers about five years and Geronimo's last
uprising, 1881-1886.  At the beginning of the film Geronimo (Wes Studi) is
already a living legend, but he now wants peace and is willing to turn
himself over to the cavalry and settle into life at the reservation.  But
when an Indian holy man is killed in the incident at Cibicue Creek that led
to a battle killing several whites, Geronimo (who is present at the
incident) decides to break his agreement and head for Mexico.  The film
covers two expeditions to apprehend Geronimo and his final surrender.</P>
<P>     A major component of this film is the beautiful near-desert vistas that
serve as a backdrop of many of the scenes.  Here also you should take what
you are seeing with a grain of salt.  The actual terrain over which Geronimo
ranged, particularly around Tombstone, Fort Thomas, and Fort Bowie does not
look at all as majestic with few of the buttes and other rock formations
that we see with most of this film.  You find those a little further north
in Monument Valley and in Utah, the latter being where the exteriors were
filmed.  Real "Geronimo territory" is flat or hilly with sand and scrub.</P>
<P>     The film is based on a story by John Milius, who also co-authored the
script, and that leaves some latitude for fictionalizing.  While the film is
supposedly narrated by Davis, it is clearly not based on or even consistent
with the real Britton Davis' book about these incidents, THE TRUTH ABOUT
GERONIMO.  Do not take much of this film as actual history.  Geronimo was no
place near the Cibicue Creek battle.  In real life the incident happened
mostly to White Mountain Apaches, though there were a few Chiricahuas
present at the time.  The two different tribes of the Apache nation did not
even like each other more often than not.  Chiricahuas did not get on well
with Jicarilla Apaches, Mescalero Apaches, or White Mountain Apaches.
Geronimo's breakout was only very indirectly related to the battle of
Cibicue Creek.  Following Cibicue there was a large buildup in white
military force in the area and this buildup of power is probably what
frightened Geronimo off the reservation about a month later.  Britton Davis
greatly respects Geronimo in the film, while the real Davis called Geronimo
"a thoroughly vicious, intractable, and treacherous man."  He also called
the Apaches "wild, intractable, and resentful of restraint."  In that book
the real Davis had a different point of view both on the campaign against
Geronimo and on the warrior himself.  Also Davis did not go into Mexico
under the command of Miles, as it is shown in the film, and did not
participate in the final surrender of Geronimo.  If truth be known, other
tribes and even other Apaches considered Geronimo a loose cannon and an
uncontrollable terrorist.  His campaign against the whites probably put him
on the side of some justice, but not for what anyone would really consider
the right reasons.  As for Britton Davis resigning the army in indignation
over its policies against the Indians, that too is total invention.  Davis
resigned because he got a better job offer and did not like army life.  So
much of this film really is a very inaccurate account of what took place in
history, even if it does cover many real events and characters.  This is a
very distorted view to make history seem to support the Millius' wishful
interpretation.</P>
<P>     GERONIMO suffers a great deal by comparison to the recent GETTYSBURG.
GERONIMO's history is not nearly as accurate and at the same time
GETTYSBURG's characters were a good deal more interesting.  The lead is
Jason Patric as Lt. Charles Gatewood.  Patric is a good deal too handsome
and is not nearly as formal-looking or gaunt as the real Gatewood.  And he
lacks the real Gatewood's thick moustache.  The film wants you to sympathize
with his point of view, and has chosen to make him heart-throb handsome
rather than to go the extra step to make him look like the real Gatewood's
photographs.  But Patric is pretty good at horsemanship.  Gene Hackman also
fails to capture the look of his character.  General Crook wore a bushy
forked beard that gave the impression of one full beard going off to the
right and one to the left.  Director Walter Hill probably decided that the
real beard would upstage the actor.  Under Hill's flat direction, only Studi
seems to project any screen presence at all.  The historic Geronimo had a
perpetual scowl on his face and Studi is one of the few Indian actors who
really looks the part.  Ry Cooder's score, using Indian themes, may conjure
up an emotional response in people who know more about Indian music than I
do, but for me it conveyed very little of the feeling that was called for.</P>
<P>     GERONIMO: AN AMERICAN LEGEND is generally accurate to history while
still twisting events to support a predetermined set of conclusions.  It is
more fair to both sides than it might have been, but it still is a
lackluster piece of storytelling.  I give it a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
