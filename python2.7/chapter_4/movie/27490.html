<P>   How do you feel about the prospect of retirement?  Are you
counting the days till you get away from your desk, free to
roam the world or simply head up to your favorite stream to
see how they're biting?  Or is your identity tied up so much
with your work that you dread the thought of giving it up? 
Sean Penn's sometimes lethargic but ultimately moving and
lyrical "The Pledge" focusses on a police detective faced with
these existential questions on the last day of his job.
Considered one of the greats by his buddies on the Reno
force, he is popular enough with his colleagues that he gets a
slam-bang sendoff party on the day he is to call it quits.  In
the role of Detective Jerry Black, Jack Nicholson looks out
the window and sees a man hobbling forward on a walker. 
He visits a nursing home only to find elderly men and women
hooked to breathing devices or being aided to their seats.  He
is haunted by a vision that his real life is over on the day he
hangs up his bulletproof vest.  To add to his misery, he takes
a sacred pledge thrust on him by the crucifix-carrying
Margaret Larsen (Patricia Clarkson), mother of an eight-year-
old girl who has just been found slashed and mutilated in the
snows of Nevada, a promise that he will not give up until he
finds the perpetrator of this loathsome act.</P>
<P>   "The Pledge" is too phlegmatically paced to be of much
interest to the crowd whose idea of a police drama is the
"Lethal Weapon" series or who wonder whether any current
movie can be even called a cop story without the presence of
David Morse.  But Penn's latest outing as a helmer would be
pursued by fans of his similar achievements, his moody 1991
movie "The Indian Runner," about a man's attempts to get
closer to his kid brother who had jsut returned from the 'nam,
and his more recent incursion into the killing fields, "The
Crossing Guard," about an individual's attempt to deal with
the drunk-driving death of his daughter at the hands of a perp
who had just been released from prison.</P>
<P>   Somber but by no means lifeless, "The Pledge" is a piece
about a just-retired detective so driven by his commitment
that the book by the Swiss writer Frederick Durrenmatt
(whose great drama "The Visit" is one of the most
imaginative and compelling stage works of its decade) is
virtually without humor.  Adapted to the screen by Jerzy
Kromolowski and his wife Mary Olson-Kromolowski, "The
Pledge" is a framed story opening on a bizarre sequence that
could have come from a post-lobotomy "All Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest," then cutting between the grisly discovery of a
girl's mutilated body and the joyful occasion of a popular
detective's retirement bash.  When a retarded Indian, Toby
Jay Wadenah (Benicio Del Toro) confesses to the crime at
the clever promptings of Detective Stan Krolak (Aaron
Eckhart), the case is closed.  But Jerry Black must have
thought that Wadenah had watched Stephen Hopkins's
"Under Suspicion" once too often and persuades chief of
detectives Eric Pollack (Sam Shepard) to reopen the case.  </P>
<P>   Acting as a one-man squad who has dedicated his first
year of retirement to solving the murder, he interviews a
plethora of Nevadans such as the murdered girl's mother,
Margaret (Patricia Clarkson), grandmother Annalise (Vanessa
Redgrave), and the father of a girl similarly slain, Jim Olstand
(Mickey Rourke).  He is himself interviewed by a doctor
(Helen Mirren) who catches some negative vibes from the
detective and wonders whether he has become unbalanced
by the search for a killer.  When he discovers a waitress in
the Nevada boonies, Lori (Robin Wright Penn) whose
daughter is similar in age, hair color, and clothing to the ones
who have been killed before in a similar style, he buys a gas
station and settles in as a resident in Lori's backwater
community.</P>
<P>   Penn's film is a psychological study in obsession, a man's
fixation on a single goal which, if affording no closure, could
result in his turning from a top-level detective into a deranged
and perhaps dangerous fellow.  Willing to stop at nothing to
solve the case, even using a lovely eight-year-old girl,
Chrissy (Pauline Roberts) as bait without her mother's
consent, Jerry conveys what could happen to any of us given
the appropriate circumstances.  A tribute to Penn and to his
top-notch ensemble of actors, "The Pledge" breaks with the
conventions of the cop dramas by featuring no explosions
either verbal or chemical.  The Canadian snows filmed by
cameraman Chris Menges look both inviting and threatening
while Jay Cassidy's editing and Hans Zimmer's violin-
dominated soundtrack are unassuming.  </P>
<P>   Absolutely not for all tastes, "The Pledges" is lyrical,
convincing, and an obvious labor of love for Penn and his
stellar group of performers.</P>
