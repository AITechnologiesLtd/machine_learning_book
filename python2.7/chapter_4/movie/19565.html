A Civil Action</PRE>
<PRE>A Review</PRE>
<PRE>By Jeremiah Rickert</PRE>
<P>Starring: John Travolta, Robert Duvall, Kathleen Quinlan, William H. Macy,
Tony Shaloub, John Lithgow.</P>
<PRE>Directed by: Steven Zaillian</PRE>
<PRE>Synopsis:</PRE>
<P>     Successful and arrogant lawyer Jan Schlichtmann (John Travolta) seems
poised to refuse to pursue the case of eight families, whose children died
apparently as the result of pollution, only to discover that the culprits'
companies are owned by a multi-million dollar conglomerate.  Seeing dollar
signs before his eyes, he puts himself and his law firm wholeheartedly
into the task.  He is so convinced he will
win that he eventually bankrupts his firm, and his partners seeking a
gigantic settlement.  His motivations and ego are put to the test by a
grizzled, but cunning lawyer played by five-time oscar-nominated actor
Robert Duvall (Godfather, Deep Impact, The Apostle), and by the parents of
the dead children, one of whom, played by Kathleen Quinlan (Apolla 13,
Breakdown) only wants an apology.  </P>
<P>     Our first scene with Jan shows him representing the case of a man who
will have to live his life in a wheelchair.  One by one he helps the
crippled man do all of the simple things that
most people take for granted; drink some water, wipe his mouth, all in
plain sight of the jury.  This act convinces the defense team to settle
for 25 million.  When the judge in the latter case, played by John Lithgow
(3rd Rock from the Sun,
Buckaroo Banzai) grants the defense motion to keep the victims' parents
from testifying, Schlichtmann's biggest weapon is taken away from him,
he's forced to rely on facts, and thus begins his desperation to win this
case.</P>
<P>     The film would have you believe that Schlichtmann starts out as an
ambulance chasing over-paid court-room pirate, and by the end, he is a
humbled by his defeat and now understands the moral side of his job.
However, I was not convinced that
he goes through such a change.  Perhaps it is just Travolta's natural
aura, but I found myself unable to subscribe to his humility.  In a way,
he is becoming a sort of Kevin Costner-esque actor.  No matter what part
he is playing, you can't
seem to ignore the fact that its Kevin Costner.  Sometimes this is all
right (Untouchables) and sometimes this is inane (Robin Hood: Prince of
Thieves).  Travolta as a drugged out hit man (Pulp Fiction) worked for me,
Travolta as (take your pick) a super-cop (Face Off) and a Lawyer (A Civil
Action) just doesn't allow him to quash the image that is naturally
associated with the name John Travolta.  Besides, who can't look at that
big face and small blue eyes and not think Chewbacca?</P>
<P>     Robert Duvall plays Jerome Facher, the wizend lawyer who defends one
of the MNC's.  He is also a professor of law and there are snippets of him
teaching his class all of the courtroom "don'ts" just as Jan is committing
them. Duvall seems to fall into what amounts to a "Matlock" sort of
crotchety-old-wisdom routine.  His talents seemed a bit wasted.  Having
recently seen the Apostle, I kept waiting for him to show some of that
intensity, but alas, it never came.</P>
<P>     There is a top-notch supporting cast that doesn't have much to do
other than to be a Greek chorus of warnings to Jan and his ego-crusade.
William H. Macy (Fargo, Air Force One) and Tony Shaloub (Wings, The Siege)
are Jan's partners and they incessantly remind him of the realities of
what he is doing, but he thinks he is indestructable, and in that obvious
hubris, he finds his downfall. The talented actors are as wasted here as
Robert Duvall was.</P>
<P>     Casting choices aside, the script doesn't do much to convince the
viewer that Jan has gone through some change either.  Adapted for the
screen by director Steven Zaillian from the book by Johnathan Harr, it is
quite ambiguous whether Jan's motivation is justice or the replenshing of
his depleted bank accounts.  Is he fighting for those grieving parents, or
his he fighting for his survival as a lawyer? that question is never
clearly answered.  </P>
<P>     The advertising associated with this film misleads you into thinking
he goes through this change of heart, where dollar signs don't matter as
much as redeemed lives, but when you see the clips from the trailer in
context, that message simply isn't there. </P>
<P>     Zaillian who also directed last year's Amistad, again crafts a film
that wants to be about a larger issue, one that is settled finally in a
courtroom, but doesn't take place exclusively as other films in the genre
have.  In this post-OJ trail culture, people aren't necessarily thrilled
by courtroom antics anymore, especially ones that in the wake of the hours
and hours of procedure, paperwork, cross-examination, and redirects of
that trial, make the Hollywood version seem, well, glamorized, more like a
gladiator fight than the esteemed pinnacle of culture that our system is.</P>
<P>      This film avoids the courtroom for the most part, focusing on the
whirlwind surrounding the trial.  For that I believe that Zaillian
deserves some kudos. The film is a little on the long side, in pace if not
minutes, padded with far too many gratuitous shots of either running water
or glasses of water, or people sipping water. I wanted to shout "all right
we get the picture!" but managed to restrain myself.</P>
<P>     The film has an epilogue of the now virtually penniless Jan
Schlichtmann soliciting some mystery group to take up the case of the
poisoned water and what seemed like five minutes of text on the screen
telling us what all happened in the end, something I won't spoil here.
Twice, however, just when you think the film is over, it keeps going and
going, finally clocking in a just under 2hrs...but what long hours they
seemed, and even a Hollywood ending would have been better than reading
paragraphs of exposition.</P>
<P>     Overall, I found the flim to underlit and overlong, with fairly
weakly drawn characters and an overabundance of water metaphors.  Of the
$4 economy time that I paid for this film, it was worth $1.</P>
