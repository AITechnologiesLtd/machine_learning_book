<PRE>Review:                ANYWHERE BUT HERE</PRE>
<PRE>Review by:        Joy Wyse the SILVER Screen Critic</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:        Susan Sarandon, Natalie Portman</PRE>
<PRE>Director:        Wayne Wang</PRE>
<P>        Anywhere But Here certainly qualifies as a chick flick.  I doubt that
guys can relate to the main characters.  Susan Sarandon and Natalie
Portman portray Adele and Ann August, mother and daughter living through a
very difficult age, the three years from Ann's 14th. Birthday, until she
heads for college at 17.
        If you're a mother you can identify with all the frustrations that Adele
faces.  She sincerely wants what's best for Ann, although Ann doesn't want
it…at the time.  As a typical teen Ann wants her privacy and her
independence, and most of all, she doesn't want to be `embarrassed' by her
mother.  It's difficult for a parent not to embarrass a child.  Either you
dress too drab or too flashy. You're too protective, or you don't care
enough.  That's the basic storyline of Anywhere But Here; mother and
daughter learning to accept each other.  Strangely, their most profound
advisor is a traffic cop.
        Most of the other characters are little more than vignettes but each and
every one is delivered with believability.
        I particularly liked the reference made to grunion hunting.  Yes, there
really is such a thing.  We aren't talking about Snipe hunting or
submarine races.  Some of my fondest childhood memories are the nights
that my family went grunion hunting.  This is a sport limited to the
beaches of Southern California.  During the summer, when there's a full
moon, the grunions spawn on the beaches.  They come in on one wave, spin
into the sand on their tails laying their eggs, and go out with the next
wave.  The trick is to catch them with your hands in between the two waves
without being knocked down by the waves yourself.  Warning!  They are very
slippery.  If you ever have the chance, try it.  As for the movie, you can
try it, too.  It's not bad, but it's not that special.  Because of the
acting, I give it a B.  It wouldn't bother me to see it again, but if I
don't…no big deal.</P>
