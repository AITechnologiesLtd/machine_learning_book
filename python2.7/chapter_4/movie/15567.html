<PRE>                    A SIMPLE PLAN ***½ (out of four)
                       -a review by Bill Chambers
              ('Tis the season to visit FILM FREAK CENTRAL:
       <A HREF="http://filmfreakcentral.net">http://filmfreakcentral.net</A>  Or my name isn't Santa Claus)</PRE>
<PRE> starring Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton, Bridget Fonda, Brent Briscoe
            screenplay by Scott B. Smith, based on his novel
                          directed by Sam Raimi</PRE>
<P>Scott Smith's novel A Simple Plan was overrated, a humourless
modern-day, snowbound gloss on "Macbeth" with an unsatisfying ending.
How surprising it is, then, that Smith's own screenplay adaptation of
the same material is a rich and emotional modern-day, snowbound gloss on
"Macbeth". Raimi, creator of such frenetic cult films as Evil Dead, Evil
Dead 2, and Darkman, strapped himself in a strait-jacket to direct A
Simple Plan, a leisurely-paced thriller that has much in common with
friend Joel Coen's restrained Fargo.</P>
<P>It is a quiet winter in a small Midwestern town. Lou (Briscoe) and
brothers Hank (Paxton) and Jacob (Thornton) Mitchell happen upon a
crashed airplane during a hunting trip. The pilot is already a feast for
the vultures, and a bag of money sits unclaimed on the floor beside him.
The three men decide to take the money-$4.4 million-and keep their
discovery a secret; they will split the money only after the spring
thaw, once the plane is recovered by authorities and any inquiries about
the money have been dismissed. The trouble is, Jacob and Lou are close
to destitute and willing to break the pact, and Hank's own very pregnant
and very greedy wife (Fonda) finds out about the loot, too.</P>
<P>Even if you've read the book, A Simple Plan offers many surprises. (The
movie's climax is much stronger.) An obvious and tired maguffin, the old
briefcase full of money routine, seems fresh and original here. That's
because this time out, the people who after the dough are genuine
sympathetic sadsacks-candidates for an episode of Springer. Danny
Boyle's Shallow Grave featured a similar set-up (albeit within the cosy
confines of a London flat), but his characters were morally bankrupt
from the get-go-they mistreated each other out of pure, undiluted
avarice. A Simple Plan's trio of thieves lead generally miserable lives;
if they can get past their initial hunger for the cash, they might just
have a chance at saving themselves from a life of disconsolation.</P>
<P>I give: the best reason to see A Simple Plan is the performance of Billy
Bob "Sling Blade" Thornton as the anemic, tormented Jacob. For about the
first third of the film, a goofy-looking Thornton functions as little
more than a punchline, cinematic punctuation to get a laugh from the
audience. Yet as the plot thickens, Thornton comes to life in one of the
most memorable supporting performances in recent years; gradually,
Thornton peels back the layers, and we get the sense that Jacob is the
less-educated but clearly smarter of the siblings. Watch the sequence
when Jacob begins to imitate Hank, mercilessly insulting him in the
process; his motivation for doing so is eventually made clear, but
Thornton never once ‘winks' at the audience. I haven't believed a
character like this in a good long while.</P>
<P>Actually, Raimi yields terrific work from all his principals, and his
directorial presence is felt, if not explicitly seen (with the exception
of one gleefully gratuitous, totally shocking signature camera move). I
mentioned earlier that it recalls Fargo, and I mean in spirit, not in
tone. Both films are dark-hearted, and they share a love of the locale;
Rami's film is (surprisingly) much less jokey and less satirical. (I
loved Fargo, but it's more witty than moving.) A Simple Plan is a
less-than-mainstream suspense movie that really pays off on its
promises. Its bleakness is uninviting but worth the trek to the theatre.</P>
