<P>Imagine LOVE STORY meets ABC's DHARMA & GREG, and you'll know all you
need to know about SWEET NOVEMBER.  Literally.</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Nelson Moss (Keanu Reeves) is a high-strung, highly successful
advertising executive with no time for a life outside of his job, much
to the dismay of his constantly ignored girlfriend Angelica (Lauren
Graham).  But Nelson's life quickly changes when, after he causes Sara
Deever (Charlize Theron) to flunk her DMV exam, she storms into his life
in a big way.  Like a whirlwind gone mad, Sara goes on a mission to
"save" the stodgy Nelson from himself, by proposing that, for the whole
month of November, he stays with her and in exchange, she'll "help him".
How, and why, is for Nelson to discover in what Sara promises to be a
magical thirty days.</P>
<P>The Upshot (2nd WARNING: **EVEN MORE spoilers contained below**):
KeanuNuts, y'all might as well get your brickbats out now, 'cuz I tell
ya, he stunk up the joint.  Whoever decided to call it "Sweet" wasn't
quite descriptive enough.  "Sickly sweet"...now that's more like it.</P>
<P>I don't know what was worse: the *absolutely, positively mindboggling*
[in case the KeanuDroids didn't hear me the first time] miscasting of
Keanu "whoa" Reeves, or the complete repulsion I felt in noting Greg
Germann's irritating presence in not one, but *two* lame remake flicks
this weekend ("November" and the equally dreadful DOWN TO EARTH).  That,
and the syrupy sweetness of the general storyline.  Holy Chris on a pogo
stick, I think I developed a severe case of sugar diabetes just watching
this thing.</P>
<P>Two things saved "November" from my
"this-must-die-an-excruciatingly-horrible-death" redlight rating: the
first is my inexplicable liking for things Charlize Theron; must be her
eyes (what can I say; they mesmerize me) and the button cuteness her
character showed up to the **BEGIN BIG SPOILER** first Obligatory
Illness Scene - each moment after which, was sheer torture for me to
witness, in anticipation of LOVE STORY, BRIAN'S SONG, and STUPORNOVA,
all rolled up into one smarmy little ball. **END BIG SPOILER**</P>
<P>The other little slice of heaven hiding in "November's" Deep Dish Of
Hell, was Frank Langella as Edgar Price (who, keeping with the DHARMA &
GREG/ABC theme, is "November's" version of Miles Drentell from ONCE &
AGAIN and thirtysomething - if Miles Drentell had an Evil Twin Brother).
For the few moments he was on screen, Langella portrayed a totally
heartless businessman with an originality worthy of adoration; had his
role been expanded, "November" would've been a *much* different movie
experience for me.  My jury's out whether that would've wound up A Good
Thing, though; I have the feeling that more Edgar Price would've
amounted to that much more artificial sweetener being poured on to
counterbalance his Pure Evol.  And _that_ would most def be A Bad Thing.</P>
<P>Sorry, that's it as far as worthwhile characters/storylines go.  I've
seen the "Hip Gay/TV Friend" done better before, so Jason Isaacs' turn
as Transvestite Chas, didn't really Take Me There; and Liam Aiken as
Abner, the boy searching for a Father Figure, was kinda creepy.  That
leaves us with the aforementioned irritant Greg Germann as Nelson's
sycophant business partner Vince, and my friend and yours, the K Man
himself.  So as not to taunt the KeanuWorshippers overmuch, I won't go
into vast detail of the many times I wanted to rip his lungs out and
serve them to Hannibal Lecter, just so his GOTdam agent wouldn't dare
stain the silver screen again by allowing him to be so terribly miscast
in a role that, if it were any more past his reach as an actor, he'd
have to hire someone with an extension cord and a ten foot pole, just to
come within a football field's length of touching.</P>
<PRE>[Well, not *too* vast, anyway.]</PRE>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
Not that he needs my approval or anything - I'm fairly sure Mr. Reeves
isn't sitting at home pissing in his beer because some third-rate hack
in Podunkville Called Him Names - but I actually do like Keanu *in roles
in which he plays to the level of his abilities*.  I very much dug him
in THE MATRIX, for example; and he was one of the better things about
the disappointing (and still unreviewed by me) THE GIFT.  But I say now,
and will repeat again: whatever the casting person who thought Reeves
was right for this role, was smoking when they cast him, I don't want
any parts of.</P>
<P>SWEET NOVEMBER (rating: yellowlight):
"Dancing In September"..."Sweet November"...dag, is it Spring yet?!?</P>
