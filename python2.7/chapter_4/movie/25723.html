<P>     He (Richard Gere) is a silver-haired womanizer with nearly a 
half-century under his belt, owner-chef of the kind of trendy New York 
restaurant where salad costs 35 bucks.  She (Wynona Ryder) is an 
adorable pixie-haired gamine of 22, from a Manhattan socialite family 
that can afford that salad.  She makes cute hats out of wire, and has a 
bum ticker.  "Nobody thought I'd last this long," she tells him.  They 
fall in love.  As his best friend (Anthony LaPaglia) points out, "she's 
the perfect woman for you -- young, beautiful, and on the way out."</P>
<P>     She may be young and doomed, but she represents three generations 
of her family: herself, her tough old granny (Elaine Stritch), and her 
mother, now dead, with whom Gere once was in love back in the '70s.  
"She never slept with him," Granny assures her, to eliminate any taint 
of something vaguely incestuous,  "She was too old-fashioned for that."  </P>
<P>     For romantic small talk, he tells her about her mother.  "Her 
favorite singer was Stephen Stills."  She is of course too young to 
remember Stills, which probably explains why she doesn't seem familiar 
with this plot either.</P>
<P>     In the beginning they giggle a lot, and she sasses him with smart 
talk.  "Do you think I'm too old for you?"  "No, I collect antiques."  
By the end, there are a lot of brave smiles, and the smart talk has 
turned poignant.  "You've ruined me for other women."  "No, I've saved 
you for them."</P>
<P>     His womanizing is legend, but she starts right in to devote her few 
remaining mortal months to changing him.  When he boffs an old flame at 
a party, she finds out by putting her hand on his heart to see if he's 
lying (he is).  Boy loses girl.  Boy grovels.  Boy gets another chance.</P>
<P>     Gere and Ryder are both decent actors, but they inhabit separate 
spaces here.  It's not necessarily a generation gap problem, although 
today we're much more sensitive to that than in the days when Audrey 
Hepburn was wooed and won by Bogart (30 years her senior) in Sabrina, 
Cooper (28 years) in Love in the Afternoon, and Grant (25 years) in 
Charade.  It may be no coincidence that Ryder sports a Hepburn look 
here.  Perhaps it's just the lack of chemistry between Ryder and Gere 
that turns everyone against their romance.  "Leave her alone," says 
Stritch.  "She's sick.  She's really sick."  If  she's that close to 
death, what are we saving her from?  At least she'll never have to do 
that tiresome "when I'm fifty he'll be.." math.</P>
<P>     There's nothing really offensive about this retread job except the 
time it wastes.  The director is actress-turned filmmaker Joan Chen, who 
last worked on the Mongolian plains with  Xiu-Xiu, the Sent-Down Girl, 
also about a young girl and an older man.  Chen is 39.  She should be 
old enough to remember Steve Stills, and this plot.</P>
