<PRE>Home Fries
Reviewed by Vince Yim</PRE>
<P>    As the film opens up, expectant unwed mother Sally (played by Drew
Barrymore) encounters her baby's father in a fast food drive-through
window. After he gets his milkshake, he drives off, only to be pursued
by a military helicopter. From this moment forward, you know that this
isn't going to be your run-of-the-mill romantic comedy.</P>
<P>    Home Fries tells the tale of the relationship between Sally and
Dorian (played by Luke Wilson), a helicopter pilot who has a different
kind of connection with Sally...more than he would care to admit (hint:
it has something to do with the father of Sally's unborn child). After
taking a personal (and professional) interest in her, he finds work at
the local fast food restaurant at which she works, and the fun goes on
from there.</P>
<P>    This movie is a lot of fun. It is comedic on two levels, as a
romantic comedy and a dark comedy. The romantic moments are sweet, yet
not sappy. One of the more poignant moments is when Dorian accompanies
Sally to Lamaze classes.</P>
<P>    However, the dark comedic moments are more memorable. This is also a
tale of revenge, and a funny one at that. The father of Sally's unborn
child also happened to be a married man, whose wife is played by
Catherine O'Hara. She does a wonderful portrayal of a jealous wife who
is targeting the person who had an affair, and is not above getting
other people to do her dirty work. (My apologies if this sounds cryptic,
but there is too much of the plot to give away).</P>
<P>    Rounding out the cast are Jake Busey as Angus, Dorian's overzealous
brother and Daryl Mitchell as Roy, Dorian's trainer at the fast food
restaurant. The dialogue is sharp and not filled with sappy overtones,
even with the romantic nature of the plot.</P>
<P>    If there are any complaints, it is over Drew Barrymore's
performance. While she does light up the screen, there are moments when
she doesn't seem all that convincing. The movie was filmed in Texas, and
most of the characters have southern Texan accents. Drew Barrymore's
accent tends to come and go (Luke Wilson doesn't seem to have this
problem). As well, she seems awfully agile for a woman that is eight
months pregnant.</P>
<P>    Still, this movie is one that will please many viewers. With plot
twists galore and hilarious dark moments, this is sure to entertain.</P>
<PRE>Rating: 7.5/10</PRE>
