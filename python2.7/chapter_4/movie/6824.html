<P>The team who brought us 'A Fish Called Wanda' in 1988 re-team for 'Fierce
Creatures.'  There is an old saying in life which is "You can't go home
again."  That was never more true than with the production of 'Fierce
Creatures.' John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline and Michael Palin
return in a film that has nothing to do with 'A Fish Called Wanda' but
perhaps it should have.  A sequel would have been a far more interesting
concept than this plotline.  A multi-billionaire (Kevin Kline) who is truly
a hard edged businessman/rascal employs his son (also played by Kevin
Kline)to travel from Atlanta to merry old England to investigate the
corporate restructuring of a zoo run by a bumbling but well meaning chap
(John Cleese).  Along for the ride is Jamie Lee Curtis to assist in the
investigation and rounding out the cast is Michael Palin as a zoo employee
who is key to the film's bizarre climax.  Putting it plainly, 'Fierce
Creatures' is a disaster not so much because of what it's about but because
it tries to capture the same level of humour as 'A Fish Called Wanda' did.
The personalities of the characters in this movie are similar in nature to
'Wanda' and some of the scenes are downright copycats of that film.  The
jokes and the physical gags are surprisingly flat and the movie is abruptly
immature at the wrong moments and the word that comes to mind to sum it all
up is 'phony'.  Even more preposterous is the fact that it took two men to
direct this farcical mess (Robert Young and Fred Schepisi)and John Cleese is
aided in the screenplay by Iain Johnstone.  Producer Michael Shamberg should
have recognized that this film wouldn't work and even if you've never seen
'A Fish Called Wanda' you still will recognize the flaws that make this
production superficial and self-serving.</P>
