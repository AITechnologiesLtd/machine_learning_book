<PRE>                                DOG PARK
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     It is rare that a great actress (Garofalo) will make two *really*
bad movies, back to back.  It is even rarer that those two movies will
premiere on the same day.  And what are the odds that those two films
will star brothers (eg. Luke Wilson in this movie and Owen Wilson in THE
MINUS MAN)?</P>
<P>     According to my astrologer/numerologist, it's an 18 billion to one
shot.</P>
<P>     And yet it happened here, when two of the worst films to grace the
silver screen have been star-crossed in this conflagration of irony.</P>
<P>     There's very little worth writing about in DOG PARK.  Ex-Kid in the
Hall Bruce McCulloch wrote, directed, and starred in this paean to
canines, where a bunch of singles in what looks like Boston meet around
the local dog park and embark on a romantic affair here and there.
Central to this epic saga are Lorna (Henstridge, looking really bizarre
with a short hairdo) and Andy (Wilson, playing dumb, as he did in HOME
FRIES).  Garofalo and McCulloch make another couple, and various other
people intersect the four romantically, all with very little in the way
of a point or anything funny -- and with *zero* chemistry in the entire
lot.</P>
<P>     As a fan of `Kids in the Hall,' this is quite a disappointment.  Of
course, BRAIN CANDY, McCulloch's other writing credit, wasn't a whole
lot better.  And watch for SUPERSTAR, McCulloch's *next* directorial
outing, next week.</P>
<P>     A couple of one-liners here and there, and a notable supporting
role by McKinney as a dog trainer/psychologist earn DOG PARK its half a
star, but believe me, these 93 minutes feel like an eternity with nary a
laugh to be heard.</P>
<P>     Not convinced yet?  Here's the teaser copy from DOG PARK's Web
site:  `I think Andy starts to fall in love with Lorna when she pukes on
him.'</P>
<PRE>     Enough said.  Woof!</PRE>
