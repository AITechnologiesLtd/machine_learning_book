ALL THE PRETTY HORSES
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>Zzzzzzz.  In ALL THE PRETTY HORSES, directed without an ounce of 
inspiration by Billy Bob Thornton, the title almost says it all.  The 
only possible things to admire in it are all the pretty horses since the 
human actors, with the possible exception of Matt Damon, deliver 
mind-numbingly dreary and lifeless performances.  The horses look 
surprisingly average but, nevertheless, manage to upstage the lethargic 
people in the story.  The handsome Rio Grande, as it carves out the 
canyon between Texas and Mexico, is the only really impressive part of 
the picture.</P>
<P>Ted Tally's thinly plotted and prosaically written script is based on 
Cormac McCarthy's novel.  Going for the poetic, the script instead 
achieves the soporific.  Fully 45 minutes pass before anything of 
consequence happens, and, even then, it is nothing memorable.  This 
might be somewhat tolerable if the actors were able to breathe any 
humanity into their roles, but they read their lines with the emotional 
impact of a teacher calling the roll.</P>
<P>The story, set in 1949, concerns two young Texans, Lacey Rawlins (Henry 
Thomas) and John Grady Cole (Matt Damon), who ride their horses across 
the Mexican border on an adventure.  16-year-old Jimmy Blevins (Lucas 
Black) joins them briefly before getting into some serious trouble for 
alleged horse stealing.  Lacey and John end up at the large ranch of Don 
Hector Rocha (Rubén Blades), where they go to work as cowboys.  </P>
<P>The owner's daughter, Alejandra (Penélope Cruz), is there for the sole 
purpose of providing a brief love interest to the story.  Damon and Cruz 
show absolutely no chemistry whatsoever on the screen, and the beautiful 
Cruz is completely wasted in her part.  The romance between John and 
Alejandra not only doesn't have any sparks, it rarely even smolders.</P>
<P>After Alejandra's aunt warns John, "Here, a woman's reputation is all 
she has," we cut to the young lovers skinny dipping.  But no sooner have 
we hoped that this thread to the story will take off than it is dropped 
like a hot potato.  </P>
<P>In ALL THE PRETTY HORSES, it is hard to know whom to blame more, the 
actors, the director or the screenwriter.  The acting by Henry Thomas 
(E.T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL) would be my choice for the worst part of 
the production.  His lack of energy is so pervasive that it seems to 
suck the life out of those around him.  </P>
<P>Like a candidate facing certain defeat who makes one last campaign swing 
before losing in a landslide, the movie finally tries for a little drama 
at the end.  The problem is that we have long since lost any interest in 
the characters.  Whether they live or die, we no longer care.</P>
<P>ALL THE PRETTY HORSES runs a long 1:57.  It is rated PG-13 for violence 
and some sexuality and would be acceptable for kids around 10 and up.  
Most kids, however, are going to be bored stiff by the picture.</P>
