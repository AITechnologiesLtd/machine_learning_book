MISS CONGENIALITY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Sandra Bullock, as FBI field agent Gracie Hart, is nothing short of 
incredible in MISS CONGENIALITY by director Donald Petrie (MYSTIC 
PIZZA).  With large, messy dollops of self-deprecating humor, Bullock 
makes herself into a real slob.  And then in this Pygmalion story, she 
is transformed into a beauty who is still sometimes a crude klutz no 
matter how glamorous she appears.  Tapping inner reservoirs of comedic 
talent that even her fans probably weren't aware of, Bullock hits every 
joke out of the park like she is Mickey Mantle at a Little League game.  </P>
<P>Since this film is easily Bullock's best since SPEED, one can hope that 
this hilarious charmer won't get buried in an avalanche of holiday 
releases and that moviegoers who aren't in the mood to watch Tom Hanks 
converse with a volleyball will give themselves the holiday treat of 
MISS CONGENIALITY.</P>
<P>When we first meet the feisty Gracie (played when young by Mary Ashleigh 
Green), she is a girl of about 11 who puts up with no guff on the 
playground.  Standing up for the downtrodden and for herself, she slugs 
anyone who doesn't play fair.  Rather than appreciate her spunky 
defenses, kids shun her.  </P>
<P>We cut to the present, in which Gracie (Bullock) has grown up to be a 
"Dirty Harriet" type of agent.  On the bureau's practice mat, she can 
take down any male agent in a heartbeat, but she is a loner and a 
workaholic.</P>
<P>Most lacking in Gracie is any sign of grace.  She approaches eating with 
the finesse of a lioness gnawing on a fresh kill.  Her laughs are 
snorts, and she hasn't a clue as to the purpose of napkins.  The 
side-splittingly funny script by Marc Lawrence (FORCES OF NATURE), Katie 
Ford and Caryn Lucas parcels out sharp lines to everyone, but saves some 
of the best for the story's star.  Although known to love her beer and 
pizza, Gracie's passion runs to the fattening.  "I'm going to get 
chip-faced," she tells her coworker and temporary boss, Eric Matthews 
(Benjamin Bratt, RED PLANET), at a bar as she devours a whole pint of 
Ben and Jerry's ice cream.</P>
<P>In her work, Gracie is known to be a screwup, even if she can run mental 
circles around everyone in her office.  When a serial killer leaves a 
cryptic note threatening violence at the Miss United States Pageant, she 
is asked to go undercover as Miss New Jersey.  Since this is an honor 
she dreamed not of, Gracie initially says, "No way!"  After all, she 
doesn't even own a dress, and she views beauty contestants as pathetic 
airheads.</P>
<P>The pageant's leader (Candice Bergen) and its master of ceremonies 
(William Shatner) can hardly believe their eyes when told that Gracie 
would make a credible undercover contestant.  Slouching in her chair and 
scrunching her mouth, Gracie would appear to be an absolutely hopeless 
candidate for a makeover.  Michael Caine is wonderful as Victor 'Vic' 
Melling, a beauty contest consultant called in to perform a miracle 
transformation.  His version of Professor Henry Higgins and Bullock's 
version of Eliza Doolittle are delightful and original.  Watching Gracie 
stroll down the sidewalk, Vic tells her, "Oh my God, I haven't seen a 
walk like that since JURASSIC PARK!"  After he bans sweets from her 
diet, she keeps trying to smuggle donuts in her bra.</P>
<P>When Gracie Hart is transformed into Gracie Lou Freebush -- a name 
rather like Pussy Galore from GOLDFINGER -- she becomes gorgeous.  In a 
skin-tight, short dress, Gracie looks like a million dollars.  But she's 
still the same Gracie underneath, so she frequently trips in her spiked 
heels and falls flat on her face.  As she views a recording of previous 
awards ceremonies, Gracie mocks the mentally-challenged constants with 
the WIZARD OF OZ line, "If I only had a brain."</P>
<P>Once at the pageant, she makes friends with some of the ditzy dames, 
most notably Miss Rhode Island (Heather Burns, YOU'VE GOT MAIL).  Poor 
Miss Rhode Island can't even answer softball questions.  When asked 
about her favorite date, her reply is not dinner, dancing or any other 
activity but simply "April 25"?</P>
<P>Probably the easily part of a beauty pageant to spoof is the "talent" 
contest.  What is surprising about MISS CONGENIALITY is how they manage 
to come up with humor about the talent contest that is not only funny 
but fresh as well.  Too bad real-life pageants aren't this much fun.  If 
they were, then maybe the World Wrestling Federation might want to form 
a beauty pageant subsidiary.</P>
<P>MISS CONGENIALITY runs 1:40.  It is rated PG-13 for sexual references 
and a scene of violence and would be fine for kids around 9 and up.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 11, laughed hard and often and gave the film *** 
1/2.  He found the movie imaginative, especially the paint scene.  He 
liked the way that Gracie's character develops, and he thought Sandra 
Bullock's acting was great.</P>
