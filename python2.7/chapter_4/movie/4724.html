                       A film review by Michael John Legeros

<P>     Epic historical dramas are so rare, these days, that even the
emotionally-empty RESTORATION may find itself an audience.  There's very
little weight behind this 17th Century story of an English physician
(Robert Downey Jr.) who finds his faith tested by the King (Sam Neill),
a fellow practitioner (David Thewlis), and a mentally-ill commoner (Meg
Ryan).  The running time is a wig's hair under two hours, and yet it
feels like four.  Nobody in Michael Hoffman's film commands any presence,
least of all Downey, who appears in nearly every single scene.  (The Big
Cast also includes Hugh Grant, who, apparently, is now required to 
appear in at least three period pieces per year.  Maybe it's part of his
sentence.) The opulent set design and detailed costumes are about as
exciting as it gets.  Though there's never a shortage of story-- the
plot churns away merrily from the very first scene-- the absence of even
a *single* interesting character turns the title into an apt description
of what most viewers will be attempting with regard to the blood flow to
their buttocks.  Boring. </P>
