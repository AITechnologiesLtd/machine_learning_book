<P> The Emperor's New Groove (2000) 3 stars out of 4. Featuring the vocal
talents of David Spade, John Goodman, Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton.
Story by Chris Williams and Mark Dindal. Screenplay by David Reynolds.
Head of story Stephen Anderson. Music by John Debney. Songs by Sting and
David Hartley. Directed by Mark Dindal. Rated G.</P>
<P> In recent years, with such works as Beauty and the Beast, The Lion
King, The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Tarzan, the Disney animation
unitís work has been spectacular and literary ó high-brow, if you
please.</P>
<P> These features have been just as satisfying for adults as for children.</P>
<P> Now comes The Emperorís New Groove. If the above mentioned titles can
be likened to grand opera, than this newest Disney offering is on the
level of vaudeville.</P>
<P> Don't misconstrue. The Emperorís New Groove is a delightful little
pastiche that lacks the grandeur of its predecessors.</P>
<P> But what it is missing in production values is compensated by its voice
talents.</P>
<P> It must be the true millennium for I am about to do something I never
thought possible ó compliment David Spade.</P>
<P> This annoying little comic actor has, since his days on Saturday Night
Live, made a career out of sarcasm. Mostly, he is grating and annoying.</P>
<P> Yet it is just these qualities (or deficiencies, depending on your
point of view) that make his foray into the wonderful world of Disney
animation so successful.</P>
<P> Spade voices Kuzco, emperor of a mythical mountain kingdom in a
pre-Columbian South America. Kuzco is arrogant, egocentric, spoiled and
selfish, thinking only of his own pleasure.</P>
<P> He treats everyone with contempt and condescension, including his chief
adviser, Yzma (voiced by the legendary Eartha Kitt).</P>
<P> After being fired by Kuzco, the power-hungry Yzma transforms the young
emperor into a llama. The metamorphosed ruler is stranded in the jungle
where his only hope of returning to his palace and regaining his throne
rests with a peasant named Pacha (voiced by John Goodman), whose village
he was about to destroy to make room for his summer palace playground.</P>
<P> Pacha, a good-hearted soul, agrees to help Kuzco if he promises not
raze the village. The devious Kuzco, to whom a promise means nothing,
agrees, of course, and the mismatched pair set out to set things right.</P>
<P> At about 80 minutes, The Emperorís New Groove moves quickly. The
animation, especially the backgrounds, is sketchy. The depth and detail
that went into previous efforts such as Tarzan are wanting, but that is
not much of a drawback since the story is a piece of fluff ó sort of a
fairy tale with a moral for the youngsters.</P>
<P> Of course by the finale, Kuzco is changed back into a human being, has
learned the true meaning of friendship and is a reformed ruler. The only
missing ingredient is Jiminy Cricket singing ìWhen You Wish Upon a
Star.î</P>
<P> I donít believe I am writing these words, but Spade is perfect as the
arrogant emperor you love to hate. He plays his voice like a violin,
making his character one you can despise, but not crossing the line so
that you cannot root for his reformation.</P>
<P> Goodman does well as the honorable peasant, while Kitt is wonderfully
flamboyant and hammy as the evil Yzma.</P>
<P> However, they all pale in comparison to Patrick Warburtonís Kronk,
Yzmaís muscle-bound manservant. If the name doesnít sound familiar,
Warburtonís claim to fame was as Puddy, Elaineís off-again, on-again
boyfriend on TVís Seinfeld.</P>
<P> In The Emperorís New Groove, he steals the film as the somewhat dim,
right-hand man of Yzma. Kronk can and would rather whip up a gourmet
meal or speak to the forest animals in their own language, than do his
masterís evil bidding.</P>
<P> It is a wonderful performance and should lead to bigger and better
roles for this fine comic actor in live-action films.</P>
<P> The filmís songs by Sting are serviceable, but lack the soaring
splendor of The Lion King or Beauty and the Beast.</P>
<P> Overall, The Emperorís New Groove is more a childrenís adventure than
previous Disney outings. But adults shouldnít be dissuaded from giving
it a look-see. It all depends on your David Spade tolerance quotient.</P>
