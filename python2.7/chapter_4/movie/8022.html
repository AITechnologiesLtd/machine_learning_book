<PRE>                                MATILDA
                       A film review by Tim Voon
                        Copyright 1997 Tim Voon</PRE>
<P>Cast: Mara Wilson, Danny DeVito, Rhea Perlman, Embeth Davidtz, Pam
Ferris, Paul Reubens, Tracey Walter Director: Danny DeVito Screenplay:
Nicholas Kazan and Robin Swicord based on the book by Roald Dahl
Cinematography: Stefan Czapsky Music: David Newman</P>
<P>'I'm smart and you're dumb. I'm big and you're small. I'm right and
you're wrong.'</P>
<P>I certainly hope that you don't speak to your children in such a
condescending manner.</P>
<P>Matilda has parents from hell. This bright, intelligent little girl
prefers to read than to watch T.V., has a passionate desire to learn,
and attend school. All of which is strongly discouraged by her parents
who believe a quick buck is better than an education. Her schooling is
also a place of nightmares where Miss Trunchbull, the head mistress,
tosses children around by their hair, locks them away in an iron
maiden, and believes 'a perfect school is where there are no children
at all'.</P>
<P>Sure this maybe an exaggeration of the 'evil adults' theme, but
children do not have a voice when they are mistreated and abused. In
this remarkable story, Roald Dahl gives the child the power and
ability to fight back, and Matilda does so with a vengeance that is
worth watching.</P>
<P>This is a movie for both young and old, where the magic of imagination
is the central theme. Sit back and enjoy, and for a moment you may
remember what it was like to be a child.</P>
<P>Great direction and acting from DeVito, with a strong supporting cast.
Roald Dahl at his imaginative best.</P>
<PRE>Comment: Magical.</PRE>
