<PRE>"Cast Away"</PRE>
<P>Federal Express troubleshooter Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) travels the world
to spread the word to the growing number of FedEx employees that "we live
or die by the clock." Time is everything to Chuck and even the Christmas
celebration with his fiancée, Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt), is measured in
minutes as he is called away, yet again, to deal with some new company
crisis. On the way to his latest emergency an unexpected problem forces his
jet to ditch in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, leaving Chuck alone to
survive or die on a deserted isle in Roger Zemeckis's latest, "Cast Away."</P>
<P>Chuck is a true workaholic who lives his life by his tenets of time. When
we first meet him he is lecturing a group of Muscovite FedEx workers (with
a translator) on the time criticality of delivering their packages around
"the world on time." In a whirlwind, Chuck finishes one job, joins his
family for Christmas dinner, proposes to Kelly and is off again on his next
corporate disaster. This time, though, things go drastically wrong, his
plane crashes and Chuck finds himself stranded, alone, on a small, isolated
tropical island.</P>
<P>Without food or water, the castaway has to find the means to survive. He
learns, quickly, to find fresh water. He then harvests coconuts, after
almost getting conked by one, and extracts their milk and meat. Fishing is
next and Chuck learns the rudiments of fashioning tools and making fire.
It's a Robinson Crusoe tale sans Friday and evil pirates as he learns to
survive and live one day at a time. Time itself, ironically, changes as
Chuck starts thinking in terms of days, months and years instead of minutes
and seconds.</P>
<P>Chuck is trapped on the island by a powerful breakwater that hurls him and
his rubber raft back to the beach whenever he tries to get past. One day, a
fortunate piece of flotsam, the remains of a port-a-potty, washes up on the
island. It is perfect to make a sturdy sail that may just push him through
the waves of the breakers. As in any survivor flick, you're rooting for the
stranded hero every step of the way as he learns the ropes of survival and
escape.</P>
<P>"Cast Away" is, except for the requisite special F/X of the jet crash and
sinking into the depths of the Pacific (a chilling moment), a survival
flick, pure and very simple. Once the disaster of the crash is behind him,
Chuck has to face the prospects of no food, no water and no companions,
except for a picture in an antique watch given to him by Kelly. It is his
one link to sanity and civilization and, as the days drag on to months then
years, is one of the two things that keep him sane on the tiny island. I'll
get to the other in a moment.</P>
<P>Immediately after the crash and through much of his stay on the island,
FedEx packages keep washing ashore. Chuck very neatly sorts them all and
puts them aside for future delivery. After a while it becomes obvious to
Chuck that he should open them up to see if there is anything useful. He
finds, among other things, a volleyball, a pair of figure skates and a
fancy dress. The always thinking Chuck puts everything to use, Including
the volleyball. An accident causes him to smear the ball with his own
blood. The handprint becomes the basis for a face. The face takes on a name
- Wilson (what did you expect, Spaulding?) - and a companion is born. (This
companion device smacks of another survival film, 1971's "Omega Man," where
Charlton Heston anthropomorphizes a bust of Julius Caesar into a
conversation buddy.) Wilson becomes such a close friend that, when Chuck
gets separated from "him," you feel the man's loss of his friend.</P>
<P>The bulk of the film is about Chuck's survival and, with a masterful
one-man performance by Hanks, is a compelling tale told in straightforward
terms. There is no man Friday, no marauding pirates and no shark or giant
octopus attacks. It's all about living and surviving, both physically and
emotionally, from day to day without giving up or losing hope. There is
ample foreshadowing of events and changes to Chuck early on in the film as
he, as an aside, tells Kelly he has to get a tooth taken care of. You know
that pesky tooth is going to plague him later, but the script, by William
Boyle, Jr., makes such certainties a surprise.</P>
<P>The last part of the flick, its weakest, has Chuck, rescued, returning home
to find the object of his emotional survival, Kelly, married to another.
She is still his true love, but not his to have anymore. His angst is soon
wrapped up in a cute little coda that has Chuck delivering the one package
he saved. The final scene takes place, literally, at a crossroads where we
hope Chuck will make the right decision and gets on with his life. It's all
very feel good and positive but a disappointment after living with Chuck
through his four years of lonely isolation. With little time spent to
develop ancillary characters, in particular Hunt as Kelly, there is little
to the film beyond Hanks.</P>
<P>The best moments in "Cast Away" are sometime melancholy and sometimes
exciting. Chuck's obsession with escape takes on the same manic proportions
as Steve McQueen in "Papillon" and, when he finally breaks free, you feel
his thrill. A quiet, nighttime interlude has Chuck sail through a pod of
whales and one of them looks the man right in the eye, as if to comfort
him, that all will be well. And, of course, there are the conversations
with Wilson as the ball takes on more and more human characteristics in the
eyes of Chuck.</P>
<P>The production team, led by helmer Zemeckis, does a superb, understated job
in creating the lonely, island prison that holds Chuck captive. Lensing, by
Don Burgess, is in keeping with the island environment, putting you in the
middle of Chuck's day to day existence. Costume and makeup take almost a
comedic turn, at one point later in the film, where Chuck rises from the
water holding a trident to spear fish. The image of Neptune smacks you
right in the face, I hope intentionally by the makers. Kudos must go to
Hanks for the tremendous physical effort he underwent, gaining weight to
portray the pre-castaway Chuck, then losing 50 pounds to become the new,
sleek Chuck. The contrast is striking.</P>
<P>One thing is bound to come out of "Cast Away" - a deserved best actor
nomination for Hanks. It's a good, not great, film and a terrific character
study. I give it a B.</P>
