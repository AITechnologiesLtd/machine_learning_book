<PRE>>From 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
1 star</PRE>
<P>When their initial thoughts and ideas have been developed, scriptwriters
are often faced with the well-known problem of what to do next.  From
previous examples, we've discovered that writers can introduce new
characters, change the setting drastically or yield an unexpected
scenario - anything except lay down their guns and die.  But in the case
of How Stella Got Her Groove Back, no innovative artillery was ever
loaded.  And around half way through the film, I was left open-jawed as
I witnessed a horribly under written first half transform into a
horribly over written second.</P>
<P>The first example of how badly under written the beginning of Terry
McMillan's script is lies in the title of the film.  When it reads How
Stella Got Her Groove Back, one must pose the question of whether she
lost it in the first place.  Stella (Angela Bassett) is an amazingly
attractive 40-year-old who has a respectable job, which rakes in the
dollars.  When she takes a much-needed holiday, Stella picks up a
21-year-old Jamaican man, Winston (Taye Diggs), and eventually takes him
back home.  This in itself is not too much to digest, as the notion of
suspending disbelief is welcomed in a romantic fantasy of this sort.
But McMillan expects us to believe that Stella's "groove" is gone by
simply piecing together a few scenes of her at work, and quoting a few
lines of dialogue about her having to get out more.  A major oversight
aren't the words I'm looking for - a half assed job, perhaps, are
better.</P>
<P>By the time the second half begins, we're already more than just a
little fed up.  Stella and Winston sing a boring chorus of "should we or
should we not stay together", and that ultimately lasts for the rest of
the ordeal.</P>
<P>The fact that I saw one of the first prints of this film in Australia is
nothing for me to gloat about.  Of the thirteen or so viewers in the
cinema, only four - including me - were left seated for its final
moments. And who can blame them, since this punishing ordeal never
relents from butt numbing boredom.</P>
<P>To demonstrate the weaknesses in McMillan's screenplay, the film's gags
are simply not funny, and its most serious moments are way too funny.
An ambulance driver casually talking on a phone whilst a patient suffers
inside is not my idea of humor, and my idea of a serious moment does not
involve two adults arguing about whether or not they should stay
together for the tenth time.  That's why I can easily imagine why
McMillan's novel (of the same name) would be a much more pleasurable
experience.  At least, you could probably take it seriously.</P>
