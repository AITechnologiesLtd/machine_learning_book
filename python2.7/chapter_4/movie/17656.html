based on the story by Jurgen Buscher

<P>We are now still at the beginning of a year packed full of films, and
we already have our first Holocaust comedy. That is what some people
will say after a first glance at Joseph Vilsmaier's wonderful THE
HARMONISTS, but actually they will find little to be offended by. THE
HARMONISTS, unlike the wildly popular Oscar winner LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL,
is a true story that just happens to occur during an untimely era. THE
HARMONISTS is the more than slightly fictionalized story of the rise
and fall of the Comedian Harmonists, a group that was so popular
worldwide(especially in Europe) that one member was quoted as saying
that they could have been as famous as the Beatles...had they not
broken up.</P>
<P>Yes, the story of the Comedian Harmonists is not an easy one to
tell. It starts with the dreams of a young Jewish man named Harry
Frommermann(Ulrich Noethen, who looks unmistakably like Roberto
Benigni) living in Berlin circa 1927. He is a talented musician, but
he is also a poor man who does not have money to even feed his
bird. He then posts a newspaper ad that says he wants to start a
singing group. The first lock for the group is a monk named Bob
Biberti, and the next 4 singers come rolling along. The 6 begin having
vigorous rehearsals in order to get everything perfect. Then, of
course, there are the cliches of members threatening to leave because
the group isn't any good, etc. And Harry soons begin to realize that
Erna, the girl of his dreams, has taken a liking to Bob, and
eventually moves in with him. But the real twist begins when slowly
the members of the group, 3 Jewish and 3 gentile, begin to realize the
overwhelming anti-semitism in Germany. Soon, it comes to the point
when they are being threatened to no longer be allowed to perform
together, by the same people who are supposed to be their fans.</P>
<P>THE HARMONISTS works very well for the most part, telling an
interesting story and getting great performances from all the
leads. The songs are also all very catchy and well done. Sometimes,
the film's subplots threaten to take away from the story, but the
characters are always interesting enough to follow. It is obvious that
THE HARMONISTS has taken the liberty of changing a few things from the
actual story, but it's hard to care since the film is so vividly
engrossing. THE HARMONISTS is made by Miramax, which is having a lot
of luck with it's other two foreign films, the similar LIFE IS
BEAUTIFUL and CHILDREN OF HEAVEN. I must say once again that Miramax
is still putting out better movies than any movie studio on the
planet.</P>
