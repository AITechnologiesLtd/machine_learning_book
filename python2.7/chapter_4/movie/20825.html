<PRE>Happiness (8/10)</PRE>
<PRE>12th June 1999: Cineworld, Bristol </PRE>
<PRE>Major plot points revealed.</PRE>
<P>Happiness, written and directed by Todd Solondz, won the International
Critics' Prize at Cannes last year. It is an extremely frank and
disturbing look at the emotional horror stories that exist under the
surface of the lives of several apparently everyday American
suburbanites. The characters' lives intersect in various ways, as if to
suggest that the film has not just chosen a few freaks to examine, but
that the awfulness of what goes on in the film is quite normal.</P>
<P>The interweaving stories show the ways in which the characters seek
happiness and uniformly fail. These include a woman's doomed romances,
an obscene phone caller who stumbles into a pathetic relationship with
an overweight and lonely neighbour, the breakdown of a late middle-aged
couple's marriage, an 11-year old boy's first experiments with
masturbation and, most unsettling of all, the boy's father's appalling
sexual abuse of two of his son's friends. It is this aspect of the film
that is truly shocking. The son, embarrassed and confused about his
stirring sexuality, goes to his father for advice. The father's calm but
frank comments can be seen either as a model of open and supportive
parenting, or as an attempt at a gross seduction. The scenes in which
the father plots his assaults are uncomfortable enough to watch, but the
scene in which he admits to his son what he has done, and describes it
with brutal candour, is almost unbearable. Despite the monstrous things
this paedophile does, he is not portrayed as a monster, but rather as a
pathetic character whom we can almost feel some sympathy for. It is this
that has provoked some to call the film morally repugnant.</P>
<P>The other story lines are hardly light-hearted, and there is a rape and
murder thrown in for good measure, but there is nevertheless a strange
humour, fuelled by embarrassment, running through much of the film. The
cast is uniformly excellent, although Dylan Baker deserves special
mention for his portrayal of the paedophile father.</P>
<P>I was not looking forward to seeing Happiness, but felt it was a film I
had to see. I can't say I enjoyed it very much, but it is as emotionally
involving and challenging as cinema can get.</P>
