<PRE>For Love of the Game (1999)
A film review by Steve Lipson</PRE>
<P>        When one thinks of typical plots for movie romances, the love triangle 
frequently comes to mind. It would seem to be the perfect story line for 
whatever genre the filmmakers aim for: the tension in a romantic drama over 
which couple ends up together, the merriment in a romantic comedy as the 
main characters try to one-up the other to win the affections of their 
object of desire. Kevin Costner obviously knows the inherent appeal of this 
scenario, as two of his most popular romantic comedies ("Bull Durham" and 
"Tin Cup") fit comfortably into the conventions of the love triangle. In a 
way, Costner's latest film falls into this same tradition. The romantic 
comedy/ drama "For Love of the Game" stars Costner as a man forced to choose 
between the two main loves of his life. Only this time, one of these objects 
of affection is not a person but a concept. This twist in the typical love 
triangle scenario elevates the motion picture and enables it to easily 
compensate for the predictability which all too often permeates romantic 
comedies.</P>
<P>        At its heart, "For Love of the Game" features a romantic triangle between 
Billy Chapel (Costner), Jane Aubrey (Kelly Preston), and the game of 
baseball. Costner stars as a major league pitcher near the end of an 
illustrious 19-year career. It would seem that Billy enjoys the ideal 
life--a beautiful girlfriend, tremendous wealth and popularity, the 
opportunity to work doing what he loves--but his stability and happiness 
suddenly becomes uprooted on the second to last day of the season. The owner 
of his team approaches Billy in his hotel room and informs him that he plans 
to sell his team, the Detroit Tigers; worse, the new owners intend in the 
off-season to trade Billy away from the organization he has given his heart 
and soul to for the past two decades. Billy now faces the option of 
retirement rather than appearing disloyal to the fans and team he loves. But 
thoughts such as these quickly become secondary in his mind to potentially 
worse news: his girlfriend of five years, fashion writer Jane Aubrey, 
announces that she plans to leave him to accept a position in London. She 
has finally realized that baseball means far more to Billy than she ever 
could. All these troubles weigh on Billy's mind as he takes the mound that 
night, determined to do his best in what may be the last game of his career.</P>
<P>        The bulk of the story alternates between Billy's pitching performance 
against the New York Yankees on this momentous yet troubled evening and 
flashbacks to events in the last five years that show how Billy reached this 
low point in his life. The baseball scenes are very well-done, with 
play-by-play by real life baseball announcers Vin Scully and Steve Lyons 
increasing the realism. (Although the filmmakers seem to have conveniently 
ignored the "five-and-ten rule," which would make some of Billy's troubles 
moot. See below.) But the game itself ultimately takes a back seat to the 
unique love triangle, and fortunately it is in the more emotional scenes of 
the film where superb acting and directing combine to overcome the 
limitations of the subgenre.</P>
<P>        It would be unfair to single out either Sam Raimi's inventive direction or 
the performances of Costner and Preston for the movie's success. "For Love 
of the Game"'s best scenes invariably blend both of these elements for their 
considerable power. Raimi is best known for his unconventional direction of 
thrillers and horror movies like "A Simple Plan" and "Evil Dead," and his 
skill shows here especially through his fascinating use of subjective 
visuals and sound. For the movie to work at all, it must be clear that 
Costner's character feels intense love for both Jane and the game. 
Initially, Billy's love of baseball stands out much clearer in the viewer's 
mind. Raimi's scenes of Billy on the mound cut between two different shots: 
closeups of Costner's face exhibiting intense concentration with full-body 
low-angle shots of Costner making the pitch. Most significantly, all sound 
disappears as the ball is thrown; Billy fails to even notice the background 
noise as his whole mind is focused on achieving success in the game. These 
subjective uses of sound and camera angle cast Billy as he sees himself: a 
heroic loner proud to take his team on his shoulders and give his all for 
the game. Costner's penetrating gazes and impressive physique complement 
Raimi's direction perfectly.</P>
<P>        Nevertheless, a flashback scene most clearly emphasizes Billy's apparent 
conviction that his love of baseball exceeds his love of Jane. Following an 
incident at his mountain home in which Billy seriously injures his pitching 
arm, the audience sees him rushed to a helicopter. Jane is most concerned 
for Billy's safety and well-being; Billy's only worry appears to be how this 
accident will affect his pitching career. As Billy is being lifted onto the 
helicopter, we see the emphatic, determined look in Costner's eyes as Billy 
tells Jane that his trainer is the most important person to him right now. 
Preston's face immediately registers a deep sense of hurt, and this 
isolation is given concrete expression by Raimi as the transparent 
helicopter doors immediately slam shut between the camera and Preston. As 
this memorable scene continues, we see the gulf between Billy and Jane 
metaphorically get wider as alternating point-of-view shots show the 
helicopter taking off and Jane staying mournfully behind. Shots such as 
these which depict separation between characters are not uncommon in movies; 
nevertheless, Raimi invests this scene with added force by his unique camera 
movement. As the camera in the helicopter travels up and away from Jane in a 
diagonal direction, we sense Billy's apparent abandonment of her all the 
more palpably.</P>
<P>        Given this attitude of Billy's, it is not surprising that Jane decides to 
leave him. Only after he learns the news does he finally realize how much he 
needs her. Again, strong direction and acting allow Billy's transformation 
to appear convincing. As he pitches what may well be the final game of his 
career, Raimi shows the aforementioned heroic shots of the pitcher. But 
alone in the dugout, a far different Billy emerges. Frequent close-ups of 
Costner reveal an anguished expression, as Billy painfully reminisces back 
on the unfortunate course of his relationship with Jane via memories that 
spark the flashback sequences. I am probably not giving too much away to say 
that Billy wins the game, a glorious conclusion to his illustrious career. 
But Billy does not feel happy. One memorable shot takes us back to his hotel 
room, but unlike the considerable camera movement earlier in the film, this 
shot is entirely static. It depicts the enormity of the room, with Billy 
just a small pathetic figure sitting on the bed. Again, Raimi makes 
impressive use of subjective sound. We witness total silence and 
motionlessness for a long stretch of time, until finally a sound starts to 
swell up on the soundtrack. It is the sound of Billy crying. Without Jane, 
and despite his incredible success at baseball, Billy feels as isolated and 
alone as ever.</P>
<P>        "For the Love of the Game" adheres to most of the conventions of romantic 
comedies, but because of the unique nature of the love triangle, they do not 
feel forced. Of course, we all know the typical outline of romantic comedy 
in which boy meets girl and then boy and girl break up. But unlike most 
movies of this genre, where the separation between the two lovers is caused 
by a silly contrivance, here the events surrounding the breakup are entirely 
believable. We are entirely convinced of Costner's deep love of the game of 
baseball, so his choice that his career is more important to him than his 
girlfriend (in the helicopter scene) does not seem unreasonable. Rather than 
silly misunderstanding, the drifting apart of Billy and Jane comes from 
heartfelt emotion.</P>
<P>        And, finally, lest I mistakenly leave the impression that this movie is a 
downer, let me hint at the conclusion. Again owing to the unique nature of 
this romantic triangle, the object of desire does not need to decide between 
two flesh-and-blood suitors--thus disappointing one of them and perhaps 
leaving audience members unhappy with the choice. Because one of the figures 
in this triangle is an intangible idea, it is possible that Billy can keep 
his devotion "for love of the game" without sacrificing his human love in 
the process.</P>
<P>        Note: "The five-and-ten-rule" states that any major league baseball player 
who has served in the majors for ten years, the last five of which were for 
the same team, has the right to veto any trade in which he would be 
involved. Thus, since Billy meets these qualifications, he need not have 
worried about being traded away by the new owners in the real world of 
baseball. But given the emotional power of this film, I would suggest that 
even a committed baseball fan should have no problem suspending their 
disbelief in this manner.</P>
