<P>Is there a lot brewing within `Anywhere but Here', or does it just seem
that way? There is little depth or inner context to this story of a
feuding mother and daughter, but the actors submit a tremendous amount
of heart and realism. In turn, the emotional impact is multiplied. And
if you don't get misty-eyed during `Anywhere but Here', I'm afraid your
retinas may have detached.</P>
<P>What could have been `just another movie' is given remarkable elevation
by director Wayne Wang (`The Joy Luck Club') and the screen duo of Susan
Sarandon and Natalie Portman. The majority of the film is heavily
reliant on the believability of their relationship, especially when
considering the supporting cast is used sparsely, and even then the
actors are merely background strokes to paint a more attractive portrait
of the central conflict. Both Sarandon and Portman perform wonderfully,
and their emotions never ring hollow. Much like the recent underrated
romance `The Story of Us', the trials and tribulations of this mother
and daughter strike a powerful chord with the audience.</P>
<P>Moving out of Wisconsin and headed to Beverly Hills, Adele August
(Sarandon) and her daughter Ann (Natalie Portman) have already began a
feisty bout of feuding. Ann's occasional narration informs us of the
family background: her father left when she was young, Adele married for
a second time, and now the twosome are traveling to the palm
tree-infested locales of Beverly Hills to try and start over. But Ann
despises her mother in every sense of the word, and is eagerly awaiting
her chance to slip away to college back east and escape the domineering
matriarch who, naturally, only wants the best for her daughter. But even
with her tender care, she doesn't let Ann voice her opinion. It soon
becomes apparent that it is Adele's way... or the highway.</P>
<P>There was a sense of immense gratification as the credits began to roll
after `American Beauty'. What generated this rare sensation was the
realization that we had just experienced the lives of three perfectly
realized characters. The two female leads in `Anywhere but Here' are
hardly the polished characters that one would describe as `perfect', but
they're more than sufficient given the demands of the screenplay.
There's a hefty dose of realism present at virtually all times, and this
effect is improved a notch or two by the impeccable lead performances.
It's a touching and funny tale for anyone who's been in a situation
resembling the emotional challenge that Ann and Adele are facing.</P>
<P>I found myself thinking afterward that perhaps Wang was too generous
with the screen time of the central mother-to-daughter conflict. Once in
a while, a supporting character is given the floor, but mainly all
secondary performers are given the dramatic sidebar in this endless
Sarandon-Portman buffet of emotions. I wanted a far meatier role for
Hart Bochner, who plays a Beverly Hills orthodontist that Adele gets
involved with. It's hard to believe, but Bochner was that snotty,
bearded jerk who cowardly attempted to give Bruce Willis away to the
terrorists in `Die Hard' (yes - he has muscled up since then). Shawn
Hatosy (`Outside Providence') is effective but used sparingly as Ann's
cousin Benny. Corbin Alldred is flat-out charming as a likable doofus
pining for Ann's affection, and Michael Milhoan registers nicely as an
earnest cop who offers some wise to both of the ladies. Both, however,
could have been relied upon more often.</P>
<P>Sarandon is so good at this sort of thing. With her eagerness to bite
right into the role of Adele, there's absolutely no worries from minute
one. But I was pleasantly surprised with Natalie Portman. The young
actress was impressive as Queen Amidala in `The Phantom Menace', but the
role was too stale to warrant any real dramatics. Portman is
surprisingly strong alongside Sarandon, though, shedding tears without
the slightest whiff of inexperience.  After her appearance in `Episode
1', Portman could provide the biggest audience attraction for `Anywhere
but Here'.</P>
<P>I would recommend this film to anyone who thinks female characters have
been unfairly dismissed and underwritten as of late. `Anywhere but Here'
is anything but the case, adding believable emotions and sure-fire
direction to an otherwise tired formula. Bring with you only two things:
a loved one, and some Kleenex.</P>
