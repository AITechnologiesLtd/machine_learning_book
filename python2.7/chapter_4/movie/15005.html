<P>In the 19th century arts, reaction to romanticism begat realism (mostly in
France) which begat naturalism, which begat verismo (in Italy), which, in
the 1940s, begat Italy's neorealism in movies, which begat various types of
neo-naturalist films in America and elsewhere.</P>
<P>Monument Ave. is a slice-of-life movie that leaves the viewer uncertain as
to whether it is plain realism (telling it like it is) or mixed with
naturalism (heredity, environment, circumstances beyond their control
determine the life and fate of the characters).The film has its share of
atmosphere but is lacking in explanations, motivations, and development of
characters.</P>
<P>Charlestown, a one square mile Boston enclave of Irish-Americans, is a
depressing location. Monument Avenue separates its blue-collar area from
the part that apparently is being yuppieized by outsiders. Only the
drabness of its "natives" and their homes is shown. Within this, the focus
is almost exclusively on insular low-lifes, specifically a group of five
pals who drink a lot, talk a lot, snort coke and are what's usually
described as "petty thieves," an expression that makes me wonder where
"petty" starts and where it  stops. Their specialty seems to be car thefts,
under the tutelage of Bobby O'Grady (Leary).</P>
<P>The first thing you might notice is that the United Kingdom does not have
an exclusive in local accents. The Charlestownites' speech  can be as
tricky as cockney. As they gab, their sentences often overlap; many
conversations are set bars with distracting ambient noises; some accents
come and go -- not  a major objection given the devilish difficulty
performers have with accents. The sound recording is not adequately sharp.
To follow the dialogue is a problem. Not that the audience misses much, as
the talk is less than fascinating. In one of the clearest arguments, the
pals are discussing movie actors and specifically female breasts, natural
or siliconed.</P>
<P>This is one of the more picturesque bits in the movie. Another is the
opening, a skillfully done sequence that looks like a car chase at night,
but is not. It has marginal relevance to the story, such as it is. A third,
most suspenseful and frightening, has the boys grab, insult, mistreat and
almost shoot an unfortunate black man who had wandered onto their turf.</P>
<P>Several of the characters display crosses hanging from their necks, but
religion does not go a long way with these men and women. Nor does their
very limited vocabulary in which the only clearly uttered words are the
f-verb and the f-adjective. They are used perhaps 1,350 times, or once per
four seconds, which makes the film a champion in the Guinness Book of
Records.</P>
<P>In the bars (more exactly, gloomy pubs), both nothing and everything goes
on. A friend just out of jail, suspected of having talked too much to the
cops, is executed Mafia-style -- the way many Mafiosi are gunned down in
restaurants. The Irish code of silence (called omerta in the Mafia) makes
the witnesses tell  police inspector Hanlon (Sheen) that they saw nothing.
He has already guessed that their alibi will be "I was in the bathroom."
"21 guys in the bathroom at the same time?" marvels Hanlon in one of the
very few bits of (sinister) levity of the movie.</P>
<P>The petty thieves have no capo, no don, no godfather, as in the Mafia, yet
there is a puppet-master,  Jackie O'Hara, called rather too cutely Jackie
O, as sometimes Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis was. He is played fairly
interestingly by Colm Meany who justly became famous for his lovable Irish
father in the wonderful The Snapper (U.K., 1993). His subsequent film
roles, both light and heavy, have not been impressive -- although he is
very good in the not-yet-released Claire Dolan.</P>
<P>Jackie is unloquacious by Irish standards. Behind his show of friendliness,
is a quietly menacing figure, that of a benefactor to some locals whom he
helps with donations -- or loans that place them under his thumb. There's a
current of antagonism between him and Bobby, who, presumably the smartest
of a sad lot, a candidate for first place among the boys in the hood, a man
conscious of Jackie's manipulations.(This is spelled out in an explosion of
tempers during in an awkward hockey-on-asphalt game).</P>
<P>Leary has presence, cool and not overdone within the film's context, and
with glimmers that may make you say about him :"What a waste! He could have
done better things." The rest of the characters are merely unexplored
sketches.</P>
<P>The plot is minimal -- but that's no criticism. Real life does not always
have plot material in it, so that the lack of it would not have been a
drawback had more care been lavished on the characters. Were the
film-makers thinking that their creatures were so empty that there was no
way to round them out? Instead, the film concentrates on mood, more
atmospheric than artificially colorful -- and does this well. Even so, the
photography may have tried too hard to be uncompromisingly realistic by
shunning the use of supplementary lighting, so that some interior scenes
remain too dark and eye-straining.</P>
<P>At picture's end, suspense does pick up. I will not give away the details,
but it is unlikely that when gunplay explodes, the dancers right next door
to it do not seem to hear it; and that inspector Hanlon appears within
seconds. Also, the death of a character just as he had decided he wanted
out, is too neat a cliche of tragic irony.</P>
<P>It's a sad little film. As an abused girl --Jackie's mistress who has, on
the side, an affair with Bobby--states: "Nothing's gonna change."</P>
<P>" Le mauvais gout mene au crime" (Stendhal)</P>
