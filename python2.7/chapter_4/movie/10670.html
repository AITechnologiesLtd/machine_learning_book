<PRE>A movie review by Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>Written by Matt Damon and his best friend Ben Affleck, who also appears 
in the film as Damon's best friend, 'Good Will Hunting' was created on 
paper before the two of them were struggling to break into show business, 
growing up in South Boston and setting their own goals.  For Damon, it's 
a smart move, much in the same approach that Billy Bob Thornton took 
in 1996 as he wrote the screenplay to 'Sling Blade', and adapted it for 
the big screen as an independent film and Thornton had the starring
role.</P>
<P>Beginning at MIT (The Massachusetts Institute of Technology), 'Good Will
Hunting' begins with a math professor (Stellan Skarsgard), who gives a 
complex math problem to his class and offers an incentive to the first
one 
that can solve it.  It took the professor two and a half years to solve
it so
what a challenge for his students!  He writes the problem on the
blackboard 
outside the classroom and later a janitor in the building (Matt Damon)
solves 
the problem almost without thinking about it.  This really isn't work
for 
him but being a janitor is and he resists attempts at developing his
gift of mathematical brain power.</P>
<P>Damon later gets arrested for assault and the judge agrees to release
him to the care of the professor who arranges for several court ordered
tasks to be performed as part of an agreement to keep Damon out of jail
and he has Damon introduced to a therapist, (Robin Williams) and Damon
meets his match in this clever and eager elder who wants to help Damon
find his true inner self.</P>
<P>There are many observations one can make after viewing 'Good Will
Hunting'.  The most acute observation that will probably be made by most
is that it tells the story of an ordinary young man with extraordinary
abilities.  Although most of us can't identify with his genius for
solving mathematical problems, we can identify with the relationship he
has with his friends, his elders and the lady in his life (Minnie
Driver).  This is the most uplifting film I've seen since 1989's 'My
Left Foot'
and 'Good Will Hunting' leaps off the pages of its script and unfolds
like a 
play with a simple look, a complex set of characters and a desire to do 
what films of this type should always do, educate and enlighten.  It
also has brilliantly coherent dialogue and a story of many personal
bondings 
that will make movie audiences feel better about themselves when they 
leave the theatre.</P>
<P>The performances all around are nothing short of miraculous guided by 
the surprisingly inspired direction of Gus Van Sant ('My Own Private 
Idaho', 'Drugstore Cowboy', 'To Die For') who makes the entire film
bright with flashes of real life characters brought to the point of not
only 
becoming better people by the end of the film but Van Sant was able to
keep everyone on their mark by following his direction exactly.  This is
evident by the completely humourless performance by Robin Williams who
doesn't
inject one funny moment in his usual witty and manic style of comedy and
its
the best film role Robin Williams has ever had.  Even in two of his
three
Oscar nominated roles, 'Dead Poet Society' and 'The Fisher King',
Williams
still injected moments of unexpected humour but there is none contained
in
'Good Will Hunting' and it is a refreshing breath of air as Williams
finally
begins to explore his true potential. </P>
<P>'Good Will Hunting' has a ring of Oscar potential to it but more
importantly 
than that, it really can provide lessons in helping people sort out
their 
lives with only one viewing. </P>
