<PRE>Lolita (1997)</PRE>
<P>Seen on 6 November 1998 for $8.75 with Andrea and Lothlorien at the
Lincoln Plaza Cinemas</P>
<P>Setting all the considerable controversy aside, this new version of
*Lolita*, based on Vladimir Nabakov's novel, is one of the most
beautifully filmed movies of the year. Backwards tracking shots while
simultaneously zooming in on a car in sea of grassy fields. Lingering
twilights as the lamps of kitschy motor lodges turn on. The darkness
of a character beside his car against the whiteness of a western
desert. All of it accompanied by the haunting score by Ennio
Morricone. Director Adrian Lyne spreads one of the most sumptuous
visual meals of 1998.</P>
<P>Then there's the controversy: The little matter of a middle-aged man's
sexual affair with a 14-year-old girl, the daughter of a woman he
marries just to be around the young woman. There are people who see
both sides very clearly; Humbert Humbert (Jeremy Irons) is seen as
either manipulating Lolita (Dominique Swain), working the situations
to his advantage; or Lolita has willfully seduced and broken the heart
of a much-older man who still suffers the loss of the girl he loved in
his own adolescence. Personally, I am in the former camp, but Stephen
Schiff's adaptation makes it clear: Both Lolita and Humbert realize
the powers they have over one another.</P>
<P>Set in the late 1940s, Humbert Humbert meets Lolita and her mother
Charlotte (Melanie Griffith), marrying her to be near the daughter who
intoxicates him. Charlotte discovers her husband's journal and is
felled in the street by a car accident. He retrieves Lolita and, only
after having successfully bedding her, does he reveal that her mother
is dead.  What ensues is a private struggle set against the vastness
of America, as the unorthodox couple, posing as father-daughter, cross
the country.</P>
<P>What stands out here, besides the filming, are the
performances. Irons, with his long face, is perfect as the obsessed
leacher. Griffiths' natural affinity for tartiness imparts the needed
annoyances that define Charlotte. The standout is Swain's gum-chewing
Lolita, alternating from "nymphet" to hurt child to viper to
dullard. It's fascinating to watch Swain act like the exasperating
14-year-old she is one moment, and raw sexpot the next. The most
startling scene is one in which she seems to be innocently sitting on
Humbert's lap, reading the Sunday comics, rocking back and
forth--until you realize exactly she's not on a rocking chair.
Swain's performance is the key to the ambiguity that clouds
objectivity with Humbert's rationalizations.</P>
<P>Frank Langella, who's body sure has changed since playing the sexiest
Dracula ever, plays Clare Quilty.</P>
<P>Original music by Ennio Morricone; cinematography by Howard Atherton;
costume design by Judianna Makovsky. Film Editing by David Brenner and
Julie Monroe.</P>
