<P>     Disney's 35th animated feature-- a retooling of the Olympian legend
crossed with, well, the Superman story-- is surprisingly soft at the
center.  Great wit, great art, and a great villain (James Woods as
Hades, Lord of the Underworld and local lounge act) can't quite stifle
the yawns induced by a bland hero, his colorfully monotonous sidekick
(Danny DeVito as the satyrical trainer Phil), and a largely unremarkable
soundtrack.  (None of the Alan Menken/David Zippel tunes are particular-
ly noteworthy.  Some lack lyrical snap.  Others need more memorable
melodies.  Boring ballads we expect, but boring production numbers,
too?)</P>
<P>     So, HERCULES is a bit of a long sit, but you won't stay bored.  The
highlights include a nifty round of animated action (Herc battling a CGI
hydra), a steady stream of anachronisms ("somebody call IX-I-I") and pop
references ("let's get ready to rumble!") a la ALADDIN, and several
long-overdue jabs at the Mouse's marketing and merchandising depart-
ments.  While not as rock-solid as HUNCHBACK, it's a still a new world
of improvement over POCOHONTAS.  Directed by Ron Clements and John
Musker, with voice credits including Tate Donovan, Susan Egan, Bob
Goldthwait, Matt Frewer, Samantha Eggar, Paul Shaffer, and, as Lighting
Bolt Zeus, Rip Torn, who's having a very good summer, also appearing in
TRIAL AND ERROR and MEN IN BLACK.</P>
