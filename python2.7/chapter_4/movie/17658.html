<P>BRIDE OF CHUCKY by DeWyNGaLe    Rating: C</P>
<P>Child's Play is one of the most popular horror series around today.  In 1988,
the first film, Child's Play, was released and became a cult hit instantly. 
Two more films were released afterwards, and now, the fourth installment in the
Child's Play series has arrived.  In this one, Tiffany, played by the Oscar
nominated actress Jennifer Tilly, plays the girlfriend of Chucky when Chucky
was still a human.  When Chucky became a doll, their relationship was ruined. 
Years later, Tiffany has found Chucky, who has been almost completely destroyed
after the events that took place in Child's Play 3.  </P>
<P>Tiffany's plan is to bring Chucky back to life so the two can be together once
again.  She does so, but he isn't as nice as she had hoped.  After locking him
up in a cage, she decides to buy him a doll of a bride so he can have some
company.  Chucky is infuriated with Tiffany.  He breaks lose of the cage and
kills Tiffany while she is taking a bath.  Now, using voodoo, he transfers her
into the body of the doll.  She is the bride of Chucky.</P>
<P>The scenes with Tiffany and Chucky are especially funny.  The first thirty
minutes of the film, which includes these hilarious scenes, are the best parts
of the movie.  From here on, the film goes downhill.  When Tiffany was a human,
she lived in a trailer park.  Her neighbor was Jesse, played by Nick Stabile, a
teenager who helped her out with some things.  Tiffany and Chucky need to get
to New Jersey to find the amulet in the human form of Chucky's grave so that
they can be transferred into human bodies once again.  On the phone, Tiffany
calls Jesse and asks him to drive two dolls to New Jersey.  Thinking that the
Tiffany on the phone is the real Tiffany, Jesse accepts the offer.  He brings
his girlfriend Jade, played by Katherine Heigl.  The two plan to get married on
their journey to New Jersey, because of her over protective uncle that she
lives with, who is a police sheriff, played by John Ritter.  He does not want
them seeing each other, so she decides to run away.  From here, Chucky and
Tiffany go on a killing spree on their way to New Jersey which lead to some
funny and corny moments.  </P>
<P>The plot of Bride of Chucky is a little strange.  It is a lot of fun though. 
The film is not much of a horror movie, as the other ones were, but more of a
dark comedy.  Like I said, the film works wonderfully for the first thirty
minutes, but with one-dimensional characters such as Jade and Jesse that throw
the movie into the same old horror movie stuff, the film cannot succeed
overall.  The Tiffany doll was nice to have for a change, rather than Chucky by
himself.  She added a lot to the film.  Chucky is the same as ever.  He has a
bad temper and is also very funny.  The two together are very funny.  </P>
<P>After a while on the trip to New Jersey, the film becomes pretty much
pointless.  It is very repetitive throughout parts of the film.  A lot of jokes
do work, especially Tiffany's obsession with Martha Stuart.  The reason I did
like this film so much was mainly because it was so different from everything
else.  Although it wasn't horror, it was a fun plot and a fun movie.  If the
film concentrated completely on the dolls and not other characters such as
Jesse and Jade, the film could have been much better.  The way I look at it is-
A movie about a girl who is transformed into a doll hooks up with Chucky and
they go on a killing spree.  How good could it be?</P>
<P>The Bottom Line- More sequels could be made in this series- As long as they are
as different as this one.</P>
