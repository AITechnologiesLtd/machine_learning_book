<P>The name "Terry McMillan" on a book cover, seems to strike fear in the
hearts of [SOME] Black men; one glance, and [SOME] guys automatically
decide that the book will be filled with Black feminazi-ism at its
worse.  A deserved reputation?  Maybe; her WAITING TO EXHALE novel (and
its film adaptation) certainly did little to dissuade [SOME] of My
Brothers' belief that she's Out To Get Them.  By all rights then,
DISAPPEARING ACTS, one of McMillan's earlier works - and this film
adaptation of it - might also be seen as more of the same bashing.  Not
by me, though; at least, not the film.  If anything, I saw the film as a
celebration of the struggles, and triumphs, people in love go through
every single day.</P>
<P>Which is to say, don't believe the hype, fellas; Ms. McMillan doesn't
have it in for alla y'all.  Just the triflin' ones...</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Zora Banks (Sanaa Lathan) is a struggling singer-songwriter looking for
her big break.  Franklin Swift (Wesley Snipes) is a construction worker
also struggling - just to keep a gig in the sometimey construction
business.   Zora and Franklin have big dreams: she, of quitting her job
as a music teacher and recording her songs; he, of renovating Brooklyn
brownstone buildings in his own contracting business.  They cross paths
when Zora moves into a brownstone Franklin is helping rebuild - and
their lives will never be the same.</P>
<P>Both Zora and Franklin have Issues in their lives that they don't fully
disclose, that threaten their burgeoning relationship when those issues
come to the light.  Zora is used to some of the finer things in life;
Franklin's a down home guy doing the best he can to get by.  Neither of
them were looking for love: but as it tends to, love found them.  But is
love enough to keep two such different people together?</P>
<P>The Upshot:
I liked McMillan's book well enough when I first read it years ago (back
before anybody ever told me she was a "man-hater"); but there's
something about the film adaptation of it that raises it to another
level.  Was it the electrifying chemistry that stars Sanaa Lathan and
Wesley Snipes had as lovers Zora and Franklin?  Was it director Gina
Prince's magical touch behind the camera?  Was it screenwriter Lisa
Jones' softening of McMillan's original harsher tone?  Was it the
beautiful musical score and soundtrack?</P>
<P>Yep; you betcha.  It was all that.  And a tasty bag 'a chips.</P>
<P>I was skeptical about the romantic pairing of Snipes and Lathan, but
they pulled it off beautifully.  In fact, their coupling overshadowed
much of the rest of the story, to the point where the co-stars all
seemed to be an afterthought.  With a lesser cast, this might not have
been as big a deal; but when you have talent like CCH Pounder (as
Franklin's mother), John Amos (as Franklin's father), John Beasley (as
Zora's father), and Clark Johnson (Franklin's friend Jimmy) going to
waste, it lessens the experience somewhat.  As Zora's bougie girlfriends
and her would-be music producer, Regina Hall (Portia), Lisa Arrindell
Anderson (Claudette) and Q-Tip (Reg) got a good bit of screen time, but
I would've gladly reduced their time to see more of Franklin's
interactions with his friend Jimmy, their relationship with her father
and his mother and father, his sometimey boss Vinny (Michael Imperioli),
his "Issues" from his past, and his implied problems with some his White
co-workers.  In other words, it would've been good to see more of those
outside life forces driving Zora and Franklin in their everyday lives.</P>
<P>Still, for each moment of my missing the potential of a supporting cast
member, Snipes and Lathan made up for it, and then some.  Theirs was a
very credible, and evenhandedly-told, love story portrayed in all its
hills and valleys.  My assessment of Franklin (the movie version, if not
the book) differs with 3BC Guest Star Apryl Voner - my companion for the
Detroit premiere - in her review of DISAPPEARING ACTS.  But for one or
two scenes, I felt that Snipes, with the help of the director and
writer, flavored Franklin with something more than the bland "No Good
Man" spice - for which I applaud them all.  Lathan's lip-synching was
off - hopefully, she won't play a singer in the future - but given the
interplay between Lathan and Snipes, her missed attempts in this aspect
were easy enough to ignore.</P>
<P>Due to Prince's unique director's eye (her black and white stills were a
brilliant move), Jones' understanding of the heart and soul of
McMillan's written word, and especially Snipes' and Lathan's steamy love
scenes - in *and* out of bed - DISAPPEARING ACTS is a movie that, even
moreso than HBO's production of INTRODUCING DOROTHY DANDRIDGE, could've
easily been released as a feature film.  But I ain't mad at HBO; I'm
just glad I'm a subscriber.</P>
<P>The Interview:
I had an unexpected chance to interview Sanaa Lathan before the
premiere; and though I wound up asking her only a couple, fairly lame,
questions, Lathan graciously responded, abating some of my nervousness.
When asked how she sees herself in the brave new world of Black actors
finally getting some meaningful roles in mainstream Hollywood films,
Lathan said she hopes to maintain her integrity, and get the kinds of
roles she is capable of doing great things with.</P>
<P>If Lathan keeps going down the same trail she blazed with films like THE
BEST MAN, LOVE AND BASKETBALL, and DISAPPEARING ACTS, she'll do just
fine.</P>
<P>The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
     [Watch Bammer get her Eviction Notice from the 'hood...]</P>
<P>Ok, put the kiddies to bed; I need to talk to the Grown Folks.  *My*
Grown Folks.</P>
<P>My People, My People...can I be for real tho'?  Too bad, I'm gonna:  We
need to stop clownin' in the theater.  Yes, I *did* say that.  And I'll
do it again: We need to quit.</P>
<P>I was too through with the premiere audience's chatter, with their
laughter at inappropriate times (the girl was *sick*; since when is that
funny?) and with all the childish, loud giggling during Franklin and
Zora's sex scenes.  Fine, We don't know what head is all about - or so
the myth goes.  But dag, was it necessary to drown out relevant dialogue
with all the tittering whenever Wesley's bootie showed on screen?  Yes,
it *was* fine...but get over it already, okay?  Can We *pretend* that
We've been out before?  I'm just glad I get HBO, and can watch this show
tonight in the comfort of my own bed.</P>
<PRE>Hey, if it gets my Ghetto Pass revoked, so be it.  Y'all know I ain't
lyin'.</PRE>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
If you have access to HBO [and no, that *doesn't* include hot-wiring
cable in just so you can get this flick.  Ya Heard.], by all means,
catch DISAPPEARING ACTS as it premieres Saturday December 9 at 9pm
Eastern.  "Acts" is must see-TV:  Wesley Snipes and Sanaa Lathan
positively SIZZLE on the screen, Gina Prince's direction is top-notch,
and screenwriter Lisa Jones does a good job of toning down Terry
McMillan's perceived bent towards men-bashing.</P>
<P>DISAPPEARING ACTS (rating: greenlight):
Here's to more of these types of mature, realistic, sensuous
slice-of-life movies starring Black actors, coming to screens big and
small.</P>
<P>[Catch the premiere of the HBO original film DISAPPEARING ACTS on
Saturday December 9, 2000, 9pm Eastern, with additional air dates on
December 12, 17, 20, 25, and 28].</P>
