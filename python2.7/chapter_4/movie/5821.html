<PRE>                                   EMMA
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: It may be that the Jane Austen craze
          is nearing the end of its course, at least with me.
          The title character plays with people's emotions
          and even their lives.  In the end her punishment is
          she is a little contrite for a few scenes before
          all her dreams come true.  Ms. Austen's all-too-
          visible hand sets everything right in the end, as
          she always does.  A well-acted and well-
          photographed film, but the story is not Austen's
          best.  Rating: +1 (-4 to +4).  WARNING: some minor
          spoilers.</PRE>
<P>     EMMA is an exquisite recreation of early 19th century country
life.  Seeing one scene after another is like looking in on historical
rooms recreated in a museum.  It is not that every scene is ornate, but
each has a feel of authenticity.  One almost feels that a guide taking
the viewer around the room and telling the viewer what each of the
items is might have been nearly as interesting as having the actors
play out the scene.  And at the end of the film one almost feels that
might have been a better use of time.  I am afraid that it will take
some effort to convince me that this is really a better story than even
INDEPENDENCE DAY has, as boorish as that might sound.</P>
<P>     As is frequently the case in a Jane Austen story, EMMA is
concerned with the vitally important issue of which of Ms. Austen's
generally shallow characters will marry which others.  Especially of
interest is how will Austen's main heroine get together, after some
tribulation of course, with the man who it is so obvious from the
beginning is the perfect choice for a husband.  At least in SENSE AND
SENSIBILITY the main character was in some ways admirable.  The self-
satisfied Emma Woodhouse (played by the elegant Gwyneth Paltrow) is
merely attractive and rich.  I rather hoped through the film that there
might be some semblance of a morality tale here and Emma's meddling
would lead to her not getting her Mr. Right.  Of course, that is not
Austen's style and in the end Austen arranges that there is no
permanent damage done by Emma.</P>
<P>     Mr. Right in this case is Mr. Knightly (played by Jeremy Northam),
Emma's sister's brother-in-law.  And Knightly really is knightly.  He
is the voice of conscience and the advocate of restraint ("Better to be
without sense than misapply it as you do.") as Emma goes madly running
about trying to run the lives of all her friends.  Her best friend is
Harriet Smith (Toni Collette), afflicted with just average looks.  And
worse, she is afflicted with a friend like Emma.  The persuasive Emma
has decided that a local farmer who is interested in Harriet is not
good enough to marry Harriet.  Emma decides to quash that match and to
instead set up a marriage with Reverend Elton, the local rector.  Soon
two eligible unmarrieds come on the scene.  One is the callow Frank
Churchill (Ewan McGregor of TRAINSPOTTING), stepson of Emma's governess
and confidant.  The other is Jane Fairfax (Polly Walker, who had far
more engaging roles in ENCHANTED APRIL and RESTORATION), niece of the
region's second ranking busybody.  Soon all the wrong people are
attracted to all the wrong people from Emma's point of view.</P>
<P>     The novel was adapted to the screen and then directed by Douglas
McGrath and some of the film has some undeniably witty moments.  The
acting is all sufficiently convincing.  Gwyneth Paltrow looks
extraordinarily long-necked and elegant.  Jeremy Northam would look
very good except for the fashions of the day that seemed to go in for
extraordinarily large hats and other exaggerated clothing features.  It
is something of a surprise to see Greta Scacchi in a smaller role as
the ex-governess.  Also a familiar face is Juliet Stevenson of TRULY
MADLY DEEPLY in a small role.  More than once I found the sets
upstaging the action with apple-filled harvest scenes, Christmas party
scenes, crocheting rings, and views of odd decorations on yard
furniture.  In fact, there is little in this film that is not top-notch
but the story itself.  (I have to admit, I did like the film better
than the recent CLUELESS, loosely based on the same novel.  But at
least there it was easier to like the main character in CLUELESS
because the results of her actions would have been less permanent.)
The only thing really wrong with EMMA is Emma herself.  With a main
character that there was some reason to care about, this could have
been a much better film.  I give it a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
