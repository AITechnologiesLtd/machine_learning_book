<PRE>                                PINOCCHIO
                       A film review by Eric Walker
                        Copyright 1992 Eric Walker</PRE>
<P>     Without a doubt, the best movie you could see in the theatre this
summer--indeed, almost amy summer--is the re-release of Walt Disney's
PINOCCHIO.  I know it's a cliche to say this, but this time it's true:
they don't make movies like this anymore.</P>
<P>     Walt Disney's greatest animated feature films were FANTASIA and
PINOCCHIO, yet neither of them proved to be the big box-office hit
that SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS was.  Over the years, of course,
PINOCCHIO has since come into its own, but until now, we have rarely
if ever had a chance to see it the way it was meant to be seen: in the
theatre.  While this movie was released on video several years ago (and
is widely available in rental stores), seeing it on your TV screen just
isn't the same.  Some movies deserve to be on the big screen, and
PINOCCHIO is one of them.</P>
<P>     Everything about this movie is perfect.  The animation is awe-
inspiring, and the opening sequence in Gepetto's toy shop is one of the
finest animated sequences ever filmed--probably topped only by the
"Nutcracker Suite" segment of FANTASIA.  To think that the Disney
artists did all this by hand, with no help at all from computers...it
staggers the imagination.  Disney's achievement is even more impressive
when one realizes that what we see on the screen is not what the Disney
Studios first began with.  Five months into the production of
PINOCCHIO, Walt Disney was unsatisfied with the result of his studio's
work, and he shut down production to make major changes.  Essentially,
Disney started the production of this movie over from scratch, throwing
out hundreds of thousands of dollars of completed material.  No studio
today would be so quality-conscious as to abandon a completed
production; the lost money would be considered a waste, and more than
likely the studio would try to work the old footage in with the new in
order to save it.  (Look at ALIEN 3--this was a patchwork job to end
all patchworks.)  But as happened so often in his life, Disney's gamble
paid off.  PINOCCHIO is one of those few works that can genuinely be
called a Masterpiece.</P>
<P>     Who can forget the first appearance of the Blue Fairy?  Who isn't
moved when he hears the immortal song "When You Wish Upon A Star"?
Gepetto's kindly old father figure is never tiresome, even when he acts
foolish; Figaro the cute little kitten is a charmer (and never treacly
cute).  This was the movie that forever associated the phrase "Jiminy
Cricket" with Disney--and indeed, Jiminy is more of a world-wise soul
here than in many of his later appearances.  (And he's surprisingly
lecherous, too!)  And Pinocchio, the little wooden puppet who falls for
temptation, is charmingly naive.  We all remember these characters, and
here's your chance to remember why we love them all.</P>
<P>     However, parents taking very young children to the theatre should
be warned:  In PINOCCHIO, as in no other Disney movie, Disney gives us
the dark side of this fairy tale, and his vision is so intense that
young children could easily be frightened.  Leonard Maltin describes the
movie: "If SNOW WHITE was a fairy tale laced with moments of terror,
PINOCCHIO was an extended nightmare with occasional humorous
interludes."  Never again after PINOCCHIO did Disney allow such moments
of danger and terror into his movies--and they suffered as a result.
The transformation of Lampwick into a jackass is genuinely chilling, and
the final chase with Monstro the Whale is one of the most terrifying
moments in motion picture history.  When I saw this movie in the
theatre, some little children started screaming during the finale--and
Pinocchio's death scene sent them over the edge.  Gepetto's mourning for
Pinocchio is truly heartfelt.  I've seen PINOCCHIO several times now,
and this final scene still brings tears to my eyes.  It's probably the
most heart-touching death scene ever filmed--a feat that wouldn't be
equalled until E.T.  died, over forty years later.</P>
<P>     Some parents may hesitate to let their children see PINOCCHIO,
because their children may be too sensitive for it.  I personally
believe that this is the perfect movie for any child to see--if he or
she is ready for it.  All too often, makers of so-called "children's
movies" hesitate to add strong emotional sequences because they're
afraid to frighten the kids.  Even Disney fell into this trap of
self-censorship with such movies as PETER PAN, where Captain Hook
gives Peter a bomb instead of poisoning his milk, and where Hook escapes
at the end instead of being eaten by the crocodile.  Kids are far more
resilient than many people think they are, and while they may be scared
by PINOCCHIO, they certainly won't be scarred for life by this movie.
In fact, the very way in which PINOCCHIO presents the terrors of the
real world to children--being led from the straight and narrow path by
strangers, learning the consequences of getting into trouble--makes it
a genuine learning experience for youngsters, as well as being
tremendous entertainment.</P>
<P>     So I say, let the children see PINOCCHIO.  This is one of the
greatest movies ever made.  It's heart-warming, funny, exciting, and
terrifying--and they just don't make movies like this anymore.</P>
