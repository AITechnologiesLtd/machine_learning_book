                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1991 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  Very strange but supremely well-crafted
     film from Joel and Ethan Coen.  The Coen Brothers have the
     best batting average in Hollywood.  They have made four films
     and each of the four is highly recommended.  During a bout of
     writer's block (which they obviously got over) writing
     MILLER'S CROSSING they wrote this strange film about a young
     playwright facing writer's block in Hollywood.  Great
     performances, great photography, strange film.  Rating: +3
     (-4 to +4).  (Spoiler follows the main body of this review.)</P>
<P>     Joel and Ethan Coen have managed to do what no other American film
makers have been able to do.  Even Woody Allen turns out the occasional
misfire.  Allen is extremely creative and the really creative take chances.
Sometimes they win, sometimes they lose.  The Coen Brothers have made four
films: BLOOD SIMPLE, RAISING ARIZONA, MILLER'S CROSSING, and now BARTON
FINK.  Each has been a totally original film and each has been spell-
binding.  They have made four winners out of four.  If they made TEXAS
CHAINSAW MASSACRE 6, every tuxedoed film critic in the country would be
waiting in hushed excitement to see TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE 6.  Well, the
concept of a chainsaw film at least sounds like it might have some action.
But the idea of a comedy-drama about writer's block sounds like it is asking
too much of even the Coen Brothers.  What could be less cinematic than
writer's block?  It is something that is internal and creates no visual
sparks for the viewer.  Well, believe it or not, the Coen Brothers have made
a fascinating and entertaining film about writer's block.</P>
<P>     In the early 1940s, a great new social playwright, Barton Fink (played
by John Turturro) has had his first play produced.  It is a moving story
about the sort of fishmongers he saw around his home on Fulton Street in New
York.  For a moment he has fame and that is just what he does not need.  A
Hollywood studio chief who has never seen his play wants the status of
having Fink writing his pictures.  With the force of big money he plucks
Fink out of New York and lays him down in Hollywood.  Fink has a tremendous
fire in his belly to help humanity ("What do you do for a living?"  "I try
to make a difference.").  But instead of a social drama he is given the task
of writing a wrestling film for Wallace Beery, much like Clifford Odets
wrote GOLDEN BOY.</P>
<P>     Fink looks at Hollywood like a baby looking through the bars of a crib,
with a combination of amazement and a lack of comprehension.  It was as if
he had suddenly been transported to another world.  So that he will not lose
touch with the common man he decides not to stay in glitzy Hollywood hotels,
but at the economical and just slightly sleezy Hotel Earle.  The Earle is
just beginning to fall apart and boasts a staff that looks like the living
dead.  There in his room Fink sits trying to write a great film to make a
difference for the common man--which will also be a wrestling picture for
Wallace Beery.</P>
<P>     One paragraph comes out of his typewriter and then nothing.  His
overwhelming drive to write is blocked by a symphony of minutiae.  His room
seems to become a living breathing creature.  Some law of conservation
maintains always exactly one mosquito in the room. The walls digest the glue
that holds on the wallpaper.  Then there is Charlie Meadows.  John Goodman
plays Charlie Meadows, who starts as a distraction, a noisy neighbor, and
becomes Barton's only friend and confidante.  Barton writes about the common
man, but we get the feeling he has never really known one, in spite of his
Fulton Street origins.  Barton's play was literary and eloquent, but not
very realistic.  Charlie *is* the common man.  The two make a stark
contrast.  Barton pulls everything he has inward in a tighter and tighter
ball--even his hair seems tense.  In contrast, Charlie lets everything out.
He is outspoken; he oozes sweat and occasionally pus.  His belly bulges and
casually rolls out and over the top of his pants.  And Barton is fascinated
by the casual, unashamed animalness of his new friend.  The scene shifts
from his hours in the hotel trying to write and talking to Charlie to the
weird alien world of the Hollywood studio.  The studio life is back-stabbing
politics (it is Barton's bad luck that the studio boss likes him, we are
told and later come to believe).  At the studio we meet weird people with
whom Barton hilariously fails to connect.  And Barton meets W. P. Mayhew,
one of America's great writers, who has in recent years been sucked dry by
Hollywood like a fly in a spider web.  He meets and is attracted to Audrey
Taylor, Mayhew's highly personal secretary.  And thereby hangs a tale.</P>
<P>     Many of the faces in BARTON FINK will be familiar to most viewers.
Turturro is here in his second Coen Brothers film.  His role as Bernie in
their MILLER'S CROSSING will probably be the one for which he will be best
remembered in years to come, though this performance probably equals that
one.  Another respected film maker, Spike Lee, has featured Turturro in no
less than three films.  John Goodman is also a repeat Coen Brothers actor,
having played Gale Snopes in RAISING ARIZONA.  He is, of course, well known
for theater, film, and television work.  Michael Lerner and John Polito (the
latter of MILLER'S CROSSING) are incredibly boorish and weird as the studio
chief and his favorite yes-man.  Judy Davis of MY BRILLIANT CAREER, A
PASSAGE TO INDIA, and the recent IMPROMPTU plays Audrey Taylor.</P>
<P>     Coen Brothers' films are strong on good dialogue, but they also have a
marvelous visual style that perfectly creates an atmosphere.  As with
MILLER'S CROSSING, their period feel in BARTON FINK is almost too rich to be
believed.  Here they bring us a  sepia-toned 1940s worlds.  The credits are
shown over brown 1940s wallpaper that prepares us for the claustrophobic
story to come.  When we see the hotel room itself, it is decorated with
perfectly placed slabs of light--sunlight reflected off dust in the air.  It
is a pleasure to watch a film as carefully crafted as this one.  Peculiarly,
there is one very bad continuity error and one it is hard to imagine was
missed in the editing.  Toward the end of the film we see a man in a
military uniform.  The ribbons on his chest seem securely in place and
falling off in alternate shots.  That one surprising fluff aside, this film
is a visual marvel.  Academy Awards are really deserved here.</P>
<PRE>     BARTON FINK really is the best new film I have seen this year and well
worth seeing.  I give it a +3 on the -4 to +4 scale.</PRE>
<PRE>     [Spoilers follow.]</PRE>
<P>     My first reaction after seeing Barton Fink was that watching this film
was like watching an expert gymnast on a trampoline who jumped just
perfectly but came down wrong.  When this story seems to be slowing down
late in the film, it is only to allow it to make an acute left turn, one
shockingly unexpected.  On consideration, I think that is a sort of self-
referential touch.  The most common and banal of genres in Hollywood today
is the psychotic killer film.  BARTON FINK is a psycho-killer film as it
would have been written by Barton Fink.  Fink knew he was writing a
wrestling film all along but kept the wrestling to a minimum and even then
wanted to do a different take on wrestling.  That is just what the Coen
Brothers do with the psycho-killer plot.  Alfred Hitchcock showed a psycho-
killer film could become a genuine classic.  It took the Coen Brothers to
make one good enough to win the Golden Palm at Cannes.</P>
