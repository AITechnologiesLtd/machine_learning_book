<P>   When a young man's fancy lightly turns to love, before he
pops the question he'd better realize that he's marrying not
only one woman but the girl's whole family.  If the lucky
woman is a first-born, daddy's little girl, and has enjoyed a
solid relationship with her father, that's a good sign for the
most part.  A woman's relationship with her dad is a
barometer of her future life with her young man.  On the
other hand, a father with a strong personality who thinks that
no one is good enough for his lovely daughter can put a
crimp in marriage plans, particularly if the family is of a
different class or ethnic/religious background.  Such a
situation could produce a yarn that brings tears to the eyes
("Romeo and Juliet" or could be the basis of a story of
unmitigated charm ("Annie Hall").  In "Meet the Parents," Jay
Roach employs a script by Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg
(taken from a story by Greg Glienna and Mary Ruth Clarke)
to bring on a steady stream of audience laugh with the
obligatory sentimental ending.  "Meet the Parents" is just
intermittently laugh-out-loud (for a better movie this season
take in Christopher Guest's "Best in Show") but given the
difficulty of extracting howls from a sophisticated audience,
"Meet the Parents" meets the standards of good, dependable
humor.</P>
<P>   Jay Roach milks the comedic effects of a meeting between
a potential father-in-law from hell and a young man who is a
bit of a shnook--as well as a member of class and culture
distinct from the dad.  Peter James's camera focusses in a
male nurse Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) as he practices a
marriage proposal on a patient in the ICU, later picking up
with fiance Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo) who has just taught a
class in meditation to some bright-looking first-graders.  They
take off from Chicago to her parents' picture-perfect home
outside New York City as Greg--having lost his luggage has
one strike against him while his name, Focker, is strike two--
meets the parents.  Since old money, WASPish Jack Byrnes
(Robert De Niro) is so overprotective of his daughter that he
once rejected her all-American suitor Kevin Rawley (Owen
Wilson), Greg seems not to have a chance--despite his
acceptance by Jack's considerably warmer and more
embracing wife, Dina (Blythe Danner).</P>
<P>   The gags are principally of the slapstick variety, the most
prominent occurring when Greg, desperately trying to capture
Jack's beloved Himalayan cat who has fled from the house,
climbs after the feline on the roof thereby releasing a Rube
Goldberg string of mishaps that barely avoids gutting the
entire house.   Other sources of physical humor are located
within the intense volleyball game played inside the Byrnes'
swimming pool and the sewage-laden flood which Greg
creates throughout the backyard lawn when he flushes a
malfunctioning toilet, while the more verbal chuckles come
from a lie detector test that Jack administers to his
prospective son-in-law and the good-natured dialogue
between Greg and Pam's multi-talented and strikingly
handsome former suitor Kevin.</P>
<P>   Robert De Niro shows once again his ability to do schtick
as well as he can perform in shadier roles by setting intricate
and sometimes devastating traps to find an excuse to get rid
of Pam's latest suitor.  For his part Ben Stiller plays
beautifully against the older man who comes from a different
world and evokes laughs even when simply standing still
while obeying the schoolmarmish commands of an airline
boarding agent.  When the jokes work, the picture is on
target, but many of the gags seem written for TV as we wait
vainly for a laugh-track to kick in.</P>
<P>   Robert De Niro, having already proved his ability to do 
shtick in "Analyze This," furthers his breadth as a comic artist 
while Ben Stiller--who can deliver laughs simply by standing 
sheepishly and wordlessly just beyond a airline boarding
ramp at the schoomarmish instructions of a ditzy reception
agent--is De Niro's match.  (Recall Stiller's performance in a
similar vein as a rabbi confronting his best friend, a priest, in
"Keeping the Faith").  Teri Polo provides good support as a
female straight man in a comedy that works for the most part
while in other sections has the audience waiting for a TV
laugh track that doesn't come. </P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running time: 108 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
