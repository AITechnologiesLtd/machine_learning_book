<P>     SHOOTING FISH is a feather-light comedy about a pair of "likable" 
con men whose plans to live the good life are knocked off track by bad 
timing and an unexpected romance.  While the British release, which 
probably has aspirations of connecting with the FOUR WEDDINGS AND A 
FUNERAL crowd, offers an occasional worthwhile joke, it's ultimately so 
lacking in substance that it becomes difficult to care about anyone or 
anything.  The probable argument in favor of SHOOTING FISH is that the 
movie generates a warm, fuzzy feeling.  My response to this is to note 
that the only ones likely to experience such a sense of muted bliss are 
those who turn off their brains.  The film is preposterous to the point 
of distraction, where the necessary level of suspension of disbelief 
exceeds the capacity of a normal, thinking person.  The approach would 
be forgivable if the movie was genuinely funny or otherwise endearing, 
but moments of laughter and charm are infrequent and widely-spaced.</P>
<P>     Con men often make for delightful motion picture protagonists, 
because their presence allows screenwriters to devise all sorts of 
intricate moves in various games of deception.  Alas, that's not the 
case here.  The heroes are Dylan (Dan Futterman) and Jez (Stuart 
Townsend), and, although they have devoted their lives to bilking rich 
people out of money, their schemes are so banal that it's understandable 
if a viewer loses interest.  Even the opening gambit, with the pair 
selling a "voice-activated computer," isn't remotely credible.  And it's 
hard to feel any sympathy for the victims, who are either (a) nasty men 
getting what's coming to them, (b) gullible fools who deserve to be 
ripped off, or (c) both.</P>
<P>     Theoretically, Dylan and Jez are in the con business because it's 
the fastest way to make the two million pounds they need to buy a big 
mansion.  In reality, that's just an excuse for their lifestyle of 
adrenaline-generating close shaves.  As Georgie (Kate Beckinsale), their 
secretary-turned-accomplice-turned love interest notes, they're 
"compulsive risk-takers who thrive on danger."  Of course, hanging out 
with Dylan and Jez has an effect on her, and it's not long before she 
too catches the bug and is flirting with the law in order to swindle 
money out of a thoroughly despicable, filthy rich victim.</P>
<P>     Dan Futterman (Robin Williams' son in THE BIRDCAGE) plays Dylan, an 
American in London, with a certain oily charm.  Supposedly, there's a 
heart lurking beneath his slick exterior, but it's not often in 
evidence.  Stuart Townsend is Dylan's partner, Jez, a technical wizard 
with no social skills.  In the glorious tradition of motion picture 
nerds, he gets hopelessly tongue-tied around women.  The third member of 
the trio, and the one with the most spark, is Kate Beckinsale.  With her 
dark hair cropped short, Beckinsale looks different than in her previous 
roles, which include Hero in Kenneth Branagh's MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING 
and the lead in John Schlesinger's COLD COMFORT FARM.  </P>
<P>     Watching SHOOTING FISH is a lot like drinking carbonated water.  
There's a little bit of fizz, and the sensation isn't unpleasant, but 
the whole experience fails to offer much satisfaction.  SHOOTING FISH is 
a harmless dud, and any minor pleasure it generates vanishes so quickly 
that it's hard to believe it was actually there in the first place.  The 
movie frequently treads a line between being marginally engaging and 
painfully trite.  Unfortunately, when all is said and done, a majority 
of the scenes fall in the latter camp rather than in the former.  </P>
