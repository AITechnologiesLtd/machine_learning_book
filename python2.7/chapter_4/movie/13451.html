<PRE>A Film Review by Mark O'Hara</PRE>
<P>At the cineplex on Sunday, the sexes were segregated.</P>
<P>My wife took our ten year-old daughter to see MADELINE, while I 
accompanied our 13 year-old son into the theater showing SMALL SOLDIERS.  
The separation was as predictable as Happy Meals:  who would want the 
mini-Barbie, and who got the slick Hot Wheels?</P>
<P>The film does have parts interesting to boys and girls alike.  The early 
teen Alan Abernathy (Gregory Smith) develops a fast infatuation with 
Christy Fimple, the girl next door who happens to be dating another, 
older boy with a motorcycle.  The boy-meets-and-then-rescues-girl 
scenario is one of the more engaging subplots in the film.  Dunst 
delivers a smooth performance, whether she is watching her little 
brother or fighting off her own "Gwendy" dolls, which have been 
transmogrified into half-melted, hair-raising drones.  Smith is also 
very likable in his role, especially when he is careful not to overact 
when an action figure he's brought home begins impossibly to interact 
with him.  Characterization is the aspect in which Alan Abernathy falls 
short.  The writers decided to add to his character a dimension that 
does not work.  Alan has a questionable history;  he's been expelled 
from two schools and his parents apparently have moved here to escape 
the ignominy.  But we see no motivation for the boy's past behavior;  we 
never understand what has caused his mischievous history, so the honor 
and bravery he ultimately shows never change the viewer's mind about 
Alan.  We always like him.</P>
<P>My son had the most fun watching the "Elite Commandos," the grotesquely 
grinning grunts hopped up on Defense Department microchips, the gimmicky 
toys that Dreamworks SKG hopes will sell well in stores and fast-food 
joints.  In the film the figures come alive at their owner's voice. We 
first meet the intelligent toys when Alan cons his friendly delivery man 
to leave a complete set (six Commandos, six "Gorgonites") at his absent 
father's toy store.  Not until he brings home Archer does he realize 
that, when you play with these toys, they play back.  Soon the Gorgonite 
leader Archer, speaking in Frank Langella's deep and gentle voice, shows 
us that these monsters have been cast against type.  They may be 
hideous, but they are also goofy and lovable, rascally and noble.  And 
they are the targets of the programmed wrath of the soldiers.</P>
<P>Chip Hazard (voice of Tommy Lee Jones) leads with an amoral abandon I 
have not seen since Robert Duvall's army officer in APOCALYPSE NOW.  
What is interesting in the depiction of these G. I. Joes for the new 
century is their dual nature.  They seem like cool, all-time exciting 
toys, while they also subtly attack the sensibilities of violence.  If 
the movie makes any political statement, it is that our culture demands 
entertainment (including toys and movies) that glorifies violence, while 
we simultaneously admire justice and gentleness.  But I give too much 
credit.  The special effects are seamless, as good as those in TOY STORY 
because of the added facet of live action.  They work because they bring 
off the wonderful exaggeration of the plot:  playthings turned bad, 
searching Dad's workbench for weapons, adapting Black and Decker and 
Craftsman into war machines.  The voices under Lee's command are 
masterful, albeit part of an inside joke.  Ernest Borgnine, Jim Brown, 
Clint Walker, George Kennedy - fragments of "The Dirty Dozen"!  If only 
we got to hear them more!</P>
<P>As Gil Mars, owner of Globotech, Denis Leary is cold but not sinister 
enough.  His company has gobbled up Heartland Toys and caused the 
creation of the Commandos and Gorgonites, along with the conflicts that 
will no doubt affect the humans around them.  What Mr. Mars teaches 
young viewers is that, if you cut a big enough check, you can appease 
the anger even of decent people, including Alan's father.  Director Joe 
Dante should have instructed Leary to act more menacing and less 
indifferent.  Or cast one of the original "Dozen" in person to show us 
how badness is done.  Perhaps Borgnine could have reprised his role in 
FROM HERE TO ETERNITY.</P>
<P>When Joe Dante worked on GREMLINS in the early 80's, he oversaw one of 
the early films rated PG-13.  I can recall seeing a need for the rating 
when I noticed too many small children in the theater.  They loved the 
violence, the frenetic action and irreverent potty jokes.  It was easy 
to notice the way the movie, before our very eyes, desensitized the 
children to these examples of crudeness.  It was probably then that my 
wife and I recognized the rating system meant what it said about age.  </P>
<P>The darkness of many scenes in SMALL SOLDIERS, paired with the violence 
and a few obscene phrases, makes the film unsuitable for a ten year-old, 
male or female.  Unfortunately, it is easier to shush loud movie-goers 
than it is to scold parents who have dragged their twin four year-olds 
to a PG-13.</P>
