<PRE>L.A. Confidential (1997)
A film review by Steve Lipson</PRE>
<P>Justice Remains Elusive in Excellent `L.A. Confidential'</P>
<P>It is Los Angeles in the 1950's, and the LAPD has just launched a campaign
to root out corruption in its ranks and make the police department `a force
you can be proud of.' This climate provides the backdrop for Curtis
Hanson's excellent new film `L.A. Confidential,' a crime drama which
examines the lives of three LAPD detectives as they attempt to unravel the
mystery of a massacre in the Nite Owl cafeteria. What seems in the first
hour of the movie as a largely open-and-shut case soon reveals itself as
just one small element of an elaborate conspiracy, but such a
transformation should surprise no one familiar with the works of James
Ellroy, on whose novel this movie is based.</P>
<P>Ellroy, an acclaimed author of crime fiction, specializes in stories with
deeply-flawed protagonists, and the detectives of the LAPD prove no
exception. Each sees the duty of a police officer as the promotion of
justice, but each cop's understanding of the term is as complex as the
characters themselves. To Lt. Ed Exley (Guy Pearce), justice entails doing
consistently what is right, but his nemesis Sgt. Bud White (Russell Crowe)
believes that an officer fulfills his duty as long as the ends justify the
means. Some cops use the word as a cover-up for their nefarious schemes,
while others--like Sgt. Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey)--have become so jaded
that justice no longer has any meaning for them at all. But as the three
main characters delve deeper into the Nite Owl Massacre, they soon find
their cherished values tested more than they could ever imagine.</P>
<P>`L.A. Confidential' is thus at its heart focused on character development,
yet it is to the great credit of director Curtis Hanson that his movie can
be appreciated on many levels. The frequent gun battles should please any
action fan, while admirers of suspenseful crime dramas will find that
Hanson keeps the tension level high through effective and sinister use of
music and lighting. But in a movie based on characterization, it should
come as no surprise that the acting is what stands out most. In a large
ensemble cast, Pearce, Crowe, and Spacey prove particularly effective in
their challenging roles, which require that subtle transformations in
personality be conveyed chiefly through body language and facial
expressions. In the end, the three detectives have changed considerably,
but they remain as morally ambiguous as ever. Many in the audience, though,
will accept that justice has been served. Perhaps our own cherished beliefs
remain just as conflicted as those of the LAPD.</P>
