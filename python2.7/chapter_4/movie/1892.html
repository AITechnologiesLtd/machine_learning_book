                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1993 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  This is an old plot dusted off and
     given some new life and a little bit of political bite.
     Kevin Kline plays a double for the President who is asked to
     be President.  The film is pleasant with a few emotional
     moments.  Rating: high +1 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     The basic concept of the plot is an old and familiar one.  A commoner
looks just like a famous person and suddenly finds he must replace that
person.  Coming up with examples is almost a trivia game itself: THE PRINCE
AND THE PAUPER, THE PRISONER OF ZENDA, Robert Heinlein's DOUBLE STAR,
KAGEMUSHA, MOON OVER PARADOR.  If you want to press the point, there's also
RETURN OF MARTIN GUERRE and SOMMERSBY.  The underrated science fiction film
QUEST FOR LOVE treats some of the problems of standing in as realistically
as many films more grounded in reality.  Many of the recent body-switch
films also treat the subject.  Of course, to make one of these stories
believable the writer has to come up with some contrivance as to why the
shape of the ear does not give the imposter away.  As Sherlock Holmes
correctly points out, the shape of an ear is as unique as a fingerprint.
Certainly somebody photographed as often as the President of the United
States is could not long be replaced by an imposter.  However, that is the
premise of DAVE.</P>
<P>     Dave Kovic (played by Kevin Kline) is an exact look-alike for President
Bill Mitchell (played by guess who?).  Dave runs a small temporary
employment office and occasionally picks up dollars impersonating the
President doing things like riding a pig at places like local car
dealerships.  Then one day the Secret Service shows up in Dave's living room
asking Dave to impersonate the President at a social function.  (Even this
seems very implausible in a world where one wrong comment can ruin a
politician's career.) The President is needed elsewhere.  The elsewhere is
an illicit tryst with one of his aides, and unfortunately the President
suffers a massive stroke.  At the urging of two aides (played by Frank
Langella and Kevin Dunn), Dave agrees to continue his role as the President.</P>
<P>     Dave quickly finds out that President Mitchell was nobody to admire.  A
small group of people are running the Presidency for power and greed.
Finding that the First Lady (played by Sigourney Weaver) detests the
President, Kovic decides to change policies.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the biggest surprise of DAVE is the performance of Frank
Langella.  Getting past the age when he can play dashing roles such as Zorro
and Dracula, he is turning to acting.  In a bleached crewcut he quietly
steals scenes from Kline and Weaver.  He has learned  the difference between
acting hammy and having an expressive face.  Like Frederic March before him,
he has made the transition from depending on his good looks to having an
expressive face that is a study in itself.  It seems even director Ivan
Reitman underrates the power of Langella's acting.  In one notable scene
Reitman has the camera focused on Kline in the foreground.  He then sets the
focus deeper to pick up a reaction from Langella in the background, then
again focuses on Kline to give him the viewer's attention.  But once the
viewer's eye is on Langella it stays on Langella through the scene, even
though he is now out of focus.  Reitman has underrated the interest and
magnetism of Langella's expression.  Kline plays his usual amiable self.
Weaver does what she can with a role that gives her very little to do until
late in the film.</P>
<P>     DAVE is a light, pleasant film in the style of Frank Capra that may be
a bit politically simplistic.  The view that there is corruption in high
places is undoubtedly true, but the view that a simple non-politician using
intuition could do better than an elected President is questionable.  There
is some hypocrisy in this populist pseudo-President who wants programs that
will increase Federal spending but who at the same time cheats on his own
taxes--a rather wry touch in Gary Ross's script.</P>
<P>     Still, it is fun to see over two dozen celebrities and commentators on
government affairs commenting on this new President.  The most enjoyable
cameo features Oliver Stone.  And one more nice touch: Kline's rendition of
the song "Tomorrow" from "Annie" is the first time I could ever make out all
the words.</P>
<P>     While not startingly original, DAVE is fun and well-made.  I give it a
high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
