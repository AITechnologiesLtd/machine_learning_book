<PRE>GRAND ILLUSION (1937)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Jean Renoir
Writers: Jean Renoir and Charles Spaak
Starring: Jean Gabin, Pierre Fresnay, Marcel Dalio, Julien Carette,
Erich von Stroeheim, Georges Peclet, Dita Parlo</P>
<P>Jean Renoir's "Grand Illusion" is pretty much unanimously praised as one
of the greatest films ever made, as well as one of the greatest war
movies.  But why is a film that seems like an arty french old version of
"Hogan's Heroes" and "The Great Escape" so amazingly praised?  Well, for
one it's a lot more structured and complex than a "Hogan's Heroes"
episode, and makes a wonderful statement about war.  I mean, this film
is so deceptively complex that the laserdisc we saw it on had a track
for a guy to narrate everything that goes on as the film plays (we
turned him off).</P>
<P>In" Grand Illusion," it's just before the first World War, and a couple
of french pilots (Jean Gabin and Pierre Fresnay) are shot down over
Germany, and subsequently taken into a POW camp.  The weird thing about
this film is not only is this the only real instance of war we see, but
that the german who shot them down (Erich von Stroeheim, who would later
star in "Sunset Boulevard" - the movie) actually invites them to a
dinner before they are hauled out to the prisoner camp.  "The Hanoi
Hilton" this is not.</P>
<P>The various prisoners quickly get to know eachother, and form a bit of
comraderie.  In the camp are a varied group of people: Lieutenant
Marechal (Gabin), a French plebian; the French aristocrat de Boeldieu
(Fresnay), who kind of isolates himself from the others; a hyperactive
actor (Julien Carette); and French jew Rosenthal (Marcel Dalio).  They
work on some escape tactics, but never go too far, sometimes getting
cold feet someway through, and usually getting cut off by the germans.</P>
<P>We follow some of them as they go to another POW camp, this time in a
giant castle, and headed by none other than the German soldier who fed
them after he shot them down (von Stroheim).  The film follows them
working on some more escape attempts, as well as building a
wonderfully-crafted relationship between the von Stroeheim character and
the Fresnay one.  They seem to be the two most alike characters in the
film, and the only difference seems to be their nationalities.</P>
<P>"Grand Illusion" paints a kind of surrealistic world where the soldiers
actually realize that they're all part of the same race, but are trapped
by nationalities and "duties."  A powerful moment towards the end
perfectly illustrates this, causing one of the few very sad moments in
the film, which is often mounted in some good old character comedy,
though not like a sitcom (this is the last time I mention "Hogan's
Heroes").  The very final scene is also poignantly representing what the
film is trying to prove.</P>
<P>What's cool about this film is you hardly even know there's a war going
on.  If you missed the beginning, you probably wouldn't even know
they're prisoners of War.  This makes sure that they can build up the
characters, and create parallelisms between the prisoners and their
german captors.  The film paints a world where everyone is kind to one
another, although they are somtimes held back by their nationality.</P>
<P>Even for those of you who would think a 30s french film about POWs would
be boring, "Grand Illusion" is not what you're gonna find.  It's an
always fascinating flick to watch, filled with a great sense of humor
that never makes this overly surreal, a dramatic edge which never feels
forced, and emotion that never feels hokey or melodramatic.  The ending
is brilliantly done, with a scene which might never really take place,
but it's a film, and it's trying to make a point.</P>
<P>"Grand Illusion" is one of the greatest films ever made, and a trend
setter in the tradition of the sub-sub-subgenre of POW camp films, like
"The Great Escape."  And it's a lot more complex than I originally
thought it was, making me want to see it again just so I can concentrate
more on the film's subtexts.  A good POW camp film is a horrible thing
to waste, and this is the best one of those I've ever seen.</P>
