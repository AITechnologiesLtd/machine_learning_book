<P>Woody Allen's first foray into the cinematic world of musicals, once
again boasts a cast full of brand names from Hollywood, and Woody's
ever-present comedic genius.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Musical that presents us with the ups and downs of a rich family from
New York. They travel to Paris and Venice, and introduce us to their
love lives through the international language of gab and music. </P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Upbeat musical that works on some entertainment-value levels, but fails
to delve into anything of great motivation for the audience to fully
enjoy. This film is your basic Allen comedy (Standardized with the
continually funny one-liners..."I should go to Paris and jump off of
the Eiffel Tower. If I took the Concorde, I could be dead three hours
earlier."), but with much less character development, and much more
songs sung by the cast. I personally am not a fan of musicals, so I
must admit that I was somewhat surprised that I semi-enjoyed this
movie. I mean, it wasn't like EVITA, where the actors sung their lines
throughout the entire movie. These songs were nice and lively, and
introduced only when needed (Although I must admit that I could've done
without the Woodster's awful crooning, and Julia Roberts' brave attempt
at carrying a tune.)</P>
<P>Overall, the actors were very good, like every other Allen movie, with
Alda, Hawn and Tim Roth sticking out in my mind as the standouts (Mind
you, as per usual, I didn't care for the Barrymore performance.) The
scenery shots were beautiful, especially the fall and winter snapshots
of New York, and the Venician and Parisian vignettes. The ending was a
bit weak, but then again, the entire story line wasn't really much to
get excited about. Just a bunch of little adventures laced through some
nice music and gorgeous scenery. </P>
<P>Definitely far from my Allen favourites like ANNIE HALL (8.5/10),
BANANAS (8/10) and CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS (8/10), but a continuing
sign of a genius whose only barometer of success lies deep within his
own consciousness and spirit. Keep it up, Woody!! You're the man.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts: 
Goldie Hawn's real name is Goldie Studlendgehawn.
Tracey Ullman filmed several scenes for this film, but all were cut by
Woody to reduce the film's running time.
Woody Allen's real name is Allan Stewart Konigsberg. Word on the street
is that the man speaks fluent French, and that he refuses that watch
any of his own movies once they've been released. One of his funniest
one-liners was ""I'm not afraid of dying...I just don't want to be
there when it happens." He apparently plays a mean clarinet with his
band, every Monday night in a local jazz café in New York City. 
Drew Barrymore made her screen debut as William Hurt's daughter in the
Ken Russell film ALTERED STATES (6.5/10) in 1980. At the age of 7, she
starred in a little movie by Steven Spielberg (her godfather) called
E.T. (8/10), and then spent the next few years going through drug-abuse
and alcoholism. She is half Hungarian from her mother's side, Ildiko
Jade.
Despite his reputation as an actor being firmly established, Tim Roth
still likes to tend bar from time to time. He stands 5"7.
Edward Norton has a degree from Yale in history.<HR>Visit JoBlo's Movie Emporium
