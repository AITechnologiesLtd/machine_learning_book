<PRE>DRACULA 2000
A film review by James Brundage

<P>Well, it's the holiday season and what better way to celebrate than by
sucking everyone dry?  No... it's not your neighborhood Christmas Key
Party, it's Dracula 2000, a gift to all you horror fans for Christmas.</P>
<P>And it's got all of those earmarks of just about every Dracula, a
director no one has heard of (Craven just bankrolled it), a series of
barely recognizable actors, and a feeling of having been shelved for
about four years… oh yeah, and a bunch of religious undertones so the
crew can work through their theological schizophrenia a la Anne Rice.</P>
<P>The film opens in 1892, where we see a ship with all hands dead bound
for London and with Aramaic written on the sails.  Cut to 2000, when a
ragtag band of thieves and morons raid an antiquity dealer's basement
because they don't know what's there.  Even after seeing fanged skull
upon fanged skull and losing two men to booby traps, they decide to take
the silver coffin they find out with them and, after good old Vlad the
Impaler (Gerard Butler) awakens and vampifies everyone, we wind up in
New Orleans.</P>
<P>Of course it's Mardi Gras and ultra-Catholic Goth girl (Justine Waddell)
who works at the Virgin Megastore (Can you say product placement?) finds
herself the object of Drac's affection.  The original vampire hunter
(Christopher Plummer) and his assistant (Jonny Lee Miller) hunt Drac,
and the assistant is falling for Drac's girl.  Needless to say, Vlad
ain't happy.</P>
<P>Unlike most horror flicks, which are content at being a splatterfest and
accepting of their brainlessness, Dracula 2000 opts to be a
Stigmata/lesbian-vampire-flick hybrid which raises more pitiful
religious questions than it gives in entertainment value.  Although it's
set to a metal soundtrack so commercial salespeople hawk it at the door,
even half of the horror fans in my audience went away pissed.  I
probably don't need to tell you at this point, the movie isn't even
worth the time in line for popcorn, let alone in the theatre.</P>
<P>With Dracula calling a Goth music video absolutely brilliant and the
fact that half of the film either features a Virgin Megastore logo or
takes place in the Virgin Megastore, it's pretty clear that Dracula 2000
is a bit more advertisement than art.  Sure, most movies these days are
complete commercials, but they're also pretty slick -- and Dracula 2000
can't even manage to pull that off.  The one thing Dracula 2000 does
have is a monopoly on big-screen bloodsuckers for the time being….  But
don't despair, horror fans: January is only a few days away, and soon
you'll have all the recycled horror you can stomach.</P>
