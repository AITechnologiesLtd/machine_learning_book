<PRE>                           HURRICANE STREETS
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     HURRICANE STREETS tells the story of an amoral group of young New
York City teenagers, who live lives of varying degrees of criminality.
Some draw the line at shoplifting, some at grand theft, others at guns,
and others at much worse crimes.</P>
<P>     Written and directed by the accomplished actor Morgan Freeman, the
film won numerous awards at last year's Sundance Film Festival.  With
the tone and pacing of a slow, coming-of-age story set in the Midwest,
the movie, set instead in an inner city, apparently wants the audience
to be sympathetic to the kids.  The multiracial cast looks like a
carefully chosen cross section of society.  And although the kids live
in relatively poor environments, they act more like middle-class teens.</P>
<P>     Riding little bikes like the ones from ET, the kids go from the
crime scenes to their club house where they keep their loot, to the
elementary school grounds where whey take orders, including sizes, for
yet-to-be purloined goods.  Except that they idle away their days with
various misdemeanors, the kids act like older versions of Spanky and
Our Gang.</P>
<P>     Marcus, played with despair by Brendan Sexton III, is the leader
of the gang.  Marcus is constantly challenged by fellow member Chip
(David Roland Frank), who thinks he is invulnerable -- "I'll never get
caught, man."  Chip prides himself on being the local rebel.  He gets a
tattoo of the finger on his arm, dies his hair a strange color, and
gets a nose ring.  He also has friends who want to push the gang way
beyond their petty larceny.</P>
<P>     Marcus meets a sweet girl of 14 named Melena, played sweetly by
Isidra Vega, whom he invites to his fifteenth birthday party.  Her
abusive father -- you can guess that he will be bad because he wears a
prominent gold cross -- keeps Melena on a tight leash and will not let
her go to the party or anywhere at night.</P>
<P>     The script tries to pull at your heart strings at every turn.  We
find that Marcus loves his mother, but she's in prison.  The exact
nature of her crime is another reason for his melancholy.</P>
<P>     The kids view stealing goods from shoes to candy bars with the
same casualness that others might look upon collecting seashells.  The
story provides ample hints that its really not their fault.  They've
been brought up to act this way and don't know any better.  What, for
example, does one of the adults give Marcus for his birthday?  A can of
spray paint so he can deface the local buildings.</P>
<P>     When the cops arrest Marcus for taking orders for stolen goods
from ten-year-olds, he doesn't understand why the police are bothering
him.  "I might have sold a thing or two -- it's not like killing people
or selling drugs," he argues with the officers.</P>
<P>     After meandering for over an hour in a landscape of hopelessness,
out of the blue the show takes an unrealistic but dramatic twist.  The
abrupt ending is equally surprising.  People left the theater at my
screening kind of numb and disinterested.  One hopes that in the future
Freeman will stick to acting, where his talent has few equals.</P>
<P>     HURRICANE STREETS runs just 1:28.  It is rated R for violence and
profanity and would be fine for older teenagers.</P>
