<P>     It seems that hardly a year goes by without a new cinematic 
adaptation of one of Shakespeare's plays, and, of late, Kenneth 
Branagh's name has become intimately entwined with that of the Bard.  
While Branagh, who helmed HENRY V, MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, and is now 
working on HAMLET, does not sit in the director's chair for this latest 
version of OTHELLO, he is very much in evidence on screen in the key 
role of Iago.</P>
<P>     To condense OTHELLO into a reasonable, two-hour running time, 
writer/director Oliver Parker has lopped approximately 50% of 
Shakespeare's original text from the screenplay.  Yet, even with so much 
gone, the movie remains faithful to the play's central themes and 
conflicts, and the streamlined narrative is surprisingly easy to follow 
(well, as "easy" as anything written by Shakespeare can be).  For sheer 
impact, this OTHELLO can stand side-by-side with the versions brought to 
the screen by Orson Welles (as restored in 1992) and Lawrence Olivier.</P>
<P>     Laurence Fishburn plays the Moor Othello, a gifted general who is 
commissioned to confront a Turkish army at Cyprus.  Always by Othello's 
side are his two right-hand men:  Cassio (Nathaniel Parker) and Iago.  
However, for reasons that are never fully explained, Iago is not the 
faithful retainer Othello believes him to be.  In fact, hatred bubbles 
just beneath Iago's cool, rational exterior, and he has put a plan into 
action by which he intends to cause Othello's downfall and shatter the 
relationship between the Moor and his devoted wife, Desdemona (Irene 
Jacob).</P>
<P>     Othello's "tragic flaw" is his jealousy, and it's this quality that 
Iago exploits with his complex scheme.  Much of the audience's ability 
to identify with the characters is dependent upon the trio of central 
performances that grace OTHELLO.  It's an entirely different experience 
to read the play or see a live performance than it is to view a 
cinematic rendition.  The visual aspects of Parker's production are 
especially noteworthy.  OTHELLO is dark, and makes creative use of light 
and shadow as only a motion picture can.</P>
<P>     Laurence Fishburn, a black actor playing the black title role (in 
some of his various other film incarnations, Othello has been essayed by 
the likes of Orson Welles, Lawrence Olivier, and Anthony Hopkins – none 
of whom are black), gives a stirring and powerful interpretation of a 
man haunted by uncertainty about his wife's faithfulness.  Irene Jacob 
(THE DOUBLE LIFE OF VERONIQUE, RED) imbues Desdemona with far more 
vitality than she has had in any other movie version.  Kenneth Branagh, 
perhaps better focused since he's only acting in this piece, makes Iago 
a chillingly rational character whose acerbic asides to the camera draw 
the audience into his plot almost as an accomplice.</P>
<P>     Certain Shakespeare purists will probably dismiss Parker's OTHELLO 
because of its sex scenes and liberal cuts.  Such a reaction might be a 
mistake, however, since this director's view of Othello's tragedy has an 
unusual slant.  Parker is careful to play up the love affair between the 
title character and his wife so that when the inevitable occurs, it has 
a more profound impact.  When Othello declares, "My life upon 
[Desdemona's] faith", you believe him.</P>
<P>     With this version of OTHELLO, Parker wanted to create a 
Shakespearean film that anyone could see, relate to, and enjoy – a 
degree in English literature not being required.  In large part, he has 
accomplished this.  OTHELLO has never been one of my favorite of the 
Bard's plays, but, at times, I found myself engrossed by this 
adaptation.  Using the visual aspects of film to enhance certain story 
elements, Parker has crafted a fine motion picture.</P>
