The Astronaut's Wife</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>This is one weird film. Weird and scary. Scarier than that Witch film,
probably the scariest film I've seen this summer (though it's been a tame
summer on the fright-o-meter). The fine sound engineering does a splendid
job toward this goal.</P>
<P>Lift-off looks promising with a cast of three actors I adore. The simply
irresistible Charlize Theron, rock solid actor Johnny Depp and strong
supporter Joe Morton from "T2" fame. Johnny goes up in space, has an
incident, comes back a little weird, or is it wife Charlize who's paranoid?
A creepy psychological thriller.</P>
<P>Surprise, it's no "Apollo 13." Though the film hooked me heartily in the
beginning, I grew tired in the middle (though scared), and while the twist
ending was indeed something I did not expect at all -- it wasn't something I
cared for either.</P>
<P>Great concept, awesome actors, fine dialogue, but a lack of that right
stuff.</P>
<P>Starring Johnny Depp, Charlize Theron, Joe Morton, Clea Duvall.
Director/Screenwriter Rand Ravich.
Produced by Andrew Lazar at New Line.
Rated R.</P>
<P>Grade..........................B</P>
