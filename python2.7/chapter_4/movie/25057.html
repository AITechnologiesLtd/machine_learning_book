<PRE>ME, MYSELF & IRENE
------------------</PRE>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>The Farrelly Brothers try to push the outer edge of outrageousness they 
established with "There's Something About Mary" in their newest flick "Me,
Myself & Irene."  While it has its moments, they should be thankful they
had the wisdom to reteam with their "Dumb and Dumber" star, Jim Carrey,
because without his talent, this could have been a dismal effort.</P>
<P>Carrey is Charlie, a nice, fastidious Rhode Island state trooper who we're
introduced to in a flashback chronicling his sticky sweet romance and
subsequent wedding.  While his wife (Traylor Howard, TV's "Two Guys and
a Girl") professes to be his soul mate, she falls for their Black midget
limo driver on her wedding day when they both discover they're
Mensa chapter heads after he tries to pin Charlie with a nonexistent 
racial slur.  Charlie never seems to notice when his three sons are all
born Black and loves them unreservedly.  Charlie also gets no respect from
the townsfolk he serves or his newspaper-stealing neighbor.  When Charlie's
wife finally decides to run away with her long-time lover (the kids are
entering college by this time), Charlie snaps and Hank emerges to deal with 
Charlies long supressed rage.</P>
<P>No sooner is Charlie put on medication to control Hank's manic outbursts
(like reciprocating his neighbor's dog's 'lawn presents' personally 
on his neighbor's lawn), then he's tasked with returning Irene (Rene
Zellwegger, "Jerry Maguire"), who's being framed by her ex-boyfriend,
to upstate New York to face trumped up charges.  Of course, the medication
is left behind, Charlie and Hank are both attracted to Irene, and everyone
in their path seems to want to kill them.</P>
<P>This last aspect is perhaps, one of the biggest problems with the screenplay of
"Me, Myself & Irene" (the Farrellys and Mike Cerone), as Irene's problems
with her ex are never clarified, nor is it made clear why so many corrupt
cops and mob guys seem to be involved or why Irene's knowledge deserves
her death warrant.  This run, stop for comedic Charlie/Hank/Irene interlude,
run, stop, run plot mechanic creaks along flatly.  The only saving grace is
that Charlie's three large, extremely smart sons (they argue over physics
homework) figure out he's in trouble and begin a rescue mission which is
returned to occasionally.</P>
<P>Carrey gives a great, manic yet controlled physical performance.  He's ramrod
earnestness as Charlie and leering maniac as Hank.  His transformation from
one to the other, especially initially, is a marvel to behold (and seemed to
foreshadow his transformation into the Grinch, coming later this year).  He
gets all the good lines, romancing Irene with 'your eyes are all squinty and
your mouth's puckered up like you've been sucking on a lemon, but it works.'
If that doesn't describe Zellwegger - perfect!  However, he's also given some
pretty unsavory stuff to work with (particularly with regards to an oversized
sex toy) that verges on just plain distasteful, rather than distastefully
funny (i.e., Mary's hair gel).</P>
<P>Other than Carrey, only the three young actors who play his sons really get
a chance to shine, as they get dad to switch the TV from Gomer Pyle to Richard
Pryor and continue to grow up in a healthily profane manner.  Zellwegger is 
mostly stuck in reactive mode.  Chris Cooper ("American Beauty") is utterly 
wasted as a corrupt cop and plays the role humorously.  Faring slightly better 
is Robert Forster ("Jackie Brown"), who at least emotes with an air of 
cluelessness suitable to the material.</P>
<P>"Me, Myself & Irene" is a disappointment from the Farrelly perspective, but
Carrey fans at least should appreciate his take on the split personality -
the performance is a lot more alive than the Andy Kaufman impersonation he
gave in his previous film.</P>

<PRE>ROBIN:</PRE>
<P>Peter and Bobby Farrelly have made their own imprint on mainstream comedy these
past few years with their debut hit, "Dumb and Dumber," the underrated
"Kingpin," and the overrated "There's Something About Mary." Now, six years
after "D&D," the pair reunites with Jim Carrey in a story about a nice guy cop,
Charlie, who loves his job, but keeps his frustrations inside. He develops an
alter ego, the sexually compulsive Hank, and the two vie for the affection of a
pretty fugitive in "Me, Myself & Irene."</P>
<P>Charlie is a member of the "best law enforcement organization in the country,"
the Rhode Island State Police, but he has a problem. He's just too easy going.
So much so, in fact, that everyone takes advantage of his amiable nature. His
wife left him for a black-midget-genius-limo-driver. Charlie is left to raise
their three boys - triplets who are definitely not the fruit of Charlie's loins
- and has never gotten over the desertion. He's also such a nice-guy sucker
that people treat him without respect to his authority. Scofflaws act as if he's
their personal valet. Even kids treat him like dirt - "My daddy says I don't
have to listen to you!" one petulant little girl tells him</P>
<P>The hapless cop snaps one day and out pops Hank. Charlie's alter ego exacts the
retributions the nice-guy cop can't, but Hank's violent actions earn Charlie a
stay under psychiatric care. He is eventually allowed back on duty, but he has
to take his medication every six hours.</P>
<P>Enter Irene (Renee Zellweger), a pretty young woman passing through town who
gets arrested for an out-of-state warrant and Charlie is selected to drive her
back to upstate New York. The warrant is a fake, though, as Irene is really
being sought by her former boss, Dickey, who thinks she has the dirt on his
shady dealings. He brings in a corrupt cop (Chris Cooper) and EPA investigator
(Richard Jenkins) to go after Irene with deadly intent and it's up to
Charlie/Hank to save her.</P>
<P>The only real attraction to "Me, Myself & Irene" is the sometimes-brilliant
physical comedy of Jim Carrey. There is little in the way of a story, but lots
in the way of the visual comedy that centers on Carrey. The comic actor made
his mark with the goofy hi-jinx of "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective," and has shown
himself to have an amazing physical versatility. His Charlie/Hank has the
flexibility of Inspector Gadget. In one scene, Hank picks up the unconscious
Charlie and throws him in the back seat of a car. It is a terrific moment of
visual, physical comedy and rivals Steve Martin's great performance in "All of
Me."</P>
<P>The rest of the cast is left out in the cold. About the best that can be said
for the roles beyond Charlie/Hank is that none of the actors damaged their
careers, at least. Renee Zellweger acts well with Carrey, but is always the
second banana to the comedian. Robert Forster fades into the background as
Charlie's commanding officer. Chris Cooper looks like he's in pain as the
corrupt, bad guy cop. This, in particular, is a waste of a terrific character
actor. The only saving graces in the supporting roles are the three guys who
play Charlie's "sons." The genius trio combines discussion of metaphysics with
earthy jive talk that gives a funky edge to Charlie's family life and the only
other laughs in the flick.</P>
<P>The story, by the Farrelly brothers and Mark Cerrone, is, in a word, lame.
Actually, there are two stories - one, about Charlie/Hank and Irene; the other,
about Irene's plight. The latter story has no sense as Irene is ported back to
New York into the jaws of imminent death, but we never get a sense of why.
Nothing is done to explain why the bad guys - these are the blandest bad guys
I've seen in a long time - want to kill Irene. I realize that the film is a
vehicle for Carrey, but a sensible story is a necessity of film, too. The
Charlie/Hank yarn works about the way you'd expect with all the pratfalls and
slapstick you'd want.</P>
<P>"Me, Myself & Irene" is what I expected out of the Farrelly brothers, and less.
Their use of the comic talent of Jim Carrey assures them a solid stay at the
box office - especially since it is a performance that is worth the price of
admission. The rest of the film falls flat and lays, lifeless, as the antics of
Carrey prevail. The laughs are there and they all belong to Jim Carrey (and his
sons). I give it a C+.</P>
