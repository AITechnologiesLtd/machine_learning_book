<PRE>                        THE MAN WITHOUT A WORLD
                  A film review by Thomas E. Billings
                   Copyright 1991 Thomas E. Billings</PRE>
<P>Synopsis:
Self-described as a rediscovered classic silent film by (fictitious)
Soviet director Yevgeny Antinov, this is really a parody of silent
films.  Set in a shtetl, a small Jewish village in Eastern Europe in
1928, the story centers on the romance between a young, handsome and
incompetent poet (incredibly bad poetry!), and the beautiful daughter of
a village merchant.  Outrageously melodramatic at times, silly, corny,
and containing plenty of Jewish jokes, it is also a pleasant, witty,
funny, and good-humored film.  Very good!</P>
<P>U.S.A., black-and-white, 1991, 95 min., silent.
Director: Eleanor Antin.</P>
<P>     This new film by Eleanor Antin is an enjoyable, witty parody of
silent films.  The film is silent; although there is no spoken dialogue
(inter-titles are used for dialogue, standard practice for silent
films), the film does have a soundtrack, consisting only of background
organ music.  The film has the look of silent films from the 1920's,
using many of the same special effects, and the exaggerated acting of
the era.</P>
<P>     However, the film's sense of humor is quite contemporary, and
slightly sarcastic, but in a good-humored way.  The film's characters
spend a lot of time discussing (and poking fun at) Jewish traditions and
customs.  The script is excellent, and satirizes social and political
movements of the time (1920's), especially socialists and anarchists.
One of my favorite lines from the film: "...a good anarchist follows
orders..."!  The film is more than funny; it is witty.  There are plenty
of funny films around, but truly witty films are rare.</P>
<P>     An example of the film's humor and wit.  The biblical story of
Jonah, who was swallowed by a large fish/whale is told in a skit.
Picture a small boat, in a storm, with rain and wind.  Two men are on
the boat; one says (paraphrasing, can't provide an exact quote) "we're
in a bad storm ... there must be a Jew on board!"  The men search the
boat, and find Jonah.  They throw him overboard, where he is swallowed
by a whale.  Immediately the wind ceases, the rain stops, and the sun
comes out.  Clearly, throwing Jonah overboard has ended the storm!</P>
<P>     The film is set in a shtetl, a small rural Jewish village in
Eastern Europe (Poland or Russia) in 1928.  The story rambles somewhat,
but is mostly concerned with the romance between a handsome young man who
writes amazingly bad poetry, and the beautiful daughter of the village
tailor.  The poet has joined a traveling group of actors, and he is
trying to be an actor also.  Unfortunately, he writes his own lines for
the "plays" the group performs, and his plays are as bad as his poetry!
The poet's Mother dies, leaving the poet to care for his young, and
insane sister.</P>
<P>     The poet abandons his sister, who decides to live under a bridge
haunted by a dybbuk, a ghost.  This prompts the village's religious
elders to capture the poet's sister.  The story continues as she is the
subject of an exorcism ceremony performed by a dancing rabbi!</P>
<P>     Although this is a nice, funny film, it is not perfect.  The story
drags in a number of places.  The film is silent, and in grainy black-
and-white (it is in 16mm); obviously you shouldn't see it if you dislike
silent films.  Also, the film's self-consciously poking fun at Jewish
traditions and customs may offend (rather than entertain) some sensitive
viewers.</P>
<P>     This is an "artsy," low-key movie that probably won't get wide
distribution because it is silent.  Your best chance to see it is at a
film festival or film society screening.  If you can enjoy a witty,
funny, low-key silent movie, it is certainly worth seeing.</P>
