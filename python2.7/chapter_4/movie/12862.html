<PRE>                           A PERFECT MURDER
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This is an updating and a remake of a
          great stage thriller.  The new version adds some
          complexity to the story, but nothing that could
          really be called an improvement.  This story did
          not need to be moved into the world of
          international finance and the ultra-rich.  Director
          Andrew Davis has little grasp on what made the
          original characters compelling.  He delivers a
          version that is dark, humorless, and violent.
          Rating: 5 (0 to 10), low +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     I did not care much for Alfred Hitchcock's DIAL M FOR MURDER when
I saw it as a child.  It seemed a set-bound and a rather dry exercise.
Seeing it as an adult was an entirely different experience.  It clearly
is a stage play, but it has to be one of the most brilliant stage
thrillers ever written.  The entire play works like a well-oiled
machine of surprising complexity.  It was *the classic* stage murder
thriller.  Compared to DIAL M FOR MURDER, SLEUTH and DEATHTRAP are
merely gimmicky.  For DIAL M FOR MURDER, the playwright really sat down
and sweated all the details.  The one unrealistic touch is that main
character Tony Wendes is just too brilliant to be fully believed.  He
has a mind like a computer, thinking out all possibilities and
reconstructing his plans instant by instant.  The play must have been
rewritten over and over as Frederick Knott rethought the possibilities.
The remake A PERFECT MURDER has some of the plot, but it loses a lot in
the transition.</P>
<P>     In A PERFECT MURDER, the Taylors are probably one of the top 100
prominent couples in the country. Steven Taylor (played by Michael
Douglas) is an international commodities dealer who makes deals in the
hundreds of millions of dollars every day.  Emily Bradford Taylor
(played by Gwyneth Paltrow) is an heiress to one of the richest
families in America.  She has a position working as translator at the
United Nations General Assembly and as an aide to the Unite States
ambassador.  But Emily has other positions she likes more, fooling
around on the side with promising new artist David Shaw (Viggo
Mortensen).  Shaw has a future as an artist, but he also has a past,
and that he would like to keep quiet.  Unfortunately Steven Taylor
knows all about Shaw's past and has his own plans for Shaw's future.
The plans include killing Emily Taylor.  Saying any more about the new
and somewhat cluttered plot would really be telling too much.</P>
<P>     Michael Douglas is something of a master at portraying quiet
smoldering anger on the screen.  He is a good choice to show rage, but
he cannot bring to the role the kind of passionless thinking machine
quality that Ray Milland had in the original.  Luckily this script does
not call for Steven Taylor to make the sort of quick rethinking of
problems that Tony Wendes did in the original film.  Paltrow really
does have the sort of pristine good looks that are reminiscent of Grace
Kelly in the first film.  There are even scenes where she looks a bit
like Grace Kelly.  The problem is that the film insists on showing her
in bed with her lover. 1990s audiences demand to see some flesh, I
suppose.  There clearly is passion going on though nothing is seen that
really counts as nudity.  But what we do see of the sex is enough that
she no longer appears to the viewer to be an innocent.  And that loses
her the audience's sympathy.  We are left with several cold and
unsympathetic characters wandering around on the dark sets of this
film.  I should mention that Dariusz Wolski shot the film and if that
name is unfamiliar, he also filmed THE CROW and DARK CITY.  That should
tell you that he likes under-lit sets to create a cold and dark feel.
And this film certainly has that. Viggo Mortensen plays the third leg
of the romantic triangle.  He does not have much screen presence, but
he does have a very realistic look.  Rounding out the cast, but
appallingly under-used, is David Suchet as Detective Mohamed Karaman.
I suspect he had a bigger role in the original script.  It is his
character in the original play who does the real detective work.  But
rumors say that the end of the film was re-shot and presumably his role
was cut down in size.  Perhaps test audiences thought him solving the
crime was a little too close to what he does in his TV persona as
Hercule Poirot.  But for whatever the reason Suchet had only a small
part, and it was a serious waste to have such a good character actor in
so tiny a role.</P>
<P>     If you have seen the original film, there will still be plot
twists to keep you guessing, but you will also get an appreciation of
how good material can sour in the wrong hands.  It takes a remake like
A PERFECT MURDER to show the viewer how much has changed in the 1990s
conventions of films and to appreciate the genius of an Alfred
Hitchcock.  This cold and dark remake gets a 5 on the 0 to 10 scale and
a low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
