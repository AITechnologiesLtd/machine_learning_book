<PRE>                           SHINING THROUGH
                   A film review by Sandy Grossmann
                 Copyright 1992 by Sandra J. Grossmann</PRE>
<P>Cast:        Michael Douglas, Melanie Griffith, Liam Neeson, Joely Richardson, 
             John Gielgud
Screenplay:  David Seltzer, based on Susan Isaacs' novel
Director:    David Seltzer
Length:      2 hours 10 minutes</P>
<P>     Let me put it this way.  I didn't pay to see this film, and I had
an enjoyable pre-film conversation with the person who sat next to me.
Those were the highlights of the evening.</P>
<P>     The film does have entertainment value, but probably not what
Seltzer had in mind.  Oh, it's stylish, all right, the look of the
forties is well- produced, and occasional images remind you it's a
big-screen movie.  But the characters? the dialog? the *plot*?  Who
could've conceived of anything this stupid?</P>
<P>     Melanie Griffith forgot to play a new character, but it doesn't
matter.  She plays the same Working Girl except her hairstyle is
different and her name is Linda.</P>
<P>     Her boss is Ed (Michael Douglas), who may or may not be a spy for
the U.S.  Oh, hell, of course he's a spy.  And of course she falls in
love with him.  Anyway, once Pearl Harbor is attacked, he moves on to
more important work while she is shunted into the typing pool until he
returns, in full uniform, at which time Linda works for him again.  </P>
<P>     This time, though, Ed has a problem.  One of his agents in Nazi
Germany can't exactly work any longer.  What is Ed to do?  *Who* can
replace this agent?  Why, Linda has an idea.  Since she speaks
"perfect" low-class  German (compliments of her Berliner grandparents),
Linda suggests to Ed that she can infiltrate the very heart of Berlin's
Nazi society by becoming a cook for a high-ranking Nazi officer so that
she can photograph secret plans and smuggle the microfilm out of Nazi
Germany.  And Ed, a full colonel in the OSS, agrees that she's his best
bet, so he makes the arrangements and off she goes.  Wait.  Did I
mention she's "half Jewish?"  (Her very words...)  And did I tell you
she only has a week or two to (a) infiltrate, (b) take advantage of an
unguarded moment, (c) get the stuff, and (d) slip out of Germany before
her papers will "expire"?</P>
<P>     If you think the plot up to now sounds preposterous, well, you
ain't seen nothin' yet.  I won't go into all the details (I've already
tortured you enough), but suffice it to say that the latter part of the
movie makes the first part sound reasonable.</P>
<P>     OK, so the plot's ridiculous.  Movies are more than mere plots,
though.  How about the cinematography?  It's very nice--good work by
Jan de Bont.  How about the sound?  It's fine, nothing special, but
fine.  How about the acting?  Uhm...</P>
<P>     Michael Douglas actually does a nice job for more than half the
movie, and it's really not his fault that his character is totally
impossible and stupidly written.  And John Gielgud is on-screen for no
more than about four minutes total, so I doubt this will tarnish his
reputation.  Joely Richardson does a good job all the way through.
Liam Neeson (who plays a high-ranking Nazi) does an OK-but-nothing-`
special job.  But Melanie Griffith sets new lows for mediocrity.</P>
<P>     Aside from the fact that she has no feeling for the 40's style and
conducts herself in a strictly modern fashion, she simply fails to
convey emotion.  Her voice is flat, her face is flat, and her delivery
makes Clint Eastwood look like Olivier.  Even worse, the film is told
in flashbacks, and guess who narrates.  Fortunately, some of the
narration is so bad that the film accidentally becomes entertaining.  </P>
<P>     If ever a budding screenwriter wanted lessons on why flashback is a
dangerous device, well, here's an instructive movie.  Another lesson
this film carries is that relying exclusively on mood and style is
unprofitable.  So this movie isn't a total waste: it teaches what not
to do.  The studios, though, will probably interpret the audience's
lukewarm acceptance as a sign that no one is interested in period
pieces, and it'll be that much harder for a good "retro" screenplay to
get the go-ahead.</P>
<P>     I recommend not seeing this film until it reaches video.  It's
instructive enough (and pretty enough) to warrant a rental, but it's
not even worth matinee prices now.</P>
