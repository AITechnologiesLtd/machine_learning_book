<P>     As it turns out, the only thing of real importance in A MAN OF NO 
IMPORTANCE is Albert Finney's performance.  His turn as bus conductor 
Alfie Byrne is yet another extraordinary credit to add to an already-
impressive resume.  The man who played Tom Jones in the 1960s has matured 
into one of the best character actors of the 1990s, with memorable 
appearances in such films as THE PLAYBOYS, RICH IN LOVE, and THE BROWNING 
VERSION.  Even when these movies had little to offer, Finney's presence 
was a saving grace. </P>
<P>     When he's not entertaining his regular passengers with readings of
Oscar Wilde, Alfie is a would-be director who delights in putting on
not-so-successful amateur productions.  In the past, he has been known
for doing "The Importance of Being Earnest", but this time around,
Alfie has chosen to attempt "Salome."  This decision is crystalized
when he finds the perfect choice for the title role--an enchanting
young woman named Adele (Tara Fitzgerald) who wanders on his bus one
day.</P>
<P>     But Alfie's personal life isn't nearly as joyful as his public
personae might lead others to believe.  Despite attempts by his sister
(Brenda Fricker) to find him a wife, Alfie steadfastly resists the
idea, primarily because women don't interest him.  However, the only
one to whom he has openly admitted his homosexuality (or "the love that
dare not speak its name," as Wilde called it) is himself.  In Alfie's
world of 1963 Dublin, tolerance for gays is in short supply.</P>
<P>     If A MAN OF NO IMPORTANCE is anything other than a nicely-detailed
portrait of one unfulfilled middle-aged Dubliner, it's about the value
of friendship.  Although Alfie never finds the love for which he so
desperately searches, he discovers a far more valuable commodity.  In
Adele, he uncovers someone else who hides a secret.  The two are
kindred spirits and there are times when their interaction has a
closeness that lovers often strive for.  Then there's the driver of
Alfie's bus, a young man named Robbie (Rufus Sewell), to whom Alfie is
attracted.  Because Robbie is straight, Alfie never reveals his
feelings, choosing instead to pursue a platonic friendship.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the most glaring flaw A MAN OF NO IMPORTANCE is the
weakness of the framing storyline.  Alfie is such an interesting
character that he deserves a more original plot.  A MAN OF NO
IMPORTANCE takes only "safe" risks, avoiding reaching for something new
or groundbreaking.  There's a familiarity to the material, and only so
much an accomplished actor can do with the script.</P>
<P>     "The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it," wrote
Oscar Wilde, but when Alfie tries to apply this lesson, the results
are--to put it mildly--unfortunate.  That life cannot be lived without
risk and failure is certainly one of A MAN OF NO IMPORTANCE's more
emphatic messages.  And it's the choice of Albert Finney far more than
any other element of the production that allows this aspect of the
movie--as well as others--to succeed.</P>
