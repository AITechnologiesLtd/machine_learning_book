<PRE>Peacemaker 
Review by Larry McGillicuddy
Copyright Larry McGillicuddy</PRE>
<P>*** (out of 4)
Directed by Mimi Leder
Starring George Clooney, Nicole Kidman, Armin-Mueller Stahl, Michael 
Lures, Randall Batinkoff, Michael Boatman</P>
<P>Mimi Leder is probably best known for her stunning work as a director of 
the hit tv-show ER. Her mast famous episode, "Love's Labour Lost", dealt 
with the ordeal of Doctor Mark Greene as he tried his best to save the 
life of a pregnant mother and her child. The way she moved the camera and 
created tension throughout every scene was amazing. There was more 
excitement and adrenaline rushed suspense than just about any of 
Hollywood's big blockbuster movies. So it's only natural that Leder would 
get to direct her very own Hollywood blockbuster. And I have to say, 
after a shaky beginning, she does not disappoint.</P>
<P>Peacemaker deals with the theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists, which 
is obviously nothing new. The first half hour goes into detail, way too 
much detail, about how the weapons are stolen. Despite a few good images, 
including a train collision and a very impressive explosion, none of this 
was very coherent. It's long and drawn out, and I would have settled with 
a more implausible beginning that would have moved the story along better.</P>
<P>Once George Clooney and Nicole Kidman enter the picture, it begins to 
take off. George Clooney is an Air Force colonel with connections all 
over the world. He has a nice sarcastic wit and the rough edges that you 
expect from most Clooney characters. Nicole Kidman is head of a White 
House team on weapons smuggling. There is the usual flirtatious banter 
between the two, but that is dispensed with quickly.</P>
<P>The story takes Clooney and Kidman across the globe, trying to figure out 
who has the weapons and where they are going with them.Clooney goes 
through bouts of sarcasm, frustration, determination, and revenge while 
Kidman works against her own insecurity and self-doubt. This is when 
Leder starts to show her true stuff. She starts us off with a nifty 
little car chase as an appetizer. Then we get Clooney doing heroics in 
and out of a helicopter. Then that leads us to the brilliant final 
showdown on New York City's crowded streets, and a madman with a nuke 
walking among them.</P>
<P>Mimi Leder is a natural at creating suspense. She reminds me of Wolfgang 
Petersen in her ability to make the most routine action sequences 
exciting and breathtaking. Nicole Kidman is an intelligent female action 
hero. You're not gonna find her falling down so Clooney can come back to 
save her. George Clooney is a real movie star. Many of you may have hated 
him as Batman, but this guy is for real. He has a natural screen presence,
 and an ingratiating personality. He'll be around for a while. Dreamworks 
is off to a satisfying start with Peacemaker.</P>
