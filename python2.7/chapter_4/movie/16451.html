<PRE>GLORIA
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>Some talented actresses are blessed with a demonstrated wide acting 
range while others, almost as gifted, have more limited types of parts 
for which they are suitable.  As was amply evident after BASIC INSTINCT, 
Sharon Stone can play sensual roles with great abandon.  Rejecting her 
natural abilities, she has spent the rest of her entire career trying 
with little success to play against type.  GLORIA is her latest 
disaster.  </P>
<P>Babe Ruth didn't quit baseball after one season to play football in a 
quixotic quest to prove his athletic dexterity, and neither should Stone 
reject what she does best.  Janeane Garofalo, for example, is no less 
wonderful an actress because she could have never pulled off Stone's 
part in BASIC INSTINCT; neither is Stone any less talented because she 
couldn't do Garofalo's comedic roles.</P>
<P>Gloria, directed by respected director Sidney Lumet and adapted by Steve 
Antin from the 1980 screenplay by John Cassavetes, was not screened in 
advance for critics, almost always a sign that the studio isn't behind 
the picture.  After seeing it in a nearly empty audience after it 
opened, it is clear why they held it from the press.  It is a film more 
to be endured than enjoyed.</P>
<P>As the story opens, an angry Gloria (Stone) is being released from 
prison after 3 years confinement.  She's got a bad attitude and a big 
mouth.  She also has a bad case of wavering and overblown New York 
accents, a disease suffered by much of the rest of the cast.  </P>
<P>An annoying child actor named Jean-Luke Figueroa plays a soon-to-be 
orphan named Nicky.  Just before his whole family is gunned down by 
hoods working for Gloria's ex-boyfriend Kevin (Jeremy Northam), Nicky's 
dad gives him a banana yellow floppy disk with secrets about Kevin's 
operation and offers him a piece of fatherly advice.  "Be a man," his 
father lectures him sternly.  "Don't trust nobody.  Not no broads.  
Nobody."</P>
<P>Most of the film's leaden dialog is delivered with the emotive power of 
the automated time and temperature announcements.  Add in the movie's 
almost non-existent background noise and the excruciatingly slow pacing, 
and you can hear the sounds of the lines falling to the ground like 
stones.</P>
<P>Lumet places his actors in the frames like fruit in a still life 
painting.  They stand awkwardly mouthing the stiff sentences that pass 
for discourse.  ("Say you're my baby," Kevin coos demandingly.  "I'm not 
gonna," Gloria pouts back.)</P>
<P>The movie has a plethora of logical flaws and implausibilites.  The kid 
rarely seems the least bit worried or scared, no matter how many people 
are after him with guns, trying to kill him.  And in one key scene, the 
yellow floppy he holds is assumed to be the right disk without checking 
it and is further assumed never to have been copied.</P>
<P>Gloria, who keeps saying how she hates kids, takes Nicky under her wing 
and protects him from Kevin and the bad guys.  Think her maternal 
instincts will show up before the movie finally and predictably ends?  
If you don't know the answer, you may be just the right viewer for this 
film.  </P>
<P>You have to say this for Stone: she can keep a straight face.  When 
explaining life to a 7-year-old kid, she says with utter seriousness, 
"You got a lot of love making to make; you got a lot of boozing to do."</P>
<P>GLORIA runs 1:48.  It is rated R for profanity, violence and brief male 
nudity and would be acceptable for teenagers.</P>
