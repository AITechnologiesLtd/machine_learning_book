<P>     The first word that comes to mind when attempting to describe 
CAMILLA is "ordinary."  Nothing in this film, except perhaps a few 
appealing performances, is worth a backward glance.  CAMILLA is the kind 
of dull, vapid road picture that makes melodramatic twaddle like Edward 
Zwick's 1992 LEAVING NORMAL look invigorating. </P>
<P>     The problems start with the story--a sad combination of 
predictable circumstances, recycled characters, and requisite cliches.  
Admittedly, these are strung together with skill, but the lack of special 
moments makes CAMILLA a largely-unimpressive experience.  This is all-
too-familiar territory, with a worthy cast doing their best to salvage 
something. </P>
<P>     Freda and Vincent Lopez (Bridget Fonda and Elias Koteas) are 
vacationing in Georgia.  He's a graphic designer and she's a composer.  
One day, while taking a stroll, Freda hears violin music.  Intrigued, she 
investigates and meets Camilla Cara (Jessica Tandy), an aging-but-
energetic former concert performer living in a neighboring mansion owned 
by her movie producer son Harold (Maury Chaykin), whom she refers to as 
"a thief and a buffoon." </P>
<P>     Vincent and Harold hit it off immediately, leading to a job offer 
for Vincent to design Harold's movie posters.  Eager to get started, 
Vincent agrees to fly back to Toronto while Harold goes to Atlanta to 
check on the progress of his latest flick.  Freda elects to remain in 
Georgia with Camilla.  After the departure of the men, the two women 
quickly form a friendship that transcends the generation barrier.  On a 
spur-of-the-moment impulse, they pack a few things and get in Freda's car 
to head north for the Winter Gardens in Toronto where Brahms' Violin 
Concerto--the most difficult piece ever attempted by Camilla--is 
scheduled to be performed.  The trip doesn't go smoothly, however, and 
along the way there are a number of detours, including a disastrous ferry 
boat excursion and a stopover at Niagara Falls. </P>
<P>     CAMILLA is an undemanding motion picture--too undemanding, in 
fact.  Despite winning performances by the leads, there's little here for 
an audience to chew on.  The film rambles along lazily, requiring little 
more from viewers than that they avoid going into a coma.  Cursory 
attention is fine--go to the bathroom and you won't miss anything. </P>
<P>     CAMILLA isn't a "bad" movie per se.  It's just a rather flat and 
uninspired one--the kind of thing that started with high hopes and good 
intentions, but never developed further.  It has a made-for-TV feel 
irrespective of the big-name cast, something like a DRIVING MISS DAISY 
lite.  Nevertheless, Jessica Tandy, in the penultimate role of a 
distinguished career, shines through the subpar material, occasionally 
making this film not only bearable, but somewhat engaging. </P>
