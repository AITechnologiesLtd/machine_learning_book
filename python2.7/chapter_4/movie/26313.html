<PRE>"Girlfight" - Goes the Distance
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>"Girlfight" is a rough-edged fairy tale about Diana
Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez), a burdened 17-year girl
looking to rise above her low-rent status.  But things
do not bode well for our heroine.  She endures a
miserable home life, has little prospect of escaping
the Brooklyn housing project in which she lives, and
sees a murky future virtually bereft of any real
opportunity.</P>
<P>Diana is not a happy teenager, bubbling with anger and
attitude.  In school, for example, she seems to spend
most of her time in detention hall.  She has been in
numerous fights this semester and is on the verge of
being expelled.  Home life is no better.  Her father
seems impartial to her and unsupportive of her
activities.  He's a bullheaded man intent on imposing
an outdated set of rules on his children.  He forces
Diana's bookish brother to take boxing lessons when
his talents clearly lie elsewhere.  And to Diana, he
can only ask why she won't ever wear a skirt.</P>
<P>As chance would have it, she pays a visit to her
brother at the boxing gym where he trains and watches
some of the action.  Intrigued, she sees that boxing
may be just the right outlet for her anger and
athletic ability.   Thus, a gritty little drama starts
to take shape as she begins to train.   Working as
hard as any Olympian, Diana learns the basic
techniques in a surprisingly short amount of time. 
Over a period of a few months, she increases her
strength, learns a variety of combination moves, and
begins to spar with the other guys in the gym (there
are no other female boxers there).  Her skill is
gaining her a measure of acceptance, while her
physical regimen gives her an important personal
boost.</P>
<P>During her time in the gym, she meets up with Adrian
(Santiago Douglas).  He's a promising featherweight
training for the pros.  She likes him and he's also
interested in Diana but has trouble with commitment. 
When the two eventually spar, he just sort of dances
around, not really sure what to do.  No doubt, his
indecision in the ring parallels his indecision in his
heart.  Diana, however, is not afraid to be
forthright.  "I love you," she confesses to him and
then connects with a vicious left cross.  With each
punch thrown and each bout fought, Diana grows, both
as a boxer and as a woman.</P>
<P>This hard-to-find film (currently playing in 28
theatres nationwide and only at the Mazza Gallerie in
DC) is satisfying fare with gritty performances and an
efficient plot line.  In fact, this film received high
recognition at last winter's Sundance Film Festival,
splitting the top dramatic prize and winning the
best-directing award.  Its struggling class milieu is
reminiscent of film's like "Flashdance" and "Saturday
Night Fever," which is a style seldom seen in today's
Hollywood productions.  In fact, there is a noticeably
unglamorous and homegrown feel to this film that lends
to its charm.    Brooklyn accents are heavy, the
picture is grainy, the sound is tinny (when the letter
's' is used, the hissing sound is inescapable), and
you can always hear the neighborhood's ambient sounds
of horns, barking dogs, car alarms and sirens.  It
also does well at conveying the intensity of the
fights, using quick edits and a flurry of staccato
notes.  This method is simple, yet effective.  And so
is the movie.  "Girlfight" keeps its balance,
maintains its intensity, and comes out ahead in the
end.</P>
