<PRE>Stigmata</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Stigmata isn't just a cool/scary sounding word, nor is it Mitsubishi's
newest sportscar. It's what people are called who bare the wounds of the
crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Usually these people are devout in faith, but
not Frankie Paige; she's a free spirit, happy-go-lucky, partying
hairdresser.</P>
<P>Think you've had a bad day? Frankie gets nailed to the wall at the drop of a
hat (or holy water in this case). It's enough to make you cry tears of
blood.</P>
<P>But "Stigmata" the movie isn't all special effects of torture. Though the
writers may hammer it through your bones a little harder than necessary, the
theme is relevant and strong.</P>
<P>Good point aside, the picture suffered from a slow start, mediocre
soundtrack, expository dialogue in a Vatican scene, some sticky editing
choices and near miss intensities. And then there's the implausibilities.
Example 1: Frankie is attacked by an unseen force in a public dance hall
(okay, I'm believing that). Bleeding from the head and delusional she fleas
from the club, her best friend first gets her rain coat on before running
after (I can't believe that). Example 2: Admitted to the hospital for
puncture wounds clear through both wrists, she's assumed to be a suicide
victim (How would one drive a nail through that second wrist?).</P>
<P>Still, the picture had it's moments, I had my share of chills and as I said
... good point.</P>
