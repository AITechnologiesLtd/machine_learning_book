<PRE>               A film review by Joshua Diego McAdams</PRE>
<PRE>                Copyright 1997 Joshua Diego McAdams</PRE>
<P>        Mere words cannot begin to describe the experience of David
Lynch's "Lost Highway."  To label the film as egotistical ,
nonsensical, and ametuerish would be an insult to films i have
previously considered as bottomfeeders. I would rather face a Brian
Bosworth retrospective than be forced to suffer through this offering
again.</P>
<P>Lynch mistakes begin in the opening credits when he attempts
to blend  some Billy Coriggan imitator croning over a erratic POV shot
speeding down a deserted highway at night. This incredibly blatant
grab for the "alternative" box office totally unmasks Lynch the
"artist" to reveal a director who I can only describe as comiclly
untalented.</P>
<P>More examples of Lynch's overt attempt to be "different"
abound as the story starts to progress. Bill Pullman is a saxaphonist
with a cheating wife who starts finding videotapes on his front stoop
from an anonymous evil entity. See how long it took to describe the
action? Lynch doesn't see it as this straight forward. Instead he
milks every minute detail of the couples' strained relationship,
pausing for endless amounts of dead time and filtering in "errie"
music to manipulate the audience. Granted, soundtracks always toy with
the audiences emotions but "Lost Highway" is so contrived that you
feel used instead of apprehensive. </P>
<P>Lynch shakes the camera, which some will no doubt laud as
great direction. Lynch puts people wearing black shirts against black
backgrounds, which some people may see as symbolic. But what Lynch
does most of all is waste time and film. "Lost Highway" drags  into a
world of  "surrealism" until it finally begins to twist and constrict
around itself until all the promise and life is choked out of the
film. Why is the publicity surrounding his films always about him?
Three words: lack of story.</P>
<P>To further disguise the plot abyss, Lynch brings in these
graphic sex scenes, six or seven in all, that I suppose could be
justified as central to characters. Instead I found myself asking why
I was looking  at Patricia Arquette's breasts again. Again "Lost
Highway" sets itself in a category that has been reserved for the
absolute worst of the worst. Yes, it breaks new ground and falls
straight into the basement.</P>
<P>Unfortunately there are some individuals who have the right to
enjoy this type of film making. I find them  gathered in art galleries
and coffee shops discussing the meaning of this or the theme of that.
I always attempt to get some type of concrete examples as to why they
feel Lynch is a quality director, but all I tend to get is artiste
doublespeak such as "Lynch explores repressed tensions of the world."
It's a sad statement about our commercial society when something is
considered artistic just because it is different or because someone
(usually the person who does it) tells you how different and artistic
the work is.</P>
<P>As I opened with words cannot describe the pain one must
endure to reach the credits on "Lost Highway."  Manic/Despressives
beware: I'm thankful I left my gun at home or I may have opted for
suicide. I noticed the usher takes you belt and shoestrings as you
enter.</P>
