<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A decently paced thriller set in Saigon, Vietnam (but shot in Bangkok),
during 1968, as two Army cops hunt for a serial killer of Vietnamese
prostitutes, who all had babies by an American father. They suspect it
could be a high-ranking officer committing the killings, since a
colonel's insignia was found at the last crime scene. As they begin
their investigation, they realize there is a cover-up going on. The
files for 6 other prostitutes murdered has disappeared, and the previous
military police investigating the crimes have all been transferred out
of Saigon or are too frightened to talk.</P>
<P>The film just touches on the Vietnam War taking place all around them
and centers on the murder investigation, which takes them to the red
light district and the segregated black and white bars the soldiers
frequent. The plainclothes cops, the white Sergeant McGriff (Dafoe) and
the black Sergeant Perkins (Hines), are serious about getting the killer
and will go to any lengths to get him.</P>
<P>When they question the prostitutes they run into many problems: They are
followed by some Vietnamese who fire upon them. They have an
antagonistic relationship with the officer in charge of the Vietnamese
National Army Military Police, a smarmy officer named Lime Green (Lim),
who continually makes life difficult for them. When they get wind of a
soldier (Keith) who witnessed who the killer was, he becomes paranoid
and will talk only to an officer. While he's under their guard, he gets
executed. They thereby travel to the frontlines to talk to the previous
investigator (O'Connor), and he reluctantly gives them info on the five
colonels he suspects of doing the killings.</P>
<P>The film is filled with violence, vulgar dialogue, and seems devoid of
real feelings. It relies on twists in the plot to keep you tuned into
the investigation and shocking scenes to keep you aghast at the horrors
of being in Vietnam. The main shocker is watching one of the suspects,
the sadistic Colonel Armstrong (Glenn), question VC suspects on a
helicopter and when through questioning them toss them out of the
chopper. In the meantime, he's being questioned by the earnest cops for
his part in the prostitute murders.</P>
<P>Their biggest lead comes when they befriend attractive nun Nicole
(Pays), who when she's not working at a daycare center that serves the
children of the prostitutes, she's fending off McGriff's love interest
in her. She will eventually get around to telling him how to locate a
key witness now living in a VC tunnel. The boys are working on their
own, but are supported by their immediate superior, the gruff Staff
Sergeant Dix (Ward). There are a few more violent incidents that take
place which include: a bomb thrown under their vehicle; Sergeant Dix
rescuing them from the hands of a Vietnamese mob; and, a surprise ending
as to who was the actual killer and what was his motive.</P>
<P>The acting was flat, the story was trite, and the suspense was marginal.
But it did capture a seedy feel for Saigon and the disharmony among
those fighting on the same side against the VC. A baraly watchable
cliché-laden flick seen through the eyes of two military buddy cops, who
conduct a standard police investigation using the black-white cop
formula for fighting crime.</P>
