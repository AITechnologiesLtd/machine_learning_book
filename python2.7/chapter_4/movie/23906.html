<P>_The_Skulls_ (PG-13) no stars (out of ****)</P>
<P>I'll cut to the chase for the teenybopper admirers of _Dawson's_Creek_
heartthrob Joshua Jackson: he has a couple of partial shirtless shots and
a big scene where he runs around in a skintight spandex rowing outfit. 
But as loud as the girls' howls were for that latter scene, they did not
compare to the ever-increasing volume of the ones from the entire
audience as this atrocious thriller grew longer and more ridiculous. 
Jackson plays Luke, a student at an Ivy League university who is
recruited to join the exclusive "secret" on-campus society known as (what
else?) the Skulls.  (I place the word "secret" in quotes because everyone
is not only acutely aware of the society's existence, but also the
location of their headquarters.)  He joins and enjoys the perks of
membership until he learns of the despicable Skulls cover-up of an even
more despicable crime.  Luke wants out, but the organization, of course,
has other ideas.</P>
<P>One big problem with the film from the start: I never understood why
being a Skull was so special in the first place.  While there are obvious
monetary benefits, the other "special" activities--black tie parties,
free sex, vacation retreats--would be commonplace for other
non-underground groups.  That, however, is a minor complaint, for
_The_Skulls_ is one of those bad films that manages to get worse and
worse across the board as it progresses.  Barely credible performances
turn embarrassingly amateurish (token female Leslie Bibb is cute, but
that doesn't count for anything when the material gets more, ahem,
"serious"); the turns of the plot are not so much shocking as laughably
preposterous (the gratuitous Jackson/Bibb love scene comes at the most
unconvincing moment possible; and nothing can prepare you for the, for
lack of a better term, "Victorian" climax).  After seeing _The_Skulls_
and Rob Cohen's last two theatrical releases, _Daylight_ and
_Dragonheart_, I am forced to wonder if he actually did direct the
memorable _Dragon:_The_Bruce_Lee_Story_.</P>
