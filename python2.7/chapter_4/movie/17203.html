 Universal Pictures/Imagine Entertainment
 Director:  Ron Howard
 Writer:  Lowell Ganz, Babaloo Mandel, on Michel Poulette's
film "Le Roi des Ondes" ("King of the Airwaves")
 Cast: Matthew McConaughey, Jenna Elfman, Woody
Harrelson, Ellen DeGeneres, Sally Kirkland, Martin Landau,
Elizabeth Hurley, Rob Reiner, Dennis Hopper</P>
<P>   In a film that is perfectly watchable but will probably
disappear from audience memory within three hours of its
conclusion, "EDtv" takes off where "The Truman Show" and
"Pleasantville" left off.  Bearing none of the creative juices
that made the two 1998 films striking to viewers, "EDtv"
suffers from predictability, a narrow imagination, and a final
payoff that is so limp (literally so, in fact) that you'll wonder
how highly-paid screenwriters could fail to come up with a
more convincing outcome.  "Edtv" is about an ordinary guy
with a sexy Texan drawl and a goofy but photogenically
friendly face who is catapulted to prominence at the whim of
a TV producer and his program director.  </P>
<P>    A pundit who could have been inspired by Confucius or
Buddha once commented on the irony of such fame.  You
spend a good part of your youth trying to achieve it, he said,
and the rest of your life hiding from the public behind shades
and other disguises.  Celebrity status has its privileges but
exacts a price.  Your privacy is shot, you're hounded for
autographs wherever you go, and as Ron Silver pointed out
in the stage play "And," you cringe every time someone gets
into your face with the banal reflection, "I love your work."  In
"EDtv," which is based partially on a French movie which no
one has seen, "The King of the Airwaves," an ordinary Joe
Sixpack is offered fifteen metaphoric minutes of fame, goes
for the deal, but backs out with fourteen minutes to go in his
contract.  Just plain Ed (Matthew McConaughey) discovers
what most of us eventually will realize--that you shouldn't ask
too strongly for what you want: you may get it.  The
champagne  he swims in when he becomes king of the
airwaves turns to sour grapes when the public repeatedly
invades his privacy, undermines his dignity, causes a rift
between him and his brother, and even threatens to break up
the relationship  between his mother and the stepdad he
adores.</P>
<P>   Directed as a conventional narrative by Ron Howard--who
teams up with his regular scripters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo
Mandel)--"EDtv" opens on a meeting at a failing cable TV
network as program director Cynthia (Ellen DeGeneres)
works hard to convince her boss, Whitaker (Rob Reiner) to
air a show that might get a better rating than the local
Gardening Channel.  Inspired by an actual documentary
broadcast some twenty years ago by PBS about the Loud
family, Cynthia's idea is for a twenty-four hour coverage of an
ordinary American with no editing, no professional actors, and
no commercials save for a regular, printed bulletin at the
bottom of the screen touting a host of nationally-known
products.  The only provision for privacy is that the camera
would not enter the subject's bathroom and would refuse to
catch footage of his sexual activities.  After interviewing
several candidates for this last-ditch attempt at good ratings,
the network team goes with Ed Pekurny (Matthew
McConaughey), a goofy video store clerk in his early thirties
who lives in San Francisco and has the potential for national
appeal because of his openness, honesty, and vulnerability. 
After an unpromising introduction which features Ed engaging
in no more adventurous action shots than brushing his teeth,
the show picks up dramatically when its star makes a play for
his own brother's girl friend, Shari (Jenna Elfman), to the
obvious displeasure of Ed's sibling, Ray (Woody Harrelson). 
As people everywhere hound the new celebrity sensation for
autographs and as the ubiquitous cameras hone in on Ed's
relationship with his mother, his stepdad and his biological
father, Ed feels he is simply being used--that the network 
cares not a whit for the poor man's dignity but actually thrives
on his pratfalls, the family frictions and the wrenches the
ever-present camera people throw into his most intimate
relationships.</P>
<P>   Director Ron Howard may want to expose the evils of the
big bad media, but considering the sums of money promised
to the new star, we can hardly sympathize with Ed's
complaints.  Whereas the film could have shown us how the
corporations lead us on with bold promises of generous
treatment and then throw us away when we are used up,
we're treated to the very opposite concept: it is Ed, and not
the communications industry, who wants out.  The station is
not only willing but insistent on keeping its hero in the
national spotlight and showering him with bonuses.  And
where Howard may wish us to question our addiction to TV--
our compulsion to watch absolutely anything that moves
across the screen--he shows us a program which is so
dynamic, so vibrant and appealing, that you can't blame the
American people for staying glued to the screen.  Contrary to
the usual cynical notions about the tube, the program known
as EDtv is a quality offering that subtitutes honest emotions
and real love for the phony, soap-opera scripts of the daytime
lineups.  </P>
<P>  As a result, we're not clear what we're supposed to believe. 
Are we meant to feel that the public will feast on just anything
that crosses the screen, or that television can rescue itself
from banality by conjuring up unique programs like EDtv? 
Are the people who watch this show lampooned as folks
without standards, or are they praised for rejecting the usual,
unimaginative presentations in favor of something innovative?</P>
<P>   Working with a script that is conventional and lacking a
clear purpose, Matthew McConaughey turns in an impressive
performance as an often bemused Everyman, but the best
lines go to Martin Landau as stepdad Al, an infirm old man
confined to a wheelchair and dependent for oxygen on an
inhaler, who comes up with such dry-humored gems as "I've
got to take a pee...wish me luck."  But the gorgeous Elizabeth
Hurley in the role of Jill--who feigns an interest in Ed in order
to land a role as a model or actress--looks at the camera so
often when initiating a tryst that you wonder whether Ron
Howard trusts his audience to know her real motivation
unless she mugs for the lens in the most obvious way. 
Woody Harrelson's fine as Ed's envious brother, Ray, in the
sort of good-old-boy role that suits his temperament, but Ellen
DeGeneres, as program director Cynthia, is oddly meant to
come across in the final analysis as a hero when in fact she
is the one who initiates the indignities.  Watch Jenna Elfman
closely and speculate on whether she is doing her darndest
to clone Renee Zellweger.</P>
<P>   The artistic and commercial success of "The Truman
Show" and "Pleasantville" is bound to spawn additional
attempts to cash in, but as the first such bid "EdTV," is
entertaining but as it does not genuinely explore its
implications, it is bereft of anything that could elevate it to
something more.</P>
