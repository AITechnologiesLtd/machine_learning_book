<P>"Hilary and Jackie" (1998) 2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Emily Watson and
Rachel Griffiths.</P>
<P> Realizing this is a generalization, the question still needs to be posed:
Why is it that these bio-pics about artistic people seem to be so
overwrought and punctuated by multiple exclamation points?</P>
<P> Case in point, "Hilary and Jackie," the story of the English cellist
Jacqueline du Pre and her sister, Hilary, a talented flutist who chose
marriage and family over a concert career.</P>
<P> The movie, while covering the life of the two women, never really allows
its audience any intimacy with its subjects.</P>
<P> We know only the surface details. Jackie, driven early in life by her
sister's musical expertise, works to surpass her. It is Jackie who gains
fame as one of the world's top cellist while Hilary is content to live in
the country with her husband, Kiffer.</P>
<P> What "Hilary and Jackie" lacks is focus and heart. Focus, because the
screenplay, adapted by Frank Cottrell Boyce from the book "A Genius in the
Family" by Hilary and her brother, Piers Du Pre, cannot get a firm grasp on
Jackie.</P>
<P> Her artistic temperment is well displayed. She is self-centered - while on
tour, she ships her dirty laundry home to be washed; mercurial - she goes
from moments of giddiness to fits of depression and moments of cruelty; and
conflicted - she loves the accolades and perks of fame, yet she envies
Hilary's simple country life.</P>
<P> The problem is that no discernible reason is given for Jackie's actions.
It must be taken on faith that it is merely her inherent nature. She is
driven by genius. Why? Because we are told so.</P>
<P> The most controversial aspect of the movie - as it reportedly was in the
book - was the time Jackie quit touring to live with Hilary and "share" her
husband. Jackie, who was married to pianist-conductor Daniel Berenboim,
deserts him and just drops in on Hilary and her family and blithfully
disrupts their lives.</P>
<P> At least the movie refuses to allow Hilary to become a victim. She is
culpable, allowing her forceful sister to have her way, even letting her
sleep with her beloved Kiffer. Hilary indulges Jackie's outrageous
behavior. Yet, again, no apparent explanation is forthcoming, except that
Hilary is afraid of losing her sister.</P>
<P> In a normal family relationship, Jackie's behavior would get her tossed
with a good riddance for emphasis. But Hilary consistently hides behinds
Jackie's "genius" as her excuse for her non-intervention.</P>
<P> As Jackie, Emily Watson, who was so stunning in "Breaking the Waves,"  is
all mannerisms and motion. She doesn't inhabit Jackie so much as possess
her, like the devil possessed Linda Blair in "The Exorcist." Any moment you
expect her to vomit up pea soup. Affecting a nearly incomprehensible
accent, Watson shows us Jackie's artistic madness, but cannot show us what
ignites it.</P>
<P> Even later, when Jackie is ravaged with multiple sclerosis, Watson's
performance seems just that - acting. You never get the feeling that she
actually inhabits Jackie. She may have copied the outer trappings, but she
has failed to reach the soul of the artist.</P>
<P> Griffiths Hilary has a much more difficult time. Not as flamboyant as
Jackie, her task is nearly thankless. She must balance that thin line
between martyr and victim. You shake your head in disbelief while she
allows Jackie to use her husband and walk all over her, yet you also admire
her resilience and determination to hold her family - and her life -
together.</P>
<P> Griffiths' is the spine of the film. Her Hilary, despite all her flaws, is
the stronger of the sisters.</P>
<P> "Hilary and Jackie" is a movie with faults. Director Anand Tucker's
decision to show some of the same sequences from the perspective of both
Hilary and Jackie seems a bit pretentious and unnecessary.</P>
<P> However, "Hilary and Jackie" does have some fine moments. One, especially,
is the scene early on when the young Hilary realizes that Jackie has
surpassed her in talent and has become the star of the family. It is
heartbreaking in its honesty and reality.</P>
<P> Sequences such as those make this movie worth seeing. The music is good,
as well, but it is not what drives this movie. Relationships and the
complexities of family is at the core of "Hilary and Jackie."</P>
