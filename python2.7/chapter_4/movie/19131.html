<PRE>Unforgiven (1992)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 95</PRE>
<P>"Unforgiven" was a long time in coming.  The
script was written by David Webb Peoples in
1976.  Eventually, the rights were acquired by
Clint Eastwood, who waited to film it until
he had aged enough to match the lead character.
Certainly, "Unforgiven" was worth the wait:
Eastwood won both Best Picture and Best Director,
and was nominated for Best Actor.</P>
<P>Eastwood plays William Munny, formerly a notorious
drunk, train robber and killer.  He later married a
woman who reformed him.  Smallpox left him a widower,
and he struggles to raise two adorable children
(Shane Meier and Aline Levasseur) by scratching out
a living as a pig farmer.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, two cowboys (David Mucci and Rob Campbell)
disfigure a young prostitute (Anna Thomson) in the
town of Big Whiskey.  The tough local sheriff Little
Bill (Gene Hackman) merely fines the men, with the
fine payable to the prostitute's humorless owner
(Anthony James).  Outraged, the other prostitutes pitch
together a $1,000 reward payable upon the murder of
the two cowboys.</P>
<P>With his farming enterprise failing, Munny is enticed
to collect the bounty by a near-sighted, boasting,
would-be gunman (Jaimz Woolvett).  Munny also convinces
his old friend Ned (Morgan Freeman).  The three arrive
at Big Whiskey, but have a run-in with Little Bill,
whose definition of law-and-order does not include
roaming hired gunmen.  The brutal sheriff has already
disposed of one mercenary, English Bob (Richard Harris),
taking his pulp writer sidekick Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek)
for good measure.</P>
<P>"Unforgiven" was nominated for nine Academy Awards,
winning four.  Gene Hackman won Best Supporting Actor,
and Joel Cox won for editing.  The screenplay, the
cinematography (Jack Green), the sets and the sound
were also nominated.</P>
<P>For once, the Academy had picked a film fully
worthy of Best Picture.  "Unforgiven" not only
revitalized the Western epic, but gave it a
human face and memorable characters.  Except
for the climatic showdown, "Unforgiven" depicts
a West filled with characters who are neither
heroes or villains, and with flaws that are all
too obvious.</P>
<P>The film also makes a statement about personal
redemption: despite the protestations by Eastwood's
character that he is reformed, his actions prove
otherwise.  The conversations between Little Bill
and the pulp writer dismiss the myth of the West,
which is restored by Eastwood in his big showdown.</P>
