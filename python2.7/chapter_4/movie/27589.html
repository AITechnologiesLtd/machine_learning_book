<PRE>                            SOLOMON & GAENOR
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>Solomon & Gaenor may not be directed squarely at the American Pie crowd,
but nonetheless it revolves around the similar theme of young love (and
young lust).</P>
<P>Solomon sells fabric and women's clothing door to door.  Gaenor is the
prim and very Christian daughter of a mining family in a nearby
village.  Inexplicably, Gaenor is unable to discern from Solomon's mass
of curly black hair and occupation in the textile business that he is
Jewish, and they soon develop a lusty relationship, replete with
hay-rolling booty calls in a local barn.</P>
<P>This, in case you're wondering, is Wales in 1911.</P>
<P>Solomon hides his Jewish heritage from Gaenor, as he would never make
his way into her arms otherwise due to the prejudices of the era.  As
you might expect, the deception leads to all kinds of trouble for the
star-crossed lovers.  Civil unrest and a miners' strike make things all
the worse.</P>
<P>Despite its gloomy promise, Solomon & Gaenor manages to hold your
attention throughout its running time, thanks to strong performances
from its two quirky leads, Ioan Gruffudd (Wilde) and Nia Roberts.  The
love affair is mostly believable, falling somewhere between The Piano
and The Way We Were in degree of heat.  Borrowing heavily from Romeo and
Juliet, the film works with good source material while it puts a unique
spin on things.</P>
<P>It certainly could have gone a lot worse, another morose Feast of July
to send you screaming out of the theater.  But while Solomon & Gaenor is
hardly uplifting, it remains a very good example of the period romance.</P>
<P>In English, Welsh, and Yiddish (with subtitles for the latter two).</P>
