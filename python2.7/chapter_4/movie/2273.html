<PRE>                                 A PERFECT WORLD
                                    [Spoilers]
                       A film review by Richard Montanari
                        Copyright 1993 Richard Montanari</PRE>
<PRE>Unforgivable<HR></PRE>
<P>     What makes A PERFECT WORLD such a huge disappointment is not just
the fact that it is, without peer, the worst film Clint Eastwood has
ever directed, but also that it held the rare romise of combining the
talents of two Oscar-winning directors: Eastwood and Kevin Costner.</P>
<P>     The story is set in Texas, two weeks before JFK's fateful day at
Dealey Plaza.  This is mentioned early in the film, then never brought
up again.  A simple "1963" at the bottom of the screen would have
sufficed, but that might have excised some of screenwriter John Lee
Hancock's precious dialogue.  And there's a *lot* of dialogue here,
bubba.</P>
<P>     An escaped convict, Butch Haynes (Costner), takes an
eight-year-old Jehovah's Witness boy hostage and hits the road for a
little psycho-daddy and son bonding.  We never get to know for sure
just what Butch did to put him in the joint, but we do learn that he
killed a man when he was eight, and that his mother was a hooker, so we
know he didn't grow up next door to the Cleavers.  The Meat Cleavers,
maybe.</P>
<P>     In lukewarm pursuit is Texas Ranger Red Garnett (Eastwood), a
Geritol-swiggin' veteran cop who doesn't take guff from anyone,
exceptin' feisty criminologist Sally Gerber (Laura Dern), who pops up
every so often for a little feminist relief and obligatory
psychobabble.  There's also a black-suited and sunglassed Fed around
for stone-faced quips.</P>
<P>     Oh, yeah, Red and his team phone the entire manhunt in from an
Airstream trailer which has crashed into a tree in the woods.</P>
<P>     When Butch finds out that Phillip (T. J. Lowther) has never been
trick or treating he decides to give the kid a taste of normal
childhood.  They stop at a general store for a costume, and things move
along just fine until, all of a sudden, The Guy at the Back of the
Store hears The Broadcast about The Escaped Convict and starts giving
them The Eye.  The duo make a run for it, and soon we discover that the
kid has stolen a Casper the Friendly Ghost costume.  Twenty minutes on
the road and the kid goes from Jehovah to John Dillinger.</P>
<P>     Over the next day or so Butch and Buzz (Phillip's new nom de rue)
take in a little gunpoint trick-or-treating, a little more larceny and,
after eating dinner and spending the night with a poor farmer's family,
a little pistol-whipping and duct-taping of the man, his wife and their
grandson.</P>
<PRE>[Spoilers]</PRE>
<P>     Eventually, Butch takes the mandatory gut shot as the Rangers
close in -- beginning one of the longest death scenes in cinematic
history -- and heads off to a better place.  Which, for the audience,
after more than two hours, means the lobby, the parking lot and then
home.</P>
<P>     What possessed Eastwood to believe that Kevin Costner could pull
off the wacko-with-a-heart-of-gold is beyond me, as is Costner's
tradition of astonishingly bad haircuts. (Although, this is the first
film where we know for a fact it was cut in prison.)</P>
<P>     Yet, ultimately, the blame must lie with Clint Eastwood, who
follows the brilliance of Unforgiven, and his chunky performance in In
the Line of Fire with such a lethargic, ill-conceived effort.  Had he
won the best director Oscar for Bird, like he should have, and followed
it with Unforgiven, this wouldn't seem so bad.  But alas, in spite of
its promise, The Man with No Name has made a Film with No Soul.</P>
