written by Albert Brooks and Monica Johnson

<P>I love L.A. Despite the traffic, L.A. is the best place to live if
you're looking for a casual lifestyle. Los Angeles has been a major
player in films from "Chinatown" to "Short Cuts", perhaps because all
the major players in film reside there; the city translated as "city
of angels"(how ironic; I guess all they all moved away). An overlooked
aspect of Albert Brooks' terrific comedy "The Muse" will be the way
Brooks' presents L.A., as a paradise-like city where you could sit
home during the day, write a bit of your new action screenplay, and
make enough so that your family could live in a Palisades estate.</P>
<P>"The Muse" is Woody Allen territory, both in the way the film business
is presented and in the slightly supernatural mystical
storyline. However, what "The Muse" will gain its notoriety for is for
being Sharon Stone's return to comedy(her last one was
"Irrenconcilable Differences", her first major film role) after years
of forgettable dramatic performances("Casino" being an
exception). Although her role as the title character won't recieve an
Oscar, her natural charm shines through and she is surprisingly
likable.</P>
<P>"The Muse" is the story of Steven Phillips(Albert Brooks), an
Oscar-nominated screenwriter who is told by his boss that he has lost
his edge. He is subsequently fired and turns to his more successful
friend(Jeff Bridges) for he advice. He tells him about Sarah(Sharon
Stone), who is a real Muse, the daughter of Zeus, who can inspire
creativity.</P>
<P>Steven decides to give this Muse thing a try, when he realizes that
the Muse has absolutely no concept of money. Sarah will inspire you,
but in return you must give her everything she wants. So Sarah ends up
moving in to Steven's home, and as well as subtly inspiring Steven,
she inspires Steven's wife(Andie MacDowell) into becoming the next
"Mrs. Fields".</P>
<P>A lot of the fun in "The Muse" comes from watching different
celebrities admit to using the Muse.  Rob Reiner thanks her for "The
American President", James Cameron thanks her for "Titanic", Martin
Scorsese thanks her for inspiring his remake of "Raging
Bull"(hopefully a joke), and Sarah claims that she did "The Truman
Show".</P>
<P>The only real flaw in "The Muse" is a slightly unsatisfying ending
which doesn't live up to the comic genius which preceeded it. But
Albert Brooks has created a very funny comedy that entertains at
Hollywood's expense. What could be better?</P>
<P>"The Muse" also proves that real inspiration can only be found within
yourself, which is something that writers of all kinds need to
learn. I, myself, have started work on a few screenplays, only to give
up after 5 or so pages. Creativity is certainly not an easy
trait. Well, at least Albert Brooks is in top form, proving that he
won't be needing a muse for a very long time.</P>
