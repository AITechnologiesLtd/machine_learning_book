<PRE>                                JERRY MAGUIRE
                       A film review by John Schuurman
                        Copyright 1997 John Schuurman</PRE>
<P>This film has a lot going for it. First, it is going to do
well commercially. It has all the right stuff. For starters,
it has Tom Cruise who is pretty AND he can act. (He is smart
too -- look for him to direct in a couple of years.) This
film is his finest achievement yet. Additionally, it is a
sports movie that actually works. (Most don't -- this one
does because it only incidentally includes sports.) Plus it
is a delightful love story and has an adoreable kid.</P>
<P>But then this: it is also a serious and biting expose of one
of America's powerful sub-cultures. Like Robert Altman's
NASHVILLE, this film swoops in on a little fragment of
American life -- one  that has power far beyond itself -- and
lays bare its inner workings, its cynicism, its greed, and
above all, its shameless exploitation of the ones about whom
it purports to care the most. This movie says to our
entertainment and sports crazed society, "Deceive yourselves
no longer. Your cherished notion of innocuous entertainment
is rubbish. This world is controlled by sharks." </P>
<P>NASHVILLE and JERRY MAGUIRE are also alike in that neither
are content to confine their scrutiny to the sub-culture in
question. Both make searing commentary on the broad stream of
American culture that has made the aberrant sub-culture
possilble in the first place. The movies are both about the
morally bereft society that has made gods (with clay feet)
out of a small handful of talented but otherwise mediocre
individuals.</P>
<P>In this regard, JERRY MAGUIRE is not nearly so cynical as
NASHVILLE and that is doubtless why it will succeed
commercially but also why it could be charged with naivete.
Given the world of power and cut-throat dealing in human
flesh that the film exposes, it is perhaps silly for
writer/director Crowe to suggest that a higher and better way
is possible in the sports management industry. But the whole
film is built on such a premise: Although greed and
exploitation have a lock on big time sports, there are rare
and precious occasions when  conscience awakes, truth means
something, committments are kept, and something other than
power and money can win the day. It is a nice film that way.
If you like following professional sports, it lets you hope
some. (But watch yourself.)</P>
<P>The film also has a great device that runs throughout.
Jerry's mentor, an aging salesman, an old warrior of the deal
-- all smiles, all positive-thinking hype -- sits at his desk
and gives salesmanship lessons right out of the latest
self-help and motivational pap from the empowerment circuit.
You think of it as a running gag until his last bit of
advice: "Love your wife. Love your life. Be true. Be a good
preson." This last bit hijacks the movie out of the cynical
and into the hopeful. </P>
<P>Crowe has pulled off a substantil trick here. From within a
sub-culture very like the one he is examining, he has
provided a vehicle that will enjoy a successful run and will also
(hopefully) cause some much needed self-examination. </P>
