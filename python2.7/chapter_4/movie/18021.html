                      A movie review by Joe Barlow

<PRE>                 RATING: ***  (out of a possible ****)</PRE>
<P>        "Entrapment" is a sneaky little movie-- a child, if you will,
with one hand perpetually stuck in the cinematic cookie jar.  So taken
was I with the film's flash and style that it wasn't until driving
home after the screening that I realized just how disjointed the story
was.  Plot twists that appeared plausible (if unlikely) while watching
the film shed their coherence when subjected to mental instant-replay.
Is that enough to derail the movie?  I didn't think so, but I suppose
that's up to the individual viewer.</P>
<P>        To say much about the plot is to risk spoiling the surprise
ending(s), so I must tread carefully.  Suffice it to say that
professional burglar Robert "Mac" MacDougal (Sean Connery) and
insurance agent Virginia 'Gin' Baker (Zeta-Jones), who also dabbles in
theft, team up to pull two big jobs which could net them a paycheck in
excess of eight billion dollars.  Can they trust each other?
Certainly not, and this problem forms the cornerstone of the entire
second half of the film.  But damn, it's fun watching them try.</P>
<P>        The movie itself is skillfully directed by John Amiel, who
infuses the story with plenty of action and entertaining moments.  Nor
is the script without merit: in addition to some great Lawrence
Block-type burglar humor, "Entrapment" is one of the few films of
recent years that seems to have a pretty good grasp of how computers
work.  It's also the first story to do something intelligent and
interesting with the concept of the Year 2000 bug.  The movie's
failing, and it's not necessarily a fatal one, is a lack of coherence.
Clever pay-offs are sacrificed numerous times for cheap action-film
cliches.  Nothing new here.</P>
<P>        Also, a couple of glaring technical problems took me out of
the story.  For example, why do the security doors close so slowly
when Mac and Virginia are busted in a high-security setting?  The
whole point of these doors is to trap any burglars who make their way
into the restricted area.  Shouldn't those things SLAM shut instantly?
But no, our two thieves have ample time to continue putzing around
with the computer before casually making their escape through the not-
yet-shut doorway.  A minor problem, but irksome.  And why does
Connery's character happen to have a *parachute* of all things with
him during one puzzling scene?  (The biggest head-scratcher for me,
though, is still the duo's plan to "download" billions of dollars onto
a recordable CD-ROM.  Come again?)</P>
<P>        Sure, there are flaws, but when the performances are this
much fun, who cares?  Zeta-Jones in particular does great work
here, as I expected she would: she proved in "The Mask of Zorro"
that she's not just another pretty face, but a fine actress as well.
This film will only increase her notoriety, particularly among the
audience's hetereosexual males. Ving Rhames (from "Pulp Fiction")
also turns in a good performance in a role that's an interesting
variation on his usual hard-nosed gangster persona.</P>
<P>        "Entrapment" is by no means the year's best action-movie ("The
Matrix" still bears that distinction, at least until "The Phantom
Menace" opens in three weeks), but it's hardly the worst.  With a
great bittersweet ending that winks at "Casablanca," the film is
clever more often than not.  It's also a good deal of fun... and isn't
that why we go to the movies in the first place?</P>
