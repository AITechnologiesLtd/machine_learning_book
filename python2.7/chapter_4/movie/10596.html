<P>The House of Yes (1997) * out of ***** - Cast: Parker Posey, Josh
Hamilton, Tori Spelling, Freddie Prinze Jr., Genevieve Bujold.  Written
and Directed by: Mark Waters.  Running Time: 85 minutes.</P>
<P>Boy, there's nothing like a good dysfunctional family story.  Too bad "The
House of Yes" is a HORRIBLE dysfunctional family story.</P>
<P>"The House of Yes" is set at Thanksgiving in 1983.  Parker Posey plays
Jackie-O, a mentally disturbed woman who believes she's Jackie
Kennedy-Onassis.  Her brother (...) is coming home for the holiday and she
just couldn't be happier.  To her dismay however, he has brought along a
surprise: a fiancee (Tori Spelling, in a surprisingly good performance).</P>
<P>Things immediately turn ugly.  You see, there's a reason Jackie-O has gone
insane.  She and her brother just happened to be lovers for quite some
time.  They liked playing a game where they would re-enact the Kennedy
assassination and then proceed to have sex.  Hard to believe that could
mentally disturb someone isn't it?  I was disturbed enough to break into
sweats and cower in the fetal position just watching it.  Anyway, for some
reason they just can't resist this game once he returns home, much to the
disgust of his fiance and the younger brother in the family.</P>
<P>"The House of Yes" was adapted from a stage play by Wendy MacLeod, and the
fact that it was a stage play is warning sign number one.  There's a
reason some stories are told on stage and some on screen.  And the film
plays exactly as if it was a play, aside for moments of obnoxiously
blaring score music that come out of nowhere, usually announcing the
incest which is about to be happening.  Speaking of incest, I guess that
would have to be warning sign number two.  Need any other warning signs to
save yourself from this film?  [R]</P>
