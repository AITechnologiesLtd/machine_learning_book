<PRE>                                    HIGHWAY 61
                         A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                          Copyright 1992 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>             Capsule review:  Weird little Canadian comedy with lots
        of original and off-beat characters and a style reminiscent
        of REPO MAN.  Off-beat pair of strangers take Highway 61 from
        Thunder Bay south to New Orleans, followed by Mr. Skin, who
        may be the Devil.  A small gem of a comedy.  Rating: +2 (-4
        to +4).</PRE>
<P>        Pokey Jones (played by Dan McKellar) is the town barber of Pickerel
   Falls, Ontario.  Of course the name Pickerel Falls makes this place sound
   more scenic and exciting than it really is.  Pokey dreams of getting out of
   Pickerel Falls by playing trumpet and as a trumpet player he makes a pretty
   good barber.  Then Pokey's dog, Iggy Pup, finds a frozen body in the bathtub
   in Pokey's backyard.  Pokey is unable to revive the corpse with a hair
   dryer, but becomes famous in Pickerel Falls anyway.  His fame attracts two
   strangers to him.  One is Mr. Skin, who has come to collect the corpse's
   soul.  Uh, Mr. Skin collects souls.  (Skin: "I'll give you $20 for your
   soul."  [long pause]  Wino: "What's the catch?")  Only slightly less strange
   is a roadie who claims the corpse as her brother and wants Pokey to
   transport it and her to New Orleans ... after hiding a rubber tube full of
   drugs down the corpse's esophagus.</P>
<P>        Writer/actor Dan McKellar and director Bruce McDonald are equal
   opportunity filmmakers, laughing at people on both sides of the United
   States-Canadian border, but at the same time making some very pithy
   observations about American popular culture.  A short visit with two music
   video rock stars in a garish fancy mansion may say as much in a few minutes
   as THIS IS SPINAL TAP did in a whole film.  Then there is the father raising
   three talentless daughters to be the next Andrews Sisters.</P>
<P>        The NEW YORK TIMES reports that ROADKILL, a previous collaboration
   between McDonald and McKellar, won best film at the 1989 Toronto Film
   festival and hopefully HIGHWAY 61 will bring more attention to their films.
   They have a fresh eye for examining their world and the ability to
   repeatedly catch their viewer off-guard and off-balance.  This is a small
   independent Canadian film so it will not likely play at the big United
   States multiplexes.  Let's hope it gets distributed on video.  I rate
   HIGHWAY 61 a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
