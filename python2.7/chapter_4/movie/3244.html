<P>     With the possible exception of THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE, few of
the recent flood of "based on a true story" motion pictures have been
particularly concerned with adhering to the facts behind the tale.
MURDER IN THE FIRST is another example of a movie that strays from
historical reality to create a more dramatically-appealing product.
And, regardless of how this version raises the hackles of Alcatraz
aficionados, Marc Rocco's movie is a solid and affecting example of
film making.</P>
<P>     It's March 25, 1938, and an escape attempt from the maximum
security federal penitentiary at Alcatraz has failed.  Two of the four
escapees are dead, a third--the informant--is returned to his cell, and
the fourth--a twenty-five year old named Henri Young (Kevin Bacon)--is
placed into a dark, grimy cubicle deep beneath the ground.  There, for
three interminable years, his only respite from loneliness are the
frequent visits of guards and Associate Warden Glenn (Gary Oldman), and
the beatings they administer.</P>
<P>     When his long stint in solitary confinement ends and Young is
re-integrated into normal prison-society, revenge consumes him--a need
to lash out against the man who blew the whistle on the escape.  This
he does, driving a spoon through the victim's throat, tearing away his
life.  With no regard for the barbaric treatment which turned a petty
thief into a killer, the government tries Young for first-degree
murder--a crime that carries a death sentence.  Assigned to defend him
is an up-and-coming member of the public defender's office named James
Stamphill (Christian Slater), perhaps the only man to believe in his
client's innocence.</P>
<P>     As a court drama, there's little to distinguish MURDER IN THE
FIRST.  Sure, there are the theatrics we expect from high voltage
clashes between the defense and the prosecution, but little in the
trial sequences set MURDER IN THE FIRST apart from numerous
predecessors, many of which are far more memorable.  After all, who can
forget Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson facing each other down in A FEW
GOOD MEN?  Nothing here approaches that level.</P>
<P>     However, MURDER IN THE FIRST is as much an indictment of the penal
system as an account of one man's fight against a first degree murder
rap, and that's where the picture's strength lies.  The events leading
to Young's actions are graphically rendered, and little doubt remains
about where the responsibility lies.  The questions that arise are
whether Stamphill can prove it and, in the process, how much of his
personal security he's willing to sacrifice.</P>
<P>     Ultimately, however, it's Bacon's performance that elevates the
film.  With his astounding depiction of a man who has endured the
torments of the damned and is waging a losing battle against his own
dark fears, the actor draws the camera's focus to himself and
mesmerizes the audience with his haunted eyes and agonized cadence.
When Young says that all he really wants is a friend, Bacon's delivery
gives impact to the plea.</P>
<P>     Christian Slater is competent as Stamphill, an unusual role for an
actor who has often been likened (sometimes unfavorably) to a young
Jack Nicholson.  Here, his usual cocky cynicism is replaced by an
erstwhile sincerity.  Meanwhile, the ubiquitous and versatile Gary
Oldman is a notch more subdued than in his other recent roles (THE
PROFESSIONAL and IMMORTAL BELOVED), but the intensity has merely been
redirected.  Associate Warden Glenn is a man bubbling with internal
turmoil.</P>
<P>     Unlike THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, this movie isn't about triumph
behind prison bars.  Instead, MURDER IN THE FIRST is an unrelenting
look at the dehumanizing effects of prison life, and what can happen
when power is abused.  Some scenes may be too graphic for audience
members to view comfortably, but "comfort" isn't on director Rocco's
agenda.  Little that occurs towards the end to affect a false sense of
dramatic closure reduces the power of bearing witness to the exposure
of Henri Young's soul--or what's left after Glenn and Alcatraz have
finished with it.</P>
