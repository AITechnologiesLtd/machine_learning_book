<PRE>Pretty Woman (R) ***
Starring Richard Gere, Julia Roberts
Directed by Garry Marshall 
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Prompted by the recent Runaway Bride, (a diaster all it's own) I decided to
rent Pretty Woman to see what got this tepid film made. It all flashed before
my eyes, it was the world's first glimpse into the world of cutesy Julia
movies. A fun, inventive romantic comedy that starts and ends just like it
should.</P>
<P>Edward Lewis (Gere) buys companies, takes them apart, and sells them bit by
bit. He meets Vivian (Roberts) on Hollywood Way when he asks her for directions
to Beverly Hills. Asking her what her name is, she says "What do you want it to
be?" Needing to take a load off, he hires her for the night. Taking a liking to
her, he then hires her for a whole week.</P>
<P>But he needs to clean Vivian up. Buying her dresses and having her learn table
manners to attend various dinners so she can appear as his date soon becomes
his prime concern. He begins to fall in love with her, but it takes awhile for
her to return his affections. Vivian also helps him see through buying another
family owned company by bringing out the more emotional side of him.</P>
<P>Pretty Woman is extremely cute. Cute is the only world for it. I also liked the
fact that prostitutes are portrayed as people that need help (much in the same
way that African-American gangsters were showcased in Slam.) The film turns in
fine performances by it's two leads, but also from Hector Elizondo as the hotel
manager, and Laura San Giacomo as Julia's prostituting pal. Despite minor
cliches and problems, the fun romantic comedy Pretty Woman still gets ***
stars.</P>
<P>The Young-Uns: The title character is a prostitute and there is some sexual
discussion as well as bad attitudes towards her. There is also some mild
language. Good Age: 12 & Up</P>
