                       A film review by David Wilcock
                        Copyright 1997 David Wilcock</PRE>
<P>STARRING DAN ACKROYD, EDDIE MURPHY, JAMIE LEE CURTIS,
DON AMECHE AND RAPLH BELLAMY.</P>
<PRE>DIRECTED BY JOHN LANDIS</PRE>
<PRE>A PARAMOUNT PICTURE</PRE>
<P>John Landis's classic comedy is quite funny, although not as funny as
everynoe likes to make out. The stroy centres around The Duke Brothers
(Ameche and Bellamy) making a bet to see if a good buisnessman comes
from its genes, or is environment. The two unlucky victims are Ackroyd
(there accountant) and Murphy (a tramp.)</P>
<P>Watching Ackroyd go downhill thanks to the Dukes (and a corrupt cop) is
funny, and watching Murphy taking advantage of his new lifestyle is ok
aswell. The movie then goes a bit dead near the middle, with not much
going.</P>
<P>But its near the end that the film really starts to pick up. First, we
see Ackroyd try to frame Murphy (while in a Santa Clause suit, stuffed
with food) and then trying to kill himself. Also, the fancy dress party
on the train sequence is funny aswell. (With a dodgy sub plot centering
around a horny gorilla)</P>
<P>Overall, this film is generally quite funny, and the performances make
this film funnier than it really should be.</P>
<PRE>OVERALL=*** </PRE>
