<P>     While BED OF ROSES lacks the freshness of WHEN HARRY MET SALLY and 
the smart sensuality of BEFORE SUNRISE, it nevertheless possesses enough 
intelligence and energy to lift it into the upper echelon of 
"traditional" modern romances.  And, with so many of today's recent love 
stories originating from Jane Austen's pen, something like BED OF ROSES 
can offer a contemporary change of pace.  </P>
<P>     The film follows the expected pattern of a conventional romance:  
two characters meet and fall in love, complications arise, causing a 
breakup, then there's a reunion just in time for the end credits.  While 
BED OF ROSES offers few surprises in its formulaic progression of 
events, the tale is told with heartfelt tenderness, and, for once, the 
circumstances that threaten the pair's happiness have nothing to do with 
re-appearing old flames.</P>
<P>     In some romances, couples must cross a generational gap to be 
together.  Other times, the barrier may be cultural or racial.  In BED 
OF ROSES, each of the protagonists -- Lisa (Mary Stuart Masterson) and 
Lewis (Christian Slater) -- must overcome their own emotional 
dysfunctions in order to enter into a relationship.  As a result of 
tragic pasts, neither is confident about expressing feelings, and, while 
both are emotionally needy, they discover that receiving is often as 
hard as giving.</P>
<P>     Lewis was a happily married Wall Street mover and shaker when he 
lost both his wife and baby to childbirth.  Since then, he has devoted 
his life to his new job:  delivering flowers from the shop he owns.  He 
does it because he likes to see people's faces when they receive their 
arrangement.  In that way, he seeks solace through the ephemeral joy of 
others.</P>
<P>     Lisa had a sad, lonely childhood that she never recovered from. 
Now, to compensate for the emotional gulf in her life, she has thrown 
herself fully into her career.  With the exception of her best friend, 
Kim (the bubbly Pamela Segall), Lisa has no one to confide in or share 
with.  She's a workaholic for whom the concept of fun is "utterly beside 
the point."</P>
<P>     One night while Lewis is out for a walk, he looks up and sees Lisa 
standing by her window, crying.  Moved, and not understanding why, he 
sends her an anonymous flower arrangement.  Eventually, after being 
pressed for the sender's name, Lewis admits the truth, then follows up 
by inviting Lisa to spend the day with him, delivering flowers and 
watching people's faces.</P>
<P>     BED OF ROSES probably wants to be more literate than it succeeds at 
being.  The film belabors the symbolism of flowers, which, at one point 
or another, stand for everything from life and love to the fragility of 
emotions.  There are also messages about the importance of family and 
how the traumas of childhood affect a person's behavior as an adult.  
Not all these themes are effectively explored.  Better, however, for BED 
OF ROSES to be overambitious than for it to "dumb up" its script. </P>
<P>     Among the movie's assets are the performances of leads Mary Stuart 
Masterson (FRIED GREEN TOMATOES) and Christian Slater (BROKEN ARROW).  
Not only do these two work effectively as a couple, but each manages to 
create a sympathetic individual.  Through the nuances of Masterson's 
performance, it's possible to feel Lisa's isolation.  Likewise, Slater's 
underplaying of Lewis makes him more accessible to the audience.</P>
<P>     Both Masterson and Slater have appeared in romances before -- he in 
UNTAMED HEART and she in BENNY AND JOON.  BED OF ROSES marks a step 
forward for both actors.  And, as 1996's undisputed Valentine's Day date 
picture, this film offers the mood that couples expect from a light 
drama about love in the '90s.  Although the overall story claims little 
in the way of originality, it at least approaches its material with 
charm, which is more than can be said of many so-called love stories.</P>
