<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Robert Altman's (Short Cuts) latest film is a slow-moving,
southern-fried tale about an inbred small town and its annoying
inhabitants.  Set in Holly Springs, Mississippi, Fortune is cleverly
acted, but unfortunately its script is on the fast track to the tri-city
area of Predictaville, Boringstown and Dullsburg (which is, ironically,
just outside of Holly Springs).</P>
<P>Altman is the most celebrated ensemble-cast director of recent memory,
but his direction can't save the blah story by first-time writer Anne
Rapp, who previously was a script supervisor for The American President
and The Color Purple.  Her story centers around a rich eccentric widow
named Jewel Mae Orcutt (Patricia Neal, Hud) or "Cookie" to her friends.
She has a warm, Driving Miss Daisy-type relationship with Willis
Richland (Charles S. Dutton, Get on the Bus), the town drunk and catfish
enchilada guru, but on the eve of Easter she decides to blow her brains
out in hopes of being reunited with her late husband.  This simple
premise takes over thirty minutes to set up.</P>
<P>The trouble is that Cookie's carcass was discovered by her busybody
niece Camille Orcutt (Glenn Close, Paradise Road), who, believing she
will be the heiress to the Orcutt fortune, decides to make the suicide
look like a murder.  Since his prints were all over the gun - he had
cleaned Cookie's collection the previous evening –Willis becomes the
most likely suspect and is immediately incarcerated.</P>
<P>The rest of the film unfolds like a bed sheet forged in extra static
cling.  The only thing that livens it up are the kooky characters –
especially Julianne Moore (Psycho) as Cora Duvall, Camille's nitwit
sister and the star of the town church's stage presentation of Oscar
Wilde's `Salome.'  Things liven up a bit once Courtney B. Vance (The
Preacher's Wife) shows up to investigate the murder/suicide, but by that
point the film has already overstayed its welcome.  All the viewer can
do is sit back, relax, and wait for the obligatory shot of someone
getting caught with their hand in the cookie jar.</P>
<P>2:00 – PG-13 for violence, sexual content and some mild adult language</P>
