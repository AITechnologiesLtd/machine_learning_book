<PRE>"It's not just snow ... there's rocks and ice."
Vertical Limit</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony </PRE>
<P>Hanging from a cliff in Monument valley, Chris O'Donnell and Robin 
Tunney sing "Take it to the limit one more time." It's a breath-taking 
scene - so bring plenty of breath with you. In the beat of an eye, slip 
of the foot, snap of a rope, these siblings meet up again halfway around 
the world in the Pakistani Himalayas. Dessert to snowcaps, this film 
takes climbing to the extremes. </P>
<P>And therein lies the anchor of the film, not just big climbing, but big 
climbing slips, slides and falls. At precisely these times when expert 
climbers lose their grip, the film becomes ... well, most gripping. The 
plot, clich» motivations and complications are just rote steps strollin' 
up a mountain. </P>
<P>The dialogue, like the film itself, is plagued by peaks and valleys. At 
one moment a sharp satirical line gets the crowd laughing, the next 
moment, a serious line ... well, gets the crowd laughing (if you know 
what I mean). And though I liked the international assemblage of 
climbers, the wind and less than perfect sound quality conspired to make 
still other lines difficult to understand. </P>
<P>Visually, the film is mostly tight. Besides the excellent special 
effects, there's a fantastic shot of two young leopards play-fighting in 
the snow. Unfortunately, focus problems irritate other images throughout 
the production. </P>
<P>Because the story plays second fiddle to the action, scenes that should 
be touching ... really aren't. In fact, the most endearing characters 
are a couple of secondary goofballs -- sort of the Beavis and Butthead 
or Trapper and Hawkeye of the Himalayas. </P>
<P>Whelp then, to summit up, though some of the action sequences are a bit 
"over the edge," they're great fun to watch. If you're not in the mood 
for compelling drama and just want to enjoy a bumpy ride - take yourself 
to the "Vertical Limit." </P>
