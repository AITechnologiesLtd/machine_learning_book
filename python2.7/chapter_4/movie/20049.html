<P>After the terminally bleak Reservoir Dogs and the brutally violent Pulp
Fiction, Jackie Brown seems like something of a light-hearted departure
for Quentin Tarantino. It's more of a ho-hum heist story with characters
that speak the Tarantino language. Luckily, his showcase of actors
convert every morsel of possible enjoyment onto the screen, and Jackie
Brown has no trouble entertaining the average viewer.</P>
<P>The story introduces us to a street-wise black woman named Jackie Brown
(Pam Grier), a flight attendant who smuggles money and drugs from one
destination to another. She works for a bottom-of-the-barrel airline and
receives a minimal salary. But one day, she is picked up by a pair of
Federal Officials (including Michael Keaton as the tough-nosed Ray
Nicolet), and found with a handsome load of cash and a small bag of
smuggled dope. Jackie is working for a weapons dealer named Ordell
(Samuel L. Jackson), who pays her bail money but suspects her of tipping
off the feds about their operation. Soon Jackie and Ordell are plotting
a way to smuggle $500,000 through to them under Nicolet's nose, with the
help of Ordell's oaf of a partner (Robert De Niro) and drugged-out lady
friend (Bridget Fonda).</P>
<P>Also entering the picture is a bail-bondsman named Max Cherry (Robert
Forster), who takes a liking to Jackie and agrees at one point to make
the situation even more complicated (how I won't say). The big drop-off
is undoubtedly the high point of Jackie Brown, in which numerous
double-crosses take place and many clothing store bags (filled with
cash) switch hands. It's unfortunate that Tarantino takes his sweet time
getting there, and doesn't offer anything extremely compelling while
doing so. There are, as always, amusing exchanges between characters.
The funniest repartee is between De Niro and Fonda, as he becomes
annoyed with her constant bickering while making fun of his IQ, or lack
thereof. The most interesting relationship is between Max and Jackie. A
56-year old white bail bondsman and a 44-year old black flight attendant
with believable chemistry? You've got to commend the acting.</P>
<P>Jackie Brown is a seriously dragged-out exercise enlivened by such fine
acting. The film clocks in at a lengthy 2 hours, 35 minutes. Tarantino's
talky style manages to hold your attention heavily, but there are more
than a few dramatic lapses and crucial lulls in the storyline. Also,
fans of the director should be prepared for a lighter side to appear.
Jackie Brown has four major shootings, and two of those take place
mostly off-screen, so don't be expecting a typical Tarantino bloodbath.
You can expect frequent foul language, mostly coming way of Ordell, who
(much to the dismay of Spike Lee) uses the `N' word as part of his
regular vocabulary.</P>
<P>The acting is the glue that holds everything together. Grier, making a
sudden comeback from her reign in the 1970's, is more than adequate for
the title character. In fact, she's flat-out great. Another comeback
comes from former TV star Robert Forster, who does a grand job as Max
Cherry, and is perfectly cast in doing so. Michael Keaton makes his
presence felt, albeit in small but dignified moments, and De Niro is
ideal in playing the lug-head who goes over the edge. Speaking of that,
Bridget Fonda has relatively little to do as Ordell's bikini-clad beach
babe, and yet she manages to look fairly occupied.</P>
<P>There's not a single sign of misplaced dialogue or snubbed line
throughout the entire movie. Which is a life-saver for Mr. Tarantino.
The story barely holds together in the meantime, and we merely get a
small tremor whenever there should be a defeaning earthquake. But oh
well. Jackie Brown manages to be an enjoyable detour from Quentin
Tarantino, even if it is lacking the glaring and original bite of his
previous work. Let's just hope that the director hasn't gone soft on us.</P>
