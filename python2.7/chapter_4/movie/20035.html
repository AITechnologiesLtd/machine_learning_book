<P>Who doesn't love the Muppets? They're an adorable and colorful group of
furry characters that carry a certain charm wherever they go. Seeing
them in Muppets From Space, however, is somewhat of a letdown. Unlike
their previous outings, this sixth installment is poorly written and
choppily constructed, and Kermit and the gang can only go so far on
their own charm.</P>
<P>The Great Gonzo, the likable big-nosed whatzit we all know and love, has
been promoted from supporting player to lead. In a clever opening dream
sequence, Gonzo is fighting gusty winds to get to Noah (F. Murray
Abraham) and his ark which is just leaving for the long journey. When
Noah asks Gonzo what species he is, the blue Muppet is at a loss for
words. The truth is, Gonzo knows nothing about his family roots, and
Noah turns him away in confusion.</P>
<P>The plot concerns Gonzo attempting to discover what he is, and where
exactly he came from. His brothers hear the cries for help and send him
messages in his Alphabet cereal, and after a brief meeting with the
Cosmic Fish (`May the fish be with you!'), Gonzo realizes that he is a
deserted member of an alien race. Unfortunately, a paranoid government
operative (Jeffrey Tambor) in charge of monitoring extra-terrestrial
activity is also involved. He will stop at nothing to prevent the
landing of Gonzo's alien family, including destroying them for the
supposed well-being of America. Yes, it's another villain with
absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever.</P>
<P>This is not one of the better Muppet adventures. The plot is flat and
shockingly devoid of the clever screen-writing that always assists these
characters and magnifies their jokes. Once in a while, there is a
refreshing taste of what the Muppets stand for - cute, cleverly placed
retorts and innocent charm. But there is simply not enough to fuel a
ninety minute movie. The Muppets are a charming and sweet-natured bunch,
but not even they can carry an entire film without a sensible script
backing their every step. Kermit's better qualities are not on display,
Miss Piggy has been transformed into a kung-fu warrior who shows no
remorse, and even the Swedish chief doesn't speak as much nonsensical
gibberish as he used to. The Muppets still have potential, but this is
not the movie for them.</P>
<P>Another bonus of a Muppet movie are the enjoyable musical numbers, which
are unwisely discarded here until the final presentation of the 70's
funk hit `Celebration'. More toe-tapping songs and less draggy, familiar
plot additions could have been the recipe for a smoother final product.
The plot uses elements from Star Wars, Independence Day and Star Trek -
but usually not to the clever effect that we'd hope for. Muppets From
Space feels like a plastic-wrapped version of the earlier films that's
been sitting on the counter and drained of all inventive satire.</P>
<P>Keeping one tradition alive, there are numerous star cameos abounding
here. Brief appearances range from Ray Liotta to Hollywood Hogan, David
Arquette to Andie MacDowell, and so on. But none have the memorable
presence they deserve, and Tambor is wasted as the only big name star to
appear in more than a handful of scenes. The performers, both human and
puppet, try desperately to inject more spice into this pointless and
rambling excursion. But too much in the script is tired and formulaic,
including scientific devices like invisible spray, for them to have a
substantial effect on what sadly remains a sub-par Muppet outing.</P>
<P>Nonetheless, I am not entirely pessimistic about the future of Jim
Henson's marvelous creations. One poor script doesn't derail the entire
franchise, but it does raise certain questions. Perhaps the Muppets have
had their day, and even if their legacy finishes on a bland note, they
will always be remembered with a pleasant smile.</P>
