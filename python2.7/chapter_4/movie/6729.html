<PRE>                          BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO AMERICA
                      A film review by Laura & Robin Clifford
                       Copyright 1997 Laura & Robin Clifford</PRE>
<P>(This review is an excerpt from Reeling, a movie review show hosted by
Laura and Robin Clifford, running on Boston Cable TV. Note that the
film descriptions vary in completeness due to the fact that they're
actually intros for running film clips.)</P>
<PRE>BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO AMERICA
-------------------------------</PRE>
<P>is MTV's second foray into feature films with their dynamic idiotic
adolescent duo who we're used to seeing commenting on music videos.
None of that here as the film begins with the theft of their beloved
TV. As they search for a replacement, they're mistaken for the hitmen
sent to 'do' somebody's wife in Las Vegas.  Thinking that they're
being paid to score for the first time with the buxom blonde, they
excitedly take off only to end up as dupes in a plot to steal a
germ-warfare device, become named the most dangerous men in America
and wreck havoc with nuns and senior citizens across the U.S.A. </P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>While I've only caught Beavis and Butt-head on MTV a few times and was
barely just slightly amused, I must admit that "Beavis and Butt-Head
Do America" made me laugh (in fact, I'm still giggling)! </P>
<P>The animation for the feature length film is a cut above what's used
on TV - in fact, it reminded me of Ralph Bashki's animation ("Fritz
the Cat", "American Pop").</P>
<P>What's appealing about the film isn't stylistic tough - it's the
dumber than a plug humor.  Beavis and Butt-Head are intellectually
stunted adolescents who look for sexual innuendo in everything that's
said (i.e., translating 'entertain us' into "He said 'anus'."
heh-heh-heh. Just imagine Butt-Head's delight when a commercial
jetliner pilot tells him to 'get out of his cockpit'!</P>
<P>Beavis had me in stitches when, after consuming a vast and varied
amount of pills from a senior citizen's handbag, he freaks, wears his
t-shirt over his head and jammers "I am Cornholio - give me teepee for
my bunghole."  Silly?  Vastly.  Funny?  Well, at least I though so...</P>
<P>Besides this idiocy we also get our two lads mistakenly thinking
church confessional stalls are porto-potties (with hilarious results),
an FBI agent (voiced by Robert Stack) with a penchant for full cavity
searches and a couple of old-timers with a camper who never avoid
crossing paths with their nemeses.</P>
<P>It should be noted that Beavis and Butt-Head are all about sex and
drugs and rock and roll and, while there is no animated nudity or bad
language used, they may not be suitable for small children.</P>
<P>"Beavis and Butt-Head Do America" is good dumb fun and a movie that
definitely does not suck.</P>
<PRE>B</PRE>
<PRE>ROBIN:</PRE>
<P>"Beavis and Butt-head Do America" creator, Mike Judge, may not have
aimed very high with the brand of humor used in this film, but he sure
succeeds in hitting his comic target a very high percentage of the
time.</P>
<P>The humor put forth in "B&BDA" consists almost entirely of body parts
(mostly female), being naked (all female), sluts (the female kind),
boobs (guess which gender), poop, anti-authority, and TV. You can see
that this is not the kind of film intended to appeal to the art-house
crowd. </P>
<P>BUT, if theres a side of you which appreciates extraordinarily
low-brow humor, done successfully to excess some of the time, then
"Beavis and Butt-head Do America" will attract you.</P>
<P>I have only seen a few minutes of the MTV series, but what I saw
turned me off from seeing the movie. Biting  the bullet, I went, I
saw, I laughed.</P>
<P>The B&B characters are so clueless that Mike Judge is able to draw two
completely different worlds - our normal world, and the one lived in
by our duo. Judge parallels these worlds well, with collisions - all
B&B instigated - of these worlds taking place all along the way.</P>
<P>Beavis and Butt-head, in their overwhelming desire to score, succeed
in breaking the Hoover Dam, blacking out Las Vegas, causing a massive
traffic accident on the Washington D.C. beltway, taking over the US
Senate PA system, and forcing the Strategic Air Command to go to
DEFCOM 4. All this in 80 minutes!</P>
<P>Technically, the animation is of surprisingly high quality - beyond
B&B, that is. Mike Judge populates his story with a number of colorful
characters, such as Dallas and Buddy (voiced by Demi Moore and Bruce
Willis), a couple of gun-runners; a lunatic ATF agent (Robert Stack)
who demands that everyone, victims included, be given a full body
cavity search; and, a nice old couple, whose camper B&B commandeer
from time to time for privacy when the urge to whack off comes upon
them.</P>
<P>The repetitive nature of B&Bs low-grade humor works pretty well here,
especially when Beavis gets jeeped up on caffeine stimulants and
sugar, turning in to his alter ego, Cornholio. Judges pushed
Cornholios hijinks far past the point of good taste, but still gets
consistent laughs.</P>
<P>The music video numbers, from Isaac Hayes' rewriting the "Theme to
Shaft" for our boys, to the Red Hot Chili Peppers "Love
Rollercoaster", are a good melding of music and animation. Very
entertaining.</P>
<P>"Beavis and Butt-head Do America" is a solid, comic film, filled with
humor and wittiness at a gutter level rarely achieved in film.</P>
<P>No sequel, please, but, I still give "Beavis and Butt-head Do America"
a B.</P>
