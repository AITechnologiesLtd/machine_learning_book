<PRE>THE KING IS ALIVE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Since she used to work in the theater, Gina (Jennifer Jason Leigh) 
eagerly accepts the chance to play the central role of Cordelia in "King 
Lear."  Her unexplained theatrical job might well have been at a place 
called something like the Pussy Cat Lounge, but Gina is nonetheless 
delighted.  The problem, in Kristian Levring's THE KING IS ALIVE, is the 
circumstance which causes this opportunity for Gina to arise.</P>
<P>As Gina travels with a random collection of tourists, the bus gets lost 
on a dirt road and runs out of gas in an extremely barren section of the 
African desert.  Luckily they find an abandoned mining town nearby where 
they can take shelter until the hoped for rescuers arrive.  In order to 
pass the time, a Shakespearean trained English actor among them suggests 
that they put on a production of "King Lear."  Some find the idea 
complete folly, but eventually most of them begin to take part.  Most of 
the lines of the play, of course, seem to apply to their situation.</P>
<P>The hot desert sun quickly fries their brains and nerves, causing them 
scandalously to say exactly what they are really thinking rather than 
the polite blather that we usually take for conversation.  In the superb 
cast, Bruce Davison and Janet McTeer play Ray and Liz, a sad, childless 
couple.  She's a bitch, and he's a cynic, a fact to which they both seem 
unhappily resigned.  "You don't have to worry, you know," Liz tells Ray 
about the play, when she wants to take part but he doesn't.  "Nobody has 
to fall in love, and everyone gets to die in the end."</P>
<P>The acerbic script by Anders Thomas Jensen and Kristian Levring has 
characters generally going after each other with words rather than 
showy, emotional outbursts.  The film, shot according to the strict 
Dogme 95 rules, features all natural lighting and sets.  It is one of 
the few Dogme films that is actually enhanced by the technique.  Here 
the harsh lighting and the intimate, handheld camerawork blend in 
perfectly with the austerity of the setting.  </P>
<P>The picture, however, does have its logical and technical problems.  The 
characters stay outside and get parched by the glaring sun when it would 
only make sense to perform the play indoors.  And why cinematographer 
Jens Schlosser keeps framing scenes so that people's eyes, the most 
expressive part of one's anatomy, are chopped off remains a mystery.  </P>
<P>As their strength wanes and it looks like no one will ever come to save 
them, the story gets more and more intriguing.  And, as their minds 
become focused on survival, the human drama ratchets up in intensity.  
The ending will not be satisfying to everyone, but this isn't the type 
of picture that is made to appeal to the masses.  Suffice it to say that 
it worked for me.</P>
<P>THE KING IS ALIVE runs 1:45.  It is rated R for sexuality and language 
and would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
<P>The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, June 8, 2001.  
In the Silicon Valley, it will be showing at the Camera Cinemas.</P>
