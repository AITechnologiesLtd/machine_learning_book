                           Jude (1996)
                   A film review by Ben Hoffman
                    Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Director Winterbottom says of Thomas Hardy's classic novel, "I
think the most impressive thing about Hardy is that he takes very
ordinary people in very ordinary circumstances, puts them through the
most extraordinary experiences and transforms them into heroes and
heroines. "</P>
<P>     When Jude Fawley was a teenager (Ross Colvin Turnbull)) his
ambition was to go to a good college.  This was encouraged by a
professor Phillotson (Liam Cunningham) .  (As an adult, Jude is played
by Christopher Eccleston.)   This was in the eighteen hundreds when a
good education was looked upon as the way out of one's humdrum life
which, in the case of Jude, was that of a stone mason.</P>
<P>     As nothing ever goes smoothly, Jude is seduced by Arabella Donn
(Rachel Griffiths), the daughter of a local pig farmer.  He and
Arabella, with whom he really has nothing in common, marry. . . and
the marriage ends in failure.   Jude decides to leave for
Christminster, a prestigious school, where he can study and still earn
some money as a stone mason.   There he meets a cousin, Sue Bridehead
(the lovely Kate Winslet) and he falls for her charm, wit and beauty.</P>
<P>     That should have made everything wonderful for them but Sue loses
her job and Jude makes the big mistake of introducing her to
Phillotson in the hope that he will employ her as an assistant in his
school.   But soon Sue and Phillotson are seeing a lot of each other.
Although she really loves Jude, when he tells her that he had been
married it puts a crimp in their relationship.  Remember this was not
the 1960s and thereafter.  What follows  is the story's tragic
denouement and a real tragedy it is..</P>
<P>     Fine acting all around.  Directed by Michael Winterbottom.</P>
