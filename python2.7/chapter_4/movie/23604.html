<P>Despite 15 years of experience in movies, Madonna has rarely seemed as
comfortable on the big screen as she has on MTV or on a concert stage.</P>
<P>Perhaps having to follow a script cramps her creativity. She
effortlessly vamped her way through such steamy videos as "Erotica"
and "Bad Girl" but froze up when she was called upon to play a man
eater in the 1993 thriller "Body of Evidence." Although she's often
witty in interviews, her sense of humor has often deserted her in such
comedies as "Who's That Girl?" and "Shanghai Surprise."</P>
<P>To date, Madonna's most effective film work has come from playing
either larger-than-life icons (the indomitable Eva Peron in "Evita"
and the voluptuous nightclub singer Breathless Mahoney in "Dick
Tracy") or nonconformists with a sense of humor about themselves (the
New Wave gypsy Susan in "Desperately Seeking Susan" and the saucy
baseball player Mae in "A League of Their Own").</P>
<P>But whether it's due to a newfound maturity as an actress or her
off-camera role as a first-time mom, Madonna has rarely seemed as much
at home in a movie as she does in the seriocomic "The Next Best
Thing." She has a few awkward moments here and there, but she's
otherwise well-cast as Abbie, a woman speeding toward 40 without a
husband (which she might like) or a child (which she truly wants).</P>
<P>Despite her career as a yoga instructor, Abbie still finds fault with
her looks and her body. Gazing at herself in the mirror, Abbie raises
her breasts and whispers "1989," then lets them droop and murmurs
miserably "1999."</P>
<P>What Abbie does have, however, is a best friend, Robert (Rupert
Everett), who's always there to mop up her tears or mix up an
emergency margarita when she needs it most.  The tenderness of the
relationship is completely believable because of the easy and
affectionate way Everett and Madonna play off of each other. If they
ever decided to dip their toes in the talk show pool, Madonna and
Everett could make a sensational substitute for Regis and Kathie Lee.</P>
<P>Anyhow, back to our story: Robert would be the perfect man for Abbie,
except that he's gay ("He definitely falls into the 'What a waste!'
category," says one of Abbie's friends).  But one sizzling
Independence Day weekend, when both are feeling particularly low,
Abbie and Robert down too many drinks, dance themselves into a frenzy
and end up getting much closer than they ever have before. Their
one-time-only tryst ends in confusion, regret and, to everyone's
shock, pregnancy.</P>
<P>Although it initially sets itself up as a comedy, "The Next Best
Thing" slowly evolves into a surprisingly thoughtful study of family
life and moves easily from lighthearted romp to poignant drama under
the guidance of John Schlesinger, the British director who often seems
to take a personal interest in projects that examine American values
in a changing society (such as "Midnight Cowboy" and "The Falcon and
the Snowman").</P>
<P>If Abbie can't have everything she wants, she's willing to settle for
an unconventional arrangement in which she and Robert can live in the
same house and bring up their son together. But the situation becomes
increasingly complicated as the years go by and Abbie becomes involved
with Ben (Benjamin Bratt), a kind man who could provide the stability
and romance she's always sought.</P>
<P>Commendably, Thomas Ropelewski's screenplay refuses to vilify or
sanctify any of the principal characters, all of whom make some
mistakes and say things they later regret as the stakes become
higher. Even Robert, who's initially the most sympathetic of
characters, gets progressively more defensive when he feels threatened
by Ben and Abbie's plans, and Everett, one of the most disarming stars
currently working, doesn't shy away from letting us in on Robert's
insecurities and anxieties.</P>
<P>Even as the movie becomes progressively more serious, Ropelewski's
dialogue remains peppered with barbs, most of them aimed at the
ignorance of the well-meaning people around Abbie and Robert. A
concerned young woman asks if Abbie's baby will be gay, and Abbie
responds, "Will your kids be stupid?" When one uncouth little boy uses
a politically incorrect term to refer to Robert's love life, a girl
quickly chastises him.  "You're supposed to say 'same-sex partner'!"
she scolds.</P>
<P>Although its subject matter is decidedly contemporary, "The Next Best
Thing" has the ravishing production design of a vintage Technicolor
extravaganza. The colors are vibrant, from the teal curtains in
Abbie's house to the startlingly red flowers in the garden, and Elliot
Davis photographs Everett, Madonna and Bratt lovingly, bathing them in
the golden glow of candles or the cold blue lights of the city. If
every film looked this good, going to the movies would be a whole lot
easier on the eyes.</P>
