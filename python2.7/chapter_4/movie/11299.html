<PRE>REVIEW:  Liar Liar
by Luke Buckmaster</PRE>
<P>The rubber faced antics of Jim Carey have delighted and even disgusted 
audiences worldwide since the dawn of his career.  Perhaps impressing more 
people as an animated "mask" rather than a Pet Detective, Carey has earnt many 
loyal fans in his short lived in Hollywood spotlight - and expectations were 
high.  For the number one actor in Hollywood, the dismal success of the Cable 
Guy hurt his career badly, as he plundered down in fame and credibility.  Now 
the stakes have fallen, and it is a great time for a great comeback, which will 
in turn gain more fans than he ever had before.</P>
<P>Fletcher Reed (Jim Carey) is not your typical lawyer.  He isn't afraid to bend 
evidence to the needs of his case - not to mention lie, hurt and deceive his 
way to the top of his profession, crushing opponents and even those who care 
about him along the way.  Although some say he indeed fits the description of 
the typical lawyer, Fletcher's character is definitely appealing to the general 
population - and Carey is perfect for this role.  Fletcher's son Max is the 
person who is most affected by his unorthodox and inconsiderate life style, he 
loves his father but hardly gets to spend any quality time with him.  So when 
his birthday comes along, Max makes a simple wish - that his father cannot lie 
for a day.  Surprise surprise, it comes true.</P>
<P>Some hilarious, witty scenes are to follow as Fletcher slowly discovers that he 
is able to tell nothing but the truth - which spells doom for an involving 
court case that he must win for the benefit of his career.  Reed then finds 
himself resisting beggars, insulting strangers, smashing into concrete walls 
and even wrestling a blue pen to discover the error in his ways and ultimately 
change his life for the better.  And after discovering that Max and his ex-wife 
are moving to Boston, Fletcher is now caught up in a race against time to save 
his family and his soul.</P>
<P>The critics have has their say against this movie, but at the end of the day 
the fact remains that it is brilliantly funny and consistent throughout.  
Really the only major fault I could find in this film was the possibility that 
you won't hear some of the dialogue due to severe laughter around you, which 
was true in my case and I'm sure many others too.  Jim Carey is nothing but a 
delight to the film, showing that he can not only do his usual overacting 
routine but also proving to critics that he can provide genuine heart felt 
acting.  In all honesty, Liar Liar is simply the best of its kind, and I would 
think twice before I say that Carey will produce a better film later on in his 
career.  Liar Liar has been a worldwide success because this is, simply, 
brilliant - in all senses of the word.</P>
<P>4 = STARS
Jim Carey, a simple yet effective plot and continuous chuckles is the perfect 
ingredient for success </P>
