<PRE>Message in a Bottle (1999, PG-13)</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Luis Mandoki</PRE>
<PRE>Written by Gerald Di Pego</PRE>
<PRE>Based on the novel by Nicolas Sparks</PRE>
<P>Starring Kevin Costner and Robin Wright Penn</P>
<P> Most days I would love to be in the shoes of people in Hollywood.  Much as
participating in the play is every secret playwright's dream, and painting
the picture is every secret photographer's dream, being in THE BIZ is the
secret dream of every movie critic I know.  We apply to film school.  We try
to make movies.  Some of us even write them, such as Roger Ebert, author of
the movie Beyond the Valley of the Dolls.</P>
<P> But, one person to another, I wouldn't be in Robin Wright Penn's shoes if
you paid me a million dollars.</P>
<P> Robin Wright Penn, you see, is married to Sean Penn, who snubs the
Hollywood mainstream, and, if there are two words beyond "It Sucked" that
describe Message In a Bottle, "achingly mainstream" would have to be my
choice.  Predictable to a T, bitingly sweet, it just wasn't a movie I could
connect with.  It is not the chick flick in the aspect that it is chic to go
to, as She's all That would be, but instead the chick flick, as in the
perfect example of a reason not to make movies like that.</P>
<P> Based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks, the screenplay comes off as an
uninspired, unintelligent event.  The attempts that it makes to insert
professionalism and lyricism into the script come off as downright stupid as
the attempts often made in techno-thrillers to take on serious subjects,
such as medical ethics (should the doctor play God?) or religion itself.</P>
<P> The basic plot of the terribly contrived story is that Teresa (Robin Wright
Penn) discovers a message in a bottle while jogging in Virginia,
consequently, she publishes this in the Chicago Sun Times and begins her
search for the writer, a woman on a mission and in love (has Hollywood ever
stopped insulting you, ladies?).  What she finds is Kevin Costner.</P>
<P> Robin Wright Penn, formerly Jenny of Forrest Gump fame, does a nose-dive on
the bad-roles-for-good-people tree and hits every branch on the way down,
coming off as a stupid main character that can be connected to only by
people of similar intelligence.  Kevin Costner, straight off of The Postman,
disappoints yet again, and proves that in Hollywood, sex appeal sells.  His
character, at least to me, came off as a Homo-repressed idiot.</P>
<P> Paul Newman, the only good part of last summer's Twilight, disappoints yet
again as the father of Kevin Costner in the movie I love to hate.</P>
<P> Now, I'm sure a lot of people liked this tale because it filled the
likeable criterion: sweet, moderately funny, character-driven with a
storyline so formula that it could have very well been a movie done without
a script.  But, as for me, and any other movie buff, you will dread this
film.  This is a symptom of the greater disease of the terribly cliche films
that Hollywood turns out.</P>
<P> What else to bash?  Oh, yeah, the direction.  The direction consists of
shots stolen from
different movies: sex during a thunderstorm, a boat being launched, grainy
film met to represent the past, a complete absence of sound during emotional
pseudo-tension, and let's not forget the lightning flashing as Kevin Costner
discovers the secret of Robin Wright Penn.</P>
<P> Personally, I think it's time to send a message to Hollywood.  Don't just
stop making mainstream trash, but stop making films that rub off as
insulting to women because they portray them as drooling idiots.  And worse
for the Y-chromosome, don't make any that portray all men as Kevin Costners,
make them jerks, and still have the main character fall in love with them.</P>
<P> I plead you, producers, hack writers, directors, help me out.  Make a smart
character for a change, please.</P>
