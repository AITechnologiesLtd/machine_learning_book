<P>You don't need special effects or the supernatural to make a horror movie.
"In the Company of Men" is perhaps he most horrifying film of the year, yet
it's all done with naturalism, minimalism and three main characters in
"real" though anonymous sets.</P>
<P>The plot is diabolically simple. Ten years out of college, two old
classmates work for an unspecified firm's headquarters in an unspecified
city as junior or middle executives. We meet them in an airport lounge, one
of those bland, anonymouss, faceless spaces where business people can be
found. The anonymity applies throughout to buildings, offices, cubicles,
restaurants, etc., not to mention dark suits and white shirts. One of the
men is Chad, who looks like one of those cookie-cutter ex-Joe College
"boys" that some people go for --but then some people also go for Joe
Camel. The other is Howard, shorter, vaguely nerdy-ish, wearing glasses. He
outranks Chad in the firm.</P>
<P>They are waiting for the plane to take them for a six-week stay at a branch
of their outfit, in a non-specified city. (F.y.i. the end credits thank
Fort Wayne, Indiana). Howard is nursing an ear bitten, it  would seem, by
his now alienated fiancee (or perhaps wife). The movie does have the nasty
habit of trying to be so coyly generic, in the special sense of "this can
apply to anyone, anywhere," that it  can get counterproductive. It
distracts the viewer by holding back bits that, if given,  would not have
tainted the "purity" of the script.</P>
<P>Chad is a misanthrope, a hater of everything he can name, from the
machinations of the world of business to his stab-you-in-the back
colleagues to ...you name it. He is also someone who seems to think of
himself as a Don Juan, and is a misogynist seducer. (That's no
contradiction by many interpretations of Don Juan). Right now, he is
seething because it would appear (note how prudently I phrase this) that
his current girl friend has jilted him.</P>
<P>At the airport and on the plane, working himself up to a sickly level of
fury, he hatches a plan and enlists the less polemical Howard's
collaboration. To take their revenge on women, they should cast around for
a good subject during their six-week tour of duty, both of them seduce her,
then discard her. "She'll be reaching for the sleeping pills within a week
and you and me, we'll laugh about this until we're very old men." This is
like extermination camp talk by the SS.</P>
<P> Howard, albeit less sanguine, goes along. At the new work-place, their
victim is spotted: Christine, a pretty temp typist who has been deaf since
age eight but can speak haltingly, slowly, with those special intonations
of deaf persons.</P>
<P>The men go to work on her, dating her without letting her know that they
are colleagues. Chad turns on the charm, or what passes for charm, while
ridiculing the woman's speech to his buddy. Awkward Howard is more polite
about her yet at first shows subtle lechery. After he has complimented
Christine on her looks, heating her say she has a sister, he knee-jerkily
pops the question: "You have any pictures?"</P>
<P>Back at the office, it's all friendly talk with miscellaneous colleagues
and badmouthing the same as soon as they're out of the room. Politics
reign. Hypocrisy and insecurity reach Mach 3. Sexist jokes abound. Cruelty
to man and women is the order of the day (and the week, and the years). To
put it simply, the two men are crude,callous louts. Could many other men be
far behind?</P>
<P>The movie is the first film effort by Neil LaBut, a known playwright. In an
interview he has made some statements that prove to me how differently
creators and critics can interpret things. "The film has a lot of laughs."
I didn't see any, riveted as I was by the nastiness on the screen. "Then
the situation turns vicious. I love the idea of pulling people in and
turning on them. For instance, seducing them into thinking that Chad is
amusing and even charming, only to leave them shocked when they discover
later just how much of a viper he really is." I can't see this. Chad is a
sickening fellow from the start. You don't have to wait for him to
humiliate a black trainee, or to cheat in business matters on his pal
Howard to realize this.</P>
<P>The film's structure calls for seven divisions, from Week One through Week
Six, plus A Few Weeks Later. Each section fades to black and the next one
is announced by aggressive, ominous, indeed scary drum beats. The camera
remains mostly static, with shots that often distance us from the subjects.
This may be partly the result of a tiny budget of $25,000, if you believe
the information, which one should generally not do with low-cost
independent productions, since the smaller the sum announced the more
admiration is engendered. But there is also a stage strategy, Brechtian
perhaps, to keep the villains at arm's length.</P>
<P>As the seductions or tentative relationships proceed, there is much
ambiguity about who may be sincere or not, and there develops definitely an
unforeseen situation which leads the men to lie to each other.</P>
<P>More, I will not reveal, but take my word for it, it is very well handled
and, as the trend goes of late, without real closure. It was a hit at the
last Sundance Festival, even as many hated its characters, although the
news of "very controversial" seem like hype for the more logical "very
discussed."</P>
<P>The casting and acting by the lead thespians, not big names but
experienced, is superior. Stacy Edwards, who is not deaf, gives a terrific,
tour-de-force performance, quiet and entirely convincing</P>
<P>I am a bit confused by the penultimate sequence, when the now demoted
(courtesy of his buddy) Howard visits Chad in his new apartment and where
something to do with decamped girl friend Suzanne comes up. But setting
aside iffy spots, the movie is a powerful indictment of certain men and
above all of the mentality that our cutthroat world generates within a
corporate society (note the word "company" in the title) where the goal,
from Academe to Politics to Zoos, is "get there, keep  the job and climb
the ladder, no matter how." That's the sad story, not of Chad and Howard,
but more generally of Calvin Coolidge's dictum " The business of America is
business."</P>
