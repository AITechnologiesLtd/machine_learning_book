                       A film review by Anil Nair
                        Copyright 1989 Anil Nair</PRE>
<P>LITTLE VERA: A disappointing slice-of-life film from Russia.  This movie touted
as ushering in a new age of freedom and openness in Russian cinema turns out to
be a failure primarily because of some bad filmmaking.  It distracts you enough
that you don't care for the story nor the characters.  The only redeeming
aspect of the film is a peek into contemporary Russian life which is hard to
come by.  If Sergei Eisenstein and BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN is what you have come to
expect of Soviet cinema, skip this one.   Oh, and I didn't say anything about
the first scenes of sexuality on the Russian screen, because there is nothing
inspiring about it to talk about.</P>
<P>LA LECTRICE: A delightful French film with Miou Miou as a reader who turns her
passion for reading into a profession.  Her encounters with her varied clients
form the background for a subtle and amusing film where fiction and reality
fade in and out of each other.  She reads Maupassant to the bedridden teenager,
Duras to a lonely businessman who wants to be her lover, Karl Marx (on the
value of precious metals) to an old lady, and Lewis Carroll to a little girl,
and an old judge wants to be read from Marquis de Sade.   The woman who sat
behind me seemed to be enjoying it a lot more and made me wonder if I missed
something because I didn't understand French too well.</P>
