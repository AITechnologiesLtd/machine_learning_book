<P> I want to say this at the outset: I think John Carpenter is a genius.
Anyone who could almost single-handedly create the modern horror film
(Halloween), entertain with an action movie while, at the same time,
infusing that action with a decidedly un-'80s liberalism (Escape from New
York) and, of course, presciently incorporate Hong Kong filmic traditions in
an American movie years before anyone else thought to (Big Trouble in Little
China) has to know something the rest of us don't.  Put simply: I always
look forward to John Carpenter's movies.  I want them to be good.</P>
<P> Unfortunately, Carpenter's doing his best to tear down his rep and burn the
rubble.  His sequel to Escape, the pathetic Escape from LA, was as cheap and
exploitative as sequels get without having the name Charles Band attached to
it.  And now John Carpenter's Vampires, while not being that bad, isn't
great, either.</P>
<P> Based on the novel by John Steakley (no pun intended - I hope), Vampires is
another attempt by Carpenter to mold the sensibilities of the classic
western to the skeleton of another genre.  Jack Crow, played with typical
flair by James Woods, is the head of a Vatican-sponsored vampire-hunting
squad.  The squad's a tough bunch of hombres, travelling from town to town
doing what needs to be done.  They're a modern Wild Bunch, living more or
less outside the law, boozing and whoring and being real men.  To an extent,
this works.</P>
<P> Vampires opens with Team Crow busting open a vampire nest in some New
Mexican jerkwater.  Crow and his boys work with brutal efficiency, flushing
and killing.  It's a solid piece of work, juxtaposing the violence inside
the nest with the presence of a priest outside, blessing the charred remains
of the undead.  The entire sequence has a nasty bestiality that displays the
skill Carpenter has when he really has something solid to work with.</P>
<P> After this, however, the movie begins to decay.  Following the raid, the
master of this vampire pack (and, apparently, all vampires - played by an
almost unrecognizable Thomas Ian Griffith) takes out Team Crow.  Crow is put
on the run with the last member of his team, Montoya (Daniel Baldwin) and a
hooker (Sheryl Lee) "infected" by the master and linked to him
telepathically, a la Mina Harker in Bram Stoker's Dracula.</P>
<P> Bizarrely, since the movie runs 107 minutes, not much else happens in
Vampires.  Jack Crow makes contact with the Church and learns the origin of
Griffith's super-vampire, gets a fresh new priest in the person of Tim
Guinee and wanders around doing this and that.  Meanwhile, a sort-of romance
blooms between Montoya and Lee's Katrina, even as Katrina comes closer and
closer to full vampirism.  It's... it's boring.</P>
<P> Only at the very end, in the last ten or so minutes, does Carpenter's film
regain the momentum it started with, though even this is inexpertly handled.
Large parts of the massive "slayers versus the vampires" climax are done in
an abstract, montage fashion.  Very disappointing.</P>
<P> This is even more of a letdown when taken in the context of Carpenter's
carefully-staged camera work and the sharp performances from the cast.  Even
Daniel Baldwin, the oft-overlooked Baldwin brother, puts together some good
moments.  But where's the script?  Where's the good stuff?  Where's the John
Carpenter genius that turns an ordinary story into something special?
Vampires is simply parts looking for a whole.</P>
