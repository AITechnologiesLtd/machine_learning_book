<PRE>                            FORCES OF NATURE
                      A film review by Bradley Null

<P>Any time you go to see a romantic comedy with big budget stars and a
promo tagline like, "He went from the eye of the storm into the arms of
a hurricane," you have to be a little scared.  After all, for every WHEN
HARRY MET SALLY, there are a dozen WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING's, and the
worst part is that the bad ones always seem to make more money.</P>
<P>Surprisingly, my fears about sitting through FORCES OF NATURE were
unfounded and alleviated pretty quickly.  FORCES OF NATURE is basically
PLANES, TRAINS, AND AUTOMOBILES, except that John Candy has been
replaced with Sandra Bullock, Steve Martin is now Ben Affleck on his way
to get married, and instead of hating his travelling companion, Ben is
falling in love with her.  With a set-up like this, you have to be
especially worried, because Hollywood thrives on taking totally
unrealistic premises and turning them into trite, sentimental, and naive
romantic comedies with unrealistic happy endings.  The reason this
romantic comedy is pulled off, despite such an unrealistic premise
though, is that the plot is actually somewhat darker an more honest than
that of you typical popcorn movie.  Additionally, the more unrealistic
moments are played for laughs and not tears.</P>
<P>Credit the director, relative newcomer Hughes, the writer, and the
entire cast, particularly Steve Zahn as the best man, for keeping FORCES
from careening into unabashed sentimentalism.  It's the best Hollywood
text-book romantic comedy I've seen in a while, but with that said, it
is still a Hollywood text-book romantic comedy, so while you can expect
a few laughs, and a sentimental moment or two, don't expect a life
altering experience.</P>
<P>And one more thing, because I know that there are those of you out there
that are already eager to send me hate-mail for saying WHILE YOU WERE
SLEEPING sucked or maybe you want to claim that FORCES OF NATURE is
life-altering.  Save your time.  I personally don't mind the hate-mail,
I think it is funny, but if you think you are going to make me change my
mind or feel bad for insulting a masterpiece, you are not.  What I write
here are my opinions, and if you don't think they have any merit, don't
read my reviews.  I'm not doing this whole film review thing to feel
self-important, I'm doing it as a service, so if you don't think what I
write is worth reading, then PLEASE don't read it.</P>
