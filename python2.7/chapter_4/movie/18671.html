TIMECOP
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>For many people with the scientific background, concept of
time travel seems more suitable to fantasy than to science
fiction genre. It seems that Hollywood filmmakers share that
opinion, because almost always the films dealing with time
travel usually don't bother with such boring problems like
time travellers killing their own parents before their own
conception etc. Sometimes those films touch such problems,
but the time travel is more often than not just a background
for standard adventure or mindless action. TIMECOP, 1994
action film directed by Peter Hyams, falls within that
second category.</P>
<P>Based on the Dark Horse comic books, screenplay by Mike
Richardson and Mark Verheiden demands that the viewer
suspends a lot of disbelief. In 1994, time travel is
discovered and U.S. government sets up TEC - elite secret
unit of superagents, whose only job is to prevent the people
from abusing the technology and changing past for their own
purposes. After his loving wife Melissa (Mia Sara) dies,
Washington D.C. policeman Max Walker (Jean-Claude Van Damme)
would join that force. Ten years later, Max Walker discovers
that powerful and greedy Senator McComb (Ron Silver) already
sends his henchmen into the past to steal money in order to
bring funds for his presidential campaign. Walker goes back
to 1994 in order not only to prevent the conspiracy, but
also to save his own wife.</P>
<P>Apart from big plot holes involving time paradox, scientific
gaffs (carbon dating of gold) or huge implausibilities,
TIMECOP is a rather entertaining film. Peter Hyams, who
directed it, can make his way through SF material (starting
with his 1980 space opera OUTLAND), knows the limitation of
material and does standard action routines, indulging
himself with few experiments with photography. Jean-Claude
Van Damme as protagonist is quite tolerable, although his
acting talent is always comes second to his martial arts
abilities. The real winner in that contest is Ron Silver as
corrupt senator, in role very similar to the one he had
played in LIVE WIRE. This time it is real fun watching him,
especially in the scene when he meets younger version of
himself. However, although TIMECOP has required amount
action scenes, few rather impressive shots, couple of
well-choreographed fights and relatively good looks, it is
still mediocre piece of Hollywood cinema. Those who aren't
easily insulted with cliches and disregard for scientific
facts might still enjoy it, though.</P>
