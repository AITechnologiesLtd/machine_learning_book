<P>Redford Handles the Reigns as the "Horse Whisperer"</P>
<P>Hope, tragedy, and renewal are the tender elements that make up "The
Horse Whisperer", a thoughtful story that explores family, mature love,
and adult emotions.  Robert and Annie MacLean (Sam Neill and Kristin
Scott Thomas), though married, seem like a distant couple.  The father
lives on a sprawling ranch with daughter Grace.  Meanwhile, Annie lives
in the big city, is a frenzied editor of a major magazine, and has an
obsession with being in control.  A harrowing riding accident almost
kills young Grace (Scarlett Johansson) and her beloved horse Pilgrim.
Although they both survive, their emotional wounds are far worse than
the physical damage that they have suffered.  The horse becomes fearful
and jilted.  Meanwhile, Grace experiences profound indifference and
withdraws to the point where she believes that not only Pilgrim should
be put down to save him from the anguish that he is suffering but that
also she should be put down as well.  </P>
<P>Robert believes the doctors when they say that time heals all, but Annie
is not one to sit still.  She feels that every moment they waste, the
further Grace will regress.  Having researched many equestrian-related
journals, she reads about a man named Tom Booker (Robert Redford), a
Horse Whisperer who is a gifted sage that can help horses who have
suffered the same problems as Pilgrim.  Annie decides to seek him out
and makes the long journey to Montana with her now-contentious daughter
and Pilgrim in tow.  She hopes that if Mr. Booker can cure Pilgrim,
Annie will regain her spirit as well.  She also hopes that this
experience will bring the two of them closer together.</P>
<P>Redford agrees to help, but not unless Grace also gets involved.  Using
what seems like nothing more than patience and love, both Pilgrim and
Grace begin to respond.  Grace slowly comes out of her cocoon.  She
begins to accept her situation, allows herself to mourn her loss and
develops a closer tie to her estranged mom.  Meanwhile, another plot
begins to unfold as Tom and Annie slowly fall in love with one another.
His tenderness, good-looks, and the allure of the open skies and
picturesque landscape of the Montana frontier begins to break down
Annie's need for control and she finds herself feeling a renewed sense
of love.  Like Grace, Annie will have to ask herself to make some tough
choices about what she wants.</P>
<P>Considering the fact that Redford is in his 60s and Thomas is in her
40s, this is nothing short of a grown-up love story.  It is honest and
sincere in it's exploration of dysfunctional relationships and the
responsibilities and duties that come with family.  Spanning 160-minutes
in length, the film develops slowly as it pays respect to the kind of
relationships that can not develop in a short period of time.  Johannson
gives a worthy performance as the troubled youth trying to regain her
spirit and Thomas is cast well as the woman who tries to balance passion
with responsibility.  To sit through this without fidgeting, you'll need
the patience of a Horse Whisperer.  But Redford understands the charm of
the west, the importance of life, and the nuances of adult
relationships.</P>
