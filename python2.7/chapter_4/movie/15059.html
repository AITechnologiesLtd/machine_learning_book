<P>Ghidrah, the Three-Headed Monster (1966) m. </P>
<P>If you've never seen any of the monster movies made in Japan by the Toho 
studios during the 50s and 60s, then you might as well jump off the deep 
end with this offering by Ishirio Honda, their most popular director.  
You won't believe what you're seeing.  Ghidrah is a hydra-like creature 
that breathes lightning and decides to wreak havoc on Japan 
because...well, he's a monster.  In the meantime, and because six heads 
are better than three, old favorites Godzilla, Rodan, and Mothra (all 
from previous films in the series) also join in the fray, although this 
time around their scenery-chewing - all bug-eyed expressions and 
double-takes - easily exceeds their usual scenery-stamping.  </P>
<P>I won't recount the plot (believe me, it's better this way) except to 
point out that it is worth waiting through the disjointed first half, 
which jumps between different story elements and concentrates more on 
the human actors than the monsters, to get to the hysterical combat 
scenes in the second half (Godzilla keeps screeching throughout the 
chaos like an enraged dolphin!).  Like other films in the series, 
GHIDRAH's characters are predominantly scientists or journalists (and 
there's usually a ship's captain that gets done in fairly early).  The 
'scientific' dialogue is just as nonsensical here as in other Toho 
films, and is made even sillier by the cartoon-character voices that the 
actors have had dubbed over them.  By the time GHIDRAH was being made it 
was pretty obvious that the studios were targeting kids as a major part 
of their audience - at least that seems to be the case in the 
English-language versions.  It's pretty hard to mesh the juvenile 
elements of the production with the busy plot, which cuts between a 
princess who appears to be have been abducted by aliens, scientists 
exploring a volcano, a group of assassins, and a comeback tour for 
Mothra's tiny priestesses - but all of this is forgotten as soon as the 
monsters meet in the no-holds-barred finale.</P>
<P>The most noteworthy aspect of GHIDRAH, however, is that it marked the 
point where Godzilla stopped being a monster and became a hero.  
Godzilla, who once represented the destructive force of the atomic bomb, 
sheds his image of fear and vengeance and instead becomes a figure to 
whom the Japanese turn for protection.  This has obvious parallels with 
the way that Japan's economy went into turnaround after  WWII and set 
the country on the way to becoming an influential world power.  Ten 
years after Godzilla's first appearance it no longer became necessary 
for him to replay the devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  By the 
time GHIDRAH came along the Toho studios wore their monster with pride: 
Japan was back in world politics with a vengeance.  GHIDRAH is also a 
lot of fun.  This may be the best fight between four Japanese monsters 
I've ever seen.  It must surely win the prize for the most alternative 
titles - it was up to eleven the last time I looked.</P>
