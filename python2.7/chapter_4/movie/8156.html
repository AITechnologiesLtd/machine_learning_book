                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1997 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>Men in Black (1997) ***1/2 out of ***** - Cast: Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith,
Linda Fiorentino, Rip Torn, Vincent D'onofrio. Directed by: Barry
Sonnenfeld. Running Time: 98 minutes.</P>
<P>Finally a decent summer movie has arrived. Not a great one, but decent. But
as far as the summer of 1997 is concerned, decent is equal to greatness.</P>
<P>"Men in Black" is probably this summer's most hyped film. In it, secret
government agents are responsible for monitoring all alien activity here on
earth. Yes, it seems aliens have been amongst us for years now. Smith is a
New York cop who unknowingly chases down an alien, and Jones recruits him to
join the secret organization.</P>
<P>The film does two things right, it's basic premise and the script. The
concept is refreshingly original and the dialogue is very funny. What it
fails at is character development and the actual story itself. Any details
of this secret organization are hardly mentioned, and we are led to believe
that there are only two actual agents in this group. Not much, but just a
tiny bit of development for the two main leads would have been nice.</P>
<P>As far as the meat of the story goes, an evil alien comes to earth to get a
little jewel or something he needs for some reason. That is how clear that
part gets. This evil alien, who earlier in the film is really built up to be
a forceful presence, crashes his ship into earth (if aliens are so advanced,
why are they always crashing into earth?) and attempts to use the body of a
farmer (D'onofrio) to blend in. I use the word "attempts" because for the
whole movie D'onofrio staggers around grotesquely disfigured because the
skin doesn't quite fit the alien's body, or the alien doesn't really have a
handle on how to use it. It's partly amusing to watch, but overall it seems
to defeat the purpose of even having a villain. Do we care if the slothing
mutant gets whatever it is he needs or if Jones and Smith stop him? There's
never any sense of danger whatsoever. You can make a zany movie like this
and still have a threat to deal with in the end, just take a look at
"Ghostbusters". And the film's final scenes are just plain wrong, as it goes
in all sorts of different directions, none of which did it need to go in.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, some of the special effects aren't created well, and do not
interact well with the scenes they are used in. The filmmakers should have
studied the computer effect techniques from "Mars Attacks!", as those are
still some of the most flawless interactive computer effects I've seen.</P>
<P>"Men in Black" does entertain however, despite it's flaws. Jones and Smith
have some great lines, and there's a scene where Jones forceably
interrogates a small dog that's one of the funniest things I've seen in a
long time. It's a fun flick, as summer movies should be. [PG-13]</P>
