<PRE>A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Gone in 60 Seconds is the ultimate guilty pleasure of the summer. It starts 
off as a promising action film, full of genuine suspense and excitement. As 
the movie progresses, it gets increasingly stupid to the point where it's so 
bad and inane that it's good. Throughout the film, the same phony human 
emotion becomes adopted by all the actors, but it's the emotions and 
relationships that keep the film interesting. No character goes beyond wading 
pool level in depth, and that's a very good thing. Director Dominic Sena 
realizes this is an action movie, and he doesn't disappoint. Instead of 
trying to reinvent the genre or use slow motion until it just becomes silly 
(Mission: Impossible 2 anyone?) he takes the best stuff from things we've 
seen before, and makes it into a fun, exciting, and pleasing film.</P>
<P>Memphis Raines (Nicolas Cage) is a retired car thief whose younger brother 
Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) attempts to follow in his footsteps. Kip screws up his 
first car heist leading the police right to him and his boss. His boss, an 
evil guy with an English accent, wants Memphis to steal fifty specific cars 
from the Long Beach area in three days. If all the cars don't get delivered 
in time, he will kill Kip. So Memphis and a bunch of his old (now mostly 
clean) car thief buddies work together planning the operation. Some of his 
friends include former girlfriend Sway (Angelina Jolie), and an auto mechanic 
named Otto (Robert Duvall). Kip and his younger friends also join the crew. 
Detective Roland Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) is about the same age as Memphis, 
and is eager to put him behind bars. Not putting him in jail already is 
something he regrets. Castlebeck and his younger partner Detective Drycoff 
(Timothy Olyphant) pursue Memphis and the gang for most of the film.</P>
<P>One constant element of humor in this movie is the clash between the older 
and younger generations. Memphis and Otto are more cautious about their 
actions and easily spot undercover cops. Unlike some of Kip's pals (including 
Tumbler played by Scott Caan) they are always aware of their surroundings. 
The older guys certainly donâ€™t discuss the latest masturbation techniques, or 
steal cars full of heroin. Memphis comes up with inventive ways to evade 
police and gangs, while the youths prefer confrontation. However, one 
hilarious scene does involves one of the older men attacking a bad car 
hijacker claiming he needs to get a role model. If this doesn't sound like 
your type of humor, this movie isn't for you. This movie will please action 
fans, but I think lots of other less action-oriented people may get 
surprised. I certainly was, and apparently the crowd was too. They were 
hooting and hollering and clapped loudly several times. I admire that 
Angelina Jolie doesn't get used as just a sex object in the film. Sway just 
likes hanging with the guys, and not once does she sleep with anyone. While 
the sexual aspect of her character is definitely there, she doesn't appear in 
much of the movie anyway. Nicolas Cage's nasal tone has never been more 
appealing, and I like the range shown by Giovanni Ribisi in this movie.</P>
<P>The action scenes are at the heart of this movie. The mood gets well set; 
everything is dark and grainy. The only constant source of light for the 
characters comes from fiery explosions, car headlights, or police lights. 
There is one skill everyone in the movie possesses; these people can drive. 
During one amazing car chase, Memphis does a spectacular job of navigating 
himself through the streets. The fast pace never stops, and I thought this 
scene to be the highlight of the film. The cast assembled includes some great 
actors who throw almost all their skills away for good old-fashioned movie 
fun. There really don't need to be as many characters as there were. Frances 
Fisher shows up for some reason in the beginning and end, and there were some 
scenes (like giving a dog laxatives so he would "release" the keys he 
swallowed) that don't need to be there.  Regardless, this is still an 
entertaining time. Some Mission: Impossible and James Bond music pops up, and 
similar Bond-esque stunts occur. Gone in 60 Seconds could also promote 
awareness about how easy it is for car thieves to steal your car. It may 
encourage people to be safer about where they park, and security measures 
they use. Coming out of the screening, I got handed a helpful guide with ten 
ways to protect your car from car thieves. </P>
<P>There are more than eighty people listed under the stunts section of the 
credits. If this doesn't give you an idea about what type of movie this is, I 
don't know what will.</P>
