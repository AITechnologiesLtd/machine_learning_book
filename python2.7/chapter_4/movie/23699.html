<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>I am almost surprised to find myself reviewing "Magnolia", two months 
after viewing the film. But although I have seen several movies in the 
intervening weeks, the images of "Magnolia" have remained strong in my 
mind, and so here I sit at my keyboard. This is not to say that 
"Magnolia" is a perfect film; in some respects, it is deeply flawed. But 
it is one of those movies which demands to be viewed, contemplated, 
remembered, even if the verdict is not entirely positive.</P>
<P>"Magnolia" is the brainchild of Paul Thomas Anderson, and is a sequel of 
sorts to his "Boogie Nights", featuring many of the same cast and crew. 
Some critics have reviewed "Magnolia" on this basis, but I have not seen 
"Boogie Nights" (yet) and would prefer to discuss "Magnolia" on its own 
merits anyhow.</P>
<P>"Magnolia" tells the stories of several people on one day in California. 
Jim Kurring (John C Reilly) is a police officer who is well-meaning but 
sometimes too earnest. On a routine call, he meets drug-addled Claudia 
(Melora Walters). Claudia's father is popular game show host Jimmy Gator 
(Philip Baker Hall), who has recently learned he is dying and must now 
break the truth of his sordid private life to wife Rose (Melinda Dillon). 
The current star of Gator's quiz show is young Stanley Spector (Jeremy 
Blackman), both encouraged and terrorized by his father Rick (Michael 
Bowen). Stanley has raised the spectre of the legendary "Quiz Kid" Donnie 
Smith (William H Macy). Smith became famous on Gator's show, but has 
fallen on hard times as an adult and is now contemplating crime.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom Cruise) is a "motivational" speaker who 
teaches men how to seduce women. Mackey's estranged father is rich TV 
producer Earl Partridge (Jason Robards), now on his deathbed in almost 
constant pain. Partridge is cared for by nurse Phil Parma (Philip Seymour 
Hoffman), who desperately wants to reunite father and son before Earl's 
imminent demise. Partridge's much younger wife is Linda (Julianne Moore), 
who married him for his money but has grown to love him, and does not 
know how to deal with his death.</P>
<P>There are a number of themes competing for attention in "Magnolia". The 
most obvious is that Strange Things Happen, introduced in three amusing 
opening vignettes. The movie, obviously, is awash with coincidence and 
happenstance, as characters from otherwise unrelated plot threads cross 
each other's paths. This theme is almost comically illustrated at two 
points in the film's second half: once when all the characters begin 
singing along to the excellent Aimee Mann soundtrack, and once shortly 
thereafter when a totally unanticipated event occurs. It would be 
criminal of me to reveal the controversial details of the latter, but 
suffice it to say that it is presaged by a few carefully-planted clues 
in the film itself (not to mention the prologue), and does not feel at all
out of place within "Magnolia"'s narrative framework. If the first event 
is the calm before the storm, the second is the storm itself; together 
they pave the way for the events that form the movie's conclusion.</P>
<P>While this in of itself would be the basis for an intriguing movie, and 
is certainly the fulcrum upon which "Magnolia" turns, there is a lot more 
going on. The struggle between fathers and children crops up often: 
between Hall and Walters, Robards and Cruise, Bowen and Blackman. Events 
have conspired to force each pair to confront their relationship, in one 
way or another, whether they want to or not.</P>
<P>Both Robards and Hall are dying. Both Moore and Walters wrestle with 
substance abuse. Both the Robards/Moore and Hall/Dillon marriages are 
built on a foundation of lies. Both Parma and Reilly are caregivers 
flailing in the face of their own impotence. Both Walters and Macy are 
looking for someone to take care of them. Macy has already suffered from 
the false glamour of childhood fame; now it looks as though Blackman may 
endure the same fate.</P>
<P>Even at over three hours, "Magnolia" is bursting with material, throwing 
so much at the viewer it is hard to get bored. But this is both its 
blessing and its curse: Anderson puts so much into the movie that some 
things get lost in the shuffle. It is difficult to tell if the movie 
really comes together, or just amounts to a lot of sound and fury. Early 
on, for example, Reilly investigates a murder which never gets resolved. 
Sure, it's not integral to the movie (Reilly's scenes with Dillon and 
Macy are much more important), but so much is made of it early on that 
ignoring it makes "Magnolia" feel incomplete. And a few of the subplots 
just don't feel as well-developed as others. Blackman and Bowen's 
relationship, in particular, gets short shrift compared to some of the 
other stories. It is ironic that, for such a long movie, one of the 
dominant feelings I was left with afterward was of wanting more. But 
maybe that isn't necessarily such a bad thing, either.</P>
<P>The large cast mainly rises to the quality of Anderson's script. Cruise's 
Oscar-nominated performance has gotten the most attention, and not 
undeservedly. Here he turns his public persona on its head in a role 
which matches "Eyes Wide Shut" for how deeply it plumbs. Also excellent 
is Hoffman, quiet yet passionate as Phil Parma. Really, only Moore 
disappoints, with a performance that can best be described as shrill. 
Although by no means bad, she does exhibit the skill shown in "The End of 
the Affair" and "An Ideal Husband".</P>
<P>"Magnolia" is a rarity in today's Hollywood: a film honestly deserving of 
the term 'epic'. Brilliantly acted, richly scripted, tantalizingly 
directed, it more than overcomes its flaws and proves to be a truly 
singular filmgoing experience. It is little wonder it has stayed so fresh 
in my mind so long; would that I could say the same about more movies.</P>
