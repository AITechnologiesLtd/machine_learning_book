<PRE>`Joan' Lacks Dramatic Arc</PRE>
<P>Sinner or Saint?  Heretic or Savior?  The history
surrounding Joan of Arc has been subject to plenty of
interpretation by scholars over the last 5 centuries. 
And, it was only 500 years after her death that the
Vatican finally canonized her.  Why might have it
taken so long?  I would suspect that their was much
discussion on both sides as to whether Joan indeed was
a messenger from God or just a poor peasant girl with
delusional visions, incredible amounts of courage, and
tremendous luck.  This movie doesn't advocate either
side, and that was one of the problems with `The
Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc,' a somewhat flat
depiction of one of history's most enigmatic icons.</P>
<P>Joan, pronounced `Junne' (played by Milla Jovovich),
has received hints throughout her young life that
portends to a future that no 19 year-old girl could
ever be prepared to handle.  These hints include
various visions and even a sword that she finds while
frolicking through the countryside.  Junne believes
that God is trying to give her a message.  She must
free France from her enemies (based on a historical
occurrence when England was supposed to annex France
through a treaty).  She visits Charles, dauphin of
France (John Malkovich), to tell him of her divine
role, and is given an army with which to cleanse the
French countryside of English troops.  Charles and his
advisors may be skeptical of her baseless claims,
which really has to be taken on faith, but any kind of
victory would garner him support among the masses as
he prepares to accept his crown.  Meanwhile, Junne,
who is only a messenger, has a strange effect on the
French army.  Their strength seems greater while their
morale increases, believing that God is on their side.
 Against all odds, they score unlikely but critical
victories in the war.  Junne is regarded a hero. 
Charles' popularity soars.  All of this takes place in
the first half of the movie, and for the most part, I
am more or less satisfied with how the movie has
unfolded. </P>
<P>Director Luc Besson is true to form in bringing to
life a 15th century world when miracles in France were
sorely needed.  You may recall Besson's eye-popping
`Fifth Element', and here, his visualizations are
equally impressive.  Take note of the sheer pageantry
of Charles' coronation.  I was also impressed with the
medieval warfare, meticulously presented from the
inner workings of a catapult to the various defenses
(such as cauldrons of boiling oil) that the attacking
French must navigate.  The siege of an enemy tower is
the highlight of the film.  Melee is depicted
graphically with arrows piercing bodies and flails
crushing heads to a bloody pulp.</P>
<P>But the 150-minute movie wanes in the second act as
attention turns towards Junne's inner demons.  Now
King, Charles withdraws his support for Junne.  She is
eventually captured and tried for heresy.  While
awaiting trial, she is visited by another vision (who
looks like Dustin Hoffman).  He asks her to explain
her actions, which seem so contradictory to all of His
commandments.  Junne is naturally confused about her
current state, and the vision tries to help Junne
discover her own answers.</P>
<P>Besson is ambitious in his portrayal of Joan of Arc. 
Jovavich would have been more likeable if she wasn't
screaming at the top of her lungs throughout the film.
 Of course, it's hard to hear a 19-year old girl when
there are thousands fighting around you.  The film's
strength is in its visuals.  But dramatically, the
movie couldn't generate the power and seemed fearful
in committing one way or another to her cause. 
Perhaps God motivated her.  Perhaps vengeance did. 
Sinner or Saint?  Heretic or Savior?  Perhaps only God
will ever know.</P>
