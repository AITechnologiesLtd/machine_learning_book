<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
2 and a half stars</P>
<P>Meet Joe Black often borderlines on becoming a technical mess.  The
script fumbles, the direction is passive and the editing seems almost
non-existent.  But somehow, I find it hard to hate this film.  Meet Joe
Black has a sort of goof sincerity, a feeling that the production crew's
hearts and minds were in the right place, but they have ultimately
failed to package their product successfully.  There are many rewarding
features on show here, but every one of them is exaggerated and
sensationalized until they become faintly tiresome.  With a running time
of almost three hours, director Martin Brest (Scent of a Woman) never
knows exactly when to call it quits.  During his extravagantly long
creation, however, Brest hits upon some worthwhile lessons of life and
love.  It's just a pity that it takes patient ears to listen to them.</P>
<P>Media tycoon William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) has not got long to live.
In fact, Death himself has struck a bargain with Parrish: if he shows
him the wonders of life, he will prolong his death until he is no longer
interested in human behavior.  Parrish grudgingly accepts, and
introduces death (with the newly acquired body of Brad Pitt) as "Joe
Black."  Black experiments with simplistic human treats like peanut
butter, and ponders over the meaning of the phrase "as certain as death
and taxes."  Before long, though, his experimentation becomes more than
just skin deep.  Parish's daughter Susan (the lovely Claire Forlani)
takes a shining to Black, and before long an uncertain relationship
builds between them.</P>
<P>In my review of 1998's The Mask of Zorro, I said that Anthony Hopkins
was "one of the true masters of American cinema," and Meet Joe Black
strengthens my belief.  On paper, his characters might seem cliché and
his scenes might seem witless, but Hopkins gives them credibility.   In
this case, the character of Bill Parrish could easily have appeared as
cold and inaccessible.  Fortunately, Hopkins gives him warmth and a
heart, whilst also providing a cutting-edge authoritarian presence.
Parrish is not unlike Disney's Scrooge McDuck; they are both smart and
shrewd, but have a lovable core that makes everything they do
intriguing.  Brad Pitt's presence is often wooden, but he is playing an
out-of-environment character so I guess it's intentional.  It is almost
as if Pitt only chooses roles that have a reason to be bad - he was a
vampire in Interview with the Vampire, a dopey stoner in True Romance, a
nut case in Twelve Monkeys, and in Seven Years in Tibet he was…an
Austrian.</P>
<P>Meet Joe Black is modeled in the old-fashioned style of grand cinema.
The screenplay was loosely based on 1934's Death Takes a Holiday, and
the qualities of yesteryear are on show here.  The film takes a lot of
time - in fact, way too much time - to build a climax which, naturally,
ends in an explosion of fireworks.  Whilst it is often hard to accept a
film with such a slow pace, it is also hard to resist it.  The central
romance between Pitt and Forlani is a nice bit of romantic fluff: it's
instantly forgettable but enjoyable at the time.</P>
<P>What is unforgivable about Meet Joe Black is that all it achieves could
have been made in half the time.  The three hours of footage were not
made because the plot is especially complex, but rather because almost
every shot is over-filmed. The dialogue is drawn out and loses much of
its interest, and there are more than a few scenes that could have been
axed all together.  Still, amongst all this cinematic mayhem, Meet Joe
Black is a film with a heart.  It takes risks, and although many of them
do not pay off, they are generally pleasing experiences.  I could
imagine that Meet Joe Black would make a good subject for a film school:
how to take a potentially excellent film and exaggerate it to the point
where it pushes the boundaries of acceptance.</P>
