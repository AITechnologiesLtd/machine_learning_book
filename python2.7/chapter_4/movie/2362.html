<P>     Corn doesn't come any fresher than Disney's IRON WILL, an
old-fashioned crowd-pleaser about a boy and his dogs and a 522-mile
winter race.  Perfect for kids and not-bad for adults, IRON WILL is a
pleasing, hokey alternative to the dreck that passes as current "family
fare."</P>
<P>     Inspired by a true story, Mackenzie Astin plays "Iron" Will
Stoneman, a spirited South Dakota lad who signs up for a marathon
dog-sled race in 1917.  The first to reach St. Paul, Minnesota from
Winnipeg, Canada, wins $10,000--a sum that will go far to help the
strapped Stonemans.  They're in straits since Dad died during--what
else?--a dog-sled drive.</P>
<P>     So, filled with both grim determination and his mother's fruitcake
(don't ask), Will rides for his father, his family, and his (college)
future....</P>
<P>     IRON WILL is, simply, the kind of movie they don't make anymore.</P>
<P>     The story is simple and straight-forward: it's about a race.  And
when the race ends, the film ends--a rather jarring effect in this era
of padded running-times.  Other than the drama, nothing else in IRON
WILL is inflated.  It's all scene after scene of Will racing onward to
face increasingly difficult odds.</P>
<P>     (Oddly, one the film's weakest moments occurs when the filmmaker's
take something OUT.  The sole incongruity is a 90's-style training
montage that makes no narrative sense other than to condense a few
extra minutes of screen time.)</P>
<P>     Corny as it comes, there's alot to like about IRON WILL.  The cast
goes down easy AND manages to keep a straight-face when delivering
drippy dialogue like "Don't let your fears stand in the way of your
dreams, son." The action is great, the dogs look good, and, in the wake
of recent wicked weather, the locales looks especially uninviting.</P>
<P>     And the audacity that the director exhibits in manipulating his
audience is almost worth the price of admission.  From the early death
of Will's dad to a championship cloying finale, Haid pulls every string
he can lay his hands on.  It's hilarious.</P>
<P>     IRON WILL is also good will.  For audiences who are weary from
endless product tie-ins and strong social commentary, the film's
near-lack of cynicism is a welcome relief.</P>
<PRE>Bottom line: The inflated drama of IRON WILL would sink any other
             film like an ironclad.  But, coupled to the "real life"
             story of 1917 dog-sled race, it works to fine, hokey
             effect.  Perfect for kids.  Not bad for adults.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: B</PRE>
