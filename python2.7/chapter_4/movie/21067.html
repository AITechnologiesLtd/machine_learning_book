<P>   "Fight Club" comes to us at just the right political time. 
The media are abuzz and the classrooms are a-whirring with
ideas about the current controversial du jour: Do violent
movies cause actual violence, or do movies simply reflect the
true cause of violence--our very society?  David Fincher,
whose imaginative output has included "The Game," comes
out on the latter side.  His new epic drama, "Fight Club,"
holds that the soul-deadening jobs that we hold with corrupt
corporations coupled with the daily pummeling we receive
from corporate advertising are enough to drive quite a few
people not just angry, but downright mad.  Because of the
emptiness of the daily, hollow grind, we seek solace by
buying things that promise redemption--which we do not
receive.  We're bombarded by ads depicting models with
perfect bodies and by commercials pitching ways we can fill
up our wanting spirits--buy furniture, buy gym memberships,
drape yourself in Calvin Klein.  (Apparently, escaping to
movie theaters does not qualify as fatuous.) </P>
<P>   Watching this film--to its credit a you'll-love-it-or-hate-it sort
of experience--I couldn't help thinking of a play on a similar
theme, "Equus."  In Peter Shaffer's conception, Martin Dysart,
a middle-aged English psychiatrist, treats a disturbed
adolescent, Alan Strang.  Among Alan's hobbies is riding a
horse at midnight, as bareback as the animal.  Psychotic
though the lad may be, he impresses the doctor with his
vitality, his lack of inhibition, which he pits against his own
dull, conventional holidays consisting of a couple of weeks of
lazing at a middle-class resort.</P>
<P>   If the listless people created in Chuck Palahniuk's novel did
nothing more singular than ride horses at the witching hour,
Fincher's film, which gives visual heft to Jim Uhls's
adaptation, would lack the intense, visceral power that holds
the audience in its thrall for all of its 139 minutes.  But
whereas "Equus," an effective play written for the limited
leeway allowed by the legitimate stage, is thought-provoking,
"Fight Club" makes full use of the benefits of the big screen. 
Its dialogue is razor-keen, allowing Uhls's script to deride the
usual punching-bags of contemporary satire: consumerism
and corruption.  More important, the movie takes command of
the screen and sound system, embellishing the din of
punches viciously thrown along with rough sex clumsily and
happily indulged in by two of its lead personalities.</P>
<P>   The film opens on a stark scene.  Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt)
has plunged a gun inside the mouth of Jack (Edward Norton
whose narration frequently punctuates the story), announcing
an imminent disaster to occur in a nameless, largely stylized
city.  Fincher flashes back to Jack at work as a consultant
with a major automobile manufacturer.  His job, which takes
him frequently into the field, involves investigating accidents
that have befallen owners of his company's auto.  In an
effective piece of anti-corporation satire, Jack describes
company policy to a passenger sitting adjacent to him on a
flight.  The corporation has a formula. If the expected awards
that the courts bestow on the hapless occupants suing the
company will exceed the company's cost of recalling the
flawed vehicles, the corporation will announce an expensive
recall.  If not, the car remains on the road.</P>
<P>   Jack, disgusted with his job and his insipid boss (Zach
Grenier), is plagued with insomnia.  A doctor dismisses his
patient's agony, encouraging Jack instead to go to a support
group for victims of testicular cancer survivors so that he will
see what real pain is like.  Jack becomes addicted to groups
of this kind and, in the movie's most humorous scenes, he--
and a fellow faker, Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter)--
visit a different group each night for entertainment.  On one
business flight, Jack meets colorful soap salesman Tyler
Durden, who urges Jack to chuck his cramped, insomnia-
ridden, bourgeois life-style, become a squatter in a rundown
house in a dingy, toxic section of town, and end his
enslavement to things.  After Jack and Tyler engage in a
physical brawl with each other, Jack finds that he has been
reborn.  He feels peculiarly free.  The two devise a grandiose
plan to set up a fight club, whose members would meet one
or more nights each week to beat one another to a pulp.  In
one scene that could cause some patrons to bolt from the
theater nauseated, Jack smashes up a pretty-boy who has
joined the group so fervently that the young man, Angel Face
(Jared Leto), will presumably have to change his nickname.</P>
<P>   David Fincher has most effectively realized the movie's
tagline, "Mischief, Mayhem, Soap."  As chapters of this fight
club expand throughout the country, Fincher allows the
audience to imagine the movie as a metaphor for the rise of
Fascism.  Fascism thrives on society's discontents.  Hitler's
and Mussolini's grand designs were put into motion when
groups of thugs disgruntled by economic woes and their
status on society's outskirts donned brown shirts and black
shirts and began terrorizing those they believed to be the
cause of their problems.  Fincher seems to say that Fascist
nihilism could arise even in the prosperous United States as
groups of people on society's fringes, together with those
who are dissatisfied with their workaday and social lives,
band together to destroy the forces they perceive as their
enemies.  How else to explain the recent tragedy at
Columbine High School, where privileged, intelligent kids,
shunned by their classmates and relegated to the condition of
outsiders, gunned down those they felt to be their
antagonists?</P>
<P>   Filmed and acted with assurance, "Fight Club" should for
the first time allow the public to see Brad Pitt as far more
than a pretty boy.  In his first truly visceral role, Pitt is the heir
to Malcolm McDowell's misfit in Stanley Kubrick's masterful
"A Clockwork Orange," while Edward Norton, marvelous in a
variety of roles from a white supremacist in Tony Kaye's
"American History X" to a charming romantic in Woody
Allen's "Everyone Says I Love You," inhabits the dark role of
a malcontent with astonishing depth.  Helena Bonham Carter
gives a rousing, over-the-top performance as the cynical
neurotic who is disgusted by Jack's brutality and enraptured
by Tyler's sexual prowess.  Fincher's timing is as surreal as
the film, flashing some scenes across the screen so quickly
(such as Jack's appearance at a sickle-cell support group)
that the audience knows it had better not blink.</P>
<P>   The kinetic style of "Fight Club" will appeal to the younger
members of the audience, the social satire to the more
sophisticated.  Predictably, many social and religious
conservatives will be appalled, the former convinced that its
violence will induce savagery outside the theater, the latter
offended by its nihilism.  Even those bearing no particular
ideology will be divided neatly down the middle, some
confused by what they could (wrongly) consider the
emptiness of the story, others gratified by its brawn, courage,
and energy.  A vigorous movie will do just that: offend some
mightily while gratifying others.  Show me a "likable" movie
and I'll show you a relaxing, banal, made-for-TV drama. 
"Fight Club" combines a physical rush with an intelligent
script and features wonderful performances of sharply-defined
characters.  These qualities should command the attention of
the Academy come nomination time.</P>
