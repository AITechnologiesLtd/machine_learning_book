<P>This film is Jeb Stuart's big-screen directorial debut. Before this, he
wrote 48 HOURS (7.5/10), DIE HARD (8/10), LOCK UP (7.5/10), and THE
FUGITIVE (7.5/10), among several other solid scripts.</P>
<P>PLOT:
This movie is cut into two stories, which alternatively switch back and
forth from one another (hence-Switchback). The first has an extremely
serious FBI agent (Quaid) tracking down a serial killer, while the
second deals with a hitchhiker (Leto) and his transportation savior
(Glover) trekking across the snowy mountains on their way to Utah. The
identity of the killer is what engulfs the rest of the movie.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Overly long, barely interesting retread of a dozen other serial killer
movies, this picture offers us as much excitement as Dennis Quaid's
stiff demeanor (Dennis might think that his cold look made him look
serious, but really it just made him boring.) This film was interesting
at first, as you try to figure out who the killer and/or his
motivations might be, but eventually (after the first hour or so), you
start to realize that this explanation will not come until the very
end, and by then, you just don't care anymore. I think I see what the
writer was trying to do here, in that he wanted to keep the audience
guessing throughout the entire movie, but unfortunately, there aren't
enough effective scenes, action sequences, or possible suspects to
really keep it interesting for that duration. In the end, you're just
begging for the damn thing to finish!</P>
<P>And even after its conclusion, I still found myself wondering about the
actual motivations of the serial killer, which were never really
explained, and/or why so much of the story focused on the local sheriff
and not on a more interesting character like Quaid's wife or something.
On top of all that, the typical Hollywood sugar-pie ending further
impressed this script's unoriginal nature into my negative point of
view. </P>
<P>In regards to the acting, I would have to give Danny Glover some points
for taking on this kooky role, but take plenty others away from Quaid
who just hasn't been able to punch in a decent acting gig since he gave
that piss-awful over-performance as Jerry Lee Lewis in GREAT BALLS OF
FIRE! back in 1989. Maybe he should give up the day job, and allow his
wife Meg "the cutest human being on the face of this Earth" Ryan to
support their family. The man's facial expression didn't change once
during this entire picture. </P>
<P>The atmosphere of the film was actually well manufactured, and the
sights were pretty to behold, but that would be it in regards to praise
for this film. Other than that, I suppose one could get a little into
the movie, if one were really a mystery buff, but even then, the movie
just drags, and drags, and drags. No extreme graphic violence either.
Now if you're looking for an excellent serial killer mystery with some
great action, suspense and atmosphere, pick up David Fincher's
wonderfully rainy SEVEN (8.5/10) starring the ever-loveable Brad Pitt
and Morgan Freeman.</P>
