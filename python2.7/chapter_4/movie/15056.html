<P>Why are vampires so popular?  Why are so many people obsessed with the
idea of human-like creatures that suck blood in order to survive?  Why
does anyone care about garlic and holy water and crosses and sunlight? 
Why are there people who dress in black and put on white makeup to go
see a movie about vampires?  There are people in this world who believe
that vampires do, in fact, exist.  This is a sickness.  It's an
obsession.  And I, unfortunately, just don't get it.  Perhaps I
shouldn't get it -- maybe I'm not supposed to.  Vampires don't interest
me.  They don't interest me because they don't exist.  I can watch a
movie about vampires and be entertained, but my attraction to the
subject goes no further.  </P>
<P>The title of John Carpenter's Vampires is no joke:  this film has
vampires.  It's all about vampires.  There are vampires in every shot. 
Vampires get slaughtered on a regular basis.  It's rare that Carpenter
lets two minutes pass without showing us macho dudes decapitating
vampires, or macho dudes driving stakes through vampires' hearts, or
macho dudes dragging vampires out into the sun so the vampires can
explode.  But if you look past the vampire motif, what you have is a
predictable and disappointing gore-fest:  Carpenter has done better than
this.  Vampires starts out interesting, incorporating the violence with
offbeat humor.  By the end, though, the violence overtakes the humor,
and we're left with a corny vampire flick drowning in an ocean of
wretched excess.</P>
<P>And at the center of the excess is James Woods, playing super-duper
vampire hunter Jack Crow with the kind of energy we've come to expect
from a James Woods performance.  Like most vampire hunters, Jack has a
deep-seated hatred for vampires, because they had something to do with
the death of his family.  He's one macho dude, too, because he's willing
to kill anyone or anything in order to get what he wants.  After an
introduction in which we see Jack and his group of hunters kill a bunch
of vampires, Jack's group is quickly eradicated by the vampire master,
Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith).  So, with only his trusty sidekick, Tony
Montoya (Daniel Baldwin) and a soon-to-be-vampire prostitute (Sheryl
Lee), Jack heads out to kill Valek.</P>
<P>I think Carpenter knows how silly the entire vampire thing is.  I sure
hope he does, anyway.  I realize I'm probably offending one in ten
people who might read this review, but I just can't help it.  I find
this obsession with vampires deeply confounding.  Carpenter, who has
made some good movies (The Thing and Escape From [wherever] come to
mind), begins Vampires with the right tone:  it's funny and
appropriately tongue-in-cheek.  The violence is so extreme that we can't
possibly believe it (Valek actually splits a guy in half with his
fingernails).  And some of the one-liners are pretty good.</P>
<P>But the story isn't very interesting, and Carpenter can't maintain the
humorous tone to the end.  A major problem lies in the Jack character,
who just isn't very nice or sympathetic.  Later in the film, when a
young priest (Tim Guinee) tags along, Jack becomes a rather hateful guy
(the bathroom interrogation scene is brutally unpleasant).  And the
violence takes hold of the film by the climactic scene, proving that a
vampire movie can not keep from coming across as pornography for the
violence-obsessed.  (There's a scene that features gratuitous slaying of
dozens of monks, and to call this "exploitative" would be excessively
kind.)</P>
<P>And, based on this film alone, I would hypothesize that Carpenter is
somewhat of a misogynist.  The only non-vampire women in the picture are
prostitutes (referred to by the male characters only as "whores");
Sheryl Lee's character is slapped around by the Baldwin character, and
then we're supposed to believe that they love each other.  Most of the
vampires who blow up due to sunlight exposure are women, screaming
wildly and relentlessly.  Vampires isn't social commentary, and I doubt
that Carpenter consciously decided to uphold a "hatred of women"
stance.  It's just one more element that adds to the generally
unpleasant tone of the film.</P>
<P>It's a good thing Woods is the star; he's really the only actor who can
rise above the mediocre dialogue and characterizations.  Baldwin is a
watchable presence, but doesn't do much acting.  Lee is on hand simply
for aesthetics.  Griffith is actually good as a vampire, but, with two
lines a dialogue, he doesn't prove himself as a thespian.  All things
considered, Vampires is just another vampire movie:   thoughtless and
excessive pornography.  If vampires were real, I might be a little more
kind to the film:  it does, after all, offer a few new insights into the
breeding habits of the blood-sucking creatures.  But, seeing as how
vampires don't exist, I'm left wishing that Carpenter had made a movie
that doesn't just appeal to the people who will dress up to see it.</P>
