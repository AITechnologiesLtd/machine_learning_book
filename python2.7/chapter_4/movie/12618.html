Film Comment</PRE>
<P>Hanna-Bi marked a rude but pleasant awakening for me, introducing me
to the work of Takeshi Kitano.  (I missed KIds Return inspite of a
luxurious one day repertory stint at the Bytowne...) It Hanna-Bi is
linked but not entirely representative of the director's previous
work. It is often in such cases when a filmmaker is marking new
territory that extremely accomplished work is done. The Sweet
Hereafter was an exception for specific reasons, but Lost Highway,
Dead Man or Crash all make the point. All credit here is to Kitano who
wrote, directed, edited as well as stars in the film. This is perhaps
the closest The filmmaker can come to serving as true artist, true
analog to the mode of a novelist or painter, as opposed to some hybrid
of artist-manager. For the most part today, even in cases of
responsible filmmaking, it is not at all clear that a single person's
creative thrust anchors a film. Kundun and Happy Together for
instance, both remarkable, cannot be credited soley to their
respective director's efforts. This is neither good nor bad, although
in a case like Hanna-Bi there is much less ambiguity as to the source
of what is being ennunciated by the film. The result is a level of
coherence that is absent from most films; while Scorcese or Wong are
able to marshall the efforts of collaborators into a unified voice
most films produced via the conventional collaborative model end up
feeling like six people shouting at you and each other.</P>
<P>    Hanna-Bi is well served by this unity of thrust, since it is in
fact a very ambitious project. There are in fact two distinct layers
to the film. The first is the content itself, which is both a yakuza
crime fiilm as well as a melodrama. Nishi, the protagonist embodied by
Kitano is a taciturn policeman who is confronting two sets of
psychological demons. The first is related to a less than smooth sting
operation, while the second centers around the fact that his wife is
dying. Conventional wisdom would suggest that a film with this much
'premise' should set about economically and efficiently relate the
plot until by the end it is hurtling at light speed to as big a bang
as its budget will allow. Instead there is a whole other layer to
Kitano's film where one would least expect to find it; in the formal
devices used. Kitano constructs his shots and by extension his entire
film with razour sharp precision and with absolute disregard to
textbook storytelling. Long scenes are spent in absolutely no service
whatsoever to the empirical events being narrated. And yet it is these
moments that are most articulate in commenting on the loneliness and
alienation that Nishi feel. Kitano foreshadows this method of
revealing truth through form as opposed to content through the first
third of his film. The sting operation referred to is shown several
times and yet it serves only to confuse. Even the source of bullets is
not clear. The viewer is left with recourse only to articulations
between shots, compositions, silence and Nishi's austere stare as the
only legitimate signs of the film's concerns.</P>
<P>    Although a number of sources have emphasized the content-linked
themes of the film, such as sacrifice, identity and in some sense
redemption, these seem to be cursory or at least only part of what
make Hanna-Bi intriguing. What truly is inspiring is the density of
the film's treatment of violence. It is a study of clinical precision
in this regard. In an interview in Film Comment (March-April 1998)
Kitano ws quite specific about the approach he wished to take to
violence in Hanna-Bi. It is an approach not unlike Michael Haneke's in
Funny Games (yet to be released in Ottawa) which exposes the
mundaneity of violence as it is used in conventional cinema. To this
end Hanna-Bi makes use offscreen space to haunt the viewer with
allusions to the acts comitted. We are shown either the brutal and
humiliating aftermaths (in the restaurant early in the film, at the
beach towrds the end..) or the spontaneous outburst. It has become
Nishi's last resort and only known way to express affection. (Not
unlike the protagonists in Tokyo Fist) On this basis the final scene
is one of excruciating compassion.</P>
<P>    It is the evolution that Nishi goes through to get to such a point
that maintains the interest of the content-linked elements of the
film. The perfectionist manner in which Nishi raises money and the
meandering journey it spawns are more literal components of this
evolution.  Throughout there are continuous shifts in tone and
possible motivations that the characters never seem one-dimensional or
just tools in a theorem. There is no easily explicable or definable
scapegoat to which Nishi's behaviour can be attributed and as such the
viewer is forced to confront the possible sources and to begin to
assess the precise effects of the various acts of brutality that are
depicted. These stand in counterpoint to the artwork produced at
intervals by another character in the film (whom I cannot divulge if i
want to limit the amount of plot I explain). These paintings and
drawings serve as perfect punctuation to a film as aesthetically
accomplished as this one. Not to be missed.</P>
