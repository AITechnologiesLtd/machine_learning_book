<PRE>DR. DOLITTLE
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Given the success of Babe, it's easy to see why Hollywood would be eager
to remake Dr. Dolittle. But, though they remembered the talking animals,
someone forgot to give this movie a sense of humor.</P>
<P>Even as a young boy, John Dolittle had a gift...he could talk to the
animals.  But after learning some inappropriate social customs from the
family dog (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres), he is forced to repress his
ability.  In fact he goes so far that he forgets his gift completely.
All is well until, twenty five years or so later, he receives a
convenient conk on the head.</P>
<P>As a grownup, John (Eddie Murphy) has become a successful doctor, and
has a wife (Kristen Wilson), and two daughters.  His partners (Oliver
Platt and Richard Schiff) and on the verge of selling their practice to
an HMO.  Just when Dr. Dolittle needs a level head, all the animals
around begin speaking to him.</P>
<P>The animal voices are mostly familiar, and it's actually more
entertaining trying to spot all the celebrity voices than it is
listening to what they have to say.  The most vociferous duo are Chris
Rock as the family pet guinea pig, and Norm MacDonald as a stray dog.
But John Leguizamo, Albert Brooks, Gary Shandling, Julie Kavner, Gilbert
Gottfried and others lend their pipes as well.</P>
<P>There are a few, a very few, funny moments with the speaking animals. If
you've seen the commercials for this one, you've seen them all. A
neurosis here, a raunchy reference there...after a while the repetitive
humor gets as stale as a box of three month old animal crackers.</P>
<P>When you're left with the human story in this film, you know you're in
trouble.  Your average TV sitcom has more depth than the characters here
(and at least twice the humor).  As an audience, you couldn't care less
about the whole HMO plot, which is the strongest element the human story
has in it.</P>
<P>As Dr. Dolittle, Eddie Murphy is stuck playing the straight man,
sidekick to the animals strutting their stuff.  However, in his previous
straight man role (that of Sherman Klump in The Nutty Professor), at
least he was a likable and interesting character in his own right.
Here, he's merely bland.</P>
<P>For a movie about animals, you'd expect a few animal tricks here and
there.  That's not the case in Dr. Dolittle. They simply wander about,
with animated lips thrown in later. The special effects are never
groundbreaking, but aren't too bad (except when they resort to that
guinea pig hand puppet).</P>
<P>If this is all animals have to say, we're not missing anything. And by
skipping Dr. Dolittle, neither will you.</P>
