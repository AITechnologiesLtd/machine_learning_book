<PRE>OCTOBER SKY
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * * 1/2 out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>October Sky is a rare oddity in cinema:  a self-proclaimed "uplifting"
film that is actually uplifting!  Based on the autobiographical book by
Homer Hickam, Rocket Boys, October Sky tells the struggle of four boys
reaching for their dream.</P>
<P>It's 1957, and for the boys of Coalwood, West Virginia, there's not much
hope of a rosy future.  Coalwood is a coal mining town, and, except for
the few lucky ones who manage to escape on a football scholarship, most
of Coalwood's boys are destined to work in the mine. But, in October
1957, an event happens that sparks one boy to dream. The launch of the
Soviet satellite Sputnik sets Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal) to dream a
future of rocketry and space travel.</P>
<P>Of course, Homer's parents (Chris Cooper and Natalie Canderday) aren't
quite sure what to make of their son's unusual interests.  Homer gets
his strongest encouragement from Miss Riley (Laura Dern), a teacher in
his school who also informs him about the scholarships offered to the
winners of a national science fair.</P>
<P>And so, with stars in his eyes, and thoughts of scholarships in his
head, Homer enlists the help of three other boys (William Lee Scott,
Chad Lindberg and Chris Owen) and begins to build a rocket.  But, do
these four backwoods boys even have the slightest hope of escaping their
destiny?</P>
<P>There is a lot that could have gone wrong with October Sky.  Nearly
every sequence flirts with becoming syrupy and cliched.  However,
miraculously, October Sky avoids nearly all of these pitfalls, making
the exact right moves at the exact right times.  A film emerges which
manages to be powerful and moving without slipping into the gauzy haze
of nostalgia or sliding down the sugarry slope of sappiness.</P>
<P>Jake Gyllenhaal is outstanding as the kid at the center of this film.
>From the outset of the film, he is immediately likable, and never seems
too corny or brainy as to alienate the audience. Unfortunately, while
October Sky focuses on Homer, the other three kids get the short end of
the stick.  They remain little more than placeholders reading "insert
friend here".</P>
<P>Of the adults in the film, Chris Cooper is the most fully realized
character.  The film never paints him as merely the villainous parent
standing in the way of his child's dreams, but, instead, shows the
multihued portrait of a man who wants the best for his family and town,
but is too stubborn to realize what that is.</P>
<P>Director Joe Johnson deserves much credit for successfully navigating
the many obstacles that October Sky manages to dodge. However, there are
still a few occasions when he allows things to proceed just a step too
far.  Scenes which were natural and inspiring start to become contrived
and artificial.  However, these lapses are minimal, and Johnson quickly
steers the movie back on course.</P>
<P>The problem with many so-called "uplifting" films is that they attempt
to force their mediciney goodness down your throat.  October Sky never
resorts to that level, and yet, manages to become a truly uplifting film
purely on its own merits.</P>
