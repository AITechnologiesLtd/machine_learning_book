<P> Big Daddy (1999) 2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Adam Sandler, Cole and
Dylan Sprouse, Joey Lauren Adams, Rob Schneider, Leslie Mann and Jon
Stewart.</P>
<P> A sure sign of a pending apocalypse: I enjoyed Adam Sandler's new movie.</P>
<P> In "Big Daddy," Sandler takes another tentative step toward playing an
adult, instead of his usual overgrown adolescent dufus.</P>
<P> This process began with "The Wedding Singer," skipping a step along the
way with The Waterboy.</P>
<P> In "Big Daddy," Sandler plays Sonny Koufax, a law school graduate who
works once a week as a toll booth operator while living off the $200,000 he
was awarded from a traffic accident lawsuit. (A taxicab had run over his
foot.)</P>
<P> When he is not working, Sonny just loafs around his apartment, eating
carry-in food and watching sports on his big-screen television.</P>
<P> One day, a 5-year-old boy, Julian, is dropped off at the apartment Sonny
shares with his law school buddy, Kevin. Julian is Kevin's son from a
long-ago one-night stand. With Kevin out of town, Sonny adopts Julian under
the false pretense of being his biological father.</P>
<P> Sonny is under the misguided impression that adopting Julian will impress
his girlfriend, Vanessa, and that she will take him back, realizing he is
ready to accept responsibility.</P>
<P> Of course, everything goes wrong. Vanessa dumps him, so Sonny tries to
return Julian to social services. However, he agrees to take care of him
until the agency can find a good home for the boy.</P>
<P> All this is pure dramatic - or comic, if you will - license. No social
service agency in the world would be so inept as to leave a child with an
Adam Sandler character, but this is the movies, so let's be charitable.</P>
<P> As time passes, Sonny and Julian form a warm, loving relationship. Sonny
teaches Julian such useful skills as how to tumble roller bladers and how
to relieve himself against a wall when no bathroom is available.</P>
<P> Sonny also allows Julian to wear whatever clothes he likes and to go by
whatever name he prefers. (Julian chooses Frankenstein for some odd
reason.)</P>
<P> While "Big Daddy" is replete with a year's allowance of bathroom and vomit
humor, it also is a movie with heart.</P>
<P> Sonny does come to love Julian, and vice versa. He sends the boy to
school, helps him with his homework and tries to give him a good home.</P>
<P> Things do begin to unravel when social services officials learn of Sonny's
ruse and take the boy away.</P>
<P> But being a comedy, everything works out for the best by the final fade-out.</P>
<P> Sandler is actually likable as Sonny. He adds some warmth and heart to his
usual comic repertoire of loud voices and funny faces, but even those are
toned down from his previous outings.</P>
<P> A fine supporinting cast, including Rob Schneider as the delivery boy who
spends so much time at Sandler's apartment that he is considered one of the
family, and Joey Lauren Adams as Layla, the young attorney who comes to
love Sonny for his humor and compassion.</P>
<P> Twins Cole and Dylan Sprouse are cute and not too obnoxious as Julian,
while Leslie Mann adds a nice comic flair as Corinne, Kevin's fiance - and
Sonny's mortal enemy - who used to work at Hooters and is the butt of many
jokes.</P>
<P> Another of the movie's finer points is the positive portrayal of two of
Sonny and Kevin's law school friends who are gay and have a solid, loving
relationship. It is a minor plot point, but one that adds to the overall
adult tone of the film.</P>
<P> "Big Daddy" can stand as one big promotion for Hooters because of all the
references to Corrine's time their as well as a funny closing sequence that
wraps up all the film's loose ends.</P>
<P> The script by Steve Franks, Tim Herlihy and Sandler, based on a story by
Franks, is a bit crude and vulgar, but ultimately it is cuddly and
touching.</P>
<P>And whoever thought you'd see those words in a review about an Adam Sandler
movie. Just goes to show that the human race is constantly evolving.</P>
