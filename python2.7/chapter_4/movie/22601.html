<P>Go long enough without sleep and you don't just feel tired, you feel like 
you're in another world. Hot and cold take turns to surge through your body 
as you stagger and yawn. You mumble nonsense, speak with great clarity, then 
relapse into mumbling again. Your eyes open and close like frustrated 
curtains as you drift between alertness and snoozing. The self-destructive 
feelings are heightened if you haven't eaten, and are surviving on cigarette 
smoke, or coffee, or booze. Trust me. I have experience in this area.</P>
<P>Frank Pierce, the New York City ambulance driver played by Nicolas Cage in 
"Bringing Out the Dead", lives like this for weeks on end. He sees himself as 
a "grief mop", paid to bear witness to hopeless situations, and it's damaging 
him. He gets through the long days and nights on a diet of whisky, coffee and 
Marlboros, begging his boss to fire him because he hasn't got the energy to 
quit.</P>
<P>The film has been written by Paul Schrader and directed by Martin Scorsese, 
and has been unfairly compared to their 1976 masterpiece "Taxi Driver". Both 
pictures feature angst-ridden insomniac protagonists who look out at the 
urban jungle from uncomfortable driver's seats, and both have dizzying images 
of garish neon light. But "Taxi Driver" was about a sensitive Vietnam vet 
whose terrible experiences were turning him into a psychopath; "Bringing Out 
the Dead" follows an essentially good man who is aware and afraid of his 
impending mental collapse.</P>
<P>Once, of course, Frank was good at his job -- acting with skill and speed, 
relishing the satisfaction of saving peoples' lives. Now he wanders around 
like a zombie, essentially performing a taxi service for corpses and crank 
callers. He feels tormented by the ghosts of those who he failed to save, and 
sometimes hears their voices: Particularly haunting is an asthmatic 18-year 
old girl named Rose, whose death signalled the beginning of Frank's unlucky 
streak.</P>
<P>We follow Frank around for three days, and see him work with three other 
ambulance men: Larry (John Goodman), a family man who dreams of starting his 
own private medical service; Marcus (Ving Rhames), who calls himself a 
Christian but has a mischievous spirit; and Tom (Tom Sizemore), who can only 
be described as a nutcase. Each of these men is distinctively written and 
played, and yet, in some odd way, all three shifts seem the same. Whoever's 
in the ambulance with you, it's just another miserable day on the job.</P>
<P>Most of the characters that are revisited by the screenplay revolve in some 
way around Mary (Patricia Arquette), a recovering drug addict who Frank 
thinks he could fall in love with. Her father is in hospital after a heart 
attack. A crazy guy from her neighbourhood keeps putting himself in dangerous 
situations, and winding up in Frank's vehicle. And her former drug dealer is 
given some attention, too. But none of this stuff really signifies much, 
because "Bringing Out the Dead" is told from Frank's point of view, and is 
about his inability to find meaning in anything.</P>
<P>That's not as bleak as it sounds, because the closing shots leave us with the 
impression that Frank will eventually find some peace in his life. But it is 
exhausting, because to get the point across Schrader and Scorsese have had to 
make a two-hour film in which nothing can be seen to develop after the 
initial set-up.</P>
<P>And yet I recommend "Bringing Out the Dead" as a marvellous atmospheric 
achievement. Like Frank, from the opening moments we're immersed in neon 
light and bumpy automobile movements, and in such techniques as jump cuts, 
dissolves, slow-motion, fast-motion and subjective camera. Scorsese's 
instinct to employ Robert Richardson was a good one -- the cinematographer's 
juxtaposition of extreme brightness and darkness create an overpoweringly 
drowsy mood that brings us into Frank's head. Not that it's a particularly 
nice place to be, as Cage demonstrates with his amazing performance -- 
whenever we glimpse him, he's hollow-eyed, desperate, hunched over, hesitant.</P>
<P>There is much dark humour in this movie, arising from the absurdity of some 
of the patients' predicaments, and the twisted games we see medics engage in 
to pass the time. But it's the harsher images that stick in our minds, 
because Scorsese makes us feel like we're seeing them first-hand. John Lennon 
once sung about "a place where nothing is real... where everything flows". 
I'm sure Frank Pierce would love to go there.</P>
