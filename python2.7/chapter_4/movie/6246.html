<P>'TILL DEATH DO US PART' COMEDY MISSES ITS MARK</P>
<P>There's something extremely unsatisfying about a movie that keeps its
fingers on your pulse, but fails to push the right buttons. And FAITHFUL is
a one of those movies that has its moments, but never quite takes off as a
whole.</P>
<P>Actor Chazz Palminteri's comic thriller is an inspired tale of a wife who
discovers that her husband has hired a hitman to dispose of her on their
twentieth wedding anniversary. From its tantaliser of an opening, FAITHFUL
throws up witty one-liners, sexual tension between repressed housewife
Margaret and broodingly neurotic gunman Tony, as well as a potentially
compelling debate on whether it's possible to remain faithful to the same
person all your life.</P>
<P>For example, Margaret asks Tony, in the desperate curiosity of one about to
die, whether he's ever slept with a whore. He replies, haughtily, "I only
sleep with whores."</P>
<P>The key to Palminteri's script is the dialogue between Margaret and Tony,
which deftly juggles that fine line between irreverent and seriousness. And
director Paul Mazursky (ENEMIES, A LOVE STORY) gives the dialogue
considerable attention, producing some classy moments. Cher turns in an
excellent performance as Margaret, bringing to it inimitable comic timing
and an unexpected poignance. Palminteri reprises his familiar hitman role,
though with less panache than as the memorable Cheech in BULLETS OVER
BROADWAY. And both play up the sexual tension to the hilt.</P>
<P>But the movie tries to be a bit too clever. The numerous flashbacks and
cuts to Margaret's husband Jack are distracting and often ineffectual; Ryan
O'Neal does nothing for the role of Jack with his wooden, humourless mug,
and the flashbacks only serve to draw us away from the immediacy of the
Margaret-Tony interplay.  Worse of the lot are the cheesy slow-mo shots of
Jack's mistress sashaying about.</P>
<P>The biggest culprit of the 'trying-too-hard' syndrome is the movie's
attempt to moralize, it's insistence on Making A Point. Like the
wide-angled shots of Jack and Margaret's opulent mansion; read: money can't
buy happiness. Or the constant rehashing of the 'faithfulness' theme--why
can't men be faithful, why women shouldn't bother to be faithful--which
gets to be about as annoying as a fly buzzing about your head.</P>
<P>Like the intense, tough-talking Tony who can't bring himself to pull a
trigger on any woman, FAITHFUL has a lot behind it, but manages to shoot
itself in the foot. Which is why, despite its potential, despite actors the
calibre of Cher and Palminteri, FAITHFUL won't win any critical acclaim. A
pity.</P>
<P>Clarissa Oon has no qualms about being faithful--to her dog.</P>
<P>The Flying Inkpot Rating System:
 * Wait for the TV2 broadcast.
 ** A little creaky, but still better than staying at home with Gotcha! 
 *** Pretty good, bring a friend.
 **** Amazing, potent stuff.
 ***** Perfection. See it twice.</P>
