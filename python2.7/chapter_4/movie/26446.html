GET CARTER
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>Generic brands have revolutionized consumer products from drugs to 
cigarettes, so why not movies?  Maybe the multiplexes of the future will 
dispense with marquee titles in favor of generic packaging labels like 
Comedy, Romance and Action.   If so, GET CARTER would appear to be a 
trend setter, as you couldn't find a more generic action thriller than 
GET CARTER.  Its dialog is superfluous.  What little impact the movie 
has is due solely to its clichéd images.</P>
<P>The problem with this line of reasoning is that movies like GET CARTER, 
starring pricey stars like Sylvester Stallone, can't be made on a 
pittance, so the tickets have to be full price if there is ever to be 
any hope of recouping the financial backers' investments.  And, if 
moviegoers are required to pay about nine bucks a ticket for a bad movie 
like GET CARTER, why wouldn't they choose instead a great one, like 
ALMOST FAMOUS, for the same price?</P>
<P>GET CARTER, as you may know, is a remake of perhaps the best known film 
of director Mike Hodges (CROUPIER).  The original in 1971 starred 
Michael Caine as Jack Carter.  Caine, replaced by Sylvester Stallone, 
gets a cameo part in this version, which is directed by Stephen T. Kay 
(the writer of THE MOD SQUAD remake) and written by David McKenna (BODY 
SHOTS).  The recent résumés alone of the director and writer should give 
you pause.</P>
<P>As the story opens, Carter is attending the funeral of his estranged 
brother, who died under mysterious circumstances.  As a fossilized 
action hero, Stallone just stares and broods when he's not hitting 
someone.  </P>
<P>Mickey Rourke, an actor whose mere presence in a movie immediately 
raises a big red flag in my mind, plays Carter's nemesis, Cyrus Paice.  
Cyrus, with his ubiquitous dark sunglasses framed in iridescent green, 
shares a trait with Carter.  With their aging muscles and bulging veins, 
they look like a couple of old lifeguards who are about to OD from too 
many late nights at the gym.</P>
<P>The women are all given throw away parts, Miranda Richardson as Carter's 
sister-in-law, Rachael Leigh Cook as his niece and Gretchen Mol as 
Carter's love interest.  The important roles go to the boys with their 
toys, who get to chase in fast cars, shoot noisy guns and fight with big 
fists.  </P>
<P>The movie is set, incongruously, in that hotbed of crime, that notorious 
underworld city of latte lovers and dot-com darlings -- Seattle!  As a 
wiry and flagrantly wealthy software geek, Alan Cumming modestly informs 
Carter that "I'm the all powerful ruler of time and space."  See what 
excessive caffeine will do to your brain.</P>
<P>Before annihilating the first guy to get in his way, Carter tells him, 
"You really don't want to know me."  I completely agree.  You don't want 
to waste your time and money getting to know Jack Carter, especially 
when the movie in the next screen would have to be better.</P>
<P>GET CARTER runs a long 1:55.  It is rated R for violence, language, some 
sexuality and drug content and would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
