<P>THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is by far one of the very very best, if not THEE
best film of the 1990's. It is one of the most rich examples of cinema of
recent time and truly lets it be known that "movies" can be forms of art in
every sense. This film was the film that was nominated for everything and yet
won nothing, a very sad and undeserved disappointment. It was beat out by
BRAVEHEART for the Best Picture Oscar in 1995, and to be honest, I would hate
to have to decide between the two.</P>
<P>THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is based on a short story by Stephen King, but,
before you jump to any conclusions, it does not involve the occult,
supernatural, or any ghosts, ghouls, and goblins. It is the story of Andy
Dufresne (Tim Robbins best role to date), the successful vice president
banker, is on trial for the murder of his wife and her lover. As we quickly
learn, she was having a steamy affair with some unknown golf pro, and both
were shot to death in bed just minutes after Andy, drunk and carrying a
loaded pistol, waited outside the lover's house. With no other suspects and a
gun that was never found, Andy is sadly sentenced to two life-sentences for
double homicide.</P>
<P>The story is narrated by our other central character of the plot: a black,
slightly older prisoner simply known as "Red" (played magnificently by Morgan
Freeman). Red seems to be the most sympathetic, mature, and sensible prisoner
at Shawshank, the New England prison where we do time along with the inmates.
He is also known for being able to smuggle in anything you need (within
reason that is). He is a self-proclaimed "Sears & Roebuck", and from the
moment Andy arrives, something draws Red to him. Andy seems so peaceful,
humble, and even unaware of his dreary surroundings and his dreary reality.
Even when he is raped and beaten, he manages to go about every day as though
he had no cares in the world.</P>
<P>SHAWSHANK doesn't take long to get you so engrossed in it's characters, that
you find it impossible not to care about them and what they're going to do
next. You feel their pain, you smile with their happiness, and you feel
desperate with their desperation. Such character driven movies are always my
favorite. They're the kind of movies where most of the plot and intrigue is
simply getting to know the characters, making them real and tangible, and as
much a part of your life as they can be. SHAWSHANK succeeds where so many
others don't.</P>
<P>THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is such a beautifully done picture that it makes it
hard to write about. Words like "great", "fantastic", and "wonderful" are so
overused and unjustifying for such a masterpiece. But, for the lack of better
words, the cinematography IS great, the depth of the story IS fantastic, and
the acting, direction, and everything else IS absolutely wonderful. It is a
touching film that could (and should) bring a tear to your eye despite it's
depressing overtones.</P>
<P>To repeat myself, as I can find no other way to praise this film, THE
SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is truly a masterpiece and one of the best of the best
movies of the decade. If you miss this one, you ARE missing out on something
spectacular! Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins, director Frank Darabont, and
cinematographer Roger Deakins all deserve the highest acclaims. This IS an
instant classic!</P>
