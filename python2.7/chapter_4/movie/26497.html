<P>Funny how we take so many things in our lives for granted. I see and do
things all the time without thinking about any of the people behind the
scenes of it all, and this film is a perfect example of one of the things
that I've never really thought about. Dog shows. I've always known about
them, I've caught a glimpse of them on the Sports Network from time to time,
but I've never really sat down and thought about what they truly consisted.
But have no fear, because writer/director Christopher Guest has come up with
an excellent mockumentary featuring the dogs, the people and all the rest of
the obsessive insanity that goes on behind the scenes at these dog shows.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A faux documentary featuring several dog owners preparing to take their
prize pets to the big show in Philadelphia. Along the way, we get an insight
into the world of dog shows, as well as all of the competition, neurotic
owner behavior and everything else that you'd expect from a "hobby" which
some people obviously take too seriously.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A very funny, original take on the world of dog shows, filled with many
memorable characters, hilarious commentary and even some constructive
education about the industry behind the shows themselves. I'm more of a "cat
guy" myself, but you don't need to love dogs to enjoy this movie. The many
well-developed kooky characters are what drew me into this film, and I just
loved watching all of these actors riff left and right. Give Eugene Levy and
Catherine O'Hara some of the highest praise in this regard, with super
chemistry, perfect tit-for-tat dialogue sessions and one especially
hilarious sequence with Larry Miller as an old flame. You see, O'Hara's
character used to be "easy" when she was young, and the film features many
very funny moments of her former conquests crudely making points about their
trysts together, right in front of her timid husband. We also have the
extremely neurotic snooty couple, Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock, who
feel the need to bring their dog with them to their psychiatrist and who
simply cannot seem to control their own diva-esque behavior. Kudos to both
of them, and especially on whoever decided to slap braces on the poor fools.
Nice touch.</P>
<P>The two final couples also offer many moments of chuckle in their own right,
especially the flamboyant gay character portrayed fabulously by John Michael
Higgins, and the very controlling dog trainer played intensely by Jane
Lynch. I mention all of these names and all of these characters because they
are what make up the fabric of this entire movie, and if you don't like
them, then you will more than likely not "get" this movie. I appreciated
them all, save for Christopher Guest's own character in the film, and I
especially loved two of the "smaller" personalities in the movie. The first
is Ed Begley Jr. (where has he been?) who slurps it all up as the manager of
the host hotel and Fred Willard, who in unquestionably the funniest thing
about this movie. He literally steals the show as one of the commentators of
the big dog show finale, and delivers some of the best lines that I've heard
all year. You couldn't find a bigger boob to add color commentary to the
show than this very misinformed gentleman! And a great job by his straight
man British co-host as well. Overall, I don't believe this comedy is suited
for most people. There is a lot of dry and satirical humor here, which may
not be appreciated by some. But for anyone who loved Guest's WAITING FOR
GUFFMAN, knows of the improvisational techniques perfected here by all
participants, and just plain loves dogs, this puppy is a perfect companion
for this fall's lazy weekend getaway. Funny and original...nice combo!</P>
