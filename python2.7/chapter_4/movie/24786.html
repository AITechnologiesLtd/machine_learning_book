<P>NOMINATED FOR 4 GOLDEN APOLLO AWARD

<PRE>"Once I was blind, now I can see"
- "THE GAME"</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: 10/10</PRE>
<P>This film has the shortest trailer I've ever seen. For a brief moment a
short message passed the screen: "..From the director of "Se7en" -- 'The
Game'..". That's it. Indeed after creating "Se7en" in 1997, David Fincher
doesn't need any introduction. He is universally known as the creator of one
of the most horrifying and provocative thrillers since the dawn of
moviemaking. If he decided to remake 'The Exorcist' as his next film, nobody
would be surprised. The critics proclaimed that this "bright new star" would
not create anything "as provoking" in many years. His next film came
therefore as a big surprise, since it is actually better! This is a
gripping, dizzying and thoroughly entertaining thriller which bears no
resemblance whatsoever to 'Se7en', except in the obvious talent of the
director. Come inside..Players needed..</P>
<P>His name here is Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas), scion of the
super-rich Van Ortons of San Francisco. Dark rooms, cold floors, and bland
gray suits abound as Nicholas tends to his daily business of being filthy
rich and alone. Wide screen views of his grand mansion or office focus on
the glorious facade of his life, but soon we learn that there is more
underneath this mask of perfection. Looking at him moving slowly within the
many rooms in his mansion, makes us realize his loneliness and misery.
Fincher skillfully crafts the image that Nicholas is a small cog in the
grand scheme, passively observing as his life slowly drifts away without
him, while his fortune builds effortlessly. Van Orton at first seems a
victim of his own making, but from the opening home-movie sequence and
occasional flashbacks, we get to know that his detachment from people is a
defense developed as a young boy after he'd witnessed his father's suicide.
Four decades later, he's a disturbed middle-age man himself, perhaps
predisposed to suicide now that his age matches his father's last year. He
is celebrating his 48 birthday as the last one -- completely alone, in his
gigantic and equally lonely estate. A spark in his everyday existence is the
appearance of his long lost brother, Conrad (Sean Penn). Knowing about Nic's
problems, Conrad offers him a special present -- a contract with Consumer
Recreation Services. "They'll make your life..fun". Suspicious about the
unknown company, Nic starts to ask around. He suddenly discovers that all
his friends and associates are members of what appears to be a powerful
underground company, with offices around the world, financed by men of
wealth and power. In order to play, Nicholas endures extensive physical and
mental tests, while also completing endless personality questionnaires. As
an answer to Nic's question "What are you selling?", the manager replies "We
provide..what's missing.." The 'game' is tailored to his particular needs,
determined by a grueling battery of psychological tests. The "profound life
experience" begins quietly but soon erupts in a confusing maze of
devastating events. Terrorized by unknown forces and shadowy figures who
seem intent on dismantling everything he has built, Van Orton has to win
this deadly game or lose control of everything in his life. A paranoid
nightmare, with enough violent coincidences and near-death experiences to
make Kafka give up writing and move to Sunnybrook Farm.</P>
<P>Fincher tightens the screws psychologically as well as viscerally. As tautly
as he can fashion a chase or an action sequence, he's even better at
creating a pervasive atmosphere of impending doom, or the unsettling
possibility that literally anything could happen next. The game overlaps and
overtakes his life when his house is vandalized and his company's funds are
tapped and drained. Even his friends seem connected to his downfall, and the
waitress, who turns up again, has more than just drinks to spill on him.
Technically, Fincher has captured the essence of the thriller through a
great use of his camera. The initial expansive views of Nicholas in his
home, seemingly possessing control of his life, begin to close in on him. As
the pressure on Nicholas rises, we find him trapped in elevators, running
down alleys and dank hallways, and locked in cars. Sweat and strain replace
the calm and command that Nicholas once possessed. The paranoia runs deep
and even Conrad does not appear trustworthy.</P>
<P>Fincher has wisely concentrated on Van Orton, making the audience share his
paranoia, suspecting everyone - while fighting an invisible enemy. The
supporting characters, including his own brother, appear as mysterious and
faceless enemies within a destructive machinery. Douglas is the perfect
choice for the cynic and cold business man. Nicholas is the product of the
American system, a product of society. He is the face behind the American
dream, living in its reality. Douglas is fabulous, both as the sophisticated
'king of the world' and as the confused and haunted victim. Sean Penn is
likewise incredible, trying to be Nic's opposite, never becoming like his
older brother. The other actors fill their small parts well, including the
secretive waitress. What do you give the man that have everything? What's
missing? And what's missing in the lives of business men and aristocrats is
suspense, thrill, fear and excitement, but mostly love and feelings.</P>
<P>- Fincher's camera work, brilliant editing and dark score create an
atmosphere, that would make Hichock look like a schoolboy. After making
"Se7en" he left us all shocked, with this one he dazzled and amazed us, as
he invited the audience into his intelligent maze of refreshing events,
ideas and thoughts. He left me in the theatre -- shocked, amazed,
enlightened, wondering: what's next?</P>
