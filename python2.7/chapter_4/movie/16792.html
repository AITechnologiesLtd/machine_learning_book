                           MY FAVORITE MARTIAN
                         A movie review by Joe Barlow
                             (c) Copyright 1999</PRE>
<PRE>STARRING:  Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Daniels, Darryl Hannah,
                Ray Walston
DIRECTOR:  Donald Petrie
WRITERS:   Sherri Stoner and Deanna Oliver
RATED:     PG
RELEASED:  1999</PRE>
<PRE>                 RATING: ** 1/2  (out of a possible ****)</PRE>
<P>        Whoever thought to cast Christopher Lloyd as the alien in
Disney's new remake of "My Favorite Martian" is to be commended, as
he tends to look like he's just visiting this planet to begin with.
Lloyd's unusual face and voice make him perfect for the role of
"Uncle Martin," a friendly extraterrestrial who finds himself
stranded on Earth after a spaceship crash.</P>
<P>        Donald Petrie's remake of the '60s television series is
agreeable enough, I suppose: it's bright, zany, and smart enough to
reinvent the characters for the 1990s, rather than locking them into
a 1960s mentality (as in the recent "Brady Bunch" films).  There's
a lot of action and humor which borders on the surreal (watch as Jeff
Daniels and Daryl Hannah try Martian gum for the first time), but
unfortunately that doesn't stop the movie from following a routine
storyline which culminates in an unnecessary (and distracting)
romance.</P>
<P>        Tim O'Hara (Jeff Daniels) is an unsuccessful TV producer
who works for a local news program.  Although Tim rarely gets to
cover the big stories, he finds one when he observes a crashing
spaceship.  Tim eventually befriends the alien inside, an
excitable but friendly creature he christens Uncle Martin.</P>
<P>        Martin is quite a character.  Able to control gravity and
change his shape, the curious alien enjoys learning about Earth
culture from his new friend.  One of his favorite Earth delicacies
is ice cream, which for Martin has an effect similar to alcohol.
(You'd think the first ice cream hangover would teach him a
lesson, but no.)  Martin and Tim also debate whether Earth or
Martian culture is superior:</P>
<PRE>        MARTIN: "Human astronauts pee in their space suits!
                 Case closed!"</PRE>
<P>        You know you're watching a Disney film when an article
of clothing becomes one of the most memorable characters.  Martin's
spacesuit, Zoot, is animate, loves to talk, and has a personality
more concretely defined than any of the human characters.  This is
a good idea in theory, but Zoot is so unique that everyone else
seems much less interesting by comparison, including Martin
himself.</P>
<P>        Daryl Hannah, for example, is basically wasted in the role
of Lizzie, Tim's friend and co-worker.  She's here only to be the
requisite love interest, and to help Tim and Martin escape from
one particularly nasty situation they later find themselves in (a
trick she accomplishes with the help of the aforementioned
Martian gum).  Although she gets a lot of screen time, Lizzie is
unfortunately never allowed to be anything more than a plot point.
(Why is it that no one is ever in a happy relationship at the
*beginning* of a movie?)</P>
<P>        Ray Walston, who played the original Uncle Martin in the
television series, gets an extended cameo here as a SETI official
hot on the trail of the alien.  The role is thoroughly unnecessary,
and appears to have been inserted for no other reason than to give
Walston a reason to appear in the film.  He plays up to the camera
big time: as we know, Martians get "drunk" on ice cream.  Witness
how Walston turns right to the camera at one point and takes a big
bite of vanilla.  I guess it's supposed to be ironic that the former
Martian is now eating ice cream, but it comes across as nothing more
than camera-hogging.  Yeah, hi Ray.  We see you.</P>
<P>        Perhaps most disappointing is the film's willingness to
follow its characters down irrelevant tangents, even when
urgency is required.  Martin appears frantic when he discovers
that an explosion will result if he doesn't take off within 12
hours, but nonetheless, he and Tim go about their business in a
leisurely manner.  And I was most surprised to discover that an
alternator from an American car will interface with a Martian
spacecraft engine with no rewiring whatsoever.  Neato.</P>
<P>        I know, I know, I'm missing the point.  As a kids' movie,
there's nothing wrong with "My Favorite Martian"; parts of it are
fun, and Lloyd in particular goes above and beyond the call of
duty to keep the audience laughing.  But like most science-fiction
films, the movie relies more on effects than story.  Kids will
probably enjoy it, and so will adults (if they have a love for
wacky physical comedy), but I was hoping for a little less formula
and a little more science.</P>
