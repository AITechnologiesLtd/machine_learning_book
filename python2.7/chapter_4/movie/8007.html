                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>**** (out of 4 = excellent)

[crime/satire]
starring: John Travolta (Vincent Vega), Samuel L. Jackson (Jules Winfield),
Bruce Willis (Butch Coolidge), Uma Thurman (Mia Wallace), produced by
Lawrence Bender, written by Quentin Tarantino, Roger Avary, directed by
Quentin Tarantino.</P>
<P>"Pulp Fiction" is such a landmark film it's difficult to describe the many
nuances and offbeat elements that make it great. It's greatness lies in the
fact that right from the get-go it establishes an entirely different, yet
completely plausible reality.</P>
<P>The title refers to those old cheap magazines not unlike comic books that
tell stories of "lurid subject matter," and that is exactly what we get here.
>From the basic plots and stories, to the characters' dialogue, to the
individual props, and the way they all work together to create such an
uncanny story.</P>
<P>As the film opens we see a seemingly normal couple having breakfast in a
coffee shop. We realize they are robbers complaining about their "job" and
it's funny not only because of the dialogue, but because it's relatable even
though the characters are not. They decide to rob the restaurant and the tone
of the film is set from this short scene alone.</P>
<P>The film then cuts to a different setting as we again eavesdrop on another
strange conversation, this time between two men describing the funny
differences between Europe and America. We later learn their names are
Vincent (Travolta) and Jules (Jackson) and they are hitmen about to go to
"work" themselves. But this is no ordinary crime film, and what we get is so
offbeat, "pulp" is really the only way to describe it.</P>
<P>As Vincent and Jules walk to their destination they start an interesting
conversation about their mob boss and his wife. This subject then leads to a
hilarious discussion about the differences between foot massages and oral
sex. Although the dialogue is laced with profanity and the overall basis of
the conversation (and the film as a whole) is taboo in nature, the way
everything is depicted is genius because it's so original and fascinating.</P>
<P>Since this film is a modern day pulp magazine it is not a linear story, but
a collection of at least three different ones that come together as a whole.
Tarantino's script is not so much concerned with overcoming a conflict as it
is showing how the characters affect each other. </P>
<P>After Vincent and Jules do their work, we then follow Vincent as he takes
his boss's wife, Mia (Thurman), out to dinner. Their night out becomes
something very bizarre, yet totally believable all along. It flirts with
disaster but the brilliant satirical mood keeps it funny and interesting, and
(gasp!) also starts to convey a theme.</P>
<P>Basically, the film is about salvation and justice where you'd least expect
to find it. Vincent and Mia narrowly escape death, and a similar theme of
redemption is portrayed when Butch Coolidge (Willis), a struggling boxer,
disobeys the mob boss Marselius Wallace (Ving Rhames), and through a series
of undescribable events, the two must work together to save themselves from a
common, twisted enemy.</P>
<P>The ending itself comes full circle back to the beginning which could be and
probably is reflective of some kind of spiritual philosophy of "The Circle of
Life."</P>
<P>Everything that could be great about "Pulp Fiction" is: the acting; the
story; the offbeat, funny dialogue; and especially the film's ability to be
so complex and profound yet so interesting and easy to follow. </P>
