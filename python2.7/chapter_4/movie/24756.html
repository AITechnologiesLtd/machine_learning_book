<P>Teen slasher has been noticeable these days. We've had films such as "Scream"
and its 3 sequels, "I know what you did last summer" and its far inferior
"sequel", "Urban Legend" and its sequel. What brought out these teen slashers
is the fact that they are sadly all hits. Even though I liked some of the
films, I did get tired of seeing teens running around getting slashes up, its
been done before and nothing is original. Well nothing could have gotten me
ready for a terrifying film, that I first saw a preview for on "Next Friday".
The trailer truly scared me, and made the film look great, but I knew it would
be just another teen slasher movie. Well I was wrong, you never see the killer
and the film never drops into that teen slasher feel.</P>
<P>The film starts out with a terrifyingly real plane crash, where a group of
students are getting ready to go to France. Aboard the plane Alex Browning
(Devon Sawa) has a dream/vision of the plane crashing in a realistic way.
Everything that happened prior in his dream, happens when he wakes up, and he
goes crazy, getting him and five of his friends kicked off the flight, and one
teacher. When he is back into the lobby he explains what happened in his dream,
to which no one believes, until the plane explodes, and all the students die. A
few months later,  weird things are starting to happen, his friends are
starting to die by someone....something, Alex along with his friends has try
and figure out what is doing this, before it gets them, and he must remember,
he cheated death so death is after him.</P>
<P>The film is directed by James Wong and is fantastic. The thing that I found
best about the movie was the fact that you never saw who was killing these
people, most of which occured on accident in very very inventive ways. Some
brilliant ideas really flow throughout this movie, and I found myself stunned
in my seat about how far it strayed from being a teen slasher film, this is a
real mature adult movie only with a teen cast. The cast is a far cry from being
like others where the performances are wooden, this is a cast that is
definately talented.</P>
<P>Devon Sawa clocks in one great performance as the psychic Alex who can sense
what is going to happen in the future, his character is so well-thought and
Devon brings him out brilliantly, and gives us a character we can both relate
to, and hope we never have to. Ali Larter (who was previously in "House on
Haunted Hill" and "Varsity Blues") gives a great down to earth performance, as
a girl who is an outcast, not very well-known, but very special in her own way.
The rest of the cast includes Kerr Smith, Daniel Roebuck and the always great
Tony Todd round out a great cast.</P>
<P>This is one breathtakingly scary film, that is one of the scariest I have seen.
It's inventiveness never ceases to amaze me, the script is brilliantly written,
and James Wong is a great new director. I definately recommend "Final
Destination" to those who are tired of teen movies, and ready for a hardcore
horror flick.</P>
