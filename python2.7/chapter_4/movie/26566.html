Susan Granger's review of "BAMBOOZLED" (New Line Cinema)</PRE>
<P>   In this satirical fable, Spike Lee tackles race, television
and how blacks are depicted in the media. Taking its title from a
Malcolm X speech about how black people have allowed themselves to be
hoodwinked and led astray, the story revolves around Pierre Delacroix
(Damon Wayans), a frustrated, black, Harvard-grad TV writer who, under
orders from his boss (Michael Rapaport), comes up with a truly
offensive concept - a postmodern minstrel show - that immediately
becomes a hit. Incorporating all the shockingly bad taste possible,
"Mantan: The New Millennium Minstrel Show" stars homeless street
performers (Savion Glover, Tommy Davidson) in blackface cavorting in a
watermelon patch on a plantation. Smearing one's face with charcoal
suddenly becomes the chic, "IN" thing to do. The theme is Lee's
assertion that today's successful black entertainers (Cuba Gooding
Jr., Whoopi Goldberg, Will Smith, Diana Ross, etc.) are no more than
participants in racist minstrel shows.  But they're not the only ones
under attack. Lee also goes after Mother Teresa, President Clinton, Al
Sharpton, Johnnie Cochran, various networks, athletes and the NAACP.
Lee's use of digital video with multiple cameras creates the quality
of a documentary expose - and popular culture is the villain. The real
hero is Junebug, Delacroix's father (Paul Mooney), a racy comic who
refused to comply with Hollywood. But Lee allows his (justifiable)
anger to run rampant over reason in the final tedious third of the
film. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Bamboozled" is a
scathing 6. If you want to see the most perceptive indictment of
TV-spawned culture, rent Elia Kazan's "A Face in the Crowd" (1957),
written by Budd Schulberg, starring Andy Griffith, or Paddy
Chayefsky's chilling "Network" (1976).</P>
