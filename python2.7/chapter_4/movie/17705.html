<PRE>EDTV
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        When I first saw the previews for Ron Howard's latest film, my
expectations were discouragingly low.  A show about nothing?  Sounds like
"Seinfeld."  A guy whose entire life is broadcast 24 hours a day?  Sounds
like "The Truman Show."  What is it with Hollywood that no sooner than one
production company puts out an animated feature about ants, another puts
one out about bugs?</P>
<P>        Which is why I was pleasantly surprised by "EdTV," which turns out
to be a fresh, insightful, and often times hilarious film about the follies
of instant celebrity.</P>
<P>        The writing, by Howard's longtime collaborators Lowell Ganz and
Babaloo Mandel, is right on the money and Howard himself should be credited
for giving the subject matter a fresh focus.  In the hands of a
less-experienced director, "EdTV" could easily have had all the flavor of
yesterday's meatloaf.</P>
<P>        With their 'True TV' cable ratings being threatened by 'The
Gardening Channel' (apparently people would rather watch soil), the
NorthWest Broadcasting Company is looking for a novel concept to attract
viewers.  Program Director Cynthia Topping (Ellen DeGeneres) comes up with
the idea of putting a nobody on the air and broadcasting his every waking
and sleeping moment.  The hook is to find a regular guy, someone normal
that people can relate to.  While scouting possible candidates, Cynthia's
camera crew discover Ed Pekurny and his pig brother Ray (Woody Harrelson)
in a bar, where Ray believes he has what it takes for his fifteen plus
minutes of fame.  But on watching the videotape, the show's producers are
more taken with Ed than with Ray.  He's cute, he says all the wrong things,
and he's 100% USDA hick.</P>
<P>        Cynthia's boss, played by Rob Reiner, gives the show a week to
deliver the goods and it's tough going in the early stages.  The most
exciting thing that happens is Ed brushes his teeth.  "Action shot!" wags
one of the production assistants when a couple of Pop Tarts jump out of the
toaster.  You get the idea.</P>
<P>        But soon enough, things--Nielsen-boosting kinds of things--start to
happen to this unassuming San Francisco video store clerk and the 'True TV'
cameras are right there to document it.  Ed's privacy is no longer his own,
his newfound fame starts having a negative impact on his family life, and
what little dignity he has left is trampled on by the media.  Who should Ed
go out with?  You can be sure the pollsters have a list.</P>
<P>        Not only is the film exceedingly well cast, but its performers are
consistently excellent.  Matthew McConaughey provides the face, the body
language, and the lovable Texan accent to fill the shoes of America's
latest phenomenon.  He and Harrelson look like they really could be
brothers.  Sally Kirkland is noteworthy in a difficult role as Ed's mother,
and Martin Landau is one of the film's highlights as Al, Ed's ailing
stepfather.  Jenna Elfman (from TV's "Dharma and Greg") proves herself
surprisingly worthy in the company of Kirkland and Landau, although those
Alpine eyebrows of hers get a little distracting.  Even DeGeneres and
Reiner are better than you'd expect.</P>
<P>        In 1979, writer/director/comedian Albert Brooks made a zany little
film called "Real Life" in which a small-time opportunist makes a real-time
documentary about a typical American family.  The scenes of Ed's family
sitting around the dinner table feasting on Kentucky Fried Chicken and
waxing idiotic play like a big-budget variant on that film, paralleling its
wickedly inventive humor.  As with most films by Albert Brooks, "Real Life"
was funny, but absurd.  The funniest--and scariest--thing about "EdTV" is
that it is absolutely believable.</P>
