<PRE>                              COP LAND 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                 2 :-) :-)  for the Sheriff of Garrrison</PRE>
<P>I like a man who isn't afraid to show his weight, look scruffy and worn
down by the ills of society. He walks about with a dogged look on his
face, at first blindly obeying his master's dodgy whims, turning a deaf
ear to the suspicious cries of organised crime. It would appear that
this sheriff who would be a cop, has been beaten into submission by the
forces above him, until that something timely snaps within. This is a
man who isn't ‘macho' or even an ‘action hero', but an ordinary man
trying to find meaning in his upside down world where nothing is as it
seems. I like this new Sylvester Stallone in his apparently first
non-egotistical role.</P>
<P>Following in the same vein as LA CONFIDENTIAL, COP LAND discusses all
the wonderful issues about corrupt police officers - the people who
society despises most. Headed by Harvey Keitel, this Mob/Cop syndicate
has made a safe haven for itself in a small town outside NY. In this
white washed community cops live peacefully side by side, but beneath
the calm exterior fury boils as they sleep with each others wives,
quibble amongst themselves and even kill their own when their community
is threatened. So the joy of the story arises from good eventually
prevailing over evil, and the once beaten Sheriff (Stallone) awakening
to his better self. Where like a faithful wounded dog, he'll keep coming
at you right till the very end.</P>
<P>The star studded cast is almost too numerous to mention, but there are
fine performances from Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Annabella Sciorra,
Janeane Garofalo who play the other major leads. It almost seems like a
family reunion for American Italian actors come to make a spaghetti
meatball picture. Not as good or heartfelt as LA CONFIDENTIAL, but still
a movie which is worth an honourable mention. Worthwhile viewing
overall.</P>
