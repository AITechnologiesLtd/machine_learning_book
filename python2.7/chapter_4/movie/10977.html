<PRE>DESPERATE MEASURES</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: *1/2 (out of ****) </PRE>
<P>TriStar / 1:40 / 1998 / R (language, violence, wasted talent)
Cast: Michael Keaton; Andy Garcia; Brian Cox; Marcia Gay Harden; Joseph 
Cross; Erik King; Efrain Figueroa 
Director: Barbet Schroeder 
Screenplay: David Klass </P>
<P>"Desperate Measures" is a generic title for a film that's beyond 
generic. It's also a depressing waste of talent, with the solid team of 
Michael Keaton and Andy Garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles, 
not to mention once-cool director Barbet Schroeder sadly continuing his 
string of not-cool flicks -- this thriller is more "Before and After" 
than "Reversal of Fortune." The movie is a big disappointment, and yet 
it's somewhat easy to see what motivated such big names to attach 
themselves to it -- the premise is both promising and intriguing. Too 
bad the execution's all wrong, though, because the set-up of "Desperate 
Measures" boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve to be put to 
far better use. </P>
<P>San Francisco cop Frank Connor (Garcia) is a single parent with a 
troubling dilemma -- his son Matt (Joseph Cross) is stricken with cancer 
which only a bone marrow transplant can push into remission. Even worse, 
the only compatible donor is violent sociopath Peter McCabe (Michael 
Keaton), currently serving a life sentence for multiple murders and 
other various crimes against society. Connor tries his best to convince 
McCabe to go along with the surgery; he's at first reluctant, but 
reconsiders after he realizes he can plan his escape at the hospital. 
When he does make a run for it, Connor offers close pursuit, but for 
different reasons than his superiors (including the crusty Brian Cox) -- 
they want to take McCabe down, while Connor needs to keep him alive, or 
all hope is lost for his little boy. </P>
<P>One misstep "Desperate Measures" makes is in its underdevelopment of 
Matt's illness. What's needed are more details as to exactly why McCabe 
is the only bone marrow match that works; there would seem to be other 
possible contenders somewhere in the country, and thus many of the ways 
that Connor endangers the lives of himself and those around him by 
attempting to keep McCabe alive are just a little too hard to swallow. 
Take, for example, a scene where McCabe is trying to make a getaway by 
climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting two sections of the 
hospital. The police have their spotlight and guns aimed right on him, 
and what does Connor do? He shoots the spotlight out so that McCabe can 
continue his flight. Connor knows very well what dangerous deeds this 
guy is capable of, and yet never seems to think that McCabe will 
eventually get to and try to harm his son. Whatever. </P>
<P>To be fair, though, the lack of story background is the least of the 
movie's problems. First and foremost is how cheaply "Desperate Measures" 
trades the potential of it's opening scenes for the routine action 
ballistics of its final hour. Once McCabe escapes, the film becomes The 
Fugitive in reverse and with no thrills. There are countless scenes 
where the good guys catch up to Keaton only to have him grab a hostage 
and get away. Also, the movie is so intent on giving you a 
hoot-inducing, lip-smacking villain (the ads have compared Peter McCabe 
to Hannibal Lechter, natch) that it completely casts Garcia's Frank 
Connor by the Dullsville wayside; "Desperate Measures" appears to like 
its antagonist so much more than its protagonist, and the movie's 
head-scratcher of a send-off confirms this. </P>
<P>There is some good to be found amongst this mess, particularly in the 
acting department. Cast against type, Michael Keaton's understated 
menace is highly effective. Although he's not given much believable to 
work with, Andy Garcia plays off a taut emotional chord. Joseph Cross, 
as Garicia's ailing son, is surprisingly unsentimental, and Marcia Gay 
Harden lends solid support as a doctor who becomes a major player in the 
unfolding chaos. This cast does its best to camouflage the sorry plot as 
it chugs towards an inevitably happy ending, but most is lost. It goes 
without saying that "Desperate Measures" needs an operation of its very 
own. </P>
