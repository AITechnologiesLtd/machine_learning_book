THEY CALL IT SPRING
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Hervé Le Roux's THEY CALL IT SPRING (ON APPELLE ÇA...  LE PRINTEMPS) is 
like some Super Bowls -- the interruptions are by far and away the best 
parts.  In the case of the Super Bowl, the interruptions come in the 
form of commercials, but in the female buddy comedy THEY CALL IT SPRING, 
the narrative is broken by humorous musical interludes, usually sung in 
the two and three-part harmonies and rounds.  These musical ditties have 
about as much in common with the storyline as a dot-com ad does with 
football, but they are so much fun that you won't care.  The best of 
these musical numbers has three guys dressed like 18th century French 
dandies, complete with long cream-colored coats, shoes and lace.</P>
<P>Manu (Marilyne Canto), Fanfan (Maryse Cupaiolo) and Joss (Marie 
Matheron) are three women who find themselves temporarily homeless 
together after arguments with their significant others.  After sharing 
the friendship of various adventures, they begin to plot revenge on the 
men in their lives, using every technique from swapping the hot and cold 
water lines to tar-and-feathering.  Sharing little of the originality of 
the musical numbers, the comedy serves adequately to mark time until the 
charming songfest resumes.</P>
<P>THEY CALL IT SPRING runs 1:47.  The film is in French with English 
subtitles.  It is not rated but might be PG-13 for brief nudity and 
would be acceptable for kids around 12 and up.</P>
