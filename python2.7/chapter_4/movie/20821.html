<PRE>"Streak" of Satisfaction
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>If you've seen "Beverly Hills Cop" or "Lethal Weapon"
or any of a dozen other cop/buddy/comedy movies, then
you probably know that all of these films follow a
very similar recipe:</P>
<P>Add 1 overzealous and reckless character that doesn't
quite fit in;
Add 1 subdued or perpetually naive partner;
Make sure one person is black and the other white;
Include at least two scenes of cars traveling
death-defyingly fast;
Liberally sprinkle bullets during the finale; and
Voila!</P>
<P>"Blue Streak" does not veer from this recipe, but
despite the cookie-cutter plot, what really makes or
breaks these kinds of movies for me is the energy
level of the main character.  And surprisingly (I say
surprisingly because I had low expectations for this
film), Martin Lawrence shows that he has the charisma
and the vigor to keep this movie breezing along.  </P>
<P>Lawrence actually isn't a police officer in this film.
 Well, not at first anyway.  He's Miles Logan, who is
quite an accomplished thief.  With his team of fellow
thieves and a plethora of high-tech equipment, he
easily enters the most secure buildings while
bypassing the most sophisticated alarm systems.  The
film's beginning is a fairly well-executed sequence
where Logan scurries his way into a building with the
ultimate goal of stealing a $17 million diamond.  By
disabling a key security monitor, stealthily hiding
behind furniture, and utilizing an array of thieving
tools that could probably also defuse a nuclear
warhead, he successfully captures his prize.  But his
jubilation will be short-lived.  Police have arrived
and the driver of the getaway car has sped off. 
Meanwhile, one of his men, Deke (                     
       ),  turns on him.  He wants the diamond for
himself.  Logan manages to barely escape from Deke to
a nearby construction site.  But the police are
closing in.  He quickly hides the diamond inside of an
air conditioning duct before being arrested.</P>
<P>Two years elapse, and when he's finally released from
prison, he revisits the site of his precious diamond. 
Unfortunately, he learns that the new building houses
the Los Angeles Police Department.  Security is tight
and the place is teeming with officers.  There's no
way for him to just stroll in and to start crawling
through the ventilation system.  His plan is simple. 
Steal a security access pass; forge identification;
and walk on in and retrieve the jewel.  Well, two out
of three ain't bad.  Unfortunately, he is mistaken for
a new transfer and is immediately dispatched on a
case.  To make matters worse, he is paired with a
rookie partner (an affable Luke Wilson) who always
drives the speed limit and stops when the traffic
light changes yellow.</P>
<P>Logan will have to solve the case his own way, using
his acquired street smarts and thieving background, in
order to speed his return back to the police
department.  He does impressively well as a man of the
law, and his unorthodox manner and tactics draw praise
from his colleagues.  But this attention can only
endanger his true identity.  Meanwhile, he is given
more dangerous assignments and by now, Deke has
reappeared to track Logan down for the diamond.  "Blue
Streak" may not break any new ground, but I was
pleasantly surprised at how well the movie held
together.  This is one of those rare times where the
actual film is much better than the previews had led
me to believe.  I also enjoyed Lawrence's performance
who is likeably glib.  The movie moves along at a
brisk pace and despite Lawrence's reputation as a
sometimes-crass comic, the film is appropriately rated
PG-13 for some mild gunplay.  With so many mediocre
thrillers and dramas in the theatres, this film makes
a fine Saturday afternoon choice.</P>
