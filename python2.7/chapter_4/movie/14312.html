<PRE>Dance With Me (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Mark O'Hara</PRE>
<P>Just as The Color of Money taught us the jargon of billiards, and 
Rounders instructed us in the vocabulary of poker, Dance With Me makes 
us literate in the field of Latin dancing.  It's the feel of  being 
inside this specialized community that drives the narrative of the film.</P>
<P>Assisted by extraordinary choreography and editing, the dance scenes 
occupy a good amount of the 126-minute running time.  Their motion and 
grace pass the time easily.  We witness first the informal abandon in 
the bar in Santiago de Cuba, the hometown of Rafael Infante (Chayanne).  
Soon afterwards, we are in a Texas dance studio, the walls mirrored, the 
floor crossed and re-crossed by dancers giving lessons or practicing for 
the big-time competitions to be held shortly in Las Vegas.  The 
competitions provide some of the most interesting and tension-filled 
moments.  Finally, the scenes shot in dance clubs, reminiscent of the 
early Cuba footage, highlight the conflict that sparks the film's 
romantic subplot.  Ruby Sinclair (Vanessa L. Williams) practices 
routines that are ostensibly Latin in design, painstaking in 
choreography - but that lack the music-driven insouciance of the real 
thing.</P>
<P>Williams is a remarkable dancer.  From her drills in the studio to her 
twirls before the judges, she shows off her accomplishment.  She is 
quite likable in the role, even when we discover that she is a single 
mom who is quietly determined to do what is best for her son Peter.  
This family situation is one of many cliches in the plot;  it is 
forgivable, though, because Williams acts so naturally.  Particularly 
riveting are her facial expressions as she dances:  one thinks of 
Michael Jordan,  tongue out and eyes wide, pivoting and darting with 
stunning sureness.  Williams' presence onscreen guarantees the viewer's 
interest.</P>
<P>Her character's relationship with Rafael builds slowly.  She picks him 
up at the bus station and takes him to the studio, which is owned by the 
man who is apparently Rafael's father.  Working as a handyman, Rafael 
slowly becomes part of the family of employees of the studio.  What 
takes Ruby a while to find out is that Rafael can dance extremely well - 
just not how she is trying to instruct him how to dance.  Perhaps 
Rafael's most charming scene has him stranded on a lawn just as the 
sprinklers activate;  here Chayanne does a hopping and stomping routine 
that nods at Gene Kelly, the simulated rain bringing out his love of 
life.  Like Williams, Chayanne does his own dancing, including the body 
language that helps to show his passion.</P>
<P>Kris Kristofferson plays John Burnett, who for over 20 years has run the 
studio and competed in the international competitions.  Although 
Kristofferson is not convincing as a dancer - he really dances in only 
one scene, and it's generic ballroom - he does a credible job as an 
aloof but likable aging man.  It's his situation as a sudden father, and 
Rafael's reaction to the resulting behavior, which constitutes the 
unforgivable cliché in the work.  The supporting studio dancers and 
students are quirky and well-sketched.   There's Stefano (William 
Marquez), the older instructor who plays his ego for laughs;  there's 
Lovejoy (Beth Grant), the seeming manager of the place;  and there's Bea 
(Joan Plowright), Stefano's student, who steals the camera whenever it 
is pointed at her.</P>
<P>Most of the picture's dialogue is believable.  Once, though, Rafael 
utters the sentiment, "I'm Cuban, of course I can dance."  And there are 
a few too-long pauses, which caused me to doubt the adage, "If you can't 
say something nice, don't say anything at all."  Sometimes it's better 
to say what regular people would say, even it's meaningless.</P>
<P>Why should a viewer sit through Dance With Me and maybe even rent it 
upon video's release?  Because of the acting, pleasing to look at.  
Because of the music, fast and relentless.  Most of all, because of the 
dancing, which does for the viewer what a good book does for a reader:  
transports her for a time into another, fascinating world.</P>
