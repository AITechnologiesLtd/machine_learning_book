Written and directed by Anthony Minghella, and based on Patricia
Highsmith's novel, The Talented Mr. Ripley is a psychological thriller
of jealousy and confused identity among the privileged classes. Tom
Ripley (Matt Damon) is paid by a wealthy businessman to persuade his
wayward layabout son Dickie (Jude Law) to return home from Europe. Tom
travels to Italy, meets Dickie and girlfriend Marge (Gwyneth Patrow) and
is soon sharing their bohemian tourist lifestyle, but the friendships
formed are not all they seem and soon come under strain. </P>
<P>The film is deliberate but compelling, its restrained pace punctuated by
a couple of moments of extreme violence, including one of the most
effective screen murders I've ever seen. The best aspect of the film,
though, is Matt Damon's magnificent performance as the scheming and
manipulative but strangely pathetic Tom Ripley, whose talent, and
compulsion, is to take on the identity of those around him. This is not
an easy role to have taken on and was a very brave choice for an actor
with a career as a pretty-boy movie star ahead of him. Such actors might
be tempted to rebelliously take on a role against type, such as Leo de
Caprio's rumoured but abandoned casting as the killer in American
Psycho. Damon's role here is that of a subtle and sympathetic monster,
something much more difficult and carried off brilliantly.</P>
<P>With The English Patient, Anthony Minghella was likened to David Lean.
Such comparisons with great British film-makers seem not to have
irritated Minghella, because The Talented Mr. Ripley shouts its
Hitchcock influences from the rooftops. Apart from its Hitch-like plot
and themes, the film's original score, by Gabriel Yared, is frankly
little more than a Bernard Herrmann pastiche (although if you're going
to copy anyone, you might as well copy the best). Some trademark
Hitchcock shots are used, as when the viewpoint rotates as we close in
on a tormented character from above, and when the camera travels over
the heads of a formally-attired opera audience to tightly frame the main
character in one of the boxes with the Yared/Herrmann score driving the
allusion home. Even the opening credits have a similar look to the
distinctive credits created for Hitchcock by Saul Bass.</P>
<P>The current fashion is for long films - it seems that nobody thinks a
film less than two hours long will be taken seriously. At 139 minutes,
The Talented Mr. Ripley drags occassionally and could have been more
effective if it was half an hour shorter. Hitchcock famously once said
that the length of a film should be directly related to the endurance of
the human bladder. If his bladder could have taken the strain, he would
have been proud of Ripley. (8/10)</P>
