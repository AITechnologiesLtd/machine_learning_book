<PRE>                             MADAME BUTTERFLY
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>Puccini's opera has never had a more beautiful, more loving, more
touching production than Martin Scorsese's presentation, directed by
Frederic Mitterand.</P>
<P>It is the late 1800s when the tall, handsome American, Captain
Pinkerton (Richard Troxell), arrives in Japan on the warship, the
Abraham Lincoln.   He rents a house in Nagasaki for 999 years as it
cannot be sold.  However, as he remarks to the American consul,
Sharpless (Richard Cowan), the lease can be broken at any time.    This
comes to mind when Goro (Jing-Ma Fan), a matchmaker, arranges a
marriage between Cio-Cio-San and Pinkerton.   Apparently, marriages can
as easily be broken.    In the end we see that Pinkerton thought of his
lovely bride as if she were a delightful toy.</P>
<P>The lovely Chinese actress-singer, Ying Huang, brings to the screen all
the hope and heartache that is experienced by Cio-Cio-San,   Ying's
every emotion, every smile, every movement of her face signals her
feelings.  It is we, the audience, who are so moved because we know
that she will be enduring great disappointment as her hopes are dashed
when Pinkerton, after 3 years back in the States, returns to Japan with
his American wife . . . while I had all I could do to gulp and keep
back my tears even though I have heard the opera many times.</P>
<P>This Madame Butterfly is a great movie.  Every character, including the
maid, Suzuki (Ning Liang), is perfect.  All are known in the world of
opera for their fine voices.  Unlike in most operas I have seen on the
stage, these singers can also act up a storm . . . and they do.</P>
<P>Ying Huand is a graduate of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music and has
performed in many cities of the world.  Richard Troxell, too, is world
renowned, as are Ning Liang and Richard Cowan.</P>
