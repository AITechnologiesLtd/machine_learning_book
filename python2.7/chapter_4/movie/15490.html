<PRE>Phantoms
A Review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Peter O'Toole; Rose McGowan; Joanna Going & Ben Affleck</P>
<P>Phantoms is a very pleasant surprise. I have to admit that I wasn't really
expecting very much from this horror film based on the Dean Koontz story.
Two sisters return to a small northwest town to find it apparently deserted.
Although they soon discover that the town isn't deserted but that everyone
has been killed by someone or something. They also realize that the same
thing that killed everyone has also trashed the engine in their car so that
they are unable to leave the town. It turns out that not everyone is dead,
and the two sisters are joined by a few members of the local sheriff's
department who were out on a call when the carnage ensued, and avoided being
killed. Unfortunately, whatever killed the rest of the town intends to make
sure that they don't stay alive very long. I can't say a whole lot about the
thing doing the killing in this film without giving too much away, so lets
just say the audience is kept guessing throughout most of the film.</P>
<P>While Phantoms was better than expected, I wasn't really expecting a whole
lot. The movie was not incredibly scary, but it was fun to watch. The cast
was the usual assortment of attractive young actors including some names
that you may actually be familiar with. These include Liev Shreiber and Rose
McGowan (both were in Scream) and Joanna Going who isn't a big name yet, but
my money says she will be. Rounding out the cast was Ben Affleck who made
this film before going on to win an Academy Award for Good Will Hunting. All
gave pretty good performances, at least as good as you can expect from a
horror film. Although I won't knock the writing too much since it was penned
by horror master Dean Koontz who knows a good scare when he sees one. The
production values are high and the special effects are stylish, if not
overly spectacular.</P>
<P>The idea behind phantoms is a good one, and it comes across on the screen
fairly well. Phantoms is a good choice for a little scare, just don't rent
it expecting it to become you new favorite movie.</P>
