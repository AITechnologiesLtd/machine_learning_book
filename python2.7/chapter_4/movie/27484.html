<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A made for TV movie that looks and feels like a made for TV movie (it
was stale). It's entertaining ala Columbo style, as the last scene has
all the suspects in the morgue and the cop, Lou Corbin (Robert Culp),
plays a trick on the murderer to get a confession, just like they do it
on TV when they wrap up a case. Since I wasn't held in suspense, I
instead turned my attention on guessing who did it, using my conditioned
experiences from watching such TV shows, therefore I knew it wouldn't be
the most obvious one. I did guess who it was about half way through on a
hunch, since the plot didn't leave much in clues. Instead, it tried many
different twists to throw you off, giving all the suspects a reason for
doing the killing. I hate to be a killjoy, but that, unfortunately, was
the only enjoyment I got out of the film.</P>
<P>The film opens as a blonde woman is being slashed to death with a pair
of shears by an unseen assailant. Set in a city hospital, the film pays
homage to soap operas like General Hospital, as in numerous scenes a
patient is seen watching the unnamed soap opera, as is the bartender
where the doctors hangout, Rosie (Ann Wedgeworth). Dr. Paul Trenton
(John Rubinstein) is the head of pathology at the hospital; his
overbearing widow mother is a doctor at the same hospital; Dr. Max
Heller (Stephen Macht) is the poor boy with ambition who worked his way
through med school to his position as a heart surgeon and is best
friends with the wealthy Trentons. Max is an arrogant playboy and
pictured as a  surgeon of questionable skills; and, then there is Laury
Medford (Kim Basinger), the gorgeous trophy wife that both Paul and Max
are seemingly after. Her father is the chairman of the hospital board,
which bodes well career-wise for whichever doctor lands her, as he's in
a position to help both move up the ladder.</P>
<P>At the bar, Paul learns that Laury, his lifelong friend and the one his
mother compulsively wants him to marry, has just become engaged to Max.
When Paul's mother finds out that he's about to lose her, she goads him
to let her help in getting Laury back. Paul is determined to be his own
man and tells his mother to mind her own business.</P>
<P>Sneakily, Paul has Laury receive a letter addressed to Max from his
secret lover, Joy Morgan, one in which she wrote to him about their love
and enclosed in it the key to her house. Paul wrote the letter and made
sure Laury got it, in order to get Laury's attention that her future
husband spends the night with a girlfriend the night he proposes to her.
This upsets Laury and she goes with Paul to Joy's house and finds
evidence that Max and Joy knew each other. Lou Corbin tails them,
suspicious that the missing travel agent Joy Morgan, someone he once
dated before she broke it off to date a doctor, is a victim of foul
play. Corbin meets individually with all the suspects and only discloses
that he's a cop after his investigation is in its final stages.</P>
<P>It made for a forgettable film, one that was probably intended as a
pilot for a possible TV series. I saw it on the Mystery Channel at 3 in
the morning, when I was suffering from insomnia after a particularly
grueling day. The B-film left a warm spot in my heart, as it cured my
insomnia without me using a sleeping pill and having to worry about side
effects.</P>
