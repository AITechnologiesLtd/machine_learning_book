Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.</P>
<P>     If ever a film begged -- nay _pleaded_ -- to be a mini-series, that
film is DEEP IMPACT.  The first of this year's Large Celestial Object on a
Collision Course with Earth films (soon to be followed by ARMAGEDDON)
begins with the discovery of a comet which appears to be heading straight
for us.  Flash forward a year to an ambitious young MSNBC reporter named
Jenny Lerner (Tea Leoni) who stumbles onto the story which the government
has kept under wraps for fear of causing a panic.  The President of the
United States (Morgan Freeman) finally makes the comet's existence public
at the same time he announces a plan to send an experimental spacecraft
called the Messiah on a mission to deflect the comet from its trajectory.
Flash forward another few months to the Messiah crew, including retired
astronaut Spurgeon Tanner (Robert Duvall) completing their mission with
less than ideal success.  Flash forward another few months as a plan to
save humanity by hiding a million people in underground caves is set in
motion.</P>
<P>     That's enough flashing to give you the disorienting sensation of
sitting through a cinematic strobe light.  DEEP IMPACT wants to be a
heroic disaster epic, examining the effect of impending devastation on
individual people and their relationships, but that can only happen if we
get to know the characters a little.  Every one of DEEP IMPACT's sub-plots
feels forced into a chunk of time far too small to do it justice.  The
central romance, involving a pair of high school sweethearts (Elijah Wood
and Leelee Sobieski), makes the leap from tentative hand-holding to
marriage without a single moment of conversation between them, deadening
every supposedly emotional scene.  Leoni's problems with her divorced
parents (Vanessa Redgrave and Maximilian Schell) and the interpersonal
dynamics of the Messiah crew members suffer a similar fate, straining for
an audience response strictly on the basis of composer James Horner's
over-wrought orchestrations.  In fact, it often seems as though every bit
of character interaction has been edited out of DEEP IMPACT except the
tear-filled separations and reunions, leaving little more than a hollow
succession of musical cues.</P>
<P>     That may not be a tremendous surprise when you're dealing with a
big-budget disaster film.  What should come as a surprise is DEEP IMPACT's
disappointing lack of visual energy.  This is one sedate blockbuster,
offering one invigorating set piece of the Messiah mission before settling
into a dull march towards five minutes of destruction.  Every other
opportunity to dazzle is either turned into exposition or ignored
entirely.  The comet's separation into two fragments is explained by the
President using a simple computer graphic, but never depicted; ditto for
an attempted missile strike on the comet.  We never even get to see the
massive underground Ark after a huge narrative build-up.  DEEP IMPACT is
so bereft of spectacle and detail that it's never possible to grasp the
immensity of the impending tragedy, or watch a year of mounting dread
unfold.  In fact, I can't imagine a more absurdly optimistic portrayal of
human reaction to the coming Apocalypse, with the isolated traffic jam and
a few fires being the only intrusion on a general response of beatific
acceptance.  It may be the end of the world as they know it, but they feel
fine.</P>
<P>     DEEP IMPACT boasts such a talented cast -- Duvall, Freeman, Redgrave,
Schell, Charles Martin Smith, James Cromwell -- that occasionally it feels
weightier than the script deserves.  Mimi Leder's direction also offers a
few effective moments, including a montage of reaction shots which
provides more insight than all the dialogue combined.  Most of the time,
however, DEEP IMPACT feels like six hours of raw footage hacked to ribbons
to meet the imperatives of feature film length.  It's not exactly a bad
film; it's just about one-third of an acceptably engrossing one.  If you
want to do justice to an Extinction Level Event, you need the 366 minutes
of 1994's television adaptation of Stephen King's THE STAND.  DEEP
IMPACT's 115 minutes manage to turn a comet strike into a moderate
inconvenience.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 comet tales:  4.</PRE>
