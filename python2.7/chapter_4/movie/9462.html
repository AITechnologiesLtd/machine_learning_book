<PRE>BLUE VELVET (1986)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Writer/Director: David Lynch
Starring: Kyle MacLaughlin, Isabella Rosselini, Dennis Hopper, Laura
Dern, Dean Stockwell</P>
<P>I have a big problem with this film: I don't like it.  I mean, I found
it to be brilliant and all, but it's just not a film I would watch
willingly again.  I know I'm a critic and all, and I'm supposed to like
brilliant films, but I just didn't like this one.  But I'm going to
attempt to give it a very positive review, because it was very good, and
try to find out why I didn't enjoy it.</P>
<P>The film starts off brilliantly: a shot of typical suburbia - kids
crossing the street, firemen waving as they go down the road on their
truck, and a man watering his garden.  But this guy suddenly has a
stroke and collapses to the ground.  As he falls, his dog jumps up and
begins being squirted in the mouth by the hose.  The camera moves down
and we see bugs and stuff in the grass he has been watering.  Like this
first shot, we're going to see what's on the inside of this beautiful
suburbia.</P>
<P>While this wasn't surreally bizarre, we get another weird twist: the
protagonist (Kyle MacLaughlin, who seems to be in almost all of Lynch's
films), who is also the stroke-victim's son,  is walking thorugh a
pasture and finds a severed ear.  That's right - an ear.  He takes it to
the cops, who show little interest in it, so he begins snooping around
like some Encyclopedia Brown, equipped with the one detective's daughter
(a young Laura Dern).  He finds out that there's this woman (Isabella
Rossellini) who may have ties to the ear.</P>
<P>He steals her key while posing as a bug killer, and then sneaks into her
apartment after she sings, you know, "Blue Velvet" at a club.  He hides
in her closet when she comes in, and witnesses a horrific act.  A
gangster in suburbia (Dennis Hopper) comes in, literally swearing every
other word, gets high on some kind of chemical, and proceeds to rape
her.  Of course, he does this every night, so she should be used to it
(just kidding).  He leaves, she finds Kyle, and begins forcing him to
strip, then they have sex.  Soon enough, they have a sado-masichistic
relationship going on.</P>
<P>Of course, Hopper finds out, and takes both of them on a joyride through
the underbelly of suburbia, including some drinking, and a visit to a
brothel, run by the supra-effiminite Dean Stockwell (who Hopper just
calls "fucking suave!" repeatedly).  They then beat him and leave him
for dead, but he's not dead.  And at the end, Kyle has to save
Rossellini and himself from Hopper, in a totally bizarre ending.</P>
<P>What's cool about this film is the contrast it makes between suburbia
and the mafia.  I mean, it's pretty much the perfect front.  And
MacLaughlin's journey through it is pretty fascinating.  Lynch uncovers
suburbia for all its hypocrisies in "Blue Velvet," especially with the
kind of ironic ending.  And another strong point is the cinematography,
which is absolutely gorgeous and dreamlike.  I credit Lynch for his
great directing with this film.</P>
<P>The acting is, however, kind of half and half.  Or really three quarters
and a quarter.  Isabella Rossellini is fantastic, as always, in the role
of the abused lounge singer.  In the most controversial scene, she is
dropped off by the mafia totally stark naked and on Laura Dern's porch. 
Apparently, Lynch didn't restrict anyone from leaving the site, and
Rossellini has been scarred ever since.  Her performance is really
great.  And Dennis Hopper is so fueled with energy (he coins the phrase
used in "Clerks," "I'll fuck anything that moves!") and he becomes the
perfect hatable bully.  Also great is Laura Dern.</P>
<P>But Kyle MacLaughlin.  I mean, the guy's nice and all, and he has acted
well in some parts of his career.  But here, like in most of his work,
he's just not good.  There's this scene where he talks about Guiness
beer where I swore he would turn to the camera and promote it.  That's
how corny he sounded.  He's just not a very good lead for a brilliant
film.  But he somehow is in a lot of Lynch's work.  I don't get it.</P>
<P>This film is probably one of the more weird films I've ever seen.  I
pretty much didn't like it because, well, I saw it in the prime of my
"Pulp Fiction" obsession.  I was expecting some pulp.  But the thing is,
I'm just not a huge fan of Lynch.  I mean, I appreciate the guy, and I
often rave about him.  But I just don't always enjoy his flicks.  Oh
well.</P>
<P>Roger Ebert famously gave this one star.  I agree with some of his
review, but I get the point Lynch was trying to make.  Suburbia is not a
place to escape the problems of the world, because there's an underbelly
to every microcosm.  Even if I didn't like it, I can appreciate it.</P>
