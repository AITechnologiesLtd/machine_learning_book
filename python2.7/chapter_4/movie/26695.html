<PRE>CHARLIE'S ANGELS
----------------</PRE>
<P>With so many big screen adaptations of old television shows falling flat,
the "Charlie's Angels" project sounded dubious except for one important
factor - Drew Barrymore.  Barrymore is a likeable young actress and a
proven producer ("Never Been Kissed") and she succeeds once again
with this project.</P>
<P>Written by Ryan Rowe ("Tapeheads"), Ed Solomon ("Men In Black") and
John August ("Go"), this "Charlie's Angels" keeps the TV show basics intact
while tweaking it with good-natured tongues in cheeks.  The film kicks
off parodying "Mission Impossible 2" in as high-flying a manner as any
Bond opening, while getting a joke in at the expense of "T.J. Hooker:  
the Movie."  Then we're introduced to the three angels as widely different 
children.  Natalie's (Cameron Diaz) a brace wearing, girlie girl who loves 
Soul Train.  Alex (Lucy Liu) is a silver-spooned equestrian.  Dylan 
(Barrymore) is a smoking-in-the-girls'-room rebellious orphanned teen.</P>
<P>Back in current times, the three are assembled by Bosley (Bill Murray) to
get their assignment from Charlie (uncreditted voice of John Forsythe,
the original Charlie).  Eric Knox (Sam Rockwell, "Galaxy Quest"), a 
nerdy software magnate, has been kidnapped.  His partner Vivian Wood (Kelly
Lynch, "Drugstore Cowboy"), fingers Roger Corwin (Tim Curry) as an enemy
while the Angels identify a slick flunky in the kidnapping tape as the
Thin Man (Crispen Glover, "Nurse Betty").  They then begin their pursuit
of the bad guy(s) masquerading as beautiful party women, belly dancers,
Bavarian yodellers and office efficiency experts.  They also all pursue
romance - Natalie with bartender Pete (Luke Wilson, a Barrymore ex and
former costar "Home Fries"), Alex with action star Jason (Matt LeBlanc,
TV's "Friends") and Dylan with Knox himself (while flirting with Chad,
Barrymore's new husband Tom Green) - while maintaining their covers.</P>
<P>The story is lightweight, but features plenty of action (all Matrix style
and well exaggerated) and lots of goofy humor (slo-mo shots of hair being
'flipped').  Only Alex' romance with LeBlanc and Barrymore's indulgent
inclusion of Tom Green bog the film down.</P>
<P>Acting is fun all around with Diaz shining brightest as the excessively
cheerful, completely ditzy Natalie.  Liu struts her femme fatale stuff.
Barrymore keeps her costars more front-and-center, yet still makes her
own mark playing a woman scorned.  Sam Rockwell hits broad comedic high
notes in two very different modes while the ever reliable Murray settles
for slapstick (and a great prison parody sequence).  Tim Curry is
underutilized, but fine while he's on screen.  Crispen Glover resembles
a deranged Steed from "The Avengers."</P>
<P>Costume and art direction harkens back to the mod 70's time period while 
still being current while effects are sometimes given a little appropriate
cheese factor.  The soundtrack is stuffed with everything from oldies 
from Jimi Hendrix to more recent tunes from Pizzicato Five.  "Charlie's 
Angels" may seem a tad overlong at 92 minutes, but it mostly flies across 
the screen with good-natured giddiness.</P>
