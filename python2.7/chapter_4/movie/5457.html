<PRE>                                    SWITCH
                       A film review by Dan Navarro
                        Copyright 1996 Dan Navarro</PRE>
<P>Blake Edwards' "Switch" -- a "Message Movie" for the '90s </P>
<P>        Have you ever wished for a modern movie that could deliver a strong, 
uplifting spiritual message without being boring?  Once upon a time, 
Hollywood could accomplish that feat with ease.  But in today's 
sex-and-sensationalism market, films with spiritual themes are mocked, 
patronized, or even worse, ignored.  That's why Blake Edwards' 1991 comedy 
"Switch" (Warners-HBO Films) is such a serendipitous find:  A bawdy 
rib-tickler with ribald humor aplenty, yet one that delivers the spiritual 
goods along with the comedic ones.</P>
<P>        To be sure, the fabled Edwards raunch is intact in "Switch".  The 
film is sexy, funny, and cheerfully vulgar, with enough Rabelaisian humor to 
fuel a Joe Bob Briggs special.  But there is a sweetness here also, a frank 
admission that some things are more important than animal appetites, for 
example the salvation of one's soul.  Against all odds, "Switch" not only 
delivers that message, but does it in a positive, exhilarating way that 
rivals the best work of Preston Struges and Frank Capra.</P>
<P>        In "Switch"'s opening reel, a smug chauvinist named Steve (Perry 
King) is murdered by three women who once loved him.  Steve's soul descends 
into purgatory, where he is informed by God that he cannot gain admission to 
Heaven until he atones for his many offenses against womankind.  So Steve is 
returned to Earth for his second chance, with the admonition that he cannot 
enter Heaven until he finds one female who likes him.  To make things 
tougher, the womanizing Steve is reincarnated as Amanda (Ellen Barkin), a 
woman with the sort of dynamite body that has been Steve's lifelong 
playground. </P>
<P>        To this point, you may sense a preachy feminist tale brewing, a 
cinematic lecture on how women think men ought to behave.  But Edwards has 
other fish to fry.  What ensues is a comedic tour-de-force by Barkin, who is 
splendidly funny as a man trying to cope inside a woman's body.  She wobbles 
shakily on stiletto heels, struggles to sit demurely in short skirts, and 
suffers a storm of sexual confusions when confronted with Steve's former 
girlfriends.  Even when Amanda is with a genuinely nice guy (Jimmy Smits), 
she cannot warm up to him, because inside she still thinks like a man.</P>
<P>        But the comedy is being played out against a deadly serious bass 
motif, the struggle for Steve/Amanda's immortal soul.  Satan wants it too, 
and he appears to Amanda with an offer to release her from her tortured 
existence, if she will consent to join him forever in Hell.  Horrified, she 
refuses.  But she knows, and we know too, that her time is growing short; for 
after weeks of searching, she has failed to find one female who likes her in 
either incarnation.</P>
<P>        In the early 1940s, Preston Sturges' seriocomedy "Sullivan's Travels" 
told the story of a man who is thrust into a world completely alien to his 
own, but a world in which he learns truths that would enrich his life 
forever.  Frank Capra's superb "It's a Wonderful Life" (1946) used the same 
idea in a different way, creating an epiphany that has made that movie a 
perennial favorite, one of the most loved films of all time.</P>
<P>        Unlike the Sturges and Capra heroes, "Switch"'s protagonist is no 
innocent, but an unrepentant heel suddenly challenged by fate to amend his 
miserable life.  But this is precisely what makes the message even stronger. 
All souls are equally precious to God, are they not?  Because "Switch" is a 
comedy, it does not seem unfair to disclose that in the end, the redeemed 
sinner does, indeed, gain admission to Paradise.  But the resolution that 
triggers this happy ending is a wondrous twist, a plot element strikingly 
outside the standard routine of modern sex comedies.  For it is nothing less 
than a cogent example of what is meant when people speak of the 
all-conquering love of God.</P>
<P>        Edwards' deus ex machina is no heavenly puppetmaster pulling strings, 
but a benevolent God who helps those who help themselves.  Seek and you shall 
find.  To find that point driven home so forcefully in a '90s sex farce like 
"Switch" is more than surprising, it is miraculous.  Sturges and Capra would 
have approved.</P>
