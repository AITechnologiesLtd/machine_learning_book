<PRE>XIU XIU: THE SENT DOWN GIRL (TIAN YU)</PRE>
<PRE> Reviewed by Harvey Karten, Ph.D.

 Cast: Lu Lu, Lopsong</PRE>
<P>   On the surface, "Xiu Xiu" emulates a fable, a legend,
though in fact the novella "Tian Yu" on which the film is
based was inspired by the experiences of a woman known by
the writer, Yan Geling.  Look just a bit below the surface and
you'll find that this story--which centers almost exclusively on
the relationship of two people from different cultures and
generations--is one of the most scathing indictments of
Chinese Communism yet filmed.  Taking place during the
waning days of the Cultural Revolution (1967-1976), the tale
illustrates that even during this period of the most intensely
communistic strivings of the People's Republic, your future
could well be determined by money, family influence, and
connections in the right places.  Wherever Communism has
taken root, the people have received far greatest promises
than any government could realize.  By bringing this concept
down to a simple tale that focuses on a 15-year-old girl who
comes of age during a period of particular upheaval in
contemporary China, Shanghai-born director Joan Chen
effectively dramatizes the lies and depravity endemic to that
country's political system.</P>
<P>   The story is narrated by a passionate admirer of the
principal character (Luoyong Wang), who is sadly taking
leave of his young girl friend Wenxiu, nicknamed Xiu Xiu (Lu
Lu).  An innocent resident of the city of Chengdu, she has
been promised a job as a leader of the prestigious girls' Iron
Cavalry, an appointment which would presumably be
awarded after a one year's training program at hard labor
followed by a six months' assignment to a remote region
bordering Tibet.  At the Spartan training camp, the only
entertainment for the youthful participants is an occasional
black-and-white propaganda movie, concluding with a song in
which the entire audience joins.  To Xiu Xiu's surprise, she is
ultimately sent down to a barren, isolated land to work the
horses with a twenty-year veteran horse herder, Lao Jin
(Lopsang), known far and wide as a man who had been
castrated during a Tibetan uprising and who therefore poses
no threat of improper conduct with the girl.  </P>
<P>   At the conclusion of the six months' assignment--during
which time she has become fond of the much older man who
treats her gently and who has obviously been taken by her
innocent charms--she is eager to return to the bustling
Chengdu, but no such luck.  Nobody comes to pick her up
and give her the documents she needs to live there. Instead,
a number of individuals pass through, claiming the ability to
help her get the residence permits in return for her sexual
favors.  She quickly loses her innocence and her modesty,
while the unhappy Lopsang is impotent to come to her aid. 
ULtimately Lopsang, the only person outside her own family
to care for her, grants her the peace she so earnestly seeks.</P>
<P>   Because "Xiu Xiu" is brutally critical of the Communist
system, we can be sure the film will not be shown in her own
country.  Filmed by Ms. Chen without a permit, its crew
worked in remote regions of Tibet, regularly moving to avoid
the authorities.  The movie was shipped out where the work
was honored in Taipei by sweeping seven Golden Horse
(Oscar) awards, including best picture, director, actor,
actress, screenplay, song and music.  Selected in the U.S.
for festivals at Fort Lauderdale, Telluride, San Francisco and
Hawaii, "Xiu Xiu" effectively satirizes utopian regimes by
highlighting a girl who is innocent, optimistic and trusting until
the system turns the despairing young person into a whore. 
In the title role, the seventeen-year-old Lu Lu projects
unsullied naivete, her first-rate performance impressively
converting her into a desperately unhappy, exploited woman. 
Director Chen is so adept at her job that she is able to show
the seething that influences every muscle of the impotent Lao
Jin's body while simultaneously depicting the playful
chemistry that sheaths a genuine chemistry between these
two people.  Ironically, an American can expect to pay $6,000
to tour the very regions highlighted by Yue Lu's dramatic
photography, an area so stifling to the film's principal
character that she would sooner die than endure another
month.</P>
