<P>   When you're young, the worst thing that can happen to you
is to be a misfit: to be shunned by fellow students in your
junior high or high school.  Todd Solondz's "Welcome to the
Dollhouse" brings this out better than any other American
movie about 12-year-old kids.  Then in that writer-director's
astonishing "Happiness," Solondz portrays the disastrous
effects of being a nerd right in the opening scene, with Jon
Lovitz playing the hapless cipher who has just been given his
walking papers by his 30-year-old date.  But what about the
young people who are accepted by their peers, who have a
lot going for them in their own, supportive circles?  Director
Eric Bross interprets the lives of a clique of people in their
early twenties, working-class stiffs who appear to have no
emotional maladjustments, but who get into a mess because 
the ambitions of one of their number outclass his background. 
"Ten Benny" is a low-budget job that has made the rounds of
the indie circuit in L.A. and Sundance, a small picture
featuring earnest acting but one which leaves the viewer
unsatisfied.</P>
<P>   Its overriding problem is a lack of transcendence.  In laying
out a misadventure that befalls its principal figure, Eric Bross--
who wrote the screenplay with Tom Cudworth--introduces a
story that has the stamp or autobiography.  Bross, who states
in the production notes that he knows people just like the
ones in his movie, shows us a slice of life which has no
surprises, little tension, and is deficient in originality.  It is an
inconsequential tale that makes for a somewhat involving 98
minutes, largely because the young performers play decent
sorts of guys-next-door who get into a jam because of their
inexperience with the hard rules of the fast-money world.  Ray
(Adrien Brody) does not really crave a life of glamour and
fame but wants only to attain normal, working-class goals of
marriage, family, and a measure of financial stability.  Though
he has not gone through the rite of passage needed for
success in today's world--four years of college--he has the gift
of gab and can sell people things that they never knew they
wanted.  Why he did not put his talent to work in pushing
more than shoes is anybody's guess.</P>
<P>   The story takes place in suburban New Jersey with a stint
in Atlantic City and involves Ray's plans to make big bucks
fast in order to get his girl friend Joanne (Sybil Temchen) a
diamond ring and set himself up in his own business.  Getting
a tip on a race at the trotters in the town of Freehold, he
borrows $10,000 from a loan shark he has known since
childhood, Donny (James E. Moriarty) but is staggered by the
failure of the horse to come through for him.  Threatened by
the hoodlum should Ray fail to come up with the money--
surely not an innovative idea for a film--Ray faces a bleak
future, his relationship with his girl threatened by a night of
passion she has with Ray's best friend, Mike (Michael
Gallagher).</P>
<P>   While at least one critic who has seen the film when it was
on the festival circuit calls Ray a "charismatic" fellow, a young
De Niro or Pacino, he does no come across as particularly
magnetic or handsome, witty or expressive possessing the
depth such a protege requires.  A droopy-faced character,
Adrien Brody does not inspire his audience to care all that
much about what happens to him, nor do his pals--who are a
typical bunch of suburbanites who celebrate one another's
birthday parties and spend most of their leisure time together-
-offer much in the way of audience curiosity.  Frank Vincent
as the boy's father, Ray Sr., stands out in a relatively small
role, bearing the professionalism and soignee of an
established performer in a movie that is nothing distinctive or
bearing the flavor of a work you could not see any night on
TV.</P>
