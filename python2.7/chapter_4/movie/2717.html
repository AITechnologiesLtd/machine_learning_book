<PRE>                            SPANKING THE MONKEY
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     From the opening scenes between the son, Raymond  Aibelli
(Jeremy Davies), and his father, Tom  (Benjamin Hendrickson), we feel
an immediate empathy for Raymond and a strong distaste for Tom.
Raymond, a college freshman, is met at the airport by his father who
immediately (and all through the film) lays a guilt trip on his son.
Raymond is expecting to do an internship during the summer as a start
toward his ambition to be a doctor but his father tells him that the
mother, Susan (Alberta Watson), has broken her leg in a fall and that
as Tom has to go out of town on business, Raymond will have to take
care of his mother.  Forget about the internship.</P>
<P>     Hendrickson is excellent.  His manner and speech are so earnestly
reasonable and whining that Raymond would have to be an ingrate to say
"No."</P>
<P>     Raymond caters to his mother as she lies helpless in bed.  His
every moment, almost, is at her beck and call.  You can see he is
trapped.  Even when he goes to the bathroom to masturbate (spank the
monkey), he has no peace, the dog sniffing and whining on the other
side of the closed door. When he takes the dog for a walk he meets Toni
(Carla Gallo), a high school senior who starts the ball rolling between
them, only to later report him to her father, a psychiatrist, for his
having been too rough.</P>
<P>     Nothing goes well for Raymond.  He does not take drugs, he is
studious, yet everything seems to conspire against him ... including
his youngish mother who has been neglected by her husband for too
long.  Things begin to happen as the intimacy of carrying her to the
bathroom, helping her shower, massaging her toes and limbs, start to
take on new meaning.</P>
<P>Superbly acted by all, with excellent dialogue by
Writer/Director, David O Russell in his first feature film, make this
a "must see" film.</P>
