<P>Runaway Bride is a Pretty Woman reunion that feels more light and fluffy
than it's predecessor. But, despite it's obvious tone and rather
formulaic script, it still manages to be a crowd-pleaser.</P>
<P>The stars do a great deal to enliven what is actually a sub-par romance.
Richard Gere plays Ike Graham, a USA Today columnist who is desperate
for a story idea. Through an acquaintance in a bar, he discovers
information that could make for interesting reading: a small-town girl
named Maggie Carpenter (Julia Roberts), dubbed as the `runaway bride',
has become notorious for leaving her groom at the alter for a series of
up to 7 or 8 incidents. Graham, rushing to meet the deadline, types up
the column to have it published in the paper the following day.</P>
<P>But the real Maggie Carpenter spots the headline, and does not
appreciate the gross exaggerations that Graham uses in his writing style
(she insists it was only three times that she high-tailed it out of a
wedding). His editor (and ex-wife, played by Rita Wilson) ends up firing
Ike, but a friend (played by Hector Elizondo) offers him another chance
to get his facts straight. And so the big city boy goes off to Hale,
Maryland to investigate the real truth and attempt to express his
apologies to Maggie. Who knows, the two might even fall for each other
in the end......</P>
<P>It was a wise move for director Gary Marshall to return to his romance
roots and try to re-invent his biggest hit. Lately, Marshall has been
lagging seriously behind (I'm pretty sure Exit to Eden didn't make any
Ten Best lists). This reunion with Roberts and Gere should be a
sure-fire hit, and even if the material is recycled scrap, the
presentation is modestly charming and always watchable. Both stars look
pretty enough to single-handedly save any film, no matter how terribly
the script may be constructed.</P>
<P>Runaway Bride is predictable, to say the least, but it has a certain
charm. The supporting cast is made up of largely familiar faces,
including another Pretty Woman vet: Hector Elizondo. Elizondo stole many
scenes in the 1990 film as a courteous hotel owner, and his performance
here is again impressive. Joan Cusack, as Maggie's quirky best friend,
is basically typecast once again and injects a lot of natural humor into
the proceedings. The two lead characters hate each other so much it
seems impossible that they'll end up together. Minimal sparks fly
between Roberts and Gere, but they both turn in believable performances,
even as they are being pushed toward a highly improbable happy ending.</P>
<P>Star power is the glue that holds this film together. The script has all
the regular clichés associated with this kind of film, and reliance on
the lead performances is huge. The set-up has some obvious problems, but
once Runaway Bride gets into a natural flow, it's easy to enjoy. But
please, next time spare us some of the humor associated with Maggie's
perverted grandmother, who explains in detail her disastrous honeymoon
night. This is a light romantic comedy, and a character like hers seems
somewhat out of place.</P>
<P>This is Julia Roberts' second summer romance (the first was Notting
Hill), and she has submitted another charming performance. Still, this
remains Pretty Woman-lite. The PG rating ensures the film is suitable
for family viewing, but it also adds some restrictions. Someone
searching for a sweet escape to the theater could do far worse than
Runaway Bride, if they are in the mood for something fitfully
entertaining but not terribly original. This has been done a dozen times
before, but never with this kind of star charisma.</P>
