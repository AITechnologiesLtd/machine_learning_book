<PRE>A movie review by Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>Oscar-winning actor Daniel Day-Lewis and director Jim Sheridan have
combined their talents on two previous films, 'My Left Foot' (1989 for
which Daniel Day-Lewis won the Best Actor Oscar) and 'In the Name of the
Father' (1993) and these two films have made a powerful impact on the
film industry and Day-Lewis and Sheridan continue their good working
relationship with 'The Boxer'.  The creative mind of director Sheridan
is a dramatic one at best with hardly any comic relief and that's great
to see.  His writing partner Terry George worked with him on 'In the
Name of the Father' and teams up with Sheridan this time to write a film
that once again has it's story line roots in the Irish Republican Army.
'In the Name of the Father' showcased Lewis in a true story as a
wrongfully convicted man sent to prison for fifteen years along with
three others for a bombing they had nothing to do with.  He was accused
of being a member of the IRA in that film and plays a former one in 'The
Boxer.'</P>
<P>Released from prison after 14 years for his actions within the IRA,
Daniel Day-Lewis stars as a boxer who returns to his former
neighbourhood in Belfast and opens a boxing gym and tries to bring peace
to the region by promoting boxing events that will unite Catholics and
Protestants in the entertaining spectacle of it all.  Some of his former
associates within the IRA object to his peace making efforts and
sabotage his actions by connecting them to further the cause of IRA
violence.  In one case a policeman's death is caused by a car bomb
outside the arena on the night of one Day-Lewis' boxing matches,
sparking riots and his boxing gym is burnt to the ground in the mayhem.
All the while this is happening, Day-Lewis is re-uniting with an old
flame (Emily Watson) whom he courted before he was sent away to prison.
She is the wife of an imprisoned IRA man and is raising a young son and
is caught between her feelings for Day-Lewis and he loyalty to marital
fidelity.</P>
<P>'The Boxer' works on many levels.  The film has an incredibly simple
tone and feel to it but is a powerful drama of spinning proportions.  It
has a slow beginning but is one of those films that's to be appreciated
once the entire thing is absorbed.  For a man released from
incarceration, Day-Lewis plays his role in a very low-key manner as a
man who knows he's wasted half his life and is determined to make the
most of things from now on.  There is a constant reference to many of
the character actors in the film who discuss IRA activities on a regular
basis and the secret meetings show dissent within the organization and
the eventual downfall of one of its members in a very violent fashion.</P>
<P>When Neil Jordan made 'The Crying Game' in 1992 to the release of Jim
Sheridan's 'In the Name of the Father' in 1993, there was a cease fire
declared within the IRA after that and although violence has flared up
once again in a few incidents, at least the release of those two films
and their messages of anti-violence caused some movement towards ending
the bloodshed.  Films CAN change things socially and politically.</P>
<P>An art film in every sense of the word, 'The Boxer' is a well-crafted
piece of film making, derived from social statements of the past,
relying on the future in which films like this will continue to thrive
within the community of film lovers who appreciate this sort of thing.</P>
