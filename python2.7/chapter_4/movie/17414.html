<P>PLOT:
One ant living among millions of others doesn't feel right in just following
orders and not thinking for himself all day, and attempts to find more
meaning in his monotonous, everyday humdrum existence.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Competent, adult computer-animated feature from DreamWorks, manages to draw
some great one-liners from star Woody Allen, a few chuckles here and there,
and a semi-interesting story line, but nothing too outstanding. It was also
fun in respect to all of the big names that had voice parts in this film,
but somehow the movie didn't blow me away overall. The special effects were
good, but nothing spectacular, the characters were interesting, but not
fully engaging, and the lack of songs made it feel as though it was missing
a certain "je-ne-sais-quoi". Woody Allen was essentially portraying his
standard, neurotic role that he does in all of his films (he must've
ad-libbed some of his lines) and was damn funny, but it might not be so fun
for people who don't care for his typical, whiny character. Also, I don't
see kids appreciating most of the adult humor laced through this film. The
cute homages to other films like PULP FICTION (7.5/10) and RAMBO (When the
Stallone ant is being interrogated) was also nice, but overall, the movie is
just a passable good time, with some laughs, a lot of big star voices, and a
short running time (about one hour and twenty minutes).</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Woody Allen recorded his part as "Z" in only 5 days.</P>
