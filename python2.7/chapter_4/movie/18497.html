<P>JUST THE TICKET (M).  
(United Artists/NewVision)
Director: Richard Wenk
Stars: Andy Garcia, Andie MacDowell, Richard Bradford, Andre Blank, Irene 
Worth, Elizabeth Ashley, Chris Lemmon, Ron Liebman, Abe Vigoda.</P>
<P>This curiously bland and unsatisfying romantic comedy is
something of a labour of love for co-stars Andy Garcia, who produced
it through his production company, and Andie MacDowell.  Garcia plays
Gary Starke, a ticket scalper who operates on the streets of New York.
His long suffering girl friend Linda (MacDowell) has grown impatient
with his lack of commitment to their relationship and his inability to
follow through in achieving his dreams.  When a chance to go to Paris
to pursue her career as a chef arises she is tempted to jump at the
opportunity.</P>
<P>But Gary has pinned his hope of salvation on one last
desperate roll of the dice.  The Pope is coming to New York to address
the faithful, and Gary is trying to get his hands on what will become
the hottest ticket in town.  Unfortunately, a new, better organised
and more ruthless operator is muscling in on his territory, and Gary's
chances of redemption are fading fast.</P>
<P>Just The Ticket is lumbered from the outset with an
implausible scenario and a pair of central characters that just aren't
likeable enough to warrant the time spent in their company.</P>
<P>Garcia rightfully dominates the film, and brings plenty of
energy to the screen.  Although a normally charismatic and charming
actor, he tries hard to evince some sympathy for his shallow
character.  However, his performance is too mannered, and he never
quite succeeds in winning the audience over.  MacDowell is also rather
bland in a role that gives her too few opportunities to shine.  Just
The Ticket never allows the two performers to develop a rapport, and
this lack of chemistry eventually damns the film.</P>
<P>Writer and first time director Richard Wenk takes a risk by
filming many crucial scenes on the crowded streets of New York.  This
technique brings a sense of energy and realism to the film, although
far too often the passers-by can be seen gazing questioningly into the
camera.</P>
<P>Only a very touching scene between Gary and his mentor Bennie
(Richard Bradford) brings some emotional punch to this rather
pedestrian and laboured effort.  And the only real comic touch comes
when Gary helps Linda cater a dinner for a spoiled rich matron (Irene
Worth).  It's all too little to salvage this patchy and dreary comedy.</P>
<PRE>Unfortunately, this is not such a hot cinematic ticket!
