<P>MAD CITY (Warner Brothers)
Directed by Costa-Gavras
 The feeding frenzy for tidbits about breaking news stories among TV
reporters has become so absurd in recent years that it hardly needs to be
satirized: Just turn on CNN or MSNBC the next time there's a revelation
about the car crash that killed Princess Diana and count how many different
ways they can present the same piece of information. Certainly no media
figures will be stung by the puffball satire "Mad City," which centers
around the circus that develops around a hostage situation in the town of
Madeline, California; though writers Tom Matthews and Eric Williams seem
anxious to take the media to task for their excesses, their screenplay is
more preachy than it is astringent.
 The weak material is unenthusiastically played by Dustin Hoffman
(unimaginative and off-putting as a reporter anxious to recapture his
glamor) and downright badly handled by John Travolta as the laid-off museum
security guard whose attempt to get his job back sets the story in motion.
Trying to put himself in the shoes of a none-too-bright working-class guy,
Travolta often looks like he's auditioning for the part of Lennie in the
next production of "Of Mice and Men." His rambling monologues about his
dreams and disappointments are underscored by music that sounds like it was
lifted from a "Waltons" episode, perhaps in a  futile attempt to make this
caricature seem human.
 "If we do not learn from the past, we are destined to repeat it," notes
museum curator Blythe Danner early on in the film. She might have added "or
at least remake it," since "Mad City" is obviously striving for a "Dog Day
Afternoon"-type atmosphere of delightful/disturbing chaos. But the film
fails as both black-comedy and as slice-of-life drama, and director
Costa-Gavras' attempt at a potent finale is embarassingly heavy-handed: "Mad
City" is a movie straight outta Dullsville.</P>
