<P>     The thing that goes dreadfully wrong with so many twisty-turny
suspense yarns is that they operate under the mis-guided impression that
they need nothing _except_ twists and turns to be engaging, a perfect
example being the recent THE RICH MAN'S WIFE.  It is a variation on the
kind of lazy, cynical film-making which produces action films like
TWISTER, in which the writers and directors hope that they can keep
jerking us around to the point where we don't notice that there aren't any
people in their films.  I expected 2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY to be that kind of
film, yet another hipper-than-thou exercise in violence and vacuity.  But
writer-director John Herzfeld has put together a complex plot in which --
get this -- the characters actually matter, and which has more great roles
for actors than a dozen recent Hollywood films put together.</P>
<P>     The valley in question is Southern California's San Fernando Valley,
where several people will find their lives intertwined.  It begins with a
partnership in crime, as washed-out mobster Dosmo Pizo (Danny Aiello) is
hired by a shady character named Lee (James Spader) to help with a hit.
But it turns out that Lee is not to be trusted, and once the job is done,
Dosmo is forced to hide out with Alan (Greg Cruttwell), an obnoxious art
dealer, and his assistant Susan (Glenne Headly).  Meanwhile, an ambitious
vice cop named Wes (Eric Stoltz) discovers the scene of the crime, as well
as the victim's distraught ex-wife Becky (Teri Hatcher); also involved is
Teddy (Paul Mazursky), a once-promising film-maker now contemplating
suicide.</P>
<P>     There are some aspects of 2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY which are reminiscent
of other recent stabs at hard-boiled avant garde, and for a while they
concerned me.  Yes, there are characters whose defining quirks seem
contrived for effect, like Lee's penchant for giving his victims a minute
on a stopwatch, or Dosmo's uncooperative hair-piece; yes, there are
characters like Wes's on-the-edge partner Alvin (Jeff Daniels) who don't
pay off.  Yet as John Herzfeld's story unfolded, I began to find myself
drawn into his characterizations, and to realize that this was one of
those rare films where even minor players seemed to have a life of their
own.  One of the most hilarious scenes features Austin Pendleton as a
former actor in one of Teddy's movies who runs into him in a park and
takes vicious glee in detailing Teddy's recent flops.  That one scene
speaks volumes about Teddy, about the embittered actor, and about
Hollywood's loathing of failure, and it is typical of the economy with
which Herzfeld is able to deliver fully-formed characters.</P>
<P>     Mazursky's Teddy is one of the two pivotal characters in 2 DAYS IN
THE VALLEY, and his performance is superb, particularly early in the film.
His relationship with his dog makes for one of the most touching scenes I
have seen this year, as his life is saved quite literally by the love of
his pet, and Mazursky's puffy, defeated demeanor is perfect.  Danny Aiello
is equally sharp as a wiseguy with something to prove, and a bigger heart
than anyone expects.  They are surrounded by winning performances -- even
Spader achieves a surprising level of capricious menace -- but Mazursky
and Aiello are always at the center of a film which gives you the
opportunity to care about the people in it.</P>
<P>     I should make something very clear at this point:  2 DAYS IN THE
VALLEY is smartly plotted, with enough unexpected detours to satisfy the
most die-hard lovers of cinematic guessing games.  It never strays
particularly far from the conventions of gritty pot-boilers, including
plenty of gratuitous sex and violence, and even one heck of a brutal
cat-fight between Hatcher and Charlize Theron as Lee's ice queen
girlfriend..  What is surprising about 2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY is that after
every twist has played itself out, it is not the twists which are
memorable.  It is a genuinely human redemption story wrapped in a dark,
violent thriller.  If Herzfeld leaves a few loose ends, I was willing to
forgive him because he trusted an audience with a character-driven film in
a plot-driven genre.  That is a twist I was not expecting.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 valley highs:  8.</PRE>
