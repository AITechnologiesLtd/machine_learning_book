<PRE>                                   SIRENS
                      A        film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  This        is a delicious Australian comedy
     based on around real incident from        the 1930s.  An English
     vicar visits the estate of        an Australian famous for painting
     female nudes to convince the artist not to        exhibit        a painting
     deemed blasphemous.  Instead the vicar's wife is seduced by
     the sensuous atmosphere surrounding the artist.  Rating:  +2
     (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<PRE>     It        was the        1930s and the Australian art world was shocked by the so-
called immoral paintings of Norman Lindsey.  There were        some people who        were
irritated as he        has painted picture after picture with sensuous        female
nudes.        But for        some, particularly for the local religious authorities,        this
time he        had gone too far.  A local exhibition included a crucified female
nude.  Around this minor controversial episode of art history John Duigan
has written and        directed the most enchanting comedy film since last year's
MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING.</PRE>
<PRE>     Anthony Campion (played by        Hugh Grant) is an English vicar        visiting
Australia.  His        travel plans will take him near        Lindsay's studio/home.        He
is given the mission of        visiting Lindsay (played by Sam        Neill) and
convincing him to pull the offending painting from exhibition.        Campion        is
deemed an ideal        choice since he        cannot possibly        appear to represent outdated
ideas to Lindsay.  After all Campion was actually was a        bit of a progressive
himself        at Oxford.  And        Campion        even goes so far as to smoke Turkish
cigarettes and call his        pretty wife "Piglet." Lindsay can't help but be
impressed by a free thinker like that, can he?        Instead        there will be a
clash of worldviews and        Estella        (a.k.a.        Piglet)        will discover there is an
entire sensuous        world she never        knew.</PRE>
<PRE>     This is a story about conflicting worldviews.  In spite of        considering
himself        very liberal, Anthony lives in a world of strict, church-dictated
limits.         Lindsay, his wife, and        his three models live in a world of frequent
nudity,        open discussion        of sex,        promiscuity, and omni-present paintings        and
statues        of female nudes        that unnerves even the neighbors.  But it is clear
that the Campions are not prepared to survive in this hostile Australian
world.        There is a running gag about hostile animal attacks going on all
around and the Campion's fear, though they themselves never meet anything
more savage than the odd wallaroo.  They seem to be followed by        a snake, but
his presence seems more        metaphorical than real.         Nature        really seems toward
them to        be its most benevolent and beautiful, as if on its best        behavior for
guests.</PRE>
<PRE>     Hugh Grant, does a        terrific job of        trying to seem free-thinking and yet
being horribly inhibited.  In the presence of nude models his worldly
exterior gives way to flustered        stuttering.  Tara Fitzgerald of        HEAR MY        SONG
initially matches here husbands        disapproval of the sensuous lifestyle but
slowly defrosts        with time.  There is a marvelous duality in her        performance
as she tries to        appear straight-laced to her husband while exploring a side
of herself that        she has        hidden from herself and        others.         Unfortunately Sam
Neill has little to do in his performance but appeal worldly and in a way
almost fatherly        to the models he paints        nude.  He is almost the        opposite of
his character in THE PIANO.</PRE>
<PRE>     SIRENS is often very funny        and at the same        time serves as a sort of
down-under Monroe Doctrine saying "The is Australia--no        Pat Robertsons are
welcome."  I give it a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</PRE>
