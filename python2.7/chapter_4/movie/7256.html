<PRE>                               MARVIN'S ROOM
                       A film review by Michael Redman
                        Copyright 1997 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>***1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Because of the inherent drama, dysfunctional families have always been
better film fodder than "normal" ones and here we have a prize-winner.
Marvin, the father (Hume Cronyn) is a 20-year stroke victim who can't do
much more than lie in bed twitching and watching reflected light bounce
around his room. Aunt Ruth (Gwen Verdon) is semi-invalid, addicted to
soap operas and somewhat demented albeit in a delightful way. Daughter
Bessie (Diane Keaton) has sacrificed her life to care for the two.</P>
<P>To make matters even more complex, Bessie learns that she has leukemia.
She can possibly be saved by a bone marrow transplant from her sister or
nephews. Of course this is complicated too. The two siblings haven't
seen each other since the stroke when Lee (Meryl Streep) abandoned the
family because she couldn't deal with her father's condition.</P>
<P>Realizing that this time she must face up to her responsibility, Lee
packs up and reluctantly heads to the Florida home. First she must
gather up her sons: Charlie (Hal Scardino) who rarely looks out of his
books and Hank (Leonardo DiCaprio) who was placed in a mental
institution after he burned down their house.</P>
<P>Given the commercial approach to marketing films, we shouldn't be too
shocked that the misleading newspaper ads only feature the quote "I
promise Marvin's Room will make you laugh...", but if you're going to
the film expecting a light-hearted laugh-fest, you're in for a surprise.</P>
<P>Writer Scott McPherson (who died of AIDS complications in 1992) succeeds
in pulling off the comedic scenes by making the characters human beings
who have not totally given in to their dire circumstances. Caring for
her father who has been dying for 20 years, Bessie has adapted to the
situation and is able to see the joy in living ("I look back and I've
had such love").</P>
<P>Besides the humor, the thing that saves this from being a melodramatic
"disease d'jour" film is the exceptional acting abilities of the stars.
Even the relatively minor roles are wonderful choices. Bessie's
forgetful Dr. Wally (Robert DeNiro, also one of the producers) and his
half-witted assistant (Dan Hedaya) provide some of the light moments.
"That's what I get for hiring my brother," Wally explains after one of
Hedaya's off the wall comments.</P>
<P>At the core of the film is not the various ailments, but rather the
growing relationship between Hank, his mother and his aunt whom he has
never before met. As he comes out of his anger, there is hope for the
future among the dying.</P>
<P>Keaton appears to be on a come-back roll as she looks and acts much
older than her former screen personas. Streep, who could play almost any
character with skill, abandons herself to the almost-graduated
cosmetologist.</P>
<P>There are no high drama death scenes. Fortunately the story doesn't sink
to the tear-jerking level of who's going to die and how sad it is. It's
more about how to live amongst the sorrows. We are given a glimpse into
the lives of real people: a rare treat.</P>
