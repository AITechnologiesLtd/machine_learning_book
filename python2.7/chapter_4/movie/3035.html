<PRE>                           BULLETS OVER BROADWAY
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Woody Allen is back and, in case you were wondering, he is as good
as ever.   For this double satire on gangsters and "The Theatre," he
chose the 1920s which was the height of the gangsters a la Damon Runyon
characters as well as Broadway's peak decade.</P>
<P>     David Shayne (John Cusack) is a playwright seeking to get his
work staged and directed by himself.   A starry-eyed writer, filled
with integrity, he is told by his potential producer, Julian Marx (Jack
Warden), that a gangster, Nick Valenti (Joe Viterelli), is willing to
be the play's angel provided his talentless showgirl moll, Olive
(Jennifer Tilly), gets a juicy part in the play.  In this case, she
wants the role of the psychiatrist.</P>
<P>     David, if he sets aside his principles and hires Olive, will be
able to get Helen Sinclair (Dianne Wiest), a prima donna who likes to
imbibe, as well as the money to hire Eden Brent (Tracey Ullman) and
Warner Purcell (Jim Broadbent).   No contest: David's principles
lose.</P>
<P>     Lest I run the risk of being a "Spoiler," allow me only to say
that Cheech, (Chazz Palminteri), the gangster's lieutenant, is assigned
to sit in at the rehearsals to see that Olive gets the part she wants,
act as her bodyguard and to keep an eye on things.  This turns into
some of the funniest scenes in the movie.   Palminteri, by the way, is
the author of that excellent screenplay, A BRONX TALE, in which he
played Sonny, a gangster.</P>
<P>     Also helping things along are Rob Reiner, Mary-Louise Parker and
Harvey Fierstein.   A great cast.</P>
<PRE>     Woody has done it again.</PRE>
