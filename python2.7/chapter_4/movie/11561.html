<PRE>His Girl Friday (1940)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 88</PRE>
<P>"His Girl Friday" is a comedy that satirizes the newspaper
business.  It is based on the noted Broadway play
"The Front Page", but with a plot twist in that one
of the two leads is a woman and is the ex-wife of the other.</P>
<P>It stars Rosalind Russell as a headstrong woman
who plans to marry a milquetoast insurance salesman
(Ralph Bellamy).  She attempts to quit her job as a reporter
working for conniving editor and ex-husband Cary Grant.
Although she is fully aware of his schemes, she gets suckered
into covering one last story; the pending execution of
a mild-mannered man who becomes unstable when carrying
a handgun.</P>
<P>One of the running gags of the film is that clueless
Bellamy keeps ending up in jail, an innocent victim of
Grant's machinations.  Bellamy plays the wide-eyed dupe
perfectly.  When Grant makes a ridiculous speech about
his devotion to his ex-wife, Bellamy believes it all
and can only say "Gee!" in amazement.</P>
<P>"His Girl Friday" makes heavy use of overlapping dialogue.
One scene has Grant, Russell and Bellamy all talking at once.
This technique works as it makes the film more dynamic.</P>
<P>Newspapermen are depicted in the film as prone to
cynical moralizing, embellishing the truth for dramatic
impact, and willing to commit crimes in order to win
a "scoop".  This image may be more accurate today, more
than a half century later, than it was when the film was made.</P>
<P>Director Howard Hawks and Cary Grant must have gotten along
well, since they made four other films together.  All but
one of these films was a comedy.  Cary Grant was a great
comic actor, usually playing a character who doesn't quite
realize that he is making a fool of himself.  "His Girl Friday"
is different in that Bellamy plays the stooge.  Of course, Grant
had success in dramatic roles as well.</P>
