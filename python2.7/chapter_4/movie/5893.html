<PRE>                              REEFER MADNESS
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks

<P>        REEFER MADNESS is one of the most famous bad movies 
of all time. It's an ancient propaganda piece about the dangers of 
marijuana, "the new drug menace that is destroying the youth of 
America in alarmingly increasing numbers." An on-screen prologue 
tells us, "Something must be done to wipe out this ghastly menace," 
but obviously this movie isn't the thing to do it. If anything, it has 
prompted sixty years worth of teenagers to try pot for the first time 
and countless others to laugh hysterically at some of the worst 
acting and preposterous dialogue in cinema history.</P>
<P>        The movie centers around a clean-cut WASP couple, Bill 
and Mary, who spend their days playing tennis and drinking tea 
on the back porch, where Bill says to Mary, "I went home and told 
mother that the problem with her pot roast gravy was that she hadn't 
added three heaping teaspoons of olive oil." From the looks of these 
two, they're already either tripping acid or on heroin, but their 
friend, Jimmy, soon introduces Bill to someone who can get him 
something even better.</P>
<P>        It's Jack, the local dealer, who invites kids up to his 
girlfriend's apartment and gives them free pot. Bill comes up with 
his friend and begins to light up his plain old tobacco-and-nicotine 
cigarette when a beautiful girl gives him one of her cigarettes. Soon 
Bill's giggling like a schoolgirl and dancing a frantic jitterbug. If 
REEFER MADNESS only serves one education purpose, it's as 
evidence that white people can't dance when they're stoned 
either.</P>
<P>        Of course, after one joint, Bill's hooked. And, as his grades 
and tennis game go down the tubes, the principal can't help but 
notice. He comes right out and asks Bill, "Isn't it true that you 
have, perhaps unwillingly, acquired a certain harmful habit through 
association with certain undesirable people?" But Bill ducks the 
question and heads back to the solace of Jack's apartment, where 
any kid can go to be himself.</P>
<P>        After one particularly potent reefer, Bill beds down 
with another girl. A concerned Mary tracks him down but gets the 
cigarette switch trick pulled on her. Soon she's giggling like a school 
girl while the weirdest of the potheads, Ralph, tries to jump her 
bones. When she resists and begins screaming, Bill comes running 
out, still under the influence of the evil weed. He begins 
hallucinating and blacking out at the same time Jack accidentally 
shoots Mary. The bullethole in her back is about the thickness 
of a pencil.</P>
<P>        "Is she alright?" the other girl asks. "She's dead," Jack 
replies, pinning the blame on Bill, who ends up being convicted 
of murder. Only Ralph and the other girl know the truth, and they're 
locked up in Jack's apartment for the duration of the trial, with only 
a piano and couple hundred joints to keep them going. That's when 
the movie's funniest scene comes along, in which the girl, joint in 
mouth, begins playing the piano and a paranoid Ralph keeps yelling, 
"Faster! Faster!" until finally the girl is playing a frenzied solo, 
establishing the marijuana-music connection which would peak 
in the 60's.</P>
<P>        The climax comes when Ralph kills Jack and the guilty 
piano girl blurts out the truth to the police. "I'm guilty, I'm guilty!" 
she cries as she signs her confession. Scarcely one minute later, 
as she is being led back to her cell by a prison matron, she runs 
down the hall and throws herself out the window, by which point 
most viewers of REEFER MADNESS have done the same. The only 
way to get anything out of this movie is stoned, with the video box 
serving as one giant rolling paper. But watch out because "the dread 
marijuana may be reaching forth next for your son or daughter... or 
yours... or YOURS!"</P>
