<P>   Depending on your views about communism, "A Friend of
the Deceased" is either the most reactionary movie since
"Starship Troopers" or the most progressive one since "Red
Sorghum."  Director Vyacheslav Krishtifovich, who filmed the
action in Ukraine's touristic capital of Kiev, has a political axe
to grind.  He may not wholeheartedly support a return to the
good old days of Ukraine's provincial role in a firmly
communist Soviet Union.  But while he appreciates the
freedom the new country has since independence from
Moscow, he looks back sympathetically to a time that
Ukrainians were more warm and neighborly and blames
capitalism for a new atmosphere of coldness.  It's all business
dealings now, he seems to say, not human connection.  His
theory has pertinence to the countries like the U.S. which
have long enjoyed capitalism.  It's commonly believed that in
poor areas, the residents support one another.  They refuse
to send their elderly and frail to nursing homes, they sit on
stoops and chat the night away.  But Krishtofovich is
forgetting that in needy neighborhoods, crime is sometimes
rampant and social pathologies make their mark in the
disproportionate number of the mentally ill.  And China, still
firmly in the communist camp despite its free-market reforms,
is no model of people-to-people cordiality.</P>
<P>   Krishtofovich, using a screenplay by Andrei Kourkov, seems
eager to display a new Dodge City world in Kiev ruled by
high-flying entrepreneurs, the Mob and the black market.  At
least that's what the press notes indicate.  By focusing on a
lonely intellectual who seems unable to make it in this brave
new world, he wants to portray a society adrift, one in which a
new class of losers abounds.  Anatoli (Alexandre Lazarev), a
nerdy Woody Allen type without that master's sense of humor
or irony, had always made his living as a translator for
Ukrainian firms who need to deal with those who speak
English and French.  For reasons not explained, he has fallen
on hard times since the silent revolution which has replaced
the Iron Curtain with the open door.  Why would his country
need him in the past but not now?  One would think a
flourishing business economy could use his talents to an even
greater degree.  </P>
<P>   His wife Katia (Angelika Nevolina) is leaving him for a
hipper guy with a fancy red car (as though the wheels were
the only reason for her departure).  His phone--whose
handset is mysterious and inexplicably tied to the unit forcing
him to use the speakerphone--rarely rings.  He is depressed
and, through a friend, Dima (Eugen Pachin), he hires a hit
man.  The intended victim is not Katia's boyfriend but his own
suicidal self.  When he meets a hooker, Lena (Tatiana
Krivitska), a spirited but unappealing vamp who is attracted to
Anatoli, his mood brightens, he wants to call off the hit, but
discovers that it's too late.  The contract, once agreed to,
must be fulfilled.  The remainder of the story deals with his
efforts to stop his own execution, which involves the hiring of
Ivan (Sergiy Romanyuk), a hit man for the hit man.</P>
<P>   Lazarez plays the role in a deadpan manner that would not
impress W.C. Fields.  He is so down-and-out throughout, so
phlegmatic and inarticulate, that he seems already to be the
titled deceased guy.  Only Elena Korkova in the role of
Marina, the wife of the contract killer, brings breath to this
downer of a film, which fails appropriately to exploit the Kiev
milieu and, more important, does not promote the creators'
view that Anatoli's problems are the fault of the new
capitalism.  In Russian with English titles, "A Friend of the
Deceased" was exhibited at several film festivals including
those at Cannes, Toronto, and Sundance.  Rated R.  Running
time: 100 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten 1998</P>
