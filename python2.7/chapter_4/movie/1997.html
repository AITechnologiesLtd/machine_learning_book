<PRE>                          IN THE LINE OF FIRE
                       A film review by Jon Webb
                        Copyright 1993 Jon Webb</PRE>
<P>     This film is a series of cliches, strung together with great
talent and enough originality to give you the feeling that you're
watching real cinematic art, which in fact you are.</P>
<P>     The plot is familiar (legend of the Fisher King): discredited cop
gets a chance to redeem himself but must first overcome the demons of
his past.  The scenes are familiar: cop comes home to his empty
apartment, pours himself a drink, and gets The Phone Call.  Cop finally
looks like he's going to lay his object of desire, is interrupted (he
must of course stay pure, as the knights did in the antecedent of this
story).  Etc.</P>
<P>     Three people make this an interesting film: Wolfgang Petersen, the
director, who twists each scene and gives it a resonance informed by,
but not parodying, all the previous films that tell the same story;
Clint Eastwood, who (as in UNFORGIVEN) reflects on growing older and
how this affects his macho image; and John Malkovich, who explores his
character's psychosis with freshness and humor.</P>
<P>     For example, under Petersen's direction the scene where the cop
finally seems about to get laid becomes funny as weapons and hardware
fall to the floor (and Eastwood's comment later in the scene makes it
hilarious).</P>
<P>     Petersen understands the medium, he knows what kind of story he's
telling, and he doesn't waste time building up suspense when you know
exactly how a scene is going to end.  He just lets it happen, and then
gets back to the interesting stuff, which is what happens in between
the obvious stuff.</P>
<P>     Eastwood is getting old, and is more and more willing to expose
himself and let the camera do its worst. Here he's still holding on to
the idea of the macho cop who can lay any woman but you can see how
earnestly he needs to get that fix, the pretty lady who falls to his
charms, and how he's not willing to go all the way and give (as opposed
to risk) his life to get the bad guy.</P>
<P>     John Malkovich adds little touches to his portrayal of the psycho
who's out to kill the President.  The way he tilts his head after he
shoots a couple of people who present themselves as convenient targets,
the way he goads Eastwood to shoot him, this is great stuff.</P>
