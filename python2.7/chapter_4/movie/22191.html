<P>   "Girl, Interrupted" comes out at an opportune moment.  The
NY Times of Dec. 13 reports in its lead story that one out of
every five Americans will suffer a mental disturbance in any
given year and that two-thirds of those people will never seek
help for their problems.  A major reason for this passivity is
the belief that emotional problems are a sign of weakness. 
Yet decades ago, Freud and others had established that mind
and body are interconnected; that an emotional difficulty is no
more shameful than a physical handicap.  What many still do
not realize is that someone with such an impairment cannot
simply "snap out of it" any more than a guy with a fractured
ankle can simply get up and walk.</P>
<P>   Movies that have exploited such emotional difficulties have
often shown that the cure is worse than the disease.  Anatole
Litvak's "The Snake Pit," made 51 years ago featuring an
electrifying performance by Olivia de Haviland, was one of
the first films to deal intelligently with mental breakdowns,
while Milos Forman's "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"
back in '75 featureed Jack Nicholson as a feisty misfit not
unlike one of the female characters in "Girl, Interrupted," who
pushes his fellow inmates to assert themselves against a
tyrannical nurse.</P>
<P>   "Girl, Interrupted" is dramatized from a true-life experience
of novelist Susanna Kaysen, whose best-seller by the same
name dealt with her episode in a private mental hospital
during the flamboyant era of the late '60s.  While director
James Mangold's adaptation written together with Anna
Hamilton Phelan and Lisa Loomer depicts the staff of the
hospital (filmed in an actual institution in Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania) as competent and rational, the film broadly
hints that some of the patients do not really belong there--that
they would not be dangerous if released and treated as out-
patients.  On the other hand, one inmate was obviously
released too early.  She committed suicide at home soon
thereafter.</P>
<P>   The author, Susanna (played by Winona Ryder) was the
product of an upper-middle class household, the only student
in her elite school without plans to go to college.  While her
classmates were accepted into Radcliffe and Wellesley,
Susanna was dazed and confused, knowing only that she
wanted to be a writer.  (In one of the movie's only humorous
moments, Susanna tells a caseworker of her ambition to
write, to which the latter asks, "Yes, but what will you do?")
When her psychiatrist diagnoses her as having Borderline
Personal Disorder, she all-too-quickly goes along with his
judgment and, being 18 years of age, checks herself into a
hospital.  It is there, at Claymoore, that she finds the best
friends she ever had, including Lisa (Angelina Jolie), a free-
spirited young woman who says whatever comes to mind and
has a heart of stone; Daisy (Brittany Murphy), who has had
an unhealthy relationship with her dad and is addicted to
rotisserie chicken and laxatives; Polly (Elisabeth Moss), who
is the kindest woman in her circle but has been facially
disfigured in a fire; and her roommate, Georgina (Clea
Duvall), who seems pretty normal to me.</P>
<P>   Though quite well acted particularly by Winona Ryder as
the author's stand-in, "Girl, Interrupted"--which gets its title
from a Vermeer painting in New York's Frick Museum to 
which Susanna's English teacher introduced her--has a
wholly predictable trajectory and is therefore only mildly
winning.  The book's frequent ironic passages appear absent
from this basic TV fare, which includes the expected reaction
of disbelief and displeasure from Susanna's bourgeois
parents; disgust and hostility from Mrs. Gilcrest (Mary Kay
Place), the wife of the English teacher with whom Susanna
had a brief affair; an equally brief sexual interlude with the
strikingly handsome Tobias Jacobs (Jared Leto), who is about
to escape the Vietnam draft by fleeing to Canada; and the
frequent interventions by the hospital staff whenever a
patient--particularly the fiery Lisa--would lose control.  </P>
<P>   Mangold covers the rooms of the psychiatric hospital
displaying a laundry list of types rather than drawn-out
characters, and treats the staff in a similar manner--the no-
nonsense nurse, Valerie (Whoopi Goldberg); the ivory-tower
head psychiatrist Dr. Wick (Vanessa Redgrave), and the
somewhat laughable Dr. Melvin Potts (Jeffrey Tambor)--all of
whom say exactly what you'd expect such professionals to
remark.</P>
<P>   On a philosophical note, the story also covers the usual
sophomoric grounds: What's normal and what's irrational? 
Susanna is labeled promiscuous, but shoots back at Dr.
Wick, "How many girls would a 17-year-old boy have to screw
to earn the label 'compulsively promiscuous'?"  We are led to
believe that what really shakes Susanna out of her doldrums
is not the professional treatment she receives but the
camaraderie she enjoys with the other young women on the
floor, particularly her acting as mentor to the erratic Lisa, a
role that Angelina Jolie takes over in one scene-stealer after
another.</P>
<P>   Aside from a quick look at a drug party that the girls attend
after a brief escape from the hospital and a soundtrack of
sixties music, there is little to signify that the story is taking
place during the flamboyant sixties, a period that would
encourage some to comment that the whole country was
crazier than most of the so-called loonies in the psychiatric
centers.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 127 minutes.  (C) 1999
