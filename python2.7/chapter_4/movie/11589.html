<P>The great Yogi Berra was once hanging out with his Yankee drinking
buddies when one of them suggested going to see a porno movie.  "C'mon,
Yogi," one of them said, "let's go see a dirty movie."</P>
<P>"I don't know," Yogi replied.  "Who's in it?"</P>
<P>By their very nature, pornographic movies don't spend a lot of time on
character development or acting ability or costumes or, well, anything.
Boogie Nights is a real movie, with the goal of showing the audience the
personalities and the lives of the otherwise anonymous naked people
working in the 1970's  pornography industry.  It spends time on all of
the things that the dirty movies leave out, and its attention to the
details of the period and to the development of its characters make it a
very watchable and sometimes gripping film.</P>
<P>This is a movie that walks a narrow knife blade.  If this was a movie
devoted to romanticizing and glamorizing its characters, people would
have stayed away in droves.  The subject matter is not the stuff of high
tragedy, and the characters who populate the film are a little too
sleazy to merit overly dramatic treatment.  At the same time, it
wouldn't have taken much of an effort to turn this script into a piece
of comic fluff as insubstantial as Burt Reynolds's hairpiece.  The
1970's setting, the sexual content, and the essential dimness of the
characters, if handled improperly, could have landed this film into the
straight-to-video "Wild Comedy" shelf at Blockbuster.  Boogie Nights is
a balanced movie, walking the knife blade steadily, and almost without a
slip.</P>
<P>The center of the Boogie Nights universe is the San Fernando Valley
mansion of stag film director Jack Horner (Reynolds).  It's sort of a
low-rent Playboy Mansion, complete with string bikinis, a hot tub, a wet
bar, and a basement studio where (apparently) all the movies are
filmed.  And almost everybody we see in the movie is down in that
basement at one time or another, running the cameras, checking the
lighting, taking off their clothes...  it's an odd setup, and could have
been interpreted as a hedonist's Valhalla or a moralist's Sodom and
Gomorrah.  Boogie Nights only works because we get a third perspective:
the creative perspective, where the details of lighting and sound and
storyline are actually taken seriously by a dedicated team of people who
are sincere about their desire to make better dirty movies.</P>
<P>The movie is ostensibly about the rise and fall of Dirk Diggler (Mark
Wahlberg), a young busboy-turned-video matress dancer.  Wahlberg does a
better acting job than anybody had a right to expect -- unless he's just
naturally dim and earnest by nature.  If the Dirk character is ever --
for one second -- unlikable, or if the audience ever takes his macho
posturing seriously, the movie is doomed.  A movie like this is a heavy
load for a young, untried actor, but Wahlberg carries the movie like a
veteran.</P>
<P>He is aided by a spectacular supporting cast.  I'm not convinced that
the performances of Julianne Moore and Burt Reynolds are Oscar-caliber,
but Moore is sweet and affecting as the earth-mother porn-star Amber
Waves, and Reynolds's sleazy charm is made-to-order for his role.
Heather Graham is luminous in the thankless role of Rollergirl, whose
ever-present rollerskates are one of the movies many sight gags --
speaking of which, William H. Macy's hairstyle and drooping mustache
accentuate his brief part as a hangdog assistant director and unloved
husband (whose wife has the movie's signature line).</P>
<P>The unsung hero of Boogie Nights is Don Cheadle, best known for his role
as a district attorney on TV's Picket Fences.  He plays Buck, the only
member of the porno crew to have an independent existence outside the
industry -- as a low-rent stereo salesman, aspiring to open his own shop
with low wholesale prices.  He must have done something in a past life
to earn the enmity of the costume shop, because they're unmerciful to
him, dressing him in everything from Roy Rogers cowboy outfits to a Pat
Boone white suit.  Neverthess, Cheadle has one scene that defines the
movie.  He is (for once) dressed in a conservative suit, and is in a
bank looking for a loan to open his shop.  The bank manager denies
Buck's loan application on the grounds that he's a "pornographer".</P>
<P>"It's not fair," says Cheadle, and the great thing about this movie is
that we the audience agree with him.  We're relating to Buck as a person
and not a piece of meat.  We know his hopes and ambitions, we know
they've been crushed, and we identify with him completely -- just as we
identify with Julianne Moore as she loses custody of her son, just as we
identify with Burt Reynolds as he's forced to give up his pretentions of
being a filmmaker.  Without that identification, without that
relationship, Boogie Nights would sink like a stone -- but the acting is
so good that we're rooting for the characters, even as their worlds come
crashing down around them.</P>
<P>Boogie Nights also boasts superb set design and costume work.  Having
spent the latter part of the 1970s at Lyndon B. Johnson Elementary
School in suburban Texas, I am not qualified to judge whether or not
director Paul Thomas Anderson has successfully recaptured this era, but
it certainly looks that way.  The movie looks like a whole squadron of
UCLA cultural anthropology students have spent the past twelve months
digging through the flea markets and bargain bins of Los Angeles just to
find the appropriate Cheryl Tiegs poster to put in Mark Wahlberg's
bedroom, or the appropriate 8-track hi-fi for stereo salesman / porn
actor Don Cheadle to sell, or the just-right platform shoes and
"imported Italian nylon" costumes. By making the audience chuckle at the
bell-bottoms and disco balls that abound in Boogie Nights,
writer/director Anderson keeps them from taking the story too seriously,
and also allows the set design to carry the burden of the humor.</P>
<P>Dirk Diggler tells us that everybody has "one special thing" (his being
the size of his manly region, a running joke throughout).  Boogie Nights
is fortunate to have at least two special things:  the excellence of its
set design and the quality of its actors. If it's not a great movie,
it's an exceptionally well-crafted movie, and these days, that goes a
long, long way.</P>
