<PRE>THE FORSAKEN
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>Breasts and blood.  Writer/director J.S. Cardone's THE FORSAKEN 
prominently features breasts and blood, although the nonsensical opening 
sequence displays breasts "in" blood, as an unknown woman rubs blood all 
over her naked bosom.  It's a movie in which one of the vampires is 
referred to as a "Penthouse pet from hell."</P>
<P>Since people can be low on substances from potassium to iron, perhaps 
they can also have a sleaze deficiency.  If you're suffering from such a 
malady, THE FORSAKEN might be just the tonic for you.  Not going for 
B-movie parody as SCARY MOVIE wisely did, THE FORSAKEN takes itself 
quite seriously, which is a big mistake.  Watching it isn't so much 
disgusting as it is just a colossal waste of time.</P>
<P>Sean (Kerr Smith), supposedly the son of the second assistant director 
of E.T., works as an editor preparing trailers at a studio whose 
pictures aren't named, but the posters on the wall include movies such 
as CLASS OF NUKE 'EM HIGH.  The latter is undoubtedly better than THE 
FORSAKEN.</P>
<P>Sean takes time off from his job so that he can earn extra cash by 
driving someone else's Mercedes convertible across the country to Miami.  
Soon after he leaves, two women with large boobs pull alongside him on a 
two-lane road.  You guessed it -- one of them flashes Sean for no 
apparent reason other than the director told her to.  </P>
<P>Although given strict instructions to avoid hitchhikers, Sean picks up a 
self-described slacker named Nick (Brendan Fehr).  As soon as the 
vampires arrive -- you don't have to wait long -- we learn that Nick is 
a "hunter."  Once bitten himself, he's now out to get "them."  Trust me, 
you won't care.  The only thing that you'll care about will be found on 
the dial of your watch.</P>
<P>"Do you make a lot of money in the movie biz?" Nick asks Sean soon after 
meeting him.  "Not yet," Sean replies hopefully.  Let's hope that movies 
that waste our time and money like THE FORSAKEN won't make much at all.  
Let's not encourage the studios to make such trash.</P>
<P>THE FORSAKEN runs a long 1:30.  It is rated R for strong violence/gore, 
language and sexuality and would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
