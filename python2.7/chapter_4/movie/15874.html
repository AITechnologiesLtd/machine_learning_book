<P>Director Robert Robriguez teams up with the new sensation in horror
films, screenwriter Kevin Williamson, for a mixed up movie which
mingles elements of many other films including THE INVASION OF THE BODY
SNATCHERS, THE THING (8/10) and THE BREAKFAST CLUB (7.5/10). This film
was also one of the first to be heavily sponsored by a clothing line
for its publicity, as Tommy Hillfiger decided to take a stab at the
movies himself.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Six unique students with their respective identities all agree on one
thing: they believe their teachers to be possessed by aliens. As the
story unfolds, we find that their far-fetched theory is not that far
off.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Passable horror flic manages to steal from literally every horror and
science-fiction movie from the past (while acknowledging most with a
wink of the eye), while moving at a slower pace than I would've
anticipated from a Rodriguez film, featuring some solid performances
from all of its stars, and a scattered set of special effects that were
anything but out of this world. This movie was never boring, but never
really did manage to blow me away from my seat either. The multitude
and breadth of its cast was elaborate and fun to watch, featuring Usher
the rapper, Bebe Neuwirth from TV's "Cheers", Josh Hartnett from this
year's other scary movie H20: HALLOWEEN (7.5/10) and even Summer
Phoenix, sister of Joaquin Phoenix, and the late River Phoenix. Add to
that, the fact that the script also wasn't anything fantastic, and
neither was the directorial style from the eye of Robert Rodriguez, and
you've got yourself a semi-interesting peek into a genre that could
easily be improved upon in the future.</P>
<P>There were a couple of scenes that were cool to see, and some slick
lines, but all in all this film drove along the standard teen horror
terrain without a kink in the road, with many science-fiction elements
tossed in for effect. The length of the film might not have been such
an issue with me, were it not for the fact that the students seemed to
go on discussing their issues ad infinitum, explaining the film as it
went along. I would suggest this film to all those that have enjoyed
the rest of the recent crop of horror junkfilms that have passed
through their mutliplexes of late, but ask that you not expect too much
in regards to originality or style. For the rest of you, well, just go
out and rent the original SCREAM (8/10) for a real good script by
Williamson, or see John Carpenter's classic sci-fi movie, THE THING
(8/10). All in all, a believable tale of sci-fi horror with an
unnecessary cast of names who play their roles quite well, which
ultimately didn't astound me due to its deja-vu factor, and which
surely could've used some Christmas "trimming" of its own.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
One obvious nod in the script to his own previous hit films, has Zeke
selling black market videocassettes of "Jennifer Love Hewitt and Neve
Campbell with full-frontal nudity" out of the trunk of his car. As we
all know by now, each respective girl starred in the Kevin
Williamson-penned screenplays of SCREAM (8/10) and I STILL KNOW WHAT
YOU DID LAST SUMMER (7.5/10).
Harry Knowles, the man behind the infamous "Ain't it Cool" Web site at
<A HREF="http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/">http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/</A> has an appearance in this film. He
apparently plays the "film teacher" in the movie, but just look for the
overweight gentleman with the red hair, who seems to hang around in the
faculty lounge.
Summer Phoenix, younger sister of Joaquin Phoenix and the late River
Phoenix, plays the girl who keeps smacking her boyfriend around for the
whole movie.
Piper Laurie, the scary-looking teacher with the fat face, also played
CARRIE's (7/10) overbearing mom in the 1976 classic Brian DePalma film.</P>
<P>Robert Patrick, who plays Coach Willis in this film, is best remembered
as the T-1000 character that he played opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger
in 1991's TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY (8/10).
Clea Duvall, who plays Stokely in this film is not related to acting
legend Robert Duvall.
Salma Hayek has played a role in all of director Robert Rodriguez'
Hollywood pictures. She stands 5"2, was born in southeast Mexico, and
is the daughter of a Lebanese father and a Mexican mother. Hayek began
her career in Mexican TV soap operas in late 80's.
Famke Janssen was born in Holland, where she began her professional
career as a model.
Laura Harris, who plays Mary Beth in this film, also played in SUICIDE
KINGS (6.5/10). She was the sister who got kidnapped by the mobsters.
Director Robert Robriguez earned most of the $7000 it cost to make his
first picture EL MARIACHI (7/10) by subjecting himself to experimental
drug studies. He has a son named Rocket.</P>
