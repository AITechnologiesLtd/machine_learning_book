<P> "Are we shooting?"
Starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, Spike Jonze, Nora
Dunn, Jamie Kennedy. Rated R.</P>
<P>If Three Kings is a comedy, it's the most important one since Dr.
Strangelove. It is being vociferously promoted as a "war comedy," and to
a certain extent, I suppose it is one. It is decidely not satire and it
is far from the offbeat, poignant humor of Life is Beautiful. No -- the
comedy here is rather broad (though definitely not dumb). The amazing
thing is not that it manages to be funny without being stupid but that
it effectively balances an inordinate amount of humor with intelligent,
subtle political and social commentary. It's an unrestrained, riveting
film, three-dimentional and skillfully made. It's in the spirit of
M*A*S*H, but not really.</P>
<P>It's also the second movie ever to deal with The Gulf War (Courage Under
Fire being the first). Actually, it takes place immediately after the
war, when groups of American soldiers are hanging out in Iraq during the
just-declared ceasefire. Bored and thinking of their families, four of
these soldiers decide to go on a renegade mission. After finding a map
in the unlikeliest of places, Archie Gates (George Clooney), Troy Barlow
(Mike Wahlberg), Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) and Vig (Spike Jonze) leave
their base without authorization to look for some gold. This isn't just
any gold: this is gold that Saddam stole from the people of Kuwait.
Kuwait wants it back, understandably, but the foursome have no intention
of returning it. Instead, they hope to strike it rich so when they
return home neither they nor their families would have to worry about
money ever again.</P>
<P>Let's backtrack for a second. As the movie opens, Mark Wahlberg walks on
to the screen, looks at the camera and yells "Are we shooting?" For
those in doubt about just what he is talking about (and it's a neat
trick, foreshadowing the unconventional experience we are about to
have), he backs up his question with "Are we shooting people, or what?"
You see, none of these soldiers have seen any "action" during their
whole involvment in the war, so when, in the film's opening sequence,
they get to shoot an Iraqi soldier they take a sick pleasure in it. One
of them remarks "I didn't think I'd get to see anyone get shot in this
war. Take a picture."</P>
<P>Be careful what you wish for -- you just might get it. The "action" they
were looking for would come after the war was over. They come to look
for the gold in the remains of a village. There, they discover Saddam's
troops attacking Iraqis who decided to rebel against Saddam, just like
George Bush instructed. They are not allowed to do anything about it due
to the ceasefire. Archie's humane instincts prevail over his military
common sense, however, and the four Americans wind up being the ones
responsible for breaking the ceasefire and the ones stuck with the
cumbersome task of transporting refugees to the Iranian border in order
to get the gold they so desperately want.</P>
<P>Three Kings is about priorities. What are our priorities as a nation?
What would happen if a soldier's priorities differed from those of his
nation? Whose is he to follow? These questions are posed in a superb,
solidly constructed storyline with brilliant, funny dialogue and
exciting action sequences. This is a movie where everything seems to
work; all the elements come together to make a convincing, brilliant
whole.</P>
<P>The standout performance, surprisingly, is that of Ice Cube who manages
to turn a minor, seemingly insignificant character into one of the most
interesting and compelling in the film. For possibly the first time in
his feature film career, George Clooney is also outstanding;
appropriately energetic and darkly funny. Wahlberg plays the most
volatile of our four protagonists, and he does it with an almost Woody
Allen-ish level of neurosis: paranoid, self-absorbed and always looking
for the solution most profitable to himself.</P>
<P>Directed by David O. Russell (Flirting With Disaster), this movie is
sometimes brutally violent, but those scenes are staged in such creative
ways and are so fluid and exciting that with a few exceptions, we barely
notice. Russell uses an interesting method a few times throughout Three
Kings in which he uses a real cadaver to "demonstrate" what happens when
a bullet pierces a certain part of the human body. Though this elicited
some groans from the audience, those not weak of stomach are likely to
find the effect "cool." I'm not sure I disliked this eccentric (if
that's the right word) little trick, but I'm equally not sure how it fit
in with the rest of the film.</P>
<P>Three Kings is exhilirating and smart, a great film which manages to
involve us in the action and make us think. It's a better war drama than
a certain overrated 1998 Steven Spielberg movie (all right, Saving
Private Ryan), a better comedy than Life is Beautiful and one of the
very best films I've seen this year.</P>
