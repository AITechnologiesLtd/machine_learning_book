<PRE>The Dinner Game (PG-13) *** 1/2
Starring Jacques Villeret, Thierry Lhermitte
Directed by Francis Veber
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>If there has been a better comedy of errors this year than I'd reccomend it be
shown with this delightful French import from the director of La Cage aux
Folles. It could be a laugh all day film festival, because that's exactly what
this movie is. What seems like the French "Bean" turns out to be an even more
hilarious romp. This movie will have you laughing for days after, and I'm glad
I'm able to share this review with you.</P>
<P>A man is on a train with Francois Pignon (Villeret) when he begins to pull out
pictures of different things he has built out of matches. Guess how many
matches it took? He asks, 364,422! Pierre is charmed, because he's found an
idiot for his friend Pierre Brochant (Lhermitte.) Every Wednesday they invite
an idiot to have dinner in order to make fun of him all evening. Tonight it's
his turn, and before now, he was idiotless. Plus, this guy is in a class of his
own.</P>
<P>Pierre cracks his back while playing golf, the doctor tells him not to go to
the dinner for his better health but since his idiot is the cream of the crop
he attempts to go anyway. Then his wife Christine (Alexandra Vandernoot)
decides to leave him for his cruelty for others. He thinks he's gone to the man
he stole her from, then decides she's at a local love club. But in order get
the phone number there they have to call a tax auditor. The idiot worsens
Pierre's back problems and screws up any of his chances of getting back
together with his wife. A complex plot is soon laid out in the household.</P>
<P>Another film from Veber that is full to the brim with original comic ideas.
Name one comedy that takes happens in one place, in a foreign language, and
that is incredibly funny. One of the best parts about The Dinner Game (besides
that cool looking animation that showcases the titles and credits for the film)
is the fact that while it's called The Dinner Game, there is no dinner or no
game at all. The film's comedy owes almost everything to Villeret, he's someone
you can just look at and laugh. When the film is remade in the US (with Robin
Williams as the idiot) it will probably lose all of the charm and the wit that
is featured here. The supporting cast is good, but it's obvious who's in the
center of attention. So, go see The Dinner Game while you can, this funny,
original, and interesting French comedy gets *** 1/2 stars.</P>
