<PRE>>From 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
2 stars</PRE>
<P>Snake Eyes is a perfect example of a cinematic roller coaster: the film
rises to an all time, thrilling high and then plummets right down into
dull and monotonous scenarios.   In fact, the only thing that director
Brian De Palma proves with this rather tame who done it is that he is a
better scene maker than he is a filmmaker.  Make no mistake - the first
half-hour or so of Snake Eyes is dynamite cinema.  And most of the rest
is absolute trash.</P>
<P>Nicholas Cage, one the screens most pleasing performers, and Gary
Sinise, a man who often brings third dimensions into 2D characters,
should have been together on screen a long time ago. It came as a
massive disappointment to me that these two fine actors - who share
between them such titles as The Rock, Face/Off, Forrest Gump and
Ransom - have chosen such a bumpy and inconsistent vehicle for their
first joint effort.</P>
<P>Cage is Rick Santoro, a gleeful American cop whose morals are easily
corrupted at the sight of dollar bills.  At a heavyweight championship
fight, Santoro is having a night off, and his best friend Naval
Commander Kevin Dunne (Sinise) is guarding the US Secretary of Defense.
Shots are fired from somewhere in the stadium - seconds after one of the
boxers gets knocked out - and Dunne is off chasing a suspicious red
head.  Another mysterious woman is at the scene, and gets showed by the
blood of the now shot Secretary.</P>
<P>De Palma begins the film with a lengthy sweeping shot of the stadium;
the cameras following Santoro everywhere as he moves around the venue.
Cinematographer Stephen Burum captures the atmosphere of the sports
arena perfectly, and De Palma never lets the excitement drop before
introducing the mystery.  And what a disappointing mystery it is, since
the screenwriters - De Palma and David Koepp (Jurassic Park, Men in
Black) - haven't written the film smartly enough to maintain a high
amount of tension, but smartly enough to add an occasional glimpse of
tension.  It's all pretty frustrating to watch, since Snake Eyes
constantly changes its pace and style; at one time being a heart-pumping
thriller and another a bland and predictable "thriller".</P>
<P>Perhaps the most daunting of all flaws in this film is its unsatisfying
and apathetic ending; where something as stupid as a change in weather
determines the fate of one particular character. Another commits
suicide, having spent the entire duration as a potentially interesting
character but still seems distanced from the audience.</P>
<P>If people are going to insist on continuing to compare Brian De Palma to
the late and great Alfred Hitchcock, they must remember that it takes a
great director to build a genuinely suspenseful, thrilling and exciting
scenario.  To keep that up for the entire film - now that would be
something special.</P>
