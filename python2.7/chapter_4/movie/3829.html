<PRE>                                  CLUELESS
                       A film review by Eric Grossman
                   Copyright 1995 LOS ANGELES INDEPENDENT</PRE>
<P>     There really isn't much to say about CLUELESS except that its
title pretty much explains it all.  Alicia Silverstone plays Cher,
Beverly Hills High's most popular "betty."  Cher realizes that her life
is without meaning and she tries to find fulfillment by using her
popularity to help others.  She takes the new girl in town, Tai
(Brittany Murphy), under her wing and helps her avoid falling in with
the "loadies" (stoners) and gives her a makeover so she won't be a
"monet" (a girl who looks fine from far away but is really a mess up
close).  She also gets her two teachers to "hang" with each other so
that they will raise her grades.  In addition to of this altruism, Cher
has classes to attend, driving tests to take, and shopping malls to
frequent.</P>
<P>     Amy Heckerling wrote and directed this movie so I guess we have to
give her the lion's share of credit for the movie's great contributions
to the English language (although some of it is like so 1980's you know)
as well as the film's completely inane plot.  Unlike FAST TIMES AT
RIDGEMONT HIGH, (which was also directed by Heckerling but written by
Cameron Crowe) CLUELESS is devoid of any sense of underlying truth.
The situations feel about as real as a bad sit-com and the characters,
except for Silverstone and Paul Rudd who plays her ex-step brother
Josh, are about as dimensional as a piece of cardboard.  This movie is
a satire of an already satirical image of rich brats from Beverly Hills
and one gets the feeling that Heckerling researched her script by
watching BEVERLY HILLS: 90210.</P>
<P>     While I was watching this movie, I was fortunate enough, or
unfortunate enough, to have a running commentary by a group of young
high school girls sitting behind me.  Although I didn't really care for
the film, save a few good lines of dialogue such as Cher's dad telling
her date to bring her home safely because he has "a .45 [pistol] and a
shovel," the vociferous high school barometers sitting behind me
seemed to enjoy CLUELESS quite a bit.  However, one girl did complain
that Silverstone's thighs were fat and the girl next to her thought the
actress was too flat chested.   Everyone's a critic these days.</P>
