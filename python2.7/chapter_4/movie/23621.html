<P>What are the top 5 best films of the year 2000. Well, admittedly its
still too early to start calling the shots. But be prepared for this
funny and charming little gem from director Stephen Frears, as it
already has my attention.</P>
<P>The story if about Rob Gordon (John Cusack), a thirty-something
entrepreneur and owner of a small used record store in downtown
Chicago. Now, Rob has a problem and that is, Laura (Iben Hjejle) his
live in girl friend of several years has moved out. Rob, heartbroken
and introspective tries to re-evaluate his love life.</P>
<P>That plot line, in and of itself is pretty nondescript. What makes
this film so enjoyably fresh is the marvelous script by Mr.'s
DeVincentis, Pink, Cusack, and Rosenberg. John Cusack as Rob Gordon
breaks the cinematic third wall, conversing with the audience
throughout the film. His self examination is both poignant and
revelatory. We are witness to a man, who has been unwilling to face
his life, coming to terms with his adolescence and his own immaturity.
Rob Gordon is just such a fascinating, human character. And Cusack's
performance is one of his best, equaling his turns in 'Grosse Point
Blank' and (one of my favorite films) 'Say Anything'.</P>
<P>There are so many surprises in the film, including but not limited to
uncredited performances by Tim Robbins (as Ian Raymond) and Catherine
Zeta-Jones (as former girlfriend Charlie Nicholson). But performances
are wonderfully timed comic turns, with Ms. Zeta-Jones turning a
trophy lover into a bittersweet shrew. The rest of the cast is also
remarkably good, with special credit to Jack Black (famed co-creator
of the fictional acoustic punk group 'Tenacious D'), who turns in one
of the funniest characters in recent years. What makes Barry (Jack
Black) so funny is that we recognize him immediately. Most of us have
had to deal with a retail clerk whose self importance and superiority
were insufferable, and Jack Black's performance is hilariously on
target in both its accuracy and self depreciation.</P>
<P>Lisa Bonet (as singer Marie DeSalle) is a revelation, both for her
performance and her singing (Her performance of "Baby, I Love Your
Way" is a revelation). This is a grand surprise and a welcome one.
Iben Hjejle as Laura has a soulful and graceful quality that lights up
the screen. Her performance is the emotional heart of the film. And as
such, gives greater resonance to Rob's acceptance of adulthood and
responsibility.</P>
<P>The screenplay by D.V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, John Cusack and Scott
Rosenberg is both knowingly funny and insightful. There is not a
wasted line or scene. Every moment of the film brings with it new
information to each of the characters and their situations. This may
just possibly be the best screenplay of this year. I cannot remember
any film recently (save for those by Woody Allen) that treats all of
its characters with such aplomb. Not even the most minor of supporting
roles is without its truth and honesty. And mention must be made of
some of the funniest and wittiest dialogue since 'Grosse Point Blank'
(also co-written by Mr.'s DeVincentis, Pink, and Cusack).</P>
<P>Stephan Frears (who's underrated "The Van" rates as one of 1996's best
films), has another grand inclusion to his resume here. His direction
of the film is marvelously subtle and subversive. Taking the technique
of breaking the barrier of the screen from 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off',
he reinvents it. Using it to force the audience to identify and
sympathize with the character of Rob Gordon. The mise-en-scène, strewn
with vinyl records and classic music, ranging from the '13th Floor
Elevators' "You're Gonna Miss Me" to a cameo by Bruce Springsteen as
an imaginary "pop" psychologist; is wondrous. I only hope that the
Academy® has a long memory come nomination time in 2001.</P>
<P>In conclusion, "High Fidelity" is one of the best surprises of the
pre-summer season. This is a film that will be laughed at and with. A
knowing and thoughtful film that will entertain anyone who's ever been
in love and lost. And knows all of the best songs to listen to while
they recover.</P>
