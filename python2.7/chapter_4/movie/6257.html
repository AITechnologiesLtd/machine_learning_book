<P>     In the adaptation of John Grisham's THE CHAMBER, Gene Hackman plays
Sam Cayhall, a dyed-in-the-wool, Confederate-flag-waving Klansman on death
row after being convicted of a 1967 racially-motivated bombing which left
two children dead.  His grandson Adam Hall (Chris O'Donnell), a Chicago
attorney, has arrived in Mississippi in an attempt to pull off a
last-minute appeal even though prospects appear dim.  As the film nears
its climax, Sam makes the long walk to the death watch cell past other
prisoners, and one by one we see and hear them wishing Sam well.  This
includes several black prisoners, one of whom offers Sam a peace sign.</P>
<P>     I may be no expert in the brotherhood of death row, but I'm going to
go out on a limb and suggest that there may be no love lost between black
inmates and an inmate who uses a certain "n" word with unapologetic
frequency.  Yet THE CHAMBER depends on such warm fuzziness when it comes
to matters of race, because its thinking is equally fuzzy.  Sam Cayhall
may be Klan, the script suggests, but he's good people; after all, he
tells his black guard (erstwhile pro baseball and football star Bo
Jackson) that he doesn't mean it personally when he refers to "your
people," and writes a letter to the mother of the boys who died in the
explosion.  More to the point, as Adam contends in his appeal, Sam had no
choice but to be a racist because of how he was raised.  It is one of THE
CHAMBER's many bits of convenient ignorance that Adam makes his plea with
absolute earnestness, despite the fact that his own father suffered and
struggled not to turn out like Sam.</P>
<P>     Of course, it may be that Chris O'Donnell knew no other way to make
that speech, because earnestness is the only emotional pitch in which he
seems capable of performing.  THE CHAMBER may toss around ideas about
racism, the politics of criminal justice and corruption in high places --
all pet peeves of Grisham's, if his oeuvre is any indication -- but
ultimately it really comes down to the face-offs between Hackman and
O'Donnell, and man oh man but O'Donnell is wrestling out of his weight
class.  There may be no more inconsequential actor in American films than
Chris O'Donnell, a pretty boy who makes you want to re-evaluate Keanu
Reeves as a multi-shaded thespian.  Watching O'Donnell try to drag an
inner life out of Adam Hall is like watching a puppy try to play Macbeth.</P>
<P>     Then there is Gene Hackman, an actor with the ability to make you sit
through nonsense like this just for the chance to watch him do his thing.
In many of his early scenes he is simply marvelous, tearing into Adam with
the practiced disdain of a man who has spent his life figuring out why
everyone else is responsible for his own misery.  His best moment comes in
a scene where he describes to Adam the death of another inmate in the gas
chamber, the horror of his likely fate sinking in with every word.  It is
a really little more than a piece of anti-death penalty propaganda, but
Hackman sells it with such conservation of emotion that it doesn't feel as
obvious as it should.  He makes that speech a statement about the feelings
of his character, which is the mark of a superior actor:  the words he
speaks are his.</P>
<P>     It is a shame then that Sam is obliged to turn into just the
grandfatherly sort he mocked Adam for believing him to be.  Films about
condemned killers have been all the rage lately, but THE CHAMBER is
both the most weightless and the most subtly offensive of them all,
because it is so disingenuous in its portrayal of Sam.  As the film
progresses, it seems that we are supposed to feel sorry for Sam, a man
raised on racism who has been set up to take the fall for a crime in which
he may not have been the key participant.  At the same time, we are aware
that he murdered the father of one of his son's friends, a black man, in
cold blood.  The fact that we are expected to root for Sam to get his
appeal because he may not have committed the _particular_ murder for which
he was convicted is enough to make you shiver when you think of Sam's line
that the Klan "should have stuck to the niggers."  THE CHAMBER is a film
which poses at social consciousness, then casts a black actress (Lela
Rochon) in the female lead only to strip the character of her romantic
relationship with Adam.  Gene Hackman is interested only in making Sam
Cayhall human; THE CHAMBER wants to make him lovable, to use racism as an
incendiary plot device then shrug it off as Sam makes his last long walk,
ready to do everything but shout "Power to the people!"</P>
