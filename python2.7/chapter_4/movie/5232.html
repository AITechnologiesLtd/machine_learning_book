<PRE>                                  SMOKE
                       A film review by Martin Rich
                        Copyright 1996 Martin Rich</PRE>
<P>In 1990 the novelist Paul Auster was stuck with a creative block.  The 
piece which broke that block was a brief Christmas story, about the 
proprietor of a tobacco shop in Brooklyn.  Now that story has spawned two 
films, 'Smoke', and its rather different follow-up 'Blue in the Face'.  
'Smoke', though dated 1994 in the credits, opened in the UK in mid-April 
this year.  Both films are credited to Auster and to the director Wayne 
Wang.</P>
<P>'Smoke' is built from a series of carefully thought out, intricately 
intertwined, stories.  The stories document a series of coincidences, and 
some intertwined lives, based around the people who pass through that 
tobacco shop.  Interestingly, the film is specifically set in 1990, the 
year when the Christmas story was published.</P>
<P>How autobiographical is it?  How much does the film play tricks on our 
imagination, by showing a writer and his character in conversation?  
Where Harvey Keitel's tobacconist tells William Hurt's author a story, is 
it a metaphor for the writer's creative process?  Does Paul Auster create 
his characters first, and then think about what might happen in their 
lives?</P>
<P>One, compelling, theme is the depth that can exist in everyday life.  
This is best illustrated by the series of photographs taken every 
morning: at first sight each street scene is the same, but a closer look 
reveals all sorts of differences from day to day.  The same is true of 
the stories in the film - all of them repay more than a cursory glance.  
Harold Perrineau Jr's Rashid (at least he's called Rashid in the credits) 
personifies this uncertainty, changing his name, his personality, how he 
fills his days according to whose company he is in.</P>
<P>But the greatest achievement of 'Smoke' is that it manages to be a warm, 
upbeat film without straying into blandness.  And its characters are 
optimistic and likeable without being part of any fictional, idealised, 
happy family; in fact there is deception and dishonesty galore.  It's 
well worth seeing.</P>
<P>One word of warning: don't leave the second that the first credits 
appear, because a significant part of the story is told over the first 
few credits.</P>
