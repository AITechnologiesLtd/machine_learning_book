<PRE>_Beloved_ (R) *** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Jonathan Demme's _Beloved_, based on Toni Morrison's Pulitzer
Prize-winning novel of the same name, is a movie of moments--moments of
raw, lyrical emotional power scattered over a nearly three-hour time
expanse.  While the extended running time does little to dilute the potency
of these isolated moments, it does, however, blunt the dramatic urgency of
the assembled story.  Instead of cutting deep into the heart, _Beloved_
pierces the heart; the film is indeed moving, but lacking the momentum to
make a sweeping emotional impact.</P>
<P>_Beloved_ is named after a character in the story, a mysterious young
woman (Thandie Newton) who shows up in the yard of Sethe (Oprah Winfrey)
one morning in 1873.  Sethe is a runaway slave trying to provide a decent
living for herself and her daughter Denver (Kimberly Elise) on the
outskirts of Cleveland, Ohio.  With the arrival of old friend Paul D (Danny
Glover) and, later, the childlike Beloved (whom she takes in), Sethe's life
appears to be taking a turn for the better, but the secrets of her tortured
past refuse to rest in peace.</P>
<P>It is my understanding that the screenplay, credited to Akosua Busia,
Richard LaGravenese, and Adam Brooks, is remarkably faithful to Morrison's
narrative structure.  In theory, fidelity to source material is a good
thing, but it does not completely work here.  Often, watching _Beloved_
feels like reading a book--a good thing if one is indeed reading, but not
necessarily what one is looking for when watching a film.  Although the
basics of Morrison's story and her characters are compelling, not much
really _happens_--at least not enough to sustain the 172-minute running
time.  As such, the memorable moments--and there are quite a number of
powerful ones, particularly some harrowing, hard-to-watch flashbacks of the
young Sethe's (Lisa Gay Hamilton) horrific past--are a bit too widespread
to make an assembled effect.  Any emotional response to any given moment
exists independently of any other.</P>
<P>Still, I must give Demme and the writers credit for the risks they take.
In duplicating Morrison's timeline-jumping structure, they demand an
inordinant amount of concentration from the viewer, and very few films
present such a fascinating challenge.  And while the structure and stately
pace work against the building of narrative momentum, they create a
haunting--or, rather, _haunted_--atmosphere.  Most of the key action in
_Beloved_ takes place in the past, and the film makes an uncanny
duplication of the seemingly cyclical nature of memories in one's mind,
revealing its secrets little by little, fragment by fragment, leaving
certain events only to retrace and expand on them later.  Granted, this
technique makes a lot of the action hard to follow, sometimes frustratingly
so, but it creates a feeling that is rich and unique.  Also unique is how
Demme isn't afraid to show the grimy nature of life in the time period;
instead of giving everything a shiny Hollywood sheen, the dirt and grit is
always there, on the sets and even the actors.</P>
<P>Also extending to the cast is this element of risk.  Taking the most
chances is Newton, who delivers a raw, unpredictable performance.  Called
upon to bare body and soul, adopt maladroit body movements and slurred
speech rhythms, she could have easily come off as ridiculously overwrought
and alien, but her soulful eyes consistently project a tempering humanity.
Not to be outdone, of course, is Winfrey.  People forget that before she
became a daytime TV phenomenon, she first made a name of herself as an
Oscar-nominated actress (for _The_Color_Purple_), and her work here is
restrained and, as such, the more emotionally honest; the same goes for
Glover.  But the standout performer is the one who will likely be the most
overlooked--Elise.  She doesn't have a role as literally showy as Newton's,
nor does she have the star power of a Winfrey or Glover, but she
is_Beloved_'s steadying force.  Denver has the most dramatic evolution out
of all the characters (from shut-in to independent woman), yet remains the
most stable; the key is to not play the change as if it were dramatic but
natural.  Elise's performance is so natural that it is easy to forget she
is an actress playing a part.</P>
<P>_Beloved_ is a wearying film, and that comment should be interpreted in
all the ways it can be.  On the positive side, the filmmakers so
successfully create the intended air of melancholy that it is daunting.
But on the negative end, one cannot help but feel exhausted, emotionally
and physically, after three slow hours.  Similarly, by that time the film
is also exhausted.  I was indeed be moved by _Beloved_, but in the end,
there wasn't enough momentum left to truly sweep me away, as it should have.</P>
