<P>   You don't have to be Argentinian to be quite proficient in
the tango.  Nor do you have to concentrate on the dance to
the exclusion of all other skills.  Ask Sally Potter, hardly a
household name, known to many movie buffs exclusively for
her direction of the remarkable arthouse fare, "Orlando."  Her
choice of subject there--a woman who lived four hundred
years first as a man and later as a woman--indicates that Ms.
Potter is no champion of bland, commercial films.  Who would
have known, though, that Sally Potter is not only a gifted
director but a consummate dancer, a composer of song, and
a performer who can swap a confident countenance for the
gaze of a possessive lover?  </P>
<P>   "The Tango Lesson," which stars first-class dancer Pablo
Veron as Pablo and Sally Potter as Sally--the use of real
names manifests an autobiographical base--is both an
occasional for an open-mouthed appreciation of spectacular
hoofing and a sentimental romance about two middle-aged
people who discover that they are soul mates despite their
outward differences.  Though Sally is a Londoner and Pablo
an expatriate Argentinian living in Paris, they both speak
fluent French and English and learn, surprisngly, that they
share an affinity for Judaism. As Sally says, exchanging a
sentimental tear with her partner, "I suppose I'm an atheist but
I feel like a Jew."
   The film begins as Sally considers an assignment to write
an original screenplay, her walls as white as the blank paper
which confronts her.  Our insight into her wild imagination is
bumped as the camera shifts to glorious color, displaying
three fashion models, one of whom is chased by wheelchair-
bound, legless man who fires a shot, apparently killing her. 
We find out later that her film is to be about a designer who
becomes envious of the attention which the media focus on
the models.  Wandering into a Paris concert featuring a tango
performance of Pablo and his long-term partner played by
Carolina Iotti, she is mesmerized and cuts a deal with Pablo. 
If he will teach her the tango, she will feature him in her next
movie.  From there, "The Tango Lesson" is divided into
vignettes called "the second lesson," "the third lesson," etc.
blending exhibits of the dance with a personal story, as Pablo
and Sally become romantically involved with each other. 
Attempting to sell her idea to a couple of Hollywood
producers, she is told by them--amid a stereotypically comical
background of a large, Hollywood swimming pool presided
over by a couple of movie sharks--that she should use stars
rather than unknowns, situate the film in New York, and forget
about using French because with a foreign language "you'll
lose 75% of the audience, minimum."  
   The tension apparently comes from Sally's insistence on
leading Pablo while they are on the dance floor just as she is
accustomed to doing when directing her movies.  The tension
in her shoulders about which Pablo complains is interpreted
by him as a desire to dominate the relationship, but while this
aspect is meant to be at the core of "The Tango Lesson," it
simply does not come across.  When the two perform on
stage, ostensibly after she has had only twelve lessons, they
look spectacular and garner a rousing tribute from the
audience.  Pablo's motivations are obscure.  Is he really
annoyed at her dominance or does he seek an excuse to end
their relationship?  Potter's use of black-and-white for the bulk
of the picture seems pretentious rather than effective.  
   "The Tango Lesson" succeeds more as a semi-
documentary on that remarkable dance than as a romance,
though any amour between middle-aged people should be
welcomed in a youth-obsessed cinema.  You come away with
the knowledge that tango, like flamenco, can be performed in
both its a traditional and authentic variety on a crowded dance
floor and as a sexy bit of footwork meant for the stage
featuring coded, suggestive steps.  You also come away
appreciating Sally Potter's talent as not only the director of
"Orlando," a story about a Renaissance woman, but as a
Renaissance woman herself.  Rated PG.  Running Time: 101
minutes.  (C) 1997 Harvey Karten</P>
