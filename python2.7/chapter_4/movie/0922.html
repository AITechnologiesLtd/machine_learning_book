<PRE>                             SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY
                       A film review by Roger Snappy Rubio
                        Copyright 1991 Roger Snappy Rubio</PRE>
<P>     Thanks to 20th Century Fox, I had the chance to see SLEEPING WITH
THE ENEMY before its release.  It stars Julia Roberts as a young
housewife who is married to a man who both physically and emotionally
abuses her.  In order to escape, during a small trip out to sail, she
fakes her own drowning, and then proceeds to change her entire
appearance and identity.  She then moves to Iowa, where she becomes
involved with another man, who is not totally oblivious to the
mysterious manner about her.  Her husband eventually gets indications
that she is still alive, and proceeds to track her down.</P>
<P>     This film is expertly executed, with all the necessary
doom-impending camera angles and dim lights, and if one has seen a lot
of thrillers, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY could be considered
run-of-the-mill.  One recent thriller this film may be compared to is
PACIFIC HEIGHTS which, although having a different plot outline, has the
same basic thrills.  My attempt here is not to belittle this film; in my
opinion, in most respects it is better than PACIFIC HEIGHTS (one
respect, for example, is the thriller-lover's favorite: how they get rid
of the baddie at the end).  It is a well-planned and an altogether
convincing film that one should not miss if on likes a good thriller.
Julia Roberts delivers a admirable performance as the tortured wife of
this man she so desperately wants to get away from.  Joseph Ruben as a
director effectively manages to contribute something if not the same
type of thrills over again to the thriller genre, although in my opinion
this was not a great contribution.</P>
<P>     Don't get me wrong--all in all, as far as thrillers go, this one is
good.  If there is anyone out there who goes to the movies to latch on
to some character to hate, then this movie is definitely for them.  It
manages to show how the good intentions of some people manages to
further the bad intentions of other people.  In layman's terms, I would
consider this movie to be a popcorn-crunching movies; if you buy a bag
before the show, I assure you it will be gone by the end.</P>
