<PRE>                                HOCUS POCUS
                   A film review by David N. Butterworth
        Copyright 1993 David N. Butterworth/The Summer Pennsylvanian</PRE>
<P>     Touchstone Pictures, an offshoot of the Walt Disney Studios, was
established partly to showcase films of a slightly more adult nature.
But its latest release, a corny, slapstick affair called HOCUS POCUS,
is strictly for kids.</P>
<P>     Bette Midler, Kathy Najimy, and Sarah Jessica Parker play the
Sanderson sisters, three Salem witches circa 1693.  So broad are their
performances that HOCUS POCUS often feels like a high school theatrical
production--and not a particularly good one at that.</P>
<P>     Midler's Winifred looks like a cross between a hamster and
Margaret Thatcher on steroids.  Sporting diabolical costumes and
devilish hairdos, this Miss M is anything but divine.  Bette's scenery
chewing histrionics include an obligatory musical number, "I Put a
Spell on You," although the Screamin' Jay Hawkins' original seemed more
integral to the plot in Jim Jarmusch's STRANGER THAN PARADISE.</P>
<P>     Najimy gets less mileage out of her role as Mary Sanderson.  Much
as you would expect from an actress whose previous performance was that
of a fat nun in SISTER ACT, Najimy plays a big broad with a big nose.
Mary's a little simple, but delights in that fact that she can smell
children a mile away.  Food for thought indeed.</P>
<P>     But Parker steals the show as Sarah, a squeaky femme fatale with
long, blond, Rapunzel-like hair and blackly made-up eyes.  Her
alluring, boy-crazy bimbo is a treat for this or any other Halloween.</P>
<P>     Three hundred years after the sisters are hanged for witchcraft,
three young trick-or-treaters sneak into the deserted Sanderson
domicile and unwittingly bring our ghoulish gals back to life.  This
they achieve by lighting the black flame candle--the deal is the
spirits will return if the candle is lit by a virgin on Halloween
night.  And boy do the producers milk *that* joke for all its worth!</P>
<P>     As it so happens, Winnie, Mary and Sarah can stay young forever by
eating the town's children, or turn into dust when the sun rises,
whichever comes first.  With the help of a talking cat, Binx, the three
kids try to undo their egregious error and condemn these Sisters of
Satan to eternal damnation once and for all.</P>
<P>     Omri Katz plays the young hero Max Dennison, Thora Birch is his
annoying kid sister Dani, and teen heartthrob Vinessa Shaw is the one
with the "yobbos."  (Remember.  HOCUS POCUS is a family film; this is
easily the dirtiest word spoken in the entire movie).  They're a
tried-and-true bunch of semi-likable, smart-alecky movie kids whose
parents tend to act younger than they do.</P>
<P>     Predictably, that oft-used plot device--strange-looking outsiders
can pass virtually unnoticed on Halloween night--comes in quite handy
here.  It is best utilized in a brief scene with Don Yesso (from TV's
FRANK'S PLACE).  He plays a bus driver who "picks up" the three hags
and gets some of the film's biggest chuckles in the process.</P>
<P>     There are bubbling cauldrons and a magical spell book and a zombie
that keeps losing its head and cinematic prestidigitations and
overacting like crazy but it's all in good, clean, laugh-out-loud fun.</P>
<P>     You're more likely to laugh out loud if you're under thirteen,
however.  THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK it ain't.</P>
<P>     Director Kenny Ortega has a lot riding on this film, as his only
other directorial effort was the disastrous movie musical, NEWSIES.
HOCUS POCUS was reputed to have cost $28 million--high for a Disney
production--and it makes sense when you realize the cat stand-ins
alone (all eight of them) earned $200 a day!  What *doesn't* make sense
is why they are releasing this holiday film now, at the height of the
summer.</P>
<P>     In any case, the money doesn't really show on the screen.  The
effects are downright cheesy, especially the talking cat, whose
computer-animated facial expressions look worse than if they'd spread
peanut butter on its lips.  Everything looks cheap and obvious, from
the suspended-on-wires flying broomstick sequences to the
electricity-from-the-fingers that Winifred uses to keep the kids in
place.  The set design is elaborate and fanciful, giving the haunted
Sanderson house the look and feel of something out of HANSEL AND
GRETEL, but the whole fabricated fantasy wobbles precariously between
high-tech and low-cost.</P>
<P>     "We're talking about three ancient hags versus the twentieth
century!" exclaims Max exasperatedly at one point during the movie.
"How bad can it be?"</P>
<PRE>     Someone had to ask... .</PRE>
