<P>     MICROCOSMOS is a delightful little documentary -- emphasis on 
little.  This film offers a view into a world more bizarre than anything 
depicted in the most special effects-intensive science fiction.  
Intrigued?  Well, if not, you will be once you start watching 
MICROCOSMOS, Claude Nuridsany and Marie Perennou's fascinating portrait 
of life "beyond anything we could imagine, and yet almost beneath our 
notice." </P>
<P>     MICROCOSMOS literally has a cast of thousands -- insects, that is.  
Beetles, ants, bees, wasps, dragonflies, butterflies, snails, 
mosquitoes, darning needles, and dozens of other assorted bugs fill the 
screen, going about their everyday chores.  They build nests, find food, 
pollinate flowers, battle over territory, and procreate.  For viewers 
with spiritual inclinations, there's a fair amount of quasi-religious 
imagery:  mantises that pray and bugs that walk on water.   </P>
<P>     The microscopic drama of MICROCOSMOS is surprisingly engrossing, 
primarily because of the exquisite detail of the photography.  Nuridsany 
and Perennou's cameras take us from normal-scale overviews of their 
locale deep into the world of the insects, where blades of grass are as 
tall as houses, trees are unimaginably large, and lakes become oceans.  
Everything is shown up close and personal, with a level of clarity and 
intimacy never previously obtained in nature films.   </P>
<P>     Although no people are ever shown, nor is there any indication of 
their presence (the specially-created cameras take us closer to the 
ground than any eye could get), there is a human voice in MICROCOSMOS.  
It belongs to Kristin Scott-Thomas, who gives short, unnecessary 
introductory and closing statements.  In between, the only noises we 
hear are the whirs, buzzes, and chirps of the starring creatures.  
That's over an hour of nothing but the sounds of nature. </P>
<P>     MICROCOSMOS uses time lapse photography to speed along certain slow 
processes -- a caterpillar inching its way along a branch, a vine 
snaking skywards, blossoms opening, and a sundew enveloping its helpless 
victim.  There are a few cameos by non-insects as well.  We see a 
pheasant attack an ant colony with predictably disastrous results for 
the tiny warriors.  Then there's a frog who chooses a group of water 
bugs for an afternoon snack. </P>
<P>     Transpiring in a specially created "field studio" in Aveyron, 
France, MICROCOSMOS took three years to film and six months to edit, but 
the results more than justify the necessary time, effort, and patience.  
At only seventy-seven minutes, this is one of the shortest movies of 
1996, but it offers some of the most unique images, surpassing the fine 
LEOPARD SON with its perspective of life in the wild.  After watching 
MICROCOSMOS, it will be impossible to take a walk in the woods without 
being aware of the amazing tapestry of activity going on all around, yet 
out of sight. </P>
