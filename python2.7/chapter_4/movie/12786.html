<PRE>THE TRUMAN SHOW
reviewed by Josh Schirmer

* * * * * out of * * * * *</PRE>
<P>A movie that's been as highly built up as the Truman Show, with reviews
boasting, "The film of the decade!" and "A breakthrough!" can only be
leading up to letdown. That's no doubt -- it seems any movie with
critical acclaim makes you think you're going in for the ride of your
life, that you'll end up changed on the other side, and you come out of
the theater going, "Eh... *that's* what all the fuss was about?"</P>
<P>So, naturally, The Truman Show was building up to what was going to be a
dissapointment. And I convinced myself, as I nestled into my
uncomfortable movie theater chair, actually to TRY not to enjoy it.</P>
<P>Let me tell you, that is an impossibilty.</P>
<P>The Truman Show is truly "the film of the decade" and "a breakthrough"
and MORE. And you will come out changed on the other side. Such a movie
comes around only once in a lifetime, where you find yourself feeling
everything that the character is feeling, and this, friends, is IT. Jim
Carrey shows that he doesn't need to talk out of his butt to entertain
us; that he can be as dramatic as any of Hollywood's leading men.</P>
<P>The film has a difficult premise to tackle, trying to set us up thirty
years into the "Truman Show's" run, but tackle it it does, and
perfectly. With flashbacks actually being flashbacks on the television
show, you get the sense that you are viewing a *real* prime-time hit.
And the way the camera constantly takes the forms it would in the "real"
Truman Show is clever and well-done.</P>
<P>People, rejoice! This is the FIRST Oscar-worthy film of not only this
year, but of the last five years. Not since "Schindler's List" has a
movie captured human spirit and true despair so well. This is a classic
in the making, and (to borrow a line from Esquire's review) it stars Jim
Carrey. Nothing in his career to date and nothing he can do in the
future will ever be able to top his role as Truman Burbank; mark my
word. For, as I said, this is the movie of a lifetime and the role is of
the same calibre.</P>
<P>Forget special-effect ladden summer fodder. Drop your romantic comedies
in the trash. Toss your thrillers and teen flicks on the pile. You need
nothing more than "The Truman Show" to carry you through the summer, or
for that matter, the year.</P>
<P>Oh! And in case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening, and
goodnight.</P>
