<P>RUSH HOUR
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: ** (out of ****)
New Line / 1:40 / 1998 / PG-13 (language, ethnic slurs, violence, child 
in peril)
Cast: Chris Tucker; Jackie Can; Elizabeth Pena; Tom Wilkinson; Philip 
Baker Hall; Mark Rolston; Tzi Ma; Rex Linn; Ken
Leung; Chris Penn 
Director: Brett Ratner 
Screenplay: Jim Kouf; Ross Lamanna <HR>Rarely does one's opinion of a film hang exclusively around their 
tolerance for its lead actor, but such is the case with "Rush Hour." The 
star in question is Chris Tucker, that manic motormouth to end all manic 
motormouths whose turns in "The Fifth Element" and "Money Talks" left 
audiences in convulsion fits - either they were on the floor laughing or 
having seizures induced by his helium-high voice. Yes, Chris Tucker is 
back and wound-up tighter than ever, and those who enjoy his bug-eyed 
ballistics can walk into theatres completely free of anxiety. Enjoying 
"Rush Hour," however, might be another matter entirely. </P>
<P>For the record, I don't mind Tucker much at all. Sure, he can be as 
irksome as fingernails on a blackboard at times, but so could Jim Carrey 
back in his pre-"Truman Show" days. Rather, the problem with him in 
"Rush Hour" is that his squealy self and frantic antics just don't sit 
well with the role he's playing - a rogue LAPD detective named James 
Carter. Check out the opening scene (which genre fans know has 
ultimately _very_little_ to do with the rest of the film), in which 
Carter takes part in a sting operation to trap an explosives dealer. Um, 
could he or his cop-endangering shtick be any harder to swallow?</P>
<P>"Rush Hour" becomes a little more palatable once Jackie Chan enters the 
picture, cast as a Hong Kong inspector who teams up with Carter to crack 
the kidnaping of the Chinese Consul's 11-year-old daughter, a case that 
spans their respective countries. Chan fans might be disappointed by how 
little the master martial artist gets to simultaneously display his 
flair for physical comedy and killer moves; a scene where he battles bad 
guys while protecting the priceless exhibits in an art museum is classic 
Chan, a scene where his Carter-inspired use of a racial epithet gets him 
in trouble in a bar full of African-Americans is not. </P>
<P>That bit aside, "Rush Hour"'s humor of choice seems to be disparaging 
quips directed at Asians ("I've been lookin' for your sweet-and-sour 
chicken a--!" Carter screeches to a Chinese bad guy); it wouldn't be 
funny if it were the other way around, and it's not funny the way it is. 
Much more successful is the film's comedy when it plays up the culture 
clash between Chan and Tucker; this star and star-on-the-rise have a 
nice rapport both on-screen and off, the latter evidenced by the 
now-notorious Chan tradition of showing outtakes over the end credits. 
Here, it's good stuff worth sticking around for, especially when the two 
slip up together. </P>
<P>The title must refer to a gridlock of cliches instead of cars -- not 
only do we get the mismatched-buddy-cop story, we also get the 
fish-out-of-water and renegade-man-of-the-law angles and a climactic 
red-wire-or-blue-wire moment to top everything off. Though nobody will 
presumably accuse "Rush Hour" of breaking new cinematic ground, it's a 
tad on the disheartening side that this match made in odd couple heaven 
fails to enhance the familiar plot motions to memorable lengths. If 
you're a praying person, get on your knees - then, maybe Chan and Tucker 
will get a screenplay that's up to their collective speed in the 
inevitable "Rush Hour 2."<HR>© 1998 Jamie Peck
