********* SPOILERS *********</PRE>
<P>Dialogue rehash:
"You're either incredibly smart or incredibly stupid."</P>
<P>        In this latest Jerry Bruckheimer/Touchstone Pictures offering,
Hollywood again repeats itself, but in a kickbutt fashion.  "Enemy of the
State," like any other Jerry Bruckheimer popcorn film, highly entertains. 
This one even more so because it capitalizes on the recent rise of paranoia
as seen on television's "The X-Files," silver screen's "Conspiracy Theory"
(note the plot similarities), "The Net," and "Most Wanted" (starring,
coincidentally, Jon Voight as the baddie).  I loved Gene Hackman as the
gruff, seasoned expert Brill (see Sean Connery in "The Rock") and Will
Smith as the reluctant hero Robert Dean (erm, see Nicholas Cage in "The
Rock").  The characters come to life in emotionally-powered scenes like
Smith's confrontation with Hackman in the elevator, Smith's fight with
Regina King (the wifey).  While the transition of Brill from antagonistic
and unsympathetic to reluctantly friendly paralleled Connery's character a
bit too much for my liking, I ended up rooting for the old man anyways. 
The only character I didn't like was Rachel Banks, partly because of the
way the actress played her.  She seemed too artificial, too forced.  Jon
Voight was convincing, way too convincing as the villain.  I think he should
quit playing these power-hungry high government officials for a while.</P>
<P>        Plotwise, the movie was actually okay.  The action was intense, not
too many plotholes, except having to listen to those two annoying tech
geeks spew off information we already have in a, well, nerdy manner.  For
example, "changing the configuration of Dean's packages" means "a bulge
appeared in Dean's packages."  That seemed dumb, but I assume the extra
dialogue was inserted to give the movie an extra anxiety-factor.  Like
many others I found the ending was the biggest copout, but gee I shouldn't
be surprised given the shootout at the end of "The Rock."  Scott Rosenberg
strikes again.  Despite losing points for lack of originality and "borrowing"
scenes, the tailor-made blockbuster "Enemy of the State" will definitely
satisfy your weekend craving for fast-paced action.  This is what
Bruckheimer does best, ain't it?</P>
<P>"Why are they putting things in my shoe?!"</P>
<P>Rating: B- (First viewing, 11/20/98)</P>
<P>* I'm amused how all the high-tech centers in movies look the same.  For
example, the NSA headquarters here looks a lot like Tommy Lee Jones's
office in "Volcano" and the MIB headquarters in "Men In Black."</P>
<P>* EE fans: didn't the cat and Brill remind you of the cat and Snow?</P>
