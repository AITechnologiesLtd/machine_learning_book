<PRE>        "It's like nothing you've ever seen before!"</PRE>
<P> That phrase used to be fairly commonplace in movie promotion,
but with the truth-in-advertising laws, it's rarely applied to anything
these days. The fact is, after enduring decades of 3-D films,
Sensurround epics, Cinemascope, gigantic IMAX visuals, digital stereo
and even the short-lived Smell-A-Vision, most audiences can't imagine
there's anything new under the sun.</P>
<P> But "Dinosaur" is truly like nothing you've ever seen before.</P>
<P> If your primary experiences with computer animation were "Antz"
and the "Toy Story" movies, you owe it to yourself to take a look at
"Dinosaur," just to appreciate how far this relatively new art has
already progressed. You'll find a styrachosaur with skin that ripples,
lemurs with fur that ruffles in the breeze and bloodthirsty raptors that
move with an almost alarming dexterity. The action takes place against
rich, vividly detailed backgrounds and it's followed closely by cameras
that can effortlessly zoom along the ground, swoop into the sky and
plunge into a river.</P>
<P> The fluidity and gracefulness of this work makes the similar
effects in "Jurassic Park" and "The Lost World" seem almost clunky by
comparison; there's even a none-too-subtle jab at Steven Spielberg's
epics about two-thirds of the way through the movie. By the time
"Dinosaur" offers us the sight of seemingly hundreds of homeless
dinosaurs moving wearily across the desert in search of water and food,
it's likely you will have forgotten the creations you're watching are
not real, living, breathing creatures. The five years of work producer
Pam Marsden (a Kalamazoo College graduate) and her team of animators
have put into the film pay off magnificently: The illusion captivates us
completely.</P>
<P> Like "Titanic," "Dinosaur" is basically a very simple tale made
compelling by astounding technology. Since this is, after all, a Disney
film, there's a hero who doesn't fit in with his peers (see "Tarzan,"
"Hercules," etc.), a character-building journey toward self-discovery
(as in "Mulan," "Pocahontas," "The Hunchback of Notre Dame") and a
climactic face-off with a terrifying villain, in this case, a savage
carnotaur with a theater-rattling roar.</P>
<P> The carnotaurs and the raptors don't speak, but everyone else
does, and the script sometimes strains to be reassuringly jokey, one of
the film's few real weaknesses. On the plus side, we are spared any
musical interludes. There's not even an anthem slapped on the end
credits -- hurrah!</P>
<P> The plot of "Dinosaur" revolves around Aladar (voice by D.B.
Sweeney), a compassionate young iguanodon who grows up among a playful
family of lemurs after being stolen from his crib and deposited by a
pterodactyl on a remote island. When his home is destroyed by a
spectacularly rendered meteor shower, Aladar and the surviving lemurs
make their way to the mainland and join up with scores of fellow
refugees being led to a new nesting ground by the surly Kron (Samuel E.
Wright) and his gruff partner Bruton (Peter Siragusa). Like some sort of
prehistoric cult leader, Kron drives his troops mercilessly and demands
complete loyalty, although his sister Neera (Julianna Margulies)
eventually tires of his stern single-mindedness and opts to follow the
more compassionate Aladar.</P>
<P> With less than 90 minutes in which to tell its story,
"Dinosaur" zooms along, maintaining a relatively high level of intensity
for a Disney drama. The vicious attacks by the carnotaurs and the
raptors are guaranteed to get viewers on the edges of their seats and
parents should be warned they are not entirely bloodless. Although
"Dinosaur" isn't the relentlessly scary experience the last half of
"Jurassic Park" was, the movie's PG rating is well-deserved.</P>
<P> The movie cushions the shocks somewhat with the comforting
presence of grandmotherly brachiosaur Baylene, who speaks in the
beguiling British tones of Joan Plowright, and her friend Eema, a
styrachosaur with the earth-mama voice of Della Reese. When one of the
lemurs hitches on a ride on top of Eema, she bellows, "That's just what
I need -- a monkey on my back," and Reese's reading makes the pun much
funnier than it should be.</P>
<P> What will rope most viewers -- especially kids -- into seeing
"Dinosaur" more than once is not the humor, however. It will be the
sheer spectacle of the film, the brilliance of the animation, the
glorious, all-encompassing sound and the thrill of sitting spellbound in
the dark alongside hundreds of other moviegoers while you discover a
wondrous new frontier of filmmaking. Even with the best home theater
system money can buy, that kind of excitement is impossible to recreate
in your living room, and that's why millions will be lining up at their
local theater to savor the "Dinosaur" experience this weekend. James
