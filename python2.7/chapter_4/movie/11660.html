<P>   "The Real Blonde" is a very New York movie, though its
principal conceits would make it feel right at home in L.A.  A
sendup of slickness for its own sake, Tom DiCillo's
marvelously realized work sometimes flirts with the very
slickness it parodies, but DiCillo--whose previous film "Living
in Oblivion" was looser in design and not as ambitious--
remains almost uncompromisingly independent and original.   
Highlighting a central relationships which is headed for the
rocks, "The Real Blonde" hosts a large cast playing hilariously
written roles, which are well acted and contribute mightily
toward making this a spiny film about the absurdities of
artifice and the need for a more natural way of living.</P>
<P>   As the plot's center, Joe (Matthew Modine) is a flawed
human being living together with a perfectly stable woman,
Mary (Catherine Keener), who ironically is undergoing
psychotherapy for hostilities which she has every right to
possess.  After all, how should any woman feel when each
day she is verbally attacked by the bum on the street corner
and has to cope with a steady who at the age of 35 has little
concept of reality?  For his part Joe considers himself a
serious actor, though he has no credits and no agent, yet
does not want to consider roles in soap operas or anything of
less artistic merit than "Death of a Salesman."  As the movie
meanders along, introducing a multiplicity of persons along
the way, we realize where the story is headed.  Joe and
Mary's relationship will either fall apart under the pressures of
both the outside society and their inner differences, or they
will enjoy a happy reconciliation when Joe has his feet no
longer planted firmly in midair.</P>
<P>   And oh what an assortment of oddballs and curious
situations they encounter during the course of the comedy! 
DiCillo has a ball taking aim on the popular culture of high
fashion, MTV, and soaps, displaying before us a host of
people who are all unhappy despite the glamorous positions
in which they find themselves.  Why should Joe's strikingly
handsome, well-spoken friend Bob (Maxwell Caulfield) feel
that his life is useless unless he can bed a blonde--a real
blonde, that is?  And would Doug (Denis Leary), a instructor
in self-defense techniques for women, be expected to have
contempt for the very clients he is trying to help in their
struggle against exploitative men?  Some of the best scenes
in the film point out ironies like these, and do so with style
and grand humor.  In one such episode Ernst (Christopher
Lloyd--who is best known for his role as a scientist in "Back to
the Future") is a grouchy, unsmiling headwaiter in a fancy
catering establishment who chews out one of his staff for
looking like a zombie.  In another, Kelly (Daryl Hannah), quick
to threaten suicide in a soap opera she is filming with Bob,
acts hardly the vulnerable type in her real life affair with the
male star.  </P>
<P>   The highlight of this well-written script features a
confrontation between Joe and the set manager of an MTV
routine featuring a Madonna lookalike (Elizabeth Berkley) and
a host of beach boys in shorts who are all directed to do a
double-take when the international star passes through their
ranks.  When the African-American man with the bullhorn
suggests to two impressionable actors on the set that the
Holocaust was a myth, Joe confronts the jerk with a smile on
his face, incongruously suggesting that slavery was likewise a
fraud: that Africans came to American shores during and after
the 17th Century simply because they wanted better jobs
working in the cotton fields.  He gets fired for his mock views,
the writer-director suggesting that speaking your mind is not
always in everyone's best interest in a culture that virtually
worships anorectic and absurd Versace-type fashion models
like one such person, Sahara (Bridgette Wilson), who
considers "The Little Mermaid" the ultimate in spiritual
moviemaking.</P>
<P>   In other vignettes Marlo Thomas comes across in a
whimsical manner as a high-profile fashion photographer who,
when discovering that her chief model has come in with a
black eye, has similar bruises painted on her other models
while photographing them with large snakes wrapped about
their limbs, rose petals dropping to their laps.</P>
<P>   Matthew Modine, perhaps the least sexy young person in
this world of artifice, is perfectly cast as a guy who gets a
belated start in his career only by dropping his standards but
who parlays his work into a serious calling once his foot is in
the door.  Denis Leary, Daryl Hannah, and Buck Henry help
realize the director's vision by showing themselves for what
they really are and how they really feel about the people they
work with: and what they really are is anything but nice.
"The Real Blonde" has a plot line that is not tight enough to
give it a widespread market but will appeal immensely to all
who can appreciate its sharp, urban humor. Not Rated. 
Running time: 105 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten 1998</P>
