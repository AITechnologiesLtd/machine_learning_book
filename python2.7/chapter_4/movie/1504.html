<PRE>                     WILD ORCHID 2: TWO SHADES OF BLUE
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>111 min., not rated, Drama, 1992
Director: Zalman King
Cast: Wendy Hughes, Tom Skerritt, Robert Davi, Brent Fraser,
      Nina Siemaszko, Christopher McDonald, Joe Dallesandro,
      Casey Sander, Stafford Morgan, Don Bloomfield, Lydie Denier</P>
<P>     Nina Siemaszko's father Tom Skerritt, an avid drug user, dies.
Siemaszko ends up working at a whorehouse.  Robert Davi, who does odd
jobs at a whorehouse, gets interested in Siemaszko.   Siemaszko sees a
high school boy who she is interested in, but she doesn't know how to
tell him what her profession is.</P>
<P>     WILD ORCHID 2: TWO SHADES OF BLUE is the latest film by erotic film
maker Zalman King, who's past films include WILD ORCHID and TWO MOON
JUNCTION.  WILD ORCHID 2 is not really a sequel to WILD ORCHID, in fact
it has nothing to do with WILD ORCHID.  The only thing that links the
film together at all is the fact that Zalman King directed both.  I
enjoyed WILD ORCHID, but I hated WILD ORCHID 2.  Everything that WILD
ORCHID had, this didn't.  WILD ORCHID 2: TWO SHADES OF BLUE is also
available in a less explicit R rated version.  On a scale of zero to
five, I give WILD ORCHID 2 a one.  WILD ORCHID 2 is unrated and contains
female nudity, explicit language, strong sexual content, and adult
situations.</P>
<P>     The one thing that keeps WILD ORCHID 2 from being a total waste is
that its cast is excellent.  Tom Skerritt, who gets top billing, is only
on the screen for about fifteen minutes.   Unfortunately the story isn't
up to the original, in fact it is far from it.  In WILD ORCHID, I found
the story interesting (as well as erotic).  WILD ORCHID 2 skips the
interesting and just tries to be erotic, where it fails miserably.  My
suggestion is to skip this film and rewatch WILD ORCHID.  The story,
such as it is, is muddled and not everything is explained.  Things that
happen don't always make sense and are often confusing.  This film seems
to have no real reason for existing, and I am not quite sure why it ever
was made.</P>
