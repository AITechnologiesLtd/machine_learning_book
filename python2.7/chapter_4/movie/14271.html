<P>Based on advertisements alone, it would be easy to mistake "One True 
Thing" for just another tearjerker, but the film is actually much more 
than that. Written and acted with a remarkable sense of detail, this rich 
drama investigates one of life's most baffling mysteries: how our 
parent's marriages work.   </P>
<P>I'm not being glib here. At one time or another, we've all studied our 
parents and thought, "Who ARE these people? How can they live like this? 
How can they stand each other?" Early in life, we pass judgment on them 
as individuals and as a couple. Days turn to years, years turn to decades,
 but we rarely bother to review those evaluations to determine if they 
were actually valid. </P>
<P>In the 1995 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel on which the film is based, 
author Anna Quindlen states, "Our parents are never real people to us. 
They are... Achilles' heels, dim nightmares, vocal tics, bad noses, hot 
tears, all handed down and us stuck with them." "One True Thing" shows 
what happens when circumstances force an adult child to deal with her 
mother and father on a level different from that with which she is 
accustomed.</P>
<P>Ellen Gulden (Renee Zellweger) is an ambitious investigative reporter 
whose career defines her life. When a family emergency strikes, she cedes 
to her father's demands and returns home from New York to care for her 
ailing mother. Struggling in vain to balance journalism by long distance 
with her newfound household duties, she finds her carefully crafted life 
dissolving, and all of her childhood resentments returning to the surface.</P>
<P>The Gulden family dynamics will seem familiar to many. Patriarch George 
(William Hurt) is a respected literary professor and celebrated author. 
Always ready with a studied quip or well-worn anecdote, George takes his 
role as leader and perpetual center of attention as a given. Even as 
adults, Ellen and her brother Brian (Tom Everett Scott) find themselves 
concealing their failings from Dad, still striving to gain approval from 
the lord of the manor.</P>
<P>The consummate homemaker, wife and mother Kate (Meryl Streep) appears to 
live only to serve. In Ellen's eyes, she seems almost trivial, an 
appendage to her husband rather than a self-realized individual. When 
Kate falls ill and George badgers his daughter into taking a sabbatical 
to help her mother, Ellen lands in a personal hell as she haplessly 
attempts to play the role of housewife. </P>
<P>This is the stuff of countless sappy TV movies, but "One True Thing" has 
the substance and integrity most dramas about family lack. The handsome 
production is reminiscent of "Ordinary People" in its rich, stirring 
depiction of the realities beneath the surface of an upper-class family. 
Karen Croner's screenplay, based on Quindlen's bestseller, is precise and 
extremely insightful, taking stereotypical characters and turning them 
into real people. Having an all-star cast doesn't hurt, either. </P>
<P>Tom Everett Scott is effective in a supporting role as the easygoing son 
who takes after his mother while deferring to his dad. William Hurt gives 
one of his best performances in years, with his prickly, cerebral persona 
perfectly suited to this role. George is much like Mary Tyler Moore's 
character in "Ordinary People"; he loves his family, but is self-absorbed 
and lacks crucial nurturing skills. "One True Thing" refuses to write off 
George as a villain, though, instead exploring the self-doubt and fear 
beneath this damaged man's exterior.</P>
<P>As Kate, Meryl Streep is simply extraordinary, investing the character 
with remarkable depth and humanity, without ever seeming pious or 
mannered. Kate's essence is best explained when she refers to her 
husband's literary mantra, "Less is more," and tells her daughter, "I 
disagree with your father. More is more." Streep is especially good in 
scenes depicting the latter stages of Kate's illness, effectively 
conveying the difficulties in trying to retain her composure while pain 
and fatigue batter her soul.</P>
<P>Renee Zellweger has perhaps the most difficult role in the film, 
representing all adults in the audience who have ever rolled their eyes 
in frustration over the conduct of their parents. As our surrogate, 
Zellweger nails our generation's behavior with often uncomfortable 
accuracy. She does her duty for the family, but makes sure those around 
her understand exactly how much of a sacrifice she is making. Her 
periodic whining and petulant manner are difficult to watch because she 
reflects us so very well.</P>
<P>Honest, perceptive and moving, "One True Thing" builds to a revelatory 
climax, forcing you to rethink everything you've seen up to that moment. 
You'll likely do considerable thinking after you've left the theater as 
well. "One True Thing" makes a simple, but powerful suggestion: maybe our 
long-held assessments of our parents are wrong. We grew up asking, and 
generally receiving, second chances from Mom and Dad. Perhaps it's time 
to return the favor. </P>
