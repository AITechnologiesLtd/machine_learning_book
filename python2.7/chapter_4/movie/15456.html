<PRE>PSYCHO
A film p)review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1998 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of ****), maybe...</PRE>
<PRE>        "Check in.  Relax.  Take a shower."</PRE>
<P>        You have to admit it's a pretty nifty tagline.   But you'd have to
*be*  a psycho to review Gus Van Sant's redo of the Alfred Hitchcock
masterpiece, so I won't even attempt it here.  I mean, what are you going
to say?  "Van Sant's picture surpasses the original "Psycho" in style,
substance, and shock value."  Or "Director Gus Van Sant has thrown together
a disastrous film that makes the 1987 television movie "Bates Motel" appear
Oscar-worthy by comparison."</P>
<P>        No.  Chances are your comments are going to fall somewhere in
between.  And that's the basket into which I'm putting all my eggs.</P>
<P>        Van Sant is no hack, and has been slowly gaining a reputation as a
mainstream filmmaker since his early directorial days, when controlled
substances featured as heavily as the characters in his films ("Drugstore
Cowboy," "My Own Private Idaho," "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues").  Many
people missed the fact that Van Sant was the man behind "Good Will
Hunting"; his star was eclipsed by two young up-and-comers named Matt Damon
and Ben Affleck.</P>
<P>        Given his off-beat but critical success ("Cowgirls" excepted), Van
Sant isn't likely to trash Hitch's classic film (although one of his
reasons for remaking it is "to do it in color"--sounds a tad suspect to say
the least).  His version of "Psycho" is less a remake and more a
scene-by-scene reconstruction, with all of the original dialogue intact.</P>
<P>        In fact, Van Sant's goal was to "update" the story by taking
advantage of some of the innovations in the medium that weren't available
in 1960 (a helicopter's eye view of a motel room, for example).</P>
<P>        The story, by Robert Bloch, was inspired by the real life exploits
of Ed Gein, a cannibalistic mass-murderer who turned his picturesque
Wisconsin farmhouse into a human abattoir (Gein was also the inspiration
behind "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and the lesser-seen "Deranged").
"Psycho" tells the tale of Marion Crane, a disenchanted real estate worker
who embezzles $40,000 and escapes town in order to marry her boyfriend,
Sam.  On her way to meet Sam, Marion stops at the Bates Motel run by a
troubled young man called Norman who, it turns out, is very much tied to
his mother's apron strings.</P>
<P>        Crane (played by Janet Leigh in the original and Anne Heche in the
update) buys it in the first few reels--an innovative and rarely imitated
idea--and Norman Bates was so immortalized by Anthony Perkins in the 1960
film that Perkins couldn't get any non-psycho offers for a long while
afterwards.  Vince Vaughn plays Norman in the remake.</P>
<P>        If you haven't seen Hitchcock's "Psycho" (and still want to having
read this far), I implore you to rent it *before* settling down to watch
Van Sant's interpretation.  The version that hits the theaters December 4th
doesn't have Saul Bass' superb editing (the infamous shower sequence,
arguably), Bernard Herrmann's screeching violins, or John Russell's eerie
black and white photography but, for better or worse, it does have that
very satisfying publicity campaign.</P>
