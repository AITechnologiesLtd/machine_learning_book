<P>
Right. So, I just got back from the very first "open to the public" showing.
Now, I'm sure by now, you've read many a plot synopsis, so I won't
reiterate what others have said.</P>
<P>I'm a Star Wars fanatic. I'm very very biased. I had to love this movie no
matter what it turned out like.</P>
<P>As it turns out, I didn't have to rely on that blind faith in the force.
The movie is good. Very, very good. Its visually the most stunning
movie I've ever seen, and likely to remain so until the next Star Wars
episode hits theatres.</P>
<P>In keeping with the other movies, the acting has that slight "cheesy" feel
to it, which I personally believe suited the movie just perfectly.</P>
<P>If I had to have a problem with the movie (and I do...) I'd have to say
its the way some of the enemies are defeated. One scene with Jar Jar Binks
springs to mind, showing such uncanny luck that you'd think that goof was
force-sensitive. whichheisdefinitelynot.</P>
<P>Hey...its 3 am. I may be wired on Jolt, but I don't think this is the best
time for me to be writing a review. </P>
<P>Go see the freaking movie already. You know you will.</P>
<PRE>@@@1/2 (out of @@@@)</PRE>
<P>All in all, a fine addition to the Star Wars legacy....now if they can
only hurry up and bring us the clone wars and the Mandalorians...</P>
