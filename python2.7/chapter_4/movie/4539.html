<PRE>                              EYE FOR AN EYE
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>        Who has not at some period in one's life yearned for revenge?
Picture the parents of the two people who were killed in the case of O
J Simpson.  Surely, despite the jury's finding of "Not Guilty," how
difficult it must be for the parents to restrain themselves from doing
him harm?</P>
<P>        In EYE FOR AN EYE, the older daughter of Karen McCann (Sally
Field) is raped and murdered.  On a technicality, despite evidence that
Robert Doob (Kiefer Sutherland), the accused, is set free by the judge.
Everyone is angry but only Karen decides to take matters into her own
hands.   If her husband (2nd marriage) Mack (Ed Harris) will not take
her seriously; if the detective (Joe Mantegna) says he is helpless, 
then
who but Karen can track down the whereabouts of the free murderer and
revenge her daughter's death?</P>
<P>        Despite the fine cast, the movie has a tendency to slow down
frequently.  The story is hardly original.  Whatever reason there is
for seeing the film lies mostly in the acting; Fields, as always, does
a magnificent characterization as the distraught, angry parent.  Others
in the cast do well by their smaller roles.</P>
