<PRE>                                 BLUE SKY
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  A drama about the decay of the
     nuclear family set in 1962.  Jessica Lange and Tommy Lee
     Jones star in a fresh and unpredictable film that
     concerns one family's domestic problems and national
     nuclear policy.  This unusual film keeps the audience
     guessing where it is going and never talks down to the
     audience.  Rating: low +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     The year is 1962 and Major Hank Marshall (Tommy Lee Jones), a
nuclear engineer, is advising the U.S. Army on nuclear testing.
Meanwhile his wife Carly (Jessica Lange), a sexually precocious child
in the body of an adult woman, is doing everything she can to embarrass
him.  She sees herself as a Marilyn Monroe type and flirts with
reckless abandon.  She is the main reason Hank has been reassigned from
a pleasant posting in Hawaii to a disagreeable one on an ugly Army base
in Alabama.  Hank tries to keep a lid on the family problems in public
and to keep the two daughters happy, but it is clear their mom needs
more care and is more of a child than the children are.  Hank has
problems at home and with his work.  Hank advocates nuclear underground
testing when his commanders and the Atomic Energy Commission want to
continue atmospheric testing.  At first this seems an odd pairing of
plots.  One plot concerns a family disintegrating because of the wife's
childish behavior and her husband's vain attempts to cover for her and
to maintain an even keel.  The other plot deals with national nuclear
policy.  And it is well into the film before the viewer has much of an
idea where the story could possibly be going with two such diverse
strands of plot.  Eventually they will come together in a story about,
of all things, character.</P>
<P>     This was the last film directed by Tony Richardson, who is best
known for his 1963 TOM JONES and who died three years ago.  It may well
also be the last film we will see from the now long defunct Orion
Pictures.  It is easy to see why this film waited so long for a release
given the intelligence of the scripting and the originality of the
plot.  BLUE SKY was also a little lucky in that like CHINA SYNDROME and
MAROONED, the subject matter happened to become considerably more
topical after the film's completion than at the time the film was made.</P>
<P>     Jessica Lange gets top billing, though her acting shows more than
a little of her character in FRANCES.  She is fleshy and sensual.  But
at the same time she is annoyingly like a spoiled child given to
tantrums, not unlike the character's idol, Marilyn Monroe.  Tommy Lee
Jones gives his character just the right blend of military
officiousness and occasional tenderness.  Powers Boothe, always good,
plays Hank's commanding officer who mixes into Hank's personal life as
well as his professional life.</P>
<P>     Richardson shows a visual sense in some of his more interesting
scene segues.  He takes us from the paradise of a Hawaiian beach to a
nuclear-devastated landscape.  His recreation of the early 60s has just
about the right look, particularly the army base with its rundown
post-war housing.  In short his final film is one of his best in years.
Lange's and Jones's performances and the originality of the story give
this one a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
