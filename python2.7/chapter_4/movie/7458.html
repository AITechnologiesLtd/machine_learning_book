(deserves a strong R for foul language)</P>
<P>Texas-born Richard Linklater is a true-blue cinephile who left the
University of Texas after two years,  returned to Austin after two more,
founded the Austin Film Society, made Super-8 movies and the feature-length
"It's Impossible to Learn to Plow by Reading Books" (1988), unseen by the
public. The title smacks of an alibi for unfinished studies.  I believe
fervently in true education but I am also familiar with  academic
prententiousness, bla bla, and Jargonauts. So I am neither for nor against
Linklater's dictum.</P>
<P>I am a great fan of Linklater the filmmaker who has charted young people so
cleverly . "Slacker," hs firt released feature, popularized the term as the
film followed a huge variety of hangers on in Austin with deft sketches,
goodhearted irony and a para-Godardian style that was also genuinely
Linklaterian.</P>
<P>"Dazed and Confused" (1993) recreated the last day of high school among
1976 students. The generation was the identity-less, post-Vietnam one,
poised between the hippie, idealistic, politicized, psychedelic 60s and
early 70s, and the pragmatic, Me-Me 80s. Linklater followed the kids like
an experienced anthropologist. Though less ironical than in "Slacker" he
did not spare us the inner emptiness of the youths, but without judging or
taking sides he sifted nicely the mavericks from the herd, showed cool
understanding and regaled us with much droll footage.</P>
<P>"Before Sunrise" (1995), was the meeting of strangers on a train, a French
woman and an American man, both 23.  Their brief encounter lasted well
under 24 hours.Uncannily catching the sights and moods of Vienna, it added
to the influence  of Jean-Luc Godard that of  Eric Rohmer and even Jacques
Rivette, yet Linklater remained once more his own, original man.</P>
<P>"SubUrbia" is preciously spelled with a capital U for no reason I can
detect except that it sounds like a burp. The characters are contemporary
20-somethings; the place is an invented town in Texas (shot in Austin); the
film's time is again limited from an early evening to the next morning; the
locus is a suburban convenience shop's parking lot where five pals, mostly
same-high-school graduates, congregate. Whether or not they have temporary
jobs they are innate slackers, but slackers who are not interesting,
amusing or touching. More or less nihilistic, they suffer from delayed
adolescent angst, drink, smoke, are dazed and confused, and talk talk talk,
getting drunk on words and booze. They also beleaguer the young Pakistani
owners of the store, often in racist ways.</P>
<P>Jeff comes closest to being the central character. He philosophizes
nebulously, has existential and identity problems. Tim  received an
honorable discharge from the  Air Force after  he "accidentally" sliced a
bit of his finger.  He has a chip on his shoulder and much booze in his
system. Buff is an unbearably obnoxious, jerky, clowning loudmouth who
vaguely thinks of making videos. A spike-haired female called Sooze is no
souse but Jeff's girl-friend who wants to become a performance artist in
New York. She gives her pals a terrible sample performance  of mostly
four-letter vituperations. Her personal friend Bee-Bee, a fragile,
recovering alcoholic, is younger and  outside the clan.</P>
<P>The shiftless quintet has gathered partly to wait for the visit of former
classmate Pony who has broken into MTV. Nothing major, but enough to
qualify him for a chauffeur-driven limo and an accompanying publicist,
rich, spoiled Californian Erica. Following this Waiting for Godot spell
come reactions, permutations, jealousies, ingratiations, other tortured and
tortuous relationships, more inane talk.  No matter how much they pose as
desperate or soulful  characters or whatever, they remain cardboardishly
flat.   Particularly frustrating is  the case of Jeff  who has potential
but whose omphaloscopy makes him a kvetcher without a cause.</P>
<P>The movie has no closure, which is OK, but works in blurry red herrings
that toy with the audience, which is not OK. Vagueness is all. Speech and
behavior may be accurately imitating life among certain types, but the
species are indifferent and unappealing. (I suspect that in real life the
boys would smell like Parisian "clochards.") Some youths wallow in
self-pity, others get irrationally or stupidly aggressive. others yet are
plain dumb. The prevailing non-thinking is that society sucks, but no one
dreams of doing anything about it.</P>
<P>Watch "60 Minutes" and its investigations show you see vividly how much
rottenness there is in this world.  Our parking-lot denizens, however,
never pinpoint  anything specific. And we are left in the dark about the
backgrounds of the characters, their families, the influences on them. At
the very least, and by omission, the situation is no compliment to home
life, school life or American life in general.</P>
<P>For what they attempt to represent -- a dysfunctional segment of young
America-the actors are good and well-directed. But the script is one of
weak opportunism  --this from Eric Bogosian of, among others,  "Talk Radio"
fame.  A few flashes of behavior, action, dialogue and monologue shed no
light. We can only react with "OK, guys,  you're alienated, I'm sorry. So
what else is new?"  Before we start caring for them, they would need a
brain transplant, and we would need a Florence Nightingale or Mother Teresa
heart.</P>
<P>It is sad to be negative after years of admiration for Linklater's movies,
but the truth is that "SubUrbia" 's two hours are as boring as watching the
grass grow. Except that this grass also keeps making irritating, loud
sounds. And when it's up, it's not fescue but crab-grass.</P>
