<PRE>NOTTING HILL (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Edited by Steve Kong

<P>The chances of an ordinary guy like myself bumping into Julia Roberts is
less likely than me winning the lottery. And the chances of me bumping into
her and then getting a kiss? I don't even want to consider it. It is this
kind of what-if scenario that makes Notting Hill so enjoyable.</P>
<P>William (Hugh Grant) Thacker is an ordinary guy who lives in Notting Hill.
He owns a travel bookstore that is deep in debt, his wife divorced him for
a guy who looks like Harrison Ford and he now lives in the house that they
bought together. He has a flatmate that's a disgusting, though hilarious,
guy. One day his whole life changes when the world famous actress Anna
(Julia Roberts) Scott walks into his bookstore. The fun and odd romance
starts from this point. Odd in the sense that in Notting Hill the typical
movie gender roles are reversed. Thacker is put into the position of the
person at home waiting and wondering. And Anna is the one off in the world
working.</P>
<P>The best thing about Notting Hill is that the two main actors are doing
parts that they have been doing for a long time. The parts that Grant and
Roberts are attempting in Notting Hill are familiar, both to the viewers
and to the two actors. Which makes a original but familiar feeling movie.</P>
<P>The first hour of Notting Hill is absolutely hilarious. The second hour
keeps some of the humour from the first hour but becomes a bit more
heartbreaking as it continues. The second hour does lose some of the first
hour's steam, but this isn't a big deal. My favourite moment of the film is
when Anna and William jump a gate to take advantage of a private park. From
the moment they arrive at the gate, this sequence had me laughing. The
scene ends on a sweet note with Anna discovering a park bench with an
inscription on it.</P>
<P>Julia Roberts is back at the top of her game now that she is doing the
roles that fit her best. Roberts has always been a romantic-comedy type
actress. Her roles in romantic-comedy films have always been hits (Pretty
Woman, My Best Friend's Wedding), while her roles in dramatic and otherwise
have been lukewarm at best (Mary Reilly). My Best Friend's Wedding is still
my favourite film of Roberts, but, Notting Hill comes up a close second. No
matter what you think of Hugh Grant, he's a good actor. His bumbling-guy
act is ingenious and works well in Notting Hill. This bumbling-guy
("Oopsie-daisies") act is what makes us like him in the film and bond with
his character. If it weren't for this, I don't think that his character
would have worked out. The two leads share tangible screen chemistry and
this also helps.
Someone worth mentioning is actor Rhys Ifans as William Thacker's flat-mate
Spike. Ifans is hilarious as Spike. Every time that Ifans is on screen it's
a laugh-out-loud moment. Look for his performance in the film, he steals
the movie. Another thing worth mentioning is the film score by Trevor
Jones. The score consists mostly of an acoustic guitar and fits the film
like a glove. It's a shame that the score hasn't been released on its own
CD, but you can find bits of the score on the Notting Hill soundtrack.</P>
<P>Notting Hill may not be the most original film, but it has all the right
elements to make it a Don't Miss film. If you're not planning on seeing
Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, or are waiting for the lines to
die down, Notting Hill is the perfect film to catch. Don't Miss Notting Hill.</P>
