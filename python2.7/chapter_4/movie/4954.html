<P>     In the remarkably rich and furiously funny FARGO, brothers Joel and
Ethan Coen have returned to their roots, both thematically and geograph-
ically.  The "brats," as they are called by some, have effectively
remade their first film, BLOOD SIMPLE, as a Midwestern murder mystery
with a cutting comedic edge.  (Think of a snowy stew of darkness and
deadpan-- BLOOD SIMPLE mixed with a little RAISING ARIZONA.) More
importantly-- more hilariously-- the Twin Cities- born brothers have
concocted their first loving celebration of all things Minnesota.</P>
<P>     William H. Macy (last seen in what I call MR. HOLLAND'S ANUS) stars
as a scheming Minneapolis car salesman (and putz), whose idea for
raising cash involves kidnapping his wife to get the ransom from her
rich father.  Things quickly go wrong for everyone involved, including
two "hired hands" from Fargo (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare).  Three
murders, two hookers, and one jump-start later, the very-pregnant,
very-polite Brainerd (MN) Chief of Police Marge Gunderson (Joel's wife,
Frances McDormand) steps into the picture.  Or, rather, waddles.</P>
<P>     FARGO is the least-stylized and, probably, most-mature Coen film to
date.  The oft-criticized brothers have, finally, achieved a balance
between their love of eccentricity and their audience's base need for
feeling.  Simply, they've made a very quirky (read:  very Coen) film
with a heart.  Here are characters with real, negotiable emotions--
unlike the past cartoon creations that have been all too common in the
Coen universe.  (THE HUDSUCKER PROXY, for example, is both a visual tour
de force and an emotional black hole.  Jennifer Jason Leigh's
character-- the eventual force of good in the story-- never makes an
emotional impact.  She just talks fast.)</P>
<P>     As we're in very SIMPLE territory, expect plenty of grisly details
and sadistic flourishes.  (A couple of tree-clearing tools are used to
particularly fine effect.  Nods to Paul Bunyan?) The laughs are there,
too.  FARGO is recorded in sing-song, Scandinavian stereo, with dialects
and dialogue that you just don't hear south of Lake Michigan. (Yes, they
really *do* talk like that.  Yup, you betcha.) Don't expect an easy
explanation for it all, tho.  FARGO is more than a little intentionally
obscure.  For example, we don't know what to make of a hotel encounter
between Marge and an old schoolmate.  Is it a comment on her perpetual
politeness?  A deduction about her powers of reasoning?  For all we
know, the moment exists solely to hear an Asian-American who also talks
with that wonderful accent.</P>
