<PRE>Raising Arizona  * * * 1/2 (out of four)
PG-13, 1987
Directed by Joel Coen. Written by Joel and Ethan Coen.
Starring Nicolas Cage, Holly Hunter.</PRE>
<P>"My name is H.I. McDonough. You can call me Hi," drawls Nicolas Cage, and with
that, Joel and Ethan Coen's "Raising Arizona" is off and running with the
deranged inspiration of a tall tale. Hi, a dimwitted but surprisingly eloquent
convenience store thief, is the perfect narrator for this tale of love and
kidnapping, rural Arizona-style, delivering his "observations" with all the
weight of a Shakespearean monologue. After several rounds in the slammer, Hi
finally marries his true love, a police officer and prison photographer named
Ed (Holly Hunter) for whom he has been carryinga torch ever since she first
took his mug shots - "the day I'll never forget," as he fondly remembers it. </P>
<P>Unfortunately, they soon discover that Ed is infertile, and their inability to
have children puts the strains on their marriage ("I even found myself driving
past convenience stores . . . that weren't on the way home," Hi reflects
somberly). The adoption agencies aren't too impressed with Hi's criminal past,
so the two come up with a unique solution. A wealthy family has recently had
quintuplets, so they'll just steal one of theirs - after all, four ought to be
enough for them, right? After Hi somehow manages to make away with one of them
despite starting what is probably the best approximation of a riot that
two-week-olds can manage, the movie follows Hi and Ed as they try to care for
their new addition to the family. </P>
<P>More grins ensue, mostly deriving from the banter between Cage and Hunter and
from the performances of John Goodman and William Forsythe as two hilariously
inept escaped criminals. And the Coens' talent for visual comedy makes for
some of the movie's best moments; an extended romp through the desert towards
the end of the movie is good for quite a few laughs as Goodman and Forsythe
manage to pull one ridiculously dumb stunt after another. There is also a
chase scene in the middle which seems to come straight out of a Road Runner
cartoon and has to be one of the funniest pieces of slapstick in movie
history. It's nearly impossible to describe verbally, but let me just say that
it starts with what seems like a typical convenience store robbery, but by the
end, a trigger-happy policeman is running through a drugstore trying to dodge
carts steered by screaming women who are being pursued by a pack of house
dogs. </P>
<P>The only thing that seems a little uneven about "Raising Arizona" is its
handling of the bizarre "Lone Rider of the Apocalypse" character. This hefty,
gun-slinging biker, who seems to have wandered in from a Mad Max  movie,
appears at first mostly in Hi's dreams or in his imagination, but towards the
end he seems to be a real person. While some of the other goings-on are pretty
outlandish, it is not until the biker is revealed to be a physical reality
that "Raising Arizona" clearly crosses the line into fantasy, and at an hour
and fifteen minutes into the film, it's a little late. The biker's scenes are
certainly amusing - it wasn't until after the movie was over, when I had
finally stopped laughing, that I got to thinking about this in the first place
- but it also didn't take me too long to figure out that the character was
handled rather strangely. </P>
<P>Psychotic bikers and metaphysical distortions aside, however, "Raising
Arizona" is definitely one of the funnier and better-written comedies that I
have come across, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys
clever, tongue-in-cheek verbal humor and off-the-wall slapstick.</P>
