<P>   As I was coming home from a screening of "The School of
Flesh" the other night, I became part of a captive audience
on the A train.  Six young men seeking funds to buy uniforms
entertained our car.  They turned somersaults like acrobats
from the Moscow Circus, stamped their feet like flamenco
dancers at the Meson Madrid, and concluded their
performance with some rap that could stand up pretty well
next to Gilbert and Sullivan's patter songs.  How different this
boisterous merriment is from Benoit Jacquot's new feature
film, his tenth, "The School of Flesh," which is known in
French as "L'Ecole de la Chair."  As Professor Henry Higgins
once said, "The French don't care what they do, actually, so
long as they pronounce it properly," and the Gallic folks in
this escapade can certainly talk but they also do--the
darndest things.  The conversations in the movie are
cultivated where the break dancers are disciplined but
uninhibited. And where the dancers are nothing if not
physical, the characters in this French drama mostly sit and
discuss.</P>
<P>   And yet how similar are the two diversions, since the
principal individual in "The School of Flesh," a financially
successful, well educated but bored and unfulfilled woman
crosses the boundaries of age, culture and class to give
herself over to pure sexual chemistry.  As a woman running
an exclusive atelier for wealthy customers seeking the very
best in attire, Dominique (Isabelle Huppert), an outwardly
demure woman of about forty, becomes strongly attracted to
a youth of about twenty-five, Quentin (Vincent Martinez).  
Comfortable financially, she lives in a pristine apartment
virtually devoid of furniture or accoutrements that could be
considered of sentimental worth.  Her new paramour earns
his living as a gay hustler on the streets of Paris.  The two
meet at a Paris bar catering to both gays and straights,
where Quentin is serving as a bartender.  His friend Chris
(Vincent Lindon), a transvestite, will later reveal what he
knows about Quentin to Isabelle, who is out on the town with
her friend (Daniel Dubroux).  By taking us through the
association between Quentin and Isabelle, director Benoit
Jacquot means to show us what binds such different
individuals for a relatively brief but intense duration.</P>
<P>   When young, rugged Quentin plays cruel power games
with his new partner, as when he takes her after a dinner
engagement to a video-game parlor and then refuses to
leave, we're meant to see that he is a vulnerable person
testing the limits of Isabelle's affection.  When Quentin asks
Isabelle whether she would love him even if he lost an arm, a
leg, or other important body parts, he is similarly verifying her
fondness for him as though he were terrified of being
abandoned.  For her part Isabelle, who is bankrolling the
young man's debts without his knowledge and playing the
perfect sugar daddy, will not tolerate Quentin's declasse
habits. When he lifts his sea bass in a fashionable restaurant
to test its freshness, she barks at him to put it down because
"you're with me."  And needless to say, Quentin is not at all
comfortable in the company of Isabelle's rich friends and
customers in her atelier, acting as does the petty thief
George Dyer with artist Francis Bacon in John Maybury's
film, "Love is the Devil."</P>
<P>   Since the relationship does not exist in a vacuum, Jacquot
furnishes us a roundelay of social contacts who have a
bearing on the unusual relationship of the two people.  A
businessman (Bernard Le Coq) who shows interest in
Isabelle fails to turn her head away from Quentin, while
Quentin's eye for the rich, teenaged Marine Thorpe (Roxane
Mesquida) threatens to break up Dominique's affair with the
brash young hustler.  </P>
<P>   What is especially involving is that Jacquot has his
performers relate their tale not only by talk but by subtle
gestures, each of which bespeaks a novel--as they say.  A
look here, a tear there; a glance by one lover in the direction
of a third party, a signal of a second or so that reveals a
person's social class beyond uncertainty.  Caroline
Champetier photographs the piece clearly, if conventionally,
with a particularly arresting view of the main square of
Marrakesh.  Luc Barnier's editing is abrupt, as though to point
out the sharp turns that the relationship frequently takes. </P>
<P>   Isabelle Huppert is well cast in the role of a sexually
contained woman of the upper middle class who is at a stage
that Americans would call mid-life crisis.  A major French
actress with roles to her credit since 1971, Huppert has the
quality of both  pallid features and a personality that seems
numbed to the world's pain.  She lacks the versatility that
made Isabelle Adjani so heartbreaking in "The Story of Adele
H," but in this picture, Jacquot--who has apparently directed
her to show a combination of confidence and apprehension--
has made the fitting choice.  </P>
<P>    Sexual attraction can cause people to bear themselves in
the most unpredictable manner and has been the leading
motivator of literary pieces since an understandably jealous
Clytemnestra did in her husband, Agamemnon and Medea
took revenge on a wandering Jason.  "The School of Flesh"
is a commendable, if more unobtrusive, addition to the genre.</P>
