<PRE>October Sky</PRE>
<P>When _Star Wars_ came out some twenty years ago, the image of traveling
throughout the stars has become a commonplace image.  When the Millenium
Falcon moves throughout the stars, we see constellations, meteor
showers, and cool space-ships.  When Han Solo goes light speed, the
stars change to bright lines, going towards the viewer in lines that
converge at an invisible point.  Cool.</P>
<P>_October Sky_ offers a much simpler image--that of a single white dot,
traveling horizontally across the night sky.  Was it really only forty
years ago, when Sputnik was launched, and that before then, no
satellites ever existed?  Have we become so technologically advanced
that we have forgotten that it was nearly two generations ago where
people stood outside to breathlessly see a then-technological
achievement, even though it was from the Russians?</P>
<P>It sounds hokey, but when that scene occurs near the beginning of
_October Sky_, I found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of Homer
Hickam, played by Jake Gyllenhaal.  Determined to make a dent in the
space race, he becomes transfixed with his desire to make a rocket that
could fly like the best of them.</P>
<P>It is films like this that we know the ending as we buy the ticket.
When lovely teacher Miss Riley (played by Laura Dern), suggests that he
enters his findings into the National Science Fair, we know exactly who
is going to win.  But the joy in a film like this is in the little
details.</P>
<P>For example, Homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class.
If he has any strengths whatsoever, it is an undeterring vision, and a
good organizer.  It means that he may have to lose his reputation by
associating with the nerdiest kid in school, who knows more about rocket
science than he does.  It means that if his father forbids him to shoot
rockets on company property (that is, the entire coal-mining town), he
must walk eight miles one way, just to set up the rockets, which will
fail, fail, fail, and fail again.</P>
<P>Homer+s Dad is played by Chris Cooper, a favorite actor of mine since
_Lone Star_.  Here he plays the antithesis of the character he played in
_Matewan_: instead of organizing union rallies, he is the head of the
coal-miners, who is constantly wringing his hands against the unions.
This is will be one of the great unnoticed performances of the year:
note how multi-dimensional his character is.  He is his son+s last
nemesis, as one who most likely interferes with his son+s dreams.  But
he truly loves his son, and wants to see him succeed the only way he
knows how.  Through coal-mining.</P>
<P>Because of his character, we can see how far we+ve come.  The revolution
of modern technology has allowed for us to see society advanced at a
rate far faster than any generation before us.  We don+t understand that
there were the generations from the industrial revolution who knew of no
other way to raise a family.  The paradigm was shifting under the
father+s feet, and he knew of no other life.</P>
<P>So _October Sky_, far from being merely a feel-good inspirational film,
offers much food for thought.  And this is the best type of
inspirational film; the one that you take something with you.</P>
<P>BTW, the final image of the film is just as simple, is as strong a
contrast as the aforementioned horizontal-moving white dot against the
night-sky background.  Another commonplace image, to be sure, but it
must have been breathtaking forty years ago.</P>
