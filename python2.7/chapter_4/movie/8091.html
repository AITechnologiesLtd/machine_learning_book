<P>        I often argue that the terms movie and film come under different
definitions.  A movie is an enjoyable theater experience that creates
memorable characters.  A film is made for artistic purposes with qualities
in the behind-the-scenes areas taking the forefront.  Not since Fargo has there
been such a good movie/film.  In fact this is the best one since Fargo.</P>
<P>        Unfortunately, it is not often that a movie qualifying as an action
picture will even be given a second look for Oscar contention.  Face/Off
deserves such attention.  John Woo is a technical wizard on this picture with
an almost surreal opening in which a child gets shot.  Then, toward the middle
of the film, we witness a shootout through a child's eyes as he listens to
"Over the Rainbow" on a headset.  It is truly a spectacular moment that you
will remember.</P>
<P>        The drama and charcter development are established in this film 
pushing it beyond the limits of Eraser or Con Air.  Nicolas Cage plays Castor
Troy, a homicidal maniac, who killed Sean Asher's (John Travolta) child while
the latter two were riding a merry-go-round.  We then move to six years later
as Troy plots to demolish Los Angeles in a cold-blooded bombing.  In order
to diffuse the bomb, Asher is coaxed into trading faces with Troy, who is in 
a coma.  This top secret mission, however, heads down the wrong path.  Troy
wakes up and forces Asher's face to be transplanted onto himself.</P>
<P>        From there, plot shifts abound as suddenly Cage is playing the 
kind-hearted guy and Travolta the dispicable one.  Cage illuminates the
screen as he watches the evil Asher (Troy) gain credit for saving the city.
The real Asher is helpless and now he must save his well-being by getting 
Troy.</P>
<P>        Joan Allen (Nixon, The Crucible) magnificently portrays the third of
a series of tortured wives.  The depths that John Woo has extended the action
genre into amazes.  A shootout in a church toward the end works the viewer 
into a frenzy, but the film still is not over.</P>
<P>        It runs an enjoyable and quick two hours and ten minutes.  And is
truly worthy of highest honors.  Cage deserves an actor nod since he had
to create the bad guy and then earn back our sympathies as the good guy.
Cage's work let Travolta off easy, though he was spectacular as well.  The
direction was top-notch, and its easily the best picture since Fargo.</P>
<P>        Maybe the academy will take notice of this intelligent and
ground-breaking film.  It isn't often that I do this, but the film was
extremely impressive.  </P>
