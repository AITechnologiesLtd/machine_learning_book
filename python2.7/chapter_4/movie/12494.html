<P>Frank Sinatra.  The comparisons are long and debatable and my preference
as the twentieth century's greatest entertainer/singer is still Elvis
Presley for his diversity in country, western, rock 'n' roll, ballads,
gospel, blues, and although Presley and many others after him enjoyed
success based on the influences of Sinatra and those from his
generation, Presley still has more gold records than anyone else.  Frank
Sinatra was a legendary performer who passed away on May 14, 1998.  I'm
writing this movie review one day after his death to celebrate the most
successful film work he ever turned in.  He won a Best Supporting Actor
Oscar for his work as the noble soldier Maggio in director Fred
Zinnemann's powerful 1953 adult drama, 'From Here to Eternity'.  It was
this film that revived Sinatra's career and he never looked back after
it.   This movie is #4 on my all time list, behind (3) 'The Godfather
Part II' (1974), (2) 'Platoon' (1986) and 'The Godfather' (1972).  Other
films that Sinatra enjoyed success in such as 'The Man With the Golden
Arm' (1955), 'The Manchurian Candidate' (1962) and 'Von Ryan's Express'
(1965), were all a result of his success in 'From Here to Eternity'.</P>
<P>It was based on the novel written by James Jones and was toned down
somewhat by screenwriter Daniel Taradash (an Oscar for him) and the film
proved that times change but people don't.  I often listen to the
stories a lot of older folks tell about how morality was at its peak
fifty or sixty years ago compared to today but this film proved with its
adult oriented theme and ground breaking manner that nothing could be
further from the truth.  The film contains heavy references to adultery,
prostitution, alcohol abuse, violence, military injustice, murder and
the outbreak of war.</P>
<P>It begins in 1941 at an army barracks in Hawaii, shortly before the
Pearl Harbor attack, and we are introduced in the first scene to an army
private (Montgomery Clift) who has transferred over from another unit
and meets Sinatra in the first scene as we learn later in the film that
the two of them are good friends.  Clift meets a base Sergeant (Burt
Lancaster) who introduces him to the company commander who we learn has
pulled some strings to get Clift on his boxing team.  Clift has quit
boxing because he once blinded a man and his refusal to fight angers the
company commander to the point where he instructs his fellow officers to
put the screws on Clift until he agrees to box.</P>
<P>The film moves very leisurely from there and the character's personal
lives are displayed in great detail.  Lancaster has an affair with his
company commander's wife (Deborah Kerr), a woman bitter about her
husband's infidelities and drinking and who lost a child through a
painful and disruptive birth which prevents her from having any more
children.  The film's trademark scene is Lancaster and Kerr kissing
while they lay in the sand on the beach as a wave washes over them and
it is one of the most romantic scenes in movie history.  Clift has an
affair with a girl who works at a social club (Donna Reed - Best
Supporting Actress) and their conflicts are as important to the film's
tone as any other.  Sinatra locks horns with a stocky piano playing
military prison officer (Ernest Borgnine) which has tragic results.</P>
<P>The film earned 13 Oscar nominations and won 8, Best Picture, Director
(Zinnemann), Supporting Actor (Sinatra), Supporting Actress (Kerr),
Adapted Screenplay (Daniel Taradash), Sound, Film Editing and
Cinematography.  The stark black and white photography by cameraman
Burnett Guffey is perhaps its greatest technical achievement.  Many
scenes are photographed with little camera movement, giving the film's
most well acted scenes their own strength but using light and shadows in
many other scenes of tragic occurrence to enhance those scenes of
memorable emotion.  Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift split the vote
in the Best Actor category and the award went to William Holden in
'Stalag 17'.  Deborah Kerr lost Best Actress to Audrey Hepburn in 'Roman
Holiday' and the film also lost in the Costume Design and Original Music
Score categories.</P>
<P>Throughout the 60's, many ground breaking adult films in the
contribution to great American cinema such as 'Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?' (1966), 'The Graduate' (1967) and 'Bonnie and Clyde' (1967) are
direct influences of 'From Here to Eternity' and Frank Sinatra probably
gives the film its most memorable performance, to be enjoyed by
generations to come from a man who could entertain tremendously at the
musical level and was also a top notch actor, without a doubt.</P>
