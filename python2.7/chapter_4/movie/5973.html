<P>     On paper, it sounds like a strange idea:  Damon Wayans and Adam 
Sandler paired in a 48 HOURS/LETHAL WEAPON-type buddy/action film.  Of 
course, this isn't the first time two comic actors have done this sort 
of thing (for a recent example, recall Martin Lawrence and Will Smith in 
the better-to-be-forgotten BAD BOYS), and, to be fair, Wayans has 
previously appeared in shoot-'em-ups (like THE LAST BOY SCOUT, opposite 
Bruce Willis).  Surprisingly, however, this unlikely match works, due 
primarily to the charisma of both participants.  What doesn't hold up, 
however, is the ho-hum storyline that Wayans and Sandler find themselves 
stranded in.</P>
<P>     Universal Pictures has labeled BULLETPROOF as a "comedy action 
film", and that's precisely what it is.  The problem is, while some of 
the humor is very funny, there's nothing remotely interesting about the 
action stuff.  It's all redundant and recycled, with a few feeble riffs 
added in a failed attempt to give things an original look.  There are 
the usual car chases, foot chases, barroom brawls, and shootouts.  The 
only thing to elevate the material slightly is the use of more elaborate 
jokes than the one-line wisecracks that permeate the genre.</P>
<P>     The film's premise has undercover cop Jack Carter (a.k.a. Rock 
Keats, played by Damon Wayans) coming to the end of a one-year 
assignment that had him become best friends with criminal Archie Moses 
(Adam Sandler) in order to get the goods on drug lord Frank Colton 
(James Caan).  During the warehouse drug deal where Jack's police sting 
concludes, things go wrong.  Frank gets away, Archie accidentally shoots 
Jack in the head, and a number of people are killed.  Running from both 
the police and Frank's men, Archie heads for Mexico.  Before he gets 
there, however, he is picked up by Arizona authorities and agrees to a 
deal to inform against Frank.  Meanwhile, Jack is recovering from his 
injury with the help of a beautiful therapist (Kristen Wilson).  No 
sooner is he back on duty, however, when his captain (James Farentino) 
calls him into the office with a special assignment:  bring in Archie.  
Jack agrees to the assignment under protest, but when he sets off for 
Arizona, Frank's men are close behind.</P>
<P>     Jack and Archie's friendship forms BULLETPROOF's cornerstone. And, 
while cinematographer-turned-director Ernest Dickerson (JUICE) doesn't 
bring tears to our eyes by delving into the rich complexity of their 
relationship, he gets us to care about them.  A secondary aspect of the 
film concentrates on the consequences of betrayal, and, while this 
subject matter is handled somewhat haphazardly, there is a nice little 
twist that emphasizes it.  </P>
<P>     At times, BULLETPROOF delights in parodying action staples, which 
makes it all the more disappointing that the film ultimately relies on 
so many of them in a straightforward, traditional fashion.  The 
homoerotic subtext apparent in many "buddy movies" is toyed with in an 
inoffensive, over-the-top fashion, as is the formula necessitating that 
the bad guy has a mole working in the police department.  (Could it be 
the captain?  The DEA agent?  The two tough-guy cops?)  And, if you've 
seen the previews, you know how funny Adam Sandler's off-key rendition 
of "I'll Always Love You" (from THE BODYGUARD) is.  That, and the entire 
sequence surrounding it, represents BULLETPROOF's indisputable high 
point.</P>
<P>     Sandler and Wayans work so well together that a future teaming 
(with a more daring script) would be welcome.  Another noteworthy 
performance is given by Mark Roberts, who has a brief-but-memorable 
comic turn as an off-the-wall desk clerk at the porno lodge where Rock 
and Archie take a room.  James Caan, as yet another loud-mouthed tough 
guy with no redeemable features, mails in his portrayal.  He may not be 
losing interest in this kind of role, but I'm getting bored of seeing 
him do it.  Then there's Kristin Wilson, who, aside from her gorgeous 
eyes, brings little to the tired love interest role.</P>
<P>     Largely because it provoked a few hearty laughs, I found myself 
enjoying BULLETPROOF more than I expected.  With a little extra 
imagination invested in the action elements, this could have been a 
worthwhile "popcorn" endeavor.  As things are, it's a marginal feature 
likely to appeal to those who don't demand much from their comedy action 
films.  Anyone hoping for something more meaty will find that 
BULLETPROOF has a few too many holes.</P>
