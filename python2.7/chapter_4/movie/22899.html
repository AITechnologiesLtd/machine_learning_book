<P>In 1940, Walt Disney and company released what would come to be known as one
of the definitive movie musicals; a spectacular, awe-inspiring blend of
classical music set in time to striking animated visuals. Their masterwork,
aptly titled Fantasia, was originally slated to be a work in progress,
containing something new each time it was presented to the viewing public.</P>
<P>While this idea didn't exactly pan-out (in fact, Fantasia bombed upon
initial release), Disney has made the wise decision to put together another
assortment of animation to ring in the new millennium, this time taking
advantage of modern technology and presenting Fantasia 2000 on IMAX screens
across the nation.</P>
<P>Now, anyone who has ever seen an IMAX movie before is well aware of what
they are in store for. With the screen over seven stories high, seeing
something like Fantasia 2000 ala IMAX isn't so much a movie-going experience
as it is an event.</P>
<P>And thankfully, Disney has chosen some material worthy of such technology.
While the seven new animated segments vary in quality (ranging from mediocre
to masterpiece status), the overall effect of the film is quite
intoxicating. In fact, Fantasia 2000 features a piece of animation set to
George Girshwin's "Rhapsody in Blue" that is so brilliantly structured and
delightfully magical that all I could do was sit in my seat with a
child-like grin on my face for the duration of its running time.</P>
<P>However, a couple of the sequences are so tired and contrived that it's a
wonder how they made it into the film in the first place (especially the
grueling "Pines of Rome" flying-whale piece).</P>
<P>In addition to the seven new shorts, Disney has also decided to include a
popular piece from the original Fantasia titled "The Sorcerer's Apprentice",
in which Mickey Mouse goes head-to-head with an army of mischievous brooms.
While the notion to include this, one of the finest works of animation the
world has ever seen, was undoubtedly a stroke of genius, it would be an
understatement to say the Mickey suffers in the IMAX format. With grain
spots the size of my fist filling the screen, it's difficult (and sometimes
impossible) to make out the fine details the artists spent so much time
putting into "The Sorcerer's Apprentice".</P>
<P>Thus, Fantasia 2000 doesn't quite live up to the liveliness and
inventiveness of the original. Still, the majority of the segments work very
well, particularly the "Rhapsody in Blue" sequence. It will go down as one
of the finest works the Disney studio has ever developed, and even alone
would warrant an enthusiastic recommendation.</P>
