<P>     A brilliant failure.  Director Walter Hill, who was in much better
form last year with his little-seen WILD BILL, has remade YOJIMBO not
once but *twice* in the same film.  First, as a dusty, dry- throated
Western (been there, done that, in A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS) and, secondly,
as a hard-boiled Prohibition-era thriller complete with fedoras, tommy
guns, and Model-A Fords.  The age-old plot again involves a wandering
stranger who happens upon a violent rivalry and promptly pits each side
against each other.  Sound familiar?  This time, it's a pair of Chicago
gangs competing for Mexican booze in a nearly-deserted Texas town.  Film
fans could devote an entire evening to discussing why this movie fails
from the get-go.  Here's my initial impression:  we want the central
character (Bruce Willis, miscast) to be a mystery man, which he can't be
as long as he's narrating the damn thing.  Our eyes see Sergio Leone,
but our ears hear Mike Hammer.  If you will.  For anyone who needs more
than just gunplay to ground a movie, it's a confounding waste of time.
We left and asked for our money back.</P>
