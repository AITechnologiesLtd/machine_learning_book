<P>TWO FAMILY HOUSE (2000) *** Directed and written by Raymond De 
Felitta. Photography, Michael Mayers. Editing, David Leonard. 
Production design, Teresa Mastropierro. Cast: Michael Rispoli (Buddy 
Visalo), Kelly Macdonald (Mary O'Neary), Katherine Narducci (Estelle 
Visalo), Kevin Conway (Jim O'Neary), et al. A Lions Gate release. 
104 minutes. PG-13. At the Art.</P>
<P>I know little about writer/director Raymond De Felitta except that: 
his first film was a short, Bronx Cheers, which had an Oscar 
nomination. His second film was the feature Cafe Society which 
debuted at the 1995 Cannes Festival in the Directors' Fortnight 
series. Its US release was super-minimal  as RDF distributed the 
film himself. He co-wrote the 1998 Shadow of a Doubt, then came Two 
Family House which received the Audience Award at Sundance 2000.</P>
<P>What I do know is that RDF had a beloved uncle called Buddy; that 
Buddy is the inspiration for Two Family House, not in every fact and 
detail but enough to make this into a veristic movie, verismo being 
an Italian term for everyday realism in life applied to art. And 
that Uncle Buddy would be proud of his nephew.</P>
<P>The setting is Staten Island in 1956 (and a bit beyond), among 
Italian-Americans. There is an Irish community too but the two 
groups keep apart, have no kind words for each other. </P>
<P>Buddy, says RDF, was "a lovable  loser in pursuit of an elusive 
dream." His first dream was in the Navy, where he once sang nicely 
O Sole Mio before the famous Arthur Godfrey. Buddy was hoping to 
make it on  Godfrey's TV program. But his wife Estelle discouraged 
his venturing outside the more modest Italian lifestyle and 
occupations. Buddy, a factory worker, went on to more schemes that 
failed, then to his final dream: to buy a two-story house where he 
and Estelle would live upstairs, while he would transform the 
downstairs into Buddy's Bar.</P>
<P>He finds a dilapidated old place, but before he can begin to give it 
shape he discovers that upstairs live Jim, an older, foul-mouthed 
Irish-American drunkard and his far younger,  pretty and most 
pregnant Irish-Irish wife Mary. There's no way to get rid of Jim who 
has refused to pay rent for years yet can defy eviction thanks to a 
peculiar local law.</P>
<P>When Buddy and his buddies menace eviction by force, the hubbub 
precipitates the birth of Mary's child. It is a special case which I 
cannot disclose, but which results in Jim's disappearance. This is 
soon followed by Mary's eviction. Yet soft-hearted Buddy arranges 
for her to leave the tawdry hotel she moved to with the baby. He 
rents better quarters for them, and gradually he and the lass 
becomes friends, to say the least. </P>
<P>What follows is a relationship and a string of events which are at 
the same time simple but also complicated, even complex 
developments. All this is redolent of Italian-American working class 
realism, types, valiant drinks at the local bar which is like a club 
for Buddy's friends, and of enough cigarette smoke to induce global 
warming.</P>
<P>I will not dwell on the march of time within the plot and spoil the 
viewer's fun. However I should mention that several of the actors 
are familiar to many from TV's The Sopranos; that the actress who 
plays the Irish Mary is, in fact a Scotswoman; that Estelle is a 
Class C termagant;  and that there are no Mafiosi, gangsters and 
others of that ilk around, not even in mentions or allusions.</P>
<P>The last point is refreshing. I remember when Frank Sinatra (whose 
ties with the underworld were blatant) went to bat accusing the 
media of caricaturing Italian-Americans as members of organized 
crime, and --I believe-- as screen clichés even if they were 
ordinary people. I am afraid that Sinatra had a point. Movies still 
used to stereotype  minorities until some years ago. Especially 
Italians.
For comic purposes some stereotyping was innocuous, but then the 
films made it clear that these were blatantly farcical exaggerations.</P>
<P>Think of Sig Ruman who played  outrageous Teutonic characters, 
always the butt of jokes:  Herman Gotlieb (A Night at the Opera), 
Dr. Steinberg (A Day at the Races), Dr. Wuthering (Love Crazy), 
Heinrich Stubel (A Night in Casablanca), Dr. Eggelhoffer (Nothing 
Sacred), Colonel Ehrhardt (To Be or Not to be), Schultz (Stalag 17) 
and more. Then think of the plethora of Italian-Americans over the 
full spectrum of Hollywood films, as often nice but always 
"realistically amusing" types.</P>
<P>The backlash nowadays is political correctness which tends to 
eliminate colorfulness, even when it is justified. I think Sinatra 
would have approved how Two Family House tells its tale "like it is" 
and with genuine warmth. </P>
