<PRE>                      THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                       1 :-(  for Leo and the boys</PRE>
<P>Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Gerard
Depardieu,  Gabriel Byrne, Anne Parillaud, Judith Godreche, Peter
Sarsgaard, Hugh Laurie
Director: Randall Wallace
Producers: Randall Wallace and Russ Smith
Screenplay:  Randall Wallace based on the novel by Alexandre Dumas</P>
<P>Hollywood has an annoying tendency to transform great classical pieces
of literature into whatever they fancy. If these changes were any good
then perhaps one can say – oh, that was neat; but when they are sloppily
done, one can only grit their teeth, rip at the seating material with
their finger nails and wait for the movie's end.</P>
<P>THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK is by no means a faithful adaptation of the
Alexandre Dumas novel on which it is based. The question is did screen
writer/director newbie Randall Wallace even try to be loyal?</P>
<P>So let's forget about the story for the moment, and focus on the young
star of the moment, Leonardo Di Caprio. Hot off the heels of TITANIC,
this movie vehicle merely cashes in on the enormous popularity generated
from the aforementioned. His performance here merely ranges from pure
pouty (Evil King Louis) to pure innocence (Good Prince Phillipe) with
little in between, so much for dramatic range! He was by far better in
Titanic. Then there are the veterans of stage and screen. Jeremy Irons
(Aramis), very much reprises his priestly persona that worked
brilliantly in THE MISSION. I still can't get over John Malkovich's
awkward American accent as Athos. Fortunately, there is no such
discrepancy between speech and character with Gerard Depardieu. His role
as Porthos, farts and all, is the comic relief in this sullen movie.
Gabriel Byrne an ever reliable actor is the loyal, faithful D'Artagnan
who carries a mysterious secret with him.</P>
<P>Overall, THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK is mildly entertaining, but not a good
movie by any standard. There are some memorable scenes like Leo Di
Caprio looking his prettiest whilst moon gazing, a damsel in distress
who leaps to her death for selling herself cheap. And when the Four
Muskateers dressed in elegant garb, brandishing swords and fencing side
by side, yell slogans like ‘All for One and One for All' – touching but
hardly the grand Dumas epic it should have been.</P>
