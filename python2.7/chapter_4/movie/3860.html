Rated PG [Parental Guidence suggested] in Ontario for profanity,

<PRE>Me: **1/2 (out of four stars)</PRE>
<P>     From the first ten minutes of the film NINE MONTHS, it becomes
fairly obvious what is the theme, and the storyline of the film is a
foregone conclusion.  Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing; surprise
has not usually been an essential element of recent romantic comedies,
and a clever, witty script can salvage even the most formulaic
plotlines.  Unfortunately, such a script was not to be found for this
film.</P>
<P>     The central character of NINE MONTHS is Samuel Faulkner, as played
by Hugh Grant.  At the outset of the film, Samuel is celebrating a
five-year relationship with girlfriend Rebecca Taylor (Julianne Moore)
with a beach picnic.  With the blatant revelation that Samuel seems
oblivious to Rebecca's longful stares at little children frolicking on
the beachside or her inferences to marriage, the audience can sit back
comfortably and foresee the character arc driving the film.</P>
<P>     Of course, Rebecca turns out to be pregnant, a concept which
horrifies Samuel to no end--this is reinforced by the contrived
introduction of the Dwyer couple, Marty and Gail (Tom Arnold and Joan
Cusack), whose three young daughters perpetually terrorize Samuel, and
by the advice of his best friend, Sean (Jeff Goldblum), a struggling
artist who conveniently happens to be Gail's brother.  Samuel's fears
are not alleviated when they end up with a first-time obstetrician (on
humans, anyway), Dr. Kosevich (Robin Williams), a Russian recently
emigrated to San Francisco.</P>
<P>     With such a cliched setup, the plotline and resolution of the film
becomes fairly obvious, and NINE MONTHS desperately requires something
to set it apart from other romantic comedies.  Unfortunately, it lacks
the sharp, tight script which could have made it more than just a
conventional Hollywood romantic comedy.  The dialogue is not
particularly clever, and the comedy is erratic.  There is a fair amount
of physical comedy, some of which borders upon sitcom quality, and the
film tends to weave between an attempt to honestly portray its
characters, and ridiculous caricatures not at all congruous in the
film.</P>
<P>     However, this is not to say that NINE MONTHS does not have its
merits.  The film certainly has the warm fuzzy feeling which permeates
from all of director Chris Columbus' biggest commercial hits (HOME
ALONE, MRS. DOUBTFIRE), and this is sure to appeal to a mass market
audience.  Columbus is effective in manipulating the audience during
the obligatory moving scenes throughout NINE MONTHS, and the pacing of
the movie is very well done.</P>
<P>     NINE MONTHS has a strong cast, none of which are utilized to their
fullest potential.  Hugh Grant, in his first American film lead role,
shows only flashes of the screen presence which made him a star in
1994's FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL, and which have carried him through
such varied roles over the years as in IMPROMPTU, SIRENS, THE LAIR OF
THE WHITE WORM, and THE ENGLISHMAN WHO WENT UP A HILL BUT CAME DOWN A
MOUNTAIN.  He is still able to carry the film, but this is not his best
work.  Julianne Moore is an excellent actress, and her role in NINE
MONTHS is certainly her highest-profile one to date; she's had
supporting roles in such blockbusters as THE FUGITIVE and THE HAND THAT
ROCKS THE CRADLE, but this one may increase her public awareness.
Moore is primarily a dramatic actress (with some of her outstanding
work including performances in SHORT CUTS, VANYA ON 42ND STREET, and
SAFE) and in NINE MONTHS she makes an understated but successful jump
into comedy.  Joan Cusack is a fabulous actress, and is wasted in this
film; she has no more than a handful of significant scenes in NINE
MONTHS.  Tom Arnold surprised many with his work in TRUE LIES as the
sidekick, and his role in this movie is similar in many ways - he
portrays an annoying but likably overbearing character.  However,
Arnold is not nearly as successful in this attempt; he fails to make
the Marty character any more than superficially likable (though the
annoying part of the character is all-too effective).  Jeff Goldblum is
good in a small role, and Robin Williams is charismatic (if over the
top) as the inept but eager Russian doctor.  (And if anyone can go over
the top and still remain effective, it's Robin Williams.)</P>
<P>     NINE MONTHS succeeds at becoming a light Hollywood
romantic-comedy, and fails to become anything beyond or better than
that.  It does generate superficial charm, but fails to exploit the
abilities of its cast.  On my four-star scale, I give NINE MONTHS
two-and-a-half stars.</P>
