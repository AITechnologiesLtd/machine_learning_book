TEA WITH MUSSOLINI (MGM)
Directed by Franco Zeffirelli</PRE>
<P> Like a story Grandma might tell about days gone by, "Tea With
Mussolini" takes its time to unfold and never leads to any great
earthshattering truths, but it's so quietly charming and engagingly
performed only the most callous viewers will tune out. Based on the
early chapters of director Franco Zeffirelli's autobiography, "Tea" is
set in the Italy of the 1930s and 1940s, a coming-of-age tale that's
more interested in its young hero's environment and influences than in
his adjustment to adulthood. Luca, played by Charlie Lucas as a child
and Baird Wallace as a teen, is a young Italian without a family, the
product of a brief liaison between a clothing tycoon and his mistress.
When the father's secretary and translator Mary (Joan Plowright) can no
longer stand seeing Luca being hidden away in a church-run orphanage she
agrees to look after him, enlisting the aid of her fellow "scorpioni,"
feisty Englishwomen who have settled in Florence to bask in the culture
and seemingly endless sunshine. "There are no illegitimate children in
this world," Mary insists. "Only illegitimate parents."
 So Luca becomes the surrogate son of the saintly Mary, the spirited
painter and would-be bohemian Arabella (Judi Dench) and the high-handed
Hester (Maggie Smith), a consummate snob who truly believes Fascist
leader Mussolini is a friend of hers since she's the widow of a British
ambassador. Outside this circle but destined to become a major force in
Luca's life is Elsa (Cher), a cheerfully brash American with a taste for
modern art, elderly millionaires and youthful lovers. When her latest
husband feigns a heart attack to halt another one of her spending
sprees, Elsa complains to her pal Georgy (Lily Tomlin) that "he's too
cheap to slip a poor girl a little Picasso."
 Though "Tea" doesn't have much in the way of a linear plot, the theme
of making sacrifices in the name of love is woven throughout its various
anecdotes. There's also a hint of "Cabaret" in the way the women ignore
the early signs of trouble in the late 1930s -- Fascist attacks on
citizens, the burning of foreign flags, mandatory registration of Jews,
etc. -- in the hope that soon everything will be back to normal and
their leisurely lives can begin again. Of course, that is not meant to
be; as Hester learns, just because one has taken tea with Mussolini does
not mean you're under Il Duce's protection.
 Plowright, Smith and Tomlin play to type quite effectively, while Dench
brings a subtle layer of pathos to Arabella, who's better at protecting
other people's masterpieces than she is at creating her own. Cher, in a
role ideally suited to her natural flamboyance, sparkles. In Elsa's most
telling moment, she's asked by one of her young Italian conquests if all
American women are as exciting as she is. "Alas," she sighes. "No." You
can say that again. James Sanford</P>
