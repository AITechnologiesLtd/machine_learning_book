<P>     FLAME, the first feature from British-born film maker Ingrid 
Sinclair, takes on the age-old issue of image versus reality in war, and 
how there is a price to be paid for even the most celebrated victories.  
Life in the military is hard, and, contrary to romanticized perceptions 
of it, there's far more brutality and ugliness than glory and adulation.  
This is a lesson that all soldiers must learn at one time or another, 
and a scenario that, because of its inherent strength, has been 
dramatized for the screen countless times before.  But, while the themes 
and ideas presented in FLAME are not unique, the setting and characters 
are.  The events related in this movie transpire during the late 1970s, 
when Zimbabwe's war for independence "spread like a bush fire."  The 
perspective is that of a pair of native female soldiers.  </P>
<P>     If there's a constant in the military, it's that men dominate the 
field of battle.  Regardless of the culture and time period, this has 
always been true, and the male bias of armies makes it especially 
difficult for would-be female soldiers.  Not only must they face the 
rigors of training, but they are forced to endure forms (some subtle, 
some obvious) of discrimination and sexual harassment.  FLAME makes 
clear what we expect:  such things happen in the untamed lands of Africa 
as readily as at the United States' famed military academies.</P>
<P>     FLAME introduces us to two adolescent girls, Florence (Marian 
Kunonga) and Nyasha (Ulla Mahaka), who, seduced by the romantic lure of 
a war for freedom, leave their small home town in Zimbabwe (which, at 
the time, was still known as Rhodesia) and travel on foot to Mozambique 
to be trained as soldiers.  One of the requirements for acceptance into 
a "liberation camp" is that they choose new names.  Nyasha becomes known 
as "Liberty" and Florence as "Flame."  Over the course of the war, 
Florence lives up to her new name, becoming one of the most courageous 
and passionate soldiers in her unit.  But tragedy dogs her steps:  she 
is raped, becomes pregnant, then faces several devastating losses.  In 
the end, even her close friendship with Nyasha is fractured, and it 
takes an epilogue years after the end of the war to offer healing and 
closure.</P>
<P>     At its heart, FLAME is less about war in general than about how the 
experience of being in the line of fire changes personalities.  Florence 
and Nyasha drift apart because their different roles in the militia mold 
their viewpoints.  Florence becomes involved in combat and is consumed 
by it; Nyasha, who joined the military to get an education, works as a 
typist.  While the gradual widening of the rift between them is 
presented effectively, the "big scene" that severs their relationship is 
abrupt and unsatisfactory.  In general, FLAME falters whenever a 
sequence demands a forceful display of emotion.  Neither the director 
nor her actors appear capable of elevating the production to that more 
critical level.</P>
<P>     While FLAME is interesting because of its unique perspective on a 
war that many North Americans know little about and its recognition of 
the contribution of women soldiers, it lacks the emotional depth 
necessary to transform it from a competent motion picture to a 
remarkable one.  Sinclair is a widely-respected documentary film maker, 
so it comes as a surprise that one of FLAME's flaws is that it doesn't 
seem real enough.  There isn't much attention to detail -- Sinclair is 
interested in telling her story, but not fine tuning it to the point 
where the audience develops more than a cursory sympathy for the main 
characters.  A film with such broad, rich material should touch an 
audience on a more fundamental level than the intellectual one.  FLAME 
never quite manages to accomplish that, making the experience of 
watching it worthwhile but incomplete.</P>
