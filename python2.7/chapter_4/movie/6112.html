                       A film review by A. S. Lenahan

<P>        THAT THING YOU DO! is the latest Tom Hanks film (meaning that it
will more than likely be box-office gold).  Past that, it is a good,
but not great, musical comedy.  It is entertaining, fun, a
crowd-pleaser, but also unoriginal and ultimately unmemorable.  The
largest stumbling block is the weak story, but the music, acting, and
sets/costumes make THAT THING YOU DO! an enjoyable evening at the
movies.  However, I doubt any of that matters... this film will do
well because of the involvement of  Tom Hanks as writer, director,
contributing songwriter, and actor.
        The plot is simple and eternally familiar.  Set in 1964, a talented
group of young musicians form a band, win a talent competition, and
(what else?) rocket to instant stardom.  A movie based on this
formula comes out every two years or so, so if you miss this one,
dont fret (although youll also miss Tom Hanks! Horrors!).  The
script is so reminiscent of so many other films, one wonders if
screenwriter Hanks might have used some kind of fill-in-the-blanks
screenplay template... sort of a Hollywood "Mad Libs".  The band is
named the Oneders (later the Wonders), the four lads play a catchy
tune called "That Thing You Do", and the song is recorded as a
record.  Along the way, we learn all the expected lessons: music
producers are sleazy, all glory is fleeting, the film industry is
shallow, etc.  Surprisingly, the film spares us the moral about
eating all our vegetables, but not by much.  All the characters are
based on others from some other film or television show.  The Wonders
are the Beatles (the movie itself even hints at this).  Theres a
typical over-emotional girlfriend (played by Liv Tyler).  The role
Hanks wrote for himself is surprisingly unglamourous: hes a sleazy
music producer, loosely based other similar shady charactersfrom
other films.  Theres even a philosophical Jazz musician, surely
familiar to anyone who remembers Bleeding Gums Murphy from "The
Simpsons".  Actually, the plot is not a bad one, but certainly not
original or fresh by any means.
        The acting is quite good, despite the small number of big names in
the cast.  All four of the Wonders have individual personality, and
are all very likable.  When I saw TTYD! in a theatre, the audience
applauded after every big musical number, a good sign for a film
obviously intended as a crowd-pleaser.  Hanks gives a fine
performance despite his stiff, unemotional character.  Tyler is
suitably whiny as well, but her character doesnt really become
important until the end, although a better script could have changed
that.  On a trivial note, vigilant viewers may be able to spot the
guy from the "Aaron Burr" milk commercial as a fan.  Collectively,
the acting adds a lot to the enjoyability of this movie.
        The most important aspect of TTYD! is the music.  The title tune
sounds as though it were pulled from some mid-sixties vinyl record. 
Its a catchy, memorable tune, so the audience might find it running
over and over in their head even after the credits roll.  The rest of
the soundtrack is a mixed bag; the pop music might take you back, but
the stilted, plastic jazz will leave any fan cold.  Oddly enough,
some of the music credit goes to Hanks (Im surprised he didnt try
to be the gaffer or key grip as well...).  TTYD! is a music film, so
the expectations are high, but the movie never disappoints.   
        Where the true charm of TTYD! lies is in the great nostalgic sets
and costumes.  Although the flashiest sets are the television studios
and hotels later in the film, my favourite was the electronics store
where it opens.  The authenticity of that set alone enhanced the
movie experience, at least for me.  The glistening pastel appliances,
the props, advertisement displays, even the overall washed-out
look--if that scene doesnt take you back to the mid-sixties, nothing
will.  The costumes are equally well-crafted, although perhaps less
spectacular.  The visual look of TTYD! has a certain realness rarely
seen in other period piece films.
        Obviously, TTYD! is not for those who demand a brilliant plot, but
it remains a fun and engaging movie.  Its intended as a fun film,
and accomplishes just that.  If only the plot offered *something*
new.  Anything...</P>
<PRE>Ratings on a 1.00-10.00 scale. 
1.00=terrible; 5.00=average;10.00=great.
