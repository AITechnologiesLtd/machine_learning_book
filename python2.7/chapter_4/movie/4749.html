<PRE>                        INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        I never thought I could endorse the movie that aligned 
pretty-boy stars Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas and 
Christian Slater and also inspired teenage losers with no identity to 
dye their hair red or black and wear those damn Army boots and Jim 
Morrison t-shirts everywhere. The ideal situation here would have 
involved me a) watching the movie, b) hating it, and c) writing a 
scathing review at the expense of Cruise, Pitt and weirdo novelist 
Anne Rice.</P>
<P>        Unfortunately for me, I enjoyed INTERVIEW WITH THE 
VAMPIRE from the beginning. It was fresh, original and--most 
importantly--violent. There were throat-slittings, beheadings and 
raging fires to appeal to the basest of animal instincts while 
counterbalancing that with intellectual prose obviously drawn straight 
from Rice's text. It does sound a little strange coming from the mouths 
of Cruise and Pitt, much like frat boys putting on a production of 
"Macbeth" ("Et tu, dude?"), but if you've ever had a fantasy about Brad 
Pitt eating a poodle (and please keep it to yourself if you have), 
INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE is the movie you've been waiting 
for.</P>
<P>        The story begins with vampire Pitt recounting his life story to 
reporter Slater. We learn of how Cruise sucked and sucked on his neck 
(I said NECK!) and how they both seemed to enjoy it a little too much. 
Soon, Pitt was an immortal with a thirst for blood, but since he was the 
humane kind, he had to suck the life out of rats and poodles instead. 
You know, with all the Morrison-worshipping vampire clones out 
there emulating this movie, that's the one thing I'd like to see one of 
those freaks do. Of course most of them _are_ vegetarians...</P>
<P>        Cruise attempts to placate Pitt by "vampirizing" a 12-year-old 
girl (Kristen Dunst, in a remarkable performance) for his pleasure. Ah 
yes, the old placate-the-pedophile trick. It doesn't work in this case, 
unless the result Cruise wanted was to have his throat cut. So with 
Cruise out of the picture, Pitt and Dunst are free to enjoy the 
Renaissance together. Sure, the whole Pitt-Dunst relationship is a little 
sick, but there's no suggestion of a sexual relationship between the 
two, although they _do_ share a coffin.</P>
<P>        Yes, INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE is plenty perverse, a 
dark movie with violence and suction for the whole family, 17 and up 
that is.</P>
