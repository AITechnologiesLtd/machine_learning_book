<PRE>                                MUTE WITNESS
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     The making of MUTE WITNESS must have been an incredible process.  The
first shots were taken back in 1985, when a chance encounter with the
film's "Mystery Guest Star" led to some on-the-fly cinematography.  In
1993, principal photography began in Moscow, only to be interrupted by
"fines" in customs, Boris Yeltsin's "October Revolution," -23 degree
weather, a diphtheria epidemic, a drug addicted actor, and another with
kidney disease.</P>
<P>     Nothing was boding well for first-time feature film writer/director
Anthony Waller (even this morning's screening was plagued with
difficulties).  But eventually, everything worked out, and MUTE WITNESS
has finally hit the big screen.</P>
<P>     After such an ominous start, you might be expecting a dismal film. 
Or, you might be the optimist and expect a gem.  MUTE WITNESS is neither. 
(At least they didn't call it SPEAK NO EVIL, completing the trilogy of
"handicapped victim of a killer" flicks.)</P>
<P>     The story is catchy:  an American, mute (not deaf) special
effects/makeup artist, Billy Hughes (Russian actress Marina Sudina), is
working in Moscow on a film.  Trapped in the studio after hours, she
witnesses a snuff film in the making, or so she thinks.  After escaping
from the bad guys, she tells her sister (Fay Ripley), her director/boss
(Evan Richards), and the cops, but no one believes her story.  Regardless,
an enigmatic man known as The Reaper (the "Mystery Guest Star"--I won't
spoil it), who organized said snuffing, wants Billy killed, and the chase
is on.</P>
<P>     Making the film-within-a-film in a Russian setting puts a few unique
spins on the classic stalker movie.  First (and worst) is lots and lots of
Russian dialogue, which I'm doubting many American viewers will
understand.  Second is a fair amount of obvious improvisation on the
screen, which tends to make the plot quite difficult to follow at times,
particularly when it goes off on its blackmail/double-cross tangent at the
end of the film.  Fortunately, the money saved on shooting in impoverished
Russia allowed Waller to spend it on some cool photography, a nice score,
and some of the best Russian actors the country has to offer.</P>
<P>     I really enjoyed Sudina's performance, and given that she has no
lines, it's easy to mistake her for a seasoned American pro, rather than a
Russian novice.  Supporting performances are fine, and Waller's clever
direction always gives us something interesting to look at, even if you
the script doesn't make any sense.</P>
<P>     All-in-all, MUTE WITNESS is a fair first effort, but believe me, it's
better than a lot of the crap Hollywood is passing off as thrillers these
days.  (Note:  In Russian, English, and sign language(!) without
subtitles.)</P>
