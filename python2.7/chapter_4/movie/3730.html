<PRE>                           NATURAL BORN KILLERS
                       A film review by Nizam Ahmed
                        Copyright 1995 Nizam Ahmed</PRE>
<P>     NATURAL BORN KILLERS was released in Britain in January and is
shortly to get its video release.  However, considering the hooplah of
publicity it received concerning the subject matter, and the new tough
stance on violence by the British Board of Film Classification, it may
not be released at all.  RESERVOIR DOGS took two years to appear on the
small screen, so things don't bode well for Oliver Stone's relentless
depiction of two serial killers on the rampage.</P>
<P>     The film purports to be a bizarre, twisted look at the life and
killings of Mickey & Mallory Knox, and in particular attempts to
concentrate on the media feeding frenzy that turns them into prime-time
TV celebrities.  We see how they got together in a brilliant parody of
US TV sitcoms, seen through the broken memory of Mallory (Juliette
Lewis).  Their killing spree down the highways of the midwest is
documented from th point of view of top-rated docudrama American
Psychos, fronted by a manic Robert Downy Jr.  We see their downfall and
imprisonment at the hands of an obsessed cop who's just as twisted as
the prey he hunts, and an amazing climax that stokes up the excitement
to boiling point.</P>
<P>     Oliver Stone uses the screenplay (originally by Quentin Tarantino)
to throw every cinematic technique in the book at the viewer.
Flashbacks, video montages, back-projection, fast-cutting, black and
white, monotone, and the weirdest camera angles you're ever likely to
see combine to give you a visual bombardment that leaves you feeling
exhausted at all the images you have had to take in.  I get the
impression this was a deliberate ploy by Stone - you're supposed to be
looking inside the head of a serial killer here, it's bound to be
exhausting.  The only problem is, he uses it to overkill.  It's not
just the nutters in the film who get this technique to serve as
"thought bubbles," the entire film is enveloped in it.  If Stone is
trying to suggest that everyone's a potential murderer, fine, but give
the viewer the chance to work it out for themselves.</P>
<P>     Woody Harrelson as Mickey Knox is brilliant, absolutely faultless,
and Juliette Lewis is disturbingly convincing as Mallory.  She seems to
be making a habit of playing disturbed females. "Cheers" will never be
the same again.  Robert Downey Jr hams it up well as the supposed
villain of the piece, although a film where two convicted serial
killers are the heroes is a strange inversion.  I suppose it mirrors
the idea that the "media made them superstars".  Another reason for
seeing this powerful but flawed film is a thundering soundtrack, that
echoes the imagery of the film in its loud, in-your-face style.  Rap,
country, heavy metal, it all just seems so right.</P>
<P>     In the end though, it all depends on whether you will succumb to
Stone's unique brand of moralizing.  PLATOON was hardly subtle, but it
won Oscars.  This is even less subtle and very heavy-handed in its
criticism of the media.  There are scenes which reach farcical
proportions in their attempts to "visualize" the media celebrity idea.
But their is a certain pulp poetry in here somewhere, and it certainly
stands out, if not head and shoulders, at least shoulders above the
other films of the year.</P>
