<P>   Stories abound about adolescent men who rebel against
their fathers in search of freedom.  "Character" deals with
such a rebellion, but with a difference: the young man on
whom the story centers has a dad who does not live with him,
seems to want nothing to do with him, and by rights should be
just about the last person a kid would want to free himself
from.  As the tale develops, however, we see that geography
notwithstanding, the stolid father is very much involved in the
lives of his boy and the lad's mother though he had not spent
a single day with either from the time the kid was born.</P>
<P>   What gives "Character" its claim to award-winning status (it
won the Oscar for best foreign language movie of 1997) is
only partly its gripping narrative.  Set in Rotterdam and filmed
by Rogier Stoffers, virtually the entire picture, directed by Mike
van Diem, is shrouded in shadow, symbolic of the despairing
mood of all of its principal male characters.  Taking place in
the 1920s, it exhibits a Netherlands populace ground down by
unemployment and becoming increasingly sympathetic to the
entreaties of the Communist Party--which urges the working
class to demonstrate and even burn down the factories of the
hated propertied classes.  Told in flashback, "Character"
opens on a violent confrontation between Katadreuffe (Fedja
Van Huet) and his larger-than-life father, Dreverhaven (Jan
Decleir) in a large loft-like office occupied by the older man,
who is entering figures in a ledger.  In the film's most
theatrical scene, the young man strides briskly to his father's
desk and almost literally flies at him, determined to do the old
man great injury.  When Dreverhaven is found dead of a knife
wound to the stomach, Katadreuffe is hauled away by the
police to a bleak cell where he is questioned by three
interrogators and proceeds to unfold the story of life with
father.</P>
<P>   From what we have seen so far, it appears clear enough
that the young man has murdered his father, but his crime
comes across to the audience as justified by circumstances. 
We learn that some twenty years earlier, Dreverhaven
seduced his housekeeper, Joba (Betty Schuurman), in a one-
night-stand that led to Katadreuff's birth.  Joba had left the
man's employ shortly after becoming pregnant and, like a nun
in the strictest orders, seems to have taken a vow of silence. 
Indifferent to her young son, she encourages him to earn his
own living and leave her house.  While many children brought
up in such Dickensian circumstances of poverty and neglect
might choose the road of drugs and crime, Katadreuffe
became determined to succeed in business but not without
trying: he sacrifices the possibility of a loving relationship with
the beautiful Lorna te George (Tamar van den Dop) in favor
of hard study in his endeavor to rise as high as he can in a
prestigious Rotterdam law firm.  Requiring a loan to pursue
his studies, he unwittingly accepts credit from a bank owned
by his emotionally remote father, who uses his position as
creditor to destroy the young man.</P>
<P>    "Karakter," as the movie is spelled in the original Dutch,
gets its title from the notion of the narrator (Katadreuffe) that
his character and that of his mother are quite different. 
Budgeted at three million dollars--a high figure by Dutch
standards--Mike Van Diem's movie, based on a novel by F.
Bordewijk, evokes the ways in which serious Dutch films, and
perhaps sober European films in general, differ from those
constructed by Hollywood studios.  As bleak as George
Sluizer's 1988 movie "The Vanishing"--which ends with the
burial alive of a man and his girlfriend but was remade by the
Americans with a more upbeat ending--"Character" is as bleak
a description of a father-son relationship as has been
portrayed on any screen.  What is particularly absorbing,
though, are the film's nuances.  Though at first view the brutal
Dreverhaven represents unmitigated evil, evicting his non-
rent-paying tenants by the busload and pressing bankruptcy
claims in the courts, he turns out to be a man with a
conscience under his fascist-like exterior.  He does not
dismiss his former housekeeper, Joba, as an insignificant
victim of his lust, but has a more puzzling set of feelings
toward her.  Even more engaging is the intricacy of his
dealings with his son: the movie veers toward an unexpected
twist in its concluding scenes, which stagger the imagination.  </P>
<P>   Van Diem unfolds the film with a succession of visceral
scenes, highlighted by one in which Dreverhaven, who
emerges from his bed naked to inquire about a communist-
inspired riot taking place outside his home, is stoned, kicked
and reviled by the unwashed masses.  As heavy as the movie
gets, Van Diem does not ignore the opportunity to inject some
humor into the piece, the fun represented by the kindly but
prognathic man who becomes Katadreuffe's mentor, and with
the possibility of romance evoked by the lovely Tamar van
den Dop as Katadreuff's co-worker, Lorna te George.</P>
<P>   Van Diem has a good feel for the period, permeating the
film with the automobiles of the twenties and extracting
examples of the cultural norms of the era.  Particularly
amusing is the custom of co-workers calling each other by
their last names even after months of familiarity. 
Not Rated.  Running time: 114 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten
