                      A film review by Timothy Voon

<P>In one of the most original and critically acclaimed movies this year,
we have a non-hysterical Jim Carrey in his most thought provoking,
intelligent role to date. This is the way I like Carrey - away from pets
and cable. Peter Weir has mixed a nice cocktail of comedy and drama that
will keep you engrossed throughout the film. The question is whether in
reality, mankind would stoop to this lowest form of entertainment,
watching another man's life fully played out on the TV screen like a
soap opera. It is an obvious invasion of privacy, but highlights our
voyeuristic tendencies and curiosity about the private lives of others.</P>
<P>If this movie carried a theme, it would be the marked abuse of human
rights. In this claustrophobic world a man called Truman is raised in
front of television, under the scrutiny of the producer/director
Christof (Ed Harris) and the world. Truman does not know that his life
has been recorded on camera since birth, but begins to gravely suspect
the possibilities, when his father returns from the dead, a light prop
drops out of the sky and when he is unable to leave town.</P>
<P>Wonderful aspects include how delightfully this movie is filmed, from a
camera like view. It also highlights how blatant advertising has become,
when products are engineered into a ‘live' television show. However, the
story is probably what makes this movie. It is the journey of one man in
search of himself and the need to discover the meaning of the world
around him. His search for true love and need to explore, drives him to
escape the lunacy of his man-imposed prison. It displays the uniqueness
of the human spirit, where no barriers can stop a man from overcoming
the adverse forces that wish to contain him. It is people like Truman
who dream of walking on the moon, flying to the stars, or in Truman's
case – sailing to Fiji.</P>
<P>A well made movie, wonderfully directed by Peter Weir, ingeniously
written by Andrew Niccol and sensitively portrayed by Jim Carrey.
Certainly an Oscar contender for 1999.</P>
