<PRE>                                   TOUCH
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     TOUCH is a film about healing through stigmata.  For those of you
like myself who recognize the word but have no idea what it means, the
movie's information kit defines it as "a spontaneous manifestation of
bloody wounds on a person's hands, feet, and side, similar to wounds of
the crucified Jesus Christ."  It goes on to claim that over 300 cases
have been recorded.</P>
<P>     With this much information you probably figure TOUCH is another
movie from some religious order.  Wrong.</P>
<P>     The director is Paul Schrader, who also wrote the screenplay based
on the book by Elmore Leonard.  Schrader is a director who likes his
material on the edge.  His two best movies were CAT PEOPLE (1982) with
Nastassja Kinski and PATTY HEARST (1988) with Natasha Richardson.  The
first featured a scene where a naked Kinski runs like a cat through the
woods with the blood of a rabbit dripping from her mouth.  The second
has Richardson locked in a dark closet for scene after scene while
Cinque screams profanities at her.</P>
<P>     As you can now guess, Schrader approaches TOUCH in ways that other
directors might not.  As always, he attracts a high caliber cast.
Although TOUCH does have its moments, I spent most of the movie as
confused as the actors.  As occasional nervous laughter crept into what
was otherwise an unusually silent press screening, I kept asking
myself: Was this line supposed to be funny?  Are we laughing with the
show or at it?</P>
<P>     Most of the actors were confused as to whether they were in a
serious film or a comedy.  Others seemed to feel they were in a parody.
Many scenes were quite enjoyable, and yet...</P>
<P>     Perhaps it was the movie's beginning that turned me off.  Any show
that starts with someone throwing objects at a television screen
because he does not like what is playing puts my cliche meter
immediately into the red zone.</P>
<P>     As it turned out, the guy doing the throwing was an alcoholic, and
his wife was blind.  Someone, who goes by the unlikely name of Juvenal
(Skeet Ulrich), comes to the rescue of the abusive husband.  Juvenal,
whose real name we will learn is Charlie Lawson, works at the alcoholic
treatment center at Sacred Heart.  When he sees that the man's wife is
blind, he holds her head, bleeds on her (see stigmata definition
above), and restores her sight.</P>
<P>     Skeet Ulrich's acting makes the picture.  You are never sure what
he is going to do next, and he has the innocence of a true faith
healer.  Juvenal has supposedly spent the last six years in a jungle in
Brazil, and Ulrich's performance make this easily believable.  His
goatee and overall appearance are meant to remind the audience of Jesus
without trying to copy some religious picture exactly.</P>
<P>     An ex-minister named Billy Hill (Christopher Walken) who now sells
recreational vehicles witnesses the miracle.  Since Hill's specialty is
religious cons, he smells money.  With the help of his fellow con
artist Lynn Faulkner (Bridget Fonda), who used to twirl the baton at
his services, he tries to find out about Juvenal.  Walken and Fonda are
great actors and watching them pull off these ambiguous roles was one
of the delights of the film.</P>
<P>     In an unnecessary side plot, probably to boost ticket sales, Lynn
and Juvenal have a fling so both get to take their clothes off.  This
also allows Lynn to inquire when doing her lover's laundry, "Do you
think it's all right?  Stigmata blood in the wash?"  And Juvenal can
confess to her, "I bleed from five wounds and heal people, but I've
never been in love."</P>
<P>     TOUCH bogs now more than you would expect from a Paul Schrader
film.  In one long scene, for example, Walken and Fonda are forced to
sit around making small talk.  Walken is better doing something creepy,
and Fonda seems too intelligent to bother with this meaningless banter.</P>
<P>     Easily the weakest character in the film, Tom Arnold gets large
amounts of screen time as August Murray, the head of a protest movement
within the Roman Catholic Church.  His group is known as "the gray army
of the Holy Ghost."  They break up masses with guitar singing priests
by stripping the priests of their vestments during the service.  Latin
is the only language for their church.  Their gray shirts are
reminiscent of Hitler's brown shirts.  Arnold's performance borders on
the embarrassing.</P>
<P>     The movie is full of known actors.  Paul Mazursky plays a record
producer who spends most of his time on his cell phone.  A director and
an actor, Mazursky has had mixed success with both careers.  Here he is
the most wasted of all of the actors.  He is not asked to do much and
he doesn't.  He gets lines like, "A prompt man is a lonely man."</P>
<P>     Lolita Davidovitch appears as a stripper whose son is cured of
leukemia by Juvenal.  Davidovitch acts with great gusto in what is a
part so small that it would have vanished without her energy.</P>
<P>     Janeane Garofalo, who was so wonderful in THE TRUTH ABOUT CATS &
DOGS, has a part as the skeptical newspaper reporter Cathy Worthington.
Garofalo takes her few lines and makes them special by her mere
presence.</P>
<P>     The show will build toward a visit by Juvenal to see Debra
Lusanna, an Oprah style talk show host played by Gina Gershon.
"Controversy is my oxygen," Lusanna says.  "It's the air I breathe."
Gershon's acting abilities appear limited to large smiles.</P>
<P>     An off-beat show, certainly.  And sometimes, an interesting one.
But too much of its far out humor just doesn't work.</P>
<P>     TOUCH runs just 1:37.  It is rated R.  There is some male and
female nudity, a little sex, a little violence, and a few cuss words.
Perhaps it was the sacrilegious aspects that got it the R, but I would
have expected the film to have gotten a PG-13.  The show would be fine
for any teenager and perhaps those just a bit younger if they can
understand the humor in the material.  I liked parts of the show
especially some of the acting, but cannot bring myself to recommend it.
I give it **.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
