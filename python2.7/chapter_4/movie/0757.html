<PRE>                              DRIVING MISS DAISY
                       A film review by Rogers Cadenhead
                        Copyright 1990 Rogers Cadenhead</PRE>
<P>     I just saw DRIVING MISS DAISY this week, and I enjoyed the film because it
was made by people who know how to keep quiet.  The American cinema today is
filled with brash, boisterous films where shootouts are common and
confrontations are as dramatic and polarized as the hero-villain relationship
in LETHAL WEAPON II: The black cop faced South African stooges and the stooges
also just happened to be the guys who killed the white cop's beloved wife.  Can
there be a more cut-and-dried (black-and-white) case of justifiable provocation
than that?  Blow 'em up real good, Murtaugh!  Riggs!  Hooray!</P>
<P>     In DAISY, the biggest confrontations of the whole film involve a can of
salmon and an insidiously phrased sentence by a cop.  The salmon was supposed
to be Daisy's evidence that Hoke, her black chauffeur, was a thief.  The
sentence, "What kind of name is Werthan?"  showed the true face of racism and
anti-Semitism.  It isn't -- at least not for the vast majority -- bovine men in
hoods with burning torches and rope.  It is people in power who use their hate
to oppress people in seemingly negligible ways because they know they can get
away with it.  The cops saw a "nigger and an old Jew woman" and decided they
were suspicious.  And they have a right to check out suspicious people.</P>
<P>     That scene with the two policeman sunk into my gut, and that sinking was a
surprise to me.  Nothing in MISSISSIPPI BURNING was quite as painful, even
though it was a painful film about a painful time.  But DAISY hurt more because
it was more real.</P>
<P>     When filmmakers (and excellent performers) can strip away the excesses of
drama and show bits of unmasked reality like that, it is an achievement.
Jessica Tandy (Daisy) and the film deserved their accolades.  (On a
not-entirely-unrelated note, DO THE RIGHT THING was unjustly snubbed -- Spike
Lee is the most real filmmaker to  come along in years.  He has more to say
about black America as a segment and part of the whole than any legion of
sensitive white liberals in the entertainment business).</P>
