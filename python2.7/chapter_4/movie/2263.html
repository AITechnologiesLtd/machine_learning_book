<P>     If you feel it necessary to classify movies, A PERFECT WORLD may
be difficult to pigeonhole.  On the surface, this might seem like a
buddy movie crossed with a road picture, but there's a depth that
defies anything normally found in either genre.  What starts out
looking like a good old Clint Eastwood cops-and-robbers tale turns into
something completely unexpected.</P>
<P>     Halloween night in 1963 starts out as any October 31st for
eight-year old Phillip Perry (T. J. Lowther), with his mother, a devout
Jehovah's Witness, refusing to let him go trick-or-treating.  In fact,
that's not the only thing on the boy's list of "forbidden items."  He
can't celebrate Christmas, has never eaten cotton candy, and hasn't
ridden a roller coaster.  Life seems a little dull, until Butch Haynes
(Kevin Costner) bursts into his kitchen.  Recently escaped from prison,
Butch is in need of a hostage, and Phillip happens to be in the wrong
place at the wrong time.  Strangely, the boy instinctively trusts
Butch, and goes along meekly.  The ride starts out a little bumpy, with
Butch's sadistic fellow escapee attempting to molest the hostage--a
situation that Butch sorts out permanently.  Then, when it's only the
two of them, Butch and Philip head across Texas with Police chief Red
Garnett (Clint Eastwood) and his band of Rangers in pursuit.</P>
<P>     Those who understand the psychology of hostage situations are
aware of the bond that develops between captive and captor.  The case
presented in A PERFECT WORLD, however, is far from normal, even for
these circumstances.  The connection between Kevin Costner's Butch and
T. J.  Lowther's Phillip isn't something nebulous, but a
father-and-son-like relationship that profoundly affects both of them.
Once they're together, neither of them can be the same--not
spiritually, physically, or morally.</P>
<P>     This relationship is the centerpiece of A PERFECT WORLD, and
director Clint Eastwood allows it to play out at the leisurely pace
necessary for it to achieve its ultimate depth and power.  There are a
few brief action scenes punctuating the drama, but this is not a movie
for the viewer who craves car chases and shootouts.</P>
<P>     On the surface, the scenes featuring Eastwood appear largely
superfluous and, while they aren't strictly necessary to the plot, they
nevertheless serve an important purpose.  A PERFECT WORLD wouldn't be
best served by presenting the Butch/Phillip sequences without
interruption.  The pacing would be too slow; the tone too somber.  The
inclusion of a storyline focusing on Butch's pursuers allows for a few
more characters, an opportunity or two of comic relief, and a subplot
that ties a few things together a little too neatly.</P>
<P>     Like his star, Kevin Costner, Clint Eastwood is a better director
than actor.  In A PERFECT WORLD, he again wears both hats, although his
on-screen appearances are limited.  Eastwood the actor has two
modes--the cynical tough guy and the sensitive tough guy, both of which
are on display here (the former more often than the latter).  He's in
fine form, but it's his behind-the-scenes work that really deserves the
credit.  A PERFECT WORLD has its moments of manipulation, but they are
masterfully subtle.  With films like THE JOY LUCK CLUB, we feel the
strings being tugged; such is not the case with this movie.</P>
<P>     Kevin Costner is an unusual actor--his performances are as
inconstant as his choices of films.  For every DANCES WITH WOLVES,
there's a THE BODYGUARD.  His job in A PERFECT WORLD, however, is
something to take pride in.  Perhaps Eastwood deserves a share of the
credit, but Costner develops a credible character who comes across as
both believable and sympathetic despite his obvious criminal nature.
The portrayal eclipses the portrayer, which is always a good sign.</P>
<P>     Laura Dern is wasted.  I can only assume her inclusion is an
attempt to present a strong-willed, intelligent woman as a foil for
Clint Eastwood, but her ability is rarely shown and never developed.
Ms. Dern does a surprisingly good job with what little material she
has, but her presence isn't necessary, and it adds little.</P>
<P>     A PERFECT WORLD is evidence that Hollywood is still capable of
producing the kinds of moving, intelligent movies that many people
today believe to be solely the province of independent film makers.
This picture is good enough to stand with THE PIANO and THE REMAINS OF
THE DAY, rightfully claiming to offer as much as they do.  The
characters here have depth and breadth, and the themes and
relationships are as complex as in any of the year's best offerings.</P>
<P>     Clint Eastwood won an Oscar for directing UNFORGIVEN, and A
PERFECT WORLD shows that the wellspring of talent is still bubbling
energetically.  May it never run dry.</P>
