<P>Directed by Rintaro. Unrated (would be rated R due to strong, pervasive
animated violence and nudity).</P>
<P>I am not at all an anime (adult Japanese animation) aficionado; I have
seen very little and what I have seen has not particularly enthused me.
But here, at long last, is an anime I can get excited about. X, made in
1996 and only now getting to America, is complex, rather confusing but
outrageously exciting all the same. It's an apocalyptic vision,
superficially not unlike End of Days, except that it has an interesting
plot that actually makes some sense. Though at times hampered by
awkward dialogue and less-than-fluid action sequences, X remains a
riveting adult science fiction adventure.</P>
<P>At the center of the story is a young man named Kamui. In a dream he
sees his deceased mother, who tells him to go to Tokyo, though she
doesn't specify why. Curious, he follows her advice and goes to the
city. Once there, he seeks out his best friend Fuma and his sister
Kotori. In the meantime, a mysterious Oracle visits him in his dreams.
She tells him the story of the Dragon of the Earth and the Dragon of
Heaven, two opposing armies who are about to fight the final battle for
the future of the planet. If the Dragon of the Earth wins, mankind will
be wiped out and the planet will be cleansed of the species that, in
their constant effort to better their lifestyle, destroyed it. If the
Dragon of Heaven wins, mankind -- and the city of Tokyo -- will be
saved.</P>
<P>The kicker is that Kamui, whose name stands for "Power of God," has the
power to decide the outcome of the war by siding with one of the
armies. The Oracle and her group of mankind supporters urge Kamui to
side with the Dragon of Heaven but the Oracle's evil sister has other
plans. She recruits Fuma, who is rumored to have the exact same powers
as Kamui and tells him that whatever Dragon Kamui becomes, Fuma must
become the other. Their Destiny is Preordained (that is actually one of
the versions of the title); they must fight each other to the death.</P>
<P>The movie is brief, fast and furious. It rarely stops to explain
anything and if you get lost, you're left behind. But if you pay
attention and take a couple of small steps into suspension of
disbelief, X becomes an immensely satisfying experience. The plot is
farfetched, yes, but it's also utterly engrossing; we don't just see
our planet being put at risk, we care. The plot moves along so fast
that if something in it becomes unclear the best thing to do is forget
about it and concentrate on what's on-screen because otherwise you lose
track. That can happen at any moment and yet I was involved enough in
the story that I tried desperately (and, thank God, was ultimately
successful) to keep it together in my mind. That has to be a good sign.</P>
<P>Another good aspect of the storyline is the idea of two friends pitted
against each other by insurmountable fate. The idea is not a new one,
but it still manages to be effective pathos when done correctly. Helped
out tremendously by a poignant ending, X manages to turn the tables,
avoid the formulas and weave a compelling human story into a kinetic
science fiction thriller.</P>
<P>The film is not without its problems. Japanese must be a very difficult
language to translate because the few animes that I have seen have all
featured very awkward dialogue. Perhaps it's the culture difference, I
don't know. With a plot as feverishly fast as this one, you tend not to
care about the authenticity of the dialogue, but some conversations are
so cringe-worthy, you can't help but notice. It's also worth mentioning
that some of the action sequences are a little confusing, with
explosions everywhere and people jumping all over the place, making it
hard to keep track of what exactly is going on.</P>
<P>If you go see X, do not buy a beverage. If you have to go to the
bathroom, you might as well not come back. It will most likely take all
of your concentration to keep up with the movie, but it will be worth
it.</P>
