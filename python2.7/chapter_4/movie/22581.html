<P>         As directed by Steven Soderbergh, "The Limey" is a thriller
almost as jarring as the rhyming Cockney slang used by its central
character, the stoic Wilson, played with frozen fire in his eyes by the
great Terence Stamp. What sounds in synopsis like a fairly mundane story
of vengeance comes across on the screen as a collage of images, music
and crackling dialogue. Frequently, Soderbergh will take a simple
conversation and stage it in different locations, then skip blithely
between the various versions, using the soundtrack as the ribbon to hold
the pieces together. Although the effect initially seems like a gimmick
or perhaps a throwback to the "mod" caper films of the late 1960s, it
turns out to be a clever way to handle Lem Dobbs' no-frills screenplay.</P>
<P> To balance Stamp's anti-hero, Soderbergh has cast another icon
of 30 years ago. As Terry Ballantine, a slick, devious record producer
who represents the worst L.A. has to offer, Peter Fonda oozes cool charm
and smarm. The director introduces both men with theme songs from the
Flower Power era: Wilson gets the Who's "The Seeker" ("They call me the
seeker, I been searching low and high/I won't get to get what I'm after
'til the day I die"), while Ballantine is saddled with the Hollies'
bitter "King Midas in Reverse." "You're not specific enough to be a
person," Terry's most recent bedmate tells him. "You're more like a
vibe."</P>
<P> In contrast, Wilson is pure grit, an ex-con who's flown in to
Terry's world to seek retribution for the death of his daughter Jenny
(Melissa George) who perished in a suspicious car crash, apparently
after getting too close to the truth about her boyfriend Ballantine.
"The Limey" quickly builds to a clash between these two wildly different
titans, both of whom are haunted by their pasts.</P>
<P>  "What's England anyway?" one of Terry's cohorts cracks. "Some
rinkydink country half the size of Wyoming where the cops don't even
carry guns." Ah, but British criminals certainly do pack heat and, in
Wilson's case, know how to use it.</P>
<P> There's plenty of violence in "The Limey," but what Soderbergh
truly seems concerned with is creating an impressionistic mood piece. As
he did in his last movie, the dynamic 1998 suspenser "Out of Sight," the
filmmaker has great fun trying to catch his audience off-guard, tossing
in a burst of humor when you least expect it (one of the guests at
Terry's party confesses "the first Christopher Cross album -- wow, man,
that changed my life"), or taking a few minutes of extra time to let
Wilson talk about his alienation from Jenny with the young woman's best
friend, an understanding speech coach (Lesley Ann Warren). Since Wilson
spent most of Jenny's childhood in one prison or another, she began
calling him "Daddy the Friendly Ghost."</P>
<P> The 1960s motif is further reinforced by Soderbergh's marvelous
insertion of clips of the young Stamp playing a hood (named Wilson,
coincidentally) in director Ken Loach's 1967 drama "Poor Cow." It's a
smart alternative to the usual phoney-looking flashbacks we're used to
seeing in Hollywood films, in which makeup artists struggle to erase 20
or 30 years from the faces and hair of middle-aged stars. James Sanford</P>
