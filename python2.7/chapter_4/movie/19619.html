<P>I admit I was prepared to dislike this movie, being a BIG fan of the
original 1963 version, (which, along with THE INNOCENTS and Nigel
Kneale's THE WOMAN IN BLACK, is one of the best "ghost" films ever made)
and make no mistake, this is a BAD film--a mangled mess that uses
elements from not only the Wise version and other sources, and
completely ignores the original novel--but strangely enough, I can
hardly wait to see it again.  It was hilarious--and after getting over
the disappointment that it wasn't going to be good, (it's REAL obvious
early on) this is the most fun I've had at the movies in a long time. 
It's a carnival ride, the Disneyland Haunted-House times 10, and if
you're familiar with the glories of Robert Wise's original masterpiece,
this movie is going to have you laughing like a hyena at the
jaw-droppingly audacious deviations and liberties taken here, and that
are asked to be taken seriously.   This film is perhaps the ultimate
parody--a skewed, big-budget comedy that's too dim to realize it's
funny--making the laughs (at the hilarious expense of its makers) all
the more hysterical.  It is truly a disaster of biblical, Ed-Woodian
magnitude-- and perhaps the most entertaining film out there this
summer.  </P>
<P>Okay, I know this movie had to appeal to a 90's audience, and I was well
aware it would have a more heavy-handed approach than the Robert Wise
version, (definitely still "the good version") but that doesn't begin to
describe the wayward path this film traipses down.  To say there are
literal ghosts in THE HAUNTING is a maximum understatement; the ghosts
here are more or less the equivelent of DeBont's climactic tornado in
TWISTER; they're big, they're loud, and they fling debris.  In fact,
there are several interesting parallels to TWISTER here, another being
that the team assembled to beard Hill House is similar to the neurotic
band of tornado-chasers, who ultimately confront and experience the
big-villain, cyclone-ghost of Hugh Crane, (manifesting itself
hilariously-- looking here about as  frightening as "The Beast" from the
animated Disney "Beauty & the Beast.")</P>
<P>Somewhere around 20 minutes into the film, you realize it's not going to
be good.  Another 10 minutes, and you give up hoping for coherence.  By
the time the ghosts start manifesting, you're well-aware the filmmakers
have floundered and there's no hope of rescue.  But it doesn't
matter--one thing this movie never is, is boring.  Hill House literally
tears itself apart to get at its pesky investigators, and the whole
thing degenerates into chaos, as bedrooms develop faces, woodwork hands
flail from the moulding, and cherubic marble children's heads gasp and
scream their ghostly little lungs out.  The effects are, as expected,
amazing and impressive, but since they're so in-your-face, it's hard not
to be totally aware of the filmmakers desperate realization that unless
they could make this an effects-extravaganza, how would they ever
compete with THE PHANTOM  MENACE (just next door?!)   Typical of the
summer blockbuster mentality whose sole purpose for being is that they
dazzle us visually, THE HAUNTING  makes no attempt to be suggestive or
scary--and it settles for a totally new, laughable "origin" of Hill
House's haunting.  </P>
<P>In the novel (and Wise's original film) the psychological background of
Eleanor, her neurosis, and vulnerability, become the basis for all the
ghostly phenomena--making the film and novel function on several levels,
and creating a sense of doubt in the viewer's (reader's) mind;  Is Hill
House really haunted with literal ghosts--?  Or is Eleanor making these
things happen herself, unknowingly using the house to project her
phobias and insecurities into visible and audible phenomena?  Since
she's obviously a powerful medium, (it's suggested she was responsible
for a childhood poltergeist attack) Eleanor is the most likely candidate
for being the unwitting culprit that actually "haunts" the
house--regardless of the "evil history" of the place.  This is suggested
with some subtlety in Wise's film.  In DeBont's, it appears this was
considered, as some initial attempts to delineate Nell's character
follow the original's set up, (the "mother banging on the wall" is
suggested early on) but after arriving at the house, this all becomes
immaterial and falls by the wayside in favor of a new "explanation" of
Nell's connection to the house; an extremely trite, ridiculously
unbelievable one that makes all the subtleties concrete, and turns THE
HAUNTING completely away from a psychological study, and into the
lamest, most literal (and clunkingly unscary) ghost story ever.  </P>
<P>I admit, you shouldn't compare a remake to the original in cases like
this, but even as its own monster, this new version fails to work on any
level approaching coherency.  If they're going to create a totally new
story, why bother establishing a set up that suggests the old one?  If
the ghosts are literal, why attempt to make Nell neurotic and vulnerable
in the first place?  In fact, this version seems to be more a remake,
not of THE HAUNTING--but of Richard Matheson's HELL HOUSE--right down to
the (unintentionally funny) shouting-match confrontation with the main
ghost at the end.  This is one howlingly dumb movie.</P>
<P>Still, there's a lot to admire here.  The sets (omigod--the SETS!) are
some of the most baroquely impressive I've ever seen--Hill House is so
crammed-to-the-gills with statuary, stone lions, cherubs, and ponderous
bric-a-brac that it would be impossible to sleep in one of the palatial,
overly-ornate rooms for all the overstimulation of visual input.  In
fact, the house is much scarier in the initial scenes before anything
overtly ghostly takes place, as the sets are so overwhelmingly heavy
with gloomy portent, you almost convince yourself you see statuary and
marble faces move before they actually do (later).  Bruce Dern has a
cameo as Dudley the caretaker, and he's fun (he and his screen-wife get
the film's last word), as is the actress playing Mrs. Dudley (a nice
touch is her "In the night... in the dark," monologue, lifted virtually
verbatum from the original film--and played for the film's one
successful, intentional laugh).  </P>
<P>Lili Taylor is surprisingly weak here, becoming an irritating, whiny
presence in quick order--and playing Nell as overtly (and goofily) nutty
in some scenes when they don't really call for that approach.  Liam
Neeson is nearly forgotten, his character being peripheral in all
respects once the film gets going.  Jones is a bright spot as Theo, but
her bisexual character never attempts the tension of Clair Bloom's
performance in the original--and she's just so gosh-wow CHEERFUL!  Then
there's the actor playing Luke Sannerson (can't remember his name) who
reminds me of Trey Parker, creator of SOUTH PARK.  Weirdly, he becomes
the most  likable character in THE HAUNTING--someone the audience can
identify with and laugh at, as he reacts to the spooky
surroundings--until he abruptly meets his end in one of the films most
outlandishly retarded deviations--a scene that brought gales of laughter
from the crowd.</P>
<P>As a serious film, THE HAUNTING fails spectacularly in any of its
ambitions.  As a remake, it can't hold a candle.  As an adaptation of
the novel, it's obvious no one associated with this movie even read it. 
As an original "haunted house" story, it fails to fulfil, or remain
coherent to, its own set up.  But it may just be the comedy hit of the
summer--the audience we saw it with was hooting and howling with
derisive laughter throughout--and I enjoyed the hell out of it. 
Therefore, I give this film an entertainment rating of 10--as one of the
most unintentionally hilarious films I've ever seen.  Psychotronically,
it stands with the musical remake of LOST HORIZON as a paragon of the
"golden turkey"--one of those special "bad" films we love to
hate--because it's so flagrently, deliciously rotten.  </P>
