<P>     Over-praised even more than Ron Howard's good-but-not-that-good
APOLLO 13, the last Jane Austen adaptation of the year (after CLUELESS
and PERSUASION) is a sweet, stately affair.  The story stars Emma
Thompson and Kate Winslet (HEAVENLY CREATURES) as two sisters-sans-
dowries, anxious to be married even if their cash-flow problems may
preclude same.  The suitors do come, of course, and all sorts of
silliness ensues as everyone tries to figure out exactly who is engaged
to whom.</P>
<P>     The charms of SENSE AND SENSIBILITY are many, thanks in great part
to the warmth of a fine cast.  The stronger performances include Winset,
Thompson, Alan Rickman, and Elizabeth Spriggs, my favorite, as the
lively Mrs. Jennings.  Sure, Ms. Thompson is too old for her part, but
she's a world better than the less-than-divine Hugh Grant.  The stam-
mering actor is too stiff the role of Bachelor Number One and his
presence completely weakens one of the story's core relationships.</P>
<P>     Taiwanese director Ang Lee (EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN) directs from a
screenplay by Thompson (!) that's very amusing.  In fact, the audience
that I saw this with laughed at almost every line, gesture, or action by
the characters.  Perhaps the reason for so much praise is due, in part,
to what this movie *isn't.*  SENSE AND SENSIBILITY is easy to like (and
easy to recommend) because it doesn't contain any blood, bullets,
hookers, strippers, cursing, swearing, superheroes, product plugs, sex,
drugs, rock `n' roll, or other self-destructive behaviors.</P>
