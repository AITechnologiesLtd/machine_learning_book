<PRE>Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001)

<P>"Come on, Silent Bob! We're going to Hollywood."</P>
<P>Starring Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith, Will Ferrell,
Shannon Elizabeth, Seann William Scott, Chris Rock,
Jason Lee, Ben Affleck. Directed by Kevin Smith. Rated
R.</P>
<P>Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is a dumb movie
disguised in a smarmy interior. Kevin Smith, coming
off the wonderful, challenging Dogma, fills it with
sub-Road Trip gross-out jokes and expects us to buy it
because he's just oh-so-ironic. But when a movie is so
self-aware it becomes about nothing but itself, we can
hardly be expected to pay for admission.</P>
<P>Jay and Silent Bob, two New Jersey stoners who hang
out at the doorstep of convenience store selling pot,
have appeared in almost all of Smith's movies but, if
I'm not mistaken, have not starred in one until now.
They find out that there is a movie based on the comic
book that is based on them being made in Hollywood.
This presents two problems: a) they haven't received a
penny in royalties and b) nerds on the internet
("What's the internet?") are talking trash about them.
What is there to do except go to Hollywood and stop
this movie from being made?</P>
<P>On the way -- they're hitchhiking, because who knew
you needed tickets to take a bus? -- they run into a
group of hotties who pretend to be with an
animal-rights group, but are really jewel thiefs who
parade around in Charlie's Angels-style outfits. Of
course, they set Jay and Silent Bob up to look like
the thieves, so that there is a massive manhunt going
on during the second half of the film. Will Ferrell,
who again proves himself incapable of doing anything
but sketch comedy, shows up as the wildlife marshal
inspector who thinks the two have stolen a monkey.</P>
<P>The movie will probably please only Smith's die-hard,
undiscerning fans; everyone else will be critical of
this mind-bogglingly stupid effort following some the
sophisticated cinema that he churned out in years
past. Any appeal the movie has will come from the "in"
jokes, most of which I think I understood, but the
movie is "in" to the point of absurdity. There needs
to be something holding it together other than its own
smugness.</P>
<P>Once Jay and Silent Bob get to Hollywood, the movie
abruptly switches gears from gross-out comedy to
ridiculously broad Hollywood satire. Countless "hot"
movie stars and personalities make an appearance, from
Smith veterans Matt Damon and Ben Affleck to Wes
Craven, but Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back resorts to
such low-brow gags as another Scream sequel with a
monkey as the killer. Get it? They're so desperate for
another movie, they ran out of ideas and used a
monkey! A monkey!</P>
<P>As often happens with writers who are working below
what they are actually capable of, most of the really
good lines are throwaways, while the big, painstaking
gags mostly fall flat. One of the funniest lines in
the movie flies by: when asked to comment on the
clitoris (don't ask), Jay responds: "the female
clitoris?"</P>
<P>Kevin Smith is a talented writer (though I agree that
his films would be better off if he'd let a real
director take the helm), and Jay and Silent Bob Strike
Back holds true to his promise to make a more
facetious film. Unfortunately, it's also shapeless,
pointless and largely unfunny. Smith's "verbal
trampoline," as Ben Affleck once called his
distinctive dialogue, takes a back seat to his dubious
instincts as a populist filmmaker. This was supposed
to be the movie that didn't offend anyone, but it's
offensive because it's terrible. </P>
