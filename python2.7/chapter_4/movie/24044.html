<P>   If you're a teen living in a town that has one road, a
couple of taverns, no movie houses and no tourists or anyone
from the outside communities to stimulate change, what do
you do?  The usual activity seems to be (if you're a girl) to
get pregnant and if you're a guy to put gals in the family way.
After all, leaving for the big city is not an option if you're so
isolated you barely know that urban areas such as Montreal
and Toronto exist--and New York is something somewhere
down there "in the States."  Allan Moyle's quirky movie
scripted by Tricia Fish (who claims that the story is in no way
autobiographical) is about such a dreary town which, despite
its being right on the ocean, is about as scenic as the South
Bronx.  "New Waterford Girl" opened up the Blame Canada!
festival at the Film Society of Lincoln Center and will
presumably play at some art houses later.  Though the movie
is idiosyncratic, it is not done in the style of, say, Justin
Kerrigan's energetic "Human Traffic"--which deals with 20-
somethings grooving on weekends after putting in time on
their stultifying jobs.</P>
<P>   While Hollywood movies made in Canada--particularly in
Vancouver--have often been losers, the Canadians
themselves seem incapable of turning out a bad product. 
"New Waterford Girl" is in no way destined to become the
next "Titanic" but the picture is a cute study of a dysfunctional
family living in the stixiest of stix towns way out in the
Eastern Canadian island of Cape Breton (in the province of
Nova Scotia, I believe). </P>
<P>   Mooney Pottie is the eponymous New Waterford Girl, a 15-
year-old who is moody more than Mooney and one who
bears evidence to the possibility that no matter how isolated
and inbred a location may be, there's always someone who
does not fit in.  In her fairly large family, everyone but
Mooney is happy, or at least so thinks her dad, and he'll be
darned if he's going to allow a strange bird like her to go to
New York where she has just won an all expenses paid
scholarship.  She has to find a way to convince the old man
to let her out of this prison, so she latches on to a regular
tradition.   Whenever a girl is knocked up, she is sent by
train--which looks like the Toonerville Trolley--to the town of
Sydney or thereabouts to spend a few days getting an abortion,
and then to return, her reputation intact.  If she can convince
pop that she has a bun in the oven, he will be the first to put
her on that train--except that she will be stateside bound and
as virginal as the day she was born.</P>
<P>   Moyle gets good performances out of the ensemble and
knows how to employ irony with the young people so that the
boys--and not the girls--are the ones worried about their
reputations.  Injecting a catalyst into the action, Moyle
introduces a hip teen from the Bronx whose dad is
incarcerated, implying that she and her mom (Tara Spencer-
Nairn and Cathy Moriarty) are mafia people on the run.  As
the town teacher, Cecil Sweeney--who is in love with his
gifted but isolated student Moonie--Andrew McCarthy does a
surprising turn as a former brat-packer who has matured into
a sensitive adult; a flawed educator who is goodhearted
enough to encourage the object of his desire flee the coop. 
"New Waterford Girl" is a slow-moving, sensitive coming of
age with considerable irony and humor who is the first to
leave her "Margaret's Museum" town, and the sharp-looking
Tara Spencer-Nairn uses some slightly magical powers to aid
in Mooney's liberation.</P>
