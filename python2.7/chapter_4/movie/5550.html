<P>     Despite having taken three years to make the trip across the 
Atlantic, Andre Techine's MA SAISON PREFEREE is surely one of the best 
films of the summer, if not the year.  After its release in France, MA 
SAISON PREFEREE was unable to acquire an American distributor; however, 
following the modest art-house success of the director's subsequent 
effort, WILD REEDS, the door was opened for the movie's U.S. showing.  
For those who enjoy rich, complex character dramas, the arrival of MA 
SAISON PREFEREE is a cause for celebration.</P>
<P>     MA SAISON PREFEREE is about relationships and communication.  It's 
about sacrifice and misunderstandings.  And, above all, it's about the 
ties of family and how the passage of time constantly distorts and re-
invents our relationships with those we are closest to.  Techine's 
masterful story probes these issues, constantly digging deeper to 
uncover hidden motivations.  In the process, a pair of multi-
dimensional, completely believable personalities are created.  These 
characters get under our skin and stay there.</P>
<P>     MA SAISON PREFEREE features international film icon Catherine 
Deneuve as Emilie and French star Daniel Auteuil (JEAN DE FLORETTE, UN 
COEUR EN HIVER) as her estranged brother, Antoine.  The rift between 
these two has existed for three years, a time during which they haven't 
spoken.  When their mother, Berthe (Marthe Villalonga), suffers a 
stroke, Emilie brings the older woman to her house to live.  Bruno 
(Jean-Pierre Bouvier), Emilie's husband, resents Berthe's presence, and 
is even less pleased when Emilie breaks the silence with Antoine and 
invites him to Christmas dinner.  On that night, with the snow falling 
outside, the tangled skein of Emilie and Antoine's relationship begins 
to untangle, causing Emilie to leave her husband and reach a new 
understanding with her brother.</P>
<P>     When MA SAISON PREFEREE begins, none of the characters are happy 
with themselves, their lives, their relationships, or each other.  As 
time passes, however, and Emilie and Antoine re-discover the closeness 
they once shared, they uncover their lost humanity.  But how deep is 
this new understanding, and what level of sacrifice can it survive?  
Techine goes to great pains to illustrate that there are no easy answers 
to life's most difficult questions, and that no aspect of human 
interaction can avoid change.</P>
<P>     Emilie and Antoine are vastly different, and that contrast forms a 
dynamic that keeps their relationship interesting as it mutates.  Emilie 
is cool, reserved, and distant.  Her husband calls her an emotional 
cripple who's incapable of love.  Antoine is selfish, outgoing, and 
brash.  Deneuve and Auteuil capture the essences of these two perfectly.</P>
<P>     A varied and intriguing group of supporting characters populate 
this film.  The most important is Berthe, whose circumstances and 
actions impel change in Emilie and Antoine's relationship.  We also meet 
Emilie's troublesome adopted son, Lucien (Anthony Prada), and her 
daughter, Anne (Chiara Mastroianni, the real-life offspring of Deneuve 
and actor Marcello Mastroianni), who feels unloved and neglected.  These 
two members of the younger generation have their own stories, pieces of 
which we see when they intersect aspects of Techine's main narrative.</P>
<P>     MA SAISON PREFEREE is the sort of intelligent, sensitive drama that 
we need more of.  It engages the intellect without ignoring the 
emotions.  In the midst of this summer's glut of mind-numbing action 
features, it's a rare and welcome treat to find something this fresh.  
Regardless of the time of the year or the color of the leaves on the 
trees, MA SAISON PREFEREE is definitely worth seeing.</P>
