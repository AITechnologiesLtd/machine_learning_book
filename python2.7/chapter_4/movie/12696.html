<P>We first meet Stéphane [Romain Duris] in the opening moments of "Gadjo
Dilo" walking down an ice-covered road in the Romanian countryside.
The young Parisian is in search of a legendary gypsy singer, whose
tape he carries with him. Her songs had consoled his ethnomusicologist
father on his deathbed, and the tape was recorded on one of his many
field-trips. Stéphane is following in his footsteps.</P>
<P>I can understand the fascination with gypsy music. The authentic sound
is nothing like the kitsch you hear in Hungarian restaurants. It has a
simultaneously raw and ethereal power like no other music. Over
thirty-five years ago I was listening to one of composer and
ethnomusicologist Henry Cowell's radio programs on NYC's left-wing,
listener-sponsored WBAI. He announced that he was going to play some
field-recordings he had made of Romanian gypsy fiddle-players who had
influenced Bela Bartok. The sound mesmerized me. To this day, I search
for recordings of this type of fiddle-playing but nothing could
possibly match Cowell's field-recordings. So I can understand
Stéphane's passion.</P>
<P>Exhausted and half-frozen, Stéphane reaches a tiny village in the dead
of night. All the doors are closed, the lights are out and the streets
are empty. The only person he finds is an elderly drunken gypsy named
Izidor [Isidor Serban], who is cursing loudly at the cops who have
just taken his son Adrjani to jail on trumped-up charges. Stéphane
asks the old man if he knows the location of a hotel, but the gypsy
only wants to share his bottle with the young man, and pour out his
complaints about the Romanian judicial system.</P>
<P>Stéphane listens patiently, shares from the bottle, but still has a
warm bed on his mind. Finally he has an inspiration. He takes out the
tape and plays it for the gypsy. "Do you know who she is? Do you know
where I can find her?" From that moment on, Izidor is drawn to the
young man, who becomes a surrogate son. They go back to the gypsy
village where Izidor gives Stéphane his own bed.</P>
<P>The next morning the villagers are shocked by the presence of a "gadjo
dilo" (crazy outsider) in their midst. They surround Izidor and press
him with questions. How can he guarantee that Stéphane is not there to
steal their chickens, since "gadjos" can never be trusted. The joke,
of course, is that the gypsies project on to the outsider exactly the
same fears that outside society has of them.</P>
<P>Stéphane enjoys gypsy hospitality for several days, but announces to
Izidor that it is time for him to move on. He must track down the
singer of his father's tape. Izidor pressures his surrogate son to
stay for a few days more, and then the days turn into months. As
Stéphane learns to speak their language, they lose their distrust of
him. He takes part in their rituals and travels about the countryside
with them on various adventures, including performances by the skilled
musicians from Izidor's village.</P>
<P>The film was directed by Tony Gatlif, who made the award-winning
documentary "Latcho Drom" in 1993, which depicts gypsy musicians in
performance across the planet, from India to Spain. Gatlif is a gypsy
himself, born in Algeria in 1948. "Latcho Drom" was part two of a
trilogy on gypsy culture, that began with the 1982 feature "Les
Princes." "Gadjo Dilo" is the final installment.</P>
<P>Ultimately Stéphane becomes assimilated totally into gypsy society. He
falls in love with Sabina [Rona Hartner] who initially wards off the
"gadjo." When he proves to her that he has cut his ties with
"outsider" society, she takes him into her tent where they make
passionate love.</P>
<P>In the climax of the film, Izidor's son Adrjani [Florin Moldovan] is
released from jail and there is an joyous celebration in the gypsy
village. The joy is short-lived, as Arjani and two accomplices go to
town and track down the local official who victimized him. They murder
him in a saloon in full view of the townsfolk. This leads to a raid on
the gypsy village and the death of both Izidor and Adrjani.</P>
<P>While the film does not explore the underlying tensions between
Romanians and gypsies, there is little doubt that it is related to the
social disintegration following the fall of Ceaucescu. In a time of
worsening economic conditions, gypsies become a convenient scapegoat
just as they were in the 1930s when fascism was on the rise.</P>
<P>Anti-gypsy racism is on the increase everywhere, including Vaclav
Havel's "enlightened" Czechoslovakia. A gypsy reporter writes:
"Voicing stereotypes common throughout Europe, Czechs claim that Roma,
with their traditionally large families, are a drain on the social
service budget and live better than Czechs with jobs. They regard Roma
as dishonest and often criminal. In a 1996 poll cited in the U.S.
State Department's human rights report, 35 percent of Czechs favored
'concentrating and isolating the Roma' and 45 percent supported
'moving the Roma out of the Czech Republic if possible.'"</P>
<P>As a Marxist, I have always been interested in "exceptions" to normal
bourgeois society. There is no greater exception than the gypsies, who
resist assimilation like no other people. They originated on the west
coast of India in the early middle ages and soon migrated into the
middle east. They arrived in Europe by the fourteenth century, and now
number more than 8 million there. They have always tried to find ways
to avoid the confinements of wage-labor. By the same token, they show
little interest in becoming captains of industry. While racist
mythology paints them as thieves, most are hard-working. Patrin, a web
page devoted to Roma (gypsy) culture and history states:</P>
<P>"For a collective economic effort, Roma may form a purely functional
association, the kumpaniya, whose members do not necessarily belong to
the same clan or even the same dialect group. Individually, many Roma
are peddlers, especially in Europe. Some sell goods they have bought
cheaply. Others sell what they make themselves, although in the
twentieth century a number of Romani crafts have suffered from
competition with mass-produced articles. </P>
<P>"There are certain staple Romani occupations, such as horse trading,
metalworking, dealing in scrap metal, and vegetable or fruit picking
in some countries. In gaining a livelihood, the women play their full
part. It is they who often sell their wares from door to door and who
do the fortune telling. Among the Vlad-speaking Roma in the United
States, this latter profession, known as 'reading and advising,' is
still widespread."</P>
<P>Bourgeois society has always had great difficulties with peoples who
remain economically and culturally distinct. Like the gypsy, the Jews
have historically been outsiders. During the nineteenth century,
Eastern European Jewry existed on the fringes of bourgeois society as
pawnbrokers, tax-collectors, saloon-keepers, etc. Christian society
encountered them not only as an undifferentiated economic bloc, they
also saw them as an alien presence, with their Yiddish language, their
strange garb and religious beliefs. During times of relative economic
stability, the Jew and gypsy was tolerated. During times of duress,
they became scapegoats. And during the time of complete economic
collapse in post-WWI Europe, they functioned as the ultimate
scapegoats and were exterminated.</P>
<P>Today the Jews have become assimilated into bourgeois society. In the
United States, they are virtually indistinguishable from other
Americans. The gypsy, like the American Indian, remains unassimilated.
There are pressures on both peoples to meld with the outside world.
Like the American Indian, the gypsies face continuing cultural and
economic genocide. As is the case for American Indians, one of the big
worries for gypsy society is the disappearance of their language.</P>
<P>Tony Gatlif's "Gadjo Dilo" can be seen as part of the larger effort to
preserve gypsy culture and society. Ironically, it is Stéphane the
"outsider" who is assimilated into their culture and not the other way
round. It is not too hard to identify with him as he discovers the
joys of everyday gypsy life. There is a closeness and honesty that is
obviously missing from the colorless and competitive world of
bourgeois society. As our own society becomes more alienated and
hate-filled--to the extent that fourteen year olds bring automatic
weapons to school for the purpose of mass murder--, we will inevitably
begin to think about alternatives to our own materialist values.</P>
<P>At this point many people will be tempted to find a way to assimilate
into "outsider" societies, like Stéphane did into the gypsies. In many
ways, this was what the 1960s counter-culture was all about.
Unfortunately, these solutions can only exist for individuals, and not
for greater society which revolves around the cash nexus. The crying
need is for some sort of economic system that can make the freedom and
solidarity of the gypsy village depicted in "Gadjo Dilo" universal.</P>
<P>("Gadjo Dilo" is scheduled for theatrical release on July 10, 1998)</P>
