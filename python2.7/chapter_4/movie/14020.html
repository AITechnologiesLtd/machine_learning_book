THE GODFATHER
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1998</PRE>
<P>Many years ago, when the author of this review had to rely
only on cinemas and television as the source of cinematic
knowledge, he was intrigued by the word "godfather",
featured in many movies and television shows as the synonym
for organised crime. The use of the word didn't stop there -
many movies were branded "godfathers" by their distributors,
in order to bring the audience hungry for intelligent and
spectacular drama about gangster organisations. Fascination
with the word and the movie who inspired their use grew with
years. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to see the first movie
before being exposed to the second. Nevertheless, the first
seeing of THE GODFATHER was memorable experience indeed -
years of waiting actually paid off in a three hours of
cinematic feast.</P>
<P>In many ways, THE GODFATHER follows the same pattern of many
cinematic classics who used to be made in a time periods or
circumstances that aren't here anymore. It was made in a era
when the Old Hollywood collapsed, and the new rules hadn't
been established. The studios were willing to experiment and
to give the movie authors free reign over their projects.
One of such authors was Francis Ford Coppola, who made one
of the most intimate, yet most universally appealing movies
of all times; the movie which earned its cult status by
satisfying both the high standards of snobbish critics and
the simple needs general audience. The greatness of the
movie can't be seen only in a success that followed him in a
last quarter of century; it could be even more tangible in a
series of references, imitations and hidden remakes created
by Coppola's colleagues through the years.</P>
<P>Almost every scene in a movie is memorable, but for many
most effective is a beginning - in a dark room, Bonasera
(Salvatore Corsitto), Italian undertaker, tells that he
believes in America and its values; but only minutes later
his speech gives another spin on the beliefs in life,
liberty and pursuit of happiness - they shatter confronted
with the humiliating and unpunished rape of his daughter. In
order to see justice done, Bonasera is forced to ask favour
from his godfather, powerful Mafia figure Don Vito Corleone
(Marlon Brando), using the marriage of Don Vito's daughter
Connie (Talia Shire) as an opportunity to win over the
mobster's heart. That same wedding is a nice opportunity to
meet Don Vito's sons, family and friends. Don Vito has three
sons - Sonny (James Caan), whose macho temperament is nicely
combined with the calm wisdom of his adopted brother and
family advisor Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall); hedonistic Fredo
(John Cazale); and, finally, college educated Michael (Al
Pacino) whose disgust with the violence and crime forced him
to leave the family and come to the wedding as a decorated
WW2 hero. However, Michael's reluctance to engage in the
family business gets tested soon after the wedding. Angered
by Don Vito's refusal to engage in narcotic operations,
other Mafia families from New York organise the attempt on
his life; simply by trying to protect his father, Michael
gets drawn in the war and slowly becomes the rising member
of his crime organisation.</P>
<P>Since both the real-world Mafia and numerous Italian
American organisation actually tried to stop this movie from
being made or distributed, it is quite ironic to see THE
GODFATHER as a source not of numerous movie cliches that
actually portray the Mafia as a social element more benign
than in real life (mobsters as devout family men; violence
exists only between its members and doesn't affect general
and innocent population; opposition to drugs etc.). It is
even more surprising to see THE GODFATHER not only as an
inspiration to other, less original, filmmakers, but also to
the real-world gangsters who tried to imitate the appearance
of his main characters. However, although the movie might
seem a little bit apologetic towards Mafia, and definitely
has insiders' point of view, it still has the flavour of
authenticity, necessary for the viewer to have a critical
relations towards the characters and their morally
questionable actions.</P>
<P>The authenticity of the movie isn't just in some references
towards real-life mobsters and mob-related stories and urban
legends. Coppola worked very hard to capture the way of life
in his native Italian American community, and also invested
a lot of effort in order to have his epic story, that takes
place in late 1940s and early 1950s, firmly set in that time
period through production design, costumes, hairstyles and
soundtrack that is well balanced with the original music of
Nino Rota, that also became one of the identifying symbols
of the movie.</P>
<P>The most memorable element of the movie are its actors.
Marlon Brando, almost washed-up in the time when he made THE
GODFATHER, gave the performance of his life by playing Vito
Corleone - his role was so grand that the actor himself
parodied it in THE FRESHMAN. Although obviously shadowed by
Brando, the other actors were also impressive. Among them,
Al Pacino, who had to work hardest by portraying slow
transformation of lead character, shines most brightly and
his role of Michael shone the path to his future as one of
the best serious movie actors in contemporary American
cinema. The calmness of Pacino's character, calmness that
crumbles under emotions only in brief moments of family
crisis, is so in contrast with the emotional outbursts that
would be Pacino's trademark in a years to come.</P>
<P>The other actors might not be in Brando's or Pacino's
league, but they benefited from Coppola's good casting and
also gave the roles of their life simply by being in this
movie, so well-written and directed. The only exception to
this is James Caan, who works well with the role given to
him, but whose all-American appearance seems a rather out of
place with the more or less ethnically pure Italian American
cast. Despite that shortcoming (one and perhaps the only in
the entire GODFATHER), the cast is really more than
impressive, although many actors and actresses later didn't
live to the potential indicated by their performance in this
movie.</P>
<P>Those who like analysing movies to death would probably ask
why THE GODFATHER kept its cult status through the quarter
of century. There were many well-made, well-directed and
well-acted movies produced in the years before and after,
but it seems that only THE GODFATHER stood the test of time
and kept the imagination of the future moviegoers. The
reason might probably be in the universal subject of the
movie; although it shows rather obscure and ethnically
isolated phenomenon the messages of THE GODFATHER can be
translated on all the worlds languages and applied to other
systems in different times and places. The movie portrays
both the society and individuals who lost their freedom
because they were too insecure or unprepared for
responsibility; same as the poor Italian immigrants had to
rely on Mafia to overcome the difficulties of New World
(like Bonasera in the opening sequence), Michael is forced
to join the family because he, despite all his efforts,
can't live in a insecure world outside his father's
omnipotent shadow. And even when he actually becomes his
father (in a brilliant and most memorable last shot), the
freedom is lost - omnipotence and freedom are just illusion,
because with the power comes both the responsibility and the
never ending task of keeping. The story of this movie could
have taken place everywhere in the world, and that explains
why the people will associate with its characters for many
decades to come.</P>
