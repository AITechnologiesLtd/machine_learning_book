<P>When the scandal over Bill Clinton's sexual desk-capades exploded, we
watched the President of the United States squirm before his inquisitors
like a 12-year-old boy whose mother caught him with a copy of Hustler.
As Clinton dodged questions, played word games and lied outright, many
of us wondered, "Why in the world is he subjecting himself to this? Why
doesn't he simply tell them his sex life is none of their business and
refuse to answer any questions about his private goings-on?"</P>
<P>According to "The Contender," the approach wouldn't work because once
the political wolf pack realized that their quarry was adamant about not
commenting on personal questions, they could freely lob even more lurid
accusations, secure in the knowledge that no assertion, however
outrageous, would be refuted.</P>
<P>Depressing, isn't it? Politics is a nasty business and "The Contender"
wallows in the muck. Masquerading as a high-minded ethical drama, the
movie is just another trashy melodrama, with a slew of respected actors
chewing scenery.</P>
<P>Written and directed by Rod Lurie ("Deterrence"), the story begins a few
weeks after the unexpected death of the vice-president. A replacement
must be appointed and Virginia Governor Jack Hathaway (William Petersen)
looks like a shoo-in for the position. Already a popular figure, his
stature rises quickly when, while being interviewed by a reporter during
a fishing excursion, a car plummets off a bridge and the governor
immediately dives into the icy water to attempt a rescue.</P>
<P>But President Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges) has other ideas. Determined
to stake out his place in the history books, Evans announces that a
woman, Ohio Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen), is his choice for the
job. The decision enrages a number of imposing figures, including House
Judiciary Committee Chairman Sheldon Runyon (Gary Oldman) of Illinois.</P>
<P>Heading the confirmation hearings, Runyon pulls out all the stops in his
quest to discredit Hanson. In short order, the soft-spoken nominee is
confronted with allegations that, while in college, she participated in
a gang-bang with a group of frat boys. Instead of doing the Clinton
squirm, Hanson declares that her sexuality is nobody's business,
refusing to "dignify this line of questioning with any comments." Even
when presented with photographic evidence, she remains mute, firm in her
conviction that a line must be drawn between public life and personal
matters.</P>
<P>So the political maneuvering escalates, with Runyon and his minions
leveling even uglier charges while the president and his staff
frantically work on damage control. How will this drama play out?</P>
<P>With lots of speechifying and a juicy contrived ending, of course.</P>
<P>"The Contender" does a number of things right. The film identifies the
party affiliations of its characters (a rarity in this type of fiction)
and makes direct references to real politicians and events. The verbose
storyline maintains a sense of tension all the way to the grand, goofy,
finale. Jeff Bridges creates a believable president, coming off like a
hunky Lyndon Johnson (although a running joke about his delight in being
able to order any food item at any hour wears thin about the fifth time
around). And Gary Oldman is enjoyable as Runyon, a nasty, paranoid,
hypocritical power broker reminiscent of Representative Dan Burton, the
infamous Indiana pit bull who chased cars all the way to Washington, DC.
Oldman has a field day with the role, spitting out melodramatic lines
like "We're both sticking to our guns, only mine are loaded" with
relish.</P>
<P>While the production suffers from one-note supporting characters,
chintzy sets and claustrophobic camera work, the film's biggest
liability is Laine Hanson. The Republican-turned-Democrat Senator, who
voted to impeach President Clinton, is a pro-gun control, pro-choice,
anti-death penalty vegetarian atheist who publicly described the Bible
as a "fairy tale." She apparently was elected on some parallel Earth,
because she certainly would not have won in the Ohio of this planet.
Joan Allen basically reprises her role in "The Crucible" here, playing
the potential vice-president as a "Goodie" Hanson of prim
self-containment. This character should face reporters and declare,
"Unless this country wants to scare off any competent persons, we must
stop putting politicians' private lives under a microscope. It may cost
me the vice-presidency, but I'm standing up for what I believe!"
Instead, she merely reiterates her refusal to discuss personal matters,
offering herself as a maddeningly passive martyr.</P>
<P>Luckily for her, the president and his bad boys are more than willing to
get down and dirty on her behalf. The moral of the story appears to be
that idealism and nobility can succeed in the world of politics, as long
as lies, threats and dirty tricks support those qualities. In terms of
disposable entertainment, "The Contender" is marginally acceptable junk
food. As an intellectual exercise, however, it left me with an upset
stomach.</P>
