<PRE>TWIN DRAGONS (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Edited by Steve Kong
Copyright 1999 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>A review of a Jackie Chan film is something that no one really reads.  Chan
films are films in which you go, you sit, you enjoy the action, and you
leave.  There's no real story, acting, or character building.  Chan films
are all about the wow-effect of the action.  And Twin Dragons has a lot of
that wow-effect.</P>
<P>The story for Twin Dragons is pretty thin.  A pair of twins separated at
birth are finally reunited by accident.  One twin, named Boomer (Jackie
Chan), is a tough guy and the other, named John Ma (Jackie Chan), is a
brilliant musician/composer.  When John comes to Hong Kong to conduct one
of his pieces, he bumps into Boomer by accident.  What ensues is a whole
lot of ridiculous plot, but that's not a big deal since Chan films are
about the action and not the paper thin plots.</P>
<P>The action in Twin Dragons is non-stop.  From the very start to the very
last seconds Twin Dragons is packed with action.  All of it amazing and all
of it hilarious.  Chan's action is what makes him stand out from other
action movie stars - there is a sense of humour that accompanies his
action.  This humour along with Chan's natural onscreen charisma makes him
the most likeable action star in the world.  The only complaint I have with
the action here is that there are some sequences where the use of handguns
is too prevalent.  In Chan films the fans go to see Chan's incredible
dexterity and quick fists-of-fury in the fight sequences, not a John Woo
double-fisted pistol gunfight -- this is a small complaint though.  While
on the subject of John Woo who as a child aspired to become a priest, look
for Woo's cameo late in Twin Dragons as the priest performing a marriage.</P>
<P>As always, my reviews of Chan films are quite short, either you have
already gone to see them on your own accord or you just don't have the
motivation to go.  So, my reviews are always the motivator for those of you
in the second category to go see the latest Chan film.  Don't Miss Jackie
Chan's Twin Dragons.  It's more action and comedy than his last film Rush
Hour.  One thing to mention is that sadly missing from the end of Twin
Dragons is the familiar bloopers real.</P>
