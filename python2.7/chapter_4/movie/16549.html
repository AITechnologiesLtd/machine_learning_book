<PRE>
 A Bug's Life (1998) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Featuring voices of Dave Foley,
Kevin Spacey and David Hyde Pierce.</PRE>
<P> Seeing A Bug's Life, to paraphrase the great Yogi Berra, won't be déjà vu
all over again.</P>
<P> Sure, like Antz, it's a computer-animated feature about bugs. But that is
where the similarity ends.</P>
<P> For while Antz was a story about striving to be an individual in a society
built on conformity, A Bug's Life is a story about learning self-reliance,
self-confidence and self-worth.</P>
<P> This production from Pixar, the same people who brought you the enjoyable
Toy Story, is a '90s adaptation of the old Aesop fable about the
grasshopper and the ants.</P>
<P> In this case, the grasshopper isn't lazy, he's a big, mean bully who heads
a gang of good-for-nothing hoppers who force a colony of ants to work all
summer to gather food for them.</P>
<P> Eventually one ant, a dreamer named Flik, rebels, and hits upon the idea
of getting bigger bugs to protect the colony from the snarly grasshoppers.
Of course Flik, who is also somewhat of a bungler, hires a company of
circus bugs whom he mistakes for warrior bugs.</P>
<P> However, everything works out fine. Flik redeems himself, the ants learn
self-respect, the circus bugs learn self-worth and the grasshoppers get
their just desserts.</P>
<P> Whereas Antz offered so many easily recognizable voices - Sylvester
Stallone, Gene Hackman, Danny Glover and, principally, Woody Allen - A
Bug's Life works as more of an ensemble piece. As good and as witty as Antz
was, at times it felt like an animated Woody Allen movie.</P>
<P> No such problem with A Bug's Life. Featuring the vocal talents of, among
others,  Dave Foley (TV's NewsRadio), Oscar-winner Kevin Spacey, Frasier's
David Hyde Pierce and, most charmingly, original Lost in Space icon
Jonathan Harris, the audience is freer to concentrate more on the story
than play the "who's voice is that?" guessing game.</P>
<P> The computer-generated animation is superb, bringing the bugs' world to
life. The colors are vivid, the characters are distinctive.</P>
<P> Adding to the pleasure is a wonderful Randy Newman score, one of this
solid composer's best.</P>
<P> A Bug's Life is witty, warm and charming - perfect holiday fare for the
entire family. Just because you've seen Antz, don't pass up A Bug's Life.
After seeing it, you may decide insects aren't so ikky after all.</P>
