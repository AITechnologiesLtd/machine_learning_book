<PRE>SLIDING DOORS (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Edited by Cher Johnson

<P>Sliding Doors is an interesting film in one respect: It uses a gimmick to
explore what we all wonder about each and everyday.
What is our fate, and how coincidence can change fate? There is one movie
that I love that tackles these two issues, Red. Now, there is another,
Sliding Doors. In Sliding Doors though we actually get to see what happens
if something happens and if that something doesn't happen.</P>
<P>Helen (Gwyneth Paltrow) is an advertising executive in London. One morning
she is fired for no good reason. Feeling down, she goes to take the subway
home. Here's where the movie branches into the two story lines. In story
line "A" Helen is able to barely catch the train, comes home to find her
scummy boyfriend in bed with his mistress, and runs off finding consolation
with her best female friend. In story line "B" Helen misses the train, gets
mugged, and comes home barely missing her scummy boyfriend's mistress. </P>
<P>In story line A Helen meets a wonderful man, James (John Hannah), starts a
new business, and is almost able to start a new life. In story line B we
get to see Helen bumble around with her tongue-tied excuse-riddled
boyfriend. Sliding Doors alternates between the two story lines and it was
somewhat of a workout trying to keep track of which story line I was
watching. Thank goodness director/writer Peter Howitt changes Paltrow's
hairstyle after the split of the story lines.</P>
<P>Deep inside I liked Sliding Doors, but only half of it. I liked the story
with Helen and James. John Hannah's James is just a likeable fellow. From
the get-go James charms the audience. The story line (A) is a happy
romantic comedy - Hannah's character providing much of the comedy.</P>
<P>The second story (B) is not as well written and I really didn't much care
for it. Helen's boyfriend Gerry (John Lynch) stumbles around trying to keep
up two relationships. The weak link here is Jeanne Tripplehorn, as Gerry's
mistress, who is painful to watch on screen. Atleast John Lynch has his
stumbling around to fall upon - and when he doesn't have that, we have
Gerry's best friend to entertain us. But, next to that, story line B is a
loser story line. It is nothing but the fluff needed to hold up the gimmick
that is the staple of this film.
I'd much rather Howitt drop story line B altogether and flesh out story
line A, where Howitt puts in contrived "tension" with James' "other woman."</P>
<P>As for performances, Paltrow handles the double duty very well. I enjoyed
her performance very much. She is radiant on screen and it's nice to see
her again - the last film I saw of hers was Great Expectations in which she
also gives a good performance. I look forward to see her more on screen,
her next film will be the Andrew Davis film A Perfect Murder with Michael
Douglas and Viggo Mortensen. The other lead performer in Sliding Doors,
John Hannah, steals every scene he's in. The other two major performers,
Lynch and Tripplehorn, don't fair so well.</P>
<P>Worth mentioning is Douglas McFerran as Gerry's best friend Russell.
McFerran is given all the comedic lines in the film and his performance is
one to look for.</P>
<P>Sliding Doors tries to explore the "what if" situations that come from
Paltrow's character catching and missing a train. This exploration into
fate and coincidence is used to hold up the gimmick that tries to sell the
film. The only problem is that one story line is really interesting and the
other is not. And having to try to keep track of both story lines just to
see how they end up in the same place is a lot of work. I'm not sure if was
worth the work just to see how one story line turned out, much more than to
see how the two story lines meet up. Red is a better film exploring the
issues of fate and coincidence.</P>
<P>Had Sliding Doors been a film just about the relationship between Helen and
James (story line A) I would have given this film a Don't Miss nod. As it
stands, as a film reliant on a gimmick that doesn't work too well, I give
it a good hearty recommendation.</P>
