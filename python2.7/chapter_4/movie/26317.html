GETTING EVEN WITH DAD
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>For many critics Macaulay Culkin symbolised everything that
was bad about early 1990s Hollywood. Following the smashing
success of HOME ALONE, Culkin became the most bankable child
star of those times with most of his later films repeating
the same formula over and over again. Since those usually
films relied on Culkin's pretty face and annoying brat
routine at the expense of everything else, young actor was
not particularly popular among critics, at least those
unwilling to bow to the standards of the lowest common
denominator or accept misanthropic comedies as family
entertainment. They probably greeted Culkin's puberty with a
sigh of relief - with his voice mutating, Culkin simply
couldn't deliver the goods anymore and his movie star career
came to a halt. GETTING EVEN WITH DAD, 1994 comedy by Howard
Deutsch, is one of his last films.</P>
<P>In this film Culkin plays Timmy Gleason, young boy whose
mother has passed away while father Ray (played by Ted
Danson), professional thief, spent most of the time in
prison. Ray is now out of prison and together with his two
accomplices - Bobby (played by Saul Rubinek) and Carl
(played by Gailard Sartain) - prepares great coin heist.
Timmy, however, shows up in the middle of planning and since
he is bright kid, he doesn't need much time to figure out
why Ray ignores his presence. So, in order to finally
attract father's attention, Timmy hides the stolen coins and
demands that Ray spend some time with him before turning
them over. When father and son finally get together, they
are followed by Ray's partners and police.</P>
<P>The script by Jim Jennewein and Tom S. Parker, based on
already bizarre premise, is overcrowded with sentimental
cliches (delinquent man sees the errors of his ways after
being paired with infant against his will) and some
obligatory but nevertheless implausible subplots (romantic
liaison between ex con and female detective, played by
Glenne Headley). This script provides few humorous scenes,
and character actors are doing fine work, whether they have
more complex job like Ted Danson, or play caricatures like
Rubinek and Sartain. However, good production values and
acting talent alone can't save GETTING EVEN WITH DAD to from
sliding in the oblivion reserved for Hollywood mediocrity.</P>
