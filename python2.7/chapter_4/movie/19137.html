<P>     SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER & UNCUT is crude and profane.  It's
more-than-occasionally offensive.  It's naughty just to see how much
naughtiness you can get away with.  It's repetitious in its dependence on 
obscenity from the mouths of babes.  In short, it's everything critics of
the Comedy Central series "South Park" have accused it of being for three
years, with the added benefit of including several hundred choice R-rated
profanities.  This is about as vile and inexcusable as comedy film-making
gets, a distillation of everything people fear popular culture is doing to
our sensibilities, and I laughed so hard I thought I'd harm an internal
organ.</P>
<P>     There's no question that "South Park" is for a very specific taste,
or lack thereof.  Even those who had been embracing the series now seem to
have tired of Trey Parker and Matt Stone's crass market approach to
grabbing laughs, as evidenced by the show's plummeting ratings.  BIGGER,
LONGER & UNCUT's missed jokes and sniggering immaturity probably wouldn't
surprise even the staunchest "South Park" fan; its sporadic brilliance may
surprise everyone.  The premise is a reflexive commentary on "harmful"
film-making, with the show's four young pals -- Eric Cartman (Parker),
Stan Marsh (Parker), Kyle Broflovski (Stone) and Kenny McCormick (Stone)
-- learning some interesting words from an R-rated feature film starring
scatalogical cartoon stars Terrance & Phillip.  The children's profane
outbursts cause a parental panic in which Terrance & Phillip's home nation
of Canada is held accountable for many societal ills.  War with our
neighbor to the north ensues, as well does a preparation for the
Apocalypse by Satan and his new lover Saddam Hussein.</P>
<P>     The broad pot-shots at censorship and moralistic hysteria aren't
surprising coming from Parker and Stone, who have been heralded as
harbingers of the Apocalypse themselves.  They get in a few swipes at the
MPAA (which branded Parker's ORGAZMO with an NC-17), taking particular aim
at the greater concern with vulgarity than with violence.  Also in their
crosshairs are nationalistic fervor, happy-talk psychology, Internet
pornography and media sensationalism, all compared to the relatively
mundane sin of potty-mouthing.  The target may be easy and some of the
jokes obvious, but Parker and Stone keep the chuckles coming at the
expense of those who would condemn them.</P>
<P>     As it turns out, the film is far less effective as social satire than
it is at pop culture parody.  You see, BIGGER, LONGER & UNCUT is a
musical, with many of the numbers by Parker and composer Marc Shaiman 
patterned after the recent Disney formula.  There's a scene-setting
introductory number ("Mountain Town"), a song for the heroes' dilemma
("What Would Brian Boitano Do?"), a song for the villains ("Blame
Canada"), and a show-stopping production number ("It's Easy, Mmmkay").
Parker and Stone then switch gears to target LES MISERABLES, as the
children's "La Resistance" movement opposing their parents' proposed
execution of Terrance & Phillip generates numbers keyed to "One Day More"
and "A Little Fall of Rain."  The fifteen songs provide the film's most
riotous moments, including Terrance & Phillip's explosively obscene ode to
molestation and Satan's tender ballad about his quest for happiness.  You
may never feel guiltier about laughing harder.</P>
<P>     A style like Parker and Stone's, similar to scattershot predecessors
like Mel Brooks and the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team, is bound to produce
its share of duds like the go-nowhere jabs at a perpetually horny Saddam
Hussein.  Many viewers will just be turned off by the use of homosexuality
or military racism as punch lines, or even the whole idea of 
easily-influenced kids in today's charged post-Columbine High climate.  
SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER & UNCUT isn't going to make anyone prouder to
be an American, or any less convinced that movies are all about shock
value. It's not even going to earn points for preaching to the choir about
letting parents do the job of parenting.  It may do nothing more than
leave you choking back the laughs for fear of acknowledging the power of
your inner 12-year-old.</P>
