<PRE>Review By: Geoff Berkshire</PRE>
<PRE>Star Rating: **1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Susan Sarandon, one of Hollywood's most respected actresses, and Julia Roberts,
one of Hollywood's most successful actresses, team up for the Christmas 1998
release Stepmom.  They play, as the trailers put it, "two women who share one
family."  Unfortunately, the interesting combination is wasted by dropping all
opportunities for originality in favor of run-of-the-mill melodrama.</P>
<P>Sarandon is Jackie, a former editor for Random House, who has been divorced
from Luke (Ed Harris) for several years now.  They share custody of their
children: the very mature, 12 year old, Anna (Jena Malone) and magic fanatic
Ben (Liam Aiken).  Complicating matters is Luke's live-in girlfriend, Isabel
(Roberts).</P>
<P>At the outset, Stepmom appears to be about the conflict that will develop
between these two women and how it effects Luke and the children as they are
pulled into it.  This would give the film a very good possibility to explore an
issue that is widespread in life today but frequently ignored by Hollywood
films.  It would also seem to offer a nice alternative to a film like The
Parent Trap (1998) by showing how divorce can happen and everyone in the family
can still be happy.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, Stepmom has a whole other agenda.  By the end, the film turns
into a routine and melodramatic tearjerker.  It is revealed that Jackie has
cancer and this comes off as an easy out for the problems presented (and a
blatant attempt to make the audience cry).  In its last third the film invites
comparisons to One True Thing (1998) but pales next to that more mature
picture.</P>
<P>While the story falters, the acting helps to save Stepmom from becoming a
complete disaster.  Sarandon doesn't exactly deliver one of her finest
performances but she is more than adequate.  While her character is hard to
warm up to at first (she has a great house, the potential for a great job, she
sees her kids all the time and her only "problem" is that her ex-husband has
fallen in love again...), the disease is revealed after the first half hour. 
While this weakens the story it gives Sarandon more to play with and she dives
right into it.  Her performance overall is a bit of a disappointment
considering who she is and how much she did with so little in Twilight (1998),
earlier in the year.</P>
<P>Roberts, on the other hand, is quite a revelation.  This is certainly her
finest performance since her starmaking turn in Pretty Woman (1990).  Her
dialogue delivery in certain scenes is priceless (a key example being an
exchange between Isabel and Anna after school one day).  This is helped, no
doubt, by some of that dialogue having been written specifically for her by her
favorite screenwriter, Ron Bass.  (Bass is one of five credited screenwriters,
the others being Gigi Levangie, who also gets story credit, and the team of
Jessie Nelson, Steven Rogers and Karen Leigh Hopkins.)  She also holds her own
up against the formidable Sarandon, does a great job with the kids and builds a
believable romantic chemistry with Harris.  I found myself wishing her
character was transported into a better story.</P>
<P>Harris has limited screen time but is a welcome presence.  As the children,
Malone and Aiken are each used in a different way.  Malone (who made her mark
in the shattering child abuse drama Bastard Out of Carolina) is a powerful
little actress and she has a tendency to sometimes overdo some of the emotional
scenes.  This isn't entirely inappropriate though considering the age of the
character she is playing.  On the other hand, Aiken is an adorable child actor
with an infectious giggle and irresistible face.  It's nice to note that he
isn't simply used for "cuteness value" and is actually given quite a bit to do
in the course of the film.  The always reliable Lynn Whitfield also turns up in
a small role as Jackie's doctor.</P>
<P>Chris Columbus (whose previous directing credits include Adventures In
Babysitting, Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire) remains a minor director who relies
a bit too heavily on false manipulation.</P>
<P>There's a John Williams score that is characteristically intrusive but
surprisingly unmemorable.  However, the music supervision is quite good with a
nice mix of classic and modern tunes.  Most prominently featured is the classic
Motown song "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" performed by Marvin Gaye & Tammi
Terrell.  The song is featured in not one, but two, sing-a-long sessions with
the kids and one of the women.  The second comes shortly after Jackie announces
she has cancer.</P>
<P>Stepmom is designed to reduce audiences to tears but takes the easy way out by
relying on cliches and manufactured situations.  Both the characters and the
audience become victims of a bad script.</P>
