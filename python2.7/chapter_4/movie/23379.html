<P>"It's a puzzlement" as the King of Siam would tell Anna. And some 
movies can be bigger puzzlements  than others. More films than one 
suspects need a second viewing, so that the past, seen again and 
recollected in tranquility, might result  in a really valid opinion. 
Ideally that viewing should come days or weeks or months later, but 
of course this comes too late for the first, hot-off-the-press 
review. That's where retrospective judgments come in.</P>
<P>The great majority of viewers have given "Wonder Boys" a warm 
welcome. I add my voice to theirs, but it cannot be as categorical as 
most. My margin of error is larger than usually.</P>
<P>The movie has interesting makers. Director Curtis Hanson has made 
some ten pictures (since 1972)  including "Bad Influence" and "The 
Hand That Rocks the Cradle" before vaulting to fame for his  1997 
"L.A. Confidential." Writer Steven Kloves had scripted three : 
"Racing with the Moon" (1984),  "The Fabulous Baker Boys" (1989)  -- 
both very good -- and "Flesh and Bone" (1993) which I don't know. 
Neither Hanson nor Kloves seems to be in a hurry. "Nice," as Onslow 
might say in "Keeping Up Appearance."</P>
<P>The cinematographer, the production designer, the editor ( the 
legendary Dede Allen, resurfacing after many years) are among the 
best.</P>
<P>The actors are notable and cast with originality. Michael Douglas, 
the male lead, has never been simpatico. Clark Gable always was, 
Harrison Ford always is, but Douglas has a kind of ego-centered face 
that's an asset in some roles but not in others.</P>
<P>Tobey Maguire, now 25, is a major wunderkind of the last decade. So 
is  Katie Holmes, now 22, the revelation of "The Ice Storm" (which 
also starred Maguire) who went on to TVs  "Dawson's Creek,"  the 
appealing, offbeat "Go" and the fiasco "Teaching Mrs. Tingle. "</P>
<P>Talented in idiosyncratic ways is Frances McDormand , known as the 
winner of the Best Actress Oscar in "Fargo" but not for many other, 
remarkable appearances. In "Hidden Agenda" for instance.</P>
<P>What first struck me about "Wonder Boys" is that it has no pretty men 
and women,  except for Katie Holmes (but who knows what she'll look 
like in fifteen years?) And what struck me as the movie progressed 
was that Michael Douglas, in a non-simpatico role, paradoxically has 
our sympathy, if you follow my drift.</P>
<P>The plot rather convoluted. I have not read the source book but 
reliable persons tell me that the script follows it well and does not 
betray it.</P>
<P>At the tall tale's center is fifty-something Professor Grady Tripp, 
played by 56-ish Douglas. He teaches creative writing at a college 
in Pittsburgh, where the picture was shot, using many Carnegie-Mellon 
sites.  Some eight years ago Tripp had huge success with his first 
novel. Since then he's been working on his next one. Seized by 
post-mid-life crisis, plus the fear that comes with  the pressure of 
following a tough act (his own book), unable to make decisions, Grady 
Tripp keeps writing a mammoth, single-spaced manuscript, He is on 
page 2611.</P>
<P>Adding to his state of mind is an overkill of other factors : his 
third wife just left him; his lover of five years, Sara Gaskell 
(McDormand) who is the Chancellor of the school, tells him she is 
pregnant by him. Her husband Walter Gaskell  ( Richard Thomas) is the 
ingratiating head of the English Department hence Tripp's boss. 
Unkempt Grady is a kind of outdated hippie who is partial to pot, 
wears rumpled, probaly smelly clothes, has dishevelled hair and 
sometimes looks like something the cat dragged in.</P>
<P>The events take place over the long weekend of "Wordfest," the 
school's annual literary shindig that brings to campus writers, 
agents, publishers, some of them weird, as are certain other 
attendees.  "Wordfest" 's host is Walter Gaskell. For a reception in 
the Gaskell house, he has purchased Lafitte-Rotschild wine, 
improbably so, since it is so pricey that only a few football coaches 
might afford it. That's just part of the film's improbabilities, 
which can be simultaneously part of its appeal-- the story being a 
kind of semi-affectionate blackish comedy.</P>
<P>Its alternate title might have been "Campus Confidential" an expose 
of Academe's private face which seems to be an insider's report but 
in fact is not. Yes, campuses are not exempted from what the Romans 
used to call "hankium-pankium." Yes, strange people (professors, 
students, staff and others) do strange things. Yes, many 
campus-dwellers can be caricatured. But it seldom happens that 
matters are as pronounced, even blatant, as in the movie. Its 
authenticity is often questionable.</P>
<P>Among the facts and/or developments are: Sara's pregnancy 
(decisions, decisions); cute, intelligent, promising writer Hannah, 
one of Grady's students, rents a room at his house (the third Mrs. 
Tripp, never seen, has her own house in the burbs) and would love to 
start something with Grady, who could be her grandfather and wisely 
takes no action. (The crush is flattering to the quinquagenerian but 
hormonally unlikely). There is the  aside of a  black dude whose car 
he claims Grady has taken. (It's there for farcical absurdism though 
at the end this gets worked into the story).</P>
<P>What rules the set-up is the person of James Leer (Tobey Maguire), 
another brilliant writer from Grady's class. Wonderboy James gets 
somehow involved (don't ask) in the big reception, where a new and 
very odd relationship is created between him an the other "wonderboy" 
(at 50-plus?) Grady. Peculiar developments follow. Among them James's 
shooting dead (with what he had claimed was a toy pistol) Professor 
Walter Gaskell's blind dog which hates and attacks Grady --who will 
limp for th rest of the picture; the theft of a valuable Gaskell 
memento, a jacket worn by Marilyn Monroe at her wedding with Joe 
DiMaggio; the improbable carrying around the dead hound, for days, 
inside the trunk of Grady's car.</P>
<P>More complications that raise eyebrows.  Grady's editor, the creepy 
Terry Crabtree (Robert Downey Jr.) now on the professional skids, 
comes to the colloquium with a towering transvestite played by 
Michael Cavadias of the rock group Bullett. Terry is taken with James 
(with whom he eventually sleeps) while counting on James's and 
Grady's books-to-be to save  his career. (I wonder how Downey, in 
jail off and  mostly on  since 1996, has managed to be in about 10 
films since 1997!!!)</P>
<P>James is undeniably a huge talent, we are told, though we never have 
any real proofs of it. James, a sophomore I think is  morose, 
near-catatonic,  with all sorts of mysteries, secrets and 
peculiarities.His character  is pushed to such extremes that these 
also push away one's interest in James.</P>
<P>It was Gertrude Stein who said that she prefers normal people over 
abnormal ones, "because the normal ones are so much more interesting."</P>
<P>I'll modify this by "eccentrics can be appealing; weirdos seldom are."</P>
<P>James is a congenital liar, a fabulator who keeps inventing his past, 
an occasional thief, a smoker of Grady's cannabis. I suppose that 
those traits mean that he's a genuine writer.</P>
<P>Moreover, James is a savant on matters cinematographic. When it comes 
to Hollywood facts and trivia he has a bottomless memory. Early on he 
recites a list of actors who  killed themselves, with precise dates 
of their suicides. He could win millions with movie trivia  such as 
"Marilyn was small but most people don't know it." It's unreal, even 
if film history teachers would love to have James clones in their 
classes. And it also reminds me of what philosopher Henri Bergson, 
the 1927 Nobel winner for literature,  said around 1900: "Memory is 
the intelligence of imbeciles."</P>
<P>The movie is hellbent on throwing the viewers off-balance,on 
depicting weirdness at all costs,whether arbitrarily open --as 
in-jokes-- or as cryptic allusions. Even fleeting details are 
commandeered, such as Sara's car, a white vintage French Peugeot DS, 
already rare in the 60s and 70s USA. Does this intend to connect to 
the older, hippie days  for the benefit of sharp-eyed cognoscenti and 
deconstructionists? Yet over and above throwaway bits, irritations 
and such, the movie does have its big share of fun, human comedy and 
near-slapstick. If ever a film needed a follow-up screening, this is 
it.</P>
