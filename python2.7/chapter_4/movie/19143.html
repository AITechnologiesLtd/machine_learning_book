<P>   Just when you thought you could put to bed the idea that
the Kennedy assassination was a conspiracy, along comes a
thriller that makes you think that such an intricately-planned
operation could not have been the work of one loser. 
"Arlington Road," a political blockbuster that recalls Alan J.
Pakula's "The Parallax View," deals more with large-scale
terrorist activity in the U.S. than with a plot to assassinate
one man.  But by carefully showing the enormous amount of
planning that political criminals make to carry out a plan by
clockwork, Mark Pellington's tingler--from a script by Ehren
Kruger that alternates flashes of intense anxiety with
moments of almost sluggish meditation--cannot help giving
the viewer the impression that guys like Lee Harvey Oswald
are mere patsies for sophisticated and malevolent schemers.</P>
<P>   Summoning memories of the bombings of corporate and
governmental buildings in New York and Oklahoma City,
"Arlington Road" recollects events as diverse as the recent
bloodbath at Columbine High School and, in fact, rumor has it
that the opening of the film was postponed in deference to
that cataclysmic incident.  But while "Arlington Road" has
obligatory moments of savagery, director Pellington is far
more interested in portraying the steady emotional
deterioration of a good man who is already on edge because
of the recent tragic death of his wife--an F.B.I. agent who had
been gunned down in a botched raid on a presumed right-
wing cult.  Like "The Parallax View," this film shows how a
cerebral fellow becomes increasingly frightened to the point
of paranoia each time he uncovers new evidence of a far-
reaching political conspiracy.  Whereas in Alfred Hitchcock's
"Psycho" and currently in Spike Lee's "Summer of Sam" the
paranoid personalities are exhibited as is, in Ehren Kruger's
script we observe how a man's mental state steadily and
rapidly declines as his research into an alleged criminal
unfolds new confirmations.  However unbalanced the central
character's faculty becomes, the viewer cannot help coming
away from this movie with the sense that this disintegration
can happen to any of us, given the right circumstances.</P>
<P>   The opening scene, photographed by Bobby Bukowski as
though events were taking place in a drug-induced nightmare,
reveals a frightened 9-year-old boy running spastically across
a suburban road, blood dripping slowly onto his sneakers. 
His life is saved by American History teacher Michael
Faraday (Jeff Bridges), who happens upon the lad while he is
driving home and rushes him to a hospital.  This incident
leads to Faraday's being introduced to the boy's parents,
Oliver Lang (Tim Robbins) and Oliver's wife Cheryl (Joan
Cusack)--who until then have pretty much kept to themselves. 
Both Faraday and Lang have been emotionally on edge, the
latter for an event which occurred when he was a teenager,
and Faraday for having lost his F.B.I.-employed wife who was
gunned down in a shootout.  Faraday has meanwhile hooked
up with a former graduate assistant, Brooke Wolfe (Hope
Davis) to whom he confides results of research into his
neighbor's background.  Insisting that Lang is involved in a
murderous conspiracy against the federal government, he
fails to convince either Brooke or his contact in the F.B.I.,
Agent Whit Carver (Robert Gossett).  Unable to sway the
people closest to him, Faraday increasingly loses his
balance.</P>
<P>   At many points in this frequently pulsating film, Bridges has
a difficult time convincing the audience as well.  One of
America's finest actors, Bridges--perhaps the current
decade's answer to Robert Mitchum--is best known for his
hangdog and manic expressions, as in his performance as a
wastrel in "Cutter's Way" and as well for the energy he
exhibits in "Tucker."  He was at his best in Peter Weir's 1993
film "Fearless" as the stunned survivor of a plane crash who
is unable to cope with his family but finds solace with another
survivor who has lost her baby in the same accident.  This
time around, his character must deal not only with the pain of
losing his wife so tragically in a gun battle but with the
knowledge that he is on to a major conspiracy while the
people he leans on the most are patronizing, if not simply
skeptical. </P>
<P>   Sandwiched between a high-strung opening and a tension-
filled conclusion, "Arlington Road" is, like Alan J. Pakula's
"Consenting Adults," yet another take not simply on what
distress kindles beneath the competent surface of educated
people but as well with the danger lurking under the civilized
and manicured veneer of a picturesque suburban community. 
During World War 2 a popular expression about Australia was
"there's no hiding place down there."  Pellington reinforces
that concept with his new movie.  While two vast oceans
serve as America's moat protecting the republic from foreign
invasion since 1814, and while the Cold War is now a fading
memory, we must confront the enemy that lurks within. 
Whether you live in New York's Columbus Circle or the
suburbs of Columbus, Ohio, you can never feel confident of
your safety.  Michael Faraday makes that point clear in his
passionate lectures to his classes at Georgetown University. 
Oliver Lang hammers the subject home, his quiet suburban
life with his all-American family belying a nefarious intrigue.  </P>
<P>  Yes, Virginia: people can indeed be pushed over the edge
by events beyond their control.  Jeff Bridges' performance as
an already tormented man driven to psychosis by the loss of
his wife, the kidnapping of his boy, and research that
convinces him of a fiendish design against his government, is
both frightening and persuasive.  "Arlington Road" is rousing
summer entertainment.</P>
