<P>     I'M NOT RAPPAPORT, Herb Gardner's 1986 Tony award winning play, 
comes to the screen with the actor Gardner had originally envisioned in 
the lead role.  Although Judd Hirsch won his own Tony for playing Nat in 
the Broadway version, Gardner had always wanted to see Walter Matthau's 
interpretation of the character.  Unfortunately, at the time of the 
play's run, Matthau had been unable to commit to eight shows a week, so 
Hirsch was offered the role.  But, when the opportunity arose to make a 
movie adaptation, Gardner approached Matthau, who agreed 
enthusiastically.  Ossie Davis, one of several actors to play Midge on 
the stage, welcomed the opportunity to reprise his part.</P>
<P>     Davis and Matthau appeared together a few years ago in GRUMPY OLD 
MEN, and, in a sense, their relationship in I'M NOT RAPPAPORT is 
strikingly similar.  Yet, while this film has much of the irascible 
charm and wit of the earlier movie, it is more affecting and churns 
deeper waters.  In GRUMPY OLD MEN, we laugh at the characters because 
they are silly, funny, and likable.  In I'M NOT RAPPAPORT, we laugh with 
them because we understand not only who they are, but who they wish they 
had become.</P>
<P>     The movie revolves around the unlikely friendship of two eighty-
year old men who, despite infirm bodies and failing eyesight, aren't 
ready to give up on life.  Together, they sit around on benches in New 
York's Central Park, argue with each other, discuss life and philosophy, 
reminisce about better days, argue some more, share a joint, and try to 
do their small part in righting the world's wrongs.  And, while most of 
their efforts are ultimately ineffective, it isn't until the very end 
that we, like them, recognize that even apparent failures can be 
successes.</P>
<P>     Several minor characters occasionally cross Nat and Midge's paths.  
Nat's daughter, Clara (Amy Irving), doesn't trust her father on his own 
and wants to put him in an old age home.  Laurie (Martha Plimpton), an 
attractive artist, watches the pair from afar, sketching them.  The 
Cowboy (Craig T. Nelson), a high-testosterone drug dealer, roams the 
park on business.  Danforth (Boyd Gaines), the yuppy spokesman of the 
group that wants to fire Midge from his maintenance job, breaks the bad 
news only to have the situation unexpectedly blow up in his face.  And a 
mugger (Guillermo Diaz) tries to extort protection money from Nat.</P>
<P>     For the most part, the plot is incidental.  What matters in I'M NOT 
RAPPAPORT are the characters and their dialogue.  Over the two-plus hour 
running time, Nat and Midge touch on an amazing variety of subjects:  
unions and bosses ("their tactics haven't changed in one century"), age 
("an old man like me, I could wander through the world like a ghost"), 
memories ("nostalgia kills more of us than heart disease"), and the war 
between idealism and realism ("I got smarter -- I fought in battles I 
thought I could win").  They talk and talk and talk, and they're always 
a delight to listen to, whether we're hearing Nat's tall stories or 
Midge's less fanciful reflections.  </P>
<P>     I'M NOT RAPPAPORT reveals its characters in steps.  Because Nat and 
Midge are played by Matthau and Davis, a  pair of "audience-friendly" 
performers, we're prone to like them, but it isn't until we spend some 
time in their company that our initial impressions are validated.  
Through two short flashbacks (a 1909 labor union rally and images of a 
shy girl who committed suicide), we learn what motivates Nat, and why he 
is so desperate to make a difference.  Because he blames himself for a 
death, he is forever trying to atone.  With a similar economy of scenes, 
we gain a wealth of insight into Midge's personality -- he's an ex-prize 
fighter on the ropes.  Until he meets Nat, that is.</P>
<P>     Matthau and Davis have both invested a great deal of heart and 
energy into this production, and it shows.  While their names on the 
marquee all-but-ensure an element of quality in any film, their work in 
I'M NOT RAPPAPORT represents a mark of distinction for each of them.  
The supporting performers are all solid -- each gets one prominent scene 
to compliment, but not eclipse, the leads.</P>
<P>     I'M NOT RAPPAPORT is the kind of movie that grows on you.  It's 
obviously a play that has been adapted for the cinema, but that doesn't 
take anything away from the delicate magic that Gardner has conjured by 
his use of sly comedy and keen social insight.  While it's true that 
this is essentially a buddy movie, it's a very special one. Nat and 
Midge's friendship reminds us of what bonding really is -- and it 
doesn't have anything to do with dodging bullets or running away from 
exploding buildings.  In the final analysis, this motion picture is far 
more about a rapport than a Rappaport.</P>
