<P>   Sometimes large ambitions can be realized with
inconsequential admonitions.  In the case of "Billy's Hollywood
Screen Kiss," the writer-director ends the movie with the
caption, "A Tommy O'Haver trifle," yet he opens the scenario
with his lead character's pronouncement that he intends to
bring straights and gays closer together.  I think that the title
person, Billy (Sean P. Hayes), understands the straight world
well enough; he wants to get heterosexuals to fathom where
homosexuals are coming from a little more.  And the principal
stereotype held by heteros that he aspires to explode is that
gays are largely promiscuous: that their pairings-off have
nothing to do with discrimination but are designed simply to
afford them sexual release.  To O'Haver's credit, that very
large pigeonholing is discredited without the slightest pinch of
pretentiousness or weighty plotting.  "Billy's Hollywood Screen
Kiss" features likable characters whose flaws may include
opportunism and confusion but who are otherwise delightful
beings with whom to spend an hour and a half.</P>
<P>   O'Haver uses a cute distancing device throughout the film,
a series of Polaroid snapshots which Billy has allegedly taken
behind the viewfinder of the camera he carries around at all
times.  He is unemployed but hopes that his photography will
get him noticed, preferably via a gallery exhibition set up by
an established lenser.  He is not confused by his sexual
identity but he is baffled by his inability to find someone to
commit himself to, another soul who could likewise find him
attractive.  In this longing he precisely mirrors the folks in
straight society, thereby showing the audience that gays and
straights are really the same.  </P>
<P>   In a series of episodes divided by a display of Polaroids,
Billy first presents exhibit A, that of himself in bed with
Fernando (Armando Valdes-Kennedy), who likes him but is
committed to someone else.  When he runs into a
staggeringly handsome coffee-shop waiter, Gabriel (Brad
Rowe), he's in love.  Though Gabriel repeatedly speaks of a
girl friend he left behind in San Francisco when he went to
L.A. for fame and fortune, he sends out mixed signals.  Billy is
hopeful that the girl friend is a fabrication and, against the
advice of his roommate Georgiana (Meredith Scott Lynn) and
his well-to-do friend Perry (Richard Ganoung), he pursues the
26-year-old man.  </P>
<P>   The movie gets its title from the way that our current
romantic imagination is fueled by the old Hollywood pictures
like "From Here to Eternity."  In fact, Billy gets Gabriel a job
modeling for master photographer Rex Webster (Paul Bartel)
simulating a scene at Catalina Island from that famous Burt
Lancaster-Deborah Kerr sizzler.  In the film's most tender
scene, painstakingly milked for poignancy by director
O'Haven, Billy gets Gabriel to share his bed and slowly, like
any straight man seeking to get somewhere with the object of
his devotion, cautiously and "accidentally" touches him on his
bare torso to observe a reaction. What results fashions the
movie's climax--so to speak--and leads Billy to go ahead with
a Polaroid show in which Hollywood romantic scenes are re-
created.</P>
<P>   In a clever subplot, Billy's roommate Georgiana becomes
involved in a one-night stand with a drugged hippie (Carmine
Giovinazzo) who sings a ridiculous love song to her which he
composed on his guitar.  The movie has a bittersweet ending,
but most of all this light and airy fiction conjures up dream
worlds with which Shakespeare himself was not unfamiliar.</P>
<PRE>Rated R.  Running time: 92 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten
