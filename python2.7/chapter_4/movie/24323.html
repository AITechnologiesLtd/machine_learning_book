<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P> All right.  I withered away my youth watching "The Flintstones" like
just about every other kid in the 80s.  That doesn't mean I have to like
the movie or feel the slightest pang of nostalgia.  I won't give any
special points to The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas for invoking some
memory in me of the pre Cartoon Network days when I watched "The
Flintstones" on a black and white TV located outside of my room in the
house that I grew up in.</P>
<P> Viva Rock Vegas is bad.  Real bad.  It features the same kind of dry
humor that the show did, and thus makes you wonder why you watched the
show in the first place.  It slowly sucks the life out of you and gets
progressively worse in a 80-minute running time that feels like two
hours.  It has the high point of watching The Great Gazoo, an alien sent
to observe prehistoric man's mating patterns, get kicked and crash into
signs.</P>
<PRE> It really, really stinks.</PRE>
<P> Viva Rock Vegas opens with the standard Universal logo redone in
tied-together wood and retitled "Univershell."  This provides yet
another bleakly high point, as, being tired when I saw this movie, I
read the logo as "Universe Hell" instead of the intended "Universe
Shell."  This brought a small laugh out of me.  It just so happens that
was all the movie was able to garner up in the way of entertainment.</P>
<P> The story goes as such: Fred (Mark Addy) and Barney (Steven Baldwin)
have just graduated from construction school.  Elated and prompted by
The Great Gazoo (Alan Cumming), the two go out in search for dates.
They find said dates in the form of Betty (Jane Krakowski) and Wilma
(Kristen Johnson).  Betty is very lower class, but Wilma comes from a
large mansion on a mountain overlooking bedrock.  Wilma is under
constant pressure by her mother (Joan Collins) to marry Chip Rockefellar
(Thomas Gibson), so she runs away and moves in with Betty.</P>
<P> Predictable, the four fall in love.  Even more predictably, Chip
invites them to Rock Vegas to attempt to steal Wilma from Fred.  A few
things from are explained in this film: how Wilma got her pearls, where
Dino came from, and why the dinosaurs went extinct (apparently, someone
had been poisoning their water supply).  To the "Flintstones" fanatic,
these will matter.  To everyone else, who cares.</P>
<P> Krakowski is delightful as Betty, who she basically plays the same way
she does her character on Ally MacBeal.  Baldwin proves once again why
film critics hate the Baldwin clan.</P>
<P> All in all, Viva Rock Vegas is a very bad run-of-the-mill movie with a
few bright points, making it a complete waste of your time.  It's lame,
predictable, and just plain unfunny.  So, for God's sake, don't watch
it.</P>
<PRE>1.5 stars</PRE>
