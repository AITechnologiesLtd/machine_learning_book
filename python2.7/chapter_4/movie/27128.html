<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>An interesting contemporary view of cowboys and Indians, told through
the relationship that develops between a hard-living old timer on the
rodeo circuit Red Dillon (Widmark) who is barely getting by and a young
Ute Indian boy, Tom Black Bull (Forrest), who has an affinity for horses
and uses this knowledge to get off the reservation.</P>
<P>When Tom's parents die, he's too young to be left alone on the mountains
and is brought by a friend of the family, John War Eagle, to the
reservation. He is told by the white superintendent that he must learn
about the new ways before he talks to him about the old ways, and the
young boy is forced to learn the white man's ways at the school against
his wishes. He reluctantly stays on the reservation, eventually becoming
trained to only do manual work as a sheepherder, until he is spotted by
Red while horse riding. Red gets the 18-year-old a permit to become his
guardian, which he must do until he is 21, at which time he becomes a
free man. He gladly moves in with Red, where they go on the rodeo
circuit in the small venues out West. Tom develops into an outstanding
bronco rider, while Red spends the money Tom earns on booze and women,
cheating Tom out of his share. He also gets Tom to dump bronco rides so
that he can then bet on him in other bronco rides and get odds. After
being on the road for a few years, Tom dumps Red in a gas station and
takes his car, leaving him stranded with $10 and a bottle of booze,
realizing that he has learned a trade and that even though he has a warm
spot in his heart for Red...but, fully realizing that Red can't
change...he will always be a boozer. Tom is determined to make his mark
in bronco riding... honestly.</P>
<PRE>Spoiler in the next paragraph.</PRE>
<P>In the next few years he becomes a big star on the top rodeo circuit,
though developing a reputation for riding his horses so hard that he
killed four of them. The introspective, reticent boy, experiences
relations with white women and learns how to dress as a dude, but his
dreams come crashing down when he has a bad spill on a ride and is
hospitalized and put out of action for awhile. After a brief
relationship with a divorced nurse, he returns to Tom's small ranch and
watches as Tom goes on one last binge and dies. He then buries Tom with
the expensive saddle he brought him as a gift to show Tom his
appreciation for what he meant to him, and he burns down Tom's squalid
ranch as a symbolic gesture to cut his bridges and move on. He feels
lost and imprisoned, but this time it is not by the reservation or by
Tom, but by being lured into the American Dream.</P>
<P>Widmark is outstanding as the aging cowboy, who could be generous as
well as a bully, and who turns out to be the only friend the Ute has.
Frederic Forrest captures the spirit of the noble savage trying to
understand and survive in the civilization he is forced to live in.
Their superb characterizations about the cowboy's hard life and romantic
visions, living as loners, often traveling on dusty roads into one-horse
towns while hanging out in tawdry bars, gives this film a special force,
filled with a moody noirish atmosphere.</P>
