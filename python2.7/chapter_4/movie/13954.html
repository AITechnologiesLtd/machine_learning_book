<PRE>>From 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
3 stars</PRE>
<P>Get ready, get set, go: it's the Commander Elites versus the Gargonites.
The Elites, a group of allegiant US soldiers and the Gargonites, a
collection of mutated monsters from another planet. But this ain't no
battle in space or the future - it's Winslow Corners, Ohio, and the
troops are no more than ten inches tall.  They're toys, you see, and
their elaborate minds kick into high gear to create a bad-ass Toy Story
on steroids.  With all reasonable credibility stacked against it, Joe
Dante (of Gremlins fame) makes it work.  And never since we saw Buzz
Lightyear and Woody on the screen have action figures actually generated
some sort of emotion, mar the fact that all the Elite bastards want to
do is destroy every and anything allied with the Gargonites.</P>
<P>If it all sounds a little childish, a little predictable and a lot
unrealistic, rest assured - it is.  But heck, it's all about fun, and it
comes in bucket loads when you watch the manufactured toys slug it out.
Although it as first seems that Dante is unsure of whom he wants us to
barrack for, the "there will be no mercy" Elites become poised as a
splendid group of baddies, who think that they're the heroes of the
story.</P>
<P>Two bumbling employees of Globe Tech, presumably some sort of high tech
and omnipotent organization, design a new set of toys to impress the
boss.  In order for the toys to think and react by themselves, state of
the art military chips are inserted into them.  The Commando Elites are
programmed to destroy the enemy at any price, and the Gargonites to hide
and search for their home planet Gargon.  Thus a memorable bunch of
misfits are created but with no specific originality - the cliché
characters are well and truly evident, especially in the hard-hitting
leader of the Elite's (voice of Tommy Lee Jones) and the set of bumbling
(but lovable) Gorganites.</P>
<P>I guess it goes without saying that the team from Industrial Light &
Magic have once again created some splendid animation eye candy; the
toys don't move like cartoon characters, they move like toys.  Their
voices are played by a wide range of quirky counterparts: Jones, Frank
Langella, Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and
Christina Ricci amongst others.</P>
<P>The human cast, given the tough job of reacting to our little
instigators, are a fairly lifeless bunch.  The only actor who breathes
much needed energy into his character is the late Phil Hartman, in his
last screen role.  And although Hartman is at his best only when he is
the instigator (take his hilarious character in News Radio, for
example), this is certainly a worthy final performance for someone who
was one of the true funnymen on TV.</P>
<P>The only really discouraging aspect of Dante's unique creation is the
poorly written, poorly executed battle sequences.  The framework for
these scenes is too simplistic and repetitive, as we find our baneful
Elites doing everything possible to strike miniature amounts of terror
into the audience.  They squirm, wriggle and twist their way into vapid
scenarios, which mostly involve a large catapulting device or a speedy
flying contraption.  Not even the addition of hundreds of aggressive
Barbie dolls manages to give the scenes more credibility. But in all
fairness, the final moments make some great viewing - who would have
thought that a showdown between two toys on top of a telephone pole
would be one of the most memorable action sequences this year?</P>
<P>Despite the fact that Small Soldiers might well be one of the most
grisly kids flicks in recent years, Dante seems unclear whom to market
it for, with its childlike moments of super-happy-fun and its
particularly gruesome end to the team of Elites.  But still, he does
make it work, and in an industry where action figures can be a huge
slice of the market, it's refreshing to see a film which subtly parodies
the commercialism of mainstream cinema.   Or perhaps, Dante is just
having some fun.</P>
