<PRE>                                   MICHAEL
                       A film review by Paul Miller
                        Copyright 1997 Paul Miller</PRE>
<P>Going to see a movie about an angel is not my idea of a good movie.  But
if that angel John Travolta and he drinks, smokes, and has sex with any
beautiful girl that he meets, I might reconsider.</P>
<P>The movie begins with William Hurt (Frank Quinlan) and Robert Pastorelli
(Huey Driscoll) working for a paper called the National Mirror.  (sort
of like the National Enquirer). While sifting through his fan mail one
day, Frank finds a letter from a women that claims to have an angel
living with her.  Of course, Frank and Huey are eager to check this out.
They want to clear it with they boss (Bob Hoskins) and they find out
that they can go, but they have to take a so-called angel expert with
them.  So Dorothy (Andie MacDowell) tags along.  </P>
<P>Soon, they find themselves in Iowa and they find there angel.  Only he's
like nothing they ever imagined.  As questioning begins to why he
doesn't fit the "norm" of what angels are supposed to be, he responds
with "I'm not that kind of angel.".  Well, it turns out he's an
archangel and his job was to battle Satan and put him where he belongs.
They take him back to the National Mirror so they can draw up a story
and on the way back they get into adventures and see being an angel is a
hard job.</P>
<P>There were many familiar faces in this movie past the four already
mentioned.  Teri Garr plays a judge in a small Iowa town and the LOVELY
Carla Gugino (from Spin City) plays a wasted role as a bride in one of
the bars they visit.</P>
<P>If I said that I didn't like this movie even a little bit, I would be
lying.  As a movie fan I would say this was a good movie with believable
characters and a plot that was sweet and innocent.  But as a movie
critic, I honestly have to say that there just wasn't much there.</P>
<P>It still enjoyed this movie, but there could have been more to it than
just the straight forward material that was there.</P>
