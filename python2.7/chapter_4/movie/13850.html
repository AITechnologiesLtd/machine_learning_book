<P>TV stars Tim Allen and Kirstie Alley jump into a cinematic comedy about
a rich couple having to deal with the sudden loss of all of their
assets.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Rich, self-absorbed husband and wife team fall into major IRS problems,
when their accountant steals from their funds, and flees the country.
Forced to hide from the government until their lawyer gets things
settled, the duo crash in on an Amish community, and pretend to be
long-lost cousins. Then, the "hilarity" begins.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Uninspired, predictable, and mostly unfunny comedy that joins TRIAL AND
ERROR (4/10) in proving that for some reason, Hollywood executives like
to correlate bad comedies with longer run times (This one clocks in at
a little under two hours.) I never really understood why people in the
Woods of Holly liked to explore the Amish community to such an extent
in film, and this bad movie does little to resolve my unanswerable
query. KINGPIN (8/10) successfully stepped through such a community
last year, but this movie just doesn't gather any comedy or originality
out of this age-old community of people. </P>
<P>In regards to the actors, Tim Allen doesn't add anything to this
horrible punch, and Alley barely musters any added value, after she
spends the first hour and a half of the film whining about her newfound
situation. Larry Miller is actually pretty funny as the overly
exuberant IRS agent on their tail (He carries a large gun with him at
all times.) But other than him, the film is basically retreading the
old "fish out of water" tale for the umpteenth time, without a whimper
of innovation or entertainment.</P>
<P>The worst part about this movie is that even the lame attempts at
humour are marred by adult content, which disavows any kids from seeing
this dud on video. And to top that off, they decide to pull another
pseudo-case of MY GIANT (6/10) and get semi-serious near the end of the
film (This is where we recognize these people as regular folks like you
and I with hearts.) Not one laugh out loud joke here. Nothing original
to add to anything based in Amish folklore. Actors are very generic in
their roles. Avoid this one at all costs, and please try to recommend
it to those all those people who you deeply despise. </P>
<P>By the way, if you do happen to rent it by mistake, at least stay tuned
for the outtakes during the end credits. They are actually the only
snickerable things in the whole movie (Not a good sign.) </P>
<P>Little Known Facts: 
In 1978, Tim Allen spent 28 months in jail after being arrested for
attempted drug dealing. His real name is Timothy Allen Dick. He has
