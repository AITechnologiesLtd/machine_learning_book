<PRE>Herd of Disneysauruses?
Dinosaur</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Not quite the realistic Dinosaurs of "Jurassic Park," nor are they the
decidedly caricatures of "Toy Story 2." These Mesozoics are a cute computer
cross between cartoons and muppets.</P>
<P>In the grand opening scene, a fought after dinosaur egg trades hands (er..
ah claws) from one reptile to the next until a pteranodon (bird-like
reptile) drops it on some distant Lemur Island. (Anybody know if primates
and dinosaurs shared the same geological time period?) Anyway, the dominant
male lemur wants to discard this inauspicious scaley baby, but is soon
endeared to it. So, too, was I. Expecting big things from these Disney
people, the sweeping egg-toss sequence didn't quite grab me; and then with
the advent of that inter-species adoption - I sniffed a "Tarzan" copy.</P>
<P>But with the pace of a shooting star, the film changes direction as the
inhabitants of the lush Lemur Island are forced into a hasty exodus. I'll
leave the reason for their flight a surprise, but will say this ... it's
lovely. Absolutely lovely. A fantastically magical, chillingly glowing,
horrifically compelling sequence. It sucked me in like a tar pit (but it
wasn't a tar pit).</P>
<P>>From there the now grown dinosaur (Aladar) and his small pack of chimps join
a herd of other "sauruses" as they brave the dangerous and course migration
to a dreamy nesting place. Aladar exhibits some
out-of-previously-established character, cocky behavior, especially
inappropriate given present circumstances. This oversight could have been
corrected with the addition of a scene or two in Aladar's growing up period.</P>
<P>Kron (the head honchosaurus) leads the pack with an evolutionary Darwinistic
iron fist (er.. ah claw). "Then let the weaker ones die, they'll slow our
predators." Apparently, Darwin had never been to Disneyland. Of course,
Aladar encourages everyone to work together for the common good -- help each
other out. It's kind of hokey, but aside from a few hints at "mating" that's
about all the film has to offer in the meaning department.</P>
<P>But in the adventure and waycool-to-look-at departments - the film boulders!
(er.. ah rocks!)</P>
