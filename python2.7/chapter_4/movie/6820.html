<PRE>               A film review by Walter Frith</PRE>

<P>Director Peter Hyams whose films include 'Hanover Street' (1979) 'The Star
Chamber' (1983) and the protracted sequel to '2001: A Space Odyssey' entitled
'2010: The Year We Make Contact' (1984) and many other films, most of them
mediocre at best has emerged with his latest offering entitled 'The Relic.'
 A museum in Chicago is subjected to being terrorized by a South American
monster that is part insect, part amphibian and part human.  After setting up
the story it then turns into a cheap slasher film with little or no
imagination and is an embarassment to the film industry at large.  An
evolutionary biologist (Penelope Ann Miller) works at solving the origins of
this creepy beast and a homicide detective (Tom Sizemore) is along for the
ride.  The biologist, detective and even the film's portrayal of the mayor
are all stereotypes we've seen over and over again.  I was even further
appalled at the claustrophobic nature of this film which muddles its way down
dark tunnels and long corridors in an attempt to find the chilling effect of
any horror film we've seen before.  After a while the film becomes even more
boring and silly.  It's downright trivial the further and further it goes on.
 Director Hyams acts as his own director of photography like he has in the
past and his liking of lens flare for moody effects is hard on the eyes
before too long.  Academy award winning actress Linda Hunt and veteran actor
James Whitmore round out notable members of the cast and their talents are
way above this turkey of a movie.</P>
