<P>HOW STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK (Twentieth-Century Fox)
Sitting through "How Stella Got Her Groove Back," adapted from the
novel by Terry McMillan, is like listening to the private fantasies of any
number of young women -- black, white, Asian, etc. -- who feel dissatisfied
with their lives but too timid to make major changes. The movie, two hours
of sumptuous-looking wish-fulfillment, should appeal greatly to this
audience, provided they're willing to overlook some substantial problems in
the material.
Stella, the ostensibly grooveless heroine, is played by the
stunning Angela Bassett, who couldn't look out-of-sorts even if she went
without sleep for a week. Although Stella has a prime position as an
investment banker, an almost eerily polite pre-teen son Quincy (Michael J.
Pagan) and a magnificent San Francisco home, she's been sleeping single in a
double bed for many moons. During an impromptu journey to Jamaica with her
ribald best friend Delilah (Whoopi Goldberg), 40-year-old Stella slips into
the arms of the improbably named Winston Shakespeare (Taye Diggs), a
20-year-old dreamboat debating over whether or not to attend medical school.
This is the kind of film that has to go to great lengths to tell us Winston
is very intelligent, since his behavior throughout the story suggests
otherwise.
Although the duo seem to have nothing in common except a penchant
for making love in rooms bathed in the glorious glow of a sunset or doing it
in the shower while warm water outlines their magnificently chieseled
bodies, Stella finds it difficult to walk away from her casual fling,
especially since she returns home to find her gossipy sisters (Regina King
and Suzzanne Douglas) want to speak of nothing else. The age difference
seems to shock most everyone in Stella's circle to no end, although one of
the curious flaws of "Stella" is that Bassett and Diggs don't look like
they're a generation removed from each other; it's not exactly Anne Bancroft
and Dustin Hoffman.
The Jamaica sojourn -- easily the best and most enjoyable portion
of the movie -- gives way to multiple conversations and debates over the
wisdom of pursuing a hot young lover. Winston eventually comes to visit
Stella and ends up spending more time playing video games with Quincy than
seeking out a career. When Stella and Winston go to the movies, they end up
seeing what looks like a sex comedy rather than the more sophisticated
entertainment she prefers, and Stella admits to Delilah Winston has been
messing up the bed with, of all things, Cocoa Puffs.
Is Stella robbing the cradle? Is Winston robbing the grave? Will
the movie ever include a single scene that doesn't feel wholly manufactured?
"Stella" comes straight from the "designer problems" school of
screenwriting, a genre in which stories are built around wealthy, gorgeous
people who have to create their own miseries in order for anything remotely
dramatic to occur. Like designer clothes, these kinds of worries are far
above the means of most of us.
Stella, for example, loses her job even though she appears to be
the only one in her office who ever works and she's certainly the only
African-American woman in the place; can you say "instant lawsuit"? Most of
us, faced with unemployment, would immediately begin a job hunt and avoid
unnecessary expenses. But our gal Stella wings to Jamaica, lives it up,
flies back to the islands again, jumps on a plane to New York at the drop of
a hat, moves Quincy and Winston into the Waldorf, and then hires a limo to
take her home from the airport. Yet she somehow finds time to fret over how
she's going to make next month's mortgage payment as she and Winston dine
out at an elegant-looking bistro.
In the midst of so much glittering cotton candy, Bassett comes
across as a pillar of strength and credibility, even if you can't imagine
such a terrific woman would ever spend a night alone or waste time listening
to the disapproval of friends and family. Diggs has a great smile but
Winston exists primarily as a concept rather than a a character. Goldberg
and King contribute refreshing sass, although Whoopi should think twice
about any future projects that call upon her to die with dewey eyes and a
tremble in her voice.
