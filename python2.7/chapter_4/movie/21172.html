<P>STARRING:  Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf
DIRECTOR:  David Fincher
WRITTEN BY:  Jim Uhls (based on a novel by Chuck Palahniuk)</P>
<P>Not since Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers has there been a movie
this incendiary, and not since David Cronenberg has a so-called
mainstream director been this willing to repeatedly tiptoe the fine
line between pointed social commentary and outright social
irresponsibility.  While Fincher's films have never suffered from a
lack of shock value (his major character killings in both Alien 3 and
Seven are fine examples), Fight Club marks the distillation of his
pitch-black comedic sensibility (see 1997's The Game) into something
like a definitive statement.</P>
<P>Jack (Norton, acting as both narrator and protagonist) is your typical
cubicle clone, whose disillusionment is amplified by a seemingly
incurable insomnia.  On the offhand advice of a doctor, he sits in on
group-therapy sessions for everything from blood parasites to
testicular cancer.  Here he meets Bob (Marvin Lee Aday, AKA Meat
Loaf), a cancer-emasculated eunuch with profound gynecomastia.
Strangely, the release he finds while sobbing on Bob's breasts allows
him to sleep at night, at least until a fellow group-therapy "tourist"
named Marla Singer (Carter) comes along to ruin things for him,
forcing a grudging compromise that recalls Monty Python in its dark
hilarity.  Later, he meets Tyler Durden (Pitt), a soap salesman with a
decidedly subversive outlook on life.  One night, after his IKEA-
furnished condo explodes (don't ask-- you'll just have to see the
movie, awright?), he is goaded by Tyler into a fight, and damned if it
doesn't feel good.  It is pure, raw existence, a brief moment of
clarity and purpose that makes his dreary workaday life pale in
comparison.  He moves into Tyler's squalid abandoned mansion, and they
form the titular organization, an underground therapy group where men
bond with bare-knuckle savagery and very few rules, the first two of
which are "Don't Talk About Fight Club."  Armed with charisma and an
attractive anti-corporate philosophy, Tyler assumes leadership of the
burgeoning membership of white-collar slaves and dead-end McEmployees.
Resentment creeps into Jack's heart, made worse by the fact that Tyler
is also regularly and noisily boffing the hated Marla.  Funded by a
frivolous lawsuit, Tyler begins molding his devotees into an army
dedicated to mischief and mayhem.  Their initially juvenile pranks
(like pissing in food and putting spike belts on roads) quickly evolve
into something more like sedition, and Jack fears that things have
gone sour.</P>
<P>It is after this point, when you are plenty uncomfortable and
wondering just how far Fincher will go to say something original, that
the film uncorks a disappointing plot twist.  It is so contrived-- and
so conventional compared to what precedes it-- that everything which
follows (including the ending) becomes far less interesting.  It's a
major (though not fatal) flaw, and for a director as notoriously
unpredictable as Fincher, it feels like a cop-out.</P>
<P>Fight Club is going to be misconstrued by a great many people.  In the
early going, it has a downright dangerous feel; it seems to be saying
that violence and civil disobedience are good for the soul, and this
is undoubtedly the message that a few moronic punks are going to take
from it.  I'll be mightily surprised if imitation Fight Clubs don't
spring up here and there, and I'll be even more amazed if Fincher
isn't vilified for it by the same humorless witch-hunters that are
currently after Oliver Stone.  They needn't bother, because Fight Club
is less a message movie than Fincher's elaborate attempt at a joke.
Tyler Durden, for all his Dionysian allure, is really nothing more
than the logical (and far less hypocritical) extrapolation of all
those self-help gurus who constantly show up on Oprah to preach their
me-first gospel of self-actualization.  In this context, the joke
works, but like the latest Columbine joke, some people will get it and
enjoy a good laugh, and others won't.  Hopefully, though, their silly
moral outrage won't spoil the joke for the rest of us.</P>
