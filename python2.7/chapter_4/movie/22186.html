<PRE>DEUCE BIGALOW: MALE GIGOLO
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>Bob Bigalow (Richard Riehle) is a tuxedoed member of the restaurant
business, but he's neither a waiter nor a maitre d'.  He's a bathroom
attendant whose duties include cleaning up really awful toilet messes.</P>
<P>On Bob's birthday, his son, Deuce (Rob Schneider) comes to visit with
his new girlfriend, Kate (Arija Bareikis), and they bring a birthday
cake for him.  The lovebirds bring him the cake right into the stall,
where he is unstopping a badly clogged toilet.  Bob eats the cake with
his hands and sticks his fingers in his mouth to clean them off.
Granted, this is the low point of DEUCE BIGALOW: MALE GIGOLO, but the
rest of the crude story isn't much better.</P>
<P>The setup has Deuce, a fish tank cleaner by profession, babysitting a
sick fish at the apartment of a rich and successful male gigolo, Antoine
Laconte (Oded Fehr).  Antoine, a collector of ancient weaponry, has
given Deuce strict orders to make sure his expensively furnished
apartment isn't harmed in the 3 weeks that he's off to Europe.  Needless
to say, Deuce will shortly destroy the place in a fit of bad slapstick
antics.</P>
<P>In order to make the money to restore the apartment, Deuce takes a job
as a "male-whore" for Antoine's "man-pimp."  (The lame script by Harris
Goldberg and Rob Schneider has other, earthier names as well.)</P>
<P>The movie's idea of comedy is to force Deuce to cope with the problems
of women with a wide variety of handicaps and unusual physical
characteristics.  From a 600 pound women like Jabba Lady (Big Boy) to
women who cuss uncontrollably like Ruth (Amy Poehler), the women are
made to look almost like members of a circus freak show.  There's even
an 8-foot tall woman, whose face is never shown, but to whom strangers
call out insults as she walks with Deuce.  Funny, huh?  You're not
laughing?  Neither was I.</P>
<P>Did I mention the detective, played by William Forsythe, who has an
obsession with showing Deuce his private parts in public in order to get
advice?  And did I mention that this scene is repeated a half-dozen
times?</P>
<P>So, was it ever funny?  I think I laughed once, but, for the life of me,
I can't remember why.</P>
<P>DEUCE BIGALOW: MALE GIGOLO runs 1:30.  It is rated R for sexual
situations, crude sexual humor, nudity and language and would be
acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
