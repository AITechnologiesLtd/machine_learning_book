<P>Starring Keanu Reeves, John Hawkes, Trevor Morgan,
Bryan Hearne, Julian Griffith, Michael Jordan, Graham
Beckel, Allan Ellis Jr., Christopher Lofton, Michael
Perkins, Brian Reed, DeWayne Harris. Directed by Brian
Robbins. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>Hardball isn't what the advertising made it look like,
but it's too close. It could have been an
extraordinary story in a familiar framework; instead,
it's a conventional story with a few extraordinary
moments. Indeed, there are times, usually a few
seconds long, when the film is so genuine and
heart-rending that you wonder if the story cliches
weren't dictated to director Brian Robbins in the
interest of making something populist. Oh, and in
serious movies, Keanu Reeves seems to consistently be
a problem.</P>
<P>Conor O'Neill (Reeves) enters a church late at night.
The priest tells him that it's time to lock up, and
asks "Do you need faith? Forgiveness?" The response?
"I need the Bulls to make the spread." And how:
O'Neill is thousands of dollars in debt to bookies and
sports bar owners around Chicago. His last resort is a
wealthy stockbroker friend of his, who's at the end of
his rope. Instead of "lending" O'Neill another twelve
thousand dollars, he agrees to pay five hundred a week
to coach an inner city kids' baseball team.</P>
<P>One of Hardball's virtues is humanizing the "street
kids," most of whom eventually become gang members, or
worse. They're streetsmart and trash-talking, but
they're kids, with the same fears and anxieties as any
other 10-year-old. And as O'Neill predictably
rehabilitates himself through coaching this
disorganized-but-talented group of baseball players,
the most vivid personalities that emerge are those
same children.</P>
<P>There are moments when Hardball comes utterly alive. I
got bleary-eyed during the scene at the major-league
stadium, when the kids wave at Sammy Sosa and... he
waves back. Another scene has O'Neill visiting the
Projects home of Andre, one of his players. When
O'Neill asks what the kids do around here for fun,
Andre responds: "Play baseball with you."</P>
<P>For all the success the movie has with those little
moments, it strikes out with the main storyline, which
takes precisely the course you would expect. There's
not a single surprise along the way, from the kids'
gradual acceptance of O'Neill and vice-versa, to his
miraculous recovery, to the "sudden" death of one of
the main characters to the Big Game at the end (though
to the movie's credit, the game itself isn't shown,
but the penultimate game is). There's even the naughty
sidekick who tries to pull the protagonist back into
his nightmare.</P>
<P>Keanu Reeves is problematic. He has had mild success
as a serious actor -- I liked him in The Devil's
Advocate, and The Watcher -- but here he's too
jittery, as if someone told him to exaggerate his
every motion to the point of his performance looking
for all the world like a pantomime. I didn't buy Diane
Lane as teacher/love interest either, but maybe that's
because the script doesn't give her a chance to become
a character.</P>
<P>I can't give Hardball a high rating, but I suppose I'm
fond of it. It has some real poignancy, and real
people, somewhere under that nightmare of a plot. In
light of recent events, and the daunting prospect of
"rebuilding," here's a movie about a character who,
however predictably, rebuilds himself. If only it had
been, say, Ed Norton, instead of poor, old Keanu. But
I hear The Matrix Reloaded has started filming. </P>
