<PRE>                                   STARGATE
                       A film review by Jeffrey Graebner
                        Copyright 1994 Jeffrey Graebner</PRE>
<P>     For virtually everyone, there are a few films that fit into the
"guilty pleasure" category.  These are movies that are clearly not very
good, but which you still enjoy against your own better judgement.
STARGATE is just such a film.</P>
<P>     The storyline of this film is completely ludicrous.  The film
opens in the 1920s with the discovery of an unusual artifact in the
Egyptian desert.  It then jumps to the present day where the military
is involved in a scientific analysis of this artifact (the movie never
bothers to explain where the artifact had been for the last 70 years).
They bring in controversial but brilliant Egyptologist Dr. Jackson
(James Spader) who quickly figures out that the artifact is a
"stargate" allowing for instantaneous interstellar travel.  Soon,
Dr. Jackson is going along on a mission led by suicidal Col. O'Neil
(Kurt Russell) to the "other side of the known universe".  On the other
side, they discover a race of enslaved humans being ruled by an alien
posing as the sun god Ra (Jaye Davidson).  In the process, we learn the
"true" origins of the Great Pyramids.</P>
<P>     Obviously, this story sounds pretty ridiculous in print.  It
doesn't make much more sense in the film itself.  In fact, a large part
of the film's entertainment value comes from watching to see how much
more ludicrous the plot can become.  Just when you think the film has
reached a new height of silliness, it manages to come up with some new
ridiculous idea.  As silly as it all is, everyone involved in the film
seems to be taking it completely seriously.  The result probably works
much better than it would have if the filmmakers had acknowledged the
silliness of the plot and tried to play it for laughs.  Some of the fun
here comes from the fact that you will likely be laughing at things
that weren't really meant to be funny.</P>
<P>     Even with an extremely badly written role like he has here, James
Spader still manages to come out of the film with some dignity intact.
In order to indicate that he is an intellectual, but a bit of a dweeb,
Spader is made up to have an almost frightening resemblance to John
Denver.  He is one of those ultra-brilliant movie scientists who can
come in and immediately solve puzzles that other scientists have been
struggling with for years.  He also has outlandish theories that can
clear a conference room in a moment but which, of course, must turn out
to be completely true.  Spader is asked to give bizarre speeches
containing all kinds of technological buzzwords, do lots of bumbling
stunts (including being dragged across the desert by a strange alien
pack animal), translate and occasionally speak extinct Egyptian
dialects, participate in one of the most awkward love stories of recent
memory, and to frequently act indignant at the soldiers' behavior
(thankfully, he is never required to start singing "Rocky Mountain
High").  Despite all this, Spader still remains likable and even comes
close to creating a believable character.</P>
<P>     Russell, on the other hand, is given an incredibly cliched role
and does virtually nothing with it.  Early in the film, we are told
that Russell's character had a son who was accidentally shot. When we get
our first look at Russell, he has a gun to his head preparing to commit
suicide.  With those two little bits of information, you can probably
correctly guess >everything< that Russell is going to do in this
movie.  In general, Russell seemed bored like he didn't really want to
be there during most of the movie.</P>
<P>     Most of the publicity about Jaye Davidson's role in THE CRYING
GAME seemed to revolve around his character's secret, but that largely
ignored the fact that he gave a genuinely powerful and moving
performance in that film.  Unfortunately, his role here indicates that
he may be doomed to stunt casting from now on.  Despite the fact that
he is prominently featured in much of the promotional material for the
film, Davidson doesn't even appear until about ninety minutes into the
movie (which runs just under two hours).  All of his dialogue is
electronically enhanced and is in the film's version of ancient
Egyptian.  The majority of his "performance" is really just posing for
the camera instead of acting.  Hopefully, somebody will eventually find
Davidson another role with some depth, but this movie certainly isn't
it.</P>
<P>     Obviously, the storyline here does not live up to any kind of
close scrutiny.  If you try to look for logic here, you will likely
never find it. At the top of the list of implausibilities is Spader's
incredible ability to instantly read, speak, and understand ancient
Egyptian dialects, even if he has never encountered them before.  I
guess that it is somewhat courageous of the filmmakers not to have all
the aliens speak English, but they still take the easy way out by
allowing Spader to become a human "universal translator".  Another
major implausibility is the fact that the civilization on the other
planet seems to be technically way ahead of Earth, but that the humans
on the other side of the stargate do not seem to have evolved one bit
in thousands of years.</P>
<P>     Another major problem with this film is the unfortunate cliches
involved in the portrayal of the military.  Screenwriters Roland
Emmerich (who also directed) and Dean Devlin seem to have based the
soldiers on those from other paranoid science fiction movies.
Particularly during the early scenes, the soldiers seem rather cruel
and heartless, showing virtually no wonderment about their journey.  Of
course, the film eventually ends up turning into a massive shoot-em-up,
but it sure would have been nice if it had taken a more surprising
direction.</P>
<P>     Emmerich's direction of the film is a bit better than his
screen-writing.  The film moves at a very brisk pace and is certainly
never dull.  The whole movie is infused with a misguided but infectious
energy.  It is as if Emmerich realized how ridiculous the story was and
thus felt that it would help to have everyone >really< work hard to
sell it.  In a way, this almost works.  At times, Emmerich's direction
seems a bit amateurish, though.  Some of the action sequences are shot
so confusingly that it is really difficult to tell what is happening
(particularly surprising since the movie seems to have only about five
or six bad guys...)  As mentioned earlier, the romance between Spader
and a native girl is also handled awkwardly, largely as an
afterthought.</P>
<P>     The production values of the film are generally quite good.  There
are some really neat looking CGI special effects (particularly the
sequences where the characters travel through the stargate) which are
generally quite convincing.  Karl Walter Lindenlaub's Panavision
photography is also good with some really nice desert vistas.  David
Arnold's music score is not particularly original (it seems to borrow
from a number of other science fiction scores), but it is sufficiently
rousing and effective.  The soundtrack has a lot of bass and makes
extensive use of surround sound, so it is probably best to see the film
in a theater with the best possible sound system.</P>
<P>     STARGATE certainly is not a very good film, but it is generally an
enjoyable one.  Much of the enjoyment comes from laughing at the film's
ineptitude, a fact that likely would not please the filmmakers, but
that doesn't change the fact that the movie will provide a generally
good time.</P>
