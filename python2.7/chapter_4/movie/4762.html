<PRE>                                RICHARD III
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This is nothing less than the most
          enjoyable performance of Shakespeare I can remember
          seeing.  By staging RICHARD III sumptuously in
          1930s England, Richard Eyre's stage production, the
          basis of this film, has created a fascinating
          parallel history in which the dynastic rivalries of
          the War of the Roses occurred in the 20th Century.
          Rating: +3 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     I generally do not like to see historical dramatic works done in
modern dress.  I was excited when the Bayreuth production of Wagner's
RING OF THE NIBELUNGS was to be broadcast in this country, but when all
of the fantasy was sucked out by staging it in late 19th Century dress,
I decided that I was not really so anxious to see it after all.  It
seemed an attempt to replace the magic with social comment.  But in
this film, based on a popular London stage production, the modern
context is as much the show as the story.  We have a Britain in an age
to which we can relate brought under the control of a Fascist King.
Suddenly it is clear why modern dress (relatively speaking) can open up
and even transform the meaning of a story.  RICHARD III is told with
visual imagination and panache unusual for a 1930s film or a
Shakespeare play.  There are huge sets out of THE TRIUMPH OF THE WILL,
while other scenes have almost the flair of a Terry Gilliam.  The view
of 1930s England has a nicely accurate and detailed view even if this
is politically a very different 1930s England than the one we know from
history.</P>
<P>     Ian McKellen gives us a more immediate and riveting Richard than
the one we are used to from Laurence Olivier.  A bit more soft-spoken
than we usually think of for Richard, he nonetheless makes a chilling
and wonderfully vicious Fascist dictator.  Americans Annette Benning
and Robert Downey, Jr., at first may seem odd choices for Elizabeth and
her brother the Earl Rivers, but a 1930s King of England might well
have married an American and for once it might be perfectly reasonable
to cast Americans in Richard III.  The major roles are nearly all
played by familiar and respected British actors.  If Downey plays his
fey playboy a little too broadly there is the marvelous casting of
Adrian Dunbar, formerly cast as sweet and callow in HEAR MY SONG, here
as the amoral assassin Tyrell.</P>
<P>     Stylistically the film has some terrific moments, oozing period
feel.  Richard's political rally seems to come from somewhere between
Nazi Germany and Ruritania with its boar's head party symbol.  Great
art deco buildings, stylish royal residences and sterile hospital
hallways form the setting.  The battle scenes are unexpectedly violent
but also unrealistically brief.  Richard's army seems much too easily
beaten at the end of the film.  The final minute of the film is perhaps
the worst stylistic misstep of the film leaving the viewer with a
slightly bad taste in his mouth.  The only other real problem with the
style is that the invented setting is so compelling and has such a
powerful effect on the thrust of the film that the staging threatens to
overshadow even Shakespeare's writing.  Considering the wit of the
writing, that says a great deal.</P>
<P>     While I enjoyed the warm Tuscan feel of Kenneth Branagh's MUCH ADO
ABOUT NOTHING, it just never was as riveting this amazing production of
RICHARD III.  It may end a minority opinion but this exciting
adaptation was for me the better of the two films and I rate this film
a +3 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
