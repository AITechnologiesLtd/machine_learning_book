<PRE>                             THE MINUS MAN
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     I'm still trying to figure out how to look at THE MINUS MAN.
Either it's supposed to be a dark, black comedy, or it's supposed to be
a thoughtful, pensive drama/thriller a la SLING BLADE.</P>
<PRE>     Either way, it's a dismal failure.</PRE>
<P>     And it has so much going for it.  Owen Wilson, who was so great in
films like BOTTLE ROCKET.  Janeane Garofalo, who I like pretty much
universally.  Hampton Fancher, who adapted the screenplay for BLADE
RUNNER.  What's not to like?</P>
<PRE>     Turns out: Everything.</PRE>
<P>     THE MINUS MAN takes as its premise that your average,
thirtysomething, white male is the most likely serial killer around.
Vann (Wilson) fits the profile perfectly, a quiet, blonde, super-polite
drifter who poisons people at random.  The town of Owensville is no
different, as Vann randomly offs people, narrating to himself along the
way along with two imaginary cops.</P>
<P>     There's a romance of sorts, with Garofalo as a postal worker
smitten with Vann, and her screen time turns out to be the only stuff
worth watching.  The rest of the film is interminable, boring, and
ultimately plotless, meandering from scene to scene with no discernable
direction.  Frankly, I gave up on THE MINUS MAN after 30 minutes.
Turned out there were 90 more to go.</P>
<P>     I don't know what the ultimate point of this film was supposed to
be.  That there are crazy people all around?  That life and film can
ultimately lack meaning?  That rock stars (Crow) can do whatever they
want?  That once-great actors and writers can produce junk now and
again?</P>
<PRE>     Methinks it's the lattermost.</PRE>
