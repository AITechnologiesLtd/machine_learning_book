<PRE>                             TRIUMPH OF THE WILL
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1995 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ****</PRE>
<PRE>       He who does not really know the devil, can not
     defeat him.  Ostrich like ignorance provides no power.
     Only those who understand at a deep level the evil
     they are dealing have any hope of victory.  Remember,
     a devil to you, may be viewed by others as their salvation.</PRE>

<P>     Leni Riefenstahl's most remembered and most vilified film is
TRIUMPH OF THE WILL.  It is a documentary of the 1935 Nazi party
congress.  It has been called the most effective propaganda film of all
time.  It is now playing in revival at some of the art house around the
US, and it is available on video.</P>
<P>     I found the movie to be a religious film, and, in fact, Hitler
himself talks about National Socialism as being the equivalent of a
religious order.  It has some of the same feel of the movies about
religious cults except this time it is a true life cult, and these are
not actors.  Another difference is that cults usually harm only
themselves whereas as this one caused the death of tens of millions of
people.</P>
<P>     Make no mistake about it, the people in this film were worshipping
someone they thought was their messiah.  Leni captures this with
chilling accuracy.  Her fault, if one wants to ascribe fault, is that
she was so good at it.</P>
<P>     The print I saw was in poor quality.  I once saw parts of a video
of this movie that was in much worse shape.  Nevertheless, you could
see the zealotry and feel the intense emotions.  It is easy to dismiss
all of this with - well, I would never have been a Nazi.</P>
<P>     Watching the expressions of the people there, you could see how
many of them did believe that National Socialism was their future and
Hitler was their salvation.  Hitler could really fire up their
passions.  He made you feel that the government can do everything for
you, and socialism is the only answer.  Sure there were some bad eggs
he said, but he had gotten rid of them.  All very scary stuff.</P>
<P>     You could easily close you ears and just watch the master of
Leni's camerawork.  If you are careful you can even see one of her many
cameras going up in an elevator.  Opening back up your ears, you get
the music and sound that evoke the power of the this self-proclaimed
"master race".  Interestingly, of the many speakers, with the exception
of Hitler and a few others, most of the leaders were crude and coarse
looking.  Leni has them looking like that just finished a big meal at
the local beer hall and you are waiting for the big burp into the
camera.</P>
<P>     If you have any doubts that this is a religious picture, wait for
the scene where Hitler goes on a long slow walk through 200,000 party
members standing in attention.  He and two of his aids walk down a wide
road and at the end they pay homage to the party martyrs.  It is
clearly evocative of Moses parting the Red Sea and leading his people
across toward the promised land.</P>
<P>     When you leave the theater, you know you have seen the power of
true evil, and as the quote at the start said, knowledge of evil is a
precondition to its defeat.  For this reason and for the brilliance of
the film making, I recommend this to everyone old enough to truly
understand the difference between good and evil.  It has no MPAA
rating.  It is clearly a **** show.  TRIUMPH OF THE WILL runs 1:54, has
some spoken German in it along with English subtitles, but it is
essentially a montage of extremely effective imagery.</P>
<P>     Finally, anyone interest in Leni should be sure to see the recent
documentary THE WONDERFUL, HORRIBLE LIFE OF LENI RIEFENSTAHL about her
life and her films.  It is absolutely fascinating.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
