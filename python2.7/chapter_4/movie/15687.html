Dustin Putman's Film Reviews</A> ></P>
<P>Like Jim Varney in the "Ernest" movies, Adam Sandler has made his living 
almost consistently playing a dim-witted doofus, as in 1995's 
embarrassing, "Billy Madison" and 1996's slight, but funny, "Happy 
Gilmore." This all changed, however, this past February, with the 
release of his first great film, "The Wedding Singer," in which Sandler, 
for once, actually had a normal character to play, but proved that he 
could still be funny. Going into Sandler's latest picture, "The 
Waterboy," I was optimistic since it was written by Tim Herlihy and 
directed by Frank Coraci, the same people who worked on "The Wedding 
Singer." The fact that that film was good only makes "The Waterboy," an 
even more diappointing follow-up. Sandler has sadly gone back into his 
"idiot" mode, and gone, also, is any real hints of charm or wit.</P>
<P>Sandler plays Bobby Boucher, a constantly made fun of 31-year-old 
waterboy for a small-town Louisiana football team, who, in the opening 
scene, is fired by the hateful coach (Jerry Reed). Bobby still lives 
with his overprotective, but loving Cajun mama (Kathy Bates), who 
constantly warns him of women, who, she says, are the "devil." Although 
she desperately wants Bobby to stay with her all day and keep her 
company, he goes behind her back and becomes the waterboy for another 
football team, headed by distraught Coach Klein (Henry Winkler), and 
after defending himself by tackling one of the players, he is actually 
offered a spot on the team, and a chance to go to college. </P>
<P>One of the surprises about, "The Waterboy," is that it isn't very funny. 
The typical sports stuff has been overdone to death, and is now just 
boring. And to top it all off, it inevitably ends with "the big game," 
and if you have an IQ north of 20, I'm sure you can guess how it all 
turns out. Since all of the football material was dead-in-the-water, it 
should have been scrapped, instead, focusing on Bobby's relationship 
with the only two interesting characters in the film, his mother (played 
effervescently by Bates) and his potential girlfriend, bad-girl Vicki 
Vallencourt (Fairuza Balk). Balk, who I have always liked, is 
wonderfully likable and surprisingly funny, so much so that it's 
unfortunate she wasn't given more screen time. It is these two fine 
performances that save, 'The Waterboy," from being a complete misfire.</P>
<P>The material in "The Waterboy" is so cliched and recycled that I wonder 
why Sandler, Coraci, and Herlihy decided to make this after the huge 
success of, "The Wedding Singer." They should have known this was a big
step down for all involved. They should have known that Sandler was 
much better off actually having a realistic character to play, and they 
also should have known that sports-type movies have been way overdone. 
"The Waterboy," is the type of film that must have been made for 
8-year-olds. It is sophomoric, and it is dumb. </P>
