Susan Granger's review of "SLC Punk!" (Sony Pictures Classics)</PRE>
<P>          If you're interested in this satirical film about teenage
defiance, you'd better plan to see it quick because, when I went to
the theater, there were exactly three people in the audience!
Writer/director James Merendino chronicles the early '80s
transformation of Stevo - played by Matthew Lillard ("Wing Commander")
- from a Dungeons and Dragons geek and academic genius to a hard-core,
blue-haired punk, whose ambition in college is to get "a 4.0 in
damage," rather than to follow his former hippie father's example and
go to Harvard Law School. Set in suburban, Mormon-colonized Salt Lake
City, Utah, the chaotic - obviously loosely autobiographical - story
is hard to follow at times but that seems to be the object of
Merendino's hyperactive style. After all, as Stevo explains at length,
the anarchic spirit is the essence of the punk movement. There's much
more talk than action. In fact, there's more talk than even the most
dedicated movie-goer can sit through comfortably. Long, tiresome, and
repetitious talk. As colorful co-starring characters, Michael
A. Goorjean plays Heroin Bob, who boasts an anti-drug attitude and an
aversion to needles; Til Schweiger is the quick-tempered braggart of
the group who has converted his home into an electronics warehouse,
courtesy of a generous settlement from his parents' plane crash; and
Annabeth Gish is the head shop owner whose hair color changes with
each scene.  On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "SLC Punk" is a
floundering 4 - unless you're really into an aimlessly twisted parody
on the punk side.</P>
