<PRE>THE SIXTH SENSE
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        The opening, very deliberate minutes of "The Sixth Sense," Bruce
Willis' latest retread, sets up the oft-seen
marital-celebration-interrupted-by-dangerous-threat situation, in which
child psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Willis) and his wife Anna ("Rushmore"'s
pretty but here pretty ineffective Olivia Williams) are toasting their
success.  Buzzed on red wine, the couple are admiring a plaque presented to
Crowe by the mayor of Philadelphia when suddenly there's a crash in their
bathroom.  The frightened couple investigates to find a scary-looking man
standing there dressed only in a pair of dirty y-fronts, very uninvited and
very upset.</P>
<P>        For a moment I was reminded of a Michael Winner horror film from
the mid-'70s called "The Sentinel" in which Christina Raines' father
appears also uninvited in her bedroom looking just like that, right before
Christina slices off his nose with a kitchen knife.</P>
<P>        In Philadelphia's own M. Night Shyamalan's psychological drama,
Willis confronts the intruder a little less violently, but it soon becomes
clear from the man's rantings that this is a former patient of Crowe's
who's not very satisfied with his treatment.  Crowe thinks he can end this
standoff without bloodshed, but the crazy is having none of it and pulls a
gun and shoots Crowe in the stomach before taking his own life.  Crowe is
left, quite literally, with blood on his hands.</P>
<PRE>        Bummer.</PRE>
<P>        Referred to by appreciative city officials as one of
"Philadelphia's sons," Crowe is assigned to monitor an eight-year-old boy
who, his crib notes tell him, has divorced parents and suffers from acute
anxiety.  Cole (convincingly portrayed by Haley Joel Osment) has a history
of emotional problems, as well as some physical scarring, and Crowe sets
out to try and help the boy.  Oh, and Cole claims he can see dead people
too.</P>
<PRE>        1. Sight.  2. Sound.  3. Smell.  4. Taste.  5. Touch.  6.
Interacting with the Deceased?  It just doesn't have the same ring.</PRE>
<PRE>        Which reminds me of something else I remember from "The Sentinel."</PRE>
<P>        Since that film, with its all-star cast, had difficulty in making
its paranormal horror credible, it threw in a number of gross-out scenes to
try and compensate.  And that's exactly what proves to be "The Sixth
Sense"'s undoing.</P>
<P>        My "favorite" scene in the film comes when Cole is once again
hiding in his tent, shining a flashlight under his chin for the best
possible horrific effect, and the camera suddenly pans to the right to
reveal a pale young girl with bloodshot eyes who vomits up her morning
oatmeal.  Why worry about all that thoughtful, serious psychological stuff
when you can cheat your audience with cheap shock scenes like that.</P>
<P>        Toni Collette ("Muriel's Wedding") plays Cole's hardworking South
Philadelphian mother and, alongside Osment, she's the best thing in the
picture.  Collette can't quite manage a "sarf filly" accent, but her
look--from her floozy attire to her garish fingernails--is spot on.  After
many long, uninvolving scenes of Crowe trying to bond with the child
punctuated by all those unwelcome scare tactics, Crowe finally tells Cole
to confront his fears rather than be afraid of them, and Shyamalan wraps
this rather obvious medical advice up with a nicely-loaded metaphor (Cole
plays Arthur in his school's adaptation of "The Sword in the Stone").  That
happens right before the film's spurious "gotcha!" ending.</P>
<P>        Willis is no Olivier, but he's often fun to watch.  Unfortunately,
most of "The Sixth Sense" isn't.  Even with its potentially interesting
supernatural bent, it's still largely schlock footage.</P>
