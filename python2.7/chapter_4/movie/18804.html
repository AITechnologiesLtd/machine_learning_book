<P>        The Dreamlife of Angels features two masterful central performances. 
The first comes from Elodie Bouchez, who plays Isa, a young and friendly
drifter who can't keep a job.  The other performance is by Natacha
Regnier, playing Marie, a slightly more-stable woman who befriends Isa. 
The film centers around the relationship between the two women, and also
their individual struggles; Marie becomes obsessed with a womanizer
(Patrick Mercado), while Isa becomes strangely attached to a young girl
in a coma.  With a strong sense of artistic ambition from director Erick
Zonca, The Dreamlife of Angels is an affecting and sharply realistic
look at two pathetic lives.  My only real complaint is that the movie
comes to a screeching halt in the last twenty minutes, and then putters
to a denouement that comes dangerously close to anti-climax.  Overall,
the picture serves best as a showcase for two amazing young actresses.</P>
