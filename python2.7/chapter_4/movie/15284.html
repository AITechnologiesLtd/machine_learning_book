A Movie Review by David Sunga </PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Frank Coraci</PRE>
<P>Written by: Tim Herlihy and Adam Sandler</P>
<P>Starring: Adam Sandler, Henry Winkler, Kathy Bates, Fairuza Balk</P>
<P>Ingredients: 31-year-old Louisiana bayou mama's boy, football </P>
<P>Synopsis: 
In HAPPY GILMORE (1996) written by Tim Herlihy and Adam Sandler, Adam
Sandler plays a loser raised by his loving grandmother, who learns to
channel his aggression into golfing prowess, and becomes an instant
sensation. The subplot involved a love interest and a big important
game. </P>
<P>In THE WATERBOY (1998) written by Tim Herlihy and Adam Sandler, Adam
Sandler plays a loser named Bobby, raised by his loving mother, who
learns to channel his aggression into football prowess, and becomes an
instant sensation. The subplot involved a love interest and a big
important game.</P>
<P>Opinion: 
Call it the Forrest Gump factor. Underdog Bobby Boucher has a
prounounced southern accent and the formidable intelligence quotient of
a box turtle, but he also possesses a kind heart and a steadfast
devotion to Mama (Kathy Bates, parodying a hillbilly). Of course, Bobby
the Kindhearted makes it to the big time, has a crisis of confidence,
and plays a high stakes finale. Sure, THE WATERBOY is as original as
ROCKY V, and annoyingly predictable, but we're suckers when it comes to
rooting for the underdog till we get sick of the sequels.</P>
