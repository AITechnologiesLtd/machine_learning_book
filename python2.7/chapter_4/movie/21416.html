<PRE>BRINGING OUT THE DEAD
Directed by Martin Scorsese
Screenplay by Paul Schrader from Joe Connelly's novel
With Nicolas Cage, Patricia Arquette
De Vargas    R     118 min</PRE>
<P>     The title of Martin Scorsese's new movie (adapted by Paul Schrader
from the bestseller by former paramedic Joe Connelly) reflects the grisly
cry of corpse-collectors in plague-stricken 18th century London: "Bring out
your dead!"  The New York City Scorsese shows us at the end of the 20th
century is gripped by no less deadly a plague; it is a nightmare world
crushed under an epidemic of drugs, violence, and indifference.</P>
<P>Scorsese is perhaps the most revered living American director, admired
by peers and critics for his mastery of the language of film.  And yet he
is a director with a deep and abiding propensity to disappoint.  In
"Bringing Out the Dead" he disappoints again, with a movie that lacks
narrative drive and coherence, but that still manages to pack plenty of
virtuoso filmmaking into its two hours.</P>
<P>At the center of things is Frank Pierce, a paramedic at the end of his
skein, played by Nicolas Cage in a stunned, anguished trance.  Pale of skin
and dark of eye, he looks as if he's been made up for a Tim Burton movie. 
Frank drives an ambulance through the streets of New York accompanied by a
series of partners, listening to emergency radio dispatches broadcast as
Altmanesque asides ("A woman has gone into cardiac arrest because a roach
has crawled in her ear and she can't get it out") and sometimes responding
to them.  </P>
<P>The action (you couldn't call it story) covers three nights in Frank's
disintegrating life.  On the first, he's called to try to revive a man
who's had a heart attack, and manages to get a heartbeat again after the
man's been dead for 20 minutes.  He's ambivalent about this ("I've come to
believe in spirits leaving the body and not wanting to come back"), but
he's been on a losing streak, hasn't saved a life in months, and then
there's the man's daughter (Patricia Arquette), who seems to light some
extinguished fire deep in Frank's spiritual wasteland.  </P>
<P>Arquette is bland, and Cage's mumbling, stumbling performance
(occasionally leavened by bursts of manic energy) is drawn from the actor's
increasingly familiar and finite bag of tricks.  The performances that give
this film life come from his three partners, John Goodman, Tom Sizemore,
and especially Ving Rhames.  There's also a wonderfully sinister velvet
turn from New Zealander Cliff Curtis ("Three Kings") as an upscale drug
dealer, and Mary Beth Hurt is memorable as a tough-talking ER nurse ("I
don't see why we should help you -- did we shove the heroin up your nose?")</P>
<P>Scorsese dazzles with some breathtaking visuals and powerful scenes,
but the movie has an unfocused, rambling feel that reaches several climaxes
of ennui before it plays itself out.</P>
