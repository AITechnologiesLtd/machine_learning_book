<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<PRE>     "All the world's a stage
      And all the men and women merely players
      They have their exits and their entrances
      And one man in his time plays many parts" 
          - excerpt from As You Like It, Act II, Scene 7</PRE>
<P>   When William Shakespeare penned this passage, he could not have
   possibly envisioned a world in which the domestic activites in an
   abode would be broadcast across the continent, or where women would
   install webcams in their apartments in order to convert voyeurism
   into cash.  This is the world of today, and it is the perfect climate
   to unveil a prototypical high-concept project like THE TRUMAN SHOW.</P>
<P>   Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) seems to have the perfect life.  He has a
   pretty, doting wife Meryl (Laura Linney), a comfortable insurance
   sales position, an immaculate suburban home in the idyllic island
   community of Seahaven, a reliable childhood buddy Marlon (Noah
   Emmerich) -- except for the dog that paws a greeting to him every
   morning and his hydrophobia, this is paradise.</P>
<P>   Or so it would seem.  Bizarre, inexplicable incidents begin to crop
   up in Truman's life.  A lighting fixture unexpectedly plummets from
   the sky.  A rainstorm which gives new meaning to the term 'isolated'
   follows him around.  A radio broadcast appears to be describing his
   every move.  For the first time in his life, it is beginning to dawn
   on Truman that things are not what they appear to be.</P>
<P>   THE TRUMAN SHOW, directed by Peter Weir and written by Andrew Niccol,
   is a remarkably well-constructed film, paced perfectly with every
   scene fluidly leading into the next.  Balancing drama with humour,
   thoughtfulness with abandon, this is a film which addresses an
   intriguing and intricate concept with just the right mixture of
   sermonizing and whimsical fancy.  In many ways, Mr. Niccol's
   screenplay mirrors the spirit of his previous GATTACA -- both films
   focus on the theme of triumph of the human spirit over oppressive
   adversity, with pivotal, character-defining moments occurring at sea.</P>
<P>   Although the film's rather conventional climax doesn't sustain the
   inspired dynamic achieved in the first two-thirds, and ultimately
   just falls short on delivering the intended emotional punch, there
   are moments through THE TRUMAN SHOW which are genuinely stirring and
   moving as Truman attempts to make sense of his unraveling world and
   grasp the implications behind his discoveries of deception.</P>
<P>   Despite the multitude of pertinent issues being broached by the film,
   it remains foremost a finely-crafted piece of entertainment,
   constantly light and accessible.  The tone achieved is far too sunny
   for any sense of fearful paranoia to legitimately intrude, and as the
   carefully-stacked Seahaven house of cards tumbles down, the film
   eschews any psychological ramifications for a man discovering that
   the fundamentals of his entire existence have been false.  The end
   act of THE TRUMAN SHOW essentially boils down to a rehash of the
   reliable, crowdpleasing Underdog Vs. The System formula.</P>
<P>   While the film is an impressive realisation of an inspired concept,
   some elements are lacking.  The device of mysterious Lauren/Sylvia
   (Natascha McElhone) as a contributing impetus to Truman's growing
   awareness isn't exactly convincing.  There's not much of a
   discernable spark between either the two characters or the actors
   themselves, and the scenes in which she indignantly confronts the
   megalomaniac Christoff (Ed Harris) with regards to the moral
   ambiguity of his actions unnecessarily spells things out for the
   audience, thankfully avoided elsewhere in the film.</P>
<P>   In fact, although the film smartly restricts the number of scenes
   depicting the real world outside Truman's artificial utopia to a mere
   handful of select reaction shots from enraptured gazers, it might
   have perhaps been even more indicting and damning to immerse itself
   even *more* deeply in the insulatory Seahaven world, with the
   resultant effect that the repercussions felt as the film finally
   shifts outside the imposed bubble are all the more startling.  Still,
   the scathing commentary issued by this film is on target, and its
   insidiously oblique manner of delivery is far more effective in
   conveying the message than the more forthright anti-voyeuristic
   tirades such as that of the recent Costa Gavras film MAD CITY.</P>
<P>   I've always believed that the versatile Ms. Linney possesses a
   tremendous comic gift -- she has always seems to have a impish gleam
   in her eyes -- and in THE TRUMAN SHOW she runs rampant with her
   duplicitous character, mischievously flashing a glazed, insanely
   jovial grin as she perkily recites impromptu product placement
   slogans.  Cheerfully going over the top, it's hilarious to watch her
   -- who would have ever guessed that she'd have the opportunity to
   outshine the reigning King Of Comedy in the laughs department of a
   film?  Ms. Linney is a delight in the film.</P>
<P>   But it is Mr. Carrey who rules the show here.  He may not have been
   intuitively the most obvious choice to portray underdog hero Truman
   Burbank -- the role is seriously lacking in any of the frenetic comic
   interludes which typify his traditional parts -- but he brings to the
   character tremendous energy and eminent appeal: it's difficult not to
   root for Truman.  In a commanding performance, Mr. Carrey lends our
   protagonist an inherent sense of decency and integrity which makes
   him a genuinely engaging presence, and acquits himself impressively
   in this dramatic turn, demonstrating admirable restraint -- there's
   an early scene where he's down on his knees gardening, and given his
   past track record, one almost instinctively anticipates Mr. Carrey to
   pull one of more infamous, and in this case, wholly inappropriate
   sight gags.  It's almost poetic how this notorious look-at-me actor
   successfully tones it down to play a character who's constantly the
   centre of attention.</P>
<P>   In addition to the fine performances by the bulk of the cast -- Mr.
   Emmerich is particularly noteworthy for issuing his character a sense
   of sturdy trustworthiness -- the film is immeasurably aided by
   wonderful production design by Dennis Gassner in creating Truman's
   antiseptic, white picket-fenced smalltown utopia, and by Burkhard
   Dallwitz's original score.  Technical credits are first-rate all
   around.</P>
<P>   While THE TRUMAN SHOW is clearly a definitive high-concept film, it's
   not exactly a dazzlingly innovative one -- obvious predecessors
   utilising common elements abound, ranging from 1965's SECRET AGENT
   through to the groundbreaking British 1967 TV series THE PRISONER.
   All the same, this is a visionary, award-calibre film: entertaining,
   provocative, and intelligent.</P>
<P>   The curious (and possibly disturbing) thing may be that although upon
   first glance the plausibility of the film's concept seems
   unfathomably outrageous, it's abundantly clear that our society is
   rapidly approaching, if not actualisation, at least permissiveness of
   such a scenario.  Perhaps the highest compliment which can be paid to
   Mr. Weir is that his depiction of this bizarro state is so convincing
   that we accept it without question.  Perhaps we recognize a bit of
   ourselves in this world.</P>
