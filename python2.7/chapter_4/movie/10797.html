<PRE>GREAT EXPECTATIONS
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>I'll be the first to admit it.  When you mention the book Great
Expectations, I immediately begin experiencing flashbacks to junior high
English class, where I was confronted with a torturously boring book
filled with people with such nonsensical names as Pip and Magwitch.
Yes, it's a classic of literature, but it was a rather dry one, shoved
down my young throat like a spoonful of bitter medicine. Certainly, the
experience wasn't truly that bad, but, to quote Ethan Hawke in the
latest movie adaptation of said book, "I'm not going to tell the story
the way it happened...I'll gonna tell it the way I remember it." Anyway,
to return from nostalgia lane, and get back to the present, Hollywood,
in it's trendy attempt to modernize the classics, now presents an
updated film version of Great Expectations.</P>
<P>Instead of Pip, this time the central character is named Finn (played as
a boy by Jeremy Kissner, and by Ethan Hawke as an adult).  Finn is an
orphan being raised by his unfaithful sister Maggie, or should that be
Mrs. Joe, (Kim Dickens), and her boorish fisherman husband, Joe (Chris
Cooper).  The setting is the Florida coast during the mid-70s.  Finn is
a blooming artist, and spends his time running around the beach drawing
fish (one of his two favorite subjects).</P>
<P>During one of these escapades, he literally stumbles upon an escaped
criminal (Robert DeNiro). Borrowing a page from the superhuman Max Cady,
DeNiro's criminal has a seemingly limitless lung capacity, and favors
hiding on the ocean floor.  OK...maybe that's an exaggeration, but he
certainly beats any of Houdini's records in the opening scenes of the
film.  And that's nothing next to the fuel efficiency of Finn's
motorboat, but I digress.  Anyway, Finn does the convict a good deed,
just to show that he's a really swell guy. And then the plot moves on.</P>
<P>Enter Miss Havisham...or Ms. Dinsmoor here (Anne Bancroft).  Abandoned
at the altar some 26 years ago, Ms. Dinsmoor is the epitome of the crazy
rich old maid. With bizarre clothing, eccentric mannerisms and a few
pounds of makeup, Anne Bancroft seriously overacts in this role.
Although she ends up nowhere near a believable character, she does add
some humor to the film. Joe is hired to help with the gardening at her
unkempt manner, but the insane Ms. Dinsmoor soon hires Finn to be a
plaything for her niece, Estella (Raquel Beaudene as a young girl,
Gwyneth Paltrow as an adult).</P>
<P>For no apparent reason, other than to provide the main plot of the film,
Finn is instantly stricken for the Estella.  Perhaps it's her snooty
attitude or her utter disdain for his person, or maybe Finn has simply
never met a girl before. In any case, neither as children nor adults,
chemistry simply doesn't exist between the two, and yet Finn spends the
remainder of the film pining for her.</P>
<P>Even when, as an adult, Finn arrives in New York at the behest of a
mysterious benefactor, reacquaints himself with Estella, and draws her
portrait in the nude, there's nothing.  In fact, there is more sexual
tension between Helen Hunt and  Greg Kinnear's gay artist during a
similar scene in As Good As It Gets. At this point, the audience has
grown as cold and detached as Estella's character, and couldn't care
less about the two characters.</P>
<P>The bulk of the blame here falls upon Gwyneth Paltrow.  She fails to
imbue Estella, a remote character in the book, with even the vaguest
traces of humanity.  There's obviously something wrong when, watching
the film, you're more interested with how big her nose looks in
silhouette than you are about her character. Without a strong Estella,
Finn's obsession seems baseless. You wish he would just stop whining,
let Estella marry his rival, Walter Plane (an oddly subdued Hank
Azaria), and just get on with his life.</P>
<P>In fact, the two relationships that work in the film are purely
tangential to the main plot.  Finn's relationship with his
brother-in-law, Joe, is interesting, if a bit stereotypical.  What's
more fascinating are his interactions with DeNiro.  Although it's only a
bit part, it goes to show how much vitality a strong actor can create.</P>
<P>It is apparent that director Alfonso Cuarsn put a lot of work in
creating the imagery of the film.  Some of the shots work, but others
are too obviously staged (for example, both of the water fountain
scenes) to have any impact.  Finn's art (actually the creations of
Italian painter, Francesco Clemente) is used throughout the film, but it
mostly fails to have the intended effect.  We never see why Finn would
generate this style of art, which is simultaneously crude and
insightful.  As a result, it ends up as distant as the rest of the film.</P>
<P>Modernizing the classics is currently in vogue (just see William
Shakespeare's Romeo+Juliet).  Simply update the action to a modern
setting, and apply plenty of modern rock.  But such adornments do little
to perk up Great Expectations.  As much as I dreaded the novel when I
first read it, you'd probably be better off suffering though a reading
than watching this romanceless film.</P>
