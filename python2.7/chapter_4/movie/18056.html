<P>   One way that critics' opinions of movies often differ from
those of fans is that regular folks are often content with
excitement and romance while reviewers are obsessed with
originality and believability.  "Entrapment" has been getting
mixed notices, with many critics complaining that little is
credible, while vast crowds of moviegoers credit the film for
its style.  Surprisingly, Roger Ebert goes along with the latter
group, saying in his review that though "Entrapment" has a
"preposterous plot [there is] so much chemistry between
attractive actors that we don't care....I didn't believe a second
of it, and I didn't care that I didn't."  The Great Man is on the
money this time: "Entrapment," which recalls stylish vehicles
like "Topkapi" and "To Catch a Thief," is neither original nor
plausible, but then, is anything done by the successful James
Bond series feasible?  Logical action is not the point with
such a genre.  Technique is everything, and this movie is
adept in various spheres.  Note Phil Meheux's startling
photography (especially the night scenes and the vista that
contrasts a dirt-poor Malaysian neighborhood with the high-
rise palaces of Kuala Lumpur's business sector).  Let the
special chemistry between its two principal performers
register: director John Amiel will have you wondering whether
the 69-year-old Sean Connery's attention to the 29-year-old
Catherine Zeta-Jones is sexual or paternal.</P>
<P>   Sean Connery (who could still play Bond, for my money)
takes on the role of Mac, a wealthy thief who now steals not
for the money but for the excitement.  With a particular
expertise in making off with the works of the masters in art
museums, he turns his skills to stealing a Chinese mask. 
When Gin (Catherine Zeta-Jones), an insurance investigator,
seeks to entrap him by tempting him to take on a daring
assignment, Mac at first does not trust her but agrees to
make her a partner in the theft of a $40 million Chinese mask
on exhibit in Scotland.  With his partner Thibadeaux (Ving
Rhames), he is later to move on to the attempt the biggest
haul in history: the lifting of eight billion dollars in corporate
deposits, while Gin's boss, Hector Cruz (Will Patton) ventures
to capture him.</P>
<P>   If you're wondering why Ms. Zeta-Jones is depicted in an
acrobatic pose in the posters, the posture is not simply an
attention getter to entrap prospective viewers.  While entering
a museum, cat-like to avoid invisible laser beams seen only
by Mac with a special instrument, Gin must bend and twist
her curvaceous body lest a misstep of an inch set off alarms
and foil the theft.  </P>
<P>   "Entrapment" engulfs the viewer in both its focus on the
two attractive actors and in its photography of a series of
capers including one in which Mac dangles from a 70-story
building while opening a security system.  While younger fans
(the movie is rated PG-13 because of its relative absence of
violence) will be absorbed in the impressive stunt work, those
of a romantic bent will be fascinated particularly by Catherine
Zeta-Jones, who is not simply a knockout in the looks
department but has smarts and spark to match.  </P>
<P>   Though "Entrapment" recycles some of the classics--its
many clever twists conforming to the usual Hollywood
playing-by-the-numbers--its exotic locales, clever repartee
between actors of different generations, and breathtaking
stunts give "Entrapment" a handsome look, a mischievous
bearing, and a good time for its patrons.</P>
<PRE>Rated PG-13.  Running Time: 113 minutes.  (C) 1999
