<P>Susan Granger's review of "MAN ON THE MOON" (Universal Pictures)</P>
<P>  Don't miss the beginning - it's the most imaginative and
hilarious part. Facing the camera, Jim Carrey establishes immediately
that he's completely captured the eye-bulging essence of the late
comedian Andy Kaufman. His impersonation is nothing short of
brilliant, even Oscar-worthy. That having been acknowledged, the movie
itself leaves a lot to be desired. First, it's not really a
movie. It's simply the embodiment of an objectionable character whom
people either adored or loathed. Director Milos Foreman and
screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, the trio who did
The People vs. Larry Flynt, don't attempt an analysis or even offer
psychological insight into the complex, enigmatic nature of this
definitely unhinged, obviously neurotic, and perhaps psychotic
performer. Instead, we simply watch his progress from comedy clubs,
like the Improv, to Saturday Night Live, to TV's Taxi along with his
relentless self-destruction, aided and abetted by his writer/sidekick
Bob Zmuda (Paul Giamatti). Danny DeVito's superb as his agent,
observing: "You're insane - but you might also be brilliant." Kaufman
meets his girlfriend (Courtney Love) in a wrestling challenge but she
too is a cipher. They have only one revelatory moment together when he
whines, "You don't know the real me." And she replies, "There isn't a
real you." And then, at age 35, cancer strikes. On the Granger Movie
Gauge of 1 to 10, Man on the Moon is a strange, shallow 6. Who was
this Andy Kaufman - and why did he love to provoke people? That's
never answered in this uneven, two-hour compilation of comedy
shtick. Even DeVito asks, "What's the point?"</P>
