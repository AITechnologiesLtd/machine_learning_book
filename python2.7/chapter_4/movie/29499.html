<PRE>PLANET OF THE APES (1968)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2001</PRE>
<P>The author of this review has rarely greeted a film with
higher expectation than in the case of original PLANET OF
THE APES. I have been hearing great things about the film
decades before being able to see it for the first time. My
expectations weren't discouraged by the fact that I was able
to see the important Final Scene or with the utter
disappointment in the form of 1970s TV series. When I
finally watched the film for the first time, I was
nevertheless forced to admit that PLANET OF THE APES falls
deep bellow my expectations. Afterwards, when I had the
opportunity to watch the film for the second or third time,
or had the misfortune to watch some of the four sequels, I
managed to have my opinion about the film improved, although
not very much.</P>
<P>The plot of the film is based on the novel by French author
Pierre Boulle who had been fortunate enough to have his
previous work, BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, turned into one of
the greatest films of all times. In 1968 it seemed that this
happened for the second time - PLANET OF THE APES was the
first science fiction film to transcend the usual fan base
and become an interesting cultural phenomenon of its time.
Genre aficionados later never failed to mention this film as
one of the milestones in the history of science fiction
cinema. For them, THE PLANET OF THE APES is the film that
made an important leap from the realms of genre ghetto into
the world of mainstream cinema, mostly due to employing the
previously escapist genre to talk about important issues of
its time and thus paving the way for the intelligent and
socially conscious brand of science fiction cinema that
would dominate Hollywood until the arrival of Spielberg and
Lucas.</P>
<P>Genre credentials were given to the film by Rod Serling,
famous creator of THE TWILIGHT ZONE, who paired up with
Michael Wilson, screenwriter previously targeted by 1950s
witch-hunts, who would contribute to the plot with his
experiences. The film begins in the U.S. spaceship that is
about to spend thousands of years travelling through space
until it finds a new solar system. The crew, led by Colonel
George Taylor (played by Charlton Heston), is going to spend
much of this time in hyper- sleep before it awakes and start
a new human civilisation on the new planet. The plan,
however, doesn't go as it should be - the only female part
of the crew has died during the travel, the spaceship
crashes into the lake, and Taylor, as well as two of his
companions - Landon (played by Robert Gunner) and Dodge
(played by Jeff Burton) - now must fight for survival on an
alien and presumably hostile planet. However, the crew soon
finds that the planet is populated by a race of humans who
appear to be mute and not very intelligent. It soon appears
that the humans are not the dominant species on the planets
- the real masters are the intelligent apes who hunt and
imprison them. Taylor is the only survivor of the raid, yet
he is shot in the throat and unable to speak when he is
being imprisoned. He is nevertheless peculiar enough to
arouse interest in the chimpanzee scientist Zira (played by
Kim Hunter), as well as her fiance, archaeologist dr.
Cornelius (played by Roddy McDowall). Their interest is
rewarded when Taylor finally manages to establish
communication. But for the authorities, embodied in the
powerful orangutan Dr. Zaius (played by Maurice Evans),
Taylor represents the threat to established order of the
apes' world and therefore has to be eliminated.</P>
<P>Original PLANET OF THE APES might be criticised for many
things, but hardly for not being an entertaining and
thought-provoking science fiction film. From strictly
technical standpoint, the film is more than adequate - the
action scenes are intense, while the architecture, clothes
and artefacts of the ape society still manage to create a
sense of wonder despite having recognisable human origin.
The apes are among the most convincing aliens in the history
of science fiction cinema and the "Oscar" for the make-up is
well deserved. Finally, Schaffner manages to establish the
pace of the movie, keeping it a short, yet giving it an epic
scope, thus giving the feel of "larger than life" film to
the PLANET OF THE APES.</P>
<P>However, the most important element of PLANET OF THE APES
comes in the context that is going to be missed by
contemporary audience. This film is undoubtedly a product of
its time. Created in 1968, one of the most turbulent years
of American history, PLANET OF THE APES was heavily
influenced by the conflicts that threatened to tear American
society apart and end the Western civilisation - the never
ending nightmare of Vietnam War, radicalisation of the race
issue in the era of civil rights and, finally, the
escalating struggle between the new progressive ideas of the
young and conservative order embodied in the old generation.
All those themes - racism, bigotry, and, more than anything
else, human ability to destroy the world - are present in
this film. The script goes even further than the most
radical filmmakers in the era when radicalism used to be the
norm and the sight of protagonist laughing at the sight of
U.S. flag was not the unforgivable atrocity as it is today
(even before WTC massacre, which gave whole new dimension to
the ideals of patriotism). For filmmakers, the mankind is
not only the victim, but also the cause of the evils in this
world. Screenplay cleverly brings this thesis in the
powerful finale, in which all tables are turned. The
protagonist, for whom we were supposed to root for, was
suffering terrible humiliation from the hands of racist and
bigot apes that are supposed to represent all the worst in
humanity. When he is finally free and unconstrained, he
shows his true nature by using violence in order to achieve
his ends, thus justifying his ape oppressors who saw him as
a dangerous freak. In view of this, even the powerful final
scene, which was supposed to clear this point, as not as
powerful as it should be and it could have remained on the
cutting room floor without damaging the film.</P>
<P>Because of this radical departure from dominant
anthropocentric point of view, PLANET OF THE APES was often
seen as one of the most important films in the history of
science fiction genre. However, because it approached the
issues seriously, it also required more scrutiny and this is
exactly the reason why it fails to reach criteria necessary
to be viewed as a truly grand film. While some corners might
be cut in a light-hearted fantasy like STAR WARS, the
"science" in the whole concept of "science fiction" prevents
us from having the proper suspension of disbelief necessary
to truly enjoy this film. There is simply too much of
implausibility for that, ranging from the fact that three
Adams and one Eve would be sent to start new Eden to the
obvious fact that the apes speak perfect English and
understand Latin alphabet, yet our hero still believes that
he is not on Earth. Because of this, what was supposed to be
one of the defining films of 20th Century can be seen as a
trash. This impression is enhanced by the presence of Linda
Harrison, whose character doesn't usher a word during the
whole film and whose acting ability is proportional to the
quantities of textile she is wearing. Her presence in the
film, although at times pleasing to the eyes of male
audience, is almost insulting in the same company with
talented actors like Heston, Kim Hunter, James Whitmore and
especially Roddy McDowall, whose role of Cornelius would
afterwards be one of the rare things worth watching in
sequels and subsequent TV series.</P>
<P>The first incarnation of PLANET OF THE APES is, regardless
of its apparent flaws, a very good film, that could be
enjoyed in appreciated even by those who might not see it
worthy of its cult status.</P>
