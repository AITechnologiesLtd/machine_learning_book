<P>Review by Lars Lindahl (<A HREF="mailto:larsattacks@mail.com">larsattacks@mail.com</A>)</P>
<PRE>"Hamlet" (2000) **1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Michael Almereyda
Written by MIchael Almereyda from William
Shakespeare's play</PRE>
<P>Starring Ethan Hawke, Julia Stiles, Bill Murray, Sam
Shephard, Kyle MacLachlan, Diane Venora, Liev
Schreiber, Steve Zahn, and Dechen Thurman. </P>
<P>There have been countless remakes of William
Shakespeare's most celebrated drama Hamlet. Everyone
from Laurence Olivier to Mel Gibson has stepped into
the shoes of the titular character with a fair amount
of success. Now indie writer/director Michael
Almereyda (Another Girl, Another Planet), with an all
star cast, has tried something a little bit different
with the bard's masterpiece. The ultimate question
facing Almereyda is whether this difference can
attract the same viewers who have seen the play filmed
to death. Is this play the thing? In many ways, yes.
The unique visual flare of the director and the
ability of making the story work in a time period it
doesn't belong are both reasons to see and enjoy this
film. However, many walls stand in the way of
perfection. </P>
<P>Meet the new Hamlet; a New Yorker, a loner, a hip
stylish artist in his twenties who has lived to see
the dropping ball introduce the year 2000. He has a
cell phone, a video camera, and a Blockbuster card and
he also has a lot on his mind. His father, the "king"
of the Denmark Corporation, died and his mother,
following the funeral, immediately married his uncle.
All of this seems fine until the ghost of Hamlet's
father visits him in his apartment and tells him that
something evil is going on. Poor, confused Hamlet now
doesn't know if he's just imagining the ghost, or if
his father was actually betrayed by his own greedy
brother. </P>
<P>Although not as witty or impressive as Baz Luhrmann's
similarly contemporary Romeo + Juliet, this remake
stands out for its overall cleverness in presentation.
Very dramatic with periods of laugh out loud humor,
Almereyda creates new meanings to words written
centuries ago. Some of the scenes will have you
wondering how the heck anyone could have thought of
something this original. Instead of a theatrical play
to determine whether Claudius is guilty or not, Hamlet
creates a short film entitled Mouse Trap with blatant
images of death, greed, and corruption. The short is
memorably funny and makes the film Hamlet much more
interesting. There are plenty of satisfying scenes
like this which liven up the movie but at some points,
it feels like Almereyda takes the easy way out. He
leaves out scenes (possibly because they are too
difficult to complete?) and he leaves out characters
(two talented actors - Jeffrey Wright and Casey
Affleck are in the movie for seconds as the
gravedigger and Fortinbras, a case of too much
editing). But there is more to like than to hate while
watching this movie and I guess that's a good thing.  </P>
<P>My major complaint is with Almereyda's obsessive use
of product placement. Sure, using real companies is
another clever way of reminding the audience that this
Hamlet is living in the same world as you are, but
eventually it becomes very distracting. For example,
Hamlet delivers the famous "To be or not to be" speech
inside a Blockbuster Video store. The speech is
extremely important in understanding exactly how
Hamlet is responding to the visits of the ghost or his
troubles with girlfriend Ophelia, but the whole time I
found myself uncontrollably spotting familiar video
boxes in the background or watching the television
behind Hamlet's head display previews of upcoming
releases. Not once did I look at Hawke and very few
times did I hear what he was saying. This happens
several times during the movie; by the end I really
wanted to rent a video, drink some Pepsi, shop at Key
Food, and call Movie-Fone.  If this adaptation is
paying tribute to Shakespeare's brilliant writing
skills by updating it, then why are there so many
visual distractions that detract the audience's
attention from the script? The visuals are stunning
and creative but the text is what has made Hamlet so
respected - what has inspired this film to be made in
the first place. </P>
<P>The cast left me with several mixed impressions.
Despite hearing that Hawke was a disappointment as
Hamlet, I found him to be very effective and
convincing. You could feel his pain each time he is
betrayed (which is about a billion times) and it is
very clear that as the film progresses, his character
becomes more and more doomed for tragedy. Julia
Stiles, as Hamlet's illicit lover Ophelia, is not as
successful in her performance. It seemed like her part
was much less important than in other versions, maybe
because Almereyda cut some scenes or because she put
very little life into her role. Either way, I felt
very little sympathy for her. Bill Murray is also a
bit of a disappointment. It felt like he was reading
off cue cards - he would pause after every sentence
and look off over the shoulder of his counterpart like
someone was feeding him words. The rest of the cast
positively contributed to the film: Sam Shephard was
brilliant as the ghost, Diane Venora and Kyle
MacLachlan ideal as the mischievous relatives Gertrude
and Claudius, and Liev Schreiber right on target
playing the vengeful Laertes. You have to give credit
to these actors no matter how they faired, these roles
were very difficult to master. Mixing old lingo with a
contemporary background is tough to do.</P>
<P>The most recent Hamlet to add to the voluminous
collection of Hamlet's is a near-hit. At some points
you will be shocked with entertainment and other
points frozen in boredom. Check it out for some decent
experimental filming and laugh at Bill Murray doing
Shakespeare. </P>
