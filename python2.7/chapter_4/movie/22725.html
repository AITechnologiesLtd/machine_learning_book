<PRE>Blazing Saddles (1974)</PRE>
<P>"Blazing Saddles" is probably not Mel Brook's best film (that's a
toss-up between "The Producers" and "Young Frankenstein"), but it is
easily his most consistently funny work. It would never be made today
and that statement is as much praise for this movie as it is an
indictment of the politically correct times in which we live.</P>
<P>Nowadays, when we have to refer to the "N-word" as, well, the N-word, I
find myself actually nostalgic for a time when a movie was confident
enough in its own sense of humor to throw around the N-word with such
gleeful abandon.  Brooks has enough faith in his audience to expect them
to be in on the joke, and thus understand that he is an
equal-opportunity offender.  </P>
<P>This is a film based squarely on the old Abbie Hoffman quote that
"sacred cows" make the tastiest hamburger, serving up a juicy slab of
USDA Grade A irreverence.  It assaults your sensibilities, yes, but it
does it with a wink and a smile.</P>
<P>Watch this film and try not to take it, or yourself, too seriously.</P>
