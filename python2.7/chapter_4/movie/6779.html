<PRE>                               ALBINO ALLIGATOR
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1997 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     One of a growing list of recent directorial debuts by actors,
ALBINO ALLIGATOR is Kevin Spacey's (Best Supporting Actor winner from
THE USUAL SUSPECTS) baby, and his film is probably the best of the lot. 
Because with this movie, Spacey proves that he can work just as well on
either side of the camera.</P>
<P>     A "box drama" of classic design, ALIBINO ALLIGATOR is a
psychological thriller set largely inside a New Orleans Prohibition-era
bar still open in the 1990's.  Dova (Matt Dillon), Milo (Gary Sinise),
and Law (William Fichtner) are criminals on the run.  After killing
three cops with their car, the trio holes up in Dino's Last Chance Bar
until things cool over, but the cops catch up with them soon enough.  A
game of cat-and-mouse hostage negotiation ensues, with Faye Dunaway,
Viggo Mortensen, Skeet Ulrich, John Spencer, & M. Emmet Walsh as the
victims, and Joe Mantegna as the head cop on the case.</P>
<P>     Christian Forte's script is top-notch, save for a few dialogue
relics leftover from the Prohibition era themselves (I've never actually
heard anyone refer to two dollars as "a deuce").  In fact, the script
does most of the real work in the picture, leaving Spacey plenty of time
to concentrate on building tension and experimenting with some cool
camera tricks, all without getting too heavy-handed with his direction. 
And having all his talented friends act in the principal parts doesn't
hurt, either.</P>
<P>     Spacey does a nice job at getting across some relevant social
commentary along the way, even if the film stays a little inaccessible
due to the lack of any real heroes or very likable characters.  A better
editing job (especially continuity) could have made a big difference
here as well.</P>
<P>     But all is forgiven -- Kevin Spacey adds another title to his long
list of credits, and it might prove to be one of his best.</P>
