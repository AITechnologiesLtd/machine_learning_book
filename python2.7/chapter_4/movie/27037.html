<P>   All attempts at comedy seem to have been swept under the
rug in a movie that at best could be called intermittently
whimsical, and deserving at least some attention for the way
it ridicules the pretensions of the British forces in Belfast and
the I.R.A. alike.   With a script by Barry McEvoy which is
oosely based on the character of his father, "An Everlasting
Piece" is directed by Barry Levinson ("Rain Man," "Diner")
whose lenser, Seamus Deasy, as set up his camera in the
Ardmore studio in Dublin and on location in Dublin and
Belfast.</P>
<P>   Inspired by the tired concept that political battles aside,
friendship and humanity are all that matters, "An Everlasting
Piece" is a small film that conveys the spirit of Kevin Allen's
"The Big Tease" with virtually none of that film's pizazz, wit or
charm.  Levinson opens the picture in a hospital for the
emotionally disturbed in which patients report for haircuts to
barber Colm (Barry McEvoy)--who got his job through his
nurse girl friend Bronagh (Anna Friel)--and his fellow cutter,
George (Brian F. O'Byrne).  Though George is Protestant and
unassuming while Colm is Catholic and cocky, they recite
lines of poetry to each other and get along just fine.  When
Colm learns of a list of balding men maintained by the
hospital's most aggressive patient, known as The Scalper
(Billy Connolly)--because he literally lifted scalps from four
who'd have preferred not to get their hair cut--he and his pal
George manage to obtain the register and go into the
hairpiece business.  Believing that they would have absolutely
no competition throughout Northern Ireland, they are
dismayed to discover that another firm, Toupee or Not
Toupee, is doing business in their town.  A large potential
customer will award a contract to the firm that sells the most
rugs by midnight of Christmas Eve, leading Colm and George
aggressively to seek out the glabrous of their politically
unstable town.</P>
<P>   The whimsy comes from attempts at Saturday Night Live-
type sketches as George and Colm gain acceptance by their
first customer (who refuses to pay because "possession is
nine point of the law"), a large number of British troops who
have become bald because of the stress of their hair-raising
job, and most notable of all by a balding member of the I.R.A.
(Colum Convey) who cannot make up his mind whether to
shoot the two as spies or give them some business.</P>
<P>   The concept of an I.R.A. man looking as vicious as a
Klanman with head covered by a ski mask but as meek as a
shorn lamb during the day may have struck some in the film
business as bizzare and amusing, but comes across as tired
as it is humorless.  Even the usually rollicking Billy Connolly,
so convincing as the queen's regular date in "Mrs. Brown"
and so hilarious during his appearances on Letterman, settles
in for a role as a looney tunes with which he is unable to do a
thing.  If Toupee or Not Toupee is more than a rhetorical
question, my advice if you must choose your movies carefully
is not toupee.</P>
