<PRE>Brassed Off
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1997 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>*** (out of 4) BRASSED OFF is set in the British mining town of Grimley.
The town's colliery (coal plant) is its lifeblood and its backbone. It's
even the reason for the existence of the local band - the Grimley
Colliery Brass Band. Needless to say, when the colliery is threatened,
the whole town feels threatened. </P>
<P>The movie opens after it has been announced that Grimley is on the list
of mines being considered for shutdown. Two of the band members head off
for their last practice with the band. The instability of the situation
at the colliery won't allow them the luxury of paying their band dues,
and the feeling is common among the band members. </P>
<P>The band isn't dead yet, but the only things that keep them going are
the determination of Danny the bandleader (a moving, if melodramatic,
Pete Postlethwaite), and the surprise arrival of a pretty young woman
(Gloria, played by Tara Fitzgerald) who wants to join the band. </P>
<P>The movie uses the band as a way to introduce the audience to the town
of Grimley and to the plight of miners all over Britain who are losing
their jobs. The movie is unapologetically pro-labor and anti-Tory, but
the tone is righteously angry, not just preachy. Once the movie hooks
you, it shows you all the division, pain, anger, and loss that a plant
closing in a one-industry town can cause. </P>
<P>But the townspeople are not just victims who get wiped out. The movie
also shows how people cope and survive during economic peril, the brass
band serving as a positive outlet for their frustrations. </P>
<P>The movie does a good job of keeping track of many characters, each
adding to the collective sense of community. Postlethwaite obviously
stands out as a star, and a subplot involving Gloria and Andy (Ewan
McGregor), gets a fair amount of screen time, but the rest of the movie
is nicely episodic, never lingering on any one person or story for too
long. </P>
<P>The movie is very message-heavy without FEELING too heavy-handed, though
I can't imagine British conservatives appreciating the movie at all.
Perhaps it's hard as an American to feel manipulated one way or the
other about an issue so far removed from daily life. In this country the
movie plays as a bittersweetly charming movie. It's a nice change of
pace from the blaring summer action fare. </P>
<P>But because of the biting condemnation of Thatcherism, I wonder if
perhaps it was intended as something else.</P>
