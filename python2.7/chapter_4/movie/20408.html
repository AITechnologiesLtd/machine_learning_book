<PRE>She's a killer queen dynamite with a laser beam
Drop Dead Gorgeous</PRE>
<PRE>by Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Once you get used to the "Fargo" accents, "Drop Dead" will prove  amusing
and apt in accomplishing what it sets out to do.</P>
<P>A mock-doc (feigned-documentary), this film spoofs a teen beauty pageant in
Mount Rose, Minnesota. The documentary crew follows contestants and judges
through the days just prior and following the city finals. To push things
over the edge of silliness, someone is knocking off (as in killing)
potential teen winners; hence the exceedingly clever title of the movie. In
fact, this may just be the most appropriately titled movie of the year.</P>
<P>Some outstanding moments:
Contestants sport their "All-American" Head-dressings:
Mt. Rushmore, nuclear power (a mushroom cloud), and finally a large ball of
twine atop the head of an unlikely winner who cries out, "I think I
misunderstood the assignment!" The ironic coupling of religion, arms and
teenage girls in The Lutheran Sisterhood Gun Club. A past queen in all her
Hollywood stardom sells St. Paul pork products. Anorexic reigning queen
lip-sincs Melissa Manchester's "Don't cry out loud" from her wheelchair. And
last but not least, the top contestant tap dances to Industrial Rock music.</P>
<PRE>It's simply silly fun.</PRE>
<P>Starring Kirsty Alley, Kirsten Dunst, Denise Richards, and Ellen Barkin.
Directed by Michael Patrick Jann. Written by Lona Williams. Produced by
Gavin Polone and Judy Hofflund at New Line. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>Grade ......................................... B+</P>
