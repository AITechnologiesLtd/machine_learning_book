<PRE>AMISTAD</PRE>
<PRE>Review by Luke Buckmaster</PRE>
<P>When Stephen Spielberg took a break from creating rampaging dinosaurs, hungry
sharks or wacky aliens, he came up with Schindlers List.  Now his second
serious film is Amist-ake, which destroys part of his reputation as an
unbridled genius of the directing industry.</P>
<P>Onboard the ship La Amistad (in 1839), 53 African slaves whom were held captive
take over the ship and viciously slaughter all but two of the crew.  Intending
to go back to Africa, they are tricked by the white survivors and end up on the
coast of Long Island.  The Africans are soon captured and charged with murder.</P>
<P>The question is, whom do they belong to?  Are they the property of the people
who purchased them, various governments whom own the lands they have been on  or
do they have the rights to their own freedom?
Abolitionists Theodore Joadson (Morgan Freeman) and businessman Lewis Tappan
(Stellan Skarsgerd) hire young real estate lawyer Roger Baldwin (Matthew
McConaughey) to defend their case.  This seemingly insignificant trial becomes a
symbol of human rights, and as Baldwin desperately tries to defend the Africans
their situation becomes ever more complicated with communication problems and
the threat of civil war if the slaves are released.</P>
<P>Led by Cinque (Djimon Hounsou), the Africans learn about different aspects of
American society as President Martin Van Buren (Nigel Hawthorne) wishes to
sacrifice them to please other world leaders including the 11 year old Queen
Isabella of Spain (Anna Paquin). Former President John Quincy Adams (Anthony
Hopkins)  a son of one of the founding fathers, helps defend them after much
persuasion when the case is taken to the Supreme Court. What kind of a land is
this, Cinque questions, Where you almost mean what you say? Where laws almost
work?</P>
<P>The real problem with Amistad is not that it fails to achieve brilliance or
potency, its that it does so very sparsely. When we are treated to its
occasional moments of gripping cinema they serve as a reminder of what should
have been rather than what Spielberg delivers on a continuous basis.</P>
<P>Anthony Hopkins performance as the wise John Quincy Adams is simply stunning
and the obvious highlight of the film; he looks and sounds so impressive that
Amistads viewing quality sky rockets whenever he takes the spotlight.  I would
go as far to say that he deserves an Oscar for this stellar performance  but
unfortunately his screen time is limited.  As for Morgan Freeman, this is the
first time I have ever seen him looking like an out of work actor desperately
seeking some lines to recite.</P>
<P>Djimon Hounsou is the only other main actor worthy of a mention, but is often
very annoying to watch as the use of sub titles is very inconsistent.  Half the
time we understand what he is saying (that is, when it is convenient), and the
other half he sounds like a wild ape rambling on about something to do with
freedom.  This is not an insult to the African language, but rather to
Spielbergs awkward choice of communication to the audience.  And John Williams
(whose composer credits include all three Star Wars films, Schindlers List and
Jurassic Park) music score is noticeably annoying and often far too
overpowering.</P>
<P>As an educational video, Amistad would be excellent.  But as a motion picture,
it teases us with a magnificent story put together in a far too ordinary way.
All through the films two and a half hours we are never quite sure whose story
it is  the characters of Cinque, John Quincy Adams and Roger Baldwin all have
interesting stories to tell yet Spielberg doesnt give any of them enough time.</P>
<P>This may sound terrible, but it is my opinion that American people will probably
appreciate Amistad more than most others.  After all, everyone likes to be
reminded that their country has made the right decision at one stage or another.
If this was a tactic that Spielberg used to disguise a fairly weak film, it sure
as hell didnt work on me.</P>
<P>2 stars out of 5
A film that doesnt give its fascinating true story the credit it deserves</P>
