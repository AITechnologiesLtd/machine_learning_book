                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Dorris Dorrie, who both wrote and directed this German-made film,
takes us and the heroine, Fanny Fink (Maria Schrader) on a one hour and
40 minute emotional roller coaster ride.  Fanny is pretty, dresses
nicely, and works at the airport checking luggage for anything
suspicious.  In addition, the job pays well enough to provide a nice
apartment.  What, then, is missing in that picture?   A man.</P>
<P>     All her friends are kind enough to keep reminding her that she is
fast approaching 30, after which she can give up on finding "THE
man."   Her best friend, and neighbor, Orfeo (Pierre Sanoussi-Blise) is
gay.  Orfeo lip syncs in a gay bar and frequently dresses in drag; not
exactly what Fanny is looking for on the romantic side.</P>
<P>     Fanny, beset with her problems, can think  of no one else but
herself.  Fortunately for Fanny, her platonic friendship with Orfeo
keeps Lothar (Michael von Au) the apartment house manager and a boor,
at a distance.  Despite the unhappiness that seems to hover over
Fanny, director Dorrie keeps it from becoming a downer somehow making
us feel that all will yet turn out well for Fanny.  Maybe there IS a
Man and at any moment her life may suddenly bloom.  I would like to
think that.</P>
<P>Written and Directed by Dorris Dorrie.</P>
