<PRE>                          VERTIGO's Last Laugh
                       A film review by John Locke
                        Copyright 1997 John Locke</PRE>
<P>Alfred Hitchcock took a certain prankster's liberty with his 
work, most notably, delighting the audience and, no doubt, himself 
with his unpredictable and amusing cameos. While aware of this, we 
still insist on separate Hitchcocks, the pleasingly wicked charmer and 
the serious artist, with never the twain conflicting. However, his cele-
brated masterpiece Vertigo, recently re-released, exposes Jekyll and 
Hyde as the same man. The strange symmetry of the film subverts dra-
matic structure to create a more elaborate joke, showing that Hitchcock 
had ulterior, even mischievous, motives to his direction.</P>
<P>Vertigo opens with a policeman and a detective (James Stewart) chasing
a fugitive across the tops of San Francisco buildings. Scottie, the
detective, slips down a steep roof to end up dangling from a 
flimsy rain gutter. The policeman attempts a rescue but instead falls to 
his death. The scene ends with the horrified Scottie left hanging by his 
fingers.</P>
<P>In the following scene, Scottie discusses his recuperation with 
Midge, an old friend, but his escape from the dangerous predicament of 
the prologue is never explained. Scottie's cane and references to his 
corset are evidence of unspecified physical injuries, but it's his psycho-
logical injury, his vertigo, that entices our curiosity, strongly enough to 
allow incidental acknowledgment of his physical injuries to satisfy us, 
if indeed we question them at all. But on analysis Scottie's physical 
injuries seem disproportionate to the danger; his escape by no means a 
certainty. It appears unlikely he could have pulled himself up alone 
without the gutter tearing away from the building; and there was no one 
else on the roof to provide timely assistance. If he had dropped the six 
stories to the pavement--the same fall that killed the policeman--he 
would at least have broken bones.</P>
<P>The only further references to the accident are deliberately vague.
Midge jokingly warns Scottie not to "go diving off another rooftop,"
an unrevealing exaggeration; Gavin Elster, the old acquaintance 
who hires Scottie to trail his wife, calls the accident "that thing in the 
paper." Since a means for Scottie's escape can be easily imagined, these 
would be petty observations were they not evidence of Hitchcock's 
imprecision. Not only is Scottie literally left hanging in the opening, 
the viewer, too, is "left hanging" by the subsequent lack of explanation. 
And that forms one side of the symmetry, the set up to Hitchcock's joke.</P>
<P>The remainder of the first half of the film is sustained by the 
mystery of Madeleine Elster's (Kim Novak) relationship to the long-
departed Carlotta Valdez, and Scottie's falling in love with the seem-
ingly haunted Madeleine. The section culminates with Madeleine's 
fatal fall from the Mission San Juan Bautista tower. The mystery 
unfolds to expose "Madeleine" as an imposter, Judy, hired by Gavin 
Elster to trick Scottie and allow the murder of the real Madeleine to go 
undetected. As has been widely discussed (and harshly criticized,
particularly on Vertigo's original release), Hitchcock lays out these
startling revelations midway through the film. The bold tactic breaks the 
formulaic structure we expect from a murder mystery, in which solutions
always come at the end. It risks unsettling the viewer, particularly 
on an initial viewing of the film. However, by dispensing with formula, 
Hitchcock shifts the emphasis of the story from murder to character, a 
potentially deeper subject than the typical whodunit conundrum. Scottie's
behavior and motivations replace the enigmatic "Madeleine's" as the
focus of the story. "Madeleine" was strange, Scottie was earthbound; now
they switch. "Madeleine" becomes the commonplace shop clerk, Judy; Scottie
goes through a period of bizarre behavior, including complete mental
withdrawal.</P>
<P>Back on his feet, Scottie's motivations are complex. He 
becomes obsessed with remaking one woman (Judy) in the image of 
another he believes dead ("Madeleine"). Can this really be love? we 
think. Or is Scottie infatuated with the appearance of women but blind 
to substance? Or does he seek the unattainable in order to perpetuate 
desire? In any case, Scottie's feelings are intense, his actions in remak-
ing Judy, imperturbable. In the climax of the story, when Scottie finally 
discovers that Judy is "Madeleine" his choices become even harder to 
fathom. The woman he has labored to remake suddenly becomes, in the 
flesh, the woman he has idealized. If his profound desire is fantasy, will 
achieving the concrete destroy his feelings? Compounding the dilemma,
the new Judy that Scottie discovers has treated him treacherously,
subjecting him to the grief of lost love, the public humiliation of the
inquest, and a nervous breakdown. </P>
<P>Against all this is the possibility they really love each other. 
Hitchcock sustains our curiosity for the outcome, and perhaps our hope 
for romance, by moderating Judy's character. Despite her likely guilt as 
an accomplice to murder, her moral failure may be less severe. In her 
narrated letter (and the accompanying flashback of the real Madeleine's 
plummet from the tower), we are left with the impression Judy did not 
realize murder would be the result of the scheme to trick Scottie. She 
appears genuinely shocked when Gavin throws Madeleine from the 
tower. Gavin must stifle her screams. Mitigating her responsibility in 
this way gives Scottie room to maneuver emotionally. If he can discover
the truth, he may have grounds for compassion and forgiveness.</P>
<P>(These are the considerations of Scottie, betrayed lover. Additional
questions arise about Scottie, the career lawman who once imagined
becoming Chief of Police. Will he put his obsession above the law and
overlook Judy's crimes? Will he jeopardize his innocence by keeping mum
about the murder?)</P>
<P>The conditions are complicated, but Scottie has the freedom to 
make a choice. Indeed, the story accelerates toward the crucial moment 
in which he will shape his future and define his character. As Scottie 
and Judy struggle to the top of the tower, criminal and emotional 
deceits disintegrate in the heat of exploding truth. There is anger, yet 
passion. The time to choose has arrived. But, disappointingly, chance 
forestalls choice. The pair is startled by a nun ascending into the tower. 
Judy falls from Scottie's arms and out the tower to her death, depriving 
Scottie of his decisions.</P>
<P>Superficially, this conclusion provides some satisfaction, subjecting
Scottie and Judy to like measures of poetic justice, the ironic 
working of fate, or some other intangible force. Scottie loses two loves 
to identical tragedies; Judy dies in the manner of the victim she helped 
murder. Assuming that Hitchcock did not structure the film as a joke, 
this interpretation would leave the conclusion in contradiction with the 
earlier direction of the film. In the long sequence in which Scottie trails 
"Madeleine," we are led to suspect some supernatural force--reincarnation,
ghostly possession, perhaps--as motivating "Madeleine's" strange 
behavior. But the film disavows such forces by resolving the mystery 
with a rational explanation, grounding the story in the worldly realm 
where suspense more naturally results from the indeterminism of free will,
as dramatized by Scottie's uncertain choices, rather than the possibility
of some karmic comeuppance, irrelevant in its randomness. To fall back on
fate after establishing the solitude of freedom would be a clear retreat.</P>
<P>The closing scene thus mirrors the opening, completing the symmetry.
Again, we are "left hanging," this time by the inconclusive ending. The
final shot strands us at a height, showing Scottie on the tower ledge
staring down, stunned, to where Judy has fallen. The many interesting
questions the film raises about Scottie's future will go unanswered. The
double entendre of Hitchcock's opening scene, which ends with a rather
similar shot, has set us up for a magnificent cop-out, warning us, in
effect, of the film's method. On one level, Vertigo bewitches us with
eery fascination; on another, it takes us on a wild goose chase in search
of Scottie's essence, turning his heart into the ultimate MacGuffin.</P>
