<PRE>AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON (1981)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Writer/Director: John Landis
Starring: David Naughton, Jenny Agutter, Griffin Dunne</P>
<P>With the upcoming "An American Werewolf in Paris" coming out Christmas
Day (and looking way too hokey rather than comical), I thought I'd
finally check out "An American Werewolf in London," the original film,
and one of comical director John Landis's first.  What it does is take
the old melodramatic horror films and kinda mocks them with great black
comedy.  Still, it has its flaws.</P>
<P>"An American Werewolf in London" (great title) deals with two Americans
David and Jack (David Naughton and Griffin Dunne, respectively) who go
to London to bum around Europe, get laid, etc.  They are dropped off
after a bit of hitch-hiking around the moors, where they meet some
creepy brits, who mysteriously warn them to "beware the moon" and "stay
away from the moors."  They kind of laugh at this (once they're out of
there, of course), and soon find themselves off the main road, and near
the moors...and with a full moon out.  Soon enough, they are attacked by
a giant wolf, who slaughters Jack, and merely wounds David, before it is
shot by the villagers, and subsequently turns into a human.</P>
<P>David awakes from a coma, and has a series of nightmares, fantasies,
etc, including one where a decomposing Jack visits him, and tells him to
commit suicide since he's a werewolf...and once he dies, he can actually
go on to the next life.  But David has soon fallen in love with his
nurse (Jenny Agutter, from "Logan's Run"), and just thinks he is going
insane.  Then one night, he turns into a werewolf...</P>
<P>The chief positive note about "An American Werewolf in London" is the
humor...and the effects.  If you've ever seen a John Landis film
("Animal House," "The Blues Brother"), you know he has a cool sense of
humor.  Here, it's very dark, as he finds humor from almost anything. 
So we don't take this seriously, he places cool ironic oldies on the
soundtrack, including a couple different versions of "Blue Moon," and at
one instance, CCR's "Bad Moon Rising."  This makes us kind of grin at
the whole thing, even when David is a werewolf and chasing people around
London.</P>
<P>The effects are also quite amazing.  The legendary Rick Baker (who also
worked on "Men in Black") did the creature effects, including the
greatest mutation-into-a-wolf scene in celluloid history (how many of
those have you seen?).  It's disgusting, humorful, and just plain cool
all at the same time, and even look realistic.  I mean, this was made in
1981, and David Naughton's hand is shown actually growing.  And for you
Michael Jackson fans, there's a shot of hair growing behind ears that
was used in the "Thriller" video (also directed by Landis).</P>
<P>The acting's good, especially from Naughton, who's great and comical in
the title role, as well as very likable.  Griffin Dunne all but steals
the film, but what else would you expect from the man who created the
Kafka-stare (in "After Hours").  Jenny Agutter does a good job too, as
the nurse who takes David in to her house, and subsequently screws
around with him a bit.</P>
<P>But as I said, the film is still flawed.  The film is way too short,
seeming to be afraid to expand on any themes it presents.  At roughly 90
minutes, the film moves slowly for the first hour, then speeds up in the
final 30 minutes, which is when he first changes into the wolf.  There
isn't any real depth to the film, even with the romance between Agutter
and Naughton, even if they have fairly good chemistry.  And the ending
is almost anti-climactic and ends way too quickly.  Sure the second the
credits role, I laughed, but it ends on way too serious a note.</P>
<P>Still, "An American Werewolf in London" is an 80s classic (not a bad
thing, believe me), and still a very entertaining little flick.  The new
one looks way too over-produced and effects-y.  This one uses the
effects perfectly, without overcoming the story.  I personally believe
that minimalism would be the best thing to use with this film, and I'm
glad that Landis could make a good film, even if he hasn't made one now
in awhile.</P>
