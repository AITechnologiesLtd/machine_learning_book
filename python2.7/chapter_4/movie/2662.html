<PRE>                             THE LION KING
                       "What's Old Is New Again"
                       A film review by Rob Furr
                        Copyright 1994 Rob Furr</PRE>
<P>     I went to see THE LION KING last night; it was hot, I had six
dollars to burn, and that was the only new movie in town, or so I
thought.</P>
<P>     In reality, THE LION KING is a fairly old movie, or, more
precisely, a whole bunch of old Disney movies tossed in the Mixmaster
and poured into a mold.  I'm sure that there was a plot in there,
somewhere, but most of the movie concerned itself with Disney's
trademarked cutting-edge animation, Warner Brothers-style comedy, and
some of the most forgettable music this side of your local elevator.</P>
<P>     As far as I was able to discern, the plot dealt with the efforts
of one Scar, the obligatory bad lion, to become king of the savannah by
killing the current king and attempting to kill the prince, and Simba's
(the prince and, later, king) eventual victory over Scar.  I'm a little
vague on the details of this supposed plot, because every time the
movie turned its attention that way, I kept having flashbacks to other
Disney movies.  With a few stripes and a couple of weeks with
Body-By-Jake, the nefarious Scar would be indistinguishable from THE
JUNGLE BOOK's Shere Khan.  The rightful king's death tossed me into
Bambi's mother's death scene, I'm sure Simba's exile differed from
Mowgli's time with Baloo only because Phil Harris is dead, and so on
and so forth.  Furthermore, even though what plot there was wasn't
original, there wasn't enough of it.  Even THE RESCUERS DOWN UNDER
had more twists and turns to its plot, and I'm not even including THE
PRINCE AND THE PAUPER in that.  In point of fact, much of what passes
for the plot is actually written in shorthand, with plot twists
becoming acceptable not because that there's any meat to them, but
because they're such cliche'd events that the movie doesn't need to
flesh them out.</P>
<P>     There's also a problem with the music: It's less than twelve hours
since I saw the movie, and the only music I can remember from it is
"The Lion Sleeps Tonight." "Forgettable" is a kind way to describe the
musak that Tim Rice and Elton John have presented us with.  Even the
giant production numbers don't remain in memory: It's over a year since
I last saw BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, and I can still sing most of "Be Our
Guest" from memory ... but I cannot for the life of me remember anything
about "The Circle of Life" except the title and the chord that they
brought the title card of the move in on.  This isn't going to win the
Oscar for Best Song, kids.</P>
<P>     However, that's not to say that there isn't a great deal to like
in THE LION KING.  When the plot isn't getting in the way and causing
flashbacks, there's an awful lot of comedy in this movie.  Rowan
Atkinson's avian major-domo provides several of the largest laughs in
the movie, from his long-suffering shepherding of the young Simba in
the first few minutes, to his tour of duty as Scar's stereo system
towards the end.  Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin and "Ed," the lead
hyenas, are quietly amusing ... they completely lack any *menace*, but
they're amusing ("I just *gotta* get me a wildebeest!"), and there's
that rendition of "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" that rivals any comedic
moment Disney's had in years.  However, my personal favorite comedy
sequence occurs during the climactic battle, beginning with a meerkat
doing a slightly revised version of Spike Jones' "Hawaiian War Chant"
in drag, and ending with a baboon fighting off about eight hyenas in
perfect cheap-martial-arts-movie style, complete with sound effects.</P>
<P>     The animation is incredible, with the wildebeest stampede as the
possible high point of Disney's animation so far.  There are more
colors, more backgrounds, more of everything.  On a purely visual
level, THE LION KING is rivaled only by FANTASIA, and even FANTASIA
cannot compete with THE LION KING when Disney's latest decides to get
serious about its animation.  Words like "Breathtaking," which are
usually used by reviewers to indicate mild amusement, really *do* apply
to the absolute mastery of animation which Disney presents us with.</P>
<P>     Still, THE LION KING is a thin and weak structure covered with
strong comedy and beautiful animation.  It may have grossed $42 million
over its first weekend, but I can't imagine that it'll have the staying
power of ALADDIN.</P>
<P>     On the Furr Scale, THE LION KING is a two-and-a-half star
four-star movie. (In other words, it's *trying* to be the next BAMBI,
but it only manages to be the next GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE.) Go see it,
in a THX theatre, if possible, but don't pay full price.</P>
<P>     (As a final note, I was annoyed by this movie in another way:
After the traditional THX and Dolby Digital wallop-the-audience
commercials, it went straight into the movie.  No trailers at all.
Bummer.)</P>
