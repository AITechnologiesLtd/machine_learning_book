<P>   Ninety percent of Americans over the age of thirty-five are
married or have been joined in matrimony at one time, and
virtually one hundred percent of us have dated.  This could
mean only one thing: we're all searching for romantic love. 
The movies have undoubtedly influenced us to do so with
their glorified portrayals of passion and high emotion, all
backed up by soaring music and exalted sunsets.  Are
romantic relationship and our attempts to find them really the
way the moving pictures would have us believe?  Of course
not; or, more accurately, not until now.  To show us what
dating is really like, Myles Berkowitz, a first time helmer, has
written and directed a remarkably whimsical feature called
"20 Dates," a film with the tagline "So real you're think it's
fiction."  If we take what he claims at face value (allowing for
some invention to give the story a narrative feel), "20 Dates"
captures on film its director's actual foray into the Los
Angeles dating game, featuring his genuine agent, Richard
Arlook, in the role of the agent in the picture, and Elie
Samaha, one of the actual producers, in the role of the
producer in this story.  This casting of real people as though
they were fictional characters in a bizarre and often hilarious
documentary with the feel of a fable gives Mr. Berkowitz's
movie a Pirandellian aura, a fluidity between what's actual
and what's parable.</P>
<P>   Berkowitz is a decent-looking guy in his early thirties who
had been married and divorced and has taken the plunge
anew into the dating game.  Anyone who has experienced
this knows how ambivalent the situation can be, as a guy
leaves what he thought was a secure relationship and is
thrust back into the uncertainty of the romantic rat race. 
Since Berkowitz's producer has put up the money to make
the movie, he insists that his star actually go out with twenty
women, and makes his requirements known in no uncertain
terms each time he gets to speak his mind during the 88-
minute film.  (One hundred thirty hours of film were edited
down, making the editor, in effect, a co-author of the script.)  </P>
<P>   In pursuing love, Berkowitz receives invaluable advice from
Robert McKee, who appears from time to time holding court
in an empty movie theater about the difference between
screen fiction and real-life actuality.  McKee, who has written
teleplays and has adapted plays for the screen, is celebrated
on the lecture circuit, where he discusses the structure of
screenplays.  In this case, he instructs Berkowitz about the
difference between men and women--the old Mars-Venus
dichotomy.  "Men are interested in the physical, and women
are interested in the fantasy, the phantom, or 
metaphysical...so the chance that true love can occur
between two people searching for such wildly different things
is slim to none."  Though the director ultimately proves the
adviser at least partially wrong, he experiences more misses
than hits when escorting his usually gorgeous women to class
restaurants, beachfront picnics, informal cafes, and in one
case even partakes with a outdoorsy type in a hazardous
bungee jump.</P>
<P>   He does not always inform his women of his intent to film
their meetings.  In a few cases he uses a hidden camera to
capture the dates on film, planting the camera behind potted
plants in restaurants and carrying a hidden microphone on his
person.  For such violations of privacy he is the subject of
two lawsuits and even allegedly gets stabbed in the hand by
an incensed woman.  An intrusive camera crew muddles his
scheme by planting the camera within two feet of one date's
face, and in at least one instance his female companion
excuses herself to go to the lavatory and simply disappears. 
Since his credit card is maxed out, he suffers an
embarrassment for having only $56 in his pocket while his
date orders three pounds of a $20-a-pound lobster.  In
another situation Caren, one of Berkowitz's friends, is
captured on film with a stiff young man who blunders horribly:
"At least you're a woman, and not my ex-wife.  That's a good
start."  </P>
<P>   Though his producer continually insists that he show sex in
the movie, Berkowitz coyly drops the blinds in the one
instance in that he has a sure thing, despite the bankroller's
threat (probably a fiction), "I want sex in this movie, or I
swear to God, you're gonna wish you were living in Timbuktu
cause if you're somewhere that I can find you, I'm gonna
break both of your legs."</P>
<P>   Perhaps by studying footage of his dates, which are mostly
disasters, Myles Berkowitz gets to realize his mistakes. At
any rate, the whole episode is worthwhile, because in
February of 1999 he will get to release an entertaining film
that moves ahead at a rapid pace and which includes clips
from popular movies like "Sleepless in Seattle," "When Harry
Met Sally," "Singing in the Rain," and "Titanic."  More
important he has actually met the love of his life, a classy
and comely woman who is studying interior decoration at
U.C.L.A. He found his dream in a posh decorator store, and
discovers that even without a romantic soundtrack to
dramatize their mutual feelings, the high intensity of that first
shared clasp of the hands is quite enough.</P>
<P>   Early on, Berkowitz tells us that he has just two failings: his
personal life and his professional career.  By the conclusion
of the movie, Myles has apparently remedied both.</P>
