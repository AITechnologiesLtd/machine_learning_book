<P>Sly, observant and elegant, "Shall We Dance" is a charming story of 
liberation, the kind of exhilarating freedom one can only achieve by 
stepping out of the shadows and taking the risk of looking foolish in 
exchange for a chance at realizing a dream. Director and writer Masayuki 
Suo focuses on some odd corners of Japanese culture in this gentle comedy,
 but the messages contained in his subtitled tale are universal.</P>
<P>It all begins with the mid-life crisis of a reserved 42 year old 
businessman. Shohei Sugiyama (Koji Yakusho) has attained his goals; a 
nice home, a healthy family and a successful career, but his life feels 
empty. He trudges dutifully through his days with eyes dulled by sadness. 
One evening, while taking the train home from work, he catches a glimpse 
of a young woman staring out the window of a dance studio. Her beauty, 
and the melancholy look on her face, capture his imagination. </P>
<P>After several days of gazing at her during the ride home, he impulsively 
leaves the train and creeps up the stairs towards the dance studio. 
Dancing is viewed with suspicion in Japan, where public displays of 
affection between even a husband and wife are considered tasteless and 
shocking. The idea of two unmarried people holding their bodies close 
together in dance is "beyond embarrassing", the film's introduction 
explains. Regardless, Sugiyama summons his courage and signs up for dance 
lessons. Unable to afford individual instruction with the beautiful Mai 
(ballerina Tamiyo Kusakari), he joins a beginners class and his 
adventures in this unique little subculture begin.</P>
<P>The denizens of the studio are a peculiar bunch. Sugiyama's classmates 
are a extremely intense little man who has taken lessons before, and 
Tanaka, a tall, blobby fellow  whose utter lack of grace is matched only 
by the blissful, childlike smile on his face as he lumbers across the 
dance floor. The men are taught by Mrs. Takahashi (Eriko Watanabe), a 
friendly middle-aged matron who notices Sugiyama's fixation with Mai and 
gently tells him "She's all the sweeter when viewed from afar". Mai gives 
solo lessons to her male clients with obvious distaste. Dance is 
everything to the young woman and the amorous intentions of the men draw 
an icy response. </P>
<P>The most dynamic figure on the dance floor is the amazing Mr. Aoki (Naoto 
Takenaka). A co-worker of Sugiyama's, Aoki travels through the office in 
riotous fashion, moving forward stiffly, then pivoting abruptly, with his 
pelvis virtually leading his body. At the dance studio, Aoki dons an 
absurd long-haired wig and transforms into a frenzied master of Latin 
dance, wildly overstating every move as he leers with the expression of a 
warrior about to attack. Takenaka is hilarious and a delightful scene-
stealer.</P>
<P>Director Suo neatly uses comedy to punctuate the wistful story of 
Sugiyama's quest for satisfaction. His observational style is reminiscent 
of Scottish director Bill Forsyth's work in the wonderful "Local Hero". 
Like Forsyth, Suo frames his subjects in a neutral fashion, letting their 
actions speak for themselves. Watching the men's ungainly efforts to 
learn the art of dance is at once funny and touching. Both director's 
maintain a smooth narrative flow, but their primary focus is on vignettes.
 One of the best scenes in "Shall We Dance" shows Sugiyama practicing his 
steps in the rain by a train platform, as Mai watches from afar. It's a 
lyrical moment that typifies the elegant sentimentality of the film.</P>
<P>The reserved nature of Japanese relationships is also a key factor in the 
story. Sugiyama's wife is pleased to watch her husband blossom, but 
distressed because she doesn't know the cause of his change. Rather than 
simply ask him, she hires a private detective to investigate. Meanwhile, 
as Sugiyama becomes better acquainted with Mai, he looks at his own 
motives. What is it that drives him to stay near this distant young woman?
 And what of Mai herself? Mistrust and anger block her from really living.
 Can she break through her shell and embrace life again? </P>
<P>"Shall We Dance" deals with a lot of weighty issues, but with a light 
touch. Suo respects his characters, foibles and all, and guides his story 
with an affectionate and ethical hand. The result is one of the most 
accessible, entertaining and heart-warming films to come along in a quite 
a while. It's hard to imagine anyone leaving the theater after "Shall We 
Dance" without a smile on their face. </P>
