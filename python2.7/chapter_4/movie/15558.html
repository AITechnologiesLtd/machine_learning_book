<P>Friday, December 4, 1998, Tempe, AZ -- When I first heard about
another release of "Psycho", I wondered how on earth could anyone find
another way to beat this one to death.  But when it turned out this
one is a total clone, that piqued my interest.  Alfred Hitchcock's
1960 release was a favorite of mine when I first viewed it in the
seventies, and has stood the test of time whenever I saw it again.  In
fact, when I last experienced the classic about 10 years ago, I liked
it more than ever.  Seeing this new rendition seems like an exciting
opportunity to re-visit the original, only from a color and 1998
perspective.</P>
<P>Actually, I'm here at the AMC Laguna Theaters because my buddy,
Brandi, is absolutely crazy about "Psycho" and Anthony Perkins.  She's
been reminding me for more than a month now about this opening day,
and now that we are here, you'd think her excitement level was about
as high as someone who finally boarded a vacation flight for Europe,
after waiting a full year.  Brandi has seen all versions up to "Psycho
4", and I swear she has each scene memorized.  Talk about spectator
enthusiasm from someone who was not even born yet in 1960.</P>
<P>The story chronicles Marian Crane (Anne Heche), a Phoenix secretary
who steals $400,000 from her boss's client.  On her way out of town to
meet her boyfriend (Viggo Mortensen), she checks into the Bates Motel
for the night, which is owned by lives-with-a-corpse Norman Bates, a
taxidermist and dual-personality guy who is pleasant and engaging when
he is himself, but a psychopath when his dead mother's personality
takes over.  Marian is murdered in the shower, and her sister
(Julianne Moore) and private investigator (William H. Macy) begin a
search.  Eventually, we learn Norman murdered his mother and lover
years earlier, then exhumed and stuffed her to keep her memory alive,
all of which explains the dismal action of a psychopath.</P>
<P>I'm one who always must be seated before the movie starts, preferring
to glue my eyes to the credits while everyone else is still buying
popcorn and trying to find a seat (usually right in front of me).
Most people care little about the credits (or being rude by arriving
late), but some of the best photography takes place at the beginning.
It's the director's opportunity to set the stage.  But during the
beginning in "Psycho" (1998), there is no photography -- only credits
and music.  And I've got to admit, everyone in the theater is
spell-bound by the opening soundtrack.  No one's buying popcorn or
coming in late to this movie.  The trademark staccato violins are
magnificent.  And Brandi tells me she's got to have the soundtrack --
even before the credits finish.</P>
<P>So much has been said for the original classic (1960), which has its
share of flaws.  And I think the fanfare surrounding the original
"Psycho", though a masterpiece, has less to do with quality and
artistry, and more with the conscious-shocking value of a movie first
released during a time when social conservatism was much, much higher
than today.  It outraged a lot of people, and consequently received a
lot of notoriety, too.</P>
<P>I'm surprised the producers of this movie didn't find it odd to
re-make a movie using 1998 tense  and the original 1960s script nearly
verbatim.  It's simply not realistic for anyone today to pay cash for
any big-ticket purchase, and when I see the rancher belly-up $400,000
($40,000 in Hitchcock's "Psycho") in a downtown Phoenix real estate
office, I wonder, "Come on, get real".</P>
<P>Just try to buy a ticket at the airport today using cash.  Someone
will call the DEA and the drug-sniffing dogs, after which they'll take
away all your cash, even if they don't find contraband.  Of course,
had "Psycho's" tense been left intact, I believe this remake would
have turned out a lot better.  Doesn't it make us wonder why the
producers updated the script from $40,000 to $400,000?  Supposedly to
add more realism for 1998?  Okay, so why not make everything more
realistic?  I'd like to see Gus Van Sant pull this off with "Gone With
The Wind".</P>
<P>Marian Crane's (Anne Heche) encounter with the law is no less
unrealistic.  Even for anyone who has never watched "Cops", we all
know the police today will go off the deep end whenever they're
suspicious.  With their favorite weapon, the RICO Law, they always
find the slightest excuse to search your car so they can steal your
possessions and forfeiture your wheels.  Of course, this exact scene
in the original masterpiece plays well, given the 1960 era.  But it's
way out of character for 1998.  I can just visualize all the police
who are going to watch this new movie, and then water-at-the-mouth at
the sight of all that cash.  They'll also give the state trooper an
imaginary dope slap on the old noggin for not ceasing the money, which
is enough to promote the dweebiest cop who finds it to captain.</P>
<P>The shower scene is intense, and I can imagine that the impact on a
1960's audience would've been more shocking.  I really do think they
could have done without the bare-ass nude scene.  Who wants to look at
someone's butt anyway?  Maybe market research reveals that half the
movie-viewing audience now is perverted, and so directors, anxious to
squeeze the last dollar, want to appeal to everyone.</P>
<P>The violins are superb, and there's no mistaking the hopelessness of
Crane on her way, alone, into the next world.  Of course, the music
stands on its own, but with modern technology in music delivery today,
the screeching violins are too much for me.  I'm one who wants to
punch-out anyone who deliberately scratches a black board.</P>
<P>Brandi says she likes Anthony Perkins in this role better than she
likes Vince Vaughn.  Me, I like Vince better.  I absolutely love
actors who can play a psychopath -- charming one minute, cold and
calculated the next -- never nervous.  The guy next door.  Roddy
McDowall can do it (Martin Ashley, "Shock Treatment", 1964), and here
in "Psycho" I can see Vince doing an excellent job.  He's not as
serious as Perkins was in 1960, nor as one-dimensional, and displays a
much broader range of acting and personality.</P>
<P>Even though he didn't play the part of a psychopath, William H. Macy
demonstrated the same skill in "Fargo".  Here, as the investigator,
and given his talent, I'm expecting more from Macy.  But being
realistic, he would have to play Bates for that to happen.</P>
<P>"Psycho" is less of a remake and more of a scene-by-scene duplication,
with most, if not all, of the original script intact.  Which means the
flaws from 1960 will carry over.  Some of the scenes should've been
updated to convey more passage of time and distance.  I feel cheated
whenever a movie covers a lot of ground with too few transition
scenes.  In one setting, for example, Mortensen convinces his
girlfriend to stay at the store while he visits the Bates Motel, and
in the next he's already there.  Is this flop house across the street
or what?  Give us some sense of time and distance, so we don't wonder
why Marian didn't just keep her eyes open five minute longer and drive
to her boyfriend's place instead of staying at the motel.  The movie
is full of these flaws, all the way to the end when Bates is confined
in a jail cell in one scene, and in the next the psychiatrist offers
dual personality as explanation for the psychopath in him.  Remakes
should at least improve a movie, but we don't get that here.</P>
<P>An interesting footnote I learned is that Robert Bloch, the author of
the original story, is still alive, and that his book is based on a
real cannibal from Wisconsin.  Alfred Hitchcock purchased Bloch's
rights to "Psycho" for a mere $9,000.  Granted, that was almost fifty
years ago, so maybe that was a lot of money back when it would buy
four cars.  Today, however, would anyone trade screen rights for four
vehicles?</P>
<P>Psycho is a good movie.  Brandi gives it four stars, and not wanting
to be all together contrary, I'll go along with her.  Between you and
me, however, three and a half would be more like it.  It was fun to
see the story in color and from a new pair of eyes, and share it all
with one hell of a "Psycho" (and movie) enthusiast.</P>
