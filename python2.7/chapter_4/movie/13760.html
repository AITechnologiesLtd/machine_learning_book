<PRE>SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Steven Spielberg
Writer: Robert Rodat
Starring: Tom Hanks, Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, Jeremy Davies, Adam
Goldberg, Barry Pepper, Giovanni Ribisi, Van Diesel, Matt Damon, Dennis
Farina, Harve Presnell, Ted Danson, Leland Orser, Paul Giamatti</P>
<P>There are two ways that a war film can go, both of them tragic mistakes: 1)
they can glorify it and make it seem like everything the soldiers do is a
great and heroic thing (see John Wayne's "The Green Berets" - a pro-Vietnam
flick); and 2) they try to be totally political about it and ignore the
fact that there's such a thing as heroism, even in the barbarism of war. 
The latter are usually made by people who never had to go through this and
are just viewing from what they've seen on the news and heard from a couple
people.  There's a scene in "The Best Years of Our Lives" that illustrates
what's wrong with the latter.  In it, a soldier who was come back from
World War II with no hands is told he is a "sucker" for going to war by an
everyday schmoo activist, prompting the soldier to attack him in a fit of
rage.  What's wrong with the activist is he's never had to go into battle
and fight for something he believed in, therefore he knows nothing.</P>
<P>And neither did I until about a week ago before I saw "Saving Private
Ryan," perhaps the most realistic, gritty film ever put together by a major
studio.  In the film's opening half hour, we are "treated" to a long,
accurate, and gory depiction of D-Day, namely the Normandy beach siege,
which, from the looks of it, was almost a suicide mission.  We're there in
the boat when it's about to dock with soldiers acting nervous, throwing up,
and the lot.  When the doors open, the first couple rows of soldiers are
gunned down immeadiately, and the remaining soldiers hide behind the blocks
on the beach made so the boats wouldn't be able to drive up onto the beach
any further.</P>
<P>With machine guns blaring all over the surround sound system, jerky camera
movements, people dying left and right, and a group of soldiers trying to
form a little plan at the last minute to complete their mission and stay
alive, we are introduced to one soldier in particular: Captain John Miller
(Tom Hanks), who's hands were shaking before the boats docked, and who's
job it is to command whatever men he can find to try and stop the opposing
army from shooting.  When hiding behind the blocks, the camera closes in on
him, the sound drops, motion slows up, and he looks around as everyone is
quickly and gruesomely being killed.  He even notices one soldier in
particular who, missing his arm, goes back to pick it up and carry it with
him.  Welcome to the inferno.</P>
<P>The film was directed by Steven Spielberg, one of the best directors still
working today, although this film finds him in a career slump: following
the wild successes of "Jurassic Park" and "Schindler's List," as well as a
long hiatus from directing, he made three films in a row, two which opened
last year - "The Lost World" and "Amistad" - and both which were big
disappointments: The former was little more than a cheap way to make money,
and it showed; the latter was too overly ambitious for its own good.  Not
many people realized how important it was that his third film in this trio
really was.  Luckily enough, "Saving Private Ryan" finds him more than back
in his old form, but that he's still as powerful a director as he ever was.</P>
<P>You want to see how great a filmmaker he is?  Look how intensely amazing
the opening Normandy sequence is.  It's probably the most unnerrving thirty
minutes ever caught on film - so unnerrving that I couldn't wait for it to
end, a damn good thing if you're trying to create a war sequence in all its
"glory."  Any other filmmaker, or at least most of them, would falter after
this.  It's such a strong sequence that it could all go down hill from
there.  But Spielberg decides that not only is he going to keep moving on,
but that he's also going to expand his themes, and the result is an
emotional rollar coaster through a realistic debate on duty versus
humanity.</P>
<P>He does this by bringing up a fictitious composite: the Ryan boys, four
brothers who went to war, and three who were found to be killed after
D-Day, with one missing, either dead or alive.  When discovering this, the
heads of the military decide to take strict action: they will send a
platoon to find the last Private Ryan (later played by Matt Damon, who made
this long before he became a star) and bring him home alive.  So following
Normandy, we find that Miller and a group of his en have been chosen to
find him, whether they like it or not (they don't).</P>
<P>The men are a bitter, cynical bunch, showing their anger in several ways:
Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore) shows it by obeying every order and
bitching about it in confidence while Private Rieben (Edward Burns, the
writer/director who needed the good attention anyway) acts completely
sarcastic about everything, hiding his timidness.  Our entry into this
group is with one of the film's many masterstrokes, Corporal Upham (Jeremy
Davies, from "Spanking the Monkey"), a French/German translator who is
assigned to the platoon, and who's never stepped foot in battle before. 
Played to perfect comic nervousness, he becomes the viewpoint of the
audience, wreaking of ignorance and pleading for a little humanity in some
of the film's more frightening scenes, as well as sometimes the only guy
who doesn't know the lingo and attitude that the soldiers have become
accustomed to when being with eachother.</P>
<P>Lingering over all this is Captain Miller, who has the terrible burden of
not only feeling exactly like these soldiers but having to convey a sense
of leadership and emotional stature for the rest of the platoon.  Watching
Miller have to deal with the mighty paradox of commanding when he's as
afraid as the rest of them becomes the film's most human aspect, and thank
god he's played by Tom Hanks who gives what has got to be the best
performance he's ever given.  His is devoid of gloss or cliche; he makes
him into a fully-developed character, worthy of our sympathy, and worried
that his wife will not recognize him because he's been through so much hell
while being in the army.  In his most human moment, he confesses to Sgt.
Horvath that he thinks his mission is bullshit and that Private Ryan
"better be worth it."</P>
<P>"Ryan" could easily be the most anti-war film ever made, what with its
total gory depiction of war and sense of loss we get whenever one of the
soldiers is killed (look at how saddening the scene where Giovanni Ribisi
dies).  But at the same time, this could have been an over-glorification of
soldiers, with everyone gung ho about getting Private Ryan (this premise
could have easily been another vehicle for John Wayne back in the hey day
of war films).  What it is, however, is much better than that: it's a
realistic portrait of this situation that refuses to take sides.  It merely
asks us to look at it for what it is, and make our own conclusions.  He
does this not by having the characters speak the ideas of the filmmaker, as
many films make the mistake of doing, but by showing it through action,
prompting the audience to not see it as propaganda for some personal view,
but to see it as totally and utterly emotionally devastating.</P>
<P>What can be said about the battle scenes in this movie that wouldn't seem
redundant?  What can be said about that shot of the Ryan mother seeing the
army car pull up to her house and the priest getting out that can't be said
just in emotions?  It may not seem obvious right now, but Spielberg has
done and said a lot more about war in this film than any other film in
history ever has.  He has not glamorized it or taken a side with it, and he
has found a new way of hating war and a new way of honoring the men who
risked their lives to fight for their country: these men weren't really
fighting anyone in particular; they were fighting to defend their fellow
men seflessly.  But the most important thing about this film is that it
defies explanation and becomes the one thing that so many films try to be
but never become: cathartic.</P>
