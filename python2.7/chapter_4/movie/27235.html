<P>How the Grinch Stole Christmas  (2000)</P>
<P>Let's face it, Ron Howard's feature film adaptation of Dr. Seuss' book HOW 
THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS cannot take the place of Chuck Jones' cartoon 
version, Boris Karloff at the helm as the narrator and Grinch.</P>
<P>That doesn't mean that Howard's version is not good.  It should remind us, 
however, that humans hold a jaded eye on newcomers:  you'll never be as good 
as the person you're replacing, we would like to get in someone's face and 
say – and sometimes we do.</P>
<P>Aside from spots of slow pacing, the 2000 HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS is 
just fine.  The good doctor's message still comes across – the Christmas 
season has become too commercialized, and what matters most is not material 
– and we're given even more whimsical lore at which to chuckle.</P>
<P>Word has it that Mrs. Geisel, the author's widow, was around to approve or 
nix modern tweaks on her husband's work – read, thank goodness for less 
potty humor!  The major readjustments of plot involve the Grinch's early 
years, specifically, the events that added enough bile to his personality to 
match the green fur covering his body.  Certainly another timeless message 
imparted by the story is tolerance.  When we see the new babies floating 
down to  Whoville, their pristine bassinets suspended from colorful 
umbrellas, we are struck by the infant Grinch's plight.  His cradle and 
umbrella are drab and torn, and more importantly, his appearance and manner 
are vastly different from the norm in Whoville.  Indeed, the movie tilts a 
bit heavily in the direction of correctness, though its visual richness 
coats the morals in sweetness.</P>
<P>The sets are among the major stars of the film.  The aerial shots of 
Whoville are stunning, the crazy cottages nestled among the snow-covered 
hills, all overlooked by the wave-like crest of Mount Crumpit – home of the 
Grinch.  The lair of this green legend is wondrous as well.  Worked up with 
contraptions worthy of Rube Goldberg, replete with Seussian silliness, the 
cave gives us lots of candy for the eyes; what's best is that the 
furnishings are grounded in dark humor, so we are not overcome by sickly 
sentiment.</P>
<P>Too bad the movie's slowest moments come early in the narrative, and mostly 
in the cave.  Meant surely as characterization, many minutes are filled with 
the Grinch grumping around his pad, his self-loathing as prominent as his 
loathing for the Whos who rejected him in his youth.  Speed it up, Mr. 
Howard!</P>
<P>I am not mentioning the star of the film until this, paragraph number seven. 
  Perhaps this is because he is overpaid for his films – a curious irony in 
this particular work.  Jim Carrey is cast perfectly in this role.  Director 
Howard seems to have set him free in a good deal of scenes, though a few of 
these should have been cut, as mentioned earlier.  Anyhow, Carrey is 
marvelously goofy in his body English, speaking perfectly in this 
quintessentially grouchy role.  I suppose I should not hold a grudge against 
actors or athletes because of how many millions they carry away: it's the 
teams and studios that are run by free agency and its cousin avarice.</P>
<P>Anthony Hopkins is the designated deliveryman of the British accent.  His 
voice over narration ends up sturdy but unremarkable.</P>
<P>The supporting cast strengthens this expanded version of the Grinch story.  
Jeffrey Tambor is always a sure character actor, and his mayor of Whoville 
is nicely haughty and short-sighted.  Christine Baranski as Martha May 
Whovier is the aging beauty who once loved the grumpy green guy.  Perhaps 
the best support is lent by Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou Who.  Her cuteness 
never gets in the way of her acting ability.</P>
<P>HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS is a good film to see during the holiday 
season.  It will also make a good addition to any collection of videos or 
DVDs.  Just remember to be tolerant, and regard the movie not as an upstart 
out to upstage the original, but as an update designed to deliver the same 
delicious message.</P>
