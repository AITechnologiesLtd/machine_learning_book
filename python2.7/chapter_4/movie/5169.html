<PRE>                                 MANHATTAN
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1979) ***1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        On the surface, this Woody Allen follow-up to the 
masterpiece ANNIE HALL seems like the same movie all over again. 
There he is, playing a neurotic New York Jew whose career involves 
entertaining the masses with his sense of humor and whose love life 
involves a continual string of mismatches and failures. After watching 
MANHATTAN, though, it's obvious this film explores the theme on a 
much more dramatic and profound level.</P>
<P>        Aesthetically, MANHATTAN is worlds away from ANNIE 
HALL. Filmed in black and white and featuring a constant soundtrack 
of Gershwin music, it seems like an artsy 50's film, but then again no 
film of the 50's ever had a seventeen-year-old girl offering a 
middle-aged man a chance to have sex in a wild way no other 
woman would try with him. That brings up the third difference 
between MANHATTAN and ANNIE HALL -- we get to see the 
charming pedophile side of Woody in this film as he enters a 
relationship with high school senior Mariel Hemingway. The 
mental image of those two together is almost as disgusting 
as Mariel's lesbian kiss with Roseanne. Almost.</P>
<P>        Mariel is in love with Woody, but he continually tells her 
she's too young for commitment. She needs to have more casual 
sex relationships with insensitive jocks before settling down with 
one man (the same advice Madonna's parents gave her at the age 
of seven). So he takes up with emotionally unstable Diane Keaton 
(a.k.a. Annie Hall), who is on the rebound from an extra-marital affair 
with a mutual friend (Michael Murphy) but is eventually lured back 
into the affair when Murphy promises for the millionth time to leave 
his wife. Looks like someone needs to rent WAITING TO EXHALE.</P>
<P>        Like most Woody Allen films, MANHATTAN is a melange of 
relationships gone wrong, only here there are less rapid-fire one-liners 
and more actual drama. Emotional damage occurs right and left in 
MANHATTAN and, while it isn't as funny as ANNIE HALL , it's just 
as rewarding a viewing experience on a different level. And it does 
expose Woody's charming pedophile side so rarely seen outside of 
custody trials.</P>
