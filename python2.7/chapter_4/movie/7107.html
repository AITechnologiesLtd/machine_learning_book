<P>     Before I start lambasting this motion picture, let me recap my 
feelings about the French film upon which JUNGLE 2 JUNGLE is based.  
LITTLE INDIAN, BIG CITY (a.k.a., UN INDIEN DANS LA VILLE) was easily one 
of 1996's worst films -- a dull, lifeless attempt to cull laughs from 
dumb characters doing stupid things in contrived situations.  Not for 
one moment was it cute, funny, or likable.  So Disney, in their infinite 
wisdom, gobbled up the rights and decided to remake this loser by re-
teaming Tool Man Tim Allen with THE SANTA CLAUSE's director, John 
Pasquin.  The predictable result is a bad movie -- the kind of pointless 
tripe that the Mouse Company continues to foist upon us in the name of 
"family entertainment."  </P>
<P>     When I first heard that Allen was going to star in the LITTLE 
INDIAN reworking, my reaction was that it couldn't possibly be worse 
than the original.  Ultimately, I was right, although just barely.  
JUNGLE 2 JUNGLE (what a stupid title -- why use "2" instead of "to"??) 
is pretty close to unwatchable, and it's certainly neither entertaining 
nor enjoyable.  It is slightly more energetic than LITTLE INDIAN, and 
that's the only reason why I have given it a marginally better rating.  </P>
<P>     Allen plays Michael, a top-of-the-line Wall Street trader.  He's 
engaged to an airheaded bimbo named Charlotte (Lolita Davidovich), but 
before they can tie the knot, he has to fly to Venezuela, find his 
current wife, Patricia (JoBeth Williams), and get a divorce (they've 
been separated for more than a dozen years).  When he arrives in 
Patricia's little village, he learns that the thirteen year old white 
kid (Sam Huntington) in a loin cloth is actually his son.  Furthermore, 
for reasons that are never made clear, Michael is obligated to bring the 
boy, Mimi, back to New York to experience life in the big city.  
CROCODILE DUNDEE this ain't.  </P>
<P>     Everything in JUNGLE 2 JUNGLE is hackneyed.  There's never a whiff 
of innovation or a hint that the film makers might be interested in 
trying something different.  And, like all "good" family films these 
days, there are several obligatory flatulence jokes.  I think we're 
supposed to be touched by the growing bond between Michael and Mimi, and 
tickled by the slapstick-y antics of Allen and Martin Short (who plays 
one of Michael's cohorts).  Neither of these aspects work.  There's 
nothing emotionally solid or satisfying about the father/son 
relationship, and the duo's attempts at comedy seem more desperate than 
funny.  The most amusing moment in JUNGLE 2 JUNGLE is entirely 
unintentional.  During a scene when an incredibly fake spider is 
scurrying around the floor of Michael's boss' office, you can see the 
strings being used to manipulate it.</P>
<P>     I for one am sick and tired of the unappealingly unoriginal fare 
that Disney releases on a constant basis.  It's getting to the point 
where a visit to the dentist sounds like a reasonable alternative to 
sitting through another plot-by-numbers family film from the studio of 
plastic characters and happy endings.  At least this time they've 
managed to do something of dubious note:  turn one of 1996's worst 
motion pictures into one of 1997's.  Congratulations, Disney.  I hope 
Walt is turning in his grave.</P>
