<PRE>Rat Race" --  What a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
by Homer Yen
(c) 2001</PRE>
<P>Over the past decade or so, Director Jerry Zucker's
name has become synonymous with over-the-top comedies.
 He brought us "Airplane" in the 80s and "The Naked
Gun" in the 90s.  Thoroughly silly yet frequently
funny, these screwball comedies provided audiences
with a bellyful of giggles through snappy dialogue and
a flood of sight gags.  In his latest effort, "Rat
Race," we see that he still knows how to, more or
less, appeal to our childish sense of humor.  White it
isn't as hilarious or as inspired as his previous
work, you'll still find something that will make you
grin. </P>
<P>You might smile at its crude sense of humor, such as
when a courier who is transporting a human heart
becomes overly curious about his cargo.  You might
giggle at the women who pose as models in order to
steal a land-racer.  And, it's hard not to laugh at
the inane sequence involving an out-of-control car, a
runaway hot-air balloon, and a cow.  I'll just leave
that up to your own imagination.  One can only imagine
what THAT storyboard must have looked like.</P>
<P>These poor souls (and several others) wind up in such
absurd situations because of a bizarre race in which
they are competing.  Sponsored by an unctuous tycoon
(John Cleese with teeth like a piano keyboard), he
furnishes competitors with locker keys.  Starting in
Las Vegas, everyone is told to make their way to a
tiny train station in Silver City, NM where it will
open up a locker.  There, they shall find a duffel bag
containing $2 million, and the first to reach it will
win it all.  Why does he do this?  As he explains, "I
can do anything.  I'm eccentric!" </P>
<PRE>Ready, Set, Go!</PRE>
<P>"Rat Race" features an ensemble of fairly well-known
actors who all get a chance to flex their comedic
muscles.  Most spirited and particularly funny was
Rowan Atkinson who is bug-eyed, walks around flailing
his gangly arms, and seems like he's desperately
emulating Roberto Benigni.  He's obviously the most
gung ho of the bunch.  Sadly, he's narcoleptic and
falls asleep at the most inopportune moments.  Also
likeable was Cuba Gooding Jr., who is forced to steal
a chartered bus filled with Lucille Ball look-alikes. 
When the bus trip begins to experience a few hiccups
and the scores of impersonators wail out the Lucy cry
of "Waaaaahhhhh," not only is it hilarious (for those
who are familiar with "I Love Lucy") but you'll
develop a newfound respect for chartered bus drivers. 
In another memorable segment, thanks to great comic
timing by Jon Lovitz, you would have never known that
Adolph Hitler could be so funny.  The silliness of
this film actually grows on you, and it's a nice
diversion from the recent spate of gross-out comedies.</P>
<P>"Rat Race" works best when the sight gags are in
progress.  Unfortunately, there is a lot of down time.
 For example, the first 30 minutes is just a drawn out
introduction of the eventual racers.  Who cares about
that when the film is all about the wild situations? 
Meanwhile, the ending takes an absurd detour away from
its beloved sense of madcapped buffonery and veers
towards an ill-advised attempt at a schmaltzy,
feel-good ending.  If you want to participate in "Rat
Race," come late, leave early, and enjoy the ride.</P>
