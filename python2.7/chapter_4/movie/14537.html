<P>        On a purely dramatic level, writer-director Sarah Goldbacher's "The
Governess" isn't much more than a slightly more cerebral take on "Jane
Eyre," burdened by a near-lethal dose of  melodrama in its final half-hour.
But for sheer visual elegance, "The Governess" has few equals, and the
magnificence of its imagery more than compensates for its somewhat
overheated story.</P>
<P> The movie is also bolstered tremendously by the finely tuned work
of Minnie Driver and Tom Wilkinson, two actors who've demonstrated uncommon
versatility throughout the last year, Driver in films ranging from the
ridiculous ("Hard Rain") to the near-sublime ("Good Will Hunting"), and
Wilkinson in roles running the gamut from the uptight foreman in "The Full
Monty" to the mad Marquess in "Wilde" to the villain in "Rush Hour." Both
actors are near the top of their form in "The Governess."</P>
<P> Driver lands the key role of Rosina, the kind of challenging,
multi-faceted character most young actresses can only dream of playing, and
she obviously revels in it. Born into a rich Jewish household, Rosina is
sharp-witted, well-educated and bright enough to realize a woman's mind is
far less valuable in the eyes of mid-19th-century English society than her
domestic skills and drawing-room manners. Becoming a wife is viewed as the
only viable option for a girl of her class; employment opportunities are
limited to servitude or prostitution.</P>
<P> After her father is murdered, Rosina dodges a marriage of
convenience to a fish merchant and takes it upon herself to provide for the
family. Since anti-Semitism runs high all around her, she masquerades as a
Christian named Mary Blackchurch to secure a job as a governess in a remote
home on Scotland's pastoral Isle of Skye, which the city-bred lass describes
in a letter home as "green, green and more green."
 The position is unrewarding at first -- "Mary" quickly realizes Clementina
(Florence Hoath), the little girl she's supposed to watch over is "a rodent
in lace petticoats" who enjoys leaving dead rats on people's pillows and
staging demented little puppet shows -- but Charles Cavendish (Wilkinson),
her employer, recognizes the governess' intelligence and allows her to
assist him in his research lab. Charles is looking for a solution to
stablize the photographs he's been taking; "Mary" finds the answer when she
accidentally splashes one of the pictures with saltwater (which, in a minor
triumph for her people, was made with kosher salt).</P>
<P> What eventually develops, of course, is exactly what one would
expect in an isolated location between a lonely man with a chilly, nagging
wife (Harriet Walter) and a young woman hungry for knowledge and acceptance.
Meanwhile, "Mary" tries to hold on to her Jewish heritage by worshipping in
secret and whispering prayers in Hebrew even as she crosses herself in the
Cavendishs' church.</P>
<P> Since "The Governess" deals with the early days of photography,
Goldbacher incorporates into her story all sorts of gorgeous visual effects
to accentuate the material, including sepia-tinting that makes certain
scenes look like antique postcards, complex double- and triple-exposures to
layer images on top of each other and a wonderful bit in which "Mary"
remains fixed in the center of the frame while hyperactive Clementina is
seen as a blur zooming around her. Goldbacher also weaves some powerful,
almost ethereal images into the encounters between Charles and "Mary"; the
shot of a white veil rising and falling on the virginal governess' face as
Charles caresses her is loaded with both symbolic meaning and erotic
potency. It's moments like this one that linger in the mind long after the
less convincing elements of "The Governess" have faded away.</P>
