<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
3 and half stars</P>
<P>"Time is a monster that cannot be reasoned with," says one character in
Simon Birch, and that quote sums up much of the meaning of this film -
but there's more to it than that. Simon Birch grasps one extraordinary
character and shapes him in a good-natured and solidly made film.  It is
a film with meaning and significance, and one that uses emotion to keep
its audience interested.  For the most part, it works like a charm.
Simon Birch is an involving and gratifying experience, one that tunnels
its way into your heart and leaves you feeling uplifted.  The only
significant flaw in the production is its stark simplicity - the
storytelling here is straightforward and obvious, but compelling
nonetheless.</P>
<P>During the film's opening scene, we know that it will not end entirely
happily from the sight of a young boy's gravestone.  Simon Birch (Ian
Michael Smith) is the smallest delivery in the history of the Gravestown
Memorial Hospital, pronounced a miracle by doctors.  Simon is physically
stunted but intelligent and witty - during church he interrupts the
sermon: "If God's made the church bake sale a priority, we're in a lot
of trouble."  Simon's best friend is Joe (Joseph Mazzello), and together
they strive to answer the questions that plague their lives.  For Joe,
the disclosed identity of his father lies somewhere in the town, and
Simon firmly believes that he is an instrument from God who will, one
day, become a hero.</P>
<P>The film would have succeeded more on a dramatic level had it taken a
greater focus on Simon's personal life.  His parents neglected him since
birth, ashamed at how society considers him a freak and oblivious to the
incredible person he has become.  But I guess that is another story.
Simon Birch is really about the friendship between two very different
people, and young actors Ian Michael Smith and Joseph Mazzello bring
that friendship to life.  Smith especially is incredible in his first
film role - his performance is the most unique act you'll see this side
of Roberto Benigni.  The supporting cast is also splendid.  Ashley Judd
makes a believable homely mother to Joe, and Jim Carrey has a small but
special part as Joe's adult, present day self.</P>
<P>Simon Birch is simplistic in formation and unashamedly sentimental, yet
it deserves to be respected and admired for its insights into the human
endeavors of faith, devotion and friendship.  Director Mark Steven
Johnson (who wrote Grumpy Old Men and its sequel) paces his film well,
and at no point does it become boring or intimidating.  It is an honest
and good-natured relationship study with clarity and precision.  A
lovely little film that wears its heart on its shoulders, Simon Birch is
a charming journey to the heart of one of societies lovable misfits, and
a "normal" boy whose life will be altered forever thanks to a small,
"meaningless" outcast.</P>
