<P>I felt strongly conflicted while watching "Instinct." Part of me 
wanted to just surrender and enjoy the film, relishing the strong 
acting and philosophical message. But every time I gave in, something 
would happen to remind me that, beneath the surface, this was just 
another mainstream Hollywood movie. "Instinct" is extremely 
derivative, needlessly manipulative and even a bit superficial, but 
I'm still giving the film a qualified recommendation because, as 
annoying as the bad parts are, the good parts are really, really good.</P>
<P>Cuba Gooding Jr. plays Theo Caulder, an upwardly mobile psychiatrist 
given the juicy assignment of assessing Dr. Ethan Powell (Anthony 
Hopkins), a renown anthropologist and primatologist who left for 
Africa to study gorillas and returned a madman. Seems that the doctor,
 whose relations with his family were distant at best, developed a 
much better rapport with the great apes. Powell disappeared into the 
jungle, only to emerge much later in chains, accused of attacking a 
group of men and murdering two of them. </P>
<P>Housed in the psychiatric wing of a maximum security prison after 
being shipped back to the States, Powell is to be evaluated for 
competency. Young Caulder sees a career boost, and a possible best-
seller, in his new patient, but as he tenuously builds a relationship 
with the damaged man, he discovers something far more significant.</P>
<P>One of the best things about "Instinct" is the casting, along with 
most of the performances. In the wake of his Academy Award-winning 
turn in "Jerry Maguire" and wildly jubilant acceptance speech at the 
Oscar ceremonies, Cuba Gooding Jr. has done the over-enthusiastic rah-
rah bit to death, culminating in a series of soft drink commercials 
where he comes off like a coked-up personal trainer gone berserk. 
Thankfully, Gooding is controlled, thoughtful and quite engaging here 
(although in one scene, where he leads a group of prisoners in a 
defiant chant, I half expected him to start thrusting cans of Pepsi 
at the convicts). Gooding makes the transition from silky opportunist 
to shaken human being very effectively, and he works beautifully with 
Anthony Hopkins.</P>
<P>As usual, Hopkins is superb, taking a role earlier slated for Sean 
Connery and putting his own definitive stamp on the character. 
Manacled and slightly hunched over, he silently peers out from his 
long white hair like a leopard behind wild reeds. Hopkins doesn't 
just play the deranged anthropologist, he inhabits him. From the 
film's moving (and incredibly realistic) scenes of Powell communing 
with a family of gorillas, to a stunning extended sequence where he 
gives Caulder a harrowing lesson on the illusion of control, Hopkins' 
work is flawless. </P>
<P>Alas, the script is not. Gooding and Hopkins are so strong that it 
takes awhile to notice that the production is a somewhat sluggish 
pastiche of other movies, from "Gorillas in the Mist" to "One Flew 
Over the Cuckoo's Nest," with a healthy dose of "Equus" to boot. The 
film even includes the "standing in the rain with arms outstretched 
as a metaphor for freedom" overhead crane shot from "The Shawshank 
Redemption," "Pleasantville" and God knows how many other flicks. 
While the image was once evocative, it now needs to be put out to 
pasture once and for all.</P>
<P>Hopefully there's also room in that pasture for lovable loonies, 
another irritating movie cliché. Mental illness isn't adorable, as 
everyone (except screenwriters) already knows, but "Instinct" offers 
a pair of convicts who, despite being criminally insane, are more 
insufferably cute than all four "Teletubbies" combined. </P>
<P>While "Instinct" embraces too many trite plot devices, it 
successfully navigates past a few. Even though "NewsRadio's" Maura 
Tierney, playing Powell's estranged daughter, achieves a nice 
chemistry with Gooding, their relationship remains platonic, sparing 
us a needless romantic subplot. </P>
<P>Unfortunately, the filmmakers don't resist the temptation to wrap up 
their story with a stupid Hollywood ending. I won't disclose the 
details, but as you leave the theater, consider the logistics of the 
final image and ask yourself how it could have occurred. The answer 
is simple: it couldn't. While you're at it, reflect on how the 
resolution seems to negate the one thing for which Powell gives 
Caulder thanks. Better yet, do yourself a favor and don't stay for 
the ending. I'm serious. Late in the film, when Gooding finishes his 
speech about "the game," get up and walk out. Then, on the way home, 
make up your own ending. I guarantee that whatever you come up with 
will be more plausible that what the writers concocted. </P>
<P>Despite the clichés, despite the languid pacing, despite seeing great 
character actors cast as stereotypes, and even despite the ending, 
I'm still glad I saw "Instinct." The film delivers a message that, 
however obvious, bears repeating. And it provides a fine showcase for 
the considerable talents of Cuba Gooding Jr. and Anthony Hopkins. To 
watch actors as electric as those two, it's worth sitting through the 
rough stuff. </P>
