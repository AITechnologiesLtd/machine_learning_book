<P>     NOBODY LOVES ME is a charming, emotionally perceptive, German 
romantic comedy about the life of a woman who believes herself to be 
unloved and unlovable.  About to enter her fourth decade of life, Fanny 
Fink (the delightful Maria Schrader, who resembles Mary Louise Parker) 
is convinced that "a woman over 30 is more likely to get hit by an A-
bomb than find a man."  Her daily mantra is:  "I'm strong, I'm pretty, 
I'm intelligent.  I love and I am loved," but she speaks the words 
without conviction.  To potential suitors, she gives the advice, "I 
wouldn't fall in love with me if I were you."  Talk about a self-esteem 
problem!</P>
<P>     Although writer/director Doris Dorrie (STRAIGHT THROUGH THE HEART, 
MEN) has used a modern-day German woman to personify the angst and 
uncertainty associated with being single in the '90s, the fears and 
emotional upheaval suffered by Fanny are things that many people will be 
able to identify with, whether they're male or female, European or not, 
and young or old.  Dorrie's perceptiveness when it comes to this mindset 
is what makes Fanny such an endearing character and causes the film to 
be so compelling.  </P>
<P>     NOBODY LOVES ME is not a romantic comedy in a traditional sense.  
It's more about learning to appreciate what you have rather than what 
you don't.  Through the friendship of Orleo (the versatile Pierre 
Sanoussi-Bliss), a gay, black psychic, Fanny comes to understand the 
difference between seeing the glass half full and half empty.  She may 
not have a lover, but, in Orleo's words, she has "a job, a family, a 
place, and the right skin color", none of which apply to him.  </P>
<P>     According to Orleo's prediction, Fanny will find her "last chance 
at love" in a blond, thirty-ish man who is somehow associated with the 
number 23.  The likeliest candidate is the new manager of Fanny's run-
down highrise apartment building, Lothar Sticker (a suitably vacuous 
Michael Von Au).  Warned by Orleo that she must be aggressive, Fanny 
pursues him, but his interest in her is sporadic.  By falling for a man 
who clearly doesn't reciprocate her feelings, Fanny learns the pain of 
unrequited love.  In a moment of despair, she cries that she wishes she 
had remained emotionally sheltered.</P>
<P>     However, through this misery, Fanny comes to love Orleo.  As in 
CARRINGTON, where a heterosexual woman and a homosexual man develop an 
intense, platonic love, this pair becomes hopelessly emotionally 
entwined.  Orleo is dying, however, and the nearness of his death adds 
an immediacy to their relationship that might not otherwise be present.  
Through this, Fanny learns a lesson about what real "love" is.</P>
<P>     Despite the seriousness of some of the material, NOBODY LOVES ME is 
an uplifting motion picture, largely because of Dorrie's often self-
deprecating style.  Not only does she use humor to keep the film's tone 
light, but there's more than a sprinkling of magic realism.  The death 
symbolism is overdone to the point of being comical.  For a "conscious 
dying" class that she's taking, Fanny is making her own coffin.  When 
her mother is aghast to see her sleeping in it, Fanny remarks that it's 
actually quite comfortable.</P>
<P>     Dorrie has stated that the film reflects the prevalent aspects of 
the modern German character:  isolation and an almost-obsessive tendency 
to wonder about death.  I see these as more universal characteristics, 
however, and it's for that reason that NOBODY LOVES ME will likely 
connect with all audiences.  Whether you see yourself in Fanny or Orleo, 
or just prefer to watch these two as characters in a well-told story, 
Dorrie's film is worth a trip to the theater.</P>
