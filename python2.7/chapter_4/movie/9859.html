<P>Despite being married to Jamie Lee Curtis, Christopher Guest still 
manages to write and perform outstanding pieces of comedy. Frankly, I 
find this amazing. Were I married to Jamie Lee Curtis, I'd just follow 
her around the house all day. Getting any work done would be simply out 
of the question (oh sure, I'm gay, but we're talking about JAMIE LEE 
CURTIS here, for God's Sake!). But enough about my post-adolescent 
fantasies. Christopher Guest, one of the creators and stars of the 
brilliant comedy "This Is Spinal Tap", scores again with "Waiting For 
Guffman", a very funny bogus documentary about the 150th Anniversary 
festivities in Blaine, Missouri. </P>
<P>Here's the set-up. The city leaders secure the services of transplanted 
New Yorker Corky St. Clair (Guest) to stage a musical celebrating 
Blaine's rich heritage (the town is famous for its wooden stools and a 
1946 UFO landing.) Guest is a riot as the effete St. Clair, a 
delightfully clueless off-off-off Broadway veteran. In Blaine, St. Clair 
is well-known for his stage production of "Backdraft". To create a more 
realistic feel, he sent bits of burning newspapers through the heating 
ducts. Oh sure, the theater caught fire, but the citizens of Blaine 
appreciate the great effort St. Clair put into his work. They also seem 
oblivious to the fact that St. Clair is a screaming queen. After all, 
he's married! Well, nobody has actually ever seen his wife, but they know 
she's real because St. Clair has often been sighted in the Women's 
clothing department of local stores, and he knows a great deal about 
depilatories. </P>
<P>While Guest's performance is the center of "Waiting For Guffman," there 
are many more pleasures in this affectionate, low-key satire. Check out 
the expressions on the face of Bob Balaban, a local music teacher 
displaced as director by St. Clair. Balaban says little about the 
nightmare he sees being assembled, but he seethes beautifully. Eugene 
Levy, Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara are also delightful as wanna-be 
performers who are as enthusiastic as they are untalented. The finished 
play, "Red, White and Blaine" is a real hoot. It's bad, of course, but 
it's the kind of bad that's a real pleasure to watch. </P>
<P>Several critics have attacked "Waiting For Guffman" as a smug, elitist 
slam on small town America. It isn't. "Waiting For Guffman" shows real 
affection for its characters. Most of the film's cast came from small 
towns and are all too familiar with the sheer weirdness of community 
theater. That peculiar mixture of little-to-no talent, combined with 
delusions of grandeur, is captured in all its glory here. "Guffman" isn't 
as funny as "This Is Spinal Tap," but few films are. Guest goes for a 
minor-key approach to humor this time, and succeeds far more often than 
not. Incidentally, be sure and stay for the film's closing credits, which 
contain some of the movie's funniest moments. </P>
