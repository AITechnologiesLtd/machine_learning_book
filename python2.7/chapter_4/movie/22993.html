<PRE>`Scream 3' – More Stabbings, Less Fun
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>In general, I've always hated the horror genre.  I do
not like films where the primary engine of
entertainment involves the spillage of gallons of
blood and where characters are brainless morons who
more or less deserve to meet the fate of having a
knife plunged through their backs.  But I found a new
respect for the genre when I saw the first `Scream.' 
It was an inventive whodunit/slasher flick that was
unexpectedly clever and truly frightening (and made my
Top 10 for that year).  `Scream 2' also managed to
establish a nice pace and a fair amount of tension. 
Alas, `Scream 3' is succumbing to what all horror
sequels begin to suffer.  And that's a lack of
creativity.</P>
<P>`Scream 3' takes place in Hollywood where filming of
`Stab 3: Return to Woodsboro' is underway.  Woodsboro,
as you may recall, is the sleepy town where the
stabbings first took place.  A new series of murders
begins to unfold.  The victims are cast members of
`Stab 3' and at each murder scene the killer points
out that Sidney Prescott (recurring heroine Neve
Campbell) will be an eventual victim.  Also reprising
their roles are David Arquette as the meek Dewey Riley
and Courtney Cox Arquette as the self-absorbed,
story-hungry reporter, Gale Weathers.  Dewey is a
technical advisor on the set of `Stab 3' having lived
through the Woodsboro events himself.  Gale shows up
after having heard about the murders.</P>
<P>As with the first two `Scream' movies, a couple of
trademark elements are carried forth to this
installment.  The first element is the explanation of
the rules of the game, and this is my favorite scene. 
Delivered posthumously on videotape by Randy Meeks
(Jamie Kennedy), a victim back in Woodsboro, he
explains that Sidney is caught up in a trilogy.
Secrets will be uncovered and in the end and only
Sidney or the killer will survive (I'm hoping that
he's also telling us that there won't be a Scream 4').
 The Whodunit element is also a fun aspect.  The
audience continually tries to guess whom the killer
is.  Is it the police detective who seems to have an
obsession with the Woodsboro murders?  Is it a
low-life producer who seems to be hiding something? 
Is it one of the `Stab 3' cast members taking their
role too seriously?  Just when you think you know who
it might be, you'll discover that you were wrong. 
And, of course, there's the multitude of `BOO!'
moments.  Dark buildings, creaking doors, spooky music
and that all-too-haunting ghost mask can just be
unsettling at times. </P>
<P>These are the elements that made the `Scream' movies
hip and witty.  But `Scream 3' has lost a little of
its edge.  And it's not really the fault of the
scriptwriter or any of the cast members.  This film
just suffers from a ‘been-there-done-that' kind of
feeling.  Even the looks on the actors' faces seem a
bit tired and worn.  Another problem was that the
characters were not as lovable as the ones from the
other `Scream' movies.  When they died (like Randy), I
cared.  Here, a couple of annoying characters
derserved to be stabbed.   Also, the killer who
finally reveals him/herself is totally arbitrary,
resulting in a very weak payoff, unlike the first two
installments.  `Scream' is still levels above than the
odious `I Know What You Did Last Summer' series.  And
I give director/creator Wes Craven a lot of credit for
reinventing the horror genre.  However, it's time to
put this baby to rest.</P>
