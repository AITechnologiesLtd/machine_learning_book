<PRE>                                      BRAVEHEART
                       A film review by John Benjamin Strelow
                        Copyright 1996 John Benjamin Strelow</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  2 out of 5</PRE>
<P>It was with great anticipation that I sat down to view BRAVEHEART last 
week as it premiered on American cable.  The Academy Award winning film 
had been highly acclaimed.  It also featured the music of one of my 
favorite film composers, James Horner.  What I was in for was a 
disappointing and overlong film which was anything but the best picture 
of 1995.</P>
<P>What drags BRAVEHEART down is its screenplay.  It abounds with high 
production values:  John Toll's award-winning cinematography (which also 
graced Edward Zwick's 1994 LEGENDS OF THE FALL), a gorgeous score by 
Horner, and the sort of logistics that make you wish assistant directors 
were household names.  But this does not save a misguided script.</P>
<P>The film wishes to paint its central character as a hero, but the 
viewer's only response to his "heroism" is intellectual:  William Wallace 
(producer-director Mel Gibson) is fighting for freedom and against 
tyranny, so we have to root for him.</P>
<P>But Wallace's actions paint a different story.  He speaks of freedom and 
acts of vengeance.  Though one intellectually realizes Wallace is on the 
right side, the film paints an unconvincing emotional portait, in which 
Wallace is just not as bad as the English king.</P>
<P>Wallace speaks of freedom, but his acts point toward vengeance.  After 
kicking the English out of Scotland, he decides to invade England.  This 
is evident of a "Spartacus Complex", and this example applies both 
historically and cinematically.  The historical Spartacus at one point 
moved from liberating slaves to sacking Roman cities; the film SPARTACUS, 
like BRAVEHEART, has high production values and competent performaces and 
is dragged down by an awful screenplay.</P>
<P>It is a shame that such an excellent score is part of such a terrible 
film.  Horner's score tries to make emotional connection, but the 
performances and the script do not help.  Gibson portrays Wallace in such 
a way that the audience cannot relate to him or identify with him.  This 
drags down any emotional connection to the film's plot, and turns three 
hours into a total waste of time.</P>
