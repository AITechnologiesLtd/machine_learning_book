Susan Granger's review of "WHERE THE MONEY IS" (USA Films)</PRE>
<P>    When Paul Newman gets a roguish twinkle in his eye, you
know there's gonna be trouble - and that's just what happens when a
sexy, seductive nurse, Linda Fiorentino, discovers that her newest
catatonic patient is actually a bank robber who faked a paralytic
stroke to get out of prison. In this clever, unconventional caper,
Newman plays Henry Manning, a renowned thief who got caught in a
Denver bank vault during a massive power failure. Now he's playing
feeble in an Oregon nursing home, just waiting for the right time to
re-claim his life. "There's an element of Butch Cassidy in Henry,"
Newman says in the press notes, quoting The Sundance Kid's
oft-repeated line: "Keep thinking, Butch, that's what you're good at."
The problem occurs when the larceny-minded Fiorentino, who yearns for
adventure, tries to recruit him into masterminding a local heist. "I'm
playing brain-dead, not brain-damaged," he scoffs - but soon the plot
thickens, much to the dismay of Fiorentino's hapless husband, played
by Dermot Mulroney.  While Linda Fiorentino's ex-prom-queen-without-a
future character is intriguing, this is Newman's film - from beginning
to end. You can't take your eyes off him. There's a delicious scene in
which he explains, "Faking a stroke isn't easy - you gotta work at
it," demonstrating how he learned to control his reactions with a
G. Gordon Liddy-inspired lighted match-burning-his-hand. Written by
E. Max Frye, Topper Lilien & Carroll Cartwright and directed by Marek
Kanievska, it's a taut story, filled with tension and suspense. On the
Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Where the Money Is" is a low-key,
fun-filled, spirited 7, taking a cool cue from jailbird Willie
Sutton's answer to why he robbed banks: "Because that's where the
money is."</P>
