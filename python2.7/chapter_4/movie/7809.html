<PRE>                               HIGH SCHOOL HIGH
                       A film review by David Wilcock
                        Copyright 1997 David Wilcock</PRE>
<PRE>STARRING JON LOVITZ
COLUMBIA RELEASE</PRE>
<P>So, here's another spoof from the creator of The Naked Gun films (David
Zucker, although he didn't direct this) Dangerous Minds should be one of the
most easiest films to spoof, yet this film still manages to mess up. The
film just hasn't got enough laughs in it. I suspect this is not because the
writers aren't funny, but because they were trying to hard to stick to the
plot of the film! Imagine, a spoof with a plot!</P>
<P>And that's the films downfall. You can't really make quick fire gags around
a plot, and near the end of the movie, the film runs out of jokes altoghether.
So, this film is majorly dissapointing. Although Lovitz and Louise Fletcher
(who played the nurse in One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest) are funny, they
can't save the film. This film isn't as bad as the dire Spy Hard, but it
could have been much funnier.

Overall Rating=** out of *****
