<PRE>                                THE SHADOW
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  The sumptuous and fun new film
     version of THE SHADOW is faithful to the letter of the
     canon of the old radio hero but adds a lot that is new.
     What they have changed makes for good storytelling.  This
     is a very enjoyable fantasy film and could well be this
     summer's JURASSIC PARK.  This one is a lot of fun.
     Rating: high +2 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men?  Now let's not
always see the same hands.</P>
<P>     Back in the 30's and 40s, before there was television, one of the
great super-heroes of the radio-ways, pulps, and comics was Lamont
Cranston.  He was a variant on H. G. Wells' INVISIBLE MAN.  Cranston
could not actually make himself invisible, but using techniques he
learned in the orient he could "cloud men's minds so they cannot see
him."  With adventures that began in 1931, he was one of the earliest
popular American superheroes, and was perhaps the most popular superhero
on the radio.  The Shadow had already been a household name  more than
seven years when Superman first appeared and more than eight years when
Batman was first introduced.  To the radio's sinister strains of Saint-
Saens's "Omphale's Spinning Wheel" the invisible Shadow would stalk the
night looking for evil-doers to scare the bejeezus out of.  Over the
years there were many cast changes and many voices to The Shadow and his
sidekick, "the lovely and talented Margo Lane," including at one time
respectively, Orson Welles and Agnes Moorehead.</P>
<P>     Even though The Shadow lasted on radio twenty years, until 1956,
there was never (until now) a memorable version of The Shadow on TV or
in the movies.  Somehow the combination of atmosphere and special
effects necessary would have never been possible.  Also unlike other
superheroes, The Shadow had to be played by someone ugly.  The pulps,
which started publishing the character in 1931, always portrayed him as
a tall man with a long crooked nose, a fedora, and the lower part of his
face covered.  He was more frightening when you could see what he looked
like.  Victor Jory was nearly ugly enough and starred in a 1940 serial,
but could not match the phantom with the disembodied voice of vengeance
on the radio.  Today special effects are much more articulate on the
screen, even if actors often are not.  The menace of The Shadow is now
very possible to show on the screen.  In fact, while on the radio The
Shadow could only cloud men's minds and in later years read what he
clouded, the screen's new Shadow has an arsenal of psychic weapons, and
so do his enemies.  This provides opportunity for more visual
excitement.  But what current actor is ugly enough to play Lamont
Cranston, The Shadow?  Would you believe Alec Baldwin?  I would not
have, but this film manages to have a handsome Shadow without
compromising on the menace or the image.</P>
<P>     As far as I know, the radio plays never gave you much of a history
of how The Shadow got his peculiar talents.  I have been a fan of the
radio plays and they never went into any detail on the origins of The
Shadow except that in the Orient this hero learned the ability to "cloud
men's minds."  The film goes into much more detail.</P>
<P>     Our story begins in Tibet with Lamont Cranston anything but heroic.
As his first alter-ego Ying Ko, he is a mysterious drug lord of American
origin.  It is hard to believe that this villain will one day be the
great crimer-fighter I know from the radio series.  Seduced by the light
side of the force he goes to New York to make amends for the evils he
did in the East.  He gets one opportunity after a priceless sarcophagus
is sent, un-requested, to the New York Museum of Natural History.  The
coffin leads to murder and The Shadow finds himself fighting Shiwan
Khan, the last descendent of Genghis.  Khan is portrayed by John Lone
who played THE LAST EMPEROR and Khan is now determined to become the
next one.</P>
<P>     THE SHADOW probably does not use Baldwin to the fullest it could
since the demands of playing a superhero fall well short of those of
being one.  It at least gives him a chance to play someone a little
sinister and helps to shake off his clean-cut family man image.  Perhaps
out of place are his humorous one-liners after action scenes.  They were
funny when James Bond delivered them in the 60s, but they have become
much too common in action films and it is all wrong for the somber
Shadow to be making "Bondisms."  Penelope Ann Miller is attractive in
dresses featuring low cuts in front and lower cuts in back.  She has a
little more to do than the original Margo Lane--the original was little
more than a sounding board so the audience knew what The Shadow was
thinking--but still this is not a role that stretches someone's acting
abilities.  One way to tell this film had serious financial backing is
the name actors in parts that could have gone to unknowns.  Jonathan
Winters, in his most reserved role in memory, plays the police
commissioner actually fairly well.  Peter Boyle has little to do and
seems along only for the ride.  Andre Gregory is completely wasted as a
minor functionary in The Shadow's network.  Tim Curry makes a weird
villain, but doesn't that go without saying?</P>
<P>     But the real star of the film is New York City of the 1930s.  Not
New York as it was then or ever, but a beautiful, idealized, Art Deco
1930s New York City.  Director Russell Mulcahy, who gave us the great-
looking HIGHLANDER, gives us a stunningly idealized Manhattan of the
mind's eye.  In addition he give us small gratuitous surprises for the
camera including one subjective shot that is almost a roller-coaster
ride in itself.  And a Jerry Goldsmith score is always a plus.</P>
<P>     This may not be exactly the classic radio version of The Shadow,
but it may be more fun.  For the most part it does not contradict the
canon, but it places it in a larger context and fills in many of the
blanks.  There are some changes but there is a lot of filling in of gaps
in some very unexpected ways.  Lamont Cranston is given an evil past
that certainly casts The Shadow in a whole new light.  In fact it adds
complexity to his character over the one-dimensional do-gooder.  While
Batman is essentially out for vengeance against criminals in general,
Lamont Cranston had committed terrible evils and was driven by the need
to make amends.  I am not sure that this is what Walter Gibson had in
mind for his character, but it certainly works.</P>
<P>     The Shadow on radio was a little different from The Shadow in the
pulp magazines and The Shadow in the film is different from either.  I
do not remember any radio references to The Shadow having a network of
agents--I think there was more about them in the pulps.  Even on the
radio he did have his faithful cab driver Shrevie.  The Asian mysticism
that plays a big part in the film version was not usually apparent in
the radio series, though some of the pulps drew heavily on the Asian
origin of the The Shadow's powers.  Perhaps the most interesting
revision to the Canon is to give Margo psychic abilities also.  While
never explained it really adds interest to her relationship with Lamont.</P>
<P>     This may well be a piece of summer fluff, but I found it far more
engaging than the usual superhero film.  For once the power of the mind,
both psychic and reasoning, are as important to a hero as are his
physical powers.  And the image of the tall, crooked-nosed in Fedora and
cape whipping out guns will thrill rather than disappoint fans of The
Shadow.  This is the most I think I have ever enjoyed a "superhero"
film.  I give it a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.  (Oh, by the way, my
contact with The Shadow has been almost entirely in radio revivals of
the old series.  I am too young to have heard original broadcasts.)</P>
