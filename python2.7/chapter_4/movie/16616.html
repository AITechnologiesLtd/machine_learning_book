<PRE>Payback
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1999 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<P>There's an ancient occult art know as "glamour". Casting a spell of glamour
creates an illusion that hides the truth. The enchantment can make the plain
appear beautiful and a falsehood seem real. Leading practitioners of glamour
in the late Twentieth Century include make-up manufacturers and those guys who
create film previews.</P>
<P>Trailers for "Payback" look like a light Mel Gibson shoot-'em-up -- "Lethal
Weapon 4 1/2". It's not light. Worse, it's not even entertaining. When the
spell of glamour wears off, the truth rears its ugly head and this truth's
name is "tedium".</P>
<P>Low-life crooks Porter (Gibson), wife Lynn (Deborah Kara Unger) and buddy Val
(Gregg Henry) pull off a successful big-time heist. Successful, that is, until
Lynn shoots him in the back. Miraculously Porter survives and he's not happy.</P>
<P>Working his way up the food chain of the crime "outfit," he's looking for his
$70,000. In typical Gibson fashion, he gets battered, bruised, shot, crippled
and keeps on coming.</P>
<P>This isn't an action film. It's a shoot people in the forehead, smash their
feet with a sledge hammer and kick them while they're down film. Then as an
added bonus, they do it some more, but bloodier.</P>
<P>There's a feeble attempt to create a noir atmosphere, but it rarely works.
It's difficult to care. To have an emotional investment in the characters, the
audience has to be able to identify with them. Anyone who can identify with
Porter is certainly not someone I'd invite over for dinner.</P>
<P>The one sympathetic person in the film is Rosie (Maria Bello). Unfortunately
she's a minor character and an overworked cliche: a high-priced hooker with a
heart of gold for her boyfriend.</P>
<P>Remarkably for a movie that's filled with such ultra-violence, it's a dull
experience. Although there are a few bits that will make you cringe, there's a
sameness to nearly every scene. The exceptions feature Lucy Liu as a flashy
S&M dominatrix. These few stylish moments are such stand-outs they feel
stapled on from another film.</P>
<P>Your mileage may vary. My companions gave "Payback" the high praise of "not
horrible". They were wrong: it is.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman has written this column for over 23 years and has almost
recovered from a particularly vicious flu that he didn't enjoy much.
