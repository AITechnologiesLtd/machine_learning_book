<PRE>Teaching Mrs. Tingle
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Katie Holmes; Helen Mirren; Marisa Coughlan; Barry Watson & Liz
Stauber</P>
<P>There was a time when I thought Kevin Williamson was pretty much invincible
when it came to churning out quality material. I'm not sure if the man has
just overextended himself, or he has reached the end of his brilliance.
Either way, Teaching Mrs. Tingle marks the end of his current string of
excellent movies that he has been responsible for writing. With Teaching
Mrs. Tingle, Williamson takes on the role of director as well as his normal
role of writer. It almost seems that the two jobs were just a bit too much
for him. While his directorial debut is a competent, if unremarkable effort,
the screenplay is, at best, just slightly above average. And at times it
borders on bad. The story is a fairly ridiculous one, and the only thing
that saves it is that the characters are pretty good. But the true reason
that this movie doesn't die completely is the fine cast of actors that have
managed to save this film.</P>
<P>Katie Holmes plays Leigh Ann Watson, a very bright girl from an under
privileged family. Her only hope of ever getting out of her small town is to
become valedictorian of her high school graduating class. That way she can
score a big scholarship, which will be her only ticket to university. Sound
familiar to any of you? It should. This is almost the exact same character
that Holmes plays on Dawson's Creek -- a character that Kevin Williamson
created. I guess Kevin should get some credit for not ripping off somebody
else's characters. At least he had the decency to rip off his own work.
Anyway, Leigh Ann has one obstacle in her quest for her scholarship -- her
history teacher, Mrs. Tingle (Helen Mirren). Tingle is like every bad
teacher you've ever had all rolled into one. Tingle finds herself in the
position to ruin Leigh Ann's plans to better herself, and seems to take a
great deal of glee doing it. Actually, the reason that Tingle is going to
ruin Leigh Ann is fairly legitimate, but Williamson is hoping that you will
look past that minor inconvenience and just focus of the fact that Tingle is
a first class bitch. So Leigh Ann and her two friends, Jo Lynn (Marisa
Coughlan) and Luke (Barry Watson), decide to try to talk Tingle into giving
dear sweet Leigh Ann a second chance. But in the end they end up holding her
hostage in her own home. Unfortunately they aren't quite prepared for
dealing with Mrs. Tingle.</P>
<P>I'm not sure if this idiotic plot line was supposed to serve as the basis
for some sort of dark comedy, but it didn't work for me. As dumb as the
story was, I have to give Williamson credit for his characters. The
interaction between Tingle and her young captors was excellent. It was just
too bad that Williamson couldn't have found a better way of making this
story happen besides this very lame impromptu kidnapping.</P>
<P>While Katie Holmes and Barry Watson were the obvious audience draws in this
film, the real star is Helen Mirren. This woman plays her character to the
hilt. The best part of the movie was watching Mirren's Tingle play with her
captor's minds. Everyone in this film is great. That also includes Michael
McKean and Jeffrey Tambor in what amounted to glorified cameos. All were
good, but all could have been better if they had had a bit more to work
with. I never really got over the feeling that Holmes was just repeating a
recycled script from Dawson's Creek.</P>
<P>Williamson may have been doomed to fail on this movie. The film's release
came around the same time as the Columbine High School shooting in
Colorado -- prompting the producers to change the title of the film from
Killing Mrs. Tingle to Teaching Mrs. Tingle. I'm sure that little marketing
problem didn't help the film's chances at the box office. Then we have the
fairly schizophrenic way in which this movie was directed. Parts of it
almost seem to be played for pure comedy, while other parts are a failed
attempt at the darker side of humor. Then we have the director himself. For
an open homosexual, his direction certainly seemed to show a preoccupation
with Katie Holmes' breasts. Not that I'm complaining, it just seemed a bit
strange. (I guess if you have to be preoccupied with something, it might as
well be Katie Holmes' chest.)</P>
<P>High marks to the cast for keeping this sucker from going completely in the
crapper. With most of the praise leveled squarely at Mirren. If she hadn't
been so much fun to watch, I'm sure that I would have dozed off.
Williamson's characters were good; it's just that the situation that he put
them in took away from any positives that he brought to the table. My advice
is to skip Teaching Mrs. Tingle and check out another of Williamson's far
superior efforts. Keep an eye out for Holmes' future work. She hasn't found
the right film yet, but when she does, I guarantee you it will be something
to see.</P>
