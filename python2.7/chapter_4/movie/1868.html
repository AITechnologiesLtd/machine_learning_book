<P>     Avik (Jason Scott Lee) is a young Eskimo boy living with his tribe
in the Canadian Arctic.  One day in 1931, Walter (Patrick Bergin)
arrives there as the head of a British mapping expedition.  He
befriends Avik and, when the boy becomes gravely ill, flies him back to
Montreal for treatment.  There, Avik meets Albertine (Anne Parillaud).
After their initial encounters as adversaries, the two become fast
friends.  Eventually, they are separated, but Avik vows never to forget
her.  Over a decade later, during his stint as a bomber pilot during
the second world war, the two meet again.</P>
<P>     MAP OF THE HUMAN HEART is a sentimental love story with a
generally downbeat tone.  The story is framed around a series of
coincidences, not all of which are believable, but many of which can be
overlooked.  There is a certain epic sweep to this film which many
"dramatic romances" lack.  The emotional impact of MAP OF THE HUMAN
HEART, while existing, is minor.  The characters remain too distanced
from the audience.</P>
<P>     The most obvious problem with MAP OF THE HUMAN HEART is its
editing.  Of all the films I've seen in recent years, only the
Salkinds' Christopher Columbus movie rivals this for cutting room
butchering.  In this case, the final product is so disjointed that at
times the transitions (or lack thereof) are laughably absurd.  The
original European version of this movie is significantly longer.  While
the overall quality of that picture may not be better than the one
distributed by Miramax, it certainly must flow better.</P>
<P>     Character interaction is marginal.  I think the editing impacted
on this, as it did on just about everything else.  We see skeletons of
relationships, but none--not even the central one between Avik and
Albertine--is developed satisfactorily.  Especially weak is the
interaction between Avik and Walter.  For MAP OF THE HUMAN HEART to
really work, we have to be able to accept that there is a deep and
abiding love between these two, a sort of father/son relationship.
Unfortunately, we see little evidence of this.</P>
<P>     Early in the movie, there is an aspect of the production that I
found irritating--all the more so because it is unnecessary.  During
the scenes when Albertine is a young girl, her lines have been dubbed
by Anne Parillaud.  There's no rhyme or reason for this, and the
dubbing is not so well done that it isn't noticeable.  As minor a point
as this is, I found it distracting.</P>
<P>     In general, the movie seems to be full of half-realized themes and
ideas.  Questions of identity are touched on, but the subject is never
pursued to its conclusion.  Cut short is a potentially-powerful scene
where a member of a bomber crew is forced to experience firsthand the
devastation he has wrought.  Even truncated as it is, this scene still
packs a punch.</P>
<P>     One thing that can't be denied, and that not even the editing can
take away, is how beautifully this movie has been filmed.  The shots of
dozens of gigantic bombers drifting over a flaming Dresden is as
effective as any similar scene in another war picture, and the brief
aerial battles are the equal of those from MEMPHIS BELLE.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, while the shots from the outside of the planes
during the bombing raids are excellent, the interior ones are not.
Hardly any of the dialogue is intelligible and it's difficult to figure
out what's happening.  While I can appreciate the director's desire to
capture the "feeling" of such a chaotic environment, it isn't a good
idea to do so at the price of utterly confounding the audience.</P>
<P>     The acting is as uneven as everything else in the movie.  The
child actors who take up much of the early screen time are merely
passable, and their adult counterparts aren't much better.  Anne
Parillaud is especially disappointing, as she overacts her way through
the part (much in the same way that she did in INNOCENT BLOOD, a movie
where over-the-top was demanded).  Patrick Bergin goes in the other
direction, appearing distressingly unemotional.  Jason Scott Lee,
perhaps the most consistent of the major participants, exudes very
little charisma in this role.  John Cusack, who gets billing for a
cameo appearance, is on screen for a total of about four minutes.</P>
<P>     Overall, MAP OF THE HUMAN HEART is a mixed bag.  None of its
elements works all the time, but neither is it a complete failure.  The
romance alone doesn't have the emotional power to recommend the film,
but WW2 buffs may find in this production a mildly entertaining
diversion.  MAP OF THE HUMAN HEART is sometimes sappy and silly, and
often poorly-transitioned, but at least it generally isn't boring.</P>
