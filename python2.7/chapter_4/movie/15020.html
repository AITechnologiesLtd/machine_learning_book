<PRE>GODS AND MONSTERS
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1998 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>        Poor little Jimmy Whale.</PRE>
<P>        Being pulled from his north of England boarding school and forced
to work in a factory to support his family; watching his best friend die
before his eyes, hung like a side of mutton on a barbed wire fence during a
Great War skirmish; interred in a prisoner of war camp; and, throughout all
this, having to shoulder what was then the burdensome stigma of
homosexuality.</P>
<PRE>        It's enough to turn a man to madness.</PRE>
<P>        It was certainly enough to turn this particular man towards
Hollywood, where he attempted to unleash his demons, his "electrical storms
in the brain," through the creative and cathartic process of film making.</P>
<P>        By the time he took his own life in 1957, James Whale, the
legendary director of "Frankenstein," "The Bride of Frankenstein" and other
classic movies from Hollywood's Golden Age (including, believe it or not,
"Show Boat"), was seriously ill.  He had also fallen from grace from the
studio system that had created him, living out his years as a painter of
portraits and still lives.</P>
<P>        "Gods and Monsters" is a speculative account of the last days of
this iconographic filmmaker.  It entertains the notion that Whale, who was
slowly losing his mind, might not have acted alone and that his final act
may have included more than a walk-on for his gardener, Clayton Boone
(Brendan Fraser).  While this idea is certainly an imaginative one, the
journey to that point as envisioned by writer/director Bill Condon, is less
intriguing, unfolding like a Playgirl magazine-styled hybrid of "Ed Wood"
and "Love and Death on Long Island."</P>
<P>        The ailing, disillusioned Whale is brought to life by that great
English thespian, Sir Ian McKellen.  McKellen conveys more with a raised
eyebrow than Fraser does with his entire body.  It's an authoritative
performance, much like Ian Hurt's was in "Love and Death...," but the film
suffers the same fate of spending entirely too much time focusing on the
not terribly fascinating theme of a lustful, aging queen salivating over an
unsophisticated, impressionable boy-toy.</P>
<P>        With the more interesting background material left underdeveloped,
we're given to assume that any gay war veteran with a rough childhood would
opt for a career making horror movies.</P>
<P>        For all of the interesting possibilities inherent in Condon's
source material, the single most important thing one learns about James
Whale, according to the film, was that he was a dirty old man.  His
Germanic, longtime domestic help Hanna (Lynn Redgrave, who steals every
scene she's in) stands by dutifully yet disapprovingly as Whale talks the
sweaty, muscular Boone into posing for him.  "Just your head," he tells him.</P>
<P>        And it certainly is a great head.  During one fantasy sequence,
Whale and Boone, silhouetted as they stagger across a barren, war-torn
landscape, are uncanny in their resemblance to Colin Clive and Boris
Karloff as Frankenstein's monster and it's at times like these, when Condon
takes the time to parallel scenes from Whales' movies, that "Gods and
Monsters" comes alive.  More of this, and less of the idle sexual entendres
(take that dueling cigar sequence for example), would have made for more
engrossing cinema.</P>
<P>        Neither the temptations of the flesh nor the final seduction of
death paint a compelling portrait of the multi-talented James Whale.  "Gods
and Monsters" makes that abundantly clear, but it misses an opportunity to
tell us more about the true father of Frankenstein.</P>
