<P>A Film Review by Mark O'Hara

<P>During our vacation to Ireland, we toured the grounds of a castle and 
had tea and brown bread in a white-washed, thatched cottage.  At one bed 
and breakfast, I discovered that the 'presence at the lake' mentioned in 
the travel book was a story trumped up for tourists.</P>
<P>What I'm suggesting is the Irish can be very conscious of the stereotype 
that names their country a quaint place and their culture a constant 
source of charm.  I can think of a dozen films shot in Ireland, films 
whose stories are enhanced by the natural beauty.</P>
<P>One might go into 'Waking Ned Devine' skeptical about another narrative 
recording the adventures of colorful townspeople outwitting a more 
powerful force.  It's been done, hasn't it now?</P>
<P>The thing is, "Waking Ned Devine' does it so well that I forgot clichés 
and lost myself in laughter.</P>
<P>Jackie O'Shea (Ian Bannen) and Michael O'Sullivan (David Kelly) have 
maps of Ireland all over their faces and aging bodies.  In one of the 
funniest touches of farce in recent film, we see them on speeding 
motorcycles - one completely naked and the other almost there.  This gag 
is only one in a series of quirky moments.  Whether the pair is involved 
with inserting a dead man's dentures or eulogizing one still among the 
living, these actors are natural and believably human.  Bannen perfects 
his expressions as a man who can be crafty or wise.  Kelly is cast well 
as the mild Michael who never tells a lie but must utter one the size of 
the Ring of Kerry.</P>
<P>The early episodes of the film lightheartedly follow the exploits of the 
friends as they attempt to find the winner of the Irish lottery.  From 
the newspaper they know someone in their hamlet of Tullymore has  won.  
In a few delicious and cynical sequences we observe Jackie and wife 
Annie (Fionnula Flanagan) cozying up to neighbors they think might be 
the new millionaire.  Annie bakes a meat pie, while Jackie treats the 
drinkers at Fitzgerald's to 50 pounds worth of rounds.  All this for 
nothing, as Jackie discovers it is Ned Devine who has the lucky numbers.</P>
<P>If we were face to face, I'd lean toward you with this detail, me finger 
in yer buttonhole:  Ned Devine is dead!</P>
<P>Here's the genesis of the elaborate ruse, as Jackie and Michael scheme 
to claim the money for themselves.  So we see the nude dashes on a 
motorcycle, Michael's whiskey-induced courage, Jackie's temporary exile 
from his own house, all in the name of duplicity.  The comedy becomes 
even broader when the lottery official (Brendan F. Dempsey) must verify 
Ned Devine's identity - he will return to the town and question some of 
its 52 residents.  Will it work when the old liars attempt to lure the 
entire population into collusion?</P>
<P>It's not only in scenes with the two old friends that director Kirk 
Jones displays solid comic timing.  It's also when he's directing what 
amounts to an ensemble cast of fine actors.  There's a boy who has 
precocious discussions with a priest.  A pub owner/appliance repairman 
who won't return a toaster to the biddy who won't pay for it.  And in 
the subplot dealing with love, Pig Finn (James Nesbitt) is continually 
pleading with raven-haired Maggie (Susan Lynch) to ignore the stench of 
pigs on him, refuse the attentions of another suitor, and marry the one 
she really loves.  </P>
<P>The characters and the ways they are developed enlarge the quality of 
the film.  Sketching in secondary characters - in addition to extras to 
flesh out the 52 residents - is risky by successful.  </P>
<P>Music accompanies many scenes appropriately.  Flutes and whistles extend 
the cultural trademark of instruments.  A scene in which a lone 
recorder-player precedes four pall bearers, their arms joined under the 
real Ned Devine's coffin, smacks of self-parody.  To tell the truth, I 
wouldn't mind adding the soundtrack of this film to the slot beside my 
Chieftains CDs.</P>
<P>A slight problem with tone arises at the end.  Foreshadowing frequently 
lets us know that these characters are capable of wacky behaviors.  But 
one bit of dark humor - although unchallenged in its hilarity -goes 
somewhat too far over-the-top.</P>
<P>If you are fond of things Irish, you'll love 'Waking Ned Devine.'  It's 
being hyped as a small, brilliant film, but its narrative devices and 
focused acting make it more than a bit of blarney and brogue.</P>
