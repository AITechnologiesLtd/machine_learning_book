<P>_Reach_the_Rock_ (R) * 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>"An intimate, character-driven drama about a troubled youth at a
crossroads in his life," read the press notes for _Reach_the_Rock_.  I'm
not really sure what film that statement is describing because those words
bear little resemblance to the slow, completely uninvolving bore I saw--at
least, it certainly does not describe what goes on for most of the film.
Alessandro Nivola plays Robin Fleming, a troubled, directionless
21-year-old who has a penchant for breaking storefront windows in a small
town.  Police sergeant Phil Quinn (William Sadler) takes him in, and what
ensues for the first 70 minutes is a tedious series of sneak-outs and
sneak-ins where Robin slips out of his jail cell, breaks a window, then
returns, all without Quinn ever noticing.  Also added to the pointless
proceedings is some would-be humorous shenanigans involving Quinn's
dimwitted deputy Ernie attempting to engage in clandestine patrol car sex
with his girlfriend Donna (Karen Sillas). </P>
<P>With a half hour (if even that long) remaining, director William Ryan and
writer John Hughes (yes, John Hughes of '80s youth films and _Home_Alone_)
finally approach something close to a point.  Turns out Robin still pines
for his high school sweetheart Lise (Brooke Langton), who has long gone on
with her life, and Hughes's main concern at long last reveals itself as a
tired "live in the present and for the future" message.  Most moviegoers,
however, will likely be asleep by that time.  Wide awake, however, is the
cast, who individually tackle their showcase dramatic scenes with energy
and skill--thus revealing the _real_ purpose behind this listless
enterprise: to serve as a series of acting exercises.  Such a glorified
workshop may have its rewards for the actors, but it leaves audiences with
a booby prize.  (opens October 16)</P>
