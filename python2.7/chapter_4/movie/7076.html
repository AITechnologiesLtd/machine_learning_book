<P>     Whenever film fans learn of plans by an American studio to re-make a
foreign language film, the common reaction is a collective cringe.
Wonderful foreign films like THE VANISHING and DIABOLIQUE have been turned
into big-budget garbage, as Hollywood tends to grab on to a plot without
grasping the point.  The prospect of a remake of UN INDIEN DANS LA VILLE
(LITTLE INDIAN, BIG CITY), however, inspired cringes of a different kind.
The 1996 American theatrical release of LITTLE INDIAN inspired some of the
most savage reviews of the year, making the prospect of the Disney-fied
version JUNGLE 2 JUNGLE almost too much to bear.  Hollywood could only
improve on the original this time around, but it hasn't improved enough.
JUNGLE 2 JUNGLE is a dopey and predictable family comedy which could be
thought of as disappointing, if not for the wretchedness of the source
material.</P>
<P>     Tim Allen stars as Michael Cromwell, a Wall Street commodities broker
with a non-stop lifestyle.  He barely has time in his schedule to finalize
his divorce from his first wife Patricia (JoBeth Williams) -- who left him
for medical work in the Amazon -- so that he can marry his current
girlfriend Charlotte (Lolita Davidovich).  When Michael reaches Venezuela,
he finds quite a surprise waiting for him:  a 13-year-old son named Mimi
Siku (Sam Huntington) who has spent his entire life in the jungle.  A
hastily made promise lands Michael the task of taking Mimi Siku back to
New York with him for a visit, but Michael still has little time to teach
his newfound son about life in the concrete jungle, especially when
Michael and his partner Richard (Martin Short) get in hot water trying to
dump a load of coffee futures on the Russian mafia.</P>
<P>     Yes, you read correctly, the Russian mafia.  JUNGLE 2 JUNGLE
certainly doesn't take any chances on having too few plot threads,
offering up David Ogden Stiers as the menacing mafioso, an entourage of
film-makers following Michael's fashion designer fiancee Charlotte, a
romantic interest for Mimi Siku in Richard's daughter Karen (LeeLee
Sobieski, who _will_ be cast some day as a young Helen Hunt) and a pet
tarantula who makes trouble any time things get slow.  There is a lot of
going on to keep everyone busy, but even at its busiest JUNGLE 2 JUNGLE
simply isn't funny very often.  The gags in the script by Bruce A. Evans
and Raynold Gideon (previously responsible for masterworks like KUFFS and
CUTTHROAT ISLAND) include tired pokes at postal employees, foreign cab
drivers and the battle of the sexes over leaving the toilet seat up.  It
sometimes seems as though most of the film was transcribed from
10-year-old Jerry Seinfeld routines.</P>
<P>     It's hard to believe that after waiting over two years to follow up
his $144 million film debut in THE SANTA CLAUSE, Tim Allen decided this
was the script he couldn't pass up.  JUNGLE 2 JUNGLE (directed by THE
SANTA CLAUSE's John Pasquin) once again finds Allen playing a workaholic
who requires extraordinary circumstances to teach him lessons in
fatherhood, but THE SANTA CLAUSE gave Allen a unique set-up and clever
situations to work with.  JUNGLE 2 JUNGLE doesn't give him nearly as much
good material, relying on standard fish-out-of-water scenarios -- Mimi
Siku dines on cat food and tropical fish, hunts pigeons and climbs on the
outside of skyscrapers -- and a healthy serving of pratfalls.  Allen has
many comic talents, including fine timing with an exasperated one-liner,
but he is not particularly deft at physical comedy.  When co-star Martin
Short throws his tiny body at a locked door in a futile attempt to break
it down, you see what a real physical comedian looks like; Allen just
looks like he realizes he is much smarter than this material.</P>
<P>     Everyone in JUNGLE 2 JUNGLE does thoroughly likeable work in their
one-dimensional roles, which is probably as much as you should expect from
the performances in a film of this kind.  JUNGLE 2 JUNGLE is intended
primarily for kids, of course, and it does offer some appealing bits.
Most of the best ones involve Michael's ineptitude with Mimi Siku's
sleep-inducing blow darts, including a very funny struggle to revive
Charlotte's anesthetized cat.  The same kids who find that sequence
hilarious probably won't be able to make heads or tails out of the big
deal over some coffee, however, nor are they really a proper audience for
swishy gay stereotypes or jokes about flatulence and penis size.  There
just didn't seem to be much thought put into JUNGLE 2 JUNGLE except to
give it just enough tailoring to make it a Tim Allen vehicle.  Considering
that the original outfit they were working with was a cinematic polyester
suit like LITTLE INDIAN, BIG CITY, it might have been a better idea to
throw it all away and start from whole cloth.</P>
