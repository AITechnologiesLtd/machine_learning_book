<P>All of a sudden, movies like Good Will Hunting and Cube have
made mathematics and mathematical theory both exciting and sexy.
First time feature writer/director Darren Aronofsky uses complex
mathematical theories as the basis for the plot of Pi, his ambitious,
but off beat and unsettling low budget thriller.</P>
<P>Highly strung number theorist and computer whiz Max Cohen
(Sean Gullette) sees patterns everywhere in nature.  He is obsessed
with discovering a code that will crack open the secrets of the stock
market.  His holy grail is the 216 digit number that will supposedly
unlock the secrets of the universe.  Max refuses to heed his ailing
mentor (Mark Margolis), who warns him of the folly of pursuing his
quest.  Somehow his search brings him into contact with a shadowy Wall
Street firm that want to use his expertise, and some renegade Hassidic
Jews who want to unlock the centuries old key to their religion.  They
believe that Max's research will enable them to see the face of God.
Gullette, who shares a screen writing credit for the film, gives an
unnerving and edgy performance that captures the desperate and
disturbed air of this unusual protagonist.</P>
<P>Pi is not an action thriller, despite a chase sequence filmed
with the stop motion style of photography championed by Chris Doyle
and Hong Kong cinema.  Rather, this is a challenging and cerebral,
paranoid sci-fi fable for our times.  The film raises a number or
questions about our soulless contemporary society and its obsession
with technology.  Pi also deftly mixes complex mathematical concepts
with religion, but the film risks becoming inaccessible.  Aronofsky
seems to become too clever in exploring the film's intelligent yet
complex themes, and he does not hand out easy answers.  His
deliberately allusive structure and elusive images will potentially
alienate many within the audience.
          Much of the film takes place inside Max's cramped, over
crowded apartment, where he hides from the real world behind his
locked door.  This gives the film a claustrophobic feel.  The banks of
computer equipment that line his apartment also lend something of an
otherworldly feel to this environment.  Aronofsky also imbues the film
with an uneasy air of paranoia.  Matthew Libatique's cool, sparse
black and white cinematography evokes the look and feel of the film
noir of the 50's and '60's.</P>
