<PRE>                      WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE
                       A film review by Jon Webb
                        Copyright 1994 Jon Webb</PRE>
<P>     WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE is a sensitive, honest portrayal of
what would be called a "dysfunctional" family: grossly overweight
mother, retarded son, two daughters trying to get past it all, and the
older son, played by Johnny Depp, who is trying to hold everything
together.  The main point of the film is that such a family is not as
dysfunctional as it seems, when you look below the surface.</P>
<P>     The most outstanding things about this film are the performance by
Leonardo di Caprio of the retarded son--had I not seen him in THIS
BOY'S LIFE I would have thought he must be like that, somehow--and
the portrayal of the mother in the screenplay and on the screen by
Darlene Cates.  I never have seen a woman with a physical deformity
shown in as loving, though non-sentimental, a light.  This alone is
reason enough to see the film.</P>
<P>     I thought the film was only good on the whole, though, because of
inconsistent quality in the direction.  The romance between Depp and
Juliette Lewis was never completely convincing for me, and Mary
Steenburgen's character was too cartoonish.</P>
<P>     I liked the meeting between Gilbert and the insurance man, as
being surprisingly real, and thought Crispin Glover stole every scene
he was part of (he plays a too-enthusiastic mortician.)  The resolution
of the conflict in the film is also very believable and compelling.</P>
