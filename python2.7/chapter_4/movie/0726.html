                            MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1990 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  The story of one of the great
     expeditions of history--and of the controversy that
     surrounded it--is brought to the screen spectacularly and
     intelligently.  While the film takes a few liberties with the
     facts, I found it a better adventure tale than THE HUNT FOR
     RED OCTOBER and give or take a fact or two, it is all a true
     story.  Rating: +3.</PRE>
<P>     The Nile River came like a miracle out of the desert, the last place
you would expect a great river, to bring life to the great Egyptian
civilization.  That civilization was a major world power--often *the* major
world power--for 3500 years, and it was totally dependent on the enigmatic
Nile, the only major river that flows south to north.  Even today the Nile
means life or death to countries in its path.  Not surprisingly, when
Europeans came to Africa they were fascinated by this strange river and in
particular, where the waters originated.  But it was time when tracing the
river to its origins meant an expedition on foot under nearly impossible
conditions.  And the only reward would be to go down in the history books as
being the one who answered the great question: "Where did the waters of the
Nile come from?"  When the question finally was answered, it was only at
very great cost and it was an answer that would remain shrouded in
controversy for almost two decades.  MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON is an intelligent
yet visually spectacular adventure film about the expedition to find the
source of the Nile.  It is about Sir Richard Francis Burton and John Hanning
Speke, two very different men who made that expedition, and the controversy
that came out of that expedition.</P>
<P>     The film covers much of the same territory that the excellent BBC
mini-series "The Search for the Nile" covered in 1971 (and wouldn't this be
a good time for someone to rebroadcast that series?).  It is the story of
how Burton and Speke came to go on such a perilous expedition, of the
experiences on the trek, and of the bitter controversy that arose from their
different conclusions about the sources of the Nile.</P>
<P>     Sir Richard Burton was perhaps the most colorful explorer and
anthropologist of all times and the film hardly does justice to the man's
history.  Burton had fluency in dozens of languages and was sufficiently
good at the art of disguise that he could make himself appear to be a native
through much of the world.  Disguised as an Afghani, he was the first
European to enter Mecca and Medina.  He had an unquenchable thirst to learn
about other cultures first-hand, especially their sexual practices--in which
he both observed and participated--and their erotic literature.  He was an
eloquent writer and translator, but because of his fixation on the sexual,
many of his writings and translations were considered unsuitable in British
society.  His was the definitive translation of the "Arabian Nights" and it
accurately has far more sex and violence than the expurgated versions
generally available. Burton was a giant man with giant vices.</P>
<P>     On the other hand, John Speke was a petty man with petty vices.  His
greatest passion was for hunting and he looked upon Africa in large part as
one big game park populated with animals he could shoot and populated with
savages best avoided.  Where Burton had a thirst for knowledge about other
cultures, Speke had an attitude of inflexible superiority that more than
once put his life in danger.</P>
<P>     William Harrison's 1983 novel BURTON AND SPEKE (recently re-issued as
MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON) shows much more the personality conflict between
these two men and only vaguely hints that they may have had a grudging
respect and even an affection for each other.  Curiously, this film written
by Harrison together with director Bob Rafelson--based on the novel and on
the logs the two men kept of the expedition--reverses that viewpoint.  It
says the two were actually close friends and the post-expedition conflict
about the interpretation of their findings was due more to English society
wishing to take the opinions of an Englishman, Speke, over those of Burton.
Burton was, after all, an Irishman, a free thinker, and a writer of what
English society considered pornography.  Harrison seems to have changed his
mind between writing the book and the screenplay--or had it changed by
Rafelson--about what were Burton's and Speke's attitudes toward each other.
The irony of the conflict, of course, is that while reading the book and
probably while seeing the film you want to believe Burton, it was Speke's
interpretation that this "Lake Victoria" was the actual source that was
vindicated.  Speke's measurements were eventually found to be essentially
accurate and his conclusions were correct.</P>
<P>     The film's two main characters are powerfully played by Patrick Bergin
as Burton and Iain Glen as Speke, both relatively new to American audiences.
The film also has a good cast of supporting characters.  In a film with two
such interesting main characters, it would be quite easy for Fiona Lewis to
go unnoticed as Burton's stay-at-home lover and later wife Isabel.  Not so,
however.  Shaw's Isabel is a major character fiercely loyal to an idealized
image of her husband, an image of which even the great Richard Burton fell
short.  Shaw's expression when seeing Burton seems to convey an emotion
combining joy and astonishment, the same expression she used as Christy
Brown's teacher in MY LEFT FOOT.  The original Isabel Burton was by all
accounts a remarkable woman totally willing to turn a blind eye to her
husband's philandering just to be married to Burton.  Eventually her
unquestioning loyalty shamed her husband into monogamy.  On the night he
died, she burned a priceless collection of his unpublished notes and forty-
one unpublished manuscripts in a misguided effort to preserve her dead
husband's reputation.</P>
<P>     Somewhat understated in the film as well as all European accounts of
the expeditions is the presence of Sidi Bombay, at this point an
inexperienced African hired by Burton and Speke as a guide and treated very
poorly by Speke, but who went on to become one of Africa's great explorers.</P>
<P>     The film's account of the great expedition, much abridged from the
novel and logs, remains harrowing and gives a feel for the courage it must
have required to venture into Africa on foot in 1857.  The most horrifying
sequence, for me all the more so since I had previously read the account in
both Harrison's novel and in Burton's account of the expedition, was the
incident that resulted in Speke losing his hearing in one ear.  Nearly as
disturbing is the account of why Burton had to be carried and of the
primitive first aid.  (I will withhold the details of these incidents for
the benefit of readers who do not yet know the story.)  All along the way,
there are contacts with the local tribes, each with its own culture, and
many of whom were not happy to see strangers.  The stories of the three
expeditions, naturally, had to be greatly abbreviated for the film--in fact,
we are only told that the third expedition took place--but what we do see is
sufficient for good storytelling.</P>
<P>     Harrison and Rafelson's screenplay, while based on the novel and the
expedition logs seem to have invented details not in either.  At one point
in a speech, Burton says that no white man can claim to have discovered a
body of water well-known to the local tribes.  Even for Burton with his
enlightened views, this would seem an anachronistic viewpoint.  In actual
point of fact it is not the discovery of the body of water that was
important so much as its association with the river that is the lifeblood of
Egypt, and Speke really was the first person to make the association that
the two really were the same body of water.  He also gathered reasonable
evidence for that point of view.  As much as we would like to credit both
the local tribesmen and Burton over the priggish Anglo-chauvinist Speke, it
really is Speke to whom the credit belongs.  As a side note, Burton's views
toward Africa were less enlightened than his attitudes toward Arab peoples.
As Robert Collins observes in his 1967 introduction to Burton's THE NILE
BASIN:</P>
<P>          Burton's insatiable appetite for travel soon brought him
     to Africa.  He observed Africa and the Africans at best with
     the assumptions of a Victorian Englishman, at worst with the
     attitudes of an Arab slave trader.  Not surprisingly, he
     judged African culture, which he made no attempt to
     understand, as hopelessly inferior to the Asian and European
     civilizations he knew so well.  African customs, manners, and
     morals repulsed him, perhaps because they did not fit his
     preconceived notions of civilization.  Moreover, he never
     sought to separate race and culture.  Thus African cultural
     inferiority became obvious proof of African racial
     inferiority.</P>
<P>          This "Afrophobia" led Burton, as well as other
     Englishmen, to place Africans at the bottom of the
     evolutionary scale of national and racial development.  True,
     Burton was sufficiently condescending to consider Africans
     human beings, but humans of the lowest kind.  He argued that
     only through emigration, or, perhaps, by the adoption of
     Islam, could they hope for salvation.  Burton's bigoted ideas
     of African inferiority colored all of his writings about
     Africa, and the more he saw and learned, or rather
     mislearned, the more vicious became his contempt for the
     continent.  One should not read Richard Burton without
     keeping in mind this deep-seated prejudice.</P>
<P>     It is perhaps a pity that MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON should be released
withing days of another adventure film, THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER.  Since I
had read both novels, it was MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON that I was more looking
forward to.  My reasons were at least two-fold.  First, however
realistically Tom Clancy writes and however well-researched his facts were,
THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER is fiction and the Burton-Speke expedition is
authentic history.  It really happened.  Harrison had some latitude with the
interpretation of events but most of what we are seeing is true.  The
second, and perhaps more important, reason was that Clancy's heroes sit in
large and relatively comfortable machines and play out their game.  True, if
they lose they die, but if they win the only price they have paid is that
they are exhausted.  Arguably most of the impressive feats are done by the
machinery.  But to set off on foot across mid-19th Century Africa with no
more defense than a few rifles requires a different character of courage.
Burton and Speke set out knowing that even if they found the source of the
Nile, by the time they returned Africa would have eaten a big piece of each
of them.  Speke could not predict that he would have to mutilate horribly
his own ear and leave himself deaf; Burton could not predict the diseases he
would be stricken with, but that or something just as bad was nearly
inevitable.  And Burton and Speke went anyway because a question had to be
answered.  To that degree they were greater heroes than Tom Clancy's
fictional imaginings.  And yet they were real people.  And to find not one
but two different books by Burton describing his expeditions in his own
words I needed to go no further than my public library.</P>
<P>     Because I had greater expectations for MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON than for
THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, I knew it was much more likely that I would be
disappointed by Rafelson's film.  Surprisingly, MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON came
much closer to meeting my high expectations that THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER
came to meeting lower ones.  Rafelson, whose earlier films were very
different low-budget films (FIVE EASY PIECES and STAY HUNGRY), has made an
intelligent adventure film to be savored for years to come.  I rate it a +3
on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
