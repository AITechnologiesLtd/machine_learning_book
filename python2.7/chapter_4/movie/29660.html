<P>   As Burt Bacharach and Hal David advise in the song "Do You
Know the Way to San Jose," "L.A. is a great big freeway/ Put a
hundred down and buy a car/ In a week maybe two they'll make
you a star/ Weeks turn into years and quickly pass/ And all the
stars there never were are parking cars and pumping gas..."</P>
<P>   "Mulholland Drive" puts those now overly-familiar lyrics into
pictures.  The movie, by one of the most inventive or American
directors, is about a naive, perky, Doris-Day type of woman with
short blond hair who travels to Hollywood from her native Ontario
in search of stardom.  What she finds is pretty much the fate of
most women who seek fame and fortune in a industry that chews
up women and spits them out.  If that were all there is to Lynch's
latest film--which blends the surreal with the actual--"Mulholland
Drive" would be a pretty simple tale, but this movie, which is
bound to be one of the most talked-about puzzlers of the year, is
a complex one, one which despite its languid pace and 2-1/2
hour length does not overstay its welcome, and one which lends
itself to perhaps four distinct interpretations.</P>
<P>   Lynch, whose flamboyant "Blue Velvet," about a kinky nightclub
singer and a sadistic drug dealer presents a look behind a
Norman Rockwell American town; and whose "Lost Highway,"
about a jazz musician, suspecting that his wife is having an affair
and becomes a suspect in her murder--are also tales that could
be spun in simplistic ways but subject themselves to what is now
known as Lynchisms.  Lynchisms are stylistic touches fabricated
by the 55-year-old creator of "Eraserhead," "Dune," and "The
Elephant Man" among other unconventional works that make the
man's films incomprehensible to some, repulsive to others, and
brilliant to still a third group.  This split pretty much sums up the
reactions of critics who discussed the film after seeing an
advance screening, comments  running the gamut form
"pretentious" to "a master stroke."  My own view if that
"Mulholland Drive" is a film to respect, one about which perhaps
a small segment of the audience can become wowed while
others (like me) can admire the originality and stylistic fetishes
albeit without great enthusiasm.</P>
<P>    "Mulholland Drive," which was chosen as the centerpiece to be
presented at the 2001 New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center,
focuses on the astonishing Naomi Watts in the role of Betty, a
sprightly blonde who arrives in Hollywood with stars in her eyes
and a wish of luck from an elderly couple who have befriended
her on the flight south but who laugh behind her back when she
leaves.  Taking a room lent to her by her aunt, she runs into a
brunette woman perhaps a little older than she who calls herself
Rita (Laura Elena Harring) but is suffering from amnesia which
results from the shock of witnessing a fatal car accident which
kills the man who is about to execute her.  The picture opens with
the perhaps most athletic dance contests ever shown on the
screen followed by a loud crash of a head-on collision, but from
there this character-driven piece becomes increasingly intricate,
eerie, suspenseful and sexy as Rita and Betty, who at first share
the latter's spacious digs under the watchful eye of manager
Coco Lenoix (Ann Miller), become lovers.</P>
<P>   To illustrate the way a multi-layered Hollywood power
apparatus masticates all in its path, Lynch hones in on a film
director, Adam Kosher (Justin Theroux), who at first refuses to
cast an actress in his new film and is then persuaded by a man
behind the scenes of the studio head (played by Dan Hedaya) to
choose that gangster's favorite for the role.  When Rita, realizing
that she is still in danger and dons a blond wig over her brunette
hair and makes love to her roommate Betty, we in the audience
see the mutual dependence of the two personalities after which
the film sinks arrestingly into a reality-meets-dream world of
illusion and actuality.  The big kick comes when the director does
an about face, changing the identities of the women as the perky
Betty's face mirrors her conversion to that of a woman
possessed by envy, hatred, and downright evil inclinations.  So
good is Naomi Watts in the lead role, so convincing is her
descent from Canadian small-time naivete into a thoroughly
corrupted, even vicious demon, that her very conversion will
inevitably cause the film world to debate and ponder what Lynch
has in mind. My fondest hope is that Mr. Lynch does not mean
for us to take any large part of his story as a character's dream--
in a dream, anything is possible: role reversals, fluid identities--so
that we in the audience can accept any and all interpretations
given our freedom to discard all logic.  My own view is that the
picture means primarily to illustrate the nature of power plays:
Betty, helping Rita, makes herself beholden to the helpless
brunette.  The financiers, telling the director, "this is the girl,"
show their strength in determining how a picture gets made. 
Adam Kosher's discovery of his wife in bed with another man
gives him an edge, but the reaction of the wife's muscular partner
changes the picture.  Add to this the notion that Betty is no more
than name of the blonde than Rita is the name of her new friend. 
We are led to believe that "Betty" is merely the dream-like
fantasy of one Diane Selwyn, who imagines herself an innocent
femme seeking her way in Hollywood.</P>
<P>   Peter Deming films the action with an emphasis on close-ups,
focusing on the eyes of the two principal women as audience
clues to their emotions, all backed up by Angelo Badalamenti's
non-intrusive and effective score.  </P>
<P>Rated R.  Running time: 146 minutes.  (C) 2001 by
