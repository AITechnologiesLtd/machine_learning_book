<P>PLOT:
A single mom songstress who's been moving from loser boyfriend to loser
boyfriend for years with her teenage daughter, meets a nice ex-fisherman in
Alaska, caught up in his own past demons. When the man's deadbeat
half-brother takes them all out for a boat ride, the film suddenly switches
gears, and turns into an all-out battle of self-discovery and survival.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
People will be divided on this film. On the one hand, it is a wonderfully
photographed picture set in a lush environment not often caught on film,
Alaska, with genuine performances from all of its main leads, interesting
characters and an ending that might have you appreciating its fresh
unconventionality. On the other hand, it's basically a movie featuring an
Alaskan fisherman who falls for an over-the-hill folkie singer with a messed
up daughter, that runs a little over 125 minutes, moves at a slow pace, and
might have many people screaming "foul" after its anti-Hollywood ending. I
personally reside somewhere in between these two views (I guess you could
say that I'm in "limbo" over my opinion....hehe....sorry, but I had to!),
with heavy kudos to Vanessa Martinez, who played the daughter, John Sayles
for executing an interesting character study inside an unexciting
environment (for me, at least), and the ending, which initially left me
feeling betrayed, but ultimately challenged me to think about the deeper
meaning of this film's message.</P>
<P>The actual goal of the film wasn't to tidy things up nice and cozy, it was
to present us with the lives of various characters interacting amongst one
another under different life experiences, motivations and vulnerabilities.
In the end, I felt as though many of their innermost fears had been
conquered and they were ready to take on the world/or disappear from it. If
you are the type of person who does not like films with open-ended finishes,
you will probably HATE this movie! I personally found it to be a little long
for my taste (I think they could have cut some parts of the daughter reading
endlessly out of the diary), a little boring in others, but overall, it
didn't dull me as much as I thought it would. The screenwriter and actors
should be commended for that, since it was their characters who sparked that
subtle interest within me. All in all, think character study meets THE EDGE
(7.5/10) with an ending that nobody can agree on.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
John Sayles has been nominated for an Oscar on two occasions for Best
Screenplay, one for PASSION FISH and the other for LONE STAR. He is also
well known to support himself as a Hollywood script doctor, and has written
numerous scripts for other directors including THE CHALLENGE for John
Frankenheimer and BREAKING IN for director Bill Forsyth.
Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio made her big-screen debut in Martin Scorsese's
THE KING OF COMEDY (8/10) and followed that up with her infamous role of Al
Pacino's younger sister in SCARFACE (8.5/10). She also starred in a film
called THE JANUARY MAN, directed by her husband Pat O'Connor, with whom she
now resides in London, with their two kids.
David Strathairn began his acting career in John Sayles' RETURN OF THE
SECAUCUS SEVEN. He also starred in six other Sayles movies, including this
one. The San Francisco-born actor graduated from Williams College and earned
another degree from the Ringling Brothers Clown College before turning his
talents to film and stage.
Kris Kristofferson has eight Grammy nominations and the Best Song Grammy
Award for "Help Me Make It Through The Night". In 1970, he won Song of the
Year and Songwriter of the Year awards from the Country Music Association.
The part of Noelle was written for 19-year old Vanessa Martinez, who had a
small but pivotal role in Sayles' LONE STAR, her feature film debut.</P>
