<PRE>Inspector Gadget
* out of ****</PRE>
<P>Some movies I should just skip.  My daughter and I had a really vile
time at My Favorite Martian a few weeks back, and here comes another
Disney effects-filled live-action flick based on an old TV program.
True, the probgram is only 15 years old this time, and it's a cartoon.
But it's a cartoon I liked, and I was understandably reluctant to see
what Disney had done to it on the big screen.  But my daughter really
wanted to go, and how bad could it be?</P>
<P>Turns out I was right, mostly.  Inspector Gadget, oddly enough,
follows almost exactly the same format as My Favorite Martian, down to
the jive-talking side-kick.  At first I thought it was done by the
same people, but IMDB informs me that IG was directed by David Kellogg
and written by Dana Olsen and Kerry Ehrin, where MFM was directed by
Donald Petrie and written by Sherri Stoner and Deanna Oliver.</P>
<P>This odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by
the studio that produced it, where "formula" isn't just business, it's
a way of life.  The producers who obviously micromanaged the two
projects should get prominant screen credits.  In some parts you can
just hear them saying "more zany!  I want more zany here -- and --
here."  "Let's have a really painful sexual reference for no reason
right here -- make it really painful.  I want the audience squirming
in their seats."  "Ok, that's fine, but I want you to add bug guts."
"What does this scene do?  Character depth?  But where's the zaniness?
I DON'T see ZANY here.  If you can't make it zany, cut it!"</P>
<P>The latter is the only explanation I can come up with for the absence
of the thoroughly charming Michelle Trachtenberg for most of the
movie.  Michelle (who plays Penny, Gadget's niece)  shines in every
scene she's in, but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of
screen time.  My guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor.</P>
<P>Dabney Coleman's comedic talents are utterly wasted as Chief Quimby.
I kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow
save the film, but instead, he does the best he can with some really
poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes.  He is thoroughly upstaged
by Cheri Oteri as the "gidget bitch from hell" town Mayor.  Oteri's
overly enthusiastic and continually self-congratulatory speech
patterns and mannerisms were so much like Portland, Oregon's own manic
mayor Vera Katz that I had to wonder if the studio wasn't poking fun
at our fair town.  Or, maybe all career politicians are like that.</P>
<P>I must say, Matthew Broderick does not stroll through Inspector Gadget
as he did Godzilla.  He appears to have some fun with the film,
especially as the evil Gadget.  Rupert Everett is entertaining as the
maniacle Claw.</P>
<P>Joely Fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the
zany carbon copy of herself.  Her performance is one of the few things
worth watching in the film.</P>
<P>D.L. Hughley plays the shuckin'-and-jivin' vehicular side-kick, in a
role that firmly sets Emancipation back 20 years.</P>
<P>The dialog is... let's face it, it's pretty bad.  The tag-line after a
major set-piece battle is a faux pas that makes no sense in context.
A lot of the lines (especially Hughley's) appear to be made up as they
go along, by people with little gift for ad-lib.</P>
<P>About three-quarters of the film is a somewhat unnecessary origin
story for both Gadget and Claw.  Gadget then spends the latter third
of the movie trying to locate Claw and having various altercations
(not really "battles") with the evil Gadget.  Penny does about a
minute and a half of the detective work her character did every week
in the cartoon.</P>
<P>Let me rage here just for a minute.  Michelle Trachtenberg was an
excellent choice for the Penny character.  She's utterly charming, and
has excellent experience (Harriet the Spy) for the part of the
pint-size detective.  Why she is so underutilized in this film is a
real mystery.  The film loses a star for casting brilliance coupled
with scripting (or editing) stupidity.</P>
<P>Inspector Gadget is missing the long, long stretches of potty humor
that (among other things) made My Favorite Martian so unbearable, but
it's a very short movie, so perhaps something was cut at the last
moment.</P>
<P>Probably the best scenes in the film occur during the end credits.
The "evil sidekick support group" is especially worth seeing, and has
an amazing number of cameo appearances for the few seconds it's
onscreen.</P>
<P>All in all, another bad live action film from the premere studio for
bad live action films.  I wonder if Disney uses the revenues for it's
generally money-making cartoons to produce these losers.  But if true,
why?  If they're trying for another Mary Poppins, they need to find a
team that can produce one, and then give them a chance to do it.</P>
