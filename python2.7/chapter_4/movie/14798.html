<PRE>Roxbury - A Night to Forget
by Homer Yen
(c) 1998</PRE>
<P>Well, as I check my score card for what I've done this holiday
weekend, it reads Good Ideas: 0 and Dumb Ideas: 1.  I don't know what
I was thinking when I decided to watch this movie.  But in my defense,
I can only say that it was SOMEONE ELSE who urged me to see this with
him.  The film that I'm talking about is `A Night at the Roxbury,' one
of those offerings based on a Saturday Night Live skit.  </P>
<P>Wayne and Garth, these two are not.  Rather, we meet Doug and Steve
Butabi (the actors' names are not worth mentioning), two eternal
partyers whose greatest ambitions in life seem to be finding a way to
get into the hottest night club in the city, the Roxbury.  Driving in
their dad's BMW and donning metallic disco suits right out of Miami
Vice, they try to bribe the bouncer to get into the club.  `Have you
met my friend Washington and his friend Roosevelt,' they confidently
say as they pull out spare pocket change.  Their second greatest
ambition seems to be oozing out as many silly pick-up lines as is
humanly possible in order to start a conversation with a girl (`Let me
see that label.  Just as I thought - made in heaven,' says one of the
brothers).  And, like the losers that they are, they fail to do either
for much of the film.</P>
<P>However, as fate would have it, an accidental meeting with
`what-ever-happened-to' Richard Grieco gives them the all-important
ticket to get in.  Their sad lives take on a whole new direction. 
They make an important contact with the club owner who believes that
these two brothers have uncanny insight into the club scene.  And they
are mistaken as rich swingers by two voluptuous young women.  But
their newfound popularity does not impress their father, who has other
plans for them.</P>
<P>The unfortunate thing about this film is that this is a one-joke
movie, and the brothers are the joke.  Actually, there's about 10
mintues worth of tolerable stuff.  Alas, too long for TV and way too
short for a feature-length film.  Thus, there just isn't enough
material to sustain the 83-minute movie.  There's no plot to be found
and everything that these two do seem to culminate in an opportunity
to execute their trademark move of snapping their heads in unison to
the funky beat of Haddaway's europop song, What Is Love.  I was amazed
that none of the two suffered from whiplash.  To take up more film
time, there is a subplot involving the daughter of the businessman
next door who wants to marry Doug.  This creates not only friction
between the brothers, but their unlikely pairing will also agitate
audience members as well.  She's educated and a forebearing witch. 
Meanwhile, Doug is a complete loser.  How did these two ever get
together?   I suppose that if I can ever figure out the answer to that
question, I'll have figured out why I decided to go and see this
movie.  If you're looking for entertainment, you won't find it at the
Roxbury.</P>
