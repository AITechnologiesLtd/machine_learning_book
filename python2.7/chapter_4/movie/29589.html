<P>Filming in the same satiric mode that informed his
wonderfully mocking film "Happiness," Todd Solondz comes
through for the most part once again with a pair of stories which 
are related thematically but are otherwise wholly independent of 
each other.  Proving the Bard's contention that brevity is the soul 
of wit, Mr. Solondz's first tale, called "Fiction," is far superior to his 
closing yarn, "Non-Fiction," given its tight editing, superlative
acting, and the writer-director's happy intention of not overstaying
his welcome.</P>
<P>"Fiction," which features the protean Selma Blair (last seen in
Dana Lustig's godawful "Kill Me Later" but more fortuitously in
Robert Luketic's "Legally Blonde,")  demolishes political
correctness,  staging the work on the campus of a small college. 
Blair performers in the role of Vi, a blond-haired, impressionable
young woman with her mane dyed bright orange, who opens the
movie with a hot sex scene.  She is in bed with her current
boyfriend and classmate Marcus (Leo Fitzpatrick), a guy who is
afflicted with cerebral palsy and sits next to her in a creative
writing class presided over by Mr. Scott (Robert Wisdom) a tall
black instructor and Pulitzer-prize winner and a man who virtually
ravages his charges with ego-bending lacerations.  Approached
in a bar by Vi, Mr. Scott invites her to his room, where the sober
instructor teaches his student what she thought she learned well
enough with her own boy friend.</P>
<P>"Fiction," which includes politically-incorrect allusions of at least
the quality that got Bill Maher in trouble on TV, is an original--just
when you thought you had imbibed all of Solondz's singularity
from his "Happiness" and "Welcome to the Dollhouse."  Taking
aim at pretentious professors and sensual students alike,
"Fiction" cleverly suggests that everything we seem to know
about people from observing them in polite society is indeed
fiction.</P>
<P>Part 2, the longer piece, is a mixed bag that starts off in as
promising a way as its lead feature, but Solondz, in extending his
conceit beyond the tenable, loses his handle on the material and
ends the work on a contrived, unsatisfactory note.  The forty-two
year-old Newark-born director hones in on a family in his home
state, using as a catalyst an unsuccessful New York shoe
salesman named Toby Oxman (Paul Giamatti).  Toby, who works
in a Florsheim store but who has not yet given up his dream, is
determined to become famous (though not rich) by producing a
documentary about high school.  What turns out is not as
compelling as Fred Wiseman's masterwork on the subject but, as
Solondz freely implies is meant as a sendup of not only suburban
families but of pretentious movie-makers whose use of film-
school techniques poses as art, impressing only those who get
out to the theaters once a month.  Toby's subject, Scooby
Livingston (Mark Webber), is a stereotypically rich, pot-smoking
teen, almost catatonic in his refusal to make plans for his future. 
His driven father, Marty (John Goodman) is on his case,
occasionally chasing Scooby's brother Mikey (Jonathan Osser)
from the table.  Though the stage is set for revenge, Solondz
shows some confusion about the kind of story he wants to tell.  Is
he making a post-Columbine statement about how stresses in
the family unit lead to destruction, or is he interested in working
out his own conflicts about the kinds of films he wants to make
for his audience?  He appears to use Toby (Todd?) as his alter
ego, a man who cannot quite focus on what he wants to say--just
as he cannot himself decide what he wants to send up--and the
plot heads off in various directions ending with a strange, not-
quite-motivated catastrophe.</P>
<P>"Storytelling," then, is well worth seeing--as is anything by this
confrontational and gifted director, given its absolutely brilliant,
taut opener and the laughs provided especially by John
Goodman as a rich, demanding dad who is brought down by his
tyrannical expectations.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running time: 83 minutes.  (C) 2001 by
