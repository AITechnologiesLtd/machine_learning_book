<P>     I did an article the week before this came out defending parody movies.
In retrospect, I believe I should have picked another time to defend them.
Austin Powers: The Spy who Shagged Me, a thoroughly ridiculous film, falls
victim to the curse of comedies everywhere: the plot becomes a vehicle for
the jokes.</P>
<P>     Early on in the movie, as Austin Powers (Mike Myers) is about to travel
back in time in order to thwart the plans of Dr. Evil (also Mike Myers), he
unearths a major plothole in the movie and tries to bring it up to a Q-like
figure in the movie.  This person playfully intones.  "I suggest you don't
worry about things like that."  Then he turns to the audience and says.
"That goes for you, too."  This kind of laissez-faire attitude towards the
plot is carried on throughout the remainder of the film.  Every plot hole is
ignored, every glitch bypassed with a trite device, and every sense of plot
direction lost.</P>
<P>     For this reason, telling you the plot of the movie is a moot point,
considering that the entire plot doesn't matter at all in relation to the
jokes.  The jokes just pop up out of nowhere.  Some of them are funny, some
of them aren't.  The majority of them just basically take up time.</P>
<P>     A higher percentage of the jokes are funnier than in the first Austin
Powers, but this one has the same tiring, trite humor that James Bond can
pull off but Austin Powers can't.  It has a genius sequence describing a
rather... odd shaped spaceship, a fine part in which "The Jerry Springer
Show" is rather effectively parodied, and a continuation of the highly
demented psychodrama that makes up the relationship between Scott Evil (Seth
Green of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" fame) and Dr. Evil, but the film in and
of itself remains nothing but a vehicle for these jokes to travel in.</P>
<P>     Because these jokes seem just stuck in, you never really get into the
characters (Heather Graham's Felicity Shagwell being the exception, but I
have a thing for that actress and have had a thing for her since Drugstore
Cowboy), so, when the jokes are made, you don't really laugh as much as you
normally would.  If fact, you don't really laugh much at all.  It's more of
a chuckle film.</P>
<P>     In the effort to fit in so many good jokes, the film drags its feet
like a man on the night before his wedding.  It really doesn't want to go.
Add to this list of things that this film lacks: Inertia.  Other things that
it also lacks are characters, good actors, true intelligence, and the
special zing that makes a parody film worthwhile.</P>
<P>     I'm not going to turn around and bash parody films, as I'm sure
everyone else who is giving Austin Powers: The Spy who Shagged Me the
lackluster reviews it deserves will be doing.  Instead, I make the
suggestion that this film would be much, much better as a stand-up comedy
sketch.  In a stand up sketch, you don't really need plot, only direction
and a target, both of which Austin Powers have in abundance.  Myers, an SNL
veteran and a fine stand up comedian, would have done fine with that... but
no.  Instead, I had to sit through 95 minutes of good jokes stuck in a very,
very bad movie.</P>
