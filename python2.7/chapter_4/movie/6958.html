<PRE>                                    COSI
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>COSI, an Australian film which is loosely based on Louis
Nowra's experiences as a drama therapist at a mental
institution back in the mid 1970s, is short for Mozart's
comic opera, COSI FAN TUTTE. At the institution, Nowra had
directed several plays with the mental patients cast as the
performers.</P>
<P>We therefore meet Lewis (Ben Mendelsohn) who has dropped out
of college and is looking for employment in something
meaningful to him.   Offered a job as director of a  play at
a mental institution and thinking it will be easy, he
accepts.  Thus begins the story. Lewis quickly realizes that
this will not be the snap job he had pictured.</P>
<P>Dealing with willful mental patients who have their own
ideas about how the opera should go, trying his best to make
some order out of chaos,   Lewis fears for his own sanity
but before he quits, he suddenly realizes that he really
likes the misfits with whom he is in constant contact and
decides to give it his best shot.</P>
<P>Although COSI has many things going for it, such as its
director who had directed the very funny THE EFFICIENCY
EXPERT, some talented Australian actors such as Ben
Mendelsohn (THE EFFICIENCY EXPERT, THE YEAR MY VOICE BROKE),
Tony Collette (MURIEL'S WEDDING) and EMMA), Barry Otto
(STRICTLY BALLROOM) Rachel Griffiths (MURIEL'S WEDDING) and
Pamela Rabe (SIRENS) the movie does not quite live up to its
potential.  Several scenes are quite predictable.  Still, it
is very funny and certainly worth seeing.</P>
<PRE>Directed by Mark Joffe.</PRE>
