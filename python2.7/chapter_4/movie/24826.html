<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>When the original movie version of "Mission: Impossible" was released in 
1996, there was little doubt that a sequel would soon follow. The film 
provided the perfect framework for a long-running franchise in the form 
of the international espionage agency known as the Impossible Missions 
Force. Not only did the use of this multi-purpose organization provide 
reasonable breadth of storytelling, but it meant future films weren't 
contingent on a recurring cast. Sequels could always use a different IMF 
if need be. Even the star, Tom Cruise, could be replaced in a manner 
rather more palatable than, say, the revolving door Batmans of the past 
decade.</P>
<P>Of course, for "Mission: Impossible 2", only the first option has been 
employed. Cruise does indeed return to reprise his role as Ethan Hunt, 
one of the IMF's top agents. Hunt, once again, is a cool, poised man of 
action, possessing a seemingly endless array of skills. But unlike the 
first "Mission: Impossible", which cast Hunt in the role of a desperate 
agent abandoned by his organization, little is really done with Cruise's 
character in this sequel. Character development is slim to none, and a 
romance with a fellow agent feels lifted out of a James Bond picture. 
There is an unsatisfying sense of stagnation to Ethan in "MI2"; it's 
almost as if scriptwriter Robert Towne is taking a page from the "Mission:
Impossible" TV series in limiting Hunt's evolution. The problem is that 
this is a feature film, not a television programme. It's fine for TV 
characters to develop slowly, because with twenty-two episodes a year 
they have the time. A movie franchise which only churns out a new 
installment every few years cannot afford the same luxury.</P>
<P>The same problem plagues the other holdover from the first film, Luther 
Stickell (Ving Rhames). Stickell was engaging in "Mission: Impossible"; 
here he's shoehorned into the background, often isolated even from the 
other IMF agents. Stickell could just as easily have been replaced with a 
totally new character without damaging the film, and as a result his 
return here feels almost token. The third member of this version of 
Hunt's team, Billy Baird (John Polson) is similarly faceless; even Emilio 
Estevez's short-lived agent in the first film was more interesting than 
this guy.</P>
<P>The same cannot quite be said of the last of our heroes, Nyah Hall 
(Thandie Newton). A world-class thief, we first encounter Nyah in action 
trying to steal a valuable necklace, and it makes for one of the movie's 
most watchable scenes. Nyah is a promising character -- neither a typical 
damsel-in-distress nor some kind of uber-confident goddess. 
Unfortunately, that potential gets lost in the movie's second half, in 
which Newton has far less screen time. It's also regrettable that Nyah's 
role in the proceedings means that she rarely gets to demonstrate her 
skills; the script mostly just calls for her to stand around and look 
vaguely nervous. Nonetheless, I would enjoy seeing the character return, 
in a more proactive role, in future "Mission: Impossible" films.</P>
<P>This time around, the team has been assembled to investigate the 
disappearance of the mysterious genetically-engineered Chimera virus and 
its antidote, Bellorophon. These have been stolen by a rogue IMF agent 
named Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott, who does a good job of acting evil but 
can conjure no other personality traits from the character) posing as 
Hunt himself. Ambrose and his goons intend to auction off Chimera and 
Bellorophon to the highest bidder. New IMF recruit Nyah is also Ambrose's 
former lover, putting her in a unique position to get close to him and 
give Hunt and his team a chance to reclaim the stolen goods.</P>
<P>The plot of the original "Mission: Impossible" was criticised by some for 
being too labyrinthine, although I enjoyed the complexity and intrigue it 
offered. The sequel goes too far the other way. This is all standard spy 
stuff -- viruses, high-stakes auctions, jilted ex-lovers -- and the 
"rogue agent" subplot has been overused of late, in everything from 
"GoldenEye" to, indeed, the first "Mission: Impossible"!</P>
<P>And this isn't the only element of the movie that feels lifted from its 
predecessor. Remember that terrific scene with Tom Cruise dangling inches 
above a pressure-sensitive floor? Well, something similar occurs here, 
albeit with none of the tension or flair of the original. Indeed, "MI2" 
is sadly lacking in invention and suspense, with many of the action 
scenes being just routine material. There is little of the twisting and 
turning which characterised the first film. There, when a character's 
secrets were revealed they were astounding; here, they're easily predicted.</P>
<P>It is fortunate, then, that "Mission: Impossible 2" has renowned director 
John Woo at its helm. Woo knows how to inject some much-needed 
adrenaline into the picture, employing some creative action shots which 
only slightly overuse slow-motion effects. Even Woo cannot save the 
tedious and overlong middle third of the movie. But he is in fine form 
during the closing half hour, pumping up the tempo with an entertaining 
motorcycle chase and a heart-pounding hand-to-hand duel between Hunt and 
Ambrose. Also an asset is a fine multifaceted score by Hans Zimmer.</P>
<P>But ultimately, it's hard to shake the feeling that "Mission: Impossible 
2" is mostly an exercise in sound and fury. And while this is certainly 
nothing new for a summer blockbuster, I at least demand something with a 
bit of originality for my entertainment dollar. "MI2" just doesn't offer 
that; it seems content to just be adequate, relying on the memory of the 
superior first movie (and of course Cruise's star power) to fill the seats.</P>
<P>"MI2" isn't a bad film, but it is a poor sibling to the first "Mission: 
Impossible". That movie was fun consistently, this one only in flashes. I 
would not be dismayed if a third film in the series were to go into 
production. But I hope any such project will strive to bring some 
freshness and invention to the franchise. With "Mission: Impossible 2", 
complacency has already set in.</P>
