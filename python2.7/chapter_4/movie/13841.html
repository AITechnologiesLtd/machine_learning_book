<P>     Quite a few things have changed since last we visited with Buddy, the
hoops-shooting golden retriever star of AIR BUD.  His human pal, Josh
Framm (Kevin Zegers) is starting junior high school; Josh's widowed mother
(Cynthia Stevenson, taking over from Wendy Makkena) is re-entering the
dating arena.  Even the name before the film has changed, with Disney
shuttling the sequel from its flagship banner to Dimension, the genre
division of Miramax (apparently realizing the original had too few fart
jokes to qualify as a live-action Disney film).  And of course, the most
significant and tragic change involved the death of the original Buddy
from cancer, though he was only one of several dogs to perform in AIR BUD.</P>
<P>     I only wish that with all those changes they could have rustled up a
new screenwriting team.  Paul Tamasy and Aaron Mendelsohn return to duty
for AIR BUD: GOLDEN RECEIVER, this time turning Buddy into a football star
when Josh goes out for the local hapless youth football team led by
good-natured, multiple-bypass-waiting-to-happen Coach Fanelli (Robert
Costanzo).  Naturally this leads to amusing sequences of Buddy befuddling
opposing defenses as he makes like Jerry Rice.  But wait, there's more!
You also get touching dramatic sub-text as Josh struggles to accept his
mom's new relationship with a kindly veterinarian (Gregory Harrison).  All
that, plus a bumbling pair of Russians (Nora Dunn and Perry Anzilotti) who
want to kidnap Buddy to join their trained animal circus.</P>
<P>     The original AIR BUD had good intentions and solid family values to
spare, but it tied them up in such derivative and unfocused package that
even the kids in the audience couldn't keep their attention on the
precocious pooch.  New director Richard Martin picks up the pace
considerably this time around, but he can't do much to create any
cohesiveness with this story.  From moment to moment, it's hard to tell
whether AIR BUD: GOLDEN RECEIVER is supposed to be an Afterschool Special,
a John Hughes film or an episode of Rocky and Bullwinkle (though with
considerably less wit).  Martin even throws in some low-rent vaudeville by
pairing his own dad Dick (of Rowan & Martin fame) with Tim Conway as goofy
play-by-play announcers. It's hard to take the messages about believing
in yourself and loving a new parent seriously when they're juxtaposed with
two clowns sliding around in the contents of a tank conveniently labeled
"Fish Guts."</P>
<P>     It's also hard to take seriously a film where a premise so bizarre is
shrugged off as a given.  To the credit of the original AIR BUD, at least
it showed people fumbling with the basketball rule book to figure out
whether a dog was eligible for the team.  This time around, Buddy trots
onto the field in his leather helmet and shoulder pads as though it were
the most natural thing in the world.  Perhaps somewhere on the cutting
room floor is a scene in which an arbitrator cites the "Air Bud"
precedent.  Without such a scene, everything that follows seems a little
insulting to the intelligence, and an indication of how lazy the
screenwriters were that they couldn't come up with some creative way to
land Buddy on the team.  Isn't it about time for a satiric poke at school
"inclusiveness" rules?</P>
<P>     I'm not pretending that AIR BUD: GOLDEN RECEIVER was made with me in
mind.  This one is a short attention span kiddie-caper which did have the
young ones clapping and guffawing with some regularity, and perhaps that
counts for something.  It even features a few decent throwaway gags,
including a llama named Dolly and a splendidly off-key rendition of the
American National Anthem. There's just something vaguely desperate about
this whole AIR BUD franchise -- they have build not just one film but a
series of them on what amounts to a better-than-average Stupid Pet Trick.
Sure, it's harmless enough, but the frantic amalgamation of disparate
elements gave me a headache.  It's a bit frightening to note that the
original Buddy's trainer Kevin DiCicco is putting together another
project, AIR BUD: THE NEXT GENERATION.  Perhaps in the course of teaching
a new dog a new trick, he could teach a new screenwriting team one I'd
really love to see:  how to write a script that might appeal to someone
over the age of five.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Buds no wiser:  4.</PRE>
