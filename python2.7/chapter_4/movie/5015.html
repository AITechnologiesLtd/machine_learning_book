<PRE>                             CASUALTIES OF WAR
                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  **1/2  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1989)</PRE>
<P>        "THE ACCUSED in Vietnam."  You have to wonder if CASUALTIES OF WAR
was sold on that high-concept pitch.  Brian De Palma's shocking war drama
is based on a horrifying true incident, in which a handful of soldiers
abducted a teen-age Vietnamese girl and dragged her on a long-range
reconnaissance mission.  In short, they kidnapped, raped, and murdered her,
treating her like a piece of meat.</P>
<P>        Unlike THE ACCUSED, however, CASUALTIES OF WAR doesn't take the
victim's point of view.  Rather, it tells story of Private Eriksson, the
only soldier in the platoon who has the guts and conscience to vehemently
protest the violent crime.</P>
<P>        Michael J. Fox turns in an impressive performance as the naive and
idealistic newcomer, who after only three weeks in Vietnam, still thinks
the war is just a game.  That is, until he witnesses the brutal rape, which
he is powerless to prevent.  Eriksson's moments of moral outrage and of
tenderness with the rape victim are heartfelt and stirring, which
unfortunately can't be said of anything else in the movie.</P>
<P>        Except for Thuy Thu Le, who will break your heart as the victim,
the supporting actors get caught in a cross fire of cliches.  Surprise,
surprise, Sean Penn plays the racist and psychotic sergeant who instigates
the atrocity.  In nearly every film he's made, Penn has played an arrogant
tough guy, and frankly, it's getting boring.  Most of the characters,
including Penn's, come across as unbelievable stereotypes.</P>
<P>        A clumsy and heavy-handed screenplay, which telegraphs the big
moments, also bogs down the film.  According to the New York Times,
screenwriter David Rabe is so unhappy with the way his words were
translated to the screen that he's trying to disassociate himself from the
film.  Rabe objects to the simplistic dialogue and thinly drawn
relationships, and so do I.</P>
<P>        On the plus side, CASUALTIES OF WAR regains some solid footing from
Brian De Palma's confident direction, which is unusually understated and
for once doesn't call attention to itself.  De Palma is careful not to
allow the film to become sensational or melodramatic; this is no
MISSISSIPPI BURNING.</P>
<P>        Ultimately, CASUALTIES OF WAR fights a losing battle because it
fails to justify the repugnant violence.  The movie has very little payoff:
it offers few, if any, new insights into Vietnam.  We already knew that war
is hell and can turn men into monsters.  No kidding!  De Palma needs
something more enlightening to underscore such a grim, disturbing film.  As
is, CASUALTIES OF WAR may leave you asking: is this movie really necessary?</P>
<PRE>Cheers...</PRE>
