<P>I'm not 14 years old, and I'm not female, but I'm pretty confident in
claiming that in his new movie "The Beach," pretty boy Leonardo DiCaprio is
looking just as dreamy as ever. (And just to deflect any potential pithy
comments, no, I'm not gay either -- not that there's anything wrong with
that.)  There's plenty of stuff here for Leo fanatics to get worked up over.
There's Shirtless Leo, Romantic Leo, and a fair amount of Leo Sex. But such
fans may also be disappointed, because "The Beach" is no airy, ultimately
tragic romance á la "Titanic." It's an edgy, violent, highly-stylized film
that says something about humanity and civilization. At least it thinks it
does. The trouble with "The Beach" is that it's saddled with a clashing of
goals: Leo fans may want a film that offers an opportunity to gaze at their,
like, most favorite movie star ever (and no doubt the studio pushed for
that), but it's clearly coming from source material that has higher purpose
in mind. This film, a thematically confused affair, never reconciles the
conflict.</P>
<P>DiCaprio plays Richard, a bored American looking for adventure by touring
the world. He arrives in Thailand, finding a world just as commercialized as
the one he came from. At his flea-ridden hotel, he meets Daffy (Robert
Carlyle), a crazed Scot who gives him a map detailing the location of a
hidden island, upon which a beach lies, one purported to be paradise on
Earth. After Daffy commits a gruesome suicide, Richard convinces the French
couple living next door, Étienne (Guillaume Canet) and Françoise (Virginie
Ledoyen), to embark with him on a journey to the fabled beach. When the trio
reaches their destination, they find an island half owned by Thai marijuana
farmers, with the other half owned by a group consisting mostly of Europeans
that live on a beautiful beach and have formed their own community. They
work to maintain their paradise, but spend a great deal of their time
partying. To Richard and his pals, it seems like the perfect life, but like
all perfect lives in a movie like this, it can't last. One of the more
ominous figures is Sal (Tilda Swinton), the overbearing community matriarch,
whose stubborn desire to keep her perfect community secret may be its
downfall.</P>
<P>Leo performs reasonably well in this film, and contrary to what many of
those who got sick of the "Titanic" hoopla might think, he's actually a
pretty good actor. Too bad his role in "The Beach" is not a good one for
him; when the script forces him to "go primitive," it's positively silly
(more on that later), and much of the artistic merit has been compromised by
the producers' more commercial desire to get their golden boy into yet
another troublesome love triangle. Consequently, Richard's romance with
Françoise feels painfully tacked-on, especially considering it lasts about
20 minutes before being forgotten altogether. And Étienne is probably the
calmest ex-boyfriend in history: Is he really going to give up a babe like
Françoise that easily? Either he's a wimp or merely the consequence of a
Hollywood script contrivance, one dealing only with the desired end result
and paying little attention to the logic of getting there.</P>
<P>"The Beach" starts off well enough. There's a nice "Apocalypse Now"-inspired
opening sequence, and Robert Carlyle's appearance is delightfully batty,
despite the fact that I could hardly understand a word of it. In fact, most
of the movie's first act is quite entertaining, mainly because it's actually
moving toward a goal: discovery of the island. Had it kept with this
premise -- an adventure-romance in a tropical locale -- the film might have
worked. It wouldn't have been deep, but still fun. Unfortunately, "The
Beach" runs into pretensions of thematic depth in its second hour, and when
this film gets deep, it gets silly. We get muddled messages about humanity's
destruction of nature and the fleeting quality of paradise, and they don't
take hold because it's clear screenwriter John Hodge doesn't know what he
wants to say. He waffles around, first making Richard a disenchanted
antihero, then a romantic lead, and finally an animalistic jungle boy. The
last of these choices is by far the worst, and it's sadly the one Hodge goes
with at the end. The major problem with Richard's transformation into Mr.
Primeval is that the entire episode doesn't make an ounce of sense. Leo's
character goes nuts at the drop of a hat, and then turns back to being
civilized just as abruptly. Nothing is ever explained about his sudden lapse
into insanity, and what's worse, DiCaprio is decidedly not the right actor
for the part. Would you be scared if a shirtless, headband-wearing Leo
growled at you from underneath some bushes? I'd laugh and move on, but the
people in "The Beach" actually take him seriously.</P>
<P>Director Danny Boyle is a great talent, and his use of rapid-fire editing
techniques and creative shot selection is still as proficient as ever, but
he really doesn't know what to do with material that has no real focus. I've
never read the Alex Garland novel upon which "The Beach" is based, but it
seems the point has been lost, and Boyle doesn't know where it is. In an
effort to cover this up, he overloads his film with stylistic flourishes.
This isn't a bad strategy; if nothing else, "The Beach" remains visually
interesting for most of its running time. But I'm not sure if there's ever
been a filmmaker with enough style to entirely cover up for utter failure in
the writing department (well, maybe Tim Burton), and likewise Boyle's
stylistic decisions don't hold up to close scrutiny. There is a scene with
DiCaprio running around the jungle like a character in a video game
(unsubtly set up by early scenes of Richard playing his Game Boy) that is
awfully amusing at first glance, but when I thought about it, I couldn't
come up with any earthly reason why it was included. Nor did I understand
why Richard started having dreams about Daffy taking him into war, and why
everyone welcomes the original trio with open arms but freaks out when four
surfers, accidentally led by Richard, come to the island. There isn't much
internal logic in "The Beach," just a lot of inexplicable things necessary
to move the plot along, which are otherwise known as "contrivances."</P>
<P>Some might find the issues brought up by "The Beach" timely and fascinating,
provided they've never read "Lord of the Flies" or seen "Apocalypse Now,"
but for me, it was an old message delivered in confusing fashion. There are
some redeeming virtues, namely some breathtaking cinematography and a
technofied musical score that adds to many of the scenes nicely. Too bad the
film's story goes from decent to bad to awful: The ending of Garland's novel
apparently involved a violent bloodbath, and while that might not have made
the film much better, it might at least have made a little more sense. The
ending of this version (involving a bunch of iMacs) regretfully destroys
whatever confused messages the film might have been delivering and serves to
turn Leo's character into even more of a brat than he was at the beginning.
Did Richard learn anything from his descent into the heart of darkness?
According to this "Beach," no.</P>
