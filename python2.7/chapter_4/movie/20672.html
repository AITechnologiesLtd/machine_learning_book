<PRE>                           MICKEY BLUE EYES
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A callow young auctioneer finds out
          that the father of the woman he wants to marry is a
          mobster and he is marrying into a crime family.
          Hugh Grant is developing into a very uninteresting
          actor incapable of putting any depth into his
          characters.  This film starts with a rudimentary
          plot and then just fills time until it has enough
          to make this a feature film length.  Rating: 4 (0
          to 10), 0 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Michael Felgate (played by Hugh Grant) is Manhattan art auctioneer
with a mild, non-assertive personality.  He lets the truckers he deals
with walk all over him.  He wants to marry Gina (Jean Tripplehorn) and
she seems to love him, but she is strangely reticent to marry for
reasons she will not say.  When Michael goes to her father's bar and
restaurant he finds out part of the reason why. Her father (James Caan)
and her uncles make up a dangerous crime family.  Gina is sure that if
Michael marries into the family he will be pulled into the criminal
activity.  Mike is just as certain that there is no reason that he
would do that.  But almost immediately he is asked as a favor to use
his auction house to auction off a garish painting created by one of
the crime family members.  This starts an escalating chain of reluctant
favors and counter-favors and a chain of events that pull Mike into the
whirlpool associating him closer and closer to organized crime.</P>
<P>     The problem with this film is that it seems to have been written
by formula.  It started with a skeleton of a cliched plot and then
apparently the writers started hanging jokes on it like ornaments on a
Christmas tree.  The jokes all have little to do with each other.  The
most that they have in common is that they use of screen time.  One can
almost see the writers sitting there saying, "Okay, now we have a 45-
minute story.  Let's throw in a comic FBI agent.  Now we are up to 50
minutes...."  Even then the central plot builds to a very predictable
ending.  Anyone surprised by the surprise ending is probably new to
1990s cinema.</P>
<P>     Hugh Grant was charming early in his career with his boyish smile
and youthful charm.  But he seems incapable of stretching himself as an
actor or leaving his comfort zone.  In this film we care for his
character about to the extent that we want to cuddle and protect a
small child.  Listening to him try to talk like a gangster is like
watching a child trying to sound like an adult in a school play.  It is
cute but it is not really entertaining and shows very little
accomplishment.  Here we are not pulled into the plot or the irony of
the situation and the jokes are not particularly perceptive.  And worst
of all they are rarely funny.  The views we have of crime figures are
largely cliched.  That is part of the joke, that they are instantly
recognizable as crime figures. That worked in THE FRESHMAN, but that
film had a much better story behind it. James Caan provides the only
interesting role interpretation and even he can not make things click.</P>
<PRE>     This comedy overall seems tired with far too few jokes that hit
home.  It is for fans of Hugh Grant and nobody else.  I give it a 4 on
the 0 to 10 scale and a +0 on the -4 to +4 scale.</PRE>
