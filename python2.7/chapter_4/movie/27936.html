<PRE>        DON'T LET ME DIE ON A SUNDAY (J'aimerais pas crever un dimanche)
                         A film review by Julia Levin
                         Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com

<P>There is a particular kind of pleasure in seeing a really bad movie --
at least you have the advantage of expressing anger, frustration, or
resentment --a visceral response of some kind, no matter how
unsatisfying that is.</P>
<P>Don't Let Me Die on a Sunday won't even give you the satisfaction of
disgust or hatred; it is simply too dull for that.</P>
<P>After a wild techno music party infused with all kinds of sex, drugs and
alcohol, a young woman named Terese (Élodie Bouchez) arrives at the
local morgue: She is pronounced dead from a drug overdose.  Her
beautiful corpse attracts the attention of a gloomy, violent morgue
attendant named Ben (Jean-Marc Barr), a necrophiliac whose sexual
voracity is so powerful it brings the woman back to life.  With Ben, she
discovers an alternative lifestyle -- a subculture of sex fanatics,
latex, nipple clamps, and other trappings of a supposedly promiscuous
sexual underworld. </P>
<P>With this premise, the film could have been realized as a farce or at
least black comedy, had it managed to have a drop of humor and panache
in presenting such distasteful material.  Instead, what could have been
a wild quest for endless sexual gratification is realized in boring
series of catatonic sexual gyrations, completely devoid of fun and
pleasure.  The film becomes an odyssey of dead people walking: aloof and
desensitized, they inhabit the world of dark hallways, sex clubs, morgue
corridors, and vast empty spaces.  Their world is a place in which
normal human relationships can't possibly be found: Ben and his fellow
co-workers escape what they call ordinary life in pursuit of orgies,
death worship, petty violence, and emotional vacuum.  The most
unfortunate of all is that the film treats its material with a straight
face and frightening absence of imagination and humor, and -- for those
interested in adventuresome French sexual escapades -- without even a
slight attempt to be daring or transgressive.</P>
<P>Even the wonderful Élodie Bouchez, who won the Best Actress Award at
Cannes in 1999 for her outstanding performance in The Dreamlife of
Angels can't bring life to this utter nullity of a movie.  My feeble
attempts to excavate the meaning of love, life, and death out of this
morgue land have obviously failed ignominiously.</P>
