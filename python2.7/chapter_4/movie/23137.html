<P>I know of very few horror trilogies. The "Evil Dead" is the only example I can
think of, though the last entry, "Army of Darkness," was less than stellar. The
nearly parodic original "Scream" certainly never gave the impression that a
sequel was necessary, or a trilogy. Yet "Scream 3" is here, and the surprise is
that it is not bad - a decent if pale reminder of the previous two entries. </P>
<P>This time, the nearly traumatized heroine Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is
living in a secluded area outside L.A., which makes sense considering she has
escaped the wrath of a ghostface killer in two movies. She has now changed her
name, and works as a woman's crisis operator! She also has visions of her dead
mother walking in the wooded area outside her house (if you recall, Sidney's
mother was killed by her boyfriend in the original). </P>
<P>But the nightmare is not over as we witness the making of "Stab 3: Return to
Woodsboro," a Hollywood production with a novice film director Roman Bridger
(Scott Foley) at the helm. The ingratiating Parker Posey plays Gale Weathers,
the bitchy reporter. Courteney Cox Arquette returns of course as the real Gale,
seeing her life once again depicted in a movie (as evidenced by the outstanding
success of the first "Stab" film shown in "Scream 2.") I hope this all makes
sense. But somebody is offing all the cast members of the latest production,
and it is up to Gale and witty returnee David Arquette as the bumbling former
cop Dewey, now technical advisor for "Stab 3", to solve the crime and determine
who is the new killer with the cape and Edward Munch mask. Whoever it is has a
fixation on poor Sidney and her dead mother. </P>
<P>"Scream 3" is the sequel-within-the-sequel parody that almost takes its idea
and turns it on its head, as "Scream 2" did. Unfortunately, the script by
writer Ehren Kruger ("Arlington Road") eschews some of the clever wit and puns
of the first two films, concentrating instead on slicing and dicing methods of
cruelty. In other words, "Scream 3" almost becomes the generic slasher movie
that these movies made a mockery out of in the first place. Frankly, Sidney and
their pals have forgotten how to play by the rules they were so proudly an
authority on. Never run up the stairs as opposed to outside the house and never
say the name of the person you are looking for since they are most likely dead.
Oh, and please never go inside a dark basement and for God's sakes, use a cell
phone when you really need it in a moment of crisis. </P>
<P>Despite a number of false scares (some did make me jump) and red herrings,
"Scream 3" is fairly okay, at least far superior to "Urban Legend" or "I Know
What You Did Last Summer." There is enough tension throughout and some good
performances, particularly Neve Campbell. She has matured since the original
film, and shows ample strength and humanity - never has a heroine seemed so
sympathetic in any of these slasher flicks. I also enjoyed watching the
Arquettes mingle and throw verbal asides - my favorite is when Gale asks Dewey
about Sidney's phone number and if he has it in his memory. He thinks for a
moment, and then she shouts, "Phone memory!" Independent film starlet Parker
Posey is the big star of the film and she is tremendously fun to watch,
delivering all her lines with ironic gusto. I also enjoyed the scenes where she
spars with Courteney Cox as they investigate the murders and question various
suspects. I did not enjoy the unimaginative, by-the-numbers scenes with Jenny
McCarthy as an actress (are we cringing yet?), Patrick Dempsey as a cop (!) and
Lance Henriksen as a Roger Corman-type producer. The supporting actors playing
the supporting actors of the sequel-within-the-sequel are bland and
forgettable. </P>
<P>"Scream 3" is a fitting conclusion to a popular movie series that spawned so
many horrible copycats in its wake. From director Wes Craven, who can make
these movies in his sleep, it is markedly better than most other rip-offs. If
only screenwriter Kevin Williamson returned to write this one, it would have
been a real scream, baby.</P>
