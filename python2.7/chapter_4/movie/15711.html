INSOMNIA
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>The land of the midnight sun can be tough on a detective trying to solve
a murder case.  Near the arctic circle at a time when the sun never
sets, it's hard for the detective to get much sleep, especially when he
has accidentally made himself part of the case.</P>
<P>As economically directed by Erik Skjoldbaerg, INSOMNIA, the lean and
atmospheric tale written by Nikolaj Frobenius, is not compelled to
explain everything.  Although it's not hard to follow, the story happily
leaves the actions and motivations of many of the characters ambiguous.</P>
<P>A film without much dialog like INSOMNIA requires a strong leading actor
to carry it.  Stellan Skarsgard from BREAKING THE WAVES, GOOD WILL
HUNTING and RONIN delivers a masterful performance as Jonas Engstrom,
the Swedish cop with a reputation for doing whatever it takes to crack a
case.  Skarsgard's acting temperament makes him a perfect choice for the
role of the stoic policeman.</P>
<P>Jonas has been called to the far north of Norway to solve the case of a
murdered 17-year-old girl.  The methodical killer had cleaned the body
afterwards and even washed her hair so that no clues would be left.  The
girl had had a big fight with her teenage boyfriend the night of the
murder, and he doesn't have an alibi.  She had also been seeing an older
man who gave her expensive clothing.  These two are immediate suspects.</P>
<P>When the case goes horribly wrong, Jonas begins to fear that he will be
arrested, so he creates an elaborate web of deception.  With his lack of
sleep and his palpable exhaustion, Jonas becomes increasingly paranoid
as he chases the killer.  Several scenes are set in his hotel room
during the bright night as he tries in vain to cover his windows
effectively so he can get some much-needed sleep.</P>
<P>Racked with guilt for his mistakes and fearing the worst, Jonas pushes
his body past its level of endurance, causing himself, more than once,
to almost fall asleep at the wheel.  Erling Thurmann-Andersen's
penetrating cinematography shows every pore and line in Jonas's troubled
face.</P>
<P>The director pays careful attention to the small details.  The
background sounds, for example, are so low that even a kiss sounds like
a small explosion.  This lack of ambient noise allows him to emphasize
the minutia of the case that might otherwise have been missed.</P>
<P>To say that a movie makes you sleepy is generally the ultimate insult,
but not this time.  Skarsgard delivers such an emphatic performance that
audiences may begin to feel just as fatigued as Jonas.  And with that
drowsiness comes a heightened appreciation for exactly what he is having
to endure.</P>
<P>INSOMNIA runs just 1:37.  The film is in Norwegian with English
subtitles.  It is not rated but would be an R for brief intense gore,
sex, nudity and profanity and would be fine for teenagers.</P>
