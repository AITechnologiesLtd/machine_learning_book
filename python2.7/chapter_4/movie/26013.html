Susan Granger's review of "THE WAY OF THE GUN" (Artisan Entertainment)</PRE>
<P>   Screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie, who won an Oscar for
"The Usual Suspects," makes an auspicious directorial debut with this
crime thriller about two small-time crooks who call themselves Parker
(Ryan Phillippe) and Longbaugh (Benicio Del Toro), the real surnames
of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.  They're raising capital by
selling their sperm in L.A. when they overhear a conversation about
Robin (Juliette Lewis) who has been hired for $1 million by a wealthy
couple to be a surrogate mother. Immediately, they concoct a
kidnapping/ransom scheme. But when they unconventionally abduct the
waddling, very-pregnant Robin from her obstetrician's office, despite
the presence of her bodyguards (Taye Diggs, Nicky Katt), and hide her
in a hotel in Mexico, complications begin, and she gives birth in the
midst of a gunfight. What the inept, sociopathic thugs don't know is
that the biological father (Scott Wilson) of the newborn boy, the man
they're shaking down for $15 million, launders money for organized
crime and that he's hired a mob-connected "fixer" (James Caan) to take
care of the situation. (Curiously, the "fixer" has an assistant who in
real-life is Geoffrey Lewis, Juliette Lewis's father). One of the
menacing Caan's better lines is "I can promise you a day of reckoning
that you will not live long enough to never forget." As you might
expect from a Christopher McQuarrie script, the confusing plot twists
and turns, tricky double-cross following tricky double-cross, within
back-stabbing sub-plots, and nothing is ever exactly what you expect
it to be except, perhaps, the shoot-'em'up finale. On the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The Way of the Gun" scores a slow-paced but
grimly stylish, snarling 4, profane and violent from start to finish -
with not one likable character.</P>
