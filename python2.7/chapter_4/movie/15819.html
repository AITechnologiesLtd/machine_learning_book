<P>Important stories have a way of getting themselves retold.  As part of 
the greatest story ever told, the story of Moses is done up with amazing 
technical skill and a good amount of interest in DreamWorks' 'The Prince 
of Egypt.'</P>
<P>In a wonderfully poetic opening sequence, we watch Moses' mother place 
him in a basket.  But he does not float serenely through the bulrushes;  
instead the infant is nearly ruined by crocodiles, hippopotami, and 
several boats.  Finally he is rescued by the Queen (voice of Helen 
Mirren).  So much for background, as the action jumps twenty or so years 
to show an unrealistic but hilarious chariot race between the two sons 
of Pharoah - Rameses (Ralph Fiennes) and the adopted Moses (Val Kilmer).  
There is a bond between the brothers that gives the very story mythic 
overtones, as we know the bond must eventually be shattered.</P>
<P>The meat of the story covers Moses' transformation from prince to Hebrew 
prophet.  In one scene Moses runs upon his real sister, Miriam (Sandra 
Bullock), and brother, Aaron (Jeff Goldblum).  Of course he rejects any 
notion of being related to these lowly slaves.  The movie does a nice 
job of portraying the subtle reckonings of memory:  Moses somehow 
recovers familiarity with Miriam's song, the one his mother sang to him 
in his infancy.  But this is only the first in a series of revelations.  
After Moses irrevocably severs his connections with the Egyptian court, 
he takes to living with desert people, serving the priest of Midian, 
Jethro (Danny Glover).  Moses and Jethro's daughter Tzipporah (Michelle 
Pfeiffer) marry, and after a time Moses (as a pre-Christ figure) gives 
up his private life as a shepherd and fulfills God's will.</P>
<P>'The Prince of Egypt' would not benefit from comparison to Cecil B. De 
Mille's classic 'The Ten Commandments.'  'Commandments' has the length 
and expanse of an epic - three hours of human struggle with no songs or 
animated whimsicality to lighten the subject matter.  Yes, it is dated 
by the time in which it was made, but 'dated' does not mean 'bad.'  The 
scope of the narrative in De Mille's movie is breath-taking and, 
besides, Charlton Heston's voice has it all over Val Kilmer's.  'Prince' 
probably benefits from it shortness, considering its main audience is 
children.  The most remarkable miraculous events are touched upon - the 
infestations of frogs and locusts, pestilence, and a scary sequence - 
the origin of Passover, in which the first-born of Egypt (except those 
whose lintels are marked with the blood of the lamb) die with the most 
forlorn of exhalations.  This animated feature does fair justice to 
these serious events.</P>
<P>The most striking, I think, is the Red Sea parting.  This was my 
favorite scene, and my son's.  It has been broadcast far that DreamWorks 
spent countless human hours depicting the attempt of Moses and the Jews 
to leave Egypt, only to be blocked by the sea.  Rameses' legions are 
bearing down upon them, creating an almost perfect dramatic moment.  
Executive producer Jeffrey Katzenberg and his entire staff have 
accomplished a magnificent task, a five-plus minute sequence of terror 
and wonder that is as fascinating to watch as any moments filmed.  What 
an idea - to show the ocean life as the fleeing people stumble under the 
vast curtains of parted water!</P>
<P>Other strong parts of the production include music and original 
storytelling.  My wife and daughter - both very able musicians - liked 
the songs.  Ten-year-old Kristin claims to have almost cried during 
"Deliver Us" and "All I Ever Wanted."  I was struck by the layered 
texture of the song during which Hotep and Huy (voices of Martin Short 
and Steve Martin) are trying to upstage Moses and his 'trick' with his 
staff.  We hear the names of Egyptian gods, voices chanting in the 
background, over top of which Short and Martin sing the main lyrics.  
(The lyrics themselves - "You're playing with the big boys now" - are 
not as strong as those in other songs, though.) Another fabulous 
sequence was a dream in which Moses continues to realize his Hebrew 
heritage.  Although the sequence is not sung, it is dramatized through 
animated hieroglyphic-like figures.  Moses as pictograph flees from 
legions of soldiers.  Then in a stunning epiphany, Moses awakens and 
runs to the actual wall on which this verse from the book of Exodus is 
recorded (1:22): "Pharaoh then commanded all his subjects, 'Throw into 
the river every boy that is born to the Hebrews, but you may let all the 
girls live'."  All his adoptive father can utter in explanation is, 
"They were only slaves."</P>
<P>The animation style is original and well-drawn.  Many of the characters 
seem attenuated, rather Barbie-like in shape, but this is in keeping 
with the Egyptian imagery of the pictographs -dogs and gods of graceful 
slimness.  Pharoah is done with kingly splendor, like the sphinxes and 
other likenesses modeled after him.  Patrick Stewart lends an 
appropriately regal voice to this character.  Most of the other actors 
perform admirably in their voice roles.  They are, if nothing else, 
transparently efficient.  Ones that draw positive attention to 
themselves include Stewart, Jeff Goldblum (you can see his cerebral 
fussiness in Aaron's mannerisms, too), Ralph Fiennes, and, in a tiny 
role, Danny Glover.</P>
<P>In all, 'The Prince of Egypt' is not to be missed.  Forgo other holiday 
films for this one, regardless of your age.  It is destined to be 
included in the canon of filmed Biblical literature and, besides, it's a 
lot of fun.</P>
