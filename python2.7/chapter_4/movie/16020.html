The Audience Who Knew Too Much</PRE>
<PRE>Psycho (1998)</PRE>
<P>Seen on 5 December 1998 by myself at the Cineplex First Ave and 62nd
Street for $8.75</P>
<P>Earlier this year Roger Ebert declared that the one movie that did not
need to be remade was Alfred Hitchcock's *Psycho*. So of course they went
out and remade it</P>
<P>The ad campaign was very slick, leading you to believe that you might be
seeing something something new and different. Well, with very few
exceptions, you are seeing director Gus Van Sant refilm the Hitchcock
classic shot-for-shot, with all the same dialogue, and even Bernard
Herrmann's original score.</P>
<P>Now mind you, I am a bit of an expert on this film. It was my term paper
for my Hitchcock class at college, and I saw the movie four times in one
week while studying the shot-by-shot analysis in a book--appropriately
entitled *Psycho*.</P>
<P>So it was actually disappointing to see nothing new. The few additions
made by van Sant are distracting at best--like the cutaways to fuzzy video
images during Crane's and Arbogast's murders. Why? It simply ruins the two
best scenes in the movie.</P>
<P>While refilming the movie shot-for-shot "brings it to a new audience"--and
in color--it becomes dated. Elements from the original that placed it in
1960, like detectives wearing hats, having the operator "put the call
through" and a motel that suffers because "they moved the highway" are
misplaced here. Meanwhile, references to her Walkman make Lila Crane
(Julianne Moore) a commercial for Sony.</P>
<P>Oh, and adding slapping noises as a Norman masturbates while peeping at a
disrobing Marion is completely unnecessary. Subtlety, Gus, subtlety,
please. Hitchcock's audiences knew how to fill in the blanks quite nicely
on their own. Contrasted to the dullness of telling the story
moment-for-moment as the original, the audience's derisive laughter is
well deserved.</P>
<P>Because the new version is in color, there is some room for new movement,
but the only option played is to give Marion (Anne Heche) an orange motif.
The reasons for this are not clear, or necessary.</P>
<P>While younger audiences (late teens/early twenties) might never have seen
the original, it's hard to see how it can stand up to the far more
sophisticated thrillers they surely have come expect, like *Scream*. In
it's day, killing off the star in the first third of the film and leaving
the rest of the cast to play out a new storyline (embezzlement story turns
into a murder mystery of psychotic proportions) was new, innovative.
Today, the story seems quite boring, and Viggo Mortensen (as Marion's
lover Sam) and Moore (as her sister) are the twin definitions of
uncompelling as they look into Marion's disappearance.</P>
<P>Only Vince Vaughn's crack at the Norman Bates role made famous by Anthony
Perkins keeps the story moving. He is much taller than Heche, and more
menacing than Perkins.</P>
<P>In the end, the most interesting performance is Heche's. The most
interesting part of *Psycho* (here and in the original) is the unsung
first reel in which Marion has decided to make off with her boss's cash,
and is imagining the hot pursuit she must be fleeing. In both movies, the
cop with the sunglasses is possibly the *most* menacing figure,
practically rivaling "Mother" (whose rants were better in the original).</P>
<P>Chad Everett is hilarious as the lecherous Texan businessman.</P>
<PRE>Based on the novel by Robert Bloch.</PRE>
