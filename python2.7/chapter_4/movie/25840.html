<PRE>The Cell</PRE>
<P>It's difficult to sell a serial killer movie these days. Audiences want 
another "Silence of the Lambs" or a "Se7en" but more often than not end up 
with scripts some second-under-sub-assistant-co-producer was using to keep 
his kitchen table sturdy. They're a way to win a box office for a weekend or 
two and usually fade away without much recognition. "The Cell" is along the 
lines of those flicks only this time there's a real effort made on part of 
the director and producers to come up with something original and shocking - 
they accomplish that but that doesn't make it a great movie. </P>
<P>This film is basically your run-of-the-mill mystery thriller about cops and 
the Feds trying to track down a really sick and twisted serial killer. The 
story wastes no time with a lot of details and instead just jumps right in to 
the authorities' hunt for the madman and within two or three scenes they've 
already tracked him down. We already know who he is - a nutty loner with a 
penchant for drowning women and turning them into his own personal dolls. 
He's one of the most mentally disturbed villains I've ever seen in a movie 
(and that includes supernatural horror flicks). The guy gets off on dangling 
his own flesh from chains while watching his victims die. </P>
<P>Of course for every bad guy there has to be a hero or at least a few 
wannabe/mini-heroes that add up to one almighty solver of the problem. 
Jennifer Lopez plays Catherine Deane, a child psychologist who can literally 
enter the mind of other people in a really high-tech futuristic lab that only 
exists in sci-fi movies and the like. Vince Vaughn is FBI Agent Peter Novak - 
a relatively weak character without much motivation other than the generic 
story of how a criminal walked on a technicality and he's dedicated his life 
to making sure that doesn't happen again. Somehow Novak and his crew learn of 
Deane's process and want to use it on the killer who is in a deep catatonic 
state when they catch him. There's a lot of jive about how he suffers from a 
rare form of schizophrenia and he'll never snap out of it. That sucks because 
there's one more still-living victim to be found and she'll die if they can't 
find out where she is. Put two and two together and you've suddenly got a 
journey into the mind of a madman on the slight chance they might be able to 
reach his logical side for a moment to discover the girl's location. </P>
<P>Now that that's said and done we can get to what the REAL point of the film 
is - the dream sequences. Actually it isn't so much a dream as it is an 
exploration of the subconscious. The human mind is a strange and fascinating 
thing we'll never be able to understand fully, which means if you're going to 
make a movie about the inside of a killer's mind it's a license to go hog 
wild. At least "The Cell" succeeds on this level. For large bulks of time 
it's basically a filmed acid trip - an animated M.C. Escher or Salvidor Dalî 
painting. It's sci-fi, horror, fantasy and drama all mixed into one. There's 
a lot of disturbing, creepy images that go beyond S&M and are just plain 
psychotic. It's shocking and it's not - shocking because the art direction 
and production design are so meticulous in detail to convey such an 
atmosphere that would and should be terrifying if it didn't seem like such a 
cliche horror movie set. We see what made the killer who and what he is and 
we're supposed to feel sorry for him. </P>
<P>What keeps the film from being great is that this is pretty much all it has 
going for it. There's virtually no characterization and the screenplay is 
pretty mediocre. How the mind transferring process works isn't explained (and 
should be because the reality of the film is the same as our own, it's not 
like the reality from "The Crow" or something). Lopez's character doesn't 
seem like a psychology professional at all, just a cartoony heroine. Vaughn's 
character at least has some built-in motivation due to the fact he's an FBI 
agent and the case is personal to him (has there ever been a movie where the 
FBI agent didn't take the case personally?). All the supporting characters 
are simply pawns with no apparent free will of their own - they just do 
whatever Lopez and Vaughn tell them to. </P>
<P>Their purpose of going into the killer's mind is to find the girl's location 
- they don't learn that directly. Instead, a symbol in his mind points out 
something to the detectives and starts a chain reaction. Had they done better 
police work to begin with the whole mind-meld thing wouldn't have been 
necessary in the first place (but then the film would only be about 10 
minutes long). </P>
<P>Although "The Cell" has something of an original plot and direction going for 
it, the screenplay is too weak and cannot support it. There's a lot of 
interesting stuff to look at here but it's mostly gratuitous art direction. </P>
