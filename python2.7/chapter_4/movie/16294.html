                      Copyright 1999 Timothy Voon

<P>For a movie that was initially intended for Tom Cruise, it hasn't turned
out half bad with Will Smith instead. Will isn't the likely candidate
for any form of conspiracy campaign, but does well – toning down his
usual smugness, for a serious dramatisation of a lawyer being hunted
down by the state. The ENEMY OF THE STATE is a good thriller, although
reliant on the mere chance occurrence of several missing videotapes in
order for the ending to work out so finely. Despite this over-contriving
of the plot to bring about the conclusion, there is little else to
complain about. The viewer senses the terror of being continuously
watched, chased, monitored by video cameras, bugging devices,
state-of-the-art satellites - all pitted against an innocent man who
stumbles across a conspiracy by accident. This sort of the movie works
on one's paranoia, and will no doubt fuel public opinion against
government intrusions on privacy. One doesn't sleep easy knowing how
easy it is for every part of your life to become open to the eyes of the
world. This movie fares much better than THE NET which follows a similar
premise.</P>
