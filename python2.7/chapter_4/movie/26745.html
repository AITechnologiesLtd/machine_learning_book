<P>TITAN A.E is like a Saturday Morning Cartoon version of STAR WARS. I didn't 
really care for it, but then I didn't like STAR WARS either. That film, for 
all its ingenious crossover marketing coups, is one helluva hollow space 
opera, a movie that managed to single handedly turn one of the most 
fascinating film genre's into bargain matinee trash all while audiences and 
critics cheered on. The effects of STAR WARS are still felt today, seen in 
lame brained space westerns of recent years like BATTLEFIELD EARTH, LOST IN 
SPACE, WING COMMANDER and SUPERNOVA. I loathe STAR WARS for what it did to 
science fiction. And TITAN A.E proudly carries on its tradition. Twenty years 
later, after the cinematic death of intelligent science fiction, TITAN A.E 
comes at us with everything that made STAR WARS crap (lame comic relief, 
horrible dialogue, non-existent characters) and its few strengths (terrific 
visuals) as well.</P>
<P>Don Bluth's (THE SECRET OF NIMH, AN AMERICAN TAIL) production replaces the 
typical gee-whiz Mark Hamil kid-hero with a more modern, cynical Luke 
Skywalker figure, Cale, voiced with wry Will Hunting sarcasm by Matt Damon 
whose affect rarely reveals anything beyond vague annoyance. He's as equally 
bland as Skywalker but in a wry self-aware DAWSON'S CREEK sort of way. He's 
the wiseacre hero for the late 90's\early millennium, all those "gosh, golly 
geeisms" replaced with "Whatevers".</P>
<P>As the film opens we meet Cale as a young mop topped child who's forced to 
flee the earth with his well-built father (who might have walked in from a GI 
JOE cartoon). It's actually quite a scene- a near classic moment as the peace 
of a barren earth is rapidly interrupted by monstrous, bug-like space ships 
blasting away at everything in sight. Cale and his father are divided, the 
mop topped one escaping in a separate ship that flys past earth just as our 
beloved planet explodes into a glitter of galvanic rock. It's exciting and a 
bit unsettling. For just a moment I was ten years old again, re-living the 
thrills of EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (the only truly great film in the STAR WARS 
quartet, one that melds substance with excitement in a way the original 
didn't even attempt) and creating massive space operas of my own with GI JOE 
and TRANSFORMER action figures. This could be it, I thought. This could 
finally be that summer movie I'd been pinning for. I smiled ear to ear, laid 
back, then to my extreme dismay, some annoying Jar-Jar esque comic relief 
figures arrive, which served to immediately shake me from my state of child 
like wonder back into the state of nitpicky movie critic.</P>
<P>It's years after the prologue and Cale is now drawn to look like a BACKSTREET 
BOY. He's a laborer drilling away at space rocks as the camera hyperbolically 
spins to and fro while rock music blares. Yes this is one of those. Our hero 
is approached by a gruff soldier (voiced by Bill Pullman, doing his best 
Tommy Lee Jones), who informs him that the location of the TITAN, a spaceship 
that his father engineered, is etched in Cale's DNA. Cale is interested 
enough to join the captain's ship crew and aid in the search of this mythical 
craft. Aboard the ship we meet the R2D2 and C3PO stand ins; a Kangaroo like 
creature with a pig-like snout voiced with added cynicism by sarcasm 
personified, Janeane Garofalo, and a tortoise-like creature, Gune (voiced by 
John Leguizamo), who like Jar-Jar has the temerity to refer to himself in 
third person. Meanwhile Cale falls for the only other human shipmate (what, 
you got somethin' against inter species dating, Cale?), Akima (an Aeon Flux 
look-alike voiced with valley girlish apathy by Drew Barrymore), who 
immediately dislikes Cale which cues us to believe that by the end, they'll 
be smooching arm in arm.</P>
<P>The story is largely irrelevant, as the movie seems to spend the brunt of its 
energy on creating eye-popping visuals, nearly all of which are suitably 
enthralling. The most effective being a blood-pumping chase through the Ice 
Rings of Tigran, a locale made up entirely of large, reflective ice crystals 
that shatter with the slightest tap.</P>
<P>For science fiction purists (the kind who read L. Ron Hubbard like it's the 
bible or something) TITAN A.E may be a bit too unrelenting in its anime meets 
Playstation visuals set to constant Alterna rock; it's almost like an 
advanced, scripted version of those psychedelic 60's film reels that 
counterculture rebels goggled at while passing joints. The various directors' 
certainly go the distance visually; their attempts to mix 3-D computer 
animation effects with the traditional 2-D animated drawings is near-seamless.</P>
<P>Despite the inventive eye candy, I began to desire a bit more substance with 
my FX demo, but really, what did I expect from a cartoon? TITAN A.E is about 
on par with Don Bluth's other workmanlike animated attempts to usurp Disney. 
It has some unexpected moments like a bit wherein our heroes attempt to foil 
a big, dumb looking guard who actually turns out to be quite intelligent. But 
then it has far too many scenes like the one where Cale and Akima fix a 
gigantic run down space craft during a montage that makes it look about as 
easy as jump starting a Mustang. Or the one where the lead baddie yells to 
his minions (while in the midst of battle),"Destroy the ice shield that 
protects the Titan". Oh, that ice shield. To paraphrase former NEW YORK 
magazine film critic John Simon, "TITAN A.E will do very nicely for those 
lucky enough to be childish or unlucky enough never to have grown up". I'm 
sure Mr.Lucas is very pleased.</P>
