<PRE>BOYS ON THE SIDE                                     Rated "R" / 117 min.
================</PRE>
<P>Road trip!  On their way to L.A., driving companions Whoopi Goldberg and
Mary Louise-Parker stop to pick up a friend (Drey Barrymore) in
Pittsburg.  She's just ko-ed her abusive husband with a baseball bat and
needs to both get away and stay away.  So they head out to the highway,
ready to play tunes and paint toenails.  Sound familiar?</P>
<P>Call it another "chick flick," but this logical successor to THELMA AND
LOUISE delivers an intriguing message about the price of freedom.  From
the POV of screenwriter Don Roos, the cost of empowerment includes
pregnancy, AIDS, and a six-month jail sentence.  Directed by Herbert
Ross (STEEL MAGNOLIAS).</P>
<PRE>Grade: B-</PRE>
<PRE>HIGHLANDER III                                       Rated "R" / 109 min.
==============</PRE>
<P>As an old science-fiction geek from long, long ago, I thought I'd find
at least *something* to enjoy in the doomed HIGHLANDER III.  Wrong.
This is direct-to-video fare at it's finest, with plotting that would
shame even the cheapest comic book.  Mario Van Peebles (!) plays the
sword-wielding villain, who returns from a 400-year imprisonment to
battle Christopher Lambert and his mysterious accent.</P>
<PRE>There should've been only one.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: F</PRE>
<PRE>IMMORTAL BELOVED                                     Rated "R" / 121 min.
================</PRE>
<P>AMADEUS it ain't.  Gary Oldman is certainly right for the role of Ludwig
van Beethoven.  He can brawl like the best rock star and brood like the
most serious composer.  He even plays his own piano, which, in this
film, is no small feat.  Too bad the CITIZEN KANE-like structure of
writer/director Bernard Roses's biography-as-a-mystery never uncovers
anything interesting.  Great soundtrack, though, if you don't mind the
conspicuous absence of period instruments.</P>
<PRE>Ode to joy indeed.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: C+</PRE>
<PRE>IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS                              Rated "R" / 108 min.
=======================</PRE>
<P>Horror helmer John Carpenter is behind this painfully slow story of a
hard-boiled insurance investigator (Sam Neill) trying to track down a
missing Stephen King-sort (Jurgen Prochnow).  The I.I. believes the
disappearance to be a publicity stunt, until he ends up trapped in the
author's fictional town.</P>
<P>The premise is great, but Carpenter's pacing is all wrong.  He doesn't
even frame the story very well.  Neill does what he can with a very
unappealing character.  He's no fun to watch.  A better mystery might be
to figure out how John Glover, David Warner, and Charleton Heston (!)
were corralled into this mess.</P>
<PRE>Grade: C-</PRE>
<PRE>THE JERKY BOYS                                       Rated "R" /  82 min.
==============</PRE>
<P>They are a pair of pranksters from Queens who specialize in abusive,
obscene phone calls.  Their strengths are their voices, which help
breath to life such unforgettable characters as the irate Frank Rizzo
and the hapless Sal Rosenberg.  What the Jerky Boys are *not* are
actors, and this movie makes the mistake of trying treat them as same.</P>
<P>A truly innovative script would've kept the Boys (Johnny Brennan and
Kamal) hidden off-screen for the entire film.  This slop reveals their
identities within the first five minutes--a mistake from which the film
never recovers.  Sure, the two recreate some of their better-known bits
to amusing effect, but the bulk of the film is just one, long chase
scene.  And what are William Hickey, Alan Arkin, Ozzy Osbourne, and Tom
Jones doing here?</P>
<P>Executive produced by Tony Danza and Emilio Estevez (!).</P>
<PRE>Grade: D+</PRE>
<PRE>MURDER IN THE FIRST                                  Rated "R" / 130 min.
===================</PRE>
<P>This overdirected courtroom drama would like to be as exciting as A FEW
GOOD MEN, but director Marc Rocco doesn't have enough sense to keep his
camera still during the best parts.  He swirls and twirls through every
scene as if he were filming a wrestling match.  Both Kevin Bacon and
Gary Oldman (again!) are quite good, but Christian Slater is a loss.
He's too much of a lightweight for this sort of stuff.</P>
<PRE>A long sit.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: C</PRE>
<PRE>RED                                                  Rated "R" /  99 min.
===</PRE>
<P>You don't have to see either BLUE or WHITE to enjoy RED, director
Krzysztof Kieslowski's final installment in his TROIS COLOURS trilogy.
RED is also the final film for the director, who has announced his
retirement.  Chance encounters are one of the many ways that this
captivating--and puzzling--film explores the idea that we are all
connected in ways we never realize.  Front and center is a love story
between a fashion model (Irene Jacob) and a retired judge (Jean-Louis
Trintignant).  Subtitled.</P>
<PRE>Grade: A-</PRE>
<PRE>TO LIVE                           Not rated, suggested "PG-13" / 130 min.
=======</PRE>
<P>If you're in the mood for another sweeping family saga ala LEGENDS OF
THE FALL, then try TO LIVE.  Director Zhang Yimou (RAISE THE RED
LANTERN) recounts three decades of Chinese history as seen through the
eyes of a poor, working-class couple (Ge You and Gong Li).  You won't
see anything like Brad Pitt here, but you *will* get a remarkably
detailed portrait of Life Under Mao.  Winner of two awards at last
year's Cannes film festival including Best Actor.  Subtitled.</P>
