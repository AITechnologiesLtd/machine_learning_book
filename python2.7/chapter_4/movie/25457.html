Susan Granger's review of "THE IN-CROWD" (Warner Bros.)</PRE>
<P>         The kindest way to describe this teensploitation movie is to
call it "a time waster." Violence-prone nymphomaniac Adrien Williams
(Lori Heuring, looking just like Madonna) has spent time in a
psychiatric hospital learning to come to terms with "erotomania" and
her troubled past. Nearly recovered and on the recommendation of her
physician (Daniel Hugh Kelly), she emerges to build a quiet,
anonymous, new life as a lowly cabana-girl at an exclusive seaside
country club. But she's too lovely not to be noticed by "the
in-crowd," a privileged clique led by perky, psychopathic Brittany
Foster (Susan Ward, looking just like Denise Richards), whose lip
gloss glows for the tennis pro (Matthew Settle) who, predictably,
flirts with Adrien. Amidst the simmering feuds, there are lethal
secrets that threaten to emerge. Is this world-shaking, or what?
Directed by Mary Lambert ("Pet Sematary"), this wannabe girl-on-girl
thriller is definitely a hard-bodied loser with great credit going to
the imbecilic, homo-erotic screenplay by Mark Gibson and Philip
Halprin. Even the climactic cat-fight between Adrien and Brittany
isn't clearly delineated since it's photographed by Tom Priestley in a
storage room with gloomy, dim lighting.  The message of the movie:
appearance isn't everything...i.e: all that glitters is not gold. Duh!
On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The In-Crowd" is a sluggish,
ludicrous, barely tolerable 1. It gives melodrama a bad name - and
it's not gonna get better on video.</P>
