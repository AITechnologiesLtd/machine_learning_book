<P>         No single performance in any movie this year has divided
audiences like Chris Tucker's ultra-swishy DJ Ruby Rodd in ``The Fifth
Element.''</P>
<P>  To some, it was the most daring acting stunt since Nicolas
Cage's squeaking Romeo in ``Peggy Sue Got Married.'' To others, it was
either A) a disgusting gay stereotype that ruined the movie, or B) an
aggressively irritating caricature that wore out its welcome after
five minutes.</P>
<P>  Tucker was not the main attraction of ``The Fifty Element,''
but he's the whole show in ``Money Talks,'' a self-congratulatory
showcase he also executive-produced.</P>
<P>  Like the worst Eddie Murphy movies, ``Money Talks'' serves
up a crude blend of flip comedy and jarring violence. Tucker plays
Franklin Hatchett, a car-wash worker who scalps tickets on the
side. Busted by TV reporter James Russell (Charlie Sheen, still
charisma-free after all these years) for no real reason other than to
get the story rolling, Hatchett soon becomes embroiled in a scheme by
some none-too-slick French thieves to get hold of a cache of diamonds.</P>
<P>  How dumb are these crooks? The rocks are hidden inside the
dashboard of a rare Jaguar that's about to go up for auction, and
instead of stealing the car, these guys bid on it.</P>
<P>  Tucker again uses the Michael Jackson-on-helium voice he
employed as Ruby Rodd, and for good reason: It seems to be the only
trick in his bag.</P>
<P>  Whereas Murphy, even on a bad day, can hit you with a
devastating impersonation or some inspired ad-libbing, Tucker's comedy
consists entirely of him screeching profanities.</P>
<P>  Tucker's limited act is easier to take if it's being played
off someone like Bruce Willis in ``Fifth,'' but Sheen's glowering
pseudo-intensity gives Tucker nothing to react to. The lamebrained
screenplay eventually has Russell sheltering the fugitive Hatchett two
days before Russell's wedding, meaning that Russell must drag Hatchett
along to the rehearsal dinner at his future in-laws' Beverly Hills
estate, and guess what Hatchett does there? He steals things! Fresh
idea, huh?</P>
<P>  Heather Locklear, in a miniscule role as Russell's fiancee,
looks like she was dragged to the set after a sleepless night. The
gifted Elise Neal has nothing to do but scold and scurry about as
Hatchett's pregnant girlfriend.</P>
<P>  At least both women were spared participation in the fatuous
finale that finds Hatchett and Russell being chased by bad dudes all
over the Los Angeles Coliseum, which someone has thoughtfully left
wide open and unguarded at 3 a.m. While helicopters explode, rockets
fly into the stands and villains shoot holes through one another,
Tucker squeals loud and long.  Here's hoping he gets the Ned Beatty
part when ``Deliverance'' is finally remade.</P>
