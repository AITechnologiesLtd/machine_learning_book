JAMON, JAMON
(HAM HAM)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>Everyone knows that good marketing can sell bad films, but
this phenomenon isn't limited to the plebeian masses. Even
the critics might fall for couple of well-thought
catchphrases and give raving reviews to films that don't
deserve it. That slogan can be something like "outrageous
sexy comedy coming from the country of Pedro Almodovar".
This is the only way to explain why JAMON, JAMON, 1992
comedy by Spanish director J.J. Bigas Luna, won all those
festival prizes.</P>
<P>The plot takes place in small Spanish town where young Jose
Luis (played by Jordi Mola) works in the underwear factory
owned by his parents. His 18-year girlfriend Sylvia (played
by Penelope Cruz), who works in the factory, is pregnant so
Jose Luis decides to propose her. Jose Luis' mother Conchita
(played by Stefania Sandrelli) sees this as unacceptable,
since Sylvia's mother Carmen (played by Anna Galiena)
happens to be notorious local prostitute. In order to break
the engagement Conchita hires services of local stud and
underwear model Raul (played by Javier Bardem) who is
supposed to seduce Sylvia. However, her scheme doesn't go as
planned - Conchita falls in love with Raul, Jose Luis finds
solace in Carmen, while Jose Luis' father begins making
moves on his son's fiancee.</P>
<P>JAMON, JAMON was supposed to be comedy but is actually a
drama. Lack of humour is just one of its problems - Bigas
Luna desperately tries to compensate laughs with series of
outrageous romantic twists more suitable for South American
soap operas. His attempts to give some "cool" visual
identity to the film through Freudian images or explicitly
sexual images barely keep our attention because of their
repetitiveness. Acting is fine, but commanding screen
personality of Javier Bardem, as well as girl- next-door
charm of Penelope Cruz seem wasted. The ending sacrifices
dramatic plausibility for the sake of "meaningful" final
shot and therefore only underlines the impression of a movie
which could be perfectly described by the phrase
"artsy-fartsy".</P>
