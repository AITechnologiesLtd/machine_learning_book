<P>Based upon "The Taming of the Shrew" by William Shakespeare</P>

Oleynik</P>
<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P> Coming out of the movie theatre I began my weekly ritutal about telling the
staff of the cinema, including the cute new worker who keeps begging me to
put her in one of my reviews, how good or bad the movie I just saw was.  It
is the equivilant of pointing the thumbs north or south.  In the case of Ten
Things I Hate about You, my comment was "No where near as dumb as I
expected."  Behind me a bunch of high school Freshmen were gabbing about how
hot the guys looked or how sweet the story was while their very bored
boyfriends did the thing that very bored boyfriends have learned to do very
well.  Nod and smile politely.</P>
<P> Seeing as the main word that kept coming up in their lemming-like
consciousness was "hip", I decided to do what I do best: burst a bubble.</P>
<P> "I wonder if they know," I said loud enough that they could hear, "if the
film they just liked so much was based on a William Shakespeare play."</P>
<P> "What?" came a nervous pipsqueak of a voice from behind me.</P>
<P> "Yeah," I turned.  "It's based on 'The Taming of the Shrew'.  They changed
the place and the dialogue and some of the names around but the basic story
is intact.  You just watched Shakespeare."</P>
<P> An eerie silence came over the entorage.  My only impression is that they
felt guilty, almost dirty, about having liked something by the Immortal Bard
that didn't star Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes packing 9mm's.</P>
<P> This brings me to point number one of the "10 things I don't hate about 10
Things I Hate About You."</P>
<P> 1. It's underhanded.  It takes Shakespeare, the dread of high school
students everywhere, and puts him in a teenage movie with a cool soundtrack.
What's worse, it has very little Elizabethian dialouge, no big stars, and it
actually makes them laugh.</P>
<P> 2. It imports actors.   Sure, we all love imported food and we really love
imported cars (give me a BMW anyday), but do we like imported actors.  No,
we loathe them.  That is, everyone who likes pulp movies loathes them (The
Thunder from Down Under excluded).  However, 10 Things... a pulp film to the
core, has an imported lead.</P>
<P> 3. It has a brain.  No further explanation.</P>
<PRE> 4. It has a comeback.</PRE>
<P> 5. It doesn't get lost somewhere between the 17th century and the 20th
century.</P>
<P> 6. It has a guidance counselor who writes sex novels.  So I'm human.</P>
<P> 7. Feminist music plays a large part in the movie yet Gwen Stefani is
nowhere to be found.</P>
<P> 8. It has teenagers who know show tunes.  Surreal, but very fun.</P>
<P> 9. The unpopular character is the one you love the most.</P>
<P> 10. For once, not everyone in the movie salivates over a model with no
brain.</P>
<P> 10 Things... is a movie that is blessed with a set of fine adaptors, a
director that I will remember the name of for his/her next film, and
performances by up and coming actors and actresses.  Like She's all That,
which had the audacity to make its satiric target its target audience, 10
Things... goes about in an underhanded way making the idiots laugh and the
wise man laugh harder.</P>
<P> I honestly don't see how anyone under 25 could hate this film.<HR>_____________________
