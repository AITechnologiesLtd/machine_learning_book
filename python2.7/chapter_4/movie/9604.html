<PRE>Halloween (1978)
A film review by David Wilcock
(C)1997 David Wilcock</PRE>
<P>Starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence
Directed By John Carpenter (The Thing, Escape from New York)
A Compass Films Production.</P>
<P>In this likeable slasher movie, a seriously disturbed boy (who, although
he's called Michael Myers, has nothing to do with the Mike Myers of Waynes
World's fame!) kills his sister, gets locked up in a mental home, and,
thirty years later, escapes, ready to terrorise his neighbourhood again.
Pleasence knows about him and tries to stop him, Curtis soon  learns about
him and tries to stop it. It basically amounts to a load of jump scenes put
together very slickly.</P>
<P>The film is standard jumpy fare. It's the sort of film where the lead
character would see something rustling behind the bushes, would walk up to
the bush slowly, would look round the bush slowly...and.....there's nothing
there! S/he, of course would then turn around, and bump into the local
sheriff/old guy/kid, giving the hero, and the audience, a short scare. The
film does this well. The audience gets nervous because they don't know if
something will jump out the bushes/cupboard/door. Of course, the film has
it's fair amount of gore, there's lots of silly supporting characters who
do silly things, and the usual sex scene. In theory this should be very
tacky, but Carpenter directs it in such a way, and the music plays scarily
throughout, you can't help but feel a little nervous and scared.</P>
<P>Sadly, however, the ending can't hold up. It's silly, and not very scary.
In fact, I thought the ending took an easy route out, and left itself open
for a sequel (which, of course, they have been loads of). In fact, like The
Game, the ending let down the film a bit. However, I still recommended
this, especially if you get a big group of friends, turns the lights out,
and make silly noises throughout. </P>
<PRE>Overall Rating=***1/2 out of *****
