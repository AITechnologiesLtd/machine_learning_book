<P>When you graduate from high school and have absolutely no intention of going 
to college, and little interest in getting a nine-to-five job, where do you 
go from there? 18-year-old Enid (Thora Birch) isn't quite sure. An offbeat, 
"tell-it-like-it-is" kind of girl with a best friend in Rebecca (Scarlett 
Johansson), they leave their graduation ceremony by stomping on their caps 
and giving the school the middle finger, never looking back. But there's a 
little sadness on Enid's part in leaving a place where, although she realizes 
she wasted her time at, at least had a sense of security in knowing what she 
was supposed to be doing with her time. </P>
<P>"Ghost World," directed by Terry Zwigoff (1995's award-winning documentary, 
"Crumb"), is a bleak comedy filled with both humor and deep-seeded 
insecurities. Based on the cult comic book by Daniel Clowes, the movie is a 
perceptive and darkly funny look at post-adolescent bewilderment, a time 
between being a child and an adult when you simply don't know where you 
should be going, and what your goals should be. Capturing this stage of 
development with just the right amount of pathos and thoughtfulness, director 
Zwigoff has created a rich, one-of-a-kind character study that proves 
difficult to shake. </P>
<P>Enid and Rebecca do have some sort of future goal, which is to move into an 
apartment together. Rebecca diligently garners a job at a local Starbucks 
(she realizes money is a necessity in moving out on your own), while Enid 
doesn't seem to have the gumption to do much of anything but while away her 
hours on her own terms. Required to take a summer art class with an 
unconventional feminist teacher (Illeana Douglas) in order to officially 
receive her diploma, Enid spends the rest of her time running around with 
Rebecca, stopping at coffee shops to "people-watch," and dropping by a 
convenience store to bug one of their classmates, Josh (Brad Renfro). </P>
<P>Just for kicks, Enid and Rebecca jokingly answer a personals ad, only to spy 
on the terribly shy and dorky Seymour (Steve Buscemi) waiting listlessly for 
a woman who is not going to show up. Enid is surprised to find herself 
sympathizing with Seymour all of a sudden, and ends up striking up a 
friendship with him when she starts drifting away from the more ambitious 
Rebecca. </P>
<P>"Ghost World" is the type of motion picture that isn't as much concerned 
about its eventual destination as it is about the path that our heroine, 
Enid, will take in order to get there. Enid can be a little cruel and 
stubborn at times, but she does have a good heart, and as her life progresses 
throughout the summer, she finds what little plans she used to have slowly 
drift away. Enid is one of the most purely original character creations in 
years, and turns out to also be one of the most likable. She may be overly 
honest and opinionated, but that is just more reason to fall in love with 
her--a young woman who plays by her own rules, other people, be damned! </P>
<P>As the unorthodox Enid, Thora Birch (1999's "American Beauty") is a 
revelation. Having to more or less carry the entire film on her shoulders, 
Birch jumps at the chance of making Enid her own, and doesn't shy away from 
presenting her as an occasionally difficult and admittedly flawed human 
being. Birch strikes every note to perfection, and manages to be both 
astoundingly funny and accurately heartbreaking in her quest to find her true 
self. </P>
<P>The other roles in the picture are filled by an ensemble of marvelous 
character actors, each of which could not have been better. Scarlett 
Johansson (1998's "The Horse Whisperer") has the less showy of the two 
central roles, but in many ways, her Rebecca is every bit as poignant as that 
of Enid. Johansson auspiciously paints Rebecca as a girl who feels both 
obligated and frustrated by her friendship with Enid, as what their looking 
for in life eventually becomes quite different. As the hopelessly nerdy 
Seymour, Steve Buscemi (2000's "28 Days") is equally touching. Buscemi has 
decided not to make Seymour someone to be pitied, but to almost admire for 
both his kindness and his unadulterated love for music and records, and this 
was definitely the correct choice. Finally, Illeana Douglas (1999's "Stir of 
Echoes") is a downright hoot as the groovy art teacher who encourages her 
students to express themselves in any way they know how. </P>
<P>"Ghost World" is uncompromisingly dark, to be sure, but much natural humor 
that comes out of the characters and situations allows it to also stand as a 
comic delight. When Enid finally does get a job, for example, it is to work 
at a movie theater, but she is fired on the first day. When one customer asks 
if they serve alcohol at the concession stand, Enid's response is, "I wish! 
Actually, you should wish, because after seeing this movie you're gonna wish 
you had ten beers!" And when another customer orders a buttered popcorn, Enid 
presents it to her by saying, "Here's your yellow chemical sludge." </P>
<P>The ending of "Ghost World" does not wrap things up in any conventional way, 
but that is in staying with the spirit of Enid, who wishes to be different in 
every way from other people sucked into manipulative commercialism. The final 
scene is thought-provoking and open-ended, to say the least, but it lacks 
that final close-up of our heroine that would have given it all the closure 
it needed. As is, the finale isn't entirely successful, but it is undoubtedly 
appropriate. </P>
<P>In a summer filled with the usual, countless explosions and special effects, 
here is a remarkably assured, "smaller" feature that is a far more satisfying 
experience than, say, "Planet of the Apes." With "Ghost World," 
writer-director Terry Zwigoff has crafted one of the best films of the year, 
a movie that takes a painstakingly realistic look at the difficulties of 
growing up. </P>
