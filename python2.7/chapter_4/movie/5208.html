                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  **1/2  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1991)</PRE>
<P>NAKED GUN 2-1/2 is more of the same from the Zucker brothers.  And while
the same is still sufficiently funny, it's hard not to yearn for some new
tricks from these old comedy dogs.  David and Jerry Zucker are just
coasting on their proven Airplane formula of piling silliness upon
stupidity.  The laughs are still there, but considering that these guys
could make 100 of these films in their sleep, you can't help wondering what
the point is.  Where's the challenge?  Where's the film's creative spark?
A few of the sight gags are extremely creative, including a hilarious pot
shot at Michael Dukakis.  But, for the most part, the sameness of the
moronic humor has made the jokes bland.  The result: 2-1/2 is difficult to
distinguish from the Zuckers' previous efforts, including the original
NAKED GUN.  And yet, when a movie makes you laugh about once every 30
seconds, it's hard, and unfair, to complain too strenuously.</P>
