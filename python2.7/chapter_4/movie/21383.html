THE SEARCHERS (1956)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>First time I heard about THE SEARCHERS, 1956 western by John
Ford, it was mentioned as the best film of all times. At the
time, I was rather sceptical towards all those critics
pronouncing the best films of all times and I had to wait
few more years before I understood the real importance of
THE SEARCHERS. Soon after I had watched BANOVIC STRAHINJA,
1981 medieval drama shot in former Yugoslavia, I read few
articles that claimed that the story had been obviously
inspired by Ford's film. The story was actually inspired by
15th Century Serbian epic poem, and since it is rather hard
to imagine John Ford taking such an exotic and obscure
inspiration for his westerns, another conclusion must be
drawn. The story of THE SEARCHERS probably has a lot of
resemblance with many similar stories, myths and legends
told in different centuries on different continents - it is
one of those rare films that actually looks like a part of
universal collective unconscious. That is the reason why
this film is so important, and why it is considered to be
one of the best films by John Ford, but also one of the best
films made in this century.</P>
<P>The story begins in Texas in 1868. Three years after the end
of Civil War, Ethan Edwards (played by John Wayne), former
Confederate soldier is now wandering through the wastelands
of Texas. Brief visit to his brother Aaron (played by Walter
Coy) is interrupted when the group of Texas Rangers, led by
Reverend/Captain Samuel Johnson Clayton (played by Ward
Bond), comes to recruit volunteers in order to pursue group
of cattle thieves. Ethan joins the party, together with
Martin Pawley (played by Jeffrey Hunter), Aaron's
part-Cherokee adopted son, and they follow the trail until
they find the cattle slaughtered. They soon realise that the
cattle was stolen by a Comanche war party led by Chief Scar
(played by Henry Brandon), only to lure the men out of their
farms and leave their families unprotected. Rangers rush
back but it is too late for Aaron's family, which is
savagely massacred, with sole surviving little girl Debbie
(played by Lana Wood) taken captive. Ethan and Martin are
going after Comanches in order to rescue little Debbie and
take revenge. But the Chief Scar and his band prove elusive,
and two men spend years roaming the West in fruitless
search. Younger Martin is actually ready to quit, settle
down and marry his sweetheart Laurie Jorgensen (played by
Vera Miles). The only thing that prevents him is Ethan and
his ever growing hatred towards Comanches, hatred that might
even lead to killing Debbie, now probably turned into Indian
squaw after all those years outside Western civilisation.</P>
<P>Great popularity enjoyed by THE SEARCHERS among the critics
and film scholars could be explained with the fact that
Ford's movie explores some great philosophical questions -
human identity, eternal struggle between irrational and
rational tendencies within human beings. And such questions
don't appear in some hermetic "artsy" movie, they are asked
in a movie that belongs to the genre of rather
crowd-pleasing western. All this is wrapped nicely in the
script by Frank S. Nugent, based on a 1954 novel by Alan Le
May. On the other hand, splendid colour photography by
Winton C. Hoch and beautiful landscapes of Monument Valley
locations shouldn't fool anyone - THE SEARCHERS is very
serious and dark film, one of the darkest films of its time.
It shows Old West as visually magnificent, but very dark and
unpleasant place to live, always ready to awaken darkest and
most irrational tendencies among human beings - material
greed, sexual depravity and homicidal rage.</P>
<P>Dark overtones of the films are best embodied by its
protagonist. Legendary John Wayne gives another great and
memorable performance as typical hero of American West -
tough, hardened Westerner, one among those who turned savage
backwater of the world in the world's greatest superpower.
But, in the same time, Wayne reveals the hidden, often
forgotten other side of coin; his Ethan is tough Westerner
who fought the wilderness in order to civilisation, but in
the process he also became part of that wilderness. The real
test for every actor is play the convincing villain, and
Wayne passes that test with flying colours, because his
Ethan, although being nominal protagonist, also happens to
be the villain. His past is murky, he fought to preserve the
slavery, it is suggested that he robbed banks and probably
committed other crimes in order to earn the living. But the
most disturbing element of his character is racism, first
hinted in his mistreatment of his half-breed companion
Martin, than finally revealed in his acts of mindless,
pathological violence. Wayne should be really praised
because he managed to portray that unsympathetic character
with subtlety.</P>
<P>Ford also should be praised, because THE SEARCHERS was a
film that faced America with some thorny issues. One of
those issues was the real cause of racism among white
people. THE SEARCHERS, rather explicitly for its time,
confronts viewers with the ultimate nightmare for any
racist, open or closet - interracial sex, or, to be precise,
"violation" of white women by non-white men. Ethan is
clearly less disturbed by the fact that his family was
massacred by Indians than with the fact that the women were
raped in the process. His intent to kill Debbie becomes
evident in a moment when he realises that she is grown
enough to be regularly taken advantage of as Indian squaw.
Ford also shows a hypocritical nature of such racists - when
white men have sexual liaisons with non-white women (as
hinted in semi-humouros episode with Martin's "wife") Ethan
is joking; when there is other way around, he becomes
homicidal maniac.</P>
<P>After showing such racist attitudes, that were the dark side
of glorious American past, Ford also explicitly shows its
aftermath. Indians are portrayed as vicious killers, but
they are also portrayed as victims too. Glorious, mythical
7th Cavalry Regiment shows its true nature by
indiscriminately killing Indian women and children. Scar's
murderous rampage is also motivated with the revenge towards
white people who had killed his sons. In the end, both men -
Ethan and Scar - almost look like reflections of each other.</P>
<P>THE SEARCHERS is very good film, one of the best made in its
time, but the author of this review has some reservations
towards using the word "masterpiece". Film is rich with
details that could be discovered only with multiple
viewings, but those multiple viewings also reveal many of
the film's flaws. For example, use of comedic subplots and
characters, like eccentric Indian hunter Mose Harper (played
by excellent Hank Worden) sometimes does give a flavour of
realism and authenticity to this dark and depressing story,
but very often that could turn into grotesque, like the
presence of singing cowboy Ken Curtis playing Laurie's
"civilised" suitor, and the wedding scene is rather farcing.
The end is rather disappointing, with rather unexplained
Ethan's transformation from homicidal maniac into kind and
forgiving family man; that was probably made in order to
give this film a required happy ending.</P>
<P>In the end, THE SEARCHERS is film that belongs to the
category of so-called `important" movies - those which are
remembered less by their own merit, and more by the way they
influenced future film- makers. On the other hand, due to
the climate of "political correctness" it is unlikely that
today's Hollywood would dare to tarnish such important
legacy with a remake. This would probably represent the good
things for all those film-lovers who would like to be
introduced to that exceptional piece of classic cinema.</P>
