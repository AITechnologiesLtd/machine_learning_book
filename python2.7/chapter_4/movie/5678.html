<P>     Although Sonke Wortmann's 1994 German film has a few things going 
for it, it's hard to understand why it was such a big hit in its native 
country.  In addition to possessing a plot that approaches sexual issues 
(both homosexual and heterosexual) with refreshing candor and 
unselfconsciousness, MAYBE...MAYBE NOT boasts the presence of Katja 
Riemann (MAKING UP!), one of the best young German actresses working 
today.  Unfortunately, these assets can't bandage the film's fundamental 
flaw.  As a comedy, it's only sporadically funny, and, as a drama, it 
lacks emotional depth.</P>
<P>     MAYBE...MAYBE NOT is clumsily constructed.  It meanders, and 
doesn't seem to have a clear goal, except to say that it's possible for 
a gay man and a straight man to be friends without sleeping together.  
That's not an especially compelling statement, and this isn't an overly-
interesting forum in which to present it.  The conclusion is open-ended, 
and, while that might be okay for a more serious film, it's a drawback 
for something attempting to be a light comedy.</P>
<P>     The film begins with Doro (Riemann) discovering her live-in lover, 
Axel (Til Schweiger), having sex with another woman in the bathroom at 
their workplace.  Doro's reaction is to kick Axel out of her house, so 
he spends the rest of the day looking for a place to crash.  Eventually, 
he moves in with Norbert (Joachim Krol), a gay friend-of-a-friend-of-a-
friend.  Norbert, a shy, nerdy sort of guy, is not-so-secretly attracted 
to Axel, but the hunky hetero either doesn't notice, or pretends not to 
(the film never makes it clear which is the case).</P>
<P>     After Axel has been gone for several days, Doro decides that she 
misses him, and, when a home pregnancy test reads positive, she begins 
searching for him.  In the meantime, Axel is learning about the gay 
lifestyle, although he remains fairly secure in his heterosexuality, 
despite Norbert's attempts to "convert" him.  Ultimately, MAYBE...MAYBE 
NOT becomes a showdown of sorts between Doro and Norbert for who 
captures Axel's affections.</P>
<P>     I think we're supposed to identify with the Axel, although it's 
difficult to say for sure, because he's such a self-centered jerk.  It's 
far easier to relate to the Doro, the neglected girlfriend, or Norbert, 
the lonely gay man, but neither comes close to matching Axel for screen 
time.  MAYBE...MAYBE NOT is his film, but he's the least likable person 
in it.  It's tough to enjoy a movie like this -- especially one that's 
supposed to be a comedy -- when you have to work not to hate the main 
character.  </P>
<P>     Most of the genuinely funny moments arise out of familiar comic 
setups:  the stranger hiding in the closet, a case of mistaken identity, 
and someone arriving home earlier than expected.  Although there are 
laughs to be had from each of these situations, it's easy (bordering on 
cheap) humor.  More interesting are Wortmann's sly observations of how 
the homosexual culture stereotypes the heterosexual one.  Too often, 
however, the jokes fall flat.  It doesn't take much insight to identify 
the numerous failed attempts at humor.</P>
<P>     The acting is good, even if character development is weak.  Outside 
of the main trio, we're given a raft of types, including a drag queen 
(Rufus Beck) who makes the population of STONEWALL seem that much more 
real, and a nymphomaniac (Antonia Lang) who's every heterosexual male's 
dream.  MAYBE...MAYBE NOT certainly has good intentions, but, as every 
movie-goer knows, that's only a starting point.  This film does little 
to build on its foundation.  When it comes to seeing this movie, "maybe 
not" seems the best advice.</P>
