<PRE>                                   Q & A
                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  ***1/2  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1990)</PRE>
<P>     Director Sydney Lumet has made dozens of exceptional films over the
years; FAMILY BUSINESS was not one of them.  The limp caper comedy was
altogether forgettable, especially in comparison to Lumet's prior film, the
gut-wrenching drama RUNNING ON EMPTY.  But one mark of a great filmmaker is
the ability to bounce back from a misfire like FAMILY BUSINESS with a
bulls-eye like Q & A.</P>
<P>     In Q & A, Lumet offers a powerful and provocative look at New York
City's police force and judicial system; it's not a pretty sight.  The film
(based on the book by New York State Supreme Court Justice and former D.A.
Edwin Torres) exposes the city's ugly underbelly--the dirty cops, the
cheesy lawyers, and above all, the racist "old boy" network.  In some
respects, the movie is a routine story of police corruption.  But in other
respects, it's a bold and fiery outcry against racism, as incendiary and
infuriating as DO THE RIGHT THING or MISSISSIPPI BURNING.</P>
<P>     The film features Nick Nolte in his tough-guy mode, playing a
hot-shot detective on the N.Y.P.D. who is rotten to the core.  The movie
begins in a dark alley with Nolte blowing a guy's brains out for no
apparent reason and then claiming it was in self-defense.  Timothy Hutton
plays the young, idealistic assistant D.A. assigned to investigate the
shooting.</P>
<P>     Hutton's superior (Patrick O'Neal) assures him that the case is cut
and dried, a clear instance of self-defense.  But Hutton realizes that
there's something rotten in the state of New York when witnesses start
giving conflicting testimonies in the Q & A (the official record of what
happened).  The key witness is a drug lord (Armand Assante) who's married
to Hutton's ex-girlfriend, played by Lumet's daughter, Jenny.  Q & A
seethes with suspense and reeks of impending doom as Hutton's investigation
takes him further and further in over his head.  The inexperienced D.A.
stumbles upon a gigantic white supremacist conspiracy in which Nolte is
only a minor player.</P>
<P>     Like DO THE RIGHT THING and MISSISSIPPI BURNING, Q & A is as apt to
stimulate your mind as it is to arouse your emotions.  Few films depict raw
racial hostility so openly or so potently.  The relationships between the
characters in Q & A are complex and uneasy, sometimes explosive; there's an
undercurrent of animosity which always threatens to bubble over.  Even the
two detectives who are assisting Hutton barely get along; one is black
(Charles Dutton) and the other Puerto Rican (Luis Guzman)--an ethnic
division which ignites conflict between them.  Q & A measures up admirably
against DO THE RIGHT THING and MISSISSIPPI BURNING.  The characters seem
more credible than those in Spike Lee's troubling film, and Lumet avoids
the sensationalism which tainted Alan Parker's controversial movie.</P>
<P>     Q & A never loosens its powerful stranglehold over you, thanks to
vital performances, which remain steady even when Lumet's script starts to
wobble.  Nolte, in particular, stands out, both literally and figuratively.
Nolte tends to play either loveable lunks (DOWN AND OUT IN BEVERLY HILLS)
or gruff ruffians (EXTREME PREJUDICE).  In Q & A, he is the epitome of
nastiness: vulgar, violent, bigoted, and as dirty as they come.  The
detective's twisted, racist values have sent him straight over the edge and
turned him into a monster.  At the same time, however, the corrupt cop has
a seductive charm about him.  Nolte is unrestrained in a truly riveting
performance.</P>
<P>     In the central role, Hutton also stands tall.  Every time I see
Hutton, he surprises me.  He looks light-weight, but he is actually a fine
dramatic actor.  Unlike Michael J. Fox, Hutton has dramatic conviction to
back up his soft, pretty-boy looks.  Hutton always gives you the feeling
that the wheels are turning behind his baby blue eyes.  He would have done
well with Fox's role in CASUALTIES OF WAR.</P>
<P>     The supporting actors in the film carry their weight and then some.
Assante, as the drug dealer looking to go straight, and Jenny Lumet, as
his wife, are to the human eye what magnets are to metal.  Fyvush Finkel
has minimal screen time, but he warrants mention for his two priceless
appearances as Preston Pearlstein, a low-life Jewish lawyer.</P>
<P>     Q & A is far from perfect.  The film has a hopelessly complicated
story line which expects you to keep track of just too many names.  You
often have to strain to keep up with all the twists and turns.
Furthermore, Lumet embeds these intriguing characters into a plot which is
all too familiar to anyone who regularly watched "Miami Vice."  You get
this nagging feeling that Crockett and Tubbs are going to show up at any
minute and save Hutton's butt.</P>
<P>     To his credit, however, Lumet doesn't offer any easy answers to the
problems he raises in the film, and unlike most screenwriters, he avoids a
conventional ending as if it were the plague.  Lumet clearly is not afraid
to leave plot strands dangling and loose ends hanging.  The movie may end,
but life goes on--and not with everyone living happily ever after.  Q & A
is a sophisticated drama from a filmmaker still very much in his prime.</P>
