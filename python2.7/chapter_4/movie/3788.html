<PRE>                                  APOLLO 13
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<PRE>     Ron Howard has arrived.</PRE>
<P>     I scarcely know where to start writing about APOLLO 13, the
long-awaited story of the catastrophic 13th mission of the Apollo space
program.  I went in expecting a whole lot from Howard and his
star-studded cast (Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, Kevin Bacon, and
Bill Paxton), and they delivered in full, the star being Hanks as
usual, who brings his usual strength and subtle forcefulness to the
role of Jim Lovell, the 4-time space shot veteran who never managed to
set foot on the moon.</P>
<P>     The story of APOLLO 13 is simple and well-known to many
Americans:  on April 11, 1970, at 13:13 military time, the
Apollo-Saturn 13 spacecraft was launched, carrying a crew of three men,
bound for America's third landing on the moon.  A third moon landing
was by then rather blase to the American public--so dull and common as
to not even warrant broadcast on television.  On the way to their
destination, however, on April 13, an oxygen tank exploded, making a
moon landing impossible and the return flight home one of the most
grueling experiences imaginable.</P>
<P>     The meat of APOLLO 13 concerns this return trip:  cutting off all
the systems to save power and almost freezing to death in an unheated
space module, struggling to improvise a carbon dioxide filter to keep
from asphyxiating, almost guessing at course corrections thanks to an
unusable computer, the newfound media interest that comes along with
any tragedy, and the pain that comes with come getting so close to
something you just can't have.</P>
<P>     Hanks is a latter-day master of expressing this emotion.  As they
fly by, unable to land, we see Hanks gaze longingly out over the lunar
surface he so desperately wants to walk upon.  The pain is clearly
visible:  so near yet so far.  The rest of the cast is also superbly
matched to their roles (with the notable exception of Kathleen Quinlan
as Lovell's wife, who sleepwalks through the film).  Harris is terrific
as seething flight director Gene Krantz, determined to keep the men
alive when everyone else has given up, and Paxton turns in a
surprisingly emotional role as Fred Haise, who becomes ill on the
mission but pulls through anyway.</P>
<P>     Overall, APOLLO 13 is one of the best films of the year, right
after SHALLOW GRAVE.  Howard's seamless use of special effects (none of
the film is stock footage) blends perfectly with the 1970 kitsch of
tie-dyes, metallic gold cars, and Dick Cavett.  What he finally
delivers is something he's been shooting for during his entire career
as a director:  a painstakingly detailed, in-depth look at the mission
and the people in it, never trivializing their struggle, while
generally avoiding sensationalism as well.  All the while, Howard
manages to entertain.</P>
<P>     APOLLO 13 gets my blanket recommendation.  You know, I was never
overly superstitious about the number 13 in the past.  If nothing else,
this movie has certainly changed that.</P>
