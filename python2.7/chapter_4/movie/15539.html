<P>As a lot of you who have been reading this page for a while know, I
consider the original "Psycho" to be the best horror film ever made.
Millions of other people share that opinion with me. This creates some
mighty big shoes for a remake to fill. Some would say, "why even try?"</P>
<P>Universal would answer with, "$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$".</P>
<P>When you are remaking a film classic this legendary, the safest play
would be to make it as close to the original as possible. This is the
play the overrated Gus Van Sant (Good Will Hunting) chose to go with.
Most of this film is a shot-by-shot remaking of the original. It's
actually less of a remake and more of a retread. This will have a lot
of people asking, "what the hell is the point?"</P>
<P>Universal will answer with, "$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$".</P>
<P>There are a few mindless additions to the film (maybe a total of 3
minutes worth. All 3 minutes will be unnoticeable unless you've seen
the original at least 30 times.) which are put there to try and keep
diehard fans on their toes for two hours. A couple lines of dialogue
have been altered in a failed attempt to bring the 1960 "Psycho"
"up-to-date" with the nineties. And, most annoyingly, whenever a
killing occurs we get some sort of MTV, "Beavis and Butthead on Acid"
sort of directing style where images flash in front of our face
in-between each slice of the knife. </P>
<P>Wow . . . I wonder if this guy ever saw "Natural Born Killers" before?</P>
<P>Sadly, the film-cloning ends with the actors. The new cast just cannot
live up to the one Hitch assembled back in 1960. Anne Heche does okay
as Marion Crane, but her performance can't compare to Janet Leigh's.
Julianne Moore, an exceptional actress in past roles, just does not
seem to fit the part of Lila Crane. The "nineties" addition of
headphones blaring out rock 'n' roll definitely didn't help any. Viggo
Mortensen is absolutely unbearable as a redneck version of Sam Loomis,
a character portrayed wonderfully in the original by John Gavin.
Finally, although he gives it his best shot by over-acting and
mimicking moves which were perfected by Anthony Perkins, Vince Vaughn
comes off as nothing more than a weasly pest while playing the
infamous Norman Bates. His character doesn't even seem real, and
actually takes away from Mr. Perkin's exceptional performance. It's
almost as though Vaughn climbed inside Perkin's portrayal and beat it
into a whiney, fragmented parody.</P>
<P>This film is ridiculous. A waste of celluloid. I have never seen
anything so abhorrent come out of Hollywood. This is an insult to the
writers, producers, and more than anything, the director (Alfred
Hitchcock, of course) of the original "Psycho". It isn't played as a
tribute, being that the film fails to mention Mr. Hitchcock, or any
other members of the original cast and crew. It isn't played for
humor, such as "The Brady Bunch Movie" was. It seems like nothing more
than a gigantic rip-off meant to suck our wallets dry. Almost as if
Mr. Van Sant decided that if he waited long enough, no one would
notice. Why settle for being considered the "next" Hitchcock, when you
can simply be Hitchcock?</P>
<P>Go rent the original. Stay away from this scam. There's a unique movie
somewhere that wants your attention, instead.</P>
