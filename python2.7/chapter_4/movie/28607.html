<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>An old-fashioned "jock" flick, notwithstanding that all the basketball
players are white and the game seemed played in slo-mo. This one plays
as a moralistic tale about the temptations placed before young athletes,
and how the hook goes into them making them succumb to fix games.
Everything about the story is obvious, and it ends as predictably as it
begins. It plays like an old newsreel piece; a study of a different era
that has little relevancy for today. It was second-rate as far as acting
and the story line had the stench of a locker room smell all over its
reels. This B programmer was probably modeled after the college
basketball scandals involving City College and LIU, and a number of
other major colleges that took place during the 1950 season. The scandal
virtually killed these two schools as far as ever returning to big-time
college basketball.</P>
<P>The film opens with a worried sports columnist, Pete Ferreday (Ireland),
defending his friendship with star freshman basketball player for State
University, Johnny Long (Thompson), as a newspaper colleague utters with
disdain: "Earn your bracelet with a college degree." Pete then explains
how he first met Johnny and why he cares about him even though he was
arrested for fixing games. Pete is voice of conscience, trying to be
fair to the jocks and to the public that loves sports.</P>
<P>Johnny is a star player on his local high school, and is a nice young
man who takes care of his kid brother Mickey (Hyatt) while their father
is in a sanitarium. He has money problems and wishes to stay close to
home in his choice of college, as he needs to support the family with
part-time jobs. Pete hooks him up with veteran coach Nat Becker (Sande)
at State University, and he gets a scholarship. For the summer Johnny
finds work at the wealthy country club Cresthaven, where the basketball
team's captain also works summers.  Here he meets an attractive girl Pat
Judd (Brown) and seriously romances her, but he also meets a
manipulative sports gambler, Mike Taft (Bishop), who offers him favors
with no strings attached. But when the basketball season starts, he
offers him money to shave points by telling him he could still win the
game. At first Johnny resists, but he soon sees Jed is doing it and how
easy it is to do. When he wants to buy Pat an engagement ring and
doesn't have the money, he decides to accept the slimy Taft's money.
The jeweler tips off the vice squad that the college athlete bought a
ring for a $1,000 dollars and they tail him, which leads to his
downfall.</P>
<P>The best quote comes from Taft: "The longer they take to be bribed --
the harder they fall."</P>
