<PRE>                               AFTERGLOW
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     Although the buzz about writer and director Alan Rudolph's new
film AFTERGLOW surrounds the astonishing performance by Julie Christie,
the film offers many other delights.  Besides her Oscar-caliber work,
other stars shine in Rudolph's wonderfully complex and intentionally
ambiguous film.  Certain to invoke conversations afterwards, the film
exercises viewers' minds and emotions.</P>
<P>     Equal parts romance, tragedy and comedy, it starts slowly but soon
finds its legs.  By the end, you will be wrapped up in this four-person
drama and feel like you are wishing your quirky, old friends good-bye.</P>
<P>     As 57-year-old, B-movie actress Phyllis Mann, Julie Christie
delivers her best performance in several decades.  Married for 24
years, Phyllis wiles away her time drinking heavily and watching her
old, and admittedly awful, pictures on television.  Looking like she
gave up on life years ago, eight year ago as it turns out, she suffers
from depression.  Off to see a doctor since her "soul needs a
overhaul," she searches for some meaning or purpose to her life.</P>
<P>     Mark Isham's jazz music has a soulful trumpet playing as Phyllis
discusses her predicaments.  And Toyomichi Kurita's radiantly lovely
cinematography sets the scenes in rich and hazy colors.</P>
<P>     A lovable, shaggy-haired Nick Nolte plays Lucky Mann, a ruggedly
handsome repairman who calls himself "The Fix-It Man."  Lucky's
specialty is fixing more than just the broken faucets of his female
customers.  His wife calls him an alley cat, which he doesn't deny.
Lucky is careful in his affairs.  "I trust the ones who never sleep
around but feel like getting lucky," he explains.  (His name takes on
many meanings and is a constant source of puns in the show's
deliciously funny script, full of biting wit.)</P>
<P>     We meet the rich and sexy young Marianne Byron as she is
ovulating.  She's off to purchase a revealing gown to entice her
husband into some hot sex.  But as with Lucky and his wife, her spouse
isn't interested in having sex with her.  Playing an airhead, Lara
Flynn Boyle has Marianne down to a tee.  When she puts on clothes, she
fidgets constantly -- if I pull this part down a bit maybe I'll be
sexier, or maybe adjusting this would be better.</P>
<P>     Her pompous husband, Jeffrey Byron III, is played by Jonny Lee
Miller as the proverbial cold fish.  ("I'm Jeffrey Byron III," he
introduces himself.  "There won't be a IV.  We Byrons quit when we get
it right.")  The only character you may find yourself despising, he's
bored with his successful business, his gorgeous wife, and everything
in his easy life.  His favorite diversion is balancing precariously on
the outside ledge in his office in a skyscraper.  Fear seems to be one
of the few things that turn him on.</P>
<P>     Jeffrey constantly infuriates his wife.  "You're too stuck on
yourself to be jealous," she tells him when he finds out about her new
contractor.  She's hired Lucky, who else, to build a nursery for their
non-existent baby.</P>
<P>     Their coldly modernistic apartment, designed by Francois Seguin,
serves as the perfect metaphor for their lifeless marriage.  Everything
from the audio to the lights are controlled with a single remote, which
never seems to work right.</P>
<P>     At the same time that Lucky and Marianne are having an affair,
Jeffrey starts making eyes at Phyllis with neither realizing the
connection with their spouses.  The overconfident Jeffrey is way out of
his league when he tries to sweep Phyllis off her feet.</P>
<P>     "I live up to the very edge of my charm," he tells her in what he
deludes himself into thinking is a good come-on line.  "You're the most
fascinating woman I've met in my entire life," he tells her.  "Yes, I
know," she fires back with complete confidence.  She has him wrapped
around her finger, but he's not smart enough to know it.</P>
<P>     The body of the story can't be described without giving away some
dramatic and relatively unexpected twists in the plot.  Suffice it to
say that it builds with a furious pace.</P>
<P>     The deliberately ambiguous ending beautifully wraps up four
complicated lives as well can be expected.  The upbeat conclusion has a
carefully constructed symmetry that does not suffer from the usual
bastardization caused by too many test screening.  Alan Rudolph knows
where he want his pictures to go, and he takes them there.</P>
<P>     AFTERGLOW runs 1:54.  It is rated R for profanity, sex and brief
nudity and would be fine for mature teenagers.</P>
