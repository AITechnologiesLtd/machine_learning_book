<P>starring Tobey Maguire, Michael Caine, Charlize Theron, Delroy Lindo
screenplay by John Irving, based on his novel
directed by Lasse Hallström</P>
<P>If, occasionally during The Cider House Rules, one corner of the screen
curled up and peeled away like a turning page to reveal the next scene,
the wipe would seem entirely natural. I haven't encountered a movie that
so resembles the experience of reading a good paperback this year, no
doubt because John Irving wrote the tearjerking The Cider House Rules as
a book first and a screenplay second.</P>
<P>"Annie" it's not: at a depression-era New England orphanage-cum-abortion
clinic, Dr. Wilbur Larch (Caine) has successfully preened one of the
abandoned kids, Homer Wells (Maguire), into both his professional equal
and an upstanding young man, an example for the other boys and girls to
follow.</P>
<P>After spending twenty-some-odd years in Larch's care, Homer justly
develops wanderlust, and he leaps at the opportunity to fly the coop
with a beautiful patient, Candy (Theron), and Wally, her soldier mate
(Paul Rudd). Larch is deeply offended by his surrogate son's decision,
and reveals an X-ray indicating Homer's bad heart, which will stop
working if he gets overexcited, but neither scare tactics nor loyalty
can prevent the inevitable: true to his namesake, Homer will have his
odyssey.</P>
<P>It suits Maguire that he must remain calm and somewhat idle at all times
in The Cider House Rules, since the actor's greatest feature is a pair
of observant eyes. Before leaving for war, Wally finds Homer a new job
at a cider house, where he will be the only white employee among migrant
blacks. For those who haven't correctly presumed, Candy falls for Homer
in her boyfriend's absence, and thus begins a passionate love affair
between them. The story contains other "meanwhile"s; we are kept abreast
of Larch's frustrating situation with the bureaucrats who want to tamper
with his operation as well as that of a sick orphan named Fuzzy. The
latter constitutes a shameless subplot (right down to the adorable
child's name) born of the Chaplin tradition.</P>
<P>Caine is winning as the ether-addicted doctor, though his American
accent takes some getting used to. (The filmmakers have added a line or
two about why Larch sometimes sounds English.) I appreciated Larch's
selfishness, and Caine's willingness to play prickly. The incandescent
Theron is probably the weakest of the ensemble, through no fault of her
own-Candy is drawn as blandly wholesome (abortion notwithstanding), and
her indecision (Am I in love with Homer or Wally?) is aggravating.</P>
<P>Both Maguire and Lindo, as Mr. Rose, the boss of the cider house, are
exemplary. Lindo's initial smiley authority complements Maguire's
preternatural stillness-Mr. Rose goes through a transformation, at least
in our eyes, that I won't reveal here, which Lindo handles with finesse.
Just when the film is becoming a little too precious, Mr. Rose provides
welcome conflict, and without becoming a full-fledged villain. Lindo has
been blessed with what is, say I, the movie's most memorable scene, a
breathy, heartrending apologia.</P>
<P>Swede helmer Hallström (My Life as a Dog) hasn't strayed far from his
1993 effort, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, in stylistic terms: apart from
obvious period differences (Grape takes place in the modern era), the
two films share timeless images, as well as gentility. Just four
pictures after his American career suffered a false start with the
unengaging weepie Once Around, Hallström has Hollywood Oscar contenders
licked. Though not formulaic, The Cider House Rules is in the mode of
old-fashioned crowd-pleasers, passionate tales of self-discovery set
against a historical backdrop. If only Hallström had not relied on
Rachel Portman's syrupy and intrusive score, which confirms too often
that we're watching melodrama.</P>
<P>The Cider House Rules retained a novelistic structure in the adaptation:
its peaks feel like chapter breaks. Much is covered over the course of
two hours-and-fifteen minutes, including pro-choice (the movie argues in
favour of it with worst case scenarios, which may ruffle a few
feathers), young love, and race relations. (It's a brilliant conceit,
really: Homer's passivity not only spares the audience the arguments
that typically ensue between on-screen adulterers, it also immediately
puts his oppressed co-workers at ease-they don't consider him a threat,
despite his skin colour.) Each of these issues is carefully handled,
though the episodic nature of the plotting inevitably means that some
resolutions are more satisfying than others.</P>
<P>Where The Cider House Rules most brings to mind a John Irving read is in
its aftereffects. When the first closing credit appeared, I experienced
three stages of post-partum. First, elation-what a finish! Then came
relief-the film is so stuffed it leaves you a little bloated. Then came
a profound sense of displacement: I hadn't realized how seductive its
world was. Hallström has married delicate, spare visuals and solid
performances to Irving's low key yet enthralling narrative. The outcome
is a grandly satisfying mainstream entertainment with few shortcomings.</P>
