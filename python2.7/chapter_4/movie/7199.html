<PRE>                             CITY OF INDUSTRY
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     Being an old crook isn't easy.  You get shot at, beaten up, and
generally abused.  It's not like the old days.  There isn't even any
honor among thieves anymore.</P>
<P>     Harvey Keitel gives a masterful performance  as middle-aged
criminal Roy Egan in the crime drama CITY OF INDUSTRY.  First-time
writer Ken Solarz's script connects all the dots with a standard
formula plot, but Keitel's acting raises the movie above its pedestrian
material.  Director John Irvin, known for such light-hearted films as A
MONTH BY THE LAKE and WIDOW'S PEAK, is smart enough to fashion the
picture around Keitel and let him set the pace.</P>
<P>     Lee Egan, played with restraint by Timothy Hutton, wants to pull
off a big jewel robbery in Palm Springs.  He has been casing a jewelry
store where once a year they have two to three million dollars in
stones from Russia.  To pull it off, he asks his brother and old-pro
criminal Roy to come to town to join his gang for the big heist.</P>
<P>     Jorge Montana (Wade Dominguez) and Skip Kovic (Stephen Dorff) make
up the rest of Lee's team.  Calm and resolute Jorge needs the money for
his wife Rachel (Famke Janssen) and their kids since Jorge has just
been sentenced to prison.  Skip, "the wheelman," seems ready to explode
in every scene.  Dorff, who overacted in his most recent outing in
BLOOD AND WINE, gives a little more credible performance this time.</P>
<P>     Most of the show, which happens after the jewel theft, consists of
an elaborate cat-and-mouse game with Roy and Skip chasing each other.
Although predictable on a macro level, the actions in any given scene
are apt to surprise you.  Still, the overall feeling is that you have
seen this story many times before.</P>
<P>     So what is compelling enough to make the picture worth seeing?
Harvey Keitel.  His studied and careful acting make for some
captivating viewing.  Although he seems about to ignite and does in
many scenes, nevertheless, his is a controlled burn.  Just the way his
eyes scan a room speaks more than the dialog.  Although Roy is a
brutish killer, Keitel manages to earn the audience's empathy.  His
resilience after being left for dead almost elicits applauds.</P>
<P>     The picture undulates with a gritty melancholy.  Thomas Burstyn's
dark cinematography, although effective, has been done before by others
and done better.  Stephen Endelman's music, with various solo
instruments wailing away, sets a soulful and sad tone.</P>
<P>     Although quite a violent film, CITY OF INDUSTRY derives most of
its tension from the mental anguish of its stars.  An unimaginative but
interesting film with one excellent piece of acting.  Some stars are
enough to make the difference.  Keitel alone makes CITY OF INDUSTRY
worth seeing.</P>
<P>     CITY OF INDUSTRY runs 1:37.  It is rated R for gory violence,
nudity and profanity.  The film would be fine for older teenagers.
For Keitel's work, I give the picture thumbs up and ** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
