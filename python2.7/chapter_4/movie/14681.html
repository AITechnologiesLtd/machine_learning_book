<PRE>Almost Heroes (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>***1/2 out of *****</PRE>

Running Time: 90 minutes</P>
<P>I guess when you go into a movie with very low expectations, it's more
satisfying when the film turns out to be not so bad.  That's the case
with Chris Farley's last starring vehicle Almost Heroes.  I expected a
cross between Farley's disasterous Black Sheep and John Candy's final
film, the similarly themed Wagons East.  Thankfully, it turned out to
be pretty funny, along the lines of such low-brow comedies like
Kingpin and Dumb and Dumber.</P>
<P>The plot is a simple one: explorers Edwards and Hunt (Matthew Perry
and Chris Farley) set out on a cross country expedition a few weeks
after Lewis and Clark do, hoping to beat them to the Pacific Ocean.
The plot really doesn't mean anything however, as Almost Heroes is
mainly just a collection of sketches using the same locale.  Each
scene seems self contained, as there will be a set-up for a joke, then
the execution of that scene's main joke, and then we proceed on to the
next sketch.  Previous scenes are rarely acknowledged.</P>
<P>Thankfully, most of the jokes and situations work.  Highlights include
a campfire story with a really bizarre punchline, and Farley's
character searching for an eagle's egg.  These moments and many others
got laughs out of me, and still do whenever I think about them.
Surprisingly though, it's Matthew Perry who's the real star of the
film, as Farley seems more of a supporting character, simply providing
reasons for upper-class Perry to react to his lower-class shenanigans.
Eugene Levy is also good in his role, and I've always considered Levy
to be an underrated comedic talent.</P>
<P>What does bother me is the film's final 10 minutes or so.  The film
just completely falls apart.  Not only does Farley get carried off by
an eagle (he holds onto the eagle's legs as it flies, yeah right) but
it also re-writes history along with making the film's title
meaningless.  According to the end of the film, Edwards and Hunt BEAT
Lewis and Clark to the Pacific Ocean!  What the hell?  Also, there's
no dedication to Farley anywhere in the film's closing credits,
something that I thought would be customary.  [PG13]</P>
