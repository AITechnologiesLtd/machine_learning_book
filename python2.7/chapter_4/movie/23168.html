<P>Snow Day (2000) 1 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Chevy Chase, Mary Kay
Place and Chris Elliott.</P>
<P> "Snow Day" is a cartoonish feature that has the look and feel of a
made-for-TV movie.</P>
<P> The characters are stock, the situations are cliched. The movie plays
more like one of those old "ABC Afterschool Specials" than a theatrical
release.</P>
<P> One basic problem is the movie is unsure to which audience its wants to
pander, the younger kids or teen-agers. So, it offers a goulash of both,
satisfying neither.</P>
<P> The best indicator of the reception this film will likely receive from
the under-10 set came from a little boy sitting a couple rows in front
of me at a preview screening.</P>
<P> He punctuated the theater with a loud `yuk' three times. Each
exclamation followed a kissing scene between two teen-age characters.</P>
<P> At just about 90 minutes, Snow Day moves at a brisk pace. But the story
is fragmented and is populated by types, not real people - or even real
kids.</P>
<P> There's the geek who has a crush on the popular, beautiful girl; his
best friend, a pretty, honest girl who has a crush on him; the stupid,
jock boyfriend; the younger, but wiser, sister; the fat friend who emits
a symphony of sounds; and the buffoonish school principal everyone
hates.</P>
<P> "Snow Day," a co-production between Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures,
is strictly by-the-numbers filmmaking.</P>
<P> And in a sense, the film, though meant to be slapstick and a bit of a
fantasy, is somewhat irresponsible. For example, a group of young kids -
elementary school age - want a second snow day. To get it, they kidnap
`Snowplow Man' (Chris Elliott in a comically disgusting turn) and
commandeer his snowplow. Showing youngsters driving around in heavy
machinery is not my idea of a smart move.</P>
<P> However, the kids are charming, and the film contains barely enough
action and gags to sustain it.</P>
<P> "Snow Day" is aimed at an audience the filmmakers condescendingly think
are too young to have an opinion. But three `yuks' should tell them
something.</P>
<P> Maybe they should have canned the romance and filmed more snowball
fights.</P>
