<P> Starring Bob Hoskins, Elaine Cassidy, Arsinée Khanjian. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>There are many superficial similarities between Atom Egoyan's flawed
but resonant new movie Felicia's Journey and his 1997 critical smash
The Sweet Hereafter, but the two films are fundamentally different.
Hereafter was a concept movie, dealing with the idea of grief after a
tragedy. Felicia's Journey is nothing of the sort. It's a character
movie, one that plunges into the deepest, darkest depths of human
nature. The main character is a serial killer and yet the killings are
never shown; the movie is not about them.</P>
<P>Young, naive, pregnant Felicia comes to Great Britain from Ireland in
search of her lover, who has reportedly gone away to serve in the army.
He promised Felicia he would write every day, but she has not heard a
word from him since he left. The only information she has came from a
friend of a friend, and that is that he works in a lawnmower factory.
She wonders around England's industrial midlands in search of
Wonderboy; she is instead taken in by Joseph Ambrose Hilditch (Bob
Hoskins), who obligingly assists her in her search but has dark
ulterior motives himself.</P>
<P>You see, Hilditch has murdered a number of young women. They were all
lonely young things, undergoing major crises. He preyed on their
emotions and when they tried to leave, he killed them. Hilditch himself
doesn't know he did it: he remembers the girls, but not the crimes. He
obsessively follows along with tapes of his classy mother's old cooking
shows, where he, as a child was the co-star -- whenever his mother
needed someone to humiliate.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Hilditch takes steps to make sure Felicia stays by his side
and she never suspects him for a moment. Felicia's Journey develops
into a suspense thriller that uses drastically untraditional methods to
generate that suspense: no quickening of the pace, no dramatic swells
of the soundtrack to indicate something exciting happening. The result
is, unfortunately, an effective drama but not much of a thriller. We're
involved, emotionally and viserally, but never particularly, um,
thrilled. Not that there's anything wrong with that.</P>
<P>One of Egoyan's more tangible fallacies here is the film's first 45
minutes. He limps out of the starting line with a deadly slow first
third, to the point where I had almost given up on the movie by the
time things got interesting. It's a well-known fact that non-mainstream
directors like to take their time, but isn't grabbing the audience's
attention immediately one of the first rules of filmmaking?</P>
<P>Fortunately, once things get interesting, they really get interesting.
The performances quickly develop into rich, deep characterizations and
the plot becomes intricate and involving. Egoyan is a craftsman, one of
the most effectively subtle directors in the business. His films take
on an eerie quality of a whole other level running beneath the main
storyline. We get glimpses of it once in a while, through character
revelations, script allusions, et al -- or we think we do -- but for
the most part it remains hidden from us. Of course, it may not even
exist, but in that case Egoyan's deliberate, mystical style is sure
good at making us imagine it.</P>
<P>The ending of Felicia's Journey is a tour de force. At that point,
everything becomes clear and you realize just how good everything that
preceded it was. It creates the temptation to go back and watch the
movie again (something I plan to do, since I have the video) to learn
more about Joseph Ambrose Hilditch.</P>
<P>I do wish the character of Felicia was more of a person than a concept.
She barely even has dialogue and, as a result, never fully becomes
human. Thus, we can't identify with her and the film's protagonist
becomes the serial killer himself, something that should turn off
audiences. It also makes the title kinda strange -- this is hardly
Felicia's journey. The movie ceases to be about her as soon as we see
Hilditch's first cooking scene.</P>
<P>I'm not as enthusiastic about this movie as I was about The Sweet
Hereafter because it's rougher around the edges. The film "wakes up" in
its last 20 minutes, but there is no reason why the whole movie
couldn't have been as rich and as complex as those final moments. But I
won't complain too much. Go see this one.</P>
