<P>"You can't have any of this. It's all mine!" 
--- A twisted priest (Charles Huevelman) hordes his tasty fried chicken
while Dana (Angela Zimmerly) looks on uninterested. </P>
<P>An evil presence, appropriately named The Presence (DJ Vivona), rules
over an alternate dimension where neither angels nor demons can touch
him.  For kicks, The Presence likes to trick a human into rounding up
five of his or her friends so they can all be sent to his dimension and
be systematically slaughtered.  When something goes wrong and one of The
Presence's recent victims escapes, the angels and demons are alerted to
his existence and feel he is a threat that needs to be stopped.  They
enlist the help of Alison (Ramona Midgett), a recent suicide victim, to
return to the flesh and follow the six new enlistees through the ice
wall that surrounds the the nether-realm.  </P>
<P>Her mission is to melt away the ice barrier and allow the angels and
demons access by reminding The Presence of who he once was, an ancient
court jester named Abraham who lost his job when his king and queen were
killed.  The king's sorcerer, Amblyn (who also lost his job), decided to
take Abraham under his wing as an apprentice.  During the downtime in
his unemployment, Amblyn decided to create a new dimension where
sorcery, evil, and torture ruled.  </P>
<P>Abraham wished to follow his master into this new realm, so he was asked
to show his devotion to the evil wizard by murdering his one true love. 
In this new realm, Amblyn would allow Abraham to pursue the sport of
hunting and destroying the humans that would be brought to this realm. 
After each murder, Abraham would become stronger, until his power
surpassed that of Amblyn's.  Because of the screw-up that allowed the
recent escape, Abraham was able to destroy his master and take control
of the realm himself.  As Alison quests to find Abraham and show him the
errors of his ways, the six new hapless humans are allowed to live out
their worst nightmares and then be brutally murdered.  </P>
<P>If there's one thing I can't stand when I see a film, it's when the film
is pretentious and arty just for the sake of being pretentious and
arty.  Films like Eraserhead and Begotten are two of the worst examples
of this, and now Ice from the Sun can be added to this list.  This film
is essentially an 80 minute stalk-and-slash film (following the Dante's
Inferno idea that your hell corresponds to how you lived your life or
any one of the plots to Nightmare on Elm Street 3 through 6) intercut
with almost 40 minutes of strange and (supposedly) haunting images, many
of which serve more to confuse than to further the plot.  If there
aren't bizarre images floating past the screen, then we get pointless
shots of a suicidal Alison staring at her breakfast for minutes at a
time or contemplating whether or not she should answer her phone. 
Compelling, but ultimately not. </P>
<P>The opening credits sequence is designed like a music video for some
unknown industrial band featuring various random images from the film
interspersed with other random images.  The credits run the entire
length of the song which is almost five minutes and the actual cast
listing and other credit information doesn't pop up until near the end
of the sequence.  When the opening credits began I thought my VCR had
accidentally cut off and a interstitial from MTV2 had found its way to
my TV.  At least the music in the film is pretty decent, made up of
mostly industrial and hard rock music and even features a song by Ramona
Midgett. </P>
<P>At the beginning of the film it is established that The Presence
possesses supernatural powers like shooting bullets out of the palms of
his hands and decapitating people by waving his hand in front of them
(and he talks like a Darth Vader clone without the heavy breathing). 
For some reason though, he delegates all of his main stalkings to what
seems like the supporting cast of Deliverance.  One over-alled cretin
handles The Presence's gravedigging and likes to chop peoples heads off
with his shovel, then there's an inbred father (Dwight Spurgin) and his
two inbred children (Mark Kettler and Jennifer Poirrier-Wallace) that
take care of a young woman who has been transformed into a half dog-half
human mix with a shotgun, and of course a big truck driving guy that
likes to tie people up naked to the back of his vehicle and drag them
across stone roads before pouring salt all over their wounds.  Why would
you want to give responsibilities to a bunch of "rednecks" when you
yourself had all of these cool powers? </P>
<P>And how is it that the fellow that screws over all of his buddies is
able to round up exactly five friends to complete the number of people
required to enter the realm at exactly the same time?  I can barely get
more than two together all at once at any given moment. </P>
<P>The most ridiculous segment though comes right before the aforementioned
dragging/salting sequence.  The character in question, Dana (Angela
Zimmely), has her turn up to be killed and is standing at the front of a
movie theater in which The Presence is seated.  A priest holding two
naked dirty humans on leashes walks in and sits down next to a large
platter of fried chicken.  He picks up the entire platter and starts to
enjoy the chicken, taunting Dana as she looks on with no interest
whatsoever.  When she starts to leave, the priest chides her for going
before the performance starts and then something that looks like a
either a creature from a GWAR show or a Terry Gilliam animation from
Monty Python come to life, walks out, and makes like it wants to be
crucified by her.  The Presence starts to clap annoyingly (which
continues for the rest of the sequence) until Dana takes off with the
strange creature following her.  When it finally catches up to her, she
stabs it in its giant eyeball and is covered in slimy glop that spurts
from the ruptured organ. </P>
<P>The box for the film claims "Because of the horrifying nature of the
motion picture, parental discretion is advised for persons under the age
of 18.  Contains nudity and graphic violence".  While both is certainly
true, there doesn't seem to be much of either in any large amounts. 
Besides a loving close up of a spurting neck stump, a semi-graphic
self-surgery scene, and two instances of head trauma (one run over and
one melting), most of the gore is just of the spraying blood or bloody
wound covered body variety.  As for nudity, it is very sparse, but at
least we get to see Angela Zimmerly (far and away the most attractive
cast member) before her body is bruised, torn, and bloodied by the
dragging incident.  </P>
<P>Ice from the Sun has been released on VHS by www.b-movie.com.  It has
been presented in in full-frame only and the transfer (for a film shot a
good deal in 8mm) is pretty decent.  Besides the decent soundtrack
(which is also available from www.b-movie.com), a making-of video is
also available called On Thin Ice.  I haven't had the opportunity to see
the documentary, but I actually would have been interested to see what
the set was like while all of the shots were being filmed, if only to
see how director Eric Stanze (director of a similar cult film called
Savage Harvest), conducted the atmosphere on set. </P>
