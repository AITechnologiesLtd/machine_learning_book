<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>Is there a story used more often in Hollywood films than the underdog who
makes good? I doubt it. We've seen it so often now that we know what
beats the film will hit even before it does. There's the optimistic 
opening, followed quickly by our hero getting a taste of sobering reality.
But our hero proceeds undeterred, slowly moving up in the world and
probably acquiring a love interest along the way. Then we hit the false
dawn, as everything seems to be going our hero's way when, suddenly,
everything goes wrong. Usually, this is linked to a complication in the
romantic subplot, and often to our hero misinterpreting an innocent
situation. Our hero spirals to his or her lowest ebb, about to give up
hope entirely. But then, out of the blue, there is a sudden source of
inspiration -- often a sacrifice or about-face by another character -- and
the hero gives it one last go. Everything ends in triumph -- and, of
course, a cuddly reunion with the love interest.</P>
<P>The underdog scenario is so familiar it almost feels like one of the
family. But so familiar, too, that it is difficult to get really worked up
about this kind of movie. Virtually every twist, every possible variation
has already been played out; the capacity for invention in the genre is
approaching nil. We cannot judge the movie on how creative it was, how
much it surprised us or affected us, because it is difficult to be
surprised or affected when you can guess where the film is going half an
hour ahead of time. Instead, the responsibility falls on the shoulders of
the filmmakers to take this timeworn concept and turn it into something,
if not novel, then at least entertaining.</P>
<P>The newest underdog movie is "Coyote Ugly", and the shoulders in question
belong mostly to Piper Perabo. Perabo plays Violet Sanford, an aspiring
songwriter who leaves her small hometown to go to New York City, where she
hopes to make a name for herself. What Violet doesn't realise is that she
can't just walk up to a record company and hand them her demo tape --
illogically, she needs to make a name for herself first. Unfortunately,
Violet has tremendous stage fright, and can't work up the courage to sing
her songs to a live audience. Meanwhile, she meets Kevin (Adam Garcia), a
charming Australian whom she mistakes for a club manager. Out of the
awkward meeting springs a budding romance, but one that is hamstrung by
Kevin's unwillingness to disclose his own secrets.</P>
<P>Violet gets a job working at a raucous bar called the Coyote Ugly, run by
tough-talking Lil (Maria Bello). At the Coyote Ugly, drinks are only
served straight and in shot glasses, and the bartenders are sexy women who
hop up on the bar to dance, spray the customers with water, and light
things on fire. Slowly, Violet begins to find a home at the Coyote Ugly,
but this brings her into conflict with both her father (John Goodman) and
Kevin, who thinks Violet is using her bartending job as an excuse not to
pursue her songwriting dreams.</P>
<P>What "Coyote Ugly" has going for it is a pair of charming performances
from Perabo and Garcia, who have a lot of screen appeal both together and
individually -- particularly remarkable since both are basically newcomers
to feature films. Perabo did a good job in a rather thankless role in
this summer's "The Adventures Of Rocky & Bullwinkle"; here she's on
somewhat surer ground. In some ways, Violet is rather unbelievable
character -- I found her complete naivete about the workings of the music
business hard to swallow, and I kept wondering why she didn't just go out
and find a singer to collaborate with (it's not like every songwriter has
a good voice, after all!). But Perabo manages to make Violet work; I look
forward to the day that she gets to sink her teeth into a more substantial
character. Garcia, for his part, demonstrates great comic timing and a
strong on-screen presence.</P>
<P>The script by Gina Wendkos -- another relative unknown -- has a number of
funny moments and nice little touches, like Kevin's comic book habit
("It's manly," he insists, while Violet counters that "it's sweet"). But
it also hews very closely to all the genre cliches, and at times
feels obscenely contrived. Plot developments jump out of nowhere for the
express purpose of manipulating our emotions, like a scene (never referred
to again) where Violet's apartment is broken into, and the emergency money
left her by a friend is stolen. Great movies slip such incidents
seamlessly into the flow of the film. That you can so easily see the
puppeteer's strings in "Coyote Ugly" is indicative of how much Wendkos and
first-time director David McNally still have to learn.</P>
<P>I was also disappointed that, given the movie's title, the Coyote Ugly bar
and its staff was used more as a backdrop than a pivotal element. The
bartenders, even Lil, are permitted very little development, which is
unfortunate because I got the impression that there were some good
characters and enjoyable performances lurking there, trying to break out.
It's unfortunate that more attention is instead paid to Goodman's
character, who is never much more than a convenient plot device. Although
Goodman is always fun to watch, he's pretty much cruising in neutral here,
playing his role like the first cousin of his Dan Conner character from
the sitcom "Roseanne".</P>
<P>"Coyote Ugly", then, is a fun, lightweight, but ultimately forgettable
entry into the summer roster. For the many neophytes who contributed to
it, it may well be looked back on in ten years' time as a good beginning
which paved the way to much better things.</P>
<P>If nothing else, viewers should keep an eye out for a cameo appearance by
Tara McLean, one of Canada's best but most underpromoted 
singer-songwriters, as an open mic night singer early in the film.</P>
