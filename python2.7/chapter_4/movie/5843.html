<P>     KANSAS CITY is Robert Altman's disappointing followup to the 
equally disappointing READY TO WEAR, which underwhelmed critics and 
audiences alike following its Christmas 1994 release.  While KANSAS CITY 
is a modest step forward for one of America's most-respected independent 
directors, it falls far short of the raw power of SHORT CUTS or the 
intricate, biting satire of THE PLAYER.  KANSAS CITY is a sadly ordinary 
motion picture, and, in less sure hands, it might have been something of 
an unfortunate mess.  Even with Altman at the helm, however, it manages 
to be singularly unremarkable.</P>
<P>     This hasn't been a very good summer for "respected" directors.  
Altman's KANSAS CITY comes in the wake of Bernardo Bertolucci's vapid 
STEALING BEAUTY and Jim Jarmusch's bizarre DEAD MAN, neither of which 
received more than a handful of positive reviews.  KANSAS CITY was given 
a lukewarm reception when it bowed at Cannes earlier this year, and, 
with almost no publicity accompanying its U.S. release, it appears 
destined for obscurity.</P>
<P>     Taking place over a forty-eight hour period around Election Day, 
1934, in Altman's hometown of Kansas City, the movie is carefully 
attentive of period details.  Sets, costumes, and props are all 
evocative of the time, when Kansas City was booming in the midst of the 
country's Great Depression.  The jazz soundtrack sizzles, with 
performances by the likes of Joshua Redman, Craig Handy, Cyrus Chestnut, 
Kevin Mahogany, James Carter, and Geri Allen.  Yet, although the movie 
gets the minutiae right, it stumbles over characterization and plot.  
Like an improperly-focused photograph, the background is crisp and 
clear, but the foreground is muddled.</P>
<P>     KANSAS CITY's main character is Blondie O'Hara, played by the 
normally-reliable Jennifer Jason Leigh with more than a dash of 
Katherine Hepburn and Jean Harlow.  This is the third time in her last 
five movies that Leigh has portrayed a tough-talking throwback to the 
thirties and forties (the other two being THE HUDSUCKER PROXY and MRS. 
PARKER AND THE VICIOUS CIRCLE).  Here, while Leigh's performance leaves 
a definite impression, it's also out-of-synch with everyone else's.  Her 
character, who is largely a two-dimensional caricature, never interacts 
effectively with anyone, least of all Miranda Richardson's Carolyn 
Stilton, in whose company she spends the entire movie.  </P>
<P>     When KANSAS CITY opens, Blondie's husband, Johnny (Dermot 
Mulroney), is involved in the robbery of a wealthy black businessman 
who's on his way to a night of big-money gambling at a jazz club run by 
gangster Seldom Seen (Harry Belafonte, recalling Marlon Brando's 
Godfather).  When Johnny's identity is uncovered, Seldom has him picked 
up, then holds him at the club while mulling over the most effective 
means of retribution.  Blondie pleads for Johnny's life, but to no 
avail.  So, desperate to save her husband, she kidnaps Carolyn Stilton, 
the wife of a prominent local politician, Henry Stilton (Michael 
Murphy), and demands that, in return for Carolyn's life, he use his 
influence to save Johnny.</P>
<P>     The secondary storyline features a 12-year old Charlie Parker 
(Albert J. Burnes), who, along with his mother, helps a 14-year old 
pregnant girl who has come to Kansas City to have her baby.  As usual in 
an Altman film, this narrative element eventually dovetails with the 
primary one.  There's also a side plot about the vote fraud perpetrated 
by Tom Pendergast's corrupt Democratic machine.  In the past, Altman has 
successfully used multi-story narratives with ensemble casts to great 
effect (NASHVILLE, SHORT CUTS), but not this time around. </P>
<P>     Done straight, with Altman's usual flair for intricate character 
development, there's a lot of potential in KANSAS CITY's basic plot.  
Inexplicably, however, Altman decided to do the movie with a satirical 
edge.  The film plays like part homage, part affectionate parody of old-
time noir thrillers.  The three main characters -- Blondie, Carolyn, and 
Seldom -- are intentionally developed as types rather than as fully-
fleshed out personalities.  There are numerous occasions when Altman 
obviously has his tongue planted in his cheek.  Unfortunately, that 
storytelling method doesn't really work in this setting.  KANSAS CITY 
has an uneven, confused tone.</P>
<P>     There's nothing uncertain about the jazz sequences, however.  
Altman has filmed them from a fan's perspective, and the scenes that 
take place in Seldom's Hey-Hey Club during an all-night cutting contest 
are infused with an energy that's lacking elsewhere.  Music aficionados, 
especially those who appreciate the tunes of KANSAS CITY's era, will 
find a great deal to appreciate about the film.  Others, especially 
those expecting something profound from an Altman feature, will discover 
that, though KANSAS CITY has its share of arresting moments, the 
production as a whole is too superficial to be considered amongst the 
director's best work.  </P>
