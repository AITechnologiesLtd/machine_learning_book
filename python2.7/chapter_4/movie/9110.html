<P>I know this is posted late, but I had to give my opinion on the movie
"Stargate."</P>
<P>I just finished watching the movie for the seventh time, and I must say,
that this is one of the most excellent movies I have ever seen!  I will
give a breakdown on all the individual aspects of the movie:</P>
<PRE>1)  The Plot:</PRE>
<P>It comes right out of a child's imagination.  Travelling through a
stargate to a planet at the other end of the universe.  Just seeing it
come alive relives many childhood deep thoughts.  Since it was a science
fiction movie, I can understand that most of it is unbelievable, but
that's where we can just lose ourselves in the movie!  Many dramatic
moments and edge of the seat moments all put together in a nice
package.  The egyptian element to the movie was very interesting and
made me want to learn more.</P>
<PRE>9.5 / 10</PRE>
<PRE>2)  The Locations:</PRE>
<P>Where did they film this?  I was awestruck with the beautiful sets and
props in this film.  Most of the budget on this film must have been used
in the sets!  I actually felt like I was in Egypt with the pyramids!  It
really did do the job by making me feel like I was in a totally
different world while watching the movie.  While the first half hour's
sets are mildly interesting, the rest of the movie's sets are
astonishing!</P>
<PRE>9 / 10</PRE>
<PRE>The Acting:</PRE>
<P>The acting was very well done.  I especially liked seeing foreign movie
actors playing the parts of the civilians.  Especially the actress who
played Sha'uari.  She was great considering she could have been talking
about laying bricks for all we know!  The english-speaking cast did a
great job as well.  Especially David Spader as Daniel Jackson.  Kudos to
Kurt Russel as well.  But It keeps coming back to the foreign actors.
They blew me away!  One actor I would have liked to have seen more was
Jaye Davidson as Ra.  I thought he had the most interesting part.  </P>
<PRE>9 / 10</PRE>
<PRE>The Music:</PRE>
<P>Once again, a soundtrack has inspired me so much as to buy it.  This is
one of the most incredible soundtracks that I own.  I have even placed
it higher the "Jurassic Park" and "The Lost World:  Jurassic Park."  The
music had a very ancient egyptian feel to it, and it made me want to
hear more of it.  I even stayed tuned for the ending credits because the
music just had to be heard again.  Good job, David Arnold.  </P>
<PRE>10 / 10</PRE>
<PRE>The Ending:  </PRE>
<P>The ending was very appropriate and It made me hope for a sequal, but
then Jaye Davidson's character couldn't be in it!  Oh well, it was nice
that Daniel stayed with Sha'uri and the rest of the civilians in the
desert on the other end of the known universe. . .  </P>
<PRE>8.5 / 10</PRE>
<P>This movie is a definite rental or even purchase.  It should be the
"Jurassic Park" of movie collections.</P>
<PRE>Overall Mark:
8.5
