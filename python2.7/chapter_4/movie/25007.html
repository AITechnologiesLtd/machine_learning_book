<P>What's the recipe for a great comedy film? Well, I guess there really isn't
one simple answer to that question, but slapping Jim Carrey, one of the top
comedic actors of our day, alongside the Farrelly brothers, one of the top
comedic writer/directors of our day, is a pretty good start, right? Well,
you'd think so. But after seeing the so-so trailer for this movie, I can't
say that I was very impressed. And now that I've seen the entire film, I
think I know why. It's just not that funny.</P>
<P>PLOT:
An emotionally challenged Rhode Island state trooper is suddenly altered
into two split personalities when all of his unresolved feelings break out
into an aggressive personality of their own. This disorder comes into major
play as he escorts a young lady out of state, and suddenly finds both of his
personalities fighting over her.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Jim Carrey's three black sons in this movie are hilarious, but the rest of
the film is bland at best, with a couple of laugh-out loud scenes, many flat
and obvious jokes, a lame story which goes nowhere, and Carrey seemingly
trying too hard to make us laugh. I can't really put my finger on the exact
thing which didn't work in this movie, but after the first 20 minutes or so,
I just sort of sat there and smirked sporadically. Most of the time, I was
annoyed by the lengthy musical interludes between scenes, the Zellweger
factor, which we'll get into later and the "forced" comedy, especially all
the gross jokes and the physical comedy by Carrey, which just didn't seem to
work for me this time around. Mind you, I did hear a lot of others in the
audience laughing, and God knows this is the kind of movie which someone
either "gets" or not, but with its lengthy run-time and a surprisingly
distracting character in Carrey as his second personality Hank, the film
just left me feeling sort of blah. Of course, many people thought KINGPIN
sucked, and I totally loved that film, so perhaps this movie might jiggle
your funny bones, but for me, the buck stopped here. I'd rather watch DUMB
AND DUMBER over this any day.</P>
<P>Now I don't know whether or not my disinterest in this film has to do with
me having reached my saturation level on gross-out jokes (although I highly
doubt it...I'm a pretty messed up guy), the fact that the movie actually
tried to focus more on the story than any previous Farrelly film, or the
fact that the leading lady, Renee Zellweger, was just plain ol' boring. But
whatever the reason, I can't honestly recommend that you see this movie in
the theatres, unless you did actually find the trailer somewhat amusing,
since most of the jokes run around that sort of gamut anyway. The corny
name-calling didn't really work for me, the rehashed "crazy" dude that they
pick up didn't really work for me, and Carrey's irritating Dirty Harry voice
didn't really work for me. The one thing that did really work for me was the
first third of the film (before Zellweger got in there), with its comforting
feel, funny jokes, and three black sons. Unfortunately, the rest of the film
lost that same feel inside an idiotic plot which I honestly didn't really
care about, and Carrey's physical gags, which just left me with a strong
sense of deja-vu. Mind you, I didn't hate the film by any means, in fact, I
was thinking about recommending it even slightly for the black son scenes
alone, but in the end, the film just sort of disappeared from my mind after
a couple of minutes, and it certainly can't be put in the same category as
any of the big hits from any of its prime participants.</P>
<P>In the end, there was something about this movie that just didn't work.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Several previous actors from Farrelly films are back in this one, including
Roy Munson's dad from KINGPIN, actor Danny Green, who plays the "bad guy" in
this film. Rob Moran (husband of TV's "Entertainment Tonight" reporter Erin
Moran), who played the rich, eccentric bowler in KINGPIN, and plays a local
trooper in this one. And Lin Shaye, who played the wonderfully ugly landlady
in KINGPIN and the old tanned woman in THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY.
Some sports stars also make cameo appearances in this film, including none
other than the sexy tennis star, Anna Kournikova, who has a line as the
motel manager. Retired hockey star Cam Neely also reprises his role as
Seabass in his one (although I didn't notice if he had any lines), and even
current hockey star Brendan Shanahan shows up as a trooper.</P>
