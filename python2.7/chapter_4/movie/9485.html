<PRE>ERASERHEAD (1974)
 A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Writer/Director: David Lynch
Starring: Jack Nance, Charlotte Stewart, Allen Joseph, Jeanne Bates,
Judith Anna Roberts, Laurel Near</P>
<P>I'm not the most intelligent person on the face of the earth, or
anywhere near to it, I admit.  Maybe that accounts for why when I don't
understand a movie, I don't immeadiately jump to the conclusion that
IT'S the one confused, or that it's just crap.  Or maybe I'm just a nice
guy or something.</P>
<P>But, anyway, David Lynch's first film, "Eraserhead," is a film combined
of scenes that individually make almost no sense the first billion
times.  And even entire parts of it (the whole spiel about the baby)
make almost no real sense, and may never.  But as a whole, this film
gives off mood, and perhaps even a message, which may be totally
different for each person.  While "Lost Highway" was ambiguous in that
annoying way, "Eraserhead" is ambiguous in that magnificent way.</P>
<P>Don't ask me what this film is really about.  There is no one sentence
that could describe this film.  As much as I can understand, it deals
with a very depressed man named Henry Spencer (played by the recently
deceased Jack Nance), who lives in what seems to be a post-apocalyptic
future of sorts.  During the tenure of the film, he's on vacation from
his stupid job (which we never see him do), and finds out that a woman
(Charlotte Stewart) he once (or several times) boinked has given birth
to a...something.  And it's his.  This is only the first 30 minutes of
the film.</P>
<P>Soon Henry is married to this girl, living in his crappy and
claustrophobic apartment with this...thing, which is like a monster
baby.  Shaped like a tiny dinosaur or something, and wrapped in a tight
cloth, it looks absolutely hideous, yet makes authentic baby sounds. 
After awhile, his new wife has left him with the baby, and we start to
see Henry go gradually insane, although we start to suspect that from
the first time we see him.</P>
<P>Henry Spencer is one of the most interesting of film characters.  Kind
of in between of sincere and bizarre, he almost willfully accepts taking
care of the baby when its mother up and leaves it, for no other reason
than it's making a lot of annoying noise (which it is).  And he is
equipped with hair that seems to stretch towards the sky, hinting that
he is reaching for heaven, and also that he might be in some kind of
personalized hell.</P>
<P>As I said, this film is highly ambiguous.  That is an understatement. 
Of all the films I've ever seen, this film is one of the top five (if
not the most) ambiguous films ever made.  Of course, the other four are
probably Lynch films too.  This flick gives us numerous unsettling
images, scenes, and characters, which we are to figure out on our own. 
Lynch is not up for spoon-feeding us what he thinks are his takes on
everything.  Watching this film is like negotiated viewing: he gives us
only partial information, and we are to make our own assumptions or
explanations for it.  This makes "Eraserhead" one of the more
interesting of films to watch.</P>
<P>So what is my take on it?  Well, I've only viewed it once, but what I
got out of it was that the film is about the inability to escape from
reality, which can be hellish or heavenly - it's all how you view
things.  Henry says he is on "vacation," but this seems to be a metaphor
for dreaming, explaining some of the more weird aspects of the film
(i.e. the baby), as well as why his fantasies are in this flick (like
his bizarrely erotic love scene with the sex-pot across the hall as they
fool around in a tub that seems to suck them in).  There is also a bit
about a girl inside a radiator who sings about heaven, but is in a
radiator, which seems to be hell.  At the end, he has grasped the girl
in the radiator, and has a big smile on his face, as he seems to be
enjoying life.  Or maybe I looked way too much into it.</P>
<P>Although I'm not a huge fan of Lynch (I didn't like "Blue Velvet,"
"Dune," and "The Lost Highway," and only saw a bit at the end of "The
Elephant Man," which I liked), I will agree that he is one of the most
intereseting directors.  And I actually loved "Eraserhead."  Granted,
it's not one of my all-time favorite movies, like "The Graduate" or
"Annie Hall," but it's a fantastically interesting film, which offers so
much to look into, and decipher for yourself.</P>
