<PRE>Movie Review: October Sky (1999)
A Review by: Ryan Davis
Rated `PG'</PRE>
<P>        A small town boy makes it big isn't exactly the most
original of ideas, far from it. Although there is something about the
story of seventeen year old Homer Hickman (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his
friends trying to get out of their small mining town, that is quite
charming.</P>
<P>        Inspired by the launch of the Sputnik and scientist,
Dr. Werner Von Braun, Homer and three of his friends decided to build
a rocket. They hope to be able to win their local science fair and be
able to go on to the national competition. At the nationals there are
many colleges handing out scholarships, which would be their only way
out of their town.</P>
<P>        With the help of several of the local townspeople and their
teacher, Miss Riley (Laura Dern), they start building rockets. After
lots of misfires, they start to learn more and more about
rocketry. Soon their rocket launches become well attended by the
townspeople and they are all very proud of the boys. All except
Homer's father, John Hickam, who is played skillfully by Chris
Cooper. John wants his son to follow his footsteps, in the coal mines,
but Homer wants nothing to do with it.</P>
<P>        `October Sky' is an inspiring film and an entertaining
one, even if its corny. The acting is kind of weak; most of the kids
are quite bland. The script is good and tight; there are very few slow
parts. But, altogether, it's a good film suitable for the whole
family.</P>
<PRE>Grade: B</PRE>
