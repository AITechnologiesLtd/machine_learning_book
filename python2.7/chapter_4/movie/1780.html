<PRE>IS THE BAD LIEUTENANT AN IMMORAL FILM???
WARNING!!! MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD </PRE>
<P>     In one of Charles Jackson's stories from the collection, "Earthly
Creatures," a suburbanite driving through the countryside with his wife
and two children hits a beautiful collie dog.  He cannot summon up the
courage to stop the car and inspect the dog, and so drives on.  This act
of cowardice becomes the pivotal incident which starts the collapse of
his marriage and personal life--the fulcrum for the transformation of
his world.</P>
<P>     Literature and film are replete with this motif:  the single
incident which signals the transformation of a person's existence.  In
Shakespeare's "Timon of Athens",one of the most cynical of the author's
works, it is when Timon realizes that his highly valued personal
friendships have been based entirely on his largesse, and when his
fortunes fail, his friends shun him.  "NOBODY KNOWS YOU WHEN YOU'RE DOWN
AND OUT...."</P>
<P>     In BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER KWAI it occurs when Alec Guiness suddenly
realizes that the bridge which, under his supervision, his troops built
with the cardinal British virtues of competence, and self-denial, will
be used to transport Japanese troops.  "My God, what have I done?"  </P>
<P>     Sometimes the transformation is triggered by a spiritual
experience.  The protagonist in I. B. Singer's novel THE MAGICIAN OF
LUBLIN, who has led a dissolute and cruel life, is touched by God.  He
seals himself into a small brick hut with a single window, through which
his meals are delivered, and ends his days there.  </P>
<P>     Sometimes the light of God blinds, rather than illuminates.  In
Pasolini's film THEOREMA the angel, played by Terrence Stamp, places the
seal of his sexual seduction on all members of a bourgeois family, and
they are destroyed by it--or at least their lives are transformed
unrecognizably.  </P>
<P>     The psychologist William James called this sort of life experience
"turning a corner within."  It is entirely personal.  Was the magician
touched by God?  Did the Bad Lieutenant actually see Christ?  James
insisted that what was important was not the viridical nature of the
experience itself, but its subsequent effect on the person's life.  He
argued that the "truth" of such experiences could never be decided.  </P>
<P>     Viewers sensitive to this motif will find the film, THE BAD
LIEUTENANT, a rich one.  The incident in the church, where the
lieutenant kisses the feet of Christ and looks up to see an elderly
black woman staring down in amazement at him, is one of the most
trenchant, moving, yet comical scenes in American film.  You thought you
beheld Christ, and see what he turned out to be!!  But the point is, the
vision serves to transform the lieutenant's world, enabling to make a
gesture of forgiveness--towards the two teenagers who had raped a
nun--of which he would have been incapable an hour before.  </P>
<P>     Those who have chosen to focus on the lieutenant's graphically
depicted vices and the squalor of his surroundings have, I think,
totally missed the point.  The Philadelphia Inquirer called the film
"confused."  Nonsense.  It is perfectly clear, as clear a treatise on
medieval scholasticism ( "Theorema" in Italian, see above.)  The
resolution of the film involves what many would call a uniquely
Christian concept: we qualify for forgiveness by extending forgiveness
to others.  In fact, the film is almost a Christian religious treatise.</P>
<P>     The film also utilizes humor brilliantly, a fact its detractors
seem not to have noticed.  The lieutenant's imprecations when Darrell
Strawberry strikes out in a penant game (YOU PIECE OF ****!!!  YOU
MISERABLE, SLIMY PIECE OF ****!!!)  and his firing his gun into the car
radio conveying the bad news, are funnier than nearly any incident in
memory in any Hollywood comedy.  No matter how wrecked any life is,
humor can be found in it.  Because humor is so great a part of what it
means to be a human being, even one in great distress.</P>
<P>     Harvey Keitel gives one of the great film performances: creative,
resourceful, convincing, free from actorish mannerism.   His acting in
the harrowing scene in which he sexually brutalizes two women has drawn
effusive praise from members of this group and the Compuserve film
discussion group.  In my many years of film viewing, I can think of
nothing that can compare with it.</P>
<P>     Harvey Keitel, by the way, was ignored by the Oscars nominators.</P>
