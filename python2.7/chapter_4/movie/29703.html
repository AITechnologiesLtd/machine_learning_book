<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A lighthearted comedy farce built around a crime caper, but is mostly built
around the star power of Paul Newman. The film misfires because of its weak
script, lack of punch to its comedy, and the plot was too incredible to believe
or become absorbed in. But if you're a fan of the 75-year-old sexy actor, Paul
Newman, it must be good to see that he still looks good, can turn on the charm,
and can still act with the best of them. </P>
<P>Henry Manning (Newman) is a bank robber felon who had a stroke in prison and
because they have no beds available arrives in a private-convalescent home in a
comatose state while strapped to a wheelchair. His caring nurse, in this rural
Oregon town, Carol (Fiorentino), is awed by his presence, but thinks he's faking
the stroke. She does a lap dance on him, which fails to arouse him; but this
doesn't stop a further attempt to uncover if he's faking the illness. After
getting permission to take Henry on a picnic with her unambitious husband Wayne
(Dermot), she throws him from the wheelchair into the water. Happy to learn that
the bank robber couldn't pull the wool over her eyes, the former high school
prom queen who married the prom king, decides that Henry, who faked his illness
so he could escape, will rob a bank with her and she could thereby get enough
bread to escape from this humdrum town. Wayne is jealous of Newman, who could
still attract a beautiful woman, but he reluctantly goes along with his wife's
idea to be a bank robber at the risk of losing her if he doesn't. </P>
<P>Newman plans to rob an armored car at the start of its route. The guards are not
as alert then because there's no money collected, yet. This gives Newman an
excuse to do some acting, as he goes to different business establishments to
collect the money. </P>
<P>The story itself is disappointing, but this is the kind of sexy and amoral role
that Fiorentino is very good at. She plays with her dense husband and with the
fascination she has for Newman, and the film has some light moments to recommend
it. It's somewhat pleasing and that could be enough to satisfy a certain type of
audience. But if you really want my opinion, I wouldn't go two steps out of my
way to see this one. </P>
