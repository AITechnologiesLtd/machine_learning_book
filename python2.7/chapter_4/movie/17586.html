<P>Like a paper dress or a Bobby Sherman 45, Neil Simon's "The Out of
Towners" is one of those relics of the early 1970s that hasn't
improved with age. Seen today, the Jack Lemmon/Sandy Dennis comedy
about an Ohio couple who suffer almost every conceivable humiliation
during their weekend in New York comes off as a grating one-note bore
that relies entirely on a perceived universal aversion toward NYC and
its residents for its humor.</P>
<P>At least the 1999 version of "The Out-of-Towners" (the original title
was not hypenated, but this one is; go figure) is canny enough to
acknowledgethat attitudes toward the Big Apple have changed
dramatically in the last 30 years.  "I only hated New York when it was
hip to hate New York," scoffs advertising exec Henry Clark (Steve
Martin) when his wife Nancy (Goldie Hawn) reminds him how much he
dislikes Gotham.</P>
<P>Lifelong Ohioans Henry and Nancy head east when he's offered an
interview at a prominent Manhattan agency. Their agenda is to fly into
the city, stay overnight, go to the meeting and return home. Of
course, if everything went according to the plan, there wouldn't be
much of a movie.</P>
<P>How much you enjoy this "Out-of-Towners" will have a lot to do with
how many times you can laugh at what amounts to a series of variations
on the same joke. The script by Marc Lawrence (based on Simon's
original) is essentially one minor catastrophe after another - flight
problems, car problems, hotel problems, cab problems, etc. - for Henry
and Nancy to muddle through. Some of these are funny, some are not,
almost all are utterly predictable.</P>
<P>The movie is funniest when it diverges from the woe-is-us concept to
allow Hawn and Martin a little comic breathing room. It's much more
amusing to see Hawn attempt to seduce an L.A. smoothie (Mark McKinney)
or to tell a guy she mistakes for Andrew Lloyd Webber how "Cats" "hit
so home for us" than it is to see her scurrying away from an attack
dog or creating unintentional havoc on a plane. Martin's best moments
come at the beginning and end of the picture, in an airport goodbye
scene with his son and in an amusing homage to Milos Forman's film of
"Hair."</P>
<P>Aside from John Cleese as a wonderfully starchy (at least in public)
hotel manager and a wonderful little joke about a sedan's faulty
navigational system, the rest of "The Out-of-Towners" is uninspired if
not unpleasant.  The picture would have had a bit more punch if
director Sam Weisman had any clues about staging slapstick
sequences. The physical comedy here is overblown and clumsy.</P>
<P>Nor does Weisman seem to have had much control over his extras. The
background people in this movie, particularly in the Logan Airport
scenes, often seem to be trying to steal the focus away from Martin
and Hawn.  The result is so distracting it's hard to believe nobody
called for a reshoot.</P>
