<PRE>Taye Diggs into another Wedding Cake
The Best Man</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>A late night card game with the guys would have been nothing short of movie
making perfection (great dialogue, direction, acting, energy) save for
Perrineau, though his character is lovable, he finds himself out-acted.
Also, "an oops" slips passed the directors careful eye: watch the card table
magically reset after it's been overturned. This scene is a microcosm of the
film itself: bouquet-catching actors, committed direction, toast-worthy
dialogue, but an occasionally crazy-chicken story line.</P>
<P>Here's the drama ... Taye flies to New York for the wedding of his
Pro-football playing best bud. The whole college gang is there with all
their past histories with which to build each other up or tear each other
down, and there are still a few secrets left untold. When the cat's finally
out of the bag ... who will end up with whom? Kind of a
"public-relationships" game of musical chairs.</P>
<P>Like "Seinfeld," Nothing really happens in this film. Even a scene in which
one character holds the other over the edge of a terrace seems out of place
and unnecessary. But the good solid humor and unforgettable acting power
keep "The Best Man" fun and ultimately entertaining.</P>
<P>Taye Diggs graced the screen mere months ago in another buddy/wedding film.
"The Wood" was rough around the edges (picture/sound-wise), but excellent on
script and performance. If you enjoy, "The Best Man" this weekend, let me
recommend "The Wood" as a fine renter.</P>
