<PRE>                             AMERICAN PSYCHO
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     From the opening scene, showing drops of blood on a pristine white
surface, we know we're in for... well, not your ordinary slasher flick.
Turns out the "blood" is a berry sauce being applied to a plate of haute
cuisine.  And the mind games of AMERICAN PSYCHO have only just begun.</P>
<P>     Steeped in controversy and mired in production for years, AMERICAN
PSYCHO tells the story of Anybroker Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), a
highest-society late 1980's Wall Street investment banker with a
penchant for murder and a bloodlust that doesn't quit.  Think of it as a
portrait of Gordon Gecko as a young man.</P>
<P>     With knives, axes, guns (bullet and nail), and/or chainsaw, Bateman
hacks up homeless people, hookers, and even a few of his friends,
especially if they talk nasty about him behind his back.  Between bouts
of rough sex, a rigorous shower and exercise routine, drinks and dinners
with friends and dates, and listening to his favorite music (Huey Lewis,
Phil Collins, and Whitney Houston), it's surprising that Bateman
actually has time to get to work.</P>
<P>     And murder's just not enough for Bateman.  He's engaged to Evelyn
(Reese Witherspoon) but is boning her sister (Samantha Mathis) and a
whole lot of whores, to boot.  Everyone but his assistant (Chloë
Sevigny) is getting a piece of the action.  Not that you'd want any,
because most everyone who visits Patrick's apartment ends up in the
fridge.</P>
<P>     AMERICAN PSYCHO has the tendency to be a character in search of a
plot, as was the case with the novel, but director Mary Harron has
infused Bret Easton Ellis's tale with so much twisted and neo-farcical
psychosis that she's really turned a rambling psychothriller novel
tinged with comedy into a ribald satire tinged with thrills.  The
murders in AMERICAN PSYCHO aren't particularly gruesome, it's the glee
with which Bateman carries them out that makes him a true villain.  Even
the novel's most gruesome killing (which I won't detail here, but which
involves a bound woman, a starving rat, and a Habitrail) has been cut
from the film.</P>
<P>     As for Bale, well, I think we've just witnessed the defining moment
of his career: the role for which he will forever be compared to.
(Think Leonardo DiCaprio (who was rumored to be taking this part at one
time) in TITANIC.)  He certainly plays Bateman to a T, even if the
dialogue he's been given is a bit flat.</P>
<P>     Harron has often described this film as a work of feminism.  I
don't know about that.  It's scattered and often random (like the novel)
and any female point of view was lost on me.  No matter.  AMERICAN
PSYCHO vibrates between being deliriously funny and just plain
delirious.  And for some reason, it made me really want to work on my
abs.</P>
