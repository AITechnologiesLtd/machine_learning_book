<PRE>                                 MIDNIGHT RUN
                       A film review by David N. Butterworth
            Copyright 1996 David N. Butterworth/The Summer Pennsylvanian</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Martin Brest
Rating: *** (Maltin scale, adjusted from **)</PRE>
<P>[Reviewers note: I originally saw this movie after a particularly bad
dining experience at a Chi-Chi's restaurant--over an hour wait for a nachos
appetizer!--and some of that frustration was reflected in this review.  I
have seen the movie twice since then and have developed more of an
appreciation for it.  db]</P>
<P>Hollywood has always been quick to cash in on popular trends in the movies.
One recurrent theme is the "buddy" picture, in which two mismatched
personalities collide, often with comic results.</P>
<P>The latest example is MIDNIGHT RUN in which, it appears the producers felt,
Robert De Niro's grittiness, coupled with the sensitivity of Charles
Grodin, would make for a winning combination.  Unfortunately, the film
misfires by not having enough faith in its own convictions.  Rather than
developing the obvious camaraderie between its two leads, it settles
instead for high speed action sequences and low brow theatrics.</P>
<P>Robert De Niro plays Jack Walsh, a disillusioned ex-Chicago cop turned
bounty hunter.  He is assigned by bail bondsman Eddie Moscone (Joe
Pantoliano, doing a good Martin Scorsese impersonation) to find and deliver
to Los Angeles an accountant named Jonathan Mardukas (Grodin).  If
Mardukas, worth a million dollars to Moscone, is returned before the 72
hour deadline expires, Walsh will earn $100,000.</P>
<P>Mardukas, also known as "The Duke", has embezzled $15 million from crime
boss Jimmy Serrano, a role played by TV's Dennis Farina (CRIME STORY).
Privy to incriminating evidence against Serrano, it is not suprising that
the FBI want to get their hands on Mardukas before the mob does.  As if
this isn't enough, Eddie contracts out another bounty hunter, Marvin
Dorfler (John Ashton), to complete the job, if and when Walsh fails.</P>
<P>Walsh develops an early animosity towards federal agent Alonzo Mosley,
played with a smoldering intensity by Yaphet Kotto.  After starting what
turns out to be a running gag concerning government issue sunglasses, Walsh
manages to steal Mosley's ID.</P>
<P>This makes apprehending Mardukas relatively easy.  However, delivering him
to L.A. is not as simple as Walsh had first thought.  Mardukas tells Walsh
that he is afraid to fly, as well as suffering from a string of phobias.
Walsh's response is that if he doesn't shut up, he'll end up suffering from
"fistophobia".  Such is the level of humor in this movie.</P>
<P>So they board a train, then a bus, and finally several cars and trucks, in
an attempt to out run their pursuers.  For all the modes of transportation
in this film, it could easily have been called PLANES, TRAINS AND
AUTOMOBILES, TOO!  In any event, all are led on a merry chase across
country as Walsh attempts to deliver the "merchandise" on time and collect
his one hundred grand.</P>
<P>As one would expect from a movie by the director of BEVERLY HILLS COP, an
obligatory car chase is thrown in for good measure.  A multitude of police
cars race across the Arizona desert, almost as an afterthought, and the
chase ends about as quickly as it began.</P>
<P>By the film's conclusion we are expected to believe that Walsh and Mardukas
have developed such mutual respect along the way that Walsh's integrity has
been renewed, causing him to renege on his contract.  It just doesn't hold
water.</P>
<P>It is good to see De Niro in a meatier role for a change, as opposed to his
recent larger-than-life walk-ons (notably as The Devil in Alan Parker's
ANGEL HEART and, more recently, as Al Capone in THE UNTOUCHABLES).  His
cheeky schoolboy grin certainly contribute to some of the film's lighter
moments.</P>
<P>Grodin, too, makes the most of his endearing qualities and at times the
chemistry between the two blossoms.  This pairing is especially effective
in the scenes in which Grodin acts as De Niro's conscience, endlessly
bugging him about his smoking and eating habits, asking him personal
questions about his private life, even talking him into visiting his
ex-wife and daughter after nine years of separation.</P>
<P>And the film does have its amusing moments.  For instance, when De Niro
shows his obvious lack of mathematical skills on the train and, later, when
Grodin mimics his captor in a box car.  And there's a scene in which
Pantoliano tells his right hand man that Walsh is bringing in "The Duke",
thereby saving his livelihood, to which the guy responds "This calls for a
celebration.... I'll get the donuts!"</P>
<P>But you have to wade through a quagmire of hackneyed and implausible
plotting in order to reach those moments, and it's too much like hard work.
Most of the laughs in this film are telegraphed way ahead of time.  Those
that are not predictable are either pretty lame or simply unfunny.  De Niro
and Grodin's subtlety is wasted in a film which would have better suited
the comedic talents of, say, Eddie Murphy.  In fact, this film bears more
than a passing resemblance to Murphy's 48 HOURS, yet it lacks that film's
wit and style.</P>
<P>Before boarding the plane for Los Angeles, Walsh tells Mardukas "If you
don't be quiet, this will be the worst trip of your life."  This journey
proves to be no pleasure cruise for the audience, either.</P>
