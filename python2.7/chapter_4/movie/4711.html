<PRE>                             CUTTHROAT ISLAND
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>        In the "good old days" we had Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and
Senior and later Errol Flynn.  They did the swashbuckling, the
fencing, the leaping from balconies.  We are now in the mid-nineties
and Renny Harlin is directing CUTTHROAT ISLAND with his wife, Geena
Davis as the prancing, leaping, fencing lead in the film.  In
addition to the above, a new bit has been added which, to put it
politely could be called "kick them in groin."   And Geena does just
that at least 20 times, with her feet or with her knees and the men
fall like, well, flies.</P>
<P>        Geena is aided by Matthew Modine while Frank Langella plays
her uncle, the villain.  All in vain.  The story is as old as
movie making with a bit of RLS' Treasure Island thrown in.    There
is a map that tells of buried treasure but, sad to relate, Morgan
(Geena Davis) only has part of the map.   And, what's more, it's in
Latin.  Luckily, at a slave auction of prisoners, Morgan spots
William Shaw (Modine) handsome and educated, so she buys him.  That
is not all; his education includes the ability to read Latin.</P>
<P>        Dawg (Langella), with shaven head and constant snarl, has
the other part of the map, so we are in for some great battle
scenes as "hand to hand" the frigates fire cannon at each other
while everyone leaps and waves swords (and do not forget the
"kneeing".)  When the battle is over, Morgan has a slight smudge on
one cheek but her clothes look newly laundered.   And so on.</P>
<P>        I almost forgot to mention that this great story took 4
persons to write (Michael Frost Beckner & James Gorman and Bruce
A Evans & Raynold Gideon.)  Screenplay by Robert King and Marc Norman.</P>
