<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>In his first movie after his serious motor scooter accident in 1995,
Takeshi Kitano (Boiling Point/Sonatine), has made a film about two
troubled teenagers that he has great affection for even though they are
considered to be morons and failures in their rural high school by the
teaching staff and the other kids. Their teachers think they will only
end up being petty criminals. Masaru (Ken Kaneko) and Shinji (Masanobu
Ando) are close school friends, who go truant together, play practical
jokes on their classmates and teachers, set a teacher's car on fire,
ride their bikes noisily around the playground while class is in
session, bully the other students, shake them down for protection money
and mug them for loose change. These two seem destined for a wasted
life, as they are shown in contrast to the other students in their class
who are at least trying to prepare themselves for a career.</P>
<P>Two other students are shown who hope to make it as stand-up comedians,
while one very delicate boy gets a job with a sales firm, but yearns for
more freedom and more money, so he becomes a taxi driver. He will become
disillusioned with that job also.</P>
<P>The two delinquents spend their schooldays hanging around a teahouse and
drinking beer at a noodle restaurant, using the money they collected
from their classmates to pay the tab. A group of the victims are fed up
with this and pool their money together to hire a young boxer thug to
take care of the bullies. Masaru is the bigger and more aggressive of
the two, and attempts to stand up to the boxer, but gets knocked down
repeatedly. This prompts Masaru to join a boxing club with his shy
friend, as he is willing to train and learn how to box to get even. In
the noodle restaurant, they meet a yakuza gang and befriend the leader
and get in good with him, though the leader's flunkies hate these two
kids. The kids are impressed with how cool the yakuza boss is and treat
him with the utmost respect.</P>
<P>In the gym, the surprise comes when Shinji gets into a sparring fight
with his friend and thoroughly beats him. The two decide to follow
different paths, as Shinji hopes to become a pro boxing champ while
Masaru quits the boxing club in humiliation and joins the local yakuza
gang. He hopes to become a yakuza boss.</P>
<P>Just when you think both of them will rise to the top, as they both have
the needed skills to make it in their chosen fields, they both goof up
and fail to succeed. Though Kitano has strong feelings for them,
probably reminded through them of his own unsteady youth, he
nevertheless doesn't let them off the hook, showing their many faults
and blemishes, and their immaturity and lack of discipline that is
needed to succeed. But he ends the film on a vague note, showing that
the kids return together from their adversity and strive to begin anew,
realizing that nothing has changed for them. Kitano is only an observer
of their behavior and offers no opinion on what motivates them to be the
way they are.</P>
<P>This is one of the better boxing/troubled teenager movies I have seen,
very much in the style of those old Warner Brothers Bogie films. There
is a freshness and a spark in it that is very easy to feel. These were
characters placed in situations where they are still so young, that
their current downfall does not necessarily mean curtains for them.</P>
<P>Kitano continues to make offbeat films that are packed with a wallop. He
must be considered by now as one of the better auteur directors
operating today. This film has his same intense rhythms and visuals as
his other great gangster films, but it is less violently graphic. The
director is so confidant of what he is doing that the character of
Shinji shines  ever so strongly, despite long periods of him remaining
quiet.</P>
<P>Kitano's unique gift is in his understanding of the troubled youths and
in his humorous presentation of them, one that is given with a gently
bemused but forgiving look at how the teens do such stupid things as
kids. But he also shows how serious the consequences of screwing up
their youth can be. For him, this screwing up means not knowing in what
direction they should be heading and by failing to be self-disciplined.
He also manages to show that the serious students attending class didn't
seem to be faring any better, as they are also trying somehow to find
themselves in the straight path they have chosen. A most interesting and
perceptive film.</P>
