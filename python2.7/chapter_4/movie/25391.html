<PRE>More Stalk than Action
Chuck and Buck</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Excellent Dialogue, editing and a superb performance by writer/lead actor
Mike White. But the story is only decent, the telling is quite slow and
linear, subject matter potentially off-putting and the quality of the image
on the big screen - sorely lacking.</P>
<P>Essentially this is the story of a grown up boy who is still in love with
his childhood playmate (by now a grown up man). It's been years since
they've seen each other, but the passing of Chuck's mom brings them
together. Very nicely directed, the funeral scene captures the delicate
interplay of contradictory emotions. Buck is more excited to see his old pal
than he is dismayed at his mother's passing. Chuck, on the other hand,
trying to act appropriately for the occasion, isn't sure how to react to
Chuck's jubilant smile.</P>
<P>Throughout the film, Buck remains resiliently pre-teen. He's bright-eyed,
hopeful, playful, and broodingly obsessive. His every word is that of an
11-year-old. His every eyebrow raise and smile curl is that of a game loving
pubescent. He's remarkable, absolutely rock solid.</P>
<P>And if this film was just about one man's undying grip on childhood memories
and his attempts to once again bring them into reality with his reluctant
old buddy - then I'd have been more interested, really. But when that grip
becomes a grope, it's all too apparent that Buck's interests aren't entirely
innocent.</P>
<P>Most of the film is Buck stalking Chuck. There are no independent side
stories and we, as an audience, spend most of our time across the street
from Chuck's house or workplace, pseudo-sympathizing with the stunted
maturity of Buck.</P>
<P>Then there's the technical: This movie is shot on videotape then transferred
to film. The casual viewer will most likely notice that it's not as crisp or
clean or rich as film, or that it's often grainy especially in low light.
But I found the stair-step edges and color bleeding plainly distracting.
Tape is much cheaper than film, however this production is so professionally
handled from story to acting, I'm left wondering why they just didn't shoot
it on film.</P>
<P>Some pictures actually work on videotape, "The Celebration" (a European
flick) shot on tape makes sense since it revolves around a family event,
we'd expect it to be captured on tape. In fact, video brings a hyperrealism
to it. But "Chuck and Buck" displayed no artistic reason for the choice.</P>
