<P>     Tarsem is a successful director of music videos who has added the 
gravitas of a last name, Singh, for his first foray into feature films.  
You'd think "Singh" would work for the musical stuff, and could be 
dropped when he went tuneless (unless you count Howard Shore's 
cacophonous score.)  But I digress...</P>
<P>     His attitude toward movies seems to be that it doesn't matter what 
you say or do as long as it looks good.  And at times it looks very 
good.  The opening, with Jennifer Lopez swathed in brilliant white 
pacing the knife-edged tops of dramatically shadowed desert dunes, is 
the pure distilled essence of an expensive commercial.  She is at the 
time prowling the subconscious of a small boy (more on this later), and 
we can only assume that this is a small boy who will grow up to be a 
fashion photographer - these are not images that dominate the 
subconscious of your typical prepubescent male.</P>
<P>     All right, here's the deal - she's a psychologist working in an 
experimental scientific program that allows her, suspended in midair in 
a form-fitting corrugated body suit alongside her patient, to enter the 
kid's subconscious and find out what's gone wrong in there.  The science 
is reminiscent of '50s sci-fi potboilers.  Things aren't so bad in the 
little boy's brain, but they take a turn for the worse when FBI agent 
Novak (Vince Vaughn) finds out about this program and recruits her to 
take a side trip into the brain of a comatose serial killer (Vincent 
D'Onofrio), who has a victim stashed somewhere and there's no time to 
lose!</P>
<P>     Singh cares little enough about dialogue that he allows 
screenwriter Mark Protosevich lines like "If we can't stop him, he ain't 
gonna stop himself," and to be on the safe side he imports plot and 
style elements from movies as diverse as "Silence of the Lambs", 
"Altered States", and the animated "Fantastic Planet".  He has stocked 
his cast with middle-echelon stars, and seems not to have wasted much 
time directing them, with the result that Lopez spends most of her time 
trying to look sympathetic and concerned, Vaughn looks worried and a 
little lost, and D'Onofrio just looks crazy.  Ultimately, Singh is 
banking everything on his slick visuals, and while sometimes he nails 
it, as often as not it gets away from him.  A recurring image of 
Jennifer Lopez as the Virgin Mary is one that could be charitably 
forgotten.</P>
<P>     If you like shots of kidnapped young women being systematically 
drowned in a plexiglass cell, screaming "Daddy!  Mommy!  Help!" as the 
water level rises, you'll be treated to them randomly throughout the 
movie.  If you're fond of disemboweling and vivisection, look no 
further.  If you're a fan of crisp story, character, and credibility, 
hang in there.  Something's bound to turn up soon.</P>
