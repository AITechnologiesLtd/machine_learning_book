<P>There are films that just stand out, and if it isn't because it is well
written, then it is because an actor just takes over, and delivers what is
undoubtedly one of the most deserving Oscar performances around.</P>
<P>Scent of a Woman, is a simple film, nothing complicated about it at all, and
the story is very easy to tell.  A college boy, Charles (Chris O'Donnell) in
a private institution in the east ( Boston ) gets in trouble with a few of
his friends, for which his future is at stake.  Since it  happens just prior
to the Thanksgiving holidays, there isn't much that  the school can do to
discipline anyone until the following Monday.  In  the meantime, he gets
himself a part time job to help take care of his financial needs for the
holidays.  And that job is to take care of a retired, and blind, career army
man ( played by Al Pacino ).  And what looked like an easy job turns into a
weekend in New York, where the real  story about the Colonel is unfolding.
He wants to have one more fling,  and then end his life.</P>
<P>The Colonel is alone, his own family doesn't like him, or his surprise
visit, and he is not known for being Mr.. congeniality, either.  But Charlie
is a well mannered kid, and his way eventually affects the aging Colonel.</P>
<P>Upon returning to the school on Monday, Charles is facing expulsion and a
ruined future because of his honesty, and integrity.  And in appears the
surrogate father who delivers the young man from the claws of defeat. And
the school's discipline committee takes a harmless stand, so not to hurt
anyone, which is the speech that delivers the young man from the claw of the
over eager administrator with revenge on his mind.</P>
<P>A magnificent film, really nicely done, well executed in almost every phase,
and it stimulates the feelings of the viewer, because we can not let go of
the character or the story.  The aging Colonel still has an eye for women,
and can smell them a mile away, and teases the younger Charlie about them.</P>
<P>There are many films that one should see on a large screen and this one is
one of them, but unlike them, this one is stronger, even if seen at home, on
the video ( as I just did ), where one's emotional edges are allowed to run
freely.... and this film is at least one of those that  requires a pause...
and then run back to it....</P>
<PRE>Great film in every respect.</PRE>
