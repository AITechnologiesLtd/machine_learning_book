<P>    The title character of "Mighty Joe Young," who could serve
as a model for a Rogaine commercial, is handsomer than the
Frankenstein monster and is anthropomorphically a more
sympathetic individual than Godzilla.  With his deep set,
expressive brown eyes and tendency to communicate his
feelings with them in much way a human being can, Joe is a
gorilla that the small fry can care about.  It should not be at
all surprising that the kids in the audience would scream
when poachers threaten to put down the 2,000 pound simian
or when the L.A.P.D., in the touchstone standoff with
creatures far larger than they, take careful aim with their rifles
awaiting the order from the chief to blast off.  An update of
Ernest B. Schoedsack's 1949 movie , which starred Terry
Moore, Ben Johnson and Robert Armstrong--which in turn
updated the "King Kong" theme and had comparable special
effects--"Mighty Joe Young" suffers from the same agonizing
dialogue and repetitive actions.  Each time Joe is about to
bounce off walls, crush cars, and down the Ferris wheel, he
is brought to heel by the soothing voice of the woman who
reared him from the time she was 12, after both her mom
and Joe's were killed by poachers.  Since these counseling
sessions occur quite often in the story--in a Los Angeles
amusement part, in a metal cage zooming down the
California freeways, inside a California conservatory and in
the Botswana bush--the recapitulation can become annoying. 
But since Joe's stepmom, Jill (Charlize Theron) is the most
beautiful actress that Hollywood now boasts--even better
looking than the stepmom who has eyes for Ed Harris--you
don't mind the redundancies too much.</P>
<P>   A thoroughly predictable fable that uses convincing
computer graphics and other special effects to portray the
title figure, "Mighty Joe Young" opens in Botswana where Dr.
Ruth Young (Linda Purl), a Dian Fossey type who is studying
gorilla protocol while caring for her 12-year-old daughter Jill
(Mika Boorem), is killed while trying to protect her hirsute
buddies from the unlawful activities of poachers.  Having
evoked a promise from her daughter to carry on the work,
she leaves Jill to tend to the clan, and, twelve years later, the
24-year-old woman (Charlize Theron) realizes that she can
no longer protect her large monkeys from the illegal activities
of the hunters.  Convinced by eccentric researcher Greg
O'Hara (Bill Paxton) to transport Joe to a California
conservatory, she allows Joe to be captured and travels with
him and Greg to the states.  While in the conservatory, Joe is
confronted by poachers Strasser (Rade Sherbedgia) and his
accomplice Garth (Peter Firth), the former seeking revenge
for losing his thumb to Joe's attack twelve years earlier. 
Provoked by his old enemy, Joe Young escapes and creates
havoc in Hollywood, alternately hiding from helicopters and
seeking out a child to save from a collapsing Ferris Wheel.</P>
<P>   Bill Paxton is just boyish enough to appeal to the young
ones in the audience and while he does not get a chance to
act maturely as he did so well in "A Simple Plan," he is just
right for the part of a guy who plants the first human kiss on
Jill's lips.  We even root for him win Jill's affections in the
triangular romance plot but at the same time hope that Joe
does not get overly jealous that his role is about to be taken
over by a human.  Director Ron Underwood may have
forgone the wit that allowed him to make "Tremors" more
than a silly story of worm-like predators in the desert out for
Kevin Bacon's hide.  But while there are many reasons to be
depressed during the holiday season, "Mighty Joe Young" is
not one of them.</P>
