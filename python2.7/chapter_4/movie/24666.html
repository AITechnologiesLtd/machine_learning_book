<P>The question that you must ask yourself before stepping into the theatre to
see this movie is, "what do I really want to get out of this film?". If the
answer to that question is that you want to encounter well-rounded
characters involved in an intriguing plot about the trials and tribulations
of college life, well...chances are, this film ain't exactly what you're
looking for. If, on the other hand, you're looking for sex jokes, fart
jokes, people making fun of one another, titties flashing around here and
there, and Tom Green actually putting a live mouse into his mouth...chunk
down the change and get ready to laugh your big ass off! This movie is funny
shite!</P>
<P>PLOT:
Some dude in college accidentally mails a videotape of himself dicking
another girl to his girlfriend in Texas. Upon this realization, the boy
heads out on a road trip, with buddies in tow, in order to retrieve the tape
before his long-life girlfriend does.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Many funny moments, many gross moments, many flashes of breasts and sexual
situations, and many a good tune qualify this movie as the first big comedy
hit of the summer. I think it's been said in other places before, but allow
me to re-iterate the obvious. If you liked AMERICAN PIE last summer, and if
you laughed at THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY the summer previous, this film
is more than likely to churn your humorous butter. The characters are having
a lot of fun, the movie is poking a lot of fun, and by golly, we as an
audience, are supposed to take it all as "fun", and not much else. And
unlike other "safer" teen flicks of yesteryear, this movie doesn't hide
behind the forbidden glass door either. It shows these folks having sex,
cheating on their mates, smoking the good weed, drinking the good drink, and
ultimately just living the high life of their college years. And my-oh-my,
whose idea was it to put T&A back into "teen" flicks? Whoever it was, allow
me to shake your hand, cause a fan I was not of those "pretend" movies which
brought everyone to the brink of the sexual situations, only to pull the rug
right out from under us at the last possible moment.</P>
<P>Giving the ladies a bit of the Tom Green ass was also a good idea. Spread
the perversion, Hollywood, women want to see some of that, too! Speaking of
Green, that was the one thing which did kind of disappoint me about this
movie. NOT that he wasn't funny, no-no, not at all. In fact, he was one of
the funnier characters in the film, only that he's barely in the 95-minute
hummer! You see, he doesn't actually join his friends on the road trip, so
we only get to see him from time to time, which was sort of disappointing,
since he really does have a huge presence. All this to say that if you're
looking for a very funny, mindless, sexist and most likely every other -ist
type of film, this one is sure to fit your bill. It's funny as heck, it's
got a great, hip soundtrack and it moves along at a quickity-quick pace. So
wipe that smile onto your face, wash your balls, get your mind into the
gutter, and prepare to enjoy watching a bunch of goofballs getting into all
kinds of trouble. And oh yeah...there's also a moral to the story...if
you're gonna cheat on your partner...try not to send them the actual
videotape of the event!</P>
<P>PS: Any movie that includes Twisted Sister's classic anthem "I Wanna Rock",
is allright in my book.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Actor Seann William Scott played a similar role in last year's AMERICAN PIE,
and also had a decent part in the underrated thriller from earlier this
year, FINAL DESTINATION. He was also featured in Aerosmith's "A Hole in My
Soul" video, and set out on a 1-month road trip of his own to Australia,
after completing this picture.
And who can forget Breckin Meyer's performance in last year's awesome GO, as
the character of Tiny. And if you don't remember him in that flick, you may
remember his Spicolli-esque skateboarder performance in 1995's CLUELESS, or
his days on the TV show "Wonder Years", his first big break. His first movie
role was in 1991's FREDDY'S DEAD: THE FINAL NIGHTMARE.
DJ Qualls got the part of Kyle after auditioning for a one-line part at the
film's Atlanta casting office (where most of this film was shot). The
director invited him to meet executive producer Ivan Reitman, and poof...he
was cast! In addition to his professional accomplishments, DJ is also a
cancer survivor, and an advocate for cancer research and awareness.
This film marks director Todd Phillips' first major studio release. He
previously directed the smaller films HATED and the controversial FRAT
HOUSE.
Actress Amy Smart shows her boobies in this movie.</P>
