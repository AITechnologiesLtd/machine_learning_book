<P>"Wild Reeds" directed by Andre Techine, was the best film of 1995, and 
one of, if not my favorite, foreign-language film I have seen.</P>
<P>This beautifully made French film is set in 1962, and revolves around 
four teenagers. At the center of the story is Francois (Gael Morel), a 
rather shy, introverted young man who is staying at a boarding school. 
When a new student, Serge (Stephane Rideau), who is a much more 
rebellious person, comes to stay at the school, they become friends, and 
to Francois' shock, finds Serge in his bed late one night. After this 
encounter, Serge strays farther away from him, and it is apparent that 
he is not interested in a relationship, but he leaves Francois utterly 
confused about his own sexuality. Also a large part of the story is 
Maite (Elodie Bouchez), Francois' long-time female best friend, who 
obviously has deep feeling for him, and the oldest student at the 
boarding school, Henri (Frederic Gorny), who is about to turn 21, and 
has purposefully failed each year because he is afraid to face the "real 
world." </P>
<P>Something I have noticed lately is that the characters in American films 
almost always act like immature children, and in most foreign films, the 
characters are infinitely more intelligent and interesting people. "Wild 
Reeds" proves this point to a T, even though these characters are still 
in high school. This motion picture is full of such truth and honesty, 
that it is in another league with most films that are made nowadays. </P>
<P>Regardless of what the film is about, it is not a "gay" film, and the 
film is far too complex for it to be labeled such a thing. Instead, it 
is about the uncertainties and insecurities of growing up, and the 
picture understands and cares about the characters so much that the 
audience can't help but do the same thing. Also, all of the characters 
are written to be fully-developed, living-and breathing human beings, 
and they are helped even more by the amazingly mature performances from 
its cast, particularly Morel and Bouchez, who have a large future in 
films. Incidentally, Bouchez was awarded the Best Actress prize at this 
year's Cannes Film Festival for a yet-to-be-released French film. There 
are moments within the film that involves these characters that are full 
of such unblinking reality and intelligence that there is no way it 
could be a "mainstream" American picture.</P>
<P>Another highlight of "Wild Reeds" is its music, which is filled with 
several 60's hits, such as "Barbara Anne" and "Runaway." Although this 
may, at first, sound a bit strange, since this film is in subtitles, it 
only adds to the realism since in France in the 1960's American pop 
songs were no doubt popular, and they fit perfectly into the story.</P>
<P>The conclusion of "Wild Reeds" is splendid, as it brings together all of 
these characters and story threads, and all of the predicaments are 
dealt with. And yet...very little is solved, except that, I sense, the 
characters have grown quite a bit as people and have learned about 
themselves. In this sense, it is just like real life, because not 
everything is always resolved and wrapped up within two hours. Instead, 
"Wild Reeds" leaves you thinking and pondering about what lies ahead for 
these four people, even after the end credits. Judging from the film 
itself, their lives will not be a bed of roses, but they will make it 
through everything quite alright, I'm sure. </P>
