<PRE>                              PRIVATE PARTS
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>Right up front I have to admit that before attending a screening of
PRIVATE PARTS, the only thing I knew about Howard Stern was based on
the occasional articles I had read in the Los Angeles Times.   None of
it was flattering.   I was, therefore, expecting to see an outrageously
disgusting display by this top-rated  radio talk-show host.  In that, I
was not disappointed; he is disgusting and he is outrageous.</P>
<P>However, to my surprise, I found him a warm person, a devoted husband
and a loving father.  In addition, he is in no way stupid.
College-educated  in Communications, he seems to have learned more than
many who are currently executives in radio and TV.</P>
<P>Howard's goal was to stop being hired and fired by every radio station
all over the country.   He wanted to be number one, have a secure job,
and do things his way.   He then surrounded himself with some wonderful
people, notably Robin Quivers, elevating her from just reading the
weather reports to engaging in exchanges with Howard.  How the
executives railed against that!  How they screamed that they were
losing advertising clients.   All of this, of course, until the ratings
started coming in and they realized they had a gold mine.   So, if
Howard Stern is disgusting, what can one say of those who hired him,
wanted to fire him, but succumbed to the ratings?  Who has fewer decent
values?</P>
<P>The "utterly without redeeming qualities" of many of his gags are,
pitifully, funny but I am not about to enumerate them.   My
understanding is that the director and Stern both did not want to
soft-pedal any of what really has taken place on some of his shows, so
we get to see a few choice ones.   Even as we gag, we laugh.   Some are
so infantile, it speaks volumes about the public that adores him.
One executive explained that of those who listen to his programs, there
are those who love him and want to know what next outrageous thing he
is going to say or do.  For those who watch but hate him, they do it
because they want to know what next outrageous thing he is going to say
or do. So there you have the reason for his large audience, as well as
the sales of his book, PRIVATE PARTS.</P>
<P>Mention must be made of the cast, many of whom are real-life people
from his show as well as others who make this a very funny movie:   In
addition to Howard and Robin, there are Mary McCormack who plays his
wife; Fred Norris who plays himself as he has been on Stern's show as
engineer for some 18 years;  Jack Martling, the show's real head
writer; Gary Dell'Abate, the producer of Howard's show . . . and a
dozen others who contribute to the film, including some stunning
nudes.</P>
<P>So, if you are squeamish, perhaps you ought to stay away.  But if you
are able, as I was, to enjoy the spectacle of Howard Stern putting
everyone on . . . and I have no doubt but that is exactly what he is
doing, . .  I suggest you catch PRIVATE PARTS and get yourself a good
laugh while learning about the phenomenon that is Howard Stern.</P>
