<PRE>                               INTERSECTION
                       A film review by Jon A. Webb
                        Copyright 1994 Jon A. Webb</PRE>
<P>     Sometimes it's possible to imagine the "pitch" for a movie (as was
depicted in THE PLAYER) after seeing it.  But with INTERSECTION I
can only imagine the first half. "Okay, you've got Richard Gere, Lolita
Davidovich, and Sharon Stone.  Gere can't decide between them."  "All
right, what happens?"  "Uh...."</P>
<P>     Basically, there's no plot in this film.  Gere can't decide
between Stone and Davidovich (I guess this is the kind of choice we're
all expected to be able to sympathize with) and, well....</P>
<P>     Coupled to this is the problem that Gere seems (as usual) unable
to act, and Davidovich seems poorly directed.  Stone actually
demonstrates her serious aspirations by actually portraying a
character, and Martin Landau has a scene or two in which he
demonstrates that his career revival started by CRIMES AND
MISDEMEANORS was justified.  But that's about it.</P>
<P>     The movie is filmed in the Pacific Northwest, in and around
Vancouver, and the scenery looks great.  Gere also looks good, though
his tan doesn't quite fit in with the idea that he's a hardworking
architect in that rainy region.  Perhaps he has a home tanning booth.</P>
<P>     The girl who portrays Gere's daughter is quite appealing.  I don't
know what it is, but she really seems to steal scenes.  Of course,
that's not saying a great deal, considering she's stealing them from
Gere, but she exhibits a great deal more talent than one would expect
from someone of her age in as limp a film as this.  Perhaps she got
some pointers from Stone.</P>
<P>     If you like to see Gere, Stone, and Davidovich, you could look
through old "Vanity Fair"s, or you could go see this film.  Your choice.
One word of warning: don't go if you're looking for a peek or two under
Sharon Stone's garments, because she stays pretty much covered up
here.  She's supposed to be sexually repressed.  Davidovich presents
the lusty contrast.  As I say, Gere has a hard time making up his
mind.</P>
