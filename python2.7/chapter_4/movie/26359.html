<P>If you're familiar with the name Shakespeare, the premise of Solomon and
Gaenor shouldn't come as much of a surprise.  It's got the whole doomed
romance equation (young man + young woman x secret love = tragedy), but
Gaenor is much more than a Romeo and Juliet rip-off.  It was nominated
for a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar earlier this year, and it's
probably the first picture to have dialogue in Yiddish, Celtic and
English.</P>
<P>Abandoning Verona for 1911 Wales, Gaenor begins by introducing each of
the victims in the forthcoming romance.  Solomon (Ioan Gruffudd, from
the upcoming 102 Dalmatians) is an Orthodox Jew whose family hails from
Russia.  They run a successful pawnshop, where Solomon keeps the books
and hits the town's streets with a pack full of fabric samples to woo
potential customers to the family store.</P>
<P>Along with her mom, Gaenor (Nia Roberts, in her acting debut) is
essentially a servant to her hard-working father and brother.  Both
burly men work at the coal mine, where Gaenor lost her boyfriend in an
explosion.  Like most of the inhabitants of this impoverished town, her
Gentile family spends most of their time either at church or thinking
about the next time they'll get to go to church.</P>
<P>When Gaenor opens the door to Solomon and his fabric, you can
practically see the sparks fly.  Utterly smitten, Solomon makes her a
lovely dress out of one particular material that Gaenor admired during
their first meeting.  When he goes back to present her with the dress,
the film almost captures an audible swoon coming from Gaenor, who
finally succumbs to her secret attraction to Solomon.</P>
<P>The kicker is that Solomon never lets on that he's a Jew.  In fact, he
covers it up, pretending to be an Englishman named Sam Livingstone in
order to pry Gaenor away from her overprotective family.  Gaenor's
parents seem pretty happy with `Sam,' but her big brother becomes
suspicious when he notices that Solomon's hands aren't covered in
calluses</P>
<P>The star-crossed lovers literally roll around in the hay but, like any
guy who's just gotten some, Solomon turns into a jealous, post-coital
jerk.  Gaenor expects him to marry her, but he knows matrimony would be
impossible if she learned the truth about his religion.  And before you
know it, Gaenor is blowing chunks during the morning chores.</P>
<P>If you have the slightest familiarity with storytelling, you know Gaenor
is headed somewhere dark and tragic.  First-time writer/director Paul
Morrisson keeps things even gloomier by setting the film in rainy,
overcast weather.  There's also a devastating scene where the pregnant
Gaenor is booted out of church after she's accused of having pre-marital
sex.  It was almost enough to make me want to start going to church
again.</P>
<P>1:39 – R for nudity, strong sexual content, violence, and a pig
slaughter</P>
