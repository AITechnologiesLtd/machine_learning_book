RATING: 5/10</PRE>

<P>PLOT:
A strange old man comes to live in a small town with secrets from the past. He
befriends a young boy whose mom is extremely selfish, and offers him advice on
love, life and girls. But where does this man come from? What's with all the
mystery? Does this movie have any real point? Find out below...</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A movie which obviously means well, but doesn't really provide the needed
"oomph" to back up its mysterious build-up. Not the kind of movie that you
should watch when you're sleepy, that's fer sure (unless you wanna fall asleep,
of course). It moves at a slow pace, gives you hints of stuff here and there,
clues behind some of its vagueness but ultimately very little to sustain its
well-established ominous potential. You wait, you wait, you wait...and watch
Anthony Hopkins and Anton Yelchin develop an interesting relationship
throughout, watch as exquisite shots of nostalgia and youth pass before your
eyes, but there's always something telling you that there's gotta be more behind
all of this, a hint of spirituality, a lining of depth, a greater love or
something, but ultimately...well, it just never comes. The ending is too
"ho-hum" and doesn't give you anything more than what it is, which is basically
just a...coming-of-age story? I hoped that this movie would hit me emotionally,
hoped that it would have me wondering aloud, hoped that I might recognize
something in it, which I had never seen in any other movie before, but this film
just didn't provide any of that.</P>
<P>Basically, it was a disappointment. Sure, some of its elements were spot-on.
Hopkins was rock solid as the mystery man, the little boy was perfect and
delivered the goods in both his happy and sad moments, as did Mika Boorem as
Carol, his "girlfriend" in the day. The cinematography and the innocence of the
time were also captured idealistically and damn, if that wasn't one of the
grooviest soundtracks of the year (very Sinatra-esque). But the bottom line with
most films is their story and this one just didn't deliver. It also featured a
very one-dimensional mother character, whom we try to understand, but are given
no reasons to appreciate in any way. We also get an explanation as to Hopkins'
character at some point in the film, but when all is said and done, it doesn't
really seem to be that relevant to the picture as a whole. I mean, whether or
not he is what he is, has little to do with the major drive of the film, so why
build so much into it in the first place? I don't know, I guess what I'm saying
is that I don't think the director did a good job of balancing the different
elements here, and had my focus going one way, when really the film wasn't so
much about that, then it was something else (I'm trying not to spoil anything
here, so bear with my babbling). </P>
<P>Of course, I'm more than willing to admit that perhaps I didn't "get" the
undertones in this movie, or that there was some kind of "deeper meaning" behind
it all, but the bottom line with the film is that it just didn't bring anything
new to the table, especially when placed against much greater and comparable
films like STAND BY ME (which was also based on a Stephen King story). Then
again, I didn't care for THE GREEN MILE either, and most folks seemed to like
that, so being in the same vein as that flick, you might want to check this one
out just the same, if you enjoyed the latter. Overall, this film provides for
solid acting, a fun soundtrack and wonderful atmosphere, but very little of
resonance or freshness.</P>
<P>And what the heck does HEARTS IN ATLANTIS mean, you might be asking? Well, other
than the fact that it reminds me of that mediocre Disney flick from this summer,
it's apparently something to do with youth and love, but I challenge you to
decipher that one when the film is done. It's a game in itself. </P>
<P>Where's JoBlo coming from?
The Dead Zone (8/10) - The Gift (7/10) - The Green Mile (4/10) - Meet Joe Black
(6/10) - Shawshank Redemption (9/10) - The Sixth Sense (8/10) - Stand by Me
(8/10) - Unbreakable (9/10)</P>
