<PRE>"The Art of War"</PRE>
<P>The slumbering giant, China, is about to enter into a major trade agreement with
the west, led by the United States, when a freighter is discovered in New York
Harbor with a grisly cargo of dead Chinese refugees. Negotiations are further
strained when Chinese Ambassador Wu (James Hong) is assassinated while giving a
speech to a large, media-saturated gathering of diplomats at the UN. Special
United Nations agent, Neil Shaw (Wesley Snipes), is framed for the murder and he
goes on the lam to clear his own name and uncover what may be a conspiracy of
massive proportions in "The Art of War."</P>
<P>Director Christian Duguay ("Screamers") leads a talented cast and crew in what
starts off as a pretty slick actioner for the first hour. After that, the story
degenerates into a routine thriller where the good guy not only has to save the
day, he has to do so while being betrayed by his own people. The film starts out
interesting enough with a massive Millennium celebration in the heart of Hong
Kong. Neil Shaw, the covert spook for UN Secretary General Douglas Thomas
(Donald Sutherland), performs a high tech information theft under the noses of
the North Korean security officers. He then blackmails their finance minister
and makes a daring escape jumping from a skyscraper with a parachute. All of
this is slickly done with shoot-outs, kung fu and lots of eye-popping action.</P>
<P>Things move along pretty well with the set up and execution (forgive the pun) of
the assassination of the ambassador (an under-utilized Hong), then the fast
moving action as Shaw chases the real killer through a maze of obstacles only to
get himself arrested for the murder. FBI boss Frank Capella smells a rat over
the arrest, but Shaw is hijacked away by the henchman for the conspiracy to stop
the historic trade agreement from happening. Shaw makes a daring escape from his
captors, kicking butt and taking names in the process. Then things grind to a
halt.</P>
<P>Pretty UN interpreter Julia Fang (Marie Matiko) is brought into the mix as the
beautiful innocent bystander who is drawn unwillingly into the nefarious plot.
She, of course, provides Shaw with invaluable assistance - after all she is an
interpreter - while he saves her time and time again from the bad guys. We've
been there many times before, but, this time, there isn't even any romantic or
sexual innuendo between Shaw and Julia, until the tacked on epilogue where they
live happily ever after together. There is no chemistry between Snipes and
Matiko and this does serious injury to the film.</P>
<P>The rest of the mumbo jumbo of the second half of the movie is plagued with the
proliferation of bad guys. In the first half, mysterious and ruthless Chinese
businessman Chan (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, "Rising Sun") is painted as the
puppet-master pulling the strings of the conspirators from behind the scenes.
When he is abruptly killed by Shaw, the focus of the film changes as a larger,
more secretive conspiracy looms and Shaw learns that his partner Bly (Michael
Biehn) and boss Eleanor Hooks (Anne Archer), supposedly his friends, are really
his enemies. The jingoistic explanation - basically, America-For-Americans and
Say-No-To-China - as to why these highly trained, intelligent people would
behave the way they do is so trite and simple-minded, I just shook my head.</P>
<P>Screenwriters Wayne Beach and first-timer Simon Davis Barry have cobbled
together a mishmash of a story that starts off OK, but goes downhill when the
rapid-paced action stops and the "character development" begins. Unfortunately,
where Wesley Snipes excels is as the smart-ass, wisecracking action good guy who
puts his life on the line for God and country. He does that here in "The Art of
War" but his character lacks any of the mirth that makes the actor so likable.
His Neil Shaw is a stoic good guy who is betrayed and must get his justice done,
but there is no passion in the character or the performance.</P>
<P>There is a big supporting cast playing around in this celluloid sandbox, but
none, with the notable exception of the great Maury Chaykin, has much to do.
Chaykin, whom I first saw and respected in Atom Egoyan's 1991 Canadian film "The
Adjuster," has always had my admiration as a fine character actor who is capable
of humor and drama. As Frank Capella, he brings to life the sketchy character,
making the savvy FBI agent a sympathetic character (you're shocked when he is
gunned down, point blank, and breathe a sigh of relief when he pulls off his
bulletproof vest) and, ultimately, the one who believes in Shaw. The rest of the
cast - Donald Sutherland, Anne Archer, Michael Biehn, Marie Matiko, and
Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa - goes through the motions dictated by the lame script,
collecting a paycheck along the way.</P>
<P>Technically, things are of high quality and give the film a good crisp look with
lots of nighttime photography (by Montreal-based Pierre Gill), garish,
bright-colored sets and flashy action choreography, none of which help to save
this disappointment. I like Snipes and enjoy his films like "Passenger 57." As
for "The Art of War"? It should surrender. I give it a C-.</P>
