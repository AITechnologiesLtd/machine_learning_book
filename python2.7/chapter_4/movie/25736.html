<P>Prancing about onstage like some giggling, underdeveloped girl, Mick
Jagger can barely control his audience with an ineffectual plea:
"Brothers, sisters - we don't want this. We all want to have a good
time. So let's settle down now or…or…or we just won't play anymore."
While the Rolling Stones preen onstage and Jagger fiddles with his
endless mane of bangs, the leather biker boys who comprise the Hell's
Angels control the 300,000 hippies in the audience clamoring for
attention and Jagger's skinny bod.</P>
<P>This concert footage is intercut with scenes of the Rolling Stones'
lawyer, bespectacled fussbudget Melvin Belli, as he organizes their free
concert in California. The locals seem wary of bringing the Rolling
Stones to town, along with all those crazy fans: Someone's sure to get
hurt. We also catch glimpses of the obviously whacked out Stones on a
press junket, oblivious to the manic fans who fervently gather around
them.</P>
<P>Welcome to 1969, four months after Woodstock. The Stones are joined by
Jefferson Airplane in a free concert at Altamont Speedway. On the long,
bleak day, the crowd gathers in hot anticipation, some stripping
themselves naked and running through the crowd while others booze and
smoke up.</P>
<P>It's the end of the '60s, man, and what an ending! During the
performance, the lead singer of Jefferson Airplane is knocked out by an
angry biker, the crowd is drubbed with pool sticks and chains, and a
lone gunman who has Jagger in his sights is cut down by the knife of a
Hell's Angel. It's the tragic tale of Altamont, where a member of the
Stones' ad hoc security team stabbed a gun-toting fan to death. History
has been made, once again, with blood.</P>
<P>Gimme Shelter, filmed by the Maysles Brothers, is a time capsule of the
violent climate in 1969, shot over the course of ten days during the
Rolling Stones tour. The handheld camera moves around, capturing poorly
lit, washed out images of dejected youth, bummed out rock stars and a
wild performance. It isn't pretty, all ragged zooms and
catch-as-catch-can shots which move from one definitive late '60s image
to another - tight bellbottoms and long waves of hair, kissing couples
and peace signs, and travelers with all their worldly possessions in
their sacks traveling through the good old USA.</P>
<P>Mick Jagger really isn't much of a live performer, overly concerned with
his appearance, forcing eccentric ad-libs. However, the crowd adores
Mick's fervent energy. Women leap on stage to wrap themselves around
him. Oddly enough, it'd all be just a fun (and forgettable) road movie
leading up to an aggressive and hip "alternative to Woodstock" were it
not for the shots of the Rolling Stones sitting around the editing
console watching the aftermath and inevitability of the Altamont
tragedy.</P>
<P>When the murder occurs, Jagger rewinds the editing machine and watches
it again in grim slow motion, his face reflecting -- what? Relief that
he wasn't gunned down in cold blood? A thudding moment of realization
that the '60s have gone out with a brutal bang? Whatever it is, the
Maysles Brothers are sensible enough to linger on his face while
watching the footage, and the grim visages of his Rolling Stones
companions, particularly the cartoon-faced Charlie Watts as he smokes a
cigarette, eyes filled with emptiness.</P>
<P>The movie lacks focus and feels rough and tumble, hastily thrown
together and forcing its "death of the '60s" theme by rushing through
the murder finale. They really don't have much footage of its aftermath,
except the Stones' dejected faces in the editing room and the hippies
leaving the concert. That's the marvel of creatively editing around
something the filmmakers hadn't anticipated - using the metaphor of
death.</P>
<P>However, there's no denying that as a sign of its times, Gimme Shelter
is an indispensable document with uses the popular rock ballads of the
Rolling Stones as the pulse for the cheerfully drugged young people and
the hostile antics of the bikers, captured en masse on that fatal day by
the filmmakers. Songs like "Under My Thumb," "Satisfaction" and,
especially, "Sympathy for the Devil" become more than pop and fizz,
existing onscreen as cultural milestones and commentary on those
watching (and, indeed, those performing).</P>
<P>The best place to end this review lies in describing the quiet
melancholy of a single unbroken shot. The Rolling Stones listen to the
playback of their slow, dreamy "Wild Horses." They smoke, fiddle with
their boots, and sit staring at the walls of the recording studio as the
song carries on. Though this happens several days before Altamont, it
works as an eerie prediction that something great is coming -- great and
terrible and strange, and the Rolling Stones will have no choice but to
hurry up and wait.</P>
<P>Scenes like this play out as if Gimme Shelter were a thriller, and the
Altamont killing is the ticking time bomb which drives the story
forward. It's a movie which merits the attention of a re-release,
whether viewed as a history lesson in American culture or as an exercise
in slow mounting dread. Mick Jagger never knew what hit him.</P>
