                       A film review by Vincent Merlaud
                        Copyright 1997 Vincent Merlaud</PRE>
<PRE>France (1996), 117 min, 1:1.85</PRE>
<P>directed by Andre Techine, written by Pascal Bonitzer and AT
with Catherine Deneuve, Daniel Auteuil, Laurence Cote, Didier Bezace,
Benoit Magimel, Fabienne Babe and Ivan Desny.</P>
<P>Back in 1994 the worldwide triumph of the autobiographical Les Roseaux
Sauvages (Wild Reeds) kept Andre Techine busy collecting awards, delaying
the production of his next feature, originally to be entitled L'Enfant De
La Nuit.</P>
<P>To make a long story short: a Lyons police lieutenant (DA) investigates
the murder of his crime-organizer--brother, which happens to be connected
to large-scale car thieves; in the process, he ends up having an affair
with his deceased brother's girlfriend, who herself sleeps with her
philosophy teacher (CD, definitely a woman). The story is told within
flash-backs, using different off-voices, which should please every admirer
of the cinema of Mankiewicz and Scorsese.</P>
<P>As usual, Techine deals with his favorite themes: fraternal hatred,
brother-sister relationships, rituals of provincial life, the opposition
of town and mountain. But this time the director leaves his beloved
Southwest -- the action taking place in the Lyons neighborhood --,
abandoning for a while his early story-telling technique, builds his most
complex and fascinating story yet, which however includes traditional
aspects of film noir and melodrama. The climax consists in a highly
efficient depiction of car-theft gone awry, which most of those currently
directing in Hollywood would do well to study.</P>
<P>The events portrayed in this film sometimes seem to be a mixture of
ancient tragedies, along with transsexual brotherly fights, seen with
psychological distanciation. Yet this is Techine's most vital film, thanks
to a magnificient cast. For many years now, the present reviewer has been
claiming that Daniel Auteuil is the best French actor of his generation,
and no one will deny the performance he delivers here is outstanding.
Working in harsh conditions -- "We close down at 6PM. After that it's Fort
Apache here." -- his character, the detective, has graphic sex with his
brother's girlfriend. I don't know many movie stars with the guts to shoot
a frontal sodomy scene; Auteuil's acting here is Actors' Studio worth. The
relative newcomer Laurence Cote, formerly known by Rivette fans only, is
also remarkable, tied between her sex affairs with both Deneuve and
Auteuil, and her love for her brother. Her bath scene with Deneuve has to
be included in every lesbian film anthology. And in a supporting part,
Deneuve gives her most human performance in years, which reminded me of
the character of Madame Juve in Truffaut's La Femme d'a Cote. To all
Deneuve fans: she's extravagantly breathtaking in Ruisz's forthcoming
Genealogies d'un Crime.
I'll be expecting Techine's next picture, which he currently shoots with
oscar-winner Juliette Binoche.</P>
<P>>From 1 to 10 on the scale of Techine's deconstructed eastside dramas: 8
