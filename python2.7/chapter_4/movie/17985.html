<P>"At First Sight" (1999) - Val Kilmer, Mira Sorvino...</P>
<P>        Is there a better way to say "I love you" than by undergoing
experimental surgery?</P>
<P>"At First Sight," with Val Kilmer and Mira Sorvino, strives to
answer this question. Along the way, it delivers a moving romantic drama
that can soften any heart. </P>
<P>Kilmer plays a blind massage therapist working at a resort spa in
northern New York. Sorvino is an overworked, stressed-out architect from
the Big Apple. When her co-workers convince her to take a few days off,
she ends up at that very spa. They swap stories over Shiatsu massage,
eventually falling for each other. </P>
<P>Eventually, Kilmer moves to New York City with Sorvino, to go
under the knife (or, in this case, the laser) in an experimental procedure
to restore his sight. As he learns to cope with this new sense, "At First
Sight" gets more insightful too. Watching Kilmer adjust, the audience is
pulled along for both drama (a hockey fan, Kilmer sees his first Rangers
game) and some dark humor (Kilmer almost gets hit by a cab after standing
in the middle of the road, watching it close in, fascinated by its
changing perspective).</P>
<P>"At First Sight" is an emotional roller-coaster: it goes up
(Kilmer and Sorvino fall in love), and down (Kilmer's over-protective
sister, played by Kelly McGillis, berates Sorvino for giving him "false"
hope), and back up (Kilmer can see, but he's not sure if he wants to). It
even picks up passengers along the way, such as Nathan Lane as an offbeat
visual therapist (to help Kilmer's eyes adjust to complex stimuli, they go
to a strip club).</P>
<P>Kilmer shows off his acting talents more than he has in a while;
in contrast to some of his earlier, goofier roles ("Willow," "Batman
Forever"), his portrayal of Virgil shows true depth. Sorvino has a similar
career epiphany, playing cute and charming consistently, but believably.</P>
<P>Even the visual effects are well-done. The camera tricks used to
show things through Kilmer's eyes are technically simple, but in the
context of the story are entirely appropriate. They help the viewer not
only in seeing as he sees, but also to understand his perspective on the
world and to identify with his character.</P>
<P>The romance is done splendidly, without being too sappy, and makes
for a funny, charming movie. It also challenges the traditional belief
that blindness is a handicap, showing that the real problem can be trying
to "fix" it. The message isn't heavy-handed, and actually makes "At First
Sight" a rich movie experience that's well worth seeing. </P>
