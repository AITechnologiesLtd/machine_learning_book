CAT PEOPLE (1982)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>Whenever someone mentions "1980s" and "horror film" in the
same sentence, the first association is usually FRIDAY 13TH,
NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET or myriad of similar low-budget
"teenage slasher" films inspired by their respective
successes. But, in the beginning of decade, horror films
didn't exclusively belong to the world of B-cinema. At least
some of them had high budgets and ambitious directors at
their helm. One of such examples is CAT PEOPLE, 1982 horror
by Paul Schrader, film that enjoyed quite popularity at the
beginning of the decade only to completely vanish from
moviegoer's memory in few years. That same fate was
experienced by many great 1980s hits, but rarely was so
unjustified like in the case of this film. The only
explanation could be found in critics' snobbery. CAT PEOPLE
was remake of classic 1942 B-horror, and, as such, it simply
had to be inferior piece of work. Also, large quantities of
violence, gore, sex and nudity didn't help either - many
critics viewed Schrader's film as exploitative.</P>
<P>Plot of this movie begins when 21-year old Irena Gallier
(played by Nastassja Kinski), who spent most of her life in
orphanages and foster homes, arrives to New Orleans to
finally reunite with her older brother Paul (played by
Malcolm McDowell), who works as priest. Irena is so thrilled
to find long lost family that she doesn't care about few
bizarre and mysterious details of Paul's lifestyle,
including long periods he spends outside home. During one of
such periods Irena visits local ZOO and becomes obsessed
with one of its exhibits - magnificent black panther. The
animal was brought in the cage after attack on prostitute.
Oliver Yates (played by John Heard), zookeeper who had
caught the beast is still puzzled by many unexplained
circumstances of the bizarre incident, as well as the origin
of the panther. His attention, however, shifts towards
beautiful young woman who spends all her time in front of
panther's cage. He falls in love with Irena, who, although
still a virgin, returns his feelings. When Paul returns
home, he would show not only unusually high degree of
insight into Irena's romantic life, but also his own
unnatural jealousy. This revelation is just one of many
shocking discoveries and events that would turn Irena's life
into ultimate nightmare.</P>
<P>Many people who criticise Schrader for using too much sex
and nudity in his version of CAT PEOPLE probably didn't pay
attention to movie's tagline "An Erotic Fantasy For The
Animal In Us All". While Tourner in his 1942 version had to
rely on small budget and only hint things, Schrader was able
to enjoy benefits of big budget, like location shooting or
special effects by Albert Whitlock, as well as liberal
censorship standards of pre-AIDS era that allowed more
explicit erotica in mainstream Hollywood. All that enabled
Schrader to use 40-year old original in order to explore one
of the most common motives in various forms of art -
connection between Eros and Tanathos. This motive, which was
exploited as one of the most boring cliches of "teenage
slasher" genre (which was, among many things, parodied in
Craven's SCREAM), was brought to its purest and most logical
incarnation in CAT PEOPLE. Unlike the killings of horny
teenagers in cheap 1980s horrors, committed by sexless,
passionless and machine-like monstrosities who are there to
please puritanical desires of the audience, homicidal
violence in CAT PEOPLE comes from the same source as sex
itself - dark depths of our collective unconsciousness - and
it is equally irrational and primordial in its nature, and
the killers are even more motivated by carnal desires than
the victims. Connection between sex and violence is even
underlined with the imagery that twists around all movie
cliches - in most of the other films, nakedness of the
characters symbolises their vulnerability; in CAT PEOPLE
nakedness symbolises their "natural state", in which they
are more prone to indulge into their irrational and
homicidal instincts and thus become even more dangerous than
with their clothes on.</P>
<P>Schrader's ambitions in this film were matched by his talent
as a director. CAT PEOPLE is much slower than most of the
other horror films, but Schrader uses this great length to
slowly yet methodically build characters and atmosphere. All
the scenes in this film possess certain eerie quality - from
the mythical, primordial past depicted in the prologue to
the exotic architecture of New Orleans. Camera of John
Bailey builds such atmosphere together with the a very good
musical score by Giorgio Moroder, which was very popular in
early 1980s, same as David Bowie's title song. However, the
screenplay by Alan Ormsby is somewhat disappointing - many
lines of dialogue are weak, and characterisation is
incomplete, especially in the end.</P>
<P>However, the acting is superb, although most of the leading
talents hardly managed to repeat the same success in the
decades to come. Young Nastassja Kinski, whose career in
next two decades would be tragic example of missed
opportunities, simply shines in her first major Hollywood
role. This role could be rather thankless, because most of
the viewers (especially males) would pay more attention to
her willingness to expose her body in front of camera, than
her actual acting abilities. But those abilities are there
nevertheless, and Nastassja Kinski is great in her portrayal
of young woman, torn between virginity and carnal desires,
between her need of normalcy and frightening dark forces
within her unconsciousness. Her partner, John Heard, who
would become of the most reliable Hollywood supporting
actors in 1980s and 1990s, is more than good in one of his
rare leading roles. But the greatest of them all is Annette
O'Toole, whose character of Yates' colleague and former
girlfriend Alice allowed both her and Schrader to play with
genre conventions - in the beginning, while she establishes
her relationship with Irena, she plays the part of sexually
active and "experienced" Bad Girl vs. young, innocent Irena;
in the end, the tables are turned and Alice is next-door
type who is symbol of good and normalcy against Irena as
Evil Seductress. Unfortunately, Malcolm McDowell, who plays
potentially most interesting part of Irena's troubled
brother fell victim to typecasting, and his Paul is almost
indistinguishable from psychotic villains he had played in
million other films.</P>
<P>All in all, despite its shortcomings, CAT PEOPLE is film
that hardly deserved its slide into relative obscurity. This
is very good piece of filmmaking and one of the rare
examples of "erotic thriller" which gives good name to that
ill-reputed genre.</P>
