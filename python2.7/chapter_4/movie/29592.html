<PRE>IRON MONKEY
A film review by Joshua Tyler
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>The American action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of
Asian wire-fu copycats.  It's not a pretty death, and it's leaving the
likes of Schwartznager, Stallone, and Van Damme wearing cement galoshes
at the bottom of a kung fu sea.</P>
<P>Sometimes, the mix results in a mind-blowing spectacle unlike any
other.  Quality action with amazing and exciting stunt work, as in
1999's The Matrix, can be a real gem.  But too often Hollywood gets it
wrong, even when they pay off Chinese directors.  Flying ninjas and
floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring Bronx detectives
and slow motion kicking scientists.  Mostly it's laughable.  In
Hollywood's rush to emulate the success of The Matrix, trademark Asian
stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form.  But Iron
Monkey, the latest Asian import, shows us how to get it right.</P>
<P>Iron Monkey (actually a reissue of a 1993 film) is the story of a 19th
Chinese vigilante (Rongguang Yu), fighting with his own unique style of
Shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed and the bellies of the
hungry.  But it is also a piece of the narrative of legendary Chinese
film hero Wong Fei-Hong, most recently seen in one of the most
overlooked, and possibly best films of 2000, Drunken Master 2 (released
in the U.S. as The Legend of Drunken Master).  Unlike Drunken Master 2,
which stars Jackie Chan as an adult Fei-Hong, Iron Monkey finds a much
younger Fei-Hong (Sze-Man Tsang) and his father Wong Kei-Ying (Yen Chi
Dan) thrust into the middle of Iron Monkey's fight against oppression.</P>
<P>Iron Monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since Drunken Master 2.  At
times, fighting styles, especially that of Monkey himself, do devolve
into the ridiculous twinkle-toed floating of films like Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon, director Yuen Wo Ping eventually remembers to bring his
action scenes back to earth.</P>
<P>Iron Monkey is at its heart a hardcore, kung fu action film rather than
any kind of drama a la Crouching Tiger.  However, there are brief
moments of profoundness shared between characters, such as those that
pass between our outlaw hero and his good-hearted but misguided enemy,
Chief Fox.  In those moments, and in others, Iron Monkey manages to
transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts and minds of
its audience.  While in no way the equal of a masterpiece like Drunken
Master 2, Iron Monkey dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune.</P>
