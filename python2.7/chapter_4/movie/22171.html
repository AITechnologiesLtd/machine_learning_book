<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A very troubling film, regarding the crimes of Martha Beck and Raymond
Fernandez, who were executed in 1951. This Mexican version is a
re-working of The Honeymoon Killers (69) and is set in the Mexico of
1949. It offers a vivid picture of greed, vanity, and pure evil. This
film differs from the former in its more gaudy and cartoonish style and
careful camerawork taking note of the reflecting light patterns that
surrounded the couple, and with a penchant for showing the troubled
characters gazing into mirrors, as if they were looking for their lost
souls. The grim nature of its story was made less austere by the film's
black comedy, which was a staple of both films. As diabolical as this
film was, in showing the couple to be moral degenerates with no
conscience or redeeming qualities, the earlier film, the one I still
prefer, takes a slightly different emphasis, holding a more cult-like
look at the grotesque couple, while also showing them to be heartless
weirdos without any redeeming qualities.</P>
<P>Coral (Regina Orozco) is overweight and suffers from halitosis. She is a
nurse and a part-time embalmer whose search for her own Charles Boyer
ends when she meets gigolo-confidence man Nicolas (Daniel Gimenez Cacho)
through a lonely heart ad she responds to. This is match made in hell.
He poses as a native born Spaniard and a gentleman, who sleeps with her
at her urgings, and awakens from this bed of bliss to rob her, which she
sees but says nothing. She tracks him down with her two small children
in tow the next day and declares he is the man she always wanted and
will do anything for him. She even tells him, while she is waiting in
his apartment the next day for him to return, that she read all his
letters and knows that he is an extortionist and murdered one widow by
giving her an overdose of medication. When he waivers at her proposal to
live together, she takes the children the same day and dumps them in an
orphanage, saying she would rather have him than them. She tells him
that she would rather kill herself than not have him. This pleases the
egocentric gigolo, who suffers from severe migraines. He realizes that
this could work out for him, that she will never betray him.</P>
<P>The most important thing in Nico's life is to look good. His most
important possession is his hairpiece, as he is ashamed of his baldness
and spends long periods of time in front of the mirror adjusting the wig
and his fedora hat with the brim turned down. There is one point in the
story where he loses his hairpiece and he falls apart, until she comes
to the recue and has one made up with her hair.To say that this cowardly
couple has some psychological problems, is to say a mouthful.</P>
<P>The two team up, presenting themselves as brother and sister, as they go
on a long string of crimes together. Their first big job together, they
answer a lonely heart ad from a widow named Juanita (Egurrola). Things
go wrong when they meet her in a remote lounge and she tells him she is
penniless, living with a jealous lover and having to sneak out to meet
him. When the two start dancing romantically together, things go
bizarre, as the obese Coral has a jealousy tantrum and spikes the
widow's drink with rat poison, which kills her. So now their crime spree
is not only over greed but resorts to murder because of jealousy, and
the gigolo becomes her murder accomplice.</P>
<P>Their next victim is a lonely widow, Irene (Marisa). They convince her
to go along with them on a Christian crusade. Her anarchist, Jewish
neighbor (Furman) recognizes these two as charlatans and tries to warn
her friend, but to no avail. She is so desperate for a man in her bed,
that she runs off with the two and gets married in a cemetery. When they
check into a motel and she wants to sleep with her husband, the jealous
Coral cracks a statue over her head, and that takes care of another
widow. Her arrangement with Nico, is that he doesn't sleep with anyone
but her.</P>
<P>Their last murder is their most horrid and sloppiest one, as they answer
a personal ad from a widow (Espindola) in a backwater town, who wants to
meet a mechanic and will marry him after a two month courtship is proved
to be satisfactory to her. She turns out to be a young woman with a
young daughter, and is very sexually aggressive with Nico. She demands
that his sister leaves, which she does, but soon returns on Nico's
request that he needs her, that he is having migraines and that the
widow is pregnant. The cowardly couple have no qualms killing both the
mother and daughter, and it only through betrayal by one of them that
the cops are called.</P>
<P>In their execution the next day, the police gun them down like dogs in
the field, and the vain Nico only begs to be shot with his wig on. He
doesn't want to die in front of Coral without it on. I think that little
touch of vanity got weary after a while, and the director just made too
much of it. It lost its humorous quality by then in the story.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, this is a chilling tale by one of Mexico's most respected
director, who left no room for sympathizing over these two twisted
lovers, swindlers, and killers. The director caught the slimy couple's
depravity full-blast and never let up on them. To watch Coral put the
widow's young child in a bath and wantonly kill her, while at the same
time mothering her, was a ghastly sight to see.</P>
