<P>It's a tossup as to who can name today the would-be assassin of Ronald 
Reagan and the killer of John Lennon. But it is almost certain that 
even fewer 
people could name Valerie Solanas, the young woman (then 32) who, in 
1968, fired several shots at Andy Warhol, in the belief that he had 
betrayed her. Although she did not kill him, the profound 
psychological and physical affects changed his work-style and probably 
hastened his death in 1987.</P>
<P>The film is well researched and, in many ways fascinating. Valerie was 
a very special case, a maverick anti-male revolutionary who had a bad 
childhood, a psychology degree from the University of Maryland, an 
original mind, a life that included panhandling, lesbianism (some of 
it paid) and prostitution. Ironically, she needed money from men to 
survive so that she could turn against them. Ordinary, or even 
exceptional standards did not apply to Valerie.</P>
<P>When, in 1966, she was introduced to Warhol and his entourage (in his 
large, then famous loft called The Factory) she found herself in a 
milieu of artists or would-be artists, of oddities, transvestites, 
transsexuals and camp-followers who conformed to non-conformism. 
Valerie had writing aspirations but her main purpose was her obsessive 
conviction of the superiority of women over men, something that shapes 
up as a non-stop attack on the male gender, as summed up in her SCUM 
Manifesto (The Society for Cutting Up Men). She had founded that 
society, of which she was the sole member. The manifesto (much of 
which is given as lines spoken by Valerie in the movie) was an 
ultra-radical, all-out war against men as well as against conformist 
women and even wrong-thinking feminists. (SCUM got nowhere then, but 
later became a key text among militant feminists). </P>
<P>A lone wolf, Valerie, within the Warholian world was as much out of 
tune as outside it, with very rare exceptions, like her transvestite 
friend Candy Darling, and in a sense Warhol himself who, in many ways 
was an outsider among his own people. Valerie, in one of her 
black-humor, absurdist encounters, met Frenchman Maurice Girodias, the 
owner of the notorious Olympia Press, who eventually published the 
Manifesto -- and in Valerie's opinion exploited and cheated her.</P>
<P>The film melds nicely different shooting styles, from protracted 
scenes that remind one somewhat of Warhol movies, to fast-cutting 
sections that recall other Underground films of the period, to 
docu-dramas. All this is at the service of portraying a most unusual, 
and not balanced woman who, however, had method in her madness. </P>
<P>Lili Taylor, always dressed like a butch bag lady, is perfect in her 
part and, for all purposes, since none of us knows the real Valerie, 
she is Valerie. The real Valerie was born and raised in Atlantic City. 
I was amazed to learn that Taylor is a native of Chicago, as her 
accent seems to me to be pure and wonderfully consistent New 
Jerseyian. (It is the kind of accent that only people who grew with it 
like, the way a hyena's babies look beautiful to their mother). </P>
<P>The recreation of The Factory and its denizens is excellent, with 
notable performances, like Stephen Dorff's Candy Darling. Since  
pasty-faced, inexpressive, soft-spoken Warhol was, and to a large 
extent still is (through films and photos) a familiar presence, for 
viewers over a certain age a great deal of the movie's authenticity 
rides on his impersonator. Jared Harris, the son of actor Richard 
Harris, is a surprisingly believable simulacrum.</P>
