<P>IN SHORT: For the arthouse. Better for rental.</P>
<P>Welcome to County Cork, 1920. That would be after the time of "The
Troubles" detailed in Michael Collins; in the period when the English
Army and the Irish Republicans were still battling for control of the
Irish countryside. The big losers in this war are the Ascendancy,
English gentry and former Lords of the Land who, after hundreds of years
of occupancy, consider themselves Irish. The other tribe of Eire, of
course, consider these folk to be English and want them to go back where
they came from. Since where they came from is Ireland, you can see the
cultural problems looming.</P>
<P>But balancing cultural differences against army action and a blooming
relationship that puts both of the aforementioned things in conflict is
a mighty difficult thing to do. That's why novels are huge. That's why
screen adaptations, most of the time, come up short. Such is the case of
The Last September and, even as we ignore the Source Material as a
baseline comparison, we can tell stuff got lost.</P>
<P>As The Last September begins, we see a young couple of obvious monetary
plenitude. Lois Farquar (Keeley Hawes) dances down the rural avenue of
the estate run by Sir Richard (Michael Gambon) and Lady Myra Naylor
(Maggie Smith), flirtatious pheromones pouring from every pore. Laurence
Carstairs (Jonathan Slinger) follows. Behind the pair is a burly
handyman (Tom Hickey), carrying the portable Victrola which is pumping
out an Al Jolson tune. Back at the estate, eyebrows are raised at this
flirtation, which Lois pooh poohs because she is her uncle's niece and
Carstairs is her (Lois') aunt's nephew.</P>
<P>Nope, makes no sense to Cranky, either. Either something didn't make it
from the pages of the novel by Elizabeth Bowen or these Ascendant
Irish-English don't know diddle about genealogy. Anyway, Lois is more
interested in the Army Captain Gerald Colthurst (David Tennant) as a
suitor, though Lady Myra will see that this person with no money
dispatched post haste. While Sir Richard knows darn well that this year
will be the last, Lady Myra is content to believe that the English will
continue to rule this small part of the Empire. Danielstown, aka The Big
House, is chock full of guests, including Hugo and Francie Montmorency
(Lambert Wilson and Jane Birkin), who have sold their estate and are
looking for a suitably luxurious place to squat, and Marda Norton (Fiona
Shaw) who still harbors a major attraction for Hugo. Marda is suitably
engaged to a man in London, but still hopes she can insert herself
between Hugo and his wife.</P>
<P>The last guest is an unwanted one. Hiding in an old mill house on the
estate is Peter Connolly (Gary Lydon), an IRA fugitive wanted for the
murder of an English Army officer. While the Army keeps an eye on
Connolly's parent's house, he is being tended to surreptitiously by Lois
-- who still finds herself attracted to the boy she grew up with, all
the while knowing that aiding the fugitive could get her put to death.</P>
<P>The story arc of that particular trio is easy to follow. Problem is, and
this is just a dumb kid from Brooklyn talking, that the story arcs of
the supporting characters aren't clear and, even with dialog explaining
why each is staying at Danielstown, there's no great sense that any of
their particular stories matter. If Lois is truly meaning to see if any
kind of spark still exists between her and Hugo, it isn't apparent.
Hugo's wife, Francie is as meek and nonexistent as the proverbial fly on
the wall. As for the elderly Lord and Lady Naylor, even with the minute
amount of screen time they receive, they firmly establish the background
of the tale, and Smith's performance is (as usual) head and tails above
all else as she brings the full weight of English class consciousness
crashing down on the head of the poor Captain.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to The Last September, he would have
paid...</P>
<PRE>$3.00</PRE>
<P>Rent, even if you're into this kind of flick.</P>
