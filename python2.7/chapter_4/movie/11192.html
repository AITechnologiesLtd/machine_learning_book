<PRE>                         KISSING A FOOL</PRE>
<P>What a fun movie!    The story may not be the most believable but
the acting is so deliciously good and fast-paced you are not going
to care; it will seem like a true story.</P>
<P>The movie opens with a wedding in a large outdoor garden.</P>
<P>Max (David Schwimmer) and Jay (Jason Lee) are best friends who go
way back together. While Max, a sports broadcaster who has more
women than should be allowed any one man in a lifetime, that is
about all he does know.  Women and sports.   Jay, on the other hand,
is more literary and cultured.   One day Jay tells Max he has a
girl, Samantha,  whom Max   absolutely must date.   Affectionately
called "Sam," she (the adorable Mili Avatal), happens to be an
editor at a publishing house where Jay is having his book made
ready.  Playboy Max and cultured Sam could hardly be less alike.</P>
<P>In a hysterically funny scene, a real belly-laugher, Max berates Jay
for having ruined his reputation by having himself be seen and
photographed with a loud-mouthed drunk.   In detail he describes
last night to an incredulous Jay.</P>
<P>Very shortly thereafter  Max is moving into Sam's apartment.
Surprised?   Never fear; it is all explained in the movie..   Sam
makes an announcement, on a sports broadcast listened to by his many
female friends, that he is no longer "available."    At this point I
should mention that while Schwimmer and Lee are handsome, the
beautiful, Ms. Avatal, a shining star in Israel, has the most
expressive eyes and face anywhere on the screen today.  Lovely.
Worth the price of admission;</P>
<P>All would be well as both Sam and Max appear to be  deeply in love.
But Max,  the kind of guy who never heard  "If it ain't broke,
don't fix it," begins to worry what if one day Sam decides she has
had enough of him and dumps him; he has always been the dumper and
now is afraid of possibly ending up a dumpee.   He must find out if
Sam is a one-man woman.   If Jay would play up to her with flowers,
dinners, nice words, would he be able to get Sam into the sack?  If
"Yes" then he better know before he marries her.</P>
<P>Jay, of course, tells him he is crazy and he will not do it but Max
begs and so Jay goes along. The idea is not to bed her but only to
see if that were possible.   As well we all know, nothing ever works
out as planned which is why this riotous comedy takes a very humorous turn.</P>
<P>Almost stealing the movie from the three main characters is Bonnie
Hunt as Linda, a woman at the wedding who is relating to two
breathless guests what the wedding is all about..   She knows every
bit of the story that leads up to the wedding and she relates what
is happening while the movie flashes back and forth in time to show
what it is she is describing. A gimmick but here used to perfection.
Not to be missed.</P>
