<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A strangely crafted cult-mystery story that is not resolved in a tidy manner, as
it asks the viewer to decide if what they saw was the protagonist's
hallucination or something real! </P>
<P>Tim Brett (Hemmings) is an ex-addict, residing in London, who has turned his
life around in the past year by kicking his drug habit and writing a
best-selling book about his experiences. His fiancé is a stunning redhead named
Juliet (Hunnicutt). </P>
<P>The film opens with Tim in a fancy Italian resort, visiting with his elderly
Aunt Lucy Dawson (Robson). She appears as a kindly soul who shows a concern
about his association with shady people and tells him that she wants to meet
them, as ever since her husband was murdered she has done charity work to help
the unfortunate criminals make a better life for themselves. She formed a secret
society along with Mrs. Gray (Washbourne) and Mr. Copsey (Wilfrid Hyde-White),
called "The Stepping Stones," which secretly helps the ex-cons get jobs when
they are paroled. </P>
<P>In a tourist grave site, Lucy is found strangled to death. The Italian police
investigate for a week and come up with no motive for the murder or any
suspects. While going back by train to London, Tim encounters an odd lady who
gives him a letter to read when he gets home that she says will help him with
his murder investigation. Since the Italian police were so inefficient, he has
decided to investigate his aunt's death on his own. </P>
<P>The letter is a warning for him to drop the investigation or else! It was
written on his typewriter, as his apartment was broken into and there is a
phonograph record with cackling laughter on it and someone else's stub of a
gold-tipped cigarette in his ash tray. He's about to report it to the police,
when a Sgt. Matthews knocks on his door and tells him that an anonymous woman on
the train accuses him of making sexual advances. Later, she will be found dead
after she has another conversation with Tim, asking his forgiveness for what she
did. </P>
<P>It turns out that Tim theorizes correctly that Lucy was blackmailing the ex-cons
she has helped become successful, and could have been murdered by any one of the
700 secret members of her "Stepping Stones." Tim is now being setup to look like
he's going crazy so he will be considered an unreliable witness. It also turns
out that there is no such a person as Sgt. Matthews. The real police find his
story hard to believe without any facts to go on, and he retreats into a world
of hallucinations as he gets threatening phone calls and can't get anyone to
believe him. </P>
<P>In the climax he marries Julia, but has a breakdown and can't continue the
investigation as he's completely unbalanced and reduced to being in a
wheelchair. He even suspects Julia as being a part of those who are persecuting
him. The film ends up feeling like a case study for paranoia and madness, more
than it does a mystery story. I was absorbed by the story up to a point, but
didn't feel satisfied with the vague way the story was resolved. Though, David
Hemmings' convincing performance gives this film a creepy mood to hang its hat
on. </P>
