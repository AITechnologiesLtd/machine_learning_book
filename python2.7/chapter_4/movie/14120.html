                              DEAD MAN ON CAMPUS
                         A movie review by Joe Barlow
                             (c) Copyright 1998</PRE>
<P>STARRING:   Tom Everett Scott, Mark-Paul Gosselaar, Poppy Montgomery
DIRECTOR:   Alan Cohn
WRITERS:    Anthony Abrams and Adam Larson Broder
RATED/YEAR: R/1998</P>
<PRE>                   RATING: ** 1/2 (out of a possible *****)</PRE>
<P>        "Dead Man on Campus" is a dark comedy about the ancillary benefits
of college life: non-stop parties, free booze, and more sex than anyone
could possibly want.  Sound like your college days?  No?  Okay, okay.
"Dead Man on Campus" is a dark comedy about the stereotypes inherent in
college life, such as the belief that all higher-learning activities
revolve around the above items.  But considering the film is brought to
us by MTV, a network built around stereotypes and the lowest-common
denominator, that shouldn't be a surprise.  Thanks to their programming,
I've learned that all musicians, particularly women, are rail-thin and
gorgeous, something I honestly didn't know.</P>
<PRE>        Oh, wait.  I'm supposed to be reviewing a movie, right?</PRE>
<P>        Tom Everett Scott is Josh Miller, a smart, amiable guy from Iowa.
Bookworm Josh's GPA has earned him an academic scholarship to Daleman
University, a school whose medical studies department is unparalleled.
Josh, who honestly intends to make something of himself, knows that with
a great deal of hard work and studying, he can earn his medical degree
and make his family proud.</P>
<P>        His roommate Cooper (Mark-Paul Gosselaar), however, makes this
very difficult.  A rich kid who's at college only to procure the items
mentioned in this review's opening paragraph, Cooper turns goofing off
and procrastination into an art form.  He doesn't go to a single class,
but does learn a great deal about herbal recreation, much to Josh's
chagrin.</P>
<P>        It doesn't take long for the film to turn into a combination of
"The Odd Couple" and a buddy picture; although straight-arrow Josh is
initially turned off by his roomate's hell-raising antics, Cooper's
personality is infectuous.  Too infectous, perhaps; soon, Josh is spending
all of his time partying, getting high with his new friend, and having
staggering amounts of sex with the lovely Rachel (Poppy Montgomery).</P>
<P>        By the time midterms roll around, both boys know they're in
serious trouble: Josh is in danger of losing his scholarship, and Cooper's
dad may force him to leave school and come work in the family business, a
fate which Copper considers worse than death.  Sensible Josh suggests that
the two of them become study buddies and work extra-hard on their
schoolwork to make up for lost time.  Cooper, however, has a different
plan.</P>
<P>        It seems that Daleman University's charter contains a provision
which could save both of them, without forcing them to resort to anything
as vulgar as studying.  The rule: if any Daleman student commits suicide,
his or her roomates will be awarded straight A's, regardless of prior
academic standing.  Kinda like a consolation prize, to help the mourners
deal with their grief.  Cooper's plan: steal the University's psycho-
logical records, find a suicide-prone student, convince said student to
move in with the two of them, and gradually pressure him into killing
himself.</P>
<PRE>        COOPER: Hey, if he's gonna kill himself anyway, he might as
                well do somebody some good!</PRE>
<P>        The rest of the film deals with Josh and Cooper's attempts to
accomplish this lofty goal, as a succession of roommates, all of whom
are memorable and entertaining in their own way, file into their spare
room.  Fratboy Cliff (Lochlyn Munro) is such a wild-child that he nearly
kills himself accidentally several times over the course of the story;
Cooper suggests that if they can tolerate his presence just a while
longer, they might get lucky.  Computer geek Buckly (Randy Pearlstein) is
a conspiracy-theorist who believes that Microsoft's Bill Gates is out to
steal his brain.  But their best bet may be Matt (Corey Page), a
chronically-depressed punk musician who writes downbeat songs (with
titles like "Sperm"), and talks constantly about his vivid, recurring
dreams of putting a pistol in his mouth.</P>
<P>        The premise is morbid yet very funny; handled a different way,
the material could've transcended from merely "entertaining" to
"hysterical."  Although the film is being billed as black humor, I
dispute that label, since too much of the movie's emphasis is on
physical comedy.  While that's not neccessarily a problem, the story's
premise is amusing enough that it doesn't really need these forced
additions.  The movie works best when the humor comes from Josh and
Cooper's attempts to instigate suicidal thoughts into their roommates'
minds.  (Cooper, for example, volunteers for the school's suicide hotline.
As he's being trained on how to discourage callers from ending their
lives, he jots down the opposite of what his instructor is saying, to
give him new things to try out on his roomates.)  It would have been
interesting to see what someone like David Lynch, a director well-versed
in "dark," could've done with this material.</P>
<P>        The cast is quite good.  Tom Everett Scott, fresh from his
starring roles in "That Thing You Do" and "An American Werewolf in
Paris," is very likeable as Josh, and Mark-Paul Gosselaar (Saved by
the Bell)'s portrayal of Cooper is equally warm; while you wouldn't
neccessary want to live with him, he'd be good company on a Friday
night.  But both of their performances are eclipsed by their various
roommates'.  The depressed (but incredibly rude) Matt was my favorite, as
he moped sadly in his room, singing self-pitying songs on his guitar,
while Josh and Cooper passionnately urge him to end it all.</P>
<P>        But the ladies of the film, through no fault or their own, don't
fare nearly as well.  Josh's girlfriend Rachel feels so out of place here
that I strongly suspect her inclusion in the script was an afterthought.
It feels as though her presence is the result of a demographic study, which
revealed to the studio bosses that a love interest of some sort was needed to
hold the attention of female movie-goers; therefore, Rachel was invented, her
lines hurridly scribbed down on a napkin, then shoe-horned into the already
completed script.  Poppy Montgomery does an adequate job of portraying the
character, but she's given so little to do or say that the performance never
really catches fire.  Rachel's two friends Lucy and Kristin (Alyson Hannigan
and Mari Morrow, respectively) fare even worse; they're reduced to walk-on
parts, with an occasional bit of slapstick thrown in for good measure.</P>
<P>        There are some great moments in the film, and I laughed out loud
perhaps half-a-dozen times.  The opening credits sequence is one of the
most innovative that I've ever seen, the music is very catchy, and the
story's resolution is actually far more clever than I expected the movie
capable of being.  Nonetheless, the film is perhaps half an hour too long,
primarily in the opening scenes; hence, the story doesn't really get
rolling until we're nearly 45 minutes into it.  Still, this is a pleasant
enough diversion, with a fresh premise and some occasionally funny moments.
Seen with a large group of friends, this movie could be great fun.</P>
