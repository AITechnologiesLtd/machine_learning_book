<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>First-time film director and former music video director Spike Jonze has
come up with a tantalizing feast for the self to nosh on, cooked by
Charles Kaufman's original screenplay, that offers up some very
intangible delicacies on its plate, such as a psychological, personal
and sexual identity study, allowing the eater to suspend belief about
what is being digested and be allowed to tastefully enter into the mind
of another being. It is a playful and provocative look at determining
one's identity and how celebrity is viewed from within, featuring an
actual celebrity, the performer, John Malkovich, who is playing himself,
as the mind who is being entered. If someone could market via virtual
reality how to actually do that, it might cost as much as $200 for a 15
minute sightseeing trip down that path, the charge established in the
film for such a trip, while for the movie viewer it is only for the
nominal cost of a movie ticket that one gets to have such a unique
experience.</P>
<P>Craig Schwartz (John Cusack), the film's wormy, unemployed New York
puppeteer and unlikely protagonist, appearing scraggy looking and acting
despondent and unhappy with his lot in life, as someone who knows his
craft but is not appreciated by the public he wishes to conquer and
therefore can't do the work he believes he was put on earth to do. The
last straw for Craig, is seeing his successful competitor put up a
gimmicky display overhanging a highway in Weschester County, of a
gigantic 60-foot Emily Dickinson, entitled "The Belle of Amherst." He
rationalizes his failure to get noticed by stating, "Nobody's looking
for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate."</P>
<P>At home, he is lost in his own problems, with his schlump-like pet store
employed wife, Lotte (Cameron Diaz), who is a pet enthusiast, having an
assortment of pets in the house, including a chimpanzee whom she loves
more than her husband. The husband is the one who cheerfully is being
nagged by her to get a job until something materializes for him as a
puppeteer. So he scans the newspapers, and our hero seeks out a job as a
filing clerk for the Lester Corporation, absurdly located on the 71/2th
floor in a Manhattan skyscraper, that has low ceilings forcing everyone
to stoop when walking. The running gag being, that the overhead and the
rent are also low here.</P>
<P>Employed on the same floor as our hero, is an attractive, fast-talking,
sarcastic bundle of promising sex, Maxine Lund (Keeler), who has our
hero tongue-tied and in a flirtatious mood, who is not rebuffed by her
dislike of his physical appearance. She is perfect for the part of the
film's bitch.</P>
<P>What also excites him about his new job, is that he discovers a portal
behind his filing cabinet that goes tunnel-like down into the mind of
John Malkovich and after 15 minutes throws him out on the grassy side of
the New Jersey Turnpike. Since the glimpse into Malkovich's head is more
or less fictional, it's delightfully funny to find Craig turning up
inside the man's head and to find the actor eating toast and reading The
Wall Street Journal in his Park Avenue apartment.</P>
<P>A business partnership between the scheming Maxine and Craig is
consumated, as the two decide to advertise in the newspaper and take
celebrity seeking visitors into the secret portal all-through the night.
When Lotte finds out about the portal, she is exhilarated by the
experience of being inside the actor's head and watching him on a date
with Maxine. Lotte becomes the second member of the Schwartz family to
fall head-over-heels for the irresistible Maxine. It seems when inside
the head of the actor, the Schwartz's are able to attract the elusive
Maxine, but when left to their own identities, she treats them as
nobodies.</P>
<P>Having their fun with this nutty script is Orson Bean, as the
105-year-old entrepreneur, Dr. Lester, who is the head of the Lester
Corporation, and is devilishly amusing as the lecherous businessman and
the man who knows more about the portal than it appears he does, as he
uses it as a way of living forever by changing identities. Also seen at
work is Floris (Mary Kay Place), as a confused secretary who is an
expert on speech impediments but who doesn't realize she suffers from
one herself, and gives an outstanding supporting performance, adding
more punch to an already zany story.</P>
<P>The film was brilliant in spots but towards the end ran out of enough
nourishing food to sustain its steady diet of farcical comedy. But even
as it was petering out, it still managed to have enough brilliant
glimpses at celebrity and how some crave that sort of identity, to make
it both hilarious and somewhat intellectually appealing, and leave off
with an ending that is unnerving. What makes this insane premise work
out so surprisingly well, is that the actors get the joke and run with
it, even flushing out seemingly irrelevant things about one's inner
being along the way that are fun to scrutinize. And if anything more can
be said about John Malkovich than that he is a grand actor, it is that
he comes across as a good person, someone with a good sense of humor and
someone who is able to heartily have a laugh at himself even if it is
supposedly at his own expense. This is the kind of strange film that one
would expect to be released as an art-house indie, yet here it is
playing as a mainstream big production.</P>
