<P>Last week  I saw  Trick, a  gay (merry) gay (sexually) movie. This 
week I saw the lesbian romantic comedy Better Than Chocolate. I keep 
no statistics on film genres, but it would seem that same-sex light 
fare is on the increase.</P>
<P>No doubt, any growing genre entails the creation of its own types of 
cliches. Even the so-called "independent" movies develop formulas. 
But  in the case of gay-lesbian ones, it is rather nice to see cinema 
widening its scope--especially when this is done with total 
un-selfconciousness. If you think of those works as dealing with 
minorities, they could even help to get pictures out of the rut of 
older, mainstream types, by encouraging the making of movies about 
other minorities: vegetarians, atheists, Southern Democrats, 
well-paid teachers, efficient administrators, watchers of good TV, 
good spellers, people who use "whom" instead of "who," foreign-movie 
buffs, and so on. What a reservoir of fresh subjects!</P>
<P>The Canadian Better Than Chocolate is a light, zippy situation-yarn 
which won the top prize at the latest Gay and Lesbian Film Festival 
in London. Actually, it is not very exciting, yet it's not dull 
either, and it has its own charm.</P>
<P>Set in a lesbian milieu of Vancouver, its major focus is on Maggie 
and Kim . Maggie is a 19-year old college drop-out, who wants to be a 
writer and live "real life." She is cute. ( I like this word; it 
means something special and has no precise equivalent in any other 
language I know). By day she works in the lesbian Ten Percent 
Bookstore. By night she performs  (regularly or not, it's unclear) at 
a lesbian club.</P>
<P>Maggie meets the somewhat older Kim, an itinerant artist whose 
drawings and body-painting are not bad at all. Kim lives in her van. 
For the two girls it's love at first sight.  A quick first attempt at 
physical consummation takes place inside the van. It is interrupted, 
to their bewilderment (and laughter) as the illegally parked vehicle 
gets hauled away to the pound. Good gag.</P>
<P>Maggie, on the phone Lila, her mother, learns that she is divorcing 
Maggie's stepfather as that man has been sleeping for a year with a 
younger woman, his partner's wife I believe, but I can't guarantee 
this. Lila, in her upheaval, hears from Maggie that she's not in 
school, but makes no fuss. Instead, she announces that she's coming 
all the way from the distant East of the United States,with Paul (17 
or so), Maggie's hunkish brother.They will  stay (temporarily, I 
suppose) with Maggie.</P>
<P>Metaphorically speaking, trumpets blare and drums beat as Maggie, who 
sleeps in the bookstore and has not fessed up her sexual preferences 
to Mom, rushes to find a place to live in "en famille," which would 
also include "housemate" Kim. From a lesbian lady, she rents, for a 
short time, a large and rather shoddy loft.</P>
<P>Mom and Brother show up.  A charade familiar from hetero-films gets 
going. Lila is     ditzy  and likable. She neither perceives nor is 
told by Maggie of the latter's sex choices. (But on his first morning 
there, Brother catches the girls making love. He takes it with cool 
and naturalness). Semi-complications ensue. These also involve 
30-plus Judy who is also Jeremy, a transsexual in every way except 
that, if I got this right, he hasn't yet had The Operation. He/she is 
very simpatico and strikes a frienship with Mom, who has no clue 
about "her" being a man.</P>
<P>Later at the club Judy performs the song "I'm not a f... drag queen" 
well and with brio.  But how I missed having a youngish Marlene 
Dietrich doing it! There's also a trio of day-glo/black light singers 
who do a lively homage to Julie Christie. (I'll have to find out more 
about her).</P>
<P>There are several small felicities, side events and mini-subplots : 
the Customs impound a shipment of porno (?) books from the United 
States; Judy "outs" her secret love for Frances, the bookstore's shy, 
spinsterish owner; Lila stumbles onto a stash of the loft-owner's sex 
toys and happily experiments with them; Paul gets panting sex going 
with the bookstore's pansexual employee: etc. etc.</P>
<P>The un-rated movie's sex scenes are pretty steamy-hot but ought not 
to annoy a savvy public. The younger actresses are convincing but no 
more. Peter Outerbridge (as Judy) is very good in moods that mix or 
alternate pathos and sophistication. Wendy Crewson (as Lila) all but 
steals the show.</P>
<P>The rub comes in some ways that make the film shaky.The characters, 
beyond functioning as servants to the plot, have really no dimension, 
personality or character. Maggie's efforts to hide her sexual nature 
from Mom are pretty inexplicable, since Lila seems to be receptive. 
And Lila's blitheness or blindness to what is obvious is overdone.</P>
<P>The latter weakness could have been taken care of by clues that Lila 
is so involved in her own problems thats she can't  see the woods for 
the trees; and/or by having her get it but pretend she does not;  or 
by refusing to admit it. Too bad, since Ms Crewson (about whom I know 
nothing, given the lack of press information) is such a colorful and 
dynamic performer.</P>
<P>The film's title comes from a Sarah McLachlan song, "ice cream." Lila 
spells it out : she is a secret chocolate-junkie.  At some point she 
declares to the young ones, with her habitual candor and directness: 
"Since I probably won't ever have sex again, chocolate is the only 
pleasure left me." (That was before she discovered the sex gagdgets).</P>
<P>Let's not get too serious, however. There are side-isssues and 
subtexts about valid, serious matters, but the movie is primarily 
pleasant, good-humored, high-energy  fluff.</P>
