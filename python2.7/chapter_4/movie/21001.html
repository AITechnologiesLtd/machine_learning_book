<P>David E. Kelley, it seems, has yet to find a comfortable niche in the
Hollywood film industry. Kelley (the creator of Ally McBeal and The
Practice) tried his luck earlier this year with Lake Placid, a crocodile
comedy that apparently didn't contain enough wit (or was that too much
wit?). Now, the writer has concocted an imaginary Alaskan town to bring
us the hockey-oriented Mystery, Alaska.</P>
<P>Citizens of Mystery celebrate the Canadian pastime of ice hockey like a
religion. The town sheriff, Jon Biebe (Russell Crowe), leads the local
11-man squad out every Saturday for a league game on a nearby pond.
Everyone is excited when the latest Sports Illustrated issue appears,
containing a three-page article about the dedication to the sport in the
small town. The writer of the article, former Mystery resident Charles
Danner (Hank Azaria), comes calling soon after with an interesting
proposition. It seems NHL executives read the story and thought it would
be great publicity to send the New York Rangers up to Alaska for an
exhibition game. Everyone is Mystery is soon overcome with anxiety, as
they try and prep the town for the Rangers' arrival in a mere 32 days.</P>
<P>Kelley always populates his projects with humorous personalities, and
here he sticks with tradition. The mayor (Colm Meaney) doesn't want to
be embarrassed by this `publicity stunt'. He should be more concerned
about his wife (Lolita Davidovich), who is having a heated affair with a
careless player named, appropriately, Skank (Ron Eldard). Skank seems to
be setting his sights on a different female target every night (as he
puts it, `I play hockey and fornicate. Those are the two funnest things
to do in cold weather'). Meanwhile, Biebe's wife Donna (Mary McCormick)
seems to be eyeing recent returnee and old high school flame Danner.
Burt Reynolds plays Judge Burns, a former hockey coach and big fat
grouch extrordinaire.</P>
<P>This is certainly not one of Kelley's better outings. His screenplay
(which he co-wrote with Sean O'Byrne) stumbles terribly out of the gate,
jumbled with plot details and unsure of what direction to eventually
take. Luckily, he begins an admirable recovery during the days leading
up to the big game, with some surprisingly effective dramatics that
almost caught me off guard. More recognition should go to director Jay
Roach (of Austin Powers' fame), who paints an enjoyable portrait of a
small town about to be placed in the spotlight.</P>
<P>Mystery, Alaska is entirely predictable from the first frame on - and
yet, even as the inevitable rolls around, it remains in good fun. The
film is a bit too profane than perhaps needed, but that's only when it
sidesteps it's generally pleasant and good-natured appeal. The plot is
basically an underdog story like The Mighty Ducks, only for adults. And
despite one or two obvious caricatures, these Alaskans have a certain
charm.</P>
<P>The caricatures are Azaria and Reynold's characters (with the latter
saving his obvious existence with convincing gruffness), but the rest of
the cast is rock solid. Crowe, who displayed wonderful intensity in L.A.
Confidential, gives Jon Biebe the everyman quality that any lead
requires. Colm Meaney and Maury Chaykin are both terrific in supporting
roles, and one Mystery team player caught my eye: the big, likable oaf
Tree (a perfectly cast Kevin Durand). With his effortless charm and
persistence, Durand owns a few of the best scenes in the movie.</P>
<P>Regular sports movies' clichés abound in the last thirty minutes, but a
few unexpected cameo appearances help quite a bit. As I mentioned
before, every second of film can probably be predicted beforehand. Will
the former coach step forward and guide the underdog team to a win? Will
the star player escape a prison charge in time to play the game? Well,
duh. Mystery, Alaska is funny and entertaining enough to adequately fill
a two-hour time slot - unless, of course, you absolutely despise
everything involving David E. Kelley and the game of hockey. But then,
why would you even go?</P>
