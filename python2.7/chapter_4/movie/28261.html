BIG EDEN
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>First-time writer and director Thomas Bezucha's BIG EDEN is part gay 
romance and part slice-of-small-town-life story.  A good-spirited and 
closely observed movie, it is filled with honest characters who all 
possess a genuine chemistry.  The would-be lovers and the townsfolk 
actually care about one another.  The cynics, of course, will argue that 
such rampant humanitarianism makes it all a fairy tale, but I found it 
touching and believable from beginning to end.</P>
<P>As the story opens, Henry Hart (Arye Gross), a Manhattan artist, is 
called back to his remote hometown in Montana, where his grandfather 
(George Coe) has had a stroke.  Once back in town, Henry is forced to 
confront the love of his life, Dean Stewart (Tim DeKay), a straight 
buddy of his from school.  The recently divorced Dean has just moved 
back into town with his two young boys.  Dean's a physical kind of guy 
who likes lots of bear hugs and manly touching, which frustrates Henry 
enormously.  Although they haven't even spoken in 10 years, Henry still 
has his lifelong crush on Dean.  Both actors turn in nicely nuanced and 
compelling performances.</P>
<P>The story concerns a few, not very well kept secrets.  Henry tries to 
keep his sexual orientation from his grandfather although most locals 
figure it out.  The other secret concerns cooking.</P>
<P>In the story's most engaging and enigmatic performance, Eric Schweig 
(TOM & HUCK) plays Pike Dexter, a painfully shy, gentle giant who is 
uncomfortable speaking to humans, although he opens up easily to his 
dog.  A Native American, Pike runs the general store and post office in 
which the town's inhabitants spend most of their free time.  When 
Henry's grandfather requires a special diet and Pike is asked to deliver 
his food, Pike launches into the equivalent of a home study version of a 
speed cooking course.  Reading voraciously, Pike turns himself in short 
order into an accomplished chef.  He tries to hide all this by 
substituting his food for that of the local spinster who supposedly is 
preparing the grandfather's meals.  Her food goes to Pike's dog, who'll 
eat anything.</P>
<P>Beautifully filmed and warmly scored, the movie is a treat for the eyes 
and ears.  Only a needlessly pat ending spoils what is otherwise a 
realistic and moving story.</P>
<P>BIG EDEN runs 1:57.  It is rated PG-13 for some mature thematic material 
and would be acceptable for kids around 12 and up.</P>
<P>The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, June 8, 2001.  
In the Silicon Valley, it will be showing at the Camera Cinemas.</P>
