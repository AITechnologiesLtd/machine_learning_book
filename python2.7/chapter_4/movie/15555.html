<P>Ever since Universal Pictures announced that they and director Gus Van Sant
("Good Will Hunting") would be `recreating' the Alfred Hitchcock masterpiece
"Psycho", the most oft asked question has been a simple three letter word:
why?  Well, given that it has been asked so much, it seems almost futile at
this point to ask it again.  It's done, it's in theaters, and that's
that-deal with it.</P>
<P>Besides, to ask `why?' to such an issue is as pointless as asking, `Why is
there pain and suffering?' or `Why do NBA players feel they need more
 money?' or even `Why is sleeping with an intern young enough to be your
daughter so easily forgiven nowadays?'  There are no reasonable answers to
these questions.  These realities exist, no matter how ludicrous they may
be, and that's the end of it.  We just need to accept it and move on.</P>
<P>So with that open frame of mind, I went to see the new "Psycho".  And as I
left the theater upon the film's conclusion, only one thought continued to
haunt my mind: why?  I know, I know, it's pointless to even ask.  But for
one who knows the greatness of the original (as so many of us do), I simply
couldn't stop myself from asking it.  In the context of having seen the
original, to see the new one simply warrants asking the question `why?'.
Hitchcock's "Psycho" has earned the right to be elevated as one of cinema's
sacred cows.  To tamper with such greatness is to flirt with cinematic blasp
hemy.  It is only because of a few elements of original creativity that Van
Sant and the rest should be saved from eternal film damnation.</P>
<P>Universal's new "Psycho" has been touted as a `shot-for-shot recreation' of
the original.  And while it does stay about 95% faithful to the original
script, it is not a pure `shot-for-shot' remake.  This is evident in the
film's opening hotel room scene.  Van Sant utilizes more close-ups and
camera movement than Hitchcock did in this sequence.  This is not a gripe on
my part, but simply an observation.  Such liberties in shot selection are
taken throughout this film, but some are unavoidable given that many of the
sets and locations are not exact replicas of the original.</P>
<P>But having said that, the new "Psycho" does contain a bountiful number of
shots that are literal recreations.  It was interesting to see these and
think back to the originals.  The sad part is that I continually found
myself preferring the originals, thus making this new movie going experience
more of a letdown.  As intriguing as the idea of a recreation is, I think
the talented Van Sant should have just opted to do a remake and bring his
own style to the table (that is, if he really had to remake it to begin
with).</P>
<P>Joseph Stefano, the original screenwriter for Hitchcock's "Psycho", was
brought on board to make minor tweaks to his script in order to update the
story to the Nineties.  As a result a few changes were made, one example
being the money stolen by Marion Crane was increased from $40,000 to
$400,000.  Necessary alterations such as these occur from time to time, but
for the most part the story remains intact.  Other changes are also present,
but I tend to think that they were more Van Sant's doing than Stefano's.
For those of you who wish to discover those changes for yourself, I won't
detail them in this review.  But for the curious or indifferent, you can
find a list of those changes with a link provided in the review on my
website (the link to that list can be found in this same paragraph).  It
essentially lists the differences that I observed.  For a link to the review
itself, see the top of this page.</P>
<P>But what I will do here is discuss my take on the film's look as well as its
performances, and I'll begin with the latter.  I do a great deal of
comparing between the two versions and the remainder of this review is
rather lengthy as a result.  Normally I would not do this with your standard
remake.  But given the fact that this is supposed to be a recreation of a
masterpiece, I feel that such comparative analysis is warranted.</P>
<P>Needless to say, the actors in this film certainly had their work cut out
for them.  And while these talented performers do a fine job in their own
right, their characterizations simply pale in comparison to the originals.</P>
<P>I'll start right off the bat with Norman Bates.  Without even taking
characterization into account, Vince Vaughn ("The Lost World", "Swingers")
simply isn't right for this role in my opinion.  Physically, he's just too
big.  The thin, lanky build of Anthony Perkins personified the shy mamma's
boy personality of Norman Bates.  Vaughn is no mamma's boy.  His build and
height tower over the rest of the cast, making him appear stronger than he
should.  Perkins didn't look like a threatening guy, making Norman all the
more creepy.  With the intimidating Vaughn, you almost expect the guy to
haul off on some of these people.  His obvious talent aside, Vaughn was
simply miscast.</P>
<P>Okay, so he doesn't look the part-but can he act it?  Yeah, he did okay.  It
's a fine job of acting to be honest, but one that would have looked better
had it not Perkins's masterful performance to overshadow it.  Vaughn
definitely makes it real, but his Norman Bates is a little too obvious in
comparison to Perkins.  Perkins was meek and child-like.  He was friendly,
but shy.  Vaughn's Bates is too personable.  Also, Vaughn exposes Bates's
psychosis more than Perkins did.  With Perkins you sense that there may be
something odd or different, but it's probably only because his mother
emotionally suppressed him.  To see Vaughn's Bates is to think, `Um, there's
really something wrong with this guy.'  And in the `post shower clean-up'
scene, we really see the difference between the two.  The Vaughn Bates is
genuinely troubled as he cleans up the blood and disposes of the body.  But
the Perkins Bates has a rather disturbing, methodical approach to him.  This
calm, calculated persona is far more troubling and intriguing.  Again, let
me restate that Vaughn does a fine job here.  But the Anthony Perkins Bates,
one of cinema's all-time great performances, is in every regard superior.</P>
<P>The other character prone for extensive dissection is that of Marion Crane.
It is up to the immensely talented and strong actress Anne Heche to fill the
Oscar-nominated shoes of Janet Leigh.  As with Vaughn, Heche ("Return To
Paradise", "Six Days, Seven Nights") does a good job; but she doesn't live
up to the standard set by Leigh.  Heche has a strong, assertive personality
in her acting style.  She brings it to the role of Marion Crane, and I feel
it is to the detriment of the character.  There's almost a sense of a dry
sarcastic attitude with Heche.  Heche's Marion is too confident and
emotionally together to be a person who is having an affair or one who
impulsively steals money and hightails it out of town.  It seems out of
character for her to do these things.  From the very beginning, Leigh's
Marion had an unease and nervousness about her.  She seemed confused and
uncertain.  Heche does not.</P>
<P>This comes into play in two key areas, the first of which is Marion's drive
that eventually leads her to the Bates Motel.  It is during this drive that
Marion imagines what others will be saying about her once they've discovered
what she has done.  Janet Leigh's stark, unblinking eyes revealed a paranoid
heart and guilty conscious.  Her intense stare showed us a mind that was
racing.  The intensity is lost with Heche.  She merely appears to be
thinking these thoughts, but doesn't seem overly troubled by them.  There
was something mysterious about Leigh's Marion, we never quite understand or
know her.  Heche, in comparison, almost seems like an open book.</P>
<P>The other scene is her parlor conversation with Bates.  As Norman discusses
the traps that each of us live in, Leigh's Marion subtly showed increasing
guilt and nervousness about the situation she had gotten herself into.
Again, Heche doesn't quite achieve this.  We see her thinking, but the
emotional aspect isn't there with the same intensity.  As a result, it
almost seems surprising that Heche's Marion would make the decision to
return home in the morning.  She hasn't seemed troubled enough up to this
point, so why does she feel compelled to turn back?  Plot-wise, it's
unavoidable of course.  But there's not enough emotional subtext with Heche
to motivate the change.  The bottom line-Heche's interpretation is simply
too strong and confident.</P>
<P>I will give praise to Heche for one key addition that I thought was very
insightful.  In the ill-fated shower scene, Heche's Marion has a moment of
recognition before she is brutally murdered.  This recognition, I feel,
increases the level of psychological terror in the scene.  Kudos to Heche
for this small but masterful improvement.</P>
<P>Without going into as much depth, I do wish to address some of the other key
characters.  William H. Macy ("Fargo") plays Detective Arbogast, hired by
Marion's employer to track her down.  Macy brings his trademark naturalism
to the role, but like Vaughn, he seems physically miscast.  Martin Balssam's
Arbogast was a husky gumshoe.  And although his demeanor was calm and
unthreatening, his physical presence seemed to intimidate the weaker Norman.
The physical makeup of the actors is reversed here, with Vaughn being much
bigger in comparison to Macy.  Balssam's Arbogast almost seemed like a
threatening male figure to Norman, much like the man who formed a
relationship with Norman's mother.  This subtext is lost by default given
the drastic physical differences between Vaughn and Macy.  Aside from that,
Macy's characterization is right on.</P>
<P>Two of the film's biggest changes are the characterizations of Lila Crane
and Sam Loomis.  Lila Crane was strong in the first "Psycho", but she seemed
to defer to Sam at times.  Julianne Moore's ("Boogie Nights", "The Lost
World") Lila is much stronger here, leading Sam every step of the way.  It's
definitely a 90s interpretation, and given that it fits this film.  Moore's
Lila is very aggressive and assertive.  But my preference is the more
balanced performance by Vera Miles in the original.</P>
<P>Moore's stronger Lila is exemplified best in the film's climactic scene.
Straying from the norm, Van Sant's direction of this scene is drastically
different (and far less effective) than Hitchcock's.  As well as differences
in characterization, great liberties are taken with shot selection and
composition.  There is one shot from the Hitchcock version of this scene
that is imbedded in my mind.  No attempt is made to even come close to
duplicating it.  If Van Sant's goal is to duplicate the original, why does
he veer drastically from one of the film's most crucial scenes?</P>
<P>I greatly enjoyed Viggo Mortenson's ("A Perfect Murder", "Crimson Tide")
take on Sam Loomis, the married man that Marion is having an affair with.
Mortenson's Loomis is a laid back, easy going hick cowboy without much
backbone.  He's not weak, necessarily, but morally indifferent.  John Gavin'
s Loomis seemed to have too much moral character and strength to be a guy
who would cheat on his wife.  With Mortenson, Loomis is exactly the type of
amoral person who would be involved in such an affair.  Mortenson's Loomis
is one of the few examples of where I preferred this "Psycho" over the
original.</P>
<P>The other would be in the character of Dr. Richmond, the psychiatrist who
explains the psychotic motives involved in the killings.  If the original
film had a weakness, it was this scene.  Simon Oakland's psychiatrist was
interpreted completely wrong.  Instead of portraying a doctor who is
examining the delicate psychosis of a disturbed mind, Oakland played it like
an angry police detective or prosecutor detailing the crime.  Emotionally,
Oakland was way off.  I won't expose the identity of the actor who portrays
Dr. Richmond in this new version so that you may discover it for yourself.
But I will say that he delivered one of 1997's top performances.  Given my
immense respect for that performance, I was pleasantly surprised to see him
take on this role that I felt needed much improvement.  This actor delivers
as he takes the softer, more caring approach with Dr. Richmond.  If for no
other reason, Van Sant can possibly justify his recreation in that he
greatly improved this scene.</P>
<P>For all of the missteps and errors that I feel Van Sant made here, I must
credit him for two areas where he changed the original.  These two changes
were elements that Hitchcock wanted to include, but for technological and
cultural reasons was unable to do so.  The first is the opening shot.
Panning across the expanse of Phoenix, Arizona, Van Sant's lengthy take
moves from a wide view of the city and closes in on the window of Marion's
hotel room, traveling through it to reveal Marion and Sam on the bed.  The
shot is continuous and uninterrupted.  This is how Hitchcock wanted to do
it, but was unable to because of technical restrictions.  His slow zoom into
the hotel room was assembled by dissolves, linking the various shots used to
compose this opening sequence.</P>
<P>The other is in the death of Marion.  Originally, Hitchcock wanted to have
an overhead shot of the naked dead Marion draped over the side of the
bathtub, revealing her entire body.  Given that it was a shot of her
backside, Hitchcock believed it is something he could get away with.  The
censors said otherwise.  Van Sant restores that shot to his version,
tastefully lingering on it for only a moment.</P>
<P>The two best elements of this new "Psycho" are the art direction and costume
design.  Although set in 1998, the look of this world is wonderfully retro.
The set pieces favor the late 60s and early 70s, as do the costumes.  But
the colors are modernly pastel, instilling it with a contemporary feel.
Props and clothing have an air of thrift store quality that is fun and
uniquely original.  Credit Tom Foden's production design and Beatrix Aruna
Pasztor's costumes for giving this recreation its most original elements.</P>
<P>I also took great joy in two of the film's more faithful efforts.  First and
foremost is Danny Elfman's loyal re-recording of Bernard Herrmann's
masterful score.  I must admit, a smile came across my face as the film
opened and the theater was filled with Herrmann's eerie composition.  Fifty
percent of the film's impact is found in the music, one that is frightfully
full while only using string instruments.  This is one of the most
recognized and best film scores of all time.  Thankfully, Elfman keeps in
intact.</P>
<P>The other element is that of the mysterious highway patrol officer that
Marion runs into on her way to the Bates motel.  I nearly did a double take
when I saw him.  The guy is a virtual clone of the actor in the 1960
original.  It really captivated me to see this.  I can only imagine the
giddy glee expressed by Van Sant and producer Brian Grazer when they came
across this actor.  It was, perhaps, the film's best element of homage to
the original.</P>
<P>Arguably the worst aspect of this recreation is the use of color.  The black
and white photography was such an integral element in the overall mood and
effect of the original.  The dark shadows and lifeless gray's created a
palpable sense of foreboding evil.  It also allowed Perkins and Leigh to
remain subtle while bringing out the subtext so evident in their eyes.  The
color makes the visuals too busy and distracting.  The imagery doesn't
arrest you as it does in the original, therefore exposing some of the story'
s slow pacing.  The original's black and white images enrapture you as the
compensate for the plot's few tedious moments.</P>
<P>The bottom line may be this: as I watched the new "Psycho" (less than two
hours, just like the 1960 version) it actually seemed to drag.  It didn't
captivate me like the original did.  Conversely, I could watch Hitchcock's
version tomorrow and be completely drawn into it from beginning to end.  It
has a psychological power that is missed in Van Sant's recreation.  If you
do see this new version, my recommendation would be this: watch Hitchcock's
version first, even if you've seen it before.  But if you haven't, then
without question you should see it prior to watching the recreation.  Do not
taint your initial viewing of Hitchcock's masterpiece with this plodding
remake.  Then shortly thereafter, like say within the next day or so, go see
the new one.  I think the greatest enjoyment one could have with Van Sant's
version is to view it comparatively.  Sure, it will most certainly result in
some level of disappointment, but there is something uniquely entertaining
in watching the film from this context.</P>
<P>Finally, let me just say this.  Van Sant, Grazer, Vaughn, Heche and the rest
were in an admittedly no-win situation.  The collective gifts that this
immense talent pool brings would have been better spent on an original
collaboration.  But instead, they are wasted on this doomed venture of
trying to meet expectations that are simply impossible to achieve.  Given
that, I commend them for their courage in tackling this daunting effort.  I
don't doubt their bravery or love for Hitchcock, but it is their wisdom that
I question.</P>
