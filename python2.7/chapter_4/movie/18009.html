<PRE>eXistenZ ***1/2</PRE>
<P>rated R
starring Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jude Law, Willem Dafoe, Ian Holm, Don
McKellar, Callum Keith
Rennie, Sarah Polley, Christopher Eccleston, Willem Dafoe
written and directed by David Cronenberg</P>
<P>I find it a bit ironic that while THE MATRIX is racking in huge
numbers at the box office, David Cronenberg's similar, astonishing
EXISTENZ can't even crack the top 10. But even if EXISTENZ disappears
into obscurity, it is not a film that I will easily forget.</P>
<P>To give away too much of EXISTENZ' plot would be a sin, but I will
provide for you the initial setup. Jennifer Jason Leigh makes her big
screen return, after a 2-year hiatus(does anyone remember A THOUSAND
ACRES? I didn't think so), as Allegra Geller, who, sometime in the
near future, is the world's most distinguished virtual reality game
designer. A group of people have been gathered into a room to test her
newest adventure, called eXistenZ. The meeting turns into chaos, and
Allegra is forced to flee with her bodyguard(Jude Law).</P>
<P>The game of eXistenZ is not the normal virtual reality game that you
would find in stores today. In eXistenZ, you are living the game, and
at times your mind begins to lose grasp on the difference between the
game and reality. THE MATRIX made a similar point in a more
complicated way, that sometimes the lines of reality are
blurred. EXISTENZ ends up playing like an indie version of THE MATRIX
that spends more time on smarts than on violence.</P>
<P>While EXISTENZ is not as showy as THE MATRIX, its ending is much more
thought-provoking.  1999 is turning out to be the year that sci/fi
makes its big return. I am definitely not a sci/fi buff, but with
EXISTENZ and THE MATRIX being released even before the new STAR WARS,
this year looks to be the year of science-fiction.</P>
<P>EXISTENZ not only marks the return of Jennifer Jason Leigh, but it is
also the first film that David Cronenberg has made since 1996's erotic
car crash thriller(?) CRASH. The Canadian filmmaker is known for his
unique visual sense, and his ability to create new worlds.  EXISTENZ
is one of his very best films. Also, Ian Holm and Sarah Polley(both of
THE SWEET HEREAFTER) have small roles, proving that when you put those
two in a movie together, good things happen. EXISTENZ is not a perfect
film, but it will be remembered by me as one of the year's best.</P>
