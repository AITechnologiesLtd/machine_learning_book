<P>On paper, "Mystery, Alaska" looks like a winner. The premise - - an
article about a small town hockey team prompts the New York Rangers to
come calling for an exhibition game - - sounds like fun. The cast
contains a slew of top notch actors, including Russell Crowe
("L.A. Confidential") and Ron Eldard ("Men Behaving Badly"), along
with Mary McCormack, Lolita Davidovich and the always sturdy Burt
Reynolds, supported by reliable character actors Colm Meaney ("Star
Trek: The Next Generation"), Hank Azaria (Apu from "The Simpsons"),
and Maury Chaykin. The film even boasts dandy cameo appearances from
Mike Myers and Little Richard. So why is "Mystery, Alaska" such a
mess?</P>
<PRE>The answer: David E. Kelley.</PRE>
<P>Kelley, who co-wrote the film with Sean O'Byrne, is also the man
behind the inert "Jaws"-with-an-alligator rip-off "Lake Placid," and
the TV series "Picket Fences," "Chicago Hope," "Snoops," "Ally McBeal"
and "The Practice." He was crowned King of Hollywood last month when
"Ally McBeal" and "The Practice" won Emmys for Best Comedy and Best
Drama.</P>
<P>Angered when "The Practice" beat the infinitely superior series, "The
Sopranos," a number of alternative journalists recently declared war
on Kelley, turning out lengthy attacks on the absurdly prolific
writer. For the record, I want to make one thing clear: I disliked
David E. Kelley long before it became trendy.</P>
<P>While Kelley possesses some undeniable gifts, particularly the ability
to convincingly present both sides of an argument, he is essentially a
stunt writer. He takes characters and situations straight out of "The
Jerry Springer Show," removes the trailer park accents and presents
the resultant bathos as cutting edge television. He clutters his shows
with snarky interpersonal conflicts, and delights in presenting
overblown speeches, preferably in a courtroom setting (during "Lake
Placid," I half-expected to see the alligator hauled in front of a
judge).</P>
<P>Virtually all of Kelley's worst tendencies run unchecked in "Mystery,
Alaska." For most of the film, the hockey story is smothered beneath
relationship blathering and a stream of hammy speeches (and, yes,
there is a courtroom scene). Eventually, the main story kicks in,
building to a finale that tries to be a frost-bitten "Hoosiers."</P>
<P>The production even includes one of the most annoying movie
clichés, the "Rudy" clap. It goes like this. In a dramatic
situation where real humans would immediately break into thunderous
applause, the "Rudy" clap attempts to stir audience emotions by having
one character slowly begin applauding. Gradually, his handclaps grow
faster and faster as others join in and the whole thing builds to a
full-fledged ovation. On my irritation-meter, the "Rudy" clap lands
somewhere between calls from telemarketers and performances by Carrot
Top.</P>
<P>The story starts off well, with the weekly hockey game that has long
been a tradition in the tiny burg of Mystery. The game is entertaining
and the players are an enjoyable lot. But then the avalanche of
subplots begins. An early draft of this review included two paragraphs
packed with subplot descriptions, but I'll spare you the details.</P>
<P>While the 90 minutes that precede the big game are mostly tedious,
there are some nice moments. Ron Eldard is enjoyable as the village
Lothario. A sex scene between two randy teens provides big laughs, as
does the bit where a player is punished by being pushed into a snow
bank while wearing only a jock strap. But most of the fun occurs
during the final half-hour, as little Mystery tries to keep their
dignity in the midst of the media circus surrounding the exhibition
game. Mike Myers draws smiles as a smarmy color commentator and Mayor
Pitcher conspires with Little Richard to turn a rendition of the
National anthem into a tactical advantage for the team.</P>
<P>But oh, do you have to pay for those good parts. I suggest you wait
until "Mystery, Alaska" hits cable. Then you can settle back and enjoy
the minor pleasures of this trifle while reading a good book during
the dull sections. Come to think of it, that's what I do on those rare
occasions when I watch one of David E. Kelley's TV shows.</P>
