<P>You would think that a movie about David Berkowitz, the Son of Sam
killer, would be fascinating.  Well, it might be.  I don't know, because
Summer of Sam isn't that movie.  Replacing what could have been an
interesting story is a hodgepodge of dull characters played by even
duller actors with occasionally interesting photography and an
irritating score.  They say there are eight million stories in the naked
city, and they sure picked the dumbest one to tell.</P>
<P>The film opens and closes with a Jimmy Breslin narrative.  He's the guy
that Berkowitz wrote letters to during his killing spree in the dog days
of 1977.  That summer also featured scorching temperatures, a blackout
(and looting attendant thereto), the Yankees' run for the pennant, the
emergence of Studio 54 and the birth of the punk scene.  Director Spike
Lee (He Got Game), who co-wrote the script with first-timers Victor
Colicchio and Michael Imperioli (Christopher from The Sopranos), crams
so many plotlines and characters into the film that you could literally
nod off, wake up, and think that a completely different film was playing
(I didn't fall asleep, but really wish that I had).</P>
<P>Loosely held together by the killings are the stories of:</P>
<P>   * Sex-crazed Vinny (John Leguizamo, Spawn) and straight-laced Dionna
     (Mira Sorvino, At First Sight), a young couple plagued by
     hairdresser Vinny's infidelity and penchant for looking and acting
     like a Tony Manero (Saturday Night Fever) wannabe.  When he isn't
     trolling for tail, Vinny hangs out with…
   * Joe T. (Michael Rispoli) and his Goomba gang of posturing failures
     that think that the .44 killer could be…
   * Ritchie (Adrien Brody, The Thin Red Line), a burgeoning fan of the
     British punk scene (complete with bad English accent) who is forced
     to live in the garage after walking in on his mom and step-father
     in the midst of a raucous shag-fest.  Ritchie secretly works in a
     gay club, shoots porn and eventually starts the band Late Term
     Abortion with his girlfriend…
   * Ruby (Jennifer Esposito, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer), a
     vivacious neighborhood girl who shuns her Italian roots to be with
     the outcast Ritchie.  She ignores the fact that her boyfriend is on
     the short list of potential killers composed by…
   * Luigi (Ben Gazzara, Happiness), the king of the community, who
     organizes a blackout party and arms the citizens with baseball bats
     to keep the looters out of his neighborhood.  Luigi was apparently
     somewhat of a father figure to…
   * Detective Lou Petrocelli (Anthony LaPaglia, Lansky) who, together
     with Detective Curt Atwater (Roger Guenveur Smith), haplessly
     stagger in and out of the film in an attempt to catch the killer…
   * David Berkowitz (Michael Badalucco, The Practice), a crazy guy who
     looks like he lives in a Nine Inch Nails video and is driven off
     the deep end by…
   * His neighbor's dog (voiced by John Turturro) who will give hophead
     viewers something to piss their shorts over.</P>
<P>The film has occasional moments of visual brilliance, and viewers can
almost smell the stench of the rancid New York streets, thanks to
cinematographer Ellen Kuras' (The Mod Squad) rich photography.  Sam's
ending transforms the capture of Berkowitz into the fervor of a huge
rock concert.  But that's been done before (and better, in Natural Born
Killers).  And why is Berkowitz only shown sporadically through the
film?  Why don't we see what makes him tick?  For some reason, Lee
doesn't even show his face when he offs his victims.  Speaking of
victims, viewers will wish that each one of these horrible people in the
film would be a casualty.  And some will even wish that they were murder
victims as well.  And don't get me started on the extended orgy scene or
the two music videos that are roughly inserted into the film.  Lee is a
talented filmmaker, but only when he has a good script (read: not one of
his own).</P>
<P>There are precious few funny scenes (other than the talking dog), like
when Joe T. and gang go to a Late Term Abortion show at seminal punk
club CBGB, dressed like goodfellas, to question Ritchie about the
murders.  They walk out of the club saying that they could take ten
showers and still not rid themselves of the bar's fetor.  You could say
the same thing about Summer of Sam as you walk out of the theater.
(2:22 - R for strong graphic violence and sexuality, pervasive strong
language and drug use)</P>
