<P>"Metteur-en-scene, director. The point is not to direct someone but to
direct oneself."
-Robert Bresson, Notes on the Cinematographer</P>
<P>There seems to be a general disaster zone that the majority of
actors-turned-directors wander into. It is to actually try to direct
the film (usually according to some miniscule fraction of theory or
method that they have recently misunderstood.) A number of examples
come to mind of which, Buscemi citing Cassavetes and Hanks naming
Kurosawa, Kubrick and Eisenstein in the same breath are only the most
notorious examples. Anyone who saw, Trees Lounge or That Thing You Do
knows that despite their differences the films share an alarming
capacity for self-delusion. Flawed assumptions, heavy-handed
referencing and all around awkward articulations are the hallmarks of
such films which, incidentally, are not without a lot of company. Gary
Oldman's latest film Nil by Mouth, avoids such pitfalls by recognising
the number one job of the actor-director: to marshall their unique
talents (knowledge of performance and interpretation) in a coherent
effort. No flashy loud camera work (Albino Alligator), no overpriced
contrived production values (Braveheart) and no heavy handed ludicrous
symbolism (Dead Man Walking). Gary Oldman, like accomplished
actor-directors before him (epitomised by the late John Cassavetes,
and not unlike the more recent efforts of Sean Penn) makes a number of
very specific directorial decisions guided by what he believes the
crux of cinematic representation to be. Just as Errol Morris who
studied Philosophy, or Antonionni who studied Political Economy,
employ directorial methods that privelege their given expertise.  In
the case of the actor-director this expertise is clear, and it is
often insecutrity about acknowledging such limits that lead
actor-directors astray. Oldman has reminded us that when such errors
are not made the results are complex and astounding films.</P>
<P>    Nil by Mouth chronicles the dynamic between a lower-class London
family (This is all you really need to know). Oldman wisely, keeps the
plotting down to a minimum concentrating instead on accurately
rendering the complexity of the characters and their
relationships. For much of this he defers to the actors (all of whom
play superbly) by the specific camera decisions he makes. Throughout
the film, Oldman's camera is never in the wrong place but more
importantly the scale of the shots is perfect.  Vitrually the entire
film is shot in close and medium shots through long lenses that truly
crush the depth of field. There is also inly a very selective use of
two-shots and group shots in the film. To call the result
clasutrophobic and uncomfortable is a gross understatement. The
implications of this technique for the narrative are manifold: it
alludes to the enclosed world of the characters as well as
establishing a number of key associations between these
characters. This gives them a first layer to work with. More
importantly, howver, the longer lenses, necessarily allowed Oldman to
move away from the actors freeing up their physical space despite the
very particular diegetic space (oweing to the reduced depth of field.)
It is a technique not unlike the one Cassavets uses in A Woman Under
the Influence. The result of these decisions is apparent in the job
the actors do which I'v already said is excellent. Oldman could have
chosen any number of avenues by which to shoot these people, all of
which would have left a flawed product that udermined the strength of
the performances. Although, I don't think every film should be made
this way, when it is an actor at the helm, the technique truly seems
perfect.</P>
<P>    Over and above these stylistic elements the narrative of Nil by
Mouth is extremely assured. With a running time of just over two
hours, Oldman clearly had no doubts about the events to be included in
the portrayal. The film is apparently based on autobiographical
events, which shows in the film's authenticity.  The plotting is kept
to a minimum but this does not mean the film was not carefully
scripted. There are a number of crucial speeches, which are placed at
specifc times in the film for specific reasons. In a number of cases
Oldman foregoes dramtatic efficiency in order to convey a mood uf
unese and discomfort. The prominence of the unique South Londin accent
is only the ost prominent example of this. The characters seem
incapable of not talking, as if constantly nervous and hiding
something. Even towards the end of the film, in a lengthy scene of Ray
left to his own devices this tendency does not stop.  The scene is
deftly edited as to have Ray almost talking with or at (not to)
himself. This underscores some of the ambiguity with which the Ray
husband is treated. Such a treatment is genuine in a way that a film
like Bastard from Carolina could not hope to be.</P>
<P>    I am not sure if Oldman intends to direct other projects or if
this was a one time effort to exorcise a number of demons that the
actor has harboured. One source (I can't remeber who) has said that
Oldman was offended by the apparent glamourising of street and drug
culture in Trainspotting and thus finally decided to commit his idea
to celluloid. The accusation is a common one that I think is unfair
but we can be thankful that Oldman chose to respond in the manner that
he did. We can only hope more actors show such poise in their future
directing efforts..</P>
