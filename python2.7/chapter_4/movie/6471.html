<P>     In 1979, when Margaret Thatcher assumed the role of England's Prime 
Minister, one of her stated aims was to crush the IRA and its associated 
"terrorism."  Her "Northern Ireland Solution", as it became known, 
included three principles:  Isolation, Criminalization, and 
Demoralization.  Those members of the IRA captured for terrorist acts 
were to be treated as criminals, not soldiers.  Prisons were to be used 
to break morale, not create martyrs.</P>
<P>     On March 1, 1981, IRA prisoner Bobby Sands began a hunger strike 
which would earn him world-wide notoriety.  Sands laid out five demands 
that, if met by the British government, would end the strike.  Chief 
among these was the requirement that imprisoned IRA members would be 
recognized as "prisoners of war" (not common criminals), and, as such, 
would be allowed to wear their own clothing (instead of prison 
uniforms).  Thatcher's government refused to negotiate, even when, on 
April 9, Sands was elected as the Member of Parliament from Fermanagh 
and South Tyrone.  66 days after it began, Sands' protest ended with his 
death.  Others followed his example, and, by the time the strike ended 
on October 3, ten of the more than 300 IRA prisoners in Long Kesh 
prison's H-Blocks had perished.  </P>
<P>     The story of Sands' hunger strike forms the background of Terry 
George's directorial debut, SOME MOTHER'S SON.  However, while there is 
a great deal of information in the film about Sinn Fein, the IRA, and 
the political situation in Ireland during the early 1980s (some of which 
is fictionalized), this is principally a tale of sacrifice and family 
relationships.  It's about a mother being forced to confront the very 
real fear that her son may die for convictions that she does not share, 
and that it could ultimately be her responsibility to choose life or 
death for him.</P>
<P>     The character of Gerard Quigley (Aidan Gillen) does not, nor ever 
did, exist, but George, along with co-writer Jim Sheridan (IN THE NAME 
OF THE FATHER), uses him as a focal point for SOME MOTHER'S SON's 
narrative.  He is typical of young IRA members:  firm in his beliefs, 
staunch in his hatred of the British, and willing to die for his 
convictions.  He looks upon Bobby Sands (played by John Lynch) as a 
Messiah-like figure, and is willing to follow him to the grave.  </P>
<P>     The real star of the film, however, is Helen Mirren, who gives a 
stirring performance as Gerard's torn mother, Kathleen.  A widowed 
schoolteacher trying to raise a family of three, Kathleen despises the 
violent tactics employed by the IRA, and is shocked to learn that her 
oldest son is a member of the organization.  SOME MOTHER'S SON explores 
Kathleen's difficulties in coming to terms with Gerard's beliefs.  And, 
although she refuses to be "a stooge for violence", Kathleen fights for 
her son with every ounce of strength, effectively helping the IRA.  From 
her perspective, she walks a precarious moral tightrope.  Once the 
hunger strikes begin, Kathleen recognizes that an agonizing dilemma 
awaits.  If Gerard loses consciousness, it will be up to her (as his 
next-of-kin) to decide whether or not he is given food.  If she agrees 
to have him fed intravenously, she violates his convictions.  On the 
other hand, in the words of a British official, "Surely no mother would 
allow her son to die."</P>
<P>     Mirren is given fine support by Fionnula Flanagan, who plays Annie 
Higgins, the mother of hunger striker Frank Higgins (David O'Hara).  
Unlike Kathleen, Annie is pro-IRA, but, despite their differing 
political views, the two become close compatriots through the shared 
bond of their sons' ordeals.  Ciaran Hinds (last seen as the dashing 
Captain Wentworth in PERSUASION) plays Sinn Fein spokesman Danny Boyle 
(presumably a fictional representation of Gerry Adams).</P>
<P>     Production values in SOME MOTHER'S SON are top-notch.  There is a 
real sense of time and place, from the close, claustrophobic insides of 
Long Kesh prison to the streets of nearby Belfast.  Cinematographer 
Geoffrey Simpson (SHINE) manages the difficult task of capturing the 
film's personal moments as effectively as the more epic ones (such as 
the funeral procession for Bobby Sands, which drew 100,000 mourners).  
Bill Whelan's forceful, energetic score is one of the best of the year.</P>
<P>     Make no mistake:  while the core story of SOME MOTHER'S SON is 
universal in theme and deeply personal in scope, the narrative 
nevertheless shows evidence of a pro-Republican bias.  Although the 
movie is arguably more balanced than Sheridan's powerful and riveting IN 
THE NAME OF THE FATHER, the British still come off as faceless villains.  
Margaret Thatcher's mouthpiece is a caricature of vicious, heartless 
cliches.  For those with an interest in the ongoing conflict in Northern 
Ireland, SOME MOTHER'S SON makes an excellent companion piece to Neil 
Jordan's MICHAEL COLLINS.  But, regardless of your political leanings, 
Terry George's picture is well worth seeing because of its intelligence 
and emotional depth, not to mention Helen Mirren's Oscar-caliber 
performance.</P>
