<P>I have always thought that this film was much more of a statement about the
over rated films that the Hollywood and English factories were making at the
time, but in all cases, were sacrificing the stories for the romantic and
film appeal. Luis Bunuel, although obviously appreciating the famous Emily
Bronte novel, however, also saw it as another chance for him to work on one
of his favorite themes... contradictions, and love/hate relationships. He
had several of those in his Mexican exile, and although
disguised as comedies, they never got the attention of very many other
countries and film reviewers, because Hollywood, and the richer factories
controlled the market.</P>
<P>ABISMOS DE PASSION, badly titled for English release as "Wuthering Heights",
is exactly what its title discusses... an abyss for passions, and in this
case totaly misguided and obsessive passions, in all directions. Of course,
the original novel did have some terrible dysfunctional bits and pieces. But
this film has nightmares for disfunctions. And that aside, the story is
pretty much the same, with the same conclusion -- well sort of.</P>
<P>And the ill fated love story that can never happen, comes about. Catalina
marries for property and money, not for love. Her husband is a bit of a
nothing. Her husband's younger sister, is impulsive and not altogether in
one piece, and to get even with her brother decides that she also wants a
piece of Alejandro, which makes things even more complicated.</P>
<P>And when he comes back to take the neighboring farm from his own brother, a
drunkard, just so he can be nearer Catalina, the die is cast for what is
obviously going to be an emotional nightmare.</P>
<P>And like Hollywood, and the English versions of this film, it does things
with a massive flair.... loud music, long shots, romantic scenes, and in
between the total mayhem. I tend to think that this was Luis Bunuel's
statement that he could also make a shitty Hollywood film, for the "public",
which he always thought was a ridiculous concept anyway. And in these
moments, one can find almost copies of many moments taken from the Olivier
film ( with Merle Oberon -- the worst Catherine of all time, although the
prettiest ), and so many other romantic films. Spain can also do this, might
have been the real story, not just Hollywood.</P>
<P>The film starts by saying that it is a faithful adaptation of the Emily
Bronte novel, and it really is in many ways, despite its obviously pointed
changes to aid the flow and complications in the film. Were it not the
famous Bronte novel, this one might have been the better of the stories, as
it has more elements of tragedy and chaos that the other story. The novel is
more concerned with the ill fated love affair. This story is more concerned
with everyone else involved in the whole thing, not just the two ill fated
lovers. At stake are the younger sister who marries Alejandro to get even
with her brother, and Alejandro's drunken brother, who spends his time
beating up his own son... the dysfunctionality is totaly visible, whereas in
the novel it is hidden in the English "society" of the day... makes the
lovers feel like "victims". IN this version, they are not victims, in that
they create their own hell, because of their impulsive and obsessive
natures.</P>
<PRE>And they all share this quality.</PRE>
<P>All in all, the acting in this film is actually very good. The film creates
some serious acting moments that are indeed difficult at any stage, and
these tend to force actors to get tight and better. And here they are
better. They are not showy and lit for romantic appeal.... they just are,
like you and I might be. In this sense alone, this film is far superior to
the better known Olivier vehicle. I suppose that a modern film maker would
make a film interpretation that Heathcliff either has aids, or is gay.... a
modern twist.
Intellectually, this is a very nice film. For audiences searching for a
Hollywood excitement film, this is trash of the Ed Wood variety. Sadly so.
It's just a shame that this film, and Bunuel's own Robinson Crusoe are not
given a better look. Both of these films stand out, not because of the
usually surrealistic nature of this film maker, but in this case, because of
his ability to create excellent stories and tie them up in a literary way,
that even Emily Bronte could not.</P>
<P>Very good film, although it shows some age. Could use some restoring to save
it along with so many other films by this master.</P>
