FRANKENSTEIN (1993)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>For some literary scholars, FRANKENSTEIN, 1818 novel by Mary
Shelley, happens to be the very first piece of fiction
within the realms of science fiction genre. However, most of
the movie adaptations of the novel are associated more with
the genre of horror, thanks to Ken Whale's 1931 version,
unsurpassed until this very day. The other adaptations,
although some of them good, paled in comparison. It wasn't
much different in 1990s, which was rather bad decade for
movies dealing with Frankenstein monster. After
disappointing FRANKENSTEIN UNBOUND in 1990, we got equally
disappointing Kenneth Branagh's version in 1994. In the wake
of latter, Turner Pictures tried to cash in on the
renaissance of classic horrors, inspired by Coppola's
version of DRACULA. Result is rather forgettable and equally
disappointing television production, despite being more
faithful to the novel than most of other versions.</P>
<P>Movie begins when Swiss medical scholar dr. Victor
Frankenstein (played by Patrick Bergin) develops a method to
artificially create human being out of dead matter. The
result of his experiment is a disfigured by physically
superior monster (Randy Quaid). Creature escapes to
countryside only to find that the humanity hates it. Angry
at his maker, the monster kills his bride Elisabeth. Dr.
Frankenstein is now determined to track down and kill
monster, but soon he realises that he had developed a
psychic link with it.</P>
<P>The screenplay by director David Wickes employs somewhat new
(or unused) elements of the plot - materialisation instead
of patching up body parts, psychic link. However, those
elements aren't enough to drive off unpleasant effect of
deja vu for many viewers. And Wickes' unispiring directing
doesn't help at all. Actors are also disinterested, and
Randy Quaid as monster is quite unconvincing. The result is
failed film that looks like a cheap exploitation of great
literary and movie classics.</P>
