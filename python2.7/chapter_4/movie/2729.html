<PRE>SYNOPSIS</PRE>
<P>     Following the death of her parents in a natural disaster in India
ten year old Mary Lennox (Kate Maberly), newly orphaned, is returned to
the United Kingdom by the colonial authorities.  Her next of kin is a
wealthy uncle, Lord Craven (John Lynch) and she comes to live in his
mansion set in deep the British countryside.</P>
<P>     Arriving at the peak of winter, the huge largely derelict house
stands amongst desolate fog laden moors, in an atmosphere of pervading
despair.  The household live seemingly under a curse, blighted by the
death of Lord Craven's wife during childbirth ten years earlier.</P>
<P>     Undaunted by her surroundings, however, Mary explores the derelict
labyrinth of, she is told, at least one hundred rooms; as well as the
extensive grounds and fallow gardens which surround it.  She discovers
her aunt's favorite garden, sealed off since her death.  She also comes
across a cousin she never knew she had, Colin Craven (Heydon Prowse),
estranged from his father, Lord Craven, all his life due to the tragic
circumstances of Colin's birth.  Colin is an invalid who has lived all
his days confined to bed, destined it appears, never to see the light
of day.</P>
<P>     The film depicts Mary's liberation of herself, and her uncle and
cousin, from the smothering burdens of their shared and individual
pasts.</P>
<PRE>COMMENTS</PRE>
<P>     A tale for children and for those who remain, as they say, forever
"children at heart".</P>
<P>     The plot contains all the elements one would expect of a
childrens' story set in Victorian times: orphaned aristocratic
children; a tyrannical housekeeper (Maggie Smith); mysterious, hidden
places where seeds of, figuratively, magical rejuvenation are
eventually to be found.  As with all good (children's) stories several
key existential challenges must be faced and overcome:</P>
<P>*   The catastrophic abandonment of parental death.  </P>
<PRE>*   The fear of the new and unknown. </PRE>
<P>*   Mistreatment and neglect by supposed guardians.</P>
<P>     I must say I was surprised that, apart from a little long distance
telepathy, there was no recourse to magic (nor appeal to any other
supernatural agencies for that matter) to bring about the resolution to
bitter realities.  The (s)hero (Mary) survives and rescues those around
her by drawing upon the indomitable resilience of the human spirit; and
its eternal capacity for redemption from despair and for triumphing
over the destructive consequences of death.</P>
<PRE>    All in all, a fine and enchanting piece of cinema.</PRE>
<PRE>   "If you look at it a certain way, all the world is a garden"
