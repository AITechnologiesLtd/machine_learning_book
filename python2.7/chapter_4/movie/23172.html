<P>Ahh yes. The teenage romance.  An attractive young cast is pitted into
an unlikely scenario that could only happen in the movies, and in the
end, the guy always gets the girl. And with the arrival of the breakout
hit `She's All That' last year (followed by a long catalogue of
imitators including `10 Things I Hate About You' and `Drive Me Crazy'),
the genre previously on life support is once again a hot commodity.
Along now comes `Down to You'. The folks at Miramax are obviously trying
to capitalize on the rabid `She's All That' craze with their latest
project, which has the studdly Freddie Prinze Jr. attached and all. Only
`Down to You' doesn't have the ‘unlikely scenario' mentioned above. It
is an extraordinarily ordinary romance - a dull, unattractive teen
comedy that sticks to the boring game plan that we're accustomed to.</P>
<P>This is the kind of romance that only giggly 12-year old girls will find
convincing. In strictly textbook fashion, college sophomore and aspiring
chef Al (Prinze Jr.) meets freshman artist Imogen (Julia Stiles). They
hit it off like a couple can only in the movies. From here, it's the
standard boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl,
boy-drinks-entire-bottle-of-shampoo-and-may-or-may-not-get-girl-back
story. The plot is conveniently assembled to suit the requirements of
the main characters, who are frequently taking part in activities
that.... well, only happen in the movies.</P>
<P>Fortunately, the cast of `Down to You' has a certain appeal. Freddie
Prinze Jr. and Julia Stiles are an adorable couple, and when on screen
together, they radiate the sort of warmth and charisma that the movie
should have centered around. Zak Orth, as the newly realized porn star
Monk, shows an unmistakable flair with handling all of the film's
intelligent dialogue. Rounding out the impressive ensemble of young
talent are Shawn Hatosy (`The Faculty'), Selma Blair (`Cruel
Intentions') and Ashton Kutcher (TV's `That 70's Shows'). Even The Fonz
himself - Henry Winkler, the epitome of teenage angst and nostalgia -
has a welcome role as Al's dad, the host of the popular cooking program
`Chef Ray'. Maybe the concept of `Down to You' looked good on paper to
draw such a crowd. As a feature film, however, the finished product is
bland and tasteless fluff with only an occasional whiff of cuteness to
keep the gears from stopping entirely.</P>
<P>Perhaps worst of all, `Down to You' is not funny. The jokes are drawn
from obvious sources and the resulting humor is banal and uninspired.
The characters on screen, often laughing at each other's
goofy/embarrassing antics, seemed far more amused than the audience.
Even the giggly 12-year old girls had grown restless toward the end as
they waited impatiently for the formula to run it's course. The one
mildly clever segment featured Winkler and Prinze Jr. in a fantasy
sequence called `Cooks', a `COPS' take-off in which the father and son
would storm houses and cook a decent meal for ‘needy' families (with the
assistance of a fully-armed SWAT team, of course). When this is the
highlight reel, you know the remaining film could leave something to be
desired.</P>
<P>In order to make a teen comedy work, you've got to have characters that
show something by way of depth and identity. `10 Things I Hate About
You' actually featured characters who were more than walking flashcards,
and the result was refreshing. No such luck with `Down to You'. It's
just a textbook romance where, despite absurd circumstances, everything
is bound to work out in the end. And at the end of the whole clichéd
ordeal, the nicest thing you could possibly say would be `.... only in
the movies'.</P>
