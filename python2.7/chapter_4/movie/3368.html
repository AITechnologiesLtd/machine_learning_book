<PRE>                             WINDOW TO PARIS
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1995 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>* 1/2</PRE>
<P>     WINDOW TO PARIS is a fantasy and a comedy set in St. Petersburg
(Leningrad to you hard-line Bolsheviks).  It starts in present-day
Russia and the point is made early and often that the present
conditions are the same miserable conditions as under the Communist
regime.  The boulevards and the alleyways are a cross between medieval
Europe and the sets from Blade Runner.</P>
<P>     The hero of the tale, played by Serguei Dontsov, is literally a
pied piper of a music teacher at the local school.  His fellow teachers
hate him because he is not more of a capitalist like them.  He objects
for example when they fill his classroom with boxes of computer
equipment that they have gotten a good deal on.  We have many lines
about how the disks hold 120MB.  His second job is tuning pianos and to
do that he carries a wrench type instrument that looks like a gun.</P>
<P>     He moves into an apartment where an old woman died.  He makes
instant friends with everyone in the apartment complex since they are
major alcoholics and love to have more people to drink with.  They
spend the evenings getting filthy drunk.  Although he is slim, tall,
and sort of handsome, his friends have beer bellies the size of small
whales and they are crude and unkempt.  The wives look just like the
husbands.</P>
<P>     After a night of heavy drinking, they discover their window to
Paris, and the fairy tale begins.  Our hero meets a pretty French girl
played by Agnes Soral.  Most of the movie happens in Paris with
periodic sojourns back to St. Petersburg.</P>
<P>     The movie is funny at the level of watching a local amateur
theater group.  The scenes of our hero as a pied piper were my
favorites.  The movie has a fun ending in the spirit of the rest of the
film.  Actually, the comedy was too slow and crude to keep my interest
most of the time.  What I found fascinating was how depressingly awful
the portrayal of modern day Russia was.</P>
<P>     Although there was nothing outstandingly good about the movie,
there was one negative standout--the camerawork.  In Camcorder 101
class we learn to go easy on zooms or your audience will hate you.
Worst of all are lots of very fast zoom outs to a wide-angle.  The
camera operator had clearly never been to any class.</P>
<P>     WINDOW TO PARIS runs about right at 1:31.  It is in Russian and
French with English subtitles.  The movie is rated PG-13 for a one
second nude scene and for some profanity.  It would be fine for any kid
over 10.  I do not recommend the show although it does have several
nice moments, and I award it * 1/2.</P>
<P><HR>____
**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</P>
