<PRE>                                    HEAT
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        I saw this movie in a theater on Christmas day. I wouldn't 
recommend it, not only because movie theaters are filled on Christmas 
with all the losers and lonely people with nowhere else to go (myself 
not included, of course), but also because when it comes to peace on 
earth and good will toward men, HEAT is left out in the cold. It's a 
dark, gritty movie where people are shot point blank with machine 
guns for talking. If only the ushers would do that to noisy theater 
patrons...</P>
<P>        Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro star as polar opposites, Pacino 
the cop and DeNiro the criminal plotting to knock over a bank. The 
two are definite enemies but still have an intriguing sense of politeness 
toward each other, knowing they could have been good friends had 
circumstances been different. Both know and accept the fact that one 
will be triumphant over the other. In one of their few scenes together, 
Pacino pulls DeNiro over on the highway, only to ask him if he wants 
to have a cup of coffee with him. Certainly an unusual relationship 
those two have with each other. When's the last time you saw Batman 
and The Joker eating a plate of nachos together?</P>
<P>        HEAT combines the main story of DeNiro planning his big 
score and Pacino planning to stop him once he figures out what the big 
score is (an important first obstacle to overcome) with other subplots. 
Pacino's wife resents his preference of his work to her, his 
stepdaughter (Natalie Portman from THE PROFESSIONAL, who 
doesn't have any embarrassing Madonna numbers to sing this time) 
wants and tries to kill herself and DeNiro's henchman, Val "Batman" 
Kilmer (when's the last time you saw him sharing a plate of nachos 
with The Joker?), has a wife on the verge of leaving him.</P>
<P>        It's a depressing, pessimistic movie, to say the least, but a 
compelling one. Especially interesting is the plotline that has DeNiro 
meeting and falling in love with a woman. At first I thought his 
flirtation was an act so he could beat her to death with a crowbar once 
he got her alone, but it turns out some criminals can experience true 
love. (Donald Trump's been married twice.) His love for her causes 
complications a little later on, when choices are to be made.</P>
<P>        HEAT is three hours long, at least twenty minutes longer than 
it should be, but you need that length to tell the full story, I guess. 
Even with the lengthy storytelling throughout the movie, the final 
scene between DeNiro and Pacino is over way too soon. And by the 
end, there are still a few unresolved plot points. It's a good movie but it 
could be better, and briefer. A word of advice--don't see it on 
Christmas day.</P>
