<PRE>                            MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE
                        A movie review by Joe Barlow
                            (c) Copyright 1999</PRE>
<PRE>STARRING:  Kevin Costner, Robin Wright Penn, Paul Newman,
                Jesse James, Illeana Douglas, Robbie Coltrane
DIRECTOR:  Luis Mandoki
WRITER:    Gerald Di Pego (based on the novel by Nicholas
                Sparks)
RATED:     PG-13
RELEASED:  1999</PRE>
<PRE>                  RATING: * 1/2  (out of a possible ****)</PRE>
<P>        Robin Wright Penn seems to be pining for Helen of Troy's job
recently.  In "Forrest Gump" she played Jenny, the drug addict that
Forrest names his shrimp boat after.  In her newest film, "Message in
a Bottle," she is the inspiration that prompts a man who thought he'd
never know love again to rediscover his passions for both the ocean
and boat building.  With these two roles, Wright Penn becomes the face
who launched... well, two cinematic ships.</P>
<P>        She also gives a performance that's one of the few genuine
pleasures in the movie, which never really seems sure of its bearings.
It missteps badly and frequently, giving us one interesting set-up
after another then cheerfully relegating them to the background any
time the film threatens to get too interesting.  I can picture the
screenwriter sitting at his desk, ticking off items from his mental
checklist as he worked on the final draft: Have I included a fist-
fight?  Check.  A sex scene?  Got it.  The mandatory conflict, in
which one of our protagonists rejects the other's affections for
no particular reason?  Yep.  A death whose only purpose is to
generate involuntary weeping from the audience?  Most definitely!</P>
<P>        Theresa Osbourne (Wright Penn) is a journalist for the Chicago
Tribune, a hard worker, but longing for love in the wake of an
unpleasant divorce.  While vacationing at the beach, she comes across
a glass bottle partially buried in the sand.  Inside is a love letter
so elegantly written that she burns afire with questions about the
unknown author.  "Dear Catherine," the note begins; as Theresa
continues
to read, she learns of a heartbroken lover who has lost his wife and
can find no purpose in his existence without her.  Theresa is haunted
by the writer's story, and upon her return to Chicago she shares the
letter with her co-workers at the Tribune.</P>
<P>        Charlie (Robbie Coltrane), the editor of the paper, decides to
run the letter as a human-interest story ("This is bigger than the
low-fat muffin scandal!").  Much to everyone's surprise, the Tribune
is soon flooded with reports of other letters seemingly written by the
same author.  Theresa puts the pieces together and eventually
identifies
the heartsick writer as Garret Blake (Kevin Costner), a widower who
resides in North Carolina's Outer Banks.  Deciding she has to meet
this
poetic man, Theresa pays him a visit.  No points for guessing that a
romantic relationship blossoms between them.</P>
<P>        And that, in a nutshell, is the biggest problem with "Message
in a Bottle"; there are no points for guessing *anything*.  This is
strictly formula filmmaking, never deviating from the tried-and-true
methods which have graced romance movies for decades.  Why, for
example, does Theresa not reveal to Garret that she knows about the
letters he wrote to Catherine?  Because otherwise there could be no
scene in which Garret discovers the truth for himself.  We'd miss out
on the requisite teary argument in which Garret tells Theresa how hurt
he feels over being deceived, and we wouldn't get to see him walk out
on her, a crisis that's necessary so the couple can get back together
in the final act.  You all know the drill.</P>
<P>        A bit of advice for the filmmakers: if you are fortunate
enough
to have Paul Newman in your movie, don't waste him.  Newman plays
Dodge Blake, Garret's cantankerous father, who projects a personality
of grit and nails but has a wise heart underneath.  Newman is in fine
form here, imbuing his character with humorous mannerisms and the
fortune-cookie wisdom that all cinematic dads instinctively possess.
He's far more interesting than Garret (a subplot involving Dodge's
possible alcoholism is never developed as fully as it deserves to be),
and that's part of the trouble: Dodge is such a joy to watch that the
movie plods when he's not on the screen.</P>
<P>        The film has a moment about fifteen minutes from the finale
which would be a perfect place to end this tale; it seemed like such
an obvious stopping point that I actually reached for my coat.  But
no,
the story has an unnecessary quarter-hour tacked on after it, which
only serves to capsize the preceding 120 minutes and render them
completely invalid.  It's one of the worst endings I have ever seen,
because it serves no purpose other than to provide a cheap (and
emotionally manipulative) effect.  "Patch Adams" fans will love it.</P>
<P>        "Message in a Bottle" is all over the map.  The film makes
much of the fact that both of the characters are searching for someone
to be their emotional compass; their "true north," so to speak.
Unfortunately, the movie needs its own sense of direction.  As it
stands, we have a classic case of the blind leading the bland.</P>
