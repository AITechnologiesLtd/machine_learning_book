<PRE>                                 UNFORGIVEN
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1992 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  A film to debunk most of the myths in
     other Western gunfighter films.  Perhaps Eastwood made
     UNFORGIVEN as an act of contrition for glorifying violence in
     so many of his previous pictures.  In any case, this is a
     very adult and intelligent Western about myth and reality.
     Rating: high +2 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<PRE>     "This is the West.  When the legend becomes a fact, print the
     legend."
                         Newspaper reporter in THE MAN WHO SHOT
                         LIBERTY VALENCE</PRE>
<P>     I understand that the Marlboro Man died recently.  For years he
represented the spirit of the Old West with a tattooed hand holding a pack
of Marlboros while he sat around the campfire or rode a magnificent horse
through snowy prairies.  The cause of his death, in wonderful irony if not
total coincidence, was lung cancer.  He spent the last part of his life
doing public service messages to warn people against smoking.  The myth of
the macho smoker and the reality were, in his case, very different.  He
lived off the myth, but at some point he realized the myth was dangerous and
wanted people to know the reality.</P>
<P>     I picture Clint Eastwood as having gone through a similar moral crisis.
He was the Man with No Name who could kill men by reflex.  He was Dirty
Harry, who made his day by gunning down punks. Eastwood made his living by
that image.  Perhaps there are even kids in urban high schools and even
junior highs who have patterned their own gun skills on Eastwood's.  Perhaps
that was a  concern of Eastwood's; perhaps not.  But he certainly has made a
film about the myth and reality of gun fighting.  Saul Rubinek plays a small
but very central role as W. W. Beauchamp, who follows around the great
gunfighters and writes dime novels that glamorize the life of the gun.  He
turns the dirty, disgusting, demeaning profession of killing into exciting
and completely inaccurate accounts for avid readers.  UNFORGIVEN is a story
of gunfighting as it really was--and it was a little less romantic than
killing chickens for a living.  Eastwood produced and directed a powerful
and nightmarish Western.</P>
<P>     It is 1880 in the flyspeck town of Big Whiskey, Wyoming.  Two cowpokes
are in town taking advantage of the local whorehouse.  One of the whores
makes an ungenerous comment and her client goes after her with a Bowie
knife.  In the dark, his partner may have tried to restrain him, but the end
result is a woman cut up very badly.  Sheriff Little Bill Daggett (played by
gene Hackman) wades in to bring peace.  In his judgement, it is the owner of
the whorehouse who has been wronged and must be paid off in valuable ponies.
Whores, being whores, do not need to be paid back.  This is not a decision
which goes over well with the women.  They decide to pool their money and
offer $1000 to anyone who will kill the two men, whether it is one or both
who are guilty.</P>
<P>     A young gunslinger, anxious to make a name for himself (played by Jaimz
Woolvett), decides he can collect if he teams up with the legendary
gunfighter Bill Munny (played by Clint Eastwood).  Marriage has made a very
different man of Munny and now he is a widower with two children to raise, a
failing pig farm, and nightmares of the men he has killed.  In spite of
being incredibly out of practice, he decides to go along, but only if his
old partner Ned Logan (played by Morgan Freeman) will join them.</P>
<P>     UNFORGIVEN is a dark Western.  It is dark in tone and often dark in
photography.  It is a murky film about murky moral decisions.  Nobody is
totally good; nobody is totally bad.  While there is not a lot to redeem to
cowpoke who sets the whole fiasco in motion, there is at least a modicum of
understanding of why he did what he did and the feeling that his intended
punishment may outweigh his crime.  I could be wrong, but it seems to me his
partner was only well-intentioned and he too is pulled far too deeply into
the mess that ensues.  If the timing had been different, Hackman's character
as a sadistic sheriff could have been inspired by Daryl Gates.  He combines
a laudable desire to defend justice with a dangerous desire to define it.</P>
<P>     This film shows a surprising bitterness about the myths of the Old
West.  Yet where they are debunked, the film rings true.  Sleeping out under
the stars may be nice, but with storm clouds it is a different matter.  the
great gunfights of the West are about as romantic as the great gunfights of
Vietnam.  An obvious "happy ending" is foreshadowed and then avoided.  And
one nice touch of bitter irony it would be a pity to miss: the saloon and
whorehouse that is the core of the hellhole town of Big Whiskey, Wyoming, is
called "Greeley's."</P>
<P>     UNFORGIVEN ranks up with THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES as one of Eastwood's
two best films.  I give it a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
