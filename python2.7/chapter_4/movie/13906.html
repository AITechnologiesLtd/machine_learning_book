<P>Every since "Animal House," almost every comedy set in a college features 
some John Belushi wannabe doing his best Bluto impression and failing 
miserably. They fail because it's impossible to capture the magic of the 
late comedian simply by mimicking his character's behavior. There was a 
special glint in Belushi's eyes, a distinctive quality in the timbre of 
his voice and a sense of danger in his every movement that enabled him to 
take the stock character of a frat-house wild man and elevate it into 
something classic. </P>
<P>While Bluto's spot in the College Comedy Hall of Fame remains secure, 
it's time to make room for the new maniac in town. As Cliff, a hyper-
enthusiastic, frenzied psychopath just waiting to be diagnosed, Lochlyn 
Munro is scary, mesmerizing and flat-out hilarious. His performance alone 
is worth the price of admission to "Dead Man on Campus."    </P>
<P>Please don't mistake the raves for Munro's tour de force as an 
unqualified endorsement of the movie. While "Dead Man on Campus" has a 
number of funny scenes, it really only hits the bull's eye when Cliff is 
on screen. In between his relatively brief appearances, you'll spend a 
fair amount of time waiting for the film to stop spinning its wheels and 
to get moving. </P>
<P>The premise for "Dead Man on Campus" springs from the urban legend that 
if a student kills himself during a semester, his surviving roommates 
will automatically receive straight-A's as compensation for their grief 
and trauma. When a pair of mismatched roomies realize their grades are 
beyond redemption, they hatch a desperate scheme to cash in on the "dead 
man's clause" by finding a suicidal roommate and doing what they can to 
push him over the edge.</P>
<P>Thomas Everett Scott ("That Thing You Do") plays Josh, a wholesome 
Indiana boy attending prestigious Daleman College on an academic 
scholarship. His devotion to scholastic excellence falters under the 
influence of new roommate Cooper (Mark-Paul Gosselaar from "Saved By the 
Bell"), a wealthy kid majoring in sex, drugs and rock and roll. </P>
<P>The two work well together. Scott is an engaging actor and his 
introduction to the party life provides some smiles, particularly when he 
blissfully recounts his first sexual experience ("We just...did it! It 
was like 'Time for sex!'"). Playing a self-absorbed ladies-man, Gosselaar 
is appropriately smarmy, and there's a certain perverse pleasure watching 
"Saved By the Bell's" Zack holding a stethoscope inside his pants and 
happily announcing "I can hear my heartbeat through my penis!"</P>
<P>Still, the first half of the comedy is relatively slow going, until the 
boys finally reach a crisis point and begin their search for a suicidal 
roomie. They come up with three candidates. Buckley (Randy Pearlstein) is 
a frail, skittish paranoid who often threatens suicide while ranting 
about an elaborate conspiracy involving Kurt Cobain and Vince Foster 
(they're still alive, sequestered near Mount St. Helens) and Bill Gates, 
who is after Buckley's brain.</P>
<P>Basket-case number two is Matt (Corey Page), a glowering goth-rocker with 
a thick British accent who handily incorporates his suicide threats into 
his song lyrics. </P>
<P>And then there's Cliff, a psycho for all seasons. Leaping about the room, 
periodically humping the couch like some crazed dog in heat, Lochlyn 
Munro totally throws himself into character. He was so convincing in his 
audition that director Alan Cohn initially resisted hiring him, fearful 
that maybe it wasn't just an act. </P>
<P>Munro manages to make the insanely over-the-top character endearing 
rather than grating. When he accidentally sets a coed's hair on fire 
during a party, he has to be stopped from unzipping to put out the flames 
using his personal fire hose. Watching the young woman panic, he 
innocently states "I don't get it. Whenever I'm on fire, I remember to 
drop and roll." Cliff's coarse antics are completely tasteless and 
howlingly funny. Incidentally, stay through the closing credits or you'll 
miss a bonus Cliff moment.</P>
<P>If only the rest of the film could maintain the energy and crudeness of 
the Cliff scenes. The biggest problem with the bulk of "Dead Man on 
Campus" is that it's too damn tasteful. First-time feature director Cohn 
pulls his punches, tempering potentially riotous scenes with a peculiar 
restraint. Just weeks after the remarkably successful release of the 
gross-a-thon "There's Something About Mary," this is certainly the wrong 
time for timidity. And after all, this is a comedy about students trying 
to drive a person to his death, for Pete's Sake. Cohn flirts with genuine 
black comedy and occasionally scores, but too frequently constructs 
scenes that play like a UPN sitcom with extra swearing. </P>
<P>Thank goodness Lochlyn Munro's Cliff was there to drag this movie back to 
the gutter where it belongs. It's easy to imagine John Belushi looking 
down from the heavens, nodding his approval. A successor to the throne 
has at long last arrived and the spirit of Bluto lives on.</P>
