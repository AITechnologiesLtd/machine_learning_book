<PRE>"A Bug's Life" - Small Wonder
by Homer Yen
(1998)</PRE>
<P>If you loved the rich animation and the fresh look of 1995's Toy
Story, you'll find just as much to enjoy here with Pixar's newly
computer-animated release.  Indeed, there is a tremendous eye for
detail, an undeniable richness, and even some terrifically animated
action sequences that will make you wonder how did they do that.  But
is a visual feast enough to satiate our appetite for a fun night out? 
For me, it left a bland taste in my mouth.  </P>
<P>Like ANTZ, another recent film about small critters, the focus here is
on Flik (voiced by David Foley), who is one of the smartest ants of
the colony but is prone to accidents.  For example, he creates a
machine which allows for increased harvests.  Food is needed not only
for the survival of the colony, but an additional offering must be
collected to appease tyrannical grasshoppers, led by Hopper (voiced by
Kevin Spacey).  But when Flik accidentally destroys the offering, it
infuriates Hopper who threatens their destruction.  To try to help,
Flik embarks on a quest to find some tough warrior bugs to come to
their aid.  Flik does find some volunteers (a praying mantis, a black
widow, a caterpillar and others).  However, Flik mistakes them to be
warriors when in fact their mobility and acts of bravery are only
because they are runaways from a circus.  With the colony's survival
at stake, the accident-prone ant and a bunch of circus rejects must
come up with a plan to rid themselves of Hopper and his gang.</P>
<P>There certainly is no lack of creativity here.  A rainstorm looks like
the ants are being water bombed.  Dandelion pods are used to transport
Flik afar as he floats across considerable distances.  The circus bugs
are all very colorful and appealing.  I especially liked Heimlich, the
plump caterpillar, whose voice was a funny mix of soprano and Nazi.  A
particularly nice treat comes at the end when they show animated
outtakes, where insects miss their cues or flub their lines,
satirizing mistakes often made by humans.  </P>
<P>I commend this movie for it's visual appeal and it's ability to
captivate kids.   The animation is superb.  Witness the sequence where
the band of bugs is trying to escape from a hungry bird or a circus
act involving matches and fly paper, and you'll agree.   If I had
children, this would be on my list of must-see movies.  Yet, for this
alternative rock listening, sports car driving, entertainment seeking
guy, I would probably tell my friends to see ANTZ instead.   Why? 
Because that movie plays better for adults attending by themselves. 
It had an entertaining villain and some terrific sequences that was
more than delightful.  "A Bug's Life" is clearly more family-oriented
fare.   </P>
<PRE>Grade:         B-  if you're an adult
                                 A-   if you're a wee one.</PRE>
