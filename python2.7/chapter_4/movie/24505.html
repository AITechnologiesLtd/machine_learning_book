<P>        If Universal Pictures really wanted viewers to properly
appreciate ``BASEketball'' the studio should have furnished each
ticket-buyer with a free six-pack. This proud-to-be-stupid comedy,
which unites the creators of ``South Park'' and one of the men behind
the ``Naked Gun'' series, is is the type of movie designed to be
watched in a bar, at a frat house, or after a party.  Putting it in an
alcohol-free theatrical setting makes about as much sense as packing a
suitcase for your trip to Nudestock.</P>
<P>  With its consistently raunchy tone ``BASEketball'' can't
help but invite comparisons to ``There's Something About Mary,'' the
hit that's taken low-brow humor to new heights. Though ``BASEketball''
cheerfully pours on one gross-out after another - a guy drinks from a
bidet, clueless heroes Coop (Trey Parker) and Remer (Matt Stone) knock
back tequila with an 8-year-old boy, a character discovers a woman's
hair stuck between his teeth - nothing here approaches the sick genius
of the ``hair gel'' scene in ``Mary.''</P>
<P>  But two points for trying. Stone and Parker may not be
actors, but they'll do anything to get a reaction or to spice up the
movie's so-called plot. The story involves Coop and Remer's attempts
to save their newly created sport from the clutches of villains Cain
(Robert Vaughn) and curvy black-widow Yvette (Jenny McCarthy, who has
very little screen time and almost nothing to do).</P>
<P>  Unsurprisingly, the best laughs in ``BASEketball'' have
nothing to do with the central story, such as when earnest Yasmine
Bleeth asks that the kids she cares for be referred to as
``health-challenged or life-impaired'' rather than terminally ill.</P>
<P>  Writer-director David Zucker crams as much verbal and visual
humor in each shot as possible - watch the background action carefully
- in an effort to amuse or offend as frequently as possible. The
biggest joke of all, however, may be Zucker's claim in the press
information that the film is based on a true story. Now that is funny.</P>
