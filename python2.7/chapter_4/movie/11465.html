<P>   Many a tale has exploited the theme, "Things and people
are not always what they seem to be."  This is the perfect
concept for designing a thriller which twists and turns, its
ending unpredictable--at least by anyone who hasn't seen
scores of films that center on humankind's infinite capacity for
double-dealing.  You may or may not guess the finale of "Wild
Things," and the audience is advised not to reveal the
conclusion, but notwithstanding your ability to foretell the
future, you'll find "Wild Things" a hoot.  This movie, directed
by John McNaughton--known for his low-budget, cultish 
"Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"--is more conventional than 
his subsequent features, such as "The Borrower" and Eric
Bogosian's one-man "Sex, Drugs, Rock & Roll," and features
humor, both intended and unintentional, that evokes laughter
along with its tension.</P>
<P>   Using a broad, satiric brush to reproach the legal profession
(Bill Murray as a criminal attorney?), the influence wielded by
the super-rich, and even the sorts of sordid plots that have
long kept the novels of, say, Dean Koontz on best-seller lists
forever, Stephen Peters's script deals with conspiracies woven
in the upscale yachting town of Blue Bay Florida, where
wealthy women wield influence over the institutions of banking
and education and get to choose their favorite deck boy or
other servant for their daily bed partners.  </P>
<P>   With the alligator-swarming waters of the Everglades
providing an apt metaphor for the twisted intrigues and
machinations of the wage slaves as well as the rich and
powerful, "Wild Things" focuses on a popular high-school
guidance counselor, Sam Lombardo (Matt Dillon), whose
interest in the dazzling senior student, Kelly Van Ryan
(Denise Richards), goes beyond allowing her to wash his jeep
one Sunday.  The daughter of the town's wealthiest woman,
Sandra Van Ryan (Theresa Russell), Kelly is accustomed to
getting what she wants, though she seems to despise her
provocative mother to the same degree that she is drawn to
Sam.  After inviting herself inside Sam's downscale home, she
leaves in tears, confessing to her mother and to detectives
Ray Duquette (Kevin Bacon) and Gloria Perez (Daphne
Rubin-Vega) that she had been raped by the teacher.  When
a vulgar misfit, Suzie Toller (Neve Campbell), comes forward
with a similar story of rape, Sam is brought to trial defended
by an ambulance-chasing lawyer, Ken Bowden (Bill Murray). 
As the seemingly open-and-shut case proceeds in the
courtroom, there develops a series of accusations that sends
spectators reeling, after which follows a sequence of events
involving the detectives, the guidance counselor, the students
and their parents.</P>
<P>   Some of the best segments of the movie are its comic
moments, particularly its throwaway remarks.  As Sam
lectures a senior seminar in the school auditorium, he asks
the youngsters, "What is a sex crime?"  "Not gettin' it," replies
a quick-thinking and absolutely correct 17-year-old.  Bill
Murray does particularly well in the humor department as an
attorney whose walls are covered with pictures of his client,
who all appear to be happily waving to him as they support
themselves on their crutches.  Sporting a brace about his
neck, he explains to his client, Sam, "I don't wear this all the
time...but some of the insurance guys are hanging around." 
Murray is one of those comics that can make you laugh just
by looking at him, his angelic face and twinkling eyes
signaling that yet another one-liner is coming.  "Hold my
calls," he announces pretentiously to his secretary in an office
obviously bereft of clients.  </P>
<P>   Photographer Jeffrey Kimball points his camera to the
obvious symbols of Floridian swampland such as the
menacing alligators but does not otherwise exert himself to
provide a particular noir or other atmospheric core to the film. 
But Denise Richards is good to look at, her young rival Suzie
Toller effectively ribald, and Matt Dillon does what he can to
keep his young female audience glued to his impressive
biceps.  There is also a sizzling, almost soft-core scene
involving Sam, Suzie and Kelly.  Theresa Russell does a
charming sendup of haute bourgeois women in her role as an
heiress who pretty much runs the town.  But Kevin Bacon is
virtually wasted in a straight role of obsessed and humorless
detective.</P>
<P>   "Wild Things" is a fun movie about a community of people
with larceny in their hearts, which delivers humor, some
whodunit mystery, and quite a few samples of good-old trashy
dialogue.  Rated R.  Running Time: 113 minutes.  (C) 1998
