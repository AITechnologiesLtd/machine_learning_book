<PRE>                               SHADOWS AND FOG
                                 [Spoilers]
                       A film review by Michel Hafner
                        Copyright 1992 Michel Hafner</PRE>
<P>     SHADOWS AND FOG is the new film by Woody Allen.  After being
presented at the Berlin festival in February, coming from the shelves of
Orion, that put it there some time because they couldn't afford the
release, it starts now hitting the screens all over the world.  Spoilers
following...</P>
<P>     SHADOWS AND FOG is not one of Woody's best films.  His predecessor
ALICE, for example, is better.  But it's still a fine film with good
moments in it.</P>
<P>     Basically it's Allen's homage to German expressionist films of the
20s and Franz Kafka ( and ??? ).  He plays a kafkaesque employee named
"Kleinmann" ( ~ "unimportant person") who lives in small town of which
we only see foggy streets at night, some rooms in houses, the police
station, the church, a circus and the brothel.  He is awakened in the
middle of the night by some citizens who order him to join their posse,
that is hunting a mysterious killer on the loose, the "strangler."  He
obeys, but only to find himself alone in the fog, stumbling through the
town in futile search for his purpose as member of the posse.  </P>
<P>     While wandering around and uttering monologues a la Woody he meets
half of Hollywood in cameos and more substantial parts.  </P>
<P>     - Mia Farrow: Swordswallower in the circus, disappointed girlfriend
       of
     - John Malkovich: Clown in the circus, lusting after
     - Madonna: Trapeze-artist of the circus, and a slut, who would be
       better off with
     - Jodie Foster, Kathy Bates, Lily Thomlin: hookers in the brothel,
       receiving guests like
     - John Cusack: the philosopher-student, whose "blood" tells him to
       "live", and whose "brains" ask: "What's the point of it all?"
       Meanwhile
     - Donald Pleasence: as the scientist, cuts open the victims of the 
       strangler and hopes to localize "pure evil" somewhere under his
       microscope, maybe between the liver and the heart, but he is just
       as helpless as almost everybody else, when
     - ??: the strangler, visits him to perform his choking business.
       Maybe God can help, but
     - Josef Sommer: the priest, is busy with maintaining some kind of
       (hit?) list from which you can ge crossed off when your donations
       exceed some limit.</P>
<P>     Confusing?  This is only the beginning.  The whole concept is
rather interesting, but it fails to satisfy, since Allen, basically,
only changes the surroundings for his cast, but the dialogues and
monologues center around the same stuff that was chewed over and over
again in almost every Allen film the last ?? years.  Unfortunately it's
all quiet on the Allen front.  And since the film lacks the elegance of
the script and direction of ALICE, it's not quite up to our
expectations.  Well, instead you can go reference-hunting ("Wasn't that
an allusion to NOSFERATU??  Is he citing FREAKS here?"  ...  )</P>
