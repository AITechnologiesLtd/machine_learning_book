                                DANCE WITH ME
                        A movie review by Joe Barlow
                             (c) Copyright 1998</PRE>
<PRE>STARRING:   Vanessa L. Williams, Chayanne, Kris Kristofferson
DIRECTOR:   Randa Haines
WRITER:       Daryl Matthews
RATED/YEAR: PG/1998</PRE>
<PRE>                    RATING: **** (out of a possible *****)</PRE>
<P>        Sometimes it's wonderful to be wrong.  When I saw the first
trailer for "Dance With Me," the new film from director Randa "Children
of a Lesser God" Haines, I wasn't impressed.  The world hardly needs
another movie in which boring characters wade through a minimalistic plot,
whose only purpose is to link one spectacularly-choreographed dance number
to the next.  After learning who the stars of the film were, I was even
less interested: we have pop singer Vanessa Williams as the female lead,
starring opposite Chayanne, a man who seems to have misplaced his last
name.  Oh, and Kris Kristofferson is along for the ride, too.  Yes,
*the* Kris Kristofferson.  In a dance movie.  Ooo, it's gonna hurt.</P>
<P>        That's the attitude I carried into the opening-day screening of
the movie; two hours and twenty minutes later I walked out, wearing
what I'm sure is one of the dopiest grins that has ever graced my face.
I knew the smile was there, but I simply couldn't get rid of it.  Every
time I tried, a wonderful moment from the film would flash across my mind
and the grin would reattach itself.  I was self-concious about this until
I took a good look at the other people filing out alongside me.  Friends,
I say this with absolutely no exaggeration whatsoever: I saw a similar
smile on *every* face emerging from the theater.  That's the kind of
movie we're dealing with.</P>
<P>        Our story opens in present-day Cuba, where a handsome young man
named Rafael (Chayanne) is coming to terms with the recent death of his
mother.  He receives a sympathy letter from a Texan named John (Kris
Kristofferson), an old friend of the family.  In addition to condolences,
John's note contains an invitation for Rafael to come to America for an
extended visit.  John owns a struggling dance studio and is willing to
offer the mechanically-inclined Rafael a "handyman" position, allowing
him to earn some spending money while he's in the country.  Having no
reason to stay in Cuba, and curious about the mysterious land known as
"The United States," he accepts John's offer.</P>
<P>        After arriving at the studio, the charismatic Rafael befriends
nearly all the students.  Only the beautiful Ruby (Vanessa Williams)
is cold and aloof, after Rafael has the nerve to offer an unsolicited
criticism of one of her routines.  Ruby is an extremely-talented dancer;
her main problem is that she KNOWS it, and is reluctant to take advice
from anyone she regards as beneath her.  This includes Rafael, who she
sees as a mere handyman with no dance experience whatsoever.  The
evidence seems to support her view: Rafael stumbles and trods on his
partner's feet when he attempts to learn even a simple waltz.</P>
<P>        But Rafael, though untrained, reveals himself to be a fine dancer
in his own right.  His secret: simply go with the beat of the music,
let it seep into your soul, then do whatever comes naturally.  He has no
use for "real" dance steps, since everything he needs to know is
contained in the music itself.  Ruby is astonished the first time she
sees Rafael dance this way:</P>
<PRE>        RUBY: I thought you couldn't dance!
        RAFAEL: I'm Cuban.  Of course I can dance.</PRE>
<P>        Even as a cautious friendship begins to form between Rafael and
Ruby, we learn of bigger problems.  John, whose passion for dance has
dwindled as he's aged (and is now all but extinguished), wants nothing
more to do with the trade.  Planning to retire to the coast and become
a full-time fisherman, he agrees to keep the studio open only through the
end of the following month, to allow his students time to practice for an
upcoming competition.  During this limited time frame, the friendship
between himself and Rafael grows extremely complex, which raises other
issues John does not wish to deal with.</P>
<P>        As our characters' relationships grow and change, we can see the
thought and depth that has gone into this film.  At no point are any of
our characters (with the exception of the one-note Julian, Ruby's ex)
less than utterly convincing; this is true even of those students with
little screen time.  My favorite is Bea (Joan Plowright), a dance student
in her late sixties, who is the spitting image of her namesake from "The
Andy Griffith Show."  All of her scenes contain a great deal of heart,
and the wonderful routine she performs with Rafael near the film's finale
generated a round of delighted applause at the screening I attended.</P>
<P>        The direction is subtle but more than effective; never once does
director Haines feel the need to grandstand or make any Great Statements.
The camerawork is straightforward and solid, and the wonderful Latin music
is nothing short of infectous.  The cinematographer has chosen to use very
soft lighting for most of the scenes, giving a cozy, intimate feel
that suits the movie well.  All of these traits come together in the
magnificent dance number in which Rafael and Ruby cut loose in a Cuban
club.  Watch how the camera lightly weaves in and out of the crowd as Ruby
is handed off from one partner to the next, like a human hot potato.  She
and the other dancers, male and female alike, are but a blur of smiles and
bright colors, enveloped by this amazing music.  It's at this point that
Ruby finally realises what Rafael has been telling her all along: follow
the melody, and your feet will move by themselves.  It's unquestionably
my favorite moment in the entire film.</P>
<P>        The movie owes much of its success to Chayanne's portrayl of
Rafael.  The guy is just so darn likeable, with a disarming smile that
makes you want to dash up and throw a brotherly arm around his shoulder,
that the story is practically guaranteed to work.  Vanessa Williams also
shows remarkable range as Ruby, covering a wide spectrum of emotions and
never once faltering.  This is vital.  Witness the following dialogue, as
Ruby explains to Rafael why she wishes to leave the studio and return to
her former dance partner:</P>
<PRE>        RAFAEL: What about the night we danced?
        RUBY: That was different.
        RAFAEL: That's my point.</PRE>
<P>        These lines are so perfectly delivered that we never doubt them.
If they'd been spoken by less-skilled actors, however, they could've come
across as laughably trite.</P>
<P>        But the biggest surprise for me was Kris Kristofferson's masterful
portrayl of John.  Arguably the most complex performance in the movie,
Kristofferson has full control of his character at all times, knowing
precisely when to reign himself in.  There are no moments of self-
indulgence, which could've been fatal to the story's believability.  I
sincerely hope that he's remembered when Oscar nominations for "Best
Supporting Actor" are announced; he's THAT good.  (What is it about
country singers that makes them great actors, anyway?  First there was
Dwight Yokam in "Sling Blade," then Lyle Lovett in "The Opposite of
Sex," and now Mr. Kristofferson.  Granted, KK has acted in other movies
before, but he's never been better than he is here.)</P>
<P>        "Dance With Me" is not the best film I've seen this year, but its
warm afterglow has stayed with me.  The movie is joyful and innocent; in
every shot we can feel the filmmakers' love of dance and their great wish
to share it with the audience.  We need more films like this.  Thinking
about the movie as I write these words, I can feel that dopey grin back
on my face.  But if a film can make me feel this good, I don't mind a
bit.</P>
