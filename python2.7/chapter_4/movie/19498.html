<P>If "The Haunting" was trimmed down to 40 minutes and presented in 3-D as 
an IMAX feature, it might serve as a passable diversion. In its present 
form, the production is merely a flat, draggy exercise in cheesy special 
effects and grandiose art direction palming itself off as a horror movie. 
"The Haunting" is not scary, not in the least. Although technically an 
adaptation of Shirley Jackson's novel, "The Haunting of Hill House," the 
plot of the film is almost as insubstantial as the spirits within it. In 
fact, the whole thing plays far more like an amusement park spook-house 
ride than a real movie. The producers would be better served by cutting a 
deal with Disney World, installing a tram on the sets and billing the 
whole thing as "The Haunted Mansion: Version 2.0."</P>
<P>"The Haunting" is just another sad example of the "more-is-better" school 
of filmmaking, with Jan "Oh my God, it's the guy who directed 'Speed 2!'" 
De Bont at the helm. While wasting 112 precious, irreplaceable minutes of 
my life on this leaden dud, I repeatedly thought of "The Blair Witch 
Project," a genuinely creepy, disquieting film produced for less money 
than "The Haunting" spent on catered lunches for the crew. Didn't anyone 
at Dreamworks notice that their $80 million horror show wasn't the 
slightest bit horrifying? Apparently not, for while the studio did sent 
De Bont back for some last minute reshoots, it was only to "clarify the 
ending." </P>
<P>The film starts off in standard haunted-house movie fashion, introducing 
the characters and giving viewers a tour of Spook Central. Liam Neeson 
plays a doctor who lures three subjects to a massive, gothic mansion in 
New England, under the pretense of conducting a study of sleep disorders. 
Actually, he is researching the "primordial fear reaction" and intends to 
plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch what happens. The 
nitwits who believe that a sleep study would be conducted in a mammoth, 
isolated house are Eleanor (Lili Taylor), a mousy caregiver; Theodora 
(Catherine Zeta Jones), an extremely self-assured bisexual; and Luke 
(Owen Wilson), a wise-cracking slacker. </P>
<P>But forget the characters (De Bont certainly did), for the real star is 
the house itself, an absurdly huge estate packed with gigantic creaking 
doors, cavernous hallways, wildly ornate chambers (including a mirrored 
carousel room), and loads of cherub carvings, gargoyles and other weird 
knickknacks. The sets are impressive, but never for a moment do they seem 
like anything but over-the-top eye candy. </P>
<P>There lies the problem with the whole movie. Nothing feels the least bit 
convincing, from the idiotic premise to the phony-looking house to the 
cornball special effects (try, just try, not to laugh as the wooden 
cherubs' faces morph into "Oh no!" expressions worthy of "Mr. Bill"). 
Ghost stories work only if the audience is drawn into the tale, and De 
Bont has no clue how to accomplish that. Instead of vicariously 
experiencing terror in a haunted house, we remain bored spectators, 
watching talented actors swallowed by De Bont's blustery spook-tacular. 
"The Haunting" promises thrills and chills, but delivers only yawns. What 
a colossal drag.</P>
