<PRE>Big Momma's House
A Film Review by Michael Redman
Copyright 2000 by Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>No Stars (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>"It's June," said the walrus to the carpenter, "and it's time to talk of
excruciatingly bad movies."</P>
<P>Every summer, the film industry, trusting in the belief supposedly held by
P. T. Barnum about how often suckers are brought into this world, dumps a
seemingly infinite number of movies into the nation's theaters.</P>
<P>Each of these cinematic offerings, most with a budget roughly equivalent to
the GNP of a small industrialized country, are touted as the "Big Summer
Blockbuster!" (TM).</P>
<P>There are movies that are hyped as hilarious: you'll be close to a heart
attack from laughter. Others are supposed to be the most exciting time
you've spent in the dark since your prom date in high school.</P>
<P>Unfortunately the vast majority are better suited for providing an
air-conditioned location for napping. The studios are banking on you having
so much free time during the warmer months that you'll be willing to fork
over a few bucks just to do _something_.</P>
<P>Of course there are the exceptions. Some of the best action films, funniest
comedies and even a few exceptional dramas are released while the sun
shines. But these are rare.</P>
<P>"Big Momma's House" is not one of these. It's not even an acceptable
time-waster. In fact, if it weren't for "Battlefield Earth", it could be in
the running for most disappointing film of the season.</P>
<P>FBI agent Malcolm Turner (Martin Lawrence), master of disguise, is sent to
stake out Big Momma's house in a small southern town. Big Momma's
granddaughter Sherry (Nia Long) just might come a'visiting along with
millions in bank loot and her escaped convict boyfriend.</P>
<P>When the very large matriarch is suddenly called out of town, Malcolm dons a
latex Big Momma suit to try to get Sherry to spill the beans.</P>
<P>You can probably guess the rest: a lot of fat jokes, fart jokes, old woman
jokes and then Malcolm falls for Sherry. Not one bit of which is even
remotely humorous.</P>
<P>The only potentially funny bits are telegraphed well in advance or have been
given away in commercials. It's a fewer-than-one-joke film.</P>
<P>Malcolm's disguise looks like a hyper-inflated Cabbage Patch Kid and could
only fool someone who has never seen a human being before.</P>
<P>Even Lawrence who has been amusing in other films, comes across as a
low-rent Eddie Murphy. The "real" Big Momma ((Ella Mitchell), a huge feisty
woman, would have been a much more interesting star. She's fiery and has
some energy about her. On the other hand, Lawrence, despite his padding, is
smaller than life.</P>
<P>It's a mystery what director Raja Gosnell had in mind. Perhaps he was
attempting to recapture the magic that was his directoral debut: "Home Alone 3".</P>
<P>Supposedly screenwriter Darryl Quarles pitched this with a one-line idea and
then went home to write it. The result looks like he never got beyond that
one line.</P>
<P>The film reminds me of an extended version of the failed sit-com pilots the
networks toss into the television schedules to fill time rather than show
reruns -- only not as entertaining.</P>
<P>The best part of this film? It's showing at the new Showplace West and the
seats are comfortable.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman has written this column for a very long time and you'd think
he'd come to know what to expect when the days get longer. But futile hope
springs eternal. Email your tales of better times to <A HREF="mailto:redman@bluemarble.net.">redman@bluemarble.net.</A>)</P>
