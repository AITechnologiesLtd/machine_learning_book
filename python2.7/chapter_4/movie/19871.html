<P>I'm not sure who director Kinka Usher is, but thanks to him and screenwriter 
Neil Cuthbert, the superhero comedy, "Mystery Men," is the most depressing 
cinematic experience of the year. Not the worst ("Inspector Gadget" and "Wing 
Commander" narrowly edge it out on that disreputable title), but easily the 
most dreary and saddening, as we are forced to watch a cast of fabulous 
actors, usually appearing in smart independent films, flounder within a movie 
that gives none of them an actual distinctive character to work with or, for 
that matter, anything at all to do, aside from be continuously humiliated by 
the absolute inanity of the screenplay.</P>
<P>An obvious take-off of "Batman" and "Superman," "Mystery Men" sets us smack 
dab in the middle of Champion City, as if it was a rejected set from Joel 
Schumacher's version of Gotham City. When the city's reigning superhero, 
Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear), is kidnapped by arch-nemesis Casanova 
Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush), it is up to a squadron of loser superheroes to 
save him, all of which have their own separate power or talent (if you can 
even call it that). There's Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller), the Shoveler (William 
H. Macy), and the Blue Raja (Hank Azaria, wielding lethal forks and spoons 
upon the enemy). Saving the likes of Captain Amazing, however, is going to 
take more than three rejects, so coming to their aide are three more wannabe 
superheroes--Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell),a teen who claims he can become 
invisible "only when nobody is looking"; the Spleen (Paul Reubens), who 
knocks people out with his rancid flatulence; and the Bowler (Janeane 
Garofalo), equipped with a see-through bowling ball that holds her beloved 
father's skull inside. Are these six characters enough to overcome Casanova 
Frankenstein? Do dogs bark? Do cats meow? Do pigs snort? I rest my case.</P>
<P>The almost laughably unfunny jokes in "Mystery Men" is cause enough to 
question the intelligence of its thought-to-be superb cast. Let's take a look 
at the actors, while we're at it: Ben Stiller ("There's Something About 
Mary," "Your Friends and Neighbors"), Janeane Garofalo ("Romy and Michele's 
High School Reunion," "The Truth About Cats and Dogs"), William H. Macy 
("Fargo," "Boogie Nights"), Greg Kinnear ("As Good As It Gets"), Geoffrey 
Rush ("Shine"), and Paul Reubens ("Pee Wee's Big Adventure"). If that weren't 
enough, Claire Forlani, a standout in "Meet Joe Black," is painfully wasted 
(as is everyone else, of course) as the only 'normal' character in the whole 
film, a diner waitress and potential love interest to Stiller. Heavy usage of 
highly euphoric, mind-alterting substances had to have been used in order for 
these actors to sign on to this $85-million movie that looks like a 
$5-million direct-to-video effort. Either that, or they turn out to not have 
any taste in films after all...nah! Drugs definately played a large part in 
the casting process.</P>
<P>So-called comedy flies at a rapid rate throughout the film, but the problem 
is none of it is the least bit funny, only groan-inducing and lame. 
Supposedly, 60-70% of the dialogue was improvised on the spot by the actors, 
which leads me to believe that not only was the script bad, but the cast 
realized this and tried to fix it with their stand-up comedy abilities. 
Improvisation on the spot must be one of their weak spots, unfortunately, 
since very rarely does anyone say anything clever, and even then it is a 
throwaway line that is all but forgotten about a second afterwards. "Mystery 
Men" proves that no matter how good the actors may be, they cannot salvage a 
film if they aren't even given the chance to develop their own individual 
personalities.</P>
<P>'Excruciating' would be the perfect word to describe physically watching this 
movie. Every element on every level is inept in every respect, and the 
non-stop, stylized comic-book action sequences and idiotic dialogue is akin 
to watching an Akiva Goldsman-written fourth "Batman" sequel. If anything, an 
empty water bottle came in quite handy while I was watching the film, for if 
I couldn't have handled it in my hand, played with it, tore off the paper 
wrapping, etc., I would have been in dire danger of dozing off.</P>
<P>If there is a bright spot to be found at all in "Mystery Men," beyond the 
unbearable filmmaking stench of desperation, it is Janeane Garofalo, who is 
fun to watch in every movie she's in. She ultimately is not very fun to watch 
here, simply because the rest of the movie is so nauseatingly awful, but she 
does have a few good lines and shines just by appearing on the screen. Like 
everyone else, though, there was no character to work with, and Garofalo's 
only distinctive quality was that she was actually hip and snappy. In other 
words, far to kewl to be hanging out with the rest of those nitwits.</P>
