<PRE>LIBERTY HEIGHTS
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        "No Jews, dogs, or coloreds" reads the sign that hangs from the
chain link fence by the entrance to a public lake in the eastern section of
Baltimore in the mid-1950s.  Since dogs can't read, and none of them can
recall ever having seen a colored person sunbathing, this sign must be
strictly for the Jews, yes?  So surmises one of a group of three friends,
three Jewish friends, whose teenage experiences with race, religion, and
prejudice form the center of Barry Levinson's "Liberty Heights."</P>
<P>        It's the fourth nostalgic return to the director's hometown in a
series that has previously included "Diner," "Tin Men," and "Avalon."
While not as consistently well-written as "Diner," nor as bitingly funny as
"Tin Men," "Liberty Heights" is a solid comedy-drama that contains lots of
satisfying little moments rather than any significant big ones.</P>
<P>        If "Diner" could launch the careers of Steve Guttenberg, Paul
Reiser, Kevin Bacon, Daniel Stern, Timothy Daly, and Mickey Rourke, then
who's to say that Adrien Brody and Ben Foster--who play brothers Van and
Ben Kurtzman respectively--don't have a shot at future stardom?</P>
<P>        Brody and Foster are pretty terrific in "Liberty Heights," as are
most of the performers in the film, including Joe Mantegna and Bebe
Neuwirth as their parents.  Mantegna's Nate Kurtzman runs a burlesque house
and a numbers racket on the side and Neuwirth is his loving, supportive
wife.  As for their sons, Ben gets involved with a colored girl, and Van
falls in love with Cinderella with a magic wand, a well-to-do beauty he
meets at a Halloween party.</P>
<P>        There's a lot of wacky and not-so wacky situations spurred along by
Levinson's characteristically-incisive writing and ear for quotable
dialogue.  Notably strong is the relationship between Ben and Sylvia,
especially the staunch loyalty they show each other.  Propelling the story
forward is a varied score by Andrea Morricone, son of the great and
prolific Italian composer Ennio Morricone ("The Good, the Bad, and the
Ugly," "The Mission," "The Legend of 1900") which, every now and again,
reveals touches of his father's brilliance.  Levinson has shown immaculate
taste in bringing him onboard.</P>
<P>        Like Nate's mist green '55 Cadillac, "Liberty Heights" is a
pleasure to behold.  For Levinson and his followers, it only goes to show
you can go home again, and again.</P>
