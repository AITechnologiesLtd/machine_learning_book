<P>VARSITY BLUES
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: ** (out of ****)
Paramount / 1:41 / 1999 / R (language, nudity, drugs, sexuality)
Cast: James Van Der Beek; Jon Voight; Amy Smart; Paul Walker; Scott 
Caan; Ali Larter; Ron Lester; Eliel Swinton 
Director: Brian Robbins 
Screenplay: John Gatins; W. Peter Iliff <HR>Those film-going blues inspired by the typical January release schedule 
of studio holdovers and expected duds sure aren't remedied by "Varsity 
Blues," a messy melee of predictable teen- and sports-movie cliches that 
never quite scores the touchdowns for which it strains. But making it to 
at least the 50-yard line is another matter entirely, and it can be 
argued that this youth-oriented potboiler gets bits and pieces of its 
ludicrously jam-packed story right. It's just that the good parts are 
hidden under a distracting jumble of impossibly good-looking actors, 
silly sex-oriented humor and a booming soundtrack that includes all this 
week's hot bands. That MTV had a hand in producing "Varsity Blues" 
shouldn't surprise you. </P>
<P>At least there are worthwhile messages about self-confidence and winning 
not being everything buried amongst all the raunchy goings-on, but such 
morals will likely be lost on the movie's core audience of fratboys, 
users of Noxeema and avid "Teen Beat" readers. That last group will 
happily plunk down the admission price to watch "Dawson's Creek" hunk du 
jour James Van Der Beek literally tackle his first big-screen role, a 
high school football player whose moment to shine comes when his Texas 
team's star quarterback ("Pleasantville"'s Paul Walker) suffers an 
on-field injury. Think of Van Der Beek's dull Jonathan "Mox" Moxon as 
the anti-Dawson. </P>
<P>Not exactly hot off the newfound fame, Mox clashes with a coach (Jon 
Voight) who'll do _anything_ to ensure the 23rd consecutive win of the 
state championships. That's the main storyline, but "Varsity Blues" 
veers off course on matters risque and ribald enough to ensure it 
doesn't flop like dissimilar gridiron flicks "Rudy" or "The Program." 
Mox's obese, good ol' boy pal Billy Bob (Ron Lester) dips pancakes in 
butter, guzzles maple syrup straight from the bottle and can't hold down 
booze! Mox's sexy biology instructor turns out to be a stripper who 
bumps and grinds to Van Halen's "Hot for Teacher" at a local strip club! 
Mox goes to a wild party where a couple does the nasty atop a vibrating 
washing machine! </P>
<P>Mox is also lusted after by his ailing friend's girlfriend (Ali Larter), 
but this character seems to exist solely so "Varsity Blues" can stage a 
seduction scene complete with French kisses and Cool Whip. Sure, pretty 
Larter looks beguiling in her strategically-placed cream bikini, but a 
romantic temptation subplot is the last thing this movie needs, 
especially when it apparently doesn't have time or the creativity to 
resolve earlier ones (like a forgotten-about illness for Billy Bob and a 
black teammate who's trotted out only when a race card needs to be 
played). As you can probably guess, everything boils down to a 
testosterone-fueled big game where the stakes are high and the tension 
is non-existent. </P>
<P>See, we know everything will turn out alright, mainly because "Varsity 
Blues" amounts to little more than a cinematic rendition of the ultimate 
male fantasy - jocks, chicks, Coors and scores of multiple varieties. 
It's nicely shot and well-performed by a mostly fresh-faced cast, but 
these assets go to waste because the movie's ambitions rarely amount to 
anything more than a "Porky's"-esque parade of boobs and liquor, liquor 
and boobs. (The most challenging shot prominently features both.) 
Perhaps there'd be nothing wrong with this were "Varsity Blues"' heart 
in the right place, but it's conflicted between body parts a foot above 
and a foot below.<HR>© 1999 Jamie Peck

"'Joe's Apartment' would be a very bad comedy even without the roaches, 
but it would not be a disgusting one. No, wait: I take that back. Even 
without the roaches, we would still have the subplot involving the pink 
disinfectant urinal cakes." -Roger Ebert on "Joe's Apartment"</P>
