<P>Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997)</P>
<PRE>Grade: 41</PRE>
<P>Jay Roach directed this silly spoof of mid-1960s
pop culture, but co-producer/screenwriter/lead actor
Mike Myers is clearly the man in charge.  He plays
the two key (and most outrageous) roles, and the
loose, gag-ridden script seems patterned after his
other great commercial success, "Wayne's World"
from 1992.</P>
<P>I can't say that I 'got' all the 1960s references.
>From "Goldfinger" we have Alotta Fagina (aka Pussy Galore)
and Random Task (aka Oddjob).  From "You Only Live Twice"
there's Dr. Evil (aka Blofeld) and his cat.  I'm sure
there are others, but I haven't seen the Matt Helm
films, and memories blur the escapist action spy movies
together anyway.</P>
<P>The story begins in 1967.  Austin Powers is a
goofy-looking ladies man and special agent, chasing
arch enemy and bad guy Dr. Evil.  Both roles are played
by hammy Mike Myers.  A plot contrivance has both men
cryogenetically frozen until 1997.  They discover that
the world, and culture, has changed; but they resume
their old rivalry and livestyles anyway.  Myers is
provided with love interest Elizabeth Hurley, who is
disgusted with him at first but of course soon comes
around.  Dr. Evil is introduced to his estranged son
Scotty (Seth Green) and inevitably hatches a scheme
that threatens to destroy the world.</P>
<P>Like most screwball comedies with thin plots, the
humor is hit and miss.  The best joke is a reference
to Lucky Charms cereal.  Dr. Evil and Scotty have
some silly arguments that are funny (the group therapy
scene, and a disagreement on the best method to kill
Austin Powers).</P>
<P>But the gags can fall flat as well: Austin's mincing
funny faces, faux chest hair, and references to his bad
teeth.  There is much bathroom humor, which panders
successfully to teen demographics who haven't seen
"Goldfinger".  One gag is especially flogged to death:
Austin and Hurley naked, with various inanimate objects
raised to substitute for body parts that would not be
shown on commercial TV.</P>
<P>Instead of seeing a mediocre satire about the mid-60s,
why not see a contemporary satire from the mid-60s?
"I Love You, Alice B. Toklas!" will fit the bill nicely,
and it stars Peter Sellers instead of a lesser imitation.</P>
