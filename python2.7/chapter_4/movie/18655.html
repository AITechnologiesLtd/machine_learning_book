<P>EXPLANATORY NOTE:  Mr Q. Z. Diablo would like to apologise in advance to
The Phantom for the tone of this review.  The Phantom reviewed horror
films from about 1989 until about 1993 in this forum
(rec.arts.movies.reviews).  Mr Diablo has derived more pleasure from The
Phantom's film reviews than those of any other reviewer, either in
cyberspace or on paper, amateur or professional.  He hopes that The
Phantom will regard this review as a homage rather than a cynical
attempt to ape the style of another for some kind of perverse personal gain.</P>
<P>It was an inclement Sunday night when Mr Diablo dragged a reluctant
bandmate to view THE MATRIX.  The local multiplex is not necessarily Mr
Diablo's preferred haunt but the sheer power of hype was to be reckoned
with.  Unlike The Phantom, Mr Diablo actually prefers art-house cinemas
with their coffee and black-clad patrons discussing possibly mediocre
films in an oh-so-serious manner (readers should refer to the
explanatory note and search in IMDB or DejaNews if this reference
escapes them).  The plan was initially to go to the 6pm screening but
distractions of a musical kind caused attendance to be delayed until the
9pm show.  The assumption that the late screening time on a Sunday would
dissuade Joe and Josephine average from venturing out to the cinema was
horribly mistaken.  They were out in their droves and Mr Diablo was to
be found muttering obscenities sotto voce while staring in dismay at the
lengthy queue, which stretched almost from the ticket office almost to
the amusement arcade opposite.  It seemed that Sunday night's treat was
to be abandoned.  Somehow he obtained a ticket and his response to the
cinematic entertainment purchased for the princely sum of $10 is the
subject of the next few paragraphs.</P>
<P>THE MATRIX is a not so much a genre film as a genres film and yet
somehow avoids being generic.  It simply bristles with ideas, albeit
mostly other people's (just like this review, the author hopes). 
Loosely speaking, the genre can be classified as science fiction which
runs a distant second to Mr Diablo's preferred horror films, of which
there has recently been a sad lack in either mainstream or art-house
release, the abysmal URBAN LEGEND and I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST
SUMMER notwithstanding.  As SF goes, THE MATRIX is a rather seductive
excursion into cyberpunk which possesses all the usual accoutrements of
the stable.  There are hackers, evil government agents, gunplay, urban
sprawl, dim lighting and a healthy dose of virtual reality.  In short;
everything a growing boy or girl needs for a satisfying night's
entertainment - in theory.  It also boasts a more than healthy dose of
eye wear, and Mr Diablo will attempt to refrain from obsessing about it
in the course of this review; an attempt that is probably doomed to failure.</P>
<P>Mr Diablo will attempt to outline as much of the plot as possible
without revealing details which will blunt the film's appeal.  It
concerns a young man (the irritatingly wooden Keanu Reeves, replete with
pudding-bowl haircut and Eastwood-esque squint) who works for a large
software company by day and operates as a hacker with the prophetic nom
de plume Neo in his spare time.  It seems that Neo has been a less than
well-behaved cyber-citizen as the merciless hounds of the law have taken
a particular interest in him.  Fortunately, an unknown organisation has
taken an interest in Neo's welfare and, while these unknown people seem
to be able to bend reality in uncomfortable ways, the alternatives to
throwing his lot in with them seem rather dire.  They are fighting a
construction called The Matrix which seems to be somehow woven in with
reality in some kind of sinister fashion.  When the nature of The Matrix
is revealed, all hell breaks loose as Neo and his new-found companions
battle the evil forces which have set it in place.</P>
<P>The last part of the plot synopsis is, as far as Mr Diablo can make out,
the chief flaw in the film.  Director/writers Larry and Andy Wachowski
(whose previous film, BOUND, escaped Mr Diablo's notice) have penned a
script whose exposition is absolutely enthralling but the lack of any
real plot means that the film begins broadcasting its structural defects
as soon as the protagonists' circumstances have been explained.  This
left Mr Diablo with action and computer generated effects in abundance
which appeared to be imposed upon the films central ideas rather then to
grow out of them.  As a result, he was left feeling a little ambivalent
about the action set pieces which populated the last forty minutes of
the outing.  He was also left wondering why anyone would squint as
constantly as Mr Reeves in such dimly lit locations, let alone why so
many people were insistent upon wearing sunglasses indoors in
semi-darkness.  He assumes that sporting sunglasses in tenebrous locales
represents some kind of cyber-chic that has heretofore eluded him. 
Perhaps someone had been listening to too much 80s music when the
costume design was being finalised.</P>
<P>Characterisations are somewhat less complete than one would hope for in
a cyberpunk outing, with most characters trying desperately to expand
from one to two dimensions.  Mr Diablo regards this as something of a
pity, as cyberpunk in written form has tended to produce extremely
complex characters and interpersonal interactions.  The good guys are
essentially the stereotypes presented to us in the STAR WARS trilogy. 
We have Luke (Reeves), Leia (the rather visually appealing Carrie-Anne
Moss as Trinity), a Han Solo and an Obi-Wan (Morpheus, guru-ed in fine
style by Laurence Fishburne).  The remaining good guys are, of course,
cannon-fodder apart from the addition of a traitor, whose demise occurs
altogether too early for Mr Diablo's taste, despite an irritating
performance straight out of the worst of the crop of action films that
arose, unbidden, throughout the 80s.  His scenery munching and
eye-rolling seems so much out of place that he broadcasts himself as the
rat almost as soon as he is introduced.</P>
<P>The action sequences are well-realised and exciting.  Mr Diablo has read
some reviews which have referenced Hong Kong action cinema as a
jumping-off point (so to speak) and he was pleased to observe a large
amount of Wing Chun Kung Fu amongst the variegated bare-hands fighting
styles on display.  Action sequences, therefore, tend towards the
choreographed which adds to the style-over-content feel that seems to
dominate the film.  Special effects are variable with computer generated
imagery veering between the well-integrated and the cheesily tacked-on. 
Some of the make-up effects have a high ick-factor and the various
mechanical contrivances seem to have been designed solely to take
advantage of our aversion to all things arachnid, insectiod and
cephalopod.  The soundtrack is often delightful, featuring very
contemporary electronic music that undercuts the action very effectively
indeed.  Readers should think Propellerheads (whose "Bang On" is used in
one of the better action sequences) and they've got the, erm, picture.</P>
<P>As concerns the borrowing of ideas that has been referred to, Mr Diablo
observed pieces of THE TERMINATOR, GHOST IN THE SHELL, HACKERS and the
awful THE LAWNMOWER MAN, grated and melted together to produce a
fondue-ish plot and themes.  Throw in the STAR WARS trilogy for
characterisation and mythic feel and add, when the mixture begins to
bubble, a dash of Terry Gilliam's wonderful TWELVE MONKEYS for that
little bit of post-apocalyptic flavour.  Other borrowings are present
but Mr Diablo would prefer not to try to remember all of them, both for
the sake of space (brevity not being his best attribute, in any case)
and because the hour grows late as he types this magnum opus.  In any
case, there are enough of them to keep train-spotting viewers
entertained almost as much as the film itself.</P>
<P>The basic premise of the film is almost reasonable but some considerable
suspension of disbelief is required to let the many inconsistencies in
plot devices go unheeded.  The very nature of The Matrix is such that Mr
Diablo fails to understand how the good guys cannot immediately be wiped
out at the whim of the evil forces at work.  He can't explain this in
any detail without revealing too much about the film's resolution but he
hopes that even the dimmest in the audience worked it out after the
first forty five minutes.  The only thing that Mr Diablo couldn't work
out was why the hell Mr Reeves didn't don a pair of sunglasses
substantially earlier to ameliorate his need to squint.  There was a
strong feeling that he'd blend in better with the rest of the cast as
well as avoiding strain on his vestigial acting muscles induced by
attempting to express emotions by adopting various facial casts.</P>
<P>Readers of this review should not labour under the misapprehension that
Mr Diablo thought that THE MATRIX was a bad film.  Far from it; despite
the unabashed borrowing of other films and styles, THE MATRIX has an
awful lot going for it.  The camera work consists of that mix of the
static and the mobile that Mr Diablo finds appealing  He regards any
film that gives him unpleasant flashbacks to INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE
as overdone in this department and was pleased that no such unpleasant,
dizzy, pop-music-video sensation was engendered during THE MATRIX.  The
vilification of a certain software giant (intentional or otherwise - Mr
Diablo hopes that the former is true as this would add a certain mordant
symbolism to the goings-on) is welcome, as is the epic father-figure
theme that underpins the sometimes empty action.</P>
<P>Mr Diablo enjoyed himself almost thoroughly for a couple of hours and
this is all that can really be asked, even though there was the constant
nagging question of WHY DOESN'T MR REEVES PUT ON SOME #$%&ING
SUNGLASSES.  He will refrain from awarding marks out of ten, a letter
grade or an arbitrary number of stars in deference to The Phantom, whose
work inspired him to pen this prose.  THE MATRIX is far from flawless
but will serve as a stop-gap until THE CUBE or a piece of respectable
horror cinema comes to town, whichever occurs first.</P>
