<PRE>BEYOND THE CLOUDS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Michelangelo Antonioni and Wim Wenders's BEYOND THE CLOUDS, which was
made in 1995, is just now getting its United States release.  A loose
collection of slow and pretentious stories, the film has such flowery
dialog that it can be laughably silly.  ("You're the tree that eats it's
own fruit," one would-be lover, played by Inés Sastre, uses as a come-on
line to a mysterious woman, played by Irène Jacob.)</P>
<P>But this haunting series of tales about unsuccessful searches for love
has a remarkable visual poetry that draws in the viewer.  With frequent
full-frontal nudity, the film is also unabashedly sensual, even if the
lovers are uniformly unhappy.</P>
<P>The stories are glued together with the character of a director, played
by John Malkovich, who appears to be in a post-film funk after wrapping
up his last movie.  He wanders through the various stories, taking part
in one in which he gets to make love with a gorgeous woman (Sophie
Marceau) who stabbed her father 12 times.  The director muses on the
importance of that exact number.  It's a film like that.</P>
<P>The first story concerns a handsome young man, Silvano (Kim Rossi
Stuart), who experiences love at first site with a long-legged beauty
named Carmen (Inés Sastre).  These actors are given the toughest lines
to say with conviction.  ("I am enslaved by your silence," Silvano tells
Carmen.  Later, she remarks to him, "I can still smell the scent of your
skin and your words.")  The night that they meet she changes to
something sexy and lies waiting in her room for him, but, since he never
shows up, she leaves town the next day.  When they meet again a couple
of years later, he still can't quite bring himself to follow through.
This time he does go to her room, but he becomes the ultimate tease as
he repeatedly brings his lips and hands within millimeters of her naked
flesh without ever touching her.  So much for that story.</P>
<P>Other melancholic vignettes include one about a woman (Fanny Ardant)
whose husband (Peter Weller) is having trouble breaking off an affair
and another in which a wife has left suddenly, taking most of the
furniture.</P>
<P>This strangely intriguing film is set in a cold, bleak, off-season
Europe, full of gloomy gray skies, heavy fog, rain and thunder.  A
slightly erotic and decidedly offbeat movie, BEYOND THE CLOUDS has a
strong attraction that is hard to put into words.  A frustrating film,
it is simultaneously bizarrely fascinating and soporifically
unsatisfying.</P>
<P>BEYOND THE CLOUDS runs 1:53.  The film is in English, Italian and
French, with English subtitles.  It is not rated but would be at least
an R for nudity, sex and language.  It would be acceptable for mature
high school students.</P>
<P>The film is playing in limited release in the United States now.  In the
San Jose area, it is currently showing at the Camera 3.</P>
