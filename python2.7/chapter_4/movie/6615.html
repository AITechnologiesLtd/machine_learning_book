<P>'The People vs. Larry Flynt' is a flagrant and courageous success in tackling
the subject matter it set out to conquer.  Hustler magazine publisher Larry
Flynt took a civil case against him all the way to the Supreme Court of the
United States claiming his right under the first amendment of the U.S.
Constitution to publish his material anyway he saw fit.  You may not like
Larry Flynt or what he stands for but the amazing thing about this film is
that despite the repellent nature of the characters and ideas shown to the
public at large, sympathy and tolerance is created for Flynt's situation
symbolizing the fact that if his rights can be protected then so can anyone el
se's.  Two time Academy Award winning director Milos Forman ('One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest,' 'Ragtime,' 'Amadeus') is a master of making intellectual
artistry alive and vibrant and he is helped by head producer of this movie,
Oliver Stone (himself a two time Oscar winning director) who is no stranger
at being socially aware.  Together along with the antics and reality of Scott
Alexander and Larry Karaszewski's screenplay, this team has fashioned a story
of society's ethics (or lack of them) against the backdrop of freedom which
so many of us take for granted.  Woody Harrelson portrays Larry Flynt with an
eccentric quality of flamboyance and unintended humour along with
intelligence and a daring dose of questioning authority at any cost to
himself or his business.  The real scene stealer in this movie is Courtney
Love who portrays his wife and unquestionably his best friend who stands by
him during and despite an assassination attempt and court battle.  Her
characterization of Flynt's wife is savagely loyal and we see her life played
out on the screen eventually contracting AIDS from her morally decaying
lifestyle.  A breath of fresh air for this movie is delivered by the straight
laced performance of Edward Norton ('Primal Fear') who plays Flynt's
attorney.  He is dedicated to his client's cause even though he dislikes
Flynt's tactics and publication business.  His character is both interesting
and tips the scales as the centre of the movie's legal interpretation.  Look
for this one to score big at Oscar time.  Updating my pick of the best film
of 1996, 'The People vs. Larry Flynt,' is probably going to remain intact.</P>
