AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)
New Line / 1:34 / 1999 / PG-13 (constant sex/bathroom humor, language,
comic violence, pseudo-nudity)
Cast: Mike Myers; Heather Graham; Robert Wagner; Michael York; Mindy
Sterling; Seth Green; Verne Troyer; Rob Lowe 
Director: Jay Roach 
Screenplay: Mike Myers; Michael McCullers<HR>A sequel to a movie that wasn't a very big hit to begin with isn't an
especially encouraging idea -- unless, of course, it's "Austin Powers: The
Spy Who Shagged Me." This second helping of bawdy business from
star/writer Mike Myers successfully begins to stack a franchise on top of
the 1997 original, which was basically a base send-up of British cinema,
the James Bond series in particular. "Spy" has greater ambitions and makes
good on them, sticking it to the aforementioned target while
simultaneously leaving no pop-culture stone unturned. In the first 10
minutes alone, Myers lampoons 007 themes, "Star Wars" screen-crawls and
Esther Williams' underwater ballets -- and they mostly click, in-season or
not.</P>
<P>This inspired silliness carries into and throughout the entire film, which
finds '60s nemeses Austin Powers (Myers), the swinging sleuth with a
ghastly Shirley Partridge-'do and ghastlier Nehru jackets, and Dr. Evil
(Myers again), the wicked mastermind with a kooky affinity for his
hairless kitty and kookier plans for world domination, again clashing in
the '90s. Evil's nonsensical schemes involve using time-travel to steal
Powers' mojo (or, for those not in the know, his libido), though in the
funnier self-referential bits, Myers and Co. draw attention to plot holes
and suggest that overlooking them is in full enjoyment's best interest.</P>
<P>But do people really care if the story adds up? Far more pressing matters
involve whether or not Myers, both as scribe and performer, is at his
cheekiest. The answer -- a strong "don't worry" -- comes long before he
debuts yet a third role, that of a slobbering, Scottish Dr. Evil henchman
called Fat Bastard. Giving life to this loathsome brute enables Myers to
not only hide under what looks like a ton of latex, it permits the kind of
kilts-and-haggis humor he mined so effectively in "So I Married an Axe
Murderer." He'd be guilty of spotlight-hogging were he not so dead-on in
all three parts, each of which could probably occupy their own farce
alone.</P>
<P>Like Myers' hats, the film fuses cast members old and new. Showing up from
the former "Austin" are familiar favorites such as Number Two (Robert
Wagner), Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling) and Scott Evil (Seth Green).
Misunderstood Scott, the bad Dr.'s son, partakes in clashes with dad that
are utterly priceless, leading the elder Evil to instead play
father-figure to his 28-inch-tall clone (Verne Troyer), a malevolent
munchkin he affectionately dubs Mini-Me. This "Island of Dr.
Moreau"-inspired character gets used and abused frequently, reaffirming
how "Spy" shuns political-correctness in its search for a quick giggle
fix. But the jokes are never offensive, even if they spend a majority of
the time in and around the toilet.</P>
<P>As with all spoofs, misfires occur -- how not original to cut to an
erupting volcano following suggested sexual activity -- and every single
punchline doesn't quite hit a home run; "The Spy Who Shagged Me" has a
tendency to drag a few shenanigans out to the point of overkill, though
that's less of a stumbling block here than it was for its predecessor
(remember the interminable urination bit?). One area done better by the
previous installment, however, would be the female lead: Elizabeth Hurley
brought her an appealing mix of sensuality and sportsmanship. Hurley gets
explained away in a nifty prologue, thus opening the door for Heather
Graham, who looks fetching in mesh but seems out-of-sync with the groovy
goings-on.</P>
<P>No matter. With Myers, Mini-Me and more delightfully gag-worthy gags than
"There's Something About Mary" -- a naughty shadow show and a coffee
pitcher full of feces blow low and lower -- these flaws hardly register.
"Austin" 1 did about $50 million at the box-office and then found an
audience of avid devotees upon its video release. With those folks now
foaming at the mouth over the prospect of future films, "Austin" 2 is
practically guaranteed to destroy the notion of diminishing returns. In
fact, from the wit, love and craft on display here, another "Austin"
adventure promises to generate the same solid hype and eager anticipation.
"Goldswinger," anyone?<HR> 1999 Jamie Peck

"Upon hearing word of this outrage, Star Wars' creator George Lucas (in
the throes of developing scripts for the two remaining Star Wars' films)
quickly removed all references to an upcoming character allegedly named
Stingy MacHaggis, a kilt-wearing alien who was to spend a good portion of
Episode II' drinking, picking fights and playing an alien musical
instrument that strongly resembled a set of bagpipes. He is to be replaced
by another alien character -- a formless, colorless and mute creature who
in no way resembles any culture or individual that ever existed or ever
will exist. --AAlgar on "The Phantom Menace"'s race-stereotyping
