<PRE>Love Letters (1945)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 67</PRE>
<P>"Love Letters" is an interesting soap opera and mystery
starring Joseph Cotten and Jennifer Jones.  It was the
third of five films that they made together.  The
sometimes spooky script was written by Ayn Rand, who
is better known for her later philosophical works.</P>
<P>Cotten writes love letters for war buddy and cad
Robert Sully.  Cotten falls in love with his unseen
pen pal, Jones.  The brief marriage between Jones and
Sully ends with Sully murdered and Jones suffering
from amnesia.  Cotten and Jones meet and wed, but
how will she react when her memory returns?  Will
she blame Cotten for writing the love letters that
set up her disastrous wedding to Sully?</P>
<P>Jones and Cotten had good screen chemistry.  Jones
had an other-worldly quality, while Cotten's persona
was world-weary.  They manage to overcome a soapy
plot.  There is much melodrama made over Jones' amnesia
and recovery, while Jones' mother (Gladys Cooper)
makes an unlikely complete recovery from a stroke
that left her unable to speak.</P>
<P>"Love Letters" met with some some success from the
Academy, with Jones receiving an Oscar nomination for
Best Actress.  The film was also nominated for its sets.
Jones was nominated for Best Actress for four consecutive
years, 1944 through 1947.  She would marry legendary
producer David O. Selznick in 1949.</P>
