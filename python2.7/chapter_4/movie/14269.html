<P>
The only thing surprising about "Saving Private Ryan" is how conventional
it is. I fully expected a much more "noir" vision of WWII along the lines
of Oliver Stone's "Platoon." What I saw was an updated version of such
1950s classics as "Walk in the Sun," written by Robert Rossen, the CP'er
who named names.</P>
<P>"Walk in the Sun," also known as "Salerno Beachhead," just about defines
this genre. A group of GI's are out on a patrol and they get killed off one
by one. The enemy is faceless and evil. Our soldiers, by the same token,
are good boys who are just trying to get home. The reason that CP'ers were
so adept at turning out this sort of patriotic pap is that they had bought
into the myth of FDR's "fight for freedom." So patriotic were the CP'ers
that they also backed the decision to intern Japanese-Americans.</P>
<P>The buzz about Spielberg's movie is clearly related to his decision to make
battle wounds much more graphic than ever before. This decision roughly
parallels the breakthrough made by Bertolucci in "Last Tango in Paris" to
depict sexuality openly and honestly. The question of what is more
jarring--Brando in full-frontal nudity or a soldier's intestines spilling
out of his midsection--I will leave to others.</P>
<P>A war movie ultimately relies on the same dramatic tensions as slasher or
science-fiction movies. The audience is at the edge of its seat waiting for
the next sniper's bullet to tear through the flesh of one of the "good
guys." The suspense is similar to that which awaits us for the next moment
when "Halloween's" Michael Myers will come barreling out of a closet with a
kitchen knife in hand. Who will get slashed in the throat next? The most
interesting variation on this theme is the film "Aliens" which blends
monsters from outer space and "Walk in the Sun" war movie conventions. The
acid-spitting  monsters of this film are stand-ins for Nazis or Japs. All
the soldiers want to do is complete "their job" successfully and return
home, in this case planet Earth.</P>
<P>Since the aesthetic dimensions of "Saving Private Ryan" are so
underwhelming, the more interesting question becomes one of Steven
Spielberg's motivation in turning out such a retro movie. What would compel
a director working in 1998 to recycle themes from the immediate post-WWII
period?</P>
<P>It is not really too hard to figure out. When Spielberg is not turning out
escapist fantasies like the lovely "ET" or "Close Encounters of the Third
Kind," he is functioning as a latter-day Frank Capra spinning out morality
tales to mold public opinion.</P>
<P>Movies like "Amistad," "Schindler's List" and "Saving Private Ryan" all
basically put forward the same message, namely that the wealthy and the
powerful are the ultimate guardians of what's decent and humane. In
"Amistad," this role is assigned to John Quincy Adams who stands up for the
slaves. In "Schindler's List," it is the industrialist who delivers the Jews.</P>
<P>General George Marshall, while a secondary character in "Saving Private
Ryan," puts the dramatic narrative into motion through his decent and
humane decision to remove Private James Ryan from the battlefield after his
three brothers have been killed in action. Marshall tells his fellow
officers that he didn't want to be in the same situation that faced Lincoln
when he informed a mother that all of her sons had been killed in Civil War
fighting.</P>
<P>Once this decision is reached, Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) and a group of
soldiers are sent on their way to track down Private Ryan and send him back
home. Their trek through hostile territory is familiar territory to anybody
who has sat through the 1950s classics. Unfortunately, "Saving Private
Ryan" does not even achieve the level of character development of a film
like "Walk in the Sun." The stories about life back home are much more
interesting in Rossen's screenplay. This should not come as any great
surprise because the Hollywood Reds were some of the most accomplished
writers ever to work in tinseltown.</P>
<P>Standing above this film like a canopy are a whole set of assumptions about
American "decency." Not only is General George Marshall decent enough to
rescue a single GI from the fighting, the GI's themselves are also more
decent than the despicable Nazis. There is one plot device that drives this
point home. Hank's men have captured a German soldier. They want to kill
him but Hanks says that this would not be right and sends him off. In the
climax of the film, this soldier turns up again and plunges a knife into
one of the "good guys" in hand-to-hand combat. After he is captured once
again, a GI shoots him in cold blood. The moral of the story is that it is
forgivable to shoot Germans in this manner because they are embodiments of
pure evil, just as they were in "Schindler's Tale,"</P>
<P>There is no doubt that Spielberg decided to make such a patriotic movie
because he is concerned about the widespread erosion of confidence in
elected officials in American society. Warren Beatty, another Hollywood
mover-and-shaker, tackled the same job in "Bulworth." "Bulworth" attempts
to restore people's belief in the system by holding up a "contrary"
politician as an example. This politician decides to tell the truth no
matter what. This, of course, is pure Capra territory.</P>
<P>The reason that WWII is so important to Spielberg is that this period was
the last time when genuine national unity prevailed. People rallied around
their President and were willing to lie down their lives. Good workers were
like good soldiers. They went to work in the factories without demanding
"excess" raises. Anybody who struck during WWII was a traitor. After WWII
the "bad guys" changed identity. No longer was it the sneering blond beast
of the Wehrmacht. Instead it was the fanatical Chinese soldier or Russian
superspy.</P>
<P>In order to get people thinking in this mode once again, Spielberg can not
churn out conventional narratives of the 1950s style. Instead they have to
be gussied up with trendy camera work and a pulsating film score. It is
also necessary to draft the most likable actor in Hollywood to play the
lead. If there is one thing you can say about Tom Hanks, it is that the
public finds him easy to like. Although speaking for myself I would have to
say that after Hanks's recent gee-whiz promotion of Nazi party official
Werner Von Braun's NASA and this lateest patriotic pap served up by
Spielberg, it seems like he is angling to become the new John Wayne.</P>
