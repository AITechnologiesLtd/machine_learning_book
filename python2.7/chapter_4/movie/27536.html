YI YI
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>YI YI, by Taiwanese writer and director Edward Yang, would be translated 
ONE ONE in English.  The American distributors have chosen instead the 
less literal English title of A ONE AND A TWO, probably because the 
movie is about the rhythms of life.  Although voted best picture of the 
year by one association of film critics, it is hardly that.  While 
certainly not a bad picture, it is a long, meandering one that is rarely 
compelling.  Still, with its artistic filming -- most conversations are 
intriguingly shot from a medium or long distance -- it is easy to see 
how critics might fall in love with it.</P>
<P>The relatively formless, slice-of-life plot follows a large number of 
characters.  While the performances are all genuine, the script has 
trouble eliciting either tears or laughs from the audience.  Even though 
the story isn't all it could be, Wei-han Yang's cinematography is 
exemplary from start to finish.  Most fascinating are the scenes shot 
through the glass of moving cars.  As we watch the reflected skyscrapers 
pass by, we listen to the conversation going on inside the cars.</P>
<P>The central character of the grandmother (Tang Ruyun) appears mainly 
comatose.  After falling tragically ill, she becomes a vegetable 
confessor for her family.  Throughout the story, people come to her to 
bare their souls, not knowing if she can hear them or not.   Her 
daughter, Min-Min (Elaine Jin), tells her with despair, "I live a 
blank."  Her son-in-law, NJ (Nien-Jen Wu), whose company is failing, 
tells her, "Frankly, there's very little I'm sure about these days."</P>
<P>8-year-old Yang-Yang (Jonathan Chang) is the film's most indelible 
character.  Having one of the wisest conversations that you've ever 
heard from a child of his age, he points out to his father that they can 
never really quite understand each other since they see different 
things.  Yang-Yang also argues that people can only see half of the 
truth since they can see in front of them but not behind.  </P>
<P>Least successful and more traditional are the canonically comical scenes 
like the one of kids dropping a water balloon on an unsuspecting 
passerby.  Other failed attempts at humor include Yang-Yang being 
falsely accused by his teacher of having a condom in his pocket -- it's 
actually a balloon -- and a noisy couple in the throws of passion heard 
through thin apartment walls.</P>
<P>Although it has its moments, YI YI is the type of movie that, if rented 
on tape, would be one that you would likely turn off after half an hour 
out of sheer lack of interest.  On the other hand, with an hour chopped 
off of its three bloated hours, who knows what might have been?  The 
potential is there.  </P>
<P>YI YI runs a very long 2:53.  The film is mainly in Mandarin with 
English subtitles.  It is not rated but would be an R for language and 
brief nudity and would be acceptable for teenagers.</P>
<P>The film is playing in limited release now in the United States.  In the 
Silicon Valley it is currently showing at the Towne Theatre in San Jose.</P>
