<PRE>                              NEVER BEEN KISSED
                         A movie review by Joe Barlow
                             (c) Copyright 1999</PRE>

<PRE>                   RATING: *  (out of a possible ****)</PRE>
<P>        "Never Been Kissed" is the sort of film that would thrill
the cast of "Mystery Science Theater 3000," the legendary
television show which has elevated the process of watching
horrible movies into an art form.  They'd have a field day with
this film's attempted sentimentality, its happy-go-lucky acting
style, and the numerous jokes which fall far short of anything so
blatant as outright humor.  They'd also likely appreciate the
story's attempts to bring warm and fuzzy cheeziness to every
convention it attempts to embrace.  Ah, thank you, movie.</P>
<P>        If you've seen the trailer, you basically know every twist
of the story.  Twenty-five year-old Josie Geller (Drew Barrymore)
is a junior editor for the Chicago Sun-Times, though she dreams
of pursuing her passion: writing.  Her editor doesn't think she's
ready to be a reporter, but she finally gets her big break thanks
to her youthful appearance.  Her mission: go undercover as a high-
school student and write a series of articles about the trials and
tribulations modern teens have to face on a daily basis.  It's a
choice assisgnment; if she does well, it could break her career
wide-open.</P>
<P>        The problem is, Josie is much too conservative and spastic
to be accepted into the elite cliques she's supposed to be milking
for story material; she is even, horror of horrors, considered
"uncool."  Because of her plain, unattractive features (yes, Drew
Barrymore is playing an ugly duckling-- more on this later), she
is relegated to the outskirts of the school's social circle,
eventually befriending a fellow nerd named Aldys (Leelee Sobieski
from "Deep Impact").  Aldys appears to be a sweet, highly-
intelligent girl, whose biggest problem is her unusual name.  "Try
being named after a guitar-playing pussycat," laments Josie in a
joke that apparently flew over the heads of the fourteen year-olds
who filled the theater at my advance screening.</P>
<P>        Even among the monsoon of wretchedness currently
playing at your local cinema, "Never Been Kissed" stands out
as a shining beacon of irrelevance, a shimmering tower of
"Who Cares?".  None of us are strangers to bad movies, but
even so, it's fairly rare to get one which is not only clueless,
formulaic, and obviously tailored to the lowest common
denominator, but completely oblivious to its own lack of merit
as well.  "Never Been Kissed," bless its little heart, actually
seems to think it's telling the audience an entertaining story,
rather than one full of stereotypes and the cinematic cliches
we've seen so many times before.  It's rather like watching
"Casablanca," as performed by a group of first-graders.  It's
crude, shallow, and insulting.  I have absolutely no doubt it
will make at least a hundred million dollars at the box office.</P>
<P>        As anyone who has seen the trailer already knows, Josie
eventually blossoms into a creature of grace and beauty.  No
surprise there, and the sooner the better: the scenes with the
"ugly" Josie are among the most unintentionally funny that I've
witnessed all year.  Barrymore looks like a woman desperately
trying to hide the fact that she's a knockout, rather like Rachel
Leigh Cook in "She's All That."  No amount of crusty hairdos or
horrid, overdone zombie-esque makeup can hide the fact that our
star is hot stuff, and the way the movie expects us to simply buy
into the fiction shows us just how low Hollywood's opinion of the
average moviegoer's mentality is.  (See also "The Truth About
Cats and Dogs," "Hope Floats," and the aforementioned "She's
All That.")  Nonetheless, we are subjected time and time again
to cheap gags involving Josie's confirmed "loser" status while
the film meanders slowly towards its utterly predictable
conclusion.</P>
<P>        One thought ran through my mind like a mantra as I watched
this movie: if you're an adult who's so insecure that you require
acceptance from a group of high-school students, you've got bigger
problems than never having been kissed.  The film asks us to cheer
for Josie, even as she tries to befriend a group of people who would
make Ace Ventura look like a Jedi master.  Poor Josie falls in love
twice, once with her teacher (Michael Valtan), and once with the
school's O.D.M.O.C. (Obligatory Dashing Man on Campus).  It's all
sweet and gooshy and smarmy, but I wonder how innocent it
would've felt if Josie had instead been a twenty-five year-old
guy, picking up a seventeen year-old schoolgirl under false
pretenses.  Would the teenyboppers in the audience still have
cheered at the conclusion of the film?  Probably not.  Double
standards are "cool," you know.</P>
