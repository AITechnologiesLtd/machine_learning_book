<PRE>MEGIDDO: THE OMEGA CODE 2
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>MEGIDDO: THE OMEGA CODE 2 is about old struggles: good vs. evil, feast vs.
famine, health vs. pestilence, nationalism vs. world government and benevolent
dictatorship vs. democracy.  It's also about the contrast between the
handsomeness of the film and the way that it's so overacted and ridiculously
scripted that it's sometimes kind of fun.</P>
<P>When we first meet Stone Alexander, he's a little devil, literally.  His first
overt act of destruction is to torch his baby brother while he is in his crib. 
With all of the emotive power of a department store mannequin, Gavin Fink plays
this younger Stone.  Chad Michael Allen isn't much better as Stone in his late
teens and early twenties.</P>
<P>The bulk of the story occurs when the grown-up Stone (Michael York) has just
gotten himself a promotion from head of the European Union to the first
Chancellor of the World Union.  His program consists of one world, one
government, one goal and one language -- hint, it's not Chinese.  The pesky
Americans balk at joining Stone's party.  As one of the presidential aide's puts
it, Stone is "Adolf Hitler but with an attitude."  I'll bet you thought that
Hitler had an attitude.</P>
<P>York, who is a quite capable actor perhaps best known for playing Tybalt in
Franco Zeffirelli's ROMEO AND JULIET, is incredibly bad as the older Stone.  Why
York felt he had to camp it up isn't clear since the movie clearly wants to be
taken seriously.  (The music, which doesn't have a subtle note, reinforces the
gravity of the situations.)  Much better is Michael Biehn, who play's Stone's
brother David, who survived his burning bed BBQ.  Diane Venora plays Stone's
wife, Gabriella, who finally parts with him when she catches him barfing bees.</P>
<P>Of course, the movie will move towards a cataclysmic conclusion that might mean
the end of the world.  That part contains my favorite scene as Stone sheds his
worldly body and becomes a really cool looking gargoyle.  It's a moment to
remember.</P>
<P>MEGIDDO: THE OMEGA CODE 2 runs 1:42.  It is rated PG-13 for "violence, warfare
and some thematic elements" and would be acceptable for kids around 10 and up.</P>
<P>The film opens in limited release in the United States today, Friday, September
28, 2001.  In the Silicon Valley, it is showing at the AMC theaters.</P>
