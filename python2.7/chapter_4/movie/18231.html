written and directed by Tony Bui</PRE>
<P>"Three Seasons" is being billed as the most acclaimed film in the
history of the Sundance Film Festival, having won three top awards,
including the prestigious Grand Jury Prize. Writer/director Tony Bui
and his film deserve all the praise that they have gotten for making
this breathtaking, heartbreaking drama.</P>
<P>The film is about dreamers; people with hopes and
aspirations. However, in war-torn Vietnam, the dreamers are
constrained by their poverty-stricken fate. "Three Seasons"
intertwines the stories of a cyclo driver, a prostitute, an American
G.I., a young woman, and a little boy. At first glance, the bunch
would seem to have nothing in common, but "Three Seasons" takes the
time to prove that they all are lost souls.</P>
<P>"Three Seasons'" cast is composed almost entirely of Vietnamese
newcomers, but Harvey Keitel (also one of the film's producers) shines
in a small role as a former American G.I. searching for his long-lost
daughter. The role is a small one, but Keitel's presence and warmth
add an extra layer of heartfelt emotion to an already complex,
multilayered production.</P>
<P>Among the Vietnamese cast, Don Duong radiates as a cyclo driver named
Hai who falls in love with a prostitute, and desires her love in
return. It is such a sweet, quiet performance, but it is one that,
like the rest of the film, is subtly heartbreaking.</P>
<P>Every character in "Three Seasons" has a desire; a hope. Whether it be
love, stability, or family that the character needs, writer/director
Tony Bui makes us feel just the right amount of compassion for each
one. In a way, "Three Seasons" leaves the viewer feeling somewhat
depressed. Each character will indeed fulfill their dream, but not
necessarily in the way in which one would expect.</P>
<P>The thing, however, that makes "Three Seasons" so groundbreaking,
apart from the fact that it's the first American film filmed entirely
in Vietnam, is that the Vietnamese, who, in modern American cinema
have been portrayed as the enemy we know nothing about (in so many
Vietnam War movies), finally get their own movie; a movie that proves
that even they have some heart and soul.</P>
<P>Tony Bui has handcrafted a flawless masterpiece; a gem that deserves
much more than its 3 Sundance Film Festival awards. "Three Seasons" is
a quiet film that will reward multiple viewers with its symbolism and
subtlety, and it will provide an emotional, but unsentimental
experience.</P>
