"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Actress Bonnie Hunt's first venture behind the camera is a cute romantic
comedy that is surprisingly light on the romance and heavy on the
comedy.  Hunt, who created her own hysterical but short-loved network
sitcom (called The Bonnie Hunt Show) several years ago, shows a natural
flair for comedic set-up and timing, but Return to Me isn't as
well-executed as it could have been.</P>
<P>The somewhat intriguing script, co-written with three other novices,
focuses on Bob and Elizabeth Rueland, a happily married Chicago couple
played by David Duchovny (The X-Files) and Joely Richardson (101
Dalmatians).  He's a successful building contractor and she works with
gorillas at the Lincoln Park Zoo.  The picture-perfect duo comes
complete with a big house, a pair of big noses and a big dog.  One
night, after a zoo fundraiser, the Ruelands are the apparent victims of
a car crash (it's not shown on screen).  Bob escapes with a few bumps
and bruises, but Elizabeth doesn't make it.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, far away, in another part of town, a young, single woman
named Grace Briggs (Minnie Driver, An Ideal Husband) lays on her
deathbed, desperately hoping to find a donor heart to extend her time
limit on this mortal coil.  Her best friend Megan (Hunt, The Green Mile)
watches over her in the hospital, while her grandfather Marty (Carroll
O'Connor, In the Heat of the Night) and his cronies keep good thoughts
for her as they run a business called O'Reilly's Italian Restaurant (the
funniest screen eatery since `The La Trattoria' from Mickey Blue Eyes).</P>
<P>Of course, Grace receives Elizabeth's heart and, over a year later, she
meets and falls in love with Bob.  Their romance is sweet and
predictable, but the lovebirds aren't on the screen as much as you might
expect.  Instead, Return seems to spend only about one-third of its
ample two-hour running time on Bob and Grace.  The remaining time is
divided between Hunt's Megan and her crazy family (including a loudmouth
husband played by James Belushi), and Grandpa Marty and his elderly
friends.</P>
<P>I kind of got the impression that Return's romance angle didn't play
well with test audiences, who clamored for more scenes with Megan's
family and the old coots.  Don't get me wrong; these two aspects of the
film are the best it has to offer, but I'm from the school of thought
that the two main characters should actually be on the screen more than
anybody else.  I'm guessing that nobody is going to see this movie with
the intention of hearing two Irishmen (O'Connor and Eddie Jones), an
Italian (Robert Loggia) and a Pole (Wally Jatczak) argue about who the
greatest crooner of all-time is – Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra or Bobby
Vinton.  It kind of smacks of the opening scene in Reservoir Dogs.</P>
<P>Duchovny does a pretty good job trying to ditch the stiff persona of his
television character but – c'mon – is he ever going to be anyone but Fox
Mulder?  Driver is very likeable as Grace, perpetually embarrassed of
the giant surgical scar that runs down her chest (and to think that some
men pay handsome subscription rates to `Scarred Skanks' magazine).  She
legitimately seems like she's in love, while Duchovny looks like he just
lost control of his bowels.</P>
