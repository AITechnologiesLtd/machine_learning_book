<PRE>"Lucky Numbers"</PRE>
<P>Russ Richards is the TV weatherman at WPTA in Harrisburg PA and a local
celebrity who has his own, reserved table at Denny's. He is also about to
lose his shirt in an unsuccessful snowmobile franchise as the city basks in
the spring-like December weather. Russ, desperate to avoid financial ruin,
teams up with the station's Lotto girl, Crystal Latroy (Lisa Kudrow), to
pull off a scam and rig the state's lottery. Everything works out,
initially, but the scheme unravels in a big way in "Lucky Numbers."</P>
<P>Nora Ephron, director of such sentimental schmarm as "Sleepless in Seattle"
and "You've Got Mail," takes a turn with "Lucky Numbers" and enters the
realm of the caper flick. Other such crime comedies, like the 1951 marvel,
"The Lavender Hill Mob," or the 1972 Robert Redford starrer, "The Hot
Rock," set the standard for the genre with their mixture of
action/suspense, satire and broad comedy. The charm of these films lay in
their strong build-up of the caper and the gyrations the principle must
undertake as the well-laid plans go awry.</P>
<P>Ephron's entry into the genre of crime caper movies, while not at the same
level as the older films, is a solid, entertaining flick that benefits from
a superb cast that transcends the formula of the script by Adam Resnick.
Based on the 1980 Pennsylvania State Lottery scandal, the story is by the
numbers as we meet Russ Richards, a man on top of the celebrity pile in his
little burg who enjoys the perks of his minor fame. His big ambition is to
get out of Harrisburg and head for the big times - host of his own TV game
show. But, bad investments, unseasonably warm weather and a taste of the
good life are driving Russ to bankruptcy.</P>
<P>First, Russ tries to get a salary advance form his hard-ass boss, Dick
Simmons, and is unceremoniously turned down. He next tries to hit up his
old buddy, Gig, a strip club owner, but gets turned down by him, too. Gig
does offer some advise, though it is highly illegal - find a beard to play
a particular Lotto number and rig the daily lottery to come up with that
number. And, it looks like it may be an easy thing when Russ approaches
Lotto girl Crystal, a sexy and greedy young lady, with the plan and she
jumps at the chance to make millions. The ball is in play, so to speak, as
the couple conspires to rip the state off for a fortune.</P>
<P>The inept pair, against all odds, is able to pull the scam off without a
hitch. Crystal's cousin Walter (documentary filmmaker Michael Moore) is
pulled in to be the front man, purchasing the winning ticket. Everything
seems to going fine as they successfully rig the drawing. Then things start
to fall apart. Walter, realizing the ticket's worth, is no longer happy
with the paltry $20000 he was first offered. He wants an equal share of the
winnings and won't give up the ticket unless he gets it. Gig also wants a
piece of the pie and demands a 20% cut of the total. Then, a local bookie
gets wind of the scheme, prompting Gig to have the guy bumped off by his
crony, the loony Dale the Thug (Michael Rapaport). Once Dale finishes his
lethal task, he demands $500000 from the hapless, now scared, Russ. Things
are further complicated when a malingering cop, Pat Lakewood (Bill
Pullman), and his gung-ho partner Chambers (Daryl Mitchell) are put on the
case of the missing bookie. Another wrench hits the works when station boss
Dick figures out the crime and wants half of the money. Soon, Russ is
financially worse off than before he committed the crime.</P>
<P>Despite the large cast of characters, the movie moves along at a brisk pace
as the crime and its aftermath of greed unfold and Russ finds himself in a
place, among ruthless people, that he just wants out of. Travolta, who
seems to be beefing up to Marlon Brando proportions, plays Russ Richards
with a mix of confidence of a big fish in the small pond of Harrisburg TV
and fear of losing everything when his plans backfire. He's fine while in
control of things, but breaks down quickly when they go to hell in a hand
basket. Travolta is the straight man of the cast, but gets good moments as
he tries, and repeatedly fails, to get out of his predicament.</P>
<P>The rest of the cast ably handles their various tasks. Kudrow plays
completely out of her usual ditzy characters as the hard-bitten, greedy
Lotto babe who thinks nothing of using her body to get what she wants. It's
a different kind of roll for Kudrow, though not one I necessarily liked -
Crystal may be good looking, but she is no Mother Theresa. Tim Roth and Ed
O'Neill lend their professionalism to their perfs as Gig and Dick. The real
comic relief, though, comes from Michael Rapaport and Bill Pullman.
Rapaport's Dale is over-the-top crazy as a very loose canon. Dale, and his
World Series commemorative baseball bat, does drastic damage to the various
players. He's all hopped up on wine coolers and anti-depressants and will
not take "no" for an answer. He's also not very bright as he tries to get
rid of Jerry the bookie by taping a small brick to his wrist and dumps the
body in the river. Pullman has some goofy fun as the inept cop who
unwittingly breaks the case.</P>
<P>I have never been a fan of Nora Ephron's film work, but I have to admit
that the lady does surround herself with top-notch talent behind the
camera. The capable and varied lensing by John Lindley ("Pleasantville")
gives the film a crisp look. Production designer Dan Davis, a three-time
Ephron collaborator, catches the 80's feel, though that period is less
distinctive than the 60's and 70's. Other tech tasks are also well handled.</P>
<P>"Lucky Numbers" isn't hurt by the formula story and benefits greatly from
the talented cast. There is ample humor, though little suspense. Nora
Ephron proves herself a competent filmmaker and takes on the crime caper
with professional ability. It's not as wild and wacky as "The Hot Rock" (a
film I highly recommend), but it has its moments and its laughs. I had a
good time and give it a B-.</P>
