<P>Reese Witherspoon, one of the brightest, most intelligent young actresses in 
Hollywood, has been around ever since her feature debut at 14 in 1991's 
nostalgic "Man in the Moon." Solid star turns followed in 1996's "Fear," 
1996's "Freeway," 1998's "Pleasantville," 1999's "Cruel Intentions," and 
1999's "Election," but never before has she had an entire movie rest solely 
upon her shoulders--until now. </P>
<P>"Legally Blonde," the directing bow of Robert Luketic, is an intentionally 
frothy, good-natured comedy about female empowerment and getting to show your 
true colors in a cynical society. At the forefront is Witherspoon, in a role 
that is perfectly tailor-made for her sturdy comedic talents, and she shines 
in every second of its entertaining, fast-paced 96 minutes. </P>
<P>Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon), no doubt named after the magazine, is about 
to graduate from college with a 4.0 GPA and a degree in fashion 
merchandising. She also expects to get a marriage proposal from her longtime 
boyfriend, Warner Huntington III (Matthew Davis), when, instead, he dumps her 
due to not believing that she would make an acceptable senator's wife. 
Distraught over this unexpected turn of events, Elle decides to follow Warner 
to Harvard with her beloved Chihuahua in tow, where she will major in law and 
prove him wrong about just being a "dumb blonde." </P>
<P>This is the clever setup of "Legally Blonde," a sunny, hip confection that 
uses 1995's delightful "Clueless" as an indirect blueprint. The screenplay, 
scribed by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith (1999's "10 Things I Hate 
About You"), is spunky and very sweet, but the film really would sink or swim 
based on its leading lady. </P>
<P>Luckily, just the right one was chosen and Witherspoon is up for the 
challenge, turning Elle into a positive, well-meaning heroine for the 
21st-century who proves looks are, indeed, only skin-deep. Elle may be a 
beautiful girl with a keen fashion sense, but the key to her appeal is that 
she is a genuinely good person, plain and simple. Witherspoon wins you over 
from the very beginning, much like Alicia Silverstone did in "Clueless," 
because she's cute, funny, and isn't self-involved like you may expect from 
the way she looks. No, Elle does things her way, and she'll be damned if 
she's going to change just because people think she should. </P>
<P>The aforementioned script is a particularly smart one, alternately satirical 
and down-to-earth when it needs to be. Elle's application tape into Harvard, 
which she got "one of the Copolla's to direct," for example, is both winning 
and silly, with her proving that she can successfully use proper legal jargon 
("I object!," she exclaims as a passerby touches her backside), as well as 
hold inordinately huge amounts of information in her head by rattling off the 
various current storylines on the soap opera, "One Life to Live." Late in the 
picture, as the action turns toward a murder trial, writers Lutz and Smith 
hilariously incorporate the usual court matters with significant plot points 
concerning designer shoes and the proper way to manage a new perm. </P>
<P>The actors around Witherspoon fall into two categories--those that are nice 
to Elle, and those that aren't. Jennifer Coolidge (Stifler's mom in 1999's 
"American Pie") is notably charming in the type of part she's never played 
before--a shy manicurist who befriends Elle when nobody else initially does. 
Selma Blair (2000's "Down to You") does well as Warner's new brunette 
girlfriend at Harvard, at first coming off as stuck-up before feeling remorse 
about the way she has wronged Elle. Finally, Luke Wilson (1999's "Blue 
Streak") does what he can with the underwritten role of Elle's new potential 
love interest. Not enough time is spent developing their relationship, and it 
is one of the few missteps that is made throughout. </P>
<P>The journey that Elle takes as she sets out to reclaim her beau, only to 
discover that she is more than capable of standing on her own two feet, is a 
predictable one, as is the outcome of the climactic murder trial. Then again, 
"Legally Blonde" makes no false accusations about being a deep or intricately 
plotted motion picture. It's a lighthearted, breezy comedy that is sure to 
gain Reese Witherspoon the full recognition she has deserved for years. And 
more so than anything else, it sure is a whole lot of fun. </P>
