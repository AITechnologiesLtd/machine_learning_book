<P>Honolulu detective Charlie Chan (Toler) comes aboard a boat embarking tomorrow
on a $60 million treasure hunt to the Cocos Island. An eccentric elderly woman
with a bad heart, Miss Nodbury, whose ancestors were pirates, has gotten this
hunt started and hired Captain Kane to take them there and Steve Daniels to make
all the passenger arrangements. But Miss Nodbury tells Charlie that she wants to
cancel the voyage because she suspects one of her partners is a thief. She also
tells Charlie that as a precaution she divided the map into four pieces as she
kept one part and three other passengers have the other parts, with her being
the only one who knows who has all the parts. </P>
<P>There's supposed to be no one aboard the ship, but all the passengers say they
received a call from Daniels to come aboard; though, Daniels denies ever making
such a call. When Kate Ransome, the typist girlfriend of Daniel screams at the
sight of Charlie's Number One Son moaning from a closed box and Miss Nodbury
doesn't come out of her cabin-- Charlie investigates her room and finds her dead
and her part of the map missing. He says she died of fright at seeing a ghost of
the pirate Black Hook, as someone purposely scared her to get the map--which
makes this a murder case. </P>
<P>The boat remains at the dock, as Charlie keeps everyone on the ship. Every
passenger becomes a suspect: Bill Lydig (Steve Reeves-none other than the one
who is later on to play Superman) poses as a reporter, but Charlie quickly
figures out he's using the name of a dead reporter and is really a murderer on
the loose. Thomasson is a rare coin collector, but little else is known about
him. Doctor Anne Bonney is a shrink and she's treating a severly neurotic
patient Gene LaFarge, who exhibits strange behavior as he tries to overcome his
impulse to run away from things. Laura and Charles Thursday just got married and
have sneaked on board to neck in their cabin, unaware of the murder and the
screams. He's a movie actor, travelling incognito. Captain Kane is an embittered
man who says he doesn't like people, and has some dark secret. He refuses to
meet the passengers until the ship sails. </P>
<P>In this very convoluted script, the comedy comes from Number Two Son, Jimmy,
falling in the water a number of times when not getting locked in a box. Also,
LaFarge's strange mannerisms and Miss Nodbury's belief that her relative Black
Hook will come to her as a ghost when her time is up to take her to the other
world, adds some comic moments. It was not easy to figure out the killer, since
little was known of the killer. But, as is usually the case in this series, the
least likely one is the guilty party. It was entertaining to watch all the
spookiness aboard the ship, someone disguised as the pegleg Black Hook, and
Jimmy running around in the dark getting an innocent man arrested. But the story
itself made little sense. What was outstanding, was the atmospheric harbor
scenes. This gave the film an eerie feeling and made the fishy story seem less
briny. </P>
