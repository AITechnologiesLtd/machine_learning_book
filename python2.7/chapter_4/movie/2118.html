<PRE>                          THE AGE OF INNOCENCE
                       A film review by David Rind
                        Copyright 1993 David Rind</PRE>
<P>     THE AGE OF INNOCENCE is Martin Scorcese's new movie based on Edith
Wharton's story of the same name.</P>
<P>     It is set in late 19th Century New York City among the upper crust
of New York high society with scenes also taking place in Boston and
Newport.</P>
<P>     This is a complex and powerful drama.  The plot focuses on three
characters: Daniel Day-Lewis as a young lawyer, Winona Ryder as his
new fiancee, and Michelle Pfeiffer as Winona Ryder's cousin, who has
returned from Europe to escape a bad marriage.  Early in the movie it
becomes clear that the characters played by Day-Lewis and Pfeiffer are
falling in love, but societal constraints make such a match
impossible.  The story follows these characters as they try to
reconcile responsibilities with desires amid the hypocrisies of their
surrounding society.</P>
<P>     The performances are impeccable.  Winona Ryder seems somewhat cast
against type as the less intellectually interesting of the two women --
an odd role for an actress who has played some very intriguing female
characters in recent years -- but plays it skillfully.  Daniel
Day-Lewis is excellent as a decent man torn between love and
responsibility.  Michelle Pfeiffer is superb as ever.  Her character is
played with depth and complexity.  It must have been an extremely
challenging role, but she carries it off with ease.  Her appearance in
this picture could not help but conjure up images of her role in
DANGEROUS LIASONS where she played a very different sort of character
but where again, societal roles were of utmost importance.</P>
<P>     Scorcese lets the audience know that he is the director.  There
are some odd cuts, camera angles, and close-ups that seem to be
intended more to remind the audience of his existence than out of any
real benefit to the feel of the picture.  He does use recurring shots
of logs burning in a fireplace to very good effect.</P>
<P>     Supporting performances are also excellent, as is the use of music
and costumes.  Some of the settings shown are a fascinating glimpse of
how the east coast cities looked a century ago.</P>
<P>     The characterizations are intricate, and at the end of the movie
the group I saw this movie with disagreed about some of the possible
interpretations of motivations.  The characters all seemed remarkably
real and palpable, and behaved in ways that felt comprehensible to a
modern audience despite the setting in a society so superficially
different.  This is a story with something complex to say about romance
and responsibilities and made for a striking contrast with the story
told in the current bestseller "The Bridges of Madison County" which I
had recently read.</P>
<P>     This movie is also quite long, running for about two and a half
hours.  Before going into the film, I was warned by a friend who had
seen it the day before that it might be hard to stay awake.  I had no
problem with this, and was in no rush for the film to end.  It was
textured and complex and produced some interesting conversations
afterwards among the group that had seen it.  I strongly recommend this
movie.</P>
<PRE>Rating 9 out of 10.</PRE>
