<P>     In my line of work, the most fun you normally get is in the insult.
The good reviews, on the average, are trite, fairly boring items.  They say
the same things, over and over, and rarely give you a chance to have a
creative outlet.  The bad reviews, on the other hand, allow you to have lots
of fun.  The real challenge of the job is to insult a movie in the most
creative way possible, because, although insults run rampant in the world,
very few of them actually take time to use any brainpower.  They normally
come in formats as cliched as some of the films I review, and are equally
boring.</P>
<P>     Sadly, I cannot exercise my creative skills at insulting Get Shorty.
It was just too good of a movie to warrant that.  The thing that is most fun
about Get Shorty, however, is the way it insults the system of Hollywood.
Watching a movie like that, I feel like the movies themselves are replacing
my job: that maybe, maybe, Hollywood might start policing itself.</P>
<P>     The movie is a surprisingly post-modern tale: a shylock trying to
collect money from an idiot doing a scam on an airline ends up in LA and
pitches a movie to another person he's collecting from.  What's the pitch?
A shylock is trying to collect money from an idiot doing a scam on an
airline.  By the end of Get Shorty, you swear you just saw a true story play
out in front of you, but one that poetic license has made completely
hilarious.</P>
<P>     The movie opens with plot and conflict brewing.  `Chili' Palmer (John
Travolta) is having a conversation with a friend in Miami on the coldest day
of the year… the temperature is a chilly 34.  Palmer's jacket is stolen by
Ray `Bones' Balbone (Dennis Farina), and Chili quickly steals it back,
breaking his nose in the process.  Bones tries to kill Chili, but almost
gets his hairline shot off instead.</P>
<P>     Chili heads off to Las Vegas to collect a debt, then heads to LA in
further pursuit, having picked up an additional debt on the way.  In LA, he
hooks up with B-movie producer Harry Zimm (Gene Hackman) and his
scream-file-star girlfriend Karen  (Rene Russo).  All of a sudden, he
decides he wants to produce a movie, that is, with the help of Zimm.</P>
<P>     Only one problem: Zimm already owes money to another, LA,
 `Variety'-Reading, loan shark.  One with seventy dollar a yard carpet, a
stuntman for a hood, and an idiot for muscle.  Meantime, he's working on a
drug deal with an idiot named YaYa who thinks that ten year olds in the
airport are actually DEA agents guarding a bag full of $500,000.  Not to
mention Bones is hot on Chili's trail trying to get even with Chili, and
Chili is falling in love with Karen while trying to produce his first
Hollywood feature film.</P>
<P>     As normal, Elmore Leonard's seemingly out of control story has a
direction, a steady plot, and a nice, tidy ending.  Everything comes
together at the end, but it looks messy beforehand.  In between, we're
granted a black satire of the Hollywood system where a loan shark decides to
go into the movie business and seems to know more about it than a seasoned
pro.  Scott Frank does his normal great of capturing a novel so out of
control and transferring it onto the screen without gift-wrapping it for us.
So many of today's adaptations are made nice and neat and ruined in the
process.</P>
<P>     Barry Sonnenfield does an especially good job: his camera follows Chili
everywhere, and his use of the stedicam augments the fast storyline to make
the film itself seem as fast-paced as a baby's heartbeat.</P>
<P>     Like I said, I like to insult.  But I can't do it with this film, this
satire did it for me, taking on the Hollywood system and organized crime
alike and still coming out very funny.  Definitely see it.</P>
