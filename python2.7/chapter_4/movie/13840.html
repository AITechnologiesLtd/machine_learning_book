<P>EDITORIAL: Saving Private Spielberg
by Luke Buckmaster (<A HREF="mailto:bucky@alphalink.com.au">bucky@alphalink.com.au</A>)</P>
<P>Through the years, Steven Spielberg has proved that he can not only
deliver special effects fueled thrillers (Jaws, Jurassic Park), but also
emotionally invigorating films (ET, Schindlers List).  Although his
other recent piece, Amistad, was one of the worst films he has made in
the 80's and 90's, Spielberg has received much critical acclaim for
Saving Private Ryan.  With any luck, this film will strengthen the
notion that mainstream cinema can still produce its fair share of
masterpieces, and that movie-goers do not necessarily have to resort to
watching Indie or art house films for a good amount of substance.
Recent examples The Truman Show, Titanic and Gattaca have proved that
brilliance can still be found in popular films.</P>
<P>The film depicts the tale of eight men on a mission to save one during
World War II.  If Spielberg has pieced it together correctly, Saving
Private Ryan may just install similar shell-shocked responses that films
like Gallipoli and Schindlers List were renown, and feared for.  If you
have seen either of these films at the cinema, you may have experienced
something similar to what I did - as the credits rolled onto the screen,
the audience was silent. Silent perhaps because of the sheer power of
the subject material, silent because of guilt that the human race could
ever have allowed these horrific events to occur, or simply because no
one wanted to spoil the moment.  And what a moment it was.</P>
<P>Unlike some of his early films, Spielberg has a wide range of talented
crewmembers to strengthen his creation.  Hollywood icon Tom Hanks is
amongst one of the finer actors in the industry, having excellent
performances in Philadelphia and Forest Gump (as well as many others)
under his belt.  In the production side of things, Spielberg has chosen
some of the best: cinematographer Janusz Kaminksi (Schindlers List, The
Lost World), composer John Williams (all three Star Wars films, JFK,
Jurassic Park) and film editor Michael Kahn (Empire of the Sun,
Schindlers List).  As you can see, their records are impressive to say
the least.</P>
<P>Spielberg began his directing career in the late fifties with The Last
Gun (a barely known western) in a very different industry.  Back then,
the phrase "you'll never work in this town again" actually meant
something - the studios were family based and perhaps a perfect example
of corrupt-but-correct organizations.  Although anyone could not just
make a film without any problems (or rather, any person not affiliated
with the industry); all that a potential director needed to do was share
his or her ideas with a small bunch of people.  Nowadays, there are
hundreds of people who can say no for funding a film, and a small group
of people who can say yes.  And this is for obvious reasons, with the
amount of crap that manages to barge its way into contemporary cinema.</P>
<P>But any film with the name "Spielberg" attached to it is bound to get
the go ahead.  From first looks, Saving Private Ryan seems like it may
be some of Steven's best work.  But that would be an awfully hard feat
to accomplish, as this man has carved some unforgettable screen moments,
revolutionary accouchements, and a few truly magnificent masterpieces
that demonstrate the versatility and power of the whole cinematic
experience.  Hopefully, Private Spielberg will deliver the goods once
again.</P>
