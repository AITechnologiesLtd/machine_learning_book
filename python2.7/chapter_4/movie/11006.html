<P>
The Replacement Killers could have been a good, solid action movie.
It could have been a sleeper hit; a movie that decided to break a few
rules and be original and inventive.  Instead it's a boring,
forgettable movie that'll be out of theaters in a few weeks.</P>
<P>It's the American debut of Chow Yen Fat, who's Hong Kong films The
Killer and Hard Boiled made him the best action star in the movies
today.  He has a grace about his characters: he can be somber and
confident at the same time.  When you compare him to American action
stars he seems more real, more identifiable.  After his international
success, he came to Hollywood and was wasted.  While he does manage to
walk out of The Replacement Killers with his reputation intact, but
everything else around him was a waste.  It also stars Mira Sorvino,
who plays your standard breaking the law loner who does everything her
way and fakes passports to make ends meet.  She's totally unbelievable
here and spends most of her time trying to convince us that she's
tough and knows how to shoot a gun.  To describe the plot is to waste
your time and lower your I.Q.  You don't pay attention to the details
in a movie like this, you don't follow the plot holes.  Things like
that will only frustrate you.  Instead, you wait for the action scenes
to come up (there's about five or six), you wait to see the skin shot
of Mira Sorvino (there's only one).  The action scenes were passable,
though they tended to get old after awhile.  Director Anotoine Fuqua
puts a little bit of style in the movie, he tries to give the movie an
Asian feel.  But his problem is that you don't really know if he's
spoofing Fat's movies, or if he's taking them seriously.  There's a
moment towards the end of the movie where Fat makes a stand-off with
the main mean bad guy.  The bad guy is driving down an alley in his
limo (because bad guys always ride in limos in movies like this), the
gates to his fortress open, and there stands Fat, holding seven or
eight handguns. Whether or not it was supposed to be funny, half the
theater laughed.  Fat didn't look confident, he looked ridiculous.</P>
<P>Rather than watch The Replacement Killers, rent Fat's best action
films, The Killer or Hard Boiled.  Those movies also brought director
John Woo to Hollywood.  Woo's first film was a bomb in Hard Target .
Hollywood let him stick around and he eventually made the successful
and acclaimed Face/Off.  Let's hope Fat gets the same chance.</P>
<P>The Replacement Killers (* and half out four).  Directed by Antoine
Fuqua.  Starring: Chow Yen Fat, Mira Sorvino.</P>
