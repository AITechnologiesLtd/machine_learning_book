<PRE>INSIDE EDGE
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>When the film features Richard Lynch in the role of chief
villain, you know that you can expect nothing more than a B
grade action movie. However, since this film also featured
Michael Madsen, more than capable character actor, this time
in the role of protagonist, the author of this review
decided to give the film some benefit of the doubt. However,
the very first scenes show clear B grade action credentials
- Madsen plays Richard Montana, tough policeman who raids a
drug warehouse and make life miserable for local crime lord
Mario Gio (played by Lynch). However, the raid was only
partially successful, and Montana is getting the rap. So, he
begins his own private war against Gio, trying to penetrate
his organisation pretending to be corrupt. In the process,
he meets Gio's mistress Gina Zamora (played by Rosie Vela)
and starts relationship with her too.</P>
<P>Although it doesn't stink like many of the similar films
can, INSIDE EDGE is mostly forgettable B grade action
routine. Nobody in this film actually puts much effort,
including Madsen or Lynch, and this is especially case with
uninspired screenwriter William Tannen or director Warren
Clarke. The only not so forgettable element in this film is
presence of former supermodel Rosie Vela, who, apart from
showing her more than impressive looks, shows some of the
singing talent too. However, this isn't reason enough for
viewers to spend hour and half watching a film that they
would, in most likelihood, forget the next day.</P>
