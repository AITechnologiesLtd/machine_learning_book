<PRE>A SOLDIER'S DAUGHTER NEVER CRIES (1998)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1999 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: James Ivory
Writers: James Ivory and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala (based on the novel by
Kaylie Jones)

Bradford, Anthony Ruth Costanzo, Dominique Blanc, Jane Birkin, Virginie
Ledoyen, Samuel Gruen, Luisa Conlon, Isaach de Bankolé, Nick Nolte</P>
<P>"A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries" is a beautifull shot and beautifully
memorable film, crafted like it was a series of episodes from one life,
divided into three sections of emotional maturity.  It just so happens
that that's exactly what its source is.  Adapted from the
semi-autobiographical novel by Kaylie Jones, daughter of famous American
war scribe, James Jones (author of "Red Badge of Courage" and "The Thin
Red Line"), this film has been meticulously created to be episodic in
structure, and more like distant remembrances than actual emotional
involvement.  And like all films like this, it not only involves in the
story at hand, but it forces us to remember our own pasts, and what has
shaped us to be the person that we are at the moment.</P>
<P>As a skematic for a person's current life, "A Soldier's Daughter Never
Cries" is never fully complete, and there are moments where we don't
understand the lead's motives until the moment she makes her choices.
As a tragedy, which what it would be in the hands of others, it's
unfulfilling, and little subplots (like the daughter's relationship with
her brother) are never totally together.  And there are more than a
couple notable ends left dangling in the wind.  But that's exactly how
it has been designed to be: just the right amount of judgment on
situations with a twist of emotion.  The events of the film are told in
an almost distant tone, but what transpires from them become exactly
like happy/sad memories.  For instance, the story's plot is supposed to
be about a family who has lived most of their life in France coming back
to America, where the teenage children have to assimilate, but it never
feels like that is the actual point of this story.  It feels more like a
woman at an older, more mature age rereading her diary she kept when a
young girl.</P>
<P>The woman, renamed Channe Willis (played at a young age by Luisa
Conlon), is first seen living in Paris with her parents, author Bill
(Kris Kristoferson) and beautiful wife Marcella (Barbara Hershey), when
they adopt a young child named Benoit (played at a young age by Samuel
Gruen), who was the son of a young french woman (Virginie Ledoyen), too
young to keep him.  Benoit happily renames himself after his new father,
and becomes best friends with Channe.  Once grown up to about the age of
14, the two have drifted apart and Channe (now played by Leelee
Sobieski) befriends an affeminate boy named Francis (Anthony Ruth
Costanzo) at her multi-lingual school, and the two become inseperable,
isolating Billy (Jesse Bradford).  Slowly and methodically, Francis gets
on her nerves, though, distancing himself from her until he finally
confesses his undying love for her in an idiosyncratic and touching
scene.</P>
<P>But throughout, despite who is the closest man or boy in her life, her
father always lingers over her.  Though a notorious drunkard and being
totally and hilarious redneck, Kristoferson brilliantly crafts Bill into
the most wonderfully paternal figure of the year.  He's gruff and
intimidating but he's also bizarrely charming and approachable.  When
his health begins to fail a bit, he decides he wants to move back to
America, and his children react differently to the massive change.
Channe becomes promiscuous, and Billy becomes a loafer, watching TV
constantly, a bag of chips never being far away.</P>
<P>As her father's days near an end due to a mortal illness, they become
even closer: she confesses her promiscuous ways to him, and he takes it
matter-of-factly.  When she becomes serious over a boy, and they get to
the point that they want to sleep together, Bill shocks both of them by
suggesting they sleep in her bed, under the same roof - "If they're
gonna do it, they might as well do it right."</P>
<P>This film is chock full of moments like that, the moments that become
memorable not only to the people who live through them, but to those who
observe silently.  And throughout the film, we get the picture that this
family is completely unique, like all families.  They're close yet still
comfortably distant, and all are respective of eachother, even when they
have fits of selfish rage (on New Years Eve, Marcella lays a massive
head trip on her daughter the likes of which I hope I never have to
endure personally).  This is all told in the reserved, matter-of-fact
manner that Merchant Ivory productions have been acclaimed for.  They
tell their plot points flat out, without a whole lot of production, but
then quietly observe the little emotional attachments that come along
with them.  "The Remains of the Day" would be such a boring flick if it
hadn't been for the way they quietly observed the Anthony Hopkins
character, and brought out his inner demons (that's also thanks to
Hopkins, of course).  Well, they work the same way for the characters in
"A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries."  They observe Channe, and all those
around her, especially her father, a man who borders on flawless legend
and down-to-earth flawed human being.</P>
<P>The acting is simplistic and pretty incredible.  Sobieski, totally
annoying in her past films like "Jungle 2 Jungle" and "Deep Impact," is
totally fascinating to watch here (this gives me hopes for her
supporting turn in the upcoming Kubrick film).  Hershey hasn't been this
good in years.  And Kristoferson gives the performance of his life, at
least as to what I've seen of him (which means, I guess, that this is
his best performance, followed by "Big Top Pee Wee").  As notoriously
redneck as he is, he shows that he's a totally lovable actor, and if
there's some special award for "Best Performance by an Actor Who We All
Thought Had Very Little Talent Previously," hands down it'd go to
Kristoferson.  He and the other actors make this all seem real, and
that's the reason this film is so entertaining to watch.  A film like
this reminds us how little plot matters in certain films - it just
matters how much it affects us with the little things, and the memories
it gives us after the film has been long over.</P>
