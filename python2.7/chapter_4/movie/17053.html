187 (Reviewed on March 6/99)</PRE>
<PRE>Starring Samuel L. Jackson</PRE>
<P>In "187", Samuel L. Jackson stars as a teacher in the inner city.  As
the movie opens, he's been attacked by one of his former students and 
left for dead.  Cut to several months later, he's recuperated and ready
to start teaching again.  He's transfered to an even more dangerous
high school, but this does not faze Jackson.  No, it does not faze him
because he is going to Change the System.  He's an idealist.  And the
fact that all his pupils wield weapons of some kind doesn't bother him.
He believes that there is some good in everyone, even if they stab you
11 times in the back with a knife.</P>
<P>Pardon my facetious tone, but the first half of "187" is so cliched, so 
over-wrought that one can't help but be a little cynical about it.
It takes virtually every element generally found in films of this 
calibre ("Dangerous Minds" and "Stand and Deliver" being the most 
prominent examples).</P>
<P>Fortunately, after that rather unoriginal beginning, the film takes an
unexpected turn that quite frankly I hadn't predicted.  Not to give too
much away, Jackson eventually tires of all the abuse and begins to 
fight back.  In other films of this type, the hero-teacher ends up
"saving" the bad kids and everyone's happy.  Not so in "187".  Ol'
Sammy completely loses his cool after a certain point and starts
kicking some serious ass.</P>
<P>I appreciated that aspect of "187".  Just when I thought I had the
whole story figured out, the screenwriter throws a rather large
spanner in the works.  Predictability is a big problems with most movies
these days, so it was nice to have a movie that kept me guessing as to
what would happen next and also as to how the film would end.  Another
nice touch is the directing by Kevin Reynolds.  He's shot the film in
mostly brown colours, which only adds to the feeling of desperation
Jackson's character is experiencing.  I also liked how, in one moment
of rage, the camera following Jackson began shaking.  I'd never seen
anything like that, and in this age of Michael Bay-type of nonsensical
camera pyrotechnics, it was nice to see a director use his camera as
an instrument to further display the emotions of his characters, rather
than as a tool to "excite" the audience.</P>
<P>"187", much like the "Death Wish" series, got a little carried away
as it progressed, but nevertheless, it's an entertaining look at how
deeply violence can affect a regular person.</P>
<PRE>*** out of ****</PRE>

in "The People vs Larry Flynt"."
