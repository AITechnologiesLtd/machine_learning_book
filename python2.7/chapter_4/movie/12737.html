<P>"Shooting Fish" is a delightful romantic comedy with a strong cast.  Dylan
(Futterman) and Jez (Townsend) are orphans, the first American and the
second British.  They grew up in similar circumstances (in orphanages) and
with similar desires (their own house, a place to create the home neither
had as a child). Dylan, who is dyslexic and relies on Jez to help him jot
down addresses and other notes, is "Mr. Personality" and can charm the most
hardened executive. Jez, a technological genius, claims to have received a
degree in the "Psychology of Electronics," can repair anything electronic,
but is as socially inept as the stereotypical Silicon Valley wonk.</P>
<P>While they are both intelligent, even brilliant, neither has found his
niche in society.  The two, who are as close as brothers, get along
famously.  Unable to succeed in the real world, they have made a career of
confidence games, cleverly bilking unsuspecting and gullible (but always
wealthy) individuals and companies.  They see themselves as modern-day
Robin Hoods, robbing the rich (who don't really need the relatively small
amounts they pilfer) for the sake of the poor -- in this case, orphans.</P>
<P>Things start to go awry shortly after their success leads them to hire a
temporary secretary/assistant Georgie (Beckinsale).  Georgie is a young
medical student, betrothed to a wealthy businessman.  While Georgie is
initially taken in by Dylan and Jez's stories, she begins to doubt their
stories.  At the same time, she is attracted to both of them -- and both of
them, to her.</P>
<P>Between Dylan and Jez's schemes, which grow ever more complex, and
Georgia's own financial problems, the plot grows more complicated.  The
script, written by Stefan Schwartz and Richard Holmes, is witty and treads
a fine line between being too clever for its own good and too obvious.  As
the characters find their way into and out of trouble, their conflicting
means begin to coincide in a single end.</P>
<P>The movie is marked by several visual cliches that let the audience know
the production crew is enjoying its work.  Beckinsale steals the show as
the young fiancee torn between her responsibilities, her choices, and her
heart.  The interplay of the three main characters is utterly entertaining.</P>
