<P>Stigmata was marketed as horror, when it's not. It's a religious thriller.
There is a difference. Whereas (good) horror startles and disturbs you, the
religious thriller unseats you, unsettles you. Doesn't make you leave the
light on. Think Omen, Exorcist, not Prophecy. All the same though, Stigmata
is a bit more upbeat than Omen or Exorcist, which translates into less
unsettling (more reassuring). But the dramatics are all there.
It opens with Father Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne), the Vatican's
miracle-debunker, doing his job in Brazil. And of course he stumbles onto
the real thing. And of course no one believes him. Cut to Philadelphia,
where a certain Brazilian artifact has found Frankie Paige (Patricia
Arquette), who, as the trailer's already told us, starts manifesting
stigmata. Kiernan comes to investigate, which involves the mandatory initial
doubting session followed soon enough by eventual conversion. All of this is
typical, right down to Kiernan, the scientist who's a preacher who's a
scientist who's Damian Karras, Doubting Thomas etc.
What isn't typical, though, is legion. First, there's the Romeo + Juliet-ish
camera/editing work, which lends an MTV quality to everything-fast-paced,
high-decibel, undeniable. Second, there's something like a social
indictment/imperative buried in all the techno-distraction: that the church
has become more important than religion. Third, there's no choir-singing
whatsoever, which is odd in a movie so consciously derivative that it hides
secrets in photographs (qua Omen), pancakes make-up on its Linda Blair
character, has doves exploding into the sky left and right, all that.
It does work, though, for about three-quarters of its runtime (before Rome
comes to Philadelphia, with no brotherly love). Especially effective are the
lengths writer Tom Lazarus goes to to establish that Frankie is definitely
not worthy of the stigmata, so something else must be going on. Something
is, as Kiernan--the ex-communicated detective of Stigmata--slowly finds out.
And it's more or less the same story as The Name of the Rose, or, more
recently, pi: there exists somewhere out there a lost book (in pi, number)
which can change the world. Meaning the people who are happy with the world
as it is don't want that book being discovered.
Effective also is the structuring of Stigmata. Like Se7en, which is
structured around the seven deadly sins, Stigmata is structured around the
five wounds of Jesus Christ during crucifixion, only here each wound ups the
ante via pushing Frankie that much closer to death, meaning she's a victim
in need of saving. Not quite as effective is Kiernan's occasional ignorance,
when he asks obvious questions for us about the gospels and such, which is
supposed to function as narrative exposition but instead makes his character
a little less believable each time. Too--and even though a token explanation
is offered--there seems to be no reason for Frankie to talk in demon-voices,
tell you lies, fake flames, etc. Or, the only viable explanation isn't
within the story but in what we expect: the creepy dissonance of Patricia
Arquette talking with a male voice. It is unsettling, it just doesn't quite
fit in a movie that tries to be so loyal to the academic side of things.
Twice as unsettling as the demon-voices, though, is an early shot of a woman
and baby and a lot of traffic, which is where Stigmata is strongest: in
director Rupert Wainwright's meticulously composed audio-visual moment, when
he's got all the religious iconography standing small yet important against
a modern backdrop. It doesn't quite make us want to go to church as Omen
did, or leave us feeling dirty as Exorcist did, but all the same, Stigmata
does leave us with questions, which at least feel a lot like doubts, which
is what the religious thriller uses to unsettle us. Even the religious
thrillers with MTV appeal.
