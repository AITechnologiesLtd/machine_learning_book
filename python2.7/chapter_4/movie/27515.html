Marquand; cast: Michel Subor (Bruno Forestier), Anna Karina (Veronica
Dreyer), Henri-Jacques Huet (Jacques), Paul Beauvais (Paul), Laszlo

film's producer); Runtime: 88; Janus; 1963-France)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>The first thing you should be aware of about this controversial 1960
political film, shot in B&W by Godard's favorite cinematographer Raoul
Coutard, is that it was not shown until 1963, as it had scenes in it
that involved torture and terrorist tactics carried out by both the
Algerians and the French while waging the Algerian war, which did not
sit well with the French government that the public be made aware of
this. It was banned by them for three years from theaters.</P>
<P>Writer-director Jean-Luc Godard (Breathless) allows his opinions to
supercede the story line, making his films sound preachy and him
self-indulgent. He often paints big political pictures that easily fall
into generalizations. In his political assessments he is just as apt to
be artless as he is to be riveting. That is the case in his second
feature, the brooding atmospheric "Le Petit Soldat." Godard did not
really have a clear position on the war and wavered in his opinions of
it just like the film's protagonist does, though probably having a
position that was nearer to the one the right-wing had.</P>
<P>Bruno Forestier (Michel Subor) is a secret agent, a man of no political
ideals, recruited while living in Geneva to do contract assignments for
the French government. He is held in compliance by them because he's a
deserter who could be arrested at their discretion and sent back to
France for punishment. He is assigned to kill an underground leftist
Arab leader named Palivoda, but balks at the assignment for no apparent
reason except he is undergoing a philosophical rebirth.</P>
<P>His turn around, from being a hit man to art lover and intellectual,
comes about when he meets his dream girl, the mysterious woman of
Russian ancestry who lived in Denmark, Veronica (Anna Karina-Godard's
wife at the time). His main concern is now whether Veronica's eyes are
Velazquez-grey or Renoir-blue. The film was fun when it had this mixture
of lighthearted romantic notions and a dark political mood to it, almost
making it seem like a noir film.</P>
<P>As Bruno tries to kill his target but can't because as he explains, this
is not his real trade, he becomes philosophical about it, and through a
voice-over he intellectually muses on Godard's thoughts. This results in
temporarily turning off the energy the film seemed to have going for it.
He says things that range from being inane to having some weight, such
as Bach is good to listen to at 8 am, Mozart at 8pm, and Beethoven at
midnight. That fiction and reality have become the same for him. That
perhaps regret is the start of freedom. That it is ludicrous for the
Vatican to be against Communism, since they both have the same belief
that all men are brothers. That France will lose the war in Algeria
because it doesn't have an ideal.</P>
<P>He is betrayed, but not by Veronica, who is secretly working for the
Arabs but is crazy enough to fall in love with him...but by others. He
is tortured by Algeria's FLN but does not reveal his contacts or give
her up to them. He tells Veronica after he escapes, he didn't squeal
because they would have killed me anyway, whatever I did.</P>
<P>Warning: spoiler to follow in next paragraph.</P>
<P>He is soon tailed by French agents after his escape and can't runaway in
time with her to Brazil and is thereby forced to kill the underground
leader, as the French grab Veronica and torture her, telling him they
will kill her if he doesn't carry out the assignment. When he boldly
kills Palivoda in public, he learns that the French had already murdered
Veronica.</P>
<P>This early, minor work by Godard, is a good example of how his films
will later on look. Le Petit Soldat suffers from flaws due to its poorly
crafted plot and in the director's inability to tell a story that brings
out all the dramatic tension. What his aim seems to be, revolves less
around plot and more in telling about the stench coming from the
Algerian war, which is explored through Bruno's intellectual musings.
Godard is most clear in showing that the Left and Right are two sides of
the same coin. He is also innovative in his cinematography, challenging
the conventional way of making a film by specializing in jump cuts and
quick editing, which give a look of immediacy to the film. This film,
thankfully, didn't have all the polemical fire in it that Godard's later
works had, instead there's much to find here that is enjoyable and I
dare say perceptive, especially if you can overlook the director's
pedantic ways.</P>
