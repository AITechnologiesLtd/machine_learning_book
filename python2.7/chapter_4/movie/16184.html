<P>Where "Apocalypse Now" and "Platoon" were both one man's viewpoint on the
Vietnam war and "Saving Private Ryan" was the story of a handful of men
searching for one, "The Thin Red Line" is a film of every man and his quest to
keep the people around him alive. It weaves through a tapestry of dozens of
men's thoughts, actions and emotions without focusing in on any of them.
Instead, it melds everyone together into a gigantic collective where the
varying opinions add up to one powerful, but flawed, "soul".</P>
<P>Director and screenwriter, Terrence Malick, a Hollywood recluse who left
filmmaking for nearly 20 years after creating two classic films during the
1970s, has turned the second World War into a poem. He finds beauty hiding
under the surface of the grotesque, emotion tucked safely away in those who
claim to be emotionless, and a heart beating freely within a gigantic chest-
cavity which should have been locked for all time. The results are stunning.</P>
<P>The camera weaves through the long grass like a snake as the soldiers work
their way to the top of the hill. As it passes over their heads, we hear some
of their thoughts, we witness their actions and we see how the two oftentimes
conflict. In one scene, a single butterfly enters the film, only to disappear
seconds later. A lot of the actors follow the butterfly's lead.</P>
<P>Nature plays the biggest part in "The Thin Red Line"; everyone else, whether a
big star such as John Travolta, or a virtually unknown actor like Dash Mihok,
are stuck in supporting roles. When they're gone, they're gone, but nature
moves on, as it has always done, never stopping to worry about what it just
lost. Does this make nature inherently evil? As a part of nature, is that evil
inside of us? If so, one of the more philosophical soldiers wonders, who
planted the seed?</P>
<P>And that's where the trouble begins. There has never been a perfect war
movie. Each one stumbles over its own ideologies and/or pretensions. "The
Thin Red Line" is no exception. Most of the thoughts and philosophies spewed
out during the film sound contrived and juvenile; tired and weak. We've heard
all this before. I don't know if this was intentional on the part of the
screenwriter (trying to emulate the way a young man under tons of pressure
would try to make sense of it all), or if he just eats lots of fortune
cookies and needed somewhere to throw out these wonderful observations found
inside the sugary shell. Surprisingly enough, another negative aspect of the
film were the cameo roles played by John Travolta, George Clooney and Woody
Harrelson. Having noticeable stars popping in and out of the movie distracted
us from the point it was trying to make, and the parts could have been played
just as easily by an unknown. Finally, at nearly three hours, the film is too
long. Malick seems to lose his sense of direction during the last forty-five
minutes, and begins to wander aimlessly from scene to scene, not knowing
quite when to end the film that began as a classic.</P>
<P>That being said, the pros definitely outweigh the cons, and with the
wonderful directing, acting and cinematography which was already in place, it
would have taken just a little more work to make "The Thin Red Line" the
perfect war movie that a lot of people have been waiting for. As it is, it
stands as a brilliant film and one of the best war movies ever made. -Alex
