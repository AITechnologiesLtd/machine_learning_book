<PRE>Deep Impact
Paramount Pictures, DreamWorks L.L.C. and Amblin Entertainment
Dir: Mimi Leder / Starring: Morgan Freeman, Tea Leoni, Robert Duvall,
Elijah Wood
Rated PG-13</PRE>
<P>Unlike most disaster movies, "Deep Impact" focuses on the psychological
aspect of impending doom.  Dir. Mimi Leder tries to bring us into the
minds of the characters and explore the drama for each sub-plot but it
just doesn't seem to work.  "Deep Impact" is Leder's second feature
film.  She directed DreamWorks' first feature "The Peacemaker" with
George Clooney and Nicole Kidman.</P>
<P>The story and script was very well written.  The situation and measures
taken seem very feasible.  The only problem?  The people didn't seem
real and sorry to say, the directing wasn't all that good as well.  It's
very difficult to have a director (whose strength is in drama) to direct
a story with nothing but heros for a cast.  Everyone sacrificed.  Some
gave up their lifes, others allowed their child to go off and save the
girl he loves, etc, etc.</P>
<P>Academy Award winner Robert Duvall seemed out of place and unconvincing
(I never thought I would ever say that),  3 time Academy Award nominee
Morgan Freeman was one-dimentional, Tea Leoni was always either scared
or angry.  And sadly to say, these were just a few of the problems. 
Leder does try, however.  There's a great scene where we're glued to the
edge of out seats when we are brought into the helmets of the
astronauts.  The slow repetition of dissolves as Mrs. Lerner prepares to
die is reminiscent of Scorcese's "Age of Innocence".  Unfortunately, the
attempt to bring us in to the minds of the people in the smaller stories
only suceeds in making the film seem smaller.  As if the budget wasn't
large enough to support the special effects, great cast AND the large
amount of extras needed to make it a legitimate disaster film.  There
just wasn't enough scenes with a mass of people.  In fact, there were
more people in the theater than in most of the crowd scenes.</P>
<P>Overall, due to poor directing, art direction, and character
development, I gave the film *1/2 of *****.</P>
