<P>Until the last part, the terror is interspersed nicely with some perfectly timed
humor.  "You guys okay to get back to the main road?" asks one friendly stranger
whom they had originally assumed to be Mr. Nail.  "Sure, now that we're not
dead," Fuller jokes back, while still shaking in his boots from their near death
experience.  The funniest scene comes when Fuller demonstrates just the right
technique to diffuse a brewing bar battle with a group of hostile rednecks.</P>
<P>JOY RIDE is funny, frightening and fabulously fun.  And it's all made quite
plausible.  One thing is certain, kids who see it will probably never be tempted
to pull a prank on a stranger.  And, if you see cars on the highway steering
clear of 18-wheelers, you can probably assume that they've recently seen JOY
RIDE.</P>
<P>JOY RIDE runs 1:36.  It is rated R for "violence/terror and language" and would
be acceptable for most teenagers.</P>
<P>The film opens nationwide in the United States today, Friday, October 5, 2001. 
In the Silicon Valley, it is showing at the AMC and the Century theaters.  </P>
