<PRE>Les Miserables
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1998 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        Can a person fundamentally change? This is a question that has been plaguing
philosophers ever since our ancestors sat around their campfires discussing
the nature of things. Is there such a such a state as redemption?</P>
<P>        French convict Jean Valjean (Liam Neeson) and Inspector Javert (Geoffrey
Rush) are at opposite ends of the spectrum when answering this conundrum. In
this version of Victor Hugo's classic novel - there have been at least 15
others - their interactions are at the core of the film.</P>
<P>        Valjean skips out on his parole after serving 19 years in an early 19th
century prison for the crime of stealing bread to eat. Encountering a kind
monsignor who forgives him after the criminal steals, Valjean turns his life
around. Years later he has somehow become wealthy, owns a factory and is mayor
of the small town of Vigau.</P>
<P>        When Javert arrives as the new prefect of police, he believes that he
recognizes Valjean from the days when he was a prison guard. Because once a
man is a criminal, he's always a criminal ("Reform is a discarded fantasy"),
he sets out to expose the mayor's past.</P>
<P>        Valjean's factory is a tight ship. He demands clean living from his workers,
going as far as separating the sexes in the work place. When Fantine (Uma
Thurman) is found to be an unwed mother, she is dismissed. Without an income,
she is forced into prostitution to make money to support her daughter.</P>
<P>        Later Valjean saves her from brutality and jail time at the hands of Javert.
Incarceration turns out to be the least of Fantine's worries: she is dying of
tuberculosis. Her last wish is for her benefactor to care for her daughter.</P>
<P>         He decides to flee when his history is brought to light, either by Javert's
scheming or Valjean's morality. The film doesn't make it clear. Gathering up
Fantine's daughter Cosette, they sneak into the heavily guarded city of Paris.
They live in a convent shut off from the outside world for 10 years until the
now-grown girl (Claire Danes) decides that she doesn't want to take vows.</P>
<P>        The two set up a soup kitchen to feed Paris' teeming poor and who should show
up but Javert. He is able to track Valjean down by following Marius (Hans
Matheson), a revolutionary leader who has fallen in love with Cosette. Amidst
the backdrop of one of several French revolts in the early 1800s, the final
showdown between the two life-long rivals is played out.</P>
<P>        The film is epic in scope with impressive sets and costuming, but there are
some major flaws. It is difficult, perhaps impossible, to translate Hugo's
1,000-plus page book into a two-hour film. The story encompasses 20 years,
dozens of characters and is heavy on internal dialogue. Not the stuff of
successful films.</P>
<P>        Screenwriter Rafael Yglesias took the impossible task and cut the novel to
the core out of necessity. He concentrates on struggle between Valjean and
Javert, eliminating many characters and sub-plots. While he had no choice but
to drop most of the book, some of his other choices are dubious. In the book
Valjean is not violent but in the film, he often uses his fists to prove his point.</P>
<P>        Neeson is his usual grand brooding self and portrays the reformed brute with
a quiet passion. Thurman eats up the screen as the dying whore providing the
most lively character in the film. Rush's obsessed cop who lives in fear of
breaking a rule is interesting, but there isn't much range in the character.
None of the rest of the actors are anything more than adequate and some not
quite so.</P>
<P>        The love stories between Valjean and Fantine and between Cosette and Marius
are not believable. We are never shown a motivation for Valjean's attraction
to her (except perhaps for her beauty) unless it's his guilt from putting her
into dire circumstances. The only possible reason for Cosette's falling in
love with the bland lifeless boy is that he's the first male she met. Neither
of these relationships are convincing although it is amusing to see Marius
begging for "just an hour" off from revolutionary fighting to visit his lover.</P>
<P>        The biggest problem with the film is its lack of grandeur. Epic scale films
call for epic scale scenes and emotional responses from the audience on the
same level. The scenes here are small, mostly involving only a few people.
With the climate of post-revolutionary Paris, the possibilities for
magnificent vignettes on a large scale are endless, but we get only a few
minutes. The film lacks energy and power. It never reaches the heights it
might have.</P>
<P>        It's difficult to care about most of the characters. With the exception of
Valjean and Fantine, the film is filled with cold one-dimensional people.
Perhaps that's why Cosette and Marius' affair is so difficult to grasp.
Neither of them are humans, only cardboard cut-outs. When the audience isn't
involved with the players, there is no epic. Swedish director Bille August
("The Best Intentions", "Pelle The Conqueror") gives us very little to work with.</P>
<P>        The immense popularity of the musical that has been selling out for years
almost guarantees this film's success no matter it's quality. In the future
producers would do well to look for 50-page short stories to adapt to film or
plan for five-hour films. The "Reader's Digest" versions don't do justice to
the originals and even worse, they don't work.</P>
