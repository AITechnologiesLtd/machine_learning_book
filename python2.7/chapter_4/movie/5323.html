<P>     In LONE STAR, writer/director John Sayles (CITY OF HOPE, PASSION 
FISH) cannily blends drama, romance, mystery, and social observation 
into a satisfying, if slightly overlong, whole.  In the hands of a 
lesser film maker, this material could easily have degenerated into 
routine melodrama, but Sayles keeps it on a consistently high level.  
While LONE STAR is not the director's finest work (CITY OF HOPE is), 
it's still a very good film with enough material to stimulate energetic 
post-movie discussion.</P>
<P>     Sayles has never made a recognizably "bad" movie, which is 
impressive considering that he has ten films on his resume.  From his 
early work, which includes RETURN OF THE SECAUCUS SEVEN (the inspiration 
for THE BIG CHILL), BABY, IT'S YOU, and MATEWAN, Sayles has eschewed 
Hollywood-influenced scripts with cliched plots.  The director's more 
recent films have moved around the globe, embracing a variety of 
settings, from the steamy bayous of Louisiana (PASSION FISH) and the 
shores of Ireland (THE SECRET OF ROAN INISH) to the Texas/Mexico border 
(LONE STAR).</P>
<P>     LONE STAR opens in the present time frame, and most of the 
narrative takes place there, with the exception of several, seamlessly-
interwoven flashbacks to 1957 and 1973.  These are necessary to breathe 
life into the film's mystery and love stories, and Sayles gives us just 
enough to satisfy the script's dramatic needs.  There isn't one moment 
during LONE STAR when we feel helplessly marooned in the past.  
Thankfully, there's no voiceover -- the editing is done so expertly that 
there's never any need.</P>
<P>     In 1996, the sheriff of Rio County is Sam Deeds (Chris Cooper).  
He's been on the job for two years, and he's filling huge footsteps.  
His late lawman father, Buddy (Matthew McConaughey), is a local legend, 
and Sam won election more because of his last name than because voters 
respected his talents.  For a variety of reasons, Sam's image of Buddy 
is far more tarnished than the one endorsed by the community, and, when 
the corpse of a bigoted ex-sheriff (Kris Kristofferson) is found on an 
abandoned rifle range, Sam tries his best to pin the forty-year old 
murder on his father.  </P>
<P>     Several other stories occur in parallel with Sam's investigation.  
One involves the sheriff's old flame, Pilar (Elizabeth Pena), trying to 
explain to concerned parents why she's teaching high school history with 
a nontraditional slant.  Instead of relying on the accepted anglo-
approved text, she's attempting to show how "cultures come together in 
both negative and positive ways."  In the meantime, she's wrestling with 
her feelings for Sam and coping with an unruly teenage son.</P>
<P>     We also get to know Colonel Del Payne (Joe Morton), the new 
commanding officer of Fort McKenzie, which is due to close.  Del's 
father, Otis (Ron Canada), lives in the area.  He and his son haven't 
spoken for decades, but, while Del is bitter about the estrangement, 
it's impossible for the two men to avoid each other.</P>
<P>     As is usually the case in a Sayles film, solid acting complements 
an intelligent script.  Chris Cooper, who was in MATEWAN and CITY OF 
HOPE, gives a subdued performance as Sam, and it's his low-key acting 
that allows one of the movie's most difficult scenes (dealing with a 
delicate and controversial subject) to work.  Mixing toughness and 
vulnerability, Elizabeth Pena carries off her scenes nicely.  Kris 
Kristofferson, despite limited screen time, makes an effective villain.  
Others, like Joe Morton, Ron Canada, and Frances McDormand (the star of 
FARGO), provide solid support.</P>
<P>     LONE STAR contains a number of "escape hatches" -- points when the 
story could have moved in a safe, predictable direction, but Sayles uses 
few of these.  The weakest aspect of the movie is the mystery, but it's 
also the least important.  LONE STAR is most intimately concerned with 
how different cultures and generations mix, match, and interact in a 
place where anglos have the wealth and power although 19 out of every 20 
people are Mexican by birth.  The black community, populated mainly by 
soldiers from the fort, is a small-but-important force.  Sayles explores 
the bipolar issues of racial divisiveness and tolerance, both as they 
exist today and as they were nearly forty years ago, and does so without 
ever losing sight of the characters.  With its numerous strengths and 
few weaknesses, LONE STAR is an example of why Sayles' films are so 
engrossing despite lengths which consistently exceed two hours.</P>
