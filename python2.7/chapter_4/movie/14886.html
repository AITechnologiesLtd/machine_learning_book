<PRE>_Elizabeth_ (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>In 1558, the young, naive Princess Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett) is
proclaimed Queen of England after the death of her devoutly Catholic
half-sister, Queen Mary I (Kathy Burke).  Being Protestant and illegitimate
(she was borne of an extramarital affair by King Henry VIII), Elizabeth
arrives on the throne with a fair share of enemies within her country as
well as abroad.  As forces ranging from French queen Mary of Guise (Fanny
Ardant) and the Duke of Norfolk (Christopher Eccleston) plot against her,
Elizabeth takes a stand with the help and guidance of ever-loyal Master of
Spies Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush).</P>
<P>Anyone expecting a typically stately, in manner and in pace, British
historical drama will be jolted by Shekhar Kapur's stylish and fast-paced
"historical thriller," in which Queen Elizabeth I's rise to the throne and
resulting loss of innocence plays not unlike that of--yes--Michael
Corleone's in _The_Godfather_.  Michael Hirst's screenplay does not offer
any true insight into what made Elizabeth tick, Blanchett's effortlessly
commanding Queen is no less a fascinating character.  Blanchett is just one
of a uniformly excellent cast, which also includes Joseph Fiennes as
Elizabeth's love interest, Lord Robert Dudley.   Even if I did not
particularly learn anything from it, I was completely engrossed by
_Elizabeth_, which not only makes the traditionally stuffy and aloof
British costume drama accessible, but entertaining and exciting as well.
