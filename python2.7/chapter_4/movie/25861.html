<PRE>STEAL THIS MOVIE!
A film review by Norm Schrager
Copyright 2000 filmcritic.com

<P>In case you were wondering, no, Steal This Movie! is not an adaptation
of activist Abbie Hoffman's Steal This Book, his 1971 how-to manifesto
about beating the system.  Now that would've been a creative film. 
Instead, it's a take on two other books, Hoffman's Letters from the
Underground and Marty Jezer's Abbie Hoffman: American Rebel, combining
to form the biography of America's most notorious and ego-driven
radical.  Unfortunately, Steal This Movie! is neither notorious nor
radical, and while showing off a talented cast in some lively sequences,
it tramples down some tired old trails.</P>
<P>As played by the ferocious Vincent D'Onofrio, Hoffman, in short, was a
lunatic.  A smart, ambitious, caring, vigilant lunatic.  (Actually, he
was eventually diagnosed as bipolar.)  His group of free thinkers and
anti-establishment yippies performed shockingly funny acts, some
resembling performance art, all in the name of rights and equality. 
Director Robert Greenwald takes us along into Hoffman's world:  the band
"holds up" a city bus, taking people's clothes and then giving them away
to those in need, and chucks dollar bills on the floor of a stock
exchange to watch everyone grovel.  Hoffman meets his wife-to-be Anita,
keeps up the anti-war cause, and realizes that he'll probably be a
lifelong organizer.</P>
<P>Greenwald is doing his best Oliver Stone impersonation.  He stands
firmly on the side of the yippies to the point of preachiness, he
intercuts actual protest footage with grainy, hand-held, tight shots of
the actors and atmosphere, and he plays with hokey cinematic tricks done
better on The X-Files, such as cutting to a black-and-white surveillance
shot of a scene, and superimposing a fake FBI file name on the screen. 
There is indeed someone out there, and Greenwald just never lets us
forget it.</P>
<P>To add insult, the framework of the movie actually mimics Citizen Kane! 
A writer is travelling to visit the people that knew Abbie, trying to
get to the bottom of the Abbie Hoffman story!  If this is the only way
that Greenwald and screenwriter Bruce Graham can think to tell the story
non-linearly, they should borrow from something a little less
ambitious.  There's even a shot of the writer peering down a long hall
at the FBI, with stacks and stacks of boxes bearing down upon him, the
secret to Abbie's paranoia hidden somewhere -- probably in a box marked
Rosebud. </P>
<P>Steal This Movie! is eventually nothing more than a better-than-average
TV movie -- ironic since most of Greenwald's work has been TV --  but
with a great cast.  The players, led by the sometimes touching
D'Onofrio, are the pulse and reality that make the movie bearable and
even fun.  Independent mainstay Kevin Corrigan is Jerry Rubin, The Tao
of Steve's Donal Logue (in his 29th movie) is Stew Albert, and in an
underwritten and wasted role, Kevin Pollak is Abbie's lawyer, Gerry
Lefcourt.  All are believable and natural, in spite of the script, but
Janeane Garofalo makes it all worth watching, again.  She plays Anita
Hoffman as wide-eyed, resilient, pragmatic, emotional, and she nails it
all.  Garofalo has shown her chops with comic and romantic dialogue, but
this movie finally gives her the chance to put all her talents out
there.  She makes some daring choices that highlight Anita's love and
sympathy, and many times, this is Garofalo's movie.</P>
<P>This movie, with its added schlock of timely pop hits throughout,
ultimately feels like it should be on NBC during sweeps.  You'd think a
story about subversiveness and freedom would be a little more daring as
a film.  Go for the cool cast.  Then see if you can steal your seven
bucks back.</P>
