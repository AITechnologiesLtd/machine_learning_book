<PRE>AS GOOD AS IT GETS</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: ***1/2 (out of ****) </PRE>
<P>TriStar / 2:18 / 1997 / PG-13 (harsh language, semi-nudity, a beating)
Cast: Jack Nicholson; Helen Hunt; Greg Kinnear; Shirley Knight; Cuba Gooding, 
Jr.; Skeet Ulrich; Yeardley Smith; Lupe Ontiveros; Jamie Kennedy 
Director: James L. Brooks 
Screenplay: Mark Andrus; James L. Brooks </P>
<P>There's something about Jack Nicholson that makes him such a unmatched pleasure 
to watch -- his eyes, his voice, his entire demeanor, they all radiate the very 
foundation of cool. His presence is a complex one; pensive and droll at the same 
time, it's hard not to watch some of his more serious work (like in "A Few Good 
Men"'s courtroom climax) and emit nervous chuckles while being wowed at the 
strength of his composure. Nicholson's so versatile, it's a pity he doesn't get 
more comedic roles like the one he plays to perfection in James L. Brooks' "As 
Good As It Gets." Slated for Christmas day opener along side of many other 
high-profile releases, "As Good As It Gets" will likely rely on Nicholson to at 
first draw the crowds in. Then, hopefully, the movie will do the rest. </P>
<P>Nicholson's middle-aged, obsessive-compulsive writer Melvin Udall
introduces his curmudgeonly self from "Good"'s get-go, as he stalks a
neighbor's pooch while it roams their New York City apartment
building's hallway. After it threateningly lifts its leg one too many
times, Melvin grabs the pup and tosses it down the garbage chute. The
dog's owner, homosexual artist Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear), doesn't
actually witness the event, but has no trouble finding the correct
foundation of blame once his pet turns up. Melvin, you see, has quite
a history of trouble with people in general, much of it stemming from
his snide demeanor -- he's simply not afraid to speak his mind, even
if what comes out is mean, damaging or downright spiteful. But it's
not treatment reserved for those who've wronged him -- Melvin even
mouths off to complete strangers. To a fan who wants to know how he
writes from the female perspective so well: "I think of a man, and
then I take away reason and accountability." To a hipster Jewish
couple sitting in his regular seat at a local diner: "I think people
who speak in metaphors oughta shampoo my crotch." You get the idea.</P>
<P>Melvin's only friend -- or, rather, the only person he can stand -- is
Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt), a waitress with a sickly son. But he even
alienates himself from her after making an extremely discouraging
remark about the kid's health; the child soon becomes so ill that
Carol takes leave from her employment.  Meanwhile, Simon is nearly
killed after walking in on a robbery in his apartment, and Melvin is
forced to take care of the dog he's tried to harm on so many
occasions. This starts something of melting process, and his
companionship with Fido leads to a greater understanding of what it's
like to have a friend. Melvin then tries to make peace with Carol in a
completely humane way, even if his efforts are, at first, rooted in
selfishness.</P>
<P>With his performance here, Nicholson stands to sweep at least the
nominations of major awards contests, if not take the actual trophies
home. His Melvin is quite an irascible, profane concoction, the type
of flawed, juicy character you really enjoy spending your time getting
to know. Hunt, as the female lead, is very much on his level, her
sense of devotion and determination palpable. Carol is probably the
most ordinary (for lack of a better word) person here, but Hunt keeps
her from becoming too ordinary; a scene where she attempts to read
Melvin a thank-you note demonstrates this. It's a welcome relief to
see Kinnear in a role that suits his talents instead of undermining
them (like "Dear God" and "A Smile Like Yours," his two most recent
features). Cuba Gooding, Jr. is fine in a minor part as a friend of
Simon's, and "Scream" alums Skeet Ulrich and Jamie Kennedy pop up --
welcome but so underused -- as male hustlers.</P>
<P>Brooks and Mark Andrus' screenplay is rich in personality and sharp,
memorable one-liners (some of which are painfully hysterical). Careful
consideration has been paid to the three leads -- the
obsessive-compulsive jerk, the down-on-her-luck waitress and the
struggling gay painter could have all been turned into creaky cliches,
which would have made this long picture quite a chore to sit
through. But they're all delicious, original creations, and watching
them help each other towards a mean of self-realization is both
fascinating and funny.  When a romance develops between Melvin and
Carol, it feels alternately forced and stirring -- the former at
perhaps a too-happy climax that fails to offer extensive closure for
Simon, the latter during a splendid dining sequence when Melvin
confesses that knowing her makes him "want to be a better man." The
love angle doesn't really work because it lacks a complete emotional
element (something a la "Jerry Maguire"), and the movie could have
been shorter and a little sweeter if it had trimmed a few things in
that area.</P>
<P>The ads for "As Good As It Gets" read "Brace yourself for Melvin," an
accurate warning considering the character's penchant for ill-tempered
political incorrectness. But brace yourself for Jack, too, because his
Melvin is full of the snazzy acting that attracts Oscar. Forget last
December 25th's awful "The Evening Star," where his cameo was the
liveliest thing in the film. And cross out this past spring's so-so
caper thriller "Blood & Wine," where he was fine but the movie
wasn't. Nicholson's back in "As Good As It Gets," and he's as great as
he gets.</P>
