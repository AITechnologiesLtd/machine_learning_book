<PRE>Ulee's Gold
directed by Victor Nuñez
starring Peter Fonda, Patricia Richardson
Rated R for brief language and some violence</PRE>
<PRE>*** ½ out of **** / A-</PRE>
<P>Bruce Barth's mellow piano plays in the background as conflict erupts in
a little country town of Florida.  Ulee's Gold feels like another Fonda
creation- On Golden Pond: it has a soft, calm surface with a tempest
brewing underneath, the cinematography creates a place of gold, yellow,
and olive colors, the music is stirring and tranquil.  Both deal with
the hardships of family life.  Peter Fonda gives his undoubtedly best
performance in Victor Nuñez's new film and Patricia Richardson (Home
Improvement star) shows she is worthy of big screen attention.  Nuñez is
probably independent film's greatest asset, along with John Sayles, and
he proves his talent with a slow pace and undulating, heavy tension.</P>
<P>Peter Fonda's performance borrows from his father Henry Fonda's in On
Golden Pond- there is a great vulnerability that he gives the character
Ulee Jackson and just like his father, Peter Fonda is quiet, emotional,
and weary in this exceptional role.  Ulee Jackson, the film's
protagonist, is struggling.  Pressure is mounting at the wrong time.  He
is a beekeeper and this is his "busy" season.  He has to deal with his
two granddaughters' needs and erupting hormones, he is forced to pick up
his daughter-in-law in Orlando who is strung out on drugs and take care
of her, and he is faced with a challenging task: unsettled business his
son, who is now in prison, has left behind.</P>
<P>He finds his daughter-in-law, Helen, with the two men his son robbed a
bank with.  She has apparently told these two men that the money that
resulted from the robbery is with her husband.  That is why he got
caught- the police found him with the money.  Now the two men are
demanding they get the cash, or they will come after Ulee's two
granddaughters.  Ulee promises he will bring it to them and takes a
deranged Helen back to his serene little home where her two children
that she abandoned scrutinize her with contempt.</P>
<P>Ulee is a man who lost his pals in war- he was the only man in his
platoon to survive.  He refuses help from anybody and does not respond
to affectionate gestures.  He is a bitter, closed-off man whose only
passion is his beekeeping, his granddaughters, and his dead wife.
Connie, his next door neighbor, finally gets through to him with
friendly favors.  She is a nurse and helps Helen get through her turmoil
with drugs.</P>
<P>Ulee's Gold is the story of a man who believes he is fine as he is-
until the truth is revealed painfully to him: He is cold and unfeeling.
Of course, in the end, Ulee softens up, but his journey is absorbing and
we have fallen in love with his tiredness and weariness.  What is
admirable about the movie is Peter Fonda's winning turn as Ulee and the
story that feels like Nobody's Fool but, in the end, ends up in a class
of its own.</P>
