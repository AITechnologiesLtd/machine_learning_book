<PRE>DEEP RISING (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Copyright 1998 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>Deep Rising is a B-movie stuck in an A-movie body. Director Stephen Sommers
(Jungle Book) is able to keep the campiness high and not take the film too
seriously, which keeps the film from falling flat on its face.</P>
<P>Imagine a film about a large luxury boat sinking with thousands dead or
dying.  No, this is not Titanic.  Nor does this film have any of the great
characteristics that made Titanic so wonderful. Missing are the characters
that we can latch onto or the plot to completely pull you into the film.</P>
<P>A group of heavily armed mercenaries is about to over take this huge luxury
boat, The Argonaut.  When they arrive and board the ship, they find that
the ship is empty and very bloody.  Not one soul can be found, not even a
corpse.</P>
<P>The mercenaries, led by Hanover (Wes Studi), are taken out to the luxury
ship by Finnegan (Treat Williams).  Aboard the ship, untouched by whatever
got to everyone else, is a beautiful jewel thief, Trillian (Famke Janssen).
As the mercenaries, along with Finnegan and crew, search out the ship, they
soon run into Trillian.  Together they find that there is something
horrible aboard the ship.</P>
<P>About halfway through the film we are introduced to the horror that is on
the ship.  It comes in the form of an octopus-like creature that ravaged
the ship and its passengers. Now, do not imagine a common octopus that you
might see at the local aquarium.  This creature is huge and it is hungry.
How does the creature terrorize these people?  Think tentacles.  Think jaws
on tentacles. Think speed and deadly aim. That's how this creature
terrorizes the main characters.</P>
<P>Deep Rising is not a horrible movie but at points it's a painful movie.
What is most painful about the movie?  Kevin J. O'Connor.  His character,
Joey (Finnegan's ship mechanic), is written as the comic relief of the film
but serves as the opposite.  Every time he was on screen I kept mentally
cheering, "Die, Joey!  Die!"  Part of what makes him so annoying is his
voice and the other is the horrible lines that he gets. His screen time is
as enjoyable as chewing aluminum foil.</P>
<P>I'm happy to say that everyone else fares a bit better in the film,
especially Treat Williams and Framke Janssen.  Both suffer from bad
dialogue, but as a whole, their reputation comes out somewhat unscathed.
It's nice to see Famke Janssen again; she was introduced to us in GoldenEye
as a bad Bond girl. One face that might stand out is Djimon Hounsou's, one
of the mercenaries.  It's disappointing to see Hounsou in such a mediocre
and short role after seeing his wonderful performance in Amistad.</P>
<P>The music by Jerry Goldsmith is forgettable.  At times, the score seems
overly campy, which fits the movie just right.  Then there are times when
the score is too serious and falls out of place.</P>
<P>The special effects are admirable.  The creature is scary enough, but
director Sommers does not use it to its full potential.  One special effect
that disappointed was "the fireball." When is Hollywood going to learn that
it is impossible to outrun an exploding fireball?</P>
<P>Deep Rising's saving grace is that it doesn't take itself too seriously.
>From its campy script to its over-the-top action and its cool looking
creature, Deep Rising is a blast if you don't walk into the theatre
expecting too much.  If you want to have some mindless fun, catch Deep
Rising in the theatres.</P>
