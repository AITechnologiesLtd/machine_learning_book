<P>   One dictionary goes so far as to say that "all sound is
music."  "I can accept that," you said with your broad, liberal
mind, "but I don't have to listen to the noise."  If
you're over 25 years of age, you're probably even less likely
to listen and dig electronic music than you are to groove on
rap or acid rock.  Or are you?  Electronic music is with us and
most of us eavesdrop on it consciously or not.  This is just
one of the fascinating things we learn in a highly varied short
film called "Modulations."  Now, then, what was the last time
you heard the stuff?  If you're a movie buff, you listened to
strains of an electronic composition by the fictional character
Vinh Schuman, in the movie "Bad Manners."  In that picture,
Sol Rubinek plays a musicologist who discovers that a 20th
century Vietnamese composer included a segment of a five-
hundred year old work by Martin Luther in his electronic
essay; a segment he could not possibly have ever heard
before.  If you haven't seen that particular picture, you've
heard it as background, ambient music.  It creates a mood. 
But what if you never go to movies, do not have a tape
recorder, TV, CD player or radio?  You still hear electronic
music.  You get it when you open the refrigerator, turn on the
fax machine, shoot videos of your family.  Remember: ALL
sound is music.  This is central to "Modulations."</P>
<P>   How good is this film?  If an education is your goal, it's OK
for a start.  If structure is important, it's a flop.  As Alvin
Toffler, author of "Future Shock" and one of the few older
chaps in the movie states, "We in the West are good at taking
things apart: what we're not so good at is putting things
together."  Granted: as one of the younger talking heads in
the film brings out, "The world is chaos, not a series of one's
and zero's."  But the way to portray this chaos is with order,
and unfortunately Iara Lee, the Brazilian-born, U.S.
documentary maker, exhausts us almost as much in this work
as she did with her previous "Synthetic Pleasures."  From the
older generation, she presents sound bites in interviews with
John Cage, who is perhaps the father of it all and also with
Robert Moog, the inventor of the ubiquitous synthesizer that
bears his name.  We hear from representatives in Berlin,
London, Detroit, Tokyo, and Mount Fuji, each putting in his or
her two cents, yen, marks or tuppence about scores of
minutely distinct types of electronic music: tri-hop, acid house,
drum-and-bass, and ambient music are just some kinds of
new music, with ambient the type almost everyone in the
audience can accept.  Groups with names as exotic as
Throbbing Gristle and Kraftwerk sound off and hip-hop
advocates demonstrate scratchmusic--which, as the name
implies, can be created by scratching the vinyl and coming up
with combinations of tones.  About the most scientific
statement made is that we like to dance 133 beats to the
minute.</P>
<P>   "All music is inately psychedelic" is one of the great
thought-provokers here and, come to think of it our minds do
tend to construct images from the sounds we hear from Bach
to Rock to Scratch.  Music and images go together, as one
young and hip artist suggests, and director Lee has no
problem with that, as she throws an MTV-quick succession of
visual impressions at us in the style of Godfrey Reggio's 1983
groundbreaking film "Koyaanisquatsi," which uses time-lapse
photography to detail a good deal of Americana.</P>
<P>    The movie could have been much improved if Iara Lee
would have slowed down, knocked out some of the verbally
inarticulate commentators (like, I mean, you know), and given
a conventially topical arrangement to this frenzied m‚lange of
sound, light, and imagery.</P>
