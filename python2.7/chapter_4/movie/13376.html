<P>   You don't expect credibility in summer's action-adventure
movies, but at least "Least Weapon 4" includes one statement
which is absolutely true.  "We're too old for this," complains
Detective Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) to his partner Roger
Murtaugh (Danny Glover).  Truth to tell the two should have
quit after the snappy, original first time around, one sequel
tops.  This time we get the usual fine action sequences and
look in on the martial arts skills of a new talent.  He is
handsome Jet Li as a gangster who is so cool that he can
stand still, arms folded, grinning, and watch his buddies try to
fight off the cops, jumping into the fray only when his team is
about to lose.  With a few leaps, kicks and thrusts of his
deadly hands, he is invincible, once even fighting off both
Riggs and Murtaugh with a pole penetrating his entire body
from belly to back.</P>
<P>   With Richard Donner once again at the helm, "Lethal
Weapon 4" blends a combination of good-natured humor,
slapstick, violence and even some maudlin sentimentality.
Partners Riggs and Murtaugh, both promoted from sergeant
to captain overnight, wisecrack their way from the usual alpha
to the customary omega in rounding up an ending the careers
of some fun gangster and evil mobsters alike.  The supporting
cast have joined up once again in similar capacities: Joe
Pesci performs in the role of a private investigator, just as
noisome and as cuddly as he was in "Lethal Weapon 2." 
Rene Russo is Lorna Cole, who is Riggs' significant other,
Stuart Wilson is the put-upon c.o. of the detective duo and
Chris Rock joins the crew as a new breed of cop and one
who is secretly married to Detective Murtaugh's daughter.</P>
<P>   The story opens on an action sequence that has nothing to
do with the principal plot, in much the style of the James
Bond series.  The daring duo tackling a nut case who thinks
he's a video game: a guy covered from head to toe in
impenetrable armor who is torching all the stores on a city
block, shooting at the two main cops from an automatic
weapon while Riggs and Murtaugh banter about their coming
child and grandchild respectively.  After dispatching the
unprincipled varmint, the detectives take action against a
group of smugglers, enlisting the help of their Sancho Panza,
Leo Getz (Joe Pesci), Private eye.  The plot is almost as
impenetrable as "The X-Files: Fight the Future" but seems to
involve a plan to bring Chinese illegals into the country to
work as indentured servants for the bootleggers.  In a design
involving two rival Chinese gangs, the Triads seek to buy
these slaves back from the Four Fathers using counterfeit
Chinese money.  </P>
<P>   Though the detectives realize eventually that the only way
to defeat these master criminals is to have them fight it out
among themselves and kill one another off, they are
themselves in heaps of trouble.  In one situation they are left
to die in a burning house because criminals still have not
learned: shoot the cops first.  In another, the two are involved
in an underwater skirmish with the picture's karate kid.  </P>
<P>   For the women in the audience, presumably, director
Donner milks some sentiment by having Murtaugh adopt a
hapless family of Chinese illegals (who are ultimately granted
asylum even though such asylum has rarely been granted
before to folks in their situation).  A terminally silly scenes is
tacked on in the end, involving the usual jokes about a
pregnant woman about to give birth but is "not ready" to do
so.</P>
<P>   "Lethal Weapon 4" is simply an assortment of takes
involving jokes and jocks, a wholly unncessary appendage to
Gibson and Glover's previous work, but one which
undoubtedly will hit the number one spot in the box office
given the lack of competition during the weekend of its
opening.  </P>
<PRE>Rated R.  Running time: 128 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten
