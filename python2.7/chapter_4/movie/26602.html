<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>I started to get a sinking feeling about half an hour into "Meet The
Parents". I won't lie: it was a reasonably funny movie. There had already
been a number of amusing little set pieces -- like one where Ben Stiller
accidentally shatters an urn containing the remains of Robert De Niro's
mother and De Niro's beloved cat uses it as a litter box. There was just
one problem: I had already laughed at these scenes, two or three months
ago, when the previews came out.</P>
<P>Yes, "Meet The Parents" is yet another victim of its own publicity. In
between the various theatrical and television promos for the film, the ad
men seem to have successfully spoiled just about every joke in the movie.
Comedy relies on being unexpected; unless it's done exceedingly well, if
you can see a gag coming, your reaction to it is usually muted. And that's
the main problem with "Meet The Parents" -- the funny bits are either in
the trailers or are so blatantly telegraphed that they can be predicted
far in advance of the actual scene. (De Niro warns Stiller not to flush
the toilet in the bathroom adjoining his sleeping quarters; what are the
odds that, at some point, Stiller will forget and yet more chaos and
embarrassment will result?)</P>
<P>The premise of "Meet The Parents" is straightforward, but has a lot of
potential as a comedy vehicle. The unfortunately-surnamed Greg Focker
(Stiller) is in love with Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo), but decides he needs to
seek her father's permission before he asks her to marry him. Pam's sister
Debbie (Nicole DeHuff) is to be wedded soon, providing the perfect
opportunity for Pam to bring Greg home to meet the parents. Unfortunately
for Greg, Pam's father Jack (De Niro) turns out to be an intimidating,
no-nonsense figure whose sole concern is for the best interests of his
daughter. He seems to be utterly immune to Greg's affable attempts to make
friends.</P>
<P>What follows is a mounting series of catastrophes, as Greg tries 
desperately to ingratiate himself to Jack. But Greg's initial little white
lies soon turn into wholesale deceptions, and other forces conspire to 
make Jack think that Greg is about as far removed from proper son-in-law
material as is humanly possible. Everything that could go wrong does --
Greg makes himself look like an ass in front of Pam's rich and
multi-talented ex-fiance (Owen Wilson), inadvertently sabotages Debbie's
wedding on several occasions, and so on -- and it soon appears that not
only Greg's engagement plans but indeed his whole relationship with Pam is
in danger.</P>
<P>Preview spoilage or not, "Meet The Parents" could have been a delightful
little romantic comedy in surer hands. I can easily picture Jimmy Stewart
in the Focker role -- or, better yet, Buster Keaton -- bumbling his way
from misadventure to misadventure. But Stiller, although a good comedian,
does not possess an enormous reserve of innate charisma. Actors like
Stewart and Keaton generate sympathy naturally, but Stiller has yet to
learn how to do this. Unfortunately, the screenplay by Jim Herzfeld and
John Hamburg seems to operate under the assumption that we will naturally
root for Greg, no matter how absurd or extreme his behaviour.</P>
<P>For my part, though, I never really responded to Stiller in this way. In
"There's Something About Mary", we could at least see that Stiller's Ted
was a nice guy who became caught up in an unfortunate set of 
circumstances. In "Meet The Parents", Stiller's character is defined only
in terms of his affection for Pam. Is he really the right guy for her?
Should Pam's parents be accepting of him? This is assumed to be the case,
but is never really justified. Indeed, based on Greg's antics throughout
much of the movie, I found myself siding with Jack -- I wouldn't want this
guy marrying my daughter either!</P>
<P>De Niro is "Meet The Parents'" saving grace. He has seemed awkward in
previous comedies -- "Analyze This" and "The Adventures Of Rocky & 
Bullwinkle" are two recent examples -- but here he has found a character 
that suits him to a tee. He is not parodying his own past roles (as in
both the films cited), but is instead crafting something new and
interesting in its own right. As Jack Byrnes, he hits all the right notes.
He is neither too soft nor obscenely tough, and finds just the desired
level of exaggeration to portray every beau's worst nightmare.</P>
<P>Director Jay Roach does an acceptable job, but lets things drag in spots,
a situation further compounded by the sheer repetitiveness of the
storyline. "Meet The Parents" would have benefitted from the same manic
energy Roach helped bring to the "Austin Powers" movies, but ends up as
too lackadaisical. Only a hilarious encounter between Greg and a flight
attendant (Kali Rocha) in the movie's latter stages -- one of the few
comedy bits not spoiled by any of the advertising I saw, it must be noted 
-- really embodies the kind of comic intensity missing from a vast
proportion of the running time.</P>
<P>"Meet The Parents" is not a bad movie, exactly, and will no doubt appeal
more to those who have avoided the trailers and therefore will encounter
its major set pieces for the first time. But even getting beyond that, it
is still an all-too-formulaic movie which seems designed more for the
video shelves than for the big screen. Still, "Meet The Parents" does 
finally demonstrate that Robert De Niro can be a good comedy actor. Now he
just needs to find the right movie in which to strut his stuff.</P>
