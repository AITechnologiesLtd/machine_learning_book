<P>   One of the cruelest assignments a teacher can give is to
ask the kids to write a composition, "What I did on my
summer vacation."  Many children, for lack of money or
imagination may have a dull summer indeed only to envy and
resent those who have been to camp or who have traveled. 
Many do not have parents who care enough to provide fun
for their youngsters.  This is the fate that seems to await 9-
year-old Masao (Yusuke Sekiguchi), a boy who is
understandably gloomy when on the last day of school his
best friend tells him that he will spend the summer with his
dad at the seashore.  With no one his own age to play with,
little Masao seems fated to spend the summer mostly alone,
his meals left out for him  by his grandmother (Kazuko
Yoshiyuki) who must spend the days working at her food stall
in a Tokyo neighborhood.</P>
<P>   The most unusual thing about "Kikujiro" is that the film is
made by Takeshi Kitano, known for ultra-violent cinema such
as his recent "Hani-Bi" ("Fireworks"). We can almost suspect
that Kitano made this one on a bet that he couldn't produce a
comic and sometimes poignant road-and-buddy film focussing
on the friendship between two people as unlike as a
breakfast of pickles and sushi is to a wake-up meal of bacon
and eggs.  Kitano is famed as not only a filmmaker but as a
actor who got his start as a stand-up comic and novelist,
using the acting name of "Beat" Takeshi.  His sense of
vaudevillian possibilities is ever present as he plays the role
of the title character, Kikujiro Takeda, known simply as
"Mister" to the boy he befriends and for whom he creates
great joy.</P>
<P>   The film, which was seen last year at the Cannes and
Toronto festivals, is almost wholly fluff, whimsy of the most
delicate kind, featuring some of Kitano's experimentation with
imagery and color which comes at us at surprising times
during the story's almost two-hour length.  In this work, the
nine-year-old Masao, who has no father and whose mother
seems to have left him to "go to work" elsewhere, decides to
spend part of his summer searching for her.  He is given just
a little money, so a friend of his grandmother asks her
husband, Kikujiro (Takeshi Kitano), to act as big brother and
lead him in the search.  Kikujiro is a loud, vulgar, classless
person who tempts the fates more than once in the impolite
ways he talks to people. He has the makings of the yakuza
types made famous by Kitano's previous movies.  But as the
unlikely half of this couple (the boy is shy an frequently faces
the ground without smiling), he introduces the lad to the best
summer of his life while changing quite a bit in the process
himself.</P>
<P>   As a road movie, this one has the usual format: hit the
road, meet weird people, run into dangerous and comic
situations, and come back home wiser and happier people. 
During their travels, Kikujiro shows his nasty self by cheating
the boy out of his money, losing most of it on the bike races,
then trusting to his wiles to hitch rides to Masao's mother's
place of residence.  In one Felliniesque situation, Kikujiro
pretends to be blind while the kid tries to con a ride.  In yet
another he flattens the tire of a passing car hoping to get a
lift as the driver stops to make repairs, only to face the
disastrous result of the car's careening off the highway into a
ditch.  Spending some time at a hotel, Kikujiro pretends to be
able to swim and winds up near drowning.  The most unusual
adventure occurs when the two meet up with a pair of tough-
looking bikers who turn out to be kind and gentle people,
willing to go out of their way to entertain Masao by dressing
up as various characters, including an alien from outer space,
a skeleton, and even an octopus.  We wonder how Kikujiro
gets out of the story in one piece considering the offensive
habit of addressing people as "baldy" and "fatso" and the like,
but his gruff manner provides most of the chuckles of this
entertaining film.</P>
<P>   The boldest imagery occurs as Kitano films a brief
nightmare, filmed with a deep red hue, featuring a dancing
man who at one point had tried to sexually abuse the boy. 
Kitano's own paintings appear in the movie and in one cameo
we see the other half of the filmmakers comic team at a bus
stop at which the travelers were forced to take shelter for
several hours during a rainstorm.  Masao's ultimate meeting
with his mother is an especially poignant one, but the movie
never veers into excessive sentimentality, the musical
soundtrack regularly upbeat.  "Kikujiro" is the sort of movie
that will have you leave the theater with the smile but is too
whimsical and lacking in serious texture to garner awards or
wildly enthusiastic responses.</P>
