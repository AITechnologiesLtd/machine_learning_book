A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Brian De Palma</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: David Koepp</PRE>
<P>Ingredients: Hurricane, assasination, conspiracy, honest cop. </P>
<P>Starring: Nicolas Cage, Gary Sinise, Carla Gugino</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
A boxing heavyweight title fight is held in a stadium in Atlantic City,
NJ as hurricane winds and rain rage outside. The fight is attended by
the US Secretary of Defense and his entourage of Navy men and industrial
associates. The Secretary of Defense has heard rumors of corruption, and
intends to meet a secret contact who claims to have information, but he
is assassinated by a sniper during the title fight, leaving 15,000
people to be detained as police witnesses during the tropical storm.</P>
<P>The policeman in charge of the overall investigation is Rick Santoro
(Nicholas Cage), a flamboyant cop of dubious morality who wears loud
clothes, gambles incessantly, and reaches for his cellular telephone
more often than a bookie or agent. Santoro may be corrupt and
well-connected, but he's also a competent investigator, and soon smells
a murderous conspiracy. Trouble is, all the suspects keep winding up
dead, until only one is finally left, and the final confrontation
begins.</P>
<P>Opinion:
Nicholas Cage fans will enjoy this movie, because Cage does a masterful,
if slightly over-the-top job of playing the intriguing main character,
Officer Santoro. In fact, Cage bails this movie out.</P>
<P>With a director like Brian De Palma you know automatically that the
movie's cinematography will be tight, that the movie will not be boring,
and that it will feature neat visual angles and suspense. That's
probably why the setting is a hurricane: so we can have lots of
lightning flashes and suspenseful shadows, De Palma style.</P>
<P>But the weak script of Snake Eyes creates a problem: basically the story
is too predictable to be a whodunit since we can all guess who the bad
guy is after only two seconds. Given a weak and somewhat unbelievable
story line, how do you prevent boredom and revive suspense without
resorting to ridiculous special effects, action stunts, and extraneous
car chases?</P>
<P>SNAKE EYES solves the problem by shifting its focus from whodunit to
character sketch. For example, instead of the big question being, "Who's
the murderer?" the movie focuses heavily on Cage's intriguing character,
and then pops the question, "How will poor Nicholas Cage react when he
finds the murderer's identity?" And so we sit through the movie as Cage
does his investigations all the way until the final confrontation, just
to see how poor Cage reacts. This new focus - - with emotional suspense
substituting for action-based suspense - - combined with strong acting
and snappy dialogue keeps us sufficiently hooked. Somewhat predictable
and fakey, Snake Eyes nevertheless entertains. </P>
