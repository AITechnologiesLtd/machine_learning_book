Vance</P>
<P>SPACE COWBOYS is a middle age fantasy. It's the kind of film where the old 
guys get all the best lines while the young guys take it with sheepish grins 
or straight faced anger, and the audience laughs and cheers "You tell em, 
Clint!" Critics have taken to calling it GRUMPY OLD ASTRONAUTS, which it sort 
of is for its first two acts, then, once these grumps get into outer space we 
get a slowed down to pace maker speed ARMAGEDDON where everything goes wrong 
and one of the boys must sacrifice his life (it'll be increasingly obvious 
who'll do so by the forty five minute mark) to make things right. The final 
shot is as haunting as it is implausible as it is completely out of sync with 
everything that came before it.</P>
<P>Surprisingly, SPACE COWBOYS contains more self deprecating humor than you'd 
expect from a movie directed by Eastwood and featuring such "manly" men as 
Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, and James Garner, who grin and grimace amid a 
flurry of false teeth jokes, losing eye sight jokes, everybody I used to know 
is dead jokes, out of shape jokesâ€¦these guys are truly too old for this shit. 
Much of the movie has the screenwriters devising one humiliating, torturous 
physical test after another; the senior citizens grunt and wheeze through 
eight mile jogs, they barely survive a bench press session, and at one point 
they're made to stand, sans trousers, in all their saggy assed glory before a 
young chick doctor. And by the way, if my ass looks half as good as 
Eastwood's when I'm seventy I'll surely die a happy man. But 
please, oh please don't give me Sutherland's ass.</P>
<P>The film commences with an old stand-by; a group of friends, none of whom 
have seen each other since their collective hey day, reunite to do another 
job on the ask of their unofficial leader Frank Corvin (Clint Eastwood, so 
damn grizzled I practically expected him to growl when he first appears). 
Corvin, in his prime, was a hot shot NASA rocket scientist (!) who designed a 
Cod War-era satellite that, today, is on its way to crashing out of orbit. 
It's such an antiquated piece of machinery that none of the "dim bulbs" 
currently counting the days to retirement at NASA have the foggiest notion on 
how to fix it. Corvin is asked to provide the information needed to repair 
the gizmo but he stubbornly refuses, countering with the suggestion that NASA 
fly him and his old crew up into space. Well, it at least makes more sense 
then beaming up a bunch of psychotic oil drillers.</P>
<P>This leads to the traditionally wacky encounters wherein the hero finds his 
old friends in unexpected positions, like the craggy James Garner as a 
bargain basement Baptist priest, a pony tailed Donald Sutherland as the guy 
who tests roller coasters for speed, and Tommy Lee Jones (bull necked as 
ever) as a nutty prop plane pilot. Following the intros, all the 
aforementioned grunting and wheezing commences, punctuated by wisecracks and 
shouting matches between Eastwood and the mission leader played by James 
Cromwell (LA. CONFIDENTIAL) who acts so downright despicable he might as well 
have a British accent.</P>
<P>Clint seems to have paid a bit of mind to some of the criticisms hoisted upon 
many of his films, particularly how he often seems to cast community college 
graduates as his love interests. Here he casts an older lady (Barbara 
Babcock) as his wife (though she isn't given much screen time), Tommy Lee 
Jones romances the mature NASA lieutenant Sara Holland (Marcia Gay Harden), 
rather than her daughter, it's only Donald Sutherland who chases young girls, 
though he's playing the part of comic lecher. Eastwood also seems more game 
than ever to goof on his tough guy image, though not so much as to have him 
be any less than a superhero who succeeds in spite of all odds.</P>
<P>In many ways SPACE COWBOYS is like a less mature, vaudeville companion to 
Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN, the most brilliant film Clint ever lucked into. That 
was more a middle age nightmare about men past their prime, coming to grips 
or in some cases embracing old haunts. SPACE COWBOYS is about goofing on 
clueless youngsters, and acting even more heroic than they when it comes down 
to it. Much of the movie coasts on the chemistry of its quartet; these guys 
are legends and it's tough not to derive some pleasure from seeing them send 
up their cut in stone images. But still, when I go to a movie I tend to look 
for more than a plethora of old timer gags</P>
<P>I can't say that I thoroughly enjoyed it but, nonetheless, I had a pretty 
good time at the showing. This is an amiable crowd pleaser that will probably 
appeal to youngsters dreaming of space travel as well as those middle aged 
men hoping to see Eastwood quit that whining he did through THE BRIDGES OF 
MADISON COUNTY, drop the negative character traits of his dogged reporter in 
TRUE CRIME, and just return to the figure of ANY WHICH WAY YOU CAN and 
HONKYTONK MAN; the tough straight man with a hint of comic wile.</P>
<P>SPACE COWBOYS is the last film in who knows how long that will sit privy to 
the sounds of middle aged laughter. And that's something that shouldn't be 
discounted when for the last two years film makers seemed to be trying to 
make stars out of the collective casts of the WB. These guys are like vintage 
wines, and while I didn't grow up idolizing them (I was born in '79, and it 
did take me a while to warm up to Eastwood's particular brand of wooden 
minimalism) I can certainly admire their ripened talents. The movie itself is 
more of a crusty homage to the old stars' personalities with silly space 
machinations thrown in. I didn't really care for that. I would have liked to 
see them at the service of an actual story. But many won't mind either way 
and if you're a long time fan you'll likely lap this one up.</P>
