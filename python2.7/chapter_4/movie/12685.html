<P>I saw 'The Player' when it was first released in 1992 and I viewed it at
a 2nd run art house (that's a term used to describe a movie theatre that
shows films that don't make a lot of money), and I didn't hear one
chuckle from the audience in a building that was more than half full for
its first evening performance so it's puzzling to me how the film can be
called a "black comedy" by numerous other critics that have reviewed
it.  Black comedies are usually highly uneven because the comedy is so
sharp and penetrating that it has to let up at some point to prepare you
for the next strike by pounding your funny bone with a hammer.  When I
think of the term "black comedy" and ironically it's another film that
examines the movie industry, Blake Edwards' 1981 film 'S.O.B.' comes to
mind.  That film threw in everything but the kitchen sink in its
slapstick presentation of Hollywood politics and manipulating, and
Edwards put his own trademark silliness found in many of his 'Pink
Panther' films into the film's key moments.</P>
<P>Director Robert Altman's films are like documentaries in many cases but
they always retain the academic flare that rank right up there with the
most studio oriented films that are produced.  Altman is perhaps best at
developing the themes of his pictures in a very even fashion and the
climax of all his films aren't executed to detract from the enjoyment of
any other part of the film.</P>
<P>'The Player' is the type of non-Hollywood movie that almost every
celebrity wanted to be in.  It features literally dozens and dozens of
cameos by big stars that I'm sure had their share of nasty studio
politics and decided to slap the movie industry in the face by appearing
in this big winner of a movie.  The film's cynicism is so well hidden by
its main plot that it comes off not only as a smart film but one that
plays its main characters better and in a more realistic fashion than
almost any other film made in the 1990's, so far.</P>
<P>Having worked for many years at the corporate end of the entertainment
industry, I can tell you without hesitation that the type of wheeling
and dealing, back stabbing, decadent behaviour and day to day operations
in the movie industry are complete and on target throughout the entire
film and hit a truthful note in every frame.</P>
<P>In 'The Player', we are shown one of the most ingenious opening scenes
ever filmed as a long tracking shot (about 8 minutes) pans across the
lot of a movie studio as various characters interact.  Tim Robbins stars
as a movie studio boss who is receiving threatening post cards in his
office that contain death threats and he is determined to find out who
is sending them.  He tracks down who he believes is the culprit stalking
him with the threats and he may or may not be correct in his assumption.</P>
<P>Without telling you who does what to who (you can discover that when you
see the film), the film contains an old fashioned murder plot that fits
into the context of the movie's suspense and complex character study and
its story doesn't sell itself out at the end but rather has an ending
that you may not like on the surface but deeper thought will convince
you it's the right one.</P>
<P>'The Player' received three Oscar nominations (Best Director for Altman,
Best Screenplay for Michael Tolkin based on his own novel and Best Film
Editing).  Understandably, it didn't get a nomination for Best Picture
in a year that featured 'The Crying Game', 'A Few Good Men', 'Howard's
End', 'Scent of a Woman', and the winner, 'Unforgiven' as the selected
finalists.  There was no way the Hollywood crowd was going to nominate a
film mocking their industry and perhaps  become the representative (if
it won) of an award that is suppose to sugar coat the film industry, not
show its darker side.</P>
