<PRE>TITANIC (1997) * * * *
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1997 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<PRE>CAPSULE: Believe the hype.</PRE>
<P>After all of the rumors, the negative press, the calamity on the set
and the endlessly upward-spiraling budget, the executive nail-biting
and the snip-and-fret editing, James Cameron's TITANIC is nothing
short of a total success. It does not enhance Cameron's reputation to
the status of a Kurosawa -- which I don't discount, it just hasn't
happened here -- but he's certainly on the level of a D.W. Griffith.
It's the fastest-moving three hours you're likely to spend in a movie
theater, and some of the best.</P>
<P>Why this project? I asked myself that -- at first with dismay, and
then with mounting anticipation -- when Cameron first announced his
intentions to go down there and film the hulk of the ship itself. Now
I have a theory: Cameron's TERMINATOR movies were, in a way, about a
gigantic paradigm shift. the sinking of Titanic was the beginning of
the end of an era, the era of total social stability, of man's
certainty of his domination over nature. Now we are a little more
cautious, if no less ambitious; just more aware that we can be smashed
down quite easily when we're not looking in the right direction. But
neither Skynet nor Titanic are themselves to blame -- they're just the
agents of man's shortsightedness writ large. (There are various
apocalyptic overtones which I'll save for another essay.)</P>
<P>But if the movie's wrapper is Titanic's hulk at the bottom of the
Atlantic, the core is a buoyant love story which unfolds during the
course of Titanic's one voyage partway across the ocean. And to make
the whole thing work, Cameron made some fairly hard storytelling and
directorial decisions early on. He could have opted for a more
"Altmanesque" approach, in which a whole congeries of lives
intertwined and wove through each other on that day, but he shirked
that device in favor of a fistful of tightly colliding
characters. Everyone wants something from everyone else, and they are
going to have a hell of a time getting it: your basic ingredients for
good drama.</P>
<P>Winslet's character, both in the past and future, is a solid addition
to the roster of Cameron heroines: a stubborn woman with a mind, who's
often despised by the men around her. When she first begins to speak
of the ship, Cameron very wisely holds back on showing us exactly what
she's talking about. "The sheets had never been slept in," she says;
"the china never eaten from. The paint was still fresh." Her words in
our minds evoke images by themselves -- and then Cameron takes over
and shows us what images her words are evoking in the minds of the
salvage crew. This is just a tiny example of the movie's directorial
genius.</P>
<P>The characters themselves are Damon Runyan stock figures, but again,
they're ennobled and made interesting through a unique marriage of
writing, acting and direction. They're interesting to watch, just to
see what happens next. Jack Dawson (Leonardo Di Caprio) is a young
roustabout who wins a ticket onboard in a poker match, and Kate
Winslet plays the younger Rose as an upper-class beauty who is never
less than uncomfortable in a whalebone corset. Billy Zane is greasy
and hateful as her husband-to-be (his love for her seems to be an
unholy cocktail of equal parts sadism, masochism, and desperation),
and the supporting players (especially the proverbial Titanic deck
band) fill out the story's hollow corners and give the movie the
feeling of an ongoing slice of life.</P>
<P>Both floating and sinking, we are never less than convinced that
Titanic is there, on screen, in front of us. The movie earns such a
total suspension of disbelief from the audience that we feel we could
walk around the ship in our minds after leaving the theater. There's a
requisite amount of repetitiveness in the final hour of the movie --
the ship is sinking, sinking, *still* sinking, etc. -- but all of that
is underscored with the terrible tensions of the main
characters. We've come to give a damn about them; they make the hoary
cliche of the sinking ship into something new.</P>
<P>There is no end of wonderful moments: The part where Jack shows Rose
how to spit -- and how to fly. The scene in the car in steerage. The
elderly couple on the bed.  The aforementioned deck band, playing
until the bitter end. And the incredible sight of that ship snapping
in half like a stepped-on twig.</P>
<P>It's hard to speak modestly of a movie like TITANIC, which has ungodly
huge ambitions. It wants to entertain; it wants to be romantic and
moving; it wants to thrill. It does all of those magnificently. Not
only that, but it was definitely all worth waiting this long for.</P>
