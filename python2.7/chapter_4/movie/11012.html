<PRE>THE SWEET HEREAFTER</PRE>
<PRE>Dear Caroline --</PRE>
<P>        There is nothing simple about an Atom Egoyan film. The
Canadian filmmaker excels at challenging the mind as well as the
senses.</P>
<P>           In Egoyan's followup to 1994's excellent "Exotica," Egoyan
adapts Russell Banks' novel about a small British Columbia town
dealing with the tragedy of a school bus crash that killed 14 of the
town's children.</P>
<P>        Just a simple plot summary wrenches the heart, but Egoyan
deals with the subject matter in his trademark fashion as a simple,
lyrical poem. I believe today's closest working director to Ingmar
Bergman is Egoyan. Bille August, a Bergman disciple, comes
close. Egoyan's films, like Bergmans, are psychological and emotional
dramas from the head and the heart. They ask more questions than they
provide and refuse to indulge in simplistic, "My,
aren't-we-all-happy?" endings.</P>
<P>            Like "Exotica," Egoyan attacks the story from many
angles. "The Sweet Hereafter" is told from three time elements: the
present, 1997, when attorney Mitchell Stephens (Ian Holm) is flying to
meet with his troubled, drugged-out daughter; the recent past, 1995,
when Stephens arrives in town hoping to gather evidence for a
class-action suit after the accident; and then one week earlier at the
time of the crash told from the view of babysitter Nicole Burnell
(Sarah Polley), who survived the accident but now lives as a
paraplegic.</P>
<P>             As in "Exotica," the film centers around the babysitter as the
most important character, the bridge between the adults and the
children.</P>
<P>            Stephens arrives in town with the disturbed belief that he
will help the town get over its grief with a lawsuit. What else would
you expect from a lawyer? As Stephens explains to one couple, "There
is no such thing as an accident. That word doesn't mean a thing to
me."</P>
<P>        But Stephens is dealing with his own grief, the increasingly
distant relationship with his daughter who keeps in contact with him
through desperate phone calls. Egoyan's script calmly builds as Holm's
Stephens realizes the error of his ways by eventually sympathisizing
with the town's folk, not as a lawyer, but as father.</P>
<P>        The film's two discoveries, actually one discover and one
re-discovery, are Polley and Holm. Newcomer Polley, who also appeared
in "Exotica," is mesmerizing as she connects with distraught father
Billy Ansell (Egoyan regular Bruce Greenwood) as the town's only two
citizens questioning Stephens' motivation. Polley even does her own
singing in the film's soundtrack.</P>
<P>          The film's title come from the "Pied Piper of Hamelin," the
children's tale Nicole reads to Billy's children while
babysitting. The parallels between the B.C. town and Hamelin, another
town which lost its children, are on purpose.</P>
<P>          This is the first lead role I can ever remember for veteran
Holm, who has suddenly become a hot property after 1996's "Big Night."
Holm appeared in four 1997 features, but gives one of his best
performances since "Chariots of Fire." He transforms from a
manipulative lawyer planning to capitalize on the town's grief to an
attorney with a conscience. Of course, it's Nicole that helps him make
that transformation.</P>
