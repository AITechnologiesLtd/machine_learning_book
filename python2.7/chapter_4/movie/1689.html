<PRE>                             SCENT OF A WOMAN
                       A film review by Andrew Hall
                        Copyright 1993 Andrew Hall</PRE>
<P>     In this new drama, a real departure for director Martin Brest
(BEVERLY HILLS COP, MIDNIGHT RUN), Al Pacino stars as Frank Slade, a
retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel who happens to be blind.  Chris
O'Donnell co-stars as Charlie Simms, a poor kid on scholarship at a
well-to-do prep school.</P>
<P>     Unable to afford plane fare home for Thanksgiving, Charlie takes a
job over the holiday weekend taking care of Frank, who refuses to go
away with his daughter's family for the holiday.  Charlie is put off by
his first meeting with Frank, who has become an obnoxious, bitter,
boozing old man, but Frank's mother sweet-talks Charlie into taking the
job anyway.</P>
<P>     As soon as Frank's daughter leaves for the holiday, Frank reveals
that he has the whole weekend planned; a reluctant Charlie agrees to
accompany him in his travels.  Over the course of the weekend, Charlie
learns of Frank's unhappiness, and man and boy bond, in a way.</P>
<P>     This film is a journey for both characters:  for Frank, it is the
search for a reason to go on; for Charlie, it is the search for a father
figure.</P>
<P>     SCENT OF A WOMAN is mostly a drama, but there are a few good comic
bits here and there, mostly resulting from Frank's obnoxious behavior.
It doesn't resemble at all anything from MIDNIGHT RUN or BEVERLY HILLS
COP (which I liked), so just don't expect that.</P>
<P>     O'Donnell is convincing as the awkward, naive teenager who tries to
guide Frank.  But Pacino--well, what'd you expect?--gives a gritty,
realistic performance in probably the most challenging role of the year.
Don't bother to nominate Pacino for the Best Actor Oscar, just go ahead
and give it to him now (no need to disappoint the other nominees).</P>
<P>     Pacino manages to be obnoxious one second while being charming the
next.  And you really believe that he *is* blind.  I wonder:  did he
wear some kind of contact lenses to hinder his sight?</P>
<P>     But the film isn't without flaws.  My biggest complaint was the
ending, which (without ruining it for you) was just too sappy, too
resolute.  I also thought Pacino's speech was preachy and melodramatic,
thrown in for good measure, when it wasn't really necessary.  (The
speech reminded me of the ending to AND JUSTICE FOR ALL, where the
speech really *made* the film in that case).</P>
<P>     And Frank is sometimes unbelievable in the things he can do,
seemingly amazing for a blind person.  The dancing--*maybe*--but the
car, no way!</P>
<P>     Further, the film was a little long--a bit over two hours--but I
hardly noticed.</P>
<P>     All in all, SCENT OF A WOMAN is a pretty good film, a sometimes
intense drama with another great performance from Pacino.  I found it
very engaging.  See it.</P>
