<PRE>Movie Review: Trekkies (1998)
        Directed by Roger Nygard.                                              </PRE>
<P>I can't remember ever having laughed so hard at any movie...
let alone a documentary.  Not that the film mocks Trekkies. 
That would be cruel, as well as quite unnecessary  Plus it
would be counterproductive to the filmmaker's intent.  What
was done was simply send Denise Crosby and a film crew to
conventions and such, and let the Trekkies speak for
themselves.  Denise Crosby played the long-limbed Lt. Tasha
Yar on `Star Trek: The Next Generation'; her character was a
kind of low-wattage Seven of Nine.  She's almost absurdly tall
and blonde.  The  obsessive fans turn positively garrulous in
the presence of this minor deity of the Trek pantheon, although
a couple of them become confused to the point of forgetting
their names.</P>
<P>It's almost unfair.  As they ramble on, what stands out most is
their extraordinary earnestness.  In Trek they find a vision of
the future, a code to live one's life by.  One caller to a radio
show tells how a Trek episode helped him deal with a death in
his family.  Well and good, except that I couldn't help thinking
that maybe a moment in life as profound as the death of a
parent should be one's own, personal, and not influenced by
the plot of any TV show.</P>
<P>Realizing that theirs is an obsession, they feel compelled to
defend it.  And invariably sink themselves.  Certainly, it's okay
to like, even to be passionate about a TV show.  It's okay to get
together with other like minded fans, to talk and swap
memorabilia.  The next step is dressing up and getting in
character at these events, and that's okay too.  Since it's
nothing to be ashamed of,  the logical next step is getting on a
city bus and going to work that way.  By small steps of
Vulcan-like logic, they end up acting like crazy people.  </P>
<P>Invariably, they know there is a line that shouldn't be crossed.
Invariably, that line is always somewhere just around the bend. 
Like the 50-ish man who says he'd stop short of getting his ears
surgically altered to Spock points.  He has remodeled his home 
to resemble a Trek set, he goes to the supermarket in his
Starfleet uniform, his wife wears a uniform too and they've
even put one on their poodle.  But getting his ears done... no,
THAT would be crazy!</P>
<P>It's almost inspiring that people can be so impervious to
embarrassment.  Or so unencumbered by social niceties.  There
is a dentist in Florida whose office is a Trek microcosm.  He
wears the uniform, as does his staff; the decor is all Trek.  He
and his wife show Ms. Crosby around the place.  The tour
concluded, the wife explains that sometimes at home they `do'
different characters.  Since she's too short to play Denise
Crosby's character, she explains, her husband puts on a blonde
wig....  Okay, I don't know what was said next because at that
point I lost it.  As did Crosby.  (I've never seen someone
actually jump in astonishment before.)</P>
<P>Which brings up-- to mix my sci-fi metaphors-- the dark side of
the whole business.  There is the woman who keeps hundreds
of pictures of Brent Spiner, aka the android Data, in a steel
floor safe.  Lest they be lost to fire or earthquake, she explains
(see, it's all completely rational...)  Then there is the stuff that
fans send to the stars.  Crosby opens her garage: she's got
boxes full of it.  People have sent her artwork, including some
technically proficient and rather torrid nudes of her and the
aforementioned Data, embracing as lovers.  `At first,' she
explains, `I was offended.'  </P>
<P>AT FIRST?!!  I suspect she's being a bit disingenuous. Denise
Crosby proves much more skillful as an interviewer than she
has ever been as an actress.  By not  establishing any
boundaries, by not setting any limits with the Trekkies she
interviews, she lets them take plenty of rope.  They promptly
hang themselves.  And they have no one to blame but
themselves.</P>
