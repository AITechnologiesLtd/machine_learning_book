<PRE>                               SABRINA (1995)
                       A film review by Edwin Jahiel
                        Copyright 1996 Edwin Jahiel</PRE>
<P>SABRINA (1995) ** Directed by Sydney Pollack. Screenplay by Barbara 
Benedek & David Rayfiel. Based on the film "Sabrina" (1954) directed by 
Billy Wilder, written by Wilder, Samuel Taylor, Ernest Lehman, from the 
play "Sabrina Fair" by Samuel Taylor. Photography, Giuseppe Rotunno. 
Editing, Frederic Steinkamp. Production design, Brian Morris. Costumes, 
Ann Roth. Music, John Williams.  Cast: Julia Ormond (Sabrina Fairchild), 
Harrison Ford (Linus Larrabee), Greg Kinnear (David Larrabee), Nancy 
Marchand (Maud Larrabee), John Wood (Fairchild), Lauren Holly (Elizabeth

Dana Ivey (Mack), Elizabeth Franz (Joanna), Fanny Ardant (Irene), 
Patrick Bruel (Louis), Valerie Lemercier (Martine). A Paramount Picture. 
130 min. Rated PG.  </P>
<P>Except for special effects and technical innovations, Hollywood's 
exponentially increasing lack of imagination keeps it hacking away at 
remakes and sequels. The original "Sabrina" by Billy Wilder was almost 
unimprovable. There was no artistic reason to make it again, unless it 
was to make you appreciate the first movie even more.  </P>
<P>Much of the remake follows "Sabrina I" scene-for-scene, especially in 
the early sequences. For the rest, the changes add little, subtract a 
lot. Both films deal with a family of magnates on Long Island. Larrabee 
Industries is run by senior brother Linus (Humphrey Bogart then,  
Harrison Ford now), while junior brother David (William Holden, now Greg  
Kinnear), a company director in name only, keeps busy with wine and 
women (we don't know about song). </P>
<P>Years ago, the Larrabees imported from England a Rolls Royce along with 
chic chauffeur Fairchild (now a widower) and his daughter Sabrina 
(Audrey Hepburn in 1954, Julia Ormond in 1995). Sabrina has had forever 
a crush on David, who never noticed it  or her.  As a cure, she is sent 
to Paris by her father. She returns transformed into a lovely, 
sophisticated young woman on whom David puts the make. Bad news for 
Mother Larrabee (Nancy Marchand, awfully gowned and photographed like a 
gargoyle) and Linus. </P>
<P>David is engaged to Elizabeth Tyson, the daughter of powerful 
industrialists. Well beyond class distinctions is the fact that a 
Larrabee-Tyson merger is in the works. It will vanish if David does not 
marry Elizabeth. To eliminate the Sabrina danger, Linus begins to court 
her. She responds and Linus is hoist on his own petard, as anyone could 
have guessed from the start . </P>
<P>The superficial differences between the Wilder and the Pollack films are 
in the updating of the story by adjusting for inflation (the 1954 
million is now a billion), and means of locomotion (the Concorde, 
private helicopters and jets).  The real differences are in the cast, 
the direction, the Paris sequences and the dialogue.</P>
<P>No one, including Julia Ormond (pronounced OR-mond)  could in a million 
years approach the beauty, charm, elegance, distinction and 
distinctiveness of elfin, doe-eyed, adorable Audrey Hepburn--who, by the 
way,  also speaks excellent French. The Ormond hype of reviewers 
(e.g."We're melting") or of morning TV anchors ("So beautiful as to make 
you faint") has no basis. While throughout the first film, Hepburn 
convinces us with her many expressions and her romantic, schoolgirl 
crush on David, Ormond looks by comparison, older, stolid, rather 
expressionless, and generates about 70 watts of electricity with Ford 
and 40 watts without him.  </P>
<P>Greg Kinnear makes an OK screen debut yet lacks the warmth of William 
Holden, an actor who while never a pretty-boy had a commanding presence, 
without even trying to assert it. You may disapprove of Holden the 
playboy, but he charms you nonetheless, whereas Kinnear is more leering 
than attractive.</P>
<P>Ever likable Harrison Ford is appealing but here there is vagueness 
about his part and murkiness about his courtship. It is said that in the 
original Humphrey Bogart looked uncomfortable and actually said so, but 
Billy Wilder knew what he was doing. Casting Bogart against type was a 
coup. The contrast of a familiar persona shifting from tough guy to a 
romantic  upper-class pretender (in both senses) added a funny element 
that is lacking in the Ford character.  </P>
<P>In "Sabrina II,"  Nancy Marchand replaces Walter Hampden as the nominal 
head of the Larrabees. She has a few quips but I miss eccentric Old Man 
Larrabee who brought much amusing zip in his complicity with Linus.  At 
the same time, the economically stated poignancy in the first film's 
chauffeur Fairchild is now replaced by gimmicks.  </P>
<P>The direction is another problem. Writer-director Billy Wilder, a 
sophisticate from Austria, Germany, France and Hollywood, was among many 
things the collaborator and inheritor of Ernst Lubitsch and arguably the 
premier film-cynic of his time -- along with the gentler Preston 
Sturges. His work reflected European sophistication. At his best, Wilder 
put layers of meaning beneath what seemed to be obvious situations, 
lines or gags. His "Sabrina" was far funnier than the remake. In this 
film, Sydney Pollack, a first-rate craftsman with a first-rate crew, 
there are no subtleties or sub-texts.  </P>
<P>"Sabrina I" was part Eisenhower-era fantasy and part throwback to 1930s 
films that gave the poor of the Depression something to dream about. The 
remake is all of that plus a post-yuppie tale. </P>
<P>Bogart may have been a one-track-mind businessman, but he had a 
definite, marked sense of humor.  Ford is given little of this and 
though younger is more like a caricature of the entrepreneur with 
obsessive tunnel-vision who only thinks, works, lives business.  Notice 
how, during a big Larrabee garden party, one glimpses Bogart indoors, 
demonstrating a new product to potential buyers. In "Sabrina II," Ford 
is shown doing this twice (and with more screen time), to Arabs and to 
Japanese.</P>
<P>In general, the moneyed class in Number 1 was shown as rather natural 
within its wealth. In Number 2 there is something offensive,  
ostentatious, crass and tacky about the rich and famous. Typically, 
Kinnear says about his mother's birthday :"I bought her a little 
Picasso." Ford "How much did that cost me?" Kinnear: "I don't know." 
Later, Ford takes Ormond on his private plane and is twice rude to the 
bubbling lady-attendant. There's more along those lines too. </P>
<P>The Paris sections of "Sabrina I" are utterly charming. Sabrina goes to 
cooking school where the teacher-chef is very funny, while Marcel Dalio 
plays an elderly student, a delightful nobleman who sophisticates 
Sabrina.  In "Sabrina II," somehow Sabrina works for Vogue magazine. The 
sequences are way too long, disconnected and cliched. Sabrina almost 
loses her virginity to a young Frenchman (who gives her silly, pithy 
advice, too). There is forced semi-slapstick. The French scenes feel 
like the hundred-franc first-timers' tour of Picturesque Paris as well 
as a visual derivative of the Astaire-Hepburn movie "Funny Face." The 
movie's guiding principle seems to be that more is more. </P>
<P>The first date of Linus and Sabrina is pretty straightforward in 
"Sabrina I" but needlessly long and complicated in the remake. Linus 
falling for Sabrina is gradual in "Sabrina I," too sudden in "Sabrina 
II." Then Ford tells Marchand something like "Don't worry, I'll ditch 
her" yet minutes later is ooohing over the girl.</P>
<P>There's overkill in several ways. For example, back from Paris, at the 
Long Island train station, Sabrina  arrives outrageously overdressed for 
someone fresh off a plane. Ask any transatlantic traveler. (In the 
identical scene of "Sabrina I" the same error was made, but at least the 
young lady had come by boat).    </P>
<P>The new film lacks the wit, class and pacing of the original. There are 
some improvements, no doubt, but those that come readily to mind are 
mostly the amusing Dana Ivey as Linus's secretary and the way in which 
David finds out that the chic lady he picked up at the railroad station 
is Sabrina. </P>
<P>For those who worry about May-December couples, they will find the 
remake more acceptable. Ormond looks pretty mature and Ford not at all 
over-the-hill. In real life Ford (age 53) is 23 years older than Ormond 
(age 30).  </P>
<P>In "Sabrina I," Hepburn, then 25, was 11 years younger than William 
Holden and 30 years younger than Humphrey Bogart. In all of her movies, 
she looked convincingly very much younger than her age. And in something 
of a convention in Hepburn films, she was involved with much older 
leading men. The age gap ought to have been blatant, but the handling of 
most of those movies plus Audrey's charm made the difference in years 
more acceptable than expected.</P>
