<PRE>The Mod Squad *</PRE>
<P>rated R
starring Claire Danes, Omar Epps, Giovanni Ribisi, Dennis Farina, Josh
Brolin, Steve Harris, Michael Lerner, Richard Jenkins
written by Stephen T. Kay, Scott Silver, and Kate Lanier
directed by Scott Silver </P>
<P>About five minutes into Scott Silver's awful THE MOD SQUAD, I had
already made up my mind to leave the theater. But just as I was
getting out of my chair, a feeling hit me.  Maybe by the end of this
review, I'll know what that feeling was.</P>
<P>Now I know that in most of my reviews I reserve the second paragraph
to describe the plot, but I looked hard at THE MOD SQUAD and couldn't
find one. Those of you who watched the 60's TV series on which this
film is based know that the "mod squad" is a group of three young
criminals (Claire Danes, Omar Epps, Giovanni Ribisi) who are sent out
to become undercover cops. In this two hour long episode (hmm, maybe
the show wasn't this bad) they are sent out by their boss (Dennis
Farina) to execute some kind of drug bust. The funny thing is that
there is not one engaging plot twist to be found at all. For some
reason though, when I decided not to walk out, I became oddly drawn
towards the screen. In no way was I engrossed in the experience, but
there was something subtle in the film that begged me to like it even
the slightest bit. I mean, the film at least lookd great, thanks to
some great cinematography by Ellen Kuras and three very fresh-looking
young faces. Each one of these actors has shown incredible potential
in their prior film outings. Get Danes, Epps, and Ribisi together in a
film with a decent script and I'll be first in line to see it. And
somebody please give Giovanni Ribisi a good role! How come the brat
pack from SUBURBIA (Steve Zahn, Giovanni Ribisi, Parker Posey, Ajay
Naidu) is all of a sudden selling out. SUBURBIA's one of my favorite
movies for G-d's sake! As you can tell by now, I have gone off topic
in this very personal review of THE MOD SQUAD, but I have finally
figured out what made me sit through it. I ended up feeling sorry not
for any character in the film, but for the entire production itself.</P>
