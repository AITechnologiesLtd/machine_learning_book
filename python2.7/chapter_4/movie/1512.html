<PRE>                         TWIN PEAKS: FIRE WALK WITH ME
                       A film review by Sarah M. Elkins
                        Copyright 1992 Sarah M. Elkins</PRE>
<P>TWIN PEAKS: FIRE WALK WITH ME:  "Prequel" to David Lynch's TV series
"Twin Peaks."</P>
<P>Plot/kick-off: An FBI agent investigates the death of a woman.  FBI
Special Agent Dale Cooper investigates this later on, and then the FBI
aspect is dropped almost completely as we turn up in the little
northwestern town of Twin Peaks, leading up to almost the very start of
the TV series.</P>
<P>Characters/acting:  Sheryll Lee turned in a very good performance as
Laura Palmer.  More than just the "woman in jeopardy," she was complex,
sometimes subtle and sometimes "out there" as the role demanded.  Other
Peaks returning regulars included Kyle MacLachlan as Coop, James, Miguel
Ferres as Albert, Leland, Shelly, Bobby and Norma.  Chris Isaak, Kiefer
Southerland, David Bowie in early scenes.</P>
<P>Cinematography/FX:  Some beautiful scenes, and some really weird scenes.
More of the red-curtained room and "The Lodge."  How do they make
Douglass firs look frightening?  Probably would lose a little on the
small screen.  Again very effective in the blend of supernatural with
reality.</P>
<P>Score/Sound: Similar to series.  New song by Julee Cruise.  Pretty gross
sounds during one autopsy.</P>
<P>Violence/Gore:  Dead bodies, bloody/split foreheads, most kill/scare
scenes imply rather than show directly.</P>
<P>Language: Oh, probably some, nothing really strong that I recall.</P>
<P>Skin/situations:  Lots.  Lots and lots.  Steamy in parts, and
non-traditional in others.  Topless dancing/foreplay, but not actually
much sex per se, not graphically shown anyway.  Not as wild as the
diary.</P>
<P>Analysis:  What *is* it with the creamed corn?  Yep, we're still left with
questions after seeing the movie.  It will answer a few of the ones we
had, but definitely not all.  That's okay with me, but it probably won't
be with some other viewers.  It's hard for me to make a call on whether
anyone who doesn't like Lynch or didn't watch "Twin Peaks" the series
would like the movie, but as a wild guess I will say, "Probably not."  I
thought it was a pretty good ride, though it was less scary as the end
drew near, since I had a better idea of what was going to happen near
the series start.</P>
