<PRE>Review: Pleasantville (1998)
Review By: Ryan Davis</PRE>
<P>        When I watch Nick at Night, I laugh at the simplicity of the old TV
shows. Shows like `Leave It to Beaver' [1957-1963], and `The Andy Griffin
Show' [1960-1968] really made life look downright pleasant, or is it?</P>
<P>        David (Tobey Maguire), a high school student, is a huge fan of a
fifties television show called Pleasantville. One day in preparation for a
Pleasantville marathon, he and his sister, Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) get in
a fight over what to watch on television. During the brief fight, they break
the television remote. Magically and without warning, a television repairman
(Don Knotts) appears and gives them a new remote control. With the press of a
button David and Jennifer are actually transported into Pleasantville.</P>
<P>        The two teens are instantly given a new family and a new life in the
entirely black and white town. Their new parents are delightful fifties
stereotypes. The father (William H. Macy) works all day to provide for the
family, and bowls with his friends in the evening. The mother (Joan Allen)
cooks and cleans all day and always has dinner ready for her husband when he
comes home from work.</P>
<P>        Pleasantville, at first glance, appears to be paradise. Upon further
study, they find a world infected with censorship and oppression. Things
begin to change in Pleasantville, and the citizens that break free of the
usual monotony are changed from black and white into color. These `coloreds'
are looked upon as weaker people, and are banned from stores and are outcast
in the black and white community. The film continues on as David and Jennifer
discover that maybe the `good old days,' are not as good as they seemed to
be.</P>
<P>        The movie, itself, is visually stunning and quite beautiful. The way
that black and white is mixed with color is simply brilliant. I wouldn't be
surprised if Pleasantville was nominated for art and cinematography Oscars.</P>
<P>        The acting is also great. Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon do a
great job in their leading roles. Although it is really the terrific
supporting performances by William H. Macy, Joan Allen, the late J.T. Walsh,
Jeff Daniels, and the perfectly cast Don Knotts, that propel this film. The
leads have the most screen time, but they are nowhere near as interesting as
the characters each of these actors play.</P>
<P>        Pleasantville is an incredibly symbolic movie. In fact, it is far too
symbolic. Instead of concentrating on one or even two topics, it spreads
itself far to thin. After only one screening I noticed references to Nazism,
Racism, Individualism, Christianity, Judaism, Communism, Socialism and more.
With so much taking place it becomes almost muddled and unclear.</P>
<P>        Pleasantville runs a little over two hours long and it feels like
more. While some of the scenes are incredible, some seem to add absolutely
nothing to the story. Better editing would have made this movie much more
enjoyable.</P>
<P>Pleasantville still manages to be entertaining, and at least interesting to
watch. While it is about 20 minutes to long it is still rather humorous,
thought provoking, and contains a number of great performances.</P>
