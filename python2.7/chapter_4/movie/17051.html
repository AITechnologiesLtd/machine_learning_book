Susan Granger's review of "THE DEEP END OF THE OCEAN" (Columbia Pictures)</P>
<P>Based on Jacquelyn Mitchard's 1996 deeply moving novel, this
family drama revolves around every parent's worst nightmare: losing a
child. Michelle Pfeiffer plays Beth Cappadora, a loving, devoted
mother who juggles the demands of caring for her family with a career
as a photographer.  With her three small children, she arrives at a
Chicago hotel for her 15th highschool reunion weekend and, when she
glances away for a moment, her three year-old son disappears in the
middle of a crowded lobby. Despite a desperate search, he vanishes
without a trace. This tragedy has a devastating effect on Beth, her
husband (Treat Williams), and family but, eventually, their lives
return to some degree of normalcy - until, nine years later, a 12
year-old boy (Ryan Merriman) knocks on their door. Could it be he?
With the help of a tenacious police detective (Whoopi Goldberg), they
unravel a tangled web leading to a reunion which, in turn, raises
another emotionally wrenching dilemma. The boy has no memory of his
biological family, having been raised by a loving, adoptive father
(John Kapelos). What should they do?</P>
<P>Director Ulu Gossbard handles the melodramatic story with
sensitivity and the cast is superb. I find fault with the
stereotypical Hollywood ending but any other resolution might also not
play well. Problem is: there is no credible, satisfying answer for
everyone involved, which was the problem with "Losing Isiah," a
previous film that tackled the same subject matter. Three-time Oscar
nominee Michelle Pfeiffer delivers another memorable performance, and
she spear-headed the development of this film through her company Via
Rosa. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The Deep End of the
Ocean" is a powerful, thought-provoking 7, a heartbreaking story.</P>
