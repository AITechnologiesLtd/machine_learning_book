Grade: A-

Screenplay: Robert Altman, Brian McKay
Starring: Warren Beatty, Julie Christie, Rene Auberjonois, William Devane,
Shelly
Duvall, Keith Carradine</PRE>
<P> A young gunslinger stands on one end of a suspension bridge. On the other end,
a kind, young man (Keith Carradine) who simply wants to cross the bridge. The
gunslinger won't let him; he obstructs, badgering the poor fellow. The young
man has revealed his weakness; he doesn't want any trouble. Though the
gunslinger is eager to test him, and push him so he could kill him, which he
does.</P>
<P>"Let me see your gun," the gunslinger demands.</P>
<P>The young man stammers slightly before reluctantly pulling it out, with no
intention of using it. The gunslinger shoots the young man dead, as the
denizens of the town look on. The moment is directed with such casualness that
it feels more authentic than any kinetic gun battle Peknipah staged. Both of
the actors chosen for the minor parts add additional layers to the scene. The
kid who plays the gunslinger has harmless, cherubic features, resembling a
younger, chubbier Leonardo Di Caprio. This makes his actions appear much more
disturbing than if a more macho actor had played him. We get the feeling that
this kid has been raised in a culture where killers are lionized, and cowardice
is despised. He has found a prey that is weaker than him; therefore it would be
foolish not to attack. He's like a child playing COWBOYS AND INDIANS, only for
real. Keith Carradine acts so kind, and endearingly, it's dismaying to see him
die because of those very qualities. I think the scene's ultimate effectiveness
lies in its jarring placement. It happens mid-way through the film, and has
nothing to do with the "story". But it also has everything to do with it.</P>
<P>McCABE AND MRS.MILLER is a Western, though unlike most. Its "hero" is indeed a
mysterious stranger who rides into town as mysterious strangers often do in
Westerns. He's also a drunk, and a gambler, with little honor; he's not above
shooting an enemy in the back. Julie Christie plays his "love interest", a
surreptitious, drug-addicted madam with an incentive towards cash that
supersedes everything else. She is a hooker, and one with a heart of coal.
These cleverly employed details (details that turn the usual cliches upside
down and inside out) are trademarks of a director partial to deconstructing a
genre rather than perpetuating it. Robert Altman does just that, exploding
Western myths and putting his own in there place. This was a common practice of
directors in the mid-1970's. Speilberg did a similar deconstruction of the
action-adventure genre with JAWS.</P>
<P>The setting of McCABE is a dilapidated frontier town blanketed with mud and
snow. Interiors are dully lit by gas lamps, illuminating dirty faces with a
vague, red-yellow hue. Nothing is idealized in Altman's vision, not even the
hookers, who look just as dirty as the town.</P>
<P>The film was based on a conventional Western novel, written by Edmund Naughton.
Altman lobotomized the novel, taking it's basic story and improvising his way
through it, as is his style. This particular method has produced some
masterpieces (M*A*S*H, SHORT CUTS), and just as many abysmal failures (QUINTET,
READY TO WEAR). True to Altman's form, much of the speech is purposely muddied,
and occasionally words are drowned out by other words. The dialogue is
conversational (one man asks another if he should trim his facial hair), and
often amusingly so; we're not used to seeing characters make small talk in a
Western. This is the antithesis of a generic Sergio Leone flick; it's like
viewing a slice of life that just happens to take place in a Western setting.
Because of this, the plot points seem to come informally and not always when
expected.</P>
<P>Warren Beatty plays McCabe as a stubborn anti-hero with an unflappable cool the
actor can't seem to shake. Beatty's persona is an intermittent parody of a
traditional leading man, and a rendering of one. He speaks in a fearlessly
controlled tone, conveying his self-righteousness. And that self-righteousness
is his characters' inevitable downfall.</P>
<P>Julie Christie plays the madam (McCabe's business partner), Mrs.Miller. When
the two meet, they immediately dislike each other, trading insults as most
future lovers often do in the movies. We naturally expect them soften up, and
fall in love. That never happens, though they do have cold, calculated sex.
They're relationship doesn't go were it is "supposed" to, and I am forever
thankful for both of they're fates. Altman closes his film with some
understated, lyrically profound shots that are haunting and poignant.</P>
<P>To call McCABE a simple exercise in genre deconstruction would be a
misrepresentation. It's a work that is alive with emotion and lyricism.
Altman's greatest films have much in common; they rely on naturalistic,
meandering encounters, languidly building to a substantial close. And it works
the best when the characters are fascinating and multifaceted. That is the case
with this film. The seemingly inconsequential moments add up to something very
consequential.</P>
