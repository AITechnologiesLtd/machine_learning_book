THE SIXTH DAY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Two Arnolds for the price of one.  How could you go wrong with a recipe 
like that?  Well, in THE 6TH DAY, director Roger Spottiswoode (TOMORROW 
NEVER DIES) doesn't, coming up with an intelligent and high energy 
science fiction tale that is a lot of good old fashioned fun.</P>
<P>Set in a time -- "In the near future.  Sooner than you think." -- in 
which cloning has become possible, the cautionary movie opens with an 
XFL football game.  (Just think of the product placement fees that the 
XFL had to come up with for that plug.  The NFL, the story explains, is 
in the midst of a 4-year player strike.)  The first $300,000,000 
quarterback is severely injured in the game.   The solution, of course, 
is cloning.  Although cloning of human organs and of entire animals is 
legal, complete cloning of humans is against the law, so the replacement 
strategy for the quarterback is kept strictly secret.</P>
<P>As Drucker, the head of a cloning conglomerate and of the XFL, Tony 
Goldwyn (GHOST) is a villain who is a bit too cold for the part.  His 
chief scientist, Dr. Graham Weir, is significantly underplayed by Robert 
Duvall.  The rest of the supporting casting, however, including Michael 
Rapaport as Arnold's sidekick and Michael Rooker, Rodney Rowland and 
Sarah Wynter, as Drucker's thugs, works quite well.</P>
<P>Arnold Schwarzenegger, as helicopter pilot Adam Gibson, is at the top of 
his form.  He is lovable, humorous, vulnerable and strong.  A man who 
has been known for some robotic acting at times, Arnold is remarkably 
human this time, even when he is a clone.  Early in the story, he is 
cloned and the bad guys under Drucker's orders try to find the real Adam 
and eliminate him with the use of some cool guns.  If people find out 
that there are two Adams, Drucker will go to jail, and his operation 
will be shut down.</P>
<P>The gadgetry becomes an engrossing and hilarious subplot in its own 
right.  Carefully mixing the future with the present, all of the 
technological toys seem quite realistic.  Car's navigational systems 
have become capable of autopiloting.  Holographic images have become the 
billboards of the future.  Kid's dolls become a creepy cross between a 
real girl and something from THE BRIDE OF CHUCKY.  Get arrested and you 
are instantly given a virtual court appointed attorney.  And if you have 
been worried about sex on the Internet, wait until you see what is 
possible with a full-sized virtual sex toy.  The latter is one of many 
reasons why the film's PG-13 rating is a bit questionable.</P>
<P>You back up your data regularly, or you should, but do you back up your 
brain?  Drucker does.  Memory dumping becomes part of this intriguing 
and complex story, whose twists come quickly and often.  Even if part of 
it is familiar ground for an Arnold actioner, it is none the less 
entertaining.  It may not be the sort of movie that you'll be discussing 
a week later, but while you're there, you'll have a high old time.</P>
<P>THE 6TH DAY runs 2:04.  It is rated PG-13 for strong action violence, 
brief strong language and some sensuality and would be acceptable for 
teenagers.</P>
