<P>     MOONRAKER is a sort of James Bond meets STAR WARS.  Released in 
1979, the year that saw the arrival of STAR TREK on the big screen, 
MOONRAKER was the latest film to latch onto the science fiction revival 
started by George Lucas' 1977 picture.  Audiences flocked to see 
MOONRAKER, making it the highest grossing 007 movie before GOLDENEYE.  
The mixture of escapist action and space shoot-outs found favor with the 
American public.  Indeed, while parts of MOONRAKER are rather silly (a 
trend during Roger Moore's tenure), solid special effects, well-executed 
action sequences, and a strict reliance upon the "Bond Formula" keep 
this film among Moore's better entries as the British superspy.</P>
<P>     Although promotional material for the film highlighted the outer 
space sequences, most of MOONRAKER takes place on Earth, in such diverse 
locations as California, Brazil, and Venice.  Both Bond girls are 
residents of this planet, as well (007 has yet to bed an alien) -- Lois 
Chiles as Holly Goodhead, CIA operative and trained astronaut, and 
Corinne Clery as Corinne Dufour, the assistant to megalomaniac du jour 
Drax (Michael Lonsdale).  </P>
<P>     The film opens with the hijacking of a Moonraker space shuttle on 
loan from the United States to Great Britain.  Anxious to get to the 
bottom of the situation, the British government sends agent 007 to 
investigate, beginning with Drax Industries in California, where the 
shuttle was produced.  Bond arrives, starts poking around, and becomes 
the immediate target of several murder attempts.  Along the way, he 
strikes up a relationship with Dr. Holly Goodhead, one of Drax's chief 
scientists, and encounters an old adversary -- Jaws (again played by 
Richard Kiel).</P>
<P>     While MOONRAKER's centerpiece is the final half-hour, which takes 
place aboard an Earth-orbiting space station, this is actually the least 
entertaining portion of the film.  It's essentially a special effects 
demonstration, with laser bolt shootouts and space shuttles firing at 
deadly satellites.  Most of the tense action scenes occur before Bond 
blasts into outer space.  If nothing else, this film proves that Bond is 
best on Earth.  </P>
<P>     Special note should be made of John Barry's score, his best since 
ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE.  Barry weaves the familiar "James Bond 
theme" and "007 theme" into a rich musical tapestry whose main thread is 
the MOONRAKER title track.  In addition, Barry uses an unusually diverse 
selection of musical cues, including the familiar theme from THE 
MAGNIFICENT SEVEN and the five-note greeting from CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF 
THE THIRD KIND.</P>
<P>     Normally, characters in Bond films don't go through much 
development.  Such is not the case with Jaws, however.  One of 007's 
best adversaries returns for a second engagement (he was also in THE SPY 
WHO LOVED ME).  This time, however, the steel-toothed bad guy has 
mellowed as the direct result of falling in love.  Although Jaws is 
still as indestructible as ever, we see a different side of him as 
MOONRAKER draws to a close.  Just don't expect anything too dramatic -- 
this is still a James Bond movie, after all.</P>
<P>     MOONRAKER marked Bernard Lee's final appearance as M.  The actor 
died while preparing for the next Bond film, FOR YOUR EYES ONLY.  No M 
since has matched Lee's interpretation, and only with his passing did it 
become apparent how important this minor character is to the 007 
adventures.</P>
<P>     As Roger Moore's fourth Bond outing, and the eleventh film in the 
series, MOONRAKER is a satisfying followup to THE SPY WHO LOVED ME.  
Science fiction fans may be offended by some of the liberties taken 
here, but tolerance is necessary.  The film is, after all, geared 
towards a specific audience.  Accent the "fiction" in science fiction, 
and recognize that with Bond, realism is the last thing anyone expects -
- or wants. </P>
