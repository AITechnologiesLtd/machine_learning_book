                                HERCULES
                          A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1997 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1997) *** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        HERCULES is the first animated Disney film in a long 
time that doesn't seem like it came from Disney. It's entertaining, 
yes, and has the usual Disney trappings -- a story, adapted from 
classic literature, about stumbling hero who strikes it big, has a cute 
animal sidekick and a beautiful cartoon woman, but has to fight a 
very-evil villain with a cute animal sidekick of his own -- but it's got 
the cheap laughs of a Warner Bros. effort. It's more SPACE JAM 
than HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME.</P>
<P>        Visually, HERCULES is on the Warner Bros. level, or 
maybe half a notch above the Disney afternoon cartoon shows. 
Its characters all look like caricatures and the backgrounds are 
generally unimpressive, but there are a few beautifully-animated 
scenes, all of which seem to take place in the evil underworld. The 
other scenes are pretty autopilot, which makes me wonder where 
Disney's priorities lie. Maybe these people _are_ as aligned with the 
devil as folks at the American Family Association say.</P>
<P>        I've pretty much forgotten all the Greek mythology stuff I 
learned in freshman English, so forgive me if I don't rattle off the 
names of the gods with the greatest of ease. I remember Hades, 
Hermes, Herpes, Sneezy and Doc, and at the head of it all -- the 
gods of the gods -- are Zeus and Hera. They have a baby at the 
beginning and name him (what else?) Hercules. Zeus gives him a 
playpen companion, a winged horse baby named Pegasus. I'm all for 
pets but a baby and a horse sleeping together is a little odd, even for 
mythology.</P>
<P>        Things are peaceful on Mount Olympus, but as we all 
know, when a baby is born in the Disney world, there's a villain 
there to sabotage. This time it's Hades, lord of the underworld, who 
is so evil he has blue fire for hair. Voiced by James Woods, Hades is 
one of the best things about this movie, an enemy worthy of Disney. 
His two cute animal sidekicks, Pain and Panic (voices of Bobcat 
Goldthwait and Matt Frewer, both of whom needed the paycheck), 
can change themselves into whatever form they wish.</P>
<P>        Old Hades kidnaps Hercules and strips him of his god 
status, but since he didn't drink all the evil potion, he still has the 
strength of a god. So he's trapped on earth, raised by an elderly 
couple who think he fell from heaven, just like Superman. There are 
a couple unintentionally amusing scenes that follow, where we see 
a 12-year-old Hercules called Jercules by his insensitive peers, who 
just can't accept that he's different. Ever wonder what it's like to 
wander the world, knowing you're a god, and not having anyone 
believe you? By the way, Shirley MacLaine, that's a rhetorical 
question...</P>
<P>        Hercules grows up and finds out he can't return to the table 
of the gods until he proves himself a true hero, which is cartoon 
code for "the end of the movie." That means he has to save the world 
from centaurs, giants, Limbaughs and all sorts of mythological 
beasts with the aid of his half-goat personal trainer (voice of Danny 
DeVito). There's also the femme fatale, Meg, who tries not to fall in 
love with Herc but can't resist.</P>
<P>        HERCULES is good fun, but it's definitely one of the lesser 
movies of the Disney revolution that began with THE LITTLE 
MERMAID. It's the only one besides POCAHONTAS in which the 
attempts at drama fall completely flat, leaving only the surface-level 
jokes and songs to entertain. You get the feeling the Disney people 
are reaching with a lot of that present-past humor too -- once 
Hercules becomes a hero, all the cool Athens kids are wearing 
Air-Herc shoes. Flintstones, meet the Flintstones...</P>
