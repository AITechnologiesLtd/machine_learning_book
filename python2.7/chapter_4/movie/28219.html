AMORES PERROS</PRE>
<P>Directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu</P>
<P>Screenplay by Guillermo Arriaga (from his novel)</P>
<PRE>De Vargas     NR     153 min     subtitles</PRE>
<P>     The movie opens with a high-speed car chase through the crowded 
streets of Mexico City. A wounded dog lies bleeding on the back seat of 
the pursued vehicle.  The chase ends in a two-car collision that's 
horrific even by our jaded moviegoing standards.  And from that deadly 
intersection we move back and forward in time, following three separate 
stories of dogs, love, and violence that occasionally brush up against 
each other.</P>
<P>     Though the end credits assure us that no dogs were hurt in the 
making of this film, it will still test the sensibilities of animal 
lovers.  At the very least, a few dogs must have been drugged, or else 
sent for extensive method training at the Canine Actor's Studio.  The 
first story centers on a teenager who earns a nest egg to run away with 
his brother's young wife  by entering his dog in dogfights, which he 
wins until an opponent spectacularly cheats.  The grimy arenas awash in 
fur and blood are likely to be more upsetting to many audiences than the 
human violence, though there's plenty of the latter as well. </P>
<P>     The second, and least effective, story concerns a supermodel and 
her married lover, and her fluffy little dog Richie who gets stuck 
beneath the polished floor of their new apartment when he dives through 
a hole in pursuit of a ball.  The metaphors run a bit thick here, but 
what undercuts this section most is the unbelievability of the 
characters' responses.</P>
<P>     The last part of the triptych features El Chivo, a man who was once 
a college professor with a wife and small daughter, then a revolutionary 
guerilla, then a convict.  Now he's a homeless bum who makes a sporadic 
living as an assassin, living in filth and shattered illusions in an 
abandoned building with the pack of stray dogs he's taken in.  He yearns 
for a reunion with the grown daughter who thinks he's dead, and he's a 
walking case study in the maxim that no good deed goes unpunished.</P>
<P>     Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, who grew up in Mexico City, 
sees the love, loyalty, and brutality of dogs mirrored in the lives of 
the people who feed and care for them them.  It's the first theatrical 
feature for Inarritu, but he handles it with a veteran's sureness.  
Comparisons are inevitable with Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, and also with 
Soderberg's Traffic; Inarritu lacks Tarantino's cocky comic swagger, but 
he leaves Soderberg in the dust.  In part he benefits from the use of a 
cast of talented actors unknown here, who create their characters 
without the distraction of recognition.  Best is Emilio Echeverria as El 
Chivo, the hirsute hit man, whose face rivets our attention whenever he 
rambles across the screen.  If  it were Michael Douglas in the role, no 
matter how good he was, a part of our consciousness would be distracted 
by his Michael Douglasness.</P>
<P>     Inarritu set out to explore the social structure of Mexico City in 
this film, and he does it best when he stays in its sprawling 
underbelly, where it's a dog-eat-dog world.  Amores Perros was Mexico's 
entry in the Oscars, and it's a terrific movie - if you can stomach the 
(simulated) dogfights.</P>
