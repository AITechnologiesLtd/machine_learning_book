<P>The similarities between this film and the John Travolta lawyer drama A
CIVIL ACTION (6.5/10) are uncanny. Both films are based on actual events,
feature strong leads pursuing legal cases against major multinationals that
have allegedly contaminated the water supply of local towns. The main
difference between the two films would have to do with the former featuring
a cutthroat, rich, successful lawyer going against the system (also a man),
while this one features a twice-divorced, uneducated, sexpot with three kids
doing the same thing (oh yeah, and she's a woman!).</P>
<P>PLOT:
A sexy divorcee with no formal education and a lot of debt forces herself
into a filing job at her lawyer's office, only to run into a lot of internal
politics and lack of respect from her co-workers. It isn't until one day
while filing away a case that she is intrigued by the details, and takes on
the task of researching the case further on her own. After much hard work,
determination, and personal sacrifice, she and the firm begin to put
together one of the biggest direct-action lawsuits in U.S. history.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Despite its slow moments, extended runtime and similarities in plot to A
CIVIL ACTION, this film managed to make me like it based entirely on its
excellent performances by its shining star Julia Roberts and her rough-gruff
counterpart Albert Finney. I know it's still early in the year, but Albert
should definitely be remembered come Oscar time next year in the category of
supporting players. I don't remember the last time I truly enjoyed seeing
this type of love-hate relationship work so well in a film, especially
without it involving sex between the couple in question. The characters
drawn here are quite opposite, save for the mutual respect that both
obviously feel for one another, but to watch them go head-to-head on various
issues is just great cinema. The story itself isn't extremely original or
particularly engaging to behold (in spite of it being based on real events),
the pacing sometimes slow, and the predictability factor pretty high on all
counts. But what generally makes or breaks films of this type are their
focus on character, character, character, and this film succeeds in
radiating light through its stars.</P>
<P>Even Aaron Eckhart, the only other significant player in the film, comes
through as the boyfriend standing by his strong female companion as she
takes on, what seems like, the world. And even though this film was a little
foreseeable, I did find it refreshing to finally soak in a movie that
focused more on the achievements of a woman, rather than that of men. So if
only for that reason, check it out and "watch them women, hear them roar!".
Of course, some of the roaring is also being handled by the flock of
mini-skirts and push-em-up bras that Julia's character dons during this
picture, but it is not as much of a focus as the film's trailer makes it out
to be (Them marketing folks is smart!). So does the movie present the viewer
with a lot of conflict, obstacles or tension? Not really. I was barely ever
anxious to see what would happen next and rarely felt as though things
wouldn't work out for everyone involved, but then again, this film doesn't
pretend to be a thriller. It's an interesting, small tale of a woman who
never knew what she could be in life, until she actually went out and became
it. It's pretty inspiring, it's got one of the most feel-good last scenes in
a movie this year, and once again, features a couple of charming
performances by two great actors at the top of their game.</P>
<P>If you love Julia Roberts, you will most likely enjoy this run-of-the-mill
story, despite it running a little too long, and you will definitely come to
further appreciate the broad talent of Mr. Albert Finney, who pulls off one
of his finest performances in years. All in all, a decent "lawyer movie",
which consciously avoids any long, boring courtroom scenes. Thank you for
that, Mr. Soderbergh.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Pay close attention to one of the earlier scenes with Julia and her kids in
a restaurant, since the waitress serving them is none other than the REAL
Erin Brockovich-Ellis herself! As an inside joke, she is apparently wearing
a nametag that reads "Julia".
Julia Roberts reportedly earned $20,000,000 for her role in this film.
Collectively, her films have grossed more than $2 billion worldwide.
Albert Finney was born in Manchester, England and is apparently the only
person in history to ever call Audrey Hepburn a "bitch"...in the film TWO
FOR THE ROAD (okay, okay...so it was a line in the movie).
Writer Susannah Grant's previous work as a screenwriter was on the
Cinderella tale, EVER AFTER (7/10), starring Drew Barrymore. Her next
writing gig also stars a woman, Sandra Bullock in the drama 28 DAYS. And for
once, the events depicted in this film are apparently very accurate in terms
of what really happened to Erin in her own life. Only some of the peripheral
characters are fictitious or amalgamations of real people from her life. In
fact, photographs shown to the crew by the real Erin prove that she really
did sport 8-inch mini-skirts, 3-inch heels and plunging necklines during
these trying times. A look that she still abides by to this day and
apparently looks terrific!
This film was spawned from an appointment that executive producer Carla
Santos Shamberg had with her chiropractor. For it was as she was lying on
her practitioner's table that she overheard a conversation about another
patient whose story was larger than life. And yes, that other patient was
none other than Erin Brockovich. Carla told her husband Michael about the
story, Michael told Danny DeVito and Stacey Sher, with whom he runs Jersey
Films, and the rest is movie-making history.</P>
