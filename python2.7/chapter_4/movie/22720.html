LETHAL WEAPON
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>The author of this review didn't need advice of Wes Craven
to build opinion about movie sequels. Together with remakes,
now extremely popular among big studio executives, sequels
represent the embodiment of Hollywood's creative bankruptcy.
I became aware of that almost decade and half ago, when the
inevitable comparisons between sequels and original films
began giving disappointing results. To make thing even
worse, bad quality of sequels even managed to change the
initial good impressions of originals. Such thing almost
happened to LETHAL WEAPON, one of the most successful movie
franchises in modern Hollywood. The slide of quality in
sequels wasn't that severe, but the change of character was.
While the last film in the series represents one of the
purest examples of action comedy genre and "high concept",
the 1987 original, directed by Richard Donner, was made as
deadly serious police film.</P>
<P>The plot, based on the screenplay by Shane Black, is set in
Los Angeles during Christmas. Roger Murtaugh (played by
Danny Glover) is black LAPD homicide detective who has just
turned 50 and has every reason to be proud of his life
achievements - perfect service record, nice family and
suburban home that is embodiment of American dream. Martin
Riggs (played by Mel Gibson) is white LAPD narcotics
detective who became expert in marksmanship and martial arts
while serving in Special Forces during Vietnam War; recent
death of beloved wife, on the other hand, made him
emotionally unstable and nearly suicidal so nobody wants to
work with him. Murtaugh reluctantly becomes his partner and
two policemen, who don't have anything in common except
Vietnam War record, starts investigating suicide of
high-class prostitute. The case stops being routine when it
turns out that the prostitute happened to be daughter of
Michael Hunsaker (played by Tom Atkins), rich banker and
Murtaugh's war buddy. Hunsaker hints that his daughter's was
actually murdered in order to stop him from spilling beans
about large and sinister conspiracy. His words are taken
seriously when everyone connected with the case, including
him, starts getting killed by expert assassins. Murtaugh and
Riggs continue with the investigation that would lead them
towards "Shadow Company", group of former CIA agents and
mercenaries led by General McAllister (played by Mitchell
Ryan). In the meantime, Riggs himself becomes assassin's
target and Murtaugh's daughter Rianne (played by Traci
Wolfe) gets kidnapped.</P>
<P>First viewing of LETHAL WEAPON was more than pleasant
surprise to me. On the surface, the script contains enough
cliches to make this film indistinguishable from multitude
of 1980s action romps featuring Vietnam veterans and their
deadly skills being used on hordes of evil drug dealers in
three-piece suits. But LETHAL WEAPON looks different from an
average film of such kind, thanks to the very good direction
by Richard Donner. This director never belonged to the major
league of Hollywood filmmakers, but his reputation of
reliable craftsman is well deserved, since he always
succeeds in turning his mega-budgets into pleasant viewing
experiences. In case of LETHAL WEAPON, big budget became
evident in a series of elaborate and spectacular action
scenes (stuntman died during filming one of them). But the
spectacle comes second to the well-created atmosphere of the
film and Donner's clever use of sharp contrasts - Murtaugh's
suburban idyll vs. Riggs' living in cheap trailer, glamorous
lifestyle vs. corruption and depravity. But the sharpest
contrast is provided by combined forces of Eric Clapton and
Michael Kamen whose musical score confronts spirit of
Christmas with atmosphere filled with loneliness, tragedy
and death.</P>
<P>Actually, action scenes, no matter how spectacular they are,
come second to the atmosphere of the film. But the most
memorable things about LETHAL WEAPON are its two leading
characters. What differentiates remarkable action films from
simple action films are the protagonists we care for, and
Shane Black did wonderful job in providing that by writing
Murtaugh and Riggs. Actors playing them did even more
remarkable job. Danny Glover is simply excellent as
policeman who embodies American middle-class ideals -
successful career, material wealth, loving family - and his
insistence on police procedure and reluctance to shoot first
and ask questions later - qualities usually associated with
hero's monkey-wrenching superior in average police movies -
become quite understandable. But Murtaugh hides skeletons in
his closet - his painful and (presumably violent) Vietnam
past is well hidden from his family, and when his family
becomes endangered Murtaugh gets as irrational as Riggs. Mel
Gibson, on the other hand, embraced Riggs as opportunity to
play character very different from the one that made him
famous in MAD MAX series. Unlike the deadly but cool Road
Warrior, Riggs is initially presented as "damaged goods" and
he stays that way until the last shot. We are glad that the
person with such skills is employed on the side of Good, but
few of us would like to be in his company. The scenes that
feature Riggs' outbursts have intensity rarely matched in
the history of cinema. Both Glover and Gibson employ a lot
of talent in order to slowly build tolerance and later the
bond between those two almost irreconcilable personalities.
All other actors were shadowed by such great performances,
although some, like Traci Wolfe as Murtaugh's daughter with
teenage crush on Riggs, underlines humanity of lead
characters.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the film loses its momentum in the second
half, when character exposition gives way for action and all
cliches associated with it. In many ways, those actions
scenes, although well-done, are implausible (Murtaugh and
Riggs, no matter how insane they are, would hardly go after
whole army of vicious killers without back-up) or even
predictable (dreadful final showdown between Riggs and chief
assassin played by Gary Busey). Some critics would frown
upon the such first class characters being used in third
grade plot that deals with government agents going bad and
using covert ops for selfish and nefarious purposes -
something that became action movie cliche by itself in late
1980s. Such plots, inspired by Iran-Contra scandal and all
conspiracy theories that followed it, could, unfortunately,
be inspired by some world conflicts that are actual today
and where the line between political intrigue, military
operation and organised crime is always blurred (as the
career of recently deceased Serb paramilitary leader Arkan
clearly shows).</P>
<P>Despite being associated with uninspired sequels and cliched
one-liner about old age and certain bodily function
(actually borrowed by Friedkin's TO LIVE AND DIE IN L.A.
shot two years earlier), LETHAL WEAPON remains one of those
rare 1980s action films that passed the test of time.</P>
