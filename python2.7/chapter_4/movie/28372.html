<PRE>Tame "Animal"</PRE>
<P>"The Animal" is a marginally inspired comedy that only
manages to lumber along, generating just enough
momentum to keep it from stalling.  It's clunky and
slow, like watching an 18-wheeler trying to accelerate
up a hill.  There are certainly better things you can
do with your time.</P>
<P>Actually, if you've seen the trailer, then you already
know the plot and have seen its funniest moments.  The
story centers on bland Marvin (Rob Schneider), who is
an Evidence Clerk at the local police department that
yearns to be a real officer.  But he's afflicted with
Loser-itis.   Dogs attack him, neighbors torment him,
children bully him, and his co-workers ignore him. 
Truthfully, with his bad haircut (seemingly modeled
after Weird Al Yankovic, Little Richard, and giant
poodles) and his unenthusiastic demeanor, we'd
probably throw tomatoes at him just for fun.  This is
actually bad because you can't like a character if you
can't develop sympathy for him.  We never do, and it
may be just as well that he drives off a cliff and
plummets to the canyon floor.</P>
<P>However, Marvin is found by an eccentric doctor
(Michael Caton) who uses a radical and experimental
procedure to save him, implanting our doofus with
various animal parts and organs.  As a result, Marvin
develops heightened senses and increased agility and
speed.  He can smell drugs hidden anywhere on a body,
swim with the speed of a dolphin, and can run as fast
as a cheetah.  Imagine the comedic possibilities that
arise from this operation.  With his enhanced
abilities, he could now reap vengeance on all those
who have shunned him.  </P>
<P>However, the spirit of the film takes a raunchy turn,
and instead, Marvin spends most of his time trying to
subdue or satiate his voracious appetite and his
animalistic, sexual urges.  Goats beware!   He also
chases cats, urinates to mark his territory, or growls
at his enemies.  What he should've done was stick his
head in the sand like an ostrich.  </P>
<P>Equally tenuous is its other running joke, which
involves one of his friends (Guy Torry) who constantly
complains that everyone is treating him TOO nicely
because he's black.  "It's reverse racism," he
declares as he blows smoke into the faces of strangers
but none of them says anything.  This element doesn't
work the first time it's mentioned, and it becomes
increasingly trite with every recurrence.</P>
<P>You don't have to be as wise as an owl to realize that
"The Animal" is tame.  If there's any reason to see
this film, it's to see Colleen Haskell who makes her
big screen debut.  Remember her?  She was voted off in
week 11 of the 13-week program, "Survivor."  Here, she
plays Marvin's sunny love interest.  While her role
required very little actual acting, she seemed very
comfortable (even when Marvin licks the side of her
face like a lapping dog...yuck!).  With her adorable
disposition, radiant smile, and playful innocence, she
could be a Meg Ryan in the making.  It's too bad that
she's in such a mediocre offering</P>
