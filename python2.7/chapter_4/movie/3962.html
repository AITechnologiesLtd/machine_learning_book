<PRE>                TO WONG FOO, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING, JULIE NEWMAR
                        A film review by Christopher Null
                         Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     "Quirky" doesn't begin to describe the new, long-awaited film TO WONG
FOO, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING, JULIE NEWMAR.  If you've seen any of the
promos for the movie, you probably know the premise:  three drag queens
(Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes, and John Leguizamo) start a cross-country
trek to Hollywood, carting with them their wardrobes and an autographed
picture with the title inscription.  Hardly out of New York, their car
breaks down in middle-of-nowhere Snydersville.  Here, the "ladies" give
the town a makeover, bringing it not only fashion sense, but respect for
women, racial harmony, and an end to spouse abuse.  A drag queen can do a
lot when she puts her mind to it.</P>
<P>     The three are as different as drag queens can be.  Vida (Swayze)
sweeps around like a Southern debutante, while Noxeema (Snipes) acts more
like a pro wrestler.  Chi Chi (Leguizamo) is the Charo-type of the bunch,
a drag queen-in-training who never realizes when she's laying it on too
thick.  Of the three, Leguizamo is the one to watch.  It's almost
frightening how well he lands his role, while Swayze and Snipes are more
like guys acting like guys in drag.  The supporting cast is uninspiring,
but watching for the numerous cameos is fun.</P>
<P>     Most of the time, the film is so totally unconventional that it's
riotously funny, but the one-joke premise wears a little thin and often
becomes as silly as a Jim Carrey vehicle.  And although it borrows heavily
from last year's PRISCILLA:  QUEEN OF THE DESERT, TO WONG FOO is still
quite a bit different and takes cross-dressing into realms I never knew
existed.</P>
<P>     When it's all said and done, TO WONG FOO tries to make some wholesome
social statements, but they seem out of place.  The film is a fun time,
and that's about all that should be expected.  It faces a dilemma just
like the one the trio faces when choosing a vehicle to purchase:  should
they go with "style" or "substance."  The choice seems obvious.</P>
