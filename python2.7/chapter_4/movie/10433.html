<P>     Equal parts fantasy, satire, and pathos, MA VIE EN ROSE 
investigates the role of sexual stereotypes in today's culture, and 
shows how the more conservative elements of society encourage conformity 
and stifle diversity.  In terms of both its style and story, this is one 
of 1997's few unique motion pictures; it's understandable why it has 
captured a landslide of film festival awards.</P>
<P>     Tomboys are a common phenomenon.  There is no social stigma 
attached to a young girl who dresses like a boy, plays rough, wears 
Band-Aids on her skinned knees like badges of honor, and prefers trading 
baseball cards to jumping rope.  It's regarded as "just part of growing 
up."  Reverse the situation, however.  The result -- a boy who adopts 
the traits of a girl -- is unacceptable.  Such a child, who plays with 
dolls, puts on makeup, and wears dresses, is likely to become a pariah.  
And that is the situation explored by Alain Berliner's debut feature, MA 
VIE EN ROSE.</P>
<P>     Pierre (Jean-Philippe Ecoffey) and Hanna (Michele Laroque), along 
with their four children, have just moved into a nice house in a 
suburban Paris neighborhood.  Three of the kids are normal and well-
adjusted, but the fourth, Ludovic (Georges Du Fresne), a seven year old 
boy, is showing "alarming" tendencies.  His favorite toys are Barbie-
like dolls, he expresses a desire to marry a male classmate when he 
"grows up and becomes a girl," and he shows up at a party dressed like a 
pink princess.  His mother, convinced that this is a harmless phase, 
tries to be as supportive as possible, but, when pressure from 
unsympathetic and close-minded neighbors mounts, she begins to turn on 
Ludovic.  Meanwhile, Pierre doesn't know how best to cope with his son's 
tendencies, and Ludovic's sometimes-embarrassing displays of femininity 
threaten to derail his career.</P>
<P>     Ludovic can't understand what the fuss is about.  After all, 
everything seems clear to him.  When God was giving out chromosomes, his 
second "X" (of the "XX" pair that signifies a female) was lost in the 
trash and he somehow got stuck with a "Y" instead (for the male "XY" 
pair).  As a result, he's a "girlboy," but, when he grows up, he's 
convinced that he'll be a woman.  So why shouldn't he wear makeup and 
dresses, and play with dolls?  And why is it wrong if he arranges a mock 
marriage with a boy in his class?  When his parents and his schoolmates 
react angrily, he doesn't understand their surprise, discomfort, and 
rage.  He just wants to do what feels right, yet everyone hates him for 
it.  Those who assume that he's gay have missed the point entirely -- 
sexuality isn't even an issue, at least not at this young age.  MA VIE 
EN ROSE isn't concerned with Ludovic's eventual sexual orientation.</P>
<P>     One of Berliner's successes is his ability to effectively realize 
multiple viewpoints.  While MA VIE EN ROSE gets into Ludovic's head and 
convincingly presents his confusion regarding the adults' negative 
reactions to his behavior, it also conveys the sense of near-panic that 
grips his parents.  They love their son, but don't know how to (or 
whether they should) break him of his feminine obsession.  The resulting 
stress tears at the fabric of their marriage, and their disapproval 
threatens to destroy Ludovic.</P>
<P>     Another standout aspect of the movie is its strong, vivid use of 
colors.  Nearly every hue of the spectrum is represented in pastels and 
fluorescents.  There are red outfits, yellow cars, green bushes and 
grass, pink garage doors, red shutters, purple shirts, orange dresses, 
and so on…  Color is an important element of MA VIE EN ROSE, and its use 
in both the strange reality of Ludovic's world and the surreal 
fantasyland to which he occasionally escapes is a testimony to Tim 
Burton's influence on Berliner.  In the end, it's apparent that the 
intense colors of Ludovic's neighborhood do little to lighten the 
darkness that lurks in the hearts of many of the residents.  To further 
emphasize their lack of human compassion, Berliner paints many of 
Ludovic's neighbors as caricatures, and occasionally has some fun at 
their expense.</P>
<P>     Although the most memorable element of MA VIE EN ROSE is the 
forceful visual style, the director proves himself to be an apt student 
of human nature.  The film works because we understand the central 
characters and their tribulations.  When Ludovic is teased and 
tormented, it's easy to remember how much unthinking cruelty there is in 
this world, whether the setting is Paris or next door.  But, when all is 
said and done, MA VIE EN ROSE is more of a fantasy than a straight 
drama, and Berliner's lighthearted touch keeps the film buoyant when it 
could easily turn grim.</P>
