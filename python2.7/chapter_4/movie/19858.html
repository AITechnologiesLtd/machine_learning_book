<P>_The_Thomas_Crown_Affair_ (R) *** (out of ****)</P>
<P>The original version of _The_Thomas_Crown_Affair_, released in 1968, is
an ideal project to be remade.  The sleek Norman Jewison-directed, Steve
McQueen-Faye Dunaway-starring caper is an entertaining film, but
certainly not a great one, leaving a sizable margin for improvement.  The
1999 version, directed by John McTiernan and starring Pierce Brosnan and
Rene Russo, isn't that much better a film than its predecessor, for its
inspired updates simply make it an enjoyable romantic romp in its own
right.</P>
<P>The most dramatic alteration is the central act of theft pulled off by
bored billionaire Thomas Crown (Brosnan) is an art heist, not a bank
robbery, and the film is better for it.  An art museum proves to be a
vastly more interesting setting than a bank, leaving a lot more room for
creativity in the caper scene.  (Jewison obviously strained to keep
things visually interesting in his film, employing a busy split-screen
technique that appears terribly dated through contemporary eyes.)  After
pulling off a clever and oh-so-slick scheme, Thomas comes away from the
museum with a Monet valued at $100 million--and with chic insurance
investigator Catherine Banning (Russo) hot on his tail.</P>
<P>And when I say "hot," I mean hot: Catherine may indeed be interested in
recovering that painting, but she's much more interested in Thomas
himself, whose suave, carefree ways arouse--and, in many ways,
mirror--her.  The dangerous affair they eventually fall into makes for
the heart of both this and the 1968 film, and it is in this area that the
newer film makes a stronger case.  Despite the palpable electricity
between McQueen and Dunaway, the original's romance felt rushed and
therefore somewhat forced; here, screenwriter Leslie Dixon (who shares
screenplay credit with Kurt Wimmer, who, in a unique arrangement, handled
only the action scenes) fleshes out the love story, showing how their
basic desire develops into real affection.</P>
<P>That said, the updated romance _does_ have more than its share of
sizzle--and how could it not when it pairs two of the most attractive
magnetic stars (and both north of 40, no less) in film today?  Brosnan's
presence may seem cool to the point of freezing for some, but that's the
key to his allure--his debonair detachment, which is a strong fit for
Thomas.  The stunning Russo, however, is all fire.  A veteran of
adventure films, Russo has finally found a role that enables her to blend
her popular brand of vulnerable machisma with a strong dose of natural
feminine wiles, and she obviously relishes the chance to vamp it up.</P>
<P>This is no clearer than in the centerpiece seduction scene, where Thomas
and Catherine's attraction erupts to a boil during a torrid dance.  (In a
nice touch, the song they dance to is an uptempo rendition of the
original film's Oscar-winning theme song, "The Windmills of Your
Mind"--which also recurs as the couple's instrumental love theme.)  The
scene smolders--and how could it not, especially with Russo shimmying in
a slinky see-through dress?--but it doesn't hold a candle to its classic
counterpart in the original film, where Thomas and Catherine engage in
the steamiest chess game ever committed to film.  While the new scene is
all about sex--and how--what's missing is the added dimension of
intellectual seduction that took place as the two ever-so-erotically
matched wits on the chess board.</P>
<P>McTiernan, of course, has made his name as a crack action director
(anyone _not_ remember _Die_Hard_?), so naturally this remake features a
more elaborate action climax.  What is surprising, though, is that the
complexity comes not in the amount of pyrotechnics--there aren't any--but
in the imagination and smarts behind it.  I won't give anything away, but
the clever machinations are more exciting than any big explosion could
ever be.</P>
<P>_The_Thomas_Crown_Affair_ may be a bit too laid-back and older-skewing
to be a blockbuster hit, but it gives the summer something it has been
sorely lacking: a strong sense of class, which is more than welcome in
this season of crass.</P>
