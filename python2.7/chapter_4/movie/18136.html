BOB LE FLAMBEUR (BOB THE GAMBLER) (director: Jean-Pierre Melville; cast:
Roger Duchesne (Bob, The Gambler), Isabelle Corey (Anne), Guy Decomble
(The Inspector) , Daniel Cauchy (Paolo), Claude Cerval (Jean), Simone
Paris (Yvonne), Howard Vernon (McKimmie), 1955-Fr.)</P>
<P>A wonderful noir-type of film, that is actually more about style and
ambiance than it is about what usually underlines the dark themes of the
ticklish noir film subjects, that delve into the underbelly of their
protagonist and evoke a certain sense of injustice in the world. All
that is superfluous to BOB THE GAMBLER; in this film, he is more
interested in taking care of his trenchcoat and fedora and giving
hand-outs to those he likes, than he is in doing anything else but
looking good. This is a story about a compulsive gambler (Roger) who
lives well in Paris without working, living by his own code of ethics
and ability to live off his gambling. Impulsively, one day, when he runs
into a bad losing streak, he decides to get a crew together to rob the
Deauville Casino, a place where he believes there is 800 million francs
in the vault, but is an almost impossible job to do. With a recklessly
cool non-chalance, our hero gathers his crew together despite all the
obstacles in front of him: including betrayal in his ranks and the fact
that his police friend knows that he is going to commit the crime.</P>
<P>The film is so beautifully filmed, reflecting the lighthearted charm and
wit of the main character and the sleaziness of the part of the city he
loves, as the camera kindly follows him as he makes his rounds at night
until he is finished playing craps and cards, driving down the sordid
streets of Montmartre, entering the low-life parts of the Pigalle
section, watching out in a protective way for a young, attractive
16-year-old (Corey), who he sees eating french fries and then getting
picked-up by a sailor on a motorbike. She, as the femme fatale in this
film, will prove to be too willing to sleep with anyone to forge ahead,
but this does not deter Bob from liking her and treating her with
respect, as Bob slowly drives by in his sleek Caddy convertible, taking
notice of the street as if he were the one responsible for its vivacity
and sanity; thusly, finding her again in his favorite bar, this time
talking to a pimp he can't stand. So Bob gives her a decent meal and
some cash, and the key to his room, but does not take advantage of her,
instead, makes it easy for his young protege (Daniel) to move in on her.</P>
<P>This is so much a movie about how the young and old can be screw-ups but
are still okay with themselves, seemingly daring life to keep them from
what they want to be. The now middle-aged Bob in his younger days got
caught robbing a bank and spent time in jail for it. He claims to be
living a crime free life for the past twenty years, enjoying his flashy
lifestyle, acting as freely as he can, not looking back at things that
went wrong. By the film's end we are convinced that we know a lot about
Bob, and come to the conclusion that he's a pretty good guy, thinking to
ourselves, even though he is linked to gambling and crime, nevertheless,
he does possess a wonderful character about him, something that is
worthy of our praise.</P>
<P>A great film, that is shot with perfection, capturing the nuances and
finesse a master film-maker brings to his work, while shooting a
low-budget b/w film, that tells a simple story, but is done with such
effervescence, as to make us feel so much the better that we at least
met this perfectly flawed character, even if it is only on film, since,
for most of us, it is more than likely we will not have the chance to
meet the likes of a true character like him in person.</P>
