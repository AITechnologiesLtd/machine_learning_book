<PRE>Patch Adams (1998, PG-13)</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Tom Shadyac</PRE>
<PRE>Written by Steve Oedekerek</PRE>
<P>Starring Robin Williams, Monica Potter, Daniel London, Philip Seymour
Hoffman, and Bob Gunton</P>
<P>As Reviewed by James Brundage (MovieKritic2000)</P>
<P> My main gripe with Mickey Blue Eyes was that it was using a new formula.
Similarly, my main gripe with Patch Adams is that it is using an old
formula.  In fact, Patch Adams is using the old formula that annoys me most:
the schlock based-on-a-true-story drama.</P>
<P> As a collective group, when we see the line "Based on a True Story", this
is supposed to open the valves of our tear ducts.  This is supposed to make
the story believable, the characters likeable, even if it actually isn't and
they aren't.  We're supposed to give a damn when people in the movie die.
We're supposed to hate to see them go.  We're supposed to have a triumphant
ending with some moral or another.</P>
<PRE> What a crock.</PRE>
<P> Whenever I see the line "Based on a True Story" in front of a movie, I want
to cringe.  Whenever I reach the highly pretentious ending which is often
only missing an usher with a collection plate, I want to puke.  Whenever the
movie inevitably takes a turn for the worse, I get really sick and tired.</P>
<P> The problem with "Based on a True Story" versus "A True Story"
(documentaries) is that whenever "Based on a True Story" exists, there
become conflicts.  We all know that the events displayed in the movie are
complete fictional representations of events that weren't that interesting
to begin with, and thus are completely blown out of a proportion.  Whenever
we enter the movie theatre we expect to have this "resounding human
sympathy."</P>
<P> When was the last time anyone you know had "resounding human sympathy".
This is the 90s, the Age de la Nihilist, and someone should clue studio
executives in that nine out of ten of us don't really care unless you make
us care.  We see the news and only put up with the first ten minutes because
a) it's mildly entertaining, b) we want a stock quote or the whether or
something that comes later.  I show my true cynicism when I say that I
honestly believe that most people are apathetic, myself included, and will
not care about a movie just because it says "Based on a True Story" in front
of it.</P>
<P> If a movie is done well, if it draws me in and actually makes me care some
way or another about the characters then I will actually have some sympathy,
but I really don't much care about fictional representations of real people
I never met.</P>
<P> Furthermore, I doubt I would care about Hunter "Patch" Adams were I to meet
him.  I have a sense of humor, and my sense of humor is juvenile… I'll admit
that.  But I do not go to a meat-packing convention and make a speech that
begins "friends, cow men, bullshippers, lend me your steers."  It's just not
funny.  Although I laud what the man did for modern health care, we still
have a long way to go and his casual disregard of authority is the same
behavior that most people call me a jerk for.</P>
<P> I make a call to studio heads: stop using "Based on a True Story" as a
marketing ploy to conceal a bad movie.  Yeah, we have the occasional
"Schindler's List" and "Alive" which can bring you in to a true story, but
those were strong movies.  When you have a weak movie, don't tack on "Based
on a True Story" and expect a result.  It's an insult to our intelligence
and its playing off of the guilt we feel when we should care but don't.<HR>MovieKritic2000: Reviews for the Generation of a New Millenium
