<P>     Safe Sex takes on a new meaning.  Whether you call its instinct
basic or base, the movie tells you to beware.  Warning: don't get tied
to a bed while engaging into furiously panting sex, unless the other
party has supplied you with a Certificate of Sanity.  Warning: don't
get obsessively involved with carnal knowledge of murder suspects.
Warning:  The Ice Pick Cometh.  Caution: cops, do not sleuth in empty
buildings without your buddy.  Watch out: for alumni of the Berkeley
class of 1983.  Caveat to foreign car makers: your costly racing
machines may be nimble but Detroit can give them a run for their
money.</P>
<P>     The plot of BASIC INSTINCT has more bare flesh than bare
bones.  In a nutshell ("nut" as in "crazy", "shell" as in "shell
game"), it opens with a strokes-to-strikes scene: in his palatial
home, a retired rock star reaches a copulatory climax while his shapely
blond (but not otherwise identified) partner dispatches him with
multiple thrusts of an ice pick.</P>
<P>     Troubled San Francisco cop Michael Douglas suspects Sharon Stone,
an heiress (110 million dollars) who owns spectacular houses, is
bisexual and writes books about killings that later materialize in real
life.  Stone defies, mocks and taunts Douglas and the authorities.
Douglas lusts after her but will not stop investigating.  Both in
computer searches or in bed he leaves no Stone unturned.  He also lusts
after his ex-girl, police shrink Jeanne Tripplehorn.  Douglas has
frantic sex with both women, but separately.</P>
<P>     As a detection thriller the movie is a game of planting red
herrings and false leads and, possibly of implants.  Stone's blend of
mind-games and sex-games is not beguiling but it is intriguingly kinky,
with her provocations, her dialectics, her much-publicized and barely
visible flash of pantylessness, her fencing with Douglas, her flaunting
of live-in lover Leilani Sarelle, her disregard of traditional ways
and niceties.  Her psychological and physiological motivations are not
especially crystalline.  Tentatively, they seem to me less a result of
overcharged sexuality than of boredom and perversity caused by having
too much money.</P>
<P>"Basic Instinct" has several striking (in every way) scenes, top-notch
sets and photography, a menacing score, canny face and body makeup,
sexily tight clothes, nastily tight performances and direction.  Its
basic weakness however is the script structure.  It overdoes its
misanthropy (unexplained) and its trickiness (gratuitous) when it 
carries the characters' cat-and-mouse games into the audience.</P>
<P>     The public may be primarily paying for titillation, but that's no
a reason for neglecting the thriller elements, those that draw the line
between BASIC INSTINCT as soft porn and BASIC INSTINCT as an erotic
police cliff-hanger.  Yet the sleuthing and suspense parts are made
incoherent as the game-playing tactics reach levels of convolution
where you stop following, or caring, or both.  What you're left with is
subjecting yourself to manipulation for the doubtful bonus of shock
effects.</P>
<P>     As the film makes less and less sense it hides its conceptual
murkiness behind glitter.  Anything goes.  Plot and characters keep
shifting, not simply fooling expectations but actually cheating us,
notably in the concluding, arbitrary twist--a final shot that's also a
cheap shot.</P>
<P>     For the thousandth time since Alfred Hitchcock left us, his
lessons of holy simplicity, relative logic and clean narrative lines
that build up suspense, have been ignored.</P>
<P>     Thanks to its production values, BASIC INSTINCT does keep going at
an un-boring clip, but in basically unexciting ways.  Its unleashed sex
makes voyeurs of the viewers, yet its sizzle is soulless and its
studied lack of feeling, a liability.</P>
<P>     The police action entails much suspension of disbelief, a term
that, ironically, Stone herself explains to George Dzundza, Douglas's
partner and only friend.  The script relies heavily on very familiar
cliche's and set-pieces: the buddy who almost always gets his; car
chases (inventive but wildly improbable); political interference from
above (remember Dirty Harry's problems?); unbelievable internal police
conflicts and enmities.  The bigger-than-life syndrome extends from
performances, behavior, events and situations, down to the needless
loudness of the Douglas-Dzundza exchanges.  It's like volume replacing
melody in music.</P>
<P>     No real concern is created for anti-hero Douglas or anyone else.
The dialogue (in case any lookers are listening) is simplistic yet
ponderous.  A pity, because the casting is good.  Douglas's cold,
calculating persona makes him unconvincing in heroic or romantic roles,
but right for films like WALL STREET or BASIC INSTINCT.  Stone and
Tripplehorn are handsome, not too young, and--in a good match with
Douglas--like people who have been repeatedly around the block,
high-mileage but beautifully maintained.  Call them pre-owned.  Yet
while the women's faces are good to look at, the barrage of  Douglas
close-ups should please mostly his mother and father.</P>
<P>     In a filmic conceit, 67-year old Dorothy Malone, the vampish star
of the 1950s, makes brief and bizarre appearances.  Her lovely smile
might remind film-buffs of the young Dorothy in "Tarnished Angels, "
which is just what she represents here.</P>
<P>     Having started with warnings, I end with another warning.  The R
rating is a mild compromise reached after repeated modifications and
submissions, to avoid the commercially undesirable NC-17.  But it is
still a hard R, quite close to a NC-17.</P>
<P>     Addendum: The notorious missing seconds were reinstated at the
Cannes Film Festival.  As many people had already seen the film,
someone suggested that it might save time if the deleted naughty bits
were to have special showings by themselves.  This did not come to
pass.  The European release, however, was uncut.</P>
