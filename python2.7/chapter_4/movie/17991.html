<P>     Film stories of improbable obsession are always tricky because
they're so...well, so improbable.  In a novel, it's easier to delve into
tangled psychology through interior monologue or prose -- to understand,
for instance, why a middle-aged man destroys his life for a teenager
called Lolita.  There is also the secondary problem of giving a face to
the object of desire, creating the possibility that the obsession just
won't make any sense.  A film about irrational passions has to immerse a
viewer in that irrationality, even as it gives you some small sense that
the irrationality is based on something understandable.</P>
<P>     Benoit Jacqot's THE SCHOOL OF FLESH (L'ECOLE DE LA CHAIR) struggles
in both respects.  It's the story of Dominique (Isabelle Huppert), an
unmarried Paris fashion executive at a point in her life when her career
is the focus of her life.  That changes one night when she spies a
bartender named Quentin (Vincent Martinez) at a local nightspot, and
becomes fascinated with him.  Though Quentin's transvestite co-worker 
Chris (Vincent Lindon) warns Dominique that Quentin is a hustler --
indiscriminate of gender -- Dominique still invites him to dinner, and
eventually to bed.  Soon Dominique has made Quentin a "kept man," sharing
her apartment and money with him even though he continues to lead his
previous life.  Their relationship twists and turns into something neither
one can quite identify, though both need it desperately.</P>
<P>     Exactly why they need it is not entirely clear.  The script, based on
a novel by Japanese author Yukio Mishima (THE SAILOR WHO FELL FROM GRACE
WITH THE SEA), does a decent job of painting Quentin as a troubled man who
uses his body for his personal gain, then shows disdain for anyone who
wants him for that body.  Dominique is a more perplexing case.  Isabelle
Huppert effectively conveys a confident woman slowly becoming a paranoid
mess, following Quentin on his rounds through the city.  Jacquot's
direction, however, keeps us too distanced from Dominique's obsession for
it to make sense as anything more profound than a middle-aged fling.
Though the narrative toys with the provocative notion that the childless 
Dominique is acting out a maternal fantasy as much as a sexual one, the
script is too timid to attack that subtext.  THE SCHOOL OF FLESH's
academic detachment makes it difficult to feel her pain, whatever it might
be.</P>
<P>     It's even more difficult to understand why Vincent Martinez is the
man who turns her world upside down.  THE SCHOOL OF FLESH is not the first
film to assert an unlikely man's attractiveness to women -- the entire
Woody Allen oeuvre comes to mind -- but that doesn't make it any easier to
accept this particular example.  Though Martinez certainly isn't ugly,
it's unlikely he'd be anyone's paradigm of masculine beauty; he most
closely resembles a slightly more swarthy Joaquin Phoenix.  Still,
everyone in the film is smitten with Quentin:  Dominique, Chris, a
distinguised attorney (Francois Berleand), an impressionable teenage girl
(Roxane Mesquida).  Quentin's animal magnetism is central to THE SCHOOL OF
FLESH's premise, yet I didn't notice enough magnetism to erase a computer
disk.</P>
<P>     THE SCHOOL OF FLESH still manages to be somewhat engaging, simply
because the relationship dynamics are effectively portrayed.  It's rather
touching watching Quentin try to make Dominique admit she'd discard him if
he were ugly; it's amusing watching Dominique struggle to balance her
desire for Quentin with her embarrassment to be with him in public
settings.  Both central characters are intriguing enough to follow, but
it's hard to watch them both degrade themselves when it's not clear enough
why they're doing it.  Obsession makes for great drama if the "why" is as
important as the "what."  THE SCHOOL OF FLESH leaves you wondering "why,"
as well as "why him."</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 flesh dances:  6.</PRE>
