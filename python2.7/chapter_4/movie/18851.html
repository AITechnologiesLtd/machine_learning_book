<P>What kind of movie combines a preposterous premise with improbable
casting, confusing character treatment and an overdose of gloppy
sentimentality? In the case of "Never Been Kissed," a thoroughly
charming one. It's rare when a film coasts on pure star power alone, but
this lightweight if extremely pleasant romantic fantasy is downright
unthinkable without the talents of totally game lead Drew Barrymore. Her
perfectly sunny performance elevates what could have been grade-C
schmaltz into quite the springtime charmer. Only gruff cranks will leave
the theatre unsatisfied - at least with Barrymore.</P>
<P>She plays Josie Gellar, an ambitious, mid-20s copy editor at "The
Chicago Sun-Times" who suffers from the titular lack of passion in her
too-rigid life, let alone a nerdy facade, stuffy wardrobe and
unflattering hair-don't that keeps Barrymore's spunky sexuality
successfully under wraps. Fate tosses her a second chance when her
grumpy superior (Garry Marshall) orders her to enroll undercover at the
local high school to get the scoop - any scoop. Exactly how this is done
is never revealed, and it would be a major enjoyment roadblock had
"Never Been Kissed" already made us so eager to watch Barrymore's ugly
duckling become a swan.</P>
<P>Flashbacks confirm Josie's past nightmarish educational experience -
where she was dubbed "Josie Grossie" by cruel classmates and made the
victim of a vicious prank - and here she is out of her element again,
trying her darndest to make friends with the in-crowd. They, of course,
reject Josie at first, only to later embrace her following some story
twists best described as unlikely. But so what if practically nothing in
this movie rings true? Barrymore, in a role that definitely goes against
type (come on, who _wouldn't_ want to be her buddy - or more?), performs
with such conviction that even the biggest leaps in logic are pretty
irrelevant.</P>
<P>Also ultimately mattering little by the time "Never Been Kissed" arrives
at its grandly melodramatic - yet wholly satisfying - ending are the
occasionally iffy relationships Barrymore has with some of her co-stars.
As a new student, Josie becomes friends with a math clubber (Helen Hunt
lookalike Leelee Sobieski) also spurned by the hip kids, but she
disappears for a long while following an odd bonding sequence that moves
all too quickly from tears to giggles. And when Josie finally clicks
with an ambiguously-written trio of Miss Popularities and one Mr. Cool,
"Kissed" can't decide if it wants to hiss or laugh at them.</P>
<P>Better luck is had with supporting actors David Arquette, as Josie's
underachieving brother, and "Saturday Night Live" ace-pratfaller Molly
Shannon, as an oversexed "Times" co-worker. They exist to prod the story
along (sometimes plausibly, sometimes not), which includes Josie's
potential - and potentially reciprocated - attraction to a handsome,
young English teacher (Michael Vartan). Since she's working under the
guise of a 17-year-old, this subplot sounds full of the Mary Kay
LeTorneau heebie-jeebies, but pulling it off is Barrymore and Vartan's
welcome subtlety in some surprisingly tender scenes that addresses its
implications.</P>
<P>The big prom finale has been seen before in every recent bit of
teen-oriented fare (from "She's All That" to "10 Things I Hate About
You" - take your pick), and "Never Been Kissed" assuredly follows suit.
This time, though, the formula doesn't feel old because of an
interesting literary couples theme - bonus points for Josie's smashing
Renaissance costume and the visual references to Raoul Duke and Dr.
Gonzo references - and a treacly moment-of-truth that actually works.
The related monologue is delivered by Barrymore's Josie, of course, and
her emotional strength make this preachiness, this person and this movie
utterly embraceable.<HR></P>

"Upon hearing word of this outrage, ‘Star Wars' creator George Lucas (in
the throes of developing scripts for the two remaining "Star Wars"
films) quickly removed all references to an upcoming character allegedly
named Stingy MacHaggis, a kilt-wearing alien who was to spend a good
portion of ‘Episode II' drinking, picking fights and playing an alien
musical instrument that strongly resembled a set of bagpipes.  He is to
be replaced by another alien character - a formless, colorless and mute
creature who in no way resembles any culture or individual that ever
existed or ever will exist. -AAlgar on "The Phantom Menace"'s
