A Simple Plan
Reviewed by Matthew Dalton
4 stars (out of 4)
Rated R</PRE>
<PRE> A Simple Plan is not a simple movie.</PRE>
<P> It is a volcanic, unsettling, nerve-torturing picture that is one of the best
films I had the pleasures of watching last year.</P>
<P> Adapted from the novel by Scott B. Smith (he also wrote the screenplay) and
directed by Sam Raimi, Simple Plan plays like a fox.  It stalks, it winds up,
it strikes.</P>
<P> The story is fairly simple: Two brothers (Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton)
stumble apon a downed plane in the woods near their hometown.  The plane is
filled with $4 million in cash.  They, along with Jacob's (Thornton) buddy,
decide to keep it and split it into three ways.  Hank (Paxton) says that he
will keep it until spring, when the snow melts and someone will find the plan.
If there is no word of the missing money,  they'll take their share and move
out of town.</P>
<P> All of this seems quit nice. Sarah (Bridget Fonda), Hank's wife, especially
likes the plan.  This is her chance to get out of the library job she hates
and, possible, lead to other enjoyments.</P>
<P> Hank is uneasy about the plan, especially after the simple plan goes awry.</P>
<P> I will not tell anymore.  You will have to find out what happens to Hank,
Jacob and the rest.  </P>
<P> The film reminded me of Fargo, but, without the Coen brothers' jokes.  A
Simple Plan is dead serious at its subject matter, and all the more effective.</P>
<P> Plan is more effective than Fargo, yet, Fargo achieved such greatness with
its script and acting that I would rank it slightly higher than Plan.</P>
<P> Both are about money and crimes and moral choices.  Yet Plan makes these
choices seem like the biggest in your life.  And they are, for Hank and
company.</P>
<P> A Simple Plan is taut and riveting.  A film so intriguing, I sat, spellbound,
through it twice.</P>
