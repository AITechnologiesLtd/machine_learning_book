<PRE>NURSE BETTY
-----------</PRE>
<P>Betty Sizemore's (Renie Zellweger, "Me, Myself & Irene") nursing dreams
were dashed by her boorish car-salesman husband Del (Aaron Eckhart, "Erin 
Brokovich").  She spends her days waitressing at the local Tip Top
diner and losing herself in 'A Reason to Love,' the hospital set soap
whose lead character, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear, "As Good As It Gets") 
gives Betty a reason to live.  When Betty witnesses two hitmen kill her
husband, she totally loses her grip with reality and travels to LA to
find her true love in "Nurse Betty."</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>We first meet Betty on her birthday, where she impresses out-of-towner
Charlie (Morgan Freeman, "Kiss the Girls") with her ability to pour coffee
without peeling her eyes off her soap.  Her coworkers present her with
a lifesize cardboard cutout of her hero along with a birthday cupcake (which
Del scoffs later).  Her celebratory plans with best friend Sue Ann (Kathleen 
Wilhoite, "Drowning Mona") are first challenged when Del refuses to lend her a 
Le Sabre, insisting she take a Corsica instead (Betty switches the key Del's 
secretary/mistress gives her anyway), then dashed when Sue Ann's unable to get 
a babysitter.</P>
<P>Betty returns home and holes herself up in the den to watch her soap on
video, ignoring Del when he returns to do business with the two men Betty
served earlier, Charlie and Wesley (Chris Rock, "Lethal Weapon IV").  They're
really out to retrieve stolen drugs that Del's gotten himself mixed up in
and Del ends up dead when Wesley overacts and attempts to scalp(!) him.
Betty waltzes out while town Sheriff Ballard (Pruitt Taylor Vince, "Heavy") 
and local reporter Roy (Crispin Glover, downplaying his usual weirdness 
quotient) stand aghast in the crime scene.  Her disappearance raises suspicion 
with Charlie and Wesley, who are ordered to take her out.</P>
<P>Betty journeys from Kansas to LA and secures a job as a nurse and a place to
stay with the thankful Rosa (Tia Texada, "Paulie") after acting quickly during 
a shootout/kidnapping in front of the hospital which had just turned her away.  
Then Rosa gets her into a charity event where actor George McCord is making an 
appearance and Betty's rapturous greeting to her beloved 'ex-fiance, David 
Ravell' impresses him and the show's producer/writer Lyla (Allison Janney, 
"Drop Dead Gorgeous") as improvisational acting.  Betty's in heaven, Rosa's 
perplexed, George and Lyla are revamping their show.  Back home Roy, Ballard 
and Sue Ann are putting the pieces together to track her down, but Charlie and 
Wesley are two steps ahead of them and already heading west.</P>
<P>Zellweger buries memories of her last two unsuccessful flicks to triumph
as a good-hearted, if delusional, small town girl.  Betty's sweetness
personified, but never cloying, and her ability to waft from one dream
to the next is utterly convincing.  Freeman and Rock are an inspired pairing
with the calm, philosophical elder keeping the young firebrand on a short
leash (until his own delusions take the story on yet another twist).
There's a little bit of "Fargo" in these two mismatched hitmen who end up
inside small town weirdness neither of them anticipated.  Kinnear is
well suited to the soap star looking for a new sensation to jack up his
ratings, and plays his soap scenes with satirically grave intensity.
Once again Eckhart amazes with his chameleonic abilities, impressing in
a small role as the loathsome, mullet-haired Del.</P>
<P>First time screenwriters John C. Richards (also 'story by') and James
Flamberg have created a memorably original world whose characters follow
surprising paths.  The compassion and humor in the script makes
it one of the year's best.  Director Neil LaBute has made a wise decision
stepping away from his own nihilistic writing, showcasing his talents
in this far sunnier (albeit still sometimes blackly humorous) space.
He and cinematographer Jean-Yves Escoffier ("Cradle Will Rock") amusingly
begin to block their shots in the 'real' world just like their heroine's
television fantasy.</P>
<P>"Nurse Betty" is a rich film that always has another surprise around the
corner.  If some climatic occurrences don't play quite as neatly as they
should, one can still take immense pleasure from the imaginative filmmaking
here that can bind Betty's character to Charlie's with the star on her
tee shirt.</P>
