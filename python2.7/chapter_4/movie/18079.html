<PRE>"Pushing Tin" -- Flying around in Circles
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>In the crowded skies over New York City, planes fly dangerously close
to one another, but somehow manage to never collide.  In the film,
"Pushing Tin," hotshot air traffic controller Nick (John Cusack) and
new-kid-in-town Russ (Billy Bob Thornton) have an uneasy working
relationship that comes dangerously close to colliding, yet their story
never manages to make an impact.  What throws this film off-course? 
The answer is that the main story between these two could only muster
as much flight as the Spruce Goose.</P>
<P>Nick is the charismatic leader of a tightly knit clique of air traffic
controllers.  These ATCs safely guide in dozens of airplanes every
minute over the busy New York City skies.  Nick, who has a sharp mind,
an acute ability for spatial relationships, and a-mile-a-minute mouth,
easily tames the chaos and congestion overhead.  Looking at a dozen or
so scattered blips on his radar screen, he confidently blurts out
instructions to each of the incoming planes, urging them to change
course or speed.  It's an unenviable juggling act, and if he (or any of
the ATCs) can not perform at their highest level, a mid-air collision
becomes frighteningly likely.  As Nick relays instructions, the
scattered blips begin to take form.  What was just a disorganized bunch
of blips a few minutes ago has been transformed into a cadence of jumbo
jets making their final approach.  This guy definitely knows how to
push tin.</P>
<P>Nick's self-esteem is about to be compromised when Russ, a new ATC,
joins the group. He's an odd and quiet person who dons an Indian
feather.  But, he knows how to maneuver planes in for landings, and
he's really good at it too.  Russ's skill earns the respect of the
other ATCs, while his eccentric demeanor makes him 'interesting' to
Nick's wife (Cate Blanchart, the only bright spot in this film).  Nick
can't seem to handle his insecurity.  He begins a personal quest to
regain superiority, which will ultimately come at the expense of his
honor, integrity, and even his family.  Stories where a likable guy has
to regain his previous greatness after a horrific fall is always nice
feel-good film fodder.  But Russ is too subdued and is in a constant
state of Zen.  He doesn't seem like much of a threat and their rivalry
amounted to nothing more than a staring contest.  Nick's obstacles
didn't seem all that compelling.  Contrast his relative short journey
to the more challenging and ultimately more fulfilling quest of Jerry
Maguire.  Consequently, Cusack's character and his situation could not
draw us into his life-turned-upside down world.  </P>
<P>This mediocre rivalry and Nick's laffable ascension would make any of
us assume crash positions.  But hidden in this generally lifeless film
are some nice 'slice-of-life' elements replete with heavy
'Lon-Guy-Land' accents, confessions, and revelations.  I don't know
many air traffic controllers, but I bet that they lead some interesting
lives.  On a field trip to the control station, a bespectacled egghead
points out that ATCs are the most likely to commit suicide or suffer
from mental breakdowns.   At a picnic, wives identify themselves by
which number wife they are ("I'm his fourth wife"), giving us a glimpse
into the unique lifestyle of the ATC.  I liked these little snippets
and peeks into their lives.  The rest of the movie, however, is just
excess baggage.</P>
