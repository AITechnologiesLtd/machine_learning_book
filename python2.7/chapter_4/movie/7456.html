<PRE>                               2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY
                       A film review by Serdar Yegulalp
                        Copyright 1997 Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>CAPSULE: "Quirky" sums up this neat little movie about a gallery of
disparate characters whose lives collide over the course of 48 hours in Los
Angeles. The proper meaning of "Tarantino-esque".</P>
<P>If you tried to map out the coincidences that took place in your real life,
you'd have material which would strain the plausibility of most
mystery-readers. 2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY contains one insane coincidence after
another, but that's okay, for two reasons. One, it contains a wealth of
intriguing and intelligently-written characters, and two, it's *about*
coincidences as much as it *contains* coincidences. It's "Tarantino-esque"
in the right sense of the word: it extends on the kinds of things Quentin
Tarantino introduced into a movie without becoming redundant or insulting.</P>
<P>Without spoiling anything, let me try to list as many of the people as
possible in this movie, as well as how they start off. We have an estranged
husband and wife, who have two hitmen walk in on them. We have an art dealer
and his secretary, who are later taken hostage at gunpoint by one of the
hitmen -- who really, REALLY hates dogs. We have the other hitman's icy
Nordic girlfriend, who has a way of being able to tell you you're screwed
simply by smiling at you. We have two vice cops who stumble into a murder
scene and get a lot more than they bargained for. We have a washed-up,
suicidal television director and the nurse he meets in a cemetary when he
tries to give her his... yes, his dog. And even *there* I think I've missed
a few.</P>
<P>The movie works by subtly defeating our expectations about what movies
normally do. In one scene, we switch from one conversation to another in
mid-sentence -- without even the rhythm of the shots changing. Slowly the
threads of the movie converge -- in a way that only makes sense at the end,
and even then it's completely off the wall -- but by that time the movie has
declared its territory: it's about characters, not plots.</P>
<P>This movie grows on you. I thought it would be too self-consciously arty for
my taste. It comes on more like a good friend whom you suddenly discover has
a thing for sleight-of-hand and card tricks, and surprises you in more ways
than you might think.</P>
