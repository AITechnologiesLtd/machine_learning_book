AMERICAN HISTORY X
Reviewed by Pierce Dalton
3 stars (out of 4)</PRE>
<P> American History X is one history lesson I enjoyed.</P>
<P> I have never been a big history fan.  Yet X displays its history of skinheads
in a powerful, haunting tale of hate vs. love.</P>
<P> Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) is sent to jail after he kills a black man in
his neighborhood after Derek catches him trying to steal his car in southern
California.</P>
<P> With a tatooed Swatstika on his left peck, Derek is the image of hate,
specifically the hate of different races, color.</P>
<P> But, while in jail, he learns the error of his ways.  Maybe this Derek isn't
the bad-ass he pretends (he thinks) to be. </P>
<P> And, I'm sure it helps when Derek is raped in prison by a bunch of white
inmates he befriended.</P>
<P> The title of the film is the title of a school assignment given to Derek's
little brother, Danny (Edward Furlong).  He must report why it is wrong to say
Hitlar was, well, a good guy, so to speak.</P>
<P> The moral point of X is, or course, that being a racist is wrong.  Yet,
Norton's acting in this movie are very good, his best to date, I think.  His
Derek is an evil, scary man who's morals are a screwed up as Hitlar's.</P>
<P> He makes his psychotic character in Primal Fear (1996) look reasonible.</P>
<P> The rest of the cast, including Beverly D'Angelo and Fairuza Bulk, are, also,
good.</P>
<PRE> But, X is Norton's movie.</PRE>
