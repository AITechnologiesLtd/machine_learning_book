<P>PLOT:
A young French boy sees his parents killed before his eyes by Tim Roth, oops...I
mean, an evil man. He vows revenge on that man and is taught the ways of the
Musketeer by some old dude who used to be one himself? Anyway, fourteen years go
by and...arrgh, well, you know the rest...swish-swish-zzzzzzz! </P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
This is a pretty bad movie. Let's see, where should I start? Okay, first of all,
the story is just plain boring. It's not original, is entirely predictable and
lacks energy. Okay, what's next? Acting, you say. Hmmmm, well, the main actor,
Justin Chambers, is basically an uncharismatic version of Chris O'Donnell but
with less range (think about that!), and Mena Suvari, is just plain off. Not as
bad as Thora Birch was in DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, but entirely miscast, with bad
deliveries, awful sequences and a piss-poor accent that comes and goes. Now I'm
not sure if this was Ms. Suvari's fault or the director's, but I've definitely
seen her at a much higher level than in this film. The only semi-saving grace
actor-wise is Tim Roth as the irrepressible "bad guy", but once again, it's not
something that we haven't seen before...a thousand times...by the same guy!!
Tim, please...for the love of God, beg your agent to ask the marketplace for
some modern day "American roles" for you as a "nice guy" in a romantic comedy or
something. Stretch, dude...stretch!! We all know that you can do much better
than this gunk. Alright, what else was bad in this film? Oh yeah, the score!
Yikes, how's about taking it down a few notches there, fellas? This thing blares
in your ear whenever it feels the need to accentuate a certain scene, but
actually does little more than annoy. I think it's important for the man behind
the music to recognize that this film isn't a "real epic" by any stretch of the
imagination. It's a fluffy rehashed cake-walk created by some "shrewd" studio
heads who decided to take advantage of the whole "kung-fu" phenomenon in films,
and test it out on an old classic. Dudes...you failed all around! (keep
reading)</P>
<P>The editing is also pretty shoddy in this movie, the dialogue banal and stilted
and the plot problems...plentiful! (why does the guy on top of the horse
carriage just stand there when his opponent takes forever scampering his way
back to the top? why don't they just cut the mouseketeer's rope at the top of
the tower, instead of jumping down on their own chords and fighting him while
hanging? why doesn't anybody look a day older, when the sequence says "14 years
later"? (at least...change your shirt, man!) Keep in mind that I have never
strayed away from championing certain movies that are created simply for the
sake of a "fun time", but this flick just didn't cut it for me. It was boring
for stretches, the acting was atrocious at times (the "romantic" scene between
Suvari and Chambers next to the lake reminded me of plays in high school which
made you cringe), there was little reason to care for anyone and since when were
the Musketeers fat?</P>
<P>I will give the movie this much, and that is that its main reason for being (its
"raison-d'etre", as the French would say), its fight sequences, do come through
despite the lack of their numbers in the film. I was hoping that the movie would
be packed with cool stuntwork as promoted in its trailer, but what you see
there, are essentially the snippets from the two major (and cool) swashbuckling
sequences from the film. The first comes right at the beginning of the movie,
while the other essentially finishes the film off, hanging from the tower and
juggling off ladders. The ladder sequence itself is a definite keeper but
unfortunately the rest of the movie is just regurgitated crap. And can anyone
please tell me how Catherine Deneuve got her name placed at the top of this
film's credits? Hullo? The film is called THE MUSKETEER and stars a dude name
Justin Chambers. Deneuve is barely in this movie! Ugh, just another small thing
that annoyed me about this trash.</P>
<P>Now say it together, gang: "All for one, and one for all...we vow to stay away
from it all!!" Thank me later.</P>
