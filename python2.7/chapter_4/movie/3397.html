<PRE>                              DOLORES CLAIBORNE
                       A film review by Christopher Null
                        Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Kathy Bates and Jennifer Jason Leigh have returned in a new Steven
King film, DOLORES CLAIBORNE.  Another departure from typical King
fare, this is a tense psychological drama and character study, akin to
last year's THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION (also based on his work).</P>
<P>     Set on a depressed and perpetually wet island off the coast of
Maine, Dolores Claiborne (Bates) is the focus of the film.  Looming in
her past is a secret:  she may or may not have killed her abusive
husband (played in flashbacks by David Strathairn).  In the present,
Dolores has apparently been driven to madness by her husband and her
employer Vera, the elderly woman for whom Dolores nursemaids.  At the
film's opening, we are presented with what appears to be Vera's death
by Dolores's weathered hands.</P>
<P>     This all sets the tone for the ensuing investigation, in which Max
Von Sydow plays the investigator "thwarted" by Dolores during his
investigation of her husband's death eighteen years earlier.  Selena
(Leigh), Dolores's similarly insane daughter shows up to help out in
the crisis.</P>
<P>     What follows is pretty much predictable.  After a promising start,
the film begins to rely on way-over-the-top acting, culminating in the
worst courtroom scene in years, to get its point across (basically:
abuse is bad).  Clocking in at well over two hours, DOLORES CLAIBORNE
is far too long for the audience to stare at the same dull grey sky and
dead landscapes, while its stars deadpan for the camera.</P>
<P>     Thematically simplistic, DOLORES CLAIBORNE is a mildly interesting
story with some memorable characters.  It's not what we've come to
expect from King, and it is a step in the right direction, away from
the author's customary schlock horror.  But with another King story
playing in theaters now as well (THE MANGLER), it doesn't look like
he's changed his evil ways.</P>
