<P>     In this age of cynicism, it's unusual to find a film like WIDE 
AWAKE.  The movie, brought to the screen by sophomore director M. Night 
Shyamalan, is Capra-esque in its outlook on life and death.  And, while 
the ultimate result is somewhat uneven, there's no denying that WIDE 
AWAKE contains its share of affecting moments, and the production as a 
whole offers enough solid drama and legitimate emotion to earn it a 
recommendation not only for adults, but for older children as well, who 
will relate to the protagonist and narrator.  It's definitely a two 
hankie movie, though.</P>
<P>     This is the second movie in the past year to tackle the subject of 
how a child copes with death.  And, like 1997's PONETTE, WIDE AWAKE 
forces its main character to explore questions of religion and the 
afterlife.  However, while PONETTE used a documentary-like approach to 
depict a young girl's confusion and pain, Shyamalan's movie has a 
different agenda:  presenting these issues within the framework of a 
modern-day fable.  Watching PONETTE was, at times, a grueling 
experience.  The same is not true of WIDE AWAKE, which leavens its 
serious moments with breaks of humor and lighter drama.</P>
<P>     Joseph Cross is ten-year old Joshua Beal, a fifth-grader who 
attends a Catholic school for boys in suburban Philadelphia.  Josh lives 
with his father (Denis Leary), mother (Dana Delany), and sister (Julia 
Stiles), but a key member of the family is absent.  Josh's grandfather 
(Robert Loggia) recently died of bone marrow cancer, and his death has 
hit the young boy hard.  The sudden void causes Josh, an extremely 
intelligent child, to begin questioning many aspects of life, truth, and 
religion.  His quest for answers leads him to begin a year-long search 
for God.</P>
<P>     The most obvious strength of WIDE AWAKE is its appeal.  The film 
creates likable characters who engage the audience, and the storyline 
addresses sensitive, emotionally-compelling issues without becoming 
cloying.  At times, the movie is manipulative, but it's a gentle, rather 
than forced, approach.  I was genuinely moved by the relationship 
between Josh and his grandfather.  The credit for this can be sliced 
into three portions -- one to Shyamalan, who wrote and directed the 
scenes; one to neophyte actor Joseph Cross, who is believable as the 
precocious Josh; and one to Robert Loggia, who is subdued and amiable in 
a part that is, for him, atypical.  WIDE AWAKE contains other solid 
performances as well.  Denis Leary submerges his outrageous personality 
to do a fine job as Josh's "normal" father.  Likewise, Dana Delany 
exudes wholesomeness.  Rosie O'Donnell has a small role as one of Josh's 
teachers -- a nun with a passion for the Philadelphia Phillies baseball 
team.</P>
<P>     Shyamalan has clearly matured since 1992, when he wrote, directed, 
produced, and starred in his debut feature, PRAYING WITH ANGER.  That 
film, about an American-born Indian making his first trip to India, was 
a cliché-riddled, uneven affair that showed flashes of promise.  WIDE 
AWAKE is a smoother, more polished movie with a less porous emotional 
texture, a better-realized story, and more fully-rounded characters.  
This is an example of a young film maker taking a step forward with his 
second film rather than falling victim to the so-called "sophomore 
jinx."</P>
<P>     While it's true that the script for WIDE AWAKE isn't all that 
ambitious, too often relies on the exposition of an overly-verbose 
narrator, and includes a few necessary contrivances, what makes the film 
special are the numerous individual moments that shine.  And, although 
the dialogue is too sophisticated for the way children really talk, it 
is intelligent enough not to leave us shaking our heads in dismay and 
disbelief.  I left WIDE AWAKE feeling the same way I did after seeing a 
number of Frank Capra's movies -- I was aware of the problems, but that 
didn't diminish the warm, fuzzy glow I was experiencing.  </P>
