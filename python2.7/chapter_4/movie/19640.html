<P>         "Runaway Bride" begins with a startling image, that of the
lovely Maggie Carpenter (Julia Roberts) in her wedding gown and on
horseback, racing through the fields of rural Maryland to the tune of
U2's "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For." Right away, we know
we've entered the realm of the screwball comedy where everyone is quirky
and everything is slightly askew. In some ways, "Bride" serves as a
mirror image of another one of Roberts' hits, "My Best Friend's
Wedding": In that film, her character was breaking up another person's
nuptuals, while in this one, Maggie successfully sabotages her own.</P>
<P> It turns out the escape we're seeing marks the third time
Maggie has fled the altar at the last minute, a personality trait that
has made her a legend/laughingstock in her hometown and in her own home.
"You can't imagine how much cake we've gotten stuck with," complains
Maggie's grandmother. "It's a wonder I don't weigh 300 pounds."</P>
<P> Maggie's habit of jilting fiances draws the attention of Ike
Graham (Richard Gere), a columnist for USA Today renowned for writing
what his detractors call "bitter diatribes about women." Without
bothering to verify rumors he's heard about her, Ike conjures up a
libelous attack on Maggie which ends up damaging his reputation instead
of hers. Fired for writing these lies, Ike decides to learn the truth
about Maggie, and "Bride" quickly becomes a sensational example of how
the chemistry between two stars can turn a modest script into great fun.</P>
<P>         When Gere and Roberts were first paired up nine years ago in
"Pretty Woman," the result delighted a whole lot of people, and "Bride"
proves lightning can strike twice. Watching them interact onscreen is
practically intoxicating, since, like all great movie couples, they
truly bring out the best in each other. Roberts' girl-next-door vibrance
humanizes the sometimes staunchy Gere; Gere's savoir faire seems to set
Roberts completely at ease.</P>
<P> Though it takes a enormous leap of faith to get past "Bride"'s
set-up (and to ignore the question of how Maggie manages to continue
snagging beaus given her reputation), the results prove to be worth it.
The screenplay by Sara Parriott and Josann McGibbon manages to map out
an unconventional route to its destination, as well as working in a
valid message about how important it is to know yourself before you
decide to tie the knot. "Bride" also offers a hilarious performance by
Christopher Meloni as Maggie's sports-minded husband-to-perhaps-be and
charming parts for such proven comic talents as Joan Cusack, Laurie
Metcalf and Paul Dooley. The casting throughout the film is flawless.</P>
<P> As Roberts' romances go, "Bride" is not as witty as "Notting
Hill," but it's warmer and more consistent. Nor does it pale next to
"Pretty Woman." The filmmakers were smart enough to realize everyone
would be making comparisons so Parriott and McGibbon have thrown in a
couple of smart nods to famous "Pretty" scenes and director Garry
Marshall continues the joke by recruiting "Pretty" veterans Hector
Elizondo and Larry Miller to fill key supporting roles.</P>
<P> Of course, what ultimately matters here is whether or not the
sparks still fly between the leads. Consider this evidence: When Maggie
and Ike finally succumbed to each other, the preview audience responded
with an almost deafening chorus of screams, sighes and cheers. It was
the sound of 500 or so people simultaneously falling in love all over
again.</P>
<PRE> It's safe to say the old magic is still very much there. James
Sanford</PRE>
