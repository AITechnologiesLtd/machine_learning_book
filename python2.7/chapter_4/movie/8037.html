<P>Face/Off is an action picture in which everyone seems to have "hit
their stride." Furthermore, it shows that an interesting premise can
enliven any movie, even one embedded in such a notoriously
formulaic genre.</P>
<P>Face/Off concerns the fortunes of two arch-nemeses, Castor Troy
(Cage) and Sean Archer (Travolta). Castor Troy is a violent but very
intelligent sociopath who wants to screw the world for what he
imagines it did to him. Archer is an Elliot Ness for the nineties, an
agent of the secretive anti-terrorism squad of the FBI, who wants most
of all to visit upon Castor Troy the pain he suffered when Castor shot
little Michael Archer to death six years earlier. In an all-out slugfest
and shootout in the first act, Archer finally captures Troy, but only
after Troy has planted a chemical/biological bomb somewhere in
downtown Los Angeles. With the clock ticking, Archer must find
some way to turn an apparently Pyrrhic victory into a real triumph. In
desperation, he attempts to save the situation by taking on Castor
Troy's identity, which includes an operation in which both their faces
are removed so that Troy's face can be literally grafted onto Archer's
body!</P>
<P>Although he meets with initial success, Archer's plan goes badly awry.
He is sent to the same prison as Castor's brother Pollux (a throwaway
reference to the Roman/Greek brothers of the same name) and
wheedles the location of the bomb from him. In the meantime,
however, Castor awakens from his coma (induced by his capture in act
I) to find he has no face. He calls in some goons, forces the doctor to
give him Archer's face and then murders everyone who knows about
this super-secret, identity-swapping operation. Troy and Archer have
completely changed places. Describing events from this point on could
become rather tortuous, so suffice it to say that Troy and Archer now
have a unique opportunity to walk a mile in the other's shoes and to
employ a new and unfamiliar set of resources to deal with each other.</P>
<P>The identity-swapping premise works surprisingly well, and at several
levels. First, it cleanly motivates the action of the picture by placing
the two main characters in such direct conflict. After Archer escapes
from prison (in Troy's persona), he wants his old identity back, but
Troy (in Archer's persona) likes being in control of such powerful FBI
resources and so prefers things the way they are. Second, the premise
allows the two men to explore each other's turf. Archer, not
surprisingly, finds the underground world of terrorism and
drug-dealing extremely distasteful, but also strangely compelling. For
his part, Troy finds Archer's workaday life bizarre and comments,
when driving through Archer's neighborhood, "I am in hell." Third,
the not infrequent fistfights constantly present the audience with the
rather disgusting prospect that someone's face will literally fly off
their head!</P>
<P>Fortunately, this premise is seldom overextended and the
presentation of various "dualities" doesn't pretend to a greater
significance than it can sustain. Instead, the basic conflict gives rise
to many well-choreographed action sequences, played out amid a hail of
bullets, pigeons, and religious backdrops. The movie also apparently
includes the boat-chase scene that Woo could not fit into Hard Target.
In fact, Face/Off has much of the look of Hard Target, right down to
the intercutting of slow-motion into the fast-paced scenes, and the
affected intrusion of all those damn pigeons! Also included is a
many-cornered standoff scene adapted from Leone's For a Few
Dollars More, complete with closeups of people's eyes shifting. The
result is a very watchable blend of style and pacing.</P>
<P>Another distinct plus for this film is the acting of the principle
characters, particularly Nicholas Cage. The contrast with the
somewhat bland Cameron Poe of Con Air is quite noticeable. Cage is
as convincing as could be expected for a character caught in such an
outlandish predicament, looking genuinely terrified out of his wits at
the prospect of being locked away as Castor Troy for the rest of his
days. Travolta too puts in a good performance. Playing cool but
psychotic criminals is now old hat for the action flick, and Travolta
certainly can't be accused of not playing to type.</P>
<P>Even with all the high-octane gunfire and chase scenes, Woo has
clearly proceeded thoughtfully. It is a given, of course, that the good
guy will win in the end, but the means of Troy's downfall is kept in
the dark until the late innings and not telegraphed right off the bat.
Naturally, a small detail gives the villain away, but several candidates
are raised in the course of the film and made the subjects of
misdirection. While not rivetingly suspenseful, this sort of attention
to detail is very gratifying. Overall, Face/Off is an interesting and
stylish piece of moviemaking, and definitely sets the mark for action
pictures this summer.</P>
