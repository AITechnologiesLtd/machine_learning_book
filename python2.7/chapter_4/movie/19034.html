<P>Rather than making sharp independent productions with a low budget and high
degree of skill like his 1994 comeback 'Pulp Fiction', John Travolta has
chosen to embrace the big studio system of commercial enterprise and has
only made two great movies since 'Pulp Fiction' and they are 1995's 'Get
Shorty' and 'Primary Colors' in 1998 for which he should have received an
Oscar nomination.</P>
<P>Travolta's latest disappointment is directed by Simon West ('Con Air) 'who
has a dim eye for supporting characters in this film and structures his
movie like a darkly trimmed and photographed structure of shadows that you
would expect to find in a Tony Scott movie.  In fact, you could throw out
many of the supporting players in this flick with big names like James
Woods, James Cromwell and Timothy Hutton and replace them with minimum wage
actors and you couldn't tell the difference.  The only thing that is worse
than this muddled scenario is that the film's two leads (John Travolta and
Madeline Stowe) don't have distinct sides to their personality and rather
than look like investigators getting deep inside a murder case, they look
more like chess players simply going through the moves.</P>
<P>Getting involved in the plot of 'The General's Daughter' is like meeting an
old acquaintance somewhere in public that you weren't very fond of.  You
want to keep the encounter brief, you want to go on your way as soon as
possible and you want to forget about it as soon as possible.  Getting
involved with this film's characters is like attending an open seminar at a
large banquet centre where a business meeting is going on.  You smile
politely at others, you never get to know them and you'll be glad when it's
all over.</P>
<P>With a screenplay by Christopher Bertolini and the masterful William Goldman
(a major bust here), based on the novel by Nelson DeMille, 'The General's
Daughter' attempts to cover familiar ground with a conclusion you won't care
about and you won't want to tell others about it after you've seen the film
with any great anticipation.</P>
<P>Travolta and Stowe play Paul Brenner and Sarah Sunhill.  One is a warrant
officer and the other a rape investigator who look into the matter of a
young female army captain named Elisabeth Campbell (Leslie Stefanson) who
has been murdered.  Throughout the course of the investigation, they uncover
many potential suspects, including the one they think is the most likely to
have committed the crime, Colonel Moore (James Woods).  There is even the
suspicion that the general may have been the one responsible for his
daughter's death with a high agenda for national political office and a
cover-up that will save his chances at getting elected.  It wouldn't make a
difference if I did give away the ending because chances are you won't care
about it.  Remember 1992's 'The Bodyguard' where the assassin was actually a
minor character that was given little or no focus in the film.......ditto
here and that still gives nothing away because there are so many of them in
'The General's Daughter'.</P>
<P>Strangely, I felt that 'The General's Daughter' had a look and feel to it
similar to 1990's 'Presumed Innocent'.  The characters in that film, such as
the prosecutors, the defence attorney and the wife of the accused were
important but underwritten characters.  Here, the same thing happens with
the film's key players and the film has some rather goofy and amateur
dialogue and situations where the characters think they're impressing those
around them with their intelligence when in fact it's really synthetic and
too obvious.</P>
