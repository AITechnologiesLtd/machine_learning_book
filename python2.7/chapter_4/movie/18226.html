<P>"Were the world perfect, it would always be wrong to trespass, but as
the world is not perfect, sometimes one must.  And when you do, you
live, you break free, you fly.  I know this is true, and the reason it
is true, I believe, is that the spark of transgression comes directly
from the heart of God."</P>
<PRE>          -- Mark Helprin, Memoir from Antproof Case</PRE>
<P>Superficially, Election is about a student council election in a small
high school in Omaha, Nebraska.  I say "superficially" because,
really, little can be more superficial than a student council
election.  The biggest ovation (and the biggest laugh) is reserved for
the one character who points out the foolishness of the exercise and
promises to abolish the student government if elected school
president. Much of the comedy is directed at the mounting silliness of
the election and the grotesque awkwardness of the high school
experience, making it easy to pigeonhole Election as a typical MTV
Films coming-of-age movie.  Do not make this mistake.</P>
<P>It would be a little more accurate to call Election a smart, snappy
commentary on our electoral system, which it is.  Election's top
candidate is Pleasantville's Reese Witherspoon, playing consummate
overachiever Tracy Flick.  There's a scene early on that catalogues
Tracy's accomplishments -- student council member, French Club,
yearbook -- that's somewhat reminiscent of a similar scene in
Rushmore.  Both Jason Schwartzman's Max Fischer and Tracy Flick are
involved in a plethora of high school activities as a creepy
substitute for acceptance, but there are important differences.  Tracy
is bright, cheerful, and nauseatingly perky, where Max is confused,
difficult, and hyperactive.  Where Max is seeking to burrow to the
heart of his school. Tracy's activity is directed towards the outside
world.  Bit by bit, we see her slowly building her resume on a path to
leadership and eventual world domination.  Every piece of gum she
gives away, every poster she makes, every cupcake she bribes voters
with is just one more step along her predetermined path.</P>
<P>Of course, with people like this, any deviation from that
predetermined path is a problem.  Very early on, a younger version of
Jeff Spicoli swipes a double handful of Juicy Fruit from Tracy's
hallway election headquarters.  "ONE PIECE PER PERSON!" she yells, as
though the world had ended.  Anything that breaks her composure,
anything that ruins her perfect plan, threatens to send Tracy into a
violent, sobbing (and highly entertaining) rage.</P>
<P>What makes this political satire?  Well, keep in mind that
director/screenwriter Alexander Payne introduces Elizabeth Dole's name
into the discussion.  I'm not making any invidious comparisons here.
Really.  I'm not.</P>
<P>Anyway, one of the many things that disappointed me about
Pleasantville was the way that Reese Witherspoon's character
disappeared midway through.  Here, she's given almost the whole movie
as her personal private playground, and she turns in a sharp, funny
performance that's right on the mark.</P>
<P>But that still isn't what the movie's about.</P>
<P>No, Election is about the divine spark of transgression, the message
of temptation, the occasional powerful impulse to do something wrong.
Mostly, we control that spark and keep our evildoing to a minimum.
Some of us let that spark burn us up, others let it suffocate, but
everyone knows its irresistible power.</P>
<P>It is the spark of transgression that powers Election and raises it
from its unpromising lineage to become a genuinely good film.  That
spark is personified by Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick), three-time
teacher of the year at Carver High and all-around good guy, the sort
who would never... ever...  do anything bad or wrong or evil.</P>
<P>At first, it seemed cruel to me to cast Broderick in this role, and it
is a little sad to see Ferris Bueller teaching government class,
especially with graying temples that look for all the world to be
applied with Liquid Paper.  But the spark of transgression can light
up even the dullest, grayest life.  Broderick sees Witherspoon's
character as a mortal threat.  McAllister fears Tracy on a personal
level (she's already slept with, and ruined the life of, his best
friend) but he also fears the inevitability of her rise to power, or
merely wants to teach her a lesson.  Whatever the reason, McAllister
is sitting in his basement, drinking a Pepsi,
watching... well... let's just say he's watching TV... and the spark
of transgression hits him.  He decides to enlist football hero Paul
Metzler (newcomer Chris Klein) as Tracy's opponent.  And from there,
the sparks start flying, and don't stop until the very last scene.</P>
<P>These are the high points of the movie, and they make Election worth
seeing by themselves.  But such a review leaves out a lot of the
small, good touches that make Election special -- as well as the
annoying little freeze-frame and flashback sequences that make it
imperfect.  If Election were a perfect movie, such criticisms would be
superfluous.  Election is not a perfect movie, but it lives, it breaks
free, and every once in a while it even flies.</P>
