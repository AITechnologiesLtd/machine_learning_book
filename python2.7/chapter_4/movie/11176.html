<PRE>                              THE APOSTLE
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Robert Duvall writes, directs, and
          stars in this story of a preacher who is a fugitive
          from the law but who overcomes adversity and founds
          a new church.  This is a long film with a simple
          story, but everything is rushed to leave time for
          Duvall's extended sequences of preaching.  These
          speeches are a joy to watch only until it becomes
          obvious they are eating the rest of his film alive.
          This is a good film that should have been a lot
          better.  Rating: 6 (0 to 10), 1 (-4 to +4)
          New York Critics: 13 positive, 1 negative, 5 mixed</PRE>
<P>     For years I have thought that Robert Duvall is the best American
actor.  And his acting in THE APOSTLE is as good as ever.  But Duvall
has let his vanity run away from him in this film.  He has what could
be a moving story if he had taken the time to flesh it out.  Instead he
cut the story down to the bare minimum to allow for more time for his
preaching sequences.  The film comes in at a running time of 148
minutes, yet skimps on story-line for what should be a simple story to
tell.  One example of his skimping: Billy Bob Thornton goes through
some emotional changes and should be a major character, but his entire
presence in the film is reduced to two scenes,  And Thornton's changes
are too rushed, because the screenplay, written by Duvall give him only
the two scenes.</P>
<P>     Take all of the shouting and singling out of THE APOSTLE and what
is left is a rather simple and short story.  Sonny Dewey (Duvall) is a
charismatic Pentecostal preacher in both the common and the religious
sense of "charismatic."  He has been preaching in New Boston, Texas for
so long that religion has become an essential part of his being.  Every
moment of the day if he is not preaching he is hymn-singing.  If he is
not hymn-singing he is trying to convert somebody.  He seems to be
incapable of speaking three consecutive sentences without one of them
mentioning Jesus.  But his dedication to preaching is not enough.
Sonny's life starts to fall apart when his wife (Farrah Fawcett) and a
young minister cheat on Sonny together and then manage to oust Sonny
from his own church.  When chance brings together Sonny, the young
minister, and a baseball bat, Sonny unleashes his rage leaving the
minister in a coma.  Realizing that he is now in serious trouble, Sonny
flees to Bayou Boutte, Louisiana where he cannot resist the temptation
to start a new church.  Sonny takes a new name, calling himself "the
Apostle E. F."  But he still preaches in the style for which he was
known in Texas.</P>
<P>     It is redundant at this point to say that Duvall is good as Sonny.
That is really not the point.  He does a terrific job that won an Oscar
nomination and will very likely win the prize.  There is just more of
this performance than the film really needed.  Farrah Fawcett nicely
underplays her role as Duvall's wife.  It is hard to believe looking at
her worn hawk-like features that she was once a national pinup.  But it
is harder to believe that this is the same actress who seemed so
untalented in LOGAN'S RUN.  She deserved to be seen more in this film.
Fawcett has come a long way.  Miranda Richardson provides love interest
in the new life.  It would not be accurate to say, however, that Duvall
steals the film but that as writer and director he never gives it to
anyone else.  He gives the film very believable dialog and captures the
feel of the more rural sections of the deep South.</P>
<P>     Duvall is a good director and a better actor.  One can only
disagree with some of the choices he made in bringing together this
film.  This could have been an expose in the tradition of ELMER GANTRY.
After national scandals of clergy people being shown to be hypocrites,
it took some courage to make the hero of this film a preacher and a
hypocrite.  But Duvall does manage after a while to make his audience
feel for Sonny and want him to succeed.  The critics have mostly liked
this film better than I did.  I rate this film a 6 on the 0 to 10 scale
and 1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
