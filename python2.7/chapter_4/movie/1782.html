<P>     Wayne, or "Mad Dog", as he's called (Robert DeNiro), is a cop who
has never fired his gun.  When he saves mob boss Frank (Bill Murray)
from death at the hands of a common thief by using talk to diffuse the
situation, Frank feels compelled to reward Wayne for saving his life.
So he gives Wayne a gift in the person of Glory (Uma Thurman).  She is,
in essence, his property and at the end of a week he expects her back.
At first, Glory is an unwanted presence in Wayne's life but, as the days
go by, he realizes that she's what he wants more than anything else.</P>
<P>     MAD DOG AND GLORY is a film that takes a lot of chances, from its
choice of director to the roles played by two of its three leads.  While
the casting against type works strictly on the basis of the strengths
of the actors, Martin Scorsese's hand-picking of John McNaughton
(HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER) may not have been the best
decision.  McNaughton was brought on board the project to give it a
"different feel".  That is certainly achieved, but not necessarily for
the betterment of the movie.  MAD DOG AND GLORY has an extremely uneven
tone.  The dark moments are not dangerous enough and the more uplifting
scenes lack a much-needed lightheartedness.</P>
<P>     At times, the writing is also suspect.  Too often, the film stays
at arm's length from the audience, keeping emotional involvement to a
minimum.  While attempts are made to create three-dimensional
characters, the people in this picture never seem more than
half-developed.  The love affair doesn't take up enough screen time to
be vivid, and the relationship between Wayne and Frank never gels.</P>
<P>     It's difficult to write a romance that isn't sappy and in that, MAD
DOG AND GLORY is a success.  The putrid, silly dialogue of such films
as UNTAMED HEART is thankfully absent.  These people at least say and
do intelligent and reasonable things.  Although I felt something was
missing from this film, I was never insulted by it.</P>
<P>     Not since his abysmal performance in RAZOR'S EDGE has Bill Murray
tried to play it straight.  His job in MAD DOG AND GLORY is deserving
of mixed reviews.  He is competent--and sometimes quite good--but his
character never comes across as forcefully as it should have.  This may
have been as much the fault of the script as anything else, but it would
have been interesting to see how Al Pacino (who was originally offered
this role but begged off to do SCENT OF A WOMAN and GLENGARRY GLEN
ROSS) would have interpreted Frank.  So, while Murray has improved
since RAZOR'S EDGE, he still has a distance to go.</P>
<P>     Robert DeNiro is effective in an unusually restrained role.  In MAD
DOG AND GLORY, the actor's energy has been internalized, and this helps
Wayne seem more real than anyone else.  Uma Thurman is capable of
better work than the scope of her character allows.  She does what she
can with the role, and turns in a good performance, but it's a shame to
consider what might have been had the script given her more to work
with.</P>
<P>     The "gem in the rough" is Mike Starr's Harold.  Perhaps the only
character that clicks all the time, Harold is exceptionally funny--a
sensitive big guy who says the most unusual things--but is never
portrayed in such an over-blown manner as to be no more than comic
relief.  It would not be too far off the mark to say that character
actor Starr (whose previous credits include GOODFELLAS and THE
BODYGUARD) steals most of the scenes that he's in.</P>
<P>     Overall, MAD DOG AND GLORY is a mixed bag.  What's on the screen
is entertaining, but I often felt that I was only seeing half the
movie--the more interesting portion, perhaps, but still only half.  MAD
DOG AND GLORY was heavily edited, so part of the fault could lie there,
but the final result is not wholly satisfying.  It works, but not as
well as it could--or should.</P>
<PRE>                         Rating:  7.4 (B-, **1/2)</PRE>
