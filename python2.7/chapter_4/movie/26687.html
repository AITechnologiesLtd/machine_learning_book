<P>   I know a woman--and I'm sure you are familiar with the
type as well--who was the daughter of a moderately
successful professional man but who wanted far more wealth
and status than she was afforded.  She herself married a
highly successful lawyer and made her home in one of the
toniest burgs of New York's Long Island communities.  She
allegedly taught second grade for a year or two (though I
doubt her word on this), and to this day regularly chats with
her pals about the accoutrements of the family's latest auto,
the most recent trip to Provence or Tuscany, or the $100
repast she enjoyed with her group of ladies who lunch, which
she calls money well spent because "I'm worth it."  At the
same time she has no hesitations about confiding in what her
latest psychiatrist told her "the one I got after I fired the last
guy who did me no good" or about the handsome
European man she once met just before her marriage, "the
one I always wonder about...whether I should have accepted
his proposal instead."  This is a woman in conflict, a very rich
woman who dimly realizes that her life is empty, that she
never had any real work or identity of her own.</P>
<P>   Edith Wharton's partly autobiographical "The House of
Mirth," which deals with yet another individual who is of the
manor born but who, through a combination of her own
arrogance and thoughtlessness overwhelms her basic
integrity and contempt for hypocrisy meets a tragic fate, has
been successfully adapted into a richly textured drama. 
Filmmaker Terence Davies--who, though a methodical pace
and a wise refusal to make even his own dialogue sound too
contemporary--has brought to vivid life the compromises that
prominent women had to make as recently as the turn of the
Twentieth Century to keep their position.  When reputation
counted for all and a willingness to play by all the rules of
social convention was the only ticket to maintaining a
position in polite society, a decent woman with a mind of her
own had to accommodate herself to an often suffocating
existence in a world ruled thoroughly by men.  While Terence
Davies' "The House of Mirth" could be called a film
celebrating our current age of women's liberation, such a
stamp reduces the film to mere propaganda when in fact the
story is at heart a biting satire on a venal, insincere cosmos
of political and social backstabbing and of pathetic
compromises.</P>
<P>   In the central role of Lily Bart, Gillian Anderson ("The X-
Files") inhabits the guise of a woman who is described by
Miss Wharton at one point as "vigorous and exquisite, at
once strong and fine," and who as such is a welcome albeit
risky casting choice by Mr. Davies. While another filmmaker
might have gone with, say, Helena Bonham-Carter, Ms.
Anderson--who cannot be called a young, blushing beauty,
displays the bounce that made her the perfect choice to play
Special Agent Scully opposite her TV co-star David Duchovny
in the long-running series.  Displaying a brash indifference to
social convention, her character, Lily Bart, opens the movie
by accepting an invitation to tea by man-about-town lawyer
Lawrence Selden (Eric Stoltz)--inside his New York
apartment!  Though unmarried now and in her late twenties,
Ms. Bart takes the first step toward a slow descent in position
after begin spotted leaving the building by its owner, the
fabulously rich Sim Rosedale (Anthony LaPaglia), a fellow
who is both feared and respected by others in New York
society and yet whose identity as a Jew--so pronounced in
Wharton's novel--remains strangely unmentioned in the film.  </P>
<P>  Flirtatious to a fault, Lily is obviously in lust with Selden but
no union of marriage or even of much physicality takes place
because for her part, Lily is unwilling to combine forces with a
fellow who, relative to othes of her acquaintance, is poor,
while Selden--who seems to teach Lily that the conventions of
polite society are empty--is himself unwilling to break with
those very rules.  In other words, Selden is the story's
leading sellout.  </P>
<P>   With Ms. Anderson in virtually every scene, scripter-director
Davies takes us slowly and patiently into her decline,
tightening the noose almost imperceptibly during the 140-
minute piece so that we are scarcely aware until the
cataclysmic conclusion that Lily has been both lanced by
society and a victim of self-inflicted wounds.  The gambling
debts that transform her from a grande dame who believes
she has the world under her thumb thanks to her beauty and
charm become but a factor contributing to her loss of
reputation.  More important--and more cinematic as well--are
the by the ways that others in her little world use her to
satisfy their selfish ambitions.  Ms. Wharton's heroine joins
the likes of the eponymous character in Francois Truffaut's
1975 film "The Story of Adele H," done in ironically enough
by her decency and her stupidity.</P>
<P>   Whether this film works for you or not depends on your
capacity to enjoy a story that is uncompromisingly a period
piece, rich in costumes and even stilted in dialogue--all the
more to encourage us to think of the very contemporary
resonance that this director's decision evokes.  Davies shows
us not simply the avaricious and venomous nature of New
York society in 1905, but by extension demonstrates Edith
Wharton's own cynicism about the world in general.  Just as
Lily's "friend," Bertha Dorset played by the marvelous Laura
Linney as a bubbly, adulterous good-time-girl, is perfectly
willing to throw her buddy to the wolves to protect her own
reputation, so are politicians and businesspeople and, yes,
even the ordinary guy on the street agreeable to stab us in
the back when this suits their own ends.  As rich investor Gus
Trenor (Dan Aykroyd) demands sex as the price for
subsidizing Lily's waning fortune, so are many of us today
agreeable to demanding favors of woman whom they take out
to dinner and for whom they buy expensive presents.  </P>
<P>   While we can criticize Davies and Wharton alike for
displaying men as one-dimensional fixtures, some perhaps
even as plot devices, we should understand that Ms.
Anderson's Lily is in every way the axis around which an
entire organization evolves.  Though Eleanor Bron's
performance as Lily's rich aunt, Mrs. Peniston, is a caricature
worthy of Oscar Wilde's counterpart in "The Importance of
Being Earnest," Dan Aykroyd does fine in a serious role as a
male chuavinist pig, Eric Stoltz as a cool, conflicted playboy,
and Anthony LaPaglia as a complex person who withdraws
his offer of marriage when he no longer sees Lily as a trophy
bride. Talk about contemporary resonance!  If tragedy is
about bad things happening to a good person, this "House of
Mirth" easily justifies the irony in its very title.</P>
