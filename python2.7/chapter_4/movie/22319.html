<P>I didn't watch PLAY IT TO THE BONE – I sat through it.  If you've ever
seen a boxing match where you wish the guy who was knocked down didn't
get up, just so it would be over, you know what I'm talking about.  The
overall limpness of this production greatly overshadows a few worthwhile
moments of comedy, drama, and sport.</P>
<P>Vince Boudreau (Woody Harrelson – WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP, THE PEOPLE VS.
LARRY FLYNT) and Cesar Dominguez (Antonio Banderas – DESPERADO, THE MASK
OF ZORRO) are best buddies whose careers as professional boxers are on
the downswing.  Fortunately for them, the undercard for the Mike Tyson
match tonight just lost its scheduled fighters to a car accident and a
drug overdose.  If Vince and Cesar can make it from L.A. to Vegas by
Showtime, they'll be paid to fight for the first time in years, facing
each other, with a title shot going to the winner.</P>
<P>Vince's ex and Cesar's current gal Grace Pasic (Lolita Davidovich –
BLAZE, COBB) agrees to drive them in the hopes that she'll find an
investor to fund one of her wacky inventions at the fight.  A
long-standing rivalry becomes increasingly heated between Vince and
Cesar as the trip progresses, jockeying for a psychological edge and
Grace's attention.  Add free-spirited hitchhiker Lia (Lucy Liu – `Ally
McBeal') to the mix, and Grace's feisty disposition turns downright
spicy.  A couple of decent laughs aren't nearly enough to sustain what
drags into a tiresome majority of the film.  The bout itself proves to
be a monumental battle, with both fighters delivering and sustaining
almost inconceivable punishment in their quest for victory.</P>
<P>The central flaw of PLAY IT TO THE BONE is its failing to convince the
audience to care about its characters.  The bout itself is less than
climactic because by then it doesn't matter who wins or loses.  While
Harrelson and Davidovich do a fine job with their parts, I found myself
less likely to wince at the graphic depiction of the boxing match than
Banderas' performance as an actor.  If you're looking for a good boxing
movie, head to the video store for a copy of RAGING BULL.</P>
