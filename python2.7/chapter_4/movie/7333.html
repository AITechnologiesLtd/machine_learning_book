<P>     For better or for worse, most gay-themed motion pictures have a 
political ax to grind.  And, while that might appeal to those who enjoy 
movies that espouse a cause, it doesn't always make for the most 
entertaining time in a theater.  In may ways, therefore, Hettie 
Macdonald's feature debut, BEAUTIFUL THING, is a breath of fresh air.  
Instead of politicizing the issue of two adolescent boys' homosexuality, 
it keeps the story intimate, and, even on those occasions when the tale 
strays into over-familiar dramatic territory, BEAUTIFUL THING remains 
steadfastly faithful to the characters it has created. </P>
<P>     BEAUTIFUL THING tells of two teenage boys, Jamie (Glen Berry) and 
Ste (Scott Neal), who live next door to each other in southeast London's 
Thamesmead Estate.  When Ste's chronically abusive father and older 
brother apply a fresh beating to him, he goes to Jamie's mother, Sandra 
(Linda Henry), for sanctuary.  Ste ends up spending several nights in 
Jamie's room, and, as the days pass, the boys recognize a burgeoning 
attraction.  However, each of them is apprehensive not only about acting 
upon it, but about even admitting it.  Nevertheless, as others begin to 
notice the changing dynamic in their relationship, Jamie, the less 
popular of the two, becomes the target of his schoolmates' derision.   </P>
<P>     The central story is handled with warmth and intelligence by 
Macdonald, who is directing from a script adapted by Jonathan Harvey 
from his play (which she directed on stage, as well).  The relationship 
between Jamie and Ste comes across as surprisingly heartfelt yet 
unsentimental.  There's all the angst and uncertainty one would expect 
from boys struggling with a foreign sexual identity, recognizing that if 
they choose what comes naturally, they will face society's contempt.  
But this is also a case of first love for both of the principals, each 
of whom, in addition to facing their homosexuality, must struggle with 
the distress and rapture of a passionate adolescent infatuation.  
Macdonald, with more than a little help from two skilled young actors, 
Glen Berry and Scott Neal, manages to capture the nuances of the 
situation, exploring the emotional complexity of the circumstances 
without resorting to melodrama. </P>
<P>     Unfortunately, BEAUTIFUL THING has a plethora of subplots, none of 
which comes close to the main story in terms of richness or sensitivity.  
Jamie's stormy relationship with his mother represents the kind of 
dysfunctional family situation that has become a motion picture cliche.  
The same is true for Ste's interaction with his father and brother.  A 
neighborhood girl, Leah (Tameka Empson), initially looks like she might 
play an important part in the film, but she ends up in a supporting 
role, offering occasional comic relief and providing much of the 
soundtrack as a result of her obsession with Mama Cass (of the Mamas and 
Papas).  Despite having the potential to be BEAUTIFUL THING's most 
interesting character, she remains severely underdeveloped and 
underused.  Finally, there's Sandra's hippie boyfriend, Tony (Ben 
Daniels), who's a font of goodwill and stale platitudes.   </P>
<P>     The acting, as we have come to expect from British films, is solid 
from top to bottom.  Berry and Neal effectively convey their characters' 
situation to the audience, allowing us to share in the complicated web 
of wonder and pain that they experience as they come to terms with their 
identity.  Tameka Empson is delightful as the off-the-wall druggie Leah.  
Meanwhile, as Sandra, Linda Henry is a portrait of caged energy as a 
woman who loves her son but fears that she's an inadequate mother.   </P>
<P>     BEAUTIFUL THING uses numerous conventions of urban dramas and 
forbidden love stories in its framework, but, because Macdonald keeps 
the focus intimately on Jamie and Ste, the result is still satisfying.  
Only the ending, which gives a false sense of closure to an otherwise 
well-balanced narrative, feels wrong.  Otherwise, BEAUTIFUL THING 
represents a keen, personal look at the difficulties of growing up gay 
in a heterosexual world. </P>
