<PRE>                             EDWARD SCISSORHANDS
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1990 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     Tim Burton is the director who brought us BEETLEJUICE, BATMAN, and
now EDWARD SCISSORHANDS.  EDWARD SCISSORHANDS is, briefly speaking, a
kind of fairy tale version of FRANKENSTEIN, but unfortunately the fairy
tale element is not made clear early on and the enormous holes in the
story are pretty darn distracting until you accept the conventions of
fairy tales and throw logic and verisimilitude onto the trash heap (if
you do).</P>
<P>     There are indeed yawning chasms in the story's logic which are only
bridged by the sense of wonder and delight which Johnny Depp elicits in
your humble poster.  OK, I'm going to be perfectly frank with you and
say I have not a clue as to who Johnny Depp is, what he does, or even
what he looks if he doesn't look like Edward Scissorhands.  I have it
in my mind that he might be a musician.  But actor or musician,
pre-Edward, he ought to be recognized from now own as a brilliant
comedic actor, highly reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton.
I have to say that his performance is nothing less than inspired; it
absolutely saves the movie from its own inconsistencies and illogic.</P>
<P>     On the other hand, or scissors, Winona Ryder is completely lost
inside her blonde wig in this movie, to say nothing of wasted.  Burton
seems to have directed her to shed all hints of personality.  Quite
honestly, any presentable young woman off the street could have
delivered the same performance.</P>
<P>     Fortunately for me, she is shines with intense brilliance in
another Christmas movie this season, MERMAIDS, otherwise I might write
her off as completely forgetable.</P>
<P>     Diane Wiess plays Winona's mother, an Avon lady who discovers
Edward in his castle on the edge of the most outrageously bland
subdivision ever put on film; Burton out-Waters John Waters in his
vision of a pastel hell.  Wiess is her usual, reliable, wonderful self;
mothering, protecting, always slightly out of synch with the world she
lives in.  When she enters the castle, which was decorated by a spacey
descendant of the person who did up Dracula's, and she says "It's your
Avon lady," it's completely right.</P>
<P>     Burton, the director, shines in the look and feel of EDWARD
SCISSORHANDS, but his story sense is as out of control as ever.  And
will he realize that Danny Elfman's music is as irritating and
distracting as it is ugly and pretentious, and stop using him?</P>
<P>     Another surprising deficiency were the models and mattes used to
establish the castle and the suburb.  Completely unconvincing,
embarrassingly obvious.  For a movie that puts such an emphasis on its
look, has spent lots of time and money on special effects, make-up, and
cutlery, this seems especially odd.</P>
<P>     But to end this on a positive note, let me mention the small role
of the Scientist as played by Vincent Price, who is looking rather old
and frail these days, but is still an icon to be reckoned with.  It was
the Scientist who created Edward and died before he could give him
hands.  In a flashback, we visit his laboratory cum factory.  He is not
so much a Mad Scientist, as he is a Whimsical Scientist; his machines
are humorously anthropomorphic and I for one will forever envy him his
cookie cutters.</P>
<P>     I recommend EDWARD SCISSORHANDS if you can leave your logic in the
lobby; only then will you enjoy it as it should be enjoyed.</P>
