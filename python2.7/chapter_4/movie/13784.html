<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>There are many films that feature crazed individuals roaming around
neighborhoods, skewering Innocent Bystanders in the futile attempt to
get the one person who typically escapes.  These individuals are
intensely violent people, who show no remorse or feeling at any time
during any of these films.  Sometimes the films that revolve around
these people are good; often times they are lousy.  Any way you look at
it, I think the makers of these films have been focusing on the wrong
side of the story all these years.</P>
<P>Sure, knives plunging into teenagers' backs is interesting.  An ice
skate in the face will never fail to grab my attention.  I even like the
fracturing of ankles by means of dumbwaiters.  But, for all of the happy
joy that one may find in scenes like these, I doubt that any of them can
compare to what it would be like to understand the thought process of a
maniac like Michael Meyers.  He is, perhaps, one of the most interesting
characters in any film I've ever seen.  There is no character
development, of course (such a term can only be used mockingly in this
context), but he is certainly a prominent character in this film.  I
think a mock-biography on Michael Meyers would have been more
interesting than anything presented in Halloween:  H20.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, it seems that viewers are more content with the slasher
stuff.  I can identify with that; it's fun to escape into ultra-violence
like this every once in a while.  As a horror flick, H20 isn't too bad. 
It's fun, and even witty (gasp!) at times.  It's intelligently-crafted
by director Steven Miner, and well-acted by the wonderful Jamie Lee
Curtis.  There isn't a whole lot of new material presented in this
particular genre piece, but I was surprised with how much I enjoyed it.  </P>
<P>This is the seventh film in the Halloween series, the first of which
was made twenty years ago by a fellow named John Carpenter.  I tried so
hard to see that film before this one, but, alas, I was unsuccessful. 
I've seen the last five minutes of it, but I can't make a fair judgment
of quality.  I hear it's good.  I'll leave it at that.  </P>
<P>Jamie Lee Curtis reprises her role from the first film as Laurie Strode
(though she's changed her name for security reasons).  She is the sister
of the homicidal maniac, Michael Meyers.  Among other things, I'd like
to know why they have different last names.</P>
<P>Well, poor Laurie is still very upset, twenty years later, and it turns
out she has good reason:  Mike is back in town, and he's pissed!  He's
here to take revenge on his sister, who apparently failed to kill him. 
For some reason, he wastes a lot of time with Innocent Bystanders, and
doesn't even work towards mutilating poor Laurie until the very end of
the film.  When it turns out that she was right about her brother, she
takes it very well, and tries valiantly to murder him with a fire axe.</P>
<P>I guess most sins are exploited in various kinds of films.  Like the
other members of the "teen slasher" genre, H20 is porno for the
violence-obsessed.  It's not quite as shameful as some of the
less-intelligent entries into the genre (there are so many that listing
examples is highly pointless).  Miner is miraculously able to manifest
suspense and menace out of a lot of scenes (the dumbwaiter is a terrific
set piece), and, no matter how many times you look at that imitation of
William Shatner's face, it still looks scary.  I was amazed that I
actually felt suspense at any time during this film -- not even the
Scream films managed to provide suspense for me.</P>
<P>Curtis is very likable here, as she always is.  I think she's a gifted,
funny actress who hasn't gotten a lot of recognition for her talents. 
Her role here feels a bit obligatory, as if the paycheck were a little
more influential than the chance to create something grand and artistic,
but I liked watching her anyway.  What's also nice is that there are
some good scenes between Laurie and her son, John (Josh Hartnett) that
effectively lampoon as character development.  </P>
<P>There are also some nifty turns towards the end, such as an unexpected
final showdown between our heroine and her loony bro.  H20 is a step
above its siblings in acting and directing, but the very fact that it's
a slasher flick keeps it from really getting anywhere.  What would have
made worlds of difference here?  Show me a psychoanalysis of Michael
Meyers.  Or maybe a thermal brain scan.  I'd like to see a nutty
psychiatrist question him in prison, and toy with him in a covertly
sadistic way.  I mean, it's cool and interesting that Mike kills a lot
of people, but aren't the thoughts behind that crazy mask more
interesting?  I'd sit through ten more Halloween films if just one of
them explained just what, exactly, can make a man so insane.</P>
