<PRE>                              THE FOUNTAINHEAD
                       A film review by Ralph Benner
                        Copyright 1996 Ralph Benner</PRE>
<P>     Lovers of old films claim King Vidor's 1949 version of Ayn Rand's
THE FOUNTAINHEAD is among the most neglected of classic bad movies.
They're right. Scorned because of Rand's Objectivism -- in a nutshell
the antithesis of altruism -- and attacked because its style reeked
with cheapie film noir effects, the movie never got the audience it
deserved until revival houses flourished in the 60s and 70s and, later,
became available on video. Hard to imagine audiences in 1949 not liking
it, especially since the rapid fire invective against collectivism is
screamingly funny: "Give in, compromise, you'll have to later anyway";
"You can't stand alone, give in, become one of us"; "Be middle of the
road, why take chances?"; "Can't you give in just once?"; "Don't defy
common standards." Wasn't all this as jocular then as it is now? Not
even the Harvard Lampoon appreciated the bombast, naming it one of that
year's worst. (Today that crowd would cheer, though perhaps in private
they did back then, too; they may have been Tooheyed into public
conformist reactions.) What's possible is that much of the audience
simply didn't get Rand's diatribe-warning about the "world of the mob"
and its rules that destroy creativeness, individuality. Coming out when
it did, a few years after World War II, when the Communist scare was
just about to explode, when the middle class was about to be tracted to
death with suburban living, there was no tolerance for a movie
advocating the virtues of self.  Rand's Objectivism was then, and still
is, anathema to religious and political demagoguery, because it loudly
proclaims that the creative self is more important than the denial of
self for the sake of others. It's Rand's simplicity -- not
simple-mindedness -- that scares the money-grabbing celibates,
pedophiles, phony evangelicals and corrupt politicians; without the
continual suffering of others, they lose control.  Admitting that this
is a stretch, THE FOUNTAINHEAD is the precursor to the 1956 B-movie
chiller INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS. Both warn about the dangers of
Stepford Wifeism.</P>
<P>     Rand was adamant her architect Howard Roark wasn't modeled after
maverick Frank Lloyd Wright, but readers and viewers of THE
FOUNTAINHEAD can't escape the similarities in that Roark's
architectural style and his difficulties with the establishment
parallel Wright's in so close a fashion that there's no way out of
comparison. It was always a disservice to herself that she denied any
linking, because what could she have lost had she said Wright's
insistence on not compromising to "the drooling dolts" of sameness was
a model? (Nothing; she would have gained.) Even capitalist ring-wingers
and smartened-up liberals who might have otherwise been sympathetic to
her philosophy, which is more American than her critics acknowledge (or
are aware of), found themselves turned off by her denials. And surely
when she wrote the screenplay, and saw the artists' concepts of Roark's
architecture, which includes a ripoff of the masterpiece Fallingwater
and an "Enwright" skyscraper, or listened to Gary Cooper closely
approximating Wright's voice and its cadence, she had to recognize that
she couldn't go on fooling anyone anymore. But none of this takes away
from the sheer pleasure of the movie itself; in fact, it may help us
enjoy it more.</P>
<P>     An erotic madness swirls throughout THE FOUNTAINHEAD, and though
the novel itself is a glory to macho sex  -- rape as prelude to love,
high-rises as phallic symbols -- the movie has the additional heat of a
real-life affair between Gary Cooper as Roark and Patricia Neal as
Dominique. Movies before this one have dealt with female submission to
the penis in much the same way -- the heroine has to first pound on or
claw at what she surrenders to. Here, there's something dangerous added
to the mix: Neal's insatiable, pent-up desires must first be stoked by
swacking Cooper's his face with a riding whip, urging him on to sexual
assault, which no doubt she has been fantasizing about. Though these
scenes are lifted from the book, they don't have the frenzy that Neal
and Cooper bring to them. Coop's stoic impassiveness and Neal's arched,
caustic instability comicly implode; while they're combusting with
lust, we laugh at the high theatricality. But the carnality's real:
when their fling ended, Neal was in the throes of a nervous breakdown.
Postulating the male viewpoint of sex -- Dominique's more like a
feminist male hustler than a frilly romantic -- Rand implicitly essays
that women want to be raped before they can love; she even has Roark
say -- it's in the book too -- "Pressure is a powerful factor, leading
to consequences." The book doesn't have the mocking merriment that the
movie flaunts: when Neal hears that line, we know that it's only a
matter of minutes before she'll experience sex as the natural and in
her case very much needed leveller.</P>
<P>     Neal's appeal is limited; she's pre-hardened as most of her movies
begin, so about all that's left to react to are the mind games her
characters insist on playing. Her Kentucky accent suggests an imposing
Tallulah, without the extension of satiric drawl, and she's far more
attractive to look at. Her hyper hot ice demeanor is super charged --
she's a simmering defiant. In her finest hour, as Alma in Martin Ritt's
HUD, there's a looseness -- her Texan-Sears catalog dresses seem to
free her from the haute couture modulation she relied on as acting. But
her dare is strongly catalytic, and Paul Newman's Hud, like Coop's
Roark, is compelled to conquer. Unlike Dominique, who "loves" Roark not
only for his sexual powers but also for the "greatness of (his)
achievements," Alma has always known that Hud's no good; even if she
coaxed on Hud's advances, his assault of her confirms the lowest
estimate he has of her, and women in general. In THE FOUNTAINHEAD,
she's archetypic, a pressure cooker, and -- hard to know if it's
intended -- intensely likable; when she emotes, it's as if she's
edged-out on one of those grass-induced contemplative, paranoiac highs
during which the mind races while the body & face remain chicly
immobile.</P>
<P>     Gary Cooper wasn't much of an actor, though his granite stolidness
was -- and may still be -- appealing because it seemed indestructible;
there was no way he knew how to let us down us in the moral crunch.
Seldom believable in anything he played because his monotone, his
inflexible face never had any depth, he managed to move audiences
anyway: his stiff curmudgeon in LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON taxes us yet
we're delighted that his at-the-very-last-minute romantic sense takes
charge so he can go after Audrey Hepburn. But Coop's pure Americanness
is his reel virtue; he's the independent, sturdy God-like WASP who
reassures audiences against corruption. (James Stewart and Henry Fonda
define morality too, but as actors they once in a while could get
mighty humanly riled up.) Defending himself in THE FOUNTAINHEAD--
having deliberated dynamited a project he designed after it was changed
to meet mediocrity's demands -- Coop is the pinnacle of the stalwart,
resolutely honing in on the blessings of the "creator" and the evils of
the "parasite." A forgone conclusion that the shame he inflicts on a
society mired in conformity will acquit him, it's still persuasive
fifty years after Rand's novel first appeared.</P>
<P>     Robert Douglas is incomparably snakey as Ellsworth M. Toohey, the
"impractical intellectual" architecture critic for the yellow-streaked
N.Y. Banner. The ultimate bourgeois, out to destroy originality that
endangers the mainlining of the mediocre, with cigarette in filtered
holder, penciled mustache, receding hair, Douglas's Toohey is the
emblem of those wanting to control all others and rule the world in
their own image. We've had the snobs-leeches before and since (George
Sanders won an Oscar for his "Ratsputin" DeWitt in ALL ABOUT EVE) yet
none personify the calculated viciousness we know exists in many of
them in quite the way Douglas does; his Toohey might be Rand's updated
perception of Brendan Gill going berserk on venomous afterthought in a
N.Y. Reviews of Books piece about Joseph Campbell -- written after
Campbell's death.</P>
<P>     Rand's the original Libertarian -- the pontess of freedom
advocating "the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own
happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive
achievements as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute."
That sounds a little like Republicanism before the fundamentalists took
charge with their Contract on America, but even when the
holier-than-thou fascists weren't in power, right-wing had the
connotation that we must conform to a singular idea of what our
democracy stands for: the rich get richer, while the rest become
slaves. It's clear that Rand, through Roark, would rather suffer
hardship before becoming another's lackey. She certainly wasn't a
Democrat, because she railed against social welfare. But she knew
labels themselves were restrictive and dangerous, that though labels
were nebulous of real meaning, they were sold as having strict
definitions, mostly dictates to subservience. Its original source less
so, the movie THE FOUNTAINHEAD is impossible not to like because the
crazy, wildly ludicrous elements that make it an expressionistic attack
against social and spiritual peonage are more torchbearing than ever.
Probably King Vidor didn't have the prescience in seeing it for what it
would become: just about the most liberating bad movie ever made.</P>
