<P>     "Could I have your breast?" may not be the most conventional 
opening line, but, surprisingly enough for young Tete (Biel Duran), it 
actually works.  Seconds later, Estrellita (Mathilda May) has lowered 
her top, and the kid finds himself eye-to-nipple with the "most 
beautiful breast" he has ever seen.  What's more, when he asks for a 
drink, Estrellita is more than happy to oblige with a stream of milk.  
Is this a dream or reality?  THE TIT AND THE MOON never makes it clear, 
but, given the strange way that the plot progresses, I'm inclined to 
believe the latter.</P>
<P>     The title is certainly provocative enough, and, as one might 
suspect, a lot of breasts are exposed during the ninety-minute running 
time.  Most of them are pretty nice, too, making this Spanish-language 
release an ogler's delight.  The film is intended to be a randy farce, 
and, when it succeeds, that's what it is.  Unfortunately, there are also 
significant stretches when it's rather dull and silly.</P>
<P>     I guess my tastes don't match those of director Bigas Luna.  I feel 
much the same about THE TIT AND THE MOON as I did about his 1992 
feature, JAMON, JAMON (although, to be fair, I enjoyed this one a little 
more).  In between, he did something called GOLDEN BALLS, and, while I 
missed that one, the title indicates it's just another variation on 
similar themes.  Luna's films are thick with sex and naked bodies, but 
his plotlines are shallow.</P>
<P>     The story, such as it is, takes place in Cantalonia, where Tete 
works as an anxanta, the boy who climbs to the top of human pyramids.  
When Tete's mother gives birth to a new son, the older boy suffers from 
an acute case of envy that his brother has a breast to suckle.  One 
night, Tete begs the moon for a breast of his own.  His pleas are soon 
answered when Estrellita, the "Queen of Stuttgart", and her husband, 
Fartman Maurice, the "Fire King" (Gerard Darmon), arrive in town to 
perform at the Cava Park nightclub.  But Tete has a rival for 
Estrellita's affections.  Lovesick Miguel (Miguel Poveda), a local 
electrician, spends all night serenading his beloved with flamenco 
songs.</P>
<P>     For roughly thirty minutes, THE TIT AND THE MOON plays like an 
offbeat coming-of-age story, and, as such, is absurdly entertaining.  
Tete is a strange child, but he has several endearing qualities -- 
curiosity, earnestness, and a kind of naivete.  Unfortunately, the film 
veers way off course before the halfway point, concentrating on a 
completely uninvolving love triangle featuring Estrellita, the Fartman, 
and Miguel.  For long stretches during the second half, Tete's sole 
function is to sneak around peeking at half-naked women while providing 
a wise-beyond-his-years voiceover.</P>
<P>     When it comes to tasteless, off-the-wall humor, Luna rivals Benny 
Hill.  Unfortunately, the director is handicapped by a pointlessly 
foolish storyline.  Ultimately, THE TIT AND THE MOON provides exactly 
what you'd expect from a motion picture with that title.</P>
