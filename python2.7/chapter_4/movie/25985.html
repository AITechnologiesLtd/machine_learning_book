<PRE>"Billy Elliot"</PRE>
<P>The coal miners may be in the midst of a tense strike in the northern English
mining town of Durham, but young Billy Elliot still has to take the boxing
lessons his father insists on. Billy would rather dance than fight, so when Mrs.
Wilkinson's all girl ballet class has to share the gym space with the boxers, he
sheds his gloves for ballet slippers in "Billy Elliot."</P>
<P>The simplistic script by first-timer Lee Hall runs a routine path with its
inspirational story about going after what you love to do regardless of the odds
and obstacles. Young Billy has a natural desire to dance and, with the help of
the obligatory muse Mrs. Wilkinson (Julie Walters, "Educating Rita"), overcomes
every obstacle - principally the prejudice his father has toward dancers, who
must be poofters. Inexplicably, dad's fears that his son is becoming a flaming
homosexual are shoved aside with little fanfare and, suddenly, pop is crying,
saying, "Let's give the boy a #$%&* chance!"</P>
<P>Most everything is handled in this perfunctory manner. Mrs. Wilkinson is intro'd
as a dance dynamo and teacher - tough on the outside, but extremely
compassionate inside. She pushes Billy to develop his talent and love for dance,
encouraging him to apply to the Royal Ballet School in London. Mrs. Wilkinson
then drops out of the movie, not even mentioned again, except for a brief coda
when Billy goes off to fame and fortune.</P>
<P>Another problem, maybe with the script or maybe with the film's budget, is the
sparseness of the supporting cast. Billy is a likable kid, but the movie only
shows him having one friend, an obviously closeted Michael (Stuart Wells) whom
likes to dress up in his mother's clothes. Michael heavy-handedly represents the
"gay" lifestyle, but the kid doesn't dance, so I don't get it. The short shrift
given to such background considerations gives the film a shallowness that the
energetic performance by Jamie Bell as Billy can't overcome. Gary Lewis, as
Billy's dad, also has a considerable presence, but is hamstrung by the banal
development of his character's abrupt change of heart.</P>
<P>There is a good deal of visual imagination provided by the camera of Brian
Tufano ("Trainspotting") with tightly shot, energetic dance numbers and tense
movement when the action joins the coal mine strikers. One amusing tracking shot
has Billy's little friend, Debbie, absently dragging a stick along a wall that
suddenly becomes a phalanx of police shields. She continues to drag her stick as
if along a picket fence, without so much as a glance at the heavily armored cops
guarding the strike.</P>
<P>Jamie Bell's Billy is fun to watch as he tramps around in combinations of step
dancing, tap, ballet and plain old foot stompin'. There's a lot of energy in his
performance, making him the reason for seeing the film. The music selected,
especially the nicely used overture from "Swan Lake," complements the story and
the dance. Unfortunately, the earthy language negates the inspirational aspect
of the yarn that might appeal to younger auds and frequent use of the "F" word
may be a turn off. A silly epilogue that features the premier dance of an older
Billy doesn't help. I give it a C.</P>
