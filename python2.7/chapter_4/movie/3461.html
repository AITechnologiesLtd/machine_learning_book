<PRE>Introduction
============</PRE>
<P>     Look for some inspired casting in two of this week's new
releases.  The action/adventure/buddy-comedy/everybody-gets-shot BAD
BOYS pairs television comics Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, while the
romantic comedy DON JUAN DEMARCO teams Johnny Depp with Marlon Brando.
(Hey, look what it did for Martin Landau!) The latter also stars Faye
Dunaway.  Other new releases:  BOY'S LIFE, A GOOFY MOVIE, and SEX,
DRUGS, AND DEMOCRACY.</P>
<PRE>EXOTICA                                            Rated "R" / 103 min.
=======</PRE>
<P>     The mysterious, monotonous world of a Toronto strip club is
explored in this mysterious, monotonous movie from Canadian director
Atom Egoyan (FAMILY VIEWING, THE ADJUSTER).  The layers of the story
are peeled away every-so-slowly, as the film discreetly expands upon
the relationships between a patron, a dancer, and a deejay.  The
mystery--and the promise of a payoff--is good for about an hour,
after which point the evidence begins to mount that there's really
nothing waiting at the center.</P>
<PRE>     This onion's hollow.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: C+</PRE>
<PRE>MURIEL'S WEDDING                                   Rated "R"  
================</PRE>
<P>     Spring must be the time for wedding movies.  Last year it was Hugh
Grant attending FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL.  This year it's newcomer
Toni Collette in the crowd-pleasing MURIEL'S WEDDING.  Though billed as
a comedy, this Aussie import is really a revenge fantasy.  Don't look
for any role models in these shallow, callow characters who seem better
suited to real-life than romantic comedy.</P>
<P>     Thank goodness, then, for Toni Collette.  With her ill-fitting
clothes and some forty-odd pounds of extra weight, she the ungainly
starlett that we've been waiting for.  Her brain may be vacant--Muriel
knows nothing more than a want to get married--but she's a joy to
watch.  Whether singing along to ABBA, or beaming at the altar, she
radiates more charm than Andie MacDowell has ever known.</P>
<P>     Badly edited, and played way too far over-the-top, MURIEL'S
WEDDING still delivers the laughs.  The film is overlong, though, with
thirty minutes of unnecessary drama that's almost too much for this
little film to have to bear.</P>
<PRE>Grade: B-</PRE>
<PRE>QUEEN MARGOT                                       Rated "R" / 143 min.
============</PRE>
<P>     Quite the racy love story, QUEEN MARGOT is dressed-up as a 16th
Century period piece involving French Catholics, Protestants, and the
entire court of King Charles XI.  At the center is Margot (Isabelle
Adjani), the King's Catholic sister, who would like nothing more than
to forget her marriage of convenience to Henri of Navarre (Daniel
Auteuil), also a Protestant.  They were wed for peace, or so they
thought, until most of Henri's guests (1000+) are slaughtered at the
Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre.</P>
<P>     This is strong stuff, and certainly not for the squeamish.  It's
also quite confusing, thanks to the subtitles and the continuous stream
of new characters.  Have no fear, as all becomes clear in due time.
After about ninety minutes, the actors take over and help transform
QUEEN MARGOT into a simple--though quite twisted--love story that just
*looks* like a big historical drama.</P>
<PRE>AWARD NOTE:  Virna Lisi won Best Actress at last year's Cannes Film
             Festival for her poisonous portrayal of Court Matriarch
             Catherine de Medicis.  Wicked.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: A-</PRE>
<PRE>TANK GIRL                                          Rated "R" / 104 min.
=========</PRE>
<P>     The first comic-book film of the year stars Lori Petty (FREE
WILLY) as an impulsive, wise-cracking punkster who roams the wastelands
of 2033 for the seemingly sole purpose of fighting the Water and Power
Police.  The latter is led by Malcolm McDowell, who did us all a big
favor by killing Captain Kirk in STAR TREK GENERATIONS.  She also
steals a tank, hence the name, and, later, hooks up with some mutant
Kangaroos, one of whom is played by rapper Ice-T.</P>
<P>     TANK GIRL benefits from a hot soundtrack (supervised by Courtney
Love) and a good production design.  Of course, neither is enough to
sustain viewer interest into the second hour.  This poor film doesn't
know what it wants to be, and so the narrative veers wildly in every
direction.  Don't be surprised when the characters break into a
song-and-dance routine.  You have been warned.</P>
<P>Next up: BATMAN FOREVER, then JUDGE DREDD.</P>
<PRE>Grade: D+</PRE>
<PRE>TOMMY BOY                                          Rated "PG-13"
=========</PRE>
<P>     The rules must go something like this:  if you're a current cast
member of "Saturday Night Live," then you get your own movie.  No
questions asked.  Now it's Chris Farley's turn.  He plays the no-brain
son of an auto parts manufacturer (Brian Dehenney), who's forced to go
on the road to save the company.  His travel companion:  David Spade,
also of SNL.</P>
<P>     As expected, Farley makes an easy target for Spade's sarcastic
barbs.  It's "stupid" this, and "fat" that--inoffensive routines that
fall somewhere between the material in DUMB AND DUMBER and PLANES,
TRAINS, AND AUTOMOBILES.  The physical gags aren't bad either.  The
scene of Farley trying to change clothes in an airplane restroom is
easily worth the price of admission.  With Bo Derek, Rob Lowe, Julie
Warner, and Dan Aykroyd.</P>
<P>Next up: STUART SAVES HIS FAMILY (with Al Franken).</P>
