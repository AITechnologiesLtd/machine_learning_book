<P>About 25 minutes into the sneak preview of "Cruel Intentions," during a 
close-up shot of Sarah Michelle Gellar and Selma Blair french-kissing, a 
couple sitting next to me scooped up their young children and left the 
theater in a huff, grousing that they didn't want to expose their kids to 
"goings on like these." I wondered, of course, why Ward and June had 
brought their kids to an R-rated film about sexual manipulation in the 
first place. But even more puzzling was why it had taken 25 whole minutes 
for them to get offended enough to leave. </P>
<P>Lascivious and trashy, "Cruel Intentions" is so eager to shock and 
titillate that it's almost endearing. In its quest to be this year's 
"Wild Things," the potboiler trots out virtually anything that be could 
considered even vaguely forbidden to a young person, from interracial 
romance and gay male sex to pseudo-incestuous grinding between step-
siblings. The dialogue features surprisingly graphic descriptions of all 
things erotic. Even the most common of cinematic teases, a simple glimpse 
of the male lead's butt, is presented in a flashy pull-away shot intended 
to maximize its impact. Amazingly, the visual "tah-dah!" worked and a 
number of audience members actually gasped at the sight of Ryan 
Phillippe's bare bottom. Just imagine what they would have done had he 
flashed his winkie.</P>
<P>The fourth film based on Choderlos De Laclos' 1782 novel "Les liaisons 
dangereuses," "Cruel Intentions" is a teenage version of "Dangerous 
Liaisons," with Phillippe and Gellar subbing for John Malkovich and Glenn 
Close. While Gellar basically turns her emotion meter to the "bitch" 
setting and leaves it there, Ryan Phillippe gives a much more interesting 
performance. As a young cad trying to fool those around him, he neatly 
slides from effete Malkovich wannabe to faux-sincere weasel to genuinely 
infatuated kid effortlessly. He is a lot of fun to watch.</P>
<P>The story, set in Manhattan's upper-crust society, focuses on the twisted 
antics of two inexplicably jaded brats. While Kathryn (Gellar) schemes to 
turn the naïve Cecile (Selma Blair, whose clumsy, overdone 
characterization resembles some perverse hybrid of Elly Mae Clampett and 
Jethro Bodine) into a tramp, her step-brother Sebastian (Phillippe) sets 
his sights on deflowering the beautiful Annette (Reese Witherspoon), 
daughter of the new school headmaster and author of a "virgin manifesto" 
published in Seventeen magazine. Convinced that the chaste girl is too 
much even for Sebastian, Kathryn makes a bet with her sibling: If he 
succeeds, she'll have sex with him, but if he fails, she gets his 
gorgeous 1956 Jaguar. </P>
<P>Interestingly, Roger Kumble, author and director of this adaptation, 
proves adept at presenting decadence but stumbles when dealing with 
heartfelt romance. The wicked parts of the film, while undeniably 
ludicrous, are also quite entertaining, but when matters turn sincere and 
moralistic, the production hits the ground with a loud thud. There is 
another problem. Interracial and gay liaisons are depicted in a matter-of-
fact fashion that is refreshing, but the commentary surrounding the 
affairs reinforces racist and homophobic attitudes. Had Kumble exercised 
more care with his writing, he could have made the scenes work without 
fueling bigotry.</P>
<P>Those significant flaws aside, the film was far more engaging than I 
expected it to be. Like "Wild Things," "Cruel Intentions" is forthright 
about its lewd trashiness. This is a calculated guilty pleasure and, on 
those terms, I enjoyed it.</P>
