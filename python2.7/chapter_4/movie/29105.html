<PRE>_The_Score_ (R) *** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        Frank Oz, well-known for directing comedies such as most recent film,
_Bowfinger_; and even better known as the man pulling the strings behind Yoda
and Miss Piggy, is perhaps the last person one would expect to breathe some
renewed life into the classic heist picture.  Yet that's exactly what he and a
superb cast do in the sleek entertainment that is _The_Score_.</P>
<P>        "Renew" seems to have been the key idea behind _The_Score_, particularly
in its story.  The basic plot is something that has been seen many times before.
 Montreal-based career thief Nick (Robert DeNiro) wants out of the criminal life
to settle down with his flight attendant girlfriend Diane (Angela Bassett). 
First, though, Nick agrees to one last heist at the urging of longtime associate
Max (Marlon Brando)--the theft of a priceless French scepter held in a customs
house.  Two wild cards are put into play: one, said customs house is in
Montreal, thus violating Nick's rule of not doing local jobs; and two, he must
work with a young upstart named Jack (Edward Norton), who has already studied
the inner workings of the building under the guise of a mentally challenged
janitor.</P>
<P>        Instead of trying to add new wrinkles to the time-worn recipe, Oz strips
the genre down to its bare core.  The plot is as simple as it sounds, and the
twists in the story occur according to readily apparent schedule.  Oz doesn't
stop there, however.  The film's R rating comes exclusively through language,
for he doesn't allow himself the easy out of titillating or distracting the
audience with gratuitous violence or sex.  Hence it's that much more dependent
on the cast to engage the viewer, and everyone lives up to their stellar
reputations.  A noticeably galvanized Brando appears to have a ball sharing
scenes with DeNiro (perhaps because, if the stories are to be believed, that
DeNiro himself directed them, not Oz, with whom Brando clashed), and the
electricity emanates from the screen.  Norton not so surprisingly keeps up with
his elders with extraordinary ease.  His live wire performance plays well
against DeNiro's cool calm, making for an intriguingly volatile chemistry.  Of
the core cast, Bassett fares the least well--if only because her role is never
more than the token love interest.</P>
<P>        The no-frills mindset Oz brings to _The_Score_ puts the most pressure on
himself when it comes time for the heist to take place.  The pattern of
obstacles thrown in Nick and Jack's way are obviously as meticulously calculated
as the heist plans the pair map out, but Oz is able to keep the tension taut by
sticking to the minimalist approach.  There aren't any overwrought score cues or
out-of-nowhere physical confrontations to artificially manufacture suspense; Oz
is wise enough to know that a simple gesture such as having a stray leg briefly
creep into the picture of a security monitor is enough to generate the real
deal.</P>
<P>        Touches like those and the film's attention to pure performance, both in
front of and behind the camera, give _The_Score_ a distinctly old-fashioned
feel--and in a season of CG effects _and_ thespians, such embracing of the
basics is not only refreshing but feels downright innovative.</P>
