<PRE>Up and Adam
Big Daddy</PRE>
<P>By Ross Anthony
I'm an Adam Sandler fan, so I was eager to see "Big Daddy." However, it's
not one of the most memorable films he'll ever make.</P>
<P>Basically, Adam's a 30-year old still living the life of a teenager and
liking it. But, his girlfriend has had enough of his non-committal attitude;
so 1) she takes a hike, 2) small child arrives at his doorstep, 3) Sandler
decides to adopt the kid in hopes that he'll (Sandler) will learn those
adult characteristics so desired by a girlfriend that the filmmakers didn't
spend any time making us care about.</P>
<P>There's really not much to say about this film. It was refreshing to here
Sandler use his regular voice and not one of his stupid character voices.
You see, I think he's both very funny and very talented on screen -- he
doesn't need the cartoon voices. Let me just go way out on a limb here and
say -- Adam Sandler has the same kind of dramatic talent in him that an
actor like ... say Tom Hanks ... has. Now, there I've said something
profoundly dissonant haven't I? Speaking of drama, "Big Daddy" is much more
of a light drama than a comedy. It certainly has comedic moments, and even
though they weren't very uniformly or artfully distributed (for instance the
ending is strangely more silly than the rest of the film); it's still
moderately funny/dramatic overall.</P>
<PRE>Starring Adam Sandler.
