<P>TWELFTH NIGHT is an adaptation of Shakespeare's bittersweet
romantic comedy about shipwrecked siblings, mistaken identities,
and, of course, true love.  The story opens with a storm at sea
during which Sebastian and Viola, twin brother and sister, are
separated in a shipwreck.  Each presumes the other dead and
proceeds to make a new life for himself and herself in Illyria, the
ancient country on whose shores each is washed up.  Viola dis-
guises herself as a man and befriends Orsino, Duke of Illyria.
Sebastian lies low with the assistance of his friend Antonio.  Even-
tually, Viola and Sebastian are reunited, but not before they both
participate in the wooing, winning, and wedding of the Duke's
beloved Countess Olivia -- together, that is, with Olivia's uncle
(Sir Toby Belch), her steward (Malvolio), her woman (Maria), 
and the uncle's protege (Sir Andrew Ague-cheek).  Feste, one
of Olivia's servants and resident clown, wanders in and out of the
proceedings, alternately making trouble and dispensing wisdom.</P>
<P>Director-screenwriter Trevor Nunn, a director emeritus of the
Royal Shakespeare Company, has adapted the play to film in
a variety of structurally effective ways.  Initially, while keeping
the locus of the action in the Dukedom of Illyria (watch for a
quick cut to Baedeker's ILLYRIA), he has updated the play in
both time and setting to the early-middle nineteenth century.
Additionally, he has reordered the sequence of a number of
scenes in the play and presented them in such a way as to
make greater cinematic sense of the action as a whole.
Finally, he has "opened up" the play for the film.  The ship-
wreck scenes, in particular, have been judiciously expanded
to provide some enlightening backstory on the characters.
Among other things, these scenes establish Sebastian and
Viola as professional performers, thereby lending credibility
to their subsequent disguises.  These scenes also establish
the nature and depth of the friendship between Antonio and
Sebastian.  Overall, despite some vocal dubbing inconsist-
encies, and a few rather abrupt scene changes that could 
have been fleshed out to provide clearer narrative transitions,
the film is a delightful adaptation of the play.</P>
<P>The film was shot on various locations in Cornwall in the autumn.
Thus, the sea is present and visible in many key external scenes.
Additionally, the locales have a fairy-land aura to them:  Olivia's
manor seems like Cinderella's house, and Orsino's fortress seems
like the Prince's castle.  While there are no specific allusions to 
Christmas time (apart from the title of the film), the warm reds,
greens, and golds of the season, as well as of autumn, predominate.
Outdoors, these are the colors of fruit and foliage.  Indoors, these
are the colors of interior decoration and decorative foliage.</P>
<P>The acting is superb.  Nicholas Farrell's Antonio adds a dimension
of sexual attraction to his friendship with Sebastian that Farrell
sublimely conveys without speaking.  The fact that Antonio knows
the attraction is not mutual only serves to deepen the pathos of the
friendship.  This male-male pairing is contrasted to the female-female
pairing of Olivia and Viola, another situation in which the attraction is
not mutual.  Both of these pairings are set off against a third male-
female pairing of Orsino and Viola.  This pairing is not conveyed
dramatically as well as it could have been; one senses an incipient
attraction more because one perceives it to be logical than because
the actors have conveyed it emotionally.</P>
<P>Helena Bonham Carter's Olivia is a joy.  In a well-paced transition,
her Olivia moves from grief-stricken sister who has sworn off men
to eagerly lovestruck ingenue and covers all points in between.
Similarly, Nigel Hawthorne's brilliant Malvolio is a character of 
many layers.  Wearing an obvious and ill-fitting toupee that is both
the symbol of his dignity and an object of derision, he is capable
of low comedy, high dudgeon, and touching pathos.  Ben Kingsley's
Feste is a fabulous concoction of reserved wisdom and loud annoy-
ance.  He is also possessed of a very sweet singing voice and sings
all of the songs in the play.  Considering that these have been sung
and recorded fairly frequently by world class singers of art song,
Kingsley does a remarkably fine job with this music.</P>
<P>The depth of affection between Viola and Sebastian in this film is
something profound to behold.  The invisible bond between them
conjures up the other when only one is on the screen.  Imogen
Stubbs and Steven Mackintosh are made up and photographed
in such a way that they really appear to be twins.  Moreover,
the resemblance goes more than skin deep, because they truly
act as brother and sister.  As individual actors, each seems to be
an opposite side of the same coin.</P>
<P>As the film ends, various couples come together and various single
persons go their own ways.  The dispersion of the latter is quite 
touchingly staged, suggesting that, while all may end happliy ever 
after for those who have found their true loves, others are still left
alone and bereft.</P>
<P>Apart from everything else this film has to offer, it presents an excel-
lent opportunity to watch an ensemble of accomplished Shakespearean
actors at work.  Additionally, it offers an opportunity to bask in the
rhyme and meter of Shakespeare's spoken verse.  Finally, it provides
an opportunity to consider, or reconsider, an ostensibly light-hearted
play that nevertheless continues to reveal hidden depths of the human
heart in a series of small epiphanies.</P>
