<PRE>Pretty Tough
Miss Congeniality</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>It's an average film, packing some good Grace-Harty laughs while others 
gags fall off the mark. The most difficult to swallow being the film's 
premise that Sandra Bullock (as FBI agent Grace Hart) should somehow be 
unattractive without lipstick and nail polish.</P>
<P>Tomboy Grace Hart must go undercover as Miss New Jersey in the Miss 
United States beauty pageant (oh, sorry, make that "Scholarship 
pageant"). She's one tough lady sincerely unaccustomed to manicures and 
high heels. Therein lies the film's strongest hits - rugged Bullock 
trying to look sweet, elegant and giddy - all the while gritting her 
teeth in disdain. Unfortunately, some of the punch relies on our 
believing that Bullock isn't already beautiful. Such a presupposition 
leaves audiences feeling a tad insulted.</P>
<P>After a fine opening sequence the film moves quickly into a cheesy 
detective bust scene, compromising the momentum. Though it seems to be a 
cop movie, "Miss Congeniality" is essentially a "Cinderella" comedy. 
Since the slim climax relies on FBI plotting, it's authority wanes for 
lack of substantive action.</P>
<P>Still, Bullock and Michael Caine (as the beauty expert in charge of 
"transforming" this hardened agent into a queen) are marvelously 
charming, clever and fun together. Some of the dialogue here takes the 
crown.</P>
<P>Benjamin Bratt performs respectively. You'll also enjoy Candice Bergen 
and William Shatner as the co-hosts of the pageant.</P>
