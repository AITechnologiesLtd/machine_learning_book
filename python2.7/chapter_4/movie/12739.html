<P>   Basketball is described in Spike Lee's latest movie as
"poetry in motion," but Lee attaches a cynical twist to that
notion.  We may root for our home team, but those of us
who were not born yesterday know that the game is not one
propelled exclusively by the fancy of an inspired muse but
one which is driven by the attraction of cold cash.  In "He Got
Game," just about everyone jumps through hoops to make up
for some lack: what is missing is not identification with a club
sporting your town on their shirts and jackets but the
avariciosu want of currency.  One guy wants money to buy
the latest Nike shoes, another for a Lexus, and a great
many can put the coin of the realm to good use to buy their
way out of the Coney Island projects.  In many cases, then,
the name of the game is not basketball.</P>
<P>   But for Jesus Shuttlesworth (Ray Allen), basketball is not
the means to an unrelated end but a purpose in itself.  In "He
Got Game," Allen--actually a pro basketball player with the
Milwaukee Bucks who can really act--plays a graduating high
school student in Spike Lee's native Brooklyn who has
received so many offers from colleges that he needs time to
consider his options.  Surprisingly enough, money does not
seem uppermost in his mind: this can be explained by his
disgust for the greed of those surrounding him.  Everyone
wants a piece of Jesus.  A slick sports agent for a pro team
shows him his Long Island home, which boasts a stable of
cars worth well over a million and a basketball court
built right into the dwelling that could have been used for four
bedrooms.  His girl friend Lala (Rosario Dawson), realizing
that she will lose Jesus when he goes off to college, cuts a
deal with an agent for her own financial gain.  His foster
father wants the lad to buy him a home in Long Island in
return for his paternal services over the years.  But the most
unusual exploitation comes from his own dad, Jake (Denzel
Washington), who is promised time off from his manslaughter
term in Attica if he can persuade his son to enroll in the
governor's favorite college.</P>
<P>   Despite the very natural desire of people to strive for their
own gain, it is ultimately Jesus's father who transcends selfish
advantage by breaking through to his deeply hostile son. 
After all, when you witness your mom's violent death at the
hands of your dad--even if your father did not desire her
demise--you are not going to take kindly to his influence.  To
Spike Lee's credit, the writer-director has his audience acutely
moved by Jake's plight, rooting for him to re-acquaint himself
with the antagonistic young man, while at the same time
indicating Jake's dark side in a series of flashbacks
throughout the 131-minute story.  Truth to tell what saves "He
Got Game" from a hackneyed albeit well-told narrative is
Lee's camerawork.  Coney Island, which forms the backdrop
to the account, has never looked so beautiful, with even the
freak show taking on the dimensions of a cultural institutions
and Nathan's hot dog emporium substituting for Lutece.  The
final image, Jake Shuttlesworth's coming full circle in his
relationship with Jesus, is priceless. </P>
<P>   Though "He Got Game" is at heart a sentimental yarn about
the fragile bonds connecting father and son, and though Mr.
Lee appears to disapprove of the material base which
underlies both college and professional sports, the director
shows an affinity for the game of basketball.  Using slow-
motion photography, he does indeed prove that his hoop
dream is poetry in motion, as Malik Hassan Sayeed's camera
follows the orb on its recurrent expeditions to the basket. 
Denzel Washington, sporting a retro Afro above an expansive
breadth of facial hair, is not too convincing when playing
Jake's dark side, but when he turns on the nostalgia he
evokes compassion in all but the hardest of audience hearts. 
Ray Allen is surprisingly good as the movie's answer to
Michael Jordan and Rosario Dawson as girl friend Lala, Milla
Jovovich as the hooker who is saved by Jake, Ned Beatty as
Warden Wyatt and John Turturro in an uncredited role as a
big college coach provide a worthy ensemble.  The director
roasts whites and blacks alike for their avarice and brutality,
delightfully exaggerating the extent to which universities will
go to bring jocks to their campuses--even using bimbos to
feign instant infatuation with these alpha males.  Like the
others, Jake is out for himself, motivated by a need to get out
of Attica.  But he alone shows a real concern for his boy.  If
we are not for ourselves, who will be, writer Lee implies.  But
as the prophet Hillel continues, if I am not for others, what am
I?  Rated R.  Running time: 131 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten
