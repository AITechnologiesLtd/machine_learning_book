<P>     The better you know movies, the more appreciation you'll have for
the wit and energy of Barry Sonnenfeld's GET SHORTY.  While it's quite
possible for the cinematically unaware to enjoy this film--it's got a
fair amount of readily-accessible comedy and action--this is a real
treat for movie buffs.  The story is as much about the love of motion
pictures as it is about gangsters.</P>
<P>     Scott Frank's script for GET SHORTY, which lifts huge chunks of
dialogue directly from the book, captures the spirit of Elmore Leonard's
work the way no previous adaptation has been able to (THE MOONSHINE WAR,
STICK, CAT CHASER).  This film is wry and sardonic all the way through,
with the actors and director knowing exactly how to play each scene for
maximum effect.  GET SHORTY is much more a comedy than anything else,
and a very funny one at that.</P>
<P>     John Travolta, playing his second gangster in a row, is Chili
Palmer, a loanshark on a mission to Los Angeles to recover $300,000
gained through an insurance fraud.  Once near Hollywood, however, Chili,
an avowed movie-lover (he has the lines from TOUCH OF EVIL memorized and
can recognize RIO BRAVO from a sound byte), becomes seduced by the
thought of producing a film.  So he hooks up with schlock director Harry
Zimm (Gene Hackman) and scream queen Karen Flores (Rene Russo).  And
when Chili starts to pitch an idea, none other than big time actor
Martin Weir (Danny DeVito) shows interest.  Nevertheless, even as things
start looking up for Chili's movie, a host of gangsters try to muscle in
on his action--one way or another.</P>
<P>     Not since SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER has John Travolta been this cool.
His comeback work in PULP FICTION may have been effective, but he's
better here.  Travolta has got Chili down cold, from the mannerisms to
the look.  With a fine supporting cast that includes Danny DeVito, Rene
Russo, and the always-reliable Gene Hackman, Travolta is surrounded by
talent.  It would have taken a poor director to botch up this
production.</P>
<P>     One of the great pleasures of watching GET SHORTY is that you don't
have to turn off your brain while the film is on screen.  The script is
smart, and makes few concessions to mentally challenged audience
members.  There's a lot going on beyond the obvious.  Take role
reversals, for example.  As Chili is seduced from a criminal lifestyle
by movies, his motion-picture colleagues are drawn away from film by the
lure of the gangster experience.  Ultimately, it turns out that the
common denominator for success in either career is attitude--a quality
which Chili possesses in abundance.</P>
<P>     Those familiar with PULP FICTION may detect hints of that film
here, and not just because of Travolta's presence.  Much of the dialogue
has the same kind of quirky, snappy quality as that which Tarantino
writes.  (Quentin is an admitted Leonard fan; in fact, his next
directorial effort may be an adaptation of the author's RUM PUNCH.)
There's one instance where tough gangsters discuss the meanings of
"e.g." and "i.e."  On another occasion, Chili lectures Martin on the
importance of a stare.</P>
<P>     The ending is a little reminiscent of that of THE PLAYER, with a
couple of big name cameos.  It's a clever way to conclude a wonderfully
entertaining romp.  GET SHORTY may indeed be 1995's PULP FICTION, but
this less profane film is likely to find wider acceptance.  It's
certainly more mainstream, but, at least in this case, that's not a bad
thing.  With GET SHORTY, Sonnenfeld has shown that broad appeal doesn't
necessarily equate with stupidity.  That's a lesson Hollywood should
learn.</P>
