<P>Tak Thoughts 
------------
     "One day you are going to lose everything you have.  
Nothing will prepare you for that day. Not faith... Not religion... 
Nothing.  When someone you love dies, you will know emptiness... you 
will know what it is to be completely and utterly alone.  You will 
never forget and never ever forgive.  For some things there is no
forgiveness... absolutely none."
     - John Bergan
       Introduction to THE CROW trade paperback</P>
<P>     If you want an unbiased review of THE CROW (movie), you'll
have to go elsewhere.  I'm afraid I can't help but compare the movie 
to the original comic series by James O'Barr from which it was 
adapted.  Yep, you guessed it.  The original was better.</P>
<P>     THE CROW (comic series) is an incredible work.  Not your
typical comic book.  It contains beautiful illustrations and poignant 
poem and song excerpts.  Not your typical story, either.  It's a 
heartbreaking story of lost love and a shattered life.  I've read it 
dozens of times and it never fails to move me.  The chapter titles 
give a feeling for the tone: PAIN, FEAR, IRONY, DESPAIR, DEATH.</P>
<P>     THE CROW (movie) failed me here.  It was certainly dark and
gloomy.  Detroit looked like Gotham city, the soundtrack was great (go 
buy it) and there were hardly any bright colors.  But I didn't feel 
it.  Nor did I feel like any great atrocity was committed.</P>
<P>     Brandon Lee, however, was great. He's believable as a good
person involved in an atrocity.  He tries to pull off the pain and 
agony felt in the story, literally writhing with pain at times. 
Although right from the story, this agonizing didn't play well on the 
screen, actually provoking giggles from younger audience members.</P>
<P>     I read that James O'Barr became good friends with Brandon Lee
during the filming.  So it's hard to imagine him being angry, outraged 
or unaware of the changes.  I hope the decisions were out of O'Barr's 
hands.  You'd think a comic book would be perfect for movie 
adaptations -- they've got the story, and even a storyboard.  But they 
still changed, added, and cut things.  Substantial things.</P>
<P>     o Originally, the atrocity was random and senseless. Now it's
       because Shelly took a stand against an eviction.</P>
<PRE>     o Originally, the little girl was a pitiful victim of a druggie 
       mom. Now she's a spunky Terminator II John O'Conner.</PRE>
<P>     o Originally, Erik had no powers other than being already dead.
       Now he's gets "Crow-Vision", vulcan mind-meld powers, and a 
       talisman (the crow) that powers his prolonged mobility.</P>
<P>     o Originally, Eric tracked his murderers, and interrogated street
       scum for clues, with the crow as an invisible cameo. Now he 
       receives supernatural guidance from the ever-present crow.</P>
<PRE>     o Originally the villain just evil, a leader of a gang who 
       stopped along a road, killed Eric, then raped and killed his 
       fiance.  Now the villain is much more business-like and has a 
       kooky/kinky sister who spouts mystic nonsense and worships 
       eyeballs.</PRE>
<P>     o Originally, police involvement is almost background. Now two 
       minor police characters are combined into a sidekick/co-star.</P>
<P>     o And we get lots of Hollywood-isms.  Car chases, wry police 
       humor, rooftop sword fights, and a politically correct and 
       sanitized story. "These things [cigarettes] will kill you."  
       The dialog with the druggie FunBoy is missing, and the "crown 
       of thorns" morphine scene is reversed and sanitized.  Dammit. </P>
<P>     But just so I don't end on a bad note, the shoot-out (combined
from two scenes in the original) where Eric confronts and takes out a 
whole room full of "foot soldiers" was awesome.  It's extremely well 
choreographed and exciting to watch.</P>
<P>Tak Rating:
-----------
     As a translation of O'Barr's THE CROW, the movie has some serious
failings.  THE CROW (movie) introduces Hollywood-isms, new plot 
elements, and can't portray the sheer tragedy, atrocity and pain. 
I won't tell you to not go see it, I couldn't bear to do that, 
especially if you haven't read it.  Just be aware that THE CROW story 
is orders of magnitude better than THE CROW (movie).</P>
<PRE>  avoid at all costs        see several times (w/friends) as matinee
x wait for videotape        see once at full price
  watch it on cable         see it several times - full and/or matinee
X see once as a matinee     see many times at full price </PRE>
