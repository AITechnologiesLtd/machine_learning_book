<PRE>                                101 DALMATIANS
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Well, another new Disney movie is coming out and with it comes the
theaters packed with screaming babies, very restless kids kicking your
seat, and throngs of grownups providing running commentary of everything
on the screen (to themselves, not the kids).</P>
<P>     This is not a good thing.  This time, the Disney movie is 101
DALMATIANS, the live-action version, and if any movie could make me long
for a quick and painless death, this is it.</P>
<P>     In an era when we get smart "children's" movies like BABE, why does
dreck like this have to continue to be made?  The new 101 DALMATIANS
goes like this:  Roger (Jeff Daniels) is a video game designer in London
(where all the best video game designers live, I'm sure), and Anita
(Joely Richardson) is a fashion designer in the employ of one Cruella
DeVil (Glenn Close).  Roger and Anita both have Dalmatians, and the
super-smart dogs conspire to get Roger and Anita together.  He proposes
marriage an hour after he meets her, they get hitched, the Dalmatians
have puppies, and Cruella decides she wants them for a coat.  Cruella
steals the happy couple's puppies plus a bunch more from other people. 
Dogs outwit baddies and escape, bringing down Cruella and her evil
henchmen.</P>
<P>     Well, la-dee-dah.  This plot couldn't be less interesting if it was
written by HOME ALONE's John Hughes.  Oh, wait a minute!  It *was*
written by John Hughes!  Silly me!!!  In fact, 101 DALMATIANS is almost
*exactly* the same movie as HOME ALONE.  Point in fact:  Kid/dogs in
trouble; bad guys chase him/them; kid/dogs end(s) up being much more
resourceful; bad guys fall down a lot.  Oh, funny!</P>
<P>     Maybe you're saying, "Hey, this is a kid's movie!  Lighten up!" 
Well, I don't think it's anywhere near being suitable for children,
despite it's G rating -- there are blatant sex jokes, dead/dying
animals, reactionary Puritanical attitudes (women should stay in the
home), and downright destructive messages.</P>
<P>     And this movie isn't for adults, either, because this next brick in
the wall of the Disney empire is so dumbed-down it ends up just rotting
the audience's brains.  There's never any sense of "thrill" to this
adventure, the acting is mundane, and I laughed at *one* single joke
("Who gets the gold?")  But hey, this is Disney, and maybe brain rot is
what they're aiming for!  (Because then you'll pay to see next year's
animated HERCULES, which, from the trailer, looks even worse.)</P>
<P>     So what do we learn from 101 DALMATIANS?  That your dog is smarter
than you?  That if your dog saves someone else's dog, you get to keep
it?  Who can say?</P>
<PRE>     Hell, I'm a cat person, after all.  So what do I know?</PRE>
