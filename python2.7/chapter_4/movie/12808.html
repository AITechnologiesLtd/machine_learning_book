<PRE>                            QUEST FOR CAMELOT</PRE>
<P>Warner Bros.  Studio's animation films go back to 1958 when it won an
Oscar for KNIGHTY KNIGHT BUGS.    The current offering is its first full
length animation, one that kids should like very much.</P>
<P> Based on the Camelot legends and the sword of Excalibur, it makes a
departure from the story by having a girl as the protagonist   This was
the time of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table when Knighthood
was in flower, as the saying goes.     Sir Lionel (voice of Gabriel Byrne)
had a daughter Kayley (voice of Jessalyn Gilsig; singing by Andrea Corr)
who wished to emulate her father and to also become a knight.     When
Ruber (Gary Oldman) and his equally vicious aid Griffin (Bronson Pinchot)
steal King Arthur's sword Excalibur, it is Kayley who sets out on the
dangerous mission of recapturing the sword and saving Camelot.</P>
<P>Her adventure leads her through lush, beautiful  forests inhabited with
strange animals that lend themselves to talented animators.   There she
meets a young, blind man, Garrett (Cary Elwes , singing by Bryan White)
who joins forces with her.   Along with them is a comical two-headed
dragon (Eric Idle and Don Rickles).    They also meet up with old Merlin,
the magician, (Sir John Gielgud).   As well, they rescue Kayley's mother,
Lady Juliana (Jane Seymour).</P>
<P>While the movie is sure to please the young, it does lack a bit of
excitement. The drawings are well done; the story is excellent.  And the
cast behind the animation is perfect.  Still, it could have used some
spark to light the fire to all of it.  Unfortunately, it did not quite do
that.</P>
<P>The story is based on THE KING'S DAMOSEL by Vera Chapman. Original songs
composed by David Foster and Carole Bayer Sager. Musical score by Patrick
Doyle.</P>
<PRE>                      Directed by Frederik Du Chau.</PRE>
