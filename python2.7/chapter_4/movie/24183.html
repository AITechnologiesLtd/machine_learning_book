<P>American popular music may have changed in style as time has gone by,
but has remained constant in theme. The topics of romance and
heartbreak remain characteristic of the genre, reflecting the
obsessions of its youthful audience. This film uses popular music to
metaphorically represent the turbulent romantic life of its
characters.</P>
<P>The story begins as Rob Gordon (John Cusack) and his current
girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) are breaking up their relationship. Rob
is the main character, a young record store owner who has classified
and cataloged his romantic failures as obsessively as his record
collection. He recounts his most troubling breakups and analyzes where
in the pantheon this latest one should be placed. Rob decides (aided
by an apparition of Bruce Springsteen) that in order to understand his
bad luck with romance, he must revisit and dissect each of his worst
breakups and understand the problems in the relationships that caused
them. The most enjoyable part of the film is the depth to which Rob
goes in exploring all aspects of his old relationships. It is an
intelligent approach that is not often seen in popular film.</P>
<P>In contrast to its serious side, Rob's connection to popular music
also anchors its humorous part. The record store he owns specialized
in rare and collectible vinyl records, and the two clerks who work for
him are indeed odd characters. There is the neurotic and meek Dick
(Todd Louiso), and unrestrained Barry (Jack Black). The elitist trio
sneer at all people, even customers, who have "lesser" tastes in
music. It is a construction that does not necessarily make them
likeable, but makes them entertaining. Barry in particular is often
overboard, but also causticly funny.</P>
<P>Although it is common to use voice over narration at the beginning of
a film to set context, or at the end of the film to provide an
epilogue, it is not often used by good films as prominent part of its
storytelling. This film uses soliloquy (having Rob talk directly to
the audience) to distracting excess. It is far too easy to have the
character intravenously feed the audience his inner thoughts. Good
craftsmanship could have expressed these feelings in a more indirect
manner, such as inter-character dialog and expressive performance. It
is surprising that veteran director Stephen Frears chose this route.</P>
<P>The other major complaint is the use of an overly melodramatic plot
device to develop Rob and Laura's relationship. The suddenness and
force of this occurrence feels manipulative. The weaknesses of this
film are surprising considering the body of work compiled by Stephen
Frears, whose films are generally more oblique and engaging.</P>
<P>Recommended. The film attempts to intelligently and realistically
examine the issue of relationships in modern life, and it is mostly
successful in this dimension. It also uses character based humor that
is frenetic, but still enjoyable. The film has definite weaknesses
which keep it from reaching its full potential, but it remains a more
thought-provoking exploration of romance than what is typically
produced.</P>
