<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A shoestring budget sci-fier from Edward L. Cahn that was the forerunner of
Alien (79). It's about a stowaway worm-like monster from Mars, who is snacking
on the space crew. </P>
<P>A spaceship crash-landed on Mars in 1973, as the film begins six months from
that time. For the last two months, a rescue ship was sent. When it finally
reaches Mars, which is about the size of Texas, the only survivor found is Col.
Carruthers (Marshall Thompson)--the first man shot into space. But there are 9
murdered crew members and evidence that some of his crew may have died from
gunshot wounds, as the arrogant rescue commander, Col. Van Heusen (Kim
Spalding), believes Carruthers killed them for their food supplies and is taking
him back for a court martial. </P>
<P>The only one of the crew to listen to Carruthers and not judge him guilty, is
the pretty nurse, Ann (Shawn Smith). His defense is that a mysterious creature
is doing it, and she's willing to still be friendly with him and give him a
chance to prove his innocence. But Van is also keen on Ann, and her attention to
Carruthers only makes him despise Carruthers even more. </P>
<P>But soon the hissing "It" creature (Ray "Crash" Corrigan) shows its ugly head
and kills Keinholz by osmosis, as it precedes to break all his bones and suck
out of him all his body fluids. </P>
<P>The crewmen now are engaged in a life and death struggle with the alien
creature, as they find bullets, bombs, and gas can't kill it. The best battle
scene is in the room with the air ducts, as the crew becomes aware if the
monster destroys the ducts the ship could drift in space forever. </P>
<P>Considering the budget constraints the film was operating under, this film
nevertheless proves to be an entertaining one and features a well-crafted script
by Jerome Bixby; it is one that is devoid for the most part (except for the
character played by Kim Spalding) of stock characterizations. It sets an eerie
atmosphere by its shadowy photography and in the claustrophobic setting of the
spaceship, and even if the monster in a rubber-suit was not as scary as
laughable--that only proves how much fun the film could be. I happened to like
it better than I did Alien, even though the later is technically far superior.</P>
