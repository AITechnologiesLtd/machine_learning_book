<P>        Given Hollywood's most recent ode to a sexually-obsessed bad boy,
it's natural to expect `Private Parts' to be `The People vs. Howard
Stern', a ringing affirmation of how our basic constitutional freedoms
must be protected against the crusades of the prudish religious right. 
To the filmmakers' credit, `Private Parts' opts not to wrap itself in the
flag or present Stern as a crusader for any ideal loftier than ratings
and his right to stay on the air. But even without pretensions of
political or historical weight, `Private Parts' is crafted as a movie
about a hero's triumphant struggle in support of a cause.  In the
tradition of such diverse films as `Mister Roberts',  `One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest',  `Dead Poets Society', or most similarly, `Good Morning,
Vietnam', the film adopts the tried-and-trued Hollywood formula of
pitting a rule-breaking, authority-defying rebel against the bureaucratic
stuffed shirts.  Guess who wins and guess whose side we're on?</P>
<P>`Private Parts' follows Howard Stern, playing himself, from his
childhood as the son of a carping radio engineer through his gawky
college years at Boston University to his first jobs with small radio
gigs on Long Island, Hartford and Detroit.  To his own amazement, his
pitiable attempts to attract women bear fruit with the radiant and
warm-hearted Alison, who agrees to be his wife and support his struggling
career.</P>
<P>While Howard's love for radio stems from childhood visits to his
father's station, his success in the business comes only slowly.  He
lacks a natural radio voice, a flaw which he tries to mask by raising his
voice half an octave to a near sing-song, and lacks a comfortable on-air
identity. It is only when Alison convinces him that he is at his best
when he is being himself that Howard starts attracting big ratings while
provoking the frantic anxiety of station managers and account executives.</P>
<P>What exactly is Howard Stern when he's being himself?  The film
begins with a voice-over declaration from Stern bemoaning how he is
always misunderstood.  It is hard to tell from this film, or from
occasional exposure to his radio and TV shows, what there is to
misunderstand.  Quite simply, Stern is the uninhibted, unleashed, voice
of male pre-pubescent masturbatory fantasies, a cross between
Beavis-and-Butthead and Penthouse Forum, with a brain focused on penis
size, large-breasted women, menage-a-trois, lesbian love scenes and the
like.  Where most of us restrict this kind of talk to private spaces and
eventually (pretend to) grow out of it, Stern gets to share his pee-pee
and wee-wee talk daily on the air.  And given that most of this subject
matter remains officially taboo, he gets to attract a mass audience in
the process.  The Howard Stern phenomenon is nicely explained in a scene
where a station executive shares audience research showing that the #1
reason why Stern's fans listen to his show is to find out what he'll dare
to do next--and that Stern's haters listen even longer for the very same
reason.</P>
<P>Stern's material is vulgar, infantile, offensive and in many
cases, extremely funny. The movie plays the laughs brilliantly by
delivering the raunchiest bits as part of Stern's on-going battles
against the tight-assed executives of his stations in Washington and WNBC
in New York. After Stern's been reminded of the seven dirty words not to
say on radio, he and his cronies play an on-air game show that involves
searching for the missing words that go with `willow' and `a-doodle-doo'.
 Another outrageous scene involves Howard leading a female listener to
on-air orgasm. The higher-ups may fume and rant, but they can't stop him
because the more outrageous his material, the better his ratings.</P>
<P>The movie's message seems to be that no matter what Stern says or
does on the air, it's okay because it's honest and because deep down he's
a nice guy who's all talk but no action.  The counterpoint to all Stern's
fantasy talk about sex with Playmates is his marital fidelity to Alison
(Mary Mc.Cormack) and his personal loyalty to his on-air colleagues
Robin Quivers and Fred Norris (both played by themselves).  Like most
fictional Hollywood heroes, Howard nearly loses both Alison and Robin at
different points, but manages to regain their trust and win them back. 
Alison genuinely struggles with embarrassment over her husband's on-air
antics, but ultimately retains her confidence that he's a good man.</P>
<P>The film, directed by Betty Thomas (`The Brady Bunch Movie'), 
mostly follows a straight-forward narrative style, punctuated by
occasional fantasy scenes and `here's-us-filming-a-movie' interludes that
simply seem out of place.  Stern does a marvelous job playing Stern,
especially during the bell-bottomed, big-afro, cheesy mustache 1970's. 
Paul Giamatti, a largely unknown film actor, is especially hilarious as
the New York station manager, nicknamed Pig Vomit by Stern, driven to
apoplectic fury by his foil's unstoppable antics. Giamatti creates one of
the finest buffoons since Herbert Lom's days as boss to Inspector
Clouseau.</P>
<P>`Private Parts' concludes with three scenes: a triumphant concert
in Central Park to celebrate Stern's rise to #1 in the ratings; Howard
turning down an easy score and embracing his wife and children; and a
defeated Pig Vomit grumbling about that goddamned Howard Stern.  With the
support of the people, the rebel has conquered the stuffed shirts and
kept his gal. And thanks to the courage of this true-life Hollywood hero,
most of America can now share a grown man's locker-room sexual fantasies
for hours on end every day.</P>
