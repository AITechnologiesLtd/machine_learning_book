<PRE>LOVE AND DEATH ON LONG ISLAND
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1998 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>** (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>        It's hard to knock a film that has its heart in the right place.</PRE>
<P>        The central theme of "Love and Death on Long Island" is that love
can sometimes be found in the most unusual of places, and it's a
refreshingly warm-hearted tale at that.  But the film's distractions are
many and director Richard Kwietniowski's unsure touch is what finally does
it in.</P>
<P>        Dominating the film is John Hurt, who plays a stuffy and reclusive
British writer, Giles De'ath (pronounced day-ath).  Giles, a widower,
rarely leaves his London home, either to give interviews or do lectures,
but has reached a point in his life when he feels the need to do something
new.  Happening out to "the pictures" for the first time in years to see an
E.M. Forster adaptation, Giles accidentally winds up in the adjacent
theater showing the sophomoric comedy "Hotpants College II" (a terrific
title, by the way).  As he is about to leave, he catches sight of a boyish
stud playing a pizza boy and, if you believe in such things, it's love at
first sight.</P>
<P>        Giles' interest in Ronnie Bostock (Jason Priestley) turns into an
obsession.  He starts a scrapbook (which he labels "Bostockiana") replete
with cut-outs of the teen idol from juvenile magazines sporting such
headings as "Hollywood's most snog-able fellas!"  He rents Ronnie's cheesy
videos--"puerile romps without a single redeeming feature"--like "Tex Mex"
and "Skidmarks."</P>
<P>        And, on the advice of his agent, who suggests Giles take a trip, he
heads to Chesterton, Long Island in the hope of meeting the object of his
affections.</P>
<P>        It's a nice idea, and Hurt plays Giles to the hilt.  But although
Hurt is good, he can't keep this "erstwhile fogey" from bordering on
cliché.  That's because the writing and direction are sub-par; we've all
seen the eccentric Englishman in strange environs before and the
fish-out-of-water situations that are meant to be humorous actually dilute
the film.  "In America you ask for the check and pay with a bill while in
England you ask for the bill and pay with a check?"  It's true, I'm afraid.
Having a video clerk yell out embarrassing-sounding movie titles to the
stock boy in back is also too familiar.</P>
<P>        Ultimately, it's hard to believe that Giles has been so reclusive
that he can't tell a microwave from a "video player," or that you also need
a television set in order to preview the original "Hotpants College."</P>
<P>        When Giles gets to Long Island he locates Ronnie's supermodel
girlfriend, Audrey (played stiffly by the Courtney Cox-esque Fiona Loewi),
and uses her to wrangle a meeting with Ronnie.  Slowly--and the film is
extremely slow paced--Giles get to know Ronnie and finally confesses his
love for him in an awkward scene in which Priestley's acting ability is
severely tested.</P>
<P>        One central difficulty with this unashamedly sweet love story is
that Giles' initial crush on Ronnie is entirely superficial, and the scenes
where he comes to "know" him are unconvincing at best.  Dudley Moore
learned his lesson in "10," but poor Giles never catches on: there's more
to love than hotpants.</P>
<P>        "Love and Death on Long Island" has its funny moments and is
unquestionably a fine vehicle for Hurt, but its lightweight predictability
makes it hard to recommend.</P>
