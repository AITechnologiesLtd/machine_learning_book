<PRE>                                  HOT SHOTS
                       A film review by Randall Rhea
                        Copyright 1991 Randall Rhea</PRE>
<P>     HOT SHOTS is a slapstick comedy film in the tradition of such
movies as AIRPLANE! and THE NAKED GUN.  </P>
<P>     The fact that this film is one of the season's top grossers is
ample evidence of how dismal this summer has been for the movie
industry.  HOT SHOTS provides only an occasional gut-laugh; its bad
jokes outnumber its good ones.  AIRPLANE!, AIRPLANE 2, and THE NAKED GUN
are all funnier films, and anyone who has seen and enjoyed them is bound
to be disappointed by HOT SHOTS.   I am particularly surprised at the
large number of good reviews that this film has received.</P>
<P>     The film's premise (an attempt to spoof TOP GUN) is weak,
considering that TOP GUN is filled with such stereotypical plots and
characters that it is something of a parody already.  Scenes from other
films, such as the hungry wolf from DANCES WITH WOLVES, are thrown in at
random, and are only occasionally funny.</P>
<P>     Charlie Sheen is reasonably good in the starring role as a pilot
who is called back to the Navy after being discharged for mental
incompetence.  He had already done some effective comedy (FERRIS
BUELLER'S DAY OFF), and this film should lead him to more work in that
area.  However, Sheen is not naturally funny like Leslie Nielsen or
Robin Williams--he strains to get the humorous lines out.
Unfortunately, there are few if any other decent performances.
Particularly weak is Lloyd Bridges, who is embarrassingly bad as a
senile old admiral, positioned throughout the film as a constant source
of stupid toilet jokes.</P>
<P>     Wait until this one appears in the video stores ... and then rent
it only if the store is out of AIRPLANE!</P>
<PRE>Rating:   **  (out of ****)</PRE>
