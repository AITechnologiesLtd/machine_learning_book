<PRE>                          THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS
                      A        film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  This        is a film with large virtues and
     large problems.  Many fine        actors are present, but        more for
     name value        than because they had something        special        to
     contribute.  But we do get        a feel for the sweep of        Chile's
     history this century.  DR.        ZHIVAGO        it isn't, but it is
     Zhivagesque. Rating: +1 (-4 to +4).  Unfortunately, much of
     what I would like to say about the        film would telegraph
     unexpected        plot twists, so        a spoiler section will follow the
     review.</PRE>
<PRE>     Bille August is best known        in this        country        for his        films PELLE THE
CONQUEROR and THE BEST INTENTIONS.  This time around he        has adapted and
directed THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS, based on Isabel Allende's novel.  The
film features a        powerhouse cast        of at least nine international stars, chosen
in what        often seems to be bizarre casting decisions.  The film is an uneasy
blend of Magical Realism and hard-edged        politics.  The story is        set in Chile
and is about two generations of        women in the Trueba family whose lives are
troubled in large part by Esteban Trueba (Jeremy Irons)        who rules the
family.         Clara is a young girl with psychic talents which bring        her family
tragedy.  Clara        remains        mute for twenty        years, but is once again willing to
talk when courted by the dashing Esteban (who earlier was engaged to her
sister).  Esteban made his fortune prospecting for gold.  Now he wishes        to
settle down on a big ranch and to run the world        around him with        a little
philandering on        the side.  The Indians who have        worked the land        can stay but
are treated like serfs.         This is the story of Esteban, his wife        Clara (Meryl
Streep), his sister Ferula (Glenn Close), and his daughter Blanca (Winona
Ryder).         We follow two generations, their lives        and loves and their
politics.</PRE>
<PRE>     Just a look at that cast tells you        that a lot of the budget of this
film is        going into getting major stars.         While there are more than enough
Hispanic actors        who are        finding        it hard        to get work, big names are being
cast as        Hispanics.  As far as I        am concerned that is only a minor pity if
the people cast        are really good        in their roles.         The sad fact is that the
high-priced talent is less and not more        effective than more realistic people
would have been.  Many of the big stars        might have been        believable if this
was the        first time we were seeing them but Winona Ryder        looks like someone
who would be more at home in California        than in        Chile.        Streep and Irons,
both very good actors, but they        sound like they        are respectively from the
U.S. and Britain.  Glenn Close somehow manages to be as        believable in her
role as        a native Chilean, but even the often under-rated Close does no
better than a native would have.  This is a German-Danish-Portuguese-
U.S. co-production, but        that does not mean they        could not have gotten an
Hispanic cast.        LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE is a Mexican film cast        with
inexpensive Mexican unknowns and every casting choice in that film is as
good or        better than the        choices        in this        film.</PRE>
<PRE>     The film does inherit the sweep of        the novel and that helps it overcome
some of        its problems to        get a +1 on the        -4 to +4 scale.</PRE>
<PRE>Spoiler:</PRE>
<PRE>     SPOILER: Some more        comments I wanted to make as mild spoilers.  The
device of having Blanca        narrate        the film makes it seem more personal, but at
the same time it destroys some of the suspense.</PRE>
<PRE>     Much of the last part of the plot seems contrived.         Every good deed
that Esteban has committed rewards him in the end and each bad deed ends up
costing        him more than he expects.  However, Ryder says that the        diaries
helped her understand how events were interconnected so        it leaves open the
possibility that she is        stressing the interconnections.</PRE>
<PRE>     Bille August has written and directed an adaptation of Isabel Allende's
novel, making a        film that has strong parallels to Bernardo Bertolucci
historical epics 1900 and THE LAST EMPEROR.  The similarities are so great,
in fact, that one could        almost consider        the three films        to be a        trilogy.
Each film starts in the        old world and a        vanished culture where the main
character is a man who has lord-like power and uses it to defend the old
order of things.  There        are signs of change around him but he confuses them
with corruption        of the old order.  Finally the wheel turns and it is the new
more liberal forces in power.  The character is        forced to realize that what
he saw as corruption was really        the force of reform.</PRE>
