<PRE>                                  SHADOWS AND FOG
                       A film review by Kenneth E. Mohnkern
                        Copyright 1992 Kenneth E. Mohnkern</PRE>
<P>     SHADOWS AND FOG is Woody Allen's new movie.  I think I need to say
that since I had no idea what I was in for until I was in the back seat
of the car on my way to the theater.  Even then my friends were kind
enough to say nothing more than "SHADOWS AND FOG is Woody Allen's new
movie."  There's something right about going into a theater with no
expectations, knowing nothing about the plot, letting it all unfold for
you as the filmmakers intended.</P>
<P>     I've always mildly enjoyed Woody's movies, but don't list them as
favorites.  His dramas are pretty well out of my experience, and his
comedies are goofy, but get chuckles from me -- not laughs.  I always
figured you had to be a New Yorker to appreciate his stuff.  </P>
<P>     [If you want to go into the theater without a clue, stop reading
now.  I won't include any real spoilers, though.  I won't get into the
plot.]</P>
<P>     But, geez -- I really liked SHADOWS AND FOG.  It was beautifully
shot in black and white, really showing off his talent for the visual.
The film takes place one dark, foggy night in an unnamed city at an
unnamed time in history, presumably in the late-19th century.  There's a
murderer roaming the streets, as are a vigilante group, prostitutes, and
circus performers.  It's a great bunch of characters.  </P>
<P>     And what a cast!  Kathy Bates, John Malkovich (as a clown worried
about his "art"), Madonna (ha!), Woody Allen, Mia Farrow, Lily Tomlin,
Jodie Foster, John Cusack (another great role for him), Wallace Shawn,
Fred Gwynn, Donald Pleasence, Julie Kavner (in a great role!)</P>
<P>     We see briefly what a good physical actor Woody is.  The scene
where he steals a glass from a table is priceless.  Anxious, seeing his
only chance to do it, fumbling around, trying not to draw attention to
himself -- classic!  And another where he's got a huge wooden hammer
overhead, ready to swing it ... hysterical.  They're basically
silent-era scenes.  Sure, he's no Buster Keaton or Charlie Chaplin, but
these days there aren't any Keatons or Chaplins.  Only Steve Martin and
Woody Allen, I guess.</P>
<P>     I have a feeling there were analogies to society and life as we
know it, but can't quite put the pieces together.  Was there
significance to the circus?  The killer in the night?  The politics
going on in the vigilante group?  Woody's ignorance of his part of the
plan?  It's the sort of movie that you're still thinking about the next
morning.  And there aren't many of those.  </P>
