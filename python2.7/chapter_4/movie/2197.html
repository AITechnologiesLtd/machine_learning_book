                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1993 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Jeremy Irons, John Lone.
Screenplay:  David Henry Hwang, based on his play.
Director:  David Cronenberg.</P>
<P>     I approached the film version of M. BUTTERFLY with something of a
"show me" attitude.  I'd had the good fortune to see a sensational
production of the play by Northern California's TheatreWorks company,
with an amazing lead performance by Mark Capri as Gallimard, and I felt
that any other version would have to be pretty good to impress me.  I
also questioned the choice of David Cronenberg, whose previous efforts
had all been horror films, as director.  It therefore comes as a
pleasant surprise that Cronenberg's M. BUTTERFLY maintains a real
faithfulness to the basic themes of David Henry Hwang's Tony
Award-winning play, although it loses a great deal from the absence of
the stage version's Brechtian devices.</P>
<P>     M. BUTTERFLY is based on the true story of French diplomat Bernard
Boursicot, here called Rene Gallimard.  Stationed in Beijing in 1964,
Gallimard (Jeremy Irons) is a petty bureaucrat responsible for
reviewing expense reports.  One evening, he attends an embassy function
for a performance of selections from Puccini's opera "Madama
Butterfly."  The featured vocalist is Song Liling, a mysterious figure
who intrigues Gallimard.  That intrigue soon leads to an affair,
despite a small detail of which Gallimard is apparently unaware:  Song
(John Lone) is a man.  Gaining confidence from his new love, Gallimard
is promoted to a position of importance in French intelligence.  He and
Song carry on their relationship for several years, until an
investigation forces him to know all there is to know about the spying
game.</P>
<P>     It's useless to argue that the story is implausible, based as it
is on a real event; M. BUTTERFLY is itself an attempt to explain how it
could have happened.  Hwang's conclusion is that the
Boursicot/Gallimard story is inextricably tied to the perception
Westerners hold of the East, that of a culture of subservience.
Consequently, they think of all Asians as feminized, making Gallimard's
assumption of Song's gender purely cultural.  Hwang and Cronenberg
convey that sense of Western sexual/political arrogance in lines which
draw knowing chuckles, such as Gallimard's assurance to his superior
that the Vietnamese would "submit to any show of strength" by the
Americans.  It's an interesting theme well-explored.</P>
<P>     Where I felt M. BUTTERFLY was less successful was in portraying
the complexities of Gallimard's character.  In the play, he speaks
directly to the audience, a device which allows for some ironic
observations of his state of mind.  The film's more conventional
narrative approach makes Gallimard less pathetic than he should be.
Lost also is the impression that before meeting Song, Gallimard is
timid and sexually inept; it is only after asserting dominance over his
"Butterfly" that he becomes a "real man."  Without this aspect of his
personality evident, his vulnerability to the deception doesn't make as
much sense.  There should be a clear sense that psychologically, he
*needs* Song to be a woman, and it's not quite there.</P>
<P>     Such an emphasis on Gallimard's psychology would also have gone
far toward making John Lone a credible choice as Song.  B. D. Wong, the
head biotechnician in JURASSIC PARK and the originator of Song on
Broadway, was once attached to the film, but was passed over when Lone
became available.  The choice was a mistake.  Lone's voice has an
eerie, detached quality which I liked for its mysterious allure, but
the fact is that he just looks too masculine, and an eight foot high
close-up doesn't exactly promote illusion.  Irons is a much better
choice as Gallimard.  He's great at showing Gallimard's cocky
Eurocentrist side, and I loved his oddly amused expression when he
first sees Song dressed as a man.  Once again, however, it was the
impotent Gallimard who disappeared, particularly in the too-brief look
at his other extra-marital affair, where what should have been disgust
instead becomes mere surprise.</P>
<P>     M. BUTTERFLY is a fascinating story, and its screen telling is
more than fair to the stage spirit.  I only wish Hwang had been allowed
to keep the focus on the internal.  It's a good film that could have
been a very good one.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 counts of espionage:  6.</PRE>
