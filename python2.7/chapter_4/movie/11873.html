<P>   The classic tale of a lost dog sold by a poor family, which
undertakes several tortuous journeys to return to them,
informs the greatest family film of all time, "Lassie Come
Home" (1943, Fred M. Wilcox, director).  The eponymous
collie was played by the remarkable Pal in a performance that
has never been surpassed by bird or beast.  The recent
"When the Cat's Away," Cedric Klapisch's buoyant Parisian
tale of a runaway feline, does not come close.  All of this
means that "Paulie" has some tough competition, but since
this is the conceivably the first full-length feature story about a
bird, it fills a niche and does so quite well.  "Paulie" has a lot
going for it: some special humor that might appeal to adults;
some fine animal photography (even granting that the scene
of the parrot in bold flight across some imposing country
scenery was shot in a wind tunnel and then superimposed
against the landscape); stellar acting by the title character
(granting here that it took fourteen Blue Crown Conures to fill
the bill); a smashing sound track; and a lesson in scruples
presented simply enough that the small fry who will make up
the major audience should catch the instruction in ethics.</P>
<P>   As Dr. Reingold (Bruce Davison), a research scientist
states, there is one big gap between us human beings and
our fellows in the animal kingdom: speech.  Animals can
speak but darned if they never learned English.  Paulie,
however, can make quite a dent in our understanding of those
who are further down in the food chain because this parrot
does not simply mimic; unlike most people, he can speak in
intelligent sentences.  It's no wonder that Dr. Reingold, seeing
a Nobel in his future, views a great opportunity in owning the
bird and that other folks see Paulie not as a creature with his
own integrity but as one who can enrich them as well.  As is
conventional in so many movies made principally for children,
the little ones perceive the feathered and four-legged
creations selflessly.</P>
<P>   The story opens as five-year-old Marie (Hallie Eisenberg), a
stutterer who is without friends because of her speech
impediment, is given a young bird by her family in the hope
that it can take their girl out of her shell.  When Marie climbs
on her roof with Paulie and suffers an almost tragic fall to the
ground, her father gives away the parrot to a pawn shop,
whose owner (Buddy Hackett) sees a talking bird only as an
aggravation.  Though Benny (Jay Mohr) sees him as a
potential assistant for his career as a petty thief, Paulie is
bought by the aging Ivy (Gena Rowlands), who is sympathetic
to Paulie's desire to be reunited with Marie and drives him
most of the way to Marie's new home in Los Angeles.  Before
arriving, Paulie is found by Ignacio (Cheech Marin), who uses
him for a dance act until he is acquired by Dr. Reingold, who
wants the bird to perform for a group of scientists.  The entire
story is told by Paulie to a janitor, Russian immigrant Misha
(Tony Shalhoub), who unknowingly is really listening to the
verbosity of Jay Mohr in the role of Paulie's voice.</P>
<P>   Well over one-third of American families own dogs, and so
presumably a movie about a dog ("Beethoven," "Shiloh" and
the like) would have a good chance of capturing a large,
youthful audience.  Relatively few families own parrots, so
that this one could be a tough sell at the box office.  More's
the pity, though, if a lack of familiarity with these lovely
animals would keep families away. "Paulie" is a touching tale
featuring some choice wisecracks actually spoken by
Saturday Night Live veteran Jay Mohr as Benny who, when
appearing with Paulie on the screen, is in fact talking to
himself!  When Benny's girl friend asks the parrot whether her
"diamond" is real, Paulie, who cannot lie, says, "I've seen shot
glasses cut better than that."  When Bennie drives Paulie in
his convertible to a scenic view of L.A., Paulie quips, "You're
not gonna kiss me, are you?"  </P>
<P>   There are some painful lessons that should come across to
those in the audience who are under the age twelve and
might be convinced more readily than adults that shearing
part of a bird's wings to prevent him from flying is just plain
wrong: "They were cutting me," Paulie says of the lab
technicians, "They were taking away the one thing that made
me different from them."  Paulie offers some excellent advice
to the small fry who may be too shy to get their feelings
across to those who love them, "Don't be afraid to speak up,"
he says, though ironically at times Paulie keeps quiet because
he insists that talking "gets you in trouble."</P>
<P>   Bruce Davison plays a nuanced role as a villain with more
than a trace of humanity, Tony Shalhoub a poignant guise as
a immigrant who assures Paulie "I'm Russian: I like long
stories," Gena Rowlands does a trenchant turn as a sensitive
lady who ultimately uses the bird as a seeing-eye companion,
and Trini Alvarado is the grown-up woman who has awaited
Paulie's return for years.  Given the merits of the production,
which is debut-directed by John Roberts from a script by
Laurie Craig, this bird deserves to fly.  Rated PG.  Running
Time: 92 minutes.  (C) 1998 Harvey
