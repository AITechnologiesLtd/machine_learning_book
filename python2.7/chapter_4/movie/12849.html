<P>   Without conflict we would have no comedy, no melodrama. 
You can't blame writers and directors of romantic comedy,
then, for putting two opposites together to see what they will
make of their relationship.  In Neil Simon's "California Suite,"
high-strung New Yorker Hannah Warren visits her laid-back
ex, Bill Warren in California, though nothing comes of the
meeting.  In Nicholas Evans's novel "The Horse Whisperers,"
high-strung New Yorker Anne MacLean invokes the skills of
laid-back Montanan Tom Becker.  In the movie version,
nothing much ultimately comes of that, either.  In Michael
Browning's "Six Days, Seven Nights" directed by Ivan
Reitman, high-power magazine editor Robin Monroe (Anne
Heche) requires the services of laid-back charter pilot Quinn
Harris (Harrison Ford).  Quinn has a bimbo dancer girl friend,
Angelica (Jacqueline Obradors) in French Polynesia and is
content with his life, while Robin has a new fiance, Frank
Martin (David Schwimmer) and likes her big-city job.  Quinn
and Robin appear as unlikely as Hannah and Bill and Tom
and Annie to make more permanent arrangements from their
association.</P>
<P>   "Six Days Seven Nights" is billed as a vacation that you
won't find in any travel brochure, though organizations like
Outward Bound might dispute this as would the creators of
Nicolas Van Orton's holiday in David Fincher's "The Game." 
What seems like a brief respite for Robin and Frank on a
resort island near Tahiti turns into a scare-and-affair break for
the newly engaged couple.  Frank and Robin are taking a
honeymoon in paradise BEFORE they marry.  The difference
is that both honeymoon with people other than their fiances.</P>
<P>   The story opens in a New York office of a Cosmopolitan-
style magazine called Dazzle, where Robin is an assistant
editor whose boy friend surprises her with a couple of tickets
to Polynesia. After arriving, they hire rugged, uncomplicated
charter pilot Quinn Harris to take them on a small hop to a
place not to far from Tahiti.  When Robin is begged by her
boss in New York to take a quick assignment in Tahiti, she
hires Quinn once again for the extra trip, reluctantly, since the
plane is a heap apparently left over from World War II and
Quinn is not too skillful at holding his liquor.  When an
unexpected storm downs the plane in a deserted cove just
short of Tahiti, Quinn and Robin must make do, living off the
land, while they await help that may never arrive.  Chief
among their hardships is a series of skirmishes they endure
with a small band of pirates equipped with Uzis and missiles,
while boyfriend Frank, who remains safely behind, is seduced
by Quinn's girlfriend, Angelica.</P>
<P>   The picture is the essential male fantasy: the handsome,
womanizing, man caught in the middle of nowhere with a
beautiful young and lively woman.  Though Robin goes
through the motions of ribbing Quinn for his inability to get her
to her destination, you can see that she has eyes for this guy
who is much older than her fiance but unlike him does not
wear a stick in his back.  Anne Hache may surprise gossip
columnists who have said she would not be able to play
romantic leads with a man.  Her chemistry with Harrison Ford
is powerful, occasionally sentimental, but chiefly of the merrily
teasing variety.  When the adorable Ms. Hache's eyes light up
under her closely-cropped locks, you may think of Lillian Gish
playing the ingenue Anna Moore in D.W. Griffith's "Way Down
East," though at heart she is every bit the urban sophisticate
with a witty line for every mishap.  "Aren't you one of those
guys they send out in the wilderness with a Q-tip and a
pocket knife and they build you a shopping mall?" she
heckles while Quinn tries to fix the plane.  Quinn replies, "I'm
the best pilot you'll ever see," but is trumped by Robin's "I've
flown with you twice and you crashed half the time."  When
Quinn acts to remove a snake that has crawled up Robin's
shorts, she is not displeased but warns, "Don't let me catch
you smiling."</P>
<P>   The scenes involving the keystone pirates are downright
silly and Mr. Ford is out of his element in his type of comedy. 
We're embarrassed to see him falling flat-out drunk in a bar
where he hits on Quinn, too blind to realize that she is not a
stranger but the woman who hired him that very day to fly her
to the island.  As a whole, the movie is too lightweight even
by summer standards, though Michael Chapman's camera
captures all the rugged beauty of the Hawaiian island of Kauai
(standing in for French Polynesia) and might lead many
theatergoers to change their vacation plans.  What's that
Aloha plane doing in Tahiti, anyway?
Rated PG-13.  Running time: 98 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten
