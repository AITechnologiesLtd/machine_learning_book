Susan Granger's review of "HIDEOUS KINKY" (Stratosphere Entertainment)</P>
<P>        For her follow-up film to "Titanic," Kate Winslet has chosen a
decidedly un-glamorous role in this modest British film, based on
Esther Freud semi-autobiographical novel about her own exotic
childhood experiences. Winslet plays a restless, penniless single
mother from London who takes her two bewildered young daughters - a
skeptical eight year-old and an enthusiastic six year-old - to
Marrakech in the early '70s in the wake of her divorce from an
unreliable British poet. Playing the precocious older daughter, Bella
Riza, is the actress who scores in this film, squirming over her
mother's selfish irresponsibility and shallow, bohemian pretentions as
the mother-daughter tension is sharply observed. Winslet's romance
with an acrobat/hustler (Said Taghmaoui, the French-Moroccan actor
from "La Haine") doesn't contribute much to the episodic story - and
the bizarre, unappealing title is derived from a funny-sounding word
game devised by the sisters whose fondest wish is to be "normal."
Screenwriter Billy MacKinnon and his brother, director Gillies
MacKinnon ("The Playboys"), have created a hybrid: part
travelogue/part nostalgic quest for metaphysical
salvation. Unfortunately, the characters - and John de Borman, the
cinematographer - spend too much time wandering aimlessly in the sun,
indulging in the pungent flavors of the time and place. On the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Hideous Kinky" is a pretty but parched 5 as
it slowly labors to re-capture the soul-searching hippie spirit.</P>
