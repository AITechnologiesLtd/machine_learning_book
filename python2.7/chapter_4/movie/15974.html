<PRE>Patch Adams
Rated `PG-13'
A Review By Ryan Davis</PRE>
<P>        The scene at the end of 1989's `Dead Poets Society,' when Robin
Williams' English students stand up on their desk and say, `Captain, My
Captain,' gets me every time. Unfortunately, the court room scene near the end
of Robin's newest film, `Patch Adams,' doesn't have anywhere near the same
impact.</P>
<P>        From the surface `Patch Adams' looks very promising. It's a story
about a not so young man, Patch Adams (Robin Williams), who finds meaning in
his life through helping sick people. When the film opens, we find Patch,
depressed and suicidal, checking himself into a mental hospital. In a few
scenes, strongly reminiscent of `One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest,' he ends up
helping the patients through their problems; and it's here that he finds how
much he loves working with people. So he checks himself out of the hospital,
and heads straight to medical school.</P>
<P>        Right from the start, Patch uses comedy to help make the patient more
comfortable. He continuously breaks medical tradition and makes the Dean of
the school angry. Shortly after joining medical school, he meets and falls in
love with Carin (Monica Potter). They, along with Patch's dork friend, Truman
(Daniel London), start a medical clinic for uninsured people. Once the Dean
catches wind of the clinic, he tells Patch he can't graduate and kicks him
out of school. Patch, like what any true American would do, takes the school
to court. It's here where the not so climatic court room battle takes place,
over whether or not Patch can become a real doctor.</P>
<P>        I have never seen a movie with some potential just completely blow
it. It seems more like a series of short sketches, rather than a full-length
movie. Considering it runs almost two hours, much too long for such a light
film, it could have flowed much smoother. Not to mention the fact of how
serious the film takes itself, and manages to cover all the cliches of bad
melodrama. Robin Williams saves the film from being abysmal with several
comic scenes that elevate the movie to entertaining and worthwhile levels. 
But those moments are rare and in the end `Patch Adams' is barely average.</P>
<PRE>Grade: C-</PRE>
