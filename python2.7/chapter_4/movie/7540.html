<P>QUIZ SHOW, an almost perfectly accurate true story, is based upon the
events of the popular television show of the mid-50's, "Twenty-One".  On
this trivial game show, contestants were placed in isolation booths and
then answered questions corresponding to a category of their choice, on
which they wagered an amount of points on.  The game went on until a
player reached twenty one points on felt they had earned enough points to
win.  But, after ratings began to fall when players were struggling to
break the zero mark, the producers decided to fix the game by giving the
answers to a contestant before the game began.  </P>
<P>QUIZ SHOW illustrates the true stories of two particular contestants,
Herbie Stempel and Charles Van Doren.  Stempel (John Turturro), a former
G.I. and your Jewish man raising a family.  Stempel has been the reigning
champion on "Twenty-One" for many weeks and has accumulated thousands of
dollars.  In his mind, he is the best thing on television and the people
love him.  Although, in the mind of the show's producers, Herbie Stempel
is getting old.  Dan Enright (David Paymer), in particular, feels that the
people are tired of seeing a "Jewish guy from Queens with bad teeth" and
that the kids need someone better to look up to.  Therefore, they
need to find another contestant whom would be a worthy role model
and the people will look up to and cheer to win.  Someone who can
defeat Stempel, even if they have to resort to cheating.  Enter Charles
Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), a well-educated Professor from a widely
recognized family.  Van Doren had decided to try out for the game show "Tic
Tac Dough" because his friends thought he would be good at that sort of
thing.  But when Albert Freedman (Hank Azaria), Enright's assistant, spots
Van Doren, the two decide that they have found their soon-to-be-ruler of
the "Twenty-One" kingdom.  Van Doren is not too keen on the idea of
receiving the answers ahead of time, so Enright tells Stempel that he is
going to give the wrong answer, on purpose, in order to lose the game.</P>
<P>After Stempel loses the "throne" to Van Doren, he starts to feel cheated
(which he should).  Meanwhile, on his own, Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow), a
Harvard law graduate, has decided to start an investigation on
"Twenty-One" to try and find out if there have been any wrongdoings.  His
investigation yields shocking results and leads to a trial for Enright and
the others involved.</P>
<P>QUIZ SHOW is an extremely well done movie, and Robert Redford's direction
is especially superb.  The performances turned in by John Turturro, Ralph
Fiennes, and Rob Morrow are very good, although it seems that Turturro
stands out more than any.  QUIZ SHOW is also very precise when it comes to
explicating the true events that inspired the film.  Definitely a film you
should not miss.</P>
