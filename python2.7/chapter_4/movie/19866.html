<P> The Thomas Crown Affair (1999) 2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Pierce
Brosnan and Rene Russo.</P>
<P> "The Thomas Crown Affair" is a fun, fluffy caper film. And it is fitting
that the movie is about theft, because Rene Russo steals this romantic
drama from nominal star Pierce Brosnan.</P>
<P> The film is a remake of a 1968 feature that starred Steve McQueen and Faye
Dunaway. The plot has been updated. In this version, multimillionaire
Thomas Crown steals valuable paintings instead of robbing banks.</P>
<P> And, as in the original, Russo is the top-notch insurance investigator who
is out to prove Crown is the master thief.</P>
<P> Much has changed in 30 years. The sexual tension that existed between
McQueen and Dunaway could not be consummated on screen as it is here.</P>
<P> "The Thomas Crown Affair" is a movie about trust. As Crown's
blunt-speaking shrink (Dunaway in a sparkling but small part) continually
hammers at him, he is a man afraid to trust, to let others into his life.</P>
<P> The crux of this movie lies in the ability of Brosnan's Crown and Russo's
Catherine Banning to learn to trust each other, even as they play their
cat-and-mouse game.</P>
<P> Russo is so strong, so sexy - and she is not shy about showing her
attributes - so smart that she overpowers whoever she is on screen with,
especially Brosnan. As an actor, he is one of those men who relies more on
his looks - a raised eyebrow, a set jaw - than his thespian abilities to
carry a role.</P>
<P> That is why he is so good as James Bond. Brosnan looks good in a tux or
three-piece suit, holding a drink in his hand and making quips. He just
can't emote worth a damn.</P>
<P> And that is the movie's sore point, because Russo is so strong, so
confident, it is difficult to understand what she sees in the almost-wooden
Crown.</P>
<P> Brosnan's Crown steals the paintings not for profit, but for the fun of it
- for kicks. It's a sign that he is alive. It keeps him alert, functioning.</P>
<P> He knows that she knows that he stole the painting and she knows that he
knows she knows he is the thief. But none of that matters. It is the sexual
sparks between these two protagonists that propel this movie. You are more
interested in them than in the mechanics of the theft and the investigation
that follows.</P>
<P> "The Thomas Crown Affair" is a pleasant experience, like eating out at a
fine middle-class restaurant. It's nothing special, but it is satisfying.</P>
