<PRE>The Patriot </PRE>
<P>Mel Gibson stars in a really long, epic drama about a man who leads a 
revolution against the evil British
empire. A man who's a great fighter and leader but whose family life has been 
hell and is ready to die for
his beliefs. </P>
<P>No, I didn't copy that line from a review of "Braveheart," that's an accurate 
plot description to the latest
wannabe blockbuster from Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin - the guys behind 
"Independence Day" and
"Godzilla." This film also tries to appeal to our patriotism with the big 
common enemy being the British in
the late 18th century during the American Revolution. It doesn't pay off very 
well here because the
screenplay langer on and on about Gibson's family life and the depressing 
hardships they must endure due
to the war. </P>
<P>There's a lot of "Gone With The Wind"-like melodrama combined with some 
"Braveheart"-like battle scenes
but neither are nearly as good. More concentration of the Americans' overall 
strategy is needed to clarify
the screenplay and the human drama is laid on too thick. This is one of those 
films designed to kiss-up to
the Academy (not unlike "Gladiator") that leaves us little guys out in the 
cold... sort of. One more cut and
this could have been a great flick, this cut is just all right. </P>
<PRE>GRADE: B- </PRE>
