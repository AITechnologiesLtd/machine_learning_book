<P>>From time to time I think about writing a novel based on my
experiences in the American Trotskyist movement. I have never followed
through on this project because deep down I realize that the beliefs
of the people in this movement were too different from those of
ordinary Americans. How could I possibly convey the reality of
revolutionary politics to people who view politics as nothing more
than what they do on election day?</P>
<P>The makers of "Four Days in September" faced a similar problem. How
could they make a film based on the characters and events depicted in
Fernando Gabeira's book "O que é isso, companheiro" (What's Up
Comrade?) and still draw an audience? Gabeira was a member of a
Brazilian terrorist cell that kidnapped the American Ambassador
Charles Elrick in September, 1969. They sought to protest the military
dictatorship that had just seized power, and win freedom for
imprisoned comrades.</P>
<P>Director Bruno Barreto, best known for his "Dona Flor and Her Two
Husbands," simply decided to dump the politics to make the film
palatable. "I did not make a film about politics but about human
beings. I did not make a film about ideas, but about the fears,
desires and tensions involved in a specific episode. Besides, no one
would be able to stand to listen to the actual way the terrorists
spoke at the time."</P>
<P>Without politics, the film becomes a banal crime melodrama. Except for
the occasional rhetorical flourish about the "Revolution," the
characters mainly discuss the technical details of the kidnapping. To
sustain the audience's interest, Barreto emphasizes human
relationships that have little to do with politics. There is a budding
romance between Maria [Fernanda Torres], the ringleader, and Gabeira
[Pedro Cardoso]. A filial bond develops between Gabeira and Elrick
[Alan Arkin] who turns out to be a liberal opposed to the war in
Vietnam and the military dictatorship in Brazil. A key scene shows
Gabeira allowing Elrick to view him with his mask off, thereby
revealing his humanity.</P>
<P>Gabeira develops a crush on  Maria when he is first sworn into the
terrorist cell. During the ceremony, she harangues the young recruits.
She assigns them each a nom de guerre: Fernando Gabeira then becomes
"Paulo." Along with their real names, they must leave behind all
normal human feelings that they had in their previous life. This scene
evokes the witch-hunt iconography of potboilers like the 1951 classic
"I Was A Communist For the FBI." These propaganda pieces inevitably
include a fanatical but beautiful female Communist cell leader who
makes speeches about how love is a bourgeois diversion.</P>
<P>In the production notes, Fernanda Torres is contemptuous of the
character she plays. She says, "Maria was sort of a 'sergeant' in the
group, and, to my mind, the least credible character in the script. I
wasn't alive when the kidnapping took place so I can't be sure if
militant political women really behaved like that." One can only
wonder why Torres accepted the role if she has so little
identification with the character and shows so little interest in
finding out about what made such a character tick. Perhaps there is no
tradition of method acting in Brazil. According to the principles
method acting, character portrayal grows out the totality of the
character's social relations. The actor must try to go beyond the
dimensions of the script and immerse him or herself in the social
milieu of the character. This might mean driving a cab if the
character is a cabdriver. Of course, such background research would
have done little to add depth to a character whose dialog consists
mainly of worries over whether the kidnapping will be carried out
successfully, punctuated by tone-deaf "radical" rhetoric.</P>
<P>After a major bank robbery, Maria's gang decides to kidnap the
American Ambassador. Such an operation requires outside assistance so
they call in Toledo [Nelson Dantas] and Jonas [Matheus Nachtegaele],
two veterans of the terrorist movement. Toledo is a man in his sixties
who fought in the Spanish Civil War, while Jonas is a young
working-class militant who is even more unsmiling and case-hardened
than Maria herself. Jonas, who takes over the operation, warns the
rest of the group that he will shoot anybody who disobeys his orders.
For the remainder of the film, Toledo and Jonas are absorbed in the
technical details of the kidnapping and we never discover who they
really are or what they believe.</P>
<P>In a letter to his wife, Elrick confesses his inability to understand
the fanaticism of Jonas. It never would have occurred to Leopoldo
Serran, the screenwriter, to fill in some background on such a
character. Like the rest of the people associated with the project, he
was hostile to leftist politics. He kept  resisting Barreto's
invitation to write a script based on Gabeira's memoir. "I refused
several times, because I disagreed with many of the leftist principles
and practices, and I could not agree to do anything complimentary or
biased."</P>
<P>Perhaps Serran might have fleshed out such a character by studying the
life of one of Brazil's most famous workers, Lula of the Workers
Party. He was the youngest of 8 children born to subsistence farmers.
In 1956, the family moved to Sao Paulo, where they dwelled in one room
at the back of a bar and shared the bathroom with bar customers. Lula,
unlike the terrorists of the 1969 generation, became the leader of a
mass social movement. The same sense of indignation that committed him
to peaceful change, however, must have fueled Jonas. It would have
made for a much richer film if Jonas spoke openly about the
circumstances that led him to such extremist politics.</P>
<P>Toledo, admittedly a secondary character, only speaks about his doubts
over the success of the kidnapping. It would have been interesting to
find out something about the life of a character old enough to be a
grandfather, who has decided to take such drastic measures. (It is
rather dubious that a Spanish Civil War veteran would have ever joined
a terrorist plot, since these activists had an orientation to mass
action. We would be asking too much from a film that had so little
interest in politics to try to explain this anomaly)</P>
<P>Serran's enthusiasm is not for characters like these with their
obnoxious left-wing politics. He invests all of his power as a
playwright into the character of Henrique [Marco Ricca], the cop in
charge of capturing the kidnappers. Henrique feels torn between duty
and revulsion over the torture he carries out against revolutionaries
in the basement of his police station as part of his job. For Serran,
there is a sexual aspect to torture which is reflected in the script.
Henrique mentions to his partner that a political prisoner has fallen
in love with and married one Pecanha, a cop who tortured her. That
Serran would even consider such an event as within the realm of
possibility shows how detached he is from the reality of police
repression. One can only hope that he never accepts an assignment to
write a screenplay based on Tomas Borge's memoir. Somoza's torturers
beat this Sandinista leader in the testicles repeatedly during his
imprisonment until he lost his manhood.</P>
<P>Ultimately "Four Days in September" is repression without violence. It
represses the real beliefs and the real motivations of the terrorist
band, as much as a gag over the mouth of a prisoner does. As difficult
as it would have been to translate the lives of terrorists into a
commercially viable film, a production company with some sympathy for
the left should have made the attempt. The director, the screenwriter
and the actors are all complicit in covering up the history of the
desperate and marginal Brazilian urban underground. The key to an
authentic and dramatically convincing film would have been in
uncovering the history of each character. Without such histories, the
overall history of the times remains a mystery.</P>
