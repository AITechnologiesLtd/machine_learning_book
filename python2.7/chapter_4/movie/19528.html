<PRE>Batman and Robin (1997)
STARRING: Arnold Schwarzenegger, George Clooney, Uma Thurman,
         Chris O'Donnell, Alicia Silverstone
DIRECTOR: Joel Schumacher
WRITER: Akiva Goldsman
RATED: PG-13
RELEASED: 1997</PRE>
<P>It's always painful to witness the degradation of someone you dearly
love... to watch, helpless, as a once strong family member succumbs to
illness or the ravages of old age. Gradually the strength and
personality traits that you remember so fondly seep away, leaving only
a shell of the person's former self. They may still breathe, and
perhaps even move around from time to time, but it's obvious that
their spark is gone. Watching it happen to my grandfather was
difficult enough; now we get to see the same thing happen to the
Batman series. </P>
<P>I was a big fan of the dark vision Tim Burton brought to the first two
Caped Crusader outings. Gotham actually breathed on the silver screen;
it was sinister and full of secrets. Michael Keaton didn't so much
PLAY Batman as become him. The cherry on top was the great
characterization, far more in keeping with Bob Kane's original comic
books than the campy sixties television show. Gone were the WHAPS! and
POWS! of Adam West, replaced with great action sequences and an
intense score from composer extrordinaire Danny Elfman. I even went so
far as to buy one of those goofy T-shirts with the bat logo emblazoned
on it. (Yes, that's right... I was one of THOSE guys.) </P>
<P>Situations beyond my control prevented me from seeing the third film
(Batman Forever), helmed by director Joel Schumacher and starring Val
Kilmer in the title role, but when the fourth installment appeared in
theaters I was more than game. Another trip to Gotham, with the lovely
and talented Uma Thurman to boot? How could I possibly resist? Ho boy.
How our naivete' mocks us. </P>
<P>Batman and Robin starts off with an obligatory action sequence, in
which Batman (George Clooney) and his increasingly annoying sidekick
Robin (Chris O'Donnell) attempt to foil Mr. Freeze (Arnold
Schwarzenegger) in a diamond robbery. In an interesting interpretation
of physics, Freeze launches our heroes high into the atmosphere in
some sort of rocket-thingy whose purpose is never explained. Batman
urgently tells Robin that they must stop the rocket, because it will
soon explode and turn Gotham into a huge crater. Then, in an amazingly
bold feat of self-contradiction, B&R set the rocket to self-destruct.
How do they escape? Simple. They skateboard back down through the
atmosphere to Gotham. Yes, you read that right. Skateboard. Through
the air. Back down to Gotham. Read it again so your brain absorbs the
absurdity of the situation. Then witness how B&R boldly blow up the
rocket mere moments after explaining the importance of not letting it
explode. </P>
<P>Next we're off to the Amazon jungle to enjoy the cliched ramblings of
a Dr. Clayton Forrester look-alike as he attempts to turn a 98-pound
weakling into a sumo wrestler via some sort of venom-juice. He is of
course successful, and all goes well until Dr. Unattractive (Uma
Thurman) uncovers the secret plot. The mad scientist isn't happy, and
murders her to emphasize this fact. She rewards him by coming back to
life as a sexy supervillain and killing him with a poison kiss. Lucky
guy: not only does he get to smooch one of the most beautiful women
currently working in the movie industry, but he gets to exit the film
very early to boot. </P>
<P>Back at Wayne Manor, Bruce Wayne's aged butler Alfred gets a lovely
surprise on the doorstep: Alicia Silverstone, who plays his British
niece, has come for an unannounced visit and apparently left her
accent at home. They fondle each other for a bit in one of the most
disturbing, yet not actually dirty, displays of affection ever
captured on film. Robin becomes infatuated with her, and follows her
one night when she steals a motorcycle to go racing. She of course
gets in trouble and he saves her, because, after all, she's only a
woman. </P>
<P>In one of my favorite scenes, Robin and the future Batgirl find
themselves dangling off a bridge. Robin has somehow managed to wrap
his foot around a metal bar, which assumedly prevents him from falling
off the bridge into the rushing water below. Visualize with me now: we
have our wormy hero, hanging off the bridge by one foot. He is holding
on to Alicia Silverstone. That's two people, dangling precariously by
one foot. Then, we cut to... the two of them safely back at Wayne
Manor. No explanation whatsoever. To quote Lenny from The Simpsons:
"We won't bore you with the details of our miraculous escape." </P>
<P>It gets worse. In an attempt to assumedly add a comic-book feel to the
film, the director has inserted cartoon sound effects into the fight
scenes. For example, when one of the evil henchmen falls down a
staircase, we hear a sound similar to Wile E. Coyote plummeting off a
cliff. Whether this was supposed to inspire laughter is unknown. It
did get a reaction from me, though I doubt very much it was the one
the director wanted. </P>
<P>In the most vomitous feel-good ending of the summer, Mr. Freeze helps
Batman cure Alfred of a crippling disease. It just so happens that
Freeze is the world's leading expert on this particular illness.
That's pushing believability as it is... but would you believe Freeze
just happens to carry the cure around with him at all times? My, isn't
that convenient. </P>
<P>Next, stir in a lousy soundtrack and lots of people flying around on
wires that are almost invisible during the fight scenes. Add a dash of
some of the most poorly-handled special effects of the summer,
sprinkled in with some gratingly bad puns courtesy of screenwriter
Akiva Goldsman. Is the bile rising yet? </P>
<P>Arnold's acting has all the depth and range I've come to expect from
his post-Conan movies, which is to say, none at all. His films,
however, are more about attitude than acting, and I can't really hold
his performance against him. In a movie like The Running Man, where
the story is strong enough to let me ignore his terrible line-reads,
it's not a problem... but in Batman and Robin, it's simply one more
thing to bristle at. It doesn't help that most of his dialogue
consists of groanably bad puns, either. And not bad in a fun kind of
way; just really awful. </P>
<P>Alicia Silverstone is fine in her role, but the part is so poorly
written that it could do her professional reputation more harm than
good. Her character alternates between strong and fragile, determined
and waffling. Poor Alicia; I know she tried hard, and I don't fault
her. Same with Uma and Chris O'Donnell; no problems with them
personally, except they should've had the will-power to turn down a
script this bad. </P>
<P>This movie also attempts to set the Women's Rights movement back
thirty years. Every woman is portrayed very badly, from the aforemen-
tioned Alicia Silverstone to Bruce Wayne's marriage-hungry girlfriend
(Elle MacPherson). And Uma? Well, Batgirl comments on Uma's character:
"People like you give women a bad name!" True enough. </P>
<P>If the movie has one good thing, it's George Clooney. Many folks are
in strong disagreement with me, but I thought his performance as
Batman was at least as strong as Keaton's. I don't watch TV, so I've
never seen whatever show he's on (E.R., maybe?), but I liked him here.
Unfortunately, no matter how talented Clooney may be as an actor, he
can't carry a film when the script has him doing nothing more than
standing around, staring, and occasionally barking such helpful lines
as "Let's go!" and "That was close!" But despite all that, Clooney was
surprisingly likeable... which says quite a bit about his screen
presence. </P>
<P>One of the few things the film gets right is the depiction of Gotham
itself. Like Burton, Schumacher knows how to create memorable images
of a city caught in the struggle of good and evil. Some of the scenes
of frozen city streets (courtesy of Mr. Freeze) are particularly
well-done. Indeed, the lighting, costumes and sets are all lovely...
but a few pretty pictures aren't enough to save this clunker. </P>
<P>In conclusion: There are worse movies in existence, but it still hurts
to encounter a film this far off the mark. With a better script, this
could've been the ultimate Batman extravaganza; instead, one is left
with what could generously be called a mediocre film. Better luck next
time, Mr. Schumacher. We'll be waiting... same bat time, same bat
channel. </P>

<P>"The one good thing about the [life-size sticker of
 Jar Jar Binks on the door of Taco Bell] is you can
 pretty convincingly throw the SOB a roundhouse punch.
 I found it satisfying."   --Renard A. Dellafave</P>
