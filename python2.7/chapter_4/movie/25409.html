"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Here^Òs another textbook example of a film^Òs preview giving away too much
of its plot.  What Lies Beneath is a full three-quarters over before you
get to the content revealed in the trailer.  Fortunately, it doesn^Òt
much matter ^Ö Beneath is a taut psychological thriller that would make
Hitchcock proud.  In fact, it could do for bathtubs what Hitch^Òs Psycho
did for showers.</P>
<P>Beneath features Harrison Ford (Random Hearts) and Michelle Pfeiffer
(The Story of Us), two stars with box office clout fading faster than
the Baltimore Orioles' chance at a playoff berth.  They play Dr. Norman
and Claire Spencer, a genetic biologist and an ex-concert cellist,
respectively.  They live in a picturesque waterfront Vermont home that
was formerly owned by Norman^Òs recently deceased father.</P>
<P>While Norman is completely consumed by his work, Claire stays at home
and begins to experience strange and spooky stuff in their new house.
It^Òs your typical poltergeist fare ^Ö doors opening on their own,
pictures crashing to the floor ^Ö but nobody^Òs sure if it^Òs just Claire
suffering from Empty Nest Syndrome (her only daughter just left for
college) or if she^Òs really experiencing some type of otherworldly
force.  And if Claire is being haunted by an apparition, whose ghost is
it?  Norman^Òs dead father or perhaps the Spencers' new neighbor, who
Claire believes was murdered?  In an homage to Hitchcock^Òs Rear Window,
Claire thinks she sees her body being removed from the house one night
in the pouring rain.  Like I said, if you^Òve seen the trailer, you
already know the answer.</P>
<P>Claire also seems to be suffering from selective amnesia, forgetting
important events that happened in her life, especially those surrounding
a social event where Norman was awarded a Chair at a prestigious
University.  The whole role kind of reminded me of Emma Thompson in
Kenneth Branagh^Òs wonderful Dead Again.  Claire has to piece her own
life back together with virtually no help from her unsympathetic
husband, who seems to only care that her kookiness is inconveniencing
his career.</P>
<P>There are about a dozen jump-out-of-your-skin moments in Beneath.  You
can see most of them coming, but they^Òre so well done that it doesn^Òt
matter.  The ending is very maddening and takes so long to develop
(about thirty minutes) that people at my screening nearly became
physically ill.  I can^Òt ever recall being at a film before and hearing
a group of men shouting out loud in fear or a woman shrieking at the top
of her lungs. Beneath is a terrific popcorn thriller that plays better
than The Sixth Sense and its sucker-punch ending.  Just don^Òt eat too
much popcorn.</P>
<P>Pfeiffer gives one of her best performances ever, but Ford has just
turned into a really bad actor.  He^Òs becoming more and more like
Frankenstein with each film he makes.  I^Òm not sure if he^Òs actually
wooden or just grumpy.  Even Beneath^Òs tagline could be interpreted as a
poke at the fifty-eight-year-old actor ^Ö ^ÓHe was the perfect husband
until his one mistake followed them home.^Ô  What was it?  Sabrina?  Six
Days, Seven Nights?  Random Hearts?  It doesn^Òt matter ^Ö when Ford takes
off his shirt, studio executives roll around in money like Demi Moore in
Indecent Proposal.</P>
<P>Director Robert Zemeckis (Contact) fills Beneath with a bunch of
technically dazzling long shots, some of which left me scratching my
head and wanting to see the film again.  He^Òs one of the better
mainstream directors out there, and the fact that Zemeckis and crew are
able to sustain such a level of sheer terror for the last thirty minutes
is a real testament to the director and the script, which was written by
Clark Gregg.  Beneath is Gregg^Òs debut screenplay, but he^Òs appeared in
a myriad of films with amazing scripts (Magnolia, The Usual Suspects,
The Spanish Prisoner) and was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award
last year for his performance in The Adventures of Sebastian Cole.</P>
<P>Zemeckis, who won an Oscar for Forrest Gump, reassembled his top-notch
crew for Beneath (namely, editor Arthur Schmidt, cinematographer Don
Burgess, score-meister Alan Silvestri and production designer Rick
Carter ^Ö all Oscar nominees for Gump).  They do a fantastic job of
making a beautiful lakefront home seem warm, cozy and inviting, as well
as creepy, ominous and terrifying.  Beneath is the first of two
potential blockbusters helmed by Zemeckis this year - Cast Away, which
re-teams the director with Gump star Tom Hanks, is set to be released
this Christmas.</P>
<P>2:08 - PG-13 for terror/violence, sexual content and mild adult language</P>
