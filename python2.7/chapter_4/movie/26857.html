<P>_Charlie's_Angels_ (PG-13) ** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>It's easy to dismiss _Charlie's_Angels_ as mindless trash--but to do so
is to not understand the joke.  Make no mistake, this big screen revamp
of the small screen "jiggle" action-adventure series _is_ every bit the
slab of cinematic junk food it appears to be; the twist is that director
McG, producer-star Drew Barrymore, and co-stars Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu
set out to make it that way.  That said, getting the joke does not
necessarily entail complete enjoyment of the picture, which grows equal
parts fun and frustrating.</P>
<P>_Charlie's_Angels_ is a high-energy production, and it's impossible to
not get occasionally caught up in the infectious atmosphere of
over-the-top action-adventure and self-aware, campy humor.  The bouncy
tone is set by the curtain-raising action sequence, which is as
preposterously exciting as any Bond opener; and its terrific main titles,
which are a wonderfully cheesy homage to the original Aaron Spelling TV
series (and the rest of its action ilk in the '70s).  Called on to
provide the charm to carry the film the rest of the way are Diaz,
Barrymore, and Liu as Natalie, Dylan, and Alex, respectively--"an elite
crimefighting group" in the employ of the never-seen but always-heard
millionaire Charlie (once again voiced by John Forsythe).</P>
<P>Alas, if only high spirits and the right attitude were enough to make a
feature film.  There is the matter of a little thing called a script, and
the one by a reported 17 writers (the only ones receiving screen credit
are Ryan Rowe, Ed Solomon, and John August) feels as cobbled together as
the crew that created it.  The Angels, with Charlie's bumbling go-between
Bosley (Bill Murray, sadly wasted) by their side as usual, are hired to
solve the kidnapping of a computer tycoon (Sam Rockwell); its rather
speedy resolution opens up a set of unforeseen problems.  That, in a
nutshell, is _Charlie's_Angels_' story.</P>
<P>But it's not what the film is _about_.  That designation goes to the
assorted set pieces hung onto the clothesline of plot to either wring
laughs from the audience or viscerally excite them.  Given that the three
leads all have experience in comedy and are action neophytes, it's
surprising that _Charlie's_Angels_ is more successful in the latter area.
 For this, the trio and especially McG owe a large debt to fight
choreographer Yuen Cheung-Yan (brother of _Matrix_ and
_Crouching_Tiger,_Hidden_Dragon_ action maestro Yuen Woo-Ping).  The Hong
Kong brand of wire-enhanced martial arts (a major deviation from the TV
series, for staunch gun opposer Barrymore nixed the use of any firearms
in the film) works especially well in the over-the-top context, and the
stars are all game--in particular Diaz, who is given a large share of
non-wire fight scenes and more than holds her own.</P>
<P>Then again, Diaz is the clear standout in all areas of the film. 
Barrymore and Liu clearly enjoy themselves and amply fill the sexiness
requirement, but only Diaz is given much of anything to do.  Her Natalie,
a hopeless dork with ridiculous delusions of coolness, is the only Angel
that develops into a real character (all we glean from the others: Alex
is brainy; Dylan is... well, she looks good, doesn't she?).  Her comic
scenes, especially those with Luke Wilson (as the requisite love
interest), are the most memorable in the film.</P>
<P>In fact, Diaz's comic scenes are the only ones that fully work, which
points up the film's key problem: not knowing when to stop with the
comedy.  Her gags are extreme, but they don't push too far; the same
can't be said for a lot of others.  For example, a great sight gag
involving Alex's boyfriend's (Matt LeBlanc) bullet-riddled trailer home
that's just outlandish enough is ruined by a needless extra step.  I can
understand McG and the army of scribes' perceived need to go all out, but
a bit of moderation would have gone a longer way in a film that's already
outrageous by basic concept alone.</P>
<P>So with the smiles the film provide come about as many groans,
eventually overtaking the latter as it wears on.  The joke behind
_Charlie's_Angels_ is indeed an amusing one, but it simply grows old more
quickly than it should.</P>
