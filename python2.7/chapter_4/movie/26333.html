TOMBSTONE (1993)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>In the early 1990s Hollywood saw renaissance of western,
with many of films exploring the dark side of the Old West
and thus serving "politically correct" agenda by painting
revisionist picture of American history. In such
circumstances even the gunfight at O.K. Corral had their
turn, despite the fact that this event had inspired plenty
of filmmakers in previous decades. In 1993/1994, less than a
year, Hollywood major studios produced not one but two films
that dealt with Wyatt Earp. First of them was TOMBSTONE,
directed by George Pal Cosmatos.</P>
<P>The film begins in Tombstone, Arizona in early 1880s. Wyatt
Earp (played by Kurt Russell) is legendary sheriff of Dodge
City who retired from law enforcement in order to lead more
peaceful and profitable life. Wyatt and his two brothers -
Virgil (played by Sam Elliott) and Morgan (played by Bill
Paxton) - arrive in Tombstone where they soon come into
conflict with "Cowboys", gang of local thugs and cattle
thieves led by Curly Bill Brosis (played by Powers Boothe),
Johnny Ringo (played by Michael Biehn) and Ike Clanton
(played by Stephen Lang). As the tensions between Earp and
"Cowboys" rise, Wyatt meets his old friend, gambler and
gunslinger Doc Holliday (played by Val Kilmer). Holliday's
skills would become quite handy when the conflict erupts
into gunfight at O.K. Corral.</P>
<P>Kevin Jarre, original scriptwriter and director of
TOMBSTONE, got himself fired before the end of the shooting,
and producers gave the project into the hands of George Pal
Cosmatos. This didn't help the reputation of the movie,
because Cosmatos' name is usually associated with films that
feature large amounts of action scenes and hardly anything
else. Therefore, with Cosmatos in charge, all attempts to
accurately recreate historical events in Tombstone 1881 were
thrown by the window. Cosmatos was interested for
spectacular action scenes and hardly anything else and the
pace of film reflects his desire to quickly wrap up the
boring stuff like character development or background of the
conflict. Additional problem for the film is large number of
characters and actors, many of them in honorary cameos
(including Robert Mitchum as narrator) - Cosmatos simply
doesn't have the time to deal with them. Many of them appear
for a scene or two, especially Earp's women (with the
exception of Josephine Marcus, played by Dana Delany).</P>
<P>However, even disorganised mess of a movie called TOMBSTONE
can redeem itself with few bright moments. First of all,
since Cosmatos can't work on character development he simply
portrays Clantons and their gang as dangerous psychopathic
killers from the beginning, thus allowing Biehn, Lang and
Boothe to give amusingly cartoonish portrayals of villains.
Then, since the filmmakers abandoned any attempt to explain
Earp/Clanton conflict by presenting social, economic and
political conditions of early 1880s Arizona, their
black/white characterisation resulted in creative approach
to history, which might be seen as fun. For example,
narration explicitly names "Cowboys" as the first form of
organised crime in USA and, afterwards, costumes (which is
together with scenery and props painstakingly recreated from
actual history) and facial hygiene indicate their alignment,
in sharp contrast with "civilised", squeaky- clean Earps.
Later in the film, growing intensity of the conflict is
illustrated with some laughably trite phrases, but nothing
can match campiness of the scene in which Doc Holliday and
Johnny Ringo exchange insults in Latin.</P>
<P>Apart from campiness, TOMBSTONE is rescued with truly superb
acting. While Kurt Russell plays very believable Wyatt and
Sam Elliott still has presence of real westerner in the role
of his older brother, poor Bill Paxton simply can't overcome
his image of fall guy in action films. But the true marvel
of this film is Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday, who gives not
only powerful but also very original portrayal of the
terminally ill gunslinger - his Holliday is not only refined
intellectual, but also a romantic. Kilmer's role in this
film is one of the best in his career. Other actors, many of
them quite fine, only briefly appear, with most of their
roles left on the cutting floor. However, despite many flaws
and plenty of missed opportunities, TOMBSTONE could still be
recommended for all western fans, at least those who want
good old traditional stories about good and evil in these
cynical revisionist times.</P>
