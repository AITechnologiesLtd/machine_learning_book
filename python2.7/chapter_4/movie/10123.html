<P> __________________________________________________________</P>
<P>  The central themes of "Sick: The Life and Death of Bob Flanagan,
Supermasochist" are pain and love, and its subsequent effect on a person's
life. Its protagonist, Bob Flanagan, who died at the age of 52, suffered from
cystic fibrosis, a mortal disease which debilitates the lungs by saturating
them with thick coats of mucus, preventing him from normal breathing. </P>
<P> The movie is about much more than recouperating ( or attempting to ) from
this disease. </P>
<P> An audacious, fabulously triumphant docudrama, "Sick" chronicles the life of
Flanagan and his vicious, unthinkable acts of sadomasochism conducted with his
mistress of 15 years, Sheree Rose, who amazingly provided much of the footage
for the film. </P>
<P> Flanagan's idelogy crosses the realms of rebelliousness and becomes
transcendental, similar to Terry Zwigoff's brilliant 1994 "Crumb", which also
explored the dysfunction of an artist by painting not a sympathetic portrait,
but a realistic one. Both Crumb and Flanagan revelled in their defects. But
Flanagan was not only a man content on enduring the pain via lungs, he
inflicted acts of pain on himself at a very young age, courageously defying
God ( he was an Irish Catholic )
and turning his body into a work of art, which he unraveled in museums and
lectures.</P>
<P> Behold these works of physical art. Among them is a metal ball inserted
inside his anus, and, --the most disturbing scene of the decade--, nailing his
penis to a board. </P>
<P> Flanagan was a man of great intelligence, wit and humor, as well as adopting
a sense of candidness scarcely seen in modern filmmaking. Not only did he
approach his disease with humor, peforming burlesque acts in front of an
audience, he was also revitalized by his approachment. Most with cystic
fibrosis do not make it past their earlier  twenties ( there's also a subplot
involving a female devotee who knew death was awaiting her. )</P>
<P> But the most outstanding thing about "Sick" is Flanagan's relationship with
Sheree. Brimming with honesty, sensual stimulation and unapologetically sad
moments of pain, their powerful bond lifts "Sick" into a rare cinematic high,
where we forget we are in an auditorium and become a part of these people.</P>
<P> The last scene, where we see the hero murmuring the last words to his wife in
a hospital bed, as he struggles for his last moments of life, is raw, tender,
hideous. It goes a step beyond cinematic intimacy.</P>
