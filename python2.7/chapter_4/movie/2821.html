<P>     Never has chess been a more apt metaphor for life than in Boaz
Yakin's feature debut, FRESH.  Like Lawrence Fishburne in SEARCHING FOR
BOBBY FISCHER, Samuel L. Jackson sits in New York's Washington Square
playing speed chess and dispensing valuable lessons about life.  (As a
trivia note, the chess advisor for this film was Bruce Pandolfini,
whose real-life character was portrayed by Ben Kingsley in SEARCHING
FOR BOBBY FISCHER.) His son Michael (played with astonishing ability by
Sean Nelson) eats up those lessons and promptly applies them to a far
more dangerous game than the one in the park.</P>
<P>     Michael, nicknamed Fresh by the drug lords who use him as a
runner, has had the grisly misfortune of watching two children gunned
down in cold blood.  He knows the killer, and decides that if he
orchestrates his revenge cleverly, he may be able to get both himself
and his sister Nichole (N'Bushe Wright, from ZEBRAHEAD) out of the
cycle of poverty and drugs they're trapped in.  To succeed, however, he
must play the perfect match.  A false move means death at the hands of
his mentor Esteban (Giancarlo Esposito), the local smack distributor.</P>
<P>     FRESH takes the setting and tone of BOYZ 'N THE HOOD and MENACE II
SOCIETY and applies it to a thriller.  Gone is the documentary-like
quality of filmmaking as well as the gritty sense of immediacy.  FRESH
uses higher-quality film stock and a more traditional cinematographic
style to distance the audience ever-so-slightly from the characters.
This way, it's easier to appreciate the complexity of Michael's plan
and the manner in which he arranges his masterful scheme of
manipulation.</P>
<P>     With a script as smart as the title character, FRESH keeps its
viewers guessing.  Having a sixth grader as the protagonist is a stroke
of genius that adds a further layer of tension to an already taut
storyline.  Thirteen year old Sean Nelson's performance would make many
older actors envious.  Without a hint of awkwardness, he conveys the
sharp intelligence behind Michael's wide-eyed, seemingly-innocent
looks.</P>
<P>     Samuel L. Jackson, who is becoming a familiar face these days (his
other current film is Quentin Tarantino's PULP FICTION), is a
scene-stealer as Michael's near-vagrant speed-chess-playing father.
The role isn't large, but this is an example of an actor at his most
focused.</P>
<P>     Michael's father advises him that any piece on the chess board can
be sacrificed to get the king.  It is a lesson he takes to heart.
Everyone becomes an expendable pawn in the high-stakes game, and there
are casualties.  The price of winning at all costs is depicted in the
film's final shot.  That's just one of the images that marks FRESH as
an atypical thriller--a film that succeeds because it defies many
conventions of its genre.</P>
