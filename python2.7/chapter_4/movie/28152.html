<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A "B" thriller, noted for its renown noir scene of the protagonist
getting worked over by a ruthless gang in their dark basement hideaway
while overhead a single light bulb swings back and forth from the force
of the beating. Anthony Mann is a master at directing these cheapie
films and making them look stylish. He gets the most out of this thin
story because of the complementary performances of Raymond Burr and
Steve Brodie. Burr makes for an excellent villain, as he plays the
vicious gangleader with force, while Brodie is refreshing as the
innocent hero on the run from both the cops and the criminal gang.</P>
<P>Married for only 4 months, independent trucker Steve Randall (Brodie)
brings his wife Anne (Audrey Long) flowers to celebrate how happy they
both are; but, while getting ready to celebrate that evening he receives
a work related call offering him a chance to make more than he normally
does for delivering merchandise. It turns out that he is being duped by
an acquaintance he knew before he went into the army, and is forced by
them to deliver stolen merchandise. Somehow he manages to work the
blinking lights on the truck to get the attention of a passing policeman
in the warehouse area. But the cop is killed after wounding the beloved
brother of the gangleader, Walt Radak (Burr), who is captured by the
police and convicted of murder and sentenced to die in the electric
chair.</P>
<P>Walt escaped with Steve still held hostage by the other gang members
(Steele, Frederick  & Challee). He then administers that classical noir
beating of Steve as he tries to get him to go to the police and confess
he murdered the cop, thereby freeing brother Al. When Steve refuses,
even after the beating, Walt blackmails him by saying he will hold his
wife hostage until he does.</P>
<P>Steve manages to elude the hoods taking him to the police station and
calls his pregnant wife, telling her they have to get out of town
immediately. He says that when he gets her to safety in her aunt's farm
in Minnesota, he'll go to the police. But on the way to the farm, he
tries to buy a car from a crooked used-car dealer who cheats him out of
his money. He ends up stealing the 1927 car, but it breaks down on the
road and he is given a lift by the local sheriff. When the sheriff
discovers who they are and tries to arrest them, his car goes accidently
off the road and he loses consciousness. Steve will flee with his wife
and reach Aunt Klara's farm. He then turns himself in to homicide
Lieutenant Ferrari (Jason Robards Sr.-Robard's father). Ferrari says he
doesn't believe him, but lets him go to be the bait for the rest of the
gang, as he realizes they are after him.</P>
<P>Walt hires a sleazy private detective (Fowley) to find Steve, who is
followed by the cops to the farm and then back to Walt's hideout. The
cops get into a shoot-out with the gang, severely wounding Walt. But the
gang escapes, and it's now 5 months later and Walt's brother is to be
executed at midnight. The climax comes as Walt nabs Steve and threatens
to execute him at midnight, just when his brother is scheduled to die.</P>
<P>Violence and desperation are the themes of this noir film. They are both
very real themes, as the innocent couple is more afraid of what the
ruthless gang can do to them than afraid of the law. If examined
closely, there are many holes in the story, but what works very
effectively is how the film shows that middle-class aspirations for the
postwar period are tinged with cynicism. It's shown how there's a sense
of brutality that fills the everyday American social scene. The paranoid
couple feels the urgency to look out for themselves, not trusting anyone
else to help them. This feeling of hopelessness the couple has, gives
this film its classic noir look.</P>
