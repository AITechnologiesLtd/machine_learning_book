<PRE>REVIEW:  Her Majesty Mrs Brown (1997)</PRE>
<P>The attraction of love is a powerful thing.  In the tale of Queen Victoria and 
an extravagant veteran servant, awkwardly titled "Mrs Brown," we are reminded 
of a value lesson.  For when the word love is mentioned, we immediately think 
of marriages and intimate relationships.  But the love and attraction 
highlighted in Mrs Brown is not the kind found in sex or marriage; rather in 
the wonder and bondage of a true friendship.</P>
<P>During the lengthy reign of Queen Victoria (Judi Dench), her majesty went 
through a period of deep grief and depression after the death of her beloved 
husband Albert. Disappearing from public view and perception, the secretive and 
distressed Queen has lost confidence in her role as leader of the country.  </P>
<P>Entering her life is John Brown (Billy Connolly), a loyal yet outspoken servant 
that devotes his life to giving the Queen confidence and protection at any 
cost.  Over the following couple of years the two become immersed in friendship 
and drawn together with a powerful attraction.  The Queen is not an attractive 
woman, but her power and stand in society is, and although both of them realize 
and even consider the costs of having an affair, the intimate boundaries of 
their friendship prevents them from doing so.  Behind her back, the Queen is 
dubbed as "Mrs. Brown."</P>
<P>Whilst this relationship is taking place, England is not benefiting from the 
Queen's seemingly eternal absence from public view.  So as the monarchy beings 
to fall into crisis, Prime Minister Disraeli (Anthony Sher) realizes that Brown 
is the key to refreshing faith in the crown.</P>
<P>Mrs. Brown can surely be considered as an elegant and graceful film, but it 
quickly finds itself trying too hard to make us care for the relationship 
between the Queen and Brown, which ultimately falls flat on its face as soon as 
we are witness to the Queen's uninspiring and emotionless personality.  The 
film's dialogue doesn't give Judi Dench any chance to get into her distressing 
role, so naturally when the Queen enters the scene Mrs Brown takes a tumble 
into an almost non existent level of interest.</P>
<P>Billy Connolly, responsible for picking up the pieces of a fairly weak film, is 
an absolute revelation and refreshes the audience with a touch of well placed 
humor and a diligent presence on the screen.  For those of you who don't know, 
he is actually a stand up comedian - so if you thought that casting him as John 
Brown would be like casting Jerry Seinfeld as Hamlet, think again.</P>
<P>The finest part of Mrs Brown's awkwardly crafted collection of scenes is just 
near the end, yet ironically the final scenes of the film are among the worst. 
 They seem incredibly rushed and hastily put together; so as the lights in the 
cinema were becoming brighter I was left gazing at the credits asking myself - 
"Did I miss something?"</P>
<P>Another main problem with the film, and call me what you will, is that it's 
just not interesting enough.  I don't have anything against historical and 
periodic stories, but Mrs. Brown proved too bland and often much too dull to 
keep me eagerly watching.  There are two ways that the production crew could 
have addressed this problem - either alter history to suit the film's needs 
(which, thankfully, they did not do) or to change the focus of the story to a 
more interesting character or setting.  So in this case, I would have been 
delighted if Mrs. Brown had shown us much more of Billy Connolly's intriguing 
character rather than monotonous Queen who doesn't tantalize any climatic taste 
buds.  </P>
<P>But overall, Mrs Brown is an entertaining period film that could have been much 
more than what it amounted to be, and the main problem lies in the relationship 
between the Queen and Brown that never really works.  More often then not the 
film appears to be emotionless and cold; which should never be related to a 
film so caught up in love and loyalty.</P>
<PRE>2 = stars out of 5</PRE>
<P>For a film originally made for British TV, the idiot box would be an ideal 
place to showcase this slightly disappointing drama.</P>
