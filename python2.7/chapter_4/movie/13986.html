<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   No compendium addressing Hollywood cinema in the 1990s would be
   complete without a reference to the remarkable effect the works of
   screenwriter-of-the-moment Kevin Williamson have had on the film
   industry.  Churning out successive blockbusters SCREAM, I KNOW WHAT
   YOU DID LAST SUMMER, and SCREAM 2 (not to mention TV's latest trendy
   teen serial, DAWSON'S CREEK), he's reinvigorated the slasher genre
   to a point where an installment of the venerable HALLOWEEN franchise
   is not only being treated like an event movie by its handlers at
   Dimension Films, but looms so fearsome that its competitors have
   scrambled to avoid matching up against it -- the opening for
   DISTURBING BEHAVIOUR jumped two weeks, while VIRUS has been shuttled
   off to 1999.  When one considers the relative indifference which met
   the previous entry in the series a mere three years ago, HALLOWEEN
   6: THE CURSE OF MICHAEL MYERS, the shift in the climate is obvious.</P>
<P>   Mr. Williamson's fingerprints are all over this latest installment,
   HALLOWEEN: H20 - TWENTY YEARS LATER, as well.  An avid fan of the
   original John Carpenter classic, it's no secret that the current
   project was originally based on his story (Mr. Williamson eventually
   took an executive producer credit), and that he drummed up a cameo
   role on request for actress Janet Leigh.  In addition, his
   now-trademark referential style is clearly evident throughout --
   there are obvious nods to key scary films of the past, including the
   FRIDAY THE 13TH series, PSYCHO, and even PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE.
   (Well, *that* one's just dreadfully frightening.)</P>
<P>   The big hook for this 20th anniversary edition, of course, is the
   return of erstwhile scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode,
   the heroine of the first two films; as such, it's entirely
   appropriate that she enters the story shrieking her lungs out.  Take
   that, Neve Campbell -- the queen is back in town.</P>
<P>   But first, the film opens with a derivative, albeit capable, prologue
   involving another returning character, nurse Marion (Nancy Stephens),
   who finds her ominous, darkened house seemingly burgled.  As anyone
   familiar with the slasher genre can tell you, *don't go in there* --
   fortunately, she's been in two of these films before, so she knows
   what she's doing; two neighbourhood boys are dispatched instead to
   investigate the deathtrap.  It all ends rather messily, of course
   (and echoes -- you guessed it -- the opening scene in SCREAM [which
   itself referenced HALLOWEEN] by ending with cries of terror falling
   upon oblivious ears), but director Steve Miner adequately mimics
   John Carpenter's roaming POV Panavision images and conveys a nice
   sense of titillating dread during the segment.  The preface is capped
   off with an atmospheric opening credits sequence encapsulating the
   backstory (and winningly homaging the late Donald Pleasance's
   character, Dr. Loomis -- whom, in my book, was the series' most
   intriguing) which conveys two unmistakable points: a) Laurie Strode
   has faked her death and gone into hiding, and b) homicidal boogeyman
   (and brother, natch) Michael Myers is coming to get her.</P>
<P>   The final confrontation between the estranged siblings is clearly the
   showcase for the picture, but some forty minutes of maddening
   banality must be endured first.  While The Shape makes his
   cross-country trek, the film establishes its new characters and
   revisits Laurie, who's changed her identity and moved to California,
   leading a low-key life as the headmistress of a posh boarding school.
   Despite twenty years of anonymity and relative tranquillity, all is
   not right with our heroine -- for one thing, disconcerting visions of
   little brother pop up every five minutes or so.  The picture so
   mindlessly overkills with its reinforcement of Laurie's traumatized
   state (she pops pills, tosses down drinks with utter abandon, and is
   even referred to in dialogue as a functioning alcoholic) that it all
   becomes tiresome; any creepy effect generated by her neverending
   series of Michael Myers-themed hallucinations is sapped.  (It doesn't
   help that the eventual payoff scene is fumbled, either.)</P>
<P>   One of the requisites of the slasher genre is fodder for its maniac,
   and H20 oblingly complies, tossing a quartet of nubile adolescents
   and a couple of bumbling authority figures into the fray and then
   numbingly extending copious amounts of uninteresting screentime to
   these generic, disposable characters.  (Ronny, the would-be comic
   relief in the film, distinguishes himself the most, if only for being
   perhaps the most incompetent security guard on the planet.)  Although
   it's interesting to consider how it all might have played out had
   original choices Robert Forster and Charles S. Dutton took on the
   roles which ultimately went to Adam Arkin and L.L. Cool J,
   respectively, the weakness lies with the thinly-drawn archetypes
   thrust upon the actors.  The picture's interminable middle stretch is
   tedious, dreary material, punctuated by Mr. Miner's annoying attempts
   to elicit cheap shocks by zinging the sound board with every opening
   door.</P>
<P>   The problem is that there's just not enough story to sustain this
   film; although its running time is already a thin 85 minutes, if one
   cuts the fat off this flick we could conceivably be looking at a
   short film.  As a result, liberal doses of padding are used to occupy
   the bulk of the picture, killing time until Michael Myers arrives on
   the scene in a stolen car (the thought of which, forgive me, always
   makes me smile -- The Shape may be one bad-ass psychopathic maniac,
   but he's a mighty careful driver).</P>
<P>   The stretch drive of the film, featuring Michael Myers making the
   rounds and finally facing off against sis Laurie in a fight to the
   finish, is what we've been waiting for the entire film, and well
   worth the wait, almost redeeming the preceding monotony.  Though
   none of it is particularly original, it's nonetheless good fun to
   watch Michael stalk his prey (at one point, Michelle Williams put on
   a petrified expression that made me break out in a grin) and the
   sibling combat is about as exciting as a battle with a relentless,
   unstoppable villain can be.  The showdown includes the film's two
   best moments -- a shot of Myers, just out of reach from his victims,
   zestfully slashing away, and a terrific cinematic scene which finds
   Laurie calling out a challenge to the killer as the camera cranes
   back and an orchestral rendition of John Carpenter's unmistakable
   theme explodes on the soundtrack.  (It'd have been more effective if
   it were the simple, more elegaic piano original, but no matter.)
   What really makes the sequence work is the crazed intensity which
   shines through as Laurie shrieks into the darkness, indicating her
   shift from hunted to hunter; at that moment, she's the scariest
   person in the film.</P>
<P>   That being said, H20 isn't a noticeably scary film -- it relies more
   on adrenaline thrills than chills to keep the audience involved --
   and for a slasher flick, it's hardly gory; the resolution of a
   perversely intriguing tyke-in-jeopardy moment is indicative of its
   toothlessness.  It remains to be seen how the sheer predictability of
   its by-the-numbers plotting is received by savvy audiences -- I don't
   think it's any coincidence that the (annoying) eight-year old next to
   me that snuck into the screening was able to both correctly identify
   SCREAM 2 as the video tape playing onscreen and accurately (and
   loudly) assess the fates of the various extraneous characters.</P>
<P>   Among the three key horror franchises which emerged from the slasher
   era, HALLOWEEN is the sole survivor, having watched Wes Craven's A
   NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET gracefully bow out and FRIDAY THE 13TH go
   belly-up (although rumblings still persist about a Freddy vs. Jason
   project in the works, God forbid -- in terms of charisma, it's a
   mismatch).  Like all sequels of this genre, this film ends with a
   note of perceived finality, made all the more convincing by the
   characters involved and the manner in which it's dispatched.  Still,
   I don't buy it -- considering the plethora of inventive previous
   demises and after all he's been through, do we really have a reason
   to believe they can keep a good man down?</P>

"...a first screenplay unaccompanied by a powerful agent or industry
 sponsor is generally a pathetic fetus of a film, nothing more."
