<PRE>                              HAPPY GILMORE
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     It is quite possible I suppose that a golf enthusiast might find
Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler) funny.  Not being a golfer, it seemed like
pure slapstick.  The big joke being that Happy is a hockey player of
sorts who discovers that with his hockey stick he can slam a golf ball
over 400 yards.  Golf is where the money is so Happy switches to golf
much to the horror of the sedate golfers he meets on the various
courses.</P>
<P>     Happy does a weird kind of approach from about 5 feet away from
the golf ball before he wiggles and takes a swipe at the ball.  The
camera immediately pans up into the sky as the ball disappears into the
wild blue yonder only to land a few feet from the cup.  Once in a while
he gets lucky and his 400+-footer gains him a hole in one.  On the
occasions when he gets only close to the cup, he can take 5 small puts
before he finally sinks the ball.</P>
<P>     Happy would have liked to be a pro-hockey player but he lacked one
essential: he could not ice skate.  Fortunately, skating is not a
requirement for golf.  Unfortunately, it takes more than the film's
story to make a good comedy.</P>
<P>     Others in the cast include Virgina Venit (Julie Bowen), the golf
tournament's PR person who is assigned to handle him.  Happy has a
one-handed coach (Carl Weathers) and a homeless man he engages as his
caddie.  And so on.</P>
