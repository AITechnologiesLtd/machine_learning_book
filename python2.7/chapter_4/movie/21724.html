<PRE>Review: Boys Donâ€™t Cry                           </PRE>
<PRE>        Starring Hilary Swank, Chloe Sevigny, Peter Sarsgaard.
        Written and directed by Kimberly Pierce</PRE>
<P>This film, based on actual events, chronicles the story of Teena Brandon, a
young woman who passed as a man and was raped and murdered when her identity
was uncovered.  It is a fascinating and disturbing story, an unsentimental look
at the American heartland as a place of deeply ingrained intolerance.  Rather
than nurturing individual freedom, as the American myth would have it, the wide
open spaces of rural Nebraska make its peopleâ€™s lives narrow and pinched.</P>
<P>Enter Teena Brandon (Hilary Swank), who reinvents herself as Brandon Teena. 
Heâ€™s a fearless and outgoing little guy with a big buck-toothed grin. 
Getting into a barroom scrape with a man literally twice his size,
bumper-surfing under the power lines, racing another car on a dark and deserted
highway, itâ€™s an exhilarating beginning to his new life.  His enthusiasm
proves attractive to the doe-eyed Lana (Chloe Sevigny), standing as it does in
marked contrast to the bleak hopelessness of her small circle of friends. 
Sheâ€™s also attracted by Brandonâ€™s simple kindness toward her.  Kindness is
something sheâ€™s seen precious little of.</P>
<P>Trouble is not far behind.  Brandon lives by shoplifting and forging checks,
and is dogged by an outstanding warrant for auto theft.  Minimum wage jobs and
petty crime are the only future these misbegotten souls have to look forward
to.  Then thereâ€™s John (Peter Sarsgaard), the young ex-con and alpha male of
the group who wants to protect Lana.  Clearly, the only one she needs to be
protected from is him.  Inevitably there is trouble between him and Brandon. 
Brandon, I think, sees it coming; he just doesnâ€™t care to get out of the way.
 Heâ€™s burning his candle at both ends.  What follows is the heartbreaking
destruction of young life.</P>
<P>â€œBoys Donâ€™t Cryâ€? stands in sharp contrast to the sentimentalized,
glamorized violence of â€œFight Clubâ€?.  Stripped of Brad Pittâ€™s movie star
appeal, fighting in barrooms and stealing cars begins to look depressingly
low-rent.  Unleashed rage leads not to catharsis and manhood confirmed but
rather to two corpses on the floor of a farmhouse in Falls City, Nebraska.</P>
