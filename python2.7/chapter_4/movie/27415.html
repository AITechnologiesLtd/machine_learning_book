DOUBLE TAKE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>Writer/director George Gallo's buddy movie, DOUBLE TAKE, stars Orlando 
Jones (THE REPLACEMENTS) as sophisticated stockbroker Daryl Chase and 
Eddie Griffin (DEUCE BIGALOW: MALE GIGOLO) as foul-mouthed street 
hustler Freddy Tiffany.  The confusing and awkward script is loosely 
based on the 1957 movie ACROSS THE BRIDGE with Rod Steiger.  </P>
<P>DOUBLE TAKE is a comedy in which half of the audience's laughs at our 
screening came from Freddy's propensity to mock his little, white, 
fluffy dog by calling her "bitch."  Personally, I didn't find any of the 
film funny, although I did smile when Freddy tried to drive a car across 
the Rio Grande.  Whoops, too deep.   </P>
<P>It all starts when Daryl befriends Freddy, who is falsely accused of a 
crime.  Or is he?  The movie relies on the old routine of things 
frequently not being what they seem.  Well, before you know it, Daryl is 
suspected of a double murder and is heading for Mexico, where the CIA 
will protect him.  </P>
<P>Along the way, Daryl and Freddy swap identities.  Daryl, who graduated 
from Harvard, has to learn the ways of the street from Freddy, who 
graduated from "HKU (Hard Knock University)."  In one embarrassing 
scene, Daryl shows off his impersonation skills by being loud and 
obnoxious to a black Amtrak waiter, while demanding Schlitz Malt Liquor 
with his dinner.</P>
<P>The ridiculousness of the script is perhaps best shown in Daryl's 
actions on the train.   While the train is moving, he demands that they 
install a 2-line phone, Internet access and a Fax machine in his 
compartment.  This just doesn't make any sense whether you take his 
request to be a serious one, as it appears to be, or as a joke.  In 
either case, it isn't funny, and it doesn't make any sense in the 
context of the story.</P>
<P>The entire movie plays like a  reject for a convoluted Saturday Night 
Live skit.  And if you ignore the comedic parts and evaluate the movie 
as a cop drama -- after all, lots of people die -- it has even less to 
offer.  This movie isn't even worth a first take, much less a double 
take.</P>
<P>DOUBLE TAKE runs 1:30.  It is rated PG-13 for violence and language and 
would be acceptable for kids around 11 and up.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 11, thought the film was funny and gave it ***.  His 
favorite part was the way that they switched places.  He said that the 
story did not fit together properly so they should have spent about 15 
more minutes in the beginning developing the characters.</P>
