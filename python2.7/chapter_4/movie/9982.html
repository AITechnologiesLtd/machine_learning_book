A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Jean-Pierre Jeunet</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: Joss Whedon</PRE>
<P>Starring: Sigourney Weaver, Winona Ryder</P>
<PRE>Ingredients: 
Drooling indestructable giant alien instectoids, trapped band of humans
in a spaceship</PRE>
<P>Synopsis: 
For those of you unfamiliar with the 네lien' series, every 네lien' movie
is basically the same formula: in each movie a small crew of humans
including Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is trapped on a spaceship or
planet full of drooling, big, alien insectoids. In the gloomy third film
of the series a morose Ellen Ripley gets impregnated with alien DNA and
kills herself. This fourth film, 네lien: Resurrection,' picks up where
the third one left off. In 네lien: Resurrection' a military/scientific
mission makes a living clone from the dead Ripley in order to extract an
alien fetus from her for DNA research. This leads to a situation where a
small multiethnic crew of humans including clone Ripley is trapped on a
spaceship chock full of predatory alien insectoids. The twist is,
because of DNA foul-ups, Ripley is now part alien (she has heightened
senses and her blood corrodes metal), and the Aliens are part human (one
skull-faced alien thinks Ripley is Mommy). Also we get to see aliens
ambush humans underwater in a flooded compartment. In a subplot, Winona
Ryder plays a waif-like smuggler wannabe who doesn't reveal her
mysterious past until the end of the movie. The humans are trying to
reach a small escape vessel on the other end of the spaceship. Can they
reach it before the aliens pick them off one by one?</P>
<P>Opinion: 
Prior to this film, the best movie of the entire 네lien' series was
probably number two: 네liens' (1986, director James Cameron; it was
about a small multiethnic crew of humans including clone Ripley on a
planet full of predatory aliens) because of it's roller coaster thrills
and shootem up style. Next best was the original 네lien' (1979, director
Ridley Scott), a decent sci fi flick. And coming in last was the
depressing 네lien 3' (1992, director David Fincher). Now that I've seen
네lien: Resurrection,' I place it in second, right behind 네liens'
(1986, James Cameron). On the plus side, the special effects were fine,
and Sigourney Weaver did a good job acting. On the minus side, there's
only so much you can expect from the same formula the fourth time in a
row. And the dialogue's pretty stiff ("You have a monster in your chest.
Then you die."). This one's strictly formula, but has enough chase
scenes to be entertaining. Kinda funny, but French director Jean-Pierre
Jeunet (best known for 넶he City of the Lost Children') likes to put in
little comic touches such as military generals that wake up with more
hair on their arms and chest than the average orangutan, and security
doors that identify by breathalyzer. </P>
