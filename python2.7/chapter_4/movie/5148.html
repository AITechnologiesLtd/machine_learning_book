<PRE>                            THE LAST SUPPER
                       A film review by Joan Ellis
                    Copyright 1996 Nebbadoon Syndicate</PRE>
<P>"The Last Supper" is the perfect title for this sardonic
comedy.  A group of self-satisfied grad students gathers on
Sunday nights to discuss the fine points of issues on which they
all agree.  Since they have yet to engage real life on any level,
they are free to wallow in the untested smugness of their
academic theories.  They are young liberals.</P>
<P>Their habit is to invite an alien thinker to stir the pot at
their Sunday suppers.  When fate deposits a monstrous bigot at
the table, the pot comes to a full boil that ends in murder. 
Faced with an act unimaginable to their humanist sensibilities
just a moment earlier, the students analyze their options much as
they might the pros and cons of going into Bosnia.  </P>
<P>Call the police? Claim self-defense? Bury him in the
backyard?  Quickly, they decide that sacrificing superior
intellect to a jail term for killing an unworthy facist is not an
option.  At this point, the movie takes an abrupt turn into black
humor as the now practiced murderers invite an increasingly
outrageous stream of right-wing zealots to share their table
before dispatching them to the backyard to fertilize their
tomatoes.  </P>
<P>Freed from the suspense of a serious thriller, we ponder the
theoretical questions flying around the screen and laugh
nervously at the comic calm that accompanies the ritual murders. 
We enjoy the choice of murder weapon that establishes collective
guilt, but watching guests and hosts  imprisoned in their own
rectitude is not the fluffy fun of Agatha Christie.  </P>
<P>A reverend intones that "homosexuality is the disease, and
AIDS is the cure."  Another posits that women invite rape,
another that the homeless must "know their place."  The
anti-environmentalist crows, "If the spotted owl's time is up..." 
They smart just a little when a young conservative attacks: 
"It's your generation's morality that has put my generation at
risk."</P>
<P>Oblivious to what they are doing in the name of higher
cause, the graduate students continue to dissect the
hypotheticals that feed their egos: Would you have killed Hitler
before he became Hitler?  At what point is it O.K. to kill
someone who is becoming an evil force on this planet?  Blind to
any idea that is not their own, these budding intellects are
arrogant hypocrits who toast themselves for "making the world a
better place and making a difference...we wouldn't kill anyone
unless we couldn't change their minds."  </P>
<P>Director Stacy Title and his crew have a very good time
using the ugly extremes of conservative zealotry to skewer the
self-righteousness of liberal piety.  Cameron Diaz, Bill Paxton,
Jason Alexander, Mark Harmon, and Annabeth Gish manage to mock
extemism in any form.  </P>
<P>We are reminded that the student who says, "We're liberals;
we do the right thing," usually grows up to be a conservative,
while the student who consistently tries to do the right thing
grows up to be the conscience of democracy.  </P>
