<PRE>                            Stephen King Films
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1995 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>CARRIE (1976) **</PRE>
<P>     For a horror movie, CARRIE sure isn't very scary.  Hey, that
rhymes!  It seems more like a drama to me than a horror film.  And that
Sissy Space k is really weird looking.  Are we really supposed to
believe that a seventeen-year-old girl with fully developed breasts
would just now be getting her first period?  Hey, I was in sex
education class.  Stephen King can't fool me!</P>
<P>     But King does have an incredible imagination, as we find out in
the scene at the prom, when the movie turns exciting for about ten
minutes.  Once she gets that bucket of pig's blood dropped on her
head, you can just say good-bye to John Travolta and his cute little
girlfriend!</P>
<PRE>CAT'S EYE (1985) **1/2</PRE>
<P>     One of the myriad Stephen King-based movies in the "C" category
(CHRISTINE, CHILDREN OF THE CORN, CARRIE, CREEPSHOW 1 and 2, CUJO,
etc.), CAT'S EYE consists of three unrelated vignettes linked together
by a tabby cat out to save an innocent Drew Barrymore, who tells the
cat at the beginning of the movie that she's in trouble.  I'll say,
she's a slut and a drug addict.</P>
<P>     The cat sets off on its journey while we watch the first vignette,
with James Woods as a troubled smoker who goes to "Quitter's Inc.,"
from a story in King's NIGHT SHIFT collection, which is presently
gathering dust in my garage.  Quitters Inc. is an organization for
smokers who want to quit the habit, headed up by aging comedian Alan
King.  Their methods are unconventional, to say the least--a relapse
calls for the electrocution of a close family member (the same reason I
gave up Nutri-System).  One of the movie's funniest moments comes when
the cat is subjected to a mild voltage dose as a demonstration.  So
I'm a sick guy, okay?  Rest assured no cats were electrocuted in the
making of this movie.</P>
<P>     Segment 2 features Robert "Airplane" Hays as a tennis pro
involved with a mobster's wife.  The mob guy captures him and offers
him a wager he can't refuse--his life, $20,000 and the mobster's
wife--if Hays walks around "The Ledge" of his penthouse.  This one's
also from the NIGHT SHIFT collection (still gathering dust in my
garage).</P>
<P>     The cat finally reaches Barrymore by the final segment, where
she is being terrorized every night by a six-inch troll (no sick jokes,
please).  A fairly original piece (not found in the NIGHT SHIFT
collection--Have I mentioned the dust in my garage?), but as always,
the parents are the disbelieving stereotypes who blame the troll's
damage on the cat.</P>
<P>     If ever you see this movie listed in the TV guide, at least
watch the first segment ("Quitter's Inc."), which is extremely amusing
and doesn't contain the usual Stephen King weirdness.  The rest of
Cat's Eye is relatively weird less, but is also bland compared to
"Quitter's Inc." This movie is in the middle, quality-wise of King's
other vignette compilation movies, not as good as CREEPSHOW, but
better than CREEPSHOW 2.</P>
<PRE>CHRISTINE (1983) *</PRE>
<P>     You'd think between horror novel great Stephen "Carrie" King and
horror movie great John "Halloween" Carpenter, that they could come u p
with a good horror movie, but this sure isn't it.  The only thing this
movie's got that's even remotely interesting is the indestructible car,
but we don't get very much car-killing action.  Instead, we see
thirty-year-old actors portraying teenagers with one thing on their
minds--something they spend a lot of the movie talking about
explicitly.  I can't imagine much of this movie would remain in the
censored TV version.</P>
<P>     Christine's a car with a past.  Several people in the past
twenty years have died in or around the car.  This doesn't stop Arnie,
a hopeless nerd at the beginning of the movie, from buying it from the
same old fart that would scare Macaulay Culkin half to death seven
years later in HOME ALONE.  After a little body work, Christine is as
good as new.  In fact, she's an immortal car.  We never learn why
Christine is alive ... and indestructible, but do you remember that TV
show from the 60's, "My Mother the Car"?</P>
<P>     Despite Christine's imminent compaction at the end of the
movie, the door is left open for a sequel.  Thank God they never made
one!</P>
<PRE>CREEPSHOW (1982) ***</PRE>
<P>     What the heck?  An entertaining Stephen King movie?!  Can it be?
Why, yes it can.  In CREEPSHOW, King takes a new approach to horror...
demented comedy.  Along with Director George Romero's (a household
name, right?) weird comic book-style approach, CREEPSHOW could only
have sprung out of the twisted mind of Stephen King.</P>
<P>     CREEPSHOW contains five unrelated vignettes.  The first, and
weakest, is an incoherent piece about a dead guy who comes back on
Father's Day and keeps asking everyone "Where's my cake?"  See what I
mean?  The movie picks up from there, with King himself starring in the
story of a redneck farmer who stumbles upon a meteor that contains
concentrated MiracleGro, and soon everything he owns--including
himself--sprouts foliage.  The third chapter stars Leslie Nielson as
the demented husband of Ted Danson's mistress, who buries his wife and
Danson in the sand to be carried away with the tide.  Part IV concerns
a giant crate that contains ????.  And the final vignette follows
the saga of a millionaire who hates bugs.  As you can guess, he soon
finds him self fending off an onslaught of roaches.</P>
<P>     So let me tell you, this movie's a good blend of comedy and
horror.  But let me also caution you that Stephen King's writing
pleases millions, but his acting pleases few.</P>
<PRE>CREEPSHOW 2 (1987) **</PRE>
<P>     Another Stephen King journey into the world of the macabre and
mediocre.  I thought the original CREEPSHOW was entertaining and
original, but this one just ain't happenin'. "We've just received word,
there are some bad horror movies going around the theaters.  As always,
we advise you to stay away from these movies, but it's your trip."</P>
<P>     The first CREEPSHOW had five segments, three of which were
unpredictable and fun to watch.  This one has three segments, plus an
ongoing animated sequence featuring Billy, the avid "Creepshow" comic
book reader.  The word "sucks" doesn't even begin to apply.</P>
<P>     The only truly interesting piece is the first, "Old Chief
Woodenhead," with George Kennedy of the "Naked Gun" series as a kind old
store owner who is robbed and murdered by a young Native American gone
astray.  Chief Woodenhead, the wooden statue outside the store, takes
on a life of his own to exact revenge on the backslidding redskin and
his accomplices.  Good, but too drawn out.</P>
<P>     The second episode, "The Raft" (from the SKELETON CREW
collection), has four young pot-smoking co-eds sailing the lake on an
abandoned raft.  Wherever they sail, they are followed by a giant oil
slick that eats them one by one.  I don't make this stuff up, I only
summarize it.</P>
<P>     Finally, "The Hitchhiker" episode shows us an adulterous woman
who hit-and-run's a hitchhiker, who gosh darn it, just won't die.  He
keeps coming back to haunt her.  Making this and the other two stories
as half-hour TV episodes and leaving out all the cartoon junk with
Billy would have been a whole lot better.</P>
<PRE>CUJO (1983) **1/2</PRE>
<P>     Exactly how many Stephen King novels have they made into a
movie?!  I'm sure you could count them all on two hands--if they each
had thirty fingers!  This one, however, ranks in the top ten, being
slightly better than CHRISTINE and GRAVEYARD SHIFT, due to its use of
a huge, hulking St. Bernard that attacks a mother and child.  But for
the first forty-five minutes, we get the horror of the average family
with their not-so-average problems.</P>
<P>     The kid's afraid of monsters under the bed and in the closet, the
mom's guilty about her affair with the "local stud," and the dad's in
major trouble because his ad campaign for a popular cereal occurred at
the same time the cereal sent hundreds of innocent people to the
hospital.  As all this is happening, Cujo the dog is growing more and
more vicious.  For some reason we never learn, the family's problems
turn the dog into a raving, maniacal hound from Hell, but since it's a
Stephen King movie, we just take it for granted that something
supernatural or telepathic is going on.</P>
<P>     Cujo had the potential to go beyond the somewhat insulting
two-and-a-half star rating, but the entire last half of the movie is
just the mom and kid trapped in a broken car miles from nowhere as Cujo
lurks menacingly outside.  While in real life, watching two people
trapped in a car while being attacked by a huge dog would be
entertaining, in a movie it's kind of boring.</P>
<PRE>GRAVEYARD SHIFT (1989) 1/2</PRE>
<P>     I know Stephen King sued the makers of THE LAWNMOWER MAN because
they took one of his short stories and turned it into a truly awful
movie and, after watching GRAVEYARD SHIFT, I wonder why he didn't take
the producer and director of this movie to court as well.  It's a
terrible movie about a small town textile factory overrun by rats .
Several workers of the graveyard shift have already been murdered in
freak "accidents" arranged by the head rat.  The head rat is some sort
of mutant that has grown from a few inches to seven feet tall.  As a
group of workers embark on a mission to clean out the factory's
basement, they find themselves being picked off one by one by this huge
mutant rat from the sewers.  It came from raw sewage!  As a matter of
fact, so did this movie.</P>
<PRE>IT (1990) ***1/2</PRE>
<P>     My personal favorite from the Stephen King cinema collection, a
made- for-TV effort that, even though it's over three hours long, never
bores you for a second. (Well, maybe during the last half of the
closing credits, but that's not important.)</P>
<P>     The small town of Derry, Maine experiences some strange goings-on
(killings, maimings, the usual King stuff) every thirty years like
clockwork (You could set your calendar by it.), but the only people who
realize it are seven kids, "The Losers' Club" (and, yes, I have been
formally invited to join), who in 1960 all receive hallucinogenic
visits from Pennywise the Evil Clown (played by Bill Clinton--excuse
me--Tim Curry), who personifies the supernatural force behind the
deaths.  The kids band together to destroy It in the sewer and
succeed, promising to return to Derry if It ever does.</P>
<P>     Guess what, It does thirty years later (like clockwork--you could
have set your calendar by it) and faithful resident Tim Reid (Venus
Flytrap from "WKRP in Cincinnati") calls up the other six, including
Harry Anderson (Judge Stone from "Night Court") and John Ritter (Jack
from "Three's Company").  Are made-for-TV horror movies the last stop
for aging sitcom stars or what?</P>
<P>     The first half of IT tells the story of the seven kids through
flashbacks, as their adult counterparts get the phone calls and
remember the traumas of the past.  The second half has the adults
returning to Derry to relive the evil of the past and fight It again.
As Harry Anderson says, "You can forget calling me up when I'm seventy
to fight this thing."</P>
<P>     It has none of the gore of the typical King movie, but it's
just as frightening--if not more so.  Maybe because the three-hour
running time allows plenty of chances for us to get to know and care
about the characters.  Can't we all identify with the loser-type who
is rejected and stalked by his peers and finds his deepest and darkest
fears coming true?  Well, I can, okay?!</P>
<PRE>THE LANGOLIERS (1995) **1/2</PRE>
<P>     The latest of the Stephen King stories-turned-movies-of-the-week,
this one a straight adaptation of the 250-page novella from FOUR PAST
MIDNIGHT.  See, I read the story, I know what I'm talking about.  And,
given the circumstances (a four-hour TV mini-series), The Langoliers is
the best movie it could have possibly been.  A two-and-a-half star
rating for a low-budget TV-movie is comparable to a three-and-a-half
star rating for a big-name theatrical Hollywood blockbuster.  Many of
the Stephen King novels have been drastically altered the page to the
screen, and many suffer in the process, but rest assured THE LANGOLIERS
doesn't stray at all.  You could almost read along while watching the
movie.</P>
<P>     About thirty minutes into a plane flight, ten passengers awaken to
find everyone else has disappeared, including the pilot and co-pilot.
All that's left of the vanished passengers are watches, dental
fillings, surgical pins, etc.  Luckily, the main character just
happens to be a pilot, so he and the other nine continue their course
across the country, noticing the complete absence of life and power
below them.  I won't get into the detailed plot summary this time, but
the explanation for everyone's disappearance is the old
rip-in-the-fabric-of-time science-fiction premise.  It sounds trite,
but THE LANGOLIERS manages to stay original and cliche-free for three
hours, without ever succumbing to boredom.</P>
<PRE>MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE (1986) 1/2</PRE>
<P>     Stephen King tried his hand at acting in CREEPSHOW, with
disastrous results.  That's nothing compared to his title of
screenwriter and director of this turkey.  He says he set out
deliberately to make a stupid horror movie.  Hey, there's nothing I
like more than mindless violence (unless it's mindless sex), but you
need a sense of humor about it.  King plunges into this movie with a
completely serious approach, a tragedy in dialogue and acting.</P>
<P>     I read the short story this movie is based on, "Trucks" from
the NIGHT SHIF collection (still gathering dust in my garage) and
liked it.  I thought no way the movie could be as stupid as everyone
said--then I saw the movie.  Sometimes everyone is right.  No Stephen
King story has the embarrassing cliches of dialogue contained in
MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE.  It would be more suited to a poorly dubbed 50's
monster movie, or a parody thereof.</P>
<P>     Surprisingly enough, the premise is original and interesting:
Machines suddenly have a mind of their own and rebel against their
human owners.  Too bad the typewriter Stephen King wrote the MAXIMUM
OVERDRIVE screenplay on didn't hurl itself out the window.  The movie
is centered around a truckstop, where several country bumpkins are
trapped inside by a group of big rigs patrolling outside.</P>
<P>     King has no excuse this time.  Other stories of his have been
butchered on the way from the page to the screen.  King may not have
had any control over that.  This time we wrote the screenplay and
directed--and it's the worst King movie ever made, even worse than
GRAVEYARD SHIFT.  I've said it before and I'll say it again--Stephen
King should stick to writing and leave t he movies to the
professionals.</P>
<PRE>MISERY (1990) ***</PRE>
<P>     This Rob Reiner-directed film ranks among the best of the Stephen
King movie adaptations.  This one I have read the book on, and let me
tell you, the two are nothing alike.  It's as if two people were given
the same basic premise and were told to let their imaginations from
there, which is probably not that far off from what happened.</P>
<P>     The same basic premise--best-selling fiction writer Paul
Sheldon (James Caan) has a near-fatal accident during a blizzard and is
rescued by ex-nurse Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates), who he finds out is
his "#1 fan." He also finds out she's not quite right mentally once she
reads his latest manuscript, which contains too many "dirty birdie"
cuss words, and forces him to burn the only copy.  She later reads his
latest book, the last in a series of romance novels featuring Misery
Chastain, who is killed off at the novel's conclusion.  It turns out
Annie loves fictional Misery almost as much as Paul hates the
character.  She demands he resurrect her.  Paul, bedridden and trapped
alone with the crazy woman, must literally (literarily) write for his
life.</P>
<P>     That's what the two have in common.  The differences are too
numerous to mention.  Most notably, we find out Annie is crazy and
violent around page 20 of the book, while this information doesn't
surface until the second half of the movie.  Still, I'd recommend the
movie over the book (but if you have the yearning to take in both, go
right ahead--don't let my petty recommendations stop your fun), for
Kathy Bates' absolutely fabulous (isn't that a TV show?) performance.</P>
<P>     And if you're in the market for parodies, check out Comedy
Central (home of "Absolutely Fabulous") for airings of the "Saturday
Night Live" episode with "Misery II," featuring Roseanna as Dana
Carvey's #1 fan, who can't believe he's killed off the Church Lady.
>From those nostalgic days when "Saturday Night Live" was actually
funny.</P>
<PRE>'SALEM'S LOT: THE MOVIE (1979) *1/2</PRE>
<P>     The first made-for-TV Stephen King effort, which was originally
broadcast when I was one year old--and I probably would have liked it
better then.  Now it just seems boring ... and the video version has
almost an hour cut out from the original miniseries.</P>
<P>     David Soul of "Starsky and Hutch" fame (aren't you glad the
'SALEM'S LOT producers made sure to get a really big star for the lead
role?) plays a writer (It's always a writer in those Stephen King
stories) who goes back to his hometown, Jerusalem's Lot in Maine (it's
always Maine) to write a horror novel (it's always ... forget it), when
he stumbles upon some strange goings-on going on.  More specifically,
an old house and its strange owner.  Is that specific enough for you?
Fine, I'll just come right out and say it--The town is inhabited by
vampires.  Don't pay the money to rent this movie, because all you'll
find out is that everyone in this movie is a vampire.  Sorry, I don't
usually give away the plots of movies like that, but I just haven't
been the same since that freaky bat bit me on the neck.</P>
<P>THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION (1994) ***1/2</P>
<P>     It's hard to believe the same guy who wrote MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE and
GRAVEYARD SHIFT is also responsible for this dramatic, moving story of
an unjustly accused convict.  The author, of course, is venerable
horror novelist Stephen King (from the DIFFERENT SEASONS collection)
and, while it is by no means a horror story, it does contain several
elements of the macabre.  THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is the best movie
based on a King story, though it's not my favorite (IT receives that
honor.  There is a difference between "favorite" and "best," but don't
ask me to explain it), and is very true to the original novella, which
I did read.  It's not gathering dust in my gar age like NIGHT SHIFT; I
checked it out of the library.  Yes, there are still such things as
libraries.</P>
<P>     The two-and-a-half hour running time allows for a significant
amount of details and characters to be added to the foundation of the
novella.  Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a rich banker, is convicted of
murder (he's innocent, of course, but a series of unfortunate
coincidences incriminate him) and sent to Shawshank prison, where he is
tortured and raped (that makes two nominees for Best Picture in 1994
with anal rape scenes) by the "sisters" (no offense, Elton).</P>
<P>     He soon becomes friends with Morgan Freeman, the man who can "get
you things" and serves as the narrator from King's novella.  Andy also
becomes the warden's pet, as he is the only inmate who can offer
investment advice and money laundering expertise, and soon is doing
taxes for every guard in the prison.  All the while, there's a dark,
under lying tension, as Andy finds proof of his innocence in the form
of a young, uneducated inmate, and we find out how a man can become
"institutionalized" to the point where he can't survive on the
outside.</P>
<P>     Stephen King can write more than just horror.  Shawshank is an
intelligent human drama that plays on the emotions without ever
succumbing to sappiness (King is way above being sappy).  I proudly
give it my wholehearted endorsement.  Geez, you'd think this was a
letter of recommendation instead of a movie review.</P>
<PRE>THE SHINING (1974) **1/2</PRE>
<P>     I've got this thing about horror movies--I usually don't like them
unless the words Friday and 13th are in the title.  Actually, this
one's not too bad.  Forget the fact that it's almost two-and-a-half
hours long, doesn't make any sense, and only two people die during the
whole movie.  So why do I like it?  I haven't really figured that part
out yet.  I think most of it has to do with Jack Nicholson's portrayal
of a writer gone insane.  Even without his nine-iron, Jack's still
really scary.  Of course, I've been scared by the Pillsbury dough boy
before, so don't take my word for it.</P>
<P>     This movie is based on a Stephen King novel, but for some odd
reason, the director removed all the parts that explain what's going
on, so the movie doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.  But don't
take my word for it.  It was hard for me to follow the plot of ERNEST
GOES TO JAIL, too.</P>
<PRE>SILVER BULLET (1985) **1/2</PRE>
<P>     Another fairly entertaining slasher movie based on a Stephen King
book.  This one's about a small town terrorized by a werewolf (I hear
it's based on a true story...) and the kid in a wheelchair who must
stop it.  And, as with many other horror movies, we see the "evil
preacher" stereotype as well as a whole lot of graphic violence.</P>
<P>     I tell you, only in the 80's would they have disembodied heads
fly through the air aimlessly.  But it's a pretty good movie, with no
sex or nudity, a plus to parents like mine who couldn't care less about
bloody heads but go nuts whenever anyone starts holding hands
on-screen.</P>
