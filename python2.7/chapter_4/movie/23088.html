<P>Starring Matthew Perry, Bruce Willis, Rosanna Arquette, Michael Clarke
Duncan, Natasha Henstrige, Toni Colette. Directed by Jonathan Lynn.
Rated R.</P>
<P>The Whole Nine Yards is a sublime semi-romantic caper comedy,
cartoonishly convoluted but (more or less) consistently hilarious.
Aside from a rare comedic performance by Bruce Willis, this is mostly
stuff we've seen before. But director Jonathan Lynn, who literally cut-
and-pasted the premise from his own 1992 hit My Cousin Vinny into the
1997 comedy Trial and Error and made it work, has a flair for bringing
old ideas into a fresh light. The secret to this movie's success isn't
the plot, which is contrived and rather absurd, but likable
performances and a funny, energetic script.</P>
<P>Friends's Matthew Perry plays Nick Ozaransky, a very unhappily married
dentist living in Quebec. One day Nick realizes that the person who
just moved in next door to him is actually Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski
(Willis), a notorious contract killer. Jimmy has a price on his head
himself: Chicago gangster Yanni Gogolack (Kevin Pollack) wants Jimmy
dead for killing his father. Nick's antichrist of a wife ships him off
to Chicago to rat Jimmy out to Yanni and collect the finder's fee.</P>
<P>In Chicago, Nick meets up with Frankie Figs (The Green Mile's Michael
Clarke Duncan), an associate of Yanni. He is instructed to go back to
Canada with Frankie and help kill Tudeski. But The Tulip has plans of
his own. You see, Nick's wife wants Nick dead so she looks around for a
good hit man; in the process, she tells Jimmy what Nick is doing in
Chicago. When Gogolack and his gang arrive, Jimmy will be waiting.</P>
<P>But of course a movie like this would not be complete without a love
subplot so Nick falls for Jimmy's wife. The kicker is that Jimmy, his
wife, and Yanni have a collective 10 million dollars lying in a bank.
To claim the money, they need the signatures of the three people, two
signatures and a death certificate or one signature and two death
certificates. Thus, Jimmy wants to kill both Yanni and his wife,
claiming all the money for himself. Lovesick Nick can't let that
happen, of course, but can he really do anything about it?</P>
<P>There's a whole lot going on here, even more than I cared to explain,
and not all of it makes sense. But The Whole Nine Yards tackles its
plot with such unapologetically cheerful gusto that you can't help but
like it. It's hard to tell whether the film is aware of its own
absurdity and is winking slyly as it takes its goofy script and runs
with it or whether it has no idea and just doesn't care but I'm leaning
towards the latter. It never seems to flinch, back away or make
excuses; it just romps its way through the story.</P>
<P>Matthew Perry has made a career of always playing the straight man, the
one person remaining rational when everyone around him goes loony. He's
done it in his tv show, the underrated 1999 movie Three To Tango and is
continuing that trend here. I never seem to get sick of his sarcastic,
cynical style; the actor can do more with subtle gestures and facial
expressions than some comedians can with a rubber face or a script full
of monologues. His masterful comic delivery can make even slightly lame
one-liners riotous.</P>
<P>Playing alongside Perry is Bruce Willis, an actor not known to do comic
roles which is a shame. His performance here is superior to almost any
given pre-Sixth Sense role he's taken. Willis's Jimmy Tudeski is the
polar opposite of Perry's Nick, a wry, smug, almost omnipotent criminal
ready to kill at the blink of an eye and Willis plays him perfectly,
often underplaying scenes thereby making his character creepily
volatile as well as funny.</P>
<P>There's a scene in The Whole Nine Yards in which Willis and Perry are
standing on a moving boat. Perry is astonished about something that I
will not reveal and the unperturbed Willis throws him a beer. Perry is
far too ruffled to catch it and the beer flies on by and off the boat.
A lesser movie might have lingered on this admittedly funny gag and
killed the joke. But without so much as a pause, The Whole Nine Yards
just continues on its merry way.</P>
