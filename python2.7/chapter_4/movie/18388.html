<P>   There may be some good reasons for living in a
picturesque small town but you'd never know this from seeing
"The Love Letter."  A film about a sleepy burg whose drowsy,
if eccentric, beings are awakened by an anonymous billet
doux, "The Love Letter" is so slight, so insipid, that a viewer
can scarcely find much therein to love or hate. Just a
spoonful of sugar less sweet than "Message in a Bottle," at
least director Peter Ho-Sun Chan's movie based on a novel
by Maria Cathleen Schine and adapted for the screen by
Maria Maggenti, does not take itself seriously.  Even Ellen
DeGeneres--who once again steals every scene she is in--
appears to sleepwalk her way through the tale, or at least
appears to do so when you compare her performance with
her work in "EdTV."</P>
<P>   "The Love Letter" borrows a technique used so
successfully in works from playwrights from Plautus through
Shakespeare and beyond--mistaken identity with the comic
and romantic touches that can emerge from such deception. 
The enigma in question centers on a mysterious writer,
although his or her identity (revealed in the final moments) is
not important.  What is consequential is the buried feelings
that some of the most unlikely characters possess and how
the possibility of having a secret admirer makes residents of
Loblolly, Massachusetts (actually filmed in that state's town of
Rockport) spring to life.</P>
<P>   When the owner of the town's bookstore, Helen (Kate
Capshaw), receives an unsigned, typewritten note professing
love, she assumes the dispatch is directed to her and begins
to fantasy who might be preoccupied with thoughts of her. 
When people speak to her in everyday terms, she imagines
their declaring unbridled passion.  She leaves the note by
a wine bottle where it is picked up by her dinner guest and
summer assistant, the twenty-year-old Johnny (Tom Everett
Scott), who is certain that the letter is Helen's and that it is
directed to him.  Gradually the note finds its way into the
hands of a few others in Loblolly with similar effects.  Among
the consequences is that a budding romance between Helen
and the town's firefighter, George (Tom Selleck) is rekindled,
but not before Helen works her way through a brief,
passionate affair with Johnny, who is twenty years or so her
junior.  In one swift month Helen turns from a stable, if
unfulfilled bookseller, to the bemused object of a triangular
relationship.  In the process she discovers a surprising secret
about her mother, Lillian (Blythe Danner) as well, and
uncovers a post card from an old shoebox which, if carefully
read some years back, would have dramatically altered her
life.</P>
<P>   At best, "The Love Letter" could provide for a career-
making opportunity for Tom Everett Scott, heretofore known
to the public only for cutesy roles in movies like Tom Hanks's
"That Thing You Do" and teen horror circuit adventures like
"Dead Man on Campus."  The story telling is for the most
part linear and conventional with Tami Reiker's camera failing
to exploit much quaintness is the town of Rockport.  Nor does
Ms. Reiker's camerawork paint a flattering portrait of Kate
Capshaw, whose wan acting cannot make a case for an
April-September affair with a college kid.  In her small role
Blythe Danner puts most of the remainder of the cast to
shame by her mere presence, as veteran Tom Selleck
appears so unenthusiastic in his pursuit of Capshaw's
character that his affection for her is even less convincing
than is hers for young Scott.  Finally, Bill Buell's cartoonish
performance as a keystone cop puts could put the lid on
tourism to Rockport.</P>
