<PRE>                               LITTLE ODESSA
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A deliberate and atmospheric look at
          a Russian-Jewish family in the Brighton Beach
          community of Brooklyn.  The Shapira family's
          disintegration is hastened by the return of Joshua,
          a son who is a contract killer for the Russian
          Mafia.  Younger brother Reuben is also turning to
          crime and the influence of his brother is only
          hastening the process.  This is a dark and
          provocative film.  Rating: high +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Joshua Shapira is back in Brighton Beach.  This is not necessarily
good news for his family.  Joshua's parents came from Russia to Little
Odessa, the Russian Jewish section of Brighton Beach, Brooklyn many
years ago and raised two sons, Joshua and Reuben.  Years ago Joshua
fell in with the organizatsya (Russian Mafia), committed a contract
killing, and fled.  Now he is back for another contract kill.  He wants
to come and go unnoticed by his family, but his younger brother Reuben
hears of his presence and arranges to contact Joshua.  Reuben has
already been skipping school for weeks and hiding the fact from his
parents.  Now he is drawn to the influence of his brother.  Rueben's
father Arkady must try to hold on to his son, but his position is badly
compromised by his own long-standing affair with an immigrant woman.
What follows is not so much the morality play it might sound, but a
bleak and at times violent story of crime in a community that has not
been portrayed in film before.</P>
<P>     The dark spirit of this film is underscored by dim or occasionally
harsh lighting.  In addition, while the film is in English, some of the
dialogue in Yiddish and Russian and not all of the Yiddish is
translated for the audience, occasionally adding to the dark tone of
the film.</P>
<P>     LITTLE ODESSA was written and directed by twenty-five--year-old
James Gray, who already has a very sure hand at directing and has
assembled a surprisingly well-known cast for so young a director's
first film.  Reuben Shapira is played by Edward Furlong, probably best
known from TERMINATOR II, but he also was the main character in A HOME
OF OUR OWN.  Joshua Shapira is played by Tim Roth, who already has a
distinguished career playing creeps of various sorts including the
effete but ruthless Cunningham in ROB ROY and the restaurant-robbing
"Honey-Bunny" in PULP FICTION.  His Joshua is a mass of contradictions,
loving his family but as ready to reach for his gun and point it
between a victim's eyes as he would be to reach for a house key and put
it in a lock.  Maximilian Schell plays Arkady, the immigrant father who
just cannot relate to his two sons.  When they were just small children
he read them CRIME AND PUNISHMENT.  Neither of his sons can respond to
his Old World intellectualism and neither can summon much respect for
him.  Also present in the cast are Moira Kelly and Vanessa Redgrave,
the latter as the main characters' mother dying of cancer.</P>
<P>     One false move seems to be the music assembled by Dana Sano.  It
draws heavily on Russian source music, but much of that is choral
music.  Somehow this conjures up images of the Russian Orthodox Church
and just does not feel like the music of the Russian Jewish community.
While I am willing to be corrected, I suspect that this music would be
no more popular with Russian Jewish immigrants than with any other
immigrants from any other part of Europe.</P>
<P>     LITTLE ODESSA is a complex and disturbing film with a dark tone.
It may have a teenage main character, but it is not a film for young
audiences.  There is a good deal of violence in the film, but it is
more implied than shown and there is very little blood.  This film gets
a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
