<P>   As I stated in a recent review, Joan Baez--hardly a woman
to stay at home--used to love to sing Marty Tipton's lyrics to
an Appalachian folk song during the seventies: "Hard is the
fortune of all womankind,/ She's always controlled, she's
always confined,/ Controlled by her parents until she's a
wife,/ A slave to her husband for the rest of her life." 
Evidently she had not see the movie "Heartbreakers,"
definitive proof that women are the stronger gender.  But if
Ms. Baez wants confirmation of her theory, she need only go
today to Iran where she would find the fair sex treated only
slightly better than its counterparts in Afghanistan.</P>
<P>  In the vision of director Marzieh Meshkini--whose husband,
Mohsen Makmalbaf wrote the strikingly realized script--
women in Iran have every right to be appalled by their
treatment.  While the film does not bring out the Iranian
tradition that holds if your firstborn is a girl, you are consoled
with the thought, "May your next be a boy," "The Day I
Became a Woman" makes one thing clear through Ebraheem
Gahfouri and Shahrzad Pouya's photography on the touristic
island of Kish.  Hard is the fortune of all (Iranian) womankind. 
"The Day" is a trilogy, its loose connection becoming clear
only in the final moments, featuring the same person as a
nine-year-old girl, as a married twenty-something, and finally
as a very old woman.  While their names are different, they
are metaphorically the same person: Havva, or Eve
dominates the first segment as the woman who, like her Old
Testament counterpart, loses her freedom; Ahoo (Gazelle),
like the fleet-footed quadraped, attempts to regain her
independence; and Houra (Black-Eyed Beauty), now in her
eighties, looks back forlornly on her unemancipated life and
tries without much hope to make up for seven futile decades.</P>
<P>   In Episode One, Havva (Fatemeh Cheragh Akhtar--who is
like almost all of Ms. Meshkini's characters a non-
professional performer)--has awakened on her ninth birthday,
which is not the happy affair enjoyed by most American girls
her age.  She has just become a woman, according to her
grandmother (Ameneh Passand) and mother (Shahr Banou
Sisizadeh) and is therefore no longer allowed to play with her
boy friend (Hassan Nabehan).  In fact she must now cover
her head with a chador, the traditional Iranian garb (in much
the way that an Orthodox Jewish boy after his Bar Mitzvah
must now drape himself with a tallis).  But it's 11 a.m. and
her mom allows one final hour of childhood since she was
born at noon, so Eve takes a stick to measure the sun's
shadow on the beach and goes off to share a lollipop with the
boy.</P>
<P>  In Episode Two, Ahoo (Shabnam Toloui) is engaged in a
bike race across the only area that women are allowed to ride
what some men call The Devil's Mount--a bike path along the
Kish oceanfront.  She is chased first by her husband (Cyrus
Kahouri Nejad), then by the local religious leader, and finally
by a bunch of guys who belong to her clan.  The men advise
her to get off the bike and go home--that she is disgracing
the family name.  Should she refuse, the husband will divorce
her on the spot--and believe it or not, it is much much easier
for a man to get a divorce in Iran than it is for an American in
any state of the union.</P>
<P>  In the final episode--which features the most surreal,
Felliniesque scene I've seen in any modern Iranian picture--
an old woman (Azizeh Seddighi) has come into some money
and is off on a shopping spree, having hired a kid (Badr
Irouni Nejad) to push her wheelchair around an amazingly
slick and modern bazaar on the island.  She assembles a
refrigerator, washing machine, and some furniture on the
beach for transport into the sea.  In this metaphoric finale,
the nine-year-old Eve, now transformed into a crone, sees
her life as one of quiet desperation.  She is looked upon as
men look upon all women in Iran--as fit consumers but not as
producers.  (In fact in a splendid case of life's reflecting art
and vice versa, filmmaker Meshkini has stated in interviews
that the life of a female director is not easy--that a woman
must work overtime to gain the respect and confidence of the
male crew).</P>
<P>   The movie faced a strange irony in its creation.  The nine-
man censorship board seems to have had no problem
approving the movie's motif, which is the desperation of
women, arguing only about the sucking of the lollipop by two
nine-year-olds in the opening segment.  Too erotic!  While
many viewers consider the second episode the best, the most
heartbreaking, I'd vote for the third with its remarkable sense
of whimsy.  The scene of Black-Eyed Beauty loaded with
consumer goods on the beach while the boys "plug in" the
washing machine and refrigerator to clean their clothes and
drink the sodas--a knockout!  But then, so is this entire work. 
Seems that the best films nowadays are coming out of that
beguiling Near Eastern country, paradoxically labeled a rogue
nation by the U.S. yet giving rise to artists who are so
talented, so subtle, so deeply explorative of the human
condition.</P>
<P>   As I was leaving the screening room I overheard a woman
say to her male friend, "Isn't it weird that the women's
liberation movement [I think she meant the most recent
example that began during the 1970s] began in the U.S. and
France, where women were already the most liberated in the
world?"  "Not at all," I would have told her if I felt like
intruding.  Revolutions begins when people see possibilities. 
When a group are completely repressed, you don't have a
liberation movement.  I believe Iran today, given the election
four years ago of a so-called moderate president (reasonable,
that is, in comparison with the fanatical mullahs, or religious
leaders), offers real hope for women.  The mere existence of
"The Day I Became a Woman" is evidence.</P>
