<P>American pseudo-remake of Wim Wenders' classic film WINGS OF DESIRE,
spots Nicolas Cage as an angel, and Meg Ryan as a heart surgeon.
Director Brad Silberling's previous feature was CASPER in 1995.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Seth (Cage) is an angel placed on Earth to help those in need. One day,
he unwillingly "falls in love" with a heart surgeon named Maggie
(Ryan). Henceforth, he must decide whether or not he wants to remain an
angel, or "transform" himself into a human (the two are mutually
exclusive).</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Flighty angelic tale that never really gathers any steam, runs a tad
too long, and is just plain boring. This movie had no surprises
(correction, the film had one surprise...they didn't use the word
"angel" once during the entire picture...pretty neat), no visible
chemistry between the two leads, and no great insight into  Hollywood's
saturated topic of angels. On top of all that, the romance in this film
is weak, the narrative is slow and the folksy score is annoying. Other
than that...it was amazing !! (this is sarcastic, people).</P>
<P>Nicolas Cage is one of my favourite actors of all time, but I just
can't seem to understand his choice of roles since his incredible turn
in LEAVING LAS VEGAS (8.5/10). He's walked through a couple of
one-dimensional action roles, and now this! All he does in this flick
is walk around with a pasty face, glassy eyes, and "feel sorry for me"
look on his face. What happened to the guy we all learned to love in
RAISING ARIZONA (8/10) and VAMPIRE'S KISS (7.5/10) ? Meg Ryan is
allright, but all she has to do is smile and cry on cue, which
incidentally, she does extremely well.</P>
<P>Overall, this movie is quite slow, boring, and long in running time. A
couple of songs on the soundtrack are good (especially the Alanis
Morisette and GooGoo Doll tunes), but a couple of slick hits does not a
"romantic picture" make. Dennis Franz is also effective as the comic
relief, and there were a couple of nice panoramic shots, but then
again, who cares. The story never pulled me in, the drawn out scenes
never grabbed my interest, and the icky ending just stamped this movie
DOA. That's it. What can I tell you? Watch it if you're bored, and need
a rest or something. Otherwise, steer clear from this dog and go rent
Nicolas Cage's superb romantic comedy HONEYMOON IN VEGAS (8/10). You
won't regret it !!</P>
<P>Little Known Facts: 
Nicolas Cage's real name is Nicolas Coppola. He got Cage from Luke
Cage, the comic book character.
He's nephew to the director of the infamous GODFATHER trilogy, Francis
Ford Coppola (who incidentally once acknowledged JoBlo at the 1996
Cannes Film Festival with a wave of the right hand). 
Nic's one-time passion for method acting reached a personal limit when
he smashed a street-vendor's remote-control car to achieve the sense of
rage needed for his gangster character in THE COTTON CLUB. He also got
Johnny Depp his first acting job.
Cage proposed to Patricia Arquette on the day he met her in the early
80s. Arquette thought he was a bit strange but played along with his
antics by creating a list of things Cage would have to fulfil to win
her. When he started to work his way through the list, Arquette got
scared and avoided him. They met again many years later and later went
on to marry.
Meg Ryan's real name is Margaret Mary Emily Anne Hyra, she stands 5"8,
and is presently married to actor Dennis Quaid.</P>
