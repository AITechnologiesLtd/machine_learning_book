<PRE>                                SCHOOL TIES
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1992 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  In 1955 an elite New England prep
     school recruits a ringer quarterback who happens to be a Jew.
     When the secret that he is a Jew leaks out, we get a view of
     the "old boy" system and the bigotry beneath the surface.
     Rating: low +2 [-4 to +4].</PRE>
<P>     In 1955 St. Matthews is an extremely elite private prep school in New
England.  Graduate from St. Matthews and you are practically assured that
you will make it into an Ivy League college and go on to a distinguished or
at least comfortable career.  One of the students sums up the philosophy of
life at St. Matthews: "We do the things they tell us to and they give us the
good life."  But there is something that St. Matthews finds most
distressing.  For three years straight they have lost the big football game
to their rival school and the alumni are tired of it.  So the school has
broken the code.  They have let the coach recruit a ringer, a great high
school quarterback as well as an excellent scholar even if the boy is,
unfortunately, a Jew.  But David Greene (played by Brendan Fraser) has been
cautioned by his father and his new coach to let his religion remain his
little secret.</P>
<P>     Where DEAD POETS SOCIETY is about the pressures of posh prep schools
and the wondrous joy of learning English literature, SCHOOL TIES is about
the pressures and the dark underside of blooming bigotry and the old boy
system for preserving class barriers.  It is dark in tone, dark in
photography, and a much more real film than is DEAD POETS SOCIETY.  Greene
has been given mixed signals by his father (played by Ed Lauter, cast very
counter to type).  His father has told him to fit in, but also to maintain
his religious traditions.  At first, there is little anti-Semitism: a
comment here, a joke there.  Greene turns out to be a great student and a
superb athlete and just the kind of guy that everyone wants to be friends
with, including the visiting girls.  It is, in fact, a fault of  Dick Wolf's
or Darryl Ponicsan's script that Greene is just a little too good to be
believed.  But when tensions do arise through no fault of Greene's and the
secret of his religion is revealed, his classmates show their cliquishness
and religious bigotry.</P>
<P>     Music was provided by Maurice Jarre (and, yes, there is a brief scene
of a train).  Jarre's score is a bit more somber than his DEAD POETS SOCIETY
score.  Similarly, the camerawork is also somber and casts a grayish tinge
through the film.  Photography is by Freddie Francis--perhaps the greatest
cinemagraphic stylist alive.  His style lets him down only during the
football scenes where he uses cliched slow motion  and repeated motion.  The
film is directed by Robert Mandel.</P>
<P>     Minor flaws in the script--including the Jewish boy being just a bit
too perfect and also an unsatisfying climactic scene--rob what could have
been a great film, but still leave a very good film.  I rate SCHOOL TIES a
low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
