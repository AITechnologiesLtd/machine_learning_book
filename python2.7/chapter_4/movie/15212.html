<P>   While I'm entering words into the computer, I know I'm not
dreaming.  How do I know?  I can ask myself, "Am I
dreaming?" and decide rationally that I am not.  But when I'm
dreaming, I rarely have the free will to ask myself this
question, and so I think I'm living in reality despite the illusion
of it all.  Illusion vs. reality is one of the great themes of
storytellers and in "The Shattered Image" director Raul Ruiz
pushes the envelope by having his principal character, Jessie
(Anne Parillaud), confused to the point of insanity about
which of her two sides is the real Jessie.  She dreams she is
a hard-featured hired killer who preys on men, a hit woman
doing her job for women who want to dispose of their
masculine baggage.  Or is the leathery-looking assassin the
real Jessie and the soft, vulnerable, victimized Jessie her
dream?  As the two sides of the same woman collide with
each other, a harsh sound like a gunshot or the ring of a
telephone or the shattering of glass brings one Jessie up
sharply and turns her into the other. </P>
<P>   A major motif of "Shattered Image" is the absence of
dramatic irony.  The audience, instead of being a step or two
ahead of the characters (as in the "Oedipus" legend) is kept
as much in the dark as the principal character, the enigma
finally revealed in the concluding moments to Jessie and to
the movie audience simultaneously.</P>
<P>   This is not the conventional whodunit, as Agatha Christie
might have constructed the drama, but is done rather in the
French style, which compared to the American form is paced
more leisurely with greater emphasis on psychology than on
action.  It's quite an intriguing piece which might remind film
buffs of the late Kryzstof Kieslowski's even more cryptic "The
Double Life of Veronique," in which two women, one Polish
and one French, subtly affect each other's lives while
remaining total strangers.</P>
<P>   Duane Poole's script opens on the stony-faced contract
killer, Jessie (Anne Parillaud), who sits at a night-club table
ignoring the martini that a trio of businessmen have sent over
to her, but who follows one of them into the men's room to
complete her part of a contract.  Director Ruiz soon shifts to
another Jessie, a kinder and gentler woman, who has met a
handsome young man under strange conditions and is on an
expensive honeymoon in Jamaica with her new husband,
Brian (William Baldwin).  Brian is an understanding man
indeed, nursing his bride through some troubled, paranoid
times in which she obsesses over an incident in which she
was attacked by a rapist who was chased away by Brian--a
modern knight in shining armor.  Having survived several
suicide attempts, she lives through her traumatic experience
not by recalling the incident directly but via nightmares in
which she has become the femme fatale, the hired
executioner.  Or is it the other way around?</P>
<P>   You may remember Anne Parillaud as the title character of
Luc Besson's 1990 French-Italian film "La Femme Nikita"--
which was successfully remade American style starring
Bridget Fonda and which became a successful TV series. 
The Chilean-born director, Raul Ruiz, patterns his picture in
the European manner, allowing the plot to unwind ever-so-
slowly and tantalizingly in his second American-made, English
language feature.  (In 1990 he shot "The Golden Boat in New
York with a 16mm camera and black-and-white film).  The
prolific and gifted regisseur turned out "Genealogies of a
Crime" last year with a similar strain, highlighting Catherine
Deneuve in a dual role as the lawyer for and victim of a
strange young man who's accused of murdering his
psychiatrist aunt after she allegedly subjected him to radical
mind-control treatments.  Paired characters--a "which twin is
the phony"--is always a enticing motif.  Ruiz fruitfully utilizes
the concept to match polar opposites--concerned husband vs.
knavish cur; hard-hearted woman vs. unprotected prey; the
warm, tropical ambience of Jamaica with the foggy, cold and
rainy Seattle; sophisticated jazz with island reggae.  </P>
<P>   Shot in Port Antonio, Jamaica, and Vancouver, Raul Ruiz's
"Shattered Image" is likely to find its audience among
sophisticated moviegoers who relish the puzzlement raised by
the picture with each shift in focus.</P>
