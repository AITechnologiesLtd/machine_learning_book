<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>

Written by: Jonathan Lynn, John Landis</PRE>
<P>It's the 1950's, the height of McCarthyism, and six strangers have been 
invited to a mansion in middle of nowhere, New England. The strangers are 
Colonel Mustard (Martin Mull), whose mother's health is questionable and who 
drives an expensive car for a man on a Colonel's pay; Mrs. White (Madeline 
Kahn), who has had many husbands, both her's and other womens'; Professor 
Plum (Christopher Lloyd), who works with the paranoid delusional folks at 
the UN; Mrs. Peacock (Eileen Brennan), who does her senator husband's dirty 
work; The timid, accident prone Mr. Green (Michael McKean); and Mis Scarlett 
(Lesley Ann Warren), who has helped men find the company of a young lady for 
a short while. These six strangers all have one thing in common, they're all 
being blackmailed. They have been invited to the mansion by Wadsworth (Tim 
Curry), the butler, to meet Mr. Boddy (Lee Ving), who knows something about 
each of them that they don't want made public. The plan is to confront Mr. 
Boddy and make him stop blackmailing them. Unfortunately, things don't go 
quite as planned, and Mr. Boddy is soon dead. With only the six guests, 
Wadsworth, and the maid, Yvette (Colleen Camp) in the house, they now have 
to determine who killed Mr. Boddy, where, and with what.</P>
<P>I have to admit, I'm a big fan of the "Clue" board game from Parker 
Brothers. It's probably because I love mysteries, and "Clue" is the closest 
I can get to solving one in real life without getting shot at. So, I'll get 
this out of the way right now. As a mystery film, director Jonathan Lynn's 
("The Whole Nine Yards") "Clue" fails miserably. I'll let your gasps of 
disbelief subside. Okay, how can a movie called "Clue" fail as a mystery? 
Because the writers thought up an interesting little idea where there are 
three endings. Since there are three different endings, and thus different 
killers, there is no way to guess who the killer is. Afterall, if you guess 
it right in one ending you're wrong in the other two. So if "Clue" fails as 
a mystery, why did I give it a four star rating? Because it succeeds on 
every level as a comedy. All the various types of comedy are used in the 
movie (except that irritating romantic kind) to full effect. We get a 
healthy dose of slapstick, with people running into each other and various 
objects. We also get some great banter, particularly in a scene where 
Colonel Mustard is grilling Wadsworth about who is in the house. We even get 
some satire in a scene which takes a jab at Agatha Christie's "Murder on the 
Orient Express".</P>
<P>Obviously a film like this is going to be entirely dependent on two factors: 
the script, and the actors. I'll get into the script in a minute, so let's 
cover the actors. Tim Curry ("Legend") leads the cast with a manic, 
over-the-top performance like you've never seen (unless you're a fan of John 
Lithgow). The performance is, in fact, so manic that Curry is sweating and 
out of breath during a few scenes. Sounds like a painful thing to watch, 
right? Strangely enough, it's not at all. His manic performance fits the 
part so well, you can't picture Wadsworth being played in any other way. The 
other cast members display great comic abilities, but two stick out in my 
mind as turning in really memorable performances. Martin Mull ("Mrs. 
Doubtfire"), playing the dim-witted Colonel Mustard, has some of the best 
comic timing I've ever seen. He even manages to pull some humor out of an 
otherwise stupid scene where Miss Scarlett says, "Search me" and he proceeds 
to frisk her. The other stand out is, obviously, the late, great Madeline 
Kahn ("Blazing Saddles"). This great woman could make anything funny, and 
when she gets truly funny dialogue she's a riot. My favorite scene with her 
is one where Colonel Mustard says, "There is only one admitted killer here 
and it is not me, it is her!" Madeline backs away, panic in her eyes, and 
says, "I've admitted nothing."</P>
<P>The biggest point in this movie's favor is certainly the hysterical script 
from Lynn and John Landis ("The Blues Brothers"). I'd say no more than three 
minutes go by at a time before we get hit between the eyes by another 
uproarious joke. Some of my favorites are Wadsworth re-creating the crime 
using Mr. Green as a prop; Mrs. Peacock expressing her fear that the brandy 
is poisoned; and the revelation of what each person is being blackmailed 
for. This is also the kind of movie you'll find yourself quoting for weeks, 
months, even years after you've seen it. For example, whenever anyone says 
"To make a long story short," I still say "Too late." What really makes the 
comedy work is that Lynn and Landis never re-use jokes till we're tired of 
them. Even the funniest lines and scenes are only used twice at the most. 
These are guys who know how to avoid wearing out their welcome. The other 
way the avoid wearing out their welcome is by changing the types of jokes. 
You'll seldom get several slapstick jokes in a row, you're more likely to 
get a couple slapstick jokes, a scene of great banter, a snappy one liner or 
two, and then maybe some really dark humor (watch for the singing telegram 
girl for a great example of that). I wish modern comic writers would try 
this approach rather than throwing ten gross-out jokes at us in a row.</P>
<P>The primary reason I've decided to go back and review a movie like "Clue" is 
because I recently got it on DVD. The disc's special features may be rather 
limited, but it does contain the theatrical trailer. Why do I point this 
out? Because for some reason there are a few scenes on the trailer not 
contained in the film. Normally these sorts of cuts make perfect sense since 
they aren't funny, but these scenes were really quite good. For example, Mr. 
Green is screaming and Colonel Mustard slaps him across the face. Colonel 
Mustard: "Why are you screaming?!" Mr. Green: "Because I'm frightened!" 
Colonel Mustard: "Of what?" Mr. Green: "Screaming!" Trust me, it sounds much 
funnier when Michael McKean says it. Clue's soundtrack is a pleasant 
combination of old, fifties songs ("Shake, Rattle, and Roll" for example) 
and a lively little musical number composed by John Morris ("Dirty 
Dancing"). "Clue" runs a nice, quick 97 minutes, and I actually wouldn't 
have minded it being a touch longer. I'd recommend the movie to those who 
enjoy eighties style comedies, and to fans of both Tim Curry and Madeline 
Kahn since both really shine here and give it four out of five stars. If you 
enjoy "Clue", I'd also recommend going back and checking out Neil Simon's 
"Murder by Death" from 1976.</P>
