<PRE>RATING: 10/10</PRE>
<P>In our time a good science fiction film is a rare artifact and a true
treasure. The essence, the heart of the genre, the endless possibilities of
imagination are now replaced with primitive action sequences and impressive
special effects. The result is that the genre (especially in the 90s) has
become a synonimum for dumb and predictable "popcorn films". That is why we
have to look back at the time passed to find good science fiction films.
Every genre has its masterpieces. And "Blade Runner" is one of them. As a
falling star it has lit up the sky, opening new ways of science fiction by
defining its own genre.</P>
<P>Not since Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" has it been such a complex,
thought provoking  and sophisticated science fiction film. It is a strangely
compelling and humanistic detective story, set in L.A., year 2019. Humanity
has expanded far beyond the Earth, engaged in the eternal quest for new
frontiers. Those left behind are too old, infirm, poor or stubborn to escape
for the off-world colonies; they're stuck with the dregs of civilization, as
represented by a gloomy, rain-sodden Los Angeles. The only flies in the
ointment are artificial humans, colloquially known as replicants, deployed
in the most hazardous of environments. These artificial humans are designed
to serve man, by doing all the "dirty" and dangerous work, such as warfare
and collonisation of other planets. In their latest incarnation, Nexus 6,
these replicants have surpassed their makers, a moment of transition. On
Earth rogue replicants are outlawed, a hazard that demands execution. So
when a replicant unit is discovered in LA, the police assign their blade
runner division to the clean-up operation. It seems that the replicants are
trying to infiltrate the Tyrell Corporation, the monolithic entity that
built them, presided over by genius Eldon Tyrell (Joseph Turrkel). Rick
Decard (Harrison Ford) is one of the unfortunate blade runners, that are
stuck on earth, forced into taking up the chase.</P>
<P>"Blade Runner" is a brilliant analyses of the earth, human kind, its
development and evolution. An interesting fact is that Chinese has become
the new main language, since the world is mostly populated by the oriental
population. The world of the future is cold, dark and unfriendly. It is a
time of decay, fear, trash,neon and promises of clean air, blue waters and
green grass. The film also presents a great deal of dazzling special effects
and some of the most original art direction I have ever seen. From the very
beginning of the film we see the grand skyscrapers and buildings that arise
from the dark, almost dead soil. The art director has been inspired by the
Mayan and Egyptian architecture, combining it with Ultra modern art design.
The result is mesmerizing and wonderfully imaginative, and yet never
completely alien.</P>
<P>Director Ridley Scott has transformed Philip K. Dick's novel 'Do Androids
Dream of Electric Sheep?' beyond recognition. Along side with screenwriters
Hampton Fancher and David Peoples, he uses his ideas as a philosophical
launching pad. The film takes place in the middle of a silent war between
humans and artificial humans. Through the film both sides pose the very same
global questions: who am I? where am I going? This leads the audience to
concider the very essence of humanity itself. What makes us human? Memories?
Sentience? Thoughts? Ideas? Feelings? Does it really matter if they ar
artificial? And if they are, does it make them less human? This is all
thought provoking and original material that has been copied throughout the
years. Surprisingly enough, the film loose as fresh and original as at its
premiere in 1982.</P>
<P>The cast, consisting of 10 cast members, is nothing less than fabulous.
Harrison Ford is believable as the sad and quite Deckard - angry, hurt and
vulnerable. Forced to stay on earth, with no choice but to hunt for the
replicants. Falling in a certain apathy, he feels that he has absolutely
nothing to live for. His love interest, played by Sean Young, portrays
innocence and vulnerability, warmth and consideration, projecting an image
of what we concider humanity. When she turns out to be a replicant, we are
forced to pose the basic question: what makes us human? Rutger Huer, as the
leader of the rebel replicants, is the most captivating. He is charismatic
via lyricism, some memorable lines ("All those memories will be lost in
time..like tears in the rain.."), but mostly by his pationate nature and
desperate love of life. Off course  there are some characters in this film
that are created to give a more vivid and live image of future society. The
ingenious creator of the replicants, Dr.Eldon Tyrel (Joseph Turel) is a
cold, sinister character that became corrupted by the opportunity of playing
God. Another interesting character is J.F.Sebastion, a previously attractive
and respected genetic designer, he is now suffering of a terrible illness
that stops him from moving to the Off-world colonies. Living in almost
complete isolation, he makes his own friends, creatures that resemble
characters from fairytales and sagas, so that he won't feel alone. There are
many bizarre characters and events in the film that make it more interesting
and captivating. The fabulous cinematography by Jordan Cronenweth, combined
with Richard Hart's lightning frames the characters and the story in beauty
and imagination. All are the part of the warmly , symbolic whole, a mood
enchanted by Vangelis' magical and dreamy score. A music that is intimate
and distant at the same time. This may be the best soundtrack Vangelis ever
created.</P>
<P>The film ends in a monstrous, violent and emotionally engaging finale, that
makes a lasting impression. 'Blade Runner' is a unique film, incredible on
every level. This is a prophetic and emotional tale that stands out as one
of the most original and intellectual science fiction films ever made.</P>
