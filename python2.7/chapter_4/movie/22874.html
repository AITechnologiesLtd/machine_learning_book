<P>ANYWHERE BUT HERE (M).  
(Twentieth Century Fox)
Director: Wayne Wang
Stars: Susan Sarandon, Natalie Portman, Shawn Hatosy, Hart Bochner, 
Bonnie Bedelia, Roy Baker, Paul Guilfoyle, Eileen Ryan
Running time: 116 minutes.</P>
<P>Anywhere But Here charts the tempestuous but often moving and
complex relationship that exists between mothers and daughters.  This
is similar to territory that director Wayne Wang (Smoke, Blue In The
Face, etc) previously explored in The Joy Luck Club.  While that film
was shaped by more specific cultural and ethnic overtones and the
weight of historical antecedents, Anywhere But Here is a more
contemporary tale.  This is the kind of rich emotional territory that
has become the preserve of American independent cinema, but here it is
given the lavish, big budget treatment.  Thanks to a perceptive script
from Oscar winner Alvin Sargent (Julia, Ordinary People, etc), the
film also looks at the dilemmas of adolescence - divorce, moving home
and making a new start, first love, the loss of close friends, and a
troubled relationship with interfering mothers - with broad humour,
warmth, honesty, and surprising flashes of insight.</P>
<P>Bored with the pace of life and lack of opportunities in small
town Bay City, Wisconsin, flighty Adele August (Susan Sarandon) packs
her bags and young teenage daughter Ann (Natalie Portman, recently
seen in The Phantom Menace) into her second hand Mercedes and heads
off for Beverley Hills and a more exciting life.  Ann however is
annoyed at being uprooted so abruptly from her friends and family, and
resists her new life with a passion.  Meanwhile, the ambitious Adele
tries to adjust, making the most of the slender opportunities that
come her way.</P>
<P>The film spans a couple of years and explores the difficult
relationship that exists between the pair as they try to redefine
themselves and their new life in a strange city.  This gives the film
something of an episodic feel, and Wang's direction is occasionally a
little languid.</P>
<P>At the root of their turbulent relationship are some very real
fears and emotional issues that need to be resolved.  Adele is rather
vulnerable and mostly fears the loneliness she will feel when Ann
grows up and eventually leaves her.  Ann on the other hand is often
embarrassed by her mother's overbearing behaviour and erratic ways.
She constantly swears that she hates Adele and that she will leave
her, but lacks the courage and confidence to do so.</P>
<P>The character of Adele is the type of familiar role that
Sarandon plays with consummate ease.  She delivers a wonderfully brash
performance, capturing Adele's recklessness, her optimism and her deep
love for her daughter.  Sarandon is matched every step of the way by
the superb Portman, who seems to grow in stature and maturity with
every film, and again proves why she is one of the best actresses of
her generation.  Wang largely wastes the talents of an impressive
ensemble supporting cast, that includes Bonnie Bedelia and Shawn
Hatosy, in small roles.</P>
<P>Anywhere But Here is an unashamed weepy and a good old
fashioned "woman's film" in the mould of Alice Doesn't Live Here
Anymore, etc, and will mainly resonate with modern female audiences.</P>
