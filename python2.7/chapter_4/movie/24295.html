<P>"High Fidelity" (2000) *** (out of four)</P>
<P>Directed by Stephen Frears
Written by D.V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, John Cusack,
and Scott Michael Rosenberg</P>
<P>Starring John Cusack, Iben Hjejle, Jack Black, Todd
Louiso, Lisa Bonet, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Lili Taylor,
Joan Cusack, Natasha Gregson Wagner, and Tim Robbins</P>
<P>Just look back two years ago at the Coen Brothers'
comedic gem The Big Lebowski, change the actors, take
away the bowling alley, add a record store, and you've
got High Fidelity (or maybe the other way around since
Nick Hornby's novel High Fidelity came first). Either
way, it's been done before, a trio of losers cracking
jokes and complaining about their failed romances, yet
it remains consistently funny. Why is this? Maybe
because you know your life is much better than this,
you know these guys are more pathetic than you are,
and you know its ok to laugh at them because they're
fictional. Director Stephen Frears, possibly not
intentionally, has created a movie that makes you feel
good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good
uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day.
When watching High Fidelity, expect to laugh at
someone else's pain, realize what you are laughing at,
and then laugh again. </P>
<P>I laughed at Dick (Todd Louiso), the shy, timorous,
Steve Buscemi character of Lebowski, who seems to know
what he is talking about but either can't put it into
words or is harshly rejected by his friends. I laughed
at the John Goodman character Barry (Jack Black), an
exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on The
Simpsons, pudgy, egotistic, and obnoxious at the same
time. And I laughed at Rob (John Cusack), the Jeff
Bridges type, whom the story revolves around. Rob is
the character easiest to relate to, but he is nothing
like you at all. He uncontrollably cheats and lies,
then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a
woman. And like his other miserable friends, pop music
is where he inevitably goes for comfort. </P>
<P>He spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his
coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new
music and either deriding it or praising it. Whatever
human emotions The Clash, Aretha Franklin, and Bruce
Springsteen records hold, Rob and co. grasp them and
help fill voids in their social lives. Rob has built
an extensive collection in his record store as well as
his home and he organizes them depending on what mood
he is in. During this confused stage of his life in
which the movie focuses on, Rob is trying to cope with
numerous rejections over the years by visiting past
girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him.
But these aren't any girlfriends…these girls made the
all time top five break ups in the history of Rob
(Rob's incessant use of lists show how pop music has
played a major role in his life). The plot in three
words is: women and music.</P>
<P>The approach director Stephen Frears takes by having
the charismatic Rob speak directly to the camera is
very effective. It gives High Fidelity a quickly
paced, informal structure, adjectives which perfectly
parallel Rob's own lifestyle. It also helps open the
viewer's eyes as to how annoying Barry is. Jack Black
steals the show with a hilariously realistic
performance as a total sleaze ball. Just listening to
him speak for five minutes makes the audience
immediately sympathetic for Rob, who must work with
him every day of the week. What Frears does so well is
that he makes us feel sorry for Rob while laughing at
his misfortunes. John Cusack plays his character
convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast,
consisting of big stars and character actors, that
really defines Rob. Now instead of Rob just talking to
the camera, after he explains something, the remaining
cast members physically and humorously create what he
is trying to say. </P>
<P>The only problem with High Fidelity is that it doesn't
end when it should have ended. Instead the movie goes
on for a torturous twenty minutes that seem a lot
longer than that. Also Bruce Springsteen is completely
wasted in a brief cameo halfway through the movie. </P>
<P>High Fidelity is a cheerful, old fashioned comedy with
a voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs. I just
hope Hollywood keeps creating losers on the big
screen, they make everyone look and feel great. </P>
