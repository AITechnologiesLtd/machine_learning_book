<PRE>                               GRAND CANYON
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>135 min., R, Drama, 1992
Director: Lawrence Kasdan
Cast: Steve Martin, Danny Glover, Kevin Kline, Mary McDonnell,
      Mary-Louise Parker, Alfre Woodard, Tina Lifford, Marlee Shelton</P>
<P>     This film is about several people who have problems in their lives,
how they cope with their problems, and how they help out others.</P>
<P>     I think that GRAND CANYON is a wonderful film.  If you haven't yet
had the chance to see it, that you rush out to do so immediately.  I was
able to see the film on the big screen (at a second run theater) and
thought that it was definitely worth it.   GRAND CANYON is also
available on video cassette, although it won't be quite as spectacular
this way, it may be the only way that you will be able to see it.  On a
scale of zero to five, I give GRAND CANYON a five.  GRAND CANYON is
rated R for explicit language and female nudity.</P>
<P>     The performances in this film are great.  Steve Martin gives the
best performance that I have seen, and shows that he can do a wonderful
job with dramatic material.  Danny Glover also gives a spectacular
performance.  Kevin Kline is great.  He deftly handles his material and
creates a wonderful character.  Alfre Woodard is also very notable in
the cast, and does nothing but add to the film.  Mary McDonnell and
Mary-Louise Parker also seem to give their best.</P>
<P>     The director Lawrence Kasdan, who did THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST and
BODY HEAT, does a wonderful job.  The film comes out looking perfect.
The script is expertly written and kept me fully entranced for the full
two hours and fifteen minutes.  When the film was over, I wished that it
had gone on for a longer time.  I wanted to know what happened to all
people in the film after it was over.  The locations used for the film
are excellent.  They set the film perfectly and added greatly to the
finished product.</P>
<P>     The score for the film was perfect.  The volume wasn't so high that
it drowned out words or became annoying and it fit the film.  Although I
am not much for classical music, I thought that it came out great.</P>
