<PRE>                              SHADOWS AND FOG
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1992 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     SHADOWS AND FOG is a film written and directed by Woody Allen.  It
stars Woody Allen, Mia Farrow, John Malkovich, and John Cusak, with Lily
Tomlin, Jodie Foster, Madonna, Julie Kavner, Wallace Shawn, Kathy Bates,
Kate Nelligan, Donald Pleasance, Fred Gwynne, and Kenneth Mars.
Production design is by Santo Loquasto and cinematography by Carlo
DiPalma.  Rated PG-13 for sexual situations.</P>
<P>     SHADOWS AND FOG is minor Woody Allen, but for the true believer
(such as your humble correspondent) second-rate Woody Allen is better
than just about anything else that is likely to be booked into town on a
given weekend.  I have to admit that the chameleonic nature of Allen's
films can be a little frustrating at times.  He's done his hommages (and
I'm sure he'd use the French word) to almost every important school of
film making and the greatest film makers.  SHADOWS AND FOG is an homage
to Kafka and to the German expressionist film school.  It has its
charms, but they will be most obvious to those of us who are predisposed
to find them.</P>
<P>     The film is in black and white and fog.  The action is limited to
one endless night is a city that resembles the Prague we saw in Stephen
Soderburgh's KAFKA (a mostly black-and-white film) but more
claustrophobic, more artificial, more suggestive of a sound stage.  And
of course, it is a little strange that this does seem to be the Year of
the Kafkas with Soderburgh, the reissue of the Argentine movie THE LOVES
OF KAFKA, and now this.  Whereas Soderburgh studiously strove to avoid
the Kafkaesque (he fined crew and cast for using the word on the set),
Allen is a-wash in it.  Nothing makes sense, nor is it meant to.  A
strangler, a mob at war with itself, a doctor looking the physical
origin of evil, the hatemongers, the corrupt police and clergy, the
circus that no goes to, the student, the whores, the source of the
lights under wagons and behind fences, the magician, the ending.</P>
<P>     Of course, it's all a metaphor for the way Life is, and it's a
good, if not terribly original, way of talking about art, movie-making,
and all that esthetics stuff that we popcorn eaters usually try to
avoid.  We don't know why life or art starts, why it ends, what happens
during, before, or afterward.  We are all stumbling around in Shadows
and Fog.  It's all there, but it is a trifle obvious.  The best parts
are some of the cameos, especially Julie Kavner's ("Get out there,
Kleinman, and get killed."), Donald Pleasance as the ghoulish medico,
Madonna -- surprisingly -- ("I'm not fussy.  I'll eat whatever you put
in front of me."), Wally Shawn who is in contention for the cameo king
of American movies, and Lily Tomlin as a hard-bitten whore.  In a movie
that is studiously plotfree, the presence of so many guest stars is much
more tolerable than in many movies, where the cameos are often a form of
Hollywood cronyism (PETER PAN springs to mind here), gamesmanship, and
otherwise irrelevant to the movie.  The cameos in SHADOWS AND FOG may
possibly contribute to the meaning of the movie (you never show whom
you're going to run into in the fog, life is arbitrary and surprising)
and provide little islands of clarity in all the swirling murk.  For
example, the Kavner scene fills us in on a bit of Kleinman's past and
his personality.</P>
<P>     Four of the roles rise above guest shots: Allen, Mia Farrow as Irmy
the swordswallower, John Cusak as the student whose studies of the human
condition take him to brothels and bars, and John Malkovich as the clown
too caught in being an artist to be a Mensch.  Allen was Allen; we fans
would never permit him to be otherwise.  The harmless little man caught
up in things beyond his powers to understand or to articulate, he can
only stutter and rub his hands endlessly.  The everyman who survives
with oneliners and sidesteps and who finds his redemption is the world
of illusion (beginning to sound a little autobiographical, ain't it?).</P>
<P>     Mia Farrow as Irmy continues to be Woody's understudy, and maybe
heir apparent.  As I remarked when I reviewed ALICE, she's taken on his
mannerisms, if not quite his persona, to an almost disturbing degree.
Is she the new Zelig?  Her performance is probably the most interesting,
certainly her character is, a circus swordswallower with biological
clock and a price.  Look out for her scene in the brothel; it is the
best this movie has to offer.</P>
<P>     John Malkovich is a very mannered actor, whose ability to
communicate intellectualized selfishness is nonpareil but does not quite
work as the clown.  Of course, it's amusing to all of us other clowns to
have him in full makeup going on about his life as an Artist, about how
his head is constantly full of wonderful new things, but I kept seeing
Valmont from DANGEROUS LIAISONS.  Malkovich, funny though he could be,
never seemed to fully connect with the essential absurdity of his
character and took his too earnestly.</P>
<P>     On the other hand, John Cusak was perfect as the student.  One
could believe that this was the stand-in for Kafka himself.  Trying hard
to keep his materialism and world-weariness intact, asking about God and
suicide, and yet with the underlying romanticism that kept nagging him
not to dismiss everything that every happened to him.</P>
<P>     Overall, I have to admit that is one of the master's least
successful efforts.  It is almost all style, little substances, surfaces
and no depths.  The existential questions are like the usual suspects;
Woody's rounded them up again, but it's not too any great purpose.  It
will be of interest only to the true believer.  The rest of you may
safely pass it by.  True believers are cautioned to pay matinee prices.</P>
<P>     There is a rather wonderful last line, maybe that is worth the
price of the matinee ticket.</P>
