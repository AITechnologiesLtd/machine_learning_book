<P>     The fact that I survived a packed preview at the stinky Six Forks--
with a few hundred gabby teens and not a damn bit of hi-fi sound to
drown 'em out-- is an accomplishment unto itself.  Too bad the film
wasn't better.  SCREAM 2 is a hip, hair-raising, self-referential snore.
Series' creators Wes Craven (director) and Kevin Williamson (writer)
have relocated their smash franchise ($39M!) to a sleepy college town,
where the survivors of the first film (Neve Campbell, David Arquette,
Courtney Cox, etc.) are being stalked by a copycat killer.  (In the in-
spired but overlong opening, the killer makes his/her debut at a rauc-
ous, ROCKY HORROR--like premiere of STAB, a movie based on the book
based on the fictional events of the first film.)  Though the number of
in-jokes ends up far higher than any body count, the boo bits are act-
ually the *more* successful component of the movie.  Only intermittenly
does Williamson's script crackle with enough electric wit to make you
forget that you're watching a bunch of good-looking bad actors being put
through the standard slasher motions.  (Or, in the case of the godawful
ending, an apparent live-action update of "Scooby Doo, Where Are You?")
With Omar Epps, Rebecca Gayheart, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jamie Kennedy,
Laurie Metcalf, Jerry O'Connell, Jada Pinkett, Liev Schreiber, and play-
ing Drew Barrymore in the opening of STAB, Rollergirl herself, Heather
Graham.</P>
