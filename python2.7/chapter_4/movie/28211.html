BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>In the romantic comedy BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY, Renée Zellweger looks 
absolutely awful as Bridget Jones.  With a splotchy complexion, bulges 
everywhere and stringy hair, Bridget eats, drinks and smokes too much.  
She also dresses like a carpet.  Badly miscast as the British heroine, 
Zellweger, in a monotonic performance, never gives us much reason to 
care.</P>
<P>Although Bridget has a serious and supposedly hopeless crush on her 
boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant), Richard Curtis and Andrew Davies's 
script has Bridget and Daniel quickly hopping into bed together.  In the 
role of the man clearly designed to be the only man to deserve her, 
Colin Firth plays the dour lawyer Mark Darcy like a man with a constant 
case of intestinal problems.  In a one-dimensional part, Embeth Davidtz 
plays Natasha, Mark's anal-retentive fellow lawyer and would-be fiancée.</P>
<P>Bridget, who writes in her diary in narration, is a 32 year old who 
worries about dying a spinster and being eaten alive by dogs.  (No such 
luck.)  Her television choices consist of things like the death scene 
from FATAL ATTRACTION followed by a nature program on humping lions.  In 
case we forget how we're supposed to feel about Bridget's aspirations 
and emotions, the film's heavy musical accompaniment is also there to 
remind us.</P>
<P>"Stay calm -- can't get worse," Bridget admonishes herself when she is 
having yet another social disaster.  I kept trying to remember that 
advice while waiting for the ending credits to arrive.</P>
<P>BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY runs a long 1:35.  It is rated R for language and 
some strong sexuality and would be acceptable for most teenagers.</P>
