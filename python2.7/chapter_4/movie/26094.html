Nurse Betty
Reviewed by Christian Pyle
Directed by Neil LaBute
Written by John Richards and James Flamberg
Starring Renée Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, Chris Rock, and Greg Kinnear
Grade: B+</PRE>
<P>Well, when your husband's brutally murdered in front of you, what can you do 
but drive halfway across the country in search of a soap opera character?  At 
least that's the reaction of Betty Sizemore (Renée Zellweger) in "Nurse 
Betty," the latest entry in the cinema of quirk.</P>
<P>Betty waits tables at the Tip Top Diner in a small town in Kansas and dreams 
of being a nurse.  Del (Aaron Eckhart), her jerk of a husband, sells cars, 
boffs his secretary, and deals stolen cocaine.  The last enterprise brings 
hitmen Charlie (Morgan Freeman) and Wesley (Chris Rock) to his door.  They 
murder Del but don't know that Betty is watching from the next room.  Betty 
has a "dissociative reaction" that causes her to lapse into the fantasy that 
Dr. David Ravell, a character that George McCord (Greg Kinnear) plays on the 
soap "A Reason to Love," is her ex-fiance.  Betty packs up the car she'd 
borrowed from her husband's lot and headed for LA unaware that ten kilos of 
stolen dope are hidden in her trunk.  Since Charlie and Wesley need to find 
the drugs and eliminate the witness, they follow Betty into the desert.  
Along the way, Charlie begins to fall in love with Betty.</P>
<P>Charlie's love for Betty parallels Betty's love for Dr. Ravell in that both 
fall in love with fantasy figures rather than real people.  That irony 
produces most of the laughs in this movie that unashamedly mixes light comedy 
and film noir tension, as if "Soapdish" collided with "Blood Simple."  
However, the filmmakers never sacrifice the illusion of realism for cheap 
laughs or overly contrived plot twists.  "Nurse Betty" is the least 
predictable film I've seen in ages because it refuses to follow generic 
conventions.</P>
<P>Despite its strengths, John Richards and James Flamberg's script is thin and 
what makes "Betty" work is the excellent cast.  Zellweger gives Betty a 
refreshing combination of starry-eyed innocence and steel-willed 
determination.  A character who might otherwise have seemed pathetic becomes 
instead a heroine.  Freeman offers us a disarmingly sensitive hitman, and the 
angry sarcasm of Rock provides a hilarious counterpoint.  Kinnear is quite 
good in "Betty" as well, but considering his amazing performance in "As Good 
As It Gets" I wish he would take on more substantial roles.</P>
<P>The ghost of the Blair Witch continues to haunt internet marketing.  USA 
Films has set up an official site for "A Reason to Love" 
(<A HREF="http://www.areasontolove.com/">http://www.areasontolove.com/</A>) and a wonderfully tacky fan site for Dr. 
Ravell (<A HREF="http://www.nurse-betty.com/drravell/">http://www.nurse-betty.com/drravell/</A>). </P>
<P>Bottom line:  Quirky fun but not for the squeamish.</P>
