<P>Merryl Streep is getting serious competition in the domain of 
accents.  It would take Sherlock Holmes to figure out that Janet 
McTeer is British and not a would-be Southern belle.</P>
<P>McTeer? Who she? She won the Tony Award in 1997 for Best Actress (in 
the revival of Ibsen's "A Doll's House"). She is big on the British 
stage, has been on TV, had smaller roles in movies. Now, in her first 
starring movie McTeer rates an 8.3 on the Richter scale. She's been 
Oscar nominated and collected a huge bouquet of awards and other 
nominations.</P>
<P>The reasons for those triumphs: Janet McTeer endows a two-dimensional 
character with a strong three-dimensional performance  She plays Mary 
Jo Walker, a North Carolina gal in her late thirties who is a serial 
bad-chooser of men. Her life has been a long road trip between 
husbands (four of them), and, undoubtedly, lovers too. (Those who 
might sniff at her lifestyle might consider   the machine-gun 
successions of marriages and affairs in the world of "celebrities," 
especially in show business.)</P>
<P>Each time Mary Jo quits a relationship she moves to another state. 
It's good for geographic knowledge of the land, especially the South. 
It's bad for Mary Jo and her now 12-year old daughter Ava --named 
after Ava Gardner who had a host of husbands and lovers. Yet there is 
one positive constant: the unshakable bond between mother and 
daughter.</P>
<P>In the low-budget, quickly shot "Tumbleweeds" we meet the duo in West 
Virginia as she is having a drag-out fight with her latest male. 
Pulling up stakes again  Mom and Ava get in their beat-up car and hit 
the road. What possessions they take along are limited. It's like the 
rapidly packed minimum that frequent fliers have at the ready. 
Obviously this kind of "blitz" departure is old hat to Ava. She takes 
it all like a veteran of earlier wars.</P>
<P>The youngster's comments and body-English expressions are critical of 
her single parent. But never mind. There is  much giggling, singing, 
laughing and joking on the highways and in rest stops.</P>
<P>The gals are heading west, without any specific plan or destination. 
The trip is relatively uneventful, save for a broken water hose that 
a passing stranger, truck driver Jack, fixes.</P>
<P>The encounter with Jack sums up a lot of Mary Jo's personality. She's 
a big gal with big looks and manners, a born flirt  done up in 
man-trap ways,  big hair, big cleavage, anklet and such.  No clear 
clues are given as to when all this takes place, but I suspect it is 
not today. Otherwise Mary Jo might also have had pierced body parts 
and a tattoo.</P>
<P>They are going West, all the way, and end up in Starlight Beach, by 
the sea, near San Diego. You can't say that they settle there because 
it is blindingly clear that Mom is a recidivist. There's bound to be 
another man and another split.</P>
<P>What would movies do without coincidences? The man, met at a watering 
place, turns out to be Jack-of-the-highway. You guess the rest. MJ 
and Ava move in with him. Mother, now employed, has to put up with a 
deadly dull receptionist-type job and with a weird boss (Michael J. 
Pollard, under-used). Ava, always tsk tsking, is happy in school, 
gets "a new best girlfriend,"(shades of peripatetic Mom's 
relationships), discovers her thespian talent as the class competes 
for Shakespearean roles. (She studies Juliet, ends up as Romeo).</P>
<P>Nothing lasts of course, especially Mary Jo's relationships, except 
for the rock-steady love between the mother and pre-mature (read: 
slowly entering womanhood) Ava.</P>
<P>Mary Jo is perfectly drawn as cheerful, spunky and essentially very 
ordinary. She is based  on the real-life memoirs of Angela Shelton, 
the ex-wife of director O'Connor (he also plays Jack). There's more 
than a mere ring of authenticity here. The people as real. Their 
portrayals avoid the temptations of pathos, heavy sugar, forced 
picturesqueness or comedy. At the movies Ava gets her first kiss. 
It's a fiasco compounded by gaucheness and asthma. But later, after a 
demonstration by Mary Jo,  kiss #2 is a success. "My mother taught 
me" says the girl. In this phrase there's filial love, pride and a 
reminder of Mom's unorthodoxies.</P>
<P>Ava has gotten Mom down pat. The child is mother to the mother, which 
may be a deja vu all over again movie theme but mostly found in films 
about higher classes, typically with flighty socialite moms and 
sensible daughters. I can't say why exactly but the relationship in 
this film reminds me more of "Paper Moon"'s than of other movies.</P>
<P>Mary Jo is a true but not really interesting creation. She's a 
round-heels dame, common, even vulgar, but not coarse.</P>
<P>The lady  may be close to trailer-trash but not quite that. She rises 
above  this in ways rather akin to Anna Karina's 
prostitute-by-despair in  Godard's "My Life to Live." In that film a 
little schoolboy's essays about "La Poule" (French for chicken, but 
also meaning a broad or a whore )  goes: A chicken has an outside and 
an inside. Remove the outside and you see the inside.. Remove the 
inside, and you see the soul." Which you do see in Mary Jo's quiet 
moments, in closeups where her essential loneliness jumps out at you.</P>
<P>What holds your interest here is how the women are drawn, how those 
two are confidantes, acolytes, fellow-plotters.</P>
<P>The construction of "Tumbleweeds" is smooth and believable. My only 
objections  is that within one shot the jiggling camera goes 
unnecessarily from face to face. Also, Mr. Nice Guy widower called 
Dan, who works in Mary Jo's office and befriends Ava  of the camera, 
is a potential replacement after Mom's break with Jack, but he's far 
and away too educated. thoughtful and classy for her.  Minor flaws, 
major performances.</P>
