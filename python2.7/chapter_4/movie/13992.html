<PRE>A Little Romance (1979) 108m. </PRE>
<P>Light-hearted film by George Roy Hill shows once again how assuredly he 
is able to work in any genre of his choosing.  Two young teenaged 
geniuses (played by newcomers Diane Lane and Thelonious Bernard) meet by 
chance in Paris and pledge their hearts to each other.  They enlist the 
aid of an elderly gentleman (Laurence Olivier) to arrange themselves an 
interlude in Italy away from Lane's disapproving mother.  Amazingly, 
this film works despite what should be its only real weak point - Lane 
and Bernard's lack of chemistry together.  They are immediately likeable 
as individuals: Lane is impish yet level-headed; Bernard is savvy 
without being smarmy, and their friendship is believable.  Still, they 
don't demonstrate enough emotional highs and lows to prove themselves to 
us as lovers (although they are at least idealistic).  A LITTLE ROMANCE 
manages a perfect combination of elements: engaging performances, 
romantic European locations, a buoyant score (borrowed mostly from 
Vivaldi), and a smart, observant screenplay.</P>
<P>Hill avoids conscious stylistic elements and plays it low-key, making 
this more European and less American than his other films (Americans 
aren't portrayed flatteringly in this picture).  His shots of the 
youngsters watching movies or scampering through the city streets may 
remind you of Truffaut.  Hill also throws in a couple of references to 
his own movies, and has Bernard first meet Lane when he sneaks on to a 
film set - significantly, she is reading a book.  Bernard compares their 
partnership to Bogart and Bacall; Lane is more excited about being in 
the birthplace of Romeo and Juliet; Bernard is a fan of Robert Redford; 
Lane prefers Elizabeth Barrett Browning.  While both read literature, 
it's only Bernard who enthuses about film.  It's interesting, because 
while Bernard is the one more fascinated by the world of make-believe, 
it is the philosophy-reading Lane that wants to live out a romantic 
caprice.  And thrown into the mix is Olivier, going one step further and 
fabricating his entire life (as it turns out, nearly everyone in this 
film is living a lie of one kind or another).  Not one of this trio has 
the power to fulfil a fantasy on their own: it's the melding of their 
different forms of escapism that finally mobilize all three. </P>
<P>Hill, a notoriously practical director, balances the romantic 
foolishness of his protagonists' escapade with a sense of studied 
feasibility.  What's really inspiring about A LITTLE ROMANCE is that it 
doesn't place its premise out of our reach - I don't doubt that several 
viewers have similarly sought out the story's special kiss on the 
waterways of Venice.  And of course it's great to see Olivier delivering 
a foxy performance as an old Parisian, enjoying the screen time he has 
with his much younger co-stars.  Like romance itself, this film has a 
timeless quality - it still holds up well after years of viewing.</P>
