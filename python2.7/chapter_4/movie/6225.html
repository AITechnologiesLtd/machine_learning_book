                         Bitter Sugar (1996)
                   A film review by Ben Hoffman
                    Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>          Writer-Director Leon Ichaso, who came to the U.S. when he
was 14-years-old, says "Every character in the film is a composite of
different people.  This is the story of many people in Cuba," . Maybe
it is and maybe it is not.</P>
<P>          BITTER SUGAR is an unrelenting attack on Castro and the
Cuban Revolution.  Anyone who believed that the revolution was viable,
that Castro was for the people, was a dupe.   The film's propaganda
never lets up, never mentions any of the harm that our own country has
visited on Cuba when 5 of our presidents have continued the unabated
onslaught on this tiny island in the Caribbean with embargoes and
Radio broadcasts to the island long after Castro had stopped trying to
bring the revolution to Central and South America.</P>
<P>          This is not to say that the condition of the people is not
bad.  Nor do I contend that Castro is not a dictator.  But a film that
wants to be fair should mention the embargoes we have visited on Cuba
so that no country, much less a tiny one, could survive, and then we
say, "Look what Castro has done to his people."  No mention
is made that millions of people in Cuba still admire, rightly or
wrongly, Castro; that illiteracy has been all but wiped out.</P>
<P>          What the film's main theme is that "everyone" wants to leave
Cuba and go to Miami.  No mention is made that Miami is THE most
dangerous city in the U.S.   It is presented as if it were Heaven.</P>
