<PRE>                             CAST AWAY
                  A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Tom Hanks plays a FedEx executive
          marooned on a deserted island who must find the
          means to stay alive and sane.  Much of the film
          is enthralling but director Robert Zemeckis
          spends too much time on the aspects of lessor
          interest and not enough time on the parts that
          are really most enthralling.  The film builds to
          a platitude by rushing past some of the most
          intellectually engaging material.  With more
          emphasis on the real meat, this film would have
          rated considerably higher.  Rating: 6 (0 to 10),
          high +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Chuck Noland (played by the versatile Tom Hanks) is a very
dedicated executive for Federal Express, the package delivery
company.  He is extremely systematic and obsessed with the passage
of time.  Chuck has become a local legend for his dedication to
delivering packages on time.  He is even the center of a Federal
Express urban myth about the lengths he will go to get a package
delivered on time.  Chuck knows that in his business time is all
important for him, but unknown to him, he is about to spend the next
few years of his life in a place where time is far more subjective.</P>
<P>     Chuck is napping on a company flight over the Pacific and
awakes to discover that the plane is off course in a storm and
desperately trying to find its way back.  Suddenly the world falls
apart under him and we find ourselves in a crashing plane that is
rapidly decompressing.  After what well might be the scariest plane
crash in cinema history Chuck finds himself in a life raft in a
storm alone on a hostile ocean.  With extreme good fortune he is
blown to an island.  But perhaps the island is not such good luck as
he has no tools and no means to feed and protect himself.  How he
does that is the heart of the film.  Unfortunately, there is not
enough of this heart.</P>
<P>     The problem is that the buildup to this point really takes too
much time.  The script shows you a bit of his relationship with his
lover Kelly Frears (played by Helen Hunt).  But once he is on the
island that part of the film really is necessary only to establish
that he has a woman whom he dearly loves.  Developing that
relationship takes valuable time from coverage of the island
experience.  The opening setup is not only unneeded, it is also
puzzling.  We are taken to a large family Christmas dinner at which
everyone in the family seems to dress the same and work for Federal
Express.  That strikes the viewer as peculiar, but it leads to
nothing.  It not only wastes precious screentime, it does nothing to
enhance the story.  What it does serve to do is give Federal Express
an even larger product placement than the huge one they would
already have.</P>
<P>     The centerpiece of this film is the air crash which is as
detailed as it is frightening.  One might almost say it was done in
the realistic style of the beach landing of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and
may be nearly as harrowing.  It packs quite an impact and I will
certainly think of its images the next time that I fly.  Trust me,
you should not expect to see this film as an airline in-flight
movie.</P>
<P>     This in many ways is an engineer's film.  With a set of modest
tools washed up on the shore from the crash or available on the
island he is forced to reinvent or discover ways to fulfill his
needs.  He must reinterpret objects from a few floating FedEx
packages as the tools to build his small world.  And the knowledge
of how to do that does not come easily.  In the beginning he is
almost a laughable character, strange-looking and overweight, and he
makes foolish and frustrating mistakes.  And he pays for those
mistakes in pain and blood.  What seem like very small tasks in
civilization become extremely hard.</P>
<P>     As time goes by, Chuck's intelligence as well as his fitness
seems to improve immensely, though not his sanity.  I think that the
most interesting point made by the film is that sanity may be really
a social affectation.  Many people let down their guard when they
are alone and do things like talking to themselves that they would
not do in front of others.  Chuck's circumstances are more extreme
and he goes a lot further.  To save the greater part of his reason
must sacrifice the lessor part.  Chuck allows his sanity fall away
and to be replaced by a benign and natural insanity.  He invents a
friend to talk with.  In order to battle the solitude he even comes
to love the friend.  But he can only do this because he is alone.
If he knew anyone was watching him he would be inhibited from
creating such a friend.  Yet his actions seem natural.  Perhaps we
are all at least partly insane and keep that part in check while
there is danger that other people may find out.  And those others
also keep their irrational sides hidden.  While this phenomenon is
usually interpreted as the solitude driving him insane, it seems
really to be a process of the privacy allowing him to drop his
guard.  He allows himself to be natural in ways that few other
people in the world can.</P>
<P>     This is a better story than the platitude that it seems to
build up to in the final scene.  But it was not all the film it
could have been if Zemeckis would have realized where his best
material lay.  It rates a 6 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +1 on
the -4 to +4 scale.  Wouldn't this be a good time for Luis Bunuel's
1952 ROBINSON CRUSOE to show up again and be rediscovered?  I
haven't seen it since I was five years old, but by all accounts it
was quite good.  Extra: look in this film for an emotionally charged
scene that seems to be borrowed from MISSION TO MARS.</P>
