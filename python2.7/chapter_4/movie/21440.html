<P>"House on Haunted Hill," like the startlingly similar "The Haunting," which 
was released last July, is a frustrating experience more than a frightening 
one. There are differences between them, to be sure. While "The Haunting" was 
more sophisticated, with a superior cast, a budget of around $80-million, and 
a kid-friendly PG-13 rating, "House on Haunted Hill" is a gory, atmospheric, 
$20-million, R-rated spookathon. What the two films do have in common, 
however, aside from the basic plot mechanisms, is a sense of real promise 
early on, only to abysmally fall apart in the cheesy, special-effects-laden 
climax. Both directors, William Malone and Jan De Bont, clearly spent a great 
deal of time getting the mood and "look" of their films exactly right, and 
yet they forgot that not only is the setup often times scarier than the 
payoff, but that in order to care about a movie like this, you have to want 
to root for the characters. No such luck here. Oh, and both films are 
receiving from me a none-too-positive 1 1/2-star, though "House on Haunted 
Hill" is probably a little better, simply because it has the courage of its 
convictions to make an actual horror movie, rather than "The Haunting," which 
was akin to taking a ride in the Haunted Mansion at Disney World.</P>
<P>After a memorably stylish opening credits sequence and a brief prologue set 
in 1931, in which all but five patients at a sprawling psychiatric hospital 
die in a mysterious fire, the film really takes off with the first appearance 
of Steven Price (Geoffrey Rush), a twisted amusement park entrepreneur. 
Holding an interview with a local news reporter (singer Lisa Loeb, in the 
most engaging performance of the whole film), she questions exactly why the 
newest rollercoaster is supposed to be so scary, and Steven physically shows 
her and her cameraman (James Marsters) why. As we are taken on the ride with 
the characters, the film plays with your mind and offers genuine surprises 
and excitement not seen once the main storyline comes into focus. </P>
<P>On a dark, foreboding night, five strangers are lured into a mansion that is 
sprawled upon a cliff overseeing the ocean--the same one that the fire took 
place at in 1931. Four of the people--former pro football player Eddie Baker 
(Taye Diggs), physician Donald Blackburn (Peter Gallager), washed-up gameshow 
host Melissa Marr (Bridgette Wilson), and supposed-to-be CEO of a film 
company Jennifer Jenzen (Ali Larter)--have all gotten an invitation to attend 
the birthday party of Steven Price's gold-digging wife Evelyn (Famke 
Janssen), and along with the cautious owner of the property Watson Pritchett 
(Chris Kattan), become trapped in the building once inside. It is here that 
Steven makes everybody a proposal: stay in the house all night long, without 
dying, and they each will be rewarded with a $1-million check. The catch, it 
turns out, is that the house really is being haunted by the maniacal doctor 
(Jeffrey Combs) who was killed in 1931, and that all five guests are 
unknowingly related to the five inmates who survived decades before. </P>
<P>Admittedly, "House on Haunted Hill" has a zinger of a premise, a sort of 
ghastly rendition of 1993's "Indecent Proposal," in which people were asked 
if they'd cheat on their spouse for one night, and a million smackers, with 
Robert Redford. After the marvelous first fifteen minutes, the picture's 
interest quickly unravels because the stick-thin characters that inhabit the 
film are thoroughly repugnant people who either you want to die, or don't 
particularly care either way. </P>
<P>But then, once the two sole virtuous characters (played well, under the 
circumstances, by Taye Diggs and Ali Larter) make their way down into the 
decrepit basement to look around, the film gradually starts to grow very 
creepy, at least more so than last week's godawful "Bats." The middle section 
of the film is surely the best, offering up haunting (no pun intended) images 
that are truly disturbing and surprisingly psychological in nature. Very 
little violence is shown onscreen, nor are there many blatant visual effects 
that mar its effectiveness. Sitting back and watching the film, it occurred 
to me that maybe, after all, this late-Halloween offering might actually have 
something to offer. One particular sequence, in which Melissa is 
investigating the house and comes to an empty room that, through her video 
camera, shows a doctor and two nurses working on a mental patient who 
suddenly stop and stare straight at her, is scarier than the whole 
2-hour-plus "The Haunting." </P>
<P>The film ultimately begins to sour soon after, as the interplay between 
Steven Price and Evelyn not only is cold-hearted and off-putting, but also 
disastrously acted by the usually talented performers Geoffrey Rush and Famke 
Janssen. Descending on its shameful downward spiral, plot twists that come 
off as more dubious than unpredictable begin arising, the psychotic ghost of 
the doctor completely disappears from the proceedings, and indiscernible 
visual effects take over, foolishly revealing its low budget. Topping things 
off are a despicable, ragtag group of victims whom you practically learn 
nothing about throughout, unless they are uncovered to be involved in one of 
the late plot developments. The ending, especially, leaves you begging the 
question, "Is that it?!"</P>
<P>With an ominously unforgettable production design and appropriately brooding 
cinematography, by Rick Bota, watching "House on Haunted Hill" is like going 
to a restaurant where the food looks delectable, but tastes awful. There are 
several hints of the subjectively horrifying experience the film might very 
well have been, along the lines of "The Blair Witch Project" or "The Sixth 
Sense," but director William Malone and screenwriter Dick Beebe botch the 
results. It's about time filmmakers realize that character and story are more 
important than special effects, particularly when you obviously don't even 
have the money to make the effects the least bit believable to begin with.</P>
