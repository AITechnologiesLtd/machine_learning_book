<PRE>Wing Commander (PG-13) 1/2*
Starring Freddie Prinze Jr., Saffron Burrows
Directed by Chris Roberts        
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>There are many things that weâ€™ve learned from computers. There are also many
ways in which computers are helping people live their lives today. E-mail,
instant messages, and 3-D heavy games are now a part of everyday life for most
people in the country. Game designers have come out with some pretty classic
games such as Starcraft, Warcraft, EverQuest, and Wing Commander in the past
couple of years. While Starcraft might make a good movie, Wing Commander
doesnâ€™t. The only thing I can come up with is that 20th Century Fox must have
gotten together and said, â€œWe have a lot of computers. So letâ€™s make a
movie based off of a computer game, include bad computer generated effects, and
make the characters have the dimension of their PC game counterparts.â€?
Thatâ€™s the only thing I can possibly think of that they must have been
thinking because this film is easily one of the worst movies of the year.</P>
<P>Christopher Blair (Prinze Jr.) has an encrypted CD with information pertaining
to the destruction of a ship by the evil Kilrahti, an alien race that wasnâ€™t
to be dominant of the entire galaxy. Kilrathi are strange looking wolf-type
creatures who walk around in rooms with lots of fog and speak in techno font
subtitles. When Blair and his friend Todd Marshall (Matthew Lillard, who once
again proves that he cannot act) get assigned to help beat the Kilrathi, they
become a fighter on the ship.</P>
<P>So a bunch of space stuff that doesnâ€™t really have any significance happens,
and then more of it happens, and then more until we really donâ€™t care much
about whatâ€™s happening on screen. Most of the shots are of bad computer
created ships leaving, taking off, and firing, always hitting their target.
Then for some reason, Freddie has to leave his girl behind when she has to
eject from her space plane. This of course is right before he has to make the
jump that determines what happens in the end of the movie. (You will ask
yourself why he has to do this, you will also ask yourself why you ever wanted
to see this movie.) So he's up there in space worried and wondering whether his
love will be dead or alive when he comes home. I know, I just gave away what
happens in the end, but trust me, you wonâ€™t care.</P>
<P>The film contains horrible acting by everyone, there isn't one single
exception, none, zero, nada. This isnâ€™t to say itâ€™s entirely the castâ€™s
fault, Matthew Lillard is giving some pretty bad lines, and Freddie Prinze
doesnâ€™t have much to do. I think that I found the most compelling and
interesting character to be Mr. Obutu, (Hugh Quarshie) an African-American ship
navigator person, and thatâ€™s only because of his name. The effects arenâ€™t
very good at all, and the action scenes donâ€™t build any suspense, so we
donâ€™t really care about the characters. Besides, the script is filled with so
many stereotypes (the captain who doesnâ€™t believe everyone else, the
good-hearted bad girl) that you know whatâ€™s going to happen from about the 35
minute point. If you love the game you will be EXTREMELY disappointed. Heck, if
you saw it in the theaters, at least the new Star Wars trailer was shown before
it. That might make the experience a bit less painful. But if you consider
renting it on video, (what the heck is wrong with you?!) I seriously recommend
that you seek help because Wing Commander gets 1/2 a *.</P>
<P>The Young-Uns: The film contains sci-fi action violence and a suggestive after
sex scene. Good Age 12 & Up</P>
