<PRE>Rating:  ** (out of five)</PRE>
<PRE>Story by Robb White. </PRE>
<PRE>Screenplay by Dick Beebe. </PRE>
<P>Inspired by the 1958 film HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL starring Vincent Price.  </P>
<PRE>Directed by William Malone. </PRE>
<P>Starring Geoffrey Rush, Famke Janssen, and Chris Kattan. </P>
<P>Rated R (contains violence, profanity, and brief nudity). </P>
<P>Synopsis:  Eccentric millionaire Price offers $1,000,000 to each of his 
guests who appear at a gathering at a former sanitarium.  The only catch 
is that they have to survive the night at the establishment, an 
establishment haunted by its former staff and patients.</P>
<P>Comments:  HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL is based upon the original 1958 film of 
the same title directed by William Castle and starring Vincent Price.  
In an obvious homage, the millionaire's name is Price and he sports a 
thin mustache like Price used to have.  This is a pretty bad horror 
film, yet bad horror films sometimes are very entertaining, and HOUSE ON 
HAUNTED HILL is just such a film.  It is, surprisingly, better than 
another recent haunted house remake, THE HAUNTING, a film which owes its 
basis to the classic horror novel by Shirley Jackson.  THE HAUNTING had 
literary pretensions and fell flat on it face.  HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL 
owes its lineage to a B-movie 40 years old and makes no illusion that 
it's a crappy horror movie.  Thus, somehow, it proves slightly more 
successful. </P>
<P>I can't think of another recent film which has had such an eclectic 
cast.  It is this cast which lifts this ho-hum thriller into a 
borderline entertaining exercise in camp horror.  Price, the main 
character, is played by Geoffrey Rush, the Academy-Award winning actor 
of SHINE.  Rush seems to be making a downward spiral in the movie 
industry, a spiral reminiscent of Ben (GHANDI, SCHINDLER'S LIST) 
Kingsley's ridiculous appearance in the camp sci-fi classic SPECIES.  I 
don't know why, but sometimes it's entertaining to see "quality" actors 
in bad movies.  More surprises?  Rising star Taye Diggs plays a 
stereotypical African American sports figure (rather lamely too), and 
singer Lisa Loeb (!) appears as a TV news reporter.  The highlight of 
the cast, however, has to be SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE member Chris Kattan.  
Kattan's comic sense provides several good humorous moments as he plays 
the hysterical proprietor of the former sanitarium. </P>
<P>While the first half of the film leaves the audience guessing as to 
what's exactly going on, the second half dissolves into standard ghost 
story stuff and loses some of its suspense.  A disappointingly cheesy 
ending really mars this movie too.  HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL, I suspect, 
has just about left the second-run theaters.  It's worth catching on 
cable next year, if you get a chance.  If you have a choice, pick this 
movie over THE HAUNTING, it's the better of two evils, you could say.  
Though, more appropriately perhaps, it'd be better to say that it's the 
better of two turkeys. </P>
