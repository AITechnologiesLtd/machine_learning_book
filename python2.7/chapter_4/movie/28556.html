<PRE>ENLIGHTENMENT GUARANTEED
Directed by Doris Dorrie
With Uwe Ochsenknecht, Gustav Peter Wohler
The Screen     NR     109 min</PRE>
<PRE>     Imagine if you will a German Zen comedy.</PRE>
<P>All right.  It's a lot better than it sounds.  Veteran director 
Doris Dorrie, who made her reputation in 1985 with Men., matches up her 
frequent collaborator Uwe Ochsenknecht with newcomer Gustav Peter Wohler 
as a pair of bumbling German brothers who travel to Japan for a retreat 
in a Buddhist monastery.  Both actors do a wonderful job. </P>
<P>The story divides into three parts.  The first, and funniest, 
introduces us to the brothers at home in Munich, where Uwe is a salesman 
in a kitchen showroom, and Gustav is a Feng Shui consultant.  Uwe has a 
wife and four screaming children, and comes home one day to find his 
wife fed up and gone, taking the kids and the furniture with her.  He 
cries drunkenly on Gustav's shoulder, and begs his brother to take him 
along on his long-planned trip to the Monzen Monastery outside of Tokyo. 
 When he sobers up the next day and realizes the folly of his request, 
it's too late - Gustav has bought him a ticket, and there's no getting 
out of it.</P>
<P>Part two chronicles the misadventures of the brothers in the neon 
jungle of Tokyo, and while the humor holds up fairly well, it begins to 
show its age and effort as it dips into territory covered many times in 
movies like The Out-of-Towners.  In material that is more gag-based than 
reality-based, they get lost, lose their money and credit cards, and 
wind up sleeping in cartons and working in a German beer hall on the 
Ginza Strip to hustle the train fare to the monastery.</P>
<P>Part three is at the monastery, and this is where you'll need all 
your reserves of enlightenment to keep laughing.  Life in a monastery is 
made up of a lot of repetitive routines, and they are repeated and 
repeated here.  While this makes for good enlightenment, it makes for 
slow comedy.  But the opportunity for a look at life inside a Zen 
monastery is some recompense.  Interestingly, Uwe - the loutish salesman 
with no background or interest in Eastern philosophy - takes to the life 
better than his brother.  There's a sort of Zen Murphy's Law at work in 
the monastery, and what can go wrong for them does go wrong.  But by 
degrees they both learn to let go and accept the peace and beauty of the 
here and now, and emerge from Monzen very different from the men who 
went in. </P>
<P>Dorrie teaches graduate film students in Munich, and she was 
inspired to make this when her students balked at her challenge to them 
to make a movie using the new Digital technology.  "Okay, if you won't 
do it," she thought, "I will."  The medium fit the meditative message 
perfectly: she was able to "leave everything behind," and make her movie 
using a single cameraman and a crew that fit into one car.  But the look 
of the movie reads much richer than such simplicity would lead one to 
expect.  Cameraman Hans Karl Hu has captured some wonderful shots, 
including a classic overhead shot of pedestrians crossing a busy 
downtown Tokyo intersection.  And Dorrie reminds us of what she's up to 
technically by having Uwe record their adventures with his own hand-held 
digital video camera. </P>
<P>As the Abbot of Monzen explains, enlightenment is not the 
achievement of something, but the absence of something.  As the movie 
moves along, it discards its laughs along with the other worldly 
baggage, but a lot of quiet smiles remain.  And Santa Fe, a veritable 
hotbed of enlightenment, should provide the ideal audience for this 
story.      </P>
