<PRE>                          MARY SHELLEY'S FRANKENSTEIN
                       A film review by Edward W. Felton
                        Copyright 1994 Edward W. Felton</PRE>
<P>     After two triumphant Shakespearean adaptations, HENRY V and MUCH
ADO ABOUT NOTHING and two decently silly movies in PETER'S FRIENDS and
DEAD AGAIN, MARY SHELLEY'S FRANKENSTEIN is Belfast wunderkind Kenneth
Branagh's fifth film, a cautionary tale of English Roses, unnecessarily
bad stitching, and several pints of amniotic fluid.  Everyone knows the
story: giant made from corpses seeks revenge on creator, bolt in neck
and bad attitude optional.</P>
<P>     Branagh plays the devilishly handsome and talented Doctor
Frankenstein, brought up in idyllic Swiss home by dream parents Cheri
Lungi and Ian Holm.  Mother subsequently dies in childbirth, however,
which naturally spurs the youthful Frankenstein towards a future of
grave robbing and desecration.  There is much shaking of fists at the
sky and imploring it must not be so; off the dashing young Professor
goes to learn the medical profession, which apparently involves a great
deal of heating coloured liquid in tubes--standard mad scientist fare.
He comes under the influence of a bring-'em-back-to-life guru (a
criminally under-used John Cleese in false teeth) who soon dies,
conveniently allowing an ironic reprise of the "it must not be so"
routine.  Meanwhile, quintessential English rose Helena Bonham-Carter,
obviously on a free transfer from Merchant Ivory, does her normal
gadding about the place in frilly dresses and complicated hairdos,
wailing all the while.</P>
<P>     The fun starts when the monster itself is created; mayhem ensues
when Robert De Niro wakes up to find what a bad movie he's in, and that
his makeup takes hours to put on.  (Critic carefully avoids saying the
movie comes to life....)  Branagh, fitfully effective, continues to
disappoint in the direction of action scenes.  He seems happiest with
dialogue, close confrontation, and the detail to be found in faces.  In
contrasting the porcelain perfection of Bonham-Carter with the crude
baseness of the monster, Branagh has the essence of the film.  There is
too little of this, however, and what little there is is badly used:
one's attention and sympathies soon start to wander, as both
characterisation and the episodic plot are poorly developed.  Still,
some scenes work well; the initial creation of life is dramatically
effective, as are De Niro's opening scenes.</P>
<P>     Branagh, however thrives on words.  His two major successes had,
in William Shakespeare, the greatest screenwriter of them all.  He
struggles with this clumsy Frankenstein adaptation a real
disappointment, as there was ample opportunity in the movie for a
genuine talent (that's Branagh, by the way, not Bonham Carter) to
explore the questions that the story offers; immortality, life after
death, philosophy of the soul.  All that good stuff.  Instead, we get a
monster movie that anyone could have made.  The duality of the monster
good versus evil, newborn innocence versus primal brutality is dealt
with unforgivably crudely.  One moment, De Niro is crying after people
were rude to him, and the next he's blithely ripping out vital organs
to beat the band.  Of the few quality scenes on hand, one has the
monster being comforted by a blind farmer, played by Branagh stalwart
Richard Briers, where the anguish of Dr. Frankenstein's folly is both
touching and believable.  De Niro has enough insight and talent to
convey the monster's loneliness in this short scene, before being sent
groaning and lurching back  into this passionless script.  It's hardly
Mary Shelley's fault, although no woman who marries a man who lives on
vinegar and potatoes solely to keep his complexion clear can be
entirely without blame.</P>
<P>     Similar in many respects to Coppola's DRACULA (with Francis Ford
acting as executive producer on this movie) FRANKENSTEIN is
self-important, occasionally extremely gory and mildly entertaining.
And give me Emma Thompson opposite Branagh every time.  Three out of
ten.</P>
