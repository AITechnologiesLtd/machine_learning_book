<P>If 1999 is the year of new filmmaking, consider Anna and the King proof 
that the old formula still works. The movie is an epic of epic 
proportions in that tradition of masterpieces like The Last Emperor, Out 
of Africa and Gone with the Wind.</P>
<P>Based on the renowned musical, The King and I, Anna and the King is the 
tale of a woman, Anna Leonowens (Jodie Foster), who does the unthinkable 
of a woman in the mid-1800's: she takes her son halfway across the world 
to Siam where she becomes a school teacher. Even more outrageous is her 
speaking directly to and refusing to bow to the King of Siam (Chow 
Yun-Fat), something no lady has ever done before.</P>
<P>Anna is accepted by the King who finds wisdom in her practices and 
privately considers her his equal. The class she has come to teach is 
not one of peasants, nor even rich, but rather the 58 royal offspring 
plus her own son. The movie is a tale of a woman who dares to do the 
unthinkable time and again, how people view her, how the King views her 
and how her new home of Siam is facing political tasks equally as 
impossible as the thought of a woman surviving in the King's court.</P>
<P>A movie of such grandness must have an equally magnificent appearance. 
Shot entirely in Malaysia, director of photography Caleb Deschanel 
captures breathtaking scenery that makes the film a near-lock for the 
Best Cinematography award. Director Andy Tennant matches the incredible 
imagery with numerous well-choreographed extras and a Kubrickian 
attention to details that creates a flawless appearance. It is big 
screen movies like this that will always give Hollywood an edge over 
independent works.</P>
<P>For Jodie Foster this is her finest performance since 1991's The Silence 
of the Lambs and she owes many thanks to a co-star who is one of the 
year's best actors in his breakthrough performance. Chow Yun-Fat has 
come a long way from his days being advertised as "International Action 
Star." The unforgettable scenes in the King's court wouldn't be as rich 
without an excellent King nor as intriguing minus a witty teacher. The 
extras who play the King's children are convincing while still 
maintaining a cute "awe" quality that sets the tone for a film sprinkled 
with a delightfully innocent humor.</P>
<P>For two and half-hours, Anna and the King completely engages its 
audience. The film isn't long; it just takes its time. Because the movie 
takes its time, the actors are able to play their roles to a level of 
completeness; sweeping camera shots and a strong background score can 
captivate the audience without being prematurely cut off and the movie 
is able to establish itself as the last great epic of the 20th Century, 
a fitting title for a movie made by 20th Century Fox.     </P>
