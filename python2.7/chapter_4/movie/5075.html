<P>     Iranian films are not big in the United States.  After just a few 
months of limited release, THE WHITE BALLOON has already made more money 
in this country than any previous Iranian picture, including last year's 
THROUGH THE OLIVE TREES, which was made by international film icon Abbas 
Kiarostami and distributed by Miramax.  THE WHITE BALLOON, written by 
Kiarostami and directed by one of his proteges, Jafar Panahi, has the 
characteristic slow, stately tone that dominates Iranian efforts, but, 
at least in terms of its minimalist narrative, it's reminiscent of 
Vittorio De Sica's Italian classic, THE BICYCLE THIEF.  </P>
<P>     THE WHITE BALLOON is told in real time through the eyes of its 
seven year old, female protagonist, the feisty Razieh (Aida 
Mohammadkhani).  Our impressions of other characters are filtered 
through Razieh, so we see them as she does, whether they're strange, 
frightening, indifferent, or helpful.  All the facets of humanity are 
represented, from a generous-but-ineffectual old woman to a sinister 
soldier who tells lies to gain the young girl's confidence.  </P>
<P>     It's New Year's Day in Tehran, and, in ninety minutes, all the 
shops will close for a week-long holiday.  Before that happens, Razieh 
desperately wants to buy a plump, white goldfish with elaborate fins.  
She has her heart set on this prize and refuses to give up even when her 
mother says "no."  So, with the help of her brother (Moshen Kalifi), she 
eventually wears down all resistance, and, armed with her mother's last 
500 tomans bill, heads into the marketplace on her own.  Between home 
and the fish store, however, she loses the money down a street grate, 
where the metal bars keep it within sight, but out of reach.</P>
<P>     Like THE BICYCLE THIEF, THE WHITE BALLOON proves that movies don't 
have to be plot-heavy to succeed.  This film is strangely compelling 
even though nothing much happens, and that's primarily because Razieh is 
such an endearing character.  Portrayed in a perfectly-nuanced, 
unaffected manner by Aida Mohammadkhani, Razieh is one of the most 
impressive screen children since the protagonist of CROWS.  
Mohammadkhani, with only a little help from her supporting actors, makes 
this picture.</P>
<P>     In addition to its account of a girl's fist venture into the adult 
world on her own, THE WHITE BALLOON gives Western viewers a rare glimpse 
into the real Iran.  Here, freed of political shading, we meet the 
genuine inhabitants of Tehran, and, unsurprisingly, find that they're 
not all that different from us.  THE WHITE BALLOON certainly isn't 
everyone's kind of film, but those with the patience to sit through all 
eighty-five minutes will uncover a sublime, unconventionally engrossing 
story.</P>
<P>     A controversy that has nothing to do with the film's content has 
metamorphosed around THE WHITE BALLOON.  Following a U.S. congressional 
bill funding covert action against the current government of Iran, that 
country attempted to withdraw the film from contention for a best 
foreign film Oscar nomination.  Subsequently, when THE WHITE BALLOON 
began its limited U.S. run, Iran denied the director, Jafar Panahi, 
permission to leave the country to participate in a publicity tour.  
Nevertheless, even though Panahi has been forbidden to travel to the 
United States, he is well represented by his first feature, which speaks 
as eloquently as anything he would likely say.</P>
