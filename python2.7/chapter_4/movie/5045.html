<P>        GETTING IT RIGHT is a far far cry from the teenage sex comedy you
might expect from a summer movie about male virginity.  The film was
directed by Randal Kleiser, who brought us such bubble-gum classics as
GREASE and THE BLUE LAGOON.  But thanks to Kleiser's surprisingly good
direction and an intelligent script, GETTING IT RIGHT is a pleasantly
quiet, moving, and memorable film--one geared strictly toward a
sophisticated, adult audience.</P>
<P>        GETTING IT RIGHT stars Jesse Birdsall (Emily Lloyd's boyfriend in
WISH YOU WERE HERE) as Gavin, a painfully shy 31-year-old hairdresser who
lives at home with his parents and who--gasp--is still a virgin.  Gavin has
no problem whatsoever making small talk with the elderly women who clamor
for his services at the hair salon, but expose him to a single 30-year-old
beauty and he's a mess.  Much to Gavin's surprise, the woman who finally
brings him out of his shell and robs him of his virginity is Joan (Lynn
Redgrave), a rich, married, and lonely 45-year-old.  GETTING IT RIGHT is
the simple story of Gavin's awkward and haphazard efforts to get it right;
that is, to find the right woman to fulfill his life.</P>
<P>        GETTING IT RIGHT is one of those rare movies that devotes itself
entirely to in-depth character development.  Gavin's self-conscious
voice-over narration of his experiences firmly thrusts us into his psyche.
We observe his fascinating metamorphosis from shy and passive introversion
to assertive and self-confident maturity.  Birdsall's superb, understated
performance as Gavin is the real backbone of the film; he seems convincing
and authentic throughout.</P>
<P>        The charm of GETTING IT RIGHT also lies in the wide array of people
who inhabit or invade Gavin's life.  Despite her limited screen time,
Redgrave makes quite a splash in the movie as Gavin's middle-aged seducer.
For a supporting character, Joan is unusually and impressively complex,
thanks in large part to Redgrave's magnificent performance.  Gavin is also
pursued, or perhaps plagued, by Minnie, the totally neurotic daughter of a
rich aristocrat.  After Minnie and Gavin meet at a party, she takes great
pleasure in disrupting his safe and simple life.  Helena Bonham Carter is
delightfully pathetic and kooky in the role, and Sir John Gielgud, with his
tongue in his cheek, embodies the height of arrogance as her father.
Gavin's eventual love-interest is Jenny, the adorable twenty-year-old
single mother who assists him at the beauty salon; London stage actress
Jane Horrocks' fine performance yields a touchingly sweet character.  Peter
Cook, the great British satirist, appears briefly in the film as Gavin's
uptight employer.</P>
<P>        The scenes of Gavin's home life with his parents are also a treat.
Gavin's over-protective mother (Pat Heywood), whom even Woody Allen would
find overbearing, almost steals the movie.  Her life seems limited to just
two activities: treating Gavin like a 10-year-old and preparing exotic but
inedible meals, such as scalding hot curry and baked chicken with chocolate
sauce.  Gavin and his father's attempts to avoid eating her meals are
extremely amusing.</P>
<P>        GETTING IT RIGHT, for the most part, is very well-crafted, except
for two minor shortcomings.  First, the movie is about 15 minutes too long,
and consequently it loses momentum at times.  Second, the film includes an
altogether extraneous subplot about the domestic problems between Gavin's
best friend, Harry, and his unfaithful lover, Winthrop.  Overall, however,
GETTING IT RIGHT is quite memorable for its humor, depth, sophistication,
and outstanding acting.  Director Kleiser and screenwriter Elizabeth Jane
Howard (adapting her own highly acclaimed novel) deserve praise for finding
just the right tone for this tale of growth, maturation, and
self-discovery.</P>
