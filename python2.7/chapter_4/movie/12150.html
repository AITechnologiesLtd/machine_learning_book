<P>     When considering a title like TWO GIRLS AND A GUY, one can be 
forgiven for expecting something a little risqué.  (In fact, a friend of 
mine quipped, "I didn't think you reviewed movies like that.")  Add to 
that the swirl of controversy regarding the film's brush with an NC-17 
rating, and it's not unreasonable to anticipate more than a little 
flesh, and maybe a threesome or two.  However, anyone who goes into TWO 
GIRLS AND A GUY with those expectations is going to be very 
disappointed.  The movie is far from being a soft-core sex-fest.  In 
fact, this is really just a three-character play featuring absolutely no 
nudity. </P>
<P>     It also features almost no story.  Two women, Carla (Heather 
Graham) and Lou (Natasha Gregson Wagner), discover that their boyfriend, 
Blake (Robert Downey Jr.), has been cheating on each of them with the 
other.  He spends three days a week with Carla and three days a week 
with Lou, then, on the seventh day, he rests.  So they break into his 
apartment and wait for him to return from a trip.  Instead of tying him 
up and torturing him, they talk to him, argue with him, and wait around 
while he makes phone calls to his apparently-sick mother.  One of them 
then has sex with him while the other listens at the door.  Later, it's 
true confessions, and it turns out that faithfulness in this twisted 
triangle is a rare commodity.</P>
<P>     TWO GIRLS AND A GUY survives on acting and dialogue alone.  A fair 
amount of the film, especially Downey's solo sequences, appears to have 
been improvised, and this lends an air of unpredictability to the 
proceedings.  All three characters are well-drawn, ably-portrayed, and 
strangely appealing (even the cad, Blake).  They are creations of the 
moment, however, with only sketchy histories and little depth.  Who are 
they outside the confines of Blake's apartment?  We never learn that.  
About all we know about the two girls is that Carla, the blonde, is 
beautiful, clever, and has a good heart, while Lou, the redhead, is 
cute, streetwise, and self-sufficient.  Blake is a compulsive liar who 
is obsessed with his mother's health.  His favorite song is, not 
surprisingly, "You Don't Know Me."</P>
<P>     To the best of my knowledge, TWO GIRLS AND A GUY was never produced 
on stage, but it could have been.  The setting is limited to a few rooms 
in an apartment.  The "action" is 90% talking, and, as with any movie of 
this sort, the quality of the acting is crucial.  All three leads are up 
to the task, which occasionally requires them to perform in lengthy, 
unbroken, dialogue-laden scenes.  Heather Graham, whose recent roles in 
BOOGIE NIGHTS and LOST IN SPACE have increased her exposure, is 
excellent as the reserved Carla.  Likewise, Natasha Gregson Wagner (the 
daughter of Natalie Wood and stepdaughter of Robert Wagner, for anyone 
who's interested) is effective as the impetuous, energetic Lou.  Both 
actresses use body language and facial expressions to compliment what 
they say.  </P>
<P>     Meanwhile, Robert Downey Jr. is stupendous as Blake.  His talent is 
on display here -- he can sing, dance, and act.  He can be funny and 
tragic.  Also, he appears to be slipping into the Woody Allen mode of 
bringing aspects of his off-screen persona into his parts.  In HUGO 
POOL, his own father cast him as a stoned, deranged egomaniac.  Here, 
there's a scene where he whispers the following lines to a mirror:  "Why 
do you do this?  Is this how you want to live the rest of your life?"  
It's impossible not to see this short monologue as self-referential. </P>
<P>     So why the almost-NC-17 (which was eventually demoted to an R after 
director James Toback re-edited the offending scene umpteen times)?  
Penetration?  Gynecological close-ups?  Nope.  It's because the members 
of the MPAA have vivid imaginations.  They interpreted a certain scene 
to represent something that no one under 18 should be exposed to.  
(Personally, I thought the girl was just looking for a spot on the guy's 
underpants, and that he then kindly returned the favor.)  Never mind 
that it's not as unsettling as watching several hundred dead bodies bob 
around in the water like corks (TITANIC; rated PG-13) or as disturbing 
as viewing people getting disemboweled, decapitated, and mutilated by 
hooks, knives, and other sharp objects (any horror movie; rated R).  
Most curious of all, not only is the sex scene in TWO GIRLS AND A GUY 
unrevealing, but it's not even especially erotic.  </P>
<P>     For the most part, TWO GIRLS AND A GUY is lightly entertaining if 
you enjoy this sort of movie -- great performances, good dialogue, and a 
minimal plot.  It's more of a comedy than a drama, although the final 
fifteen minutes feature a peculiar, unwelcome change in tone.  With the 
exception of a strangely philosophical mediation on monogamy, the film's 
dialogue is surprisingly shallow.  Most movies like this (such as THE 
DESIGNATED MOURNER) spend lengthy stretches on deep issues.  Not so 
here, where Toback keeps the material accessible.  All-in-all, TWO GIRLS 
AND A GUY is a has its share of enjoyable moments, but there aren't 
enough of them to fill up the 84-minute running time.</P>
