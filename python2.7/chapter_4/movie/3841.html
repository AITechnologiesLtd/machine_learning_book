<PRE>                                   CRUMB
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Come spend a two-hour visit to the
          Mount Everest of dysfunctional families.  CRUMB is
          a documentary that was seven years in the making
          about the famous underground cartoonist, his
          family, his editors, and his hang-ups.  The
          conclusion the film seems to draw is that this is
          not so much a guy writing really weird comic books
          as a really weird guy writing comics.  Rating: low
          +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Human beings, as evolved animals, have a dual nature.  We have an
intellectual side and an animal side.  The latter we have since we are,
after all, we are animals.  We are forced to spend time eliminating
wastes, we have drives to reproduce ourselves, and we have physical
animal bodies.  But we wall off that part of our lives by doing it in
as much privacy as we can arrange.  Much of what we consider to be
indignity, much of what we find embarrassing, is to be reminded that we
really are biological.  There is sex humor and bathroom humor.  We find
it funny that a President of the United States would vomit on a high
dignitary of Japan because it reminds us that even a President has a
lot in common with all other animals.  CRUMB is a film that says little
more that Robert Crumb is very hung up on the fact that everyone has an
animal side and that his bizarre humor comes out of these obsessions.</P>
<P>     Robert Crumb's nihilistic and misanthropic underground comics
precisely reflect his personality.  The man himself is as misanthropic,
misogynistic, and kinky as the underground comic books he draws and
writes.  Or at least that is the face he is trying to present in the
documentary CRUMB, made by his long-time friend, Terry Zwigoff.  On one
hand the documentary has the air of authenticity because the style of
Crumb's work seems so naturally to arise from the person the film
describes.  But Crumb is obviously someone quite capable of playing
jokes on the documentary maker and his audience.  It might even be to
be expected.  When Crumb describes some of the odder aspects of his
childhood, like his sexual attraction to Bugs Bunny, it could be true.
But it also sounds suspiciously like a put-on in the style of comedian
Emo Philips.  Crumb could be as weird as he wants us to think he is, or
it could be in part a joke or even a publicity stunt.</P>
<P>     As weird as he presents himself, Crumb is a functioning human
being and in the Crumb family that makes him not just not just unusual,
it makes him a real wonder.  Each of the Crumb children we see leads a
psychologically knotted and screwed up dysfunctional life.  The family
peculiarities are due in large part to an abusive father who tried too
hard to force the family to fit his concept of a norm.  We meet three
brothers: Robert, the younger Max, and the older Charles.  (Two sisters
understandably did not want any part of the documentary and perhaps the
family.)  The oldest of the brothers is the suicidal Charles who has
retreated from the world, making himself a recluse in part due to the
drug treatments for his self-destructive impulses.  Robert's brother
Max supports himself by begging on the street and in his spare time
performing feats of yoga.  The boys continue to rebel against their
father and society in general in many different ways.  At one time the
standard Crumb family mode of rebellion was to draw amateur comic books
and this has made one of the boys moderately rich and sort of famous.</P>
<P>     In the course of the documentary Crumb tells the camera about his
background and particularly his sexual hangups.  Bugs Bunny gave way to
a marginally more normal fixation on Sheena, Queen of the Jungle, the
heroine of a 1955 syndicated television series.  The Crumb brothers
were social outcasts in school and continued to be so in the drug
culture.  In spite of rumors that he was at one time "in" with well-
known rock groups, he was an outcast with just about everyone but his
family.</P>
<P>     His discussions in the film include his sexual fetishes,
particularly sitting on women's shoes and riding women piggy-back.  We
are told that he is not much interested in sex in usual way, though he
does have a daughter who is apparently his own.  What we do discover is
that he has a seriously negative attitude about nearly everything that
strikes him as being normal and he seems bitter about just about all
that is around him.  One temporary exception is France; he seems to
think that he will like France and in the course of the making of the
film he moves there.  Though we do not find out in the film, it seems
very likely that he will be disappointed as much by that as by just
about everything else in his life.</P>
<P>     The film's view of Crumb is at times ironic.  While on one hand he
claims to be very disinterested in being successful and is unwilling to
make some effort that would make his art more saleable, he complains
bitterly how his most famous pieces of art did not pay him very well
and all the profits are going to others.  He claims he was "ripped off"
though, in fact, from his account given at a lecture, it sounds more
likely that he just made a bad bargain and sold off the rights for
considerably less than they would eventually be worth.  The three most
successful works were the "Keep on Truckin'" cartoon, the "Cheap
Thrills" album cover, and the film rights to his character "Fritz the
Cat."  Zwigoff's documentary style is very often just to let the camera
roll as Robert talks with his brother frankly about sex or describing
their masturbation or toilet habits.</P>
<P>     There are some nice ironies captured on film.  Another artist,
comments she was never bothered by Crumb's material--some of which it
appears was quite racist, at least on the surface.  But she did object
when his cartoons started taking a misogynist tone, including
mutilation fantasies.  The film does make some interesting points when
it suggests that the image of the wholesome family--the "Leave it to
Beaver" family--that was considered the ideal in the Fifties--may have
been a reaction to WWII in that people found the stable family
reassuring.  It is unclear, however, why there was no similar reaction
to the Korean and Vietnam wars.</P>
<P>     While I am not sure CRUMB lives up to the expectations raised by
some of the critical comment, it is an engrossing documentary with the
same sort of unaccountable fascination that a dead horse by the side of
the road has.  Rate it a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
