                       A film review by Max Hoffmann
                        Copyright 1994 Max Hoffmann</PRE>

<PRE>Rating: Scale 1-10 (10 = highest) 8.5</PRE>
<P>     A delightful, satirical romp that works on nearly every level,
reminiscent of BUCKAROO BANZAI and LIQUID SKY.  Raw fish lips have
become the rage in trendy New York restaurants.  Contaminated fish from
Orchid Island (where nuclear waste is dumped, in real life) shows
up, and the unwelcomed side effects begin.  Yuppies begin speaking in
tongues; pets glow in the dark and spontaneously combust.  A lesbian
couple (one of whom works in the restaurant) suspect that "something is
up," and the trauma hits home when their daughter disappears.</P>
<P>     The cast is a rainbow of racial and ethnic types.  An East Indian
has a native American Indian father.  A Hispanic friend constantly
recites passages from Lorca, an African American woman with a cable
access show called "Ask Minny" speaks out about the global conspiracy
by "GX" (who's logo and TV ad campaigns look suspiciously like "GE, we
bring good things to light), the romantic male lead is a scrumptious
Japanese-American actor (who deserves more, more screen time)....</P>
<P>     Many attempts to build films around topical issues with "in your
face" solutions have failed in the past.  Somehow, director Shu Lea
Cheang pulls it off with enviable finesse.  The film is very
low-budget, but Cheang leverages that effectively by deliberately using
cheap, satirical sets and art direction.  With highly "affordable"
hardware (wire cable spools with shallow water filled aquariums fitted
with fluorescent tubes) she creates just the right atmosphere in the
chi chi toxic cafe.  A hodge podge of thrift store items look like the
kooky wardrobe these characters might actually wear in real life.  By
the way, a soundtrack should be made from Vernon Reid's compelling
score.</P>
<P>     The film is riddled with cameos by performance art fixtures like
Ron Vawter, Karen Finley, Laurie Carlos and Robbie McCauley.  NY's
"Angels in America" director George C. Wolfe appears on one news
segment as a distraught cat owner.  (By the way, there are a couple of
hilarious animated TV commercials, the "Eco Catfood" segment has to be
seen to be believed.)  The cast leads, filled with unknowns, are
talented and sufficiently appealing to hold your attention throughout
the endless antics.</P>
<P>     The script is more than a bit disjointed, and through the first
reel it's an effort to keep track of the large cast and their myriad
connections with one another.  But the film has many memorable,
compelling images, and far more "moments" than the average Hollywood
fare offers today.  I suspect that Cheang is a far better director than
screenwriter.  Coupled with the right author, her possibolities are
endless.</P>
<P>     Definitely worth seeing, (though not a "must see").  Look for it
to resurface in SF Bay area at the Roxie or the Red Vic.  A probable
future offering in the Facets video catalog, or maybe on cable's "USA
Up All Night."</P>
<P>     In the director's talk, Cheang revealed that "Kill" means stream
in Dutch.  She hoped to show how, globally speaking, we can't soil our
own nest.  What we put out, even on Orchid Island, eventually comes
back to us.  Cheang is a feisty, diminutive Chinese woman, with a
fabulous "dykes on bikes" haircut.  She unapologetically approached
very conservative foundations for grant money and funding (including
the spineless NEA) and managed to get it without question!  They funded
the project, even after having read the script, including Lesbian love
scenes.  (Maybe we should send her to PBS headquarters, where they just
wet their pants over filming the sequel to "Tales of the City.")  Cheang
is living proof that many times, the best "man" for the job is a
woman.</P>
