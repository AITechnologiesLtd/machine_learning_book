<PRE>                         HILARY AND JACKIE 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                      Copyright 1999 Timothy Voon
                     3 out of 5 for sharing too much</PRE>
<P>Cast: Emily Watson, Rachel Griffiths, David Morrissey, James Frain.
Screenplay: Frank Cottrell Boyce, based on the memoir "A Genius in the
Family" by Hilary and Piers Du Pre.
Producers: Andy Paterson and Nicholas Kent.
Director: Anand Tucker.</P>
<P>1. Horror of horrors, husband sharing! This just does not fall into my
category of happy movie watching, and there isn't even a good reason
(maybe IVF?) for the request (prove that you love me). My response would
be ‘let's go out to lunch', but loaning my life partner to a sibling for
a sexscapade, is not the answer to loneliness. These sisters, as you
could probably imagine are closer than the average, if one gets away
with asking and then granting such a request. However, the husband is
also to blame for agreeing to it in the first place.
2. Let's not get way laid by this issue, because there is more to this
movie besides sharing husbands. That is … sibling rivalry. Yes, and in
this case, the younger sister Jackie goes to great lengths (learning the
chelo) to outdo her older sister Hilary (who plays the flute). Jackie
does eventually outshine Hilary by becoming an international artist,
whilst Hilary fades into the obscurity of family life and love. Which
would you choose? Fame and fortune or settle for the ordinary and being
truly loved for what you are? Most people would probably answer both,
but in many cases one is sacrificed for the other.
3. Spot on acting for both Rachel Griffiths and Emily Watson who bring
to life two sisters who made a promise one summer's day on the beach,
that somehow, in the time of need, they would always be there for one
another, even in death.</P>
