<P>             Sagebrush High School Class of 1987 graduates Romy White
(Mira Sorvino) and Michele Weinberger (Lisa Kudrow) share a
dream. Along with everyone else who was ever snubbed by the popular
clique in school, they want to get even.</P>
<P>    So the duo determine to bury their true underachieving
selves and attend their 10-year reunion in Tucson as brilliant
businesswomen who've made a fortune in L.A. After all, says Romy,
``What's the point of going if we're not going to impress people?''</P>
<P>  And so begins ``Romy and Michele's High School Reunion,''
which could just as easily have been called ``Ditzy and Ditzier.''
Friends since their teens, when Romy was chubby and Michele was stuck
in a squeaky neck brace, the two have spent the past decade
clubhopping, working run-of-the-mill jobs and wearing out their video
of ``Pretty Woman.''</P>
<P>  Living large has never been in their picture, but ``we never
had a really good reason like a reunion to motivate us,'' says Romy.</P>
<P>  Now, Romy has decided to go on a fat-free diet: ``nothing
but Gummi Bears, jelly beans and candy corn.'' Michele has made
stylish power-suits on her sewing machine. A Jaguar convertible has
been borrowed for transportation.</P>
<P>  Getting a hot boyfriend to escort them isn't so simple,
however. Romy applies to MTV's ``Singled Out,'' only to be rebuffed by
a production assistant, who sneers, ``Our cut-off age is 25. Try
VH1.'' Lines like that give ``Romy and Michele'' the kind of hip cache
that made ``Clueless'' all the rage two years ago.</P>
<P>  Consumed by the grand delusion that they're much cooler than
they actually are, Romy and Michele could easily have been turned into
self-indulgent culture vultures, but writer Robin Schiff manages to
keep them delightfully quirky.</P>
<P>  After such a portentous build-up, however, the reunion
itself seems a little flat. Most of what you might expect to happen
happens: the one-time dreamboat is now an alcoholic, the class nerd
has struck it rich, etc.  Even with only 91 minutes to fill, Schiff
runs out of plot and has to throw in an overextended fantasy sequence
to keep things going.</P>
<P>  As it is, the movie's best moments are often incidental, as
when Michele goes job-hunting in Beverly Hills or Romy evades a
pick-up artist by hobbling away, telling him ``Excuse me, I cut my
foot earlier and my shoe is filling up with blood.''</P>
<P>  Best of all is a tense argument between the women about
who's the cutest one, or rather who's ``the Mary'' and who's ``the
Rhoda.''</P>
<P>  Much of the comedy's success stems from Sorvino, who proves
her Oscar for ``Mighty Aphrodite'' was not a one-shot triumph. Her
delivery and timing are absolutely impeccable, and Sorvino seems to
empathize with Romy's compulsion to dazzle. ``If anybody needs to make
a call, I've got a phone,'' Romy announces to sarcastic ``A-group''
witches she's trying to impress, completely unaware that the device
lost its ``wow'' factor years ago.</P>
<P>  Kudrow makes the best of Michele, but the character is not
far removed from her TV role as Phoebe on ``Friends,'' and Schiff
shortchanges Michele in the wisecrack department.</P>
<P>  The most acidic quips go to the priceless Janeane Garofalo,
as the endlessly crabby Heather Mooney, who holds a grudge against
Sagebrush High in general and herself in particular. As she proved in
``Reality Bites'' and ``The Truth About Cats and Dogs,'' nobody does
self-loathing better than Garofalo, and her few scenes spark the
picture.</P>
<P>  Like the concurrent reunion-themed ``Grosse Pointe Blank,''
``Romy and Michele'' features a marvelous soundtrack of '80s anthems,
from the Vapors' ``Turning Japanese'' and the Pretenders ``Don't Get
Me Wrong'' to Kenny Loggins' ``Footloose,'' which Romy and Michele
struggle in vain to sing along with.</P>
<P>  Even when the comedy runs out of steam, it's hard to knock
any movie that dares to include not one, but two totally awsome hits
by Bananarama, the Romy and Michele of pop.</P>
