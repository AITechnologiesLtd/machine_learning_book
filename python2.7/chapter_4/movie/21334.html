<P>starring Meryl Streep, Angela Bassett, Aidan Quinn, Jane Leeves
screenplay by Pamela Gray
directed by Wes Craven</P>
<P>I must preface this review by admitting how much I despise the title
Music of the Heart-NASA's Think Tank couldn't come up with something
more generic. Wes Craven's new pic was more provocatively (and
appropriately) called 50 Violins in development, and the switch only
proves how far distributor Miramax has strayed from its edgy roots.
Almost as infuriating is the positioning of an 'N Sync/Gloria Estafan
duet as Music of the Heart's theme song-this unlistenable ballad opens
and closes a film about music appreciation. </P>
<P>Faithfully based on the Oscar-nominated documentary Small Wonders,
Music of the Heart stars Streep as Roberta Guaspari, a divorced mother
of two sons who develops, at the urging of Brian, a man she met in
high school (Quinn), a music program for Harlem gradeschoolers. The
reception from staff, students, and parents of students is cool at
first (racial issues, for the most part), but Roberta's dedication
eventually wins over all three parties. </P>
<P>The story shares not only its basic outline with Mr. Holland's Opus
but also an extremely frustrating "# Years Later" title card that
weakly compacts Roberta's experiences as an educator. (Are both movies
telling us that the life of a teacher is so repetitive that the
intervening years between getting hired and retiring are a write-off?)
I preferred what Craven had going in its first half: the moralizing
was kept to a minimum, the narrative took unexpected turns (who could
anticipate the outcome of Roberta's romance with Brian?), and
Roberta's militaristic conduct in the classroom provided a refreshing
take on the To Sir, With Love standard-no affable Mr. Holland is she. </P>
<P>Unintentional humour, soapboxing, and slack direction mar Music of the
Heart's second half. When a few of Roberta's graduates return to strut
their stuff for the new batch of students, they are conveniently the
children we met earlier all grown up. When the horror of urban life in
the nineties hits Roberta, the sequence plays like one from a moldy
"ABC Afterschool Special". More gravely, this plot point and many
others are not satisfactorily paid off. Take, for example, the story
thread regarding Roberta's oldest son, Nick (played Michael Angarano
at 7 and Charlie Hofheimer at 17), who is almost expelled for a spate
of wild behaviour (emphasized in cheesy, choppy slow motion). One
heart-to-heart with Roberta later and he's a cherubic goodie-goodie
again. The primary grades are tough on a kid, especially in inner
cities-how were his problems resolved outside the home? (Young Nick
did, after all, almost murder another little boy.) </P>
<P>Craven's biggest blunder is to build audience anticipation for a
rendez-vous between real-life master violinist Isaac Stern and the
small wonders. Roberta's funding is cut, so she opts to organize
(after she, Principal Williams (Bassett), a journalist (Leeves), and
what seems like everybody else in town have sat around in Roberta's
enormous living room the same way the Muppets do tossing out
harebrained ideas) a benefit concert, the venue for which hinges on
Stern's input. His name is also mentioned in virtually every scene
leading up to the climax, yet his cameo amounts to one shot. Blink and
you'll miss him. I wanted a moment in which the physically disabled
Isaac introduces himself to the girl who also can't stand up when she
plays her instrument, even if it didn't actually happen-Gray's
screenplay is, oddly, not formulaic enough.</P>
<P>You'll notice that up to this point I have neglected to discuss Wes "A
Nightmare on Elm Street" Craven's filmmaking background. I didn't feel
it necessary until moments ago I had an epiphany: timing is everything
in horror movies and comedies-there's little in Music of the Heart, a
light drama, that exercises Craven's well-honed editing skills, save
for a few genuinely amusing takes from Josh Pais as Roberta's teaching
rival, Dennis. That said, Craven just turned sixty, and I fully
sympathize with his desire to leave fright flicks. After two excellent
Scream pictures and a handful of other creepy classics, he's eligible
for retirement from the genre, but he does seem a little lost without
a reason to scare us.</P>
