<P>     Had General Colin Powell seen this film, his decision not to run
for the Presidency might have come earlier.  Who, in his or her sane
mind, wants to be President? Look at the beginning of the film.  It
shows the start of President Andrew Shepherd's (Michael Douglas) day.
It's a talk-as-you-walk clipetty clop sequence of the President rushing
through the corridors of power to his office, with a busy, busy staff
briefing him, asking him to make decisions, fast, fast, and whispering
in his ear the names of persons who greet him.</P>
<P>     Soon President Andy starts remind you of President Bill.  The main
difference is that this President lost his wife to cancer three years
ago.  She was his one and only love.  Now, with high approval ratings,
he has his eye on re-election.</P>
<P>     Otherwise, he has a teen-age daughter, shows liberal tendencies
("liberal" here meaning a positive seven-letter word, not a four-letter
insult), cares for the Nation in general and for good causes in
particular, such as the environment and gun control.  He is a Good
Man--and lonely. (Not enough is made of his solitude).</P>
<P>     Perhaps we shouldn't pity him too much when we see what a
dazzlingly efficient and devoted staff he has, all good people, some
with great symbolic names.  President Shepherd's own is pastoral and
paternal.  His Chief of Staff and best friend (Martin Sheen) is
A. J. MacInerney.  (Godard, I bet, would have preferred
I. B. M. Macintosh).  His pollster is Leon Kodak.  His outspoken
advisor (Michael J. Fox), obviously patterned after George
Stephanopoulos, is Lewis Rothschild--one minority name cannily
replacing another.</P>
<P>     The film rapidly introduces the sinuosities of Washington, their
grandeur, pettiness, and in the President's case, some examples of a
decent person practicing "Real Politik."  Soon the President and Sydney
Wade (Annette Bening), a hot shot environmental lawyer-lobbyist, meet
cute, roughly in the Tracy-Hepburn tradition of initial antagonism.</P>
<P>     For non-philanderer Andy, it's love at first sight, so quick that
you have to wonder.  Still, Sydney is charming, has personality and is
no bimbo.  Andy makes overtures, calls to invite the disbelieving
Sydney (she thinks it's a hoax) to be his date at a State dinner.</P>
<P>     The function is in honor of the new President of France and his
wife.  They are bored because, I suppose, of the well-known lack of
social graces in America.  Because, too, the American President is too
wrapped up in Sydney.  Also because he speaks no French.</P>
<P>     Sydney does, with an atrocious accent, and saves the day.  The
whole sequence (as weak as any, especially in the un-etiquettish way
Shepherd flaunts Sydney) would have been bad enough without adding
linguistic insult to plot injury.  The French President responds in his
native language, which is so incredibly, lousily un-French that I can
predict riotous laughter when this movie gets to Paris.</P>
<P>     Now, one of the better aspects of this film is its impressive
studio reconstruction (with liberties) of the White House.  But if you
can't trust Hollywood to find just one Frenchman for the microscopic
part of Monsieur le President, what can you trust it for?  It is
appalling.</P>
<P>     Research on who played the French Presidential couple has a
funnier pay-off than anything in the film: the thespians are called
Clement Von Franckenstein and Efrat La Vie.</P>
<P>     Sydney rapidly responds to the President's advances, with royal
disregard for safe sex.  What we have here is really a return to
Ruritanian romances between royalty and commoners.  In the early stages
of this love affair, Douglas is more amusing than Bening.  Like the
insulated George Bush who was amazed by supermarket uses of check-out
scanners, Mr.  Shepherd does not know how to order flowers, pay for
things or even get an outside phone line.</P>
<P>     The satire is pleasant.  On the other hand, Bening who normally
overwhelms all around her, is herself so overwhelmed by the
Presidential advances that her reactions are of the "Oh, my God, the
Most Powerful Man in the World has asked me out!...  Is in love with
me...  Has slept with me!."  This excessive kowtowing and shuffling of
feet makes one wonder if Bening's love for Douglas is not initially a
form of Presidentolatry and Groupieism.</P>
<P>     Mercifully, as the relation progresses, the couple become more of
a man and a woman in love.  The film acquires more convinction.  The
protagonists get more likable.  What also helps is the old Heroes-in-
Adversity ploy.  The opposition, led by Richard Dreyfuss as the
unpleasant Minority Leader, Republican Presidential candidate and
Senator from Kansas Bob Rumson (you get the gag), adopts smear tactics
vis-a-vis the President and his lady.  Those ridiculous charges will
lead to the Mr.  Shepherd showing his mettle, doing the right thing by
his conscience, his party, his country, the ACLU and his woman, and
closing the movie with one of those cornily warm and eloquent "Wow!"
speeches that were the domain of Frank Capra's heroes.</P>
<P>     There's not a single scene in THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT that breaks
new filmic ground.  The movie does not hold water.  It is not really
interesting, yet, paradoxically, it does hold your interest.</P>
<P>     The actors are all very good, in a "deja played" sort of way.
Douglas, as a rule likable only when playing bad guys, is here a
simpatico, straight arrow  (for a politico) good guy.  The movie is
sweet and idealistic.  Hollywoodisms, silliness and all, it contains a
certain amount of Beltway truth.  And it moves at a fast, un-boring
clip.  It may also be that today we need the reassurances of Capracorn
just as much as in the days of Mr. Deeds, Mr. Smith and John Doe.</P>
