<P>Taylor Hackford's latest effort, "The Devil's Advocate," isn't a dreadful
effort, but it could have been much better than it is. The premise is
played for thrills--if there had been thought involved, we might have
gotten perhaps a glimpse or two of consideration about whether a lawyer
should go against his conscience in defending someone he believes to be
guilty. Or, for that matter, whether anyone should uphold the standards of
the profession regardless of moral compunctions. These are real questions,
but it would take an entirely different film to address them--and Hackford
did not, ironically, have many Bigger Issues in mind in making this.</P>
<P>The plot: Kevin Lomax, a young Florida lawyer (Keanu Reeves), is recruited
by a prestigious New York firm, and he heads to the Big Apple with wife
Mary Ann (Charlize Theron) in tow, over the objections of a Bible-thumping
mother (Judith Ivey). His success in winning cases continues, but only to
serve as contrast to his wife's descent into madness and his own moral
disintegration, as it turns out that the firm is involved in rather more
than defending rich clients. And so it turns out that...</P>
<P>Stop a moment. Pretend that you don't know what the real twist is; pretend
that the trailers didn't give it away. How much more interesting a movie
might this have been if it had turned out that the firm was simply an
ordinary one, representing rich clients who wanted to buy their way out of
a conviction? It would be "The Firm" in New York, you say, but it
wouldn't--at least, it wouldn't have to be. There's plenty of room for
development along these lines: the cases that the lawyer gets handed get
more and more questionable, until finally his conscience steps in and he
says no. Firm: where's your conscience been up to now? Lawyer: well, maybe
it should have been there all along. There are a variety of places it
could go from there, some more interesting than others, but at a time when
lawyer jokes are standard, perhaps that would have been a more noteworthy
movie than this.</P>
<P>What we do get, as you no doubt know: the firm turns out to be operated by
none other than ol' Scratch himself (Al Pacino), and the various partners
and employees are a variety of demonic minions and henchmen. Mary Ann's
deterioration is spurred along by her recognition of what's really going
on--as illustrated by various characters' faces morphing between human and
monster, well placed and very effective. Things spin way out of control,
naturally, leading to a climactic bit of over-the-top monologue by
Pacino--but by then, the horror element has taken over and all
restrictions on realism are off, plotwise. Various twists ensue, none of
them successful at bringing things back to this planet.  </P>
<P>Where did this go wrong? One of the problems is that Reeves is supposed to
be playing a character; it's one thing to let a plot take surreal twists,
but it's quite another to have supposedly ordinary folks whose actions
just aren't believable. True, there is exactly one role that Reeves can
convey effectively--clueless surfer dude--and it isn't his fault if
misguided directors keep calling him and shoving him into parts that don't
involve saying "excellent" repeatedly. But he's so painfully ineffective
that it's rarely clear what he wants to convey, or what his character is
supposed to be thinking. Does he neglect his wife completely because he's
self-centered? Obtuse? Stupid? It's hard to tell. This is, in other words,
a remarkable bad performance by Reeves; ordinary bad performances present
certain ideas to the audience ineptly, in ways that make the audience
think, hey, may as well hold up a sign saying THIS IS WHAT I'M THINKING,
but what Reeves manages here is a character with no discernible
motivations at all. He's just there, and the plot goes on around him. The
part might have been better written, perhaps, but with only one mode of
delivery, Reeves isn't likely to take advantage of what's there. (Response
to Pacino's question on whether he goes to church: "I guess I'm on parole
for time served," in monotone. What is he? Joking? Bitter? Bemused?
Rueful? The world may never know.)</P>
<P>Pacino is quite good, as usual--and, at one particularly memorable moment,
he even makes fun of Reeves' clunky intonation. The guess here is that the
screenplay called for him to make fun of the southern accent that Lomax is
supposed to have, but the way that accent comes and goes--and the comic
qualities of Reeves' voice even without a silly affectation--makes it even
funnier. As John Milton, Beelzebub's disguise (my, my, literacy in 
Hollywood, will wonders never cease?), Pacino is appropriately smarmy and
insinuating; as the real thing, veil down, he is mesmerizing, despite some
gratuitous bits. (Lip-syncing to Frank Sinatra?) The contrast between the
nuance of the lawyer persona-- only a leer here or a chuckle there suggest
anything more sinister--and the sheer over-the-top force of the Devil with
the chance to say everything that's on his mind is the best part of
Pacino's performance.</P>
<P>Theron steals virtually every scene from Reeves--I would call it taking
candy from a baby, but we've had enough Keanu- bashing already--and
genuinely captivates even with not much to do besides go to pieces. (Her
role is that of the ordinary person trapped in a horror movie, and she
captures the audience's sympathy. Reeves, though his role is not so
dissimilar, is not recognizable as an ordinary person.) Most of the visual
shocks in the movie are hers--we see most of the shocking images at the
same time she does--and her reactions are convincing enough that we care
about what happens to her. If there is a downside to Theron's performance,
it's that her baby-face beauty makes Keanu looking at other women rather
improbable. (Plus, though it isn't her fault, Reeves hardly shows her any
convincing affection, so it isn't clear why she'd be upset when he starts
to neglect her.)</P>
<P>As noted, there is something of an identity crisis here, in that
Hackford has the beginning of a moral drama going on and then lets it get
all supernatural--in short, become a horror film. That's his right, of
course, and it's not unprecedented for horror films to be less than fully
logically realized--but there's a certain silliness in casting the Devil
with no real acknowledgment of a supernatural counterpart. Ivey has little
to do as the Bible-carrying mother who warns dolorously of the temptations
of the city; it's such a caricature that the audience doesn't take her
seriously. Her character is weak--and, even, shallow--to the point that we
don't necessarily think she's sincere. And the only other character to
acknowledge the existence of God is, naturally, Pacino, whose rant against
God ("he's a SADist!") seem just a bit bizarre given that Reeves has never
expressed any belief. Like, who you tryin' to convince, Al? The point is
that the Devil is classically imagined as actually trying to steal souls;
with no one to steal them from, the exercise feels a little dumb. All that
was required was some implication that anyone in the movie was trying to
do the right thing (ideally, out of some sense of relationship to God, but
let's not get picky), and Pacino was twisting their motives or playing up
their frailties to ensnare them. But Reeves has no apparent interest in
the right thing. Again, the idea isn't necessarily that Hackford should
have given God a fair shake, a chance to yell back at Pacino, merely that,
since God's existence is presupposed, there should have been at least a
scene or two that didn't paint that belief is silly and antiquated. A
conflict between good and evil might have been compelling; when good
wasn't allowed to show up, what was left became a tad uninvolving.</P>
<P>Despite the drawbacks, there are many memorable moments here,
chief among them Theron's death; the blood on Reeves' shirt in the
following scenes, underscoring what happens, is perhaps the best thing
about his performance. The visuals are skillful--a sex scene where Theron
is exchanged, in Reeves' mind, with another woman, a chilling dream
sequence involving Theron and a baby--and genuinely jarring. If you can
suspend disbelief sufficiently to enjoy the ride, give it a shot; if
poorly realized characters bug you, skip it.</P>

<P>The room is as you left it; your last touch--
A thoughtless pressure, knowing not itself
As saintly--hallows now each simple thing,
Hallows and glorifies, and glows between
The dust's gray fingers, like a shielded light.</P>
