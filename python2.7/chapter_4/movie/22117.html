<P>   Have you ever wondered about the self-destructiveness of
showbiz groups? No matter how successful their association,
they tend to break up, the individuals rarely doing as well
thereafter as when they were part of a flourishing team. 
Even when the entertainers stay together, personality
clashes cause uncomfortable friction.  Everyone knows that
long-term collaborators Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice
are not two peas in a pod.  We have less information about
the compatibility of Betty Comden with Adolph Green or Ira
Gershwin with his brother George, Alan Jay Lerner with
Frederick Loewe or George S. Kaufman with Moss Hart. 
Better known is the discord between William Schwenck
Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan, librettist and composer
respectively of some of the world's most celebrated, joyous,
and satiric operettas.  Mike Leigh, known for his imaginative
"Secrets and Lies" and for his less accessible "Naked," has
just come out with a ravishing biopic about the two great
composers of English operetta focusing (in the first half) on
their discord while opening the movie up to a gorgeous
second half featuring scenes from "The Mikado."  This is the
not the first time that G&S have had their lives translated to
the screen.  In 1953 Sidney Gilliat directed "The Great Gilbert
and Sullivan" (known in Britain as "The Story of Gilbert and
Sullivan"), which critic Leonard Maltin cited as "a flavorful
biography of operetta composers with many highlights from
their works."</P>
<P>    Viewers who have mixed feelings about the film are
likely to say that the first part drags while the second picks up
in spectacle and entertainment value, but this is to disparage
the subtle ways that Mike Leigh signifies the musical duo's
conflict.  They don't come out with fists flying in the style of
David Fincher's "Fight Club" nor do they shout like  Al Pacino
in "The Insider."  These folks are British, after all, and they
sublimate their anger into their works, fourteen musical
compositions which lightly and effectively satirize the British
government and society of their Victorian times.  As director
Leigh graphically but delicately shows us, on the surface the
incident which almost caused their falling out occurred after
the critical and box-office flop in 1884 of the operetta
"Princess Ida" whose libretto was written by William
Schwenck Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) and composed and
directed by his colleague, Sir Arthur Sullivan (Allan
Corduner).  At that point, Sullivan is ready to break the
contract that the creative people had with producer Richard
D'oyly Carte (Ron Cook) to come up with a new work every
year because, Sullivan insists, the topsy-turvy (not believable)
plots turned out by the librettist, all loose ends neatly tied
together with contrived finales, were banal.  After carefully
taking in the many details woven into this stunning tapestry of
a musical biopic, however, you might conclude that below the
surface, what matters most are the personality differences. 
Gilbert is married, a cranky and uptight fellow who is shown
to be uncomfortable with success and who has disappointed
his wife--whom he has not let into his world.  Sullivan, by
contrast, is more of a free-living, easy-to-get-along with sort,
of mild disposition, living with a mistress--a decidedly
un-Victorian arrangement.  One suspects that another cause
of friction is the envy that Gilbert might have felt that he,
unlike his partner, had not yet been given a title by the
Queen.  They are so estranged, in fact, that quite a bit of
time passes in the film before we see the two men in the
same frame.</P>
<P>   Happily for the partnership, success comes when Lucy
Gilbert (Lesley Manville), who is the librettist's wife, takes him
kicking and screaming to a Japanese exhibition in London
where Gilbert gets the idea for a new production of grander
design and more resonance than anything done before. 
Thus, "The Mikado" is born.</P>
<P>   Like Artisan Entertainment's "Illuminata," directed by John
Turturro, this USA/October release takes us behind the stage
to see what goes on during rehearsals--the personal
problems and anxieties faced by the performers, the conflicts
that at least two of the company have with the costume
designer, the heartbreak caused when the cantankerous
Gilbert decides just one day before the opening night of "The
Mikado" to cut a major song delivered by its star, Richard
Temple (Timothy Spall).  These being Victorian times, the
backstage scenarios highlight the priggishness of one
performer who insists that wearing a Japanese outfit that runs
down only to his knees would be undignified--to which the
costume designer indignantly responds that he had carefully
researched the outfits worn by the Japanese of medieval
times.  </P>
<P>   While "Topsy-Turvy" is a departure from Mike Leigh's usual
slice-of-life bent, the director makes clever use of fast-
forwards to advance from the rehearsal of a single scene to
its execution, then returns to the preparation period only to
advance once again to the final, costumed delivery of the
scene.  The music is glorious and, in fact, the polished
performances of this talented ensemble makes me lose some
of the regard I've had for productions seen years ago which,
by contrast, seem like amateur hour.  The principal
reservation I have is that those in the audience who may not
be aficionados of G&S works will leave the theater in the dark
about the themes of the compositions.  Just what is "The
Mikado"--a piece which lampoons British society but which
distances the satire by situating the action in Japan?  Leigh's
dialogue is as witty as his direction is fluid and surely, come
awards time, costume designer Lindy Hemming and
production designer Eve Stuart should garner nominations. 
Sir Arthur Sullivan's music has been adapted for this picture
by Carl Davis, all photographed by Dick Pope on location in
Hertfordshire, Surrey and London as well as in a studio.</P>
