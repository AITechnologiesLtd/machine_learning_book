<PRE>Silent Fall (1994)
* 1/2
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1998 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>SILENT FALL has the shreds and shards of a far better movie lurking around
inside it somewhere.  It takes the form of a psychological thriller, where
the detectives work hand-in-glove with psychiatrists to disentangle the mind
of a witness to a murder.  The witness is an autistic little boy, and there
are strong hints that he is probably the killer as well -- after all, they
found him swinging the knife while standing over his parent's corpses.</P>
<P>Richard Dreyfuss is the psychiatrist, and it is to his credit that he does
the best job he can in a movie of such abysmal silliness.  He has one very
nice scene where he uses a deck of cards as a metaphor for how to jog the
kid's memory.  Unfortunately, like so many other ham-handed scripts, the
metaphor is hammered on again and again until its initial charm collapses.</P>
<P>I had high hopes going into this movie.  For the most part, psychiatrists
get short shrift in films: they get portrayed as soulless technicians (ONE
FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST), or fiendish maniacs (BAD DREAMS), or goofy and
ineffectual softies (AMOS & ANDREW).  Dreyfuss plays a fellow with smarts
and presence, and he does a decent job of soldiering on while the film
collapses around him.  John Lithgow gets dragged in for a wasteful little
cameo as a drug-dispensing doctor, which reminded me of what a good actor he
is when he's not in junk like this.</P>
<P>The movie has so few real ideas about its alleged subjects that it's
distressing.  Take, for instance, the murder investigation.  If you were a
cop, would you let the children of the murder victims live in their house
while it would still be a crime scene?  The movie's insights into autism are
also pretty much nonexistent.  Autism, like the rest of the movie's conceits
with psychology, are just cheap hooks onto which to hang the rest of the
plot.  And if there is another thriller out there with a more contrived mess
of a plot than this one -- write me, I've got cigars.</P>
<P>The film's big climax has Dreyfuss getting the kid to re-enact almost on cue
what he witnessed.  Never mind if the people in the movie watching this
thought it was believable: did anyone FILMING it think it was believable?
Really?</P>
