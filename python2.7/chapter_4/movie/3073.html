<PRE>                             THE LAST SEDUCTION
                       A film review by Eric Grossman
                   Copyright 1994 LOS ANGELES INDEPENDENT</PRE>
<P>     A good thriller is increasingly hard to come by.  All too often,
filmmakers rely on tired genre conventions and clics that never raise
the audience's heart rate above resting.  Fortunately, THE LAST
SEDUCTION, playing at Laemmle's Sunset-5, does not fall into this
trap.  Director John Dahl, who has traveled the cinematic road of film
noir before with his two previous outings, KILL ME AGAIN and RED ROCK
WEST, does a superb job in creating subtle, powerful tension in this
simple but engaging story.</P>
<P>     Linda Fiorentino gives as a good of a performance that I have seen
this year as Bridget Gregory, a smart, sexy, nefarious woman who
decides to double-cross her seemingly clean-cut husband, Clay (Bill
Pullman), who has just received a large amount of cash from a
drug-deal.  Bridget takes off with the cash and leaves New York as
quickly as possible for Chicago.  On the way, she stops in the small
town of Beston where she meets Mike Swale (Peter Berg), a small town
guy who wants to be bigger than what destiny has planned for him. Mike
immediately falls for Bridget and hopes that her big-city attitude and
pedigree will rub off on him.  With the advice of her lawyer (J.T.
Walsh), Bridget decides to lay low for a while in Beston and she soon
seduces Mike to participate in her twisted schemes.</P>
<P>     The movie is simple enough, but what is interesting is how Dahl
and screenwriter Steve Barancik hook us in with essentially three
characters and a small town.  The movie works on a psychological level,
the place where all thrillers function best.  There are no big
car-chases, no big gun-fights, no buckets of blood, just an amazingly
well written, well acted set of characters, particularly Fiorentino.
She is so cold-hearted, so conniving, so mean, and unfortunately for
the men who get involved with her, so sexy that we cannot help but be
fascinated by her.  The movie takes the femme fatale to new heights and
while this may or may not be progress, we now have a movie where the
woman is truly more smart, more cunning and more dangerous than the men
around her.</P>
<P>     What also makes Fiorentino's performance so good is that Peter
Berg and Bill Pullman play so well against her.  Berg is able to find
the right balance of naive, neediness and suppressed anger for his
character.  Bill Pullman, with his wild facial expressions and
pseudo-calm dialogue creates a sympathetic character whose biggest
fault is that he is smart, but not smart enough to keep up with his
tricky wife.</P>
<P>     Besides allowing Bridget and Mike to meet, the small town setting
for the film was a crucial choice.  There is a scene where Bridget is
walking down a Beston sidewalk and she is taken aback when strangers
smile and say hello.  She is out of her environment but it is fun to
watch how quickly she masters and manipulates it as well as its
people.</P>
<P>     Fresh and original, THE LAST SEDUCTION has all that is good about
a small, independent film while having the production values of a
studio picture.  Linda Pearl's production design, Jeffrey Jur's
cinematography and Eric L. Beason's editing are all first rate.  If
you like film noir, good filmmaking, and suspense, go see this film.</P>
