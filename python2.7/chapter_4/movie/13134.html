<P>The second of this year's two leading-female animated motion pictures
(besides the in-the-rough QUEST FOR CAMELOT), and the third of the last
three (counting 1997's ANASTASIA), MULAN was an animated picture that
had, perhaps, a bit to live up to. Although those last two pictures
weren't really a benchmark, they were a trend, and Disney was charged
with distancing themselves from "normal" fare. Not only that, but as
soon as previews and advance showings began filtering down through the
ranks of the critics, MULAN was hailed as the best Disney animation
since THE LION KING. And while this one isn't as enjoyable as the
African epic of 1994, it is probably the best animated movie since then. </P>
<P>Disney's animated films have progressively become more refined from the
typical children's movies - ones adults hate to see in theaters because
they know the same films will infest their VCRs like parasites after
release on videocasette - to complete crowd-pleasers. In addition to the
easily-gotten under-12 demographic, Disney has nailed the
too-cool-to-care date crowd, the Gen-Xers, and the middle-aged chaperone
folks. They've done this through clever writing and a well-manicured
storytelling style, all of which is very present in MULAN. From the
opening scene, a rather dark and ominous one showing the Huns invading
China, to the pastel-colored plates of lowland Asia, this movie is
crafted very nicely. The animation quality here, although not
outstandingly different from Disney's last feature, Hercules, is the
up-to-snuff look we've come to expect from the original animators. </P>
<P>Early on it was made clear that even though MULAN sported a female in
the lead role, this would be no SNOW WHITE. And indeed it's not, as the
main woman here - the 18-year-old Mulan (voiced by Ming-Na Wen) - cuts
her hair, puts on some battle armor, and enlists into the Imperial Army
as a boy to save her ailing father from having to serve. She does this,
of course, against every societal convention in place at the time, but
she oes it quite well - managing to become a national hero after all but
saving China from the evil-doing Huns. Along for the ride is a tiny
dragon sent by Mulan's ancestors. Named Mushu and voiced by Eddie
Murphy, he's the movie's main comic relief source, and for the most part
he does it well. Murphy's also one of the only familiar names in the
cast (apart from Harvey Fierstein, who voices a stout soilder but also
played the quivering news chief in INDEPENDENCE DAY). </P>
<P>The lack of familiar names was spun as good for the movie, but it may
cost the movie some box office dollars in comparison to PRINCE OF EGYPT,
the later-this-year animated film from DreamWorks. That film sports the
largest collection of big names since THE LION KING, and one of the most
enjoyable aspects of that movie was hearing A-list actors do what they
could with just their voices. Normally something Disney would not have
to worry about, they now are - or will be soon - in direct competition
with other studios' animated features. Up to this point, they've had the
top call; no one's been able to challenge them. But it won't be long
before the other studios pick up speed, and then Disney will need all
the MULANs they can get.</P>
<P>FINAL AWARD FOR "MULAN": 3.0 stars - a good movie.</P>
