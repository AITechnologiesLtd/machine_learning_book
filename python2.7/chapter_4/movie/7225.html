                       A film review by Marty Mapes
                        Copyright 1997 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>*** (out of 4) After watching SELENA it's hard not to like the "Tejano"
singer.</P>
<P>I went to the movie knowing very little about Selena's music. I even
anticipated that I might not like it very well, because there are types
of Tex-Mex music that I can't stand (e.g., norteno music, the Mexican
version of polka). I was relieved that Selena didn't do polka, but I
still don't think I'd go buy her albums. Her music just doesn't appeal
to me.</P>
<P>Luckily, the movie doesn't require that you love -- or even like --
Selena's music. The movie focuses enough on the characters and the story
that even non-fans can enjoy it. I did.</P>
<P>Selena was a pop music singer. She rose to fame singing Tex-Mex songs in
Spanish and she was just making progress as a crossover singer --
crossing over to mainstream pop in English --  when she was gunned down
at age 23, ironically, by the president of her fan club.</P>
<P>SELENA tells the story both of Selena (Jennifer Lopez) and of her father
Abraham (Edward James Olmos). The movie opens with Selena's last big
concert in the Houston Astrodome. Her opening number is a medley
starting with "I Will Survive," a bit of heavy-handed irony that could
have been overplayed, but which ends up working rather well.</P>
<P>The movie then flashes back to her father's early stint in music, before
Selena was born. Abraham's doo-wop group is pretty good, but can't get a
gig anywhere because racist Anglos won't hire a group of Mexicans and
Mexicans don't want to listen to doo-wop.</P>
<P>The movie jumps forward several years, to when Selena is just 9. Abraham
discovers that music runs in the Quintanilla family like Mexican blood.
Little Selena proves to have the same love of, and more talent for,
music than he has. Her voice and interest in music inspire him to buy a
vanload of instruments for his whole family. After a rocky start, they
begin to sound pretty good together. They stick together through it all
and move on to the big time.</P>
<P>Though the subject herself isn't that interesting to me, I like the
story and the characters in SELENA.</P>
<P>SELENA is a rags-to-riches story, but it shuns the extremes common to
movies of this sort. Selena was not dirt-poor as a child. Her father was
difficult at times, but he was not portrayed as an inhuman monster. He
pushed the kids to practice, but he didn't crack the whip. He
disapproved of Selena's boyfriend, but he knew when he was overreacting
and was able to apologize. There were obstacles and conflicts, but none
of them were blown out of proportion.</P>
<P>Also, though Selena is murdered in the end, the movie manages to be a
triumphal story and not a tragedy. Her death is tragic, but the tone of
the movie is gracious and joyful, not bitter and sad. Come to think of
it, that's probably the better way to be remembered. It is more
generous, more healthful, to celebrate a person's life than to brood
over their death.</P>
<P>The characters in SELENA are well developed and likeable. Abraham, as I
mentioned, is not presented as an ogre. He is stern, but he loves his
kids as most fathers do, and his family always comes first.</P>
<P>Jon Seda plays Chris, Selena's boyfriend, guitarist, and husband with
quiet, shy, downcast eyes in spite of his heavy metal tendencies. When
the time comes for him to say "I love you," it's not just because the
script calls for it; it's because Chris and Selena have become best
friends.</P>
<P>Lopez shines as Selena who is always cheerful and seems to have a true
love for life. When a boy climbs on stage and starts dancing with her,
she stops the security guard from removing him. Soon she is dancing with
a stageful of smiling children. When she sticks up for Chris, it is not
an act of defiance to her father, it is truly defense of her best
friend.</P>
<P>The movie has its shortcomings. Nava and editor Nancy Richardson
introduced a motif of the moon that doesn't play well. A split-screen
effect is used occasionally that doesn't play well and is distracting.
Worst of all, the ending is some sort of jump to reality; real-life
mourners are intercut with footage of the real-life Selena. This
sequence brought to mind the coda of SCHINDLER'S LIST and the comparison
left a bad taste in my mouth.</P>
<P>Still, the movie is worth seeing, even if you don't like the music. It's
a shame that the movie came out only two years after Selena's death
because it seems like the movie is carefully targeted at just her fans
and mourners. I wonder if a greater distance might have made her story
more universal and given this fine movie a broader audience.</P>
