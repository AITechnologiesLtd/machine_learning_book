<PRE>                             EDWARD SCISSORHANDS
                       A film review by Malcolm Austin
                        Copyright 1990 Malcolm Austin</PRE>
<P>     I saw EDWARD SCISSORHANDS last night at the Ziegfield theatre is
NYC.  (A *great* movie theatre in terms of picture and sound quality.)
Here are some quick impressions, if you are deciding whether or not to
see it.</P>
<P>     ES is directed by Tim Burton, whose credits include BATMAN,
BEETLEJUICE, and PEE-WEE HERMAN'S BIG ADVENTURE.  The film is great
visually, and Danny Elfman has contributed a good, not-just-Batman-
reedited score.  The plot is quite weak.  Winona Ryder looks about as
bad as she possibly can (which isn't very) in a blonde wig.</P>
<P>     The bad news is that the story is kind of limp.  But the film looks
great.  This is more than the costumes and sets--it is also how the
scenes are put together, how the characters behave, and where the camera
is and how it moves.</P>
<P>     A truly fine movie needs several strong elements--the script,
direction, and acting must *all* be good, and the producers need to have
sufficient resources in money and technical types to create the sort of
film they want to make.  It doesn't have to be a lot of money, depending
on what they want to do, and how clever their people are.</P>
<P>     EDWARD SCISSORHANDS is not a truly fine movie.  The only thing that
works really well here is the visuals.  The acting is professional but
nothing more, the story fails to convince even in its own "fantasy"
genre, and there is very little originality in what the plot contains,
or how it unfolds.</P>
<P>     If you only see one film this year, don't pick this one.  But a
film does not have to be truly fine in order to be worth seeing.  If you
enjoyed THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN, you will almost certainly
like this movie.  Warning for parents though, it contains somewhat more
violence than MUNCHAUSEN.</P>
<P>     It is easy to compare Tim Burton to Terry Gilliam (JABBERWOCKY,
TIME BANDITS, BRAZIL, MUNCHAUSEN).  Their films have similar strengths.
Burton is somewhat more childlike and carefree in his imagination, and
Gilliam is significantly better at moving the plot along.  Maybe he just
has a better editor.</P>
<P>     Among Burton's other films, I would say that EDWARD SCISSORHANDS
is better than BATMAN, if you take away Nicholson's performance, and not
as good as BEETLEJUICE.</P>
<P>     Sorry for the rambling nature of this review, but I am pressed for
time, and am trying hard to avoid spoilers.  To sum up, I enjoyed it
purely for the look of the movie.  It has little else to recommend it,
but what more do you need?<HR>Malcolm Austin -- <A HREF="mailto:maus@fid.morgan.com">maus@fid.morgan.com</A> </P>
