<PRE>                                 Summer Capsules
                       A film review by Michael John Legeros
                        Copyright 1994 Michael John Legeros</PRE>
<PRE>SUMMER MOVIE CAPSULES - PART DEUX</PRE>
<PRE>WHERE THE RIVERS FLOW NORTH
===========================</PRE>
<P>     Mildly engaging indy drama about a crusty Vermont logger (Rip
Torn) who won't surrender (i.e., sell) to developers who are planning a
dam that'll flood his leased land.  Beautifully photographed by Paul
Ryan and underdirected by Jay Craven, film is notable for an absence of
*any* ecological stand and for the one-two punch of leading pair Rip
Torn and Tantoo Cardinal (as his mate).  Forget the
what-passes-for-chemistry between Bridget Fonda and Nicholas Cage in IT
COULD HAPPEN TO YOU, here's a summer-screen couple that *sizzles*.
Oscar may notice.</P>
<P>>From the novel by Howard Frank Mosher.</P>
<PRE>Grade: B-</PRE>
<PRE>THE LITTLE RASCALS
==================</PRE>
<P>     Terminally inoffensive update of the classic Hal Roach
shorts--from unlikely choice Penelope Spheeris (WAYNE'S WORLD, THE
     BEVERLY HILLBILLIES)--that stars a cast of unknowns as "Our
Gang."  The kids can barely act, the editing is a mess, and the plot
has more holes than 60-year-old film stock.  That said, the whole thing
has a breezy, infectious charm that (almost) overpowers the technical
demerits.</P>
<P>     Kids should love it, though adults may groan at gags that are
older than they are.  A half-dozen well-placed celebrity cameos help,
as does the blooper reel over the end credits.</P>
<PRE>Grade: C+  (just otay)</PRE>
<PRE>BARCELONA
=========</PRE>
<P>     Tart, well-written comedy from Will Stillman (METROPOLITAN) about
two American cousins (Taylor Nichols and Chris Eigeman) living in said
Spanish city in "the last decade of the cold war."  The former is a
salesman, the latter is a Naval officer and, together, they spend most
of the film trying to avoid anti-American sentiment while wooing the
wild women of Barcelona.  Watch for some great, low-key gags about
shaving, ants, and underwear.</P>
<P>     Not hilarious, but *very* amusing.  Keen political edge, too!</P>
<PRE>Grade: B+</PRE>
<PRE>FRESH
=====</PRE>
<P>     Small but powerful inner-city drama about a 12-year-old Brooklyn
boy (Sean Nelson) who sets-up a scheme to get himself and his sister
away from drugs (he's a courier, she's a junkie) and out of the
projects.  The well-written script--by first-time filmmaker Boaz
Yakin--is the draw here.  The premise may not be entirely believable,
but Yakin's crisp characterizations more than compensate for any
occasional lag in narration.</P>
<P>     Nelson is a find, a tough cookie who'll break your heart by the
end.  Samuel L. Jackson plays the father, a speed chess player who
injects enough life lessons into the game to make FRESH feel like a
companion piece to SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISHER.  Too bad the sound
enginnering is awful.  Don't expect to hear all the dialogue in this
one.</P>
<PRE>     One question:  where's Harvey Keitel?</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: B+</PRE>
