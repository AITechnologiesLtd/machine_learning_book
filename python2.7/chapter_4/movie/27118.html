<P>   Remember when you were a senior in high school applying
to three colleges: one that you really wanted to make and the
other two for backups, two that you dreaded going to?  The
letter arrives in May.  The tension mounts as you open the
tightly sealed envelope.  Your hands shake.  You ask your
brother or sister to read you the contents.  Or maybe you're
not applying to college at this time but you had taken your
road test four days ago and the small envelope arrives from
the motor vehicle department.  Same tension.  In "The Visit,"
the film debut of writer-director Jordan Walker-Pearlman (who
adapted Kosmond Russell's play for the screen), a convict
serving a twenty-five year term in a Los Angeles County
prison receives a letter considerably more important than the
aforementioned from the parole board.  He thought he made
a decent impression, but still...his hands shake.  He asks the
guard to read the note to him.  Will he be a free man in a
couple of days or, now dying of AIDS, will he spend the rest
of his life in his solitary cell?  I've got to tell you: I felt the
same when Alex Waters (Hill Harper) received that letter,
having seen him struggle through the 5-member parole board
hearing, that I felt when I got that envelope from the motor
vehicle bureau at the age of eighteen.  That's how involving
the film had become by then despite its slow start, its obvious
origin as a theatrical piece, and the strangely muffled sound
coming from the theater speakers.</P>
<P>   While the film takes place both in the correctional institution
and in the mind of the frustrated inmate--convicted of a rape
he insists he never committed--the real story deals with the
effects on Alex of family estrangement.  Based on a true
story of playwright Kosmond Russell's relationship with his
brother in an Ohio prison, "The Visit" tells of an angry fellow
whose moralistic father, Henry (Billy Dee Williams) only
reluctantly visits his son after some time because he is feels
that the boy has brought shame upon the family, though
Henry's wife Lois (Marla Gibbs) continues to love him with
qualification.  Alex's successful brother, Tony (Obba
Babatunde), drops into for a chat only after a full year, using
the excuse that the jail is no place for his wife and children to
be.  Tormented by the passive belligerence shown him by his
family, Alex is fortunate in being able to confide in the
understanding and sympathetic psychiatrist, Dr. Coles
(Phylicia Rashad), without whose warmth and guidance Alex
might well have lost all desire to live.</P>
<P>   We never do find out whether Alex is guilty of the rape he
persistently denies, even refraining from showing the parole
board any remorse because, he insists, he never committed
that crime. But this is not relevant since Walker-Pearlman is
interested in penetrating the mind of the prisoner,
demonstrating to us in cinematic imagery some of the
thoughts and feelings going through the poor guy's mind--
both banal and startling.  Walker-Pearlman does a particularly
good job showing the ways that each character in turn breaks
down Alex's wall, with a particularly tender scene involving a
former drug addict and incest victim Felicia McDonald (Rae
Dawn Chong) who visits the prisoner without advance notice
and, at first not recognized for the childhood companion that
he once knew, ultimately provides Alex with a tender fantasy
of the two dancing slowly and lovingly in the lonely cell.  </P>
<P>   Along the way we learn the workings of what is perhaps a
typical parole board hearing, as the five judges question Alex
in turn, trying to find out how the man would cope if on the
outside.  We are allowed to enter the private discussions of
the board, noting the lack of unanimity and the downright
verbal battles that the group engage in while reaching a
decision.</P>
<P>   Best of all is Hill Harper in the central role.  Harper is
known to the mostly young audience who took in "The Skulls"
opposite Joshua Jackson and performed as well in Jonathan
Demme's ghost story "Beloved" as well as Spike Lee's "He
Got Game." Harper conveys Alex's moods with pathos,
epitomizing a man who considers himself unjustly imprisoned,
dying of AIDS, who is more solitary than most in that he
refuses to socialize with his fellow inmates.  If you don't mind
the theatrical nature of the work (as I do not), if you are open
to a leisurely paced psychological drama which enters the
mind of a very unhappy fellow, you might gain the same
satisfactions as I.</P>
