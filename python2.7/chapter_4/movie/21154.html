<PRE> "You've made your big gay bed and now you've got to slumber gayly in
it."</PRE>
<P>Starring Matthew Perry, Neve Campbell, Dylan McDermott, Oliver Platt.
Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>The cast of the ultra-popular tv show Friends have had a curse placed
on them: it seems that none of them can star in a good movie. Picture
Perfect anyone? Ed? Kissing a Fool? Their success rate on the silver
screen has been abominable. But now, with Matthew Perry's Three to
Tango, if the Friends curse isn't broken, it's starting to tear at the
seams. This latest attempt is an entertaining, inoffensive, highly
likeable (though derivative) production, with all the makings of a box-
office and critical success.</P>
<P>After an entertaining titles sequence, we are introduced to Oscar Novak
(Perry) and Peter Steinberg (Oliver Platt), two architects who have
come to the office of Charles Newman, a rich tycoon who is building a
cultural center named after himself. The team of Oscar and Peter seems
homely in comparison to the competition: two limitlessly wealthy suits
who are willing to go to any lengths, monetary and otherwise, to get
this project. After they are told that they have to build a model of
their proposal, which would cost at least 150 thousand dollars, Oscar
and Peter doubt their chances against the moneybags they are pitted
against until a series of unexpected developments changes the rules
entirely.</P>
<P>Through a series of misunderstandings, Newman comes to believe that
Oscar is gay, when in reality it is Peter who "bats for the other
team". Newman is currently cheating on his wife with Amy, a beautiful,
oddly Seinfeld-ish New Yorker (Neve Campbell) and is afraid that a
hunky football player might try to make a pass at his mistress. Because
he thinks Oscar is gay, he orders him to keep tabs on Amy and report
back to him with information on whom she mingles with and how she
mingles with them.</P>
<P>Oscar, of course, is not gay and he starts to like Amy, who really does
seem like a fine gal, unlike many bitchy female figures in these kinds
of movies. She continues to think that he is gay and is kept in the
dark about his romantic affection for her. Of course, Oscar has to keep
pretending he is gay and not show his crush on Amy for fear of losing
the project for himself and his partner in the unfortunate circumstance
that Newman finds out that the man who he sent to spy on his girlfriend
is courting her.</P>
<P>The situation is complicated further when the newspapers decide to do a
story on him, profiling him as a prosperous gay businessman. Now
everyone in the world thinks he is gay, leading to indecent proposals
from strangers of the incorrent gender. The story also lessens his
chances of confessing his love for Amy without publically pronouncing
that he is not gay and risk losing his architectural gig.</P>
<P>Three to Tango elicits memories of a similarly delightful comedy, In
and Out with Kevin Kline. That film had the same basic premise but was
more gay-friendly and was not a romance. Comparisons to In and Out are
inevitable, but in fact, they are two completely different films. Which
is superior is hard to say, but this one is definitely a match for the
1997 critical darling. It's a light-hearted, funny movie that, if
nothing else, produces consistent chuckles and a few laugh-out-loud
moments. Though Three to Tango ultimately fails to emotionally involve
us with its characters, it is fast paced and never tedious; making up
for thematic inadequacies with sharp wit.</P>
<P>Neve Campbell's performance is rather generic, though her character is
a likeable one; fortunately, Perry and Platt more than make up for her
undistinctiveness. Perry still seems to be playing his Chandler
character from Friends, but since I happen to love Chandler, I was glad
to say hi to the old friend on the big screen. Oscar is a tad less
cynical and sarcastic than his veritable counterpart, but for some
reason I still thought "Chandler". That certainly doesn't mean that
Perry isn't funny in the role; quite the contrary, he is a hoot. Platt
fares even better. He's a naturally funny actor, with an uncanny flair
for delivering one-liners, and his talents make Three to Tango even
more enjoyable. His character doesn't go very far, but he sure is a
good source of guffaw-worthy lines like the one above.</P>
<P>The ending of the film is ordinary and unsatisfying, resorting to
painfully obvious cliches in order to squeeze out as happy a conclusion
as humanely possible (it's ironic, too, that the characters actually
make fun of movie cliches while conforming to them). It likewise didn't
hurt the movie a great deal because I was never induced to make a great
personal investment in the characters and thus wasn't too disappointed
when their story wrapped-up in a traditional romantic comedy fashion.
It didn't take away from the fact that the film was zingy and
entertaining; a feather-light delight.</P>
