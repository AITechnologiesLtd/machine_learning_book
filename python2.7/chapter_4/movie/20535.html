<PRE>`Run Lola Run' – Catch Her while You Can
By Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>I don't know about you, but it's been at least a month since I've seen
a memorable movie.  And I've seen a fair number of films these past few
weeks.  None of them have really stuck in my mind; I can't even recall
the film titles.  Sure, there was the sophisticated Thomas Crown Affair
and the eerie Sixth Sense.  But these screen gems were released back in
mid-August.  For the avid moviegoer, there is a drought of good films
much like the water shortage that we've been experiencing recently in
the Washington DC metro area.  </P>
<P>This week's new releases fail to offer much promise.  Although I
haven't seen any of them yet, the feedback for Stigmata, Stir of
Echoes, and Love Stinks has been generally disappointing.  Gee, what
are intelligent moviegoers like us to do.  Well, let me thank my best
bud, Daniel, for bringing a clever foreign film to my attention.  From
Germany, the film is called `Run Lola Run.'  It's certainly the most
quenching alternative to the recent spate of dry Hollywood offerings.</P>
<P>The story features the rebellious looking Lola.  She's a spunky girl
with flame red hair who has to find a way to help Manni, her
small-time, gangster boyfriend.  Manni has somehow lost a bag of dirty
money that was entrusted to him.  If he can not make the delivery in 20
minutes, he will meet a horrible fate.  Lola begins a mad sprint across
town in a desperate attempt to collect the amount that he lost.  The
storyline is fairly simple.  And that's good, since the movie is in
German with English subtitles.  But the film is more than the frantic
marathon that Lola undertakes.  The filmmaker also introduces a
dimension of ‘what if' and how her actions influence not only her
destiny but others as well.  What if Lola took a little longer to
complete her run?  What if Lola made a left instead of a right?  What
if Lola talked to this person and instead of that person?  Several
scenarios are played out and we can only hope that through some miracle
and random luck that Lola and Manni will live happily ever after.</P>
<P>While the presentation of multiple timelines is not something new
(remember Sliding Doors or even the Back to the Future series), the
presentation was very clever and original.  The first one-third of the
film is a high-octane tour de force that melds high-energy performances
with MTV-chic cinematography.  The feel is undeniably kinetic. 
Strobing images, wild camerawork, and a heavy Euro synth-pop soundtrack
all lend to its youthful appeal.  Meanwhile the dialogue is thoughtful
so that this doesn't become a victim of style over substance.  My only
negative remark is that 90% of the `wow' factor occurs within the first
third of the film.  When you enter the final scenario (there are three
of them), some of the luster begins to quickly wear thin.  Alas, not
even Lola can run that fast forever.  As a foreign film, `Lola' will be
hard to find.  But catch her if you can.</P>
