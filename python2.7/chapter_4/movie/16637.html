<PRE>FRANKENSTEIN (1931)</PRE>
<P>"Frankenstein was interested only in human life: first to destroy it, 
then recreate it."</P>
<PRE>3.5 out of ****</PRE>
<P>Starring Boris Karloff, Colin Clive, Mae Clarke, John Boles, Edward 
Van Sloan;
Directed by James Whale;
Written by John L. Balderston, Francis Edward Faragoh, and Garett 
Fort, from a play by Peggy Webling;
Cinematography by Arthur Edeson</P>
<P>If parody is a form of tribute, then James Whale's FRANKENSTEIN is 
surely one of the most honoured films of all time.  Few movies, if 
any, have been aped and imitated so often and so pervasively.  Boris 
Karloff's braying, lurching monster.  The hunched, atavistic lab 
assistant.  Dr. Frankenstein in his white labcoat, scuttling around 
his lab, dwarfed by the vast walls and the mad scientist decor.  They 
have become icons of our culture, and it is a measure of how good 
FRANKENSTEIN is that it emerges, indefatigable, from this smothering 
pile of cultural baggage, retaining still some measure of the power it 
must once have had.</P>
<P>All popular works suffer from inevitable datedness, because the 
conventions they manipulate to provoke sensation are as ephemeral as 
the box-office success they strive for; but FRANKENSTEIN, if not 
exactly contemporary in feel, is at least well-preserved: watching it 
is not simply an exercise in camp nostalgia.  It has more to offer.</P>
<P>For one thing, at only seventy minutes, it seems a model of clarity 
and purpose compared to the flaccid torpor of today's blockbusters.  
Whale finds a fine balance, embellishing outlandish scenes with 
extravagant stylistic flourishes, but proceeding through the straight 
scenes with ruthless economy.  Compared to the melodramatic excesses 
customary of popular films, the key moments are charged--rather 
impressively--with a stark simplicity of emotion and imagery.  The 
monster choking a man to death, a little girl innocently offering him 
a flower, a windmill burned by a frenzied mob: the images are concise, 
bare, direct, and remain vivid in the mind's eye.</P>
<P>There is also, at times, a surprising degree of dramatic 
understatement.  The ultimate meeting of maker and monster, at the 
edge of a cliff after an urgent mob/chase scene, is expressed in a 
couple of quick close-ups.  We see the monster's face and 
Frankenstein's face, and there are no words.  We know all we need to 
know.  (In the novel, the equivalent of this scene is the starting 
point for much speechifying.)  Earlier, when the monster is birthed, 
we don't see (as I anticipated) a head-on shot of Boris Karloff 
sitting bolt upright, eyes wide and wild.  Instead, we see him in 
flashes: a hand twitching, a glimpse of the head behind the gloating 
figure of Dr. Frankenstein (Colin Clive).  He comes to life in 
pieces--which is somehow rather appropriate.</P>
<P>Boris Karloff's performance has long since become legend, so much so 
that it is easy to forget that it is just that: a performance, and a 
savvy one.  The role, of course, did not require much dramatic range, 
but it required something beyond the haunted gaunt pallor of the 
make-up.  The shambling wooden gait is obviously intended to suggest 
the unnatural quality of his existence.  But Karloff adds something 
more: even though he himself is not freakishly large, it seems as if 
he is, for he dominates the screen.  He achieves this by seeming to 
place his entire weight on each foot as he walks, giving the sense of 
ponderous body mass, of largeness.  It's remarkable how dramatically 
effective this simple trick is.  And in the fight scenes, the brute 
unchoreographed simplicity of the monster's violence powerfully 
suggests his animal innocence.</P>
<P>Although the script--itself taken from a theatrical adaptation--plays 
fast and loose with the original novel, it retains crucial thematic 
elements, one of which is the concept of the monster's innocence.  He 
is abused, persecuted, vilified, yet he wilfully initiates no 
wrongdoing; he simply responds, in his bewilderment, to the 
provocation around him.  The movie cheats somewhat by having the 
monster's brain come from a criminal (stored in a jar helpfully 
labelled "ABNORMAL BRAIN"), but the way it develops, this becomes 
irrelevant.  When he tosses a girl into a lake, it is not the 
malicious act of a criminal--no criminal's gaping grin could seem so 
silly--but rather the amoral act of an infant who has not yet learned 
how to interpret the world and respond in socially appropriate ways.  
The creator is, in a way, as sociopathic as his creation, and Dr. 
Frankenstein's sin lies not so much in having made this unnatural 
being, but rather in abandoning it to its fate.  His crime is not 
hubris, but lack of moral responsibility.</P>
<P>The story plays out in a series of improbably spacious rooms, a 
panoply of ornate TARDIS chambers, bigger inside than out.  The narrow 
dark spire of Frankenstein's retreat opens up to reveal vast shadowy 
spaces; the rooms of the Frankenstein household, even the hallway, are 
palatial in their dimensions.  But there are no ceilings.  Long-shots 
show us extensive horizontal space but never tilt up to show us what 
is overhead, creating the sense of an oppressively low ceiling always 
just out of sight.  It's a strange sensation, this almost subliminal 
distortion of spatial perception, and--while it is doubtless a mere 
accident of the mechanics of production--it is odd, unsettling, and 
the perfect ambience for a tale of terror.</P>
<P>There is one ceiling in the film, and that is in the 
laboratory--which is a marvel of set design, a comic-book array of 
Gothic exaggeration and primitive sci-fi apparatus--where the sheer 
walls frown forebodingly down on the banks and coils of machinery: 
this is a space that seems more vertical than horizontal.  When the 
instant of creation arrives, the monster's incumbent form--in an 
inspired moment--is hoisted off the floor on a gurney and winched up 
to an aperture in the ceiling, where it bathes in the lightning-glare 
of the storm, in the sturm and drang of the sky.  Watching from below 
as flares of illumination flicker about the immobilized body, it truly 
seems as if we behold something greater than us, beyond our ken, 
unknowable: the act of creation is irradiated by mystery, as it should 
be.  The film entire may not be perfect, but in splendid set-pieces 
such as this, it is lit from within by the eternal fire of myth, and 
makes its flame burn brighter.</P>
