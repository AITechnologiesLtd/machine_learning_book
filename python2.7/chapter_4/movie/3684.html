<PRE>                                   MAD LOVE
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     The big shocker in MAD LOVE is not that it is so bad (which it is)
but that it was directed by the same Antonia Bird who made the
wonderful film PRIEST.  How a talented director could sink so rapidly
from one film to the next is difficult to comprehend.  From the taut
PRIEST to this nonsense is quite a leap.</P>
<P>     Ever since I saw Chris O'Donnell in SCENT OF A WOMAN, I knew he
was destined to greater roles.  In MAD LOVE, it is not his acting that
is at fault, it is the ridiculous story.</P>
<P>     Matt (O'Donnell) is a bright high school senior who falls madly in
love with a cookie young woman, Casey (Drew Barrymore).  He is so madly
in love with her that he gives up his intention of going to college and
instead takes off with her for parts unknown.</P>
<P>     When Casey steals a car and they ride off together he begins to
have  some small thoughts that she may not be right in the head.  But
other things should have warned him much earlier;  he would have to
have been an idiot not to have noticed.  However it is not until almost
the film's end that her parents tell him she needs psychiatric help and
asylum confinement until she cane be "cured."</P>
<PRE>     Too little, too late.</PRE>
