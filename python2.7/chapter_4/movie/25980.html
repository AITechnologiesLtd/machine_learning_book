Review: Whipped (1999)<HR></PRE>
<PRE>[2.5/4.0]</PRE>
<P>The topic of romance and dating in American society is easily
relatable since most young people devote a large amount of energy to
dealing with it. Although they both eventually aim towards the common
target of marriage, men and women may have different approaches to and
attitudes towards dating. Men can be dishonest in their pursuit of
women simply to initiate a relationship in which sex plays an
important role. This film is about a group of male scammers, men who
will do or say anything in order to enter a sexual relationship with a
woman, and a woman who infiltrates and disrupts the group.</P>
<P>Four young men meet regularly on Sundays to discuss their dating
exploits of the past weekend. Brad (Brian Van Holt) is a Wall Street
type with athletic good looks. Zeke (Zorie Barber) is an unemployed
writer with a huge ego. Jonathan (Jonathan Abrahams) is less overtly
macho, and usually has fewer victory stories. The final individual,
Eric (Judah Domke), used to be a core member of the group, but he is
now somewhat viewed as an outsider since getting married.</P>
<P>The group's normal existence is perturbed when Brad, Zeke, and
Jonathan start dating a woman that they develop serious feelings for.
It becomes chaotic when they find they are all dating the same woman,
Mia (Amanda Peet). Mia's refusal to choose just one of the three,
along with the guys' refusal to give her up undermines their
friendship. Eric also becomes involved because the relationships with
Mia threaten to disband the men's club that is his only respite from
the drudgery of his married life.</P>
<P>The story is basically a comedy, with primarily dialog based humor and
witty observations of the almost military tactics that are involved in
the dating process. Not all of the gags work, many of them are simply
gross or pathetic, but others are creative and insightful. The frank
portrayal of jesting character attacks between male friends is
accurate and entertaining. It does attempt to present a thoughtful
premise as the framework for the plot, namely that men would be
miserable if their own tactics were used against them. However, any
philosophical issues are only explored in a cursory manner, since they
are used simply as a skeleton on which to build the plot rather than
as a source of creativity. The intent of the film is mainly to be
entertaining, and it succeeds in getting laughs from the audience. It
would have been a better film if it had explored the dramatic angle
that it pretended it had.</P>
<P>It is often difficult to construct a comedy primarily around dialog,
but writer and director Peter M. Cohen is successful in keeping the
comedy flowing. Although some of the developments appear contrived and
many of the transitions are forced, the humor creates a momentum that
propels the plot through its rough points. It is important to note
that the raunchy humor could be offensive to viewers who are not
comfortable with frank, and often crude, discussions of sexuality. The
original cut of the film garnered an NC-17 rating, which was reduced
to R after some of the dialog was toned down.</P>
<P>Although the marketing for the film indicates that it is a vehicle for
Amanda Peet, the role of Mia is actually less important, and less
interesting, than any of the four primary men. Peet is successful in
the role, but the character is limited in scope. All the four primary
male characters are well portrayed, although they occasionally become
exaggerated.</P>
<P>Recommended. The film does not set lofty goals, but it is successful
in generating laughs. The humor is primarily based around sexuality
and is definitely coarse, so it may not entertain a general audience.
Although little sexual content is displayed, the discussions about it
are explicit. The film is targeted towards a younger audience which is
as obsessed with the opposite sex as the film's characters.</P>
