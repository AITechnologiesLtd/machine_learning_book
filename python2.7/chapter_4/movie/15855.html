<PRE>Review:        Dancing at Lughnasa</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:        Meryl Streep as Kate, Kathy Burke as Maggie, Brid
                Brennan as Agnes Sophie Thompson as Rose, Catherine
                McCormack as Christina, Darrell Johnston as Michael,
                Rhys Ifans as Gerry Evans, Michael Gambon as Jack Mundy</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by:        Pat O'Connor</PRE>
<PRE>Review by:        Joy Wyse, The SILVER Screen critic</PRE>
<P>        This is definitely an ensemble film.  Because of it, Meryl Streep is
miscast.  Her fame calls for her character to be bigger and stronger than
the others, but it's not and it shouldn't be.</P>
<P>This is a lovely story of the Mundy family, a group of sisters and their
brother, as told through the eyes of the boy, Michael.</P>
<P>The sisters live simple lives with average jobs such as teaching and
factory work.  They live together in their parental home.  None of them
are married although Michael is the result of an affair by Christina. 
Rose is attracted to a married man.</P>
<P>Their brother Jack, a Catholic priest, has come back home from Africa as
a missionary after suffering a breakdown.   Shortly thereafter the boy's
father, Gerry Evans, comes back into their lives.</P>
<P>The movie is based on the Broadway play.  Although it garnered many 
Tony nominations, I doubt that it will attract any Academy Award votes.  
It's a nice story told in a delightful way.  There is nothing
objectionable portrayed although some people may take offense at the
actions of some of the characters.</P>
<P>Lughnasa is not a location, but rather a festival to Lugh, the harvest
deity, the God of Music and Light.  Knowing this helps explain some of the
actions.</P>
<P>Because the movie is fairly slow moving with little plot, I give it a C.</P>
