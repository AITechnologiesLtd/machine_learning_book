<PRE>                                 CITIZEN RUTH
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1997 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     It's been a while since I've anticipated a film this greatly and
been let down so much by the actual product.  Filmed from Alexander
Payne and Jim Taylor's extremely entertaining script, CITIZEN RUTH had a
lot to live up to.  Of course, in some ways, it does, and in some, it
doesn't.  Geez, you'd think I would be used to disappointment by now!</P>
<P>     CITIZEN RUTH is the story of Ruth Stoops (Laura Dern), a "huffer"
(paint/glue/other hazardous vapor sniffer) who finds herself the
unlikely center of a modern morality play.  Ruth, pregnant for the fifth
time and up on drug charges once again, is given a choice by an
unsympathetic judge:  go to jail for criminally endangering her fetus,
or have an abortion and face a lighter sentence.  Immediately, ires are
raised and banners are crafted from both sides of the abortion issue --
with Ruth Stoops, the lowest of the low, right in the middle.</P>
<P>     What follows is a rather simple tale of pro-choice vs. pro-life,
and there's no clear good guy in all of this.  But instead of focusing
on the issue, the filmmakers choose to focus on the characters -- and
they're all pretty loathsome when you get down to brass tacks.  Worst of
all is Dern, who is so gratingly offensive that by the end of the movie
you really just want her to shut up more than anything else.</P>
<P>     Some of the supporting characters are amusing, but it gets to the
point where you just can't take any more Southern small-town kitsch and
an overwhelming desire to leave this no-win debate overtakes you.  But
something keeps you in your seat -- and it isn't just the gum on the
floor.  I guess it's the humor that the filmmakers have instilled into
this not-too-funny situation and the earnestness with which they try to
tell this story.</P>
<PRE>     All in all, a nice try at a tough topic.</PRE>
