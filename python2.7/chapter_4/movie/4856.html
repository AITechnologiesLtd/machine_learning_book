<P>     Aircraft silhouetted against an afternoon sky.  The music on 
the soundtrack surges; the actors grow into terse, tense expressions.  
A dangerous mid-air transfer is about to happen onto an endangered 
747.  Could it be Charleton Heston, about to be lowered into a 
cockpit to rescue Karen Black?  No!  It's never-aging Kurt Russell 
and a team of commandos raiding a hostage-held jetliner that's 
armed with nerve gas for use on a suicide mission.  Wohoo!  The 
disaster film lives!  </P>
<P>     Twenty-one years since AIRPORT '75 and the formula still works 
wonders, though with a few necessary changes:  instead of a mid-air 
collision causing problems, it's Middle-Eastern terrorists; instead 
of Gloria Swanson on board, the biggest name on the passenger list 
is Marla Maples Trump.  (She has a cameo as a stewardess.)  The 
expected emergency landing stays, but they've added an entire DIE 
HARD subplot that has Russell and his crack commandos methodically 
plotting a takeover.   All that's missing is George Kennedy's 
cigar!</P>
<P>     EXECUTIVE DECISION is shameless fun from producer Joel Silver 
and editor-turned-director Stuart Baird.  The Jim and John Thompson 
(PREDATOR, PREDATOR 2) script steals from everywhere-- AIRPORT, 
FAIL SAFE, SPEED-- and, once it gets airborne, the darn thing works 
wonders.  The attention to casting detail is particularly good:  
J.T. Walsh as a worried Senator on board, Steven Seagal as the 
squinty commando leader, Halle Berry as the stalwart stewardess.  
And the list of good players goes on:  Joe Morton, Oliver Platt, 
John Leguizamo.  No particular character is written *that* well, 
but they gel into one of the better action ensembles that we've 
seen in some time.  Recommended.  </P>
