<P>   My apartment overlooks the Brooklyn Bridge on the wrong
side of Manhattan so I'm accustomed to surprises...police
barricades when suicide jumps are threatened, traffic jams
that would stagger the imagination of even New Yorkers,
marches by people on all sides of the political spectrum.  But
nothing quite prepared me for the shock of discovering U.S.
troops marching across the link between the two boroughs,
with tanks rolling in from the area in which Adams Street
meets High Street just to the east of the overpass.  Has it
finally happened?  Are we experiencing the first coup d'etat in
U.S. history?  "Just a movie," my more collected neighbor
assured me, "Just a movie."</P>
<P>   And what a movie! Plenty of action, briskly paced, with lots
of firepower, a couple of car chases, exploding buildings,
choppers, and of course the ultimate battle--not between the
U.S. and its external enemies but between rival U.S.
agencies.  Denzel Washington, the great crowd-pleaser who
will likely make "The Siege" number one in the first
weekend's box office, is easily the big reason to see the
movie.  He gets to stand up for the Bill of Rights, a good deal
of the rest of the U.S. Constitution, and for the rights of
Brooklynites of Red Hook, Borough Hall, and Cobble Hill to
walk the streets at midnight if they so desire without being
confronted by half the tanks in the army's stockpile.  </P>
<P>   Plot-wise, however, "The Siege" is messy.  Edward Zwick
directs the picture from a screenplay written by a committee
of three without much thought of a center.  New York City
appears to be under a siege in a series of terrorist attacks
not experienced since the Oklahoma City bombing.  It
becomes clear from the beginning that the trouble is being
caused by Arab extremist groups, just twenty criminals in all,
who make no demands but who are intent on blowing up
themselves and as many others as they can get for the
benefit of the TV cameras.  In one case they release a group
of young kids from a bus before blasting it simply because
FBI Agent Anthony "Hub" Hubbard asks them to do so.  In
yet another situation a suicide bomber crashes his van into a
federal building in downtown Manhattan killing six hundred
people.  Though Hub pulls off some daring arrests and
manages to destroy some of our nation's enemies before
than can do further damage, the president believes things
have gotten entirely out of hand and declares martial law in
New York City, authorizing General William Devereaux (Bruce
Willis) to send tanks into the streets of Brooklyn, to enforce a
curfew, and to round up scores of suspects for placement in
a camp similar to those used by the U.S. government against
Japanese-Americans in the early forties.  Masses of people,
infuriated by the abridgment of constitutional liberties, take to
the streets.  In a that seems inspired by consultants from the
American Civil Liberties Union, the army and particularly its
commander, Devereaux, become the bad guys while the FBI
and to a lesser extent the CIA come up smelling of roses.</P>
<P>   The one problematic character in the whole piece is Sharon
Bridger, aka Elise Kraft (Annette Bening), an attractive, forty-
something CIA agent who gains information largely by
sleeping with the enemy.  I'd challenge the experts from
Columbia University's department of Middle East studies to
figure out just where she stands on the politics of the
situation.  Surely the typical member of the movie's audience
will draw a blank trying to calculate a pattern.  At times she
even seems as though she is siding with our adversaries. 
Sure, she explains the usual predicament of U.S. foreign
policy, which is that this country often sides with the wrong
guys.  (We sided with the mujahadeen against the Russian
interlopers in Afghanistan. Now we condemn the Afghan
Taliban movement while we throw money at the Russians. 
We even once helped Saddam Hussein during his struggle
with the Iranians!) But just what information has she obtained
from her nighttime encounters with these terrorists?   And
why is blowing hot and cold, so to speak, with Special Agent
Hubbard?</P>
<P>   Tony Shalhoub turns in a good performance as a
Lebanese-American who works with the FBI but who
threatens to turn in his badge when his son is arrested and
incarcerated as a potential terrorist.  Annette Bening looks
charming throughout, if as confused as the audience.  And
Bruce Willis's role is underwritten and predictable.  See the
movie for Denzel, though, and watch the fireworks
throughout.  But don't expect to cheer when the U.S. Army
gets its comeuppance from the FBI.  Nothing in this
convoluted plot makes us exercise our propensity for movie-
theater self-righteousness.</P>
