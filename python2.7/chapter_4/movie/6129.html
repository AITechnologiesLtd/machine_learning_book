<P>     BOUND appears to be ripe with all the elements necessary for a top-
notch exploitation flick:  leather, guns, gangsters, blood, and a couple 
of hot-to-trot lesbians.  From the first scene, however, it's obvious 
that the writing/directing team of Andy and Larry Wachowski are aiming 
for something considerably higher than rudimentary titillation.  And, by 
taking chances and twisting conventions, they have hit paydirt.  BOUND 
is among the best film noir entries of the decade; from beginning to 
end, it's solidly entertaining.</P>
<P>     Ceasar (Joe Pantoliano) is a money launderer for the mob (sometimes 
in a very literal fashion -- watch how he cleans up a sack of bloody 
bills).  His live-in girlfriend, Violet (Jennifer Tilly), a closet 
lesbian, is itching to get free of him ("I want out!  I want a new 
life!").  She sees her chance when an ex-con named Corky (Gina Gershon) 
moves in next door.  Methodically, Violet seduces Corky, then, after a 
heated sexual encounter, the two plot how to liberate Violet along with 
$2 million of the mob's money that's currently in Ceasar's possession.</P>
<P>     Saying more than that about BOUND would be unfair, because the plot 
is loaded with the unexpected.  For most thrillers, I'm able to predict 
the so-called "surprises" far in advance, but this film's well-
orchestrated twists kept me off balance.  Until the final scenes, it's 
impossible to be sure of anyone or anything.  The biggest question, 
which is raised by the characters and stays with us, is who can be 
trusted?  We're never sure who's on the level and who's lying.  Since 
the Wachowskis don't feel bound by the conventions of the genre, they 
freely violate our expectations.  Best of all, everything that 
transpires in BOUND makes perfect sense -- the film doesn't demand 
unreasonable leaps of logic to tie everything together.  In that way, 
it's like BLOOD SIMPLE and THE LAST SEDUCTION.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the most intriguing departure from the norm is the use of a 
pair of lesbians as the main characters.  Ultimately, it's a great 
choice, both from a plotting and an aesthetic standpoint.  Jennifer 
Tilly and Gina Gershon steam up the screen with the kind of eroticism 
that is rarely found in same-sex or opposite-sex couplings.  From the 
closeups of Gershon's hands and Tilly's legs to the love scene (which is 
played with an undercurrent of humor), the Wachowskis understand exactly 
how to photograph these two to their best effect, using shadows and 
unusual camera angles to intensify the sensuality.  </P>
<P>     Tilly doesn't have great range, but she can do this kind of role in 
her sleep.  With her high-pitched, breathy voice and low-cut necklines, 
she's perfect as Violet, BOUND's femme fatale.  Unlike her Oscar-
nominated part in BULLETS OVER BROADWAY, this gangster's moll isn't a 
ditz.  In fact, she's quite intelligent, and that makes her a force to 
be reckoned with.  Meanwhile, Gina Gershon does an about face from her 
glamorous turn in SHOWGIRLS, essaying the tough, James Dean-like Corky, 
a professional thief who's interested in cleaning her life up until she 
falls for Violet and the $2 million.  Gershon, who gave one of the 
better performances in Paul Verhoeven's trashy T&amp;A-fest, is excellent 
here, capturing our sympathy from the first reel.  And Corky, like 
Violet, is smart.  </P>
<P>     The intended victim of Violet and Corky's plan, Ceasar, isn't dumb, 
either, and his refusal to act predictably fuels several scenes that are 
thick with tension.  Actor Joe Pantoliano (THE FUGITIVE) plays Ceasar as 
a normally-cool man driven over the edge when he loses control of 
circumstances.  But, despite his growing panic, Ceasar still tries to 
think things through, and this makes him a dangerous adversary.  Watch 
for how he uses the re-dial button on a phone.</P>
<P>     From a stylistic perspective, this is a beautiful film -- a color 
motion picture with black-and-white sensibilities (as is often true of 
the best modern film noir). Shadows and light are used to good effect.  
The Wachowskis, along with cinematographer Bill Pope, have crafted a 
number of artistically superior shots.  In one instance, we see a 
droplet of crimson fall into the clear water of a toilet, then slowly 
diffuse.  In another, we see hundreds of $100 bills hanging by pins from 
a makeshift clothesline.  Then there's a scene where blood spatters a 
small pool of fresh white paint.  </P>
<P>     From the opening moments, ripe with sexual tension, to the closing 
shot, BOUND offers an edge-of-the-seat experience.  No noir thriller 
since last year's THE USUAL SUSPECTS has captured my attention this 
fully.  (Curiously, both SUSPECTS and BOUND were released by the same 
distributor, Gramercy Pictures.) If this film was less adeptly-made, it 
might go down as a "guilty pleasure", but, considering the amount of 
skill and intelligence invested in the production, there's nothing 
remotely shameful about this particular indulgence.</P>
