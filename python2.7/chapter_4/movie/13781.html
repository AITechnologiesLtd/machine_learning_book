<PRE>ZERO EFFECT (1998)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Writer/Director: Jake Kasdan
Starring: Bill Pullman, Ben Stiller, Kim Dickens, Ryan O'Neal, Angela
Featherstone</P>
<P>Daryl Zero lives on the secluded top floor of a high-rise hotel, sealed
behind metallic doors with six separate locks, surveillance in every room,
a station of several computers so that he can work efficiently, and a
refrigerator full of Tab sodas, which I thought went out of business but I
guess I was wrong.  He's unlike most detectives in many ways, but the chief
difference between him and anyone else is that he never communicates with
his clients: he was a kind of lawyer helping him out who goes to see
potential clients, and gives them updates while Daryl uses disguises and
aliases to dig deep and find out the answer to whatever job he's hired for.
 He's a master of illusion, he's the best detective in the world, and he's
a total freak.</P>
<P>The weird thing about "Zero Effect" is that it's not really the quirky
thriller nor the plug for a TV detective like it may seem to be at first. 
It creeps up on you where you least expect it, and in the last movie you'd
think to have a heart, you find one.  Before you know it, you're feeling
something for all the characters, and you're more involved in their lives
than you are the mystery that this film poses.</P>
<P>The story revolves around one case of Daryl's, played wonderfully by Bill
Pullman (whose talent seems to decrease as the budget of a film starring
him increases), where he has to find a set of keys to a safe deposit box
for a millionaire named Gregory Stark (Ryan O'Neal, trying to find work),
and subsequently find out who's been blackmailing him for large amounts of
money.  Daryl never meets him, but he begins to sneakily find out things by
posing as other people, namely a millionaire accountant in town for the
weekend and working out at the same health club Gregory does.  There's a
fascinating set of scenes where he confronts him as an anonymous person,
and then goes back to show how he got amazing amounts of information just
by mincing a couple words with him.</P>
<P>The running joke in the movie is that Daryl is incredibly observant about
physical and psychological things, but that he comes up snake eyes when
actually dealing with the emotions of other people he deals with.  His
long-time partner/lawyer, Steve Arlo (Ben Stiller, showing that he's one of
the best comic actors around), detests everything about him, and is
desperately trying to find a way to break it to him that he doesn't want to
work for him anymore so he can marry his girlfriend (Angela Featherstone). 
And he seems to never really notice that he's annoying and rude and selfish
to everyone around him when he tries to do his bizarro detective work,
which makes him completely antisocial.</P>
<P>Instead of the film going on like this, mocking everything that makes up
Daryl, and giving us a mystery we are never really blown away by anyway, it
gives us something better: a love story, in the weirdest movie.  It does
this by introducing another character, a woman named Gloria (Kim Dickens)
whom he meets at the health club one day and is automatically able to
figure out that she's a paramedic since she smells of it.  Although turned
off at first, she begins to be fascinated with him, and soon the two are
discovering more and more about eachother, all the while at least one of
them is lying.</P>
<P>"Zero Effect" was written and directed by Jake Kasdan, the son of famous
directory Lawrence Kasdan, and he gives the film a comic yet dramatic feel.
 There's a real story here about characters that are interesting and
likable, and he allows that to slowly and subtely come to focus while the
mystery plot fades into the background.  If I can say one thing bad against
this film, it's that the mystery itself isn't all that intriguing.  It
uncovers a lot, mysteries where generations are harmed by past generations,
and it allows a couple cool twists, but in all reality, do we really care
about it once the love story has taken precedence?  Why worry about a
secret hit from 30 years ago when you can relish in a touching love story
between two alienated and damaged people?</P>
<P>But, in all reality, that's the strength of this film.  It gradually lets
us forget about the mystery, and we soon become so involved with the
character stories, including the story of Steve and his girlfriend, that we
never even realize that it's taken the foreground. Sure, it's still quirky,
and there's a lot of big laughs here, especially in the opening sequence
which intercuts a meeting Steve has with Gregory and a conversation Steve
has with a friend where he contradicts what he says over and over again. 
But a touching love story and one man's plight into beginning to understand
the emotions of other people is something that I sure wasn't expecting,
what with the opening promising another quirky thriller a la "Grosse Pointe
Blank," but that I was all the more happier to allow happen.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***1/2</PRE>
