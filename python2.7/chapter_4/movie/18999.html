<P>Sometimes, a movie goes so far beyond political correctness that it
becomes necessary to coin a new term to describe the bizarre gyrations
a movie studio will undertake to avoid offending the professionally
offended.  In my opinion, a good candidate for this new term is
"tarzan", as in:  "That movie was tarzan from end to end" and "man,
they really tarzanned that one up".</P>
<P>Mind you, the visuals of Disney's new animated Tarzan are often lush,
and the hardware assisted graphics are mind boggling.  In fact, the
only times where the animation falls short, where it gets most
saturday-morning-ish,  are the very times when the movie is at it's
most obsequious.  It's almost as if two animation teams worked on the
film; one from a major motion picture studio, and one from Darkwing
Duck.</P>
<P>Tarzan is, thankfully, entirely free of the dreary, unrelenting potty
humor that has plagued recent Disney releases.  Although the humor is
usually forced and often embarrassing, it doesn't stoop to the stygian
depths of My Favorite Martian, or even the mild anal references in
Flubber.  Tarzan, in fact, has the antiseptic quality of early Disney
cartoons.  Back when they were, you know, good.</P>
<P>But what Disney studios did to the story, and for what (apparent)
reasons, is something that should never happen to a major novel.</P>
<P>Tarzan of the Apes, published in 1912, was the first novel in a series
that eventually became 30-odd novels, books of short stories, and
juveniles.  In this story, John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, and his young
wife are abandoned on an African beach by mutineers.  Clayton does the
best he can for his young bride, but eventually, some time after
giving birth to a son, she succumbs to madness and death.</P>
<P>Nearby dwell a tribe of the "near exinct"  (and probably fictional)
"great apes" the "largest and most ferocious" of the simians.  Their
leader is the bloodthirsty Kerchak, a huge bull ape prone to episodes
of sudden uncontrollable rage.  It was during one of these episodes
that he attacks Kala, a young female in his tribe, and causes the
death of her child.</P>
<P>Inevitably, the tribe finds Clayton's cabin, and Kerchak himself kills
John Clayton as he sits in deep depression after his wife's death.
The apes explore the cabin, and Kala finds Clayton's young son still
alive in the crib, next to the body of his mother.  Nearly mad with
grief over the loss of her own cub, Kala takes the young child to
raise as her own, calling him Tarzan.  Tublat, Kala's mate, appeals to
Kerchak (during one of his more lucid moments) to force Kala to give
up the hairless ape, but Kala threatens to leave the tribe, and
Kerchak is reluctant to lose her.</P>
<P>Tarzan, of course, grows up with the apes, learning to use his greater
intelligence and natural curiosity to compensate for his lack of brute
strength and natural armament.  At ten years old, his curiosity leads
him to his unknown father's cabin, where he finds the hunting knife
which would be the means of his salvation when he's attacked soon
after by a huge gorilla.  Tarzan narrowly escapes death and makes his
first great kill.</P>
<P>Years later, when Kerchak flys into one of his famous rages, Tarzan
kills him and assumes leadership of the tribe.</P>
<P>The story is told from an ape's point of view, using words in the
(again, fictional) ape language to describe the world around Tarzan.
Hence, we have Numa, the lion, Sheeta, the panther, Tantor, the
elephant, Gora, the moon.  Tarzan lives with the apes, but differs
mainly in his intelligence, practical jokes, and preference for fresh
meat which he has killed himself, as opposed to the grubs and carrion
preferred by the rest of the tribe.</P>
<P>When Tarzan reaches adulthood, a wandering tribe of cannibals moves
into the neighborhood.  When Kala is killed by Kulonga, the son of
Chief Mbonga of the cannibal tribe, a bloody feud is begun between
Tarzan and the tribe that would last for many years.  From the tribe,
Tarzan steals weapons and his first garments.</P>
<P>Through a bizarre set of circumstances, Tarzan learns to read and
write English and speak French but not the other way around.</P>
<P>Later, William Clayton, nephew of Tarzan's father John Clayton,
American Jane Porter, her black servant, her father and his assistant
land near the cabin to look for an historic buried treasure.  When the
group is threatened by jungle animals, a renegade from Kerchak's
tribe, cannibals and pirates, Tarzan must save them repeatedly.  A
love triangle develops between William Clayton, Jane, and Tarzan that
is not resolved by the novel's conclusion.  Eventually, Tarzan follows
Jane to civilization.  His odd education is filled out along the way,
and in the fullness of time he becomes a polished aristocrat with the
instincts, strength and reflexes of a savage beast.</P>
<P>That's Tarzan of the Apes in a nutshell.  Now, let's let Michael
Eisner loose on it.</P>
<P>First of all, we must scour the story clean of any People of Color.</P>
<P>Gone are Jane's servant and all local natives.  Disney's Africa is,
curiously, completely devoid of Africans, reminding one of Apartheid's
"empty land theory".  This was, apparently, preferable to showing
People of Color in roles that might upset the Terminally Offendable.
Or maybe Eisner just doesn't like blacks in his cartoons.  I don't
know.</P>
<P>Of the lily-white cast, Tarzan's parents lose their objectionable
upper-crust heritage and become no-name survivors of a ship fire.
William Clayton, Lord Greystoke, Tarzan's cousin, becomes the
completely unrelated "Clayton", a standard, paper-thin Disney villian,
utterly interchangeable with Governer Rattcliffe and Gaston,
ostensibly the guide of Professor Porter.  In a great unintentional
in-joke, Tarzan, when learning English, mistakenly believes that
"Clayton" is the name of the noise made when the villian fires his
gun.  And that's all Clayton is, in the movie -- an excuse for lots of
gunshots.</P>
<P>Guns, of course, are only ever two things:  Completely ineffective
(the shotgun in Tarzan's luckless parents' cabin) or completely evil
(the double barrelled high capacity elephant-machine-gun wielded by
Clayton).  Clayton "searches for apes" by shooting at anything that
makes a sound.  Just what you always wanted in a guide.</P>
<P>Professor and Jane Porter are transformed from treasure seekers to
naturalists in search of gorrillas to study.  Burroughs' "great apes"
become Gorillas In The Mist.  Tublat is gone, and Kerchak (now a
silverback Gorilla) takes his place as Tarzan's wise, noble, adopted
father.  Just as Clayton and his henchmen are intolerably bad, the
gorillas are intolerably good and noble and just.  You can't have any
shades of grey in a Disney movie, no sir.  Nor can you have animals
acting like, well you know, animals.</P>
<P>True to Disney formula, Tarzan is saddled with two wisecracking
sidekicks, an embarrassed sounding Wayne Knight as Tantor The
Anxiety-Ridden Elephant, and in probably the most annoying role in her
career, a screechy, wisecracking Rosie O'Donnell as Terk, a midget ape
with bad hair.  In a minor divergance from formula, the sidekicks are
not at Tarzan's side for the entire movie, but true to the Disney
vision, they contribute nothing to the plot except some really painful
attempts at humor and one completely improbable rescue.</P>
<P>Thankfully, Tarzan isn't a musical as such, with the exceptions of a
brief bedtime song from Kala to young Tarzan, and a really horrible
be-bop number by Rosie O'Donnell that stops the story dead and is
guaranteed to make you squirm in your seat.  An excellent time for a
potty break.</P>
<P>Phil Collins tunes comprise most of the background music, and are
decent enough to almost make me want to buy the album.</P>
<P>As mentioned above, Burroughs' Tarzan subsists mostly on meat he has
killed himself.  Disney's Tarzan, true to nineties sensibilities, eats
only fruit and appears to be completely non-violent, killing nothing
during the movie's 88 minutes, not even nasty old meat-eating Sheeta,
the panther, who expires bloodlessly by accidentally falling on
Tarzan's spear offscreen.  In all of Tarzan's altercations, his main
strategy seems to be to keep his opponant occupied until said opponant
accidentally hurts himself.</P>
<P>There are ragged scraps of the original story in there someplace, and
indeed, Disney's Tarzan retains more of Burroughs' Tarzan of the Apes
than most of the 30-odd Tarzan movies that preceeded it.  Some of the
action scenes are amazing.  But while Disney has retained cosmetic
similarities, they've torn the guts out of the story, leaving only a
good looking, unoffensive corpse in it's place.</P>
<P>In fact, what is left is no more or less than a gender-switched
Pocahontas, with the same basic plot, character types, and a slightly
different ending.</P>
<P>Burroughs is on record as saying that his Tarzan character could best
be realized in animation, and this latest effort shows the potential
of the medium to tell the story of the displaced Lord Greystoke.
Perhaps some day we will see an effort from some other studio (perhaps
one of the Anime teams?) that hasn't been deliberately neutered.</P>
<P>Score:  One star of four for spectacular computer-assisted animation,
a few great action sequences, and some decent backgroup music.  Should
have been two stars, but I had to subtract one for general annoyance.</P>
