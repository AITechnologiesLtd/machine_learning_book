<P>     THE STUPIDS is a pleasant surprise:  a comedy about dumb characters 
that doesn't insult the audience's intelligence.  Unlike such recent 
offerings as DUMB AND DUMBER, THE BRADY BUNCH MOVIE, and KINGPIN, John 
Landis' brand of humor doesn't rely on flatulence jokes, double 
entendres, or sexual innuendo.  THE STUPIDS is relatively clean, 
entirely suitable for family viewing, and much funnier than countless 
films with harsher MPAA ratings.</P>
<P>     Brent Forrester's script is a Machiavellian masterpiece of 
misdirection, misrepresentation, and mayhem.  And be forewarned -- 
appearances can be deceiving.  Despite the title, this film is going to 
appeal more to the thinking viewer than someone who prefers to sit back 
and laugh at mindless gags.  The best aspect of THE STUPIDS is seeing 
events from two perspectives -- that of a "normal" person and that of 
our intrepid heroes, a family so dense that, put together, their 
combined IQs would have trouble reaching the triple-digit level.</P>
<P>     With a vacuous affability, Tom Arnold plays Stanley Stupid, the 
good-natured head of the Stupid clan.  Decked out in an outdated plaid 
sportscoat and straw hat, Stanley and his wardrobe both appear stranded 
in an earlier decade.  His wife, Joan (Jessica Lundy), and children, 
Buster (Bug Hall) and Petunia (Alex McKenna), are just as intellectually 
dim and fashion impaired.  Joan looks like she just stepped out of an 
episode of LEAVE IT TO BEAVER.  </P>
<P>     The story, which involves conspiracies to take over the world and a 
possible alien invasion, begins innocently enough.  Stanley goes out one 
morning to find his curbside trash cans empty.  Someone has stolen the 
garbage again!  Unlike in the past, however, he's no longer going to sit 
back and allow this sort of thing to continue.  So, several nights 
later, after setting the bait, he hides in the bushes and waits.  When a 
huge truck comes along and the men inside take not only his garbage, but 
that of his neighbors, Stanley reaches a stunning conclusion:  this is a 
conspiracy of global proportions.  Someone is draining the world of one 
of its most valuable resources:  garbage.  A typically illogical leap 
leads Stanley to connect this latest caper to a scheme he uncovered 
years ago while working for the Postal Service, where thousands of 
letters never reached their destinations because they were being 
diverted to a mysterious Mr. Sender.  The only evidence of this 
tampering was a message stamped on the envelope:  "Return to Sender."  
Soon, the Stupids are hunting down this dangerous enemy, overcoming 
obstacles by relying on "techniques that defy description."</P>
<P>     Somehow, Stanley and his family become involved with a pair of 
illegal arms dealers (Mark Metcalf and Matt Keeslar), a meek museum 
curator who has the misfortune of being named Sender (Bob Keeshan, best 
known as Captain Kangaroo), and a janitor called Lloyd (Frankie Faison) 
whom they mistakenly believe to be God.  During the course of their 
incredible series of misadventures, they get trapped in a planetarium, 
are tracked by veteran assassins, and visit a television studio.  While 
there, Stanley appears on a talk show where he gets to explain, in song, 
how he's his own grandfather.</P>
<P>     Done in a style that recalls the TV series spoof GET SMART, THE 
STUPIDS is more likely to provoke chuckles than uncontrollable bursts of 
laughter, but the wit involved in constructing this screwball comedy is 
undeniable.  Even at a slim ninety minutes, the running length is 
probably a little too long, but, for the most part, THE STUPIDS is fresh 
and energetic.  Stupid humor like this requires a smart audience, and 
it's probably necessary to be a member of Mensa to untangle all the 
relationships revealed in Stanley's wacky musical number, "I'm My Own 
Grandpaw."</P>
<P>     Director John Landis (THE BLUES BROTHERS, AMAZON WOMEN ON THE 
MOON), who has never been one to make conventional movies, manages to 
inject several viciously satirical sequences into the film.  THE STUPIDS 
pokes fun at action movie heroes (and does so in a far more effective 
manner than Arnold Schwarzenegger's bloated LAST ACTION HERO), late 
night TV talk shows, and afternoon tabloid programs.  There's a 
delicious fantasy sequence with Christopher Lee playing the Stupids' 
vision of Sender.  And there are cameos by film makers David Cronenberg, 
Atom Egoyan, Robert Wise, and Norman Jewison, as well as centerfold-
turned-personality Jenny McCarthy.  </P>
<P>     THE STUPIDS is loaded (if not overloaded) with all sorts of humor -
- everything from satire and wordplay to slapstick.  Not a moment goes 
by when something amusing isn't happening, even if it's taking place in 
the background (for example, when Stanley outlines Sender's plan, take a 
look at the notes in the margins of his master diagram).  THE STUPIDS 
will be seen in different ways by different people, but one thing is 
abundantly clear:  the film makers deserve congratulations for coming up 
with something this diabolically clever.</P>
