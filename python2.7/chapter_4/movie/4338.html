<PRE>"You are a cool toy."
              - Tom Hanks to Tim Allen</PRE>
<P>     Before the Ninja Turtles, the Transformers, and the Masters of the
Universe; before the Micronauts, the five-inch G.I. Joe's, and the STAR
WARS-action figures; before Sega, Nintendo, and Atari, there existed a
world of stranger, simpler things such as Slinky, Mr.  Potato Head, and
Etch-a-Sketch.  Mostly plastic, sometimes with a battery or two, these
were the *real* toys, the toys of our youth, and the toys "brought to
life" by Pixar Animation (in conjunction with Disney) in the
appropriately titled TOY STORY.  Both jaw- dropping and heart-warming,
the first fully computer-animated feature film is *the* holiday movie
to see.</P>
<P>     The animation is nothing short of stunning.  Plastic has never
looked so good, nor seemed as real.  *More* surprising are the story
dynamics, which raise the film above the level of a novelty piece, or
just another children's picture.  You know, for kids.  The charming
premise is that, when nobody's around, toys have lives all their own.
They fight, they frolic, and even suffer the occasional identity
crisis, especially when they think they *are* the action-figure that
they've been molded in the likeness of.  Like Buzz Lightyear (voiced by
Tim Allen), the gleaming spaceman with an impressive wingspan and a
chin to rival Jay Leno's.</P>
<P>     He's the new arrival in Andy's bedroom; a birthday gift that has
cloth-cowboy Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) worried about losing the
much-coveted position of Andy's Favorite Toy.  So they bicker and feud,
and through a very amusing set of circumstances, end up *outside* and
lost in the "real world."  I won't say much more, except that a portion
of the plot involves a vicious next-door neighbor who tortures toys.
Deceptively simple and straight- forward, yet as adult as any of the
issues in CASINO or THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT.  There's also plenty of
activity on the fringe.  Small jokes pepper the film, such as a box of
"Binford Tools" that falls on Woody.  Just pay attention.</P>
<P>     Given the dubious moral messages that season the season's seasonal
releases, many may find themselves disarmed by the purity of essence
(POE?) in TOY STORY.  The tale is told from the viewpoint of someone
who loves toys.  Before the tie-in's were discussed; before the
marketing could be mustered; even before the ace casting was completed,
the gang at Pixar were creating the code that built the art that
brought their favorite toys to life.  The result is a such an
overwhelmingly fun movie, both so bold and so harmless, that it
deserves praise in any circles.  Even Bob Dole (and Baby Newt) could
enjoy this one.</P>
