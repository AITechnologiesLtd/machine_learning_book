<PRE>"Dungeons" and Dragging
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>Many years ago, my friends and I would meet every
other Saturday afternoon and embark on imaginary
quests.  In our minds, we created and entered a
mythical realm that held treasures waiting to be
discovered, perils waiting to be faced, and magic
spells waiting to be unleashed.  Our group of
adventurers included fighters that eagerly charged
into battle, mages that coruscated the sky with magic
missiles and balls of lightning, clerics that provided
healing powers, and thieves that were useful in
disarming traps and picking locks.  Overseen by an
emcee that thrust us into dangerous situations, armed
with a stack of paper that provided information about
our abilities, and equipped with a myriad of strangely
shaped dice that could spell fortune or disaster, we
giddily lost ourselves for several hours in the
neo-medieval world of Dungeons & Dragons.</P>
<P>Much of the action and skullduggery that could have
only been imagined those Saturday afternoons have been
conjured up adequately in this live-action film based
on the popular role-playing game.  The story tells
about the struggle between young, embattled Empress
Savina (Thora Birch) and the power-mad Profion (Jeremy
Irons), an evil mage who seeks to incite a revolt. 
Savina receives help from some unlikely sources
including two bumbling thieves, an apprentice mage, a
battle axe-wielding dwarf, and a dark-skinned elf. 
They find danger at every turn as they negotiate
dungeons, trapped mazes, and a dragon's lair where
they seek an artifact that can help them defeat
Profion.</P>
<P>The landscape, the various humanoid races, and the
monsters are all nicely envisioned, but the movie
suffers terribly from stilted acting and a screenplay
that sacrifices what could have been a rousing
adventure of might and magic for cartoonish mayhem. 
Jeremy Irons is frequently incomprehensible as the
snarling mage.  Thora Birch lacks passion as the
benevolent leader.  And the others players seem like
they're from various defunct WB television shows. 
They are much too young to be able to succeed in their
tasks, but are obviously cast in order to appeal to a
younger audience.  </P>
<P>With its popularity and built-in fan base, a
live-action film seemed like a no-brainer.  However,
it took 10 long years before a suitable script and the
necessary financing (budgeted at about $40+ million)
could be put together.  And bringing the world of D&D
to life was not easy.  Only recently, the special
effects technology was adequate enough to successfully
capture the enchanted look that an ersatz Paladin like
myself could appreciate.  Indeed, the visuals are
quite impressive, making this film look far more
expensive than its purported price tag.  In its
climactic scene, for example, there is a tremendous
battle that showcases dozens of flying dragons and
spellcasting mages.  Yet while this film seems long
overdue, it also feels like it has arrived too late. 
My dice now sit in the dusty corner of some
seldom-used closet and my character sheets have
yellowed with age.  Only teens, fans of Baldur's Gate,
and Dungeon-heads will find this tolerable.</P>
