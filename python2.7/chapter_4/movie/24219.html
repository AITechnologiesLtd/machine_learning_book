<P>"Double Jeopardy" (1999) * (out of four)</P>
<P>Tommy Lee Jones chases an innocent victim around
America who is trying to prove that she did not kill
her spouse.  The Fugitive? Not quite…This is the plot
for Double Jeopardy, another Fugitive copycat without
the action, excitement, and good acting that the
original had. There are other slight differences
besides one movie being bad and the other good; this
time Tommy Lee Jones plays a parole officer not a US
Marshall, clever huh? Oh and the fugitive Ashley Judd
was framed by her own husband (Bruce Greenwood) who
needed to collect two million dollars in life
insurance money not a one armed man. Both movies are
on video. Make the wise choice and pick The Fugitive. </P>
<P>There are so many flaws in Double Jeopardy, it is
laughable. While serving time in prison, Libby Parsons
(Judd) discovers that she can never be charged for
committing the same crime twice. Learning that her
husband is still alive, she decides to serve her time
in prison, find him, retrieve her son, and kill her
husband if necessary. When the strict Parole Officer
Travis Lehman (Jones) stands in her way, Libby decides
to break the rules (who knows why?) and continue her
plan, despite the fact that if she gets caught, she's
going back to jail. </P>
<P>Director Bruce Beresford spends way too much time
trying to convince the audience that Libby misses her
son. Every other scene, we are given a shot of Libby
staring and crying at his picture. In an action movie
like this, valuable time wasted on these shots takes
away more opportunities for Libby to get up and do
something. All that is needed in this type of movie is
a short scene in which Libby tells herself or a friend
"I miss my son." Nothing more, nothing less. Dr.
Kimble of The Fugitive didn't look at one picture of
his dead wife, his primary concern was to save
himself. Libby at times shows this same determination
but not nearly enough. </P>
<P>Ashley Judd and Bruce Greenwood both are excellent
actors but if they continue to do movies like this,
they will be typecast for the rest of their careers,
kind of like their doomed co-star Tommy Lee Jones.
Winning an Oscar for The Fugitive must have convinced
Jones that audiences will never get tired of his
I-do-my-job-whether-they-are-innocent-or-guilty roles.
People still pay to see his movies and he makes plenty
of money so I guess he was right. Though I don't think
he will win another Oscar again.</P>
<P>The ultimate mistake in the script is what eventually
becomes of Libby Parsons. Even if she was excused for
disobeying her Parole Officer, the number of other
crimes she commits while on the run are too numerous
to count. Burglary, assault, grand theft auto are some
of Libby's slipups. The message of the movie is you
can break all of the small laws as long as you're
innocent of the major crime. Hopefully criminals won't
use Double Jeopardy as a reference in court for why
they are innocent. That would just be plain stupid. </P>
