 Blue Streak (1999) 1/2 star out of 4. Starring Martin Lawrence and Luke Wilson</P>
<P> "Blue Streak" is unoriginal, uninspired and derivative. Plus it stars
Martin Lawrence, a comic who thinks he's an actor in the Eddie Murphy mode
of the fast-talking con man who's smarter than anyone else - especially the
white cops with whom he becomes involved.</P>
<P> Lawrence plays Miles Logan, a master burglar who steals a diamond valued
at nearly $20 million. On the verge of being caught, he hides the gem in a
building under construction.</P>
<P> Released from jail two years later, he goes to the construction site only
to discover that the new building is a police station.</P>
<P> Failing to gain entrance disguised as a pizza delivery man, he comes up
with fake credentials and foists himself off as a new detective.</P>
<P> Luke Wilson plays the Judge Reinhold role of the not-too bright, eager,
white partner who is in awe of his new buddy's police skills.</P>
<P> The reason I mention race is because we have reached a point in movies in
which a new kind of black stereotype has evolved. From illiterate and
subservient slaves and servants, this revised image is that of a
hip-hopping, quick-talking/thinking, con artist who makes white people look
like buffoons.</P>
<P> Now, I am not opposed to the notion of mocking white people. As a matter
of fact, I'm not opposed to mocking any people as long as it is not
mean-spirited.</P>
<P> What is pertinent is that no matter which stereotype you consider - and
admittedly the contemporary one is preferable - it is still an insidious
method of classifying one group of people and setting them apart.</P>
<P> The film industry has made very large strides in nearly erasing the color
barrier. But films such as "Blue Streak" are a step backward and only
reinforce this new distortion in the minds of those ignorant enough to
believe it or base enough to try to use it for their own bigoted agendas.</P>
<P> Enough, I'm stepping down from the soapbox.</P>
<P> Plotwise, "Blue Streak" is filled with holes and missteps that are obvious
to even the most casual moviegoer.</P>
<P> Lawrence does not act - he mugs, struts, shouts and makes faces. He lacks
charm and charisma.</P>
<P> The rest of the cast really has nothing to do but stand around and look
amazed as Lawrence's Logan acts like a hot-shot detective and solves crime
after crime.</P>
<P> The ending is ludicrous, unbelievable but expected when considering this
type of fare.
 "Blue Streak" is a childish fantasy for little boys who like playing cops
and robbers.</P>
