<PRE>                               NOSTRADAMUS
                       A film review by Eric Mankin
                        Copyright 1994 Eric Mankin</PRE>
<P>     In a tower, we see the Sixteenth Century physician/prophet
Nostradamus (Tcheky Karyo) staring into space, his face filled with
alarm at a vision of the future he is seeing, his lips mouthing an
unspoken "No!"  Clearly, he is looking into the late Twentieth Century
and seeing the film Roger Christian has made on his life, a sickly
sweet dose of mystical mouthwash.</P>
<P>     The guy couldn't have been this dull.  Screenwriters, Knut Boeser
and Piers Ashworth have stamped out his story with two cookie cutters.
One formats the "misunderstood ahead-of-his-time genius confronts
fathead mediocrities" scene.  The other limns the "seer sees woman; she
makes cow eyes at him" encounter.</P>
<P>     Both of these are bad, but the prophecies are worse.  Watch Karyo
rolling his eyes and struggling to pronounce an unfamiliar word:
"Hister ... Hilzer ..." and finally picking up a brush and painting a
red swastika on the wall.  Even believers impressed by this
unforgettable dramatic moment will be frustrated, though: the visions
of the future the film makers have the master seeing are concrete up to
1989 (Saddam Hussein's face floats in the sage's magic water basin),
and then ... abruptly cease, except for brief glimpses of what look
like Deep Space 9 outtakes.</P>
<P>     Amanda Plummer, for once playing a character with an IQ above 50,
generates a little energy near the end as Catherine de Medici.
Otherwise, the prophet penning the words you now read foresees much
greater happiness for those who spend their ticket money on other
films.</P>
