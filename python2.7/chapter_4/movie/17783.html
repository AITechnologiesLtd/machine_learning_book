<P>Starring Desmond Askew, Sarah Polley, Katie Holmes, Timothy Olyphant, Taye
Diggs. Rated R.</P>
<P>What's a critic to do when he sees a movie he wholeheartedly enjoys but winds
up asking why it was made? What if a film's purpose and the motivation behind
it remains a mystery? What does one make of an interesting, entertaining
movie that is almost utterly pointless? Watching Go, the new flick from Doug
Liman, director of the sleeper hit Swingers put me in that very dilemma.</P>
<P>Go is an intriguingly structured movie in that it replays the period of time
following a drug deal 3 times: each time from the perspective of a different
character (or set of characters). First we are shown Ronna, a 17-year old
girl who works at a supermarket and is about to be evicted on Christmas Day
because she is short on her rent. When her drug trafficker friend Simon
leaves for the weekend, she jumps at the chance of making some extra bucks by
running a drug deal herself, until she finds out that her two customers are
working for the police and are about to bust her. She is forced to halt
mid-stream and dump her merchandise without getting any money, putting her in
trouble with the drug dealer whom she still owes, and whom she left a friend
of hers with as collateral. The movie then follows her as she tries to get
out of the situation, attend a rave and pay her rent all at the same time.</P>
<P>Then, after a rather unpredictable turn of events the screen fades to black
and we are taken all the way bact to the beginning, but this time the film
follows Simon as he goes to Las Vegas with his friends where he gets in
trouble with a nasty strip club bouncer and struggles to escape. Finally, as
we are taken back to the beginning again, we see the story from the point of
view of the two gay actors/criminals who are Ronna's "customers" working with
the cops trying to catch her in the act of committing a crime.</P>
<P>Go is a daring, fast-paced movie that entertains down to the bone. The
multitude of interesting characters also helps to keep the audience's
attention, and few people will be bored. The movie's script, written by John
August is full of quirky wit that will strike a chord with the film's younger
audience as well as fans of Doug Liman's slightly more upbeat Swingers.</P>
<P>I also liked the way Liman brought all of the characters together in the end,
revealing that they were all involved in the events that transpired after the
drug deal that went terribly wrong. But even with this neat loose-end tier,
Go suffers from lack of a common theme to tie these three stories together.
Sure, the lusty, steamy, violent and rather thrilling action is wickedly
entertaining but there's nothing to organize it and bring it all together
under the surface.</P>
<P>Many comparisons will be made between Go and some of Quentin Tarantino's
work, and rightfully so; some of his films have many structural similarities
with Liman's movie. The kicker, however, is that while Tarantino's dialogue
is rarely purely for dialogue's sake: there are always slight hints as to the
movie's main theme. The dialogue in Go, while funny and original, is purely
superficial.</P>
<P>Go is best viewed as an exceptionally good teen movie; where the viewer is
happy that it is good but restricts himself from yearning for more from Doug
Liman. More ambitious moviegoers may be dissappointed with this derivative
frivolous exercise. But like I said before: No one will be bored.</P>
