Dustin Putman's Film Reviews</A> ></P>
<P>In 1989, director Edward Zwick began his career with the powerful Civil 
War drama, "Glory," but since then, he has made continuous 
disappointments, to me at least, with 1994's "Legends of the Fall," and 
1996's "Courage Under Fire." Those two films weren't bad, just not very 
good, but with Zwick's latest film, "The Siege," he has finally made 
one.</P>
<P>"The Siege," is a modern-day action-thriller that focuses on terrorism 
that is sweeping through New York City. Investigating the matter is FBI 
agents Anthony Hubbard (Denzel Washington) and Frank Haddad (Tony 
Shalhoub), who are first hit by the ordeal when a city bus explodes with 
several innocent people on it. Later, a bomb goes off in a Broadway 
theater, killing even more. They soon meet CIA operative Elise Kraft 
(Annette Bening), who may very well hold the key to the identity of the 
Arab terrorist. </P>
<P>There are some movies that simply don't need to be made, and, "The 
Siege" may very well be one of them. Oh, sure, Zwick thinks he is making 
a "meaningful" action film, since he has added lots of exposition scenes 
in which the audience is basically lectured on the horrors of terrorism, 
but what he really has made is actually no more substantial than, say, 
"Die Hard," which also starred Bruce Willis. This time, Willis is 
horribly wasted as a General of the U.S. Army, who puts a state of 
martial law over NYC during the climax. Whatever points, "The Siege," 
earnestly tried to make, were obviously lost in the translation from 
page to screen, or maybe, Zwick never really had anything serious to say 
in the first place. The role of the Arab community is offensively 
stereotypical, just as women were in the recent, "John Caprenter's 
Vampires," by placing them all in the category of "bad guys."</P>
<P>"The Siege," contains three fine actors---Washington, Bening, and 
Shalhoub---but Washington is stuck with a character that contains not an 
ounce of even remote development. Bening has slightly more to do, and 
has an intriguing character to work with, while Shalhoub pretty much 
steals the show, even though, again, he has no real character.</P>
<P>By the climax of, "The Siege," with Washington giving a sermon to Willis 
on the so-called "message" of the story, I felt like I had wandered into 
a sequel to, "On Deadly Ground," in which Steven Seagal gave a 10-minute 
speech at the end about preserving the environment. "The Siege" is 
constantly heavy-handed, not entertaining or insightful, and just goes 
to prove that not even the best actors can save a film that lacks a 
satisfactory screenplay.</P>
