ORFEU
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>"There is much danger in life for those who love," ORFEU tells us in 
voice-over in its introduction.  Dangerous indeed.  Inspired by Marcel 
Camus's BLACK ORPHEUS, Carlos Diegues's ORFEU is a rambling, romantic 
tale that is laced with gratuitous violence.</P>
<P>Set in the Rio de Janeiro slums during Brazil's famous Carnival time, 
the movie tells of a charismatic lover named Orfeu (Toni Garrido), who 
has had more women that the grains of sand in the Copacabana beaches.  
His current girlfriend, Mira (Isabel Fillardis), is on the cover of 
Playboy, which she likes to run around showing off to everyone.</P>
<P>The slums are the setting for a surreal civil war.  On one side are 
armies of police with machine guns, and on the other are equally 
well-armed drug dealers.  As the shots pierce the thin walls of the 
homes, people are remarkably and unrealistically complacent until they 
are personally shot by stray bullets.  Innocent bystanders stand along 
the streets unconcerned as if some unseen angel were protecting them 
from the bullets zipping by them.  </P>
<P>Suggesting that the bad guys are perhaps really the good ones, the story 
has the drug gangs enact their own vigilante justice.  One rapist, 
having had gasoline poured all over him, is given the option of being 
burnt alive or jumping off the side of a tall cliff to his death.  He 
has a hard time choosing.  </P>
<P>Against this background, a fetching, black-haired beauty named Eurídice 
(Patrícia França) meets Orfeu.  Instantly smitten by Orfeu, she quickly 
and happily loses her virginity to him.</P>
<P>Every time you are ready to completely give up on the movie, the camera 
pulls back to reveal another stunning vista, or the music comes up with 
an entrancing melody.  Rio looks great at sunset, at midday and even in 
the rain.  Best of all are the sumptuously colorful scenes of the 
Carnival dancers and floats.  But like the rest of ORFEU, the 
cinematography is quite uneven.  For every gorgeous outdoor scene there 
is a poorly filmed interior one.  This leaves us with a few things to 
admire about ORFEU, but only a few.</P>
<P>ORFEU runs a long 1:40.  The film is in Portuguese with English 
subtitles.  It is not rated but would be an R for strong violence, 
nudity, sexuality and language.</P>
