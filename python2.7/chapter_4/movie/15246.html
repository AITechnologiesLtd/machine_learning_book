<P>"Meet Joe Black" offers definitive proof that there is indeed such a thing
as too much of a good thing. Updating the venerable old chestnut "Death
Takes A Holiday" may have seemed like an inspired idea and casting Brad Pitt
as Death and Anthony Hopkins as his intended victim undoubtedly enhanced the
project's profile at Universal Pictures, badly in need of a marketable movie
after a disasterous year at the box office.
 Turning the movie over to director Martin Brest, however, was -- pardon the
pun -- the kiss of death. As he proved with his 1992 epic "Scent of a
Woman," Brest is a guy who doesn't know the meaning of the word "cut," and
while "Scent" at least offered an Oscar-winning Al Pacino performance to
hold the interest, "Joe" is so low-key it can't help but feel like a slender
little story stretched far beyond its limits. Brest lets scene after scene
ramble on and on, giving the picture a languid air that makes its three-hour
running time feel more like three weeks. For everyone except the most
fervent Pitt fans, this is Sominex Cinema.
 "Joe" gets off to a solid start, introducing Pitt as an effervescent young
lawyer who wows medical student Susan Parrish (Claire Forlani) in a
coffeeshop encounter. But when Susan meets what she thinks is the same man
later on, he seems to have had his personality stolen. Now he's reserved,
stiff and, in many ways, downright weird. That's because Death, curious
about life, is using the lawyer's body as a kind of luxurious vacation home.
 Speaking of luxury, Death has moved in with ultra-rich communications
magnate Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) -- get it? Death and Parrish? --
whose upcoming 65th birthday is destined to be his last. A deal is struck
that as long as Parrish keeps Death amused and keeps his identity a secret,
Parrish can enjoy a little extra time on Earth; Death, in turn, can learn
what peanut butter tastes like and discover what love feels like.
 Most of "Joe" involves Death behaving like a child, slurping food, spinning
around in an office chair and weaving from side to side as he toddles
around. Seeing Pitt play infantilism is good for a few laughs at first, but
it's hard to believe someone as seemingly worldly as Susan finds these
traits sexy; when she begins to undress him during the big poolside love
scene you're uncertain if she's going to seduce him or check his diaper.
 Since no Pitt movie these days is complete without him doing a misguided
accent, he's allowed to tackle Jamaican patois this time out in a subplot
that could easily have been dropped. But then almost everything in "Joe" is
done to excess, including Thomas Newman's grandoise score, which vainly
tries to make this muddled drama seem important and exciting.
 If nothing else, the movie is extremely well-produced and easy to look at,
shot in a rich color scheme of ebony, amber and peach. And certainly there
are worse ways to waste 179 minutes than looking at Pitt and the sloe-eyed
Forlani, who makes Susan easily the most fascinating character in the film.
But as otherworldly romances go, "Joe" pales next to the far more compelling
"City of Angels," which actually had some points to make about the human
condition. "Joe," in contrast, has little to say and takes far too long to
say it.
