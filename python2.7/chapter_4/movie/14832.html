FILM FREAK CENTRAL
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/~billchambers/">http://www.geocities.com/~billchambers/</A> )</P>
<P>starring Dylan Baker, Jane Adams, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Cynthia
Stevenson
written and directed by Todd Solondz</P>
<P>The best movie of the year is, unfortunately, neither an 'entertaining'
nor a mainstream experience. I doubt HAPPINESS will enjoy success as
more than just a critical darling, for Solondz paints an even grimmer
portrait of suburbia than last year's The Ice Storm, as well as his own
Sundance winner, Welcome to the Dollhouse. HAPPINESS is not escapism; it
is a film for grown-ups.</P>
<P>Its narrative structure is Altman-esque. We meet three New Jersey
sisters: Joy Jordan (Adams), a single woman who fears her
passive-aggressive behavior provokes hostility in loved ones; Helen
(Lara Flynn Boyle), a famous poet with a private desire to be dominated;
and Trish (Stevenson), mother of three and wife of reputable
psychiatrist Bill Maplewood (Baker)-Trish is constantly boasting about
her idyllic home-life to her siblings. She is unaware that her shrink
husband lusts after young boys-teeny-bop magazines are fodder for his
obsessions. Nor is Dr. Maplewood above molesting one of his eleven year
old son's friends with the assistance of the date-rape drug. Meanwhile,
his patients are carrying out their own psychosexual
fantasies: Allen, Helen's anonymous, depraved, overweight neighbour,
spends his days as an affable office crony but at night strips down to
his underwear, gets drunk, calls women at random and barks orders at
them of the sort one hears in porno films. (The movie rather amusingly
makes an issue out of *69.) Helen is his fantasy figure, but he is
unable to connect with anyone on a sexually mature level, comfortless in
his own skin. Which makes his verbal abuse of equally portly other
neighbour Kristina (Camryn Manheim) all the more perplexing.</P>
<P>I could go on illustrating the various plot-threads: the Jordan girls'
separated parents (played by Ben Gazzarra and Louise Lasser; to my mind,
this bickering couple are the least compelling aspect of HAPPINESS)
cause perfectionist Trish much consternation, and Joy's difficult
relationship with a Russian refugee cabbie (Jared Harris) confuses Joy
further. (I've only described the tip of this 134 minute iceberg.) Yet
the soul of the film is one story: pedophilic Dr. Maplewood had my
sympathies to the very end, even as I was sickened by his actions. (The
events leading up to a boy's rape earned laughs from a preview audience
of nervous critics, which led a few of them to attack Solondz for
trivializing the subject matter-he didn't.) Baker's portrayal is
captivating and four-dimensional; Maplewood's scenes with loving son
Billy (Rufus Read)-whose own open, innocent desire to experience
ejaculation for the first time forces his father to confront his boy's
burgeoning adolescene at a time when his own secret nature is getting
the best of him-are heartbreaking, to say the least.</P>
<P>If someone were to ask me to summarize HAPPINESS in one awkward
sentence, I would probably respond: a group of characters discover that
acting upon their impulses, sexual and otherwise, will bring them
temporary "happiness"-they seem to have ditched all notions of attaining
it beyond superficially. What is happiness, anyway, and who said it
could/should/would last? Solondz' film, from the charged opening scene
(featuring a cameo by a raging Jon Lovitz!) to the melancholy (yet
controversial) finish, is a breathtakingly naturalistic creation. On the
cinematic side of things, the images seemed oversaturated at times-lawn
greens were so vibrant-looking, it was as if they'd been painted. (And
isn't that the point? Suburbia looks shiny on the surface?) I also
appreciated the old-fashioned title cards-HAPPINESS incidentally shares
its name with a 1924 silent.</P>
<P>Universal's "independent" division (an oxymoron), October, abandoned
Solondz' picture after his final cut turned out to be too "edgy" for
release under the major's banner. So Good Machine (the production
company behind, not ironically, The Ice Storm) is distributing it
instead. It's their first time at bat without support from a major
financier. Show them they took an important risk and see HAPPINESS, a
film for our times.</P>
