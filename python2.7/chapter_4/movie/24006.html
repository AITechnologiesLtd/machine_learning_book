<P>Sylvester Stallone has not had a beguiling career since the heyday of "Rocky"
nearly ten years ago. Since then he's tried and failed with comedy ("Oscar"),
musicals ("Rhinestone"), and drama ("Rocky V"). Stallone is usually best in his
action roles such as "Rambo" or "Cliffhanger," but his range as an actor is
fairly limited. "Cop Land" is supposed to be Stallone's first very dramatic
role but there's no energy and no enthusiasm, much like the movie itself. </P>
<P>Stallone plays Fred Heflin, a simple-minded, stolid sheriff of Garrison, a
fictional New Jersey town. His chain of command in this town is nil, and he
only has two other people in his staff. His basic duties are relegated to
traffic duty. The New York cops who run this Jersey town are controlling
everything but there's corruption boiling everywhere. Michael Rapaport plays a
cop nicknamed Superboy who inadvertently kills two black teenagers during a car
chase. The police want to cover it up, and Superboy supposedly commits suicide
by jumping off a bridge. Fred is oblivious to these surroundings and decides to
take no action against the corrupt cops because they put him where he is now. A
colorful Internal Affairs officer (Robert De Niro) tries to get information
from the unwilling Fred but fails. It turns out Fred is more interested in a
cop's wife (Annabella Sciorra) but when people start getting knocked off, he
decides he has to do what is morally correct. He gets some guidance from a
former cop (Ray Liotta) who is also a cokehead. </P>
<P>"Cop Land" could have worked with some imaginative direction, a stronger plot
and a better performance by the lead actor but it is no different from any TV
movie on the same subject. There have been countless movies on police
corruption - the best of these was the decadent "Bad Lieutenant" - and so
there's nothing here we haven't seen before and better. For example, there's a
gun planted at a crime scene; a typical Internal Affairs interrogation scene;
badges flashed by several cops; nonessential bar fights; and a final, cliched
shootout staged in slow-motion a'la Peckinpah. None of this is handled with any
energy, flash, or vigor - it has a TV movie staleness that discomfits rather
than enthralls. </P>
<P>Stallone is inarticulate as an actor and, although that might help the role, he
sleepwalks through the film with no trace of humor or passion. Harvey Keitel is
naturally more animated as an actor but his corrupt cop character is something
he can play in his sleep. Ray Liotta is convincingly frantic as the druggy cop
but his role is too similar to his Henry Hill character in "GoodFellas." Peter
Berg, Frank Vincent, Michael Rapaport, Cathy Moriarty, Janeane Garofalo and
Annabella Sciorra play trivial, forgettable roles with no inner life or central
meaning to the story. A chance meeting between De Niro and Keitel is wonderful
to behold but the scene is never followed up on. Ditto the Garofalo character,
a new cop in Heflin's staff, who helps Heflin at the beginning but then decides
to leave town. Why? Where's the transition? </P>
<P>"Cop Land" is directed by James Mangold who helmed the brilliant character
study Heavy. This film, though, has the same snail pace and static energy, and
it deadens rather than enliven the proceedings. Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta
breathe life into the film whenever they appear on screen. Stallone and "Cop
Land," however, are too ordinary and listless to keep anyone interested. Watch
the invigorating TV show "NYPD Blue" instead.</P>
