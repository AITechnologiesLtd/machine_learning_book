<P>   Hitler promulgated the Big Lie technique in his rambling
autobiography, "Mein Kampf."  Tell a flagrant lie often
enough--making sure it's a whopper (because people would
not believe a small fib)--and people will accept it.  One of the
biggest lies of the 20th century is that the Holocaust never
happened.  Despite mountains of evidence--documentation,
testimony of thousands of survivors, interviews with people
on all sides of World War 2 including talks with the population
of the areas surrounding the smoke-filled crematoria--a
relatively small but influential cabal of revisionists insists that
the Holocaust is a myth.  Never mind that six million Jews
disappeared from the face of the earth.  Take a fact that
people today would rather not admit, simply deny it, and poof:
you have a coterie of followers.  These adherents are not just
neo-Nazis: Holocaust deniers include bubbleheads and naifs
as well.  An engineer from Malden, Massachusetts, one Fred
A. Leuchter, could not be called a bubblehead, but this
mousy guy who before 1988 had never traveled abroad--
ostensibly eager for attention, celebrity status, and gullible to
boot--became one of America's leading spokesmen for the
Big Lie.  Though insisting to this day that he is in no way
anti-Semitic (very likely true), he was determined to prove
that the structures built by the Nazis in Poland to eliminate
Jews and "undesirables" simply were not gas chambers. 
What, then happened to the millions who perished in the
camps?  Leuchter does not go into this.  His aim was simply
to prove via forensic evidence that the stones that formed the
basis of the chambers were never touched by poisonous
gases.</P>
<P>   If Leuchter did nothing but get his infamous report
published in a dozen or so languages, he would be an
interesting enough subject for a documentary.  But Leuchter
is in other ways quite an unusual fellow, one whose
contributions require an ace documentarian to elicit.  Simply
getting the man to talk freely and articulately for the cameras-
-as could interviewers like Fred Wiseman and Claude
Lanzmann--would itself be daunting.  But Errol Morris, who
filmed this fascinating journey of discovery, was the man for
the job.  To his credit, Morris has given us such films as "The
Thin Blue Line," a 1988 blockbuster which proved that a
hitchhiker did not kill a Dallas policeman in 1976--and that the
lowlife who fingered him (and who wound up on Death Row
for a subsequent murder) did.  That remarkable documentary,
which employed a score by Philip Glass, led to the reopening
of the case.  The defendant was cleared.  Morris's most
complex documentary, however, "A Brief History of Time,"
dealt with the work of physicist Stephen Hawking, while his
least accessible film, "Fast Cheap & Out of Control" looks at
the lives of four totally different men and tries to meld the
quartet (unsuccessfully, I thought), into an examination of the
nature of existence itself.</P>
<P>   Why, then, did Morris choose Leuchter as his subject this
year?  Leuchter would have been the ideal subject for the
long defunct TV series, "What's My Line."  Arlene Francis
herself would not have guessed his profession.  As an
engineer interested in making executions more humane and
dignified for both the executees (as he calls them) and for
their guards, he was called in as a consultant by several
states to look over their death machines and to suggest
changes.  We see him in the modern, antiseptic Tennessee
death house, where he explains the methodology of the
electric chair and discusses the changes he proposed to
make a shocking death more merciful.  We learn that the
executioner delivers two shocks: one a brief jolt that cooks
the guy's nervous system and renders him all but dead. The
second jolt, lasting a minute of so, finishes him off.  The
trouble with some of these executions, Leuchter reminds us,
is that in some cases excessive electricity cooks the killer so
that his eyeballs fly across the room and, as in one Florida
case, his head could catch fire.  Leuchter's skill in designing
better straps and helmets for the Tennessee hot seat gave
him an immediate contract in another state to re-build its gas
chamber.  Leuchter's career was on a roll.  Until...</P>
<P>   ...until a neo-Nazi, Ernst Zundel, published a tract in
Canada "Did 6 Million Really Die?" which argued that the
Holocaust was nothing but hate propaganda.  Put on trial for
violating Canada's law forbidding Holocaust denial (a form of
hate), Zundel convinced Leuchter to go to Auschwitz to
attempt to prove that the gas chambers simply did not exist. 
When Leuchter visited the buildings in the infamous Polish
town--taking his new wife Carolyn with him as their
"honeymoon" as well as a cinematographer and translator--he
secretly and illegally scraped samples of the stone walls to
take home with him.  Delivering the pulverized samples to a
Massachusetts lab, he received a report that there was no
trace of cyanide in the specimens.  Assuring his public both
in his writings and in a flurry of conferences before largely
sympathetic groups that traces of cyanide would have
remained on the stones forever, he failed to report that by
breaking his specimens into parts no more than 1/10,000 of
the original stones, he watered down the segments to such
an extent that no gas could possibly be present.</P>
<P>   Thinking that his finding would enhance his career, he was
dismayed when he lost all his contracts with the death
houses and when even his wife left him for good.  </P>
<P>   Documentaries usually aim for variety by presenting a large
number of talking heads, the documentarian interviewing
each and switching back and forth to give the viewer the
impression of diversity.  In this case--while some interviews
are held with Jewish groups, with a scientist in the
Massachusetts lab, with the neo-Nazi who interested
Leuchter in the journey to Poland--Morris concentrates almost
exclusively on Leuchter himself.  This guy, deluded as he is,
"wearing blinders" as others described him, and easily
influenced by heinous anti-Semites, is strangely difficult to
dislike.  Though somewhat mousy behind his thick glasses
and small stature, Leuchter--who admits to drinking 40 cups
of coffee going through six packs of cigarettes  a day--is
difficult to detest.  He is articulate through his pronounced
New England accent but never resorts to throat-clearers like
"you know," "like," "uh," and other disturbing mannerisms that
could make the typical audience for a documentary bolt for
the doors.  He seems to prove something we liberal arts
students back in college always said about the engineering
students: that while they actually build things, we could think. 
Leuchter, for all his training, comes across lacking in
Education with a capital E.  In a sense he is like the Nazis
themselves--highly efficient in what they did but absolutely,
disastrously psychotically wrongheaded in their mission.  Just
as Hitler destroyed his own country while trying to bring it to
his perverted idea of greatness, so Leuchter destroyed his
career and even his social life.  Now bereft of jobs, family
and friends, he seems to have difficulty even selling the lethal
injection machine he designed and half completed when the
state canceled his contract and threw the gadget at him to
keep.  This powerful and perversely humorous film, however,
has the opposite consequence for Errol Morris, who comes
out as one of the country's premier documentarians with yet
another compelling film on his resume.</P>
