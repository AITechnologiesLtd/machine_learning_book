with the word "subscribe" in the subject line.</P>
<P>Jeffrey Wigand is a hero. The former corporate officer of a major
tobacco company risked everything to blow the whistle on his employers
and "60 Minutes" producer Lowell Bergman eagerly taped his
statement. But greed and fear at the highest levels of the network led
CBS to pull the finished segment. Stunned at the breach of
journalistic integrity, Bergman frantically tried to save the
interview while his number one source was left twisting in the wind.</P>
<P>This powerful slice of recent history deserves the big screen
treatment. To a degree, "The Insider" does its subject proud. But at a
whopping two hours and 38 minutes, the deliberately paced film from
director Michael Mann ("Last of the Mohicans," "Heat") is about 40
minutes too long. As if that wasn't challenging enough, a shift in
focus from Wigand to Bergman during the last hour further undermines
the impact of the piece. In real life, Wigand found himself swallowed
by network politics and a smear campaign by the tobacco
company. Sadly, his character ends up a ghost in the film as well.</P>
<P>Still, patient viewers will find substantial rewards here. After
breaking onto the American scene with "L.A. Confidential," Russell
Crowe gives another stellar performance as Jeffrey Wigand, a scientist
who learned that cigarettes were merely "a delivery device for
nicotine" and that the tobacco companies routinely manipulated the
drug to further promote addiction. Crowe deftly creates a rich,
three-dimensional portrait of this deeply conflicted man. For
authenticity, the actor also gained 50 pounds for the role and proudly
displays the results in a brief "Check out my flab - - am I dedicated
or what?!" shirtless scene, one of the more amusing contemporary movie
clichés.</P>
<P>Thankfully, serial overactor Al Pacino reigns in his scenery chomping
for most of the film, although he finally tears loose towards the end
of the story. As Mike Wallace, Christopher Plummer does a reasonable,
if oily, impersonation of the veteran newsman.</P>
<P>"The Insider" is similar in theme and structure to "Prince of the
City," although the latter is a far superior film. While even longer
than "The Insider," "Prince" had a much more intricate story to
tell. In addition, the filmmakers recognized the importance of keeping
their tortured informant in the center of the proceedings. When "The
Insider" veers from Wigand to Bergman, the film becomes just another
tale of a crusading journalist, and, though the mechanics are
fascinating, it remains a trip through overly familiar
territory. While the tobacco company failed in their attempt to bury
Jeffrey Wigand, "The Insider" finally dismisses him, leaving the man a
footnote at the end of his own valiant story.</P>
