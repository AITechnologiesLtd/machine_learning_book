<PRE>Summer 2001: The Studio Which Would Be King
A feature story by Max Messier
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>The billboards have been taken down, the endless parade of TV spots has
stopped, the lines around the block are now non-existent, and the summer
movie fiasco of 2001 has come to a close.  With too much time on our
hands and the ugly notion that we can really make a difference,
filmcritic.com presents the winners and losers from four painful months
of J. Lo's acting, seven sequels, another dinosaur movie, horrible
remakes, and Michael Bay's first financial failure.</P>

$17 million budget - $35 million gross - Winner: Warner Bros.</P>
<PRE>AND THE WINNER IS...</PRE>
<P>Our math is sketchy and some films are still tracking, but Universal is
the summer's runaway success, with three of its six films being sequels
of already known quantities.  On the flipside, thanks to the disastrous
Final Fantasy Sony is the only studio that failed to recoup its budget
through theatrical grosses -- and the studio only gets to keep half of
that!</P>
<P>Adding up the totals, here's where the studios stand so far.  For those
of you who shelled out good money on a summer full of losers, shame.</P>
<PRE>Universal: up $417 million
Dreamworks: up $168 million
Disney (with Miramax): up $156 million
Warner Brothers (with New Line): up $126 million
Fox: up $125 million
MGM: up $55 million
Paramount: up $42 million
Columbia: down $56 million</PRE>
