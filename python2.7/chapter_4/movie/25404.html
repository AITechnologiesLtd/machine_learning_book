<P>Jesus' Son floats along with the hallucinatory feel of a drug addict's sense 
of recollection. It's not so much a movie as it's a well made patchwork 
quilt of memories. Its tales are woven together through FuckHead, or F.H. 
(Crudup), an intrinsically sweet young man who stumbles into the drug 
culture of the 70's. He remembers his life in a stream of consciousness, 
often interrupting himself to fumble back and forth through the gaps in his 
memory. It has a severely episodic feel with no sequence carrying more 
weight than another, save one. The film is based upon a collection of short 
stories in novel form by Denis Johnson, which based itself on a line from a 
Lou Reed song, "....When I'm rushing on the run, and I feel just like Jesus' 
son..."</P>
<P>F.H starts on his decent through the unknowing lure of Jezebel-like Michelle 
(Morton), who shoots up in front of him after their first night of 
lovemaking as he looks on, cluelessly munching a bowl of cereal. Soon both 
of them are suffocating in a fog of drugs. Morton infuses Michelle with  
equal parts of feistiness and emotional dependence in a shaded performance. 
F.H.  displays an incessant hunger for Michelle's attention. Their love 
affair comes across not so much as heart felt emotion, but rather a vampiric 
sucking of life force. Drugs have leeched away part of their ability to 
connect with others and they use each other, much as a drug, to continue to 
feel something in their nomadic lives. Their love affair ends badly, as does 
anything F.H. touches, hence his name.</P>
<P>F.H meets a possible future version of himself in Leary's character, a worn 
sparkplug of a man who long ago quit firing effectively. His hollow eyed 
husk of a man takes F.H. on an employment opportunity that consists of 
ripping the copper wiring from an apartment that may, or may not, belong to 
him. They sell the precious metal to fund a day of drinking and heroin and 
simpleton F.H. considers it one of the best days of his life. F.H. sees no 
moral implication to his actions or others. He simply exists in the moment. 
Leary's character shows the consequences of such a myopic view of life, a 
fate F.H. almost shares, if not for the twisted touch of his love for 
Michelle.</P>
<P>Holly Hunter as sensitive woman with a touch of death, Will Patton as a 
smarmy, albeit brief suitor for Michelle and Dennis Hopper as a recovering 
drug addict clinging to life each get a vignette sprinkled with some sharp, 
revealing lines. They give solid readings, but none truly stand out as does 
Jack Black as a fellow orderly F.H. works with in a hospital emergency room.</P>
<P>Georgie's (Black) Zen-like lunacy fuels some of the few laugh out loud 
moments as he performs unauthorized surgery on a man with a knife stuck in 
his eye, or performs his own seemingly hunger induced surgery on some road 
kill. Not only is it black humor at it's finest, but turns a probing eye on 
F.H.'s inability to cope with momentous events in his life as his memory is 
retold in two different lights.</P>
<P>Several times, subtle allusions are made to Jesus, each done in a disturbing 
fashion. At one point F.H. looks through the window of a diner, the 
lettering on the window making it seem as it he has a crown of thorns. He 
follows a snakeskin wearing man for no reason off the subway, and is 
surprised to find himself inexplicably aroused by his encounter with the 
serpent. A couple of times, people make reference to him not being "the one.</P>
<P>Jesus' Son  meanders along pointlessly. There's no plot to speak of, simply 
a recovering addict's ruminations on what brought him to the point he is. I 
wanted to feel emotional attachment to the angelic F.H., but as the film 
ended I realized I didn't really know him, so how could I truly care about 
him? I saw what heroin had made him, but I never got a real glimpse at the 
man he was before his adventure in wonderland. In telling his tale, he never 
manages to connect with the listener.</P>
