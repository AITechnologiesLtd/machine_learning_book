<P>The most expensive European film ever made (reportedly $95 million) kicks
off with a 20-minute battle scene in which Russia's Red Army unsuccessfully
tries to drive Hitler's troops out of 1942 Stalingrad.  If Enemy at the
Gates had been released, oh, say, two and a half years ago, this opening
would have been downright shocking, but in our post-Saving Private Ryan
world, it feels blasé.  Is it horrifying?  You bet, but it still pales in
comparison to Ryan's graphic icebreaker.  We see the Volga River strewn with
debris that includes arms and legs, and a little Braveheart is thrown in for
good measure when the Russians charge toward their demise.  Of course, Ryan
and Braveheart weren't saddled with James Horner's unnecessary heavy-handed
score, either.</P>
<P>Set against the backdrop of the Battle of Stalingrad, Enemy is about a young
sniper from the Ural Mountains named Vassily Zaitsev (Jude Law, The Talented
Mr. Ripley), who, as we learn from the film's prelude, was educated in
marksmanship by his grandfather.  After the Germans wipe out most of the Red
Army in Enemy's opening scene, Vassily and a Russian political officer named
Danilov (Joseph Fiennes, Shakespeare in Love) meet while hiding out in a
pile of dead bodies.  One has a rifle, and one has five rounds of
ammunition, but before you can say "Texas Book Depository," Vassily has
scored five nice head shots on a group of nearby German officers.</P>
<P>The incident propels Vassily to hero status in Russia, thanks mostly to
Danilov's cunning in the production and distribution of a Russian war
newspaper that sings the praises of the Russian Davy Crockett (he killed him
a wolf when he was only five, as the legend goes).  Vassily's story
invigorates his homeland, which then proceeds to dig in their heels and push
the Germans out of their country in what became one of the key turning
points of World War II.  Danilov is Colonel Tom to Vassily's Elvis, making
him a larger-than-life figure, a national hero and a real thorn in Hitler's
side.</P>
<P>But the bulk of Enemy is comprised of a cat-and-mouse game between Vassily
and a German sniper named Koenig (Ed Harris, Pollock), who was brought in to
Stalingrad to eliminate his Russian counterpart.  It might sound exciting,
but a 15-minute set piece about two snipers can get pretty tiring.  You
could easily be on the edge of your seat for the first five minutes, lose
interest, and then fall asleep for the last five.  There's a lot of lying
around and remaining very still.  It takes a special director to pull this
off, and I'm not sure Jean-Jacques Annaud (Seven Years in Tibet) is the
right guy. This is a typical David vs. Goliath battle that plays like the
Wachowski brothers' Assassins meets The Bad News Bears (with Sunshine's
Rachel Weisz playing the Tatum O'Neal role).</P>
<P>Weisz plays Tania, an educated Russian Jew who volunteered to fight the
Germans after they killed her parents.  Because she knows German, Danilov
wants Tania to stay behind the scenes with him to interpret intercepted
messages, while Vassily prefers she focus her rage on physical battles. The
men end up playing tug-of-war with Tania's skills and heart, which puts them
at odds with each other.  She prefers Vassily (the two share an extremely
laughable but really hot sex scene - it was so Vas-silly), so Danilov is
faced with the option of selling out his comrade for the chance to hit that
thang.  This all could have been left out to help Enemy's pacing.</P>
<P>In addition to putting American audiences in the unlikely position of
rooting for the Krushchev-led Russians, Enemy takes the unfortunate route of
having each character speak with a British accent (even the ones who
actually sound German).  It's a regrettable copout made by too many films
(except Traffic).  Harris, who logs a very nice performance here, goes in
and out of a clipped German accent like he's got a split personality.  On
the more positive side of things are the lovely costumes (from likely Oscar
winner Janty Yates, Gladiator), the beautifully dark photography (Robert
Fraisse) and really terrific sets, which are mostly comprised of the inside
and outside of crumbling buildings.</P>
<P>Besides Harris' turn as the steely Koenig, Bob Hoskins (Felicia's Journey)
does extremely well playing Nikita Krushchev, although he's only on the
screen for all of two minutes.  Law, Fiennes and Weisz are all capable but
do nothing too spectacular with their roles.</P>
<P>2:11 - R for strong graphic war violence and some sexuality</P>
