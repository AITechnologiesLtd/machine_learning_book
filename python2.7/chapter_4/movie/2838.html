<P>     THE DOUBLE LIFE OF VERONIQUE is a strange film.  The structure is
typically Kieslowskian--Veronika lives in Krakow and Veronique in
Paris, each feeling that she is not alone--and it seems that the stage
is set for a philosophical contribution to the nature/nurture debate, as
in his earlier BLIND CHANCE, but instead, the film drifts off into
whimsy.  Veronika's singing kills her, and Veronique, feeling the death
of her twin, gives up music and wanders moodily round her flat and her
father's house at night.  Bored with her boyfriend, she seems to find
fulfillment with a man who makes puppets and writes fantasies for
children.  There is a hint that THE DOUBLE LIFE OF VERONIQUE is a fairy
story or just-so fable about how we came to be ourselves rather than
someone else--because we didn't catch our finger in a car door or
because we gave up singing.  But it's only a hint; there's never really
any point where we grasp what the film is about--expecting pointful
contrasts between the two lives of this woman, instead we're left
adrift.  The film goes its idiosyncratic and fleeting way in a rich
mixture of beautiful images--especially the dreamlike slow-motion
quality to the anti-communist demonstrators fleeing from police in
Krakow--and sublime music courtesy of van den Budenmayer, that
composer who should have been but alas never was.</P>
