American Beauty
Reviewed by Christian Pyle
Directed by Sam Mendes  
Written by Alan Ball 
Starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, and Mena
Suvari
Grade: A</PRE>
<P>Midway through "American Beauty" teenage filmmaker/pot dealer Ricky Fitts (Wes
Bentley) shows his girlfriend Jane Burnham (Thora Birch) a plate that Ricky's
father (Chris Cooper) keeps in a locked display case.  The plate is plain white
with gold trim; it is visibly old and elegant in its simplicity.  Jane turns
the plate over to find a swastika stamped in black.  Ricky explains, "It's like
official state china of the Third Reich."  The plate is a potent symbol for the
mission of the film:  to reveal the hidden depravity beneath the simple
elegance of American suburban conformity.</P>
<P>To the casual observer, the Burnhams seem perfect.  Lester (Kevin Spacey)
writes for a marketing magazine.  Carolyn (Annette Bening) sells real estate
and devotes her spare time to her rosebushes.  Their daughter Jane is a
cheerleader.  However, under the facade the cracks run deep, and everything is
about to split wide open.  Lester's boss has hired an efficiency expert (Barry
Del Sherman) to ax several workers.  Despite the fact that Carolyn's business
is overshadowed by that of Buddy Kane the Real Estate King (Peter Gallagher),
she lords her relative success over Lester's head and denies him sex or
affection.</P>
<P>Just as life looks its bleakest, Lester finds a strange salvation in Angela
Hayes (Mena Suvari), a teenage friend of Jane's.  Watching Angela perform as a
cheerleader, Lester has a surreal epiphany that launches him on a mid-life
crisis.  Before long, he quits his job in favor of working at a fast food
restaurant, buys a sportscar, buys weed from Ricky, and starts working out in
the garage.  Everytime Angela comes over, he fawns over her like a lovesick
kid, disgusting his daughter and raising an intense jealousy in her.  Meanwhile
Carolyn begins having an affair with Buddy and takes up target shooting.</P>
<P>The Burnhams are contrasted with their new neighbors, the Fitts.  Ricky is an
unusual young man obsessed with filming Beauty, an obsession that draws him to
Jane.  His father is a stern Marine Corps colonel given to fits of violence,
and his mother Barbara (Allison Janney of TV's "The West Wing") seems to have
been beaten into submission.  As dysfunctional as the Burnhams are, they're not
as bad as the Fitts.</P>
<P>Ricky becomes as important a character as Lester.  Although young, Ricky has
figured out what Lester learns in the movie.  Speaking of his most treasured
video, a plastic bag dancing in the wind, Ricky says this moment taught him
that "there was this entire life behind things and this incredibly benevolent
force that wanted me to know there was no reason to be afraid, ever."  Thus,
the title "American Beauty" is not as ironic as it may at first appear. 
Lester's vision of Angela as Aphrodite amid streams of rose petals is his
equivalent of the dancing bag, but he's confused by his lust and sexual
frustration for most of the movie.  Beneath the satire, "American Beauty" is
about the life-giving quest for beauty.</P>
<P>American Beauty marks the debut of both director Sam Mendes and screenwriter
Alan Ball.  Look for both to contribute great things in the future.  Ball's
script is easily the best of 1999 and richly deserves its inevitable Oscar.</P>
<P>The performances are excellent all around.  Since Kevin Spacey and Annette
Bening have already gotten their share of critical acclaim and award
nominations, I'd like to single out the always underrated Chris Cooper.  His
character, Col. Fitts, is an especially challenging character who has to go
through a complex transformation, and Cooper does an excellent job.  (Video
recommendation:  If you can find it, check out Cooper in "Pharaoh's Army," an
indie about the Civil War.)</P>
