<P>You are about to read the most schizophrenically lengthy review I have
ever written - which, ironically, marries it perfectly to the movie
being reviewed: Spike Lee's controversial BAMBOOZLED.  Here we go...</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Black TV writer Pierre DeLacroix (Damon Wayans) is charged by the White
producer of the Continental Network Systems station Mr. Dunwitty
(Michael Rapaport) to come up with an all-Black comedy show that will
boost CNS's ratings.  But when the "streetwise" Dunwitty rejects the
Harvard-educated DeLacroix's plans to create "the next Cosby show",
DeLa, along with his assistant, Sloane Hopkins (Jada Pinkett-Smith)
decides to create a show so offensive that DeLa would be fired [and thus
allowed to get out of his contract...since, after all, he has "a
mortgage to pay".  Don't ask how being fired will help pay that
mortgage, though.  Too much logic, and all].</P>
<P>Inspired by homeless Black street tap dancer Manray (Savion Glover) and
his partner Womack (Tommy Davidson), DeLa and Sloane come up with the
most heinous show imaginable: "Mantan the New Millennium Minstrel Show",
in which Manray would play Mantan and Womack would play "Sleep 'n Eat";
they both would be made up in blackface ("Black actors in blacker
blackface"), and called "Two Reeee-aaaal Coons".  Manray and Womack,
being in a state of poverty, agree to this (Womack more reluctantly so
than Manray, who'll do anything "longas the hoofin's real"), but DeLa is
ultimately undone when to his surprise not only does the
"nigga"-spouting Dunwitty love the concept, the American TV audience
eats it up.  Sloane and DeLa have a hard time living with this - but not
as hard a time as Sloane's brother Julius, aka Big Black Africa (Mos
Def), a member of the MauMau rap group who takes Issue with the
"comically" blackened minstrels, at the same time as he and his fellow
malt liquor-guzzling self-righteous MauMaus use the word "nigga" as much
if not more than the minstrels themselves.</P>
<P>The Upshot:
And the schizophrenic part?  BAMBOOZLED worked for me on so many levels
at first, that I was so utterly disappointed when it just kept going on
and on, repeating itself without saying anything New, eventually running
out of juice well before it was over.  Had I stopped watching it at a
certain point, I might've declared it a Masterpiece.  As it is, I can
neither fully praise, nor fully denigrate, this movie.  And the funny
thing is, {SOME} Black folks will try to take me to task for that very
thing ["'BAMBOOZLED' was dope!, you Oreo traitor!" ... "'BAMBOOZLED' was
wack!, you Bougie traitor!".  Can't win for losing.]</P>
<P>As a visionary tale, BAMBOOZLED knows few equals.  Spike Lee nailed many
of the dysfunctional Issues Black folks in America have as A People
(and, of course, as the many sub-cultures within the larger,
mostly-undefined Black Culture), and well as The Issue itself: what
exactly does it mean to be Black in America?  Is DeLa less Black than
Julius because Julius is "keepin' it real"?  Is Dunwitty - clearly a
Caucasian - *more* Black than DeLa because Dunwitty considers himself
"street"?  Is the White MauMau Blacker than *all* of them?  And when it
gets right down to it, is there even such a thing as one single "Black
Culture"?</P>
<P>Though Lee's targets were many, and wide (and, depending on who you ask
- for instance, Hollywood's Finest Black Comedy Stars, many of whom
loudly questioned Lee's "right" to do this movie - just plain off-base),
I found his aim fairly accurate, for the most part.  All the
"nigga"-slinging, all the malt-liquor drinking, all the empty mau-mauing
- even the mental separation of Us into "Blacks" and "Negroes" (or,
telling it like it 'tis, "Niggers") that too many of us (me included)
do...when Spike aimed, and hit, it spoke to many of the things I've long
felt were cultural ills with Us here in this so-called Melting Pot.  The
most heinous ill being that WE so gladly supply the Cork, and willingly
apply the ugly Blackface, to Ourselves.</P>
<P>But - and this isn't a small thing - being a Visionary is only half the
battle; to have a successful movie, one must also have successful acting
and directing, a tight storyline, and cohesive editing.  And that is
where BAMBOOZLED ultimately failed.</P>
<P>Granted, a Spike Lee joint doesn't always follow the typical moviemaking
blueprint of your standard motion picture.  To that end, the weird
jumpcuts, the unnatural-feeling scenes, and the strange editing, were
Lee trademarks.  But this film couldn't afford Lee's quirks *and* his
inability to cut out the repetition on the one hand and "grow" the story
on the other *and* an in-your-face storyline, all at the same time.
That, on top of the unbelievability of both Mantan's and Sleep 'n Eat's
Instant Revelations with no good cause (except, of course, the "wake
up!" caused by looking at your cork-blackfaced image in the mirror,
which should make *anybody* say "hmmm...maybe this isn't a good idea
after all"), and Damon Wayans' bizarre choice of a one-dimensional
portrayal of DeLacroix, almost killed the joy of the BAMBOOZLED
philosophy for me.</P>
<P>Great acting by Jada Pinkett-Smith, Michael Rappaport, and an
interesting turn by rapper Mos Def as Big Black Africa, could not
overcome Lee's lack of tight focus, the far-too-easy "instant"
acceptance of the minstrel show by the audience, the completely
incredulous "payoff" involving the MauMaus and Mantan (my eyes truly
rolled), or Wayans' just plain bad acting - and worse, the bad decision
to let him do the narrative voiceover.  The "jolly nigger"-type
collectibles, and the Black actors of the past who did what they had to
do - and having done so, *allowed* a Spike Lee, a Damon Wayans, et al,
to be where they are today - should have supplied the final narrative.
Too bad they weren't really allowed to Speak.</P>
<P>The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:</P>
<P>"We Are Not A Monolith".  It is my daily mantra.  And it applies oh so
well to BAMBOOZLED.  But what, exactly, does it mean?</P>
<P>It means that somewhere out there, there's a Harvard-educated,
stick-up-the-butt, "Negro"-labelling, confused DeLa; and a
status-seeking, hard-working, bougie, confused Sloane; and a
tap-dancing, fast-talking, struggling-to-get-by Manray and Womack; and a
malt liquor-drinking, gun-slinging, pseudo-revolutionary Julius.</P>
<P>And like it or not, they're ALL Black.  Which, of course, lays waste to
the one huge stereotype We seem to be portrayed as on the Idiot Box that
Pierre set out to feed.  If this, more so than the viewer's experience
of the acting itself, was The Ultimate Point of BAMBOOZLED, then bad
acting/directing/editing or not, BAMBOOZLED is indeed a Masterpiece.
One that, when all is said and done, should be seen, no matter your
color.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
BAMBOOZLED, conceptually, is something that Spike Lee should be
applauded for.  Would that the finished product were as great as the
concept behind it.  It pains me to say that; after all, I drove 88 miles
to The Hood just to see a movie that a lot of theater owners in
predominantly White neighborhoods were apparently too chicken to show. I
desperately wanted to love this movie for both its message and the
talent behind it.  The message came through loud and clear; but judging
BAMBOOZLED on its creative merits alone, we have been Hoodwinked.</P>
<P>BAMBOOZLED (mixed rating):
A greenlight rating for what visionary Spike Lee *tried* to Say; but...
...a cautionary yellowlight for the way director Spike Lee Said it.</P>
<P>Spike, I gotta go with what DeLa's mama said about him: you disappoint
me.</P>
