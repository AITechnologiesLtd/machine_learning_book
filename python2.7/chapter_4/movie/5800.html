<P>     It's the romantic buried inside each of us that responds to movies 
like EMMA.  Sure, the film, like the Jane Austen novel upon which it is 
based, is laced with wit and sophistication.  And, although it contains 
enough social commentary and character development to lift it well above 
the plane of genre romances, EMMA is still primarily about lovers 
finding each other during a simpler age (Austen published her novels in 
the early 19th century).</P>
<P>     With EMMA, we're certainly not investigating virgin territory.  In 
the wake of PERSUASION, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, and A&E's stupendous 
PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, there's not a great deal of mystery about the 
audience to which EMMA will appeal.  Although the plot differs slightly 
from the other Austen books-to-movies, many of the themes and riffs are 
the same.  More than one marriage is arranged (five, to be precise), the 
heroine is a strong-willed woman with a disdain for social conventions, 
the "principal" couple doesn't find love until the closing moments, and 
there's at least one scene of ballroom dancing.</P>
<P>     EMMA details the matchmaking attempts of twenty-one year old Emma 
Woodhouse (Gwyneth Paltrow), an incorrigible meddler who believes that 
"there is nothing more beautiful than a match well made."  After 
successfully marrying her governess (Greta Scacchi) to a widower (James 
Cosmo), Emma sets her sights on pairing her plain, uncultured friend, 
Harriet Smith (Toni Collette), with the local vicar, Reverend Elton 
(Alan Cumming).  Elton, however, has other ideas, as does Emma's closest 
male friend, Knightley (Jeremy Northam), who describes her activities as 
"vanity working on a weak mind [that] produces every kind of mischief."  
Emma herself is unattached, but, since this is a Jane Austen story, it's 
obvious that won't last for long.  Indeed, before the two hours are up, 
the title character has become enmeshed in a number of romantic 
entanglements, and it doesn't take a genius to uncover the identity of 
Emma's true soul-mate.</P>
<P>     It's possible that the storyline for EMMA may seem curiously 
familiar to movie-goers, even those who haven't seen the previous Austen 
adaptations.  The reason dates back to last year's CLUELESS.  Alicia 
Silverstone's star-making vehicle was a modern take on EMMA, translating 
the characters and circumstances from England in the early 1800s to 
Beverly Hills in the 1990s.  This straight adaptation works better, but 
CLUELESS is not without its charms.</P>
<P>     Speaking of star-making turns, EMMA is likely to open eyes to the 
talent of its leading lady, Gwyneth Paltrow, who gives face, form, and 
expression to Emma.  Paltrow, who was excellent in 1993's FLESH AND BONE 
(before moving on to films like SEVEN and THE PALLBEARER), displays the 
essential characteristic of an actress wishing to play a Jane Austen 
heroine -- the ability to shift quickly and effectively from comedy to 
drama.  She can cry, look wistful, and deliver a biting line with equal 
believability. </P>
<P>     Paltrow is supported by a fine cast.  Toni Collette (MURIEL'S 
WEDDING), who also appeared with her in THE PALLBEARER, makes an 
effectively frumpy Harriet Smith.  Jeremy Northam, who harassed Sandra 
Bullock in THE NET, is an excellent choice for the dashing Knightley.  
Alan Cumming is suitably smarmy as Reverend Elton.  Greta Scacchi and 
Polly Walker are underused in small roles.  Sophie Thompson, in her 
second Austen film (she also appeared in PERSUASION), plays the 
irritating Miss Bates a little too perfectly.  Only Ewan McGregor 
(TRAINSPOTTING) appears miscast, although he gives the part of Frank 
Churchill a game try.</P>
<P>     EMMA lacks the depth of passion present in the other Austen films, 
but, in large part because it's trying for something lighter and 
breezier, it's still fun.  The film runs a little longer than seems 
necessary, and gets off to a slow, fitful start (Douglas McGrath's 
screenplay is not the equal of the other Austen adaptations), but 
Paltrow keeps us interested until the story's inherent romantic magic 
begins to weave its spell.  </P>
<P>     Is the movie-going population (especially those who frequent art 
houses) growing weary of Jane Austen?  It's hard to give a definitive 
answer at this time, but, judging from the lines at the box office, that 
seems unlikely.  There's something about the writer's view of life that 
appeals to modern audiences, and, if EMMA proves to be a financial 
success, it's almost a certainty that we'll be seeing a new, feature 
adaptation of either NORTHANGER ABBEY or MANSFIELD PARK in the near 
future.</P>
