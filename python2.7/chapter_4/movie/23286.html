<P>   I'm a lifelong New Yorker, but only by the force of
circumstance.  Oh, New York is a fine place to spend your
life, probably the world's most exciting city.  But I had other
things in mind, at least from the time I began college studies
in a small Massachusetts town.  The campus looked exquisite
in the winter, and just outside, the sidewalks featured traffic
lights that pedestrians could actually control by pushing a
button.  Many of the teachers lived on a long, winding street
called Professors' Row: this is where I would spend my
career, pipe in mouth, leather patches on my sleeve, a
golden Labrador Retriever to put me through my paces when
I wasn't counseling students or grading papers or attending
the many parties thrown by the deans and by colleagues. 
This was not to be, however, but now, decades later as I
observe Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas) on the screen in
virtually every scene for nearly two hours I realize that the
pleasures and sorrows of life are not geographical but within. 
As sketched in a shaggy-dog novel by Michael Chabon,
adapted for the screen by Steve Kloves and directed by 
Curtis Hanson ("L.A. Confidential"), Tripp is the college
instructor who (for all we know) I could have become.  Not
the guy who is absolutely at ease with himself and his calling
but one who gets himself into situations that evoke both
humor and pathos, Tripp is a 50-ish guide to students in his
advanced writing seminar whose mid-life crisis comes to a
head on one agitated, winter weekend in Pittsburgh.</P>
<P>   Tripp is observed in Chabon's reasonably short novel with
dry humor and sly wit as a man who--like so many other
writers (Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee, Arthur Miller,
Norman Mailer)--is going downhill, though in his case his
decline is not only a professional one.  Having scored an
award from PEN just seven years earlier, he has not
published another work.  As he is on the 2,000th-odd page of
a humongous piece of fiction, another scribe on campus
nicknamed Q (Rip Torn) has knocked out yet another book,
as he has been doing regularly every 18 months.  Why the
writer's block?  Something is happening psychologically to
trip him up.  He has regular fits, sometimes even falling on
the floor in a faint.  Marijuana is his crutch and when he pops
codeine pills after being bitten around the ankle by a big blind
dog, we suspect he uses them for other than medicinal
purposes as well.  </P>
<P>   Hanson's film is not about the profession of writing,
however, but about the relationships of a wonder boy, a guy
who will prove that you're never too old to grow up.  His
epiphanies occur during a week that publishers are on
campus to look at and perhaps buy some of the output of
both faculty and students and, in fact, Tripp's own publisher,
Terry Crabtree (Robert Downey Jr.) has joined him and has
also met with a suicidal, compulsive liar who is in Tripp's
class.  The depressive student, James Teer, is played with
awesome veracity by the highly talented Tobey Maguire ("The
Cider House Rules"), this time as a young man who is the
professor's most promising student and as the publisher's
promising sexual attachment for the weekend.</P>
<P>   "Wonder Boys," takes place during the time that its
principal character is in a funk because his wife had just left
him, a student with a crush (Hannah, played by Katie
Holmes) is coming on to him, and he is looking to strengthen
his bond with his mistress, Sara (Frances McDormand), who
is the chancellor and the wife of the English chairman. 
Events which are to shake him out of his long-term funk
occur in just a few days: 1) Young James has shot the
English chairman's blind dog, allegedly to defend the
professor who has been attacked by the big hound; 2) Sara
has announced that she is pregnant from Tripp and is
determined to make a decision about the baby within her; 3)
James has stolen Marilyn Monroe's coat, which she had worn
to her wedding with Joe D.  </P>
<P>  Some incidents are wacky, some are serious.  The movie's
most notable attribute is its pacing.  Curtis Hanson, known for
his ability to move around a multiplicity of characters in his
"L.A. Confidential," refuses to appeal to a potentially broad
audience.  He keeps the plot moving along at his own
lingering velocity, thereby avoiding making a Buston-Keaton
style picture out of the zaniness.  He hints at a possible affair
between student Hannah and Tripp but keeps the two apart
throughout.  He has us wondering how Tripp's affiliation with
Sara will turn out, given the humorlessness of Sara's
husband who is Tripp's overseer.  </P>
<P>   All this is commendable.  Unfortunately what should have
been a story well told to an appreciative audience of indie-
lovers who also adore their indies to be framed with a
commercial-sized budget is simply murky, torpid, and
confused.  The chemistry between the chancellor and the
professor is missing: we miss any feeling that something is at
stake.  Tripp's life has been on hold for so long that he
appears to have lost real desire to make changes, to do
something for himself that could alter his listlessness.  Yet
the film is cast with awe-inspiring faculty.  Douglas, wonderful
as the overly calm executive in "The Game" who is
challenged by life-threatening risk; super as a the high-
powered broker in "Wall Street" who knows that greed is
good; is simply majestic this time in his first role with real
comedic undertones.  With long hair, scruffy beard, and
overbearing glasses, he meanders through his role with
absolute sincerity.  He is a man with whom many others his
age could identify. Tobey Maguire is the metaphoric young
and bright depressive whose stories might make others in his
class want to kill themselves and he too engages in activities
on that fateful weekend that might make genuine corrections
in his life.  Robert Downey Jr. saves an otherwise
lackadaisical film with his unique brand of wily, comic acting
in a film that looks more like an notion than a well thought-out
comedy-drama.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 112 minutes.  (C) 2000
