<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
4 stars</P>
<P>It is always a good sign that a thriller is working when you start to
believe that anything happening on the screen is something that could
happen to you.  Achieving this much is not an easy task for anyone, so
you can imagine my surprise when Tony "Top Gun" Scott, Will Smith and a
writer with only one previous film under his belt managed to pull it
off.  Not only that, but they've also done a darn good job.  Scott's
tense direction of David Marconi's paranoid and upbeat screenplay gives
the film structure, whilst a bunch of strong performances from a
talented cast give it character.</P>
<P>In fact, I found it amazing that Scott was able to make his three lead
actors - Will Smith, Gene Hackman and Jon Voight - work so well.  Smith
tackles an out of character "serious" role and finds stable ground as
the film's anchor.  Although Hackman is rarely powerful, his work in
Enemy of the State is not to be underestimated.  And as for Jon Voight,
he is finally back to the standard he set in Mission Impossible, once
again reprising his role as everybody's least popular character (the
smug villain).</P>
<P>A mob goon gives Robert Clayton Dean (Will Smith) a tricky choice: fork
over some valuable information or get killed before the week's end.  You
can understand why this threat soon becomes the least of Dean's worries
after he finds himself unwittingly involved in something a little more
serious - a national conspiracy involving the work of shady NSA
(National Security Association) bureaucrat Thomas Reynolds (Jon Voight).
Reynolds is not your typical bad guy as he has a team of computer geeks
ready to do his dirty work for him, using the latest in computer
technology to hunt down and monitor anybody they please.  Everything
soon gets a little too much for Dean, as he begins to lose his loved
ones and eventually gets framed for murder.  Luckily for him, he
stumbles across a technological expert known as "Brill" (Gene Hackman),
and they eventually form an unlikely friendship as they try to escape
the inevitable showdown with Reynolds.</P>
<P>No doubt this is Brian De Palma and David Fincher territory.  Although
Scott can't find as much intrigue or suspense with his material as
Fincher did in The Game, he packs a lot of excitement into action
sequences.  There are two lengthy chase scenes that hold viewers'
attention for so long that watching them becomes uncomfortable.  The
first of these scenes sets a high standard for the rest of the film, and
features Chasing Amy's Jason Lee on the run from NSA goons.
Cinematographer Daniel Mindel captures the intensity of these moments
with deliberately computerized visuals.  When the "satellite cam" is
activated, he gives a refreshing new view of what is going on, and
reminds us of how big the characters are in comparison to the massive
modern world surrounding them.</P>
<P>With a running time of 140 minutes, it must be said that Enemy of the
State is not a good example of efficiency.  Will Smith's character is
casually developed for quite a lengthy amount of time before he finds
himself in extraordinary situations.  That is an interesting choice,
because many directors prefer to develop their characters when they are
placed outside of their comfortable environs (like in 1997's very clever
Breakdown, and Oliver Stone's U-Turn).  However Smith works well and so
does his character, and even cynics have to admire the way he has
successfully ditched his trademark supporting characters - aliens and
motor-mouth cops (at least for the time being).  In the transformation,
Smith has lost none of his charm, and now gives authenticity to his
presence.</P>
<P>If I could edit out any part of Enemy of the State, I'd get rid of its
prologue.  In this dreary opening scene, we are shown exactly what the
NSA will go to all lengths to protect.  Had Tony Scott revealed it to us
bit by bit, Enemy of the State might have become just that little bit
more clever.</P>
<P>But cleverness really isn't a problem when you take into account all
that Enemy of the State achieves.  Faults in the story and exaggerated
scenarios can be excused, since this film accomplishes the difficult
task of yielding an atmospheric, paranoid and thrilling version of our
modern world.  And even more impressive than that, Tony Scott makes
every inch of it believable.</P>
