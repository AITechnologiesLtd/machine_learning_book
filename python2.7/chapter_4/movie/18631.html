<P>In Steven Spielberg's newest film, he demonstrates what the word war
really means. Utter, complete hell. And then he pits us there, right in
the middle of the most realistic battle scene ever experienced on
screen.</P>
<P>That scene is the landing on Omaha Beach, which starts off Saving
Private Ryan and then doesn't end for a painful and unquestionably
brutal 25 minutes into the movie. The deaths are not quick and painless
like in other war movies. Men have their limbs blown off left and right,
blood splatters in every direction, young soldiers lay on the ground
holding their own guts screaming for their "mommy", all of which sends
shivers down your spine.
Spielberg's three hour WWII epic is a masterful achievement that ranks
easily as one of the best movies of the year. But that doesn't mean it's
perfect. There are some moments when you feel the final impact should
have been more dramatically satisfying. But still, after two films (The
Lost World and Amistad) that I thought weren't up to Spielberg's average
quota, this one will set him back on track.</P>
<P>The Private Ryan of the title is one of four brothers fighting in World
War II. After the other three are killed in battle, a squad is sent out
to recover the remaining Ryan (played by Matt Damon) and bring him back
safely to his family. Leading the platoon is shaky captain Miller (Tom
Hanks, wonderful), and a loyal soldier who always sticks by his side
(the surprisingly commanding Tom Sizemore). Jeremy Davies plays a
frightened translator to such a stunning effect for a rookie player, and
the young cast shows they are capable of the most grating of tasks: to
hold their own in a Spielberg movie.</P>
<P>When the squad finally finds Ryan, 2/3 of the way into this three-hour
film, he turns out to be a stubborn yet likeable lad who doesn't want to
leave his platoon behind. This means Hanks and his team must stay to
defend one of the last remaining bridges from incoming Nazi's, in a
final sequence that is one of the most incredible scenes I've ever
witnessed on screen. The editing is marvelous, done to near perfection,
and once the smoke clears the final impact of the amazing battle will
stay with you long after you exit the theater.</P>
<P>Saving Private Ryan is one of the best war films of our time, standing
strong next to Glory and Platoon. When Steven Spielberg has a vision, it
usually seems to work out. Unlike his mindless rampaging dino movie of
1997, this is a true vision. And it seemed to work out just fine.</P>
