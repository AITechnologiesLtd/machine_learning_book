<PRE>                         KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN
                       A film review by Ralph Benner
                        Copyright 1996 Ralph Benner</PRE>
<P>                 Reading Manuel Puig's KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN, I kept
having this nagging doubt: Is Molina, the self-described homosexual window
dresser imprisoned in Buenos Aires for corrupting minors, a real
homosexual or a candidate for a transsexual operation? The question
actually comes so easily as to wonder why all the people who love the
novel and the movie -- with William Hurt as heroine Molina -- aren't
asking it themselves. Puig's book is, of course, stacked against Molina in
such an obvious way -- eight lengthy footnotes are included, explaining
away homosexuality by the likes of Freud, Anna Freud, Lang, D.J. West,
Marcuse -- that how could it be possible to interpret Molina as anything
else? That's what's fraudulent about the book: It provides these archaic
references -- almost as a collective apologia -- about a character that
simply isn't there. Closer to the disguised truth, the novel is
unwittingly ahead of its time while the novelist is not. The tip-off that
we're dealing with someone more than just an old queen comes less than
twenty pages into the book: Molina says, "Since a woman's the best there
is...I want to be one." If a post-adolescent said this to entice and
shock, we'd accept it as part of the process of being an emerging gay --
acting out the vernacular one hopes he'll soon discard. But Molina is no
chicken; he's middle-aged and adamant. Making a clear separation between
himself and faggots, he says, "As for my friends and myself, we're a
hundred percent female. We don't go in for those little games because
that's strictly for homos. We're normal women; we sleep with men." As
shaky as transsexuality may be on physical and psychological grounds, one
of the essential criteria for candidacy as a transsexual is just what
Molina feels: he doesn't consider himself a man, and much less a
homosexual. It's a sad craziness that he calls himself a faggot and
engages in homosexual behavior, but doesn't feel homosexual; in fact, he
hates homosexuals. And never once does Molina betray his inner-most
feelings; you sense that the character is more faithful to himself than
the guilt-soaked author is. Puig allows Molina his fantasy: being pumped
by a "real man" named Valentin (in the movie Raul Julia), a revolutionary
who battles the oppressive Argentine military rule (it's roughly 1976) and
who is jailed in the same cell. Puig extends the fantasy to the ultimate:
He explicitly has Molina state that, after having had his desires
fulfilled, he's ready to die -- and happily! This makes for fermented 40s
melodrama and by no means an accident, but as mechanism and message, it's
nonsense. First of all, as plot device, Puig has already put Molina in
prison for having sex with a minor before the story starts. Except to tell
Valentin why he's been jailed, Molina never speaks about it, we never get
to "see" the minor so that we can judge for ourselves what is meant by
minor, and, most telling, just what would a "one hundred percent female"
be doing with a boy anyway? Secondly, given that Puig is unmistakably
writing more a sexualized polemic than movie-inspired escapism -- had it
been escapist reading, or strictly a compassionate plea for tolerance of
differences, it would likely not have been banned in Argentina -- the
novel's unwitting harbinger to the political Homocaust, and the movie
explicit exemplification. That spider weaving its fateful web for Molina
is the trap of hopelessness -- and who the hell could ever die happily
with that kind of resolution? </P>
<P>        The late Puig, who answered the perpetual question "Are you gay?"
with "I'm a person," shows a detached sympathy for Molina that isn't
dishonest, exactly, but it suggests the psychologically wormy: Puig, like
many Latin homosexuals, might have been trying to kill what's inside him,
while at the same time revelling in and giving one's self over to gay
melodrama, flaunting contradiction as self-preservation. What's dishonest
is that he sets Molina up to be what's not really in his own head -- a
silly old queen -- and then strips him of his affectations at the end,
turning a 40s heroine into a modern hero, a startling role reversal that
may have worked had he been a flaming sissy who wanted to be a manly gay.
(Which seemed to be the rage during the Jeep & Jeans 80s.) But how can
this be when Molina wants desperately to be a woman? One f... and he's a
butch martyr? The novel isn't persuasively analytical to the degree and
intent Puig rather desperately aims for, unless the reader accepts all the
footnoted psychobabble. And if a reader does, how can he reconcile it to
the character? Though there's a ton of detail designer chat from Molina,
it's all in reference to the lullabies he dreams up to pass the time while
in jail; the info, voluminous and amusing, basically tells us nothing.
KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN really isn't a novel at all -- it's a
full-of-holes screenplay in search of actors who have to fill in what's
missing. </P>
<P>        Feeling trapped as something you're not and living in a place
where much of what makes life worth living is not freely available is a
fairly accurate way to describe the vibes of Buenos Aires. The city is
said to be the most European-looking in all of Latin America, and I think
a travel agent friend hit it on the head when he cracked, "It's Vienna on
a bad day." You're seized immediately not just by the derivative music,
architecture and transportation or lifestyle, mannerism and dress but also
by the heavy moldiness: the dark wood paneling, oversized furniture, dank
draperies and yellowed lace dollies are so omnipresent and oppressive that
you want to hit an exit almost as soon as you enter interiors of
restaurants, hotels, government buildings, stores. (And that there could
ever be a miniature Harrod's says much about the yearning of Argentines to
be something other than what they are.) Even Buenos Aires's manicured
boulevards seem to cut off your oxygen supply, and this may explain why
the cemeteries -- and especially the one in which Eva Peron is said to be
buried in -- are the city's most interesting tourist sights. (You don't
feel fresh-air constricted in Vienna.) Though everything and everyone
looks securely built, you somehow don't trust, you hesitate because you
sense the atmosphere of all pervasive insecurity -- psycho Gothic, like
the tombs. These faked Europeans myopically rush -- and I mean rush, even
faster than New Yorkers -- to wherever it is they go. This rush doesn't
only typify impersonal big city living, it also a permeation of the
dreaded historical Latin American inevitability: that, sooner or later,
the military takes over. If the tango is the national symbol of sexual
dramaturgy, it can also represent the deeply-rooted cult of fascism:
Peron, his Eva are felt in such strong, intangible ways that the tragedy
of Argentina having no recorded moral history is strengthened. While
leathers, sweaters and beef are Argentina's most prized exports, the
arched, slick dance of priggish ritual is the metaphor for a nation
unwilling to import honesty. In conversations with city dwellers, no one
wants to remember the "killing fields" past; their dour, swarthy faces
retrograde into paranoia at any discussion of the tactics of past regimes.
This is what makes APARTMENT ZERO, a perfect companion piece to KISS OF
THE SPIDER WOMAN, particularly unsettling because it gets closer to
verity: when the central character struggles to do the right thing but
instead succumbs to murder and porno, he becomes the symbol of a willfully
sick nationalism.</P>
<P>        A few too many nincompoop critics and moviegoers missed completely
the meaning behind the elaborate fictitious movie Molina describes to
Valentin. This special lullaby is entitled "Her Real Glory," ostensibly
Nazi propaganda about the Germans occupying France and how one dimwit,
rich-hating French chanteuse falls in love with a Nazi officer after he
shows her movies about how world hunger and depression have been caused by
the Jews. (Reminiscent of Hitchcock's WWII propaganda shorts, recently
released on home video.) Can it really be possible for people not to see
that Puig's mocking Eva Peron and her fascist husband Juan? Eva was a
third rate actress when she married Peron, an army colonel, in 1945. Eva
became the living icon for the poor of Argentina -- she had a passionate
hatred for the rich (though that didn't stop her from living lavishly) --
and not too unlike Leni in "Her Real Glory," died the death of a heroine.
(Eva expired from cancer in 1952.) Not even our best movie critic caught
Puig's clever subversion -- but Argentina did and banned the book. It
didn't help Puig any that a previous book of his, about Peron, THE BUENOS
AIRES AFFAIR, was laughably censored: any overt reference to Peron was
left blank. Puig is condemning what is a grievous lack of critical
Argentine biography, of truthful historical introspection. Whatever
happens to Molina and Valentin, representing as lullaby the vast numbers
of oppressed and forgotten, nothing will come of it, no record will be
made of it. When Molina's body is dumped in garbage, who will know of it?
Probably not even his mother.</P>
<P>        Because of the raging politics of the Homocaust at the time, every
major American movie company passed on filming the novel, despite the fact
-- or maybe because -- director Hector Babenco, who did the 1981 stunning
Brazilian muckraker PIXOTE, wanted Burt Lancaster as Valentin and Richard
Gere as Molina. Refusing to give up, Babenco asked Raul Julia, who agreed
and suggested what otherwise would seem like an impossibility: William
Hurt as Molina. Begging for every dollar, deferring salaries against
future profits, they headed to Sao Paulo to film, only to be met by more
resistance. Members of the Brazilian film industry kicked up quite a fuss
because Babenco was neither filming in Portuguese nor using Brazilian
actors for the two leads. Then there was the political consideration which
foolishly demanded that the prison in KISS originally set in Buenos Aires,
be changed to a nameless South American city in order to reduce potential
alienation of the now-civilian government of Argentina, as well as to
avoid endangering potential grosses from the massive Argentine movie-going
public. As if these handicaps weren't enough, Babenco had never made a
movie in English. But he knows the terrain of crud: as with PIXOTE with
its barf-inducing horrors of juvenile dormitories and toilets, he brings
to KISS the decaying textures of grime and slime of cell walls and when
one of the character's suffers from diarrhea, he approaches
Smell-o-Vision. He's a master at shocking sex scenes, taking Pixote's
Oedipal suckling and Molina & Valentin's anal intercourse and makes them
deeply haunting, almost lyrical.  (He was equally prodigious at squalor in
IRONWEED, though more as a cold, Depression muralist: keeping us at a
distance, that movie is like a month of Saturday nights with candidates
for A.A.)</P>
<P>        Something else works for Babenco -- his clarity in showing that
hypocrisy knows no rationale. It's this element that helps make PIXOTE the
most powerful docudrama of its kind; it shoved an updated, more
frightening kind of Pharisaism at us, one every major city is now dealing
with -- throwaway kids. Through subversion and subterfuge, KISS has
principals using and discarding each other, only it's never quite so
explicit as in PIXOTE. Molina's homosexuality is used by the prison and
government officials in order to get Valentin to open up about his
underground organization and activities; Molina is using his sexuality as
a tool to get out of prison; Valentin is using Molina's vulnerability --
knowing Molina wants the love of a "real man" -- in order to get a message
to his compatriots; and, finally, the homosexual issue is used to make a
statement about the worth of people different from the norm. It's obvious
that Babenco uses Molina as a warning about God Squad Fascism, and in the
process just about usurps Puig's caution against Argentina's more
traditional brand of it. Babenco narrows the warning and updates it:
Molina gets it because he's "a f...ing fag." The novel isn't as overt as
that, but what it does say I didn't believe -- that he's somehow a hero
now that he's been good and screwed. As I see it, Molina sacrifices
himself because every fiber of his being said he was a woman but trapped
in a man's body. </P>
<P>        Unfortunately the majority of moviegoers who view KISS haven't
seen PIXOTE, which has a character named Lilica, who's around 17 and is a
swish, and who probably is by now a drag queen. (If he hasn't been cut
short by AIDS.) Watching William Hurt as Molina, I thought, It's Lilica
all over again, but this time it's not for real. And I mean that literally
because the actor playing Lilica is gay, while of course Hurt isn't. This
bothered some of the nincompoops: Richard Corliss, for example, cries that
Hurt "does not have one queenly bone in his body. It's not just that he's
playing a homosexual; he's playing a raging queen. And he doesn't have the
voice for it, he doesn't have the gestures for it. It's a terrible piece
of miscasting." Corliss conveniently forgets the glories of acting -- he
doesn't want to see our better actors take risks. What he seems to want is
for Michael Greer to reprise his performance from THE GAY DECEIVERS or
Zorro David to pull another Anacleto from REFLECTIONS IN A GOLDEN EYE. Is
Richard Burton to be condemned in STAIRCASE because he didn't have a
"queenly bone in his body"? Because of FRAIDS, there are many who don't
want to see a raging queen in a movie, though MTV has given Rupaul the
chance to broaden his audience in a way the late Divine only got from John
Waters. I would argue that right now only a straight actor without a gay
bone in his body could play a raging swish. Of course the audience is more
comfortable with a Dustin Hoffman in TOOTSIE, or a Robert Preston in
VICTOR/VICTORIA or, most recently, Robin Williams as MRS. DOUBTFIRE --
because the audience knows they're not turning serious on us; in other
words, they're safe. Or safe in the way Peter Finch's homosexual doctor
was in SUNDAY, BLOODY SUNDAY or Tom Hanks in PHILADELPHIA. Maybe what they
are carping about it that Hurt at times goes too far, moving beyond their
own personal comfort levels. Said Puig: "You won't recognize him in this
film -- he's totally changed. A real transformation. He plays Molina with
red hair, flowing gowns. Very risky." Indeed. And it's this daring, this
true gutsiness, that I most admire in his work here. </P>
<P>        Surprisingly, Raul Julia holds his own against Hurt, which must
have been quite a challenge: watching and having to respond to Hurt's
tricks might have tempted a co-star to just hand the picture over to him.
Julia doesn't; he thwarts Hurt a bit, and when Julia's character is
rightly perplexed by Molina, frustrated by his steadfast belief that
fantasy is better than reality, the confusion and irritation are terrific
balances; we can truly feel his exasperation. And, unlike our willful
suspension of Hurt's obvious lack of ethnicity, Julia looks the part, and
performs the infamous Latin sexual ambivalence with astonishing assurance.</P>
<P>        KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN fascinates more for what's not on the
screen or the pages than for what's on them. The relationship between
Molina and Valentin is bogus -- a self-destructive misfit's fantasy -- but
it might have been meaningful, funny, ironic had just once either of them
had said or hinted that Molina, after getting out of prison, should get
himself an appointment with a sex change specialist. It would then have
given him something, a real hope, to be happy about, instead of becoming a
victim of the very spiders he conspired with. Romantically sacrificing
yourself to your own self-hatred isn't very heroic if what you hate really
isn't what you are.     </P>
