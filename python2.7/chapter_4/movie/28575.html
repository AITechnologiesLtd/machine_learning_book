<PRE>THE DEEP END
A film review by Christopher Null
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Welcome to beautiful Lake Tahoe, where a boy can still get his mom to
cover up a murder and be home in time for supper.</P>
<P>A heavy drama, The Deep End is just such a tale.  When teenaged Beau
(Jonathan Tucker) gets mixed up with a seedy, older man (he's secretly
gay), their relationship gets a bit too intense and the lech ends up
dead.  Imagine her surprise when mom Margaret (Tilda Swinton) stumbles
upon a corpse on her idyllic beach!  Of course, she does what any mother
of an aspiring musical virtuoso would do -- sinks the body in the lake,
hides the guy's car, and pretends nothing has happened.</P>
<P>Before long, the body is discovered, and the film takes a turn toward a
blackmail plot, courtesy of ER nice guy Goran Visnjic.  Ultimately this
is a film about desperate measures -- a test of how far maternal
instinct can take a person.  Too bad the execution of that concept isn't
as assured.</P>
<P>It's a movie you never saw (and you were lucky), but Before and After
went down this road (unmemorably, I should add) a few years ago, only
there it was the father willing to cover up the crime.  That was a movie
with Meryl Streep and Liam Neeson, and even they couldn't pull this plot
off, getting oh-so-serious with the moral dilemma and forgetting that
there were people looking to the screen for entertainment.</P>
<P>The Deep End learns nothing from that lesson.  Moving slowly and
deliberately, the film finally comes to a boil after about 90 minutes,
but I fear much of the audience will be lost by then.  Instead of trying
to surprise or dazzle us, the film plays coy, throwing one perplexing
plot twist after another such that we are left with surprisingly little
explanation for anything we've seen along the way.</P>
<P>It's all vaguely unsatisfying because it's just never believable.  For
starters, we don't believe that Margaret or her son would never be
caught -- or even suspected -- for the crime.  And when Margaret finally
and tearfully tells us what really happened that night, we don't believe
it then, either.  The truth, as she tells it, doesn't even seem
possible.  Combined with the worst fake-trumpet-playing footage put to
film, the whole affair just comes off as phony, a gimmick that might
have worked on serialized radio in the 1930's but not on the big screen
today (oddly enough, the film is based on an old serialized novel called
The Blank Wall).</P>
<P>Fortunately, The Deep End is a lovely film to look at, well photographed
and populated with universally interesting, nuanced, and surprisingly
rich characters.  That only takes you so far, of course; it's also worth
noting that the sound design and film editing are amateurishly bad.</P>
<P>As its centerpiece, Swinton owns the film as she so often does, her very
spare facial features a mask upon which every emotion under the sun is
projected.  Would that those emotions made a little more sense in the
context of the plot.</P>
