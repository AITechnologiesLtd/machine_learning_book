<P>   "Hitler never looked at another woman after Eva Braun.
Does that make him any better than Jefferson, Roosevelt and
Kennedy?"  While this quote by a member of the presidential
campaign team seems to signal that "Primary Colors" is pro-
Clinton, the big question which viewers will toy with in their
post-screening discussion with one another is whether this
high-profile picture is balanced, favoring the president, or
designed to smirch his reputation.  Without question,
Governor Jack Stanton (John Travolta) is a stand-in for Mr.
Clinton: every scene in this exploration of his primary election
campaign evokes the pungency of Clinton's struggle for the
top office and the difficulties he faced when confronted with
charges of womanizing.  Given the fact that Mike Nichols,
who directed the work and who teams up with long-time
collaborator Elaine May (who wrote the script based on
journalist Joe Klein's novel of the same name), has always
been considered a Clinton supporter, we wonder how he is
able to smudge the former southern governor's reputation as
much as he does.  </P>
<P>   "Primary Colors" will disappoint those whose exposure to
political film runs exclusively to stories like "The Day of the
Jackal," "The Candidate," "Dave," and any previous offering
that offers either comic sketches or paranoid portraits of the
man in the Oval Office.  Its 140 minutes are devoted to a
careful inquiry into the nature of politics and shows more than
any other film to date all that must go into a primary battle--
the heartaches, the exposure of one's private life, the
disappointments, the betrayals.  This makes for involving
storytelling for a targeted audience of educated people willing
to listen careful to some precious dialogue and draw
conclusions on subtle points of interpretation.  It shows the
current president, who is here given the name of Jack
Stanton, has good features and flaws like anyone lower than
the saints, and one emerges with a new respect for a guy
who was chief executive of a relatively backwater state,
largely unknown to all but political mavens.  </P>
<P>   Looking and sounding so much like Bill Clinton that one can
almost swear that he is seeing the chief executive himself,
John Travolta turns in a dramatic albeit understated portrait of
a winner who really does listen to the voice of the working
class, who is a touch-feely person who thoroughly enjoys
physical contact of all kinds, and who despite some
exaggerated gestures of sympathy with those who are down
on their luck has a genuine compassion for ordinary people. 
The story begins with efforts by the Stanton campaign people
to draft Henry Burton (Adrian Lester) into the crusade,
knowing that this eloquent, charismatic African-American--who
is also the grandson of a great civil rights leader--could do
marvelous things for the candidate's image.  Unsure whether
he wants to accept the prestigious position, Burton decides to
observe the man at work and is taken in by Stanton's
empathy with the hapless students at an adult literacy center,
where he tells the gathering a largely phony story of how his
Uncle Charlie won the Medal of Honor but declined an
impressive job offer because he was ashamed to admit his
illiteracy.  We are quickly introduced to other members of the
staff, including Richard Jemmons (Billy Bob Thornton), who is
the James Carville stand-in, the articulate Daisy, who
schedules the appointments, and the "dust-buster" Libby
(Kathy Bates), a dynamo lesbian given the mandate of finding
dirt on Stanton's opponent.</P>
<P>   So much of the film comes out of recent newspaper
headlines that the movie becomes too predictable in spots, as
when a blond bimbette shows up on national TV to play a
tape implicating the candidate in an affair.  In a bizarre
development, a simple black man who had been a friend of
Stanton accuses his pal of getting the man's daughter
pregnant.  </P>
<P>   A central moral issue raised by the movie is whether it is
ethical or even wise to run a negative campaign.  Some, like
Libby, say whether it would benefit Stanton or not, the
candidate should avoid attacking his opponent's personal life. 
(When Stanton follows the advice and assails his competitor's
stand strictly on the issue of social security, his popularity
ostensibly rises.)  The only scene which calls for a leap of
audience credibility deals with Libby's fate, an unusual
outcome particularly considering the outspoken woman's
apparent thick skin.  Kathy Bates steals the show with a
remarkable performance, one that goes over the top when her
character points a loaded gun at the genitals of a sleazeball
who engineered a doctored tape on a national TV interview
program.</P>
<P>   Adrian Lester as Henry Burton, Stanton's most important
liaison with the public, remains the center of this epic film, a
man whose ambiguousness toward the governor mirrors the
equivocal feelings of large segments of the American public
about President Clinton.  Emma Thompson shows that an
English actress can easily assume the role of an ambitious,
smart American First Lady, and fine performances are turned
in by the ensemble of strategists and adversaries including
Paul Guilfoyle (who brings Burton on board), and Larry
Hagman as Stanton's ultimate opponent, a man who seems
without a single flaw but whose major blemish is discovered
and ethically exploited.  Rated R.  Running time: 140 minutes.
