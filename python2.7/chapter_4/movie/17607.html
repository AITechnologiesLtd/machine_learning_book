<PRE>THE BIG PARADE (1986)</PRE>
<P>"Only good men are fit to be soldiers."</P>
<PRE>3 out of ****</PRE>
<P>Starring Huang Xueqi, Lu Lei, Wu Ruofu, Guan Kiang, Kang Hua, Sun Chun;
Directed by Chen Kaige;
Written by Gao Lili;
Cinematography by Zhang Yimou</P>
<P>        THE BIG PARADE is a fine movie by a great director, tainted by an
irony too bitter to stomach.  It is a celebration of the Communist spirit,
focusing not so much on the ideology--although it is ever-present--but
rather on the appeal of solidarity.  It shows us, convincingly, how people
are ennobled when they go the extra distance for the sake of a common
purpose.  Unfortunately, the individuals are soldiers, and the celebration,
the eponymous parade, takes place in Tiananmen Square--the site, of course,
of one of the Chinese government's most infamous acts.</P>
<P>        The film closes with rousing images--row after row of marching
soldiers, strutting proud across the Square, below a banner bearing the
stern fatherly countenance of Chairman Mao--but these images recall other
images, snapshots of the massacre: a white-shirted protestor standing his
ground before an advancing column of tanks; a hysterical blood-spattered
student confronting the impassive mien of a People's Liberation Army
soldier.  THE BIG PARADE perhaps intends to bring to mind notions of
"heavenly peace," but becomes, through the lens of history, an unwitting
mockery of those notions.</P>
<P>        That said, it is by no means an unworthy film, when taken out of
context.  It does not, however, compare with Chen Kaige's best work, and I
imagine he now views it with misgivings, given the disillusionment with
Communism manifest in his other work.  THE BIG PARADE chronicles the
preparations of a squad of soldiers prior to the military display in
Tiananmen, which marks the 35th anniversary of the People's Republic
parade.  The parade is televised, and although the men will be on TV for
mere minutes, they devote the preceding weeks to intense training.  During
those mere minutes, a nation will be watching, and they want to show that
nation that it can feel proud of itself.</P>
<P>        On the basis of THE BIG PARADE, the nation should feel proud: these
are fine people. We follow a half-dozen men through the film, and each must
face a personal crisis; a bow-legged soldier strives to overcome his
deficiency, a young soldier's mother dies and he must return home.  These
incidents evolve smoothly, without contrivance; Chen has a penchant for
melodrama, but here chooses understatement, nicely balancing the hyperbole
of the officers' military mindset.  The relationships among the men are
explored thoughtfully, with admirable tough-mindedness, and as the training
proceeds, some soldiers must be cut from the squadron.  The grace with
which those who are dismissed accept their failure is enviable.  There are
no villains here, only decent men, impelled by duty, pride, and brotherhood
to push themselves to the limit, and step down if their limit is
inadequate.  Were it not for real life, we might almost be convinced that,
as we are told, only good men are fit to be soldiers.</P>
<P>        The account of the training period includes several engrossing
set-pieces, the best of which, perhaps, is the depiction of an exercise
which has the squad standing at attention on a stretch of hot tarmac under
the blazing noonday sun, for two hours, with no shade.  Medics watch
intently as the soldiers sweat and strain, as legs buckle, and rush to tend
those who collapse, overcome by the heat.  Some, through teeth-grinding
willpower, remain upright for the whole two hours.  The entire gruelling
mesmerizing endeavour embodies some essential quality of human
stubbornness, as men endure the codified barbarism that passes for
"conditioning" in the army, for the sake of a parade which does not, except
as a matter of principle, require anything like this level of mental and
physical discipline.</P>
<P>        Chen and cinematographer Zhang Yimou embrace military iconography
with a zeal that is almost fetishistic.  From uniforms and set jaws,
precise ordered ranks, synchronized marching feet, they fabricate a vision
of solidarity that is urgent, seductive, striking.  Perhaps a convoluted
argument could be made that they somehow subvert these sub-fascist
displays, but when the sounds of the Shaanxi Philharmonic Orchestra swell
up over the rows of marching figures in the closing scenes, it is difficult
to find subversion, easy to find adulation.</P>
<P>        It may also be tempting, because it's easier, to see the film as
strictly an aesthetic artifact, to remove it from history, to ignore the
ideological issues that sully the serene waters of its surface.  But, like
Leni Riefenstahl's Nazi documentaries, the historical context is what THE
BIG PARADE is all about: it idealizes a particular set of beliefs at a
particular place and time, and those beliefs must be recognized for what
they are.  Indeed, many mainland Chinese films since THE BIG PARADE (or,
more to the point, since Tiananmen) are, in some sense, acts of
recognition, of response.  It is easier to understand, after seeing this
film, why it is almost redundant to call a Chinese movie tragic, for here
is a rarity, one that ends on a high note, on a moment of hope and
unity--and it is nothing but propaganda.</P>
