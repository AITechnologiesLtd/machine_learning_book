<P>I sat in the theater, watching The Truman Show, and I was entertained. It was
smart, very original, a bit thought provoking, sensible, smooth and fun. But
then, a scene..which caused me to sit forward, hands in front of my mouth, in
almost deer-in-headlights astonishment. Suddenly the slight incoherency of
the early parts of this movie made sense, it reminded me of looking at a
Monet..you look at it up close, and it looks nice, but when you step back,
and look at the big picture..the view is truly amazing. This is another
review that was a bit hard to write, not because I wasn't sure what to write,
or if I liked, or disliked it, but rather, I had..have so many thoughts
running through my head regarding this movie, that I could probably create my
own forum from it. It is that kind of movie..makes you tilt your head, like
that RCA dog. Unfortunately, trends have shown that summer movies tend to be
the cinematic equivalent of Chinese food, quickly filling, then forgotten.
However another one of my gauges for a good movie, is if you are talking
about after you leave the theater..does it get inside you, stay with you. The
last few movies to do that for me were Good Will Hunting, Sleepers, and my
favorite..(and still underrated and underappreciated)..Usual Suspects. I have
had so many thoughts regarding all of the different levels that this movie is
on, the in-jokes, the commentary, the emotion, the undertones..so much
happening here, that it very easily could've spun out of control. But Peter
Weir corralled his movie, just as he has Carrey's trademark manic antics, and
keeps the movie flowing evenly. Carrey is effective in his role, by far his
best yet (of course, that isn't really saying too much, kind of like trying
pick a GOOD piece of liver)..but he is good. He is not stifled however, Weir
obviously knows the talent of Carrey, and lets him loose, a few times, for
his comic nature. The difference in that this time, is that it looks natural,
for the first time in a Jim Carrey movie, I felt like I was seeing the real
him..not a character. He was funny, he was sensitive, emotional, running a
gamut of emotions, every one looking sincere. Ed Harris, playing the director
of the show, is magnificent as well (although, if I had to flaw the movie a
tiny bit..he wasn't on screen enough..but then again, when I look back at the
big picture, I can see why). Harris has always had that aura, of gentleness,
with a glint of a dark side hiding in those eyes. He is paternally spooky in
this role, almost seemingly torn between a fatherly bond to Truman, who he's
watched over since birth (a couple of scenes support this emotion)..but also,
he's pure Hollywood, scripting, planning, plotting, and controlling every act
of Truman's life, except Truman himself..then reacting to Truman's actions,
with a calm, controlling manner. As for the other performances, none really
stand out, because of the fact that they are actors, playing actors..and you
never see anything more than the character they are scripted to me. A slight
exception to this is newcomer Natascha McElhone, who plays an unplanned, real
love interest to Truman, but this situation, like every other crisis that
arises..is quickly explained away, and quelled. We see her as a real person
as well. This movie is both intriguing, and dark, funny, but not..and most
disturbing of all, real, and honest. This movie feeds on the public's
fascination with reality based media, showing us how a world reacts to
Truman, just being himself. This is a commentary on what the media has become
today, and what they could be in the future, another step towards an
Orwellian society..more to come probably..</P>
<P>Note to Paramount Marketing Department: One of my criticisms of this movie,
before I had seen it, rested with the studios campaign to market it as a
Carrey- esque comedy, when it is actually far from that..shame on Paramount.
Take a chance, give us some credit, and allow us to like the movie for what
it is..don't deceive the viewers, they line your pockets..be honest, as the
movie is. Do not lure the audience in on the precluse of seeing Ace 3, or
something..and then give them this, granted, there are a few people who will
be pleasantly surprised (example, as I was leaving the theater, someone
stated "That was not what I expected at all...I liked it!) and glad they were
drawn in by the deception, but ultimately, you will taint the films chances,
by not delivering what was expected. Granted, it is good to tease, and not
show all your cards..but there is a great difference between surprise, and
outright deception</P>
