<PRE>                             VEGAS VACATION
                       A film review by Paul Miller
                        Copyright 1997 Paul Miller</PRE>
<P>As we all might have expected, another of the "Vacation" movie has
arisen.  If you think, some of the best movies of the past few years
have been with Clark, Ellen, Rusty, and Audrey.  Of course we've all
seen Christmas Vacation, sure to bring laughs to everyone.  I was hoping
for a lot with Vegas Vacation...</P>
<P>At the beginning of the movie, Clark earns a bonus for making a food
preservative that keeps cookies fresh for years.  He wants to go to Las
Vegas in hopes of remarriaing his wife.  The family doesn't really take
to the idea, but nonetheless go anyway.</P>
<P>This is where the fun begins.  They meet up with Eddie (of course, Randy
Quaid) who is always funny and doesn't leave me down.  They have a
stripper daughter, but that really doesn't matter.  They catch snakes,
etc.</P>
<P>I liked Vegas Vacation, but expected more out of it.  The parts of
vulgarity and partial nudity that made the first three fun wasn't
apparent.  In fact, besides the Hoover "Damn" scence with was on the
trailer, there wasn't much else in the way of vulgarity.  I think they
ruined the movie somewhat by making it more "family-oriented".</P>
<P>Anyway, I liked the movie and would recommended it even though it COULD
have been much better.</P>
