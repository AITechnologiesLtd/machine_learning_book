<PRE>BULLY
A film review by Christopher Null
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Larry Clark -- who wrote and directed his first film, Kids, at the
tender age of 52 and in the process, broke the mold about what we should
expect from a movie about teenagers -- returns to familiar ground in
Bully, a striking and harrowing follow-up.</P>
<P>A slam-dunk natural subject for Clark, Bully follows the
based-on-reality story of Marty Puccio (Brad Renfro), who along with his
girlfriend Lisa (Rachel Miner) decides to brutally slay his "best
friend" Bobby (Nick Stahl) as payback for a lifetime of abuse.  Set in
the ultra-trashy nether regions of southern Florida -- and I mean
seriously, beyond-WWF trashy -- there's little to do but drive your car,
play video games, have sex, and beat the crap out of your friends.</P>
<P>Bobby's brutalities extend to everyone who crosses his path -- he
punches Marty in the face for driving poorly, he rapes Marty's
girlfriend Lisa, he rapes Lisa's friend Ali (Bijou Phillips), he pimps
Marty for cash at an amateur strip night, and he even interferes with
Marty's plan when he scams on chicks at the mini-mall.  Obsessed with
gay porn, Bobby is portrayed as deeply confused and probably a closet
homosexual, a psychotic without hope of recovery.  Even Bobby's clueless
father is oblivious to his son's actions; in fact, all the parents in
the film are ignorant to the actions of their children.  So of course,
as it is decided in a moment of almost careless discusssion, Bobby must
be killed.</P>
<P>Masterminded by Lisa, Bobby is driven out to the Everglades by seven
conspirators, stabbed repeatedly, and left as food for the crabs and
gators.  By the time we reach the inevitable aftermath, Clark's picture
has devastated us with its deft dissection of a tormented and hollow New
American Youth.</P>
<P>Laden with a striking amount of graphic, sweaty, and frequently brutal
teen sex, its stars covered with a disturbing number of scars and
bruises, Bully is as difficult to watch as Kids, and it is equally as
assured.  While the script is exquisite, its actors deserve the highest
lauding.  Renfro is extremely brave and confident in his role as the
confused whipping boy.  Miner (you may know her as the former Mrs.
Macauley Culkin) is equally valiant in a character that requires her to
be completely naked in alternating scenes.  But it is Clark's
uncompromised skewering of white bread Americana that makes Bully so
compelling.  Clark pulls no punches and never panders to the Moral
Majority; he simply makes his point, over and over again: This is what
your children think is acceptable behavior.  And he's right, because it
really happened.</P>
<P>Still, Clark will always be more a writer than a director in my eyes. 
His hand is often unsteady as he can't decide how to frame a scene; as a
result, some bits of Bully look rushed, others amateurish.  Most notably
this occurs with a long and dizzying spinning-camera shot that adds
nothing to the picture except, well, dizziness.</P>
<P>Regardless of the directing foibles, Bully gets my flat recommendation. 
It probably goes without saying, but this is one summer teen movie
that's probably not for the kids.</P>
