<P>Most people have never heard of Jack Elliott, and the few who have
probably don't know much about him.  An intriguing new documentary
called The Ballad of Ramblin' Jack does a fine job telling Elliott's
story to its viewers, but the person who learns the most about him is
the film's director – who just happens to be Ramblin' Jack's daughter.</P>
<P>Ramblin' Jack portrays Elliott as a disorganized, irresponsible man with
no parental skills.  Daughter/director Aiyana Elliott grew up with her
mom, while her dad was constantly on the road.  You might get the
impression that she's only making this film to finally spend some
quality time with her father, and parts of Ramblin' Jack play remarkably
similar to the scenes in Almost Famous where young William Miller tries
to get Stillwater's enigmatic guitarist Russell Hammond to sit down for
an interview.  Elliott is just as evasive, always finding something to
distract him from Aiyana's questions about the past.</P>
<P>In addition to being a neglectful dad, Elliott also happens to be a
living folk legend.  A protégé of Woody Guthrie, Elliott was an
extremely fast flat-picker who began performing in New York's Washington
Square Park and, ultimately, influenced the likes of Paul McCartney,
Mick Jagger and Bob Dylan.  In fact, Dylan was often criticized for
sounding too much like Elliott, and his early shows were billed as The
Son of Jack Elliott.</P>
<P>Elliott looks, sounds and acts like a tough, dusty cowboy who could herd
cattle in his sleep, so finding out that Elliott is the son of a Jewish
doctor from Brooklyn is kind of like realizing that the imported lager
you're drinking was bottled in New Jersey.  Born Elliott Adnopoz in
1931, Elliott never thought about following in his pop's footsteps,
instead falling in love with The Grand Ole Opry radio program.  When
Gene Autry's rodeo came to Madison Square Garden, Elliott found his true
calling.  He ran away from home at 16 to join a rodeo, where he learned
to play the guitar from a rodeo clown.</P>
<P>Finding limited success musically in the U.S., Elliott took off for
England – a country in the midst of a folk craze populated by marginally
talented `skiffle' bands.  Elliott's authentic brand of down-home folk
tunes from America's heartland took England by storm, and he sold out
shows and recorded several popular albums there.  Six years later,
Elliott came back to the States as somewhat of a mysterious legend. Fans
had heard his albums and knew that he was a close friend of Woody, but
they had never seen the cowboy in action.</P>
<P>Ramblin' Jack is really two films – one a straight documentary about a
crucial link in American folk music history, and the other a painfully
unflinching look at the dysfunctional relationship between a father and
his daughter.  As a result, the film runs a little long, and may quickly
lose the interest of viewers who aren't folk fans.  It's a very
interesting look at the life of a very interesting figure.</P>
<P>The film, which won awards at the Sundance and San Francisco Film
Festivals, is cobbled together from two years of recent footage from
Elliott's seemingly endless cross-country touring and vintage
performances from the ‘60s and ‘70s (including a 1969 appearance on the
Johnny Cash Show that took place two weeks before Aiyana was born), as
well as an incredibly impressive amount of home movie footage - not just
from Aiyana's youth, but Jack's, too.  There are also numerous
interviews with family members (including two ex-wives), friends and
folk icons like Pete Seeger, Arlo Guthrie and Kris Kristofferson.</P>
