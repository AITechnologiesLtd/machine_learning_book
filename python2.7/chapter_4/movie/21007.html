<P>   If Tolstoy were a moviegoer, he'd amend his introduction to
"Anna Karenina" by saying "Happy families are all alike: they
appear only on sitcoms.  Unhappy families are different: they
are depicted in serious films."  Just as romantic poetry goes
hand in hand with love unrequired, coming-of-age movies are
inspired by people who grew up in unhappy homes.  "Joe the
King" is yet another entry into the "400 Blows" sweepstakes,
the story of a poor kid from minimum-wage-earning, uncaring
parents who, because of his background, is persecuted as
well by his teacher and his job supervisor while he is
unwittingly sent up the river by a well-meaning guidance
counselor.</P>
<P>   Frank Whaley, known principally as an actor ("Swimming
with Sharks"), makes his debut in this somewhat
autobiographical story which does not take home gold stars
for originality or depth of screenplay.  The picture does
display a fine array of performers in supporting roles,
highlighting a terrific appearance by 14-year-old Noah Fleiss
in the title role of a down-and-out sad sack who cannot fit in
with the gang and is given the barest affection at home.  Yet
despite the unfortunate way his life is turning out, he has a
good heart which stands to become thoroughly corrupted by
a mandated stay in a juvenile reformatory.  His basic decency
gives an audience every reason to care about him and to
despise the people who are making his life a living hell.  </P>
<P>   Fleiss's interpretation of the role is on the money.  The
kid's a natural who gives a modulated performance in a
drama that's well-directed by Whaley but unfortunately gives
us no relief, no hope, and aside from a modicum of
amusement that Joe's nerdy-looking friend Ray (James
Costa) supplies, the picture is virtually devoid of humor or
even some lighter moments.</P>
<P>   Taking place in an upstate New York community (actually
filmed in Staten Island) during the 1970s, the 28-day shoot
opens on the 9-year-old Joe (Peter Tambakis) who is
spanked on the bare bottom by his hostile teacher for lying
about his father's occupation.  Joe's dad, Bob (Val Kilmer),
works as a custodian in the same school, perpetually
threatened with dismissal for drinking on the job.  Nor does
Joe get much support from his working mother, Theresa
(Karen Young), and his slightly older brother Mike (Max
Ligosh) does not want to include him in his activities.  </P>
<P>   Five years later, the oppressive life takes its toll as the 14-
year-old Joe (Noah Fleiss), now working illegally as a
dishwasher in a greasy spoon, commits a steadily escalating
series of thefts.  He has logged into school tardy fifty-four
times, has no interest in his subjects, and given the harsh
environment in this shantytown can almost not be blamed for
taking his anger out in antisocial ways.</P>
<P>   Val Kilmer, who has deliberately gained some weight to
develop a beer belly, is convincingly despicable as a drunk
who, despite his physical violence and lack of any
communication with the kid fails to make the boy hate him. 
In slight supporting roles, Austin Pendleton cements the lad's
view of an uncaring society by cursing the kid while
simultaneously buying a hot gold ring from him, and Ethan
Hawke, who seems also to have filled out for the role, acts as
the boy's only sympathetic ear--though for some strange
reason he likes to take a seat behind him in an empty
classroom while giving him advice.</P>
<P>   The film is burdened by a redundant script, a one-damn-
thing-after another syndrome, so that instead of
demonstrating the collective effect of Joe's miserable
environment, Whaley simply takes us from one misfortune to
another.  Despite this flaw, Whaley as director does a good
job portraying the banality of life in a poor, ramshackle
community during the late 1970s and can be thanked for
giving Noah Fleiss a vehicle for that actor's intensely sincere
performance.</P>
