<PRE>                         THE PRINCE OF EGYPT
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: The story of the Hebrews' Exodus from
          Egypt is sacred to three major world religions.  In
          the rapidly developing realm of the animated film
          this retelling from the Dreamworks gets vibrant new
          life and is seen with greater spectacle than
          DeMille could have ever dreamed.  But like
          DeMille's version THE PRINCE OF EGYPT presumes to
          change the Bible story for dramatic effect.
          Rating: 7 (0 to 10), low +2 (-4 to +4)
          New York Critics: 11 positive, 1 negative, 9 mixed</PRE>
<P>     Back in the 1950s and 1960s Biblical films were again a big
business like they had not been since the days of silent film.  Cecil
B. DeMille opened the way with his remake of his own THE TEN
COMMANDMENTS (1956).  BEN HUR (1959) followed, and while not a story
directly from the Bible itself, it did involve Biblical incidents.  It
was also a remake of a 1920s film.  Eventually the times changed and
the popularity of Biblical films died.  The last major Biblical films
released to theaters were KING DAVID (1985) and THE LAST TEMPTATION OF
CHRIST (1988).  There have been some made-for-TV experiments, since but
THE PRINCE OF EGYPT from Dreamworks is the first major Biblical film
released to theaters in a decade.  In many ways it is THE TEN
COMMANDMENTS for a new generation and it repeatedly invites comparison.
Ironically the new version may create as much interest in the art and
culture of ancient Egypt as it creates for the Bible.</P>
<P>     THE PRINCE OF EGYPT begins with a statement that the story that
follows is true to the essence and values of the original story.  That
may be true but the film is somewhat truer to the plot of THE TEN
COMMANDMENTS than it is to any story told in the Bible.  DeMille based
his story on three novels about Moses as much as he did on the Bible.
The Bible does not make the young Moses an important person in
Pharaoh's household.  In Exodus the story is told with terse economy.
It merely says he was raised as the son of Pharaoh's daughter and later
that a slave called him "a prince."  And do not over-rate the value of
being a prince of Egypt, there were dozens.  Rameses the Great, who by
the way is generally considered to be the Pharaoh with whom Moses
bargained, had over 100 children.  His father might well have had
equally many and probably would have had little interest in the Hebrew
child one of his many daughters had adopted.  It makes for a better
story to say that Moses nearly became a Pharaoh himself, but that is
not what the Bible says.</P>
<P>     The story of THE PRINCE OF EGYPT will be familiar to many in the
audience, though somewhat more if they are familiar with the 1956 film
than is they know the Bible story.  The Israelites were slaves to a
Pharaoh in Egypt who was afraid that even as slaves they were becoming
too numerous and soon would become too powerful.  Pharaoh decrees that
all the male children of the Israelites are to be slain.  This brings
us to the opening of the film where Yocheved (voiced by Ofra Haza) sets
her newborn son adrift on the Nile in a reed basket, weighing a great
danger against a more certain death.  The boy is adopted by Pharaoh's
wife (not daughter as the Bible says) and becomes like a second son to
the Pharaoh.  In the most interesting variation on the DeMille version
Rameses (Ralph Fiennes) loves Moses (Val Kilmer).  Moses loves Rameses
too until he finds that he, Moses, is really a Hebrew.  So rather than
being a one-dimensional villain, there is some depth to Rameses.  Moses
kills an Egyptian taskmaster and flees Egypt.  While Rameses misses his
friend, Moses is called on by God (also voiced by Val Kilmer) to return
to Egypt and free his people, setting up the classic conflict.</P>
<P>     In animation, virtually anything that the mind's eye can see can
be put on the screen, and THE PRINCE OF EGYPT wastes no opportunity to
outdo DeMille's spectacle.  The Egyptian architecture as it appears
here is positively titanic.  The whole film seems to show architecture
of the same scale that was used to cow the locals at Abu Simbel.
Egyptian architecture is impressive, but here it is portrayed with a
certain hyperbole.  The buildings and statues as shown here are
enormous and their size is frequently exaggerated with overhead views.</P>
<P>     The style of Egyptian wall decoration is to show important figures
as being larger than other figures in a scene.  A variation on that is
used by the Dreamworks animators.  The most important characters are
given a realistic three-dimensional look.  Lessor characters are
animated in a flatter style.  That effect could have made the animation
look wildly uneven.  But the animators at Dreamworks make it all work
quite well.  In addition some of the important sequences look in part
or all almost photographic.  Some of the most effective scenes however
are done entirely flat as the story of what led to the opening of the
film is shown as animated wall decoration.  This sequence rivals the
parting of the Red Sea as the most imaginative in the film.</P>
<P>     In the DeMille telling there is an emotional climax to the story
and a visual climax.  The visual climax is the parting of the Red Sea.
Using the best visual methods available in the 1950s, DeMille used a
patchwork of mattes of scenes of flowing water.  The methods were
imperfect and little more convincing than using two rounded cakes of
Jell-O as DeMille did in the silent version. Computer animation gives a
filmmaker much more freedom and also more responsibility to do
something spectacular.  And spectacular is what they manage.  Where
this version falls flat is mishandling of the emotional climax of the
story.  After the night of terror and death comes the morning of
Freedom.  DeMille managed to give it a tremendous impact that remains
exciting even after many viewings.  A big piece of the credit goes to
Elmer Bernstein's music. THE PRINCE OF EGYPT understates the departure
almost disastrously with the Hebrews just quietly picking up and moving
out to the music of a song.  Time will tell if I am wrong, but all the
songs by Steven Schwartz seemed immediately forgettable.</P>
<P>     As with ANTZ a host of familiar actors were used to voice parts.
In this case Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sandra
Bullock, Jeff Goldblum, Danny Glover, Patrick Stewart, Helen Mirren,
Steve Martin, and Martin Short.  To my ear only Goldblum and Stewart
have voices characteristic enough to pick out.  Both Moses and God are
voiced by Val Kilmer, so it was almost a mercy that I did not recognize
his voice.  In general animation does not require big stars to do the
voices, and it almost seems wasteful.</P>
<P>     THE PRINCE OF EGYPT tells the story of the Exodus for a new
generation and does it in spectacular style.  I give it a 7 on the 0 to
10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
