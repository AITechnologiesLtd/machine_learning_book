<P> Think of all those great cinematic couples: Clark Gable and Carole Lombard;
Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy; Rock Hudson and Doris Day; Woody Allen
and Diane Keaton. Does the teaming of Sylvester Stallone and Dolly Parton
sound like a pairing to rank with the likes of those?
 If you say no right off the bat, you can spare yourself the agony of
sitting through "Rhinestone," which takes two miserable hours to demonstrate
the total lack of chemistry between these two stars, both of whom proceed
through the film looking as if they lost a bet with their agent.
 "Rhinestone" tells of successful country singer Jake Ferris (Parton, not
exactly cast against type) who, thanks to a lousy contract, is stuck
performing nightly in the Rhinestone, the rowdiest club in New York. Tired
of dodging her boss (Ron Leibman) and his lecherous moves, Jake makes a deal
with him: If, within two weeks, she can turn an ordinary guy off the street
into a convincing balladeer, he'll have to release her from her glitzy
prison to seek better prospects.
 And who should stumble onto the scene but Nick Martinelli (Stallone), a
mouthy Italian-American cab driver who claims to hate country music "worse
than liver," one of the film's many rib-tickling one-liners. After Jake's
meddling costs him his job, Nick agrees to go along with the transformation
process. "My Fair Rocky," anyone?
 "Rhinestone" is a depressing affair and much of the blame can be placed
squarely on Stallone's brawny shoulders. His idea of comic acting is to yell
as loud and as often as possible, generally while striking goofy poses. But
even that shtick is preferrable to his singing, which frequently sounds like
a malfunctioning chainsaw and would be better-suited to a heavy-metal act.
 In addition, through his overhauling of Phil Alden Robinson's screenplay,
Stallone has managed to squeeze himself into nearly every scene, banishing
Parton to the sidelines, where she tries valiantly to look amused and
charmed by his antics; she succeeds only in coming off like a weary hostess
waiting  for an obnoxious drunken guest to pass out so she can put the
lampshade back where it belongs.
 Parton gets no respect from director Bob Clark ("Porky's") either, who
seems to have been unable to utter the word "cut" when it came to Stallone's
hamming. Small wonder Parton only looks at ease when she's singing, and
thankfully Stallone excuses himself from the picture on a couple of
occasions to allow her time to warble a few pleasant tunes.
 Parton should not feel alone in having been slighted by the script, which
doggedly goes out of its way to offend everyone in the vacinity -- not to
mention the audience. At least it's equal-opportunity stereotyping, as
Stallone's wildly gesticulating, lip-smacking parents are every bit as
intolerable as Parton's "golly gosh" backwoodsy friends. A breezy pace might
have helped to obscure the poor writing and awkward performances, but Clark
offers no help in that department. "Rhinestone" plods along, stopping dead
in its tracks everytime Stallone feels the need to mug for the camera or
deliver an unintelligible, unfunny ad lib.
 The capper to this fiasco is an utterly ridiculous finale in which Jake and
Nick storm the stage of the Rhinestone, wailing "Stay Out of My Bedroom"
("Stay Out of the Theater" might have been a more inspired choice) and
wisecracking about each other as if they were the Sonny and Cher of country
music.
 They should live so long.
