<PRE>MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>After dropping her son off with her ex-husband, Theresa Osborne (Robin 
Wright Penn) elects to spend a few days on the Cape before returning to 
the Windy City.  While jogging on the beach, she discovers a bottle 
half-buried in the sand.  Inside, there's a love letter.  "Dear 
Catherine..." the note begins.  It's signed "G."</P>
<P>Theresa is so immediately struck by the poetry, the passion, and the 
honesty of the writing that she's determined to locate its author.  
Charlie, her editor at the "Chicago Tribune" (a well-cast Robbie 
Coltrane), sees this as a great human interest story and prints the 
letter without Theresa's input.  The article produces a bonanza of 
reader feedback: two more letters materialize, both written on the same, 
handcrafted paper and using the same old-fashioned typewriter.  Since 
Theresa works in the research department, it isn't long before she's 
tracked the creator of these beautifully heartfelt passages to the 
little town of St. Claire on North Carolina's Outer Banks.</P>
<P>Cute idea for a movie, especially one called "Message in a Bottle."  
Actually, it's a cute idea for a book, since the film is based on 
Nicholas Sparks' novel of the same name.  Apparently the book is more 
moving than the film: "I didn't cry during this but when I read the book 
I couldn't hold back the tears," an older gentleman commented during the 
end credits.  Hmm...</P>
<P>Once Theresa shows up in St. Claire, starts poking around, and 
discovers that "G." is, in fact, Kevin Costner... well.  Things take a 
turn for the worse.</P>
<P>That's not exactly fair.  Costner, as Garret Blake, a boat restorer 
with a dead wife and adversarial in-laws, is no worse here than he was 
in, say, "The Bodyguard."  But he does tend to play two--and only 
two--distinct roles.  The significant, allegorical, God-like-figure 
role--The Mariner, The Postman, Lt. John Dunbar, Robin Hood.  Or the 
goofy, irreverent, sexy hunk who wears his baseball cap backwards and 
believes in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last three days 
role.</P>
<P>"Message in a Bottle" bids Costner a return to his more romantic roots, 
but since he's in mourning throughout most of the picture, he slips into 
portraying The Carpenter.</P>
<P>Robin Wright Penn is attractive and earnest herself, so the two get on 
well enough, but most of what they say and do is the stuff of clichéd 
cinema, which makes the second half of the film less interesting than 
the first.</P>
<P>It's not that Theresa and Garret don't have any chemistry; they're easy 
and likable and kind of chummy together.  But the film doesn't take any 
risks.  It's an unapologetic tearjerker right down to its manipulative 
climax.  And, of course, there's the big scene in the rain following 
Garret's painful realization of why Theresa came to St. Claire in the 
first place.  Why do films insist on pelting our heroes with tens of 
gallons of water during key moments such as this?  And why did I keep 
looking to see if Garret had little flaps of skin behind his ears?</P>
<P>Fortunately, "Message in a Bottle" has Paul Newman onboard to smack 
Theresa and Garret around a bit.  As Garret's father Dodge, Newman 
steals the film with his sarcastic put-downs and, frankly, superior 
acting talents.  Hats off to the film's producers for having the 
foresight to sign the gracefully-aging veteran.  Without him, "Message 
in a Bottle" would be lost at sea.</P>
