<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>Let's be clear up front: "Charlie's Angels" is not intended to be a 
serious movie. It is corny purely by design. The tone is set right off the
bat: an airliner's in-flight film is "T.J. Hooker: The Movie", provoking a
groan of "not another movie based on an old TV series" from one of the
characters. This may come as a surprise to those expecting the film
version to resemble the original 1976-1981 TV series. Being young enough
that my memories of the programme are exceedingly dim, I had no such
preconceptions, and no problem with this kind of reinvention.</P>
<P>All that said, though, even taken on its own merits, "Charlie's Angels" is
not without flaws. The problem is that, in taking such a kitschy tact with
the material, the filmmakers simply have not gone far enough. For camp to
succeed, it must be embraced wholeheartedly. And while "Charlie's
Angels" certainly has all the trappings of cheesy celluloid, there is a
serious vein running throughout that rather spoils the whole thing.</P>
<P>The main offender is the plot, which could have been lifted, for all
intents and purposes, out of any given espionage movie. As with the TV
series, "Charlie's Angels" is about three spunky female detectives. The
"Angels" this time around are feisty Dylan (Drew Barrymore), klutzy
Natalie (Cameron Diaz), and well-bred Alex (Lucy Liu). They work for
Charles Townsend (voice, as before, by John Forsythe), a reclusive
millionaire who is heard but never seen, working through an intermediary,
Bosley (Bill Murray).</P>
<P>The Angels' case this time around involves the abduction of computer whiz
Eric Knox (Sam Townsend) and the theft of top-secret voice identification
software he was developing. Knox's business partner Vivian Wood (Kelly
Lynch) believes the culprit is Roger Corwin (Tim Curry), who recently
failed in a buyout attempt of Knox's company. Wood thinks Corwin plans to
use the voice identification code together with his own global satellite
network to create a system able to track down any person, anywhere in the
world.</P>
<P>Sounds pretty typical, doesn't it? For "Charlie's Angels" to truly 
succeed, it needed something grandiose and outlandish: a story more 
appropriately gauche to match the film's overall tenor. Instead, the
script (credited to Ryan Rowe, Ed Solomon and John August, but in fact
massaged by several other writers as well) makes the movie appear uneven,
as though there were different trains of thought running through the
production process. This may well be the case: beyond the opening hook,
most of the script was put together during filming, rarely a strategy
which leads to a cohesive product.</P>
<P>And although the writers do throw in a few twists and turns, they are
still the kind of thing one expects from this genre (one in particular is
quite reminiscent of the most recent Bond flick, "The World Is Not
Enough"). The script, for the most part, plays within the bounds and
conventions of the genre rather than taking them and turning them on their
head. It is a disappointing and lacklustre direction to take.</P>
<P>The visuals, fortunately, are nowhere near as stale. "Charlie's Angels" is
a first-time effort from music video helmer McG (aka Joseph McGinty
Nichol). He proves himself a competent helmer, keeping the action scenes
alive and interesting, and showcasing the three principals well. McG does
a particularly good job filming the "Matrix"-like acrobatics of the Angels
and their opponents. The whole gravity-defying concept is taken just far
enough without becoming completely absurd (another important ingredient to
good camp, of course, is knowing how much is too much).</P>
<P>Amongst the stars, it is the always enjoyable Drew Barrymore (also serving
as co-producer) who does the best job, investing Dylan with just the right
amount of tongue-in-cheek humor. (Check out that moonwalk, though... oy!)
Diaz does a reasonable job as well, but her laughs mostly come as a result
of (her ignorance of) her overt clumsiness, which makes for a limited
repertoire of jokes. Liu is a little too straight-laced as Alex, never
quite finding the right note to complement her co-stars. On the other
hand, though, she does the best job with the action sequences.</P>
<P>What is troubling about Alex, Dylan and Natalie, though, is that the movie
satisfies itself with defining them mostly through their interactions with
men. Except for Wood, all the other characters are male. All three Angels
even have subplots about their love lives, constituting virtually the only
depiction of them outside their jobs. Worse, just one of these arcs is
executed well, featuring Barrymore and her real-life beau, outlandish
comedian Tom Green. Liu is saddled with Matt LeBlanc, who basically
reprises his Joey Tribbiani role from TV's "Friends" (his character is
even an actor), while Diaz's interactions with Luke Wilson are charming in
places, but don't really go anywhere.</P>
<P>"Charlie's Angels" also criminally wastes two of its highest-profile
actors. Bill Murray is entirely out of place as Bosley, given no material
to suit his skills. Tim Curry is similarly mishandled, which is
particularly unfortunate since -- despite the fact that he has been
largely typecast as a villain in recent years -- he has demonstrated
considerable comedic talent in the past ("Clue" and of course "The Rocky
Horror Picture Show" to cite but two examples).</P>
<P>The lone standout amongst the supporting cast is Crispin Glover, who plays
a creepy trichophiliac assassin. Glover's silent Thin Man is perfectly in
keeping with the tone of the film, and is reminiscent of similarly goofy
yet memorable villains as "Goldfinger"'s Oddjob and "Moonraker"'s Jaws.</P>
<P>In the end, "Charlie's Angels" is a bog-standard action movie crossed
uncomfortably with an entertaining cheesy comedy. The result is reasonably
diverting (and certainly deserves praise for featuring no less than three
aggressive, proactive female heroes), but bears the scars of its troubled
production. The inevitable sequel has the potential to be a real gem --
assuming that next time, they remember to write the script first.</P>
