                         Mother Night (1996)
                   A film review by Ben Hoffman
                    Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>          This has been a bad week for me as far as screenings go.
MOTHER NIGHT was one of two films which made me leave the theater
before the film was over.</P>
<P>          MOTHER NIGHT is from a book by Kurt Vonnegut.  As a film, it
was extremely unreal and slow-moving to the point where my patience
was put to the test and failed.  I left.</P>
<P>          Howard W Campbell, Jr. (Nick Nolte) is in an Israeli prison,
accused of being a kind of Tokyo Rose for the Hitler regime.  Campbell
is given a typewriter and he writes the story of how the Americans
asked him to pretend to be an admirer of the Nazis so he can spy for
the U.S.   His radio broadcasts around the world from Germany are full
of vitriol for the Jews and Americans in general.</P>
<P>          Campbell throws himself into the spy business with such
force that we never really know whose side he was really on.  Of
course, he has been told that if he is found out, our government will
deny any complicity. (Why?  Were we not allowed to have spies in
Germany with whom we were at war?)</P>
<P>          When the war is over and Campbell comes back to the U.S., he
assumes another identity but after a while he feels it is safe and
goes back to using his real name, a name the whole world reviles, that
of Howard W Campbell, jr.  Why would he be so stupid?</P>
<PRE>         Shortly thereafter, I left the screening.</PRE>
<P>         Others wasted in the cast include Sheryl Lee, (Twin Peaks),
Alan Arkin, David Strathairn, Kirsten Dunst, Frankie Faisan and Arye
Gross.</P>
<PRE>                      Directed by Keith Gordon.</PRE>
