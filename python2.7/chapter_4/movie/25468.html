<P>"He's in love with rock 'n' roll, whoa... he's in love with gettin' stoned, 
whoa... he's in love with Janie Jones, whoa... he don't like his boring job, 
no!"</P>
<P>It's unsurprising that the song containing those lyrics is on one of Rob's 
Top Five Lists. Rob drinks and smokes too much, listens to too much loud 
music, obsesses over too many women, and isn't exactly going places 
career-wise. This hardly makes him original, but he's easy to identify with.</P>
<P>"High Fidelity" is his story -- that of a pop fan-boy constantly making 
lists, rearranging LPs and thinking of love songs that relate to his own 
romantic misadventures. "Never mind what people ARE like, what DO they like?" 
he philosophises at one point. "Books, movies, music... these things matter." 
He runs a big but only moderately successful store called Championship Vinyl, 
and employs two guys called Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black), who he 
has nicknamed "the musical moron twins". Dick is a shy kid whose main act of 
friendship is copying tapes. Barry is one of those know-alls who rams his 
taste down other guys' throats -- which is annoying most of the time, but 
also great for business, when he intimidates guys into buying stacks of 
albums they can barely carry. "What do you mean, you don't have 'Blonde on 
Blonde'??" he asks one man, making him feel guilty enough to empty his wallet 
and rebuild his collection.</P>
<P>This is a film about shift work, beer, being hung over on a Monday morning, 
listening to good tunes, and dating. In the opening scene, Rob's girlfriend 
Laura (Iben Hjejle) is leaving him for the hippie who used to live next door, 
which sets off the movie's tone of romantic longing, reminiscing and 
scheming. There is a plot of sorts -- involving Rob's attempts to reunite 
with Laura, and his visiting of old girlfriends in a goofy attempt to achieve 
catharsis with the past -- but "High Fidelity" is not a complicated story, 
and exists for Rob's musings about relationships, his lists of Top Five Worst 
Breakups, his silly ways of dealing with heartache. The style of the 
narration is inspired by another single man's cinema classic, the Michael 
Caine vehicle "Alfie" (1966), as the protagonist looks straight into the 
camera to address the audience directly. It's a good device because it's 
intimate, informal and quirky, and announces that this is a frank and 
unconventional picture, uncluttered by the usual dumb distractions of 
romantic comedies, like mistaken identities and aggravated misunderstandings.</P>
<P>Everything is handled so well that we almost forget how badly it could have 
been done. Rob has a heart-to-heart with Laura's best friend, and she doesn't 
offer the embarrassing pseudo-psychoanalysis that would be spoken in such 
typical Hollywood flicks as "Hanging Up". She lays things out in real terms: 
"There's two of them, there's one of you, and you're all in this mess 
together -- so sort it out."  Later, when Rob lists the worst screw-ups he's 
perpetrated against Laura, he is able to explain away some of them, but not 
all, and that rings of absolute truth. Women generally think men are 
insensitive pigs, men generally think women are nagging, hypocritical and 
paranoid -- the actuality lies somewhere in between, and "High Fidelity" is 
brilliant at presenting that middle ground. Its ending is similarly realistic 
-- Rob and Laura get back together, and Rob's explanation is not an entirely 
convincing piece of resolution... but don't we all make weird decisions, 
settle into realities that may not be permanent, and justify situations to 
ourselves instead of weighing them up?</P>
<P>Cusack, my favourite actor, is perhaps the only man who could have played 
Rob. His boyish wide eyes and sardonic tone of voice have more of the 
required bittersweet aura than anyone I can picture. The "High Fidelity" 
screenwriting team were also behind "Grosse Pointe Blank", one of the best 
films of 1997, and Stephen Frears, who directed the picture, is a great 
filmmaker whose credits include "Dangerous Liaisons", "The Snapper" and 
"Prick Up Your Ears". Yet so many danger signals suggested that this was 
going to be a disaster. It's based on a wonderful novel -- those usually 
translate into lousy movies. It's an American adaptation of an English story, 
which usually results in examples of bland ineptitude like "Thomas and the 
Magic Railroad". Also, its blunt world view and obsession with pop culture 
would have easily allowed it to become another obnoxiously hip and cynical 
rip-off of "Scream" or "Pulp Fiction".</P>
<P>All of those pitfalls have been avoided. This is a wonderful movie about real 
people, real problems and real fixations, that beautifully captures the 
texture of alternative culture. It will probably be a modest box-office 
success, then a huge cult hit on video, where it will be embraced by vinyl 
junkies, comic book fans, wearers of leather jackets, people who know the 70s 
were the best decade for American movies, tattoo and body piercing 
aficionados, twentysomethings who still have their "Star Wars" toys and 
everyone who loves the Krazy House club on Wood Street. I saw it on the first 
day of summer, and could really feel the sun come out.</P>
