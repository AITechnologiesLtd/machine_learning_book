<PRE>Diabolique
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1996 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        The word to describe Sharon Stone is "wonder". Not that she _is_ a wonder,
but rather that I wonder how she can be so inconsistent. She has a dynamic
screen presence in "Basic Instinct", turns in a surprisingly fine acting job
in "Casino", but possesses neither of those here.</P>
<P>        Stone teams up with private school headmaster's wife Isabelle Adjani to kill
Adjani's thoroughly unlikable husband (Chazz Palminteri). In a comedy of
errors and unexpected twists straight out of Hitchcock (as in `homage to'
[read "steal from"]), it turns out that someone saw them or he's not dead or maybe...</P>
<P>        Kathy Bates turns in a credible, if unspectacular, performance as an
investigative police detective. Her character is a bit dull but realistic,
although her actions at the end are puzzling. Adjani is more than satisfactory
as the timid beaten spouse driven to desperation.</P>
<P>        It's Stone that is a disappointment among the actors. How can she be the
epitome of a femme fatale in previous films and come off as a blank in this
one? Costumed in skin-tight clothes and looking down her nose at everyone, she
is someone you would want to avoid because she is boring, not enticingly
dangerous. Even the threat (or promise?) of a lesbian relationship between the
conspirators is only half played out.</P>
<P>        On the positive side, there are enough unexpected plot developments to keep
your interest alive. That is if you can put up with Stone's cardboard cut-out
character and scenes directly lifted from Hitch's movies.</P>
