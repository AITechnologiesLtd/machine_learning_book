<PRE>ANASTASIA (1997)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Directors: Don Bluth and Gary Goldman

Tuchman (based on the screenplay Arthur Laurents which is in turn based on
the play by Marcel Maurette)
Starring: Meg Ryan, John Cusack, Kelsey Grammar, Christopher Lloyd, Hank
Azaria, Angela Lansbury, Bernadette Peters, Kirsten Dunst, Liz Callaway,
Lacey Chabert, Jim Cummings, Jonathan Dokuchitz</P>
<P>I can't even remember the last animated feature that had big promotion that
wasn't a Disney film.  Maybe it was "An American Tail" (or it's ill-fated
sequel).  Nevertheless, Disney has been the king of animated features, for
better or worse.  And while it's not a great film, it is a breath of fresh
air from the Disney trend, which has been getting kinda lackluster as of
late, and proof that Disney isn't the only company who can make a really
good enjoyable film.</P>
<P>Of course, Twentith Centry Fox, who advertised the film over a year before
its release, have pretty much given themselves a harder job than Disney
does.  Instead of adapting something that's relatively fantasy-like anyway
(stories about mermaids, genies, and gods and godesses), the filmmakers
have chosen to adapt a story based on real life, that of the disappearance
of the daughter to Russian Czar Nicolas and his wife Alexandra, who was
overthrown by the people, led by Lenin.  It's even been made into a 50s
film, which served as Ingrid Bergman's comeback film after a long drought
of nothingness.</P>
<P>Of course, they needed to make it universal to kids and adults, so decided
to make the creepy Russian personage of Rasputin into the film's chief
villain (the film exploits the old curse put on the family by Rasputin, who
is out for vengeance after Nicolas screwed him over).  When the palace
falls due to the revolution, the family flees, but accidentally leave
behind little Anastasia (voiced by Kirstun Dunst; sung by "Party of Five"'s
Lacy Chabert), who conks her head, and receives some nasty amnesia.</P>
<P>After a brief introduction to all of this, the story follows a woman named
Anya who is about 18 years old (voiced by Meg Ryan; sung by Liz Callaway),
and we see her trying to figure out what to do with her life now that she's
kicked out of the orphanage she's lived in what seems to her all her life. 
We're also introduced to two con artists in St. Petersburg, Dimitri (voiced
by John Cuasack; sung by Jonathan Dokuchitz) and Vladmir (voiced and sung
by Kelsey Grammar), who have heard that there is a possibility that
Anastasia still lives, and her grandmother, an Empress (Angela Lansbury)
who fleed to Paris before the revolution, is looking for her.  They begin
holding auditions to find a girl who looks like Anastasia, and who is
willing to be trained to act like her so they can receive an award.  Anya
wanders in, and after a bit of conversation, agrees to go overseas with
them to maybe discover her past.  Of course, Anya is really Anastasia, and
it'll just take some time for her employers to figure it out.</P>
<P>All the while, Rasputin (voiced by Christopher Lloyd; sung by Jim Cummings)
is a living corpse, having sold his soul to the devil for the ability to
exact revenge on the Russian family, and is constantly falling apart (it
was funny the first two times...).  When he discovers that Anastasia is
still alive, and begins to attack the trio on their way to Paris.</P>
<P>Although a cartoon, this film is actually a really entertaining film for
everyone.  Sure, I was a little appalled at some of the historical
inaccuracies, but, like I did with Disney's "Hercules," I soon got over
that and just tried to enjoy the film.  The film has the same kind of magic
of a Disney film, filled with lots of very good music (I can probably hum
two or three songs from this; from "Hercules," none), and some definite
magical moments, like a sequence where Anya enters the run-down palace of
her youth and all the ghosts from her past burst out of the windows and
re-enact a dance from earlier on.  And there's even some very suspenseful
moments, most notably an excellently crafted runaway train sequence.</P>
<P>The animation is more mature than Disney's, with very human facial
expressions from many of the characters.  And the writing and voices are
both excellent, with Meg Ryan and John Cusack seen as having great
chemistry in several of the scenes.  Throughout the first half, they're
constantly bickering, and it actually sounds realistic.  I was very shocked
and impressed by all of this, and also how they could also work well with
more cartoony characters, like a bat named Bartok (voiced by the great
cartoon voice actor, and all-around great actor in general, Hank Azaria),
who serves as the main comic relief.</P>
<P>If there's anything wrong with it, it's that it's too brief.  I know it's
an animated feature, and most of them have to adhere to around 90 minutes
or less, but maybe more time and less editing would have fleshed out some
more of the supporting characters.  Rasputin is only shown a couple times,
and although we fully understand his intentions, sometimes his appearances
are so far apart from eachother that you almost forget he's there.  And
sadly, Vladmir is in much of the first act, but seems to have disappeared
during the second, who falls in love with the Empress's friend, Sophie
(voiced by Broadway great Bernadette Peters).</P>
<P>Nevertheless, "Anastasia" has a lot of energy, and is evenly paced, which
is very impressive as a lot of animated films are choppy and way too
episodic for their own good.  You also have to like how it doesn't insult
our intelligence, and gives us a romance between Anya and Dimitri that is
based on that of a Howard Hawks/Frank Capra film, which is more than
helpful in giving it a lighthearted feel.  This is not high drama, and
thank goodness for that.  Save the high drama for the live action, and
reserve the lightheartedness for the cartoons.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***</PRE>
