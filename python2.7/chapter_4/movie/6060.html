                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1996 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>Wyatt Earp (1994) ****1/2 - C:Kevin Costner, Dennis Quaid, Gene Hackman,
Michael Madsen, Tom Sizemore, Jeff Fahey, Mark Harmon, Bill Pullman,
Isabella Rossellini, Jo Beth Williams, Mare Winningham, Mackenzie Astin, Tea
Leoni.</P>
<P>"Wyatt Earp" faced unfortunate comparisons to the Kurt Russell film
"Tombstone" which came out only months earlier. And while both are immensely
entertaining, they are in fact two distinctly different kinds of films.
"Tombstone" is an action picture, centering around the events which took
place in the town of Tombstone involving Wyatt Earp. "Wyatt Earp" is a drama
about the man himself, about what made him who he was, and about the events
throughout his entire life. People who expect lots of action from this film
will be disappointed, but I knew exactly what I was about to see and
therefore my expectations were met.</P>
<P>"Wyatt Earp" runs over three hours long, something which audiences today
just won't stand for, no matter if the film is good or not (which makes no
sense, especially when people will rent three movies and then watch them
back to back). For me, as long as a movie is good, then it can go on
forever. "Wyatt Earp" in no way seems too long.</P>
<P>Surely almost every movie-goer by now has seen some version of the Wyatt
Earp legend, or at least knows it's story. So there's not much need to
discuss the plot of the film. Wyatt Earp and his family try to lead normal
lives, but get drawn into the business of keeping the peace and can not
escape that profession.</P>
<P>Now, I have seen many film versions of this story: "My Darling Clementine",
"Gunfight at the OK Corral", "Hour of the Gun", and "Tombstone". And I still
must say that I'm confused as to the actual events leading up to and
following the big gunfight between the Earps and the Clantons. None of the
film versions have successfully gone into enough detail to explain matters.
I guess that the filmmakers assume that we already know the background info
and therefore don't need to give much exposition into the conflict.</P>
<P>Kevin Costner, who in my opinion has received a lot of unnecessary criticism
in the last few years, does a fine job with the title character. He
convincingly plays Wyatt from his teenage years up until old age. Dennis
Quaid, who pulled a Robert De Niro losing over 30 pounds to play the sickly
Doc Holliday, gives a fantastic performance. The same goes for the rest of
the cast, all doing just fine with what they are given to do. The direction,
cinematography, and set design are all excellent, as is James Newton
Howard's eloquent score music.</P>
<P>A minor problem with the film is that the script tries to cover way too much
ground, and even at its long running time you feel as though the filmmakers
have barely scratched the surface. Also, characters seem to wander in and
out of the story with no explaination as to where they are. Other
characters, such as Mark Harmon's, aren't even introduced to us, we just
have to figure out who he is as we go along! And, the final two scenes seem
unsatisfactory. You want to see Wyatt return to his father and resolve their
conflict. You want to see Wyatt take Doc to the hospital and to say goodbye
to his friend. But, I guess if movies always went exactly where we wanted
them to, then the whole movie "experience" would lose it's effect.</P>
<P>A special expanded edition of "Wyatt Earp" was released on video which
included more that twenty minutes of footage which had been cut from the
original theatrical version. All of the scenes re-added are worthy scenes,
adding more depth to characters, and giving more infomation about who
certain people are, such as Mark Harmon's character and Isabella
Rossellini's character. The expanded edition gets *****.</P>
