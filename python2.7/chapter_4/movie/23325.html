The subject matter that is dealt with (and I use that term lightly) in 8MM is
an undeniably sensational one. It's too bad that its filmmaker's seem less
interested in the film's lurid topic then in the simplistic conventions of the
action genre. 8MM is ostensibly a private eye flick that aims for something
more, though ends up with something less.
Tom Welles (a morose Nicholas Cage) is a young private investigator searching
for a case that will propel his career to the level ofâ€¦Sam Spade, I guess.
Such a case is presented, and he jumps at the chance to solve what might be a
murder filmed on 8mm film. The reel was discovered in the vault of a recently
deceased socialite, and Welles has been hired by the socialite's unsuspecting
widow to determine if the "killing" is the real thing.
The existence of snuff films (the definition of "snuff film" being a film in
which a real murder occurs) is the stuff of urban legends. I have actually met
people who claim to know someone, who dated someone, whose grandmother viewed a
snuff film (or something along those lines). Yeah whatever, and Elvis lives. As
far as I've been able to gauge within my twenty years of experience on this
planet, there is no market for this sort of thing. But it doesn't seem entirely
impossible, does it, what with FACES OF DEATH (a collection of "accidental"
deaths captured on videotape and packaged for your entertainment) readily
available in many video stores.
What a completely compelling subject matter for a film to explore, right? A
topic that is in touch with the most sadistic portions of the social zeitgeist
and contains a built in sensationalistic lure. This is the stuff of great pulp
thrillers. And the opening led me to believe that for once Schumacher (the
imbecile who ran the BATMAN franchise into the ground) was on the right track.
The first ten minutes are appropriately ominous; the colors stylishly muted,
and the score an extraneous, Arabic sounding something or other that fits
nicely with the proceedings. As it turns out, 8MM isn't so much an
investigation into snuff, as it is a full-length feature film version of one of
those crime reenactments regularly staged on AMERICA'S MOST WANTED.
The imagery we are shown is dark and garish, but it's equally over done and
fallacious, like a Hollywood set that calls too much attention to itself. I was
reminded of Julie Salamon's book THE DEVIL'S CANDY, which was a guide to the
production of the adaptation of Tom Wolfe's masterful novel, THE BONFIRE OF
VANITIES. One passage recounts how the film crew littered the streets of the
Bronx with extras dressed as stereotypical pimps, hookers, and drug dealers to
fill out the scenery, and generate fear within the white middle class audience
wherein the film was aimed. They even included burning cars for additional
hyperbole, as if it was needed. Shumaker does something similar. When Tom
Welles contacts Max, an adult video store clerk (played with maximum quirkiness
by Joaquin Phoneix), he is eventually led into an underground porno ring. The
set looks like a dungeon straight out of A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, with dingy,
florescent lights barely illuminating the nightmare. The film later implies
that this dungeon is supposed to be spooky, yet somewhat stimulating as well.
It only succeeds at the former; the movie fails to show us how any of this
stuff could be any thing more then revolting.
The porn dealers, are presented as a ravaged bunch, who hardly speak a word,
and when they do speak, its so damn creepy we wish they'd stop. They are the
Hollywoodized vision of porn dealers, miles from the real thing. I suspect the
real guys would be just as scary, but in the way that that egomaniac Quentin
Tarantino is scary, rather than the quietly menacing figures 8MM gives us.
Welles and Max explore bondage clubs that look like HBO's REAL SEX series meets
HELLRAISER complete with Euro trash porn dealers decked out in ebony latex.
However the primary villains are depicted as conventionally evil louts who
wouldn't be out of place in a LETHAL WEAPON movie. That especially goes for
Peter Stormare, who plays the main antagonist in such a laughable, over the top
manner he could be auditioning for the role of lead villain in DIE HARD 4.
This wouldn't be as grating if it were put to the service of a typical action
romp, but Schumaker is supposedly charting new out territory with a subject
matter that is indeed, deeply disturbing; so disturbing that it's maddening to
see it given such a "commercial" treatment.
The film draws you into its satiated web, but for all the wrong reasons: It
trots out an abundance of home video recorded "killings", that are graphically
realized for no purpose. 8MM obviously isn't interested in exploring the topic
in a serious manner, so why present us with torturous scenes of grisly violence
if it's at the service of such an ordinary Hollywood crime thriller. (THE
GENERAL'S DAUGHTER tried the same thing to the exact same effect).
The detective portion of the story is comparatively weak: Characters are
identified by tattoos, and Cage stumbles upon a diary that the cops should have
found a year earlier.
Ahh Cage, what happened to that Nicholas Cage? He was so charismatic in FACE
OFF, but so dull in everything since. He continues that backward trend,
appearing drowsy and delivering all his lines in a tone as flat as diet coke.
But since this is a Schumacher film, he at least looks cool in a fully black
ensemble that gives him the appearance of death freezed over. For most of the
movie his character is a detached bore who, towards the end, abruptly
transforms into a psychotic nut case. In visual terms that means that Cage
contorts his face like Jim Carrey's evil twin brother while breathlessly
muttering things like "It's gonna be okay, it's gonna be okay". But never mind
that, the incongruous switch in character makes no sense. Nothing that preceded
it suggests any monumental change is coming; it just happens. I suspect the
switch has more to do with Schumacher's desire to further pander to his
audience's blood lust rather than genuine character motivation. Following the
transformation, in an incredibly bullying denouement, Cage appoints himself as
an Angel of Death executing every one guilty of wrongdoing. The repulsive
crimes committed by the villains give us reason to cheer for Cage as he coldly
dispatches them ("I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie") with less care
then Charles Bronson in DEATH WISH. Schumacher makes his bad guys so
un-redeemably evil that they laugh when they feel pain, and challenge Cage to
"do it already". We crave for them to die horribly, and the movie indulges in
our reactionary fantasies.
Should this film be lauded because it looks as a good as a commercial for
grime, and pushes all the right buttons? I don't think so. The meat of the
movie could be called entertaining, but in the same way it might be
entertaining to watch those lurid FOX "shocumentaries".
Some have criticized me for lauding movies like SEVEN and THE FIGHT CLUB,
claiming that they are cut from the same cloth as 8MM. I disagree. Both of
those films offered insight into the horrifying violence that they presented.
Schumacher may think he's doing that, but I doubt he could ever make a truly
gritty film without commercializing it (see FALLING DOWN). His nihilism is just
as stylized as the candy colored cartoon world of BATMAN AND ROBIN; it's also
just as phony. Like the extreme porn that is the subject of 8MM, the film
itself is an extreme, sexualized violent fantasy filmed like the most
conventional potboiler  </P>
