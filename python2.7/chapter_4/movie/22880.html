<PRE>EYE OF THE BEHOLDER</PRE>
<P>STARRING:  Ewen MacGregor, Ashley Judd, Patrick Bergin, k.d. lang, Jason
Priestley, Genevieve Bujold
DIRECTOR:  Stephan Elliott
WRITTEN BY:  Stephan Elliott (based on the novel by Mark Behm)</P>
<P>An early candidate for "Worst Film of 2000," Eye of the Beholder is a
soporific ordeal that completely ruins a mildly interesting beginning,
gropes blindly through some very hard-to-swallow plot points in the
middle, then takes far too much time lurching to its conclusion.</P>
<P>The story unfolds almost entirely from the point of view of a British
surveillance expert named "The Eye" (MacGregor).  He's a troubled
fellow; his wife has left him and taken their young daughter, and he
can't find them despite all his expertise, so he carries on imaginary
conversations with his child.  Assigned to track the son of a British
official in order to catch a blackmailer, he witnesses the poor fellow's
brutal murder by a beautiful but obviously disturbed woman (Judd, who
must really want to be pigeonholed in these third-rate thrillers).
Improbably, he recognizes a kindred spirit and quickly becomes obsessed
with her.  Soon, thanks to the thoroughly risible script, he quits his
job with Her Majesty's Secret Service and doggedly trails her on a
whirlwind tour of much of the United States (mostly filmed in Montreal,
presumably so the filmmakers can show the world how sophisticated
Quebecers are with their Gitanes and Cognac.)  She's a chameleon who
changes identities as often as she changes outfits-- which is a lot.  Of
course, Our Hero knows this is merely the result of her being abandoned
as a young girl by her father, and he fantasizes that he can save her,
just as he knows she will fill the void in his life.</P>
<P>That we are expected to accept such lip-service characterization and
porous plot structure is only the least of the film's flaws.  Even the
spy gadgetry, which can often be fun in movies like this, is
unconvincing.  To be fair, the movie starts out rather promisingly with
the eavesdropped murder, but very quickly degenerates into a steaming
pile of what they call merde in Montreal.  What it doesn't do very
quickly is end; it drags on interminably through scene after pointless
scene, including a stupid interlude between Judd's character and a
heroin-addicted loser played by Jason Priestley.</P>
<P>Director Elliott seems to run out of ideas about halfway through this
clunker, so he resorts to the road-movie plot device he used to far
better effect in 1994's The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the
Desert.  Needless to say, it doesn't help.  The film's pacing is simply
too slow and the main characters too inaccessible to elicit much in the
way of interest.  Suspense, so important to any thriller, is rarely
generated after the first murder scene.  In the eye of this beholder, at
least, the movie is a waste of about two hours.</P>
