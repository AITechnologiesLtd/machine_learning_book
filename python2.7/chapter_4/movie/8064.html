<PRE>CHAIN REACTION 1996
 A film review by Timothy Voon
Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon</PRE>
<P>Cast: Keanu Reeves, Morgan Freeman, Rachel Weisz, Fred Ward, Kevin Dunn,
Brian Cox, Joanna Cassidy Director: Andrew Davis Screenplay: Michael
Bortman and J. F. Lawton</P>
<P>Make Keanu Reeves look like a hooligan and pretend he's intelligent;
throw in a implausible plot; add special effects which look dull and
mediocre; use up fifty million in production costs, and you have created
for yourself a recipe for disaster.</P>
<P>When Mr Reeves spoke his first word, I felt the impending doom of this
movie.</P>
<P>The story centers about a group of scientists who have discovered cold
fusion. They succeed, but their research and lab are completely
destroyed by a seemingly evil group of industrialists, who do not want
to lose their monopoly on natural fuel resources. Reeves is at the wrong
place at the wrong time, and he and another scientist are framed for the
accident.</P>
<P>This story goes from nowhere to nowhere. Lot's of running about in which
the good guys are the bad guy, and the CIA is somehow involved. Don't
ask me for details cause I kinda dozed ……..</P>
<P>Comment: Put it in the nuclear waste disposal basket please.</P>
