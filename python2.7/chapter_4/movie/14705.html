<PRE>Zero Effect (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>*** out of *****</PRE>
<P>Cast: Bill Pullman, Ben Stiller, Kim Dickens, Ryan O'Neal, Angela
Featherstone
Written and Directed by: Jake Kasdan
Running Time: 115 minutes</P>
<P>Zero Effect is a modern day, 1990s style Sherlock Holmes story.  Every
element of a Holmes tale is here, from the eccentric detective to the
loyal assistant to the drug use... its all blatently there.  I'm not a
big Holmes fan, but this update isn't so bad.</P>
<P>Bill Pullman plays the brilliant yet socially disturbed detective
Darryl Zero. He can solve cases merely by sitting and thinking about
them, with the help of course of tuna fish, tomato soup, Tab, and lots
of drugs. He accepts his cases through his faithful assistant, played
by Ben Stiller. In the film, he works a case for businessman Ryan
O'Neal, investigating just who is blackmailing him. And despite the
fact that Zero seems to solve the case right away (the first 15
minutes of the film actually), he keeps investigating. Obviously, Zero
believes there's more to it that what he's uncovered.</P>
<P>Zero Effect is unbelievably slow going, yet somehow remains compelling
enough to make it watchable until the very end. The performances are
all good, particularly Pullman. Also, the film feels like it's a black
comedy, but instead it comes across as merely quirky. A laugh or two
would have been nice.</P>
<P>Zero Effect is the debut from Kasdan, who just so happens to be the son
of writer-director Lawrence Kasdan. [R]</P>
