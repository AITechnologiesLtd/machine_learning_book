<P>Shakespearean acting for a modern filmgoing (read:
non-Olde-English-speaking) audience presents its own set of
difficulties. When you're sitting in high school English class taking
turns reading Hamlet out loud, the kid three rows down from you
doesn't know whether to inject bitter sarcastic irony or sincere quiet
remorse into Polonius' next rhyming couplet. In that kind of setting,
it's pretty easy for the words to lose their meaning entirely, turning
the pages upon pages of iambic pentameter into a tired, monotonous
exercise in outdated grammar.</P>
<P>Since I don't have any other criteria to judge such an unfamiliar
acting style, all I can really do is ask myself if I understood what a
character was saying even if I didn't fully grasp all the words. If
there's one thing I've learned from reading Shakespeare's stuff, it's
that the delivery is as much a part of the meaning as the words
themselves. So using the Uncertified Sean Scale of Shakespearean
Performance: the acting in Titus rates as truly exceptional all across
the board. Veteran Anthony Hopkins leads the pack as the title
character; Jessica Lange plays Tamora, Queen of the Goths, with
vicious cunning, while Alan Cumming struts and frets upon the stage as
the whiny, manipulative newly-crowned Emperor Saturninus as if he's
loving every minute of it. And, to be fair, Taymor's pacing and visual
decisions are equally responsible for Titus' success in the
clarity-for-us-common-folk department.</P>
<P>So what, then, holds Titus back from greatness? With so much in place
that's so wonderfully right, what exactly went wrong? Well, here's
something you don't hear a lot when it comes to a Shakespeare
adaptation: all of Titus' problems come straight from the source.</P>
<P>Before I get into this, let me tell you that I feel woefully
under-qualified to criticize Shakespeare... my experience boils down
to reading a couple plays in high school and watching a couple movie
adaptations in college. After leaving this particular film, I figured
that anything that didn't quite jive in my head was just a result of
my untrained ear missing the Bard's point. But poking around a bit
afterward, I soon discovered that Titus' flaws are almost universally
agreed upon by Shakespeare's critics - some go so far as to say that
the play is so bad, it's probably not even Shakespeare's to begin
with. So armed with that knowledge, I feel confident enough to point
out what I myself found wrong with Titus Andronicus...</P>
<P>The biggest issue lies mainly with the principal villain, Aaron - an
orchestrator of evil for evil's sake. The point of the play seems to
be that a single act of violence can beget a chain reaction, until
everyone involved lives only to exact vengeance before someone in the
other party can do it first...  a point that could have been more
effective without Aaron's unmotivated designs.  Don't get me wrong,
he's exquisitely played (here by Harry Lennix), it's the way he's
written that's the problem.</P>
<P>Even Titus himself is an uneven character - at one turn he is a
duty-bound soldier, loyal to Rome despite all the wrong that the City
does to him. He backs an Emperor that he couldn't possibly like time
and time again, even when it hurts his family and friends, and his
early motivations are difficult to sympathize with. He does something
horrible early on to one of his sons that dulls the edge of what
sorrow and hatred he's supposed to feel later.  Sometimes Titus seems
absolutely crazy (shooting arrows into the sky bearing messages to the
gods), and the next he seems extraordinarily clever (the revenge he
stages in the end), but all his plans and inspirations are pretty much
random in the end... A credit to Hopkins that he seems to understand
Titus as much as he could possibly be understood. Some critics argue
that Titus Andronicus is supposed to be a black comedy (like I was
hoping to find) rather than a tragedy (it isn't quite that either),
but if that's the case, I didn't find a whole lot to laugh at.</P>
<P>Could Taymor have "fixed" some of these problems? Certainly. A better
question is should she have? Perhaps an even better question is did
she even want to?  What adjustments she tries to make are purely
theatrical ones, and while they mostly hit the mark, sometimes they
don't quite seem to work... the film opens with a scene showing a
modern child playing violently with a pile of action figures and war
toys in his kitchen. The kid sticks around for the remainder of the
film, first as a silent witness; but then he gradually (and
seamlessly) becomes an active participant in the horrid affair as one
of Titus' grandsons.  Is Taymor just pointing out that violence has
always been around? Is she saying it's better to take out our
frustrations on toys and by beating the crap out of each other in
Mortal Kombat 5? I'm not sure... maybe it's a little of both.</P>
<P>Julie Taymor has done her beautiful best, and she's taken a great risk
(especially for a first-timer) to attempt to breathe life into a
lifeless play.  And the end result is something alive and original and
refreshing; so much so that it's honestly frustrating that Titus
Andronicus isn't a better tale.  The film never drags or has a moment
that feels like dead weight, even though Titus clocks in at nearly
three hours. Taymor and her devoted crew have left Shakespeare's words
untouched, and built upon them a lavish vision deserving of a better
foundation. Like Titus himself, they're loyal to a cause that simply
doesn't deserve their devotion.</P>
