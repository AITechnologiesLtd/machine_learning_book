<P>     Few screen romances are as touching, as tragic, and as life 
affirming as the one shared by Nick (Robert Carlyle) and Karen (Juliet 
Aubrey) in director Michael Winterbottom's GO NOW.  While the film is 
ultimately about the effects of multiple sclerosis upon both a body and 
a relationship, GO NOW is not the exercise in depression the material 
might make it seem to be.  Winterbottom, who took an equally 
unsentimental approach to his adaptation of Thomas Hardy's JUDE THE
OBSCURE, avoids numerous melodramatic pitfalls on the way to making Nick 
and Karen's experiences with the disease real, believable, and 
manipulation-free.  By including a copious amount of lowbrow humor and 
occasionally using black-and-white freeze-frames with amusing captions, 
Winterbottom never allows GO NOW to become too much of a downer.</P>
<P>     The film starts at the beginning -- the beginning of Nick and 
Karen's relationship, that is.  They meet one night at a pub while Nick, 
a construction worker with a passion for soccer, is out having drinks 
with his best friend, Tony (James Nesbitt), and Karen is in the company 
of her roommate, Paula (Sophie Okonedo).  While Tony aggressively 
pursues sex with Paula, Nick and Karen connect in a quieter, more 
meaningful way.  After a few chance meetings on the street following 
their initial encounter, they start dating.  The relationship quickly 
becomes serious, and the two move in together.  Only then does Nick's 
disease begin to assert itself.  In this way, Winterbottom allows us to 
get to know the characters before introducing complications.</P>
<P>     It starts slowly, with minor symptoms:  double vision, numbness of 
the hands, and a lack of bladder control.  Nick goes for tests and is 
diagnosed to have MS.  GO NOW doesn't use a didactic, "movie of the 
week" approach to the subject.  It doesn't explain what MS is, why 
people get it, or how they can live with it.  Instead, the film 
concentrates on showing the condition's debilitating effects on Nick, 
and, equally important, on his perfectly-healthy partner.  It's rare for 
any motion picture about a disease to take such a blunt, uncompromising 
look at how it can erode the foundation of even the most loving 
relationship.  Sunk in frustration and self-pity, Nick frequently lashes 
out at Karen, torn between wanting her to leave him alone in his misery 
and needing her to help him.  For her part, Karen loves Nick dearly, but 
his moodiness threatens to drive her into the arms of another man, if 
only for a brief respite from Nick's rancor.</P>
<P>     Another interesting aspect of GO NOW is how it addresses the 
quandary that Nick's friends find themselves in after he has been 
stricken.  They're caught between walking on eggshells and trying too 
hard to make it seem like he's still just "one of the guys."  None of 
them walks the line adeptly, and one of Tony's jests cuts Nick deeply.  
Still, the difficulties Nick's friends have adjusting to his condition 
are minor compared with the conflicted emotions that Karen experiences.</P>
<P>     The acting in GO NOW is superlative.  Robert Carlyle, who was good 
in THE FULL MONTY and TRAINSPOTTING, is amazing here, using body language, 
facial expressions, and vocal intonations to convey his character's 
experience to the audience.  Juliet Aubrey (Dorothea Brooke in the 1994 
BBC version of MIDDLEMARCH, with a small role in Winterbottom's WELCOME TO 
SARAJEVO), whose portrayal of Karen is just as forceful and multi-faceted, 
never allows herself to be eclipsed by Carlyle.  Even in the most 
dramatically powerful scenes, she stands toe-to-toe with him.  
Members of the supporting cast, especially James Nesbitt (JUDE, 
HEAR MY SONG), are no less solid.</P>
<P>     With its rich and varied emotional texture, GO NOW is a movie that 
you feel deep in the heart, with a pair of characters, Nick and Karen, 
who are so vivid that they stay with you long after the theater lights 
have gone on.  Coupled with JUDE (which was made after this film), Go 
Now illuminates the director's keen, unerring insight into the 
complexity of emotions and situations that movies too often reduce to 
familiar clichés. Wrenching, passionate, and unforgettable, GO NOW 
hardly makes a misstep from beginning to end.</P>
