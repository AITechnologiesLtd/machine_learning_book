<PRE>Home is Where the Heart is.
The Haunting</PRE>
<PRE>by Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Right up until the end, I wanted to praise this movie; but the less than
satisfying climax stole my thunder. Hell, I'm going to steal it back!
(There's got to be a little praise I can scare up.)</P>
<P>The greatest thing about this film is so often lost, ill-achieved or simple
forgotten in others. It's the mighty undercurrent churning beneath the murky
green surface. It's the feeling a film sets spinning inside it's viewers
hearts -- ever so delicately at first, until finally it's charging like a
locomotive. Though on the screen, only wide eyes and peeked ears hint of it.</P>
<P>When I was a I child, I lived in an old wooden house two blocks from the
train tracks. I slept up on the third floor. When a freight train tumbled by
in the wee hours of the morning, that old frame house would rattle and
shake, even sway; my bed would rock. Perhaps that should be scary, but I
came to like it. And now that I sleep in the land of earthquakes; when a
tremor rocks my bed, I don't wake up ... I have eerie, yet sweet reminiscent
dreams of home.</P>
<P>That's the kind of unseen enchantment, "The Haunting" so aptly sets spinning
like a huge magnificent gyroscope on a string. The hovering motion and quiet
driving force of the twisting top is hampered neither by imperfections in
the string, nor by gravity.</P>
<P>I simply praise "The Haunting" for this marvelous achievement. The kind of
scary that lures you, that you truly believe is good, and yet sets shivers
down your spine because you know it could just as easily be otherwise.</P>
<P>Though the ending simply isn't good enough for the fine footage prior, my
overwhelming feeling of the film is still that mighty enchantment. It's
visually beautiful. In fact, the press kit had so many great photographs
that I found selecting one to print a difficult task. The looming mansion
and each set within are absolutely magnificent, each room, each door.  I'm
giving this an A- for thickly rich visuals and the ability to stir up a
wondrously chilling undercurrent.</P>
