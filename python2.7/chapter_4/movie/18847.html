<P>The Andy Warhol-professed notion of 15 minutes of fame seems to have
been invented for people like Monica Lewinsky, today's hot pop act du
jour, and now Ed Pekurny, the centerpiece of Ron Howard's new comedy
"EDtv." As played by Matthew McConaughey, last seen brandishing
six-shooters in "The Newton Boys" about a year ago, Ed's an easygoing
San Francisco video store clerk whose Southern twang, down-home charm
and almost soothing presence make him the sort of average Joe you'd like
to see good things happen to. In short, he's the perfect tour guide
through Howard's giddily twisted take on celebrity status.</P>
<P>Sad to say, but such niceties don't exactly befall our hero, who is
hand-picked by a struggling cable network to be the focus of a live,
24-hour-a-day television show that follows and broadcasts his every move
- think of it as a non-stop version of "The Real World" without the
gloomy roomies and cautious censors. Oh, sure, things start off on the
right foot, as Ed's without-warning popularity sends him on the fast
track to becoming a household name. He gets the ratings, the autograph
hounds and even the sweet fiancee (Jenna Elfman) of his loutish brother
(Woody Harrelson), after the omnipresent camera crews catch the latter
inflagrante.</P>
<P>But the luster begins to fade, the media is soon taking national polls
regarding the personal life of this public man, and the Nielsen-minded
producers are going to disturbing lengths to rake in the numbers - as
far as arranging Ed to have a session of on-air lovin' with a alluring
model (Elizabeth Hurley). These wild ups and downs, while not
necessarily grounded in reality, provide a generous helping of yuks and
yucks - the latter when Ed partakes in lovely chores like
toenail-clipping and the reliable early-morn crotch adjustment on the
idiot box. "EDtv" ultimately shuns a few of the questions it poses, but
a movie this infectiously genial need not be concerned with the big
picture.</P>
<P>So fast do the laughs, spoofs and assorted gags come that there's little
time to take in how low-key the romantic angle is - McConaughey and
Elfman click but hardly combust, a hindrance which may actually aid the
couple's ultimate dilemma - or that a subplot revealing some aired dirty
laundry in the Pekurny family past cuts an unfortunate path into soapy
melodrama; if I were a watcher, I'd probably use these parts for
bathroom breaks and nacho runs. Also, the finale, as Ed turns the tables
on the station monsters who exploit his should-be-private crises, lacks
the early zip and zest, ending up like a really long joke that almost
blows its punchline.</P>
<P>Luckily, a superlative cast of supporting oddballs as endearing as
McConaughey make even the weakest passages something to sit through.
Martin Landau gets choice one-liners as Ed's decrepit, wheelchair-bound
stepdad ("I've gotta pee. Wish me luck."), while Sally Kirkland -
where's she been, by the way? - does nice work as his white-trash mom,
the kind that fancies KFC as quality dining. Dennis Hopper shows up
briefly as Ed's biological father, and Howard wisely gives ex-sitcom
stars Ellen DeGeneres and Rob Reiner plum roles as program honchos,
respectively conflicted and conscience-challenged. DeGeneres, for one,
has never been brighter.</P>
<P>So chalk up a hit for "EDtv," and let's hope it gets renewed for next
season. Something so fresh, sneaky and entertaining certainly deserves
its share of the viewership, but don't go expecting the wisdom of "The
Truman Show" or face dire disappointment. Comparisons are inevitable -
and maybe just a little inappropriate given the two movies' varied
agendas - but here goes anyway: Think of "The Truman Show" as the
deeper, smarter and more thought-provoking classy cousin to "EDtv"'s
silly, rude and quick-to-please country bumpkin. Ed himself may put the
boob back into boob tube, but it's hard not to like what you see.<HR></P>

"‘20 Dates' tells the story of Myles Berkowitz, a man who wants to make
a film, and to fall in love. These areas are his ‘two greatest failures,
professional and personal,' so he decides to make a film about going out
on 20 dates. By the film's end, he has won the love of the lovely
Elisabeth - maybe - but his professional life is obviously still a
failure." -Roger Ebert on "20 Dates"</P>
