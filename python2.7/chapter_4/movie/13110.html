<PRE>>From 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
4 stars</PRE>
<P>Due to what we have been witness to in the past, it's hard to label any
animated movie as anything except a "family film." Such is the story
with Anastasia - which has a mature, adult-like plot but some weaker
moments for the kids which in the end distracts the viewer from the
power of the film. It's almost as if an animated film must have people
walking away smiling, ready to buy new Happy Meal toys.  But, even when
observing it in an adult frame of mind, it's still damn good as a
distraction from ordinary, less stimulating films.  It also serves as a
reminder than animated features can indeed have a good amount of
substance, and can genuinely stir your emotions.</P>
<P>In its most shallow moments, Anastasia is just a simple tale told well.
In 1916, the Romanov family are celebrating their 300th anniversary as
the ruling dynasty in Russia.  The evil, party-crashing Rasputin (who
sold his soul to the Devil) puts a curse on the Romanov's, and goes on a
killing spree across the nation, slaughtering all members of the family
except two.  Anastasia (Meg Ryan) and her grandmother the Dowager
Empress  (Angela Landsbury) manage to escape the evil hands of Rasputin,
but are separated along the way.</P>
<P>Flash forward ten years and Anastasia is 18 years old, with only
glimpses of her tragic past.  The Empress, now residing in Paris, is
offering ten thousand dollars to anyone that can deliver her
granddaughter to her.  Anastasia joins con men Dmitri (John Cusak) and
Vlad (Kelsey Grammer) on their trip to Paris.  Meanwhile in the
underworld, Rasputin learns that she is still alive, and hatches various
plots to murder her.</P>
<P>The inevitable romance between Anastasia and Dmitri is the vehicle for
many of the film's gags; but is also its emotional core.  The
relationship between these two characters is truly enticing, and a lot
more interesting and mature than many of the recent animated romances.
Perhaps this is why Anastasia can effectively appeal to adults - it
works as a drama as much as it does a comedy.  It's a film that you can
imagine in a non-animated form, unlike Disney classics like Aladdin, The
Lion King and Beauty and the Beast.  Whilst many have dubbed Anastasia
as simply an attempt for a different company to cash in on animated
successes, directors Don Bluth and Gary Goldman have been careful not to
mimic Disney films.  Much to their credit, it looks, feels and sounds
genuinely original, bar the occasional exception.</P>
<P>Most of Anastasia's duration is filled with healthy, skillful moments,
but like most animated films it does have its flaws.  Strangely, most of
the scenes involving Rasputin fail to impress or innovate - making the
viewer wish that he had never been included in the first place.
Rasputin could have been a wonderfully complex, religious character but
instead appears cliché and predictable; appearing every so often just so
the heroes of the story could have someone to fight against.</P>
<P>If previous animated features have taught us anything, it's that there
has to be a bad guy, a hero and a final confrontation.  In fact, the
only film of this type that I can think of that was not afraid to show
complex scenes and characters was The Hunchback of Notre Damn, which I
still regard as the best exhibit of film animation ever.</P>
<P>But in all fairness, Anastasia shouldn't be compared to all the other
cartoon classics because, as I mentioned before, it does stand out as an
original piece of work.  And more than that - it's a beautiful,
unexpectedly touching experience that will make you wonder how on Earth
an animated film can be so moving.</P>
<P>If only Bluth and Goldman could have dared to forget the "family film"
tradition and make a genuinely adult, mature film - perhaps then we
would have a clear-cut masterpiece.</P>
