<PRE>                       THE BEAUTICIAN AND THE BEAST
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>The truth is I was not expecting the movie to be as good as it was.  I
can only take Fran Drescher (TV's "Nanny") for short bits. Whether it
was Drescher or the director who slowed her down, it was all for the
good and is largely responsible for the film being charming and funny.
In a way some of the situations are reminiscent of The King and I, even
to some of the comic posturing by the heartily disliked dictator, Boris
Pochenko (Timothy Dalton), of the mythical Eastern European country of
Slovetzia. . . . except that the humor here is different than in The
King and I but frequently and surprisingly every bit as funny.</P>
<P>Joy Miller (Drescher) is a beautician and beauty teacher in the Borough
of Queens, New York City.   But Joy is sure that one day she will get
the break she deserves and, surprise (!) it comes in the shape of
Ambassador Grushinsky (Ian McNeice) from Slovetzia who is looking for a
teacher.  The dictator Pochenko, known in his country as The Beast  is
looking to change his image.  He wants to be liked.  How better than to
engage a teacher to begin to mold his family and then him?    The
emissary knows that Fran is a teacher but he is unaware that her
teaching consists of beauty hints.</P>
<P>Arriving in Slovezia, she is taken with the palatial luxury as well as
its ruler.  Follows some revolutionary intrigue, arrests, etc. and Fran
has to teach Pochenko something about free speech and democracy.  All,
you will be happy to hear, turns out well.  That it entertains all the
way is another plus. Special mention should be made of teenager Lisa
Jakub who is a deadringer for Isabella Rossellini.</P>
