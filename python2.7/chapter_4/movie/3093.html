<P>     Floating around the art house circuit these days is a restored
version of Henri-Georges Clouzot's 1955 murder mystery DIABOLIQUE.
Easily overlooked because of its limited distribution, this is a
picture that may demand some active searching to find.  It is well
worth the effort.  With a plot as deliciously curvy and complex as any
contemporary thriller, DIABOLIQUE is a masterpiece, and as accomplished
as anything done by Hitchcock.</P>
<P>     Unlike many noir thrillers, DIABOLIQUE takes as much time defining
and refining its characters as developing its plot.  By never taking
things to excess, Clouzot forms a chillingly realistic presentation.
There are moments of irreverent humor, but these are seamlessly
incorporated so as not to disturb the overall tone.  With its keen
insight into the base aspects of human nature, DIABOLIQUE has a lot
more to offer than a traditional entry into the genre.</P>
<P>     The less said about the plot, the better, since any excess of
detail is likely to afford an unwanted peek around one of DIABOLIQUE's
many corners.  In essence, this is the story of two women who conspire
to murder one man.  The intended victim is Michel Delasalle (Paul
Meurisse), a despicable sort of person who abuses the women in his life
while flaunting his mistress in front of his wife.  The potential
killers are Christina Delasalle (played by Vera Clouzot, the director's
wife), the ailing, fragile wife; and Nicole Horner (Simone Signoret),
the mistress who wears sunglasses to conceal her latest shiner.</P>
<P>     The three leads all turn in impeccable performances.  Paul
Meurisse presents an entirely convincing portrayal of a man with no
redeeming qualities.  Michel Delasalle is the kind of person no one
wants to know.  In his position as director of a boarding school, he's
the boys' worst nightmare.  Nicole Horner is suitably no-nonsense as
the practical mistress, and Vera Clouzot is more than credible as the
wife who is equally repelled and enticed by the thought of killing her
wretched husband.</P>
<P>     Diabolically clever in construction with perfect pacing and a
momentum that builds to the appropriate moment, this film is the sort
of intelligent thriller that is difficult to find.  The restored print,
which includes several previously-trimmed scenes, is clean and crisp,
making DIABOLIQUE every bit as enjoyable as Hollywood's best current
offerings.</P>
