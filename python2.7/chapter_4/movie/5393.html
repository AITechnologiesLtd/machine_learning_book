                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  *1/2  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1988)</PRE>
<P>        YOUNG EINSTEIN is embarrassingly lame, but that didn't stop it from
becoming a phenomenon in Australia, where it became the third largest box
office hit of all time.  In the U.S., Warner Brothers is hoping the movie
will follow in the footsteps of Paul Hogan, INXS, and shrimp on the barby
to become the latest rage from down under.  Personally, I'm hoping
Americans everywhere will rise to the occasion and make YOUNG EINSTEIN a
box office bomb.</P>
<P>        YOUNG EINSTEIN sprang from the twisted mind of Yahoo Serious, who
not only wrote, produced, edited, and directed the film, but also starred
and did his own stunts.  His creation is about as stupid and contrived as
you'd expect from someone named Yahoo.</P>
<P>        The movie takes substantial historical liberties in recreating
Einstein's youth.  Whereas the scientist actually hailed from Germany, the
film finds him still living with his parents on Tasmania, a remote
Australian Island.  In addition to deriving the formula for energy and the
theory of relativity, Albert invents surfing, bubbles in beer, and the
electric guitar.  Yahoo plays Einstein as a naive and unrefined country
hick--a clown with an insatiable curiosity.  Although Yahoo's performance
is at first endearing, the one-dimensional characterization loses its
novelty faster than you can say E=mc2.</P>
<P>        Yahoo has created a charming family for Albert, and the scenes on
Tasmania are often clever.  But after the first twenty minutes, the movie
quickly plummets and degenerates into a poor excuse for a comedy.  YOUNG
EINSTEIN is hampered by its lethargic pace and inane plot.</P>
<P>        Yahoo must be an MTV addict because his movie features an
omnipresent soundtrack; unfortunately, the music is altogether gratuitous
and quickly becomes overbearing.  Almost every other scene includes a
blaring rock song that leaves you wondering whether you are watching a
movie or a music video.  The instrumental score, on the other hand, is
generally playful; Yahoo uses such classics as the "1812 Overture" and the
theme from THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY to great comic effect.</P>
<P>        Halfway through YOUNG EINSTEIN, I knew for sure the movie was a
stinker.  But it wasn't until the very end that I finally put my finger on
why: the comedy takes its roots not from whimsical film fantasies (such as
YOUNG SHERLOCK HOLMES) but from cheesy prime-time sitcoms.  In fact, YOUNG
EINSTEIN might have been more at home on network television, where its
sophomoric humor wouldn't raise any eyebrows.</P>
