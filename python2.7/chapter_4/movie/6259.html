<P>This movie is, of course, based on the Agatha Christie novel of the
same title. It involves the exploits of Hercule Poirot as he endeavors
to solve a series of murders aboard a steamboat traveling along the
Nile river in Egypt.</P>
<P>Obviously, the main difficulty in a review of this sort is reviewing
it both as an adaptation of a Christie novel and as a film in and of
itself. Given this, I will break this review into two parts.</P>
<PRE>AS A MOVIE:</PRE>
<P>Murder mysteries don't get much better than this. A beautiful but
abrasive heiress has been shot through the temple in her cabin aboard
a Nile riverboat during her honeymoon cruise. Virtually every one of
the passengers has a reason to wish her dead, and it falls to Hercule
Poirot, the famous Belgian (NOT French) detective, to find the truth.
As he delves deeper into the history and motives of the passengers,
two more murders are committed. Only Hercule Poirot can sort the wheat
from the chaff and solve the mystery with a breathtaking confrontation
with the suspects and murderer(s). The pace is great, the twists and
turns maintain interest, and the performances are first-rate.</P>
<PRE>AS AN ADAPTATION:</PRE>
<P>Very faithful to the novel. The only downside is, of course, Peter
Ustinov's rendition of Hercule Poirot. A large, sweaty, overbearing
interpretation of Christie's Belgian detective, Ustinov sports "les
moustaches" that the *real* Poirot would have found "insupportable,"
and speaks in an accent that is as far from Belgian as the waffles
down at IHOP. Especially given David Suchet's faithful and pleasing
portrayal of Poirot in the Highbridge Productions series, it's a
little hard to take. But this is a quibble--the storyline itself is
very much tied to that of the original novel, and transfers well to
the big screen.</P>
<PRE>THE PERFORMANCES:</PRE>
<P>Excellent all around, especially that of Bette Davis, David Niven,
Olivia Hussey, Angela Lansbury, and Jon Finch. I'll even give Peter
Ustinov a nod for those who aren't fans of the book--while totally
faithless to the "je ne sait quoi" ambiance of Christie's Hercule
Poirot, it is an engaging performance in its own right.</P>
<PRE>THE UPSHOT:</PRE>
<P>The best of the Brabourne/Goodwin 70s film adaptations of Poirot
books. A must-see for Christie fans, especially Hercule poirot fans,
and a very good choice for anyone looking for a traditional convoluted
mystery flick.</P>
<PRE>Cheers,
cey</PRE>
