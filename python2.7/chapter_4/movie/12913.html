<P>If you were expecting to see Jim Carrey doing his outrageous "shtick," you
will not find it in this film . . .  Which is a plus.   In ACE VENTURA,
while the movie was only mediocre, Carrey's antics were amusing. By the
time he made Cable Guy, which was better, and The Mask, which was still
better, he no longer needed the way-out eye-popping. .   Truman Burbank
(Jim Carrey) is quite a different character.</P>
<P>Truman has been an actor all of his 30 years but only recently has he
become aware of that.   It seems that soap opera director, Christof (Ed
Harris) has been playing god with Truman's life . . . since he was born.
He has made him the star of the longest running soap opera in TV history.</P>
<P>The story is indeed different than usual movie fare but not quite as
original as the publicists  would like us to believe.   Several articles
have been written about other movies with approximately the same premise.
However, once that is said,  the Truman Burbank movie stands on its own.
And Carrey is very good in it..</P>
<P>Director Christof constructed a gigantic sound stage that looked like a
typical American town, Seahaven.  All the buildings are quaint.  And
Truman has had no idea he had been living and growing into adulthood on a
huge movie set.  All his friends and family are actually actors in this
long-running soap opera, as is even his wife, Meryl (Laura Linney) while
every other day since he was born Truman has been watched by thousands of
TV cameras hidden in the make-believe town of Seahaven.  All his neighbors
are in the cast, equipped with earphones to receive instructions,  all
directed by Christof.    Truman's life has become the TV fare for billions
of watchers over the thirty years.</P>
<P>When it finally dawns on him that none of this is real, that he is a pawn
being manipulated by Someone, Truman rebels.  His single priority now
becomes his escape from Seahaven.   At the other end is the Director who
"conceived" "The Truman Show and is not about to let the series come to a
conclusion. It is interesting to contemplate what it may be like in the
next millennium when spying will be even easier than it is now. What will
happen to privacy?  Those are some of the specters the film raises.  The
question also comes up, "Why are billions of people over the years
watching Truman Burbank's seemingly uneventful life."   At no time are we
shown anything out of the ordinary in his existence.  Perhaps it is that
people are natural voyeurs.</P>
<P>While the scenes with Christof manipulating the sun and the moon and the
weather and ocean waves from his studio control room are funny, Truman's
escape on the sea seemed to go on too long.</P>
<P>Others in the cast are Truman's friend Marlon, an actor, of course,(Noah
Emmerich), Natascha McElhone, who plays Lauren/Sylvia,  Holland Taylor as
Truman's "mother"   And Kirk (Brian Delate.)</P>
