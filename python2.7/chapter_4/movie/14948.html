APT PUPIL
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>The old "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" television series was masterful at
creating little, macabre stories packaged into self-contained 30-minute
doses.  It knew just how to take a simple story of seemingly ordinary
people, who looked like our next-door neighbors, and make us wait for
the ending punch.  With a few diabolical flourishes, the show's
conclusion would reveal the characters' hidden evil.  Trimmed of its
fat, APT PUPIL would have made an intriguing episode.</P>
<P>After director Bryan Singer's first mesmerizing and popular film, THE
USUAL SUSPECT, his second has been widely anticipated.  APT PUPIL,
adapted by Brandon Boyce from the Stephen King novella, was Singer's
choice for an attempt to repeat his first success.</P>
<P>In some ways an odd choice, the story has a paucity of material to work
with.  On the other hand, a Stephen King novel about the Holocaust
certainly has lots of potential for shock value.  For some reason Singer
downplays the shock while asking his audience to wait an hour and a half
before he lets the movie finally take off.  For those with suitable
patience the payoff is there, and the wait is made tolerable by a
fascinating performance by Ian McKellen.</P>
<P>McKellen plays the part of an old Nazi concentration camp guard living
in the United Sates under the name of Kurt Dussander.  With bad skin and
a scruffy beard, Dussander clutches his cigarettes in his grimy hands,
smoking them down to the last gram of tobacco.  His gruff voice hides a
cauldron of atrocities, hidden deep in the inner reaches of his memory.</P>
<P>In a lackluster performance, Brad Renfro plays a bored but brightly
inquisitive high school senior named Todd Bowden.  Todd's history class
has just finished their week on the Holocaust, but Todd is not ready to
move on to other subjects.  Obsessed, he researches the subject in the
library until he tracks down a previously unknown Nazi guard (Dussander)
living right in the town's midst.</P>
<P>Confronting Dussander with his crimes, Todd demands daily doses of death
camp stories, or he will turn Dussander in to the police.  Although
there are a couple of cheap exploitation scenes of the killing of
animals and a few spooky daydream scenes of concentration inmates, the
movie is remarkable for its moderation.  The script manages to make the
Holocaust seem almost trite.  The entire movie could be rewritten
without that aspect and be remarkably unchanged.  All they would need to
do is have Dussander be a serial killer who hasn't harmed anyone in
several decades.</P>
<P>The film, while eventually entertaining, takes little risks, following a
formula you've seen many times before.  It is worth seeing for Ian
McKellen's work, but, if you are waiting for director Bryan Singer to
demonstrate his brilliance again, you'll have to hope his third picture
is a charm.</P>
<P>APT PUPIL runs 1:51.  It is rated R for strong violence, sex, drug usage
and profanity and would be fine for older teenagers.</P>
