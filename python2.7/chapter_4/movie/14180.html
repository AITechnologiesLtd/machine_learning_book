<PRE>SNAKE EYES</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Brian Takeshita</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  **1/2 out of ****</PRE>
<P>It was a dark and stormy night.  A hurricane was making landfall and
whipping the shores of Atlantic City, a town known for the bright
lights which belied its dark, seamy underside.  The rain came down
like a gesture from God, trying to wash away the murkiness, the
corruption, the evil.  But taking shelter inside of one of the
so-called jewels of the city's thorny crown were the sinners, gathered
around a boxing arena and eager to watch the ensuing pugilistic
contest like the Romans of old, frenzied in their thirst for blood,
drawn of their fellow man.</P>
<P>That's how I envision the first paragraph of the screenplay for SNAKE
EYES, in which director Brian De Palma attempts to deliver a film noir
for the present day.  It's got all the ingredients:  A cop on the
take, a villain with money and power, a damsel in distress, a boxer
paid to take a dive, a murder, and a storm outside to provide an
ominous backdrop.</P>
<P>The main character is Rick Santoro (Nicholas Cage), an Atlantic City
police detective who is king in his sector of the boardwalk area.  He
knows everybody, is well connected, and gets regular payoffs by the
local would-be felons.  It's obvious he runs a pretty tight ship, one
that serves his own purposes nicely.</P>
<P>Atlantic City is a big boxing town, and Santoro is a big boxing fan.
On this particular night, he gets to watch the fight of the century
from the front row, courtesy of his best friend, Navy Commander Kevin
Dunne (Gary Sinise), who is handling security for Defense Secretary
Charles Kirkland (Joel Fabiani).  Kirkland's attendance is partly a PR
ploy to show solidarity with the arena's owner Gilbert Powell (John
Heard), who's also the head of a defense contracting company
developing the Airguard, a controversial new anti-missile system.
When, in the middle of the fight, Kirkland is shot to death mere feet
away from Santoro, he becomes embroiled in the investigation into who
killed the Secretary and why, attempting to reconstruct the chain of
events leading up to the assassination through eyewitness accounts,
surveillance footage, and his own recollections.</P>
<P>The problem with film noir as a genre is that it doesn't give us very
many surprises.  There have already been a lot of films before this
one that have set the series of events we expect - that's why it's a
genre.  It is for this reason that SNAKE EYES doesn't really impress.
De Palma treats us to some interesting (although not innovative)
camerawork, great use of light and shadow, and the way he plays out
the same scenes from different perspectives is refreshing, but as a
film there isn't a lot that's original. We can anticipate the plot
twists, and we know what the outcome will be.</P>
<P>This is why it is perhaps even more disappointing that there are some
rudimentary points which were not given enough attention, signifying
some sloppy screenwriting and direction.  For example, Julia Costello
(Carla Gugino) is the person seen talking with Kirkland when he is
shot.  Disappearing into the crowd after being grazed by a bullet
herself, she is sought after by both the good guys and the bad guys as
the one person who might be able to identify the motive behind the
murder.  Principal role, right?  Important to the plot, right?  It
wasn't until the credits came up that I even knew the character's
name.  Was the part where her name is revealed left on the cutting
room floor, or was I just seriously not paying attention?  I wonder
how she is even able to "disappear" when security is crawling all over
the arena, detaining people left and right, and here's a woman,
covered in blood, and apparently no one takes notice.</P>
<P>There are other disappointments, too, such as when Santoro is being
trailed by the film's villain, and recognizes he is being followed
when lightning from behind causes an unmistakable shadow.  De Palma is
successful in mounting some serious tension by focusing on certain
parts of the villain's shadow, and utilizing Ryuichi Sakamoto's
dramatic score.  However, there is zero payoff as Santoro simply turns
around and faces his antagonist, rather than pull some fancy move and
commence the final struggle.  Unfortunately, the film's climax, when
it does occur, depends so much on coincidence it's laughable - or at
least would be laughable if it weren't such a sorry excuse for
wrapping everything up.</P>
<P>Luckily, we are given two good performances by the male leads.  Cage
is engaging as the over-the-top Santoro; he's up on energy through the
first half hour of film, and it's fun to watch him.  It would be
difficult to take it for the full running time, however, so his
character is graciously toned down as the sobering reality of the
assassination takes hold.  Cage also plays well off of Sinise, who's
Dunne is straight man to Cage's Santoro for the first part of the
movie, but who soon enough gets to distance himself and command his
own scenes.  I sometimes wonder if Sinise can play a role badly.</P>
<P>SNAKE EYES is a film that starts out with a lot of potential, but
founders along the way to a decidedly unsatisfying finish.  Cage and
Sinise save portions of the movie, but in the end the screenplay does
not rise above the level of ordinary, and occasionally dips below
that.</P>
