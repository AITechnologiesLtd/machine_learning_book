<P>    The Wings of the Dove is a vicarious experience, a film that
instigates more thought than outward reaction. It's a tale of lost love
and death, a film about unhappy people who become even more unhappy in
desperate attempts to make themselves feel better. The characters are
quiet, and they don't always tell each other what they're thinking. It's
a subtle, touching movie, enhanced by some of the best acting of the
year, and by director Iain Softley's striking artistic eye for scenery
and human emotions.</P>
<P>    Helena Bonham-Carter stars as Kate Croy, a young Englishwoman who
lives under the wing of her rich Aunt Maude (Charlotte Rampling). Kate's
life is clearly not what she wants it to be--her idea of fun has nothing
to do with socializing at large, exquisite gatherings at which the
richest individuals in society get drunk and have grand conversations.
She's in love with Merton Densher (Linus Roache), a journalist who
doesn't mesh well with her own social status. Maude insists that they
don't see each other, but Kate can't live with this.</P>
<P>    It's not long before she meets Millie Theale (Allison Elliott), a
dying American heiress. The two become friends, but Kate's intentions
far exceed friendship--her plan includes convincing Merton to seduce
Millie and get her to fall in love with him so that she will leave him
all of her money. This will leave Merton a rich man and therefore in the
appropriate social class for Kate to marry him.</P>
<P>    Carter gives a deep, brooding performance as Kate; her struggles are
what makes this film such a ponderous experience. Here we have a woman
who loves a man so much that she implores him to do something that, at
first glance, is a truly awful piece of manipulation. The trick is that
Kate actually cares very much for Millie, but her love for Merton is
much stronger. Kate is not a hateful woman, but she is as unhappy as
they come. Her love for Merton is all that keeps her going, and this
plot she contrives serves not to make her better, but to hurt the people
involved. Carter's work here is strikingly good; she evokes the kind of
sexual and emotional passion that is rarely associated with this
seemingly serene time period of the early 1900s, and the outcome is a
character who is somehow always sympathetic, even in her worst moments.</P>
<P>    Linus Roache is very strong as Merton, though his character is the
one who speaks the least. His intentions and thoughts are not always
apparent, but little subtleties in his language and facial expressions
tell the audience exactly what it wants to know. Allison Elliott gives
the film's best performance as the rich American girl, an person so
frayed and ruined by her disease that pity is the last thing she
wants--she doesn't even tell her friends that she is sick. The
relationships between these people are always under examination, and
constantly changing. What they go through is nothing short of mental
torture.</P>
<P>    Softley's direction, mixed with the John Beard's breathtaking
production design and Eduardo Serra's cinematography, make The Wings of
the Dove one of the most attractive pictures of the year; it's a film
seamless in period detail and mood. Softley also does some subtle things
with the camera--watch carefully the final scene between Kate and
Merton. Moments like this are what I love to see in movies. The Wings of
the Dove is one of those films that makes you think for a long time
after it's finished; only then can the power and depth of this story and
these people be completely understood.</P>
