<P>     KISS OR KILL is a chaotic-but-pointless exercise in mediocrity.  It 
belongs to the ever-increasing group of post-Tarantino road pictures, 
where a modern-day Bonnie and Clyde go on the run, mouthing pseudo-
clever dialogue while the body count piles up.  Inevitably, they are 
being chased by both the good guys and the bad guys, and the final 
confrontation usually involves gunplay and bloodshed.  But, while KISS 
OR KILL strives for the relatively modest goal of being an Australian 
TRUE ROMANCE, it never quite ascends to that level, remaining instead 
mired in the pit that claimed titles like LOVE AND A .45.  </P>
<P>     The first problem with KISS OR KILL is that there aren't any vital 
characters.  To be sure, Nikki (Frances O'Connor) and Al (Matt Day) are 
attractive, but they spend the film's 90-minute running time inhabiting 
lifeless husks.  These two are deadly dull, and, despite a few heated 
sex scenes, there's no evidence of any chemistry between them.  Their 
pursuers, a pair of bumbling cops (Andrew S. Gilbert and Chris Haywood) 
and a pedophile ex-soccer star named Zipper Doyle (Barry Langrishe), are 
no more interesting.  Along the way, we have the usual gallery of 
oddballs, including a recluse (STRICTLY BALLROOM's Barry Otto) who shows 
up everywhere and a motel owner who uses a blow torch to keep the fondue 
warm.</P>
<P>     When the film opens, our heroes, Nikki and Al, are in the process 
of pulling a scam on a businessman -- she takes him to a motel room, 
drugs him, then lets her partner in so that the two of them can clean 
their victim out.  Only this time, something goes wrong, and the 
businessman dies.  Panicking, Nikki and Al flee the scene with a video 
tape in their possession that shows Zipper Doyle in bed with a little 
boy.  Soon, they're involved in a cross-country chase.  Only, every 
place they stop for the night, someone turns up dead.  Distrust worms 
its way into their relationship as Nikki and Al begin suspecting each 
other of being a little too handy with a knife.</P>
<P>     In an unsuccessful attempt to energize his film, director Bill 
Bennett employs an irritating form of jump-cutting that compresses time.  
The effect is interesting on the first few occasions when he uses it, 
but, like a child infatuated with a new toy, he overdoes things.  Soon, 
this peculiar form of editing becomes both distracting and off-putting.  
Sadly, Bennett's stylistic riffs may be the most intriguing aspect of a 
film that feels gratingly over-familiar.  In fact, my complaints about 
this movie are similar to those I voiced for A LIFE LESS ORDINARY, 
except that picture was somewhat better made.</P>
<P>     Frances O'Connor and Matt Day, reunited here from LOVE AND OTHER 
CATASTROPHES, are appealing performers, but there's little that they, or 
anyone else, can do with this script, which, by trying to be too hip and 
kinetic, ends up being simply muddled.  There is one great moment, 
however, and, while it's not worth sitting through the movie for, it 
will stand out for anyone who sees the film.  The scene in question 
doesn't involve the leads, but features the two cops.  It begins like 
something from PULP FICTION, with one man explaining why he doesn't eat 
bacon.  Where the conversation goes, and how it ends, is borderline-
hysterical.  </P>
<P>     Bill Bennett's last feature was the lifeless TWO IF BY SEA, and 
KISS OR KILL doesn't represent much of a step in the right direction.  
The films have some plot and character similarities, but the most 
obvious shared trait is that neither is particularly enjoyable.  Viewing 
KISS OR KILL is more of a trial than a pleasure, and, while it isn't 
terrible film making, there's nothing here worth getting excited about.  
Even those with a fondness for this overpopulated genre may find that 
Bennett's picture is one too many.</P>
