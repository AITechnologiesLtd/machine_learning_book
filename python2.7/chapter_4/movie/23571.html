<PRE>A Review by Akiva Gottlieb</PRE>
<P>When culture is used as a verb, one definition given
by Webster's Dictionary is `to cultivate'. A few of
their definitions of cultivate are `to promote the
growth of,' `to nurture,' `to form and refine, and to
`make friends with'. Jasmin Dizdar's `Beautiful
People' is a film about culture, yet few of its
characters are nurturing or friendly.
To establish its tone, the film begins with a violent
fight between two strangers on a London bus. One man
is a Croat; the other is a Serb. The two don't even
need to speak in order to know that they are enemies.
Hate is so deeply ingrained in their minds that words
could do little to help. `Beautiful People' is a
bittersweet, ironic look at the lives of a
cross-section of Londoners that can only be redeemed
by their ability to turn hate into love.</P>
<P>For his first film, Dizdar weaves about five different
stories into his tale of love, tolerance and family.
We meet characters of all races from all different
classes of society. A couple stories, in particular,
stand out. One involves a doctor (Nicholas Farrell)
who copes with his recent marital separation by
befriending a young Balkan couple. The other involves
a young heroin addict who unexpectedly finds himself
in the midst of a war zone, and ends up a hero.</P>
<P>Like most first films, `Beautiful People', which won
Best Picture at the Cannes Film Festival, is a bit
rough around the edges. Not all the stories are
particularly involving, and the odd blend of pathos
and humor is often misguided. But it is a nod to
Jazmin Dizdar's maturity that all the stories feel
human. Unlike most ensemble films, `Beautiful People'
doesn't use a superficial plot thread to tie the
stories together. Instead, the characters are linked
by their similar feelings and actions.</P>
<P>Over the past few years, a few important films (most
notably Emir Kusturica's `Underground') have put their
own spin on the turmoil in the Balkan region.
`Beautiful People' is the first to explore life after
survival, where many realize that cultural diffusion
can be a war in its own right.</P>
<P>With this film, Jasmin Dizdar has taken a bold,
ambitious look at prejudice in a cultural melting pot.
However, his greatest achievement is shining all his
characters in a sympathetic light, regardless of their
race or gender. His all-inclusive approach to the
characters is the real lesson to be learned from the
experience.</P>
<P>The struggle of this group of people is one that
millions of immigrants go through every day, on all
continents. But in Dizdar's eyes, whether they be
black, white, green or red, they're all beautiful.
That's cultivation in a nutshell.</P>
