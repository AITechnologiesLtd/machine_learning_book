<PRE>                                   SCREAM
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     My review notes for SCREAM consist of three whole words:</P>
<PRE>     Totally.
     F***ing.
     Scary.</PRE>
<P>     What has been billed as the first "really scary" movie in a long
time surprisingly lives up to its promise (due, in part, to the fact
that there hasn't been a really scary movie since THE EXORCIST III in
1990), with plenty of screaming on the screen and in the audience.  Wes
Craven's SCREAM is a true exercise in the horror film -- an in-depth
study of the genre that terrifies at the same time as it good-naturedly
pokes a little fun at itself.</P>
<P>     Anyway, Miramax is practically *begging* critics not to reveal the
plot, so I'll just give you the starting point:  an all-alone Drew
Barrymore answers a phone call from a deranged killer, and it goes
downhill from there.  Be aware that the "star" of the show is not
Barrymore, but is actually Neve Campbell (THE CRAFT).  And the *real*
stars are a couple of her character's friends, played by a now-blonde
Rose McGowan (THE DOOM GENERATION) and Matthew Lillard (HACKERS), who
totally steal the show.</P>
<P>     Of course, these are only two of the dozens of characters who serve
as Fresh Meat for our killer, the most notable of which is probably
Courtney Cox as a trashy tabloid TV reporter covering the story.</P>
<P>     Thank God Craven has imbued SCREAM with witty dialogue, fine plot
development, and an ending that actually seems remotely plausible. 
While he does let up with the terror in the final act (I won't be having
any nightmares tonight), I left pleasantly surprised and a bit shaken up
from so much jumping in my seat.  I'm sure you'll agree.  It's a...
well... a scream.</P>
