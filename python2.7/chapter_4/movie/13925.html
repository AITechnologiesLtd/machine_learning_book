<P>There are more classic lines in horror movies than in any other genre.
"I'll be right back , don't start without me!" comes to mind. Or how
about "Everybody stay calm!" and "Is somebody in there?" Classic lines
of dialogue , but the the award for best line ever in a horror movie
simply must go to Adam Arkin for his: "That's horrible! Take off your
clothes." </P>
<P>Unfortunately , that little tibbit from Halloween : H20 is the only
thing you'll remember about this movie years from now. Before going any
further I have to get this off my chest , mostly because it's one of the
few good things I have to say about H20 : if you can stand a full hour
of bad acting , half a dozen false alarms , several cheap "it was just a
cat , dog , bird , man , girl , car , bell , phone , door , window ,
glass...etc etc..." moments...then you can look foward to a thirty
minute long cat and mouse chase between Laurie Strode and Mike Myers. Is
it worth that long a wait? Yes. Barely. </P>
<P>H20's final half hour contains more truly scary scenes than during the
entire length of Scream 2. No , that's not quite right : H20's final
half hour contains more truly CREEPY scenes. There are no jump out of
your seat scares but you will feel the hairs on the back of your neck
rise up. Micheal is more frightening than he as been in years , this is
definately not a guy you would want coming after you. Fans of the horror
genre , I include myself in that clique , will get a good vibe from
seing Jamie Lee Curtis once again in the genre that made her famous. </P>
<P>Luckily , she manages to hold the movie together for all the other
actors. The actor playing her son does a decent enough job , nothing
spectacular but at least I found him less annoying than the other teens.
This brings up an important question : why is it that psycho killers
always go after teens? As a teen myself , I find that pretty annoying.
Why should they always pick on us?! </P>
<P>Once , just once , I'd like to see ol' Jason or Michael go wacko in a
retirement home or one of those places in florida where old guys and
gals go. Stop picking on us! Anyway , it's not really that much of a
problem since you will want most of these teens dead anyway. People
often complain that horror movie teens are way too dumb...that's the
point! That way you don't feel too bad when they get chopped to pieces. </P>
<PRE>However , the gal I really wanted dead gets to live at the end of the
movie. 
Darn.</PRE>
<P>I'm speaking of Michelle Williams , of course. Will somebody tell me
what's wrong with her cheeks? 
( No , not those cheeks you perverts...)  She looks like she swallowed a
pair of balloons! And what's up with those eyebrows anyway? Yuck. Anyway
, she is one of those Dawson's Creek kids. That should tell you enough
about her acting.</P>
<P>Adding to the babe factor , an important factor in any good scary movie
, is Jodi Lyn O'Keefe. I wanted to hate her but her character gets to
die during H20's scariest scene , an exciting busboy chase , so she gets
brownie points for dying in a cool way. Boy , I bet Nash is gonna drive
the cuda right up Michael's butt when he hears what he did to Cassidy.</P>
<P>( If you don't get that one then you must not watch Nash Bridges. So
don't think about it too much. Moving on...)</P>
<P>Adam Arkin is wasted in a thankless role , maybe he took the role
because he wanted the chance to have Jamie Lee Curtis feed him some
candy. ( You'll know it when you see it. ) LL Cool J provides a little
comic relief , usually this type of character gets to die in some heroic
way in horror movies. In H20? Ever hear of friendly fire? </P>
<P>H20's biggest weakness is it's lack of any real surprise and several
plot holes. Of course the mother and her child don't get killed ,
children under the age of ten never get killed. See any previous
Halloween or Friday The 13th. Of course Jamie Lee does not hide in the
closet , that's why they showed us that flashback at the beginning of
the movie. </P>
<P>Can somebody explain this to me : the producers asked us to forget any
Halloween sequel after number 2 
( gladly! ) and told us that H20 is the only real sequel to Halloween 2.
Here's my problem : in Halloween 2 , Doctor Loomis dies in a blaze along
with Myers. Of course ,  Loomis was back in four-six with "serious
burns" but 3 to 6 never happened according to the producers. Thus ,
since Loomis is in fact dead since number 2 , why does a police man in
the doc's house  , twenty years later ,  says that doc loomis died "a
few years ago" and that he was living with a nurse?</P>
<P>How does it end , you ask? Badly. H20 does the unthinkable : it actually
kills it's monster! No , no , no...for real this time! I doubt even ol'
Mike Myers can repair a severed head. I actually felt bad for the guy.
Sniff. Final analysis: I was fast feeling asleep near the end of the
first house but my pulse was doing the rumba in my chest for the final
confrontation.</P>
<P>Rating: Three and a half stars out of Six for the chance to hear that
catchy theme one more time , a kick ass Jamie Lee Curtis , a thrilling
conclusion , overwhelmingly bad acting by the supporting cast , one butt
ugly blonde ( those eyebrows...those
cheeks....ewwww....must...resist...urge to pop....her...cheeks...) and a
"really big kitchen knife". </P>
<PRE>Warning:
 The line "That's horrible. Take off your clothes." actually does appear
during this movie. </PRE>
<PRE>                                play safe and have a good time ,
                                                        mATTHEW</PRE>
