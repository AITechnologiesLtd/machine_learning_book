<P>Title:  `Tarzan' beautiful to look at, easy to follow.</P>
<P>Review: Disney continues its trend of producing animated summer blockbuster 
movies meant mostly for children but with enough wit and charm for adults to 
be interested and at least entertained by the story.
        The basic premise is the same as every other `Tarzan' story: a boy is 
raised in the African jungle by gorillas and becomes one himself never really 
understanding (or even noticing) that he's human and is a lot different from 
the animals he befriends.
        The first third of the film shows how Tarzan comes to be adopted by 
Kala (voiced by Glen Close), a female gorilla who lost her own child in a 
classic case of Darwanism. Her mate, Kerchak (Henriksen), is a mean, 
conservative leader of the pack of gorillas who make up Tarzan's extended 
family. He refuses to acknowledge Tarzan (voiced by Alex D. Linz during the 
childhood scenes) as a son and often has to hold himself back from killing 
Tarzan after he continually does dangerous, wild things that are the result 
of his own childish instincts. I have a feeling children will quickly be able 
to identify with Tarzan since all he really is is just a kid who wants to 
have fun and it's funny how the adults fail to comprehend this.
        Later, as the story transitions from Tarzan as a child to a 
full-grown man (voiced by Goldwyn), he is encounter by a party of three 
humans from England: Jane Porter (Driver), a beautiful woman who is something 
of a zoologist and an artist, her father Prof. Archimedes Q. Porter (voiced 
by Nigel Hawthorne) who is also a scientist; and their slick and cunning, yet 
barbaric safari bodyguard Clayton (Blessed).
        It's easy to tell where the story is going at all times but the 
screenplay doesn't seem like it was written hastily nor dumbed down for 
children's enjoyment. Sure there's a lot of cliche stuff here, like Clayton's 
smugness and diabolical manipulation of Tarzan and Jane; the goofy supporting 
characters (voiced by Rosie O'Donnell [in full Brooklyn accent!] and Wayne 
Knight - `Hello Newman!').
        There's also a lot of fun action such as Tarzan's swinging through 
the jungle on vines and sliding down and around tree branches and trunks. 
It's just like skateboarding really fast and doing all sorts of tricks (those 
McDonald's commercials really prove this point).
        Ultimately, you get exactly out of `Tarzan' what you expect... and I 
mean that as a compliment, so have high expectations.</P>
<P>Pros: Animation and sound are a feast for the senses, story is lighthearted, 
breezy and not dumbed-down, no stupid sing-along songs to get stuck in your 
head.</P>
<P>Cons: Surprisingly violent, should have been rated PG. Young children may not 
understand some of the more adult themes (parents, be ready to have some 
heavy questions thrown your way). Running time is a bit short.</P>
<P>Would you recommend this to friends? Not to MY friends, but to the 
movie-going public I would.</P>
<P>Score: *** (out of ****) or 4 (out of 5 with no 0 rating).</P>
