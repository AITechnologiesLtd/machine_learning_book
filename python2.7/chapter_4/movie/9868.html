Starship Troopers - Space Cadets
by Homer Yen
(c) 1997</PRE>
<P>If you've ever seen any of Director Paul Verhoeven's other films such
as Total Recall, Basic Instinct or Showgirls, there is one common
thread that ties all of his work together.  That element can be
described as 'excess'.  True to his reputation, he is equally
relentless in his excessiveness here.  There is excessive violence,
there is excessive body counts, and there is excessive battling.  In
fact, it is my belief that Verhoeven has made it his personal crusade
to release movies that are just short of receiving an NC-17 rating.</P>
<P>Early on, you can sense that this will be a brutally disgusting movie.
For example, two of the main characters, Rico and Carmen, are in
biology class studying a 'bug' which is about the size of a small
refrigerator.  As they dissect, the students pull out the innards,
digging through the slime and ooze that protect the organs.  Carmen
barfs, and you might also too unless you've eaten way in advance.
Here at this educational institution, we also meet Diz, a feisty girl,
who has a crush on Rico and another friend Carl, who is extremely
intelligent.  One of the proudest things that these young adults can
do is to join the Federation, which is Earth's futuristic
intergalactic army.  Service guarantees citizenship, a highly sought
after social status.  After taking their tests, each goes their own
separate ways.  Diz and Rico wind up in the infantry.  Carmen becomes
a pilot, while Carl becomes a part of the military intelligence.
However, soon after, their separate lives begin to converge once again
as war breaks out with a bug-like species half way across the galaxy,
and it is up to these four and an array of other characters to take
part in the cosmic battle of their lives.  </P>
<P>Yet, while war and citizenship seemed incredibly important to the
characters on screen, the movie failed to involve me in their struggle
and their consternation towards their enemy.  And I believe that the
problem with this movie is two-fold.  First, our connection and
interest with the characters are mild at best.  As we watch the four
advance in skill and rank, I never, for one instant, really felt their
struggle or pain or jubilation.  Mainly, the writer decided that what
was more interesting was not how they coped with war, lost comrades,
or their overnight transformation from ordinary civilians to ruthless
fighters.  Here's an example.  The bugs are quickly advancing, and the
troop seems hopelessly outnumbered.  The Sergeant yells to Rico,
"You're my Corporal until you die or I find someone better!"  Instead,
our interest is tied to the love triangles and the subsequent
relationships that sprouted as a matter of consequence.  I felt that I
was watching a hybrid of Melrose Place and Deep Space 9.</P>
<P>The second factor was it's sheer excessiveness, which went beyond
satire and bordered on the absurd.  For example, to kill one bug, it
takes 4 soldiers and literally 2,000 rounds of ammo.  Human casualties
are in the hundreds of thousands.  But here's the really absurd thing.
You make your way to a fort that was decimated by the enemy.  Limbs
lie here and there, heads are decapitated, bodies are gored.  Everyone
has died a horrible death.  You know that the bugs are close by
waiting to kill you.  Do you leave immediately?  OR...do you set up
camp?  I'll let you decide.</P>
<P>Of course, this is a film about all-out war, so its boundaries are
somewhat confined.  The best thing about this film is the special
effects, which are spectacular, especially the scenes involving
Earth's space fleet being fired upon by plasma cannonballs (when you
learn the source of the cannonballs, you'll slap your palm to your
forehead and murmur how absurd that was too).  The 'bugs' are also
handsomely detailed.  If the story was only half as good as the
special effects, then they might have something more interesting than
a stalwart band of fighters that just shoot-shoot-shoot and
kill-kill-kill.  </P>
<P>Unfortunately, in his quest to take the 'R' rating to it's limits, he
forgets that it isn't just shock value or incredible effects that we
look for.  Bereft of pathos, the film ultimately becomes as
interesting as the enemy bugs that the Federation must battle.  It's
full speed ahead without thinking about what comes next, except
possibly knowing that it will be something excessively absurd.</P>
