<PRE>                                 A GOOFY MOVIE
                       A film review by Jeffrey Graebner
                        Copyright 1995 Jeffrey Graebner</PRE>
<P>     Last night, I attended a sneak preview of WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING
(a terrific film) and after the movie the theater manager announced
that the audience was welcome to stick around for the 9:20 showing of A
GOOFY MOVIE (of course, they did this after the credits so there were
only 3 or 4 of us that actually heard the announcement... <g>)</P>
<P>     The movie is kind of cute and I suspect young kids might like it
quite a bit, but I wasn't exceptionally impressed by it.  Goofy has
always been one of my favorite Disney characters.  His cheerful
ineptitude has a very definite charm and appeal.  My biggest
disappointment was the fact that Goofy was reduced to a supporting role
in a film that includes his name in the title.  Did Disney think that
kids today are unable to relate to and enjoy the film unless it is
centered around a kid?  When I was a kid, I never had any problems
enjoying Goofy on his own.</P>
<P>     I seem to recall that Disney had an afternoon TV series featuring
Goofy a few years ago, but I don't think I ever saw it.  Perhaps the
characters in this movie based on that series.  The movie seemed to be
lacking in a back story (the explanation of how Goofy became a single
parent seemed an obvious omission).  If the back story came from the TV
series, I suppose that might explain it.</P>
<P>     The film was made by Disney's animation studio in France.  Until
recently, that was their TV animation department, but they are now
simply known as "Disney Animation France" (meaning that they also do
features).  The animation doesn't have the same depth or detail of
Disney's major animated features, but it still is a generally good
looking film.  It is easily several cuts above most TV animation and
seemed to be on a par with most non- Disney animated features.  There
are a lot of bright colors and the characters are very expressive.  The
backgrounds generally tended to be flat and non-descript, though.</P>
<P>     I guess Disney has now decided that every animated film they do
has to be a musical, but many of the songs seemed to be shoehorned in
here. A few of them were kind of catchy, but they never quite seemed to
fit in extremely well.  The movie might have worked a bit better
without them.</P>
<P>     The movie is pleasant enough and it does have a number of amusing
sequences (my favorites were the parody of Disney's "Country Bear
Jamboree" attraction and the disco-dancing Bigfoot), but my overall
reaction was that I would have rather seen a movie strictly about the
Goofy of the old Disney short subjects.</P>
