STARTUP.COM
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>It may not rank with Alexander Graham Bell's idea of long distance voice 
communication, but the team at govWorks.com does have a vision.  They 
want citizens to be able to order fishing licenses at 3:15 A.M., attend 
town meetings in their underwear and pay parking tickets on-line.</P>
<P>STARTUP.COM, the engrossing and enlightening documentary about govWorks 
by Chris Hegedus and Jehane Noujaim, argues convincingly, if only by 
implication, that for the company's founders, Tom Herman and Kaleil 
Isaza Tuzman, it isn't about creating "insanely great" products, as 
Steve Jobs would say, but about making insanely large amounts of money.  
About the only song in the film is "Money (That's All I Want)," which 
just about sums up the approach of these two hard-working entrepreneurs.  </P>
<P>Tom, the technical lead, and Kaleil, the CEO, have been best buddies 
since high school.  Like brothers, they talk to the company's employees 
and to each other about their mutual "love."  Although this isn't a 
fictional story, the decline of their mutual affection takes on 
Shakespearean proportions when their dot-com begins a rapid descent into 
a dot-bomb.  Although they each have their own families and loved ones, 
which we see in glimpses, their bond is just like a marriage.  When Tom 
starts talking about how he has always viewed himself as being a co-CEO, 
you can hear the offstage corporate divorce lawyers sharpening their 
pencils.</P>
<P>We follow the company by tagging along with Tom, Kaleil or both, as they 
go from nothing to $50 million in VC funding in a few months and as 
their staff bloats up past 300.  There probably are worker bees toiling 
away in the background who passionately believe in their product, but 
what we see are a couple of 28-year-old guys who dream of getting rich.  
Kaleil, who hobnobs on TV with everyone from President Clinton on down, 
seems on a trajectory to billionaire status.  A comment from one 
employee, who believes himself destined to be a mere multi-millionaire, 
hints of possible resentment over the size of Kaleil's options package.</P>
<P>But before Kaleil and Tom become as rich as Croesus, there are a few 
problems to be dealt with.  The Web site that they assume will make them 
all wealthy isn't a focus of the movie or the management until the end.  
"The VCs are not in this for charity," Kaleil warns over his cell phone.  
When they should be ramping up slowly and paying attention to their 
product and their business plan, Kaleil and Tom are out hustling money.  
At one point, Kaleil tries to work in some time to get more involved 
with the product he is pedaling, but he and Tom can't figure out when 
that would be.  Both of them are likable guys who you want to win but 
who seem headed for disaster.  </P>
<P>On April 14, 2000, the anniversary of the day that the Titanic struck 
the infamous iceberg, the NASDAQ crashes dramatically.  A savvy Kaleil 
immediately sees the writing on the wall.  Just like the movie TITANIC, 
STARTUP.COM is fascinating even if we feel certain that the company will 
sink in the end.  Whatever you do, don't leave before the ending credits 
which tells you the status of the company, what happened to Kaleil and 
Tom's friendship and what they're doing now.  Expect to see these guys 
on the business talk shows again.  Maybe soon.  Who knows, as they say, 
"what goes down must come up."</P>
<P>STARTUP.COM runs 1:43.  It is rated R for brief language and would be 
acceptable for any kid old enough to be interested in the subject.</P>
