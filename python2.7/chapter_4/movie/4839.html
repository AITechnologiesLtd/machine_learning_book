<P>     FARGO takes the usual "caper gone wrong" storyline and applies a 
new twist.  Based on a series of true events from 1987, the film 
examines what can happen when the police and criminals are equally dim-
witted.  The product of the Coen brothers' fertile (and twisted) minds, 
FARGO represents one of their least ambitious screenplays to date.  Even 
so, the finished product still bears several of their unmistakable 
trademarks, including atypical humor and an unmistakable visual flair.</P>
<P>     In many ways, FARGO is a departure for the Coens.  Their previous 
films, especially BLOOD SIMPLE, MILLER'S CROSSING, BARTON FINK, and THE 
HUDSUCKER PROXY, were stylistic treats, filled with offbeat characters 
and amazing images.  FARGO, on the other hand, is a more restrained 
picture.  Perhaps because it is based on non-fictional events, the Coens 
decided to tone down their approach.  Cinematographer (and long-time 
Coen collaborator) Roger Deakins relies primarily on traditional shots, 
and the characters are designed to be more "normal."</P>
<P>     FARGO opens, appropriately enough, in Fargo, North Dakota, with a 
meeting between Minnesota car salesman Jerry Lundegaard (William H. 
Macy) and two local thugs, Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear 
Grimsrud (Peter Stormare).  Jerry wants this pair to kidnap his wife, 
then ransom her for $80,000.  While Jerry doesn't have that kind of 
money (in fact, he's strapped for cash), his father-in-law, Wade 
Gustafson (Harve Presnell), does.  When the cash is paid out, Jerry is 
supposed to receive a 50% cut, as well as the safe return of his wife.  
That way, everyone except Wade comes out ahead.  Unfortunately, with two 
such incompetent crooks, things are bound to go wrong, and Carl and 
Gaear are soon leaving a trail of dead bodies behind them.  A local cop, 
Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand), is given the task of investigating 
the murders, and it's only with an amazing assist from fate that she 
ends up on the right track.</P>
<P>     A current of absurd humor runs through FARGO.  Even though the 
story is based on true events, it's hard to take certain aspects of this 
movie seriously.  Like David Lynch, the Coens are fascinated with what 
lurks behind the white picket fences of middle America.  In FARGO, 
everyone falls into one of two categories -- the motivated (who are 
greedy, duplicitous, or homicidal) or the simpleminded (everyone else).</P>
<P>     The problem with FARGO is that there aren't any substantial 
characters.  Everyone, from the overwrought Jerry to the methodical 
Marge, is a pure caricature.  None of these people are particularly 
interesting or sympathetic, and watching their exploits becomes a 
detached experience.  By the end of the film, you're more interested in 
how the filmmakers choose to tie together loose ends than whether any 
particular individual lives or dies.  In the past, the Coens have 
managed to create characters worth caring about; such is not the case 
here, and it greatly diminishes FARGO's effectiveness.</P>
<P>     Born and raised in Minnesota, the Coens know their home state, 
which accounts for their ability to reflect reality there (which is like 
unreality for most of the rest of the country).  People say things like 
"You're darn tootin'", "aw, geez," and "what the heck".  Knowing how 
strange the talk of Minnesotans will seem to the rest of the world, the 
Coens intentionally play it for deadpan comic effect.</P>
<P>     It's easy to admire what the Coens are trying to do in FARGO, but 
more difficult to actually like the film.  The absence of viable 
characters limits any dramatic impact, making this more of an 
intellectual exercise than a complete motion picture experience.</P>
