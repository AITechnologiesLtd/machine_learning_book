<P>        On one level, "The Story of Us" plays like one of those shallow
"dramedies" that turn up regularly on the Lifetime network. Most of the
pain it exposes is surface level, the conflicts often feel manufactured
and the comic elements writers Alan Zweibel and Jessie Nelson have
shoehorned into their script generally operate at cross-purposes with
the overall theme of the film.</P>
<P> Yet somehow the movie comes close to hitting its mark
nonetheless. That's largely due to the combined star power of Michelle
Pfeiffer and Bruce Willis, and also to some genuinely evocative patches
in Zweibel and Nelson's screenplay. Every time "Story" wanders
perilously close to the border of soap opera, the authors steer it back
on course.</P>
<P> Although the subject matter -- an upper-middle-class couple
drifting straight for the rocks -- inspires memories of such searing
break-up dramas as Diane Keaton and Albert Finney's "Shoot the Moon" or
the classic "Two For the Road" with Finney and Audrey Hepburn, the
glossy execution of "Story" recalls last Christmas' "Stepmom," another
attempt to address a difficult subject in a crowdpleasing manner.
"Stepmom" was a bit more effective than this film because it focused
mostly on the young woman (Julia Roberts) trying to find her place in
her husband's family and the ex-wife (Susan Sarandon) struggling to hold
on to a world she was no longer intimately a part of.</P>
<P> "Story" is more scattershot, and while we may root for Kate
(Pfeiffer) and Ben (Willis) Jordan to overcome their differences and
rekindle that old flame, we'd be cheering more enthusiastically if the
movie had let us get a better sense of their history together. What it
presents instead are flashes of events major and minor, from the time
Ben and Kate tried to get it on on the kitchen counter to the death of
their son's goldfish.</P>
<P> The rest of the movie shifts a bit uneasily between some nasty
marital arguments and several quirky discussions between Kate and Ben
and their friends, played by comedians such as Paul Reiser, Rita Wilson
(who gets to do a reprise of her weeping fit from "Sleepless in
Seattle"), Julie Hagerty and Reiner himself. A lot of this talk is
undeniably amusing ("the Ten Commandments were probably a lot easier to
stick to when you dropped dead at 35," Reiser's character moans), but it
also serves to severely dilutes whatever impact the main story might
have. The jokey segments tend to stop the picture cold, often just as
it's building some momentum.</P>
<P> The gimmick of having characters speak directly to the audience
is currently being done to death both in movies and on TV, but it works
surprisingly well here, as Ben and Kate's confessions turn out to be
among the film's strongest bits. At one point, Kate compares her
relationship with her husband to the children's book "Harold and the
Purple Crayon," explaining that Harold was always determined to create
his own perfect environment. "When one person is always drawing the
world the way they want it to be, the other person has to draw the world
the way it is," she sighes, "which is probably why they never wrote a
book about Harold's wife."</P>
<P> There's also a certain poignancy in Ben and Kate's careful
conversations about whether or not their kids are "O.K.," as well as in
the borderline ridiculous excuses they make for calling each other
during a period of separation.</P>
<P> The movie's ultimate trump card, however, is a breathless,
delirious monologue Kate delivers near the end. It's a moment that might
have been insufferable in the hands of a less skilled actress, but
Pfeiffer makes the words ring with hurt, humor and pure emotion. "The
Story of Us" has more than its share of aggravating bits and empty
scenes, but the finale manages to tip the scales in its favor. James
