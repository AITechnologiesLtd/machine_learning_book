<P>     By trying to satisfy every kind of viewer, it's possible that 
SPHERE may end up pleasing no one.  Action lovers will be bored by what 
they will see as an interminably boring setup.  Audience members who 
crave more intellectual fare will be disgusted by the film's sudden 
collapse into mindless storytelling and by the ending, which is an 
insulting cop-out.  Somewhere out there, maybe there's a small cadre of 
film-goers who will appreciate SPHERE's dubious charms, but I'm not 
among them.</P>
<P>     I sincerely hope the novel is better than the movie (I no longer 
read anything by either Michael Crichton or John Grisham), because if 
the finished motion picture product is anything to go by, it's hard to 
understand why the rights were optioned.  SPHERE is the kind of first-
class mess that only a top-line director with an A-list cast can create.  
With expectations high (And how could they not be, considering that 
another Barry Levinson/Dustin Hoffman collaboration, the excellent WAG 
THE DOG, is still playing in theaters?), something this bad can't help 
but look even worse.  The last time a big-name, big-budget film 
displayed this level of ineptitude was last year's BATMAN & ROBIN, and 
everyone knows how that movie was received.</P>
<P>     SPHERE starts out a little like an amalgamation of CONTACT and 
James Cameron's THE ABYSS, but, somewhere along the way, it collapses 
into the cellar with another recent science fiction effort, EVENT 
HORIZON.  Science and philosophy, which are used to good effect during 
SPHERE'S first hour, give way to mindless, confusing action sequences.  
Attempts at characterization fall apart.  Intelligent writing, which is 
evident early on, is replaced by hackneyed drivel.  Special effects take 
over as the plotline devolves into incoherent silliness.  But all that 
is just in preparation for the ending, which is inexcusably awful.  This 
is the time-honored deus ex machina device used to its worst effect.  I 
left the theater feeling cheated by the way Crichton and his 
screenwriters had chosen to end the film.</P>
<P>     There is some promise, but it's all in the setup.  We're introduced 
to Norman Goodman (Dustin Hoffman), a psychologist who once wrote a 
$35,000 report for the government about what to do in the event that a 
crashed space ship is discovered.  When one is found in the middle of 
nowhere, 1000 feet below the surface of the Pacific Ocean, Norman is 
called in to be part of the welcoming committee.  On the team with him 
are Beth Halperin (Sharon Stone), a biochemist who was once his student 
and lover; Harry Adams (Samuel L. Jackson), a mathematician who earned 
his first doctorate at the age of 18; Ted Fielding (Liev Schreiber), an 
astrophysicist who is awed by the opportunity to explore alien 
technology; and Harold Barnes (Peter Coyote), the government operative 
in charge of the mission.  Together, the five descend into the bowels of 
the ocean, where they rendezvous with a temporary sea base on the ocean 
floor from which they will attempt to make first contact.</P>
<P>     For a while, SPHERE had me fooled into thinking it was going to 
take an astute approach to the man-meets-alien situation.  The overall 
scenario is not without promise and several plot twists (such as the 
revelation that the enormous craft is actually an American space ship, 
apparently from the future) offer intriguing possibilities.  Then, right 
around the one-hour mark (that's the time to sneak into the theater next 
door and check out whatever's left of TITANIC), the virtually non-stop 
action begins, and, once it starts, the script becomes superfluous.  
This might be acceptable if director Levinson generated some legitimate 
tension, but, instead, he relies on loud, overbearing music, strange 
camera angles, and quick cuts to make things "exciting."  Additionally, 
because none of the characters are well-formed (a common failing in 
anything penned by Crichton, who's more interested in technology than 
people), viewers don't develop much of a rooting interest.  It makes 
sitting through SPHERE a frustrating and pointless experience.</P>
<P>     What about that A-list cast?  Not surprisingly, the most energetic 
performance is given by Samuel L. Jackson, but his Harry isn't a person; 
he's a walking plot device spouting occasionally-witty dialogue.  Dustin 
Hoffman isn't lively or particularly good -- it's ironic that this, 
which may be his worst work in a decade, has arrived in theaters on the 
heels of his Best Actor nomination (for WAG THE DOG).  Sharon Stone and 
Peter Coyote are both flat.  Their characters exhibit little evidence of 
emotion; automatons would have been as effective.  Then there's Queen 
Latifa, who, despite getting fifth billing in the credits (ahead of Liev 
Schreiber, who boasts at least quadruple her screen time), has less than 
a handful of lines and almost nothing to do other than inflate the body 
count.  </P>
<P>     I like to think that Levinson and Hoffman, recognizing how 
uninspired this movie was likely to be, chose to make WAG THE DOG as a 
sort of penance (the low-budget picture was filmed during SPHERE's 
lengthy pre-production phase).  If that's the case, forgiveness is 
granted.  I'm less inclined to look favorably upon Crichton, although he 
has a few enjoyable titles on his resume (JURASSIC PARK and the 
Levinson-directed DISCLOSURE come to mind).  Even if his novel was 
butchered in the adaptation process, Crichton's credit as a producer 
disallows him absolution.  He was a willing participant in a creative 
travesty.  No wonder SPHERE is being released in February, in the midst 
of the early year's cinematic wasteland.  It deserves no better than to 
get sunk by the unstoppable TITANIC, which should plow SPHERE under on 
its way to a ninth-consecutive weekend atop the box office heap.</P>
