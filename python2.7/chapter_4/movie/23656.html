<P>"Waking the Dead," an overwrought, underdeveloped story of a young
politician (Billy Crudup) in the '80s having visions of his
presumed-dead, activist girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly) from the '70s, is
one of the most annoying films I have endured in years. Rather than
waste valuable composition time following the standard review format,
I've decided to simply list some of the reasons why.</P>
<P>A) Time travel abuse: The movie leaps between the '70s and '80s so often
that I began to wonder if Dramamine works for temporal motion sickness.
Not since "Slaughterhouse Five" have characters been so unstuck in time.
But while the time jumping in "Slaughterhouse Five" was an integral part
of the story, it only serves to fracture "Waking the Dead," robbing the
film of any emotional cohesiveness.</P>
<P>B) Tired premise: It's love at first sight when fiercely dedicated
counterculture zealot Sarah Williams meets starchy Fielding Pierce, who
believes in working within the system. My, what an inventive concept.
Not since, oh… any typical episode of "Dharma and Greg" has such a
radical dynamic been so thoughtfully explored.</P>
<P>C) Lame leads: She gives speeches and makes meaningful eye contact. He
gives speeches and whines. I get squirmy and check my watch.</P>
<P>D) Lack of chemistry: While both actors have shown promise in previous
cinematic outings, Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly's performances
here are painfully forced. Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley were
more convincing lovers than this pair.</P>
<P>E) The dialogue: "I don't know what I'm going to say, what I'm going to
do, from one minute to the next,' moans Fielding. "Sometimes meaningless
gestures are all we have," Sarah intones somberly. I'm amazed that one
of them didn't blurt out "Love means never having to say you're sorry."</P>
<P>F) Billy Crudup's feet: After spending considerable time padding
barefoot around Sarah's bohemian pad, Fielding lies down on the bed and
we see the pink, squeaky-clean bottoms of his feet. In the real world, a
brief walk across any hardwood floor would leave at least a bit of
visible dirt. Of course, had the story been even mildly involving, I
wouldn't have noticed.</P>
<P>G) Endless posing: Intimate scenes are undermined by director Keith
Gordon's insistence on artful placement of the character's bodies. Nude
shots of Crudup and Connelly have the actors' forms oh-so-carefully
positioned, covering their genitals while making them look less like
lovers and more like chintzy erotic sculptures.</P>
<P>H) The hippie brother and his psychedelic office: Paul Hipp overacts
shamelessly as Fielding's brother, a counterculture publisher. Even more
ridiculous is his tripped-out office, the least convincing hippie set
I've seen since Samantha's wacky cousin Serena went club hopping on
"Bewitched."</P>
<P>I) Stereotypes galore: While Paul Hipp is the most glaring of the
walking stereotypes, talented actors like Hal Holbrook, Janet McTeer and
Sandra Oh are also wasted playing animated clichés.</P>
<P>J) The "Is she or isn't she?" gimmick: A decade after the reported death
of his honey-bunny, Fielding begins catching glimpses of her everywhere.
Are these hallucinations brought on by guilt and longing or did Sarah
fake her death for some political purpose, only to resurface to seek out
her lost love? By the time the answer was revealed, I didn't give a
damn. Gordon's handling of the gimmick makes one appreciate the skilled
choreography of "The Sixth Sense" all the more.</P>
<P>K) Election night: Sure, "Waking the Dead" is a low budget film, but the
lack of bodies at Fielding's campaign headquarters on election night is
embarrassing. Surely the filmmakers could have bought a few cases of
beer and lured enough buddies over to fill up the room.</P>
<P>L) The "Second Stage at Lilith Fair" Soundtrack: The film is packed with
cut-rate crooning from sensitive young women with acoustic guitars.
Quick, grab a pellet gun!</P>
<P>M) Fading to white: Gordon repeatedly ends scenes by fading to white, an
effect that grows old quickly and serves only to amplify the fragmented
nature of the production.</P>
<P>N) Fake snow: There's a lot of snow in this movie and, while much of it
appears genuine, that stuff falling on the actors looks suspiciously
like Ore-Ida Instant Potato flakes. If you can't find the real thing, or
at least secure the use of a decent snowmaking machine, don't bother.</P>
<P>It would be easy to finish the alphabet, but you get the point. "Waking
the Dead" is excruciating. I had to attend – it's in my job description.
But you, oh lucky reader, you get to make a choice.</P>
