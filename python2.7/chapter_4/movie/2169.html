<P>It's 1996 and Los Angeles has become a war zone.  The Hollywood sign is 
on fire, and the rest of the city is in worse shape.  Into this situation 
comes one of LA's most feared cops, John Spartan, the "demolition man" 
(Sylvester Stallone), an officer who will destroy a $7 million building 
to save one little girl's life.  His nemesis is sadistic psycho Simon 
Phoenix (Wesley Snipes) who kills for the joy of it.  In a seven-minute, 
action-filled prologue, Good Guy chases Bad Guy through a burning, 
exploding inferno.  Alas, however, even though our valiant hero captures 
his prey, he gets blamed for the deaths of innocent hostages, and, like 
the evil villain he pursued, is sentenced to many years in cryogenic 
captivity.  </P>
<P>Shift the scene to 2032.  Bad Guy has escaped and the peace-loving cops 
of the decade have released Good Guy prematurely from his sleep, because 
he's the only one who can stop the sudden spree of death and mayhem.  
Accompanied by his partner Love Interest (aka Lenina Huxley, played by 
Sandra Bullock), Good Guy again sets off in pursuit.  Many dead bodies, 
bruises, torn shirts, and explosions later, we in the audience start to 
feel that this film is going absolutely nowhere, and taking an awfully 
long time getting there.</P>
<P>Actually, it probably isn't as bad as all that, but the plot of this 
movie is too obviously just an idiotic framework upon which to hang the 
numerous action sequences that push DEMOLITION MAN forward.  Although 
essentially pointless and ultimately repetitious, these are occasionally 
entertaining.  The tedious part is when an attempt is made to create a 
story around the shoot-outs and explosions.</P>
<P>For something like this to work, suspension of disbelief is necessary, 
yet the movie makes no attempt to create a viable scenario whereby this 
can be achieved.  The world of 2032 is cartoon-like, with silly, stilted 
dialogue peppered with awkward-sounding slang (perhaps a linguist should 
have been consulted), and technological achievements that are better-
suited to one-hundred years beyond this time.  The brief history lesson 
we're given of the years between 1996 and 2032 tells a tale that is so 
ludicrous it's laughable.</P>
<P>Laughter is something that DEMOLITION MAN is good at generating but, as 
you can probably guess, most of the funniest bits are supposed to be 
serious.  Assuredly, the movie tries for a fair amount of comic relief, 
but those moments are mostly comprised of juvenile gags and one-liners.  
It's incidents like when Wesley Snipes gets whacked twice with a TV set 
and barely suffers a bruise that make up the real humor.</P>
<P>All-in-all, this is about as brainless as action films get.  There might 
have been some attempt to imitate elements of TOTAL RECALL, but most of 
this seems to have gotten lost someplace in the numerous re-writes.  
There's a subplot about Good Guy's lost daughter that also gets dropped.  
My pet theory is that she was supposed to be Sandra Bullock, but when the 
decision was made to create Love Interest, that part of the story got 
stripped away.  After all, it wouldn't do to have intimations of incest 
in a straightforward action flick.  All we need in a Stallone movie are 
fights and profanity.</P>
<P>Speaking of profanity, one of the few running gags that works (at least 
in the beginning - it gets annoying with repetition) is a "Big Brother" 
machine that fines people for incidents of swearing.  Also a source of 
mild amusement is the fascination of the people of 2032 with 20th century 
commercial jingles.  "I Wish I Was an Oscar Meyer Wiener" is a big hit. </P>
<P>It's about as meaningless to talk about acting as characterization.  
Sylvester Stallone grunts and flexes his muscles.  Wesley Snipes grimaces 
and bares his pearly-whites (and what's the deal with that awful blonde 
hairdo?).  Sandra Bullock proves just how silly her dialogue is.  And 
Denis Leary is Denis Leary, doing his slick fast-talking routine and 
seeming completely out of place (you keep waiting for the multi-nicknamed 
Deion Sanders to show up).</P>
<P>Yes, this film is worse than CLIFFHANGER, Stallone's last venture into 
chaos.  And, while I'm not one to leap forward and extol the limitless 
virtues of TOTAL RECALL, that motion picture is a masterpiece in 
comparison to this one.  At least there, the future was believable.  
Here, it's a hopelessly cliched place where the explosions can 
conveniently be boosted by a few nifty (but not especially original) 
special effects.</P>
<P>In the end, that's all this film is:  flames, flying bullets, and special 
effects.  It could be worse, I suppose, but as long as people go into 
this film with their eyes open, there shouldn't be any surprises.  And if 
there's one lasting question to carry away from DEMOLITION MAN, it's how 
Arnold Schwarzenegger could become President of the United States, sixty-
first amendment notwithstanding.</P>
