<PRE>Pecker (R) *** 1/2
Starring Edward Furlong, Christina Ricci
Directed by John Waters
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>John Waters has been known to make comic masterpieces. Well, perhaps not
masterpieces, but he's still known to make movies that are pretty darn funny,
and this film is no exception. It's sort of a documentary of people who live
their lives a little differently from our own, what becomes of it, and how it's
viewed by the outside world.</P>
<P>Pecker (Furlong, a very wise casting choice) is obsessed with taking photos of
everything around him. In the opening scene, he goes through an entire roll of
film while sitting on the bus. His girlfriend is Shelly, (Ricci) she runs a
laundromat and poses often for his work. He also knows a thief named Matt,
(Brad Sexton III) and he films him stealing things from the supermarket. </P>
<P>One day when Pecker (known for the way he eats, like a bird) has displayed some
of his work in the sub shop that he works at, a New York art gallery owner
(Lili Taylor) walks in and is overcome with enthusiasm, because she's found a
new talent. The art world is set on fire with Pecker's visions of small town
life, but their interests and influences, soon find his way of life becoming
more and more like theirs.</P>
<P>The film is very, very funny. Only mastermind Waters could dream up an old
woman that gives a voice to her statue of the Virgin Mary, (if this is giving
you major question marks or if you have other inquiries just rent it) not to
mention a young girl that snorts sugar and vegetables like drugs. Other
characters like this are present to give the film even more wackiness than
recent comedies.</P>
<P>Pecker does have some problems though. There are countless sex and nudity
scenes (strip clubs, angry lesbian strippers, etc.) there aren't really needed
and warrant the film a higher rating than it deserves. Most of the film feels
implausible, and some dialog and situations seem forced. Performances are good
all around with Furlong (who is shaped up to become a big actor) and Brad
Sexton III leading the pack. Do you enjoy funny movies? Of course you do! So
see Pecker, which gets ***1/2 stars.</P>
<P>The Young-Uns: The film contains female nudity and several scenes in a gay
strip club with lots of men in thongs. The film also contains several bad
attitudes towards people and authorities. Good Age: 15 & Up</P>
