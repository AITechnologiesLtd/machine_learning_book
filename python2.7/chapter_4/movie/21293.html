<P>I thought that I could go a bit further into the New Year (or at least
further into January) before I saw a film worse than Firestorm.  Boy,
was I ever wrong.</P>
<P>Now, I've read about 10 or 12 Dean Koontz books, but I don't think that
Phantoms was one of them.  The reason for my uncertainty is that most of
his work is pretty much the same.  I stopped reading Koontz for that
very reason.  He's Stephen King light.  And to make things more
frightening, the films made from his stories are turning out to be worse
than King's adaptations.</P>
<P>Phantoms is set in a small Colorado town where Jenny, the local doctor
(Joanna Going) has taken Lisa, her younger sister (Rose McGowan) home so
she could spend some quality time away from her alcoholic mother.
Driving into town, they notice that things seem very quiet.  Too quiet,
in fact.</P>
<P>To make matter worse, Jenny's housekeeper is all dead when they get
home.  The phone is dead and the car won't start, so Jenny and Lisa hoof
it to the police station, where they find (gasp) everyone dead.  Sound
creepy yet?  Didn't think so.</P>
<P>Eventually, some other cops (Ben Affleck and Liev Schreiber) come by
to…to…well, apparently just to read some really bad lines.  If they
wanted to make things REALLY scary, they would have taken a tape measure
to Schreiber's head.  That is one huge melon.  It's bigger than Billy
Corgan's and nearly as big as Rosie O'Donnell's.</P>
<P>The scenes that are supposed to be scary are just sad.  They are cut
together very poorly and lit even worse.  You can't really tell what's
happening or whom it's happening to.  That's why I spent most of the
movie imagining what McGowan (Scream and The Doom Generation) would look
like riding naked on my Kenmore vacuum cleaner.</P>
<P>By the time the evil expert Timothy Flyte (Peter O'Toole) shows up, I
was completely gone mentally.  So were about 15 people who got up and
left during my screening.  They were the lucky ones and I cursed them as
I drove home.</P>
<P>Nobody in the theater jumped, screamed or even inhaled suddenly.  It was
almost like they pumped carbon monoxide into the theater to quell the
teaming masses.  They didn't need to.  Phantoms is just plain bad
filmmaking.</P>
