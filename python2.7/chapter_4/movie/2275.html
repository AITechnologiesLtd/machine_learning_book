<PRE>                            ADDAMS FAMILY VALUES
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1993 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  In a second-rate plot punctuated by
     some first-rate jokes, the new Addams Family film tells the
     story of what happens when a new baby and a murderous nanny
     come to the Addams household.  Lots of funny gags in the
     ghoulish Addams style fail to save the rather uninteresting
     plot.  Rating +1 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     Yes, it's time for another visit to the little house out in the middle
of nowhere, the Addams House.  Perhaps it is out in the middle of nowhere
because nobody could stand to move next to the Addams, or perhaps it was
once a thriving neighborhood before the darling Addams children were let
loose on it.  In either case, back are Gomez (Raoul Julia), Morticia
(Angelica Huston), Uncle Fester (Christopher Lloyd), Wednesday (Christina
Ricci), Thing (Francis Ingram), and the rest of the Addams clan.  The
characters are based on those of the television series which in turn were
inspired by the ghoulish New Yorker cartoons of Charles Addams.
Unfortunately that sums up the strengths and weaknesses of the new film and
its predecessor.  Magazine cartoons have no plot at all, just quick-punch
jokes.  Where the two Addams Family films are their strongest is in the
quick-punch jokes.  When the film tries to advance a plot it loses most of
its energy and humor, and tells a rather weak story.  It is only when the
story-telling comes to a full halt for the sake of a joke that the film is
really funny.</P>
<P>     This time around the Addams have a new baby and little Wednesday and
Pugsley decide to execute the little thing as ghoulishly as possible to
protect the status quo.  To keep peace in the family Gomez and Morticia hire
a nanny who turns out to be a Black Widow murderess (Joan Cusack) out to
marry and kill Uncle Fester for his fortune.  Did I miss something?  The
plot calls for Fester to be rich and famous.  I do not remember that ever
being part of the plot before this outing.  The story also calls for
Wednesday and Pugsley to go to Summer Camp.  So we flash back and forth
between the Addams at home, a married-to-a-killer subplot, and a Wednesday-
and-Pugsley-make-a-shambles-of-a-Summer-Camp subplot.  The two subplots have
been done better as full-length films in the past.  There is also an
equation of Wednesday's and Pugsley's eccentricities with positive political
correctness.  The latter really was a fiasco and threatens to torpedo the
whole spirit of the series.</P>
<P>     Still, when it is just showing little vignettes that could have come
from Addams cartoons, it is terrific.  We have very little impression of
what Addams characters are like between the little flashbulb glimpses we get
from the cartoons, so Huston's and Julia's performances are based on the
interpretations of John Astin and Carolyn Jones.  It is not easy to outdo an
actor at a popular role that actor created.  That is like trying to do
Inspector Clouseau better than Peter Sellers.  But Julia and Huston actually
outdo Astin and Jones at their own game.  This is a film with big ups and
big downs so overall it gets just a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.  (My apologies
to Christopher Hart who did such a good job as Thing.  Attributing the part
to Ingram was something of an inside joke though I doubt that anyone will
recognize the reference to Francis Ingram.  Anyone want to try to identify
that name?)</P>
