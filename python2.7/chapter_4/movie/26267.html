Noah Taylor</P>
<P>After his tremendous success with JERRY MAGUIRE, writer\director Cameron 
Crowe was given a reasonably big budget, final cut and major studio backing 
to make ALMOST FAMOUS, the most personal of his films. It's a situation 
similar to the one Paul Thomas Anderson found himself in after BOOGIE NIGHTS 
(which was more of a critical darling than a huge success). Anderson chose to 
follow that up with MAGNOLIA, a film that displayed the fervency and scope of 
his earlier picture but was also granted leeway to include some artistic 
gambits that might've been frowned upon by studio heads. Some of them worked 
(I kinda dug the frogs, so sue me) and some of them didn't quite work (the 
musical interlude for instance, though I know people who disagree) but even 
the worst of his stratagems were sorta interesting for you could so clearly 
see the passion brimming behind them. With all that freedom Cameron Crowe has 
constructed a movie that's like the filmic equivalent of a classic rock song 
by Led Zepplin or The Doors. It's rambling, warm, whimsical, observant, and 
with a tinge of melancholy, though nothing that rudely announces itself via 
PATCH ADAMS-like obscene sentimentality.</P>
<P>ALMOST FAMOUS is Crowe's semi-autobiographical story of a fifteen year old 
prodigy, William Miller (newcomer Patrick Fugit, standing in for Cameron) 
who, on the encouragement of rock critic Lester Bangs (played with throaty 
charm by Phillip Seymour Hoffman), sets out to pursue a career as a rock 
writer. He manages to wrangle a freelance job with ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE and 
is sent on tour for several days with the about-to-hit rock band STILL WATER, 
headed by a low key Jim Morrison-type, Russell (Billy Crudup). Actually the 
lead singer is Bebe (Jason Lee, looking like Charles Manson's kinder, more 
docile brother), a whiny runt upstaged by Russell, the guitar player whose 
"looks are becoming a problem". Among them are the hanger ons, or groupies, 
seemingly led by uber-flower child Penny Lane (a sleepy eyed Kate Hudson).</P>
<P>The camera is just daffy over Hudson, or more likely Cameron is, for he 
trains it on her incessantly, caressing her pert, wide-open face as if it 
were an endangered monument. Penny comes with a bright all-knowing 
countenance, as if she were chock full of wisdom, though it's mostly an act 
to get Russell's attention. I'm not sure if this was the intent but I found 
Hudson's character to be more pathetic than loveable, though it hardly 
matters; she's an innocent seeking to meld herself with an image of cool. She 
is, of course, being used by Russell (who sleeps with her, then tosses her 
away like a used condom), which she may or may not be aware of. Penny chooses 
to see herself as something of a muse; it's her sex that inspires Russell to 
make the music she adores. A delusion, but a lovely one at that.</P>
<P>Other groupies include Faizura Balk as a scary-cool hipster and the apple pie 
Anna Paquin who says "lets deflower the boy" (referring to Fugit's William) 
and they do. Fugit is as doe eyed as they come, cherubic and cute though he 
doesn't make much of an impression but that's okay since he mostly serves as 
a tour guide to the other, more stimulating characters. Though still, the 
film suffers an itsy bit because it isn't endowed with a strong central 
character a la JERRY MAGUIRE or SAY ANYTHING. In the latter film, Crowe 
created a complete original with Lloyd Dobler (brought wonderfully to life by 
John Cusack), the oddly charming, hyper verbal sweetie that Cusack has been 
aping in some way or another his entire career (though I can hardly fault him 
for it, he does it so well). Fugit isn't nearly as memorable; in fact I'd 
probably have forgotten him had I not had to think about him in order to 
write this here review.</P>
<P>Hudson is a better character, an oxymoronic combo of giggly fangirl and 
blossoming independent; she's Crowe's most intriguing female creation. 
Meanwhile Russell, accurately played by Billy Crudup (JESUS' SON) as a 
regular guy inching towards the spotlight, (he's half prima donna, half "guy" 
guy) is more of a periphery character, as is Frances McDormand's mother and 
the quirkily named Zooey Deschanel the expressive actress who shows up in two 
scenes as William's older sister, rumpling his hair and cooing to him "Don't 
worry, someday you'll be cool". Even less a periphery character is the wildly 
charismatic Lester Bangs, played lovingly by Hoffman as a cynical dork 
savant. I would've loved to see a movie with this wily fellow as the 
protagonist, but he remains a brief, delightful presence, his screen time 
hardly totaling in at 5 minutes.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, those complaints are of mere crumbs amid a beatific cake; it's 
to Crowe's credit that he has us wishing we could spend more time with nearly 
every minor character. And ALMOST FAMOUS works to an equal to or greater 
degree than his past projects, none of which have been any less than good. 
(Even his much-derided SINGLES offered some insight into Gen X-ers, and I 
can't think of any other movie that came close to suggesting that this 
particular Generation was anything more than ironic, pop culture obsessed lay 
abouts).</P>
<P>ALMOST FAMOUS is as fun as JERRY MAGUIRE, but less muddled and without all 
that pesky soul searching. It has the infectious sweetness of SAY ANYTHING, 
though is visually much more confident. And there's also that zeal, the buzz 
you get when a filmmaker expresses his passions with the sure hand of a 
crackerjack veteran. Crowe is the rare mainstream director who loves his 
characters the way Paul Thomas Anderson loves his, and he's practically 
protective of them, as we become. For instance, the complete affection in 
which he gives us William's overprotective mother (whose mantra is "don't do 
drugs") is refreshing considering the adults in youth movies tend to be 
authoritative dolts. The character (played by Francis McDormand in pretty 
much the opposite of a shrill Shelly Winters performance) is a kind 
intellectual who wants her kids to read Shakespeare, and forbids them to 
listen to rock music because she desperately wants them to trek through life 
un-corrupted. As played by McDormand she's real hard not to like. Compare 
that to the hideous chain smoking, god loving, anti-rock caricature of a 
mother Lin Shaye played in DETROIT ROCK CITY, which, by the way, is similar 
in many respects to ALMOST FAMOUS except in how awfully stupid it is.</P>
<P>Here is a movie that loves its audience while most flicks come with barely 
concealed contempt for their audiences. And it also loves its music and the 
glorious, sometimes tragic effects of those melodies on the fans whose best 
memories are the amplified ones. Cameron captures this in a heartbreaking, 
silent ten seconds; he trains his camera on a prancing Kate Hudson, twirling 
about in a cleared out stadium amid floating litter. It's as if she just has 
to squeeze every last bit of energy she can from the showâ€¦even well after its 
end. Crowe has made a movie that cheerfully greets us with open arms as if to 
say "Welcome to the party". And what a party it is.</P>
