<PRE>                                 APOLLO 13
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        This is a brilliant piece of filmmaking. The directorial style 
shown by Ron Howard comes a long way from the hooker/corpse 
comedy NIGHT SHIFT and deftly mixes new footage with old 
newsreel shots and computer-animated effects. And the performances 
from Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon (in his best acting job since the 
original FIRDAY THE 13TH -- that's a joke, by the way), Gary Sinise, 
Ed Harris and the rest are great.</P>
<P>        So why's it only a three-star movie here? Well, it's in the 
same boat as QUIZ SHOW for me--a movie dramatization based on a 
true-life event from the distant past (distant meaning before I was 
born). It's good drama, but it has no personal meaning for me. I'm only 
17 years old. Now if it was based on an earth-shattering event from my 
lifetime, say the Gulf War or the tragic transition of "Saturday Night 
Live" from funny to godawful, I might be able to drum up some 
emotion. But for now, I see APOLLO 13 as a compelling yet flawed movie.</P>
<P>        For starters, the first thirty or more minutes of the film are 
way too boring and unnecessary. Do we really need to see the homelife 
of the astronauts and their three months of training and preparation 
for the Apollo 13 mission? No, just tell us they're astronauts and get 
to the actual flight. It's this early, expendable stuff I don't like. It's 
supposed to make us get to know and care for the characters, but what 
it does is make us get sick of them toward the end, when the movie's 
running long, and hope they'll get sucked into the vacuum of space so 
the movie will be over.</P>
<P>        If you're somehow ignorant of the movie's plot, Hanks, Bacon 
and some other guy are astronauts on a routine moon mission fraught 
with tragedy. (I think that was the first time in my life I ever used the 
word "fraught.") It's based on the actual week in 1969 when the nation 
held its breath for our Apollo 13 astronauts, stuck in space after a 
freak explosion screwed up their controls. The odds are infinitessimal 
that they'll make it back to earth alive, so each step of the journey is 
milked for all the suspense it can get. Then, when they finally do make 
it past that individual obstacle, a new obstacle arises to take it's place, 
obstacle after obstacle until the end of the movie.</P>
<P>        Forgive the skimpy plot summary, but everyone's already seen 
this movie. I, in fact, was the second-to-last person in America to see 
it. So if the other guy's out there, e-mail me and I'll send you a longer 
summary. Plus I'm writing this at two in the morning, which also 
explains the lapses in coherency from time to time. But don't allow my 
three paragraphs of criticism to keep you from seeing a good movie. 
I'm in a unique position as a movie reviewer who's too young to fully 
appreciate the historical context of some movies. Now, if they'd make 
that docudrama tracing the decline of "Saturday Night Live" I was 
talking about...</P>
