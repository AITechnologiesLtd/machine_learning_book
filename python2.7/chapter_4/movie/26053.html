<P>Teen movies became somewhat bothersome in the past two years, we've had so 
many with "10 Things I Hate About You", "Never Been Kissed", and "She's All 
That" just to name a few, plus three flops that came out this year. The bad 
thing about these films is that they follow the same teen movie routine: Boy 
and girl in high school, boy fights with girl, girl gets mad at boy, boy goes 
to prom and makes up with girl and then a bubble-gum pop song plays at the 
end. I had alot of hope for this movie, and to my surprise I was not 
disappointed. "Bring It On" has a great cast of female characters who bring 
out the clever dialogue in a great fashion. The chemistry they have on-screen 
together is so much fun. </P>
<P>Torrence Shipman (Kirsten Dunst) has just been elected Head Cheerleader of 
the Rancho Carne High School. Her duty is to make the best squad out there 
and win the National Finals for the sixth time in a row. She has even 
recruited a new cheerleader Missy (played greatly by Elize Dushku), who has 
the moves, looks and attitude all in one. While watching practice Missy 
notices something with the routine they do, and takes Torrence on a ride to 
an inner-city school: East Compton High, where Torrence witnesses that the 
Clovers have the same moves they do, except way better. Torrence learns that 
Big Red, their first head cheerleader had been videotaping these routines and 
copying them and winning the finals. Outraged, Torrence must take her squad 
to new lengths to win this competition, she has to get new moves, new music 
and a new routine. Of course along the way, they have the misadventures any 
cheerleader would have if in this situaton. Totally.</P>
<P>One thing I noticed about "Bring It On" is that it doesn't take itself 
seriously. It's a bright, lightweight, funny teen comedy that any person, 
regardless of age, sex or race can enjoy. It doesn't overly expose young teen 
girls (note that locker room scene) and contains some surprisingly realistic 
moments. The acting especially by Eliza Dushku and Kirsten Dunst is first 
rate for a teen comedy. They bring out their characters with style and seem 
to be having a great time making this movie. The direction by Peyton Reed 
really shows in the cheering scenes, these are some greatly choregraphed and 
directed scenes. </P>
<P>The cleverly written script was done by Jessica Bendinger is written with 
humor and even heart. At times I found myself almost dancing (almost) in my 
chair due to the fact that this movie is so fun, its almost crazy. However 
aside from the mostly good facts of the film, there is also the bad things. 
#1. Is the predictability, we pretty much know who is gonna win, but if you 
don't know I will not spoil it for you. #2. Is that some of the cheerleaders 
are highly cliched and shown as brainless bimbos (no offense to cheerleaders 
reading out there) and #3. Is the love story that goes on between two of the 
main characters, it was extremely under plotted and would have added a much 
more expansive atmosphere to the movie.</P>
<P>Aside from these flaws, "Bring It On" has more plusses than it does minuses. 
You can't find a teen movie these days that stays close to teen lives, 
especially PG-13 teen movies. The acting, directing and writing is all 
satisfactory and the group 'Blaque' appears on the Clovers squad and they do 
a great job supporting the cast. If your heading out on a movie right now and 
don't know which one to see, if your in the mood for fun see "Bring It On". 
You might be disappointed, but I know I sure enjoyed myself.</P>
