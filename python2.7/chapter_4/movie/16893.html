<PRE>Happiness</PRE>
<PRE>[3.5/4.0]</PRE>
<P>The title of this film might be initially misleading. It is not a happy
story, but rather, happiness is missing from the lives of most of the
characters. The story is based around three sisters, Trish, Helen, and Joy.
Also involved are their parents, Mona and Lenny, plus Helen's neighbor
Allen.</P>
<P>Trish, the eldest, is married to a successful therapist, Bill. While Bill is
a good husband and a caring father, he is a very disturbed individual, and
has hidden his destructive problem from everyone. Helen is a successful
writer who often feels inadequate, and that perhaps she is a pretentious
fraud. Joy is the youngest, and her family always thought she might not
amount to anything. It appears they were right because Joy is approaching
30, is lonely and single, has no career, and is sweet but generally
unfocused. After many years of marriage, Lenny no longer has feelings for
Mona (or anything for that matter) and wants to live alone. Allen is a
technical professional with no self-esteem. He is neither attractive
physically nor in terms of his personality. He is socially inept, and his
only relationship with women is making obscene phone calls.</P>
<P>Director Todd Solondz brilliantly guides the many intertwined stories
through difficult material. It would have been very easy to let all the
misery bloat the characters into cartoonish caricatures, but this never
happens. Instead, each character is carefully crafted and developed with the
exception of Helen, who is not well realized. Although it is not really a
thriller, an amazing amount of tension is produced by slowly unravelling the
layers of each character. The film runs a long 134 minutes because of the
amount of screen time given all the characters. However, the length is not
tedious because although the characters are often extreme in their
depravity, the progression of the story is never predictable. For example,
when Joy begins a relationship with a refugee student, it is not clear if he
will turn out to be genuine, or a scoundrel as some of the other characters
are presented.</P>
<P>Highly Recommended. This is an engaging character drama with frequent
episodes of black comedy. However, this is a very difficult film to watch.
Many disturbing issues are dealt with in a frank manner, and people who
would not be comfortable with the strong (perverse) sexual content should
avoid this film.</P>
