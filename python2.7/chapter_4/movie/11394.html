GOOD WILL HUNTING
Review By David Wilcock (C)1998</PRE>
<PRE>(MIRAMAX)
RUNNING TIME: 126 MINUTES (2 hours 6 minutes)
STARRING ROBIN WILLIAMS, MATT DAMON, BEN AFFLECK, STELLAN SKARSGARD AND 
MINNIE DRIVER
DIRECTED BY GUS VAN SANT</PRE>
<P>Good Will Hunting, written by friends Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, is
an absolutely stunning debut film.  Damon plays Will Hunting, a
janitor at Harvard who also happens to be a genius. He can solve
problems mathematicians took years to solve in minutes. However,
despite is genius and huge potential, his life is mainly getting into
fights with rival gangs in the area, along with his friend Chuckie
(the superb Affleck) and other friends. One day he is caught by the
police, and sentenced to jail.  However, math's professor Lambeau
(Skarsgard) knows about his potential, and offers to free him if (a)he
goes to math lessons and (b)he has therapy. Damon agrees, his
therapist turns out to be Sean Maguire (a bearded and superb
Williams), and he also falls in love with english student Skylar,
played well by Driver.</P>
<P>Although the story is cliched, with everything being resolved
perfectly at the end (Williams get over the death of his wife, Damon
finally realizes that Driver is his 'soul mate', Affleck is the best
friend with heart) the dialogue, acting and direction is so brilliant,
the film is just really good fun.  Unlike Titanic (1997), which
suffered from a poor script, and underwritten characters, Good Will
Hunting is smart, witty, and has superbly written characters, and
never falls into extreme schmaltz, which inferior movies would
probably do. Damon and Affleck have written a superb script, with all
the characters 'just right.' The gang speak exactly how you would
expect them to speak, because this film is written by teenagers, not
by some 40 year old who are trying to be like kids.  But even Williams
speeches are superbly adult, they don't seem 'childish' at all. So,
having proved themselves as great writers, Damon and Affleck are also
superb actors as well.  Damon is excellent as the wasted genius.  He
can show unhappiness, anger, laughter and sadness with ease, it never
seems fake. Affleck, although with a smaller role, is superb as the
best friend, he really does act like how a 20 year old friend
would. Robin Williams is also fantastic. This is his best dramatic
role to date, far better than his good performances in Dead Poets
Society (1988) and Awakenings (1990) And Skarsgard, is great as the
arrogant math's professor. Driver delivers a great performance,
although her character seems to be the most underwritten. Sadly, she
hardly features in the film, her role could have been a bit more
meatier. None the less, she is still outstanding.</P>
<P>The director, Gus Van Sant (To Die For, 1995) is also very good. He
uses slow motion well, and makes sure the gets the maximum emotion out
of any scene. The audience cries and laughs with the characters on
screen.  He really lets the audience feel with the characters. The
music, by Danny Elfman (Beetlejuice, 1988) is also very good,
highlighting the emotion even more. In fact, everything about this
film is masterful. There is hardly a major flaw in the film
aswell. Even it's length doesn't seem too long.  And although there is
a lot of swearing in the film, it all seems justified, and never out
of place. Good Will Hunting is damn near perfection, and considering
this is a debut script, that is a huge achievement.</P>
<P>Overall, Good Will Hunting deserves to win every OSCAR it has been
nominated for. Far superior to Titanic in terms of script and
characters, it will hopefully beat James Cameron epic. Good Will
Hunting is a film that can be enjoyed by everyone, as it has it fair
share of laughs, sadness, and anger. The film never outstays it's
welcome, it never forces it's message onto the audience, it never toys
with the audiences emotion (e.g. forcing the audience to cry or
laugh.) It will take a very heartless person to not enjoy Good Will
Hunting. Far better than any other 'movie with a message' you'll ever
see, Good Will Hunting comes highly recommended, thanks to superb
acting, writing, directing and even music. Like Boogie Nights (1997),
do not miss out on Good Will Hunting.</P>
<PRE>OVERALL RATING: ***** OUT OF *****
