<PRE>STAR WARS SPECIAL EDITION (1997)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Copyright 1997 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>I was two years old when the original Star Wars: A New Hope was released
theatrically. So, the only exposure of Star Wars, and the subsequent
additions to the story, for me were by video. That is until the Special
Edition of Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of The Jedi was
introduced to the big screen.  And because I've been a Star Wars fan ever
since I saw the Death Star trench run on video when I was six or seven, I
was ecstatic when I heard that the Special Edition of the Star Wars Trilogy
was being re-released to the big screen.</P>
<P>To try to tell or synopsize the Star Wars story would be a waste of time.
The story of Star Wars is so ingrained into our culture that it's hard to
find someone who is not familiar with the story and the characters.
Everyone knows about the Death Star, the Millenium Falcon, X-Wings, Tie
Fighters and Star Destroyers. Everyone knows about Luke Skywalker, Han
Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, Darth Vader, C-3P0, and R2-D2. And who can
forget the familiar words, "A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away…"
right before the fanfare music by the great composer John Williams?</P>
<P>George Lucas, on the 20th anniversary of the original release of Star Wars:
A New Hope wanted to "complete" his work. He always felt that his original
release was somewhat "incomplete" because he could not achieve what he
wanted with the technology in 1977. So, now that the digital revolution has
taken Hollywood by storm, Lucas has taken advantage of this new technology
and completed his work.</P>
<P>There are far more additions into Star Wars: A New Hope Special Edition
than into either of the other two. Rightfully so because the original a
much older film than the other two following it. At the time that the
original was being made, Lucas and company had to invent most of the
special effects technology to accomplish much of what was done in the
original film. And to that effect, Lucas and company was also limited to
what they could do with this new technology. With STSE, Lucas is able to go
back and fill in what he could not have done at the time.</P>
<P>Star Wars was more than just special effects though -- unlike most modern
day special effects driven films out of Hollywood -- Star Wars was a film
that balanced the special effects with a story so well told that by itself,
the story could hold the audience's attention. Maybe it is right that STSE
is being re-released 20 years after it originally set the stage for so many
sci-fi special effects driven films. STSE shows how a good sci-fi film does
not need to rest on its special effects, rather a good sci-fi film should
rest on the story.</P>
<P>Star Wars is a classic film that will outlive its creator and the hard
working people who made it happen. And it does deserve this, for it is a
classic film that everyone should see. If you're one of those who hasn't
already seen Star Wars, don't miss this film, in its Special Edition or
original form.  Cheers to George Lucas for introducing the world to such a
wonderful set of characters and to such a great timeless tale.</P>
