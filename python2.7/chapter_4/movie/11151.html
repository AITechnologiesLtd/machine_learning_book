<PRE>THE RAIN MAKER</PRE>
<PRE>Review by Luke Buckmaster</PRE>
<P>After many exciting court thrillers, it comes as somewhat of a
surprise that The Rain Maker is a tame yet well acted drama.  John
Grisham and director Francis Ford Coppola have been careful not to
throw in more than its simplistic plot can handle, and although The
RainMaker is not as spectacular as A Time to Kill or The Pelican
Brief, its a much more complete film in many regards.</P>
<P>Rising Hollywood star Matt Damon plays Rudy Baylor, an inexperienced
young lawyer who teams up with Deck Shifflet (Danny DeVito) to bring a
shoddy insurance company to justice.  Along the way he encounters
problems with staying financially secure, protecting a troubled friend
from her violent husband and becoming recognized in a town swamped
with money hungry lawyers.</P>
<P>After being employed by known sleaze Bruiser Stone (Mickey Rourke),
Rudy and Deck quit their job and start small law firm of their own.
Rudy soon finds himself relying on a solitary court case to get them
through the threat of bankruptcy, and battles high-class lawyer Leo
F. Drummond (Jon Voight) to fight for what is morally correct.</P>
<P>With a mixed cast of young and old Hollywood players, it comes as a
disappointment that no real climax ever eventuates; and although this
well acted drama is of fine tune and taste this alone is not enough to
make it a great film.  A worth while watch, yes, and although nothing
here is ground making material, The RainMaker has enough substance and
interest to make it a successful court drama.</P>
<PRE>3 stars out of 5
Finely crafted and well acted court drama</PRE>
