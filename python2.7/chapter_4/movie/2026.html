<P>     One night in the late 1970s (as near as I can figure--time scales
in this film are difficult to follow), a spaceship on the way from
Remulak to Earth crashes in New York's East River.  On board are Beldar
(Dan Aykroyd) and Prymaat (Jane Curtin).  Because of the state of their
ship, they are forced to seek refuge on this planet rather than conquer
it.  Unfortunately, Beldar lacks a green card, so it doesn't take long
before the INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service) finds out about
him.  With a baby on the way, Beldar gets a job first as an appliance
repair person, then as a cab driver, to make enough money to buy a
house in New Jersey.  However, even as the Conehead family goes in
search of the American Dream, Gorman Seedling (Michael McKean) of the
INS goes in search of them.</P>
<P>     It's amazing that there's such a merchandising push surrounding
this film.  Not only are there Conehead dolls, figurines, and other
assorted paraphernalia, but Subway restaurants have a deal with
Paramount to market a "Mass Quantities" meal (Subway also has a
prominent product placement in the film).  All of this may turn out to
be a huge miscalculation on someone's part.  Based on the audience I
saw this picture with, CONEHEADS may be headed down the same road as
LAST ACTION HERO (which was a much better film).</P>
<P>     Occasionally, the ten-minute sketch on SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE was
good for a chuckle or two, but given an extra eighty-minutes, CONEHEADS
turns into a tedious bore.  It's hard to believe how anything utilizing
the services of the normally-engaging Dan Aykroyd could be so
completely unfunny (then again, he was in DOCTOR DETROIT, but even that
had a couple of amusing moments).  I didn't laugh out loud once during
this entire motion picture, which is a bad sign.</P>
<P>     I expected stupid humor, silly humor, or bizarre humor, but not no
humor.  The scenes in the previews are unfortunately representative of
the entire movie, with the quirky speech patterns of Beldar and Prymaat
being the big selling point.  Oddly enough, one of the snippets I saw
the most frequently--that of Aykroyd opening a six-pack and guzzling
down the beer--is playing somewhere on the cutting room floor.  It
didn't make the final print.</P>
<P>     CONEHEADS boasts some nice special effects when the setting shifts
from Earth to Remulak.  While there's nothing groundbreaking here,
there's a nasty monster (which looks like something out of RETURN OF
THE JEDI) that's done well enough to be believable, and the Remulakian
space fleet looks imposing.</P>
<P>     The movie starts out okay, but it's hard to keep a story this thin
going for long, and by the half-hour point (around the time that Connie
Conehead is born), it becomes painfully obvious that the decision to
create a full-length feature out of this subject material was a
colossal mistake.  Even the presence of numerous past and present SNL
cast members (including Chris Farley, Jon Lovitz, Jan Hooks, and Phil
Hartman) can't save this overbloated, poorly-conceived tripe.</P>
<P>     Lovers of the Coneheads sketches will probably find this film
entertaining--and perhaps even enjoyable.  They're about the only ones
that will be true of, though.  For everyone else, CONEHEADS will be
much like an endurance contest--and the one who sticks it out to the
end may not be the winner.</P>
