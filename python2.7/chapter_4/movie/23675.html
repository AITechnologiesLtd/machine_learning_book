<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>Is there a historical era with which the movie screen seems more in love 
than the Victorian? I tend to doubt it; no other time in history is 
portrayed with more style, more panache than the late nineteenth century, 
and "Topsy-Turvy" is no exception. Indeed, with its concentration on the 
colorful world of theatre, writer/director Mike Leigh's latest movie is 
even more visually sumptuous than many other Victorian-era films. 
Combined with the wit and music of Gilbert and Sullivan, "Topsy-Turvy" is 
a real treat for the eyes and ears.</P>
<P>As the movie opens, William Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) and Arthur Sullivan 
(Allan Corduner) have enjoyed a successful and profitable partnership for 
more than two decades. Gilbert writes the stories, Sullivan composes the 
music, and to this point they have enjoyed nothing but popular acclaim. 
However, their latest opera, "Princess Ida", has been received lukewarmly 
at best by critics and audience alike. To make matters worse, Sullivan 
has grown weary of what he calls Gilbert's "world of Topsy-Turvy-dom": he 
wants to write a grand opera with a more human, more emotional scope than 
the likes of "The Pirates of Penzance" or "HMS Pinafore". He feels 
Gilbert's ideas have grown repetitive and refuses to score his new plot, 
a blatant rip-off of a previous collaboration, "The Sorcerer".</P>
<P>With no end to the impasse in sight and the fate of the Savoy Theatre, 
run by Richard D'Oyly Carte (Ron Cook), at stake, Gilbert's wife Kitty 
(Lesley Manville) drags him to an exhibition of Japanese culture. 
Impressed by the vastly foreign culture, he purchases a samurai sword to 
hang on his wall as a souvenir. When it nearly falls on his head one night,
Gilbert is inspired to write "The Mikado". The team of Gilbert and 
Sullivan appears to have another success on its hands -- but only if the 
opera actually makes it to the stage!</P>
<P>"Topsy-Turvy" can be more or less evenly divided into two acts. The first 
deals with the imminent dissolution of Gilbert and Sullivan's partnership 
and the struggles of their confreres to persuade one or both of the 
stubborn pair to give in. It is interesting enough, but feels somewhat 
meandering. These sequences do a good job of establishing the principal 
characters and the tribulations of Victorian theatre, but are rather 
lacking in incident and the whole thing basically just goes on too long. 
"Topsy-Turvy" clocks in at more than two and a half hours, and I think it 
would have been better served by shaving some time off this first half.</P>
<P>Far better is the second act, in which "The Mikado" goes into production. 
We are privy to all the details of the theatre business -- line readings, 
costume fittings, orchestra rehearsals, and so on, but done in such an 
entertaining manner as to avoid tedium. Of particular interest, we are
witness to the clashes of ego and the hints of scandal which envelop the 
play's cast and crew. It is here that Leigh's already fine script really 
shines -- a scene where the actresses from the "Three Little Maids" 
segment practise in front of real Japanese women is a highlight. The 
dialogue and pacing in this act is excellent. Unlike the first half of 
the movie, nothing is dwelt on for too long and as a result there is a 
real energy to these latter scenes. There is also a great deal of humor in 
"Topsy-Turvy", and fortunately it arises naturally from the circumstances 
rather than being grafted onto the script. The theatre is a funny and 
bizarre enough environment without being exaggerated, and Leigh is well 
aware of this fact.</P>
<P>Performances from the cast are uniformly excellent, with Broadbent a 
standout as Gilbert. He does a particularly good job portraying the 
playwright's moody disposition, sometimes appearing both jolly and dour
at the same time. Scenes like one in which he leads a read-through of "The 
Mikado" with a bemused, shorthanded cast really show off the depth of 
Broadbent's performance. He is funny without descending into caricature. </P>
<P>Corduner is very good as Sullivan, but isn't given quite the same breadth 
of material to work with. Much is made of his desire to branch out into 
more serious opera, but his characterization doesn't extend far beyond 
that. For example, whereas Gilbert has some great scenes with his wife 
filled with both humor and emotion, Sullivan's scenes with his paramour are 
more sedate. I never felt we got to know Sullivan the way we did Gilbert. 
Ultimately, Corduner's performance is simply less passionate and more 
functional, and ends up being overshadowed by Broadbent.</P>
<P>The rest of the cast is solid in their supporting roles. While these may 
seem incidental to the movie as a whole, characters such as a leading 
lady with a sordid past and a sickly actor with a drug problem really 
make "Topsy-Turvy" feel complete. This is not just a movie about William 
Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan, but about a Gilbert and Sullivan production, 
cast and crew included. It is in presenting these details that Leigh 
really sparkles. He does not focus on them, but rather serves them up 
for the consumption of the viewer, to be digested or ignored at will. 
They are not so much subplots in of themselves, but just further 
complications along the road to opening night.</P>
<P>Of course, the real star of any movie about Gilbert and Sullivan is the 
music, and "Topsy-Turvy" does not disappoint. In addition to a number of 
pieces from "The Mikado", the movie also includes selections from "The 
Sorcerer" and "Princess Ida", all lavishly presented on a 
beautifully-designed stage setting.</P>
<P>"Topsy-Turvy" is a lot of fun, especially for those with something of an 
appreciation for the works of Gilbert and Sullivan. Even if you're not 
well-acquainted with their operas, the movie serves as an excellent 
introduction to them, and provides an enthralling glimpse into 
the hectic and complicated world of theatre. The movie's lengthy running 
time does work against it, but it is otherwise extremely well crafted. Here 
is a film that ably demonstrates that, even after a century, Gilbert and 
Sullivan's world of Topsy-Turvy-dom has never lost its appeal.</P>
