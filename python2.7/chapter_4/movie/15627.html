<PRE>_Psycho_ (R) ** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Of all the talk leading up to the release of Gus Van Sant's update of
Alfred Hitchcock's _Psycho_, none was quite so intriguing as a rumor that
began circulating a few months ago.  This bit of gossip stated that instead
of being a complete shot-by-shot "recreation" as announced, the new film
would only be a duplicate until an hour in, at which point it would veer
into a completely original direction.  At about the one-hour point, there
arose a split-second moment where it looked like the rumor could be true:
motel keeper Norman Bates (Vince Vaughn) nearly opens a folded-up
newspaper.  (Anyone who has seen the original would know the significance.)
 Alas, he only _nearly_ opens it, and this _Psycho_ is exactly what Van
Sant promised (threatened?), a virtually shot-by-shot, line-for-line copy
of the seminal 1960 chiller.  And, as everyone knows, copies never come out
nearly as sharp as the original.</P>
<P>Ironically enough, the copy-then-diverge strategy probably would have been
more in line with Hitchcock's original sensibility; after all, his film was
a big bait-and-switch (or, rather, "Bates-and-switch").  What begins as a
yarn about a larcenous lady on the lam (Marion Crane, here played by Anne
Heche) suddenly switches gears midway through, shifting its focus to the
mysterious Bates, a hermit whose entire life centers around his invalid
mother.  When Marion and the money she stole from her employer disappears
without a trace, her lover Sam Loomis (here played by Viggo Mortensen) and
sister Lila's (here played by Julianne Moore) search leads them to the
nearly-deserted Bates Motel.</P>
<P>Everything in the new film plays exactly as it did in the film from nearly
40 years ago, with a few contemporary wrinkles thrown in by Van Sant and
Joseph Stephano, scripter of the original.  The $40,000 that Janet Leigh's
Marion stole has been upped to $400,000.  Vera Miles's prissy Lila has
become Moore's Walkman-wearing, ball-busting tough chick.  John Gavin's
pompously stuffy Sam has become Mortensen's roughneck cowboy.   Norman now
masturbates while spying on Marion in the bathroom.  And in a truly bizarre
move, Van Sant delves into Oliver Stone's bag of tricks, arbitrarily
slipping in subliminal shots of storm clouds and deer (among other things)
during the murder scenes.  (Also worth mentioning is a brief shot of a bus
stop Marion drives by--featuring a poster for _Six_Days,_Seven_Nights_,
Heche's romantic comedy from this past summer.  Given Van Sant's otherwise
obsessive determination in re-creating the feel of the original, hopefully
that distracting in-joke was unintentional.)</P>
<P>With the original updated yet completely intact, from the story to the
music (Bernard Herrmann's famously chilling score has been adapted by Danny
Elfman) to the opening titles (adapted by Pablo Ferro from the legendary
Saul Bass's original design), it's easy to see how Universal and Van Sant
thought this experiment could work.  But a crucial fact about the original
film is lost on them: while rightfully regarded as a classic, when seen in
this day and age, _Psycho_ works best only when its original historical
context is in mind--that is, as a film emerging from the year 1960.  There
are more than a few things in the original that comes off as dated when
seen through contemporary eyes: the deliberate pacing, the low body count,
and, most infamously, the horrible "this is why it all happened" closing
expository speech delivered by a psychiatrist (here played by Robert
Forster).  Having all of this distinctly '60s material played out by '90s
performers in living color makes for a film that feels jarringly
anachronistic; those modern wrinkles just accentuate the time era conflicts.</P>
<P>What isn't so confused, however, is the troupe of actors--for the most
part, that is.  Heche and William H. Macy (as private investigator
Arbogast) are especially effective.  (However, it must be noted that
perhaps Heche's most memorable contribution to the role, as good as she is
actingwise, is wearing a truly hideous straight-from-the-thrift-shop
wardrobe that the original's Janet Leigh wouldn't be caught dead in.)  The
big shortcoming is the cast, though, is Vaughn.  He is a terrific actor,
and, technically speaking, he delivers a decent performance.  But there is
something inherently wrong about his casting as Norman; a lot of his appeal
and effectiveness on-screen comes from the natural, almost subconscious
self-confidence he exudes, which does not fit the awkward, socially inept
Norman at all.  Granted, this is Vaughn's most muted performance to date,
but the creepy ambiguity of Anthony Perkins is nowhere in sight;
consequently, there is no suspense leading to, nor any surprise coming
with, the climactic twist, even if one has not seen the original.</P>
<P>All comparisons to any other films aside, the measure of a thriller is its
suspense and scariness factor, and, on its own terms, Van Sant's _Psycho_
is a suspiciously average undertaking--watchable, competent on technical
terms, yet strangely safe.  _Psycho_ '98 doesn't ruin anyone's memory of
the original; in fact, it only makes one appreciate that film more--which,
ironically, appears to have been the point that Van Sant has been accused
of not having. </P>

FRIDAY</PRE>
<P>_Jack_Frost_ (PG) ** 1/2 <see above review>
Kids will enjoy this harmless effects-laden fantasy about a young boy
(Joseph Cross) whose dead father's (Michael Keaton) spirit returns to him
in the form of a snowman.  Adults, on the other hand, will get bored once
the novelty value wears off.  Kelly Preston and Mark Addy also star.</P>

Returning to theatres for a five-day Academy "reminder" engagement after a
one-week Oscar-qualifying run in July and a few airdates on Showtime (got
that?) is Adrian Lyne's well-acted but ice cold adaptation of Vladimir
Nabokov's novel about a professor (Jeremy Irons) and his underage object of
desire (Dominique Swain).</P>
<P>_Rushmore_ (R) **** <see above review>
Wes Anderson's funny, wildly original comedy about a 15-year-old (Jason
Schwartzman) who falls for a teacher (Olivia Williams) at his private
school opens in New York in Los Angeles for a one-week Oscar-qualifying
engagement.  Bill Murray and Luke Wilson also star.</P>
<P>_Shakespeare_in_Love_ (R)
Romantic comedy about the Bard (Joseph Fiennes) and the lady (Gwyneth
Paltrow) who inspired _Romeo_and_Juliet_.  Ben Affleck and Judi Dench also
star for director John Madden, a veteran of British period pieces
(_Mrs._Brown_).</P>
<P>_A_Simple_Plan_ (R) ****
Full review in MR#167, 11/20/98; and at:
<A HREF="http://www.godamongdirectors.com/mrbrown/movierpt42.html#plan">http://www.godamongdirectors.com/mrbrown/movierpt42.html#plan</A>
Excellent psychological thriller in which two brothers (Bill Paxton and
Billy Bob Thornton) and their friend (Brent Briscoe) scheme to keep $4
million they find in a downed plane.  Also starring Bridget Fonda and
expertly directed by Sam Raimi, this is one of the very best films of the
year.</P>
<P>_Star_Trek:_Insurrection_ (PG) ** <see above review>
Only the most devout Trekkers will enjoy this tepid, vapid ninth
installment of the long-running sci-fi franchise, in which Capt. Picard
(Patrick Stewart) and the rest of the Enterprise crew protect a peaceful
planet from an evil alien (F. Murray Abraham).</P>
<P>_Still_Crazy_ (R) **
Full review in MR#169, 12/3/98; and at:
<A HREF="http://www.godamongdirectors.com/mrbrown/movierpt42.html#crazy">http://www.godamongdirectors.com/mrbrown/movierpt42.html#crazy</A>
Opening for a one-week Oscar-qualifying run is this decidedly
award-unworthy British comedy about a (fictional) '70s rock band staging a
comeback.  Stephen Rea, Jimmy Nail, Bill Nighy, Timothy Spall, Juliet
Aubrey, and Hans Matheson star in the film, which is ultimately more silly
than funny.</P>
<P>_Two_Girls_and_a_Guy_ (R) **
Full review in MR#137, 4/10/98; and at:
<A HREF="http://www.godamongdirectors.com/mrbrown/movierpt31.html#2girls">http://www.godamongdirectors.com/mrbrown/movierpt31.html#2girls</A>
Also returning to the big screen for a brief (two weeks) Oscar "reminder"
run is James Toback's stagy talkfest in which two angry young women
(Heather Graham and Natasha Gregson Wagner) confront the man (Robert Downey
Jr.) who has been simultaneously romancing them.  Fox Searchlight is
gunning for a Best Actor nod for Downey; don't bet on it.</P>
