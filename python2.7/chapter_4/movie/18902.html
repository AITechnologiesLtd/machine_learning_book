**** SPOILERS ****</PRE>
<P>        "The Siege" is a hard-to-categorize film.   You can't say it's a
popcorn movie, because its special effects are actually a part of the plot: 
in other popcorn movies, the special effects IS the plot.  Doesn't quite
qualify as a detective movie either, since the detectives in the film spend
most of their time responding to incidents rather than investigating (with
the exception, of course, of the brilliant coup towards the end of the
movie); not an action movie either, because there's a lot less action going
on here than in the other action movies.  Of course Bruce Willis's
appearance and performance automatically disqualifies this film from
being Oscar-caliber drama (psychological, sociological, the whole deal). 
Rather, this film is a semi-successful melting pot of many of these
things.  There are some intense action scenes and some not-so-intense
ones; some scenes utterly devoid of meaning and some that cling to you
for a long while. </P>
<P>        The film's strongest point is its shrewd tension buildup, something
you don't get that often in your everyday Jerry Bruckheimer film (I say
that having just seen "Enemy of the State").  There are some truly
surprising twists and turns, with the last one being the best, charged with
intense emotion.  That one second when you realize who Samir really is is
pure movie-going joy.  Another surprise that made me (and everyone else)
jump was the bus explosion.  Even it's inclusion in the trailors didn't
prepare me for the sudden explosion at a time of obvious tranquility and
compromise.  Well done, folks.</P>
<P>        There are some pretty strong performances in this film, the best
coming from Denzel Washington.  He really puts his heart into the
character Anthony Hubbard, giving him the desperation and the devotion to
make film work.  Annette Benning gives a strong performance (as
Sharon/Elise) as well, but I was even more impressed by the work of
seasoned actor Tony Shalhoub (Frank) who also appears in the upcoming "A
Civil Action" and has had a notable gueststarring role on The X-Files' "Soft
Light" episode.  He deftly portrays the man of ethnic minority who finds
the country he's loyal to suddenly turning against him--a sad story heard
too many times in the history of this nation.  If one thing ruined this film,
it was Bruce Willis's character Demereaux.  Although he must exist to
represent big government, Willis's performance did not make the character
come alive at all.  It is as if Willis, with his ubiquitous smirk, was guest-
starring as the Jackal.  Nothing new here.  His smirk (and lack of any other
facial expression) worked fine in movies like "Armageddon" (Hi, Jerry.),
but not here.</P>
<P>         The film is by no means perfect (boy have we heard that line enough
times <g>).  It starts off pretty slow, trudges along the way sometimes,
and falls prey haplessly to cinematic cliches occasionally.  That's unwise,
if it was a film not MEANT to have cliches.  A shame really, for a movie
that could have been really great, an "action" film that has something to
say, for once.  Nevertheless it presents some valid points, such as where
do we draw the line between upholding the absolute law and the taking
away of personal freedom and individual rights?  When is the government
too big for its own good?  And what will happen to democracy and the
voice of the people then?  A poignant question proposed in the film by
Washington: "[What if it weren't the Arabs?]  What it if were African-
Americans, Italians, Jews?"  What if it was any one of us?  "The Siege" is
not the sudden attack of sound and movement that its title suggests it is. 
It's a gradual infiltration of our mind, the gradual realization that there
just might be a chance that something horrifying might be happening to
this country.  This is a well-timed film in an era of paranoia, when
distrust of the military continues to mount; a good history lesson when Ex
parte Milligan  and the Reconstruction period are just pages in textbooks;
a film that doesn't aim for the pleasant experience but rather hits you in
the face with brutality.  Satisfactory, despite the Clinton jokes.</P>

<P>Rating:  B- (First viewing, 11/27/98)</P>
<P>* It's Not a Joke, Damnit - I'm tired of hearing villains uttering this line
in the face of obvious doom: "Is this some kind of a joke?"</P>
