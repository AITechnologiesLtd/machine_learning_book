<P>     Nick Cassavetes, the son of acclaimed international director John 
Cassavetes, makes his directorial debut with UNHOOK THE STARS, a 
pleasantly unsentimental character study of one woman who has difficulty 
letting go.  Although Cassavetes may want independence from his father's 
name and memory, this film won't earn it, for, although the style bears 
only a passing resemblance to the late film maker's, Nick not only uses 
several members of John's crew (notably Phedon Papamichael), but has 
cast his mother, Gena Rowlands, in the lead role.  In addition, the 
script has a heavy autobiographical tinge -- Cassavetes is using cinema 
to work out his ambiguous feelings towards his famous father.</P>
<P>     For Mildred (Rowlands), a single mother (she was widowed many years 
ago), her last chick is about to fly the coup.  Her oldest, a son (David 
Sherrill), has already left home.  Now, her daughter, Annie (Moira 
Kelly), is on her way out.  Their parting is less-than-amicable.  Annie 
finds her mother to be a controlling and interfering influence, and 
wants to get away as soon as possible.  Mildred watches her go sadly, 
wondering what happened to all the aspirations she harbored for her only 
female offspring.  But Mildred isn't destined to be alone for long.  Her 
new neighbor across the street, Monica Warren (Marisa Tomei), has thrown 
her husband (David Thornton) out following a particularly nasty quarrel.  
Now, she's alone with her young son, J.J. (Jake Lloyd), and doesn't have 
the money to pay a sitter when she goes to work.  Mildred offers to 
help, gratis, and soon becomes J.J.'s surrogate mother.</P>
<P>     Looking back on UNHOOK THE STARS, the first thing that strikes me 
is the script's openness and honesty.  It doesn't try to trick and 
manipulate us with melodrama.  Every action has a natural consequence -- 
nothing ever feels forced or scripted.  When Monica's husband returns to 
town, wanting to see his son, there's no shouting match or violence.  
When Annie eventually comes home, there's no big, tearful reunion.  And, 
when Mildred begins to realize that her time with J.J. is coming to a 
close, we're spared an emotional scene.  UNHOOK THE STARS is 
consistently low-key, and, in the context of an intelligent script and 
strong acting, this represents a welcome change-of-pace from most 
American films.</P>
<P>     Gena Rowlands is excellent, but that shouldn't come as a surprise.  
She becomes Mildred, subtly and effectively bringing the woman's every 
emotion to the surface.  This is the kind of role that could easily be 
overacted, but Rowlands strikes the perfect balance between restraint 
and abandon.  From the first scene, where she's delivering newspapers, 
to the last, where she turns her back on the past and strides purposely 
towards the future, Rowlands makes us care about Mildred.  </P>
<P>     Marisa Tomei, who has always had screen presence, gives the best 
performance of a relatively short career.  Tomei makes Monica a 
swirling, contradictory font of pure emotion -- she's always nervous, 
agitated, elated, furious, or a combination of the above.  Monica may 
not be the best-developed character, but Tomei invests her with such 
passion and energy that it's impossible not to see her as a lot more 
than the person on the pages of Cassavetes' screenplay.</P>
<P>     It doesn't demand much of a stretch for Gerard Depardieu to play 
the likable French Canadian truck driver who becomes infatuated with 
Mildred.  Depardieu is a pleasant addition to the cast (and got involved 
for the chance to work with Rowlands), but isn't a revelation.  However, 
Moira Kelly is.  The young actress, the best thing about the recent 
ENTERTAINING ANGELS, gives a powerhouse performance in limited screen 
exposure.  Annie's pain and rage are palpable, going far beyond the 
norms of youthful rebellion, and Kelly realistically and effectively 
portrays them.</P>
<P>     UNHOOK THE STARS is an engaging motion picture, mixing various 
flavors of comedy and drama into a satisfying whole.  Admittedly, there 
are times when Cassavetes skims lightly over subject matter that is 
deserving of a fuller exploration, but the quality of the finished 
product allows us to overlook most of these incidents.  UNHOOK THE STARS 
is a movie of many special, small moments, that, combined together, make 
for a shining cinematic experience.</P>
