Written and Directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa
WHEN, WHERE:
Opens today at The Screen</PRE>
<P>     As I write, smoke and debris envelope lower Manhattan and the Pentagon on a
day of incomprehensible horror and unforeseeable implications.  We will know
more by the time this appears in print, but it seems to be the coordinated work
of suicide terrorists, controlled by authorities and allegiances as yet unknown.</P>
<P>     Perhaps in the grip of today's context it is difficult not to filter
everything through the trauma of this evil.  Writer/director Kiyoshi (no
relation to Akira) Kurosawa's 1997 film is about a series of grisly, ritualized
murders, connected in style but committed by different people.  The murderers
are all easily found; they know what they've done, but they don't know why.  `It
seemed like the natural thing to do at the time,' one says.  The victims are
strangers, friends, loved ones.  Detective Takabe (Koji Yakusho of `Shall We
Dance') and his psychologist colleague Sakuma (Tsuyoshi Ujiki) grope for
theories (`The devil made them do it'), and finally hit upon the answer: the
killers seem to have been operating under the hypnotic control of a shadowy
stranger, a veritable Johnny Appleseed of murder.  
     The premise is a shaky one in literal terms.  Most of what we know about
hypnosis from a layman's perspective (which is to say, from movies and TV shows)
suggests that people cannot be hypnotized to do something abhorrent to them, and
this is touched on but not pursued in `Cure'.  And the ease with which people
are brought under hypnotic trance also stretches credulity.  In the classic `The
Manchurian Candidate', Laurence Harvey's hypnotic suggestion is triggered by a
playing card, but the groundwork has been laid over months of captivity and
treatment.  Here the trigger is just a simple, but there's no preparation, and
the effects are instantaneous and devastating.
     But there are many layers of darkness at work here, and Kurosawa may be
suggesting that the most unimaginable atrocities are not abhorrent to us at some
level.  
     The story cuts away from Takabe's investigation of the murders periodically
to follow the wanderings of a rootless young man whose name, from a label in his
overcoat, seems to be Mamiya (Masato Hagiwara).  He claims to have no idea who
he is or where he is.  He suffers from amnesia of the `How long have you had
this problem?' `What problem?' variety.  The suspicion grows from time to time
that he may be dissembling, but we never know for sure.  There are many things
we never know for sure, including who he is, where he comes from, and what he
wants.  Motives are almost entirely absent from the eerie world Kurosawa creates
here; there may even be something supernatural at work.  `No one understands
what motivates a criminal,' the psychologist Sakuma repeats on several
occasions, and while one might take issue with that as blanket truth, it applies
here.   
     Complicating Detective Takabe's job and distracting his professional focus
is the fact that his wife also suffers from a degenerative amnesia.  This
personal tragedy ties him with particular force to the man he is investigating,
who seems to know more than he should about the detective's situation and even
what goes on inside his head.
     Kurosawa keeps his colors muted and his camera at a distance from the
action for the most part, telling the story with dispassionate coolness.  He
strews the field with questions, but is not generous with answers.  You'll leave
the theater baffled by things that have no apparent explanation – who is the man
in the dry cleaners, and what is his relationship with Takabe?  `Cure' is
intriguing, frustrating, and sometimes annoying.  It's also hypnotic.  Even when
the crimes are solved and the guilty brought to bay, there is none of the sense
of closure that we expect.  In a way that disconcertingly reflects the world
around us, something ominous and ungraspable still hangs in the air, refusing to
be exorcized by the closing credits.</P>
