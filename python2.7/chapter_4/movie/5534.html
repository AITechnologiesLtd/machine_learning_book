<PRE>                       MONTY PYTHON'S LIFE OF BRIAN
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks

<PRE>(1979) ** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        I've heard this movie condemned as one of the most 
blasphemous pieces of Satanic filth ever put on celluloid. I'd say it's 
just not that funny. When you're taking on the dominant religion of 
your culture, you'd better have some pretty dynamite material, but 
that can't be said when the funniest part of the movie has your 
"chosen one" singing "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life" 
while being crucified. The Monty Python troupe managed to turn 
death and the afterlife into something hilarious in THE MEANING 
OF LIFE, but when trying to satire the life of Jesus, they more or 
less strike out.</P>
<P>        Their focus isn't on Jesus Himself but on a lesser known 
contemporary, Brian, who lives a normal life until one day a bunch 
of people just start following him for no reason. He is soon hailed 
as the Messiah, even though he insists he's not. And eventually, he 
ends up on the cross singing "Always Look on the Bright Side of 
Life." A skimpy plot summary, yes, but so is the plot itself. I only 
saw this two days ago but can scarcely remember anything about 
it other than the impression that only a few of the jokes were 
funny. It would have taken a miracle from God to save this 
movie, but obviously the Pythonites aren't on His good side 
anymore.</P>
