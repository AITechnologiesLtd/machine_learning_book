<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>An accurate historic story of the 1839 revolt by Africans on the
slaveship Amistad and their capture and trial in New Haven, Connecticut.
Much of the story involves a court-room drama featuring the slave Cinque
(Djimon) who led the revolt. The relevance and devastating emotions of
the slaves were intelligently presented; even though, at times, the film
was static and seemed to have no legs to get it going in the direction
it wanted to be going. Yet it still turned out to be a potent and
forceful movie.</P>
<P>It is hard to be critical of the stand for morality and piety the film
makes; but what saved this picture from being the "holier than thou
self-righteous bomb" I thought it might have been, were the presence of
John Quincy Adams (Hopkins) and Cinque in the film. Hopkins gave life to
the story by his stunning status and ability to articulate. Cinque
represented the black man, whose viewpoint was seen through his massive
physical strength and pride. He gave authenticity to the events of the
story. Without their human emotions, one by his words, the other by his
facial expressions, the film would not have been as impactful as it was.
There could be only so much that one can take from watching the misery
of others, until it would become overbearing and defeat all its good
intentions.</P>
<P>The exploitation scenes of the slaves being captured by nets in their
homeland and then chained on ships, and some being thrown overboard to
drown, were truly malevolent acts, and thankfully kept to a minimal
portion of the film's time. Or else, the film would have been a very
difficult one to watch.</P>
<P>For the trial of the slaves, the abolitionists hire a self-promoting
real-estate lawyer, Roger Baldwin (Matthew), to take their case. He, at
first, does not realize the importance of the case he is taking on,
thinking all he has to do is treat it as an ordinary case of a property
dispute. But he soon realizes that this is a very important case. He
presents this question in court: Were they born as slaves-- on a
plantation, say, in the West Indies-- or, as free men in Africa ? If it
were the later, he would win freedom for his clients, because free men
are allowed to resist being taken by force, according to the
constitution. He eventually gets Cinque to speak through an interpreter
and tell the story of his African Mende tribal people, who were captured
by rival tribesman and sold to an illegal Portuguese slave ship, and
eventually put aboard another ship, La Amistad, in Havana, Cuba. He also
tells of the part he played in the revolt and taking over of the ship,
and then being tricked by the two surviving Portuguese seamen into
taking them to America instead of Africa.</P>
<P>Spielberg is the master of a visual story, and here he is in top
form.The carnage and cruelty aboard the slave ship are shockingly and
revealingly shot, giving one enough of an idea what the slave had to
endure. That gives the film the force and importance that is needed for
it to make its moral point. The final moral point is made in front of
the Supreme Court, with John Quincy Adams saying, if these men are not
set free, you might as well start the Civil War now. He, then, proceeds
to rip up a piece of paper to symbolize the death of the Declaration of
Independence.</P>
