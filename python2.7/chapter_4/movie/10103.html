<PRE>Addicted to love
A movie review by Monika Huebner
Copyright 1997 Monika Huebner</PRE>
<P>Director: Griffin Dunne
Cast: Meg Ryan, Matthew Broderick, Kelly Preston, Tchéky Karyo</P>
<P>Sam (Matthew Broderick) is an astronomer in a small American town and
engaged to teacher Linda (Kelly Preston). He is head over heels in
love and Lindas sudden departure to New York City to live with her new
lover Anton (Tchéky Karyo) comes as a complete surprise to him. </P>
<P>But as we all know love is blind and so Sam leaves for New York as
well to win her back. He moves into an abandoned house across the
street from Anton's apartment and installs a camera obscura to watch
them. Suddenly Anton's ex Maggie shows up, but she does not want her
former lover back. On the contrary, all she wants to do is vaporize
him. She may say that she doesn't want to kill him, but the
possibility doesn't bother her too much either. After all, people die
every day.  </P>
<P>In spite of their different motives the two team up and fall for each
other as things move on. The story sounds like something we all have
seen a million times. But we haven't. Griffin Dunne brings us the most
charming comedy since "While you where sleeping". The camera obscura
adds a "special something" to the movie and makes it an exceptional
romantic comedy. </P>
<P>Everything about the movie is perfect, from set design to casting. The
dialogues are inspired and the touches of black humor add a certain
bite. </P>
<P>Meg Ryan, known from "When Harry met Sally" or "Sleepless in Seattle",
surprises in a role that may finally help her get rid of her sweet
little girl image. She impresses the viewer as a maneating biker girl.
Even more surprising is the fact that the viewer believes her, much
more so than in last years "Courage under Fire" where she played a
Gulf war pilot. </P>
<P>Matthew Broderick is the goodnatured and somewhat naive Sam who has
trouble accepting reality. The viewer can tell that he doesn't only
watch the stars but also tries to reach out for them. He has trouble
keeping in touch with reality. After all, who would leave everything
behind to chase a lost love? His naiveté that we don't question for a
minute throughout the movie clashes with Maggies exaggerated wish for
revenge. She would do anything to harm Anton. She doesn't hesitate to
use Sam for her plan and makes him understand right from the beginning
that nothing will happen between the two of them. That makes the
scenes when they innocently share a bed, have potatoe chips and watch
the action across the street like a saturday night show on TV even
funnier. </P>
<P>Tchéky Karyo is perfect as Anton. He is, well, repulsive. That's all
there is to say about him. You can't really manage to pity him, even
after all his mishaps. He not only took Sam's bride away from him, he
is also a French chef. Worlds collide, i. e. the USA and France. This
can only go wrong. Even if Maggies revenge schemes are at times
shocking, you just can't sympathize with a man who plays "Je
t'aime...moi non plus" on his tape deck. Not everyone is captured by
the French charme that Linda and even Maggie fell for. Sam certainly
isn't. Too bad for Anton. For him things take a turn to the worse.</P>
<P>"Addicted to Love" is one of this year's most pleasant surprises. </P>
