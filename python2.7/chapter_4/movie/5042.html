<PRE>                              ERIK THE VIKING
                       A film review by Randy Parker

<PRE>RATING:  **  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1989)</PRE>
<P>        As the opening credits rolled for ERIK THE VIKING, my worst fear
was that it would be as boring and charmless as THE ADVENTURES OF BARON
MUNCHAUSEN.  My highest hope was that ERIK THE VIKING would live up to the
lunacy of a Monty Python movie, since its director is Python alum Terry
Jones.  As the closing credits rolled, I was both relieved and frustrated:
ERIK THE VIKING is far more pleasant to sit through than MUNCHAUSEN, but as
Terry Jones puts it: "Anyone expecting a wacky Python movie all the way
through is going to be disappointed." (from the press release)</P>
<P>        Orion Studios, the American distributor for ERIK THE VIKING, dumped
the movie into theaters with very little publicity, and an advertising
campaign which was next to nil.  And probably for good reason--the studio
undoubtedly knew it had a loser on its hands, one which would appeal only
to a very limited audience: people (like myself) who are desperate for any
product even remotely related to "Monty Python's Flying Circus."</P>
<P>        ERIK THE VIKING is set during the Age of Ragnarok, a notorious
period in Norse mythology in which Fenrir the Wolf-God has swallowed the
sun and brought about a Great Winter.  Tim Robbins stars as Erik, a
reluctant Viking.  His peers are violent, wine-swilling barbarians.  Erik,
by contrast, is a gentle soul: raping and pillaging just aren't his style.
A pacifist in a brutal age of swords and battle axes, he would rather see
the Vikings channel their energy into something constructive.</P>
<P>        Erik's village lives in perpetual snow flurries, and--horror of
horrors--he has never seen the sun.  Erik decides to do something about
this depressing predicament by leading his fellow Vikings on a dangerous
expedition.  Their perilous journey involves a bunch of silliness about
traveling to Hy-Brasil to blow the "Horn Resounding" three times.  The
first blow will take Erik and company to the edge of the world, the second
will awaken the Gods, and the third will take them home.  It seems like a
lot of hard work just to see the sun.</P>
<P>        Terry Jones is essentially trying to combine THE HOLY GRAIL and
RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.  The result, ERIK THE VIKING, is an awkward
hybrid.  The movie misses the boat as an adventure, but as a comedy, it
fares a bit better, at least managing to leave the harbor.</P>
<P>        The loosely-structured plot is really just a collection of
sketches.  About a third of them don't even try to be funny, a third of
them try and fail, and the remaining third are genuinely amusing.  One of
the best scenes involves Erik's futile efforts to come up with a successful
seating arrangement in the Viking rowboat.</P>
<P>        The funniest moments occur in Hy-Brasil, a peaceful kingdom
cheerfully ruled by Jones, who steals the show with his hammy performance.
It's great to see him on the screen again, acting with such relish.  These
scenes in Hy-Brasil almost fooled me into thinking I was watching a
bonafide Monty Python movie.</P>
<P>        Unfortunately, the film stumbles whenever it gets away from comedy.
Jones has more on his mind than producing laughs.  Monty Python movies
never made the mistake of taking themselves seriously--that was their
charm.  ERIK THE VIKING, on the other hand, often abandons comedy and puts
on a straight-face.  Jones actually attempts to infuse into the story line
a profound lesson about man's inhumanity.  I'm sorry, but a campy British
comedy is no place for preachy moralizing.  ERIK THE VIKING would have been
far more appealing as an irreverent, full-blown comedy--in other words, as
a Monty Python film.  This is but a pale imitation.</P>
<P>        Jones is working with a modest $15 million budget, which is one
reason the movie comes up short as an adventure.  The back drops are so
obviously painted they make you cringe.  The menacing sea dragon is one of
the worst effects I've seen this decade: you can hardly see it through all
the fog and what you can see is embarrassingly rubbery.  The poor effects
sometimes make the movie seem even more low-budget than it actually is.
Thankfully, the imagery improves as the picture progresses.  Some of the
effects towards the end are strikingly clever, like the Viking rowboat
perched on edge of a gigantic waterfall.</P>
<P>        Like the special effects, the performances in ERIK THE VIKING are
uneven.  Robbins is adequate as Eric, but the role really calls for someone
like the late Graham Chapman, who succeeded with a similar character in
LIFE OF BRIAN.  If you're interested in Robbins, you'd do well to check him
out in FIVE CORNERS or MISS FIRECRACKER.  ERIK THE VIKING is not the
actor's best work.</P>
<P>        If you're expecting John Cleese to save the day, forget it.
Cleese's role as the film's villain, Halfdan the Black, is nothing more
than a cameo appearance.  What a waste!  Mickey Rooney, on the other hand,
has a hilarious bit part as Erik's grandfather.  The shock value of seeing
Rooney decked out in Viking gear is good for a few laughs.</P>
<P>        For the most part, the supporting cast lives up to the challenge of
playing characters with names like Ivar the Boneless, Sven the Berserker,
and Ragnar the Maddeningly Calm.  Freddie Jones is delightful as the
befuddled, soft-spoken missionary who in 60 years has not converted even
one person to Christianity.  Erik's love-interest is played by Imogen
Stubbs, a blue-eyed beauty with scorching screen presence.  Fans of the
TV-series "Batman" should recognize Eartha Kitt, better known as the
Catwoman, in a small part as a wise, old sage.</P>
