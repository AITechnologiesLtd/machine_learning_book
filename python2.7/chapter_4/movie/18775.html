<P>In my first-hand experiences, a person could go through 100 
direct-to-video movies in a row, and when all is said and done, maybe 
ten of them are even remotely worthwhile (whether because they are good 
or have so much unintentional humor that they're worth a look). 
Reminiscent of both 1990's superior "Clownhouse" and 1991's "Popcorn," 
director Jean Pellerin's "The Clown at Midnight" comes very close to 
fitting in to the former group. It is a slasher flick, plain and simple, 
but what is so unanticipated is that the film is a step above many of 
the recent horror movies that have been released theatrically, and 
coming from Artisan Entertainment (the company that also released the 
horrid "Strangeland" to theaters), this film deserves more notice.</P>
<P>"The Clown at Midnight" begins with a prologue: after a late-night 
performance of "Pagliacci" at an opera theater, the lead actress is 
brutally murdered in her dressing room by a person dressed in a clown 
costume following a quick tryst with her boyfriend. Switch forward about 
fifteen years, the deceased singer's teenage daughter (Sarah Lassez), 
who has recently been having frighteningly real dreams and flashbacks to 
the night of the murder, returns to the opera house, along with several 
other students, to fix up and renovate the place. After their teacher 
(Margot Kidder) mysteriously disappears, the students are left alone in 
the deserted building and, one by one, are stalked by an inexplicable 
clown figure whom lurks in the secret passageways under the stage.</P>
<P>Does the premise sound like something right out of the '80s 
tried-and-true stalk-and-slash genre? Perhaps, but what differentiates 
"The Clown at Midnight" from the norm are some fairly nail-biting and 
stylishly executed moments. Aside from the startling opening, the murder 
set-pieces always try to suck as much suspense out of each situation as 
possible, especially one set in the basement, in which the location of 
the killer is almost impossible to predict. And although usually very 
predictable, this particular sequence genuinely surprised me.</P>
<P>Ultimately, the characters are not quite as successfully articulated. 
Aside from Lassez, James Duval (as the handsome rebel/make-up effects 
expert), and Tatyana Ali (as Lassez's best friend, Monica), all of the 
roles are strictly amateurish and one-dimensional, particularly the 
proto-typical jock and witch with a capital 'B.' Also, as is usual with 
slasher movies, the characters are all forced to do really stupid things 
during the most dire circumstances, including treading off alone in dark 
areas of the opera house, or stopping for a few moments to look back 
while in the middle of being chased. As far as the performances go, they 
are almost unanonymously above-par for the direct-to-video horror 
subgenre. Of course, Duval and Lassez have both appeared in several 
independent films (including Gregg Araki's "The Doom Generation" and 
"Nowhere"), but the standout is Ali (TV's "The Fresh Prince of Bel Air" 
and "Jawbreaker"), who is not only spunky and cute, but also truly 
likable, an amazing feat for such an underwritten part.</P>
<P>Enjoyable as the film is, "The Clown at Midnight" really is nothing 
special, and breaks no new ground. The screenplay, by Kenneth J. Hall, 
is highly problematic, as is the climax, which doesn't make a whole lot 
of sense when you stop to think about it. It's a dumb horror picture, 
nothing much more, and is the type of effort that the "Scream" movies 
make fun of (although there is a clever line of dialogue here in which 
Monica says, following a false alarm, "for a second, I felt like one of 
those bimbos in a cheesy horror flick"). There have been so many worse 
movies of its type, though, that to completely bash it would be unfair. 
Here's some last advice: if you are a horror fan, give "The Clown at 
Midnight" a chance; you may be pleasantly surprised. On the other hand, 
if you hate movies where people with low-IQs are chased around and 
killed by demented bozos, avoid it at all costs!</P>
