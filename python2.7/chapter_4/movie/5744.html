<PRE>                              COURAGE UNDER FIRE
                       A film review by Michael Redman
                        Copyright 1996 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Denzel Washington is Lt. Col. Nat Sterling, a tank commander during the
Gulf War who accidentally fires on one of his own tanks, killing a good
friend.  After the war, Sterling is driven to alcoholism and
psychological self-destruction by the guilt. He's also dealing with his
investigation into whether Karen Walden (Meg Ryan), a chopper pilot,
should be awarded the Medal Of Honor posthumously.</P>
<P>Sterling's condition isn't helped by the fact that the rescue mission
Walden lead is shrouded in mystery. Every witness that he interviews
has a different version of the story. With each interview, the war is
replayed over and over to his horror. He pours himself into the puzzle
in order to dull his own pain, but it doesn't work and his
relationships with his wife and children drift further away.</P>
<P>This is the first war movie from the conflict in the Gulf and it does a
credible job of the battle scenes: dramatic and spectacular guns and
explosions juxtaposed with frightened and panicked soldiers trying to
survive.</P>
<P>The story of the investigation is intriguing. For some reason, everyone
is lying about what happened. It's unclear as to if Walden was a hero
or a coward.  As each version of the event is played, and each somewhat
different from the one before, the truth becomes more muddied and yet
adds one more piece of the jigsaw puzzle.</P>
<P>Washington turns in his usual fine performance. Ryan is surprisingly
convincing in a dramatic role, a stretch from her usual romantic comedy
parts. Most of the rest of the cast is excellent, especially Scott
Glenn as the "Washington Post" reporter. An exception is mission member
Lou Diamond Phillips who turns in a good performance but seems like
he's in a different movie.</P>
<P>That's the problem with too much of the film. Often the characters
don't seem as connected as you would expect them to be. Sterling and
his wife were supposedly once very close but now distanced, but there's
not much evidence of that closeness ever having existed. His
interaction with his commanding officer and friend is devoid of
emotion.</P>
<P>The film has a difficult time deciding what it is about. The two main
plots--Walden's story and Sterling's story--would each have been fodder
for a film.  Both in the same is a bit too much.</P>
<P>Great acting and a good tale, but with a few too many flaws to take
this movie where it could have gone.</P>
