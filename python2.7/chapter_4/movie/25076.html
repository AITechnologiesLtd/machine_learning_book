<P>"Me, Myself and Irene" (2000) Grade: B-</P>
<PRE>Directed by Bobby and Peter Farrelly
Written by Bobby Farrelly, Peter Farrelly and Mike
Cerrone
Starring Jim Carrey, Renee Zelwegger, Chris Cooper,
and Robert Forster</PRE>
<P>Did you guffaw watching Edward Norton give his own
face a black eye in Fight Club, or better yet, Jim
Carrey "kick his own a-" in Liar, Liar? If so, Me,
Myself, And Irene may be just the cup of tea you've
been looking for. See Carrey punch himself. See Carrey
kick himself. See Carrey throw himself out of a moving
car. And that's only a small segment of the latest
Farrelly Farce. Enough gags for five movies, Irene,
like all of the Farrelly Brothers films, should be
great fun if you leave your respectability at the
front entrance. </P>
<P>Jim Carrey takes a break from Oscar quest and returns
to the roots that made him larger than life. He plays
Charlie, a kind, passive wimp that's suffered from a
lot of stress over the past couple of decades. His
beautiful wife fell in love with another man, leaving
him all alone to take care of their three African
American children (see movie for an explanation).
Instead of getting angry or taking revenge, Charlie
just lets it be. As a member of the Rhode Island
police department, Charlie is picked on and bossed
around by everyone in the community, young and old.
Once again, Charlie lets it be. Until one day, Hank
enters the scene. </P>
<P>Hank is the other half of Charlie's split personality;
he's the one trapped inside the body unable to come
out for a little payback. But when Hank finally busts
loose, revenge has never been funnier. Soon the two
personalities are fighting over the same girl, Irene
(Renee Zelwegger), an innocent golf course supervisor
all of the stereotypical baddies are after. </P>
<P>Me, Myself, and Irene starts off with some huge laughs
and doesn't let up until half way through.
Unfortunately, the second half loses so much energy
that compared to the first half it will be hard to sit
through. Sure there are some clever quips here and
there but it is nothing like the rapid fire of jokes
thrown at you during the first forty five minutes. The
film just takes a wrong turn towards conventionality,
and from the Farrelly Brothers past work, this is
unexpected.</P>
<P>Carrey gives a wonderful performance; both physically
and verbally. As Charlie, he is hysterical because he
is so pathetic; a bumbling oaf of a protagonist who
couldn't be more of antihero. As Hank, the character
is to Rhode Island what Shaft is to New York. He's got
an exaggerated "cool guy" voice, a bible full of one
liners and he takes the law into his own hands. But
poor Hank is stuck in a puny body; with a figure like
this - how is he supposed to win any bar fights?</P>
<P>The rest of the cast does a nice job settling for
second place to Carrey's dominance. Like There's
Something About Mary, Kingpin and Dumb and Dumber, odd
supporting characters are inevitable. Charlie's
triplets are very funny as geniuses who are heavily
influenced by the vocabulary of foul mouth comics such
as Richard Pryor or Chris Rock. And there are others 
(humans and animals) who should remain nameless to
heighten your enjoyment. Zelwegger is satisfying
enough as the girl Charlie/Hank go gaga over. She is
never given a chance to deliver any funny lines but
she sets up Carrey for quite a few and I suppose that
is her purpose in the film. </P>
<P>This is Carrey's show though and he knows how to
control a movie like the best of them: </P>
<P>Who's the cop that will cop out when there's danger
all about? Hank! Can you dig it?</P>
