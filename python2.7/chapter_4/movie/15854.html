<PRE>Review:        PATCH ADAMS</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:        Robin Williams as Patch Adams, Monica Potter as Carin
                Daniel London as Truman, Philip Seymour Hoffman as Mitch
                Bob Gunton as Dean Walcott, and Peter Coyote and Michael Jeter</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by:        Tom Shadyac</PRE>
<PRE>Review by:        Joy Wyse, the SILVER Screen Critic</PRE>
<P>There really is a Hunter `Patch' Adams, a doctor who has the Gesundheit
Institute in West Virginia where he treats people for free.  In order to
raise funds to continue his work, he wrote a book about his life, which
has now become a movie.   He was very insistent that he be portrayed for
what he isa loving caring and very eccentric doctor.  He couldn't have had
anyone portray him better than Robin Williams.</P>
<P>The story is delightful from beginning to end.  The first scenes, set in
a mental hospital are explosive.  What might have been a deep brooding
scene becomes hysterical as young Patch pokes fun at a catatonic patient. 
The following scenes with Michael Jeter are even funnier.</P>
<P>It is not all fun and games, however, as we follow Patch through his
years at Medical school.  Rules are not for him.  Everything seems too
slow, too impersonal.  While touring the hospital he is dismayed that
people are referred to by their bed number, or their illness rather than
by a name.  He truly cares about people and they know it.  Impossible
patients become nicer just by knowing him.  Sometimes they get better. 
Sometimes they don't.  </P>
<P>In school he is attracted to another student, Carin,  but she is not
responsive to Patch and his poor study habits.  She dreams of being a
doctor and her education is all that is important.  </P>
<P>This is definitely a MUST SEE movie.  It ‘s one of the best that I've
seen in years, and it's wholesome.  It makes you feel so good.  It
definitely should be nominated for Best Picture, and Robin Williams for
Best Actor and  I hope that they win.      I give it a strong A+.</P>
