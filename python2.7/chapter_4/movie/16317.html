Dr. Dolittle, starring Eddie Murphy
2 1/2 stars out of 4</PRE>
<P> You can't help but laugh during Dr. Dolittle.</P>
<P> And the funny thing is, it has nothing to do with Eddie Murphy.</P>
<P> The laughs are generated by the lines coming from the mouths of the
various animals who turn Dr. Dolittle's life into a zoo.</P>
<P> It's shows how the funny have fallen when a guinea pig, tiger, dog and a
couple of pigeons can upstage Eddie Murphy.</P>
<P> Not that Murphy isn't funny, but he basically is playing straight man to a
menagerie. Most of the laughs he inspires are not from his lines, but from
reacting to the lines and situations created by others.</P>
<P> It's just a little sad to see Murphy, who brought such savvy, sass,
attitude and a hint of the rebel, to such movies as 48 HRS, Trading Places
and the first Beverly Hills Cop, being in a position in which he has to be
second banana.</P>
<P> Despite these underpinnings, Dr. Dolittle is a most enjoyable romp, one
that the kids will enjoy.</P>
<P> Basically an updating of the clunky old Rex Harrison late '60s musical of
the same title, this Dr. Dolittle is set in contemporary San Francisco.
Whereas Harrison's Dr. D talked to the animals by learning their language,
Murphy's doc just hears them talking to him in English.</P>
<P> It seems he was born with this ability. But, as a child, his father,
fearing his son would be ostracized for his gift, had young John Dolittle
"exorcised." The trauma led the boy to block out his unique talent.</P>
<P> Only as an adult, after a bump on the head from a car accident in which he
swerved his vehicle to miss a dog, does the power return.</P>
<P> Of course, Dolittle thinks he's going crazy. But eventually he learns to
accept his role as friend and doctor to the animals and everything works
out all right in the end.</P>
<P> The script by Nat Mauldin and Larry Levin is a bit weak, improbable and
filled with plot holes. Yet, they are benignly overlooked because of the
animal antics.</P>
<P> They also rely on an overabundance of animal scatalogical humor.</P>
<P> And it is the vocal talents of these unseen stars that carry Dr. Dolittle.</P>
<P> The juiciest lines go to Norm MacDonald as Lucky, the stray dog adopted by
Dolittle, and Chris Rock as Rodney, the pet of Dolittle's daugther, Maya.</P>
<P> Albert Brooks brings a touch of melancholy to the part of an ill tiger,
while Garry Shandling is in fine form as a neurotic pigeon. He is
complemented by Julie Kavner as his female partner.</P>
<P> Other contributors include the annoyingly funny Gilbert Gottfried as a
compulsive dog who only likes to play fetch, and Reni Santoni and John
Leguizamo as a couple of wise-cracking rats.</P>
<P> This Dr. Dolittle, directed by Betty Thomas (who also directed The Brady
Bunch Movie), is a straight comedy.</P>
<P> It's filled with laughs and it's entertaining.</P>
<P> But, one sad aspect sticks in your subconscious. They could have made this
movie without Eddie Murphy. Basically, any other comic actor - Steve
Martin, for example, could have played the doctor.</P>
<P> Is this a portend on path of Murphy's career - remaking and updating old
movies? First, The Nutty Professor, now Dr. Dolittle. What next, Gilligan's
Island.</P>
<P> Murphy is a charismatic performer on screen. We can only hope that these
successful outings are the impetus to get him back into the style of comedy
he knows and does best.</P>
