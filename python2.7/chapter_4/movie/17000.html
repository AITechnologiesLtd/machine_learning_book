<P>Graphically intense movies can be thrillers and they can be exposés, but
8MM is neither and therein lies its problem. There's too much fiction
for 8MM to deliver any sort of social message about the underground
world of pornography; and there's no sense of intense storytelling for
8MM to be considered a successful thriller. Instead, the latest film
from BATMAN AND ROBIN director Joel Schumacher is a run-of-the-mill
detective story with darkly ambitious overtones. </P>
<P>The movie is dark to the point of repulsion, and in this respect it is
most successful. Advance word from critics and the MPAA's reasons for
certification trumpeted tales of a very raw and very edgy movie;
instead, Schumacher plays up the movie with smoke and mirrors. Given the
horrific nature of the tale, it's a testament to Schumacher's brief
moments of genius that he actually shows very little substance. Much is
assumed in 8MM. </P>
<P>What isn't assumed are the story's basic facts, which never really
change throughout the course of the movie -- destroying any hope for
suspenseful thrillerism. Nicolas Cage stars as private investigator Tom
Welles, who is called upon the recently widowed Mrs. Christian (Myra
Carter) to investigate the contents of her dead husband's private safe.
Of particular concern is an ominous reel of eight millimeter film which
contains a pornographic movie that ends with a brutal murder. Mrs.
Christian asks Tom to find out if the film is real, and more
importantly, if the girl is still alive. </P>
<P>All of this is laid out in the film's opening scenes, and so the
audience is not left to ask any questions. Within moments, Tom has
several solid leads, one of which takes him to Los Angeles where he
meets up with streetwise porn dealer Max California (Joaquin Phoenix).
Max provides the movie's dark comedy, and to great effect. The Andrew
Kevin Walker script handles supporting characters like Max awkwardly,
thus resulting in the movie's muddled nature. It does not do well to
reject the character of Max, one of the audience's only sympathetic ties
to the plot, and it makes much ado about the identity of the masked man,
which has no bearing on the plot's outcome. </P>
<P>The rest of the movie is standard fare. Nicolas Cage sleepwalks through
his role and provides little entertainment benefit other than the
guaranteed box office minimum for Columbia Pictures. And, despite
seventeen films and twenty-five years in the film industry, it's still
hard to call Joel Schumacher's work anything but goofy. For most, this
will not be an essential film to see. </P>
