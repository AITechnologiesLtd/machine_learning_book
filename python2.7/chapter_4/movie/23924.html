THUNDERBALL
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P> "Which Bond film is the best?" is a question commonly asked
among filmophiles. There are different answers, but most of
the Bond fans usually name one of the first five films of
the franchise - Bond classics that made character of James
Bond inseparable from the image of Sean Connery. Among those
five films the most popular choice is GOLDFINGER, but
judging by strictly commercial standards, the best Bond film
was made a year later. THUNDERBALL, directed by Terence
Young in 1965, was most profitable film in the history of
the franchise. Eighteen years later, the same film was
subjected to remake in the form of NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN,
but the reason had less to do with the general quality of
the script and more with unsettled copyright issues. The
original novel was co-authored by series' creator Ian
Fleming and Kevin McClory, who later claimed copyright on
the character. In 1965 producers and McClory were trying to
co-operate, and McClory took part in the screenplay.</P>
<P>The plot begins with British secret agent James Bond (played
by Sean Connery) recuperating in English health spa after
another dangerous but successful mission. By accident, the
spa is located near RAF base that hosts pilots from
different NATO nations. One of them, Lieutenant Derval
(played by Paul Stasino) gets involved in a hijack of Vulcan
bomber that carries two nuclear bombs. This is the work of
SPECTRE, global criminal organisation that blackmails
British and US government, demanding huge amounts of money
in exchange for safe return of the bombs; if SPECTRE doesn't
get paid, the bombs would be detonated on UK and US
mainland. Faced with unprecedented case of nuclear terrorism
British secret service gathers all their top agents,
including Bond, in order to locate the missing plane and
possibly thwart SPECTRE plans. The only clue leads Bond to
Bahamas where he meets pilot's young and beautiful sister
Dominique (played by Claudine Auger), who is currently
cruising Bahamas on the yacht owned by her "uncle" Emilio
Largo (played by Adolfo Celi). Largo doesn't like this,
because he happens to be top SPECTRE operative who had
executed the operation. When Bond and his CIA colleague
Felix Leiter (played by Rik Van Nutter) begin investigating,
they would be faced with many of Largo's henchmen, including
seductive but deadly female assassin Fiona Volpe (played by
Gabriella Paluzzi).</P>
<P>THUNDERBALL was supposed to be the first Bond film, but
aforementioned copyright problems caused producers to choose
DR. NO instead. It turned out to be a good thing for
THUNDERBALL - in 1965 success of previous three films
guaranteed both the huge budgets and huge hype which led to
record performance at the box- office. This success was
justified, because THUNDERBALL fits all the high standards
we might expect from a Bond classic - intelligent script,
realistic characters, breath- taking stunts, spectacular
action, exotic locations and even more exotic women - all
that under superb direction and highest production values of
its time. What was unfortunate for this film is the fact
that it was made a year after GOLDFINGER. In most cases the
unavoidable comparisons between the two usually favour
former over latter. THUNDERBALL is already showing some
weaknesses that would plague Bond series in decades to come.</P>
<P>The script by Richard Maibaum and John Hopkins is not one of
those weaknesses. The motive of nuclear blackmail still
retains down-to-earth realism of the first Bond movies and
it is even more realistic in today's world, when more
nations possess such weapons. The plot, despite a minor hole
or two, works well. Characters, on the other hand,
don't.Character of Bond was, naturally, unchanged; evolution
of the role ceased and that meant that Connery can play him
without contributing anything original. This was supposed to
be compensated with other intriguing characters, but
THUNDERBALL, at least partially, disappoints. Chief villain
Emilio Largo is portrayed as intelligent, efficient yet
menacing, which makes him superior to the laughable villains
of later Bond films. Unfortunately, his character remains
one- dimensional and talents of great Italian actor Adolfo
Celi seem wasted (for the author of this review additional
problem is in the fact that he remembers Celi as much
superior villain in SANDOKAN and mini-series BORGIAS).</P>
<P>Bond girls, another important element of the formula, are
here represented with three ladies that would satisfy all
the different tastes, at least when the hair colour is an
issue. Bond's partner Domino, which represents brunettes, is
played by former Miss France Claudine Auger. Although
stunningly beautiful, Domino lack depth in character and
Auger's romantic scenes with Connery lack the right amount
of chemistry. Molly Peters, girl representing blondes, has
smaller but more effective role of Bond's nurse. Both of
them fall in the shadow of Luciana Paluzzi, Italian actress
that represents redheads. Physically attractive, yet
immoral, ready to use her body for nefarious purposes as
well as kill in cold blood, Fiona Volpe could be viewed not
just like femme fatale but also as some kind of Bond's
opposite. To make her character even more rounded, Fiona
Volpe is given some lines that could be interpreted as
screenwriters' answer to feminist accusations over sexist
stereotypes used while creating character of Pussy Galore in
GOLDFINGER.</P>
<P>The lack of dimension within film's character is hard to
notice, because the main attraction of the film lies in
action. Terence Young, who had directed first two Bond
films, does his job more than capably and we hardly notice
that the film lasts more than two hours. The action scenes
are perfect, especially the Vulcan hijacking - one of the
best moments in the history of Bond series. Another
interesting thing about THUNDERBALL is extensive use of
underwater photography; this film is the first to feature
underwater battle scene that would later become one of
trademarks of Bond franchise. The same scene is often
criticised for being too long, but it also provided
something quite new and spectacular for 1960s audiences.
Today's viewers are perhaps less patient, and less able to
overlook obvious gratituitousness of certain scenes (like
Bond using jetpack and thus ruining quite effective opening
scene), but they remain attractive and they don't hinder the
plot (which is not going to be the case in future
instalments). THUNDERBALL is also helped with the creative
talents of composer John Barry who provides new, original
material. The film also feature very goo title song by Tom
Jones, combined with first true Bond-style opening titles.</P>
<P>THUNDERBALL is not the perfect Bond film, but it still
represents the series in its zenith and provides excellent
entertainment even after more than three decades. There is
one flaw, though. True fan of classic Bond could hardly
watch this film without some sadness, knowing that the each
consecutive instalment is going to be worse than before.</P>
