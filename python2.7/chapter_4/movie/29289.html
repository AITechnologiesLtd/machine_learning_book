<P>   Torn from today's headlines about corporate downsizing and
the rupture of trust between management and labor; pulled from
the sociological debates of the seventies about the gap between
the generations; "Diamond Men" is a clever, humorous, sardonic
and exquisitely acted indie about contemporary life in America. 
Written and directed by Daniel M. Cohen, the picture starring
Robert Forster as the thoroughly professional fifty-ish diamond
salesman and Donnie Wahlberg as his brash 28-year-old trainee
treats its two principal themes with the kind of skill seen in no
other film this year. Delightfully underplayed and carefully
developed, "Diamond Men" is a rejoinder to the groaners who
complain that there's just nothing out there in the movie theaters
any more: it's the first four-star picture of the year, a just-in-time,
life-saving antidote to the barrel of swill called "Bubble Boy"
which I swallowed just twenty-four hours previous to this
screening.</P>
<P>   Dan Cohen opens his movie on Robert Forster, who performs
in the role of diamond salesman Eddie Miller, looking dazzling in
a thousand-dollar suit as he confidently heads to his capacious
car only to suffer a heart attack, after which he is Willie-Lomaned
by his much younger boss presumably because he is no longer
insurable.  Asked to mentor Bobby Walker (Donnie Wahlberg),
the arrogant young man who is to take his place, who has
personality to burn but no special aptitude for the job, Eddie is
put off by Bobby's youth culture (rock music, egotistical attitude,
undiplomatic statements) while for his part Bobby has little use
for the older man's inflexibility.  During their long drives to clients
in the Harrisburg, PA area, they get to know each other, become
buddies, and while exchanging information about women and
sharing real experience with them in bars, restaurants and other
places, each casts a marked change on the other's life.</P>
<P>   Dan Cohen's writing goes far toward making "Diamond Men"
the gem that it is.  Cohen would no more force a gag or a
humorous situation on his audience than would Eddie high-
pressure a customer to buy.  At no point does the story skirt the
borders of sit-com territory.  The audience is made aware from
the start of the flaws in each person's character.  We root for
Eddie to loosen up and for Bobby to become a mensch and we
enjoy watching the clever way that the script brings the turnabout
to fruition.  The concluding scene is a twist that will knock your
socks off.   Robert Forster, almost needless to say, never
disappoints.  The stellar sixty-year-old performer first got the
attention of the film industry through his performance as Stanley
Kowalski in a 1967 production of "A Streetcar Named Desire"
and gained wide recognition for his supporting role as Max
Cherry in Quentin Tarantino's "Jackie Brown." This time it is he
who is afforded the firm support of a troupe of performers,
particularly Donnie Wahlberg as a true-to-life (if somewhat
exaggerated) replica of modern youth; and Bess Armstrong, as
Katie, a woman who is not what she seems to be but proves, like
Bobby, to be adept at turning Eddie's life around.  In one amusing
scene a bunch of old fogies, jewelers all, are playing cards with
Eddie, joking about how one of them is enjoying a sexual
relationship with his clerk, who is forty years his junior.  "First
you'll change her diapers, and then she'll be changing yours,"
jibes one of the players," but here again we see that things are
not what they seem on the surface.  The twists, the
performances, the themes, the sincerity, the  respect for the
audience. They're all here. What more can you ask for?</P>
