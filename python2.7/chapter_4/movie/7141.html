<PRE>                              THE GODFATHER
                       A film review by Walter Frith
                        Copyright 1997 Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>Celebrating its twenty fifth anniversary in 1997 is one of the most important
movies in the history of film.  Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola's 'The
Godfather' is actually one of those very rare occasions when the movie is
actually an improvement over the book by Puzo.  Spanning approximately ten
years (1945 to 1955), the film tells many different stories.  To simply say
that this motion picture is about organized crime would be shallow and inept
to say the least.  To properly list everything 'The Godfather' is about would
constitute writing a book in the single context of this review so to make
things easy, see the film if you haven't already done so.  Those of you who
share the belief that it is one of the greatest films ever also must believe
that it's greatness is not only derived from what appears on the screen but
the events that transpired to make it happen.</P>
<P>Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is arguably the film's protagonist but that
view is not shared by everyone as we will discover later in this text.  Some
other contenders for the leading role as the head of the fictional Corleone
crime family (portrayed as the most powerful in America at that time)
included Danny Thomas, Ernest Borgnine and Laurence Olivier.  All of them
admirable choices but Brando brought a dapper quality of refined essence and
a sharply perceptive amount of dignity and wisdom to this role.  His three
sons by blood, Michael (Al Pacino), Santino or Sonny (James Caan), and Fredo
(John Cazale all display the highest amount of family love and loyalty
although Michael prefers to take a back seat to the "family business" and
decides to live a life separate from that of his brothers.  Also included as
one of the Corleone brothers is Robert Duvall as the adopted German-Irish son
whom Don Corleone relies on as his attorney.</P>
<P>Director Coppola is the real genius of this production which was originally
intended as a trashy, low budget money maker for the studio but Coppola
crafted it into a masterpiece of sublime and clandestine story telling with
character development of the highest order.  It's hard to believe that at one
point the executive, non-creative branch of the film's development actually
wanted either Jack Nicholson, Ryan O'Neal or Robert Redford in the part of
Michael and Coppola stood alone in his decision to cast Pacino and James Caan
also auditioned for the role of Michael and Coppola is rumoured to have asked
Diane Keaton who she wanted as Michael because her role as Kay Adams, the
woman who would eventually fall victim as Michael's wife, would prove to be a
pivotal one and the chemistry would have to be right.  Keaton reportedly
chose Pacino as her preference and most of the film's casting was set.</P>
<P>'The Godfather' opens with what we would eventually see is a family wedding
but before that we hear 'I believe in America...' before the film's first
visual frame opens and an undertaker is telling Vito Corleone that he needs
him to set up a hit on two men responsible for permanently injuring his
daughter in an attempted rape.  Corleone refuses and explains his philosophy
for the refusal and the film immediately displays a quality of intelligence
and depth.  As 'The Godfather' progresses the audience is drawn into the
family wedding scene which lasts approximately half an hour so the audience
would be fully introduced to the film's colourful cast of major characters.
 It's a repetitive trademark Coppola would use in all three 'Godfather' films
as a way to breed familiarity into linking all three films together although
they are all vastly different.</P>
<P>The real attraction in 'The Godfather' aside from Brando is Pacino.  His
characterization of Michael is impressive difference from the time the film
opens until it concludes.  Some would argue that Pacino and not Brando is the
film's true protagonist and the debate that has raged all these years among
fans of the film only re-enforces its stature as one of the best character
studies in film history.  Michael is a man who knows right from wrong but
eventually becomes drawn (somewhat reluctantly) into a life of crime after
his father is nearly murdered by a rival crime lord.  He is the logical
choice to replace his father one day as head of the family, something his
father was always against.  Sonny, the 'hotheaded' brother wouldn't have
lasted because of his temper constantly clouding his judgement and Fredo was
always the naive and weak son bent more on reaping the rewards of crime
rather than working to achieve them.  Robert Duvall probably has the most
under rated role in 'The Godfather' as the fourth son, made to feel somewhat
like an outsider as he is not a blood relative and his loyalty to the family
is constantly tested.  A test he always passed with flying colours.  One
classic scene has Brando and Pacino on screen together (they would share
surprisingly little time on screen together which would turn out to be very
effective) in a long conversation about the future of the family and what
Brando always aspired Pacino would become.</P>
<P>Many reviewers have stated over the years that 'The Godfather Part II' (1974)
is actually a better film than the original and having been the only sequel
to win the Best Picture Academy Award in history is proof that even many in
the film community feel the same way.  In the opinion of this reviewer I
believe that the sequel 'mushroomed' the story better and offered Coppola a
chance to go to a broader horizon but overall, the original is preferred
because of its freshness in breathig new life into the gangster category of
film history.  Its controversial subject matter stirred up much debate at the
time of its release and is also certainly one of the most talked about films
of all time.  As 'The Godfather' draws to a conclusion it sets up Part II in
such a way that you feel satisfied that you've seen Part I and it doesn't
have a cliff hanger ending which is frustrating and empty.  </P>
<P>Other members of the cast include Talia Shire (whose character would be
greatly improved upon in the other two films), Sterling Hayden, John Marley,
Al Lettieri, Al Martino, Abe Vigoda, Richard Conte, Morgana King and Alex
Rocco.</P>
<P>'The Godfather' is one of the pioneering films that will carry the film
industry into the next century and its important legacy is a testament not
only to the talent of its cast, filmmakers and their crews but it's a film
that will undoubtedly stand the test of time and is one of those classics
that simply cannot be remade better than the original.       </P>
