<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Upon viewing Bernardo Bertolucci's last film, Stealing Beauty, I figured
him for a dirty old man.  The tight crotch shot on Liv Tyler as the
opening credits rolled and, later, Tyler on all fours licking a mirror
at the request of Jeremy Irons were both dead giveaways.  But it turns
out that with his latest picture, Bertolucci proves that he is a bore as
well as a pervert.</P>
<P>Beseiged (it was actually called The Siege until the Bruce Willis dud
hit theaters first) features a story simpler than can be found in any
bad American soap opera: A wealthy white guy falls for his black maid
who can't reciprocate his feelings because she's married to a political
prisoner.  That's it.</P>
<P>The white guy is Jason Kinsky (David Thewlis, Seven Years in Tibet), the
owner of the palatial Roman home cared for by Shandurai (Thandie Newton,
Beloved).  He sits at home all day and plays the piano, while she
prefers the music of the native land that she has fled.  That's it.</P>
<P>The two hardly share words, let alone anything in common.  On the plus
side, Bertolucci does effectively use the home's dumbwaiter, symbolizing
the social distance between Jason and Shandurai, who performs her duties
in order to put herself through medical school.  And there are some
great shots involving the giant spiral staircase in the massive
dwelling, warmly shot by cinematographer Fabio Cianchetti.  But that's
it.</P>
<P>Hey, at least it's not too long.  (1:30 – R for nudity, mild violence,
adult situations and language)</P>
