<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>A story about people should have sympathetic characters.  Bryan
Singer's Apt Pupil, which is based on a novella by Stephen King, is a
story that centers around a strikingly unpleasant teenager and a Nazi
general in hiding.  These characters are well-drawn and created with
charisma by the actors, but they're not nice people.  In fact, they're
both monsters in their own ways, and I think that this is the point of
the film.  But, by the end of the picture, I was left with a bad taste
in my mouth:   here is a story about a smart kid who acquires first-hand
information about the Holocaust, and becomes a beast of a human being as
a result.  </P>
<P>What happened to the old-fashioned lessons, like "learn from your
mistakes?"   Or, perhaps, "learn from the mistakes of others?"  Apt
Pupil, though a riveting cinematic experience, is a deeply cynical look
at human nature.  I really can't say why without giving away the end,
but I can say this:  the only thing the characters learn from their
mistakes are ways to escape consequences in the future.   I wonder if
this was Singer's purpose; his last film, The Usual Suspects, was also
about bad people, but most of them had likable traits.  The only people
who win our sympathy in Apt Pupil end up emotionally scorned or brutally
murdered.   </P>
<P>The teenager's name is Todd Boden, and is played by Brad Renfro.  Todd
is a straight-A student; the film opens just as he becomes obsessed with
Nazi Germany after his history class covers the subject for a week.  One
day, while riding the bus, he notices an old man get on and sit behind
him; Todd recognizes him as a Nazi general that he had seen in text
books.  One month passes, and Todd finally knocks on the old man's
door.  His name, apparently, is Kurt Dussander (Ian McKellen), and Todd
has a proposal for him.</P>
<P>He wants to know all about the Holocaust, about "the things they won't
tell us in school."  Why should Dussander tell him anything?  Well, Todd
has assembled pictures and fingerprints, and is giving him no choice: 
if he doesn't tell his stories, Todd will go to the police with his
evidence.  So Dussander agrees, and he tells Todd his stories.  Every
day, after school, Todd goes to Dussander's house, absorbing more and
more of the truly awful stories that Dussander has to offer.  Todd
begins to falter in school, and soon the tides turn -- Dussander takes
control of the situation.</P>
<P>It's an original premise, and a gripping film.  Singer is a sharp
director; his techniques are subtle -- scenes build tension without the
use of intrusive music or intricate camerawork.  But holocaust material
isn't exactly audience-friendly; there are scenes here that seem to lack
taste and judgement.  There's a scene in which Todd is showering and
imagining himself among Jews in a concentration camp; the men around him
are sickly and thin, and while it's an effective image, it seems present
more to manipulate than to inform.  Singer doesn't approach the subject
with care; in fact, the Holocaust really isn't under examination here. 
What's interesting is the dynamic between Todd and Dussander.</P>
<P>It's just too bad that both characters are so hateful.  Dussander is
supposed to an enigma, and, for a while, he is:  at first, it seems that
he believed that the experiments he was "forced" to perform were simply
things that "needed to be done."  Later, though, it's clear that he's
lying:  he enjoyed torturing the Jews.  This is never spoken outright,
but McKellen's performance -- which is one of the best this year -- is
so darkly clever that it's impossible to miss Dussander's true feelings
in the matter.  He is a Jew hater, and he always will be.</P>
<P>But Todd, played ambitiously by Renfro, is not a hero.  He forces
Dussander to tell his stories, blackmailing him with incriminating
information.  It's too soon to feel hatred for Dussander at this point,
so Todd seems more malicious than founded in his demands.  Later, Todd
comes across as downright sadistic -- one of the film's most perplexing
and most disturbing scenes has Todd forcing Dussander to put on a Nazi
costume and march by his command.  Singer films this segment with
perfect harshness, but, by the end of it, Todd seems more psychotic than
Dussander.</P>
<P>That's a crucial flaw when you're dealing with a story as intense as
this.  Only two characters win our affections by the end:  the school
guidance counselor (effectively portrayed by David Schwimmer), and a
homeless man (Elias Koteas) willing to sell his body for a shower and a
place to sleep.  Without a place to send our emotions, Apt Pupil strikes
as deeply unpleasant experience:  a disturbing, completely engrossing
film that makes you feel bad and doesn't manage to convey any solid
message.   It's a disappointment, really, given the talent involved.  I
don't recommend that you avoid the film -- no, it's too powerful to
dismiss.  Just be warned that Apt Pupil is meticulously unpleasant in
almost every way, and I'm not sure why it needed to be.  </P>
