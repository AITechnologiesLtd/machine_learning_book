<P>     What happens when a bored wife thinks her kindly old neighbor
commits a murder?  Woody Allen attempts to answer the question in his
latest cinematic endeavor, MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY.</P>
<P>     Carol Lipton (Diane Keaton) and her husband Larry (Woody Allen)
are caught in a routine, commonplace marriage - until Carol turns into
Nancy Drew following the death of a neighbor.  It all seems like a
open-and- shut case of a heart attack, and the police aren't thinking
foul play, but Carol becomes suspicious when the widower of the dead
woman (Jerry Adler) doesn't mourn "enough" ("What should he do", asks
Larry, "walk down the street sobbing?").  With the help of Ted (Alan
Alda), a close friend who encourages her sleuthing, she begins to
assemble "clues" to fit her pet theory of a murder.  But the evidence
is weak, and Larry becomes concerned that his wife is obsessed with a
macabre fantasy.  He tries to be the voice of reason, but when no one
listens to him, he ends up playing along.</P>
<P>     Part of the fun of MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY is guessing whether or
not Lillian House was murdered, as Carol believes, or simply died of a
heart attack.  In a sense, that's the mystery of the film, and Woody
Allen brings across the solution with his characteristic mix of madcap
comedy and on-target realism.</P>
<P>     In 1979, director Allen made MANHATTAN, a movie that many critics
and fans consider to be his greatest effort.  Between then and now,
Diane Keaton has been absent from Allen's films, and her return in
MURDER MYSTERY is a welcome change from helium-voiced Mia Farrow.  Ms.
Keaton is a breezy, energetic personality, and it's hard to imagine
anyone else doing nearly as much with the character of Carol (even
though this part was originally conceived with Farrow in mind, and
wasn't re-written following the cast change).  One need only look at
the Allen/Keaton and Allen/Farrow collaborations to determine which
pairing worked better, and MURDER MYSTERY merely reinforces this
conclusion.</P>
<P>     Some claim that to have seen one Woody Allen picture is to have
seen them all.  To say that not only vastly oversimplifies things, but
does a great injustice to the individuality of each of Allen's
projects.  Sure, there are a number of themes that he returns to like a
comfortable chair, and the character he plays rarely varies from a
basic neurotic type (no one would accuse Allen of having great range as
an actor), but each of his films - even those that fail (take SHADOWS
AND FOG, for instance) - offers something fresh and unique.</P>
<P>     HUSBANDS AND WIVES, Allen's previous picture, is a drama with
humorous elements.  MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY is closer to a
straightforward comedy, providing more laughs than anything Allen has
done in a long while (he claims to have "indulged" himself with this
movie).  Combined with numerous one-liners, almost all of which work,
are several instances of well-timed and well-executed physical humor.
Allen pushes all the buttons from wit to slapstick, and rarely comes up
empty.</P>
<P>     If there's a serious side to MURDER MYSTERY, it's only to be
expected.  After all, the director has a reputation to maintain, and
the movie's principal subject - death - isn't usually a laugh-a-minute
riot.  Allen also takes a look at love, as the twenty-year marriage of
Carol and Larry is put under the microscope.</P>
<P>     Film buffs will find the usual number of references to look for,
although these are perhaps more explicit than in many Allen movies, and
include DOUBLE INDEMNITY, REAR WINDOW, and THE LADY FROM SHANGHI.
There certainly may be others, as Allen has a habit of putting more
into his films than anyone can hope to get in one sitting.</P>
<P>     A word has to be said about the annoying cinematography of Carlo
Di Palma, who returns after causing audiences motion-sickness with his
wobbly, hand-held camerawork in HUSBANDS AND WIVES.  While the
intention is obviously to draw the viewer into the film, it actually
has the opposite effect; the camera cannot compensate the way the human
eye can.  Admittedly, this method seems less distracting here than in
the previous film, although this could be a case of greater exposure
breeding immunity.</P>
<P>     Woody Allen is rarely a big commercial draw, and whether his
off-screen antics will boost his box-office take remains to be seen,
but MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY may be his most accessible film since
HANNAH AND HER SISTERS.  This movie is still pure Allen, but the humor
is broad-based, and the "quirkiness" often associated with the director
is kept to a minimum.  Frankly, it's been years since I've enjoyed
Woody Allen this much.</P>
