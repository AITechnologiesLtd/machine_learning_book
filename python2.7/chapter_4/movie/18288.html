<P>"Hamlet," "Othello," "Romeo & Juliet," "Much Ado About Nothing." In the 
past several years a big screen adaptation of one of William 
Shakespeare's plays has been released at least every couple months, and 
with the huge success of Oscar-winner "Shakespeare in Love," many more 
adaptations are in the works, and the first out the gate is one of his 
lighter, fluffier comedies, the self-proclaimed "William Shakespeare's A 
Midsummer Night's Dream," which, unfortunately, is not nearly as magical 
as the lovely title implies.</P>
<P>The setting of this latest adaptation, directed by Michael Hoffman, has 
been transported from 17th-century England to 19th-century Tuscany, but 
strangely enough, the Elizabethan dialogue remains (although, in 
hindsight, this isn't as ridiculous a thought as 1996's "Romeo & 
Juliet," with Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes reciting Shakespeare 
amidst an urban 1990s setting). The fantastical story goes like this: 
Helena (Calista Flockhart), a disspirited young woman who is 
head-over-heels in love with Demetrius (Christian Bales), the planned 
suitor of the beautiful Hermia (Anna Friel), who herself is in love with 
Lysander (Dominic West), follows each of them into the forest one 
midsummer's night on her bicycle (a new invention), determined to steal 
Demetrius' heart. Things don't go quite as planned, however, when they 
unwittingly step into the forest of the fairies, headed by Queen Titania 
(Michelle Pfeiffer) and King Oberon (Rupert Everett). Oberon seeks the 
aid of his horned assistant, Puck (Stanley Tucci), to collect a few red 
flowers whose juices have the power to turn each person who comes 
physically into contact with it to fall in love with the first person 
they see upon waking. So as both Demetrius and Lysander are put under 
the spell, both of which set their sights on Helena, who simply believes 
they are playing a cruel trick on her, an overacting troupe member who 
has come into the forest to practice his latest play finds himself 
turned into a donkey when he slips on a magic hat, and lusted after by 
Titania, who has also fallen under the flower's potion.</P>
<P>"William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream" falls under one of the 
major shortcomings of all of Shakespeare's works, which is that he wrote 
tons and tons of carefully planned and intricate dialogue, but always 
failed at developing his characters, who remained at a distance from the 
material and were written in a general and vague manner. Aside from 
perhaps his 'Romeo & Juliet," none of his many plays I have read have 
gotten me to care even remotely about any of the characters, or even the 
story. To me, the Elizabethan dialogue always felt like a mere gimmick 
to be flashy, and this film version of "Midsummer" is no different. Not 
at any time during the film did I ever really feel willing to get 
involved in what was happening on-screen, and the romantic plights of 
the characters are so thinly written that it is impossible to care about 
them. </P>
<P>If anything, "A Midsummer Night's Dream" is a lighthearted fantasy, and 
with such a bewitching title, those exact sequences set in the forest 
were the most dull and lifeless, without even a hint of enchantment. 
Much of the problem goes to the major technical problems, including 
surprisingly atrocious cinematography by Oliver Stapleton, who 
overlights ever night scene to such an extent that it often was 
confusing to whether it had changed to the daytime or not. The last time 
I was out in the woods during the middle of the night, I couldn't see a 
thing, but in this movie, there seems to be a constant bright sun 
shining down on everyone, despite the dark skies. The qualms don't stop 
there, as the production design by Luciana Arrighi is thoroughly 
artificial and distracting, never once looking like anything but an 
extravagant movie set in the confines of a large studio. In one scene, 
Puck rides into view on a giant turtle that is so fake-looking and 
obviously mechanical that I felt as if I was watching a movie from the 
'60s or '70s. All of these problems within the main section of the film, 
mixed in with the overall amateurish performances, had me actually 
longing, instead, for the infinitely superior 1982 Woody Allen farce, "A 
Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy," which was funny, whimsical, and 
involving, three things this current film is sorely lacking.</P>
<P>Acting-wise, the performances are all over the map. Faring best is 
Calista Flockhart (vanquishing her "Ally McBeal" character), who seems 
to understand the difficult dialogue so well that each word that comes 
out of her mouth is instantly accessible to understand. Flockhart's 
Helena is also the only character I gave one iota about, as she is a 
frustrated and unhappy woman who feels like she belongs to Demetrius, 
even though he doesn't care about her. Kevin Kline is sometimes winning, 
and at other times downright annoying, as the dim-witted Bottom. 
Finally, Stanley Tucci makes somewhat of an impression and is well-cast 
as the sprightly Puck, but what is his exact purpose in the movie other 
than to narrate the conclusion? </P>
<P>On the opposite side of the spectrum is Michelle Pfeiffer's dismal 
performance as Titania. Pfeiffer is a fine actress, but Shakespearean 
she's not, as she recites her lines without any thought, energy, or 
feeling. In a recent interview, Pfeiffer mentioned how she didn't care 
for Shakespeare, and since she obviously doesn't know how to hold her 
own against her fellow thespian, it leaves you wondering just why she 
took this role in the first place. Rupert Everett, an exciting actor so 
wonderful in "My Best Friend's Wedding" is given nothing to do here but 
show off his body, and without any motivation or purpose (aside from 
setting the whole story into motion), his fairy character comes off as 
more of an afterthought. And Christian Bale has to be the most largely 
sought-after bore in the history of film. I don't know; maybe Helena was 
having a slight bout of insomnia and though that going out with him 
would cure her, er, problem.</P>
<P>The various romantic couplings during the long midsummer night leads not 
to an enjoyable conclusion (although it has a false one), but unwisely 
goes on for another twenty minutes with Bottom and company throwing a 
play of "Pyrimus and Thisby." What is supposed to be a charming, 
humorous sequence is actually a situation we've seen so many times 
before that it is not funny, only juvenile. Regardless of my many, many 
criticisms, I did not hate "William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's 
Dream." I hasten to add I didn't like hardly any of it at all, but it 
wasn't dispicable in the way that "Armageddon" or the recent "The Mummy" 
are. Director Michael Hoffman has made a respectable attempt at turning 
yet another Shakespeare play into a treasured motion picture, but 
ultimately fails to bring any sort of magic to the story or situations. 
If you hadn't already realized, "magic" was the one thing this movie 
desperately needed.</P>
