<P>     It's always the same old story:  There's a poor sap just out of the
joint, just trying to make a buck to get by.  Then along comes a dame,
getting real friendly even though she's already mixed up with a guy, only
she says the guy is bad news and she wants the poor sap to help her get
out...and there's money as part of the bargain.  Yep, it's the same old
story...except that in BOUND, the poor sap is another woman.  You might
expect BOUND to try to cruise along on little more than its gender-bending
premise, but you would be wrong.  BOUND is a wickedly entertaining
thriller with a gloriously manic performance by Joe Pantoliano, and it
doesn't need gimmicks to succeed.</P>
<P>     Our resident poor sap is Corky (Gina Gershon), a woman trying to walk
the straight-and-narrow after serving five years for "re-distribution of
wealth."  She is doing maintenance work for a Chicago apartment building
when she meets Violet (Jennifer Tilly), the beautiful, breathy lady living
in the apartment next door to the one she is working on.  Violet is the
kept woman of a low-level mobster named Caesar (Joe Pantoliano), but it
seems she also has eyes for Corky, and the feeling is mutual.  Violet
confides in Corky that she wants to leave Caesar, and hopes to take with
her the $2 million Caesar is holding for his bosses while setting him up
to take the fall.  So Corky hatches a plan to steal the money and force
Caesar to run...except that Caesar doesn't react quite according to plan.</P>
<P>     The first act of BOUND sticks quite close to the standard film noir
formula story line outlined above, complete with femme fatale Violet
seducing Corky with drinks and double-entendre, Corky engaging in
suspicious second-guessing, and a partnership in crime which seems less
than entirely trustworthy.  Gershon (SHOWGIRLS), sporting lips so full she
seems unable to close her mouth entirely, makes an acceptable stand-in for
the usual male dumb lug, with just a touch of Bogart's world-weary
cynicism.  The sex scene between Gershon and Tilly is utterly gratuitous
after the much more effective seduction scene, however, and BOUND begins
to raise red flags of turning into pure exploitation when heads begin
smashing into toilets and severed fingers begin flying.</P>
<P>     I also feared I saw danger signs of BOUND becoming a case of
lesbian-chic meets plot-twist-chic once Violet and Corky get their hands
on Caesar's money, that it would play itself out with the two women
exchanging double-crosses until poetic justice was served.  The reason
that doesn't happen is that Andy and Larry Wachowski (ASSASSINS) have no
intention of letting Caesar be little more than a plot device.  As played
by Joe Pantoliano, Caesar is a giddy display of sheer survival instinct as
he thwarts the carefully-laid plans of Corky and Violet to set him up by
taking on the people Violet expected him to run from.  Pantoliano has some
hilarious moments as he becomes ever more desperate, including a
conversation with a corpse which is as comic as it is one-sided, and BOUND
begins building merrily tense scene on top of merrily tense scene.</P>
<P>     I suppose the thing that makes BOUND particularly satisfying is that
it is simply a very good thriller -- suspenseful, unpredictable,
well-acted and stylishly directed.  On one level, I suppose you could
argue that the lesbian angle is unnecessary, and that the Wachowskis
include it simply for titillation value, but it is precisely because it is
unnecessary that I think it is so noteworthy.  BOUND would have been just
as effective if Corky had been a man, or if Caesar had been a woman, or if
all three main characters had been men.  It was not all that long ago that
film-makers began talking about "color-blind casting," choosing actors not
because their race or ethnicity was intrinsic to the roles but because
they were the best actors available for those roles.  In BOUND, Gina
Gershon makes a sharp little suspense thriller that much more intriguing
by being perhaps the first example of "sexuality-blind casting."  Here's
to the poor saps of the world, whatever their gender.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 gender benders:  8.</PRE>
