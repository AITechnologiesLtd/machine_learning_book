<PRE>Better-Than-Average Bumbling from "The Man Who Knew Too Little"
by Homer Yen
(c) 1997</PRE>
<P>Starring Bill Murray, TMWKTL is a light comedy that offers a clever
premise.  Wallace Ritchie (Bill Murray), a meek and likable doofus,
somehow manages to unwittingly immerse himself in an international
espionage plot without even being aware of what's going on around him.
This happens because when he pays an unexpected visit to his
successful brother, James (Peter Gallagher), who is hosting a very
important dinner, Wallace is asked to leave and to return later that
evening.  To keep Wallace busy for the next several hours, Ritchie
buys him a ticket to the Theatre of Life, an interactive,
participatory game for only one person.  Consider it a low-tech
version of Michael Douglas's experience in "The Game".</P>
<P>Trepidatious and oozing with humility, he waits by a phone booth where
a soon-to-come phone call from the Theatre of Life will set the game
in motion.  Ring-ring-ring!  The shadowy voice on the other side
instructs Wallace to go to an address.  Wallace thinks that the game
has begun, but that particular phone call was intended for a hit man
who would arrive minutes later.  Wallace, believing that this is all
part of the show, in all his folksy glory, begins to bumble his way
through a series of amusing episodes, never really knowing the
imminent danger that he is in the or the high stakes of the situation
that he has entered.  It's all just fun and laughs for him.  However,
he seems to enjoy his time slightly more than the audience.</P>
<P>This movie does boast several positive points.  What you'll find
entertaining is the neutral dialogue that is exchanged as Wallace
meets up with all sorts of bad guys and even the woman that he is
supposed to kill.  The conversations take on a double meaning with
Wallace meaning one thing and the bad guys assuming another.  Also,
you'll chuckle at the way he unknowingly outraces police cars,
outsmarts villains, and outmaneuvers pursuers.  Blissfully unaware of
the real danger and just plain lucky, Wallace manages to flummox the
evil-doers at every, ridiculous turn.</P>
<P>What this movie lacks is the manic energy required to fuel this kind
of screwball comedy.  There are some very funny scenes, all thanks to
Murray's comical abilities.  But all the while, it seems like an
explosion of laughter should be imminent, but it never quite elevates
itself beyond grins and giggles.  Murray is not the kind of star that
can take a film by himself to great comical heights.  The comedy
produced here is a result of his reaction to his situation, which he
views as just another impromptu scene in the Theatre of Life.
However, the lack of energy is not really his fault as the story
prevents him from 'working the audience.' </P>
<P>Still, Murray is affable, the unraveling of the story is fun to watch,
and at 94 minutes in running time, it's very tolerable.</P>
