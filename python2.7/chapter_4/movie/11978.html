<PRE>PAULIE
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>In the wake of Babe, you would expect to be doused by a flood of talking
animal movies.  Paulie is the first of three we can expect this year
(the others including Dr. Dolittle and Babe 2).  If the others are as
good as Paulie, we'll be lucky.</P>
<P>The film opens with Misha (Tony Shalhoub), janitor at an animal research
company, discovering a parrot in the basement.  But this is no ordinary
parrot...this is Paulie (voiced by Jay Mohr), and he can talk.  Not just
mimicking like most parrots, but true intelligent speech.  Misha and
Paulie become friends, and Paulie tells his tale.</P>
<P>It all started when he was a hatchling.  He was bought as a present for
a young girl, Marie Allweather (Hallie Kate Eisenberg).  She has trouble
speaking and few other friends, but Paulie soon becomes her best friend
and teacher (helping her overcome her stutter).</P>
<P>But good things never last, and after being blamed for being a bad
influence, Paulie is sold.  He makes a vow to return to Marie any way he
can.  The film follows Paulie on his journey, as he meets a wide variety
of people. There's a kind old painter, Ivy (Gena Rowlands), a shifty
con-man, Buddy (Jay Mohr), a happy-go-lucky restaurateur, Ignacio
(Cheech Marin), and a scientist, Dr. Reingold (Bruce Davison).</P>
<P>Overall, the film is cute, and a little oversentimental.  The film it
most hearkens to is Babe.  However, it doesn't have as strong a sense of
magic as the talking pig flick...but Paulie packs a heftier sense of
humor.</P>
<P>What really sells the film is the character of Paulie, himself.  Many
animal films rely completely on the animal's cuteness to sell itself.
Although there are a couple of the requisite "awwww" scenes, the film
doesn't dwell on them.  Instead, we get to know and like this parrot as
a person.  In fact he's more interesting than the majority of characters
that we get to meet in many films today.</P>
<P>Plus, Paulie has quite a cast to back him up.  Tony Shalhoub in
particular does a noteworthy job as the kindred spirit who lends a
sympathetic ear to a talking bird.</P>
<P>There are a couple of cute parrot tricks in the film, particularly those
involving an ATM, but not as many as you might expect in a film of this
type.  The speech effects are convincing, but considering they involve
an immobile beak, they don't seem to have the same finesse as Babe.  A
minor complaint:  we never quite learn why Paulie is so unique.  We meet
several other animals (even other semi-talking Parrots), and none seem
quite so human as Paulie.</P>
<P>The cinematography is not quite as good as it tries to be.  For example,
there is a sunrise sequence which is supposed to be awe inspiring, but
comes off as particularly bland.</P>
<P>But that aside, Paulie is quite entertaining.  The film has a heart, and
a mind as well.</P>
