<P>THE EXORCIST  (1973) (new cut, 2000) ** 3/4 . Directed by William 
Friedkin. Written and produced by William Peter Blatty, from his 
novel. Photography, Owen Roizman. Editing, Norman Gay, Jordan 
Leondopoulos, Evan Lottman, Bud Smith. Production design, Bill
Malley. Music, Jack Nitzsche, Mike Oldfield ("Tubular Bells").  Cast: 
Ellen Burstyn (Chris McNeil), Jason Miller (Father Karras), Max Von 
Sydow (Father Merrin), Linda Blair (Regan McNeil),  Lee J. Cobb (Lt. 
Kinderman), Kitty Winn (Sharon), Jack MacGowran (Burke), Vasiliki 
Maliaros (Karras's mother), Mercedes McCambridge (Regan's satanic 
voice), et al.  A Warners release. 132 minutes. R (obscenities, 
upsetting images.)</P>
<P>The film was a mega-hit in 1973, and is no doubt the best of the 
Exorcist films that followed. Now it is reissued with some extra 
11-12 minutes taken from footage that was not included in the 1973 
release. (The never-shown preliminary version ran about 139 minutes.) 
Primarily, restores some extremely coarse language by Regan (Blair) 
who was already plenty foulmouthed in the 1973 release. It also 
contains a gratuitous, wrong, mood-killing, "humorous" scene at the 
very end.</P>
<P>The mono soundtrack of this 27-year old work has been skillfully 
turned into stereo --which adds something to the movie. But the 
sounds of at least one scene (Burstyn and Miller talk while unseen 
kids make noises) come out of the side speakers artificially.</P>
<P>The film's admirers were and still are legion. I was not a big fan 
then, I am not now. Yet, though I realize that this "enhanced" 
reissue is caused by filthy lucre, I am glad to see revivals on the 
big screen finding a new public. There's another bonus too. Alongside 
awful movies for cable TV, the proliferation of multiplexes also 
encourages much junk to be shown in theaters. So, we may assume that 
whenever an oldie significant for any reasons  is resuscitated on the 
big screen, it takes the place of some lamentable new item.</P>
<P>Except for older persons, too many vintage picturesare "terra 
incognita." For those titles, videos, laser disks or DVDs do fill a 
gap, but this is not as important as having  "true" projection.</P>
<P>Most film-viewers know that "The Exorcist" is about 12-year old 
Regan, the daughter of divorced movie actress Chris.  The girl 
becomes possessed by the (or a) devil, does horrible things and looks 
horrible too. Tentative medical diagnoses settle on a lesion of the 
temporal lobe. Surgeries (most graphic!) do not help. Matters go from 
bad to worse. Exorcism is suggested. It is performed by youngish 
Catholic priest Father Karras (Jason Miller in his film debut) and 
the experienced, older Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow).</P>
<P>The opening, set in Northern Iraq, is splendid.  From a minaret, a 
muezzin calls the faithful to their hourly prayers. In a large 
archaeological dig, discoveries are made. Father Merrin ( in 
civvies), frail of health and serious of mien, is involved. Iraqi 
places and people are shown  creatively, not as touristic sights but 
as atmospheric sites. This footage,   shot on location in Iraq, sets 
a very special mood.</P>
<P>The story shifts to the USA where it becomes a novel type of horror 
movie. To this day, a great many spectators claim that it is the 
scariest film ever made. That's where I part ways with them --no 
doubt because I do not scare easily in most movies of that genre.</P>
<P>I am affected by well-made "horror" films that suggest rather than 
depict, where the horror is more implicit than explicit. Of course, 
sometimes a literal kind of horror does work but it leaves no residue 
as a general rule. Let me me put it this way, with some examples off 
the top of my head.</P>
<P>"The Cat People," "The Invasion of the Body-Snatchers" (both 
versions,),"The Night of the Hunter," "Rosemary's Baby," and such, 
are much more chilling than any "Alien" or "Aliens" or most special 
effects movies. "Psycho" and "Blade Runner, so different from each 
other, in spite of some explicitnessfactual get their main impact 
from powerful atmospheres. And so on.</P>
<P>Even more frightening are movies in other categories that are not 
specifically labeled as horror. These range from  sociological works 
to political fictions, semi-fictions or documentaries. And they can 
show super-horror, as in the factual "Night and Fog" which deals with 
WWII deportations and extermination (genocide) camps. There are so 
many true horror works that fiction pales before reality. Man's 
inhumanity to man, the abomination of wars, terrorism, neglected or 
forgotten humans, injustices, inequities, and much else grip you in 
(at random) "The Grapes of Wrath," " I Am a Fugitive From a Chain 
Gang," and many more.</P>
<P>Two recent examples I caught on TV. A new German documentary on how 
the Nazis brainwashed Hitler Youths, then turned them into 
kid-soldiers (as young as 12) whom they sacrificed in vain. That's 
true horror. I also saw for the fifth time "Memphis Belle," that 
heart-rending documentary about true heroes, young airmen of the 8th 
US Army Air Force who, in WWII, bombed Germany over and over, and had 
a horrendous rate of attrition.</P>
<P>Of course, there are exceptions to the exceptions, meaning literal 
scenes that horrify. In my own case, this goes back to the the very 
first feature I ever saw.  It was a scene in a reissue of the old 
"Trader Horn," one of the first movies ever shot mostly in Darkest 
Africa. A native porter falls off a liana bridge to the river below 
and is killed by a crocodile. I had nightmares for months.</P>
<P>Back to "The Exorcist."  I am tepid about it not only because every 
horror is spelled out but because the story is unconvincing, 
arbitrary and has weak connections between its component parts. I 
don't believe in devils either--other than human -- or in 
telekinesis, levitation, etc. But I do confess that after its 1973 
screening I avoide green pea soup for weeks. And, to be fair, the 
special effects, while seeking sensationalism and cheap thrills, 
remain impressive.</P>
<P>In 1973, Pauline Kael, the then monarch of reviewers,  wrote: "The 
demonic possession of a child is treated with shallow seriousness. 
The picture is designed to scare people and does so by mechanical 
means." I add to this that there seems to be no real pity for Regan's 
giga-predicament, while there was for King Kong, for the victims of 
Dr. Moreau or Count Dracula.</P>
<P>Lastly, there are too many unexplained matters and loose ends. A 
minor case occurs when Chris, hearing weird noises, explores her 
attic by the light of a candle. (This goes against my belief that 
everyone involved incertain situations should carry a lighter, a 
flashlight and a Swiss Army knife.) Or else the peculiar fact that 
movie actress Chris seems to be living permanently in Georgetown 
rather than in Los Angeles or New York. I may have missed something.</P>
<P>A major puzzle concerns Father Karras, this "sacerdote de la triste 
figura." He is very clearly of Greek descent. His mother speaks 
perfect Greek, with a genuine accent.  She is played by Vasiliki 
Maliaros, a totally Greek name. (I have found no other credit for 
her). But then, how and why did Karras get into Roman Catholicism, 
since  practically all Greeks are hard-core Orthodox Christians?</P>
<P>All things and flaws considered however, the film is worth seeing, 
but more for its sensationalism rather than its logic or feelings.</P>
