<PRE>                                   HEAT
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     I hate to condone the making of 3-hour long movies, but HEAT is one
in which you're not going to fall asleep.  Comparisons to CASINO are going
to be inevitable, with both hitting the 180-minute mark and starring
Robert DeNiro as a crook, but unlike that film, HEAT manages to keep the
interest level high throughout the whole picture.</P>
<P>     HEAT is the instantly gripping tale of a large-scale heist leader and
die-hard loner named Neil McCauley (DeNiro).  As the film opens, he and
his team of brutal, precision thieves (including Val Kilmer and Tom
Sizemore) knock over (literally) an armored car for a stash of bearer
bonds.  On the case is Detective Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino), a troubled,
angst-ridden veteran of the LAPD.  Over the course of the film, McCauley
and Hanna develop a strange sort of kinship, even as McCauley's crimes
increasingly raise the stakes and Hanna's efforts to stop him become more
and more desperate.</P>
<P>     The action builds up for a solid two hours until a nearly
catastrophic "final" bank robbery results in one of the most vivid
shoot-outs ever filmed.  Writer/director Michael Mann (best known for his
work on "Miami Vice") paces the movie well, and he really puts the
audience through the ringer by getting the adrenaline pumping like an oil
well.</P>
<P>     But why is this film 3 hours long, you ask?  The answer lies in
Mann's multidimensional examinations of all the major characters, their
wives, their children, and any other love interests who happen along. 
Thus over the course of the picture, we discover Hanna is in his third
marriage and his wife's ex-husband is a deadbeat.  We learn at length
about McCauley's personal code:  to have nothing in his life he can't walk
away from in 30 seconds flat if "the heat" is coming.  And when the heat
does come, we see how it affects everyone...in depth.  While these
relationship subplots are mildly interesting, they seem completely out of
place in the movie and, in the end, weigh the film down.</P>
<P>     This aside, strong performances by the principals and some excellent
bit parts by players like Hank Azaria, Tom Noonan, Natalie Portman, and
Jon Voight make HEAT a truly memorable film.  Somewhat more difficult to
figure out is Pacino, who takes his over-the-top, in-your-face screen
presence to new heights, becoming almost cartoonish in his archetypal
portrayal of the insanely driven cop.  Altogether, the cast lends a lot of
credibility to what would otherwise be another run-of-the-mill crime
movie.  And while the sometimes hard-to-follow script often demands too
much of the viewer, this film is one that's truly worth seeing.</P>
