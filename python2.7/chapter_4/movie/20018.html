<PRE>RUN LOLA RUN (1998)
A Film Review by Ivana Redwine
Copyright 1999 Ivana Redwine</PRE>
<P>I went into "Run Lola Run" expecting to be dazzled, yet I thought
I would probably hate it anyway since my taste leans toward
films with strong stories and fully developed characters. But I
was pleasantly surprised to find this little German movie to be
emotionally engaging as well as highly entertaining. Although
"Run Lola Run" hasn't redefined my taste, I learned something
about movies and myself after seeing it. There are ways to
create an unforgettable character and a film that sparks with
emotion, even if the story is paper-thin.</P>
<P>"Run Lola Run" is visually stunning and has an energy seemingly
fueled by pure adrenaline. The film is basically a breathlessly
paced thriller with a bit of a love story thrown in. Its inventive
narrative structure also creates a frame for a meditation on the
mutable nature of destiny. Although "Run Lola Run" is stronger on
style than substance and story, it is not without some emotional
resonance and philosophical depth, and it isn't surprising that
it has attracted considerable attention at film festivals. It won
Best Film at the 1999 Seattle International Film Festival and the
Audience Award in the World Cinema category at the 1999 Sundance
Film Festival.</P>
<P>A preamble sets up the film, suggesting that in a world of
infinite possibilities there is only one certainty--the amount of
time something takes. Then Lola (Franka Potente) receives a phone
call from her boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu), and he tells
her he is in big trouble. While working for a crime boss, Manni
lost a bag containing 100,000 marks, and he must replace the money
by high noon or he will be killed. Running through the streets of
Berlin, Lola has only 20 minutes to somehow obtain the cash and
get it to her boyfriend in time to save his life.</P>
<P>The film's innovative structure is tiered into three parts, all
starting at the point when Lola gets the call. From there, each
segment branches off, suggesting dramatically different destinies
for Lola, Manni, and others. Even the lives of some of the
passersby are changed forever, and this provides much of the
movie's humor.</P>
<P>Writer/director/co-composer Tom Tykwer's film has an audacious
style. I thought the film's visual aspects and its edgy score
were perfectly matched to the emotional high stakes of the
action. Energetic camera work and the pulse-like beat of techno
music intensify the frantic mood of the film. The editing is
impressive, too, as the movie switches back and forth between
film and videotape, in addition to mixing still photography and
animation with live action.</P>
<P>Even though the story in "Run Lola Run" is a little flimsy, its
characters managed to eventually pull me in, making me care
about their plight, and much of the credit for this must surely
belong to the actors. This is especially true of Franka Potente
as Lola. She has an intense, charismatic screen presence, and
some of the tight shots of her expressive face are particularly
dramatic. I was also impressed by the film's way of showing
different possible fates, as if drawn at random from a multi-
layered time/space continuum of infinite possibilities. "Run
Lola Run" not only entertained me, it made me think and
feel. Not bad for an afternoon at the movies.</P>
