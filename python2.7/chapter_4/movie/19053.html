<PRE>The Three Faces of Eve (1957)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 65</PRE>
<P>Hollywood had a fascination with psychiatry during
the 1950s.  Perhaps the hope was strong that a
person's emotional problems were simply based upon
a single traumatic incident, which, once revealed,
would 'cure' that person.  These naive, wishful
expectations of psychiatry form the background of
"The Three Faces of Eve".</P>
<P>Joanne Woodward plays a woman who suffers from
multiple personalities.  Based (undoubtedly loosely)
upon a true story, 'Eve' is a drab housewife
married to a clueless hick (David Wayne).  When
a second personality emerges, a vivacious,
irresponsible flirt, Eve is somehow sent to a
psychiatrist (Lee J. Cobb, whose ability to keep
a straight face provides the major use of his
acting skills here).  Eventually, a third personality
appears, a perfect, mature woman who apparently
has combined the best aspects of the other two
personalities.</P>
<P>There is much humor in this film, intentional
or otherwise.  This is provided by Cobb's deadpan
delivery, Woodward's flirtatious personality,
and Wayne's dense character.  The worship of
doctors as superior beings is apparent, especially
when Cobb states that he has no sexual interest
in Woodward because he is a doctor.  The silliest
part of the film has Cobb able to resurrect
the desired Woodward personality simply by calling
for it by name.  (Eve's personality changes are
signalled by musical score changes and by her
freezing in an awkward position.)</P>
<P>Joanne Woodward won a Best Actress Oscar for her
wide-ranging performance.  She would turn the
tables in 1976, playing a psychiatrist treating
a woman with multiple personalities in the
made-for-TV "Sybil".</P>
