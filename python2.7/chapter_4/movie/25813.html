<P>Initially, my expectations for "The Cell" were low, primarily because of
its mid-August release date. August is the month studios traditionally
use to burn off those movies they consider too anemic to compete against
the big summer flicks and too insubstantial to face off against headier
autumn fare.</P>
<P>Then Roger Ebert got me all stirred up. On his weekly TV show (which the
local affiliate thoughtfully airs on Saturday nights at 3:30 a.m.),
Ebert and his new partner raved about the production, calling it one of
the best movies of the year. After gushing over the eye-popping visuals,
they went on to praise the story, claiming that it worked on multiple
levels.</P>
<P>I'm glad Roger and his comrade in arms had such a fine time. As for me,
"The Cell" turned out to be just another late summer disappointment,
filled with flashy images and little substance.</P>
<P>Created by award-winning commercial and music video maker Tarsem Singh
(he now bills himself simply as Tarsem, you know, like Charo), the film
comes off like a grisly, feature-length perfume commercial with
delusions of grandeur. What a drag.</P>
<P>Jennifer Lopez plays Catherine Deane, a psychologist involved in an
ultra high tech form of therapy. Using a whiz bang machine, she can
enter the subconscious of her patients. Decked out in a body suit that
appears to be made of red Twizzlers, Catherine closes her eyes and
awakens in the dreamscapes of her clients, where she wanders through
trippy MTV style video sets, dispensing psychological bromides while
wearing the kind of outfits that Cher and Madonna trot out for award
shows.</P>
<P>The story begins within the mind of Edward Baines (Colton James), a
comatose little boy. Set against blue skies and majestic desert sand
dunes, we watch as Catherine tries to win the trust of the child, hoping
to eventually draw him back to the real world. The segment is
impressively shot and, unfortunately, the high point of the film.</P>
<P>While Catherine strolls through the psychic Sahara, whacked out serial
killer Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) wages a terror campaign outside
the lab, torturing women to death and then turning their corpses into
animated dolls.</P>
<P>After the lunatic is captured and falls into a coma (how convenient),
straight arrow FBI agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) turns to Catherine
and her comrades for help. Somewhere, Carl's latest victim, Julia
Hickson (Tara Subkoff) is trapped in a huge torture tank that fills with
water every few hours. The young woman is destined for a horrible death,
unless Catherine can enter his mind and discover the location of the
lethal aquarium. The bulk of the movie hops between Catherine's forays
into the killer's cranium and disturbing shots of a frantic Julia trying
not to drown.</P>
<P>The makings of a solid film are present, but Tarsem is so fixated on
creating groovy tripscapes that he neglects everything else. While
Julia's situation remains dire, there is no sense of danger with any of
the principal players. Character development is virtually nonexistent,
leaving Lopez and Vaughn stuck in one-dimensional roles.</P>
<P>Despite setting much of the film in Carl's deranged brain, the story
stays at a Psych 101 level. Catherine attempts to build a rapport with
Carl's inner child, learning that the killer was abused as a boy.
Meanwhile, the adult Carl skulks about, sporting a series of
over-the-top costumes that Elton John would surely die to own.</P>
<P>When Spike Jonze ventured into the mind of another person in the
wonderful "Being John Malkovich," he was smart enough to realize that
outrageous ideas are best presented in a low key, matter-of-fact
fashion. Tarsem seems incapable of turning off the flash. Even in the
real world scenes, he uses swooping camera shots, jump cuts to extreme
close-ups and other visual stunts. As a result, nothing in the film
feels genuine.</P>
<P>To make matters worse, the subconscious segments suffer from overkill.
Too often, Carl's costumes, created by April Napier and Japanese
designer Eiko Ishioka, appear more silly than imposing. As for the
general look, imagine REM's "Losing My Religion" video (also directed by
Tarsem), magnify the excesses by 10, toss in some gross out footage and
you'll know what to expect.</P>
<P>Ultimately, "The Cell" is little more than creepy, vapid eye candy, with
a story barely grafted on. Ads for the movie use a quote describing the
production as "'The Matrix' meets 'Silence of the Lambs.'" What a load
of crap. "The Cell" lacks the imagination, excitement and thrust of the
former film, and the character development and storytelling expertise of
the latter, leaving viewers staring at an overlong, inert music video
peopled with lavishly costumed characters all dressed up with nowhere to
go.</P>
