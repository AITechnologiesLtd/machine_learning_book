<P>PATHER PANCHALI (SONG OF THE LITTLE ROAD) (director: Satyajit Ray; cast:
Kanu Bannerjee (Hari), Karuna Bannerjee (Sarbajaya), Uma Das Gupta
(Durga), Subir Bannerjee (Apu), Chunibala Devi (grandmother),
1955-India)</P>
<P>An understated masterpiece in simplicity and poetical mood, the first
part of Ray's trilogy, THE WORLD OF APU, based on the popular 1934
two-volume novel by Bibhuti Bannerji, as Ray studies the life of a very
poor family, trying to survive on an income of next-to-nothing in a
rural village in Bengal. PATHER PANCHALI covers the early childhood of
the hero of the story, Apu. We, as observers, seem to become a part of
the family and share in their dreams and hopes, wondering what can be
done to make life better, as we ask ourselves, is it best to leave
everything in the hands of God, believing that God knows best.</P>
<P>We first become acquainted with the utterly adorable Durga (Uma), as she
steals fruit from the local orchard and is detected by the spiteful
neighbors, who blame her mother Sarbajaya (Karuna) for not teaching her
the difference between right and wrong. The mother hears this being said
while she is doing her laundry by the communal well, and confronts her
daughter with this information, realizing that she is taking the mangoes
and guava to her very old, hunchbacked, toothless and unwanted
grandmother (Devi), who is devilishly charming. She has gotten under
Sarbajaya's skin, making her unhappy that the playful Durga loves to
help her out. Mother accuses grandmother of being a bad influence for
the child; and, the reason she is being thought of as a bad mother by
the neighbors; so she asks granny to leave, claiming she can't stay here
any longer, that she is spoiling the child.</P>
<P>Apu (Subir) is born, and grandmother returns to live with the family.
Durga is childishly playful with her wide-eyed younger brother (who
represents all the hopes of knowledge and success for this family). She
is constantly teasing him; but, also, she shows great affection for him.
They seem to have a natural bond.They are both trapped in their
environment and have only their childhood dreams to help them escape
their poverty.The father, Hari (Kanu), is a failure as a provider for
the family. He is a dreamer. He thinks of himself as a scholar, who will
one day become famous for writing plays. He also conducts religious
services to try and meet expenses. But this is not going well, the house
is badly in need of repairs, and his wife constantly nags him to get
some money. He is of such a good nature, that he can't stand to argue
with anyone or ask for something, even if it is rightfully his, putting
all his fate in God. He can't even ask his boss the reason why he isn't
being paid; or, as his wife reminds him, he didn't even fight for his
rights to the fertile orchard, which would have softened life for the
family to a considerable degree, when his inheritance of it was
challenged because his brother had huge debts.</P>
<P>Tragedy comes to the family when the father has to leave the local area
to seek work and fails to return for months, leaving the family in an
impoverished state. During a monsoon rainstorm, Durga develops a chill
and because the family lacks the proper medicine, she dies. This takes
the heart out of the family, as the father returns too late to be of any
help. Death has already come to their grandmother, after feeling
rejected by her family, she goes out to the hidden fields and is found
starved to death by the children who went there to look at the trains
passing by.</P>
<P>The final scene shows the family moving away from the isolated village
their family has lived in for generations, opting for the bigger city of
Benares, where it might be possible for them to better their lives.</P>
<P>Satyajit Ray's old-fashioned and slow developing film, graced with the
sublime sitar ragas of Ravi Shankar, is unpretentious and starkly
beautiful in its depiction of the human condition just as it is, giving
relevance to the lives of these ordinary people, without the need to be
arty about it, as the characters find in their hearts how best to
transcend the situation they are in. This film should be a magical
lesson in film-making for those modern filmmakers who think they must
inject heavy doses of symbolism to get their point across.</P>
