<PRE>                                 LONE STAR
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: The evidence of a decades-old murder
          of a legendary town sheriff is discovered in a
          Texas border town and the current sheriff suspects
          his own father, another legendary sheriff of the
          crime.  This is a film about strained ethnic
          relations, strained father-son relations and a lot
          more packed into one solid and intelligently
          written script.  This one will probably be on my
          top ten of the year.  Rating: low +3 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     It is not easy to pigeon-hole what John Sayles's new film LONE
STAR is about.  At least superficially it is a murder mystery, but
there is a lot more to this film.  Sayles has written a complex and
textured look at life in a border town wracked with ethnic tension from
the volatile combination of Whites, Blacks, Mexican immigrants (both
legal and illegal), and even some Indians.  This is a story of
corruption and of strained parent/offspring relationships.  There are
three father/son pairs and one mother/daughter pair and in each case
the parent has caused his offspring to resent him by some behavior or
action.</P>
<P>     The story takes place in the generally peaceful border town of
Frontera, Texas.  The plot is set in motion when the remains of a man
killed in the early 1970s are found.  A sheriff's badge is found among
the bones, and so current sheriff Sam Deeds (played by Chris Cooper)
assumes that the dead body belongs to a former sheriff of Frontera,
Charlie Wade (played in flashbacks by Kris Kristofferson).  Murdering
Wade was almost a public service since he was a corrupt sheriff and
vicious bully who had been seen murdering suspects.  Sam immediately
starts to suspect his own father Buddy (played in flashbacks by Matthew
McConaughey).  Buddy is something of a local hero for having kicked out
Charlie Wade and becoming sheriff himself.  The town remembers Buddy as
ending corruption and bringing integrity to the office of sheriff, but
this hero-worship does not quite square with Sam's remembrances of his
father.  Sam remembers his father as being a bad sheriff, only
appearing good by contrast to his predecessor.  The young sheriff has
unfinished business with his dead father and whom he remembers with no
little hatred.  Sam has to dig into his father's reputation and the
incidents of more than two decades ago to try to understand this new
case.  At the same time he is courting Pilar Cruz (Elizabeth Pena), the
daughter of Mexican immigrants, whom he loved at the age of fourteen
but from whom he was separated by his father and Pilar's mother.  Cruz
is a local history teacher who finds herself embroiled in ethnic
tension at her school, a new romance with Sam Deeds, and a touchy
relationship with her mother (Miriam Colon).  There is also a subplot
with the Black community.</P>
<P>     Sayles wrote, directed, and even edited the film.  He does a
reasonable job of weaving together several complex threads of plot into
a single story that very much give a three-dimensional view of life in
Frontera.  One weakness of the script is that the is an almost
completely disjoint plot of an Army base in the town and a Black bar
that George Wade would shake down for protection money.  This forms a
second whole line of plot sewn to the main line in only one or two
superficial stitches.  Some of the same themes appear in each story,
but neither story really depends on the other.  Together they do give a
better view of this small Texas town.  In each story the view includes
life not just at it is now, but also how it was when it was controlled
by sadistic Charlie Wade.  In the main story Sam needs to reconstruct
this past to find the facts behind the old killing.  In the other the
basis for the current trouble is also in the past of about the same
time.</P>
<P>     Chris Cooper is probably best remembered for his film debut as the
young union organizer from MATEWAN.  While the script calls for him to
make some of the hardest decisions of his life, he does not convey very
deep emotion beyond a sort of sad wisdom.  It is much more interesting
to watch Elizabeth Pena whose eyes seem to convey more of the sorrow
and pain of her life.  The role that will get noticed, though it is
much smaller, is that of Kris Kristofferson as the malignant corrupt
sheriff.  Kristofferson is not known for tough-guy roles, but here he
can be easily believed as the evil that hangs over the whole town, even
after his removal from the scene.  Good character performances come
from Joe Morton, Ron Canada, and Miriam Colon.</P>
<P>     Sayles has managed to turn a not-too-promising ethnic-tension plot
into a film that may well rank with MATEWAN as the best enjoyed of his
films.  The film is intelligent and at the same time clever.  I rate it
a low +3 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
