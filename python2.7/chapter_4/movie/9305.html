<PRE>U-Turn (R) *** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>The words "An Oliver Stone Film" have come to signify a big, bombastic
political statement by the controversial director, so at the opening of
U-Turn, his moderately-budgeted, statement-free thriller, in place of those
words are "An Oliver Stone Movie."  The altered credit is clearly intended
to label the film as an unpretentious, conventional genre piece, but after
seeing the film, I see it as more of a warning.  U-Turn is not a
conventional genre piece, but rather Stone's perception of a genre
piece--which is bizarre, somewhat baffling, but nonetheless intriguing and
warped entertainment for anyone brave enough to tackle it.</P>
<P>This adaptation of John Ridley's Stray Dogs does boil down to a thriller
premise: Bobby Cooper (Sean Penn) on the way to Vegas to settle a debt with
some stolen money, has his radiator hose blow up on him in the
backwater--make that back_desert_--town of Superior, Arizona, where he
becomes part of a murderous triangle with sultry, bored housewife Grace
McKenna (Jennifer Lopez) and her wealthy husband Jake (Nick Nolte).  The
seeds of this conflict are planted early on, but for the space of an hour,
nothing really happens with it; instead, that time is spent with Bobby as
he encounters the various eccentrics about town: flirty hick Jenny (Claire
Danes); her tough guy suitor Toby N. Tucker, a.k.a. TNT (Joaquin Phoenix);
a nameless blind man (Jon Voight) with a dead pet dog; and mechanic Darrell
(Billy Bob Thornton), a grease monkey in the truest sense of the term.  For
this time, Stone appears more interested in the oddball characters than he
is the normal thriller aspects, which would be a problem if the characters
and the situations were not as funny as they are.  Not everything works (a
running gag where Bobby's beverage bottles keep on breaking before he can
drink is especially lame), but for the most part this section of the film
is a demented hoot, galvanized by some great character work by the
supporting players.</P>
<P>With that sideshow going on, the thriller side of U-Turn seems more of an
afterthought, both figuratively and literally; the Bobby-Grace-Jake
triangle and its intertwining murder schemes takes finally centerstage with
about 40 minutes to go.  But Stone gives it his all, using his Natural Born
Killers intercutting visual style to good use here to underscore points in
Ridley's ever-twisting screenplay, and going full-throttle with the sex
and, this being Stone, violence.  Keeping things running smoothly are the
actors, especially Lopez, who shows more depth and versatility with every
film.  In a way, U-Turn feels like two different films--the small-town
satire and the thriller--but what unites them is Ridley and Stone's
pitch-black sense of humor.  The blood-drenched finale may be too gruesome
for most audiences to get the joke, but if you do, it is quite funny in the
most twisted sense.</P>
<P>Many critics have panned U-Turn as a creative cul-de-sac for Stone, but I
think it signifies the opening of a new road for the director to take--the
application of his considerable filmmaking talents to films other than
personal "message" movies.  If the loopy yet fun U-Turn is any indication,
his planned Mission: Impossible sequel should be something to look forward to.</P>
