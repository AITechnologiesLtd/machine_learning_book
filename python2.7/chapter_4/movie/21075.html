John Lordan, Harry Dean Stanton</P>
<P>   The first lesson you learn in literature class is that every
story must have conflict: Man against man, man against his
fellow man, man against nature.  "The Straight Story"
challenges this assumption, unless you want to discuss a
new type of friction in literature, man against lawnmower. 
There isn't a single rotten apple in this 111- minute drama,
and aside from a brief if heavy downpour, nature is not the
enemy.  The principal character, Alvin Straight (Richard
Farnsworth), does not even have a confrontation with himself. 
He is determined to visit his ailing brother and at no point
expresses a single doubt about the journey he is to
undertake.  </P>
<P>   There are, however, a couple of unorthodox departures
aside from this paucity of strife.  One is that the majority of
people in the tale are old--over 70, or presumed to be.  The
other is that the director and co-scripter of this sweet, linear,
and orderly narrative is David Lynch, the very person who
confounded the moviegoing public two years ago with "Lost
Highway"--a story so bizarre it made "Twin Peaks" look like a
walk in the woods, and whose audacious "Blue Velvet" back
in '86 penetrated the surface of a picture-postcard town in a
more cryptic way than Sam Mendes had in mind when he
dissected suburbia with this year's "American Beauty."  Why
would a master of the surreal and the bizarre veer off into
what's just about the straightest story of the year--a G-rated
movie targeted to adults?  Never mind what Lynch might tell
the interviewers: I'd speculate that someone made a wager
that he couldn't turn out a normal, everyday piece--just as the
great contemporary composer Sergei Profkoviev was once
challenged to devise a major piece of music in the 18th
Century style (and succeeded with his "Classical Symphony").
Other than that, I'd say that since Lynch is also a serious
photographer, he may have wanted to conceive a pictorial
essay on the real America.  His camerawork (especially the
long shots) on the seemingly infinite corn fields of Iowa look
like the backdrop to Kate Smith's singing "God Bless
America."</P>
<P>   The picture belongs to the charismatic Richard Farnsworth,
who at the age of 79 plays a 73-year-old who is made up to
look like 83.  As Alvin Straight, Farnsworth performs in the
role of a widower whose wife had produced 14 kids (7 of
whom survived) and who now lives with his speech-impaired
daughter, Rose (Sissy Spacek), whose defect makes some
people believe that she is retarded.  When the codger hears
that his estranged brother Lyle (Harry Dean Stanton) has had
a serious stroke, he is determined to visit the ailing fellow, but
lacking money and a driver's license, and determined not to
hand over his sovereignty to a bus driver, he sets out by
lawnmower from his run-down abode in Laurens, Iowa for the
Wisconsin border town where his brother lives in a shanty.  A
lawnmower?  Yep.  The 1966 John Deere turns out to be a
conversation piece on the road just like Charlie, John
Steinbeck's dog, who accompanied that author on a trip in
search of America.</P>
<P>   We expect the septuagenarian combat veteran of World
War 2 to dispense words of wisdom to those he meets: to the
pregnant runaway teen with whom he shares his hot dogs; to
the young people vigorous pedaling their racing bikes across
the empty highway; to the old fella tending bar near the
Mississippi River border between Iowa and Wisconsin. 
Instead, we hear only platitudes: how old age hasn't a single
redeeming feature, how it's tough to be on the outs with your
brother, how fighting in a major war and accidentally killing
one of your own can lead to a drinking problem.</P>
<P>  If advice is not the movie's strong point, then the picture of
rural, MidWest America as an unspoiled land of selfless
people surely is.  A guy who needs two canes to walk and
whose only transportation is a 33-year-old lawnmower is
going to depend on the kindness of strangers.  Not a single
person laughs at him or makes fun of the eccentric guy and
his unusual wheels.  When his machinery gives out on him
just as his own body is losing its elasticity, the folks invite him
into their homes and even fix up his vehicle at a cut rate. 
The bartender who gives Alvin his first beer in years, the
lawnmower repair twins who give him a nice discount, even
the pregnant teen who'd expect to want little to do with the
older generation--all have good hearts, are great listeners,
and seem fascinated by Alvin despite the meagerness of his
actual words.  What's bewitches them all is obviously his
determination to do things his way, the lack of a single
misgiving in his craggy expressive face or deliberate speech.</P>
<P>   Since the film is too slow-paced to interest the little ones
and since adults might be turned off by the G rating, you'd
not expect a huge audience for this Disney relaxer.  There
are some quiet gems to be found, and perhaps the movie will
restore your faith in humanity and make you somewhat
ashamed to live in a large, impersonal city.  As for me, I'll
take the softness of "Blue Velvet" over the tranquil landscape
depicted herein, the large edge of "The Elephant Man" over
the vastness of the American countryside, and the abstract
enigmas of "Lost Highway" over the rudimentary concrete of
the Iowa roads.</P>
<PRE>Rated G.  Running Time: 111 minutes.  (C) 1999
