<P>Since 1975's "Nashville," an American masterpiece and one of the 
greatest films ever made, Robert Altman has proven that he is a 
world-class filmmaker. Although his career since then has been noticably 
uneven, he always manages to come out on top, and in the last decade has 
made several successful motion pictures, including "The Player," "Short 
Cuts," and even "The Gingerbread Man." His latest film, the 
southern-based dark comedy "Cookie's Fortune," which gained a lot of 
buzz at this year's Sundance Film Festival, unfortunately falls into 
Altman's pile of disappointments (joining the likes of the inane "Ready 
to Wear"), and probably is his biggest misfire I've seen.</P>
<P>Set in the humble, little town of Holly Springs, Mississippi, Cookie 
(Patricia Neal) is an elderly and grieving widower who has several 
relatives nearby, none of which much seem to bother visiting her, and 
whose only actual friend is Willis (Charles S. Dutton), a kindly black 
man who lives with her to keep her company. Easter is quickly 
approaching, and when her two nieces, the kooky, determined Camille 
(Glenn Close), who is the director of the church's violent holiday play 
of "Salome," by Orson Welles, and the dim-witted, flaky Cora (Julianne 
Moore), drop by, they are horrified to discover Cookie dead in her 
upstairs bedroom, the victim of a suicide. Stating that suicide will not 
be permitted in their family, the quick-thinking Camille immediately 
brainwashes Cora into telling the police Cookie was murdered, and then 
goes about destroying evidence (she literally eats the suicide note) and 
setting up a "murder scene." Soon, however, the planted gun happens to 
contain the fingerprints of Willis, who is taken to the town's jail by 
the reluctant cops, who keep the cell door wide open and set up a game 
of Scrabble for him to play. Hearing word that her best buddy is in the 
slammer, Cora's tough 19-year-old daughter, Emma (Liv Tyler), becomes 
Willis' jail partner, taking time out only to make out with her "iffy" 
cop boyfriend (Chris O'Donnell). </P>
<P>There are two many obvious problems in "Cookie's Fortune" to count, but 
many that can't be ignored. The ensemble cast that Altman has gotten for 
this film is truly exceptional, but (aside from Dutton and Tyler) every 
single one of them is burdened with an annoyingly one-note character 
that isn't given any chance to grow within the nearly eventless 2-hour 
running time. Amid all of the "charming" eccentricities, all signs of 
realistic or even human characteristics have been abandoned for blatant 
caricatures that quickly test the viewer's nerves. In a film in which 
the majority of characters are related in some way, there is no excuse 
for the amount of relationships that aren't the least bit explored, or 
even given one scene, particularly between mother and daughter Cora and 
Emma, who have all of one scene together and one line exchange. Similar 
and far superior films in the "Southern eccentricity" genre are 1989's 
"Miss Firecracker" and 1997's "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil." 
It's been at least a year since I've viewed both of these movies, but 
they are more fresh in my mind, and certainly more memorable, than 
"Cookie's Fortune" which, as I write this, I saw about an hour ago.</P>
<P>It's a shame, too, because the performances are the central saving grace 
(which isn't nearly enough to save any graces at all concerning this 
movie). Since Dutton and Tyler are given the two fully-realized roles in 
the piece, their performances easily stand out, making the most out of 
what is certainly a lackluster screenplay, by Anne Rapp. Julianne Moore 
is the most lovable character in the bunch, mostly because of her 
genuine naivety. Ultimately, she is turned into the main comic relief 
and is forced to stand at a distance from the material. Glenn Close also 
is fine here, but too off-beat by a half for us to get involved or care 
at all about her, even though, I suspect, she wasn't meant to be 
particularly likable. Chris O'Donnell sleepwalks through his first film 
in two years (since the disasterous "Batman and Robin"), but it isn't 
his fault that he pretty much is put in a corner with nothing to do but 
occasionally kiss Tyler. Courtney B. Vance shows up three-fourths of the 
way into the film as a crime investigator and comes off as nothing more 
than an afterthought, as does Lyle Lovett, as Tyler's boss and friend at 
her fish hatchery job.</P>
<P>By the time "Cookie's Fortune" reached its climax which, to say the 
least, leaves something to be desired, I was left with one nagging 
question: what was the point? The movie is rarely funny, straining for 
laughs that no doubt sounded better on paper than in actual film form; 
there is no human interest, or any sort of interest at all, in the 
story; and very little at all comes to satisfying closure. Unlike 
Altman's "Nashville" or "The Player," "Cookie's Fortune" has nothing at 
all to say about anything, hoping that utter wackiness will be enough to 
salvage the proceedings. It isn't. Not by a long shot.</P>
