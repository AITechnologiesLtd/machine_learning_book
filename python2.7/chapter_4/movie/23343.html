<PRE>The Filth and The Fury
A film review by Max Messier
copyright 2000 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Good documentaries aren't hard to find.  Great documentaries are few and
far between the cracks of cinematic achievements.</P>
<P>The new documentary The Filth and the Fury ranks as one of the great
ones.  It chronicles the rise and tragic fall of the infamous British
Punk band The Sex Pistols, and the cultural impact they have spread upon
the world around us.  Director Julian Temple takes the film far above
the usual VH-1 retrospectives, recounting past glories, drug parties,
and the way a musician found God in a motel in Alabama, thus bringing
together the catalytic elements that resulted in the musical movement
called `Punk.'  The Sex Pistols were the forefathers of that movement.</P>
<P>In the late seventies, Britain's social upheaval was severe.  A stagnant
economy, unemployment, race riots, looting, and strikes intersected with
a strong distaste for royalty and the upper class.  A working class
revolution was in the works.  Punk music was its Gabriel's Trumpet, and
the Pistols were blowing with all of their might.</P>
<P>With this backdrop, the film then beautifully intertwines social
commentary with television commercials of the time, footage of riots,
and various news reports.  The film then juxtaposes current and past
interviews with all five band members as well as home footage of the
bandmates' childhood (including a rare interview with Sid Vicious before
his death in 1978).  The intimacy of these interviews and the evidence
of the social strife validate the actions of the members of the Pistols
and really makes you feel what the band was trying to convey in the
words and rhythms of its music.</P>
<P>Julian Temple was also responsible for the first film concerning the
rise and fall of the Sex Pistols: The Great Rock and Roll Swindle.  That
film painted the Pistols as a brilliant marketing tool in the hands of
their manager, Malcolm MacLaren.  The Filth and the Fury sets the record
straight for the first time.  It gives great insight into the
motivations of the Pistols, but it also gives the uneducated a great
perspective on how the Punk movement began and how it all came hurtling
to a blind halt by commercialism, social pressure, and the fear of
individuality.</P>
