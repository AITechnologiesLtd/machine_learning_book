<P>Brendan Fraser, action star? Yessiree-Bobby!! Take him, slap him into an
adventure/horror flick with a bunch of other semi-unknowns, some superb
mummy special effects, and an updated version of the 1932 Boris Karloff
classic of the same name, and you've got yourself a good ol' rock 'n roll
time at the movies!</P>
<P>PLOT:
Set in 1923, 3,000 years after the horrific mummification of a man who
fooled around with the Pharaoh's mistress, this tale follows three divergent
personalities searching for the ancient City of the Dead, where the mummy
and some awesome treasures are said to be buried. A librarian with a
penchant for all things ancient, her goofy brother, looking for the fortune
of his life, and Rick O'Connell, your modern day hero.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
The fun summer thrill ride of action-packed popcorn movies with extra cheese
has begun with a major Egyptian blast, in this part-romance, part-action,
part-horror, part-comedy kick in the entertainment nuts! I would qualify
this film as being one of the closest deemed worthy of the title of
Indiana Jones Jr., with its charismatic lead actor, in Brendan Fraser, its
non-stop adventurous tone, and its mouth-dropping special effects of the
Mummy and his wonderfully wicked world of evil. This is the perfect movie to
go see if you want to escape to a place of the past, with breath-taking
images of the desert, damsels in distress, swash-buckling and gun-toting
heroes and a gallery of mummies ready to skin you to the bone, in hopes of
regaining their own livelihood. Check your brain at the door, and enjoy the
bumpy ride, cause this one will have you laughing, screaming and sighing
your way into the mysterious world of ancient Egypt and its spooky-dooky
myths.</P>
<P>Credit the special effects department with most of this film's greatest
moments, but don't take away from the always entertaining script written by
the director himself, Stephen Sommers, and the enjoyable action sequences
which mixed comedy and a slick choreography of guns, knives, swords, kicks
and punches. The cast is also very good, with Fraser leading the way as the
man who likes to kick mummy ass, John Hannah as the always amusing brother
of the leading lady, and Kevin O'Connor as the quirky weasel who gets into
cahoots with the bandaged corpse himself. All in all, a fun time at the
movies, with plenty of action, comedy, adventure and romance to satisfy
everyone waiting impatiently for THE PHANTOM MENACE, and some of the coolest
special effects this side of THE MATRIX (7.5/10). In fact, it's a perfect
place to take your own "mummy" on Mother's Day this weekend. Then again,
thousands of flesh-eating bugs munching a man alive might not be her cup o'
tea :)</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Brendan Fraser was born in Indianapolis and raised in Europe and Canada. He
was the fourth son of a Canadian career bureaucrat whose job for the office
of tourism required him to say the least, do some travelling. His first
screen role was opposite River Phoenix and Lily Taylor in the
underappreciated film DOGFIGHT (8.5/10). He currently resides in L.A. with
his wife Afton and dog Wylie. He stands 6'3".
You may remember actor John Hannah from his gay role in FOUR WEDDINGS AND A
FUNERAL (8/10) and SLIDING DOORS (7.5/10) with Gwyneth Paltrow. Before he
decided on a career as an actor, John was an apprentice electrician for four
years. He gave this up after being accepted by a drama school in Glasgow.
The man who plays the Mummy is born in South Africa and his name is Arnold
Vosloo.
After director Stephen Sommers attended St-Johns University and The
University of Seville in Spain, he spent four years performing in theatre
groups and managing rock 'n roll bands throughout Europe. From there, he
relocated to L.A., and attended the USC School of Cinema-Television for
three years, earning a Master's Degree. He also wrote and directed his last
film called DEEP RISING.
Several follow-ups to the original MUMMY film from 1932 include THE MUMMY'S
HAND, THE MUMMY'S TOMB, THE MUMMY'S GHOST and THE MUMMY'S CURSE.
This film took 17 weeks to complete filming in Morocco and the United
Kingdom. The political climate in Egypt during the pre-production period of
this film, made it impossible to set up such a major movie with all of its
inherent logistical problems.</P>
