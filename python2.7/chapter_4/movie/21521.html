Wanting to Be `John Malkovich' 
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>How's this for a wild ride?  Shoot down a darkened
tunnel at an amazingly high speed.  Experience a
cathartic transformation as you take on the life of
someone else for 15 awe-inspiring minutes.  Finally,
drop into a ditch by the side of the New Jersey
Turnpike.  No, it's not the newest ride at your nearby
amusement park.  Rather, it's a unique life-affirming
journey that one can take by entering a strange
portal.  If you've ever wanted to get inside someone's
head, particularly John Malkovich's, then this is the
way to do it.</P>
<P>`Being John Malkovich' is a satisfyingly and sublimely
rich film about the people we are and the people that
we want to be.  Who we are can be a gut-wrenching
nightmare.  For those like Craig (John Cusack), it's a
self-affirmation of failure and a perpetual state of
hopelessness.  Slovenly dressed, lacking in charisma,
and hoping to make it as a professional puppeteer, his
life is one big dead end.  `There's no need for a
puppeteer in today's world,' he states.  It doesn't
matter that he's an excellent puppeteer (the sequences
featuring puppets are astounding); he's a man who only
wishes to escape from the confines of his dreary life.
 Equally dreary is his loveless marriage to wife Lotte
(an unrecognizable Cameron Diaz).  Whatever magic they
once had has faded.  Looking like inebriated victims
that never left the 1960s, they emptily talk about
having children while forcing themselves to seem
interested in each other's events of the day.  Lotte
seems more interested in her pets, which include a
loquacious parrot and a chimp that can untie knots. 
Meanwhile, it's time for Craig to get a job because
his life as a street performer brings him more black
eyes than quarters (the scene that makes this evident,
featuring a nun and monk puppet is hilarious).</P>
<P>The ad that Craig answers brings him to LesterCorp,
situated on the 7½ floor of a building where access
requires you to press the elevator's emergency stop
button at just the right moment.  Then, you need to
take the crowbar to force the doors open while the
alarm rings loudly in the background.  On this floor,
the ceiling is only 5 feet high ‘to keep overhead
low,' quips the company's President (Orson Bean). 
This work environment confines him even more, and it's
no help that he's falling head over heels for Maxine
(Catherine Keener), a strong-willed co-worker that
flaunts her sexuality with as much chutzpah as her
merciless belittlement of him.  By this point, I think
that I'd want to be anybody but him too.</P>
<P>However, he soon makes a tremendous discovery that not
only may be the answer to his prayers, but also sets
the film's enjoyably surreal tone.  Craig discovers a
portal that actually allows him to enter the mind of
John Malkovich (Malkovich plays himself).  By assuming
this new body, all fears and disappointments are left
behind.  For him, this is the ultimate experience as
both a puppeteer and as a man who desperately wants to
leave his dismal life behind.  But it also holds some
interesting opportunities for Maxine, who wants to
exploit it as a business, and Lotte, who finds it
weirdly, sexually stimulating.  </P>
<P>BJM is endlessly inventive and continues to surprise
throughout while glazing the film with fresh ideas and
sharp dialogue.  I was especially impressed with a
sequence where Malkovich enters his own brain to find
out what he himself is really like.  Director Spike
Jonze deftly handles a complexly woven tapestry of
ideas and manages to find a satisfying resolution to
each.  And I suspect that you'll be revisiting many of
the ideas once you've left the theatre.  Expect an
Oscar nod for Best Film.  Thank goodness this film
wasn't called `Being Al Gore.'</P>
