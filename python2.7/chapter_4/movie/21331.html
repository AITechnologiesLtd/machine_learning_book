 The Best Man (1999) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Taye Diggs, Nia Long,
Morris Chestnut, Sanaa Lathan, Harold Perrineau, Terrence Howard, Monica
Calhoun and Melissa De Sousa. Written and directed by Malcolm D. Lee</P>
<P> You know a script is strong and universal when, after seeing a movie, you
believe that the story will work with any group of actors of any
nationality or ethnicity.</P>
<P> Thus is the case of "The Best Man," an impressive movie debut from
writer-director Malcolm D. Lee. And, yes, he's related to that other Lee -
Spike.</P>
<PRE> But nepotism was no factor here.</PRE>
<P> Malcolm D. Lee has written a romantic comedy that features some very
well-defined, likable, but flawed characters.</P>
<P> The set-up for "The Best Man" is simple. Harper Stewart (Taye Diggs) has
just learned that his first novel, a fictitious account of his friends and
their times together at college, has been chosen to be an Oprah book of the
month.</P>
<P> He is headed from Chicago to New York not only to celebrate his success,
but to stand as best man to one of his college buddies, Lance (Morris
Chestnut).</P>
<P> Unfortunately, Harper also learns that Jordan (Nia Long), another of his
college-crowd friends, has obtained an advance copy of the book and that it
is making the rounds of all his old gang.</P>
<P> An easy-to-digest premise that could have fallen flat if not handled
correctly. But Lee displays a wonderful ear for dialogue and a deft pen for
characterization that holds the audience and makes them care about these
people.</P>
<P> What is interesting is despite the fact that all the main characters are
black, color really is not an issue. True there is some talk about the
sexual politics and gender expectations between black men and black women,
but change a couple of words and this story could have been told in Chinese
or Croatian.</P>
<P> The point is the situations and characters are easily recognizable and are
common to the human condition.</P>
<P> The cast works together very smoothly, reacting off each other with the
timing and precision of an Army drill team.</P>
<P> Diggs, of course, is one of the sexiest men in movies today. His Harper is
a man walking a tightrope, waiting for the shoe to drop as his book is
passed from friend to friend, revealing secrets that should have remained
buried.</P>
<P> He is a man fearful of commitment. Despite being in a two-year, loving
relationship with his girlfriend, Robin (Sanaa Lathan), he cannot take that
final step toward marriage.</P>
<P> Long's Jordan is a career-driven woman regretting her one missed
opportunity with Harper. She is a goal-oriented, self-assured person who
also is not afraid to reveal a vulnerability.</P>
<P> Chestnut's Lance is a God-fearing, Bible-quoting football megastar. His is
a character that could have been caricature, but Chestnut fleshes him out,
showing not only his strength, but his pride and his weaknesses.</P>
<P> Rounding out the cast are Harold Perrineau, Terrence Howard, Monica
Calhoun and Melissa De Sousa. This is the prettiest cast of actors to hit
the screen in a long time. Yet their looks do not obscure their finely
honed performances.</P>
<P> "The Best Man" is a most enjoyable motion picture, a date movie that will
have you laughing as well as bring a tear or two to your eyes.</P>
<P> It is lively, it sparkles and is one of the most life-affirming movies to
hit the screen in a long time. "The Best Man" is a gem - treasure it.</P>
