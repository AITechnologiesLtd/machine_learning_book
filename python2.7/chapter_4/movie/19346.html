<P>   Human beings have roamed the earth for two million years. 
What we call civilization began about seven thousand years
ago.  During the past seven millennia, the world has
witnessed every form of government and about as many
patterns of culture as can be imagined.  Some cultures value
money above all, others religion.  Most people have spent all
of their time in rural areas while in the more developed areas
the rustic pleasures exist only as a break from urban stress. 
Despite the variety of peoples, there is just one set of taboos
that all civilizations have supported: their interdictions center
on sex.  While just a bare handful of cultures have condoned
incest, all have proscribed sexual relations outside of
marriage.  Though this restriction is often honored in the
breach, one truth is preeminent: a married person cannot
have sexual relations with other than his or her spouse
without threatening their marriage.  Why this unusual
importance on sexual fidelity?  Interpretations abound.  In his
final film, "Eyes Wide Shut," one of America's foremost
directors, Stanley Kubrick, investigates the significance of sex
as both an obsession and a source of jealousy of the most
consequential kind.  The film, which was started in 1995 and
completed a very short time before the director's death four
years later, has been kept under heavy wraps, presumably to
increase the public's curiosity.  Virtually no details were made
public until a critic from a London newspaper broke with a
premature review which (though the essay all but called the
film a masterwork) created considerable wrath among
executives in the releasing studio.</P>
<P>   Sexual obsession and jealousy are not new themes in
literature, theater, and movies.  You need only look back to
the ancient Greek stage to find the motifs at work in plays
like the Agamemnon of Aeschylus and the Medea of
Euripides.  What gives "Eyes Wide Shut" its particular
distinction is only partly the story, but mainly its use of a
married couple, both major actors, in the lead roles: Tom
Cruise as Dr. William Harford, a successful practitioner
deficient in the departments of personality and understanding;
and Nicole Kidman as his stay-at-home wife, Alice, a woman
who is presumably looking for a job but has a full-time career
conjuring up particularly Freudian dreams and fantasies. 
Kubrick opens the film boldly on an image of Alice, her robe
dropping from her shoulders to reveal a naked back: but
when Kubrick almost immediately blacks out the scene, he is
hinting at his motif.  "Eyes Wide Shut" is about temptation
and retreat; perpetual obsession and failed realization.  The
movie is a portrayal of sexual intrigue that brings to mind
playwright Arthur Schnitzler's displays of libidinous yearnings
among the rich and powerful in his own Austria of the past
century.  In fact it's no happenstance that Kubrick's movie is
closely based on one of Schnitzler's lesser works of fiction,
"Traumnovelle" (Dream Story).  Schnitzler's narrative is given
a dazzling physical re-creation before Kubrick's lens, the
cryptic atmosphere jogged by Jocelyn Pook's aesthetically
appealing sound track and a costume design by Marit Allen
that in one extended scene effectively recreates the
Hapsburg Empire in our own time.</P>
<P>   To say that this movie is a version of Billy Wilder's 1955
comedy "The Seven Year Itch"--about the fantasies Tom
Ewell enjoys of the sexpot (Marilyn Monroe) who movies in
upstairs while his wife is vacationing--would be a ludicrous
analogy, to be sure, grossly trivializing Kubrick's themes. 
And yet "Eyes Wide Shut" re-shapes the comic cleverness of
"Itch" into an almost Greek tragic construct.  Bill and Alice
have been married for nine years and have a lovely seven-
year-old daughter.  They are financially secure and travel in
New York's upper-middle class circles. A sexual restlessness
materializes, given full vent at a party held by millionaire
Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack).  While Bill receives the
flirtatious attentions of two bimbos, Alice, who by now is tipsy,
is aroused during a coquettish dance of her own with a suave
Hungarian who attempts to seduce her.  When the couple
return home, relaxing by smoking pot, Alice becomes
aggressive while debating her husband about the sexual
differences between men and women, describing a near-affair
she had with a sailor.  As Bill imagines the liaison (shown in
several black-and-white, dream-like images) his envy gets the
better of him.  He is led into a series of connections with
love-hungry women, beginning with contact with the
distressed Mary (Marie Richardson) who declares her love for
Bill and an indifference toward with her fiance.  Later allowing
himself to be almost seduced by a hooker (Vinessa Shaw),
he learns from a jazz pianist friend (Todd Field) of a location
in which masked orgies take place.  Renting a costume from
the eccentric Milich (Rade Sherbedgia), he taxis to the
mansion and is attracted to a woman who leads him on a
tour of the house, in whose rooms costumed couples are
bumping and thrusting (their gyrations partially hidden by
digitally created figures recently introduced to avoid an NC-17
rating).  </P>
<P>   If you were ever curious about whether a doctor--who has
seen scores, perhaps hundreds of naked bodies of patients--
can maintain his libido or whether he would suffer the fate of
a chocolatier who is so entombed in his creation that he
eschews the consumption of his own product, this film
provides an answer.  No way is Bill's professional exposure
to the female form desensitizing.  As he wanders about the
mansion entranced and amazed by the orgiastic animations
about him, and as he meanders about the streets of New
York (exquisitely re-created in Pinewood Studios), his mojo
remains on the same high peak enjoyed by Austin Powers in
an obviously more lighthearted movie.  Under the spell of his
wife's revelations about a near-affair, he sees sex
everywhere--his wife's carnal yearnings restricted to Freudian
dreams while her husband's are furthered by dreamlike
reality.  </P>
<P>  At times the film looks like a creation of Harold Pinter, so
menacing is the orgy in which Bill soon finds himself out of
his depths.  At other times we could swear that "Eyes Wide
Shut" is the creation of a Franz Kafka, Alice's nightmares and
the guilt-ridden Bill's actual experiences creating a mysterious
and alluring ambiance.</P>
<P>   "Eyes Wide Shut" is not the masterpiece that some have
expected it to come from the vivid imagination of the creator
of such bold works as "Dr. Strangelove," "2001," "Full Metal
Jacket," "The Shining" and "Clockwork Orange."  Stanley
Kubrick took his time, a meticulous man who has obviously
planned each shot with impeccable attention.  His visual style
is manifest in every scene, in the way he conveys the murky
menace of New York streets by night, the desperation of the
opulent at a massive, costumed orgy that at one point turns
into a trial that would have titillated Torquemada, the intimate
scenes that take place between a man and wife who have
become perhaps too comfortable with each other and are
seeking new and dangerous games to play.  With a classic
performance by Nicole Kidman, whether on the dance floor
teasing her unctuous partner or stretched out vulnerably on
her bed overwhelmed by her imagination, "Eyes Wide Shut"
is a fitting conclusion to Mr. Kubrick's monumental career as
a director of challenging fare, inviting a variety of
interpretations from his cineastes.  Conversations, especially
between Alice and Bill, are almost painfully deliberate, as
though Kubrick  were petitioning his audience to lean on each
word as though concocted on Mount Sinai.  Despite its length
of better than two and one-half hours, there is not a wasted
sliver of celluloid in this engaging--if not quite overpowering--
tale.</P>
