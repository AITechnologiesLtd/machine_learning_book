<PRE>                              TOPSY TURVY
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Mike Leigh takes a break from his
          films about the lower classes to give us a sort of
          concert film docu-drama about the first production
          of the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta THE MIKADO,
          performed by the famous D'Oyly Carte Opera Company.
          Many different personalities come together and many
          plot threads are woven together to tell the
          complete story--or at any rate as much as you would
          want at one sitting--of how the production came to
          be. Rating: 8 (0 to 10), high +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     The Savoy Theatre, London, March 14, 1885, saw the world premiere
performance of the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta THE MIKADO, quite
possibly the most popular operetta ever written.  Mike Leigh whose
films of late have dealt with the slice of life problems of the lower
classes instead this time tells us the story of the birth of this
operetta, one that almost did not make it to the stage after a
production beset with problems.</P>
<P>     As the film opens Sir Arthur Sullivan (Allan Corduner) is ailing.
As he sees the end of his life coming, he wants to get on to writing
serious music.  Sullivan would like to write a major serious opera.  He
had written the scores for several William Gilbert (Jim Broadbent)
comic librettos, but he has decided that he should get on with his
serious writing while he still could.  Gilbert had come to the end of
creative streak and his new plays were sounding a lot like his old
plays.  Sullivan wished to remain friends with Gilbert, but wanted no
more to do with their partnership.  Gilbert, whom Broadbent plays as
witty without being really intelligent, is bewildered at the loss of
his partner.  In a nick of time a traveling fair from Japan gives
Gilbert the inspiration to set a story in Japan.</P>
<P>     For once it may be good for the viewer to know ahead of time that
the story is leading to the production of THE MIKADO.  Otherwise the
first half-hour or so would seem aimless and pointless.  Watching the
elements collect in the early stages of the formation of a classic is
much like watching the dust collect in the early stages of the
formation of a star.  There is not much to see.</P>
<P>     Speaking of stars, this film has been cast with very few.  Leigh
has chosen mostly lessor luminaries but nonetheless quality actors for
nearly every role.  He intends the draw to be curiosity about the
subject matter rather than to see any well-known actor's next film.  On
seeing the film I had to say that the only face familiar to me was that
of Jim Broadbent, and him I knew from BBC imports.  This is an
intelligent policy with so many good but unknown actors to choose from
in Britain.</P>
<P>     By the second half of the film it is clear what we are seeing.  We
see some extended shots of the preparation, much as we would see in a
current documentary.  In very realistic style we will see three or four
actors on a stage going over the minutiae of how to pronounce the words
of the script and where to put emphasis in the lines.  Acting seems to
have changed very little in 115 years.  Elsewhere we see negotiations
over what will and will not be worn for costumes.  Through it all
Gilbert is demanding to tyrannical.  In one incident he cuts a well-
liked song a day before production making very clear that the cast has
performed it excellently, but that his own song is at fault.  The cast
is willing to take Gilbert's treatment, but rebels because they think
the song should be performed.</P>
<P>     One stylistic problem is the detailed inclusion of a scene in a
bordello.  It seems out of place with the rest of the film and
certainly it would seem that the nudity could be implied rather than
graphic.  The scene seems to be calculated to give the film a more
profitable rating, as there is little else in the film worthy of more
than a PG-rating.  Arthur Sullivan's dilemma of having to choose
between creating popular crowd-pleasing entertainment or high art
revisits an argument carried on in such films as SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS and
THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD.  Leigh who wrote and directed is clearly a fan of
Gilbert and Sullivan as a duo and would clearly vote for Sullivan's
staying with popular art.  Most of the film takes place in rooms, but
the film creates a very credible version of England in the 1880s.</P>
<P>     Mike Leigh gives us a very credible view of what it must have been
like to be present at the production of THE MIKADO.  It gives more than
a little insight into similarities and differences in the creative
process 115 years ago and today.  I give it an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale
and a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
