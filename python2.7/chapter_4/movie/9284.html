                          EXTREME MEASURES 1996
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
                        2  :-) :-)  for Dr Jekyll</PRE>
<P>Cast: Hugh Grant, Gene Hackman, Sarah Jessica Parker, David Morse, Bill
Nunn, Debra Monk, Paul Guilfoyle Director: Michael Apted Screenplay:
Tony Gilroy based on the novel by by Michael Palmer</P>
<P>As a member of the medical profession, I encourage the practice of organ
donation for the furtherance of research and medical science. So if
you'll kindly fill out this form. It merely states that members of my
trade can use your heart, kidneys and liver for transplantation. I
promise that the rest of the body will not go to waste, and will make
great viewing in an anatomy dissection lab. Imagine the heartfelt
appreciation of the first year medical students as they poke and prod
your insides and out, with fingers and scalpels not sparing any orifice.
I remember the "Oooohs" and "Aaaahs" having gone through the ritual
myself. If there is any pathology of note like a brain tumour,
perforated viscus or ambiguous genitalia, don't fret, we always pickle
and pot the most interesting specimens for display in our splendid
anatomy museum. Did I also mention that we want your body only after you
are dead, and not before.</P>
<P>When a prominent doctor becomes a renegade, we have the antiphony of
fears that Jekyll brings out in Hyde. Don't fear the doctor that wants
to kill a million people with a lethal viral genocidic bomb, fear the
one who wants your spine column so he can grow some pretty neural twine.
It seems that the overly clever doctor, is usually the one who ends up
preoccupied with himself and his work.</P>
<P>Dr. Lawrence Myric (Gene Hackman), a brilliant neurologist, has decided
to break his Hippocratic oath by kidnapping homeless men, and using them
as guinea pigs in his otherwise admirable feat of growing neural tissue.
This would be an outstanding achievement, no less deserving of a noble
prize, if the lame can once again walk, and the blind see. However, his
questionable method of research cannot be overlooked simply because he
carries good intentions. Hackman carries the natural elements of being
repugnant, which makes him ideal as the immoral doctor who sacrifices
his principles in place of his work. Dr Guy Luthan (Hugh Grant), seems a
bit too dithery and indecisive to make a good casualty officer; but once
out of the emergency seems more at ease with himself, despite being
shot, framed and beaten for uncovering the body stealing conspiracy.
Sarah Jessica Parker has a small but key role to play in the movie, and
is otherwise rarely seen.</P>
<P>So I did enjoy this psychological, medical thriller because it sparked
some professional interest within. The story isn't as tight or
suffocating as "Coma", but carries enough edge to keep you suspicious of
your local emergency department and doctor. When bodies start going
missing, think experimentation on a scale of extreme measures.</P>
