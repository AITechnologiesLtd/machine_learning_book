<P>by Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>    I never thought any film labeled as a "romantic comedy" could be
this good. I always associate a certain vocabulary with films commonly
referred to as romantic comedies; words in this vocabulary
include--trite, phony, contrived, dull, formulaic, careful, and shallow.
I was relieved as I watched As Good as it Gets because I couldn't
associate any of these words with this film. In fact, James L. Brooks'
new film is the antithesis of all of these words combined, a moving,
often thought-provoking story about a truly awful individual.</P>
<P>    That individual is Melvin Udall, a racist, gay-hating,
obsessive-compulsive curmudgeon. He's also a novelist and lives in an
upper class apartment in New York. Across the hall is Simon (Greg
Kinnear), a gay artist who is, of course, extremely nice, and has a cute
little dog. Melvin eats lunch every day in the same diner, and his
waitress is always Carol (Helen Hunt), a mother just barely scraping by
because her son is sickly and always needing medical attention.</P>
<P>    One fateful day, Simon is painting a picture of a friend of a friend
(Skeet Ulrich), whose friends are in the other room, stealing all of
Simon's things. When Simon goes to investigate, he gets beaten within an
inch of his life. He loses all inspiration for painting and soon runs
out of money. Meanwhile, Melvin really likes Carol, and despite his
conduct towards her, he pays for real medical care for her son, who soon
recovers completely. Then, the three people unite in a road trip to
Baltimore in order for Simon to get money from his parents, to whom he
hasn't spoken in years.</P>
<P>    The first thing that really struck me about As Good as it Gets are
the risks it takes, in dialogue and ultimately in characterizations.
Melvin, for instance, is not one of those likable old curmudgeons--this
guy is really despicable. In one extremely tense scene, he makes the
mistake of insinuating that Carol's son doesn't have a long time to
live, and her reaction to this is one of complete emotional rage. He
also makes jokes--jokes that aren't really intended to be funny--about
people's weight, religion (he attacks Jews in one scene), and sexuality
(note the almost endless jokes about Simon and his homosexuality).</P>
<P>    Though these moments aren't exactly pleasant, they do help to create
a very solid character. This character is brought to life even more so
by Jack Nicholson's performance--as far as I'm concerned, this is his
best performance since One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Nicholson tends
to have that "I'm Jack Nicholson" aura around him when he's playing bad
guys or token characters, but here he gives a deep and convincing
performance as Melvin. Later developments of the character are extreme,
and we can still see the same old Melvin there, but we know he's trying
thanks to Nicholson.</P>
<P>    The supporting performances are of the best this year. Helen Hunt
proves once again that she can effortlessly upstage the sometimes
limited realm of television and gives a truly moving performance as a
strong-minded woman who really loves her son. Kinnear, too, goes way
beyond anything I've ever seen him in (I still remember him from Talk
Soup) and creates this frustrated man with ease.</P>
<P>    There is something truly magical and refreshing about this film--it
left me with a smile on my face that lasted for hours and hours after
the film was over. The mixture of different people is fascinating and
fun to watch. I loved these characters, and I loved their interactions
through Brooks' witty dialogue and realistic situations. I wanted to
believe that these people are alive somewhere in New York, just as
depicted in this film. And when the screen blacks out in the end, I knew
they were going to go right on living, and that everything would be
okay.</P>
