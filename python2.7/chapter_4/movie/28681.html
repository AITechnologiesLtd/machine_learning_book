<P>It has been said that no motion picture based on a video game can be any 
good, because to watch a movie with live-action characters and surroundings 
isn't even remotely the same, or as satisfying, as directly interacting with 
their digital counterparts. With 1995's "Mortal Kombat" being the only 
feature film I can think of to break the video-game-to-movie curse, "Lara 
Croft: Tomb Raider," drearily directed by Simon West (1997's "Con Air"), has 
no such luck. </P>
<P>This latest potential summer blockbuster has a lot riding on it; not only 
could the movie catapult Academy Award Winner Angelina Jolie (1999's "Girl, 
Interrupted") to superstar status, but it could be the first in a potential 
big-screen series. Never having played the video game, but with a brother who 
is a fan, he couldn't have summed it up better as we left the theater: "Aside 
from a few of the action scenes, the rest of the movie is sleep-inducing." 
Rarely has such a big-budget action movie been as utterly boring as "Tomb 
Raider" is. </P>
<P>Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie) is a tomb raider (whatever that is) who lives in 
an 85-bedroom mansion, complete with a servant, an assistant (Noah Taylor), 
and a pet robot, passed down to her from her deceased father, Lord Croft 
(Jolie's real-life dad Jon Voight). Just as all nine planets are about to 
align (an occurrence, we learn, that only happens every 5,000 years), Lara 
stumbles upon a clock her beloved father hid in the house that holds half of 
the key to taking control of time. The other part--a Triangle of Light broken 
into two pieces--has been hidden on opposite sides of the earth, something 
that the evil Manfred Powell (Iain Glen) has set out to locate in time for 
the eclipse. With not much time remaining, Lara ventures off after Powell and 
his henchmen, determined to do her dear dad proud. </P>
<P>The convoluted plotting of "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider" doesn't make a whole lot 
of sense, but that wouldn't matter if the movie was at least absorbing and 
exciting. It isn't, however, so what we get is a slow-moving snoozer that 
features so much dull exposition it hardly has time for what the viewer has 
come for--action. At 98 minutes, the film feels as if it is well over two 
hours, with little of interest occurring at any point. In their attempt to 
explain who Lara Croft is for the uninitiated, screenwriters Patrick Massett 
and John Zinman spend far too much time setting things up, and even then, we 
still don't get a true idea of what makes Lara tick. </P>
<P>Angelina Jolie is physically perfect for the coveted role of Lara Croft, but 
as a person, she is nothing more than a blank slate. Jolie has been a 
terrific actress in the past, and even has an Oscar to prove it, but she 
isn't able to give us an idea of who her character is, or why we should even 
like or care about her. Aside from the fact that her father died and she is 
crafty with weapons and fighting, Lara is an uninteresting, underdeveloped 
presence, and the part gets no help from Jolie. Though no fault of the 
actress, one other problem with Lara is, funnily enough, her breasts. At 
almost no point throughout do they ever look remotely real, and for Jolie's 
body frame, they are humorously too large and stand directly out, rather than 
naturally slope downward. I mention this minor criticism because Jolie's fake 
breasts serve no purpose for either her character or the movie; they're 
merely exploitive. </P>
<P>"Tomb Raider" has two good scenes amidst the creative dead zone that 
surrounds them. One involves stone statues coming to life in a tomb, which 
Lara has to fight off, and the other is the climactic action sequence set in 
a snowy cave, which is appropriately taut and well-shot. They not only hint 
at the thrilling movie this could have been, but expose the other lifeless 75 
minutes for what they truly are: a waste of time. </P>
