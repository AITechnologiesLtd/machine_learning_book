<P>         Conventional wisdom says any film that spends an inordinantly
long amount of time on the shelf between its production and its
release must be a piece of junk.</P>
<P>  To get an idea of how long ``Nightwatch'' has been on hold,
please note the trailer for it was attached first to ``Scream'' in
December 1996 and then to ``Scream 2'' last Christmas.</P>
<P>  Astonishingly, the movie turns out to be a stylish little
horror show that's certainly better than most of its kind.</P>
<P>  The film is a remake by Danish director Ole Bornedal of his
own ``Nattevagten,'' a sizable hit abroad that has rarely been seen in
America.  A very boyish-looking Ewan McGregor plays Martin, a law
student who takes a job as a night watchman in a decrepit Los Angeles
morgue.</P>
<P>  Business there is brisk, since a serial killer is butchering
prostitutes and taking their eyes as trophies. Inspector Cray (Nick
Nol-te) is not-so-hot on the case.</P>
<P>  As the bodies pile up, Martin eventually becomes a suspect
in the slayings, but more likely culprits include a pill-popping
doctor (Brad Dourif), the unbalanced former security guard (Lonny
Chapman) and even Martin's misogynistic best friend James (Josh
Brolin), a twisted character who delights in manipulating and
degrading the opposite sex.</P>
<P>  Frankly, women don't fare too well in ``Nightwatch,'' and
Bornedal's tendency to linger on images of abuse taints the picture as
a whole. A restaurant scene featuring Martin and a down-and-out
prostitute engaging in behavior that might make even George Michael
blush is intended to be humorous, but comes off as crass exploitation.</P>
<P>  The palpable erotic vibe between Martin and James, on the
other hand, seems like something Bornedal and co-writer Steven
Soderbergh may not have intended: The looks James and Martin exchange
are ripe with suggestiveness, and when James pressures Martin into
fooling around with a hooker James has already slept with, it feels
like a sex-by-proxy situation.</P>
<P>  What a decent-enough guy like Martin is doing hanging around
with such a cretin is the movie's real mystery, much more difficult to
figure out than the identity of the murderer.</P>
<P>  Bornedal seems to have been more intrigued by Martin's
adjustment to life in the morgue, and the director makes excellent use
of the Cinemascope frame and some disturbing sound effects (such as
the amplified flapping of moths' wings) to show how our hero is
overwhelmed by his cold, spacious workplace.</P>
<P>  In addition to creating an often unnerving atmosphere - even
in its climax, which turns out to be exciting and absurd at the same
time - ``Nightwatch'' is also notable as another one of the
charismatic McGregor's quirky performances.</P>
<P>  Though he struggles at times to suppress his Scottish
accent, McGregor delights in capturing Martin's odd little details,
such as the way his nose sweats when he's tense.</P>
<P>  Brolin is memorably loathsome but Nolte and Patricia
Arquette, as Martin's lover, are greatly underused and photographed so
unmercifully they look ready for the morgue themselves.</P>
