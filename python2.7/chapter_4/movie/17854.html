3 Stars (Out of 4)</PRE>
<P>It has been said more than once that imitation is the highest form of 
flattery. Hollywood works much the same way, as only the truly great 
films seem to find themselves being imitated directly or indirectly in 
future releases. The one question that remains is whether or not an 
imitation can be as good as or better than an original. Sequels 
certainly don't tend to be, and remakes are very mixed. But what about 
in a movie like Life, where deja vu exists with no less than 5 other 
films but some level of originality is still in place? Director Ted 
Demme seems to have proven so.</P>
<P>Ray (Eddie Murphy) is a low life pick-pocket who makes a "living" going 
from petty crime to petty crime. Despite being witty, he seems to hold 
very little close to him emotionally, except for his father's grave, 
and has little sense of the true meaning of life.</P>
<P>Claude (Martin Lawrence) is a far more proper man. He has a job lined up 
for himself at the bank, and is almost over some bad debts. 
Unfortunately, he too has no true ambition in life, and plans on 
spending his money on Yankees tickets, rather than settling down and 
getting married to a woman that clearly loves him.</P>
<P>Through a very odd set of events that seems to wander from crime to 
crime, in a slow and boring fashion, the two men end up being sentenced 
to life in jail together, for a crime they did not commit. It is here 
that the rest of the film is to unfold, and where Claude and Ray are to 
learn exactly what a life sentence really is, and what it can take away 
from you.</P>
<P>A mere five years ago, The Shawshank Redemption was released and it had 
enormous success. Obviously, there are some stark similarities between 
the two films. Both feature an innocent protagonist (In Life's case, 
protagonists) who are in for the ultimate punishment. And both films go 
on to give commentaries on the institutionalization that prison can 
cause, by showing an older inmate dealing with a reality that the place 
he is soon to depart, has become a home to him. But that is where the 
similarities to that production end.</P>
<P>Other films, like Mr. Saturday Night, show two men growing old together 
and dealing with the cards they have been dealt. But none do so as 
spectacularly as this one. There are also scenes lifted from, but not 
limited to, Stir Crazy, Murder in the First, and Spartacus. But none of 
those have any true similarities beyond the obvious settings (prison) 
and situations. So, despite being very similar, Life does manage to take 
it's own direction.</P>
<P>Another potential grim point for this film is the obvious lack of 
reputable actors in the primary casting. To date, Martin Lawrence has 
done nothing that would qualify him to play what ultimately is a serious 
role in a semi-dramatic film. Especially not one that transcends so many 
generations, and requires him to be as young as 20 and as old as 90. The 
same can be said of Eddie Murphy, who, despite some great comedic works 
over time, has done little of a decent dramatic nature. Fortunately, for 
the benefit of this film, they both turn out beautiful performances that 
are certainly their finest so far.</P>
<P>The finest acting out of the two leads comes in the later part of the 
film. As the two progressively age, and the wrinkles on their face 
multiply, you see how well Martin and Murphy have adapted to playing a 
far elder role in a very realistic manner. Not only do they change their 
mannerisms and voices, but you can truly sense a change in overall 
persona within their characters. That is certainly something you can't 
remember seeing before out of these two foul mouthed comedians.</P>
<P>One of the weaker elements of this film is the opening. It takes a while 
to get things into place, and the movie does a relatively poor job of 
entertaining the audience for the first 20 minutes or so, beyond some 
occasional humor. Also, in a classic, yet extremely cheap move, the 
movie skips some much needed details in order to finally get things 
going. Although you are pleased that after those 20 minutes a plot 
emerges that is consistent with the film, you still are left with a 
feeling that something is missing. One scene features the two men in a 
holding cell, optimistic that since they are truly innocent, they will 
be acquitted. The next scene is merely a judge slamming down a gavel, 
pronouncing the word "life." Now, I fully understand that the film has 
neither the time nor ability to explore a trial sequence, but this all 
could have been avoided by merely cutting the prior scene in the holding 
cell.</P>
<P>The ultimate question that can be posed is whether or not a film is 
quality entertainment. The answer in regards to this production is 
"yes." There is an element of fine acting by two actors with potential 
that the world did not previously know of. There is an unfortunate down 
side in the film's opening, but that is forgivable. Ultimately, the 
driving force behind Life is that it finally shows that imitation can be 
quality as well.</P>
