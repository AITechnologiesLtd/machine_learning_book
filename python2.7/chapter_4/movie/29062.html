<PRE>THE PRINCESS DIARIES
A film review by Pete Croatto
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Anne Hathaway is a gorgeous, young woman with a gentle screen charisma. 
It's hard to believe she will turn 19 this fall; she looks and presents
herself like a woman who knows all the answers.</P>
<P>This is someone who should not be the lead role in a movie about puberty
blues, but here she is.  In Garry Marshall's latest outing, The Princess
Diaries, Hathaway plays a smart, gawky 10th grader who learns she is the
heir to the throne of a small European country.</P>
<P>The news is broken to Hathaway by her long-lost grandmother (Julie
Andrews), queen of fictional Genovia, while she tends to business at the
country's embassy in San Francisco.  Genovia is in desperate need of a
ruler and needs Hathaway to take over after her father's death.  Despite
her doubts, California klutz Hathaway agrees to take "princess lessons"
from Andrews and trusted chauffer Hector Elizondo before deciding
whether to rule a country or take the SATs.</P>
<P>This is all very familiar territory for Marshall, who directed Pretty
Woman over a decade ago.  However, Pretty Woman worked because of a
brilliantly brash performance by a pre-superstar Julia Roberts and the
movie's take as an adult fairly tale.  With The Princess Diaries, there
isn't anything distinctive to make it particularly memorable.</P>
<P>Among the flaws in Gina Wendkos' script, based on Meg Cabot's novel, is
the constant reliance on Hathaway's clumsiness.  She breaks things, has
trouble putting on panty hose, falls down a lot.  I'd love to see the
day when a comedy doesn't have to feature a beautiful woman flailing
around like she has an inner ear problem.  Words can be just as funny
coming out of a woman's mouth as they can a man's.  Watch Madeline Kahn
in Young Frankenstein for proof.</P>
<P>The script also doesn't have the wink-wink humor (like Shrek) that makes
a family film appealing to adults.  While the goofiness and pretty cast
(teen siren Mandy Moore has a sizable role as Hathaway's nemesis) will
certainly satisfy kids, there's really not a lot for grown-ups to
enjoy.  Andrews and Elizondo (in Pretty Woman mode) give spirited
performances, but they don't get a lot to do.  However, a dance scene
between the two is the movie's sweetest moment and hints at what could
have been.</P>
<P>This is Hathaway's movie, which is both a good and a bad thing.  She's
positively stunning and shows talent despite the clunky plot.  However,
I have a major problem with her character.  Even in frizzy hair and
Elvis Costello glasses, she would be popular in just about any high
school in America.  You can only imagine what Hathaway looks like in
princess mode.</P>
<P>Still, the leggy, elegant Hathaway is the lead in a movie that takes a
somewhat serious look at the awkwardness of growing up and the value of
a person's character.  I saw the movie with an audience during a Friday
matinee, consisting mostly of kids who probably are or soon will be
going through the same problems.  Certainly, The Princess Diaries isn't
the only culprit of questionable adolescent casting:  Varsity Blues and
She's All That immediately come to mind as well.  In The Princess
Diaries, Hathaway's presence also deflates her character's regal
metamorphosis.  What exactly was there to transform in the first place?</P>
