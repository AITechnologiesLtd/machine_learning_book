<PRE>Blade (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 35</PRE>
<P>"Blade" is an escapist film that combines action,
horror and science fiction.  Based on a comic
book series, "Blade" is energetic and watchable.
The special effects are excellent.  The plot
even has some depth.  Still, it has the feel of
a big budget, violent version of a Saturday
Morning cartoon show, while Wesley Snipes
demonstrates the emotional range of a gargoyle
statue.</P>
<P>You might not be aware of this, but there are
vampires living among us.  They own all the cops.
They hang out in designated nightclubs, where they
dance in ecstacy under showers that spew blood.
Apparently, they are all martial arts experts as well.</P>
<P>Snipes is Blade, who is half-human and half-some-
special-version-of-vampire.  Like Batman, he has
gymnastic abilities, a tool chest full of weapons,
and sullenly stalks his prey, which are vampires
instead of criminals.  Naturally, the vampires don't
like this and conspire to get him, especially
Stephen Dorff, who needs Blade for an evil plan
to bring a Vampire God back to life.  N'Bushe Wright
serves as requisite perfect-ten love interest,
although Snipes is too cool to make a play for her.</P>
<P>Those eager to accept "Blade" on its own terms will
enjoy the movie.  There is endless violence, lots
of showing off, and the usual humorless action hero
versus psychotic bad guy plot, with Life As We Know
It at stake.  Much of the budget goes for special
effects.  You've seen this movie before, and if
you enjoyed it then, you'll like it again.  If you
are interested in seeing a superior version,
try "Virtuosity" from 1995.</P>
<P>Perhaps the problem with "Blade" lies with the
two main characters.  Solemn Snipes is one tough
dude, but his personality is limited.  Therefore,
the bad guys (in this case, vampires) must be colorful
(i.e. eccentric) to retain interest.  This is,
after all, a comic book.  While Dorff is an evil
megalomaniac, he needs to be more over-the-top, like
James Carrey from "Batman Forever", and be given more
screen time.  What "Blade" (and perhaps Snipes)
doesn't realize is that the bad guys should be the
real stars of the film.</P>
