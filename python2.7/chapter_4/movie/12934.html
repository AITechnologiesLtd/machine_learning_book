<PRE>Truman Show, The [1998]
Directed by: Peter Weir
Featuring: Jim Carrey, Laura Linney, Ed Harris
Written by: Andrew Niccol</PRE>
<P>Movies are controlled by their premise, which is what makes The Truman
Show such an amazing piece of celluloid.</P>
<P>Brief explanation.  I recently wrote a bit on Godzilla which loved it
for being bad, because it's a movie reprising really bad (although
ultra-fun) movies.  The old Godzilla movies were essentially just large
pieces of latex shambling through bad plot intersected with dialog. 
Independence Day, by the same people and almost the same concept, wasn't
a good movie because it didn't have that license to ill.  If Godzilla
had a wonderful plot and great acting, I probably would have hated it.</P>
<P>The Truman Show's premise gives it a huge task: create a show within a
movie in which the producer/director
is essentially God.  That places it essentially on the other end of the
spectrum from Godzilla.</P>
<P>This Harrison Begeron meets The Real World is a difficult setup because
the audience is supposed to be analyzing everything, watching Truman's
microcosm from the same lens as the Truman's television audience. 
What's good for the microcosm, is good for the film.  Because of this,
the reverse is true as well, the viewer is analyzing the entire film in
the same light.</P>
<P>Even with that scrutiny, The Truman Show is still excellent.  My first
concern was Jim Carrey.  As someone who has made a career as an
over actor, it's hard to see him carrying a dramatic role.  Particularly
one in movie where the entire plot and action is almost literally
revolving around him with every hidden camera. For the most part, Carrey
does a fine job.  He occasionally drifts off into manic fits, about half
of which seem to fit into the role and the rest just seem weird.</P>
<P>The chief problem isn't Carrey, but the slow rising of the curtain of
his stageworld.  The Truman Show has been airing nonstop for Truman's
entire life, without his knowledge that it is indeed a show.  Yet, in a
matter of two days, enough clues get dropped and enough actors slip in
their roles that he questions his existence.  What the movie lack is
history.  Truman's denial of his stageworld should logically have
spanned months, if not years, instead of weeks.  Only a couple of
episodes from his life really have an impact on the plot, which seems
implausible for movie begging to have an epic history.</P>
<P>With that exception, though, the movie carries through with the premise
with intelligence. Everything from the extras in television show to the
audience watching it around the globe make an environment which draws
the viewer in to ask the question "How will it end?"</P>
<P>Overall:
Carrey's acting is good, but not brilliant.  Fortunately, it doesn't
have to be, because the movie is brilliant.  Hug your favorite Truman
pillow and go see this one.</P>
