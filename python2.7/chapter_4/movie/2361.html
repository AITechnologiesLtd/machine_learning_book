<PRE>                             WAYNE'S WORLD 2
                      A film review by Ken Johnson
                       Copyright 1994 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>1:31, Comedy, 1993
MPAA rating: PG-13 (explicit language, adult situations, adult    
                   humor)
Rating: four (on a scale of zero to five)
Director: Stephen Surjik
Cast: Mike Myers, Dana Carvey, Christopher Walken, Tia Carrere,   
      Ralph Brown, Kim Basinger, Chris Farley, Aerosmith,
      Drew Barrymore, Ed O'Neill, Charlton Heston</P>
<P>     Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers) and Garth Algar (Dana Carvey) have
moved out and are on their own.  Wayne is visited in a dream by Jim
Morrison, who tells Wayne to have a concert, the modern version of
Woodstock.  Wayne and Garth go through many problems to try and make
the concert happen.  Also, Christopher Walken is trying to break up
Wayne and his girlfriend Cassandra (Tia Carrere).</P>
<P>     The problem with most sequels of great movies is that the sequel
stinks, take CADDYSHACK and CADDYSHACK 2 for instance.  Luckily WAYNE'S
WORLD 2 doesn't fall into that problem.  WAYNE'S WORLD 2 keeps the
charm of the original, without being a carbon copy of the original.  It
is great to see Wayne and Garth back in action and in great form.</P>
<P>     Some of the cameos in this film are great.  Especially Charlton
Heston and Drew Barrymore.  They keep the general idea of the film
moving.  Other cameos, like Ed O'Neill's, are disappointing, but they
are few.</P>
<P>     WAYNE'S WORLD 2 has a kick-ass soundtrack, that includes
Aerosmith, Gin Blossoms, and Bad Company that keeps the mood of the
film going throughout.  WAYNE'S WORLD 2 is well-written, and those that
enjoyed the first will probably enjoy number two.  Also, as a word of
advise, stay through the end credits.  Like the first film, this film
has a cute segment in the end credits.</P>
