<PRE>                             SLEEPY HOLLOW
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     I'll be the first to admit I don't really remember the details of
Washington Irving's `The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.'  But what I do
remember, well, it didn't go like this.</P>
<P>     In typical Tim Burton fashion, a fairy tale gets an update (and the
film's color gets drained out in the process).  The guts of `Legend' are
still there: In 1799, evil headless horseman marauds a tiny village in
upstate New York.  Ichabod Crane (Depp) is sent to investigate.</P>
<P>     Of course, something wicked this way comes, and a plot is uncovered
-- the details of which I'm still trying to get right in my head -- but
which involve just about every inbred member of this little town, most
of whom are beheaded during the picture.</P>
<P>     Depp nearly reprises his role as EDWARD SCISSORHANDS as a quiet
wallflower (sans scissors), and whiter-than-white Christina Ricci (as
the magic-obsessed love interest) sticks out among the drab fogies in
their powdered wigs like Bill Gates at the Playboy Mansion.  The
supporting cast is uniformly bland, just like the scenery (though the
latter is intentional).  The sole exception is Walken, who plays the
horseman (when he has his head, at least) with typical aplomb.</P>
<P>     So what's the sum of the parts?  What should have been a Halloween
treat is instead a late-November humdrum flick worthy of a glance but
little more.  The story is obtuse yet unsurprising.  The humor is sparse
and occasionally funny.  And while Burton's signature is all over the
film, his typical wit is not.</P>
<P>     How will the film fare at the box office?  I can't rightly say, but
I do know that a legion of junior high students is going to be
disappointed, missing a whole lot of questions on their English Lit
exams because of this movie.</P>
