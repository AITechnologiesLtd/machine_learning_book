<P>Having been saturated for a year with the same "Coming next summer to a
theatre near you" clips of Bond parachuting onto the yacht of a gorgeous,
bored brunette, I knew that when the full movie did come to a theatre near
me, I would groan with the sense of deja suffered. Which I did, but then
something strange happened. By the end of the first thirty minutes of "The
Living Daylights," when beautiful but insipid Maryam d'Abo turned out to be
Bond's main femme focus, I missed the yachtwoman. By the end of the film, I
had decided that the sunning beauty had been one of the picture's main
assets.</P>
<P>"The Living Daylights" plays cutesy games with in-joke, allusive names:
Russian General  Leonid (after Brezhnev) Pushkin; General Anatol (after
Dobrynin) Gogol ; a professional killer called Necros ("Dead" in Greek);
Rosika Miklos (after movie music composer Miklos Rozsa?); Kamran Shah
(Vietnam transposed to Afghanistan ?);  Colonel Feyador (after filmmaker
Feyder, Fyodor Dostoievski, or what?) ; and more. Three female characters
are called Linda, Liz, and Ava. My best guess is that the one on the deck
may be Ava, whose improbable "real" name is Dulice Liecier.</P>
<P>The movie  did keep my interest at first, then steadily began to slide down
and away. It did not bore the living daylights out of me,nor did it live up
to expectations. Still, the initial interest is sustained by curiosity: how
will the new James Bond, Timothy Dalton, stack  up against his
predecessors? Sean Connery played Bond seven times (1962-1983); George
Lazenby, once (1969); Roger Moore seven (1973-1985).</P>
<P>Dalton does nicely, in a different way. Asuming that you want to socialize
with actors (not always a wise decision), Connery might be a warm, natural,
un-self-important, conciliatory companion. With his healthy,tongue-in-cheek
humor, he'd make a pleasant traveling companion. Moore would be a good
person to trade quips with during one of those marathon French meals where
taking oneself un-seriously, even using steady self-mockery, raise
superficiality to the level of an art form.</P>
<P>Dalton promises much as a relatively sober, even serious Bond, who
underplays his part and makes minimal concessions to smart-alecky, snobbish
remarks about  drinks, food, special needs or female  flesh. Where the
other Bonds reacted to everything with a wink or a witticism, Dalton seems
to pause regularly for a split second and look as though he were
considering the gravity and the implications of the new moment. Perhaps
this comes from his stage experience (it includes  Shakespeare).</P>
<P>His Bond is more work than play. Dalton's age is coyly skipped in all the
studio releases, but extrapolating from his biography I'd say that the man
is about 40. He is more physically fit than Connery or Moore in their later
Bond impersonations. Connery went  (ages approximate within one year) from
age 32 ("Dr. No") to 53 ("Never Say Never Again") doing James Bond. Moore,
from 46 to 58. Lazenby was only 30 when "On His Majesty's Secret Service"
came out, and certainly seemed fit. But the film was not a hit, unfairly,
in my opinion.</P>
<P>Dalton is handsome,but so were the other Bonds.Compared to aging,
post-1970s Bonds, his youthful looks contribute a more credible match
between heroes and physical exploits. But this is conventional thinking.
For many viewers, a younger Bond is an asset, but then, was there not a
special kind of satisfaction in seeing Connery and Moore, past their prime,
defeating in wiles and action hordes of younger enemies, while their mature
sex-appeal attracted, on the screen, so many younger women?</P>
<P>Even if we feel that Timothy Dalton, as a more businesslike, younger, and
more thoughtful Bond, rejuvenates and freshens up the series, the movie's
structure itself shows signs of age and fatigue. It  follows the basic Bond
structure: a top, action-filled pre-credit sequence on the rock of
Gibraltar,with spectacular stunts and special effects--an introduction
that's only semi-relevant to the main film, with  a message "Smiert
spionom" (Death to Spies) that doesn't connect too coherently to what
follows. Then come the  blue-chip credits by the constant Bond title-maker,
Maurice Binder. And at last the action proper gets going.</P>
<P>It ranges across many locations: Gibraltar, Morocco (played by Morocco),
Afghanistan (played by Morocco), Vienna (played by Vienna), Bratislava in
Czechoslovakia (played by Vienna), Czechoslovakia (played by Austria), and
England (played partly by the Pinewood studios).</P>
<P>The multiheaded plot sprouts subplots, like the Lernean Hydra where each of
the nine heads that was cut off was replaced by two more. It involves
spies, counter-spies, triple-crosses, scams, KGB defectors, arms dealers,
drug merchants, unholy alliances, mixed loyalties, M (Bond's "control),
phoney killings, Bond gagdetry by old Q, a new Miss Moneypenny plus many
Bondian trappings. Most of this is imaginative. Early on  it is quite
entertaining, but past the half-way mark, the mechanical succession of
chases, stunts, gimmickry and sub-sub-plots become indifferent and
confusing.</P>
<P>The twisty screen action and inventiveness pile up so much and so fast that
whatever conducting thread there is almost impossible to follow. An excess
of everything leads to audience stupor, with a resulting numbing and
dumbing of the public. Even within a context of fantasy, there is
incoherence in details. When, at the start, Bond attends a Bratislava
symphony concert, his tuxedo, in a socialist country like Czechoslovakia,
is as unlikely (and attention-getting) as a bikini would be in the House of
Commons. Later, in Afghanistan, the regal tent-house of the mujaheddin is
strictly out of the films of The 1001 Nights and other oriental dreams of
old Hollywood. Some of this may be camp or humor, but then it does not go
far enough.</P>
<P>The story itself at first seems to hesitate between a bona fide --even
serious -- international spy thriller and a typical Bond affair. This
vacillation is not unpleasant to observe as it  hints that the makers will
add to the film some of the weight lacking in recent Bonds. Yet, that's not
how things work out.</P>
<P>The movie eventually goes off in all sorts of flamboyant, arbitrary,
for-your-eyes-only directions. The lack of concentration is abetted by the
absence of central supervillain out to destroy the world if it doesn't
yield to his blackmail. Villainy here is not massive, but  rather like a
plot subdivision, centerless, with no unifying structure, true development,
growth or resolution. It is one long succession of dispersed--albeit well
handled and skilfully shot--special situations, with mini-climax following
micro-climax. It's like a mountain range of peaks where there's no single
height towers above the others and is the climber's ultimate conquest.</P>
<P>John Glen directed the last three Bond-Roger Moore pictures. He has an
overwhelmingly  "in-house" past, as editor, second-unit or action-scenes
director of earlier Bond flicks. His skill for individual  special effects
sequences, is dazzling. His ability for an overall conception of his films,
of structure and synthesis is not .To a well-plotted action film  "The
Living Daylights" is what a good stand-up comic's routine is to a classic,
sophisticated comedy or farce.</P>
<P>The movie floods you with a string of happenings, the way a compulsive
talker overwhelms you by talking as rapidly and loudly as possible. You
lose the point--if any--of the story, you miss the punchline, you get no
clear image of the characters, no feeling for the director as an "auteur,"
no feeling for the screen creatures as anything more than puppets.</P>
<P>"The Living Daylights" has been ballyhooed as the first Bond where the hero
sticks to  just one lady, whether in response to the New Continence (AIDS,
Neo-Conservatism) or for the sake of a new, more bonded Bond. This is not
precisely true, as there's  also the early,  charming presence of the
aforementioned yacht lady--but let that pass, since it is  is overall
obvious that Dalton's James is a great deal more Don Quixote than Don
Juan,with most of the typical Bond sneers, leers and horizontal innuendoes
gone.</P>
<P>Bully for Dalton, were it not for the choice of his paramour. Kara Milova
(Maryam d'Abo) plays a Czech cellist in a symphony orchestra. For obscure
reasons she has to double as a sharpooter. She is a clone of Nastassia
Kinski at her inexpressivest, cloyingest, and pallidest. If the new Bondian
monogamy is supposed to strike a blow for feminism too, Kara is not the
right spokeswoman: she merely plays fifth fiddle to James, and in her
passivity (during a fight she dumbly stands there for aeons before using a
frying pan on a villain) she reinforces the machoism of Bondism. There was
more feminism, for example, in  a sex-laden opus like "Never Say Never
Again" (Connery's last Bond of 1983), where gorgeous, evil ,
snake-throwing, explosive Barbara Carrera had an assertive,
initiative-taking presence that gave Connery a run for his gray cells and
his hormones.</P>
<P>With its lack of character development and overall structure "TLD" is less
than the sum of its parts, but it can still be fairly entertaining if you
don't expect a Bondian revolution. Some of the supporting roles are good,
notably the Dutchman Jeroen Krabbe's (he was recently the heavy in "No
Mercy") who, as the KGB defector, keeps playing roles within roles. Very
good too is the German Andreas Wisniewski (unknown to us, unless you've
seen "Gothic") as the Walkman strangler.  Both men wear their hair flat, a
sure clue that helps you spot movie villains these days.The more familiar
John Rhys-Davies (as General Pushkin) does little that stands out, but Joe
Don Baker, the corrupt yet infantile arms-and-drugs dealer, hams things up
with unbridled bliss and is like a caricature of Jonathan Winters playing a
demented General George S. Patton.</P>
