<P>   If your best friend is engaged and you think that marriage
is not right for him, there's no better gift you can give than
"Bartlett's Familiar Quotations."  This bible of famous sayings
is packed with extracts from the great literature about
matrimony, and to no one's surprise the better part of the
excerpts is against the institution.  In "Don Quixote"
Cervantes warns us that "marriage is a noose," while the 16th
century essayist, John Selden, counsels that "marriage is a
desperate thing."  Perhaps these celebrated writers from
centuries past know whereof they speak: fully fifty percent of
all marriages entered into by Americans end in divorce, and
who knows how many others are marred by separation,
uncivil warfare, and general misery?  "Forces of Nature," a
romantic comedy that frequently alerts us to the perils of
matrimony but later subverts this discouraging idea, enjoys 
dependable performances by a reliable cast and some
efficient editing that lends extra humor to many of its scenes,
but the best thing about the film is Marc Lawrence's
screenplay.  Loaded with one-liners that range from outright
chortles to agreeable chuckles, his script is generally on the
level of a first-rate sitcom (think "Cheers"), making the movie
a amiable way to spend some time in the company of people
who have loved and lost, who have yet to do either, and even
some who have retained their affection throughout decades of
joyful togetherness.</P>
<P>   The story opens on a bachelor party, purportedly the last
night of singles freedom for Ben (Ben Affleck), whose gala
blast is hosted by his best friend, Alan (Steve Zahn) and
given spice by a seductive stripper bedecked in balloons
begging to be burst.  Ben, armed with non-refundable tickets
for his anticipated honeymoon in Hawaii, boards a flight to
Savannah, Georgia, where he is to be wed to the wealthy
and charming Bridget (Maura Tierney), but when his aircraft
veers off the runaway, Ben heads back to the terminal with a
fellow passenger, Sarah (Sandra Bullock).  As Ben is a
conventional sort, he is taken under the wing by this
attractive and eccentric woman who is fun-loving where Ben
is prosaic, though we later discover that this bundle of joie de
vivre has a melancholy side.  After a series of adventures
together spanning two days, Ben must decide whether to
chuck his bride-to-be in favor of this new force of nature, to
forget about marriage as an institution for the time being, or
to go through with his plans to wed his Georgian debutante.</P>
<P>   At once a road movie and a buddy film, "Forces of Nature"
takes us through one episode after another, each adding to
Ben's exploration of romance.  Marc Lawrence is nothing if
not canny with one-liners about the nature of marriage.  Early
on, Ben's granddad--who suffers a heart attack during the
young man's bachelor party--confesses that "marriage is a
prison," while a male passenger on the flight from New York
to Savannah whines about the thirty pounds his wife put on
"since we stopped having sex" and bewails the lies he must
tell his spouse, such as how she looks so much better than
the eighteen-year-old knockout who delivers his paper.  When
Ben meets a loving elderly couple on a train ride he shares
with Sarah, his feelings about marriage become more
optimistic--until the duo inform him that "we're not married--
we're having an affair," and the matronly lady describes how
until she met this man she had never had an orgasm.</P>
<P>   Sitcom that this picture may be, it never fails to entertain
thanks to the fortuitous pairing of Ben Affleck, a master at
appearing goofy, and Sandra Bullock, a powerhouse of
womanly stamina.  The chemistry between these opposites is
potent, splitting the audience into two groups: those who want
Ben to chuck his long-term sweetheart and take up with this
fun-loving person, and those who feel he'd be more grounded
with the stable person to whom he has declared his love. 
Supporting actors add zest to the story, particularly Joe
(Richard Schiff), a tour guide in a bus to Miami.  We wonder
until the final minutes whether Ben will follow the advice he
comes across in a quote by Oscar Wilde: "One should always
be in love--that's why one should never marry."  Director
Bronwen Hughes, whose innocuous "Harriet the Spy" might
have ended her career, has come back with a pleasurable, if
TV-level comedy, about two forces of nature--the storm which
delays Ben's march to Georgia, and the power of love to
conquer all.</P>
