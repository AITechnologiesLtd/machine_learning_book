<PRE>A Simple Plan</PRE>
<P>Sam Raimi has directed a harsh, depressing thriller here. Like
all good thrillers, A Simple Plan has a strong caution for us
all: Be careful about wishing for too much money, because you
might actually  get it and then you have to try to keep it.</P>
<P>Hank Mitchell works in a feed mill in a small Minnesota town. His
wife, Sarah, is pregnant. His brother Jake is sort of slow but is
a good, loyal sibling whoπs been denied a lot in his life. Jake
is best friends with Lou, the loutish town drunk who isnπt nearly
as funny as he thinks he is. On New Yearsπ Eve  the three of them
visit the Mitchellπs parentπs gravesite and by dumb luck (a fox
runs in front of their truck, causing an accident), they discover
a crashed airplane with a corpse and 4.5 million dollars in cash.
They think briefly about turning it in to the cops but they
quickly decide to keep it, as long as Hank holds the money. If no
one comes looking for it by the spring, theyåll all split the
money and leave town. In the meantime, they promise to keep quiet
about everything. This is the simple plan, the first of many.
Everything is so simple--at any given moment, they are just this
far from having the plan work.</P>
<P>Nothing works, of course. This first plan unravels almost
immediately. These arenπt the brightest characters ever to grace
the silver screen. By that I donπt mean that this is an idiot
plot that relies on everyone acting very stupid. Rather, these
people are by turns cunning and blind to the flaws in their plans
in ways that are agonizingly realistic. You know that any three
men who found four and a half million dollars would really act
this way. You also know that their plans will unravel, in this
way or some other way, leaving behind a great deal of misery.</P>
<P>Hank always thinks of a new plan, or else Sarah thinks of a plan
for him. Every new plan has a problem, and every problem ends up
with someone getting killed. The movie moves, slowly and
painfully, to what seems like an inevitable conclusion, when
suddenly the plot twists and twists again. You know all along the
broad outlines of  the ending. What actually happens, though, 
heats up the plot more than you would think possible while also
revealing unsuspected depths in the main characters.</P>
<P>A Simple Plan is filmed in winter weather so dreary it almost
seems like a black and white movie. While Bill Paxton as Hank is
a little flat as a reluctant schemer, Billy Bob Thornton nails
Jakeπs village idiot role to the wall, and Bridget Fonda is
astounding as a small town Lady MacBeth. The plot is tightly
woven for the most part, though certain key elements seem to rely
on shoddy police work (one professionally conducted autopsy
should bring the whole Simple Plan to a screeching halt, for
example). Overall, though, A Simple Plan is well-made, intense
and harrowing in the extreme.</P>
