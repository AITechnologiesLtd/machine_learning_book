<PRE>JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK
A film review by Max Messier
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>It's time to say "goodbye," according to Kevin Smith, to his token
recurring characters -- the C3PO and R2-D2 of the local Quick Stop --
Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith).  Since their inception
as two stoner losers hanging out in front of the local Quick Stop
"smokin' blunts and kickin' asses" in Clerks, Jay and Silent Bob have
received ever expanding roles in Smith's later features -- Mallrats,
Chasing Amy, and Dogma.  But when these two guys showed up in a cameo in
Scream 3, that was the moment when they "jumped the shark" (AKA lost
their unique appeal and devolved into would-be Happy Meal figurines).  I
wouldn't be surprised if two 10-foot tall character replicants greeted
all guests at Miramax's HQ.</P>
<P>If you looking for a plot in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, don't
bother.  Smith uses the safe convention of repetition by including
certain key locations of his first three films and all of their main
characters -- minus Dogma.  By doing this, Smith creates a familiar
universe for Jay and Silent Bob to venture through and trick the
audience into remembering their old favorites and ignore the throwaway
script.</P>
<P>The story goes something like this.  Due to the success of a comic book
series called Bluntman and Chronic, which used Jay and Silent Bob for
character inspiration, the boys are living life well on royalty checks
and hanging out at the same local Quick Stop from Clerks.  Upon hearing
that Bluntman and Chronic has been sold to Miramax and the boys have
received no compensation, they head to Hollywood to stop the
production.  Along the way, four hot chicks pick them up -- girls
straight off the covers of Maxim and Stuff, actually jewel thieves in
need of two patsies for their next job.  Jay and Silent Bob are framed
for the robbery of an orangutan and are then hunted by Federal Wildlife
Marshal Wilenholly (Will Ferrell) as they travel the back roads to
Hollywood to clear their names.</P>
<P>At first Strike Back is pleasant enough thanks to all the nostalgia. 
But the happiness wears off quickly as it becomes all too apparent that
Smith has fallen for the same grab bag of pop culture that teen comedy
producers eat with a spoon.  Scooby Doo, Charlie's Angels, and numerous
references to the Star Wars films - including a blatant cameo by Mark
Hamill and, well, the title -- all make lame appearances.  Endless
tongue-in-cheek references to Miramax's totalitarian control of
"independent" cinema come off as empty and contrived, as if Miramax
suits thought they could mock themselves while raking in the cash.  (It
didn't work for Josie and the Pussycats either, fellas.)</P>
<P>Tons of people (literally, at least 4,000 pounds worth of celebrities)
show up in this film -- including John Stewart, Matt Damon, James Van
Der Beek, Joey Lauren Adams, Judd Nelson, Gus Van Sant, Shannen Doherty,
Wes Craven, Jason Biggs, Ali Larter, George Carlin, and Chris Rock to
name but a few.  Ironically, they are playing themselves in a film that
unilaterally mocks them.  The self-loathing impresses, and if that was
Smith's intention for the film, then it's admirable.</P>
<P>Alas, any such sentiment is drowned in a sea of dick jokes, fart jokes,
and references to the 1980s.</P>
