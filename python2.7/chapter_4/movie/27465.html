<PRE>                             THE TERRORIST (MALLI)
                        A film review by Jeremiah Kipp
                         Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com

<P>Any interest for this beautifully photographed Indian film will surely
be generated by the screen credit, "John Malkovich Presents."  While he
had little to do with the financing or actual production, he discovered
The Terrorist during an international film festival and was so terribly
moved that he pushed for a distribution deal with the minor league
company Phaedra Cinema.</P>
<P>Malli (played by expressive newcomer Ayesha Dharkar) is a nineteen-year
old rebel girl whose only home has been a guerilla camp nestled deep in
the forests of an unnamed country.  She has been asked to perform a
crucial assassination that requires her to strap on a bomb and, when the
moment arrives, blow up herself and her enemy.  Sounds like a lean, mean
novella in the Ernest Hemingway mold.</P>
<P>Patient viewers who respond to the visual poetry of Robert Bresson or
Terrence Malick will find much to appreciate here.  Of course, as soon
as a review mentions the notion of visual poetry, some folks may start
running for the hills.  Indeed, this is understandable.  The Terrorist
is slow, meditative, and more than slightly pretentious.</P>
<P>There's not much in the way of dialogue or exposition.  Much of the
time, the camera simply follows Manni as she wanders through rivers and
hills, teardrops and rain.  The natural light sources create a strange
pastiche of aqua colored landscapes.  Often, shots will linger on
close-ups of Dharkar, whose eyes burn with charisma.  If that sounds
boring to you, give this movie a wide berth.</P>
<P>Early scenes are taut with violence as Manni casually blows away a
prisoner-of-war, then undergoes a grueling interrogation as her
superiors wade through five teenage girls seeking the right candidate
for the job.  While director/cinematographer Santosh Sivan wields his
camera with austere grace, these early scenes set up what amounts to a
fairly generic story -- Bresson's interpretation of Mad Magazine's Spy
Vs. Spy.</P>
<P>Bottom line: it's difficult not to get utterly bored, no matter how much
of an art house cinephile you aspire to be.  If the thought of Manni
tromping through minefields with a battle-scarred little boy (Vishwas)
sounds exciting, be forewarned that you're faced with endless shots of
them walking, thinking, or staring off into nothingness.  This
particular subplot ends on a hollow, predictable note right after Manni
says goodbye to this friend.  If you've seen any films set in a war-torn
country, it won't shock you.</P>
<P>There's a token love story, just as there is the inevitable guilt over
her mission.  If more attention had been paid to illuminating her inner
thoughts or struggle, perhaps The Terrorist would amount to more than
several reels of affecting pictures.  We are presented with a motion
picture with themes that would have been better articulated in the
medium of a slide show or book.</P>
<P>If you're not into the whole art house thing, you may get some enjoyment
out of putting on your Cultural Anthropologist cap and using The
Terrorist as a point of entry into the portal of John Malkovich.  To
those with the desire to experience this elusive actor's taste in
cinema, I offer this tiny hint: it's only a rental away.</P>
