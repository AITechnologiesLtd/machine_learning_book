<P>Another comedy pic starring the ever-loving, dumbass character that Adam
Sandler's been portraying ever since he ended his days as a regular cast
member of TV's "Saturday Night Live".</P>
<P>PLOT:
An ignorant football waterboy from the Bayou suddenly discovers a unique
talent for crunch-tackling the opposition, and against the orders of his
overly-protective mother, joins the worst team in the league.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Uninspired, one-joke film gathers very little in momentum, is forgiven for
its obviously standard plot, but not for its lack of constant humor or
originality. This Cajun movie can't even hold a candle next to Sandler's
best comedy up to date, HAPPY GILMORE (8/10). That movie was filled with
jokes left and right, enjoyable characters all around, and many fresh ideas.
Sandler is okay in this one, and does receive a wonderful supporting
performance from Kathy Bates, in a role that seems to have been inspired by
Elvis and his momma, but overall, this flick offers very few chuckles, many
repeat gags, and Henry Winkler. I love "stupid comedies" as much as the next
guy, but this Bourbon-bred story just doesn't have enough mustard to
complete the sandwich. Mind you, if you're really in the mood for some fun,
not-to-be-taken-seriously humor, check out the aforementioned HAPPY GILMORE,
Woody Allen's classic BANANAS (8/10) or the Farrelly brothers' overlooked
KINGPIN (8.5/10). Unfortunately for Sandler and crew, there is very little
in comedic "whoop-ass" in this dud.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
This film grossed close to $160 million domestically, and is famous for
turning actor Adam Sandler into the $20-million-salary-man.
Look for Rob Schneider in an uncredited role as the "townie" who keeps
shouting "You could do it!".
The late comedian Chris Farley's two brothers both have roles in this film.
John Farley plays the character of Tony Dodd, while Kevin Farley plays Jim
Simonds.
Many actual football personalities make appearances in this film as
themselves, including Lawrence Taylor, Lynn Swann, Jimmy Johnson, Dan Fouts,
Chris Fowler and Brent Musburger.
The director of this film, Frank Coraci, also directed the Adam
Sandler-vehicle, THE WEDDING SINGER (7/10). He also plays the role of Adam's
crazy dad Roberto in this picture.
Writer Tim Herlihy, producer on TV's "Saturday Night Live", has co-written
four of Adam Sandler's films with Adam himself. They consist of this one,
HAPPY GILMORE, BILLY MADISON, and the upcoming BIG DADDY. He was the only
one credited for writing THE WEDDING SINGER. He is also a member of the New
York State Bar.
The writer, Tim Herlihy, director, Frank Coraci, and producer, Jack
Giarraputo, of this film were all roommates with Adam during his days at New
York University.</P>
