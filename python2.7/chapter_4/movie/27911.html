<P>     Major motion picture studios may be dumb, but they're not stupid.  
When you get a movie starring a couple of golden kids like Julia Roberts 
and Brad Pitt opening on March 2nd, chances are there were a few 
bomb-sniffing dogs on the prowl somewhere up in the Perrier-stocked 
suites of the front office. </P>
<P>     Do Julia and Brad have chemistry?  It's hard to tell.  For most of 
this two-hours-but-feels-longer movie, they're in different countries.  
She's heading for Las Vegas, where she hopes to get a job as a waitress 
with an option to move up to casino dealer.  He's in Mexico trying to 
get possession of a gold-plated antique gun (the eponymous "Mexican") 
for his mob bosses.  Instead, she gets kidnapped by hitman James (The 
Sopranos) Gandolfini (does anybody ever consider casting Gandolfini as 
an ambassador or an art dealer?), who's been sent by mob types to make 
sure Brad delivers the gun.  Brad, meanwhile, is having problems of his 
own south of the border with corpses and dogs and larcenous types.  We 
see them together at the very beginning, when she throws his clothes out 
of the window (and couldn't we have lived without ever seeing that 
cliche again), and at the end, with a few telephone tirades strung 
into the middle. </P>
<P>     There is some rewarding chemistry, but it comes from the 
Roberts-Gandolfini tandem, which may explain why Julia and Brad get so 
little face time.  She experiences a bit of Stockholm Syndrome, becoming 
emotionally involved with her captor.  Not romantically - A) because he 
resembles Yogi Berra, and B) because he's gay.  Instead, he gets to be 
the Gay Friend, and in some of the movie's best scenes, they perform 
couple counseling on each other.  In a moment of questionable taste, she 
admits she was initially offended when she asked if he was going to rape 
her and he said "Not very likely," but feels much better when she finds 
out his sexual orientation.</P>
<P>     It's a comedy-adventure.  You know it's comedy because of the 
clothes-defenestration scene - that happens seldom in real life and 
never in drama - and from Brad saying lines like : "When you told me to 
pick up the thing at the thing, well, Samantha, she wanted the car to 
pick up some things."  Periodically it forgets that it's 
comedy-adventure, and then people get killed in messy and unamusing 
ways.</P>
<P>     "The Mexican", the gun for possession of which the denizens of this 
movie (and we) go through so much, turns out to be cursed.  Unless it's 
in the right hands, it backfires. </P>
<P>     There's a cheap quip there, but I wouldn't touch it for a free 
weekend in Cab San Lucas.</P>
