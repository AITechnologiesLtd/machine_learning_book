<PRE>                            SPICE WORLD 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                     1 :-) :-)  for pure moronic fun</PRE>
<P>Cast Melanie Brown, Emma Bunton, Melanie Chisholm, Geri Haliwell,
Victoria Addams, Richard E. Grant, Alan Cumming, Roger Moore. Written by
Jamie Curtis, Kim Fuller. Directed by Bob Spiers</P>
<P>Let's begin by saying that I am not a fan of the SPICE GIRLS. I don't
know their names, and after watching this movie I still don't know their
names. However, for the sake of posterity, there's the blonde one who
likes fluffy toys, the red haired one with big boobs, the dark skinned
one fixated with hair, the dark haired one fixated with clothes and the
other dark haired one who does somersaults ...... and they can all sing
even if they can't act. Strangely this tact works because the girls are
being themselves and they want us to laugh at them, if not with them.</P>
<P>So I laughed at them and for all the wrong reasons. This screwy, corn
ball, wacky, silly movie is very pretentious and very them. The most
annoying part of the SPICE experience was waiting in line with two
hundred screaming adolescents, shoving and pushing their way into the
cinema. Embarrassingly, I laughed at all the silly jokes and they
didn't, but surprisingly I actually enjoyed myself. Maybe I'm just a
sucker for tacky British humour, but if I could rename the movie it
would be CARRY ON SPICE.</P>
<P>So who are the SPICE GIRLS? If you've seen the series SEVEN UP, they are
reminiscent of the three working class girls who end up pregnant,
divorced and obese 21 years later. I'm not in any way implying that this
will befall SPICE, but my theory is - in their twenties they look like
Marilyn, when they're forty they'll look like Roseanne. Imagine a cow
trying to chew grass and recite lines at the same time, well that's how
SPICE GIRLS speak.</P>
<P>The cameo appearances made by who's who of British song and screen is
one of this movie's highlights. To think they showed support and rallied
to the aid of the girls continues to baffle me. But if money can buy
loyalty, then the girls have plenty of that. The other main roles worth
mentioning are Roger Moore who gets to play with animals, and a
hysterical Richard E. Grant who manages the girls. Add to this some
London sight seeing, a SPICE BUS, an evil media baron, scenes copied
from SPEED, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, GREASE, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS; throw in
themes about motherhood, pregnancy, friendship and loyalty and you have
the volatile cocktail that is SPICE WORLD – you'll either hate it or
love it.</P>
