<P>   One of the ironies of fame is that you spend your life trying
to achieve it and then, once you've got it, you have to wear
shades in the street for fear of being mobbed.  Your privacy is
gone.  Katja von Garnier's film "Bandits" underscores the
paradox.  Four women, losers all, spend their spare time
dreaming of fame but gain it at the oddest time.  Just as they
succeed in pulling a daring escape from jail, their pictures are
plastered all over town and on compact discs in all the music
stores.  At the very moment they need anonymity, to blend in
with the crowd and avoid capture, they become the best
known women in the city of Hamburg. Their fifteen minutes of
fame could easily turn into several additional years of prison
once caught by the polizei.</P>
<P>   The title bandits of the picture are four women who are
serving time for a variety of offenses.  Prettiest is Angel
(Nicolette Krebitz), a 23-year-old robber who develops a crush
on a strikingly handsome young man during her days on the
lam.  Luna (Jasmin Tabatabai) is the most volatile, a short-
fuse dynamo who is the lead singer of the group.  Emma
(Katja Reimann) is the most alienated, a red-head whose
rimless glasses add to her severity, while the oldest of the
group, Marie (Jtta Hoffmann), is a suicidal convict who
arsenic-poisoned her husband and who falls under the
protection of the women who love her.</P>
<P>   The narrative gets under way when a nun who serves as
the jailhouse counselor recommends the girls to play a gig at
a policeman's ball.  (The women pick the name bandits as a
combination of the words "band" and "tits.") On the way to the
event, the women escape from the van and are pursued by
an obsessed cop, Schwarz, a Javert-like character who insists
that he has always captured runaways before he can finish
his box of cigarillos.  When the newly freed women send a
tape of their music to a greedy distributor, they gain instant
fame, their CDs on sale everywhere.  With the mere 50,000
marks which the profiteer hands them, they await a boat
which will take them to a life of freedom in sunny Guyana.</P>
<P>   The plot is banal enough, serving as mere excuse for a
throbbing soundtrack featuring the women in actual
performances of their songs.  As the four continue to elude
the police, they become fast friends, one of them enjoying a
brief affair with a handsome American tourist (Werner
Schreyer) who goes along with them reluctantly as a hostage. 
The final scene is both imaginative and appallingly drawn-out,
a choppily edited MTV extravaganza in which the band,
eschewing a quick getaway to the steamship, first delivers a
rollicking impromptu concert by the waterfront to a crowd of
cheering young men and women, all of whom wish the best
for them and seek to block their capture by the police.  </P>
<P>   Essentially the whole work is an elongated piece of music
TV which can try the patience of the adults, though the
women are good to look at as they strum their guitars and
smash their drums.  This is a minor work by a director who
was responsible for the documentary on the making of Clint
Eastwood's "In the Line of Fire" and the surprise German
success, "Making Up!" in 1992.  Not Rated.  Running time:
109 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten 1998</P>
