<PRE>The Truman Show</PRE>
<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>There's one thing that Peter Weir (the director) does with The Truman Show
that makes it utterly brilliant, and it's something so subtle that you have
to think to notice it. The entire time you're viewing Truman, you're not
watching a movie, you're watching a show. The Truman Show, in fact. From its
opening frame, where Big Brother-esque creator Christof is explaining his
concept of The Truman Show, you are being drawn not into a film but into a
television story. In fact, as it remains strictly within the dome in which
Truman lives for the first half of the film, you are watching him not in the
conventional shot of a box shape, but instead in the shape of a human eye.
In the paranoid world of Truman, you are watching.</P>
<P>The Truman Show, in truth, has no truth. It's a movie about the farce of
small town reality, and when you go there, you get weird. In so many ways
this movie mirrors the darker, more industrial and film noir Best Picture
nominated "Blue Velvet" (1986), the David Lynch film in which a man walks
through a field, begins throwing stones at a small shack, and picks up a
human ear. The bittersweet small town satire in this film is coolly and
calmly apparent.
It's not a fast film. It's not a funny film. What it is is a film about
humanity, about human reactions, and about how strange our realities can be
as we accept them. Triumphant and sorrowful, the movie reminds me of 94's
Forrest Gump, another film where you had a man not quite knowing his world.</P>
<P>The plot is simple: the plot of any negative utopia book or movie. A man,
discovering that THEY are watching, does not like this and tries to escape.
But what is he escaping from? In reality it is paradise. Acted,
melodramatic, but still paradise. And the thing is, he's just like everyone
else in a small town: he wants to get out.</P>
<P>But we have people against him. The Big Brother (George Orwell's "1984") of
the establishment would rather he live in the dome, live and die on public
television. Of course this makes it a film about triumph. But it has a twist
to it: at the end, it makes it so you don't know what you want. Posed to go
out the door, part of you is cheering for him to run, and part of you wants
him to stay, to continue providing hope. He's told to say something. He
thinks. Opens his mouth and …</P>
<PRE>You'll have to see it for yourself.</PRE>
