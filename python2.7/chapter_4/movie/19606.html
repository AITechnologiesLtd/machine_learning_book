<PRE>LAKE PLACID
USA, 1999
Directed by Steve Miner
Written and produced by David Kelley
Reviewed by Kent Johnson</PRE>
<P>Of all the films in which TV shows have graduated to the big screen,
this left-handed spinoff of ALLY McBEAL, which might be better entitled
ALLY GOES TO THE LAKE, has to be the oddest.  The film is written by
ALLY McBEAL writer/producer David Kelley and the premise is, What would
happen if Ally, that neurotic, abrasive city girl (here a paleontologist
rather than a lawyer and named Kelly [sounds like "Ally" and is also the
writer's last name...]) had to camp out in the woods and interact with
the local sherrif, game warden and an eccentric millionaire mythology
professor?  Kelly is played by Bridget Fonda, who acts like and is
costumed to look like Ally McBeal.  While Bridget was very good and very
sexy, one wonders why the part wasn't played by Callista Flockhart.
(The possible answer is that Fonda was Kelley's first choice for the
Ally McBeal TV series, but she turned it down in order to stick with
feature films, so this was his chance to have her play the role.)
Oliver Platt (who was Kelley's first choice for the lead in THE
PRACTICE, but also turned it down to stick with feature films) is
excellent as the eccentric millionaire mythology professor and Brendan
Gleeson (I WENT DOWN, THE GENERAL) and Bill Pullman are very good as,
respectively, the sheriff and the game warden.</P>
<P>LAKE PLACID reminds me of the Dashiell Hammet novel THE THIN MAN, in
that while ostensibly a mystery novel, the mystery is actually the least
interesting part of the book.  The interaction between the characters
Nick and Nora is the interesting part and the mystery actually
interrupts it -- yet, the mystery is the hook that gets the reader to
pick up the novel in the first place.</P>
<P>In LAKE PLACID, ostensibly a monster movie, the interesting part is the
witty sniping between the four disparate main characters.  The dialogue
is artificial and not very believable, but it's clever, original and
hilarious.  The crocodile hunt, the excuse for these characters to be
together in the first place and the hook that gets the viewer into the
theatre, is actually the least interesting part of the film.  In fact,
once the characters know what they're up against, it's obvious that the
croc is outmatched unless the characters behave stupidly.  The beginning
and particularly the middle of the film, the parts with the most
character conflict, are the most entertaining.  The film cools down
rapidly in the last third when it has to concentrate on the croc hunt
and character reconciliation.  Since it's only OK as a monster movie,
some viewers may be disappointed, but those who can appreciate witty,
well-written comedy will enjoy it tremendously.</P>
<P>Sample dialog (paraphrased from memory):
[The professor is setting traps which the local sheriff objects to]
Professor [yelling]:
"These traps might just save your life and you should be concerned about
saving your life because it will give you that much more time to fuck
your sister!"</P>
<PRE>Recommended</PRE>
<P>Note:  The characters don't know what they're up against until the
middle of the film and the theatrical trailers were similarly designed
to give no hint of what the monster might be.  The film might have been
more effective if viewers had gone in without that knowledge, but of
course the two-month barrage of giant croc TV ads (which the characters
in the film somehow incredibly managed to miss) spoiled any chance of
that.</P>
<P>David Kelley's next projects are the movie MYSTERY, ALASKA and the
private eye TV series SNOOPS, starring Gina Gershon.</P>
