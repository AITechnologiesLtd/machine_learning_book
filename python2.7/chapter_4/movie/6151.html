                         Bound (1996)
                   A film review by Dave Cowen
                    Copyright 1996 Dave Cowen</PRE>
<P>Sitting in the sole film criticism course I took years ago
in college, I was suddenly puzzled as a montage of great
moments of movie romance flickered on the screen in front of
me.  While the course didn't focus on a certain era of film,
I suddenly realized that all of the powerfully romantic
movie scenes that I had witnessed were primarily in the
movies of the 30's and 40's.  I thought about the scenes in
more recent movies where characters exhibited romantic
chemistry, and couldn't think of a single one where the
chemistry between the two characters was so great that it
overpowered me like the older films.  Recently, however, I
realized that the kind of powerful romance I thought was
missing in cinema was making a comeback -- there have been
many scenes in films I've seen since 1994 that have taken my
breath away with the amount of love and passion exhibited on
the screen.  The common thread?  All of those scenes have
been between two members of the same sex.</P>
<P>Early in BOUND, Violet (Jennifer Tilly) spots Corky (Gina
Gershon) in an elevator she's riding with her boyfriend,
Caesar (Joe Pantoliano).  The camera hovers at the top of
the elevator, showing an aerial view of the occupants:
pinned to different points in the elevator.  Later, Violet
brings coffee over to the apartment next door that Corky is
working on, to have her turn off plumbing equipment that was
making quite a lot of noise.  Soon after, Corky receives a
call from the landlord that Violet has accidentally lost an
earring in the sink.  Corky goes over, and what follows is
one of the most erotic scenes that I've seen in any recent
movie as Violet, flush with desire, seduces Corky using her
breathy voice.  There's no nudity in that particular scene
-- it combines the kind of seduction present in the great
noir of the 40's with 90's sexuality in a mix which managed
to affect me more than any other romantic moment in any
recent film about heterosexuals.</P>
<P>Next, Caesar walks in the room and shouts in bewilderment.
"What the HELL is going on..." and then stops, realizes that
Corky is a woman, grins broadly and apologizes.  In BOUND
there is constant play between the noir conventions of the
40's and the modifications necessary for the 90's Chicago
the film is set in -- BOUND takes the noir genre and puts a
refreshing new spin on it, without ever succumbing to the
cartoonishness or day-glo absurdity found in PULP FICTION or
one of its multiple knockoffs.  Larry and Andy Wachowski
have the camera move in grand, smooth gestures, as if
they're trying to be parts Welles, Scorcese and Coen. They
engulf their images in such dark, noir tones that if the
film were rereleased in black and white and a few outdoor
scenes were edited out, nobody would notice the difference.
If anything, BOUND is worth the price of admission for the
production design alone.</P>
<P>It's hard to believe that the Wachowski brothers were
writers on the 1995 abomination ASSASSINS, a film which
seemed to showcase tremendous lapses in its characters logic
throughout the script.  In BOUND, on the other hand,
everything makes sense, nobody is stupid, and mistakes
aren't made.  Instead, you see the characters wrestling
through a situation, all trying to find the cleanest way
out... and typically becoming trapped and failing after
taking "the best possible move".  The character of Caesar
seems at first to be a stereotypically stupid mobster: but
as the film progresses, the script treats him with respect
as he tries his hardest to logically wrest himself from the
situation at hand.  Violet also, at first, seems to be the
standard bimbo, the kind who falls in with strong
personalities and can be taken advantage of (by the villain,
typically, as a plot point): but as the movie progresses,
that couldn't be further from the way she is.  There's an
economy of bullets and gunplay in BOUND, and what could have
amounted to a fairly standard standoff and shootout is
turned into a drowsy and dizzying scene by some incredibly
well-choreographed camera movements and realistic gunplay.</P>
<P>I typically dislike "thrillers" of this sort, as they're
typically collections of cliche arranged slightly
differently than another movie, without character
development, suspense, or genuine surprises.  Without the
intelligence, passion and artistry the Wachowski brothers
put into BOUND, the same script could easily have been
modified to make the same sort of boring so-called "erotic
thriller" or Gen-X crime drama that span the shelves at any
video rental store.  Instead, the Wachowskis take the
conventions of noir and bring them new life, creating an
erotic, suspenseful and ultimately very exciting film.</P>
