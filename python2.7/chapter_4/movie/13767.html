<PRE>Saving Private Ryan
by Curtis Edmonds -- <A HREF="mailto:blueduck@hsbr.org">blueduck@hsbr.org</A></PRE>
<P>Steven Spielberg is, perhaps, the greatest technical moviemaker of our
time.  He has made us believe in dinosaurs, extra-terrestrials, and that
the Ark of the Covenant could melt Nazis.  The hallmark of Spielberg
movies is that he makes you believe you are there -- whether it's a
ruined Egyptian temple or a concentration camp in Poland or a
raptor-ridden tropical island.  Every scene, every shot, tells us that
this is happening, right now, for real.  Only the best Hollywood
illusionists -- say James Cameron's painstaking recreation of the
Titanic, or Ron Howard's extraordinary weightless Apollo capsule -- can
be ranked with Spielberg in terms of sheer technical prowess.</P>
<P>However, just as someone can make a great cabinet without there being
anything inside, someone can be a great technical moviemaker without
making great movies.  And Spielberg's last two movies weren't great.
Although the dinosaur action in The Lost World was better rendered than
in Jurassic Park, the plot was a lifeless retread of the original
dino-classic.  Both the historical detail and the action scenes in
Amistad were outstanding, but the plot bogged down in legalistic
courtroom psychodrama.  From a technical standpoint, there wasn't
anything wrong with either of these two movies -- but they didn't live
up to the high standard that Spielberg has set for himself.</P>
<P>There was every reason to anticipate that the opening scene of Saving
Private Ryan -- the invasion of Omaha Beach by the Third Ranger
Battalion on June 6, 1944 -- would be a technical masterpiece.  And so
it is.  Veterans who were there say that Spielberg does a good job in
recreating the horror and agony of the Normandy invasion, and there can
be no higher praise.  Spielberg conveys the heroism and the confusion of
the landing spectacularly well, even recording some of the shots himself
with a hand-held herky-jerky camera.  With the resources of his own
studio behind him, and with Tom Hanks to serve as a visual anchor,
Spielberg has created one of the great war scenes in film history.</P>
<P>The "cabinet" of the movie is great.  The war scenes, while less
spectacular than the Omaha landing, are intricate and stunningly
well-designed, just as if Spielberg had personally placed every chunk of
rubble and debris in its proper place.  The set design is fantastic --
they even manage to recreate an authentic World War II glider, although
the originals were mostly smashed to bits on landing.  But what makes
Saving Private Ryan a great movie isn't the box the movie comes in.
This movie turns out to be bigger than its box.  Saving Private Ryan is
special because the story outshines even the quality of the filmmaking.</P>
<P>The story is simple:  Private James Ryan (Matt Damon) has lost two
brothers in the Normandy landing, and a third in the Pacific the week
before.  He is to be found and taken home to comfort his grieving
mother.  However, Ryan dropped behind enemy lines with an Airborne
division which was scattered behind enemy lines like so many spilled
needles.  Hanks, his top sergeant (Tom Sizemore) and a small crew must
infiltrate the German lines, find the lost soldier, and return him
safely home.</P>
<P>The quest for Ryan is accompanied by a long string of philosophizing
about the mission, punctuated by small-scale combat.  Hanks and his crew
don't like their task and don't appreciate the implication that Ryan's
life is somehow worth more than theirs.  This makes the movie sound a
bit talky, I know, but Saving Private Ryan frames its discussion of
these issues as real-life morality plays:  What's the duty of a soldier
to non-combatants?  Is it OK to shoot prisoners?  Is one man's life
worth sacrificing your own?</P>
<P>In doing so, Saving Private Ryan focuses on the Big Issues -- life,
love, sacrifice, honor, courage (and cowardice), death, defiance, and
duty.  By focusing on these issues, Spielberg transcends the conventions
of the war movie -- both as action movie and as horror movie.  Although
some of the excitement of combat and most of the horror of war are
displayed, the movie really isn't about either.  It's a celebration of
values -- and war movies should be about values, because the strains of
war places those values in sharp relief.</P>
<P>(And one of the things that separates Saving Private Ryan from the other
summer blockbusters it is that we can argue what the movie is really
about.  Try doing that with Armageddon.)</P>
<P>One thing that no one will argue with is the quality of the
performances.  Damon, so good as the cocky genius Will Hunting and the
sincere fledgling trial attorney in The Rainmaker, has a limited role,
but he doesn't allow the symbolism of his character to interfere with
his effective portrayal of a scared Iowa farmboy.  Sizemore is not so
much of an actor as he is a medium, bringing back the shades of all the
sergeants from every World War II movie ever put on celluloid.  The rest
of the squad seemingly falls into patterns -- wise guys from Brooklyn,
sharpshooter farmboys, sensitive writer -- but the young actors breathe
new life into all the old stereotypes.  The images of these actors --
the frozen, heartbroken countenance of Jeremy Davies, the hard stare of
Edward Burns, the cracker drawl and sharp eye of Barry Pepper -- are the
ones that will stay with you long after the last reel ends.  (Especially
Adam Goldberg, who confronts a line of German prisoners with the mocking
call, "Juden!  Juden!" as he fingers his Star of David.)</P>
<P>And Hanks?  If his competition so far is Jim Carrey's leaden performance
in the dismal Truman Show, we can declare the Oscar race over now.
There won't be a better performance this year by anybody.  The American
soldier is first and foremost a citizen, and Hanks uses his Everyman
quality to fill this ideal perfectly.  He's a hard-bitten combat veteran
with the eyes and spirit of a scared recruit -- but he's a formidable
and brave leader.  He's able to exhibit a fuller emotional range here
than he did as the muffled Forrest Gump or the steely-eyed missile man
of Apollo 13, which contributes mightily to the power of the film.</P>
<P>Saving Private Ryan is a fitting tribute to the virtues we hold dear and
to the men of our armed forces who exhibit these virtues in war and
peace.  As I said, no higher praise is needed.</P>
