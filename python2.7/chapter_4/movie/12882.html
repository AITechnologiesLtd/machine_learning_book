<P>As Jim Carrey's career moves forward, we are reminded that under the
rubber face of a stellar comedian is a man with the potential of being a
great actor.  Surely, Carrey has a long road ahead of him to prove he
has the endurance of Robin Williams, who began his career much in the
same way that Carrey did and is presently celebrating his career
achievements with an Oscar.  It will be interesting to see where Carrey
is in 10 years.  Definitely a bankable star, Carrey went for but fell
just short of the record for having five consecutive films earn 100
million dollars or more, domestically, at the box office.  'Ace Ventura:
Pet Detective' (1994), 'The Mask' (1994), 'Dumb and Dumber' (1994), and
'Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls' (1995) all made more than 100 million
but Carrey's disappointing romp in 'The Cable Guy' (1996) snapped the
streak he was going for.  In case you're wondering, the record belongs
to Tom Cruise, whose five consecutive 100 million dollar efforts are 'A
Few Good Men' (1992), 'The Firm' (1993), 'Interview With the Vampire'
(1994), 'Mission Impossible' (1996), and 'Jerry Maguire' (1996).  A
recent analysis of the movie industry reveals that Cruise is actually
3rd among active box office stars for total money grossed worldwide.
2nd is Tom Hanks and Harrison Ford is #1.</P>
<P>Meet Truman Burbank.  He's the first person to ever be legally adopted
by a corporation.  The reason:  to put his whole life on television for
the entertainment of a global audience, 24 hours a day, and without
commercial interruption.  As 'The Truman Show' begins, Truman (Jim
Carrey) is a happy go-lucky fellow, well into his thirties who lives in
the virtual reality town of Seahaven where some 5,000 hidden cameras
operate to capture the events that unfold in Truman's life.  Actually
and as described as virtual reality, Truman's world in the small town is
actually a giant television studio, the largest ever constructed, behind
the "HOLLYWOOD" sign and along with the Great Wall of China, is the only
man made object visible from outer space.  Truman's wife (Laura Linney)
and his best friend (Noah Emmerich) are actors and the town's population
are extras for the staging of the entire television production under the
control of a well meaning but misguided producer named Christof (Ed
Harris).</P>
<P>Truman's life is kept well under control and the film is convincing in
its explanation of why Truman has never left Seahaven, even for a
vacation.  He longs for his first true love (Natascha McElhone) who left
him earlier in his life when she was about to reveal the truth about
Truman's life as a t.v. show and the studio set up in general and she
was pulled from the production by Christof.  Even more convincing and
cleverly executed by the film makers is the way that Truman begins to
learn the truth about his life and how he has been deceived.  Little by
little and slowly but surely, he begins to discover elements that lead
him to believe that something isn't quite right with his life and he is
determined to seek out the truth.  Easier said than done as Christof
keeps him locked in the studio as his attempts to leave are usually
compounded with a weather storm, available by remote control or a road
block accompanied by some story of disaster such as a forest fire or
contamination spill, preventing Truman from leaving.</P>
<P>As described in 1976's 'Network' by news anchor turned tabloid prophet
Howard Beale (Peter Finch), television is in the "boredom killing"
business in which each scenario must be packaged into a neat 30 or 60
minute time slot.  'The Truman Show' elevates that theory as Truman
Burbank's life is real and the purpose of television is inverted in his
case and messages about the big brother syndrome are also well displayed
as a metaphor and the film's most important quality is the message of
how the human spirit will not be contained by anyone or for anyone.</P>
<P>Writer Andrew Niccol has penned an entertaining, evenly constructed and
strikingly original screenplay which is among the most interesting seen
so far in the 90's and director Peter Weir is the perfect man to have
made 'The Truman Show'.  His previous films such as 'Gallipoli' (1981),
'The Year of Living Dangerously' (1983), 'Witness' (1985), and 'Dead
Poet's Society' (1989), are all examples of how films can entertain
without injecting any elements of the usual Hollywood endings which are
often pretentious, a cop out or just downright unbelievable.  'The
Truman Show' will leave you wondering what is more important:  one man's
life living in Utopia or the challenge of living life with all of its
hurdles?  It's an interesting question not often asked by Hollywood in
such an original or thought provoking manner.</P>
