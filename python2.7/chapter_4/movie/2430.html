<P>     JAMON, JAMON, a "tale of ham and passion" (and literally
translated HAM, HAM) could perhaps be described as a "Grade B art
film."  Although possessing a biting wit and excellent sense of the
offbeat, too much of JAMON, JAMON follows obvious paths.  Had this been
made in Hollywood, it would be on the fast track to the late night
cable circuit.</P>
<P>     When Silvia (Penelope Cruz) breaks the news to her boyfriend
Manuel (Juan Diego) that she's pregnant, he immediately proposes,
giving her a soda-can top ring to seal the engagement.  And, while
Silvia's mom Carmen (Anna Galiena), the local whore, is pleased with
the arrangement, Manuel's mother Conchita (Stefina Sandrelli) is
outraged.  Intent upon breaking up the prospective marriage at all
costs, Conchita hires Raul (Javier Bardem), a would-be bullfighter with
all brawn and little brains, to woo Silvia away from Manuel.</P>
<P>     One of the most obvious problems with JAMON, JAMON is its subpar
acting.  Everyone in this film looks good (especially Penelope Cruz,
Anna Galiena--of THE HAIRDRESSER'S HUSBAND, and Javier Bardem), but
even the most accomplished of the performers have at least one bad
sequence (although, in all honesty, Ms. Cruz, who also appears in BELLE
EPOQUE, emanates such sensuality that it's easy to overlook her
less-impressive acting moments).  There are several scenes likely to
cause winces because of the inability of certain cast members to
adequately deliver their lines.</P>
<P>     JAMON, JAMON never reaches a stable tone, vacillating between
absurd comedy and over-the-top melodrama.  For variety, there's also a
sequence of surprisingly graphic violence.  The film is at its best
when it ventures into the realm of eroticism (had it gone to the MPAA
for rating, an NC-17 would have been likely), and some of the humor
during the sex scenes is among the most amusing.</P>
<P>     The absurd is clearly JAMON, JAMON's playground, with ham and
garlic as appetizers for every activity from lovemaking to duels with
animal haunches.  The movie is steeped in sex, and sometimes it's
all-but-impossible to figure out who's sleeping with whom.  Or,
perhaps more appropriately, who isn't sleeping with whom.  And then
there's the naked bullfight....</P>
<P>     JAMON, JAMON is missing the element which could blend its
disparate segments into an engagingly campy whole.  Without this, it
seems like a cheap cross between last year's LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE
and the French DELICATESSEN.  JAMON, JAMON is good for a moment's
diversion, but the overall impression is more of a ham sandwich than a
full meal.</P>
