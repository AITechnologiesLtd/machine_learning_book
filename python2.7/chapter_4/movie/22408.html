<PRE>MAN ON THE MOON</PRE>
<PRE>Brilliant. Compelling. Honest. Different. Extraordinary.

Just kidding. I am required to do at least 500 words. (And they could all be
superlatives.)</PRE>
<P>The idea of starting with the end is hardly brimming with novelty; it lacks
the originality and outrageousness of  Kaufman's devices to keep the
audience off balance, but in Man On The Moon it is a suitable harbinger of
things to come. If Kaufman had used this device he would have extended the
dead time long enough to get a strong reaction from the audience. The movie
makes you wait a while, but they barely push the envelope where Kaufman
would have torn it and thrown it to the air in pieces.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, a Hollywood project that is driven by integrity is a rare
thing indeed, and when it achieves the level of quality and entertainment
value of this movie, it easily stands out as one of the finest efforts of
the mature American film industry. That this project came right out of the
heart of its creators is exemplified by the fact, unprecedented to my
knowledge, that the members of the cast of TAXI played themselves as they
look today, without apologies for the age discrepancies. The audience is
expected to understand that this is a nostalgic tribute, a contrite act of
belated appreciation and formerly denied respect. Other people also play
themselves whether their recapitulated actions were flattering or
unflattering.</P>
<P>But a great movie must entertain greatly, and Man On The Moon delivers solid
entertainment, keeping your attention and curiosity from start to finish (or
is it finish to finish?), and in the process it captures the essence  and
the tragedy of an exceptional entertainer.  Man On The Moon proves that
Hollywood can abandon the straight jacket of formulas and still succeed.
Even Apollo XIII (man not on the moon) can not escape the formula rap,
because in its case real life was true to formula, but Kaufman broke all the
molds, and the absence of a detectable formula is one of the movie's great
virtues.  Hollywood's serious masterpieces tend to be sophisticated, its
adventure blockbusters tend to be frantic, its sensitive masterpieces tend
to be soft and soulful. But Man On The Moon is  pathos without bathos, a
serious movie that is very funny, a real movie that is not artsy, much less
fartsy. Throw in Academy worthy performances by Jim Carey and Danny de Vito
and the sense that you are seeing weird things that actually happened, mix
it with total integrity and a lot of heart, add technical elements at the
top of Hollywood's present capabilities, subtract special effects, dirty
words, nudity, sex scenes and explosions, top if off with hearty laughs and
a sense of tragedy,  and the result is a movie worthy of your intelligence;
assuming that you have enough, since it takes a little more than is needed
to love Titanic and The Green Mile. Those two are four star movies in a
scale of five, but Man On The Moon gets 4 ½.</P>
