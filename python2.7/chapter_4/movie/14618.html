<PRE>KALIFORNIA
Rating: *** (out of four)
R, 1993
Director: Dominic Sena
Screenplay: Tim Metcalfe
Starring Cast: Brad Pitt, David Duchovny, Juliette Lewis, Michelle Forbes</PRE>
<P>The other reviews I have read of KALIFORNIA have labeled it as everything
from a brilliant insight into humanity's capacity for evil to pointless
exploitative garbage. I don't really think it's either. It's a good film
with considerably more substance than most thrillers, yet it's not quite as
successful as it could have been.</P>
<P>Screenwriter Tim Metcalfe has created two edgy protagonists in Brian
Kessler (David Duchovny) and his girlfriend Kerry (Michelle Forbes). Brian
has a fascination with serial killers, and believes that most of them are
not really evil but tend to be the product of circumstances that hinder
their development as moral human beings. Kerry is trying to make a living
selling erotic photography, and Brian is supposed to be writing a book on
serial killers but is getting nowhere. The down-on-their-luck couple decide
to take a cross-country trip to California, and along the way they will
stop at the sites of several well-known murders so that Brian can try to
get inside the killers' frame of mind while Kerry takes the pictures for
his book.</P>
<P>Since they don't have enough money to make the trip by themselves, they
decide to advertise on a ride-sharing board. Another couple, Early Grace
(Brad Pitt) and Adele (Juliette Lewis), respond to the ad. Early seems
slightly intimidating and prone to violence (he takes Brian to a biker bar
and gets in a fight, and later shows Brian how to shoot a gun), and Adele
is spacey and disturbingly submissive to Early. Brian finds himself
strangely attracted to Early's impulsive behavior, while Kerry remains
suspicious, and with good reason: Early has recently finished a prison
term, and murdered his landlord right before taking off with Adele. By the
time Brian and Kerry fully realize what's going on, they are essentially
hostages as the trip continues. Still, Brian can't resist the opportunity
to try to understand Early's motivations, wondering if an abusive father
might have instilled his violent tendencies and asking him why he kills and
how it makes him feel. Brian's own fascination with violence, and his
forgiving attitudes towards those who engage in it, are both challenged by
the living example of Early Grace.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the challenge proves to be insufficient in the end. At the
heart of KALIFORNIA is the question of whether some people are truly evil
or if everyone is more or less a product of circumstance, but the material
presented can't really answer that question. Early is not, from my
admittedly limited knowledge of the subject, a serial killer. His murders
are spur-of-the-moment and are usually precipitated by anger or selfishness
(such as when he follows a wealthy suit-and-tie type into a bathroom, stabs
him to death, and takes his money). The issue of whether or not evil is
simply a more powerful force in some human beings than others cannot be
settled by the likes of Early Grace: he acts on impulse alone, and the
distinction between good and evil is essentially meaningless for him
(which, whether it was intended or not, actually seems to validate Brian's
theories).</P>
<P>The best way for a film with these underlying themes to conclude would have
been to unite the moral conflicts with the more immediate physical danger:
make the final showdown one between serial killer and serial killer
researcher. But since Early's characterization makes this impossible, the
only way for first-time director Dominic Sena to bring everything to a head
is to focus on the one conflict that is complete enough to drive the plot,
and it's also the simplest--Early is dangerous, and might kill Brian and
Kerry. The final moments of the film consist of a series of violent
confrontations and action scenes, some of which seem a little excessive
(which may account for the charges of exploitation from some critics). In
one sequence, for example, Early has kidnapped Kerry and driven to an
isolated house near a nuclear testing facility. Brian heads after them, and
as he approaches the house, he spins off the road as his truck overturns
and he is knocked unconscious. He awakes the next morning, walks the rest
of the way to the house, and attempts to rescue Kerry. Why not simply have
him drive up, park, and then confront Early? Well, I guess because then we
wouldn't have had the car crash scene.</P>
<P>Still, the filmmakers might have gotten away with this kind of incomplete
resolution if they had played their cards right. They could have
acknowledged that the issue really hinges on true serial killers or on
megalomaniacs like Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin, who carefully consider
and plan out the suffering they cause, and not on an animalistic thug like
Early. Unfortunately, they seem to be trying to fake it in the final reels.
In a final narration delivered without any noticeable irony, Brian seems to
think he's got it all figured it out and understands what constitutes human
evil. Personally, I think he'd better do a little more research before he
writes that serial killer book.</P>
<P>I have spent a considerable amount of time discussing where KALIFORNIA goes
wrong, yet it's not a bad film by any means. It's an engaging thriller with
a tight plot, sharply written characters, and some interesting ideas about
violence. It had the potential, however, to be a lot more, and ultimately
settles for good instead of great by confining the moral conflict to a
subplot and falling back on the familiar cushion of a violent action
climax. Still, there's some good stuff here, and I'll probably be keeping
my eye open for Sena's next film.</P>
