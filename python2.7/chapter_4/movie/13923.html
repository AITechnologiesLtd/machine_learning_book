<P>The highest-grossing movie of the summer of 1997, and the film that
most recently (as of the 3rd week of August, 1998) surpassed PULP
FICTION (7.5/10) as the most rented movie of the 1990's, MEN IN BLACK
marked the second consecutive summer in which Will Smith helmed the
summer-blockbuster king (He starred in 1996's INDEPENDENCE DAY (6/10)
as well.)</P>
<P>PLOT:
About 1500 aliens looking like humans, live amongst us on Earth (Most
of them in New York. Who knew?) A top-secret agency called the Men In
Black (MIB) monitor and police these creatures' every movement to
ensure that the public never finds out about them. One day, a "bug"
alien lands on Earth, and suddenly, the destruction of our planet may
be near. </P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Light, plotless, easy-to-digest science-fiction comedy that continues
to show off the comedic talents of Will Smith, some great straight man
sense by Tommy Lee Jones, and the hip special effects of the group at
Industrial, Light and Magic. Steven Spielberg executive produced this
brain-munch, while the man behind GET SHORTY (7.5/10) and the ADDAMS
FAMILY films, Barry Sonnenfeld, directed this venture. This movie left
no definable marks on my intellect, but did manage to blow by me real
quick (90 minutes to be exact), keep me awake, mostly interested, and
generally amused throughout its entire runtime.</P>
<P>I was somewhat disappointed in the fact that I had already seen most of
the cool special effect shots in the film's trailer, but I guess the
one-liners from Will Smith still managed to keep me in the game. I also
liked the "feel" of the movie, which was never more serious than it
needed to be. Just fluffy enough not to take seriously, and never real
enough for anyone to complain about the lame plot. One thing that I did
find extremely irritating and overdone, was Vincent D'Onofrio's
exaggerated cramps, cricks and overall disgustingness. If this was
supposed to be funny, it sure didn't work on me. All it did was make me
nervous and feel like itching. Admirable in regards to the actor's
physical capabilities, but unfunny in regards to its cinematic outcome.</P>
<P>The cutest things in this picture were the little "worm" aliens that
spoke in Mexican accents and were last seen carrying cartons of
Marlboro cigarettes through the alien airport on their way back home.
They should have expanded their roles in the film. On a sad note, a
virtual tear was brought to my eye when I saw, the one time decent
respected actress, Linda Fiorentino, degrade herself in a throwaway
role that makes any other throwaway roles look respectable (see Little
Known Facts below to discover her "clever" way of being cast in this
movie.) She delivered her useless lines in a dry "only here for the
paycheck" kind of way, and had no problem showing off her gams for the
duration of the entire picture (Why Sonnenfeld felt the need to keep
showing her hanging from a tree in a short skirt over and over, during
the denouement of this kid's film, I'll never know....well, actually I
do know, but I digress.) Overall, the film is easy enough to watch,
short enough not to have you care about the lame 1-2-3 plot, and funny
enough to make you smile if you're feeling blue.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts: 
Linda Fiorentino won her part in MEN IN BLACK in a poker game from
director Barry Sonnenfeld (I would have forfeited the game if I had
been her.) Besides the part in the movie, she won around $1200.
Chris O'Donnell was first offered the role of J (Eventually played by
Will Smith.)
In this film, the "known aliens" visible on the screen include
Sylvester Stallone, Dionne Warwick, Newt Gingrich, motivational
big-jawed guru Anthony Robbins, George Lucas, and executive producer
Steven Spielberg.
The joke told by K (Tommy Lee Jones) at the restaurant that ends in the
ambiguous punchline, "...yeah, but this one's eatin' my popcorn!" is
the same strange joke told by the stand-up comic at the burlesque show
in 1973's THE STING (7/10).
Barry Sonnenfeld started his career directing porn films. He's quoted
in the January 26, 1998 Newsweek magazine (page 60) as saying that he
was depressed when he heard that BOOGIE NIGHTS (7.5/10) was being made
(a film about making pornos) because he had wanted to make a movie
about the time he shot 9 feature length pornos in nine days. Barry had
been offered the job of directing FORREST GUMP (7.5/10), but declined.
The job then went to Robert Zemeckis who won an Academy Award for it.
Barry Sonnenfeld was the cinematographer on three Coen brother movies
including RAISING ARIZONA (8/10), BLOOD SIMPLE (8/10) and MILLER'S
CROSSING (7/10). Other films in her arsenal of cinematographic
experience include WHEN HARRY MET SALLY (9/10), BIG (7/10), THROW MOMMA
FROM THE TRAIN (7.5./10) and MISERY (8/10).
Tommy Lee Jones received a B.A. in English literature and graduated cum
laude from Harvard, 1969. That is where he roomed with future
Vice-President of the United States, Al Gore, and according to author
Erich Segal, the duo were the models for the character of Oliver in
LOVE STORY. Tommy has never taken an acting class. </P>
