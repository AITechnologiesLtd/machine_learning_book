<PRE>                         Nothing To Lose</PRE>
<P>The story is far-fetched; the overly-friendly relations between
our white hero and a black family are somewhat heavy-handed.  The
explanation involving the wife's infidelity is quite a stretch, and
the ending should have come sooner; no need to dot every "i" and
cross every "t."  Despite those caveats, I enjoyed almost every
moment.   It was a feel-good movie.</P>
<P>Nick (Tim Robbins) is an advertising executive who comes home early
one day and discovers his wife (Kelly Preston) in bed with his boss.
Nick flies out of the house and furiously drives away unmindful of
traffic.  His life is ruined; he has NOTHING TO LOSE.</P>
<P>A carjacker, T Paul (Martin Lawrence) pulls a gun on him when Nick
stops at a traffic light but Nick, crazy with grief and NOTHING TO
LOSE, not only takes a swipe at T Paul but gets him into the car
and drives away with him.   T Paul explains that he is an educated
person who cannot find a job.  In order to support his wife and
kids, he got the stupid idea of carjacking.  Before very long,
they become friends.   With NOTHING TO LOSE, Nick and T Paul set
out to rob Nick's boss for having slept with Nick's wife.</P>
<P>Unfortunately for Nick and T Paul, they are being followed by
another couple of gangsters, who like them, one is black and the
other white.  (Giancarlo Esposito and John C McGinley)  Neither
Nick and T Paul nor the cops on their trail are aware that there
are 2 sets of black and white suspects.</P>
<P>When T Paul goes home to his family with Nick, T Paul's mother
slaps them around; her son for staying out late and Nick for
probably being a bad influence. In the end, of course, everything
turns out fine . . . by use of two unoriginal bits of mistaken
identity to make the plot work.   Still, quite funny. and
entertaining.</P>
