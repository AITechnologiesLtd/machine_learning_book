<PRE>                                THE RELIC
                       A film review by Tim Voon
                        Copyright 1997 Tim Voon</PRE>
<P>Cast: Penelope Ann Miller, Tom Sizemore, Linda Hunt, James Whitmore
Director: Peter Hyams  Screenplay: Amy Holden Jones and John Raffo and
Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver based on the novel by Douglas Preston and
Lincoln Child.</P>
<P>Lots of dead bodies, opened skulls and missing hypothalamuses (no not
hippopotamus, but hypothalamus -- the brain stem) by the end of the
movie.</P>
<P>Yes, my heart jumped with every sudden movement and loud noise on
screen, and I had to shield my eyes with my file-o-fax when 'The Relic'
butchered humans; but the grandmothers sitting behind me seemed to
having a grand old time, giggling at every scene. Then it dawned on me
what they were laughing about, this movie was pure, contrived stupidity.</P>
<P>The story is about a relic in a large, old museum and you guessed it,
'The Relic' likes killing people. Lot's of cat and mouse chases, feeding
frenzies, festering fungi, enormous dung beetles and grouchy cops with
missing dogs.</P>
<PRE>Comment: Mediocre at best.</PRE>
