<PRE>                               TWISTER
                   A movie review by Jeff Graebner
                     Copyright 1996 Jeff Graebner</PRE>
<P>        I found TWISTER to be an exhilarating and extraordinarily
entertaining film, but one that features both major successes and
major flaws.  As initial reviews are already reflecting, TWISTER is
going to be a film that is going to be enjoyed by many but shunned by
others.  Depending on your tastes and expectations, this is a film
that could be either a very enjoyable experience or a frustrating
one.</P>
<P>        The visuals are absolutely remarkable, frequently presenting
the audience with images that are unlike anything ever seen in any
movie before.  All of the tornado sequences are absolutely convincing
and  well-designed, with enough variation in the look that the
sequences never seem repetitive.  This film is certainly another
triumph for Industrial Light and Magic.</P>
<P>        The very dynamic and exciting sound design also plays a major
role in creating the impression that the film is really taking you
into the path of a tornado.  This is a movie that absolutely >must<
be seen in a theater with a large screen and a good sound system.  It
is available in all three of the 6-track digital sound systems and it
is well worth the effort to find a theater using one of them.  Mark
Mancina's score shifts appropriately from fast paced action cues to
occasional full-blown choral pieces used to underscore the majesty of
nature.  The occasional use of rock songs is sometimes a bit
irritating, though, although in at least one sequence it does provide
for some clever humor (and a little bit of character definition).</P>
<P>        TWISTER is also an incredibly well-shot and well-directed
film.  As he did with SPEED, Jan De Bont once again shows an
incredible flare for creating inventively staged and frantically
paced action sequences.  The film certainly keeps moving and De Bont
is often successful at creating major tension >without< really
showing much. My guess is that many viewers will come out of this
film thinking that the tornados were visible on-screen much more
often than they really were.  De Bont has a background as a top
action movie cinematographer (shooting such films as DIE HARD and
BASIC INSTINCT) and he is teamed here with Jack N. Green (who has
shot several of Clint Eastwood's film).  The result is one of the
best looking action films in a long time.</P>
<P>        Unfortunately, the film's plot and characterizations fall way
short of the visuals.  The story is little more than a series of
cliched situations simply used to string together one spectacular
storm sequence after another.  The script is credited to Michael
Crichton and his wife Anne-Marie Martin.  Reportedly, such top
writers as Joss Whedon and Steven Zaillian did uncredited rewrites. 
It is surprising that such a top-notch group of writers failed to
bring more originality to the script.</P>
<P>        The film's plot primarily depend on well-worn cliches of this
genre, but it frequently doesn't even bother to play them out
completely. The story is centered on husband and wife scientists
(Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt) thrown into one last adventure together
before signing the divorce papers.  Oddly enough, though, the film
spends so little time on the relationship that it never even bothers
to tell us why they split.</P>
<P>        Another element of the plot involves a rival team of
scientists (led by Cary Elwes) racing with the heroes to deploy a
revolutionary research instrument that was invented by Paxton and
Hunt and stolen by Elwes.  Again, this rivalry is never fully
developed, with the conflicts never amounting to much more than
sequences of the two groups passing one another on the highway while
chasing down the same tornados.</P>
<P>        While the characters are mostly cliches, the actors manage to
do a great deal to flesh them out.  I'm sure the studio (or actually
studios, this is a co-production of Warner Bros. and Universal) felt
they were cutting costs by not using big name stars.  In reality, it
worked out for the best since they ended up with a number of actors
that are more talented than famous.</P>
<P>        The women in the film fare far better than the men.  Helen
Hunt, best known for her good work on the TV sitcom "Mad About You",
manages to bring a great deal of personality to her character. 
Through facial expressions and body language, she is able to convey a
facination and awe for the natural phenomena that she has dedicated
here life to studying.  She also conveys much of her feeling for
Paxton's character in the same manner.  Hunt's acting skill fills in
a lot of blanks in the characterization that aren't filled in by the
dialog or situations.</P>
<P>        An unexpectedly effective performance is given by Jami Gertz
as Paxton's new fiance, who ends up being dragged along when he goes
after the tornados.  This is a character that could have easily been
very irritating, but instead Gertz manages to create a very
sympathetic and believable character while also serving several
necessary functions.  In a few scenes she provides some welcome comic
relief as a therapist who occasionally is trying to council patients
on her cellular phone while driving into the path of a tornado.  On
other occasions, she provides the required non-expert so that other
characters can explain scientific details needed by the audience. 
Both Gertz and the writers are to be commended for avoiding the easy
temptation to make this character unpleasantly unsympathetic.</P>
<P>        Bill Paxton's performance is competent, but unlike Hunt and
Gertz he is never really able to rise above the writing.  The film
does leave quite a bit of his motivation somewhat hazy and he doesn't
make much of an attempt to fill in the blanks.  His chemistry with
Hunt is not non-existent, but it isn't spectacular either.  Cary
Elwes comes off even worse, with a role so thinly drawn that you
often forget he is even in the movie.</P>
<P>        There are some recognizable faces in the supporting cast, but
none are ever allowed to make much of an impression.  Hunt and
Paxton's team is made up of a number of familiar types, but nobody is
ever really allowed to create a distinctive personality.  This is
something of a disappointment after the unexpectedly well-defined
supporting characters in De Bont's SPEED.  This difference is
particularly well-illustrated by Alan Ruck, who appeared in both
films.  In SPEED, he had some of the film's best lines in his amusing
role of a tourist who was a passenger on the bus.  In this film, he
is one of the scientists and never has anything more to do than
simply shouting road directions into a radio.</P>
<P>        In the long run, I found that the flaws in TWISTER really just
didn't matter that much.  The film is tremendously enjoyable and
truly showed me sights that I had never seen before.  If you manage
to get into tune with the film's strengths, as I did, the weaknesses
will ultimately seem to not be that important.
