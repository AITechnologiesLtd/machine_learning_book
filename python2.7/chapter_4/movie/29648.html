<PRE>UNTAMED HEART (1993)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2001</PRE>
<P>Hollywood filmmakers in 1990s missed plenty of opportunities
for truly great films when they decided to stick to the
formula and simplify plots and characters as much as
possible. However, there are some occasions when simplicity
can be a virtue, and when attempts to spice up films for the
sake of originality can be counterproductive. One of
examples of simplicity that works could be found in UNTAMED
HEART, 1993 melodrama directed by Tony Bill.</P>
<P>The protagonist of the film is Caroline (played by Marisa
Tomei), waitress in Minneapolis diner. She is beautiful
young woman, but her search for "Mr. Right" is fruitless -
each of her romantic relationships ends with disappointment.
One night, on her way home, she gets attacked by rapists,
but Adam (played by Christian Slater), her introverted
colleague, comes to the rescue. This incident marks the
beginning of the romantic liaison between Caroline and her
rescuer. Two of them are very happy, but one thing casts a
shadow on their bliss - Adam was born with a heart disease
and his condition can be fatal unless he gets another heart.
Adam nevertheless refuses to go to surgery, convinced that
his heart is part of his identity.</P>
<P>At first glance, Tom Sierchio's melodramatic script looks
terribly old-fashioned and almost ridiculous in its attempts
to manipulate viewers' feelings. However, two things rescue
UNTAMED HEART from turning into disaster. One of them is
blue collar setting of Minneapolis - it represents something
of a refreshment compared to the majority of similar films
that usually take place in New York or Los Angeles; and it
also brings realism necessary for us to forget that we are
being manipulated. The other great asset of this film is in
the cast. Marisa Tomei excels in the role so different from
the one that brought her "Oscar" in MY COUSIN VINNY, while
Christian Slater obviously works very hard in order to show
people that he can play shy, introvert and almost retarded
people - so different from the characters that brought him
fame. Because of that and Tony Bill's professional
direction, UNTAMED HEART is a nice example of Hollywood
craftsmanship that could be recommended to audience hungry
for good old tearjerkers in these cynical times.</P>
