<P>   What do women want?  The answer is furnished in a New
York Times magazine article that appeared on October 11,
which cites a poll taken among a large group of young Italian
women about the man with whom they would most want to
take a cruise.  Twenty percent chose Leonardo Di Caprio. 
Thirty percent picked Roberto Benigni.  Now, Leonardo Di
Caprio is cute as a button and, the word is, he's to make 25
million on his next picture.  Robert Benigni is scrawny,
balding, older, ungainly, and has nowhere near the wealth
that the youthful American possesses.  My conclusion? 
Money and looks are fine and will effect a following.  But what
a woman wants most is a man who can make her laugh.  </P>
<P>   Who better than Benigni?  He is Italy's foremost comedian, 
sometimes called the Robin Williams of his country, but in
movies like "Johnny Strecchino" and "Son of the Pink
Panther" is more attuned to the agility of Charlie Chaplin. 
Looking at him in his latest creation, "Life is Beautiful"--in
which he appears as the film's center and is its director and
co-writer--you'd swear he was the reincarnation of Mr. Chaplin
doing his own version of "The Great Dictator" but with a
headier mixture of pathos and burlesque.  Sometimes called
two movies in one, in that the first half is pure burlesque while
the latter segment mixes anguish with humor, "Life is
Beautiful" is unified by the realization that the Benigni in the
initial part is really no different from the man in the second: he
is merely putting his imagination into overdrive to protect the
family he loves so dearly.</P>
<P>   The title comes from one of Trotsky's writings as he
awaited impending death from one of Stalin's hit men: he said
he still believed that life is beautiful.  Benigni, in the role of the
father of a five-year-old boy who together with the boy and
the boy's mother is in a World War 2 concentration camp,
wants to hide the reality of the situation from the youngster, to
make his child believe throughout the ordeal that life remains
beautiful amid the inhumanity of the quarters.</P>
<P>   The first fifty minutes of the two-hour film is feather-light,
filled with physical and verbal comedy in equal amounts. It
includes one scene that is not only side-splitting but which
effectively satirizes the insane racial theories that were
guiding the Italian Fascists shortly after Mussolini signed a
pact of alliance with Hitler.  The initial scene sets the tone.  In
a case of mistaken identity Benigni (Guido) is traveling by car
down a road when the brakes give out.  Unable to stop he
virtually plows into a crowd of people who await the arrival of
their king and, as Guido tries to wave them away, his
gestures are interpreted by the adoring multitude as a
greeting, prompting them to return the display.  Soon
thereafter Dora (Nicolette Braschi--who appears in all of
Benigni's films), an upper-class woman engaged to a
pompous Fascist official, literally falls for Guido as though
from the sky. Through a series of meetings that Guido has
secretly planned, Dora pulls away from the arrogant official
and marries Guido, but not before he carries out one of the
picture's two hilarious scenes.  In yet another case of
mistaken identity, he is thought to be a Fascist dignitary
inspecting an elementary school and is expected to give the
assembled students some details on the new Aryan racial
theory that's all the rage.  Manipulating his gaunt body to the
hilt, Guido pretends that he is himself the perfect Aryan
specimen, possessing not only perfect ears but more
important the ideal belly button--which he demonstrates to the
open mouths of the assembled faculty, administrators and
kids.</P>
<P>   Some time later Guido, who now has a 5-year-old son,
Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini), is arrested and sent by train to a
concentration camp, while Dora, who is not Jewish, insists on
being deported along with her family.  Guido determines to
protect his son from the horrors that now face them by
pretending that the whole journey and incarceration is a game
with the ultimate prize a tank for the person who can
accumulate 1,000 points.  The games include points for
remaining silent, for hiding, for refusing to complain about the
lack of food.  When Giosue informs his father that the soldiers
intend to make soap and buttons out of them and to cook
them in an oven, Guido manages to laugh that off by showing
how absurd it would be to think that "this button is Francesco"
or "that piece of wood is a lawyer."  (Ironically enough, that
wildly unbelievable concept is perfectly true, a pathetic
testimonial to the way the most cultured nation in Europe
became engulfed in mass psychosis.)</P>
<P>   Nicoletta Braschi in no way has the depth as a performer
that the inordinately gifted Benigni enjoys and does not reflect
the sense of anguish or passion that would make her decision
voluntarily to go to the camp believable.  One supporting role
stands out, though; that of Horst Buchholz in the guise of a
German physician, Dr. Lessing, who was once a guest in an
Italian hotel and who struck up a friendship with Guido.  When
their situation has changed and Dr. Lessing finds himself a
German officer inspecting the prisoners for signs of disease,
he is severely conflicted almost to the point of a breakdown in
discovering that Guido is a prisoner there.  Little Giorgio
Cantarini's performance is nothing short of miraculous. 
Cantarini is wise well beyond his years, adopting the rhythm
of the role as though he were a puppet completely under the
dominion of his dad.  He winks at his father at appropriate
moments, ducks and hides as though he were a noble hound
reacting to the slightest wave of his master.  But he is
anything but an inanimate puppet, furnishing proof in scene
after scene of his unalterable love for his protective papa.</P>
<P>   "Life is Beautiful" does not show the true horrors of the
death camp as other anti-Nazi films have done.  The
prisoners are worked to the bone, starved, dispirited and
broken physically and spiritually.  Yet they seem to go to their
daily hard labors without a complaint and come "home" at
night tired but not genuinely frightened.  At no time does a
German officer so much as hit a prisoner, nor are there
frightening scenes of hangings.  Though the little boy does
not like the smell of the miserably overcrowded quarters, we
see no evidence of toilet problems.  In fact in one scene a
German appears positively cartoonish as he barks orders to
the inmates of the bunk in his own language, using Guido to
interpret.  Guido, further protecting his son from fright,
"translates" the commands into purely comic directives.</P>
<P>   What Benigni is after, then, is not yet another Holocaust
picture like "Schindler's List" but rather a fable-like invention
about the value of limitless family love in the face of
institutionalized madness.  Benigni is an original, carrying off
a task that no other filmmaker has realized in quite the same
way.  "Life is Beautiful" indeed deserves the host of prizes it
has garnered--the Grand Prix at the 1998 Cannes Film
Festival and the David di Donatello Awards (the Italian
Oscars) for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director and Best
Screenplay.  It's quite the style nowadays for filmmakers to
combine comedy with melodrama, but how many helmers can
successfully link physical comedy, parody, cultural
observations and the surreal as Benigni has just done?</P>
