<PRE>                             THE PARTY
                    A film review by David Landers
                     Copyright 1997 David Landers</PRE>
<P>RATING: *** out of **** - 7.0 out of 10.0
CAST: Peter Sellers (Hrundi V. Bakshi), J. Edward McKinley (Fred
Clutterbuck), Herbert Ellis (Director), Claudine Longet (Michele Monet)
DIRECTOR: Blake Edwards
CERTIFICATION: PG
YEAR OF PRODUCTION: 1968</P>
<P>THE PARTY is one of those classic slapstick comedies that will leave you,
at times, cracking up.  The film takes place, for the most part, in
real-time during an exclusive evening party that is attended only by the
biggest names in Hollywood. </P>
<P>Hrundi V. Bakshi, played very well by Peter Sellers, is a struggling actor
who just came to America from his homeland, India.  Hrundi tries out his
acting talents, but it seems that he just isn't cut out for the job.  On
the set of his current film that he stars in, Hrundi seems to make
everything go for the worse.  During the filming of this movie set in the
1800's, Hrundi manages to annoy the director (Herbert Ellis) in any way he
can.  This includes a pitiful acting job in many scenes, wearing an
underwater watch in one scene, and accidentally detonating a massive set.</P>
<P>Many of the Hollywood producers and big names want Hrundi out of the
business forever.  And when the director makes a personal phone call to
Mr. Clutterbuck (J. Edward McKinley) pleading for Hrundi's ejection from
Hollywood, everything is pretty much over for Hrundi.  Clutterbuck writes
his name down on a piece of paper to insure that Hrundi will never again
work in Hollywood.  But when this piece of paper turns out to be the guest
list for Clutterbuck's exclusive party, Hrundi is invited, and certain
chaos is bound to occur.</P>
<P>Of course, as predicted, Hrundi causes lots of trouble.  Each scene in
which Hrundi encounters a situation, usually one that he can't handle, is
almost always very humorous.  And each scene with Hrundi and the drunken
waiter, who is alone hilarious, adds to the comedy in a great way.</P>
<P>THE PARTY can be compared to many other films of it's type, specifically
the trio of NAKED GUN movies and the AIRPLANE movies, but THE PARTY is a
delightful movie that incorporates very well played out comedy into
believable situations.  It also includes a number of memorable scenes (can
anyone say "birdy num-num"?).  If you're in the mood for fun and enjoyable
slapstick comedy, check out THE PARTY.  It's not going to be one of your
all-time favorites, but if you enjoy this type of humor, you'll enjoy THE
PARTY.</P>
