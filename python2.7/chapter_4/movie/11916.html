<PRE>CITY OF ANGELS (1998)
A film review by Liz Rizzo
Copyright 1998 by Liz Rizzo</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  ** out of ****</PRE>
<P>Starring Meg Ryan, Nicolas Cage, Andre Braugher and Dennis Franz
Written by Dana Stevens and Wim Wenders
Directed by Brad Silberling
Produced by Atlas Entertainment and distributed by Warner Bros. [US]</P>
<P>`She didn't believe in angels until she fell in love with one.'</P>
<P>I really wanted to like this film.  And for the first few scenes, I was
there, ready to be swept away.  Unfortunately, `City of Angels' doesn't
quite come together and really gets weak toward the end.</P>
<P>First we meet Seth, who we know is an angel because it's Nicolas Cage
and we saw the previews.  He seems to be trying a little too hard to
appear angelic.  Then we meet other angels who seem quite vampiric as
the movie progresses (I have to admit I loved this).  There are shades
of Anne Rice novels all over this film - unfortunately the mythology
created is incomplete, at times weak and left me wanting more.  However,
what was presented was interesting and, for the most part, effective. 
Now for the obvious comparison:  Cage's Seth is the complete antithesis
of Travolta's Michael, and after the first few scenes his performance
becomes so flat (and this is purposeful) that I found myself wondering
who could have played this role better.  I almost wished they had gone
with Denzel Washington!  Almost.</P>
<P>Next, we meet heart surgeon Maggie Rice (coincidence on the Rice?), and
Meg Ryan is excellent, as usual, as is Dennis Franz when he emerges as
one of her patients, Nathan Messinger.  For those who missed the famous
NYPD Blue shower scene, `City of Angels' provides you yet another chance
to view Dennis Franz's famous back side.  Somebody just loves this man's
butt!  The character of Nathan is fun, and Franz appears to enjoy
playing him.  Andre Braugher gives a good performance as Seth's friend
in the angel world.  Sadly, this only makes Cage's performance appear
flatter.</P>
<P>To the film's credit, we do care about Maggie, we believe and enjoy the
development of her relationship with Seth, and we are fascinated by the
angels and the world which is created.  But towards the end, which is so
often the case, the film falls apart.  For all the careful pacing and
build up, the last third goes too quickly, we lose our belief in the
story line, and we simply are not allowed to feel long enough.  Just as
`The Lost World' did not capture the wonder of `Jurassic Park,' `City of
Angels' simply does not attain the emotional, mystical power of say,
`Ghost' (another obvious comparison).</P>
<P>And most annoyingly, and I hope I'm not giving anything away here,
someone's probably patting themselves on the back for (skip to the next
paragraph if you're afraid I'll ruin it for you) not going with the
Hollywood ending, when this is exactly the film that should have gone
there.  The end of this film is actually trite, although there is a
flash (albeit brief) of brilliance in the final development of Seth's
character.  Thankfully, and it's actually a relief, Cage is allowed to
act during the final scenes, and he does it well.</P>
<P>Another kudo:  `City of Angels' stays away from excessive use of special
effects, which would have seemed tired.  But in the final analysis, I
was left feeling like this was a film based on a book that must be
better (another Jurassic Park/Lost World reference would fit here).  I
wish it existed so I could read it.  There's a lot of interesting stuff
here.  What I am going to do is rent `Wings of Desire,' the 1987 German
film that `City of Angels' is a remake of.  And if that doesn't satisfy
me, maybe I'll just reread the Anne Rice vampire series.  </P>
