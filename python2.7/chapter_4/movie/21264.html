<P>Pretty weird. Here I was thinking about how much this film reminded me of
BEAUTIFUL GIRLS (8.5/10) as I walked happily out of the movie theatre, and
how great it was that director Malcolm Lee got his first big break via his
more famous cousin's help (Spike Lee ya'll), that I realized that the former
film was also directed by a novice at the game of directing, Ted Demme, who
also happened to have a much more famous uncle in the biz (Jonathan Demme
anyone?). Oh well. Just thinking out loud.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A best man at a wedding comes together with his old college buddies a couple
of days before the exchange of the vows, and is suddenly placed under a
magnifying glass when his first novel (To be launched on Oprah, thank you
very much!) gets premiered by all of his friends. It isn't long before each
friend begins to recognize themselves in the book and learn secrets about
one another which they never knew.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Great film, great script, great premise and great characters. This film was
funny, it was poignant, it was timely (Okay, maybe that's just me, but it's
definitely geared to all twenty-somethings), it was always interesting and
an overall joy to absorb. The film talks about coming of age, career and
love-life sacrifices, accepting adulthood, and even more so, appreciating
commitment. I hope people don't avoid this film because they think it's just
another "black movie" because this film has absolutely nothing to do with
the color of one's skin. It's about love, friendship, trust, honesty, and
forgiveness. But even more than that, it's about a bunch of guys, each of
which I could relate to one or a few friends in my own life, who meet,
drink, play poker, enjoy a certain night of bachelor fun, and who discuss
women, their lives, their hopes, their dreams and once again, their
relationships and impressions of the women in their lives. In fact, a lot of
frank discussion travels along this film, as well as plenty of well-timed
humor and romance.</P>
<P>Girls might enjoy this film a little more for that aspect (Yes, Mrs. JoBlo
loved it!), but guys will remain in the ballgame with plenty of connection
to the lively male characters, all living down something or another in their
lives. Congratulations to director Malcolm Lee for putting together such a
solid effort his first time around the bend, with excellent performances all
around. I especially enjoyed Morris Chestnut's performance as the
over-sexed, but ready-to-settle-down-now football player who wants to get
married so that he could quench his promiscuity. The audience that I saw it
with tonite loved this movie and demonstrated their enjoyment with plenty of
spontaneous rounds of laughter and applause filling the house. They, as well
as me, I must admit, also hooted and hollered at the presence of actor Taye
Diggs without his shirt every so often (Mark Wahlberg: Part Deux?) with
another Oscar-worthy performance by his rock-solid pectorals. Supporting
nomination for his ass? :) Actually, I thought Diggs was okay in this film,
but not as good as his smaller role in GO (8.5/10). Having said that, the
film itself was a complete success, with plenty of fun, interesting twists
and turns, moments of cringing, moments of crying and moments of flashbacks.
A little too clean of an ending for my taste, but hey...I guess some happy
endings do also happen in real life, right? See it with your friends or your
better half, but not both together. It might just get ugly! :)</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Director Malcolm D. Lee is director Spike Lee's cousin. Spike was also
producer on this film. Malcolm's only other screen credit before writing and
directing this film was "assistant to Mr. Lee" in 1995's CLOCKERS. Spike
Lee's birth name was Shelton Jackson Lee. He's been married since 1993,
stands 5'5" and was actually born in Atlanta, Georgia (Being such a huge
Knicks fan, folks generally tend to think that he was born there as well).
I know Taye Diggs best from his slick role in one of the best movies of
1999, GO, but many others may remember him from his role of Benny, the evil
landlord in the Tony Award winning stage production of "Rent", or his
re-occurring role as Adrian "Sugar" Hill on TV "The Guiding Light" from 1997
to 1998. Of course, his big break came when he landed the lead role opposite
Angela Bassett in 1998 HOW STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK. He was born in
Rochester, New York and received a BFA degree in musical theater from
Syracuse University.
Actress Nia Long also spent some time on the cast of TV's "The Guiding
Light" as the character of Katherine "Kat" Speakes from 1991 to 1993. Of
course, most of you TV freaks might remember her from her re-occurring role
of Lisa Smith, Will Smith's girlfriend, on "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air".</P>
