<PRE>THE BIG ONE
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Michael Moore, best known for his anti-GM documentary Roger and Me, has
set himself up as the working man's hero.  He prides himself in sticking
it to corporations where it hurts, and never taking his focus off the
little guy.  The Big One is his latest documentary (a welcome change of
pace after his abysmal Canadian Bacon), and in it, he does what he does
best.</P>
<P>During 1996, Moore undertakes a multi-city book tour to promote his
book, Downsize This: Random Threats From An Unarmed American.  He brings
along a film crew, ostensibly to document the tour, but he has another
agenda in mind.</P>
<P>Big corporations have been reveling in Wall Street's billion dollar
profits, and yet layoffs and downsizing continue to be the norm.  Moore
uses his book tour as the basis of a quest to find someone who can tell
him why.</P>
<P>As he travels from city to city, the story randomly unfolds.  Sometimes
he is simply meeting with laid off employees at his book signing.  At
other times he talks with employees struggling to form a union.  And
then there are his classic corporate ambushes, where, with film crew in
hand, he tries to force his way in to meet with a CEO, to deliver such
awards as "Downsizer of the Year", or a check to pay the first hour of
the first Mexican worker in a company's new plant.</P>
<P>Moore's corporate humor, while obviously biased, is apt, and the
highlight of the film. He stumbles a bit when he ventures into political
humor however.  The 1996 campaign already seems like the distant past,
and is only going to seem more and more dated.</P>
<P>The film is never quite as biting as Roger and Me.  Some of this arises
from the impromptu feel of the film, but overall his antics seem much
more forced here. The "in-your-face" school of journalism is at full
force here.  A lot of the film is composed of cheap shots...but they're
funny cheap shots.</P>
<P>If you enjoyed Roger and Me, The Big One delivers more of the same (just
not in the same dose).  Moore's offbeat brand of humor should have
something to slightly amuse nearly anybody, even if you don't quite
agree with his politics.</P>
