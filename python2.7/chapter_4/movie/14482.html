<PRE>PERMANENT MIDNIGHT
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1998 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        There's something about Ben Stiller that makes him a popular choice
among casting directors these days.  Stiller currently has three projects
in circulation, and what other actor can lay claim to that?  He's in
"There's Something About Mary," which I *still* haven't seen.  And he's in
the acerbic "Your Friends & Neighbors," playing a talkative,
sexually-frustrated drama coach called Jerri.</P>
<P>        Now there's "Permanent Midnight," in which Stiller plays another
Jerry, this one a heroin-addicted television writer, last name Stahl.</P>
<P>        There's also something about this industry that pushes bankable
stars like Stiller into doing drug-addiction pictures the minute they've
proved themselves commercially.  Ewan McGregor springs to mind who, after
successful turns in "Emma" and "Brassed Off," received greater respect and
admiration for his mind-blowing realization as Renton in Danny Boyle's
transatlantic junk-fest, "Trainspotting."</P>
<PRE>        The philosophy appears to be a simple one: If you want 'em to be
taken seriously, make 'em do drugs.</PRE>
<P>        "Permanent Midnight" is based on the true life experiences of Jerry
Stahl, a successful Hollywood writer who, in the mid-eighties, had a
$5,000-a-week job churning out plotlines for disposable TV sitcoms and a
$6,000-a-week heroin habit.  A habit, in Stahl's own words, "the size of
Utah."</P>
<P>        As Stahl, Stiller contributes a commanding performance.</P>
<P>        Unlike "Trainspotting," which was successful in having it both ways
by chronicling both the highs and the lows of heroin abuse, "Permanent
Midnight" instead focuses on the concept of drug addiction as maintenance.
One of the earliest observations in the film is a casual reference to
"Naked Lunch" author William S. Burroughs who, when asked why he shoots up
first thing in the morning responds, "so I can shave."</P>
<P>        Stahl rarely appears to be puncturing veins for the thrill of it
all in "Permanent Midnight"; it's so he can talk to his mother on the
phone, show up for work on time, even pay his bills.</P>
<P>        While the film itself occasionally wobbles around along with Stahl,
the writing (adapted from Stahl's autobiography by director David Veloz) is
controlled and pointed.  "Permanent Midnight" shows how Stahl moved from
New York to L.A. to--again in the author's words--"escape the drug scene"
(yeah, right); why he entered into a convenient marriage with a British TV
exec (Elizabeth Hurley, so impossibly polite you'd swear her single
profanity was dubbed); and that he conceived a child in between his random
hirings and firings.</P>
<P>        Stahl narrates all this in a motel bedroom to a sympathetic lover
called Kitty (Norristown's own Maria Bello) with whom he spent some rehab
time.  Janeane Garofalo is wasted--and miscast--as a heavily-bespectacled
Hollywood talent agent who fails to get her hooks into the doped-up
wordsmith, and that's Stahl himself playing a jaded clinic counselor.</P>
<P>        Stiller, unshaven (Burroughs take note) and with lots of mascara
around the eyes, has Stahl stumble through the film looking like a train
wreck but, to his credit, never once pushes his pill-popping,
needle-jabbing performance over the top.</P>
<P>        The ubiquitous Stiller is the reason to see "Permanent Midnight"; a
dark, comic, and strangely absorbing study of assisted living.</P>
