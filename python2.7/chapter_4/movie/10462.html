<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   I think there's one thing that its many enthusiasts and handful of
   detractors can safely agree on: there isn't anything remotely
   innovative about Gus Van Sant's latest film, GOOD WILL HUNTING,
   co-written by stars Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.  It is what it is --
   a relentlessly feelgood drama following a conventional, utterly
   predictable storyline focused upon a directionless young man with
   talent to burn, and the attempts of those around him to help him find
   the right path.  The film's about as unsubtle as a brick through your
   front window, but damned if it isn't effective.</P>
<P>   20-year old Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is a once-in-a-generation-type
   genius who can instantly recall obscure passages from texts and has
   the inherent raw ability to casually solve mathematical problems
   which are considered year-long endeavours by some of the world's
   greatest minds.  However, Will's decidedly working-class, and
   cheerfully so; the film presents the irony of a high school dropout
   toiling as a janitor at the prestigious MIT who's more brilliant than
   any of the university's students *or* teachers.  He's also a bit of a
   handful; orphaned and in and out of foster homes during his
   childhood, Will's had several run-ins with the law.  When
   award-winning professor Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard of BREAKING THE
   WAVES and INSOMNIA, in another fine performance) presents his class
   with a thorny mathematical challenge, he's taken aback when the
   correct solution appears on the blackboard outside the lecture hall
   the very next day.  None of the students take credit for the
   anonymous answer (they must be pretty honourable over at MIT; at my
   old school, you'd find no shortage of brownnosers who'd falsely lay
   claim to the honour in a heartbeat), but Lambeau is stunned to find
   that it's Will who's the resident genius when he catches the janitor
   scrawling the solutions to a second challenge on the blackboard.
   Before Lambeau can take the prodigy under his wing, Will finds
   himself under arrest after zealously striking a police officer
   intervening in a neighbourhood altercation involving him and his
   buddies Chuckie (Ben Affleck), Morgan (Casey Affleck), and Billy
   (Cole Hauser).  Lambeau convinces the authorities to give Will
   parole, hinging on a weekly math session and the promise of
   counseling.</P>
<P>   It's at this point where the film shifts its focus to where its
   interest lies: the relationship that develops between Will and
   similarly-wounded therapist Sean McGuire (Robin Williams), and how
   after initial dislike and mistrust, they slowly bond and eventually
   help each other overcome past traumas.  Cue the maudlin music.</P>
<P>   The film's hokey and sentimentalist, but it works, successfully
   remaining uplifting and heartwarming despite its obvious generic
   formulism.  To a good extent, the film's ability to overcome problems
   associated with predictability can be credited to the solid
   performances turned in from its impressive cast.  Mr. Williams is
   fine in his quiet, self-contained role, never lapsing into his
   typical zany persona; he carries himself with demeanour of a man
   whose silent sadness weighs upon him like an anchor.  Meanwhile, Mr.
   Damon impresses as the title character, effortlessly alternating
   through Will's many faces -- street tough, brilliant genius, charming
   suitor, exasperating smart-ass, fragile soul -- he's convincingly
   persuasive in all of them.</P>
<P>   Credit has to be allocated to helmer Gus Van Sant as well, who
   fortunately refrains from beating the audience over the head during
   the film's frequent emotionally poignant moments.  His helming is
   thoroughly competent workmanship, with one scene standing out as
   particularly visually striking: a sequence with Will and new love
   Skylar (Minnie Driver) contentedly chatting in bed, which is
   wonderfully lit and shot in close-up by cinematographer Jean Yves
   Escoffier as a great tapestry of flesh and shadows filling the frame,
   gently shifting and rolling like a series of wakes on the sea.</P>
<P>   The GOOD WILL HUNTING screenplay is exceedingly neat and tidy,
   ensuring that everything is brought full circle, and that every major
   event in the film meticulously ties into a prior anecdote.  This may
   or may not be a good thing -- it's certainly tidy screenwriting, but
   it comes across as overly calculated, and plays out onscreen with a
   noticeable loss of spontaneity, particularly in the film's coda where
   key lines are dropped like dominos.</P>
<P>   I admired that the film's screenplay had the temerity to make its
   protagonist not only impertinent and belligerent (albeit, naturally,
   in a loveable, audience-winning sort of way), but even occasionally
   downright cruel to those around him, goading other sympathetic
   characters and zeroing in on their soft spots.  However, the change
   in the Lambeau character as the film progressed seemed particularly
   arbitrary, an artificial means with which to bring the plot to a
   head.</P>
<P>   The themes and storyline of GOOD WILL HUNTING are hardly fresh; they
   are, however, executed effectively.  There's a great deal of
   crowdpleasing material in the film -- one-upmanship of hissable
   characters, warm fuzzy emotional epiphanies, cute snappy one-liners
   -- and if one can ignore the sheer predictability of the story and
   overlook the shameless tugging on the heartstrings, there's much to
   enjoy.</P>
<P>   If anything, the genesis of the GOOD WILL HUNTING project is more
   interesting than the film itself.  Penned by childhood buddies Matt
   Damon and Ben Affleck while they were struggling actors, their
   screenplay generated a bidding war among the studios which quickly
   elevated to a figure of an even million dollars -- if the actors
   would detach themselves from the project.  Resolved to stay on as
   actors on their project, the duo stuck to their guns and eventually
   sold the screenplay (with themselves attached as stars) to Castle
   Rock Entertainment for a lesser fee of $500 000.  The project
   eventually made its way over to Miramax, who have to be delighted
   with the way things have worked out; during the interim, these two
   then-unknowns have blossomed into the hottest young actors working
   today -- Mr. Affleck, fresh from the critically-acclaimed Kevin Smith
   film CHASING AMY, will appear in the upcoming summer Bruce Willis
   vehicle ARMAGEDDON, as well as Dimension's sci-fi thriller PHANTOMS
   and New Line's comedy BALLING THE JACK.  Meanwhile, Mr. Damon seems
   to have been anointed as Hollywood's new It guy (taking over from pal
   Matthew McConaughey), scoring coveted roles with directors as
   esteemed as Francis Ford Coppola (JOHN GRISHAM'S THE RAINMAKER) and
   Steven Spielberg (the upcoming SAVING PRIVATE RYAN).  Well done,
   gents -- but as for GOOD WILL HUNTING: cripes, what's with the
   ridiculous title?</P>
