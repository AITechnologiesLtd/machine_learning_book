"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Anjelica Huston's directorial debut, Bastard Out of Carolina, was a
devastating portrayal of child abuse in a poor Southern family.  The
film was so powerful that it either turned your stomach or pissed you
off, and in some cases both.  In contrast, Huston's second film, Agnes
Browne, is devastatingly mediocre.  It didn't quite turn my stomach, but
it did piss me off a little.</P>
<P>Unlike Carolina, Huston (Buffalo '66) tackles duties both in front of
and behind the camera, casting herself in the titular role.  Here she
plays the dirt-poor widow of a late hotel kitchen employee with seven
children in 1967 Dublin.  She can't afford to bury her recently deceased
husband and borrows forty pounds from a loan shark named Mr. Billy (Ray
Winstone, The War Zone), agreeing to pay two pounds a week in interest.
With her only viable source of income coming from the operation of a
fruit and vegetable stand, Agnes can barely afford to feed her flock,
let alone cough up Mr. Billy's interest.</P>
<P>The oldest Browne child is Mark (Niall O'Shea), who wants to drop out of
school to help his mom put food on the table.  Brother Frankie (Ciaran
Owens) develops a taste for gambling, while Agnes' best friend Marion
Monks (Marion O'Dwyer) develops a lump in her chest.  Agnes also gets an
admirer in the form of Pierre (Arno Chevrier – think of a cross between
Gerard Depardieu and `Stuttering John' Melendez), a French entrepreneur
opening a bakery near her produce cart.  Throw a Tom Jones concert in
the mix and, well, you get a pretty jumbled story.</P>
<P>That's the main problem with Browne.  The film is based on the Brendan
O'Carroll novel `The Mammy,' which was, in turn, based on an old serial
radio program.  Browne is simply five or six scripts from the radio show
scrambled together, which makes the ending seem particularly silly,
since all of the plots are neatly tied up with (mostly) positive
resolutions across the board.  It shouldn't – they're still impoverished
and have no solid income.  Try not to giggle when Agnes proudly states
to her children, `We're the Brownes; we stick together.'</P>
<P>Browne certainly isn't a total waste of time.  There are highlights –
Mr. Browne's funeral procession is comical, while Marion's conclusion
that the lump in her breast is the result of having her first `organism'
is downright hysterical.  The acting is decent all-around, with Huston's
effective Irish brogue a high point (she grew up in Ireland).  Browne is
a colorful picture, but the slight film just doesn't seem to be able to
get off of the ground.</P>
<P>1:35 – R for adult language and mild violence</P>
