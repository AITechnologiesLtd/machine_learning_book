<PRE>                                THE WITCHES
                       A film review by Laurie Mann
                        Copyright 1990 Laurie Mann</PRE>
<P>     We saw the last (SNIFF!) Jim Henson movie over the weekend, a
marvelous movie called THE WITCHES.</P>
<P>     THE WITCHES starts off in modern day Norway, with some fabulous
scenes of flight over the glaciers.  A grandmother tells her
impressionable grandson all about witches and how to avoid them.  His
parents are abruptly killed, and his grandmother takes him home to
England, and then to a seaside resort for a little vacation.</P>
<P>     The seaside resort is also the the meeting place for the annual
witches convention.  The grandmother recognizes an old adversary, and
the grandson stumbles over a meeting of the witches' annual meeting.</P>
<P>     In this movie, witches look much like regular women, except that
they wear wigs, elaborate rubber masks, and gloves.  When the meeting
begins, the witches "let down their hair" so to speak, and a room of
fairly normal-looking women becomes a gaggle of bald crones.</P>
<P>     As the Grand High Witch, Angelica Houston is given truly hideous
makeup in this scene.  She's a wonderful presence in the film, but she
speaks with a really awful Germanic accent.  That accent was one of the
few missteps in the film.  (I think the ending was a slight misstep too,
but, if Dahl wrote the ending that way, I'm not going to complain too
much.)</P>
<P>     Aside from the witch makeup, another wonderful bit of makeup
effects occur when people are turned into mice, an occurrence which
happens throughout this movie.  When the grandson and a friend of his
are turned into mice, the camera looks at the world from their
point-of-view---about 1/4 inch off the ground.</P>
<P>     I don't want to give too much away about this marvelous and
inventive film.  Go see it, and take the kids unless they are sensitive
or easily frightened.</P>
<P>     (This was X-posted to sf-lovers because I think THE WITCHES is
currently the strongest contender for the dramatic presentation Hugo
next year.  It completely blows BACK TO THE FUTURE III out of the
water.)</P>
