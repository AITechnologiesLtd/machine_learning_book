<P>In recent years we have had some humourous and uplifting films dealing
with the highest office in the world.  'Dave' (1993) and 'The American
President' (1995) are examples of movies done with the look of a Frank
Capra classic i.e. 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.'  In an age of the
anti-politician, 'My Fellow Americans' is the perfect lampoon on the
men who often seem out of touch with the people they represent.
Republican one term President Russell Kramer (Jack Lemmon) and
Democratic one term President Matt Douglas (James Garner) are
inadvertently thrown together in a survival for their lives after they
uncover a scandal in the current White House where a present day
Republican President (Dan Aykroyd) sits.  Some great one liners and a
few nifty stunts make for good entertainment and it would have been
appropriate to entitle this 'Grumpy Old Presidents' as the humour is
similar to that of 'Grumpy Old Men' (1993) and 'Grumpier Old Men'
(1995) both starring Jack Lemmon.  As the movie progresses we see some
very serious moments as Kramer and Douglas are put in touch with real
Americans who are given the opportunity to explain how their lives have
been ruined because of policies the Presidents implemented when they
held office.  Surprisingly, Jack Lemmon is upstaged by the relaxed and
hilariously moody performance turned in by James Garner who settles
into his character almost with poetic ease while Lemmon plays his role
with stiff uptightness but both profiles work on a professional actor's
level and the contrasting personality of the two is convincingly
executed.  It's the perfect holiday movie which goes overboard at times
by being extremely silly but its redeemed by an entertaining climax and
a good ending.  It's fun watching two actors like Lemmon and Garner who
can hold their own with anyone in Hollywood but who have the sense of
humour not to take themselves too seriously from time to time.</P>
