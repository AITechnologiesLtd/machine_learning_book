Susan Granger's review of "Dr. Seuss' How THE GRINCH Stole Christmas"
(Universal)</PRE>
<P>      It's like Christmas coming early with this heart-warming
gift of a live-action comedy fantasy. Ron Howard's enchanting screen
adaptation of Dr. Seuss' story not only tells the tale of the Whos in
Whoville but the imaginative screenplay by Jeffrey Price & Peter
S. Seaman, narrated by Anthony Hopkins, delves deeply into the
backstory of the grouchy, gruff Grinch (Jim Carrey), revealing what
made him so bitterly malevolent, living alone in a cavernous cave on
the top of Mr. Crumpit with only his dog Max as company. The plot
revolves around little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen), whose parents
(Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon) are immersed in the crass commercialism of
Christmas, particularly besting a neighbor (Christine Baranski) in the
Whobilation lighting competition. Curious about The Grinch and his
contemptible behavior, Cindy Lou investigates what seared his soul,
made him an outcast, and inspired his vengeance. Buried under layers
of rubbery make-up and green fur with his eyes covered by contact
lenses and his mouth full of false teeth, Jim Carrey is, nevertheless,
delightfully zany. Production designer Michael Corenblith has created
a visual Who world worthy of the genius of Theodor S. Geisel, who
wrote as Dr. Seuss. Clustered like a medieval European village,
Whoville's haystack houses are decorated with, literally, thousands of
twinkling lights. Rick Baker's make-up and Rita Ryack's padded
costumes, particularly the hats, are inspired, and James Horner's
music is terrific. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Dr. Seuss'
How THE GRINCH Stole Christmas" is a classic 10. Children will adore
it, teens will find it hip, and adults will flock back to see it. This
magical package of pure pleasure leaves you a bit happier to be
alive. Don't miss it!</P>
