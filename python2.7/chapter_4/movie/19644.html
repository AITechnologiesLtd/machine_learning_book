A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Jan De Bont</PRE>
<P>Written by: David Self, based on the classic Shirley Jackson novel</P>
<P>Starring: Lili Taylor, Liam Neeson, Zeta-Jones, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Owen
Wilson</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
Three people sign up to participate in an insomnia study for 900 bucks a
month: Eleanor (Lili Taylor), Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones), and Luke (Owen
Wilson). Little do they know, their kindly host Dr. Marrow (Liam Neeson)
isn't doing an insomnia study; he's doing a secret study on fear. Soon
enough the three subjects find themselves padlocked in a creepy old mansion
once owned by a demented industrial tycoon. </P>
<P>Opinion:
The movie takes a while to get started. Nothing really exciting happens in
the first half. In the second half, the special effects take over, with the
haunted mansion doing a lot of morphing. These are great effects, but they
can't make up for plot holes you can drive a truck through. Like, how come
everyone keeps falling asleep if they're supposed to be insomniacs, and
they're in the scariest place on earth? Accompanying a suicidal friend,
what normal person would leave the hysterical friend in a dark, closed,
frightening, haunted room in order to get a cup of tea? Also shouldn't they
give Eleanor's great grandmother a name? Great effects, but what about the
story? </P>
