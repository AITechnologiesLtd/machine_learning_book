<P>     The average movie about the abortion debate tends to be preachy, 
melodramatic, and unbearably solemn.  So, it comes as something of a 
shock that the latest venture to the front line of the pro-life/pro-
choice battle is actually a *comedy*.  Director/co-writer Alexander 
Payne has taken the slogans, name-calling, and behind-the-scenes 
tactics, and created a vicious satire that skewers (and probably 
offends) those on both sides of the issue.  There's a serious message 
here, as well -- that in a war between ideologies, it's too easy to lose 
sight of the individual.</P>
<P>     As ambitious and unconventional as Payne's approach is, however, it 
doesn't always succeed.  The most serious and the most outrageous 
elements of the film occasionally work against one another.  CITIZEN 
RUTH is moderately more successful than THE LAST SUPPER in attempting an 
evenhanded lampoon, but there are times when the comic elements seem 
forced and overplayed.</P>
<P>     Laura Dern (RAMBLING ROSE) is Ruth Stoops, a glue-sniffing, 
alcoholic drifter who has been arrested 16 times for "hazardous vapor 
inhalation".  She has given birth to four children, all of whom have 
been taken away from her by the government.  (She's a walking definition 
of the term "unfit mother".)  Her family and friends have disowned or 
abandoned her.  Now, after being jailed for getting high on patio 
sealant, she learns that she's pregnant again.  The judge decides to 
allow charges of felony criminal endangerment of the fetus, but tells 
Ruth that if she gets an abortion, he'll reconsider.  Suddenly, Ruth's 
case becomes a lightning rod for local activists.  The struggle for 
Ruth's conscience pits the Baby Savers, run by an evangelical husband-
and-wife team (played by Kurtwood Smith and Mary Kay Place), against a 
pro-choice organization headed by a lesbian feminist (Swoosie Kurtz).  
The situation rapidly develops into a war where the weapons are coercion 
and bribery, and the last thing anyone seems to care about is Ruth. </P>
<P>     CITIZEN RUTH starts out dark and grim, with the first ten minutes 
devoted to exposing Ruth in various states of degradation.  In short 
order, she goes from being a whore to a beggar to a glue-sniffer.  It's 
an uncomfortable way to begin any film, especially one that wants us to 
laugh.  I'll give Payne credit for being daring, but his approach is not 
an unqualified success.  The switch to comedy is unheralded, and may 
alienate more viewers than it entices.  Personally, while I found the 
transition disconcerting, the results are ultimately worthwhile.  </P>
<P>     Laura Dern gives an excellent performance, allowing herself to be 
photographed in an extremely unattractive fashion, with no makeup, dark 
circles under her eyes, and lank, unwashed hair hanging below her 
shoulders.  She plays Ruth as a selfish, but very human, character who 
only cares about the pro-life and pro-choice movements in relation to 
how she can benefit from them (preferably financially).  In an odd way, 
the strength of Dern's acting could almost be seen as detrimental to the 
film.  If Ruth wasn't this believable, the most over-the-top aspects of 
the satire wouldn't feel as overbearing.  </P>
<P>     Every character except Ruth is a pure caricature -- the 
personification of an exaggerated point-of-view.  The most obvious 
example of this is the national pro-life leader.  Played with delicious 
self-parody by Burt Reynolds, he is the kind of smarmy, hypocritical 
creep who gives televangelists a bad name.  Holy and pious in public, he 
is shown to be vain, greedy, and arrogant in private (he even has a 
personal "boy toy" servant).  Reynolds' liberal counterpart, portrayed 
by Tippi Hendren, is presented as more subdued, possibly because she has 
much less screen time.</P>
<P>     CITIZEN RUTH has its share of bitingly funny moments, and some of 
the comedy is quite inventive.  By structuring the film as a satire, 
Payne is able to make statements about the abortion issue that no 
straight film would likely attempt, and, as is often the case, there's a 
great deal of truth buried in the humor.  In fact, CITIZEN RUTH's 
weakest moments occur not when it's savaging social causes and political 
concerns, but when it attempts to inject conventional drama into its 
exaggerated, outrageous milieu.</P>
