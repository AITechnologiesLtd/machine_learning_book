<P>If you loved "Patch Adams" and "Stepmom," ignore this review and run, do 
not walk, to see "The Other Sister." If, however, you detest cheesy, 
emotionally manipulative, contrived pabulum, avoid this sap-fest like the 
plague. As the proud father of a retarded son, I generally applaud any 
film championing acceptance and independence for mentally-challenged 
individuals, but this movie is insufferable and, at 128 minutes, a 
torturous endurance test. </P>
<P>Like most contemporary melodramas, "The Other Sister" features uptight 
white people fussing with their kids in affluent settings (apparently the 
filmmakers believe that those unable to stomach the story can at least 
while away the time admiring the plush houses). In this case, the rich, 
white pain-in-the-ass is Diane Keaton, playing a priggish woman standing 
in the way of her mildly-retarded daughter's romance. </P>
<P>The mother of three, she beams with pride at her one "normal" daughter, a 
radiant girl about to marry an all-American guy. Meanwhile, she refuses 
to acknowledge another daughter's female lover, explaining to her 
exasperated offspring that she isn't a bigot because she donates money to 
gay causes. As for her retarded child, Mom adopts a strained martyr's 
smile anytime the girl commits a social faux-pas and throws a fit 
whenever the young woman tries to assert her independence. Tom Skerritt 
suffers nobly as the crinkle-faced ex-drunk husband, a kindly soul who 
serves as the voice of reason and acts as arbitrator between mother and 
daughter. The only intriguing question raised by the film is why a man 
like this remains married to such an unrelenting harridan. </P>
<P>Juliette Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi play the mentally-challenged love 
birds, affecting "retarded" voices, but otherwise using perfect syntax 
and eloquent phrasing. Right. Never for a moment do they seem like 
anything other than two actors doing handicapped shtick. Playing a 
retarded person is difficult. Tom Hulce pulled it off in "Dominick and 
Eugene" and Leonardo DiCaprio was convincing in "What's Eating Gilbert 
Grape," but more often than not, even the most talented performers come 
across as mannered and unconvincing. Lewis and Ribisi, two generally 
impressive actors, are patently phony here (when Lewis asks Ribisi who 
invented sex, watch him recite his punchline while shamelessly aping 
Dustin Hoffman's "Rainman" delivery).</P>
<P>Their characters are painfully unrealistic Hollywood clichés, mentally-
challenged individuals presented as eternal children in adult bodies, who 
possess a naive wisdom and innate decency that makes them so very, very 
"special." One of the film's most irritating scenes shows the pair 
dressed up for a Halloween party in an absurd swan outfit and a ragged 
puppy suit. Virtually every mildly-retarded person I know wants to be 
viewed as an adult and not "special" or childlike. They have to work 
extremely hard to receive the same treatment the rest of us take as a 
given. Ask my son to put on a puppy suit and he'll tear your head off, 
chastising you for even suggesting he do something so babyish and 
undignified.</P>
<P>Had the folks behind "The Other Sister" done a little research, they 
might have noticed things like that. But, of course, that's a lot to 
expect from director and co-writer Garry Marshall, the amiable boob 
responsible for such TV perennials as "Happy Days," and cinematic gems 
like "Pretty Woman," "Dear God" and "Exit To Eden." Marshall is the king 
of glossy schlock and "The Other Sister" fits neatly into his sit-com 
oeuvre. Adept at grinding out handsomely photographed trifles filled with 
contrived moments calculated to get the crowd cheering, Marshall wouldn't 
know a genuine emotion if it came up and bit him. Actually, it's 
surprising that he wasted valuable time on a film like this when he could 
have been developing money-making projects more attuned to his skills, 
you know, something along the lines of "Laverne and Shirley: The Movie." </P>
