<PRE>Volcano (1997)</PRE>
<PRE>        Starring: Tommy Lee Jones, Anne Heche
        Directed by Mick Jackson</PRE>
<P>Why do disaster movies come in pairs?  Youâ€™d think one
volcano movie or one asteroid movie per summer would be
enough.  (Maybe even that would be one too many.)</P>
<P>But Iâ€™m not going to gripe about how many small budget gems
could be made for the price of this dinosaur.  Itâ€™s a big, dumb,
fun movie.  It almost made me want to go out and rent its
sibling, â€œDanteâ€™s Peak.â€?  Well, almost.</P>
<P>Like the packaging promises, the coast is indeed toast as a
volcano erupts in the middle of Los Angeles, threatening to
destroy the city everyone loves to hate.  Tommy Lee Jones, as
the intrepid head of the Office of Emergency Management,
saves everyoneâ€™s bacon practically single-handedly.  The
movie is filled with the usual stock characters: venal city
officials who ignore the threat till too late, pushy reporters, the
pretty scientist, and the faint of heart who discover their inner
hero.  Thereâ€™s even a cute pooch, rescued at the last moment,
guaranteed to bring a lump to your throat ... if youâ€™re especially
susceptible to that kind of schmaltz.</P>
<P>Tommy Lee Jones is at his craggy-faced best in this movie, as
he deadpans though tons of silly dialogue.  The writers have
envisioned the head of OEM as a godlike being, and Tommy
Lee spends most of the movie in the streets yelling at cops,
firemen, and hospital administrators, telling them what to do. 
He pulls it off, too, which is kind of surprising given the way
heâ€™s dressed.  Heâ€™s wearing a short sleeve dress shirt and a
baseball cap, a wardrobe combo that usually shouts out â€œpencil
pusher,â€? â€œnerd,â€? maybe even â€œretard,â€? but hardly
â€œaction-adventure hero.â€?  Anne Heche overcomes a bad haircut
to play the role of the pretty geologist.  Sheâ€™s the brains of the
operation, although given the competition she faces here, that
may be faint praise.  She does a creditable job of playing
small-but-plucky, and thereâ€™s even a feminist subtext as
Tommy Leeâ€™s character tries to keep her from taking on jobs
that are â€œtoo dangerous for a woman.â€?</P>
<P>Thereâ€™s a strenuously earnest racial-harmony subtext too, this
in the wake of the LA riots, with a bullet-headed white cop and
a burly black guy whose mutual hatred collapses in the face of
shared danger.  It all ends with the innocence of babes as a
small child babbles â€œeveryone looks the same!â€?  Black and
white, everyoneâ€™s covered with volcanic ash, you see.  Problem
is, everyoneâ€™s the same depressing shade of gray.  The credits
roll to tune of Randy Newmanâ€™s highly ironic â€œI Love LA.â€?</P>
<PRE>Iâ€™ve paid more to see worse.</PRE>
