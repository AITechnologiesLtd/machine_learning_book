<P> Swordfish (2001) 1 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring John Travolta, Hugh Jackman,
Halle Berry, Don Cheadle, Vinnie Jones and Sam Shepard. Written by Skip Woods.
Directed by Dominic Sena. Rated R. </P>
<P>At the outset of Swordfish, John Travolta's Gabriel Shear is pontificating about
the status of American cinema today. </P>
<P>Basically, he says, it boils down to a lack of imagination among the majority of
writers. </P>
<P>How ironic, as Travolta seems to be describing his latest venture. </P>
<P>Swordfish is loud, violent and amoral. It has the audacity to justify murder and
mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life. </P>
<P>And how does Travolta's Gabriel plan to do this? By robbing billions from his
own government and using the funds to out-terrorize terrorists. </P>
<P>Swordfish is a very cynical movie. It relies on an audience's perception of our
leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as non-human, faceless
entities not worthy of compassion or consideration. </P>
<P>The movie's plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film
ever slowed down, you'd actually see how ridiculous it all is. This is a
live-action Road Runner cartoon, moving so quickly that it's over before you can
catch your breath to ask any reasonable questions. </P>
<P>The storyline revolves around super hacker Stanley Jobson (Hugh Jackman),
recruited by Gabriel to crack the government's computer codes so Gabriel can
gather billions for his anti-terrorist campaign. Talk about whacked-out
patriotism. </P>
<P>My objections to Swordfish are many. The body count is high, but that is
expected in a movie of this sort. It's becoming a bore watching anonymous
soldiers, police officers and government agents blown to bits. </P>
<P>Another example is the family dynamics between Stanley, his 10-year-old daughter
and his ex-wife. Stanley, though having served time in prison for hacking, is
shown as a loving and caring father, forbidden by his ex to see his little girl.</P>
<P>Audience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse by showing her
as a drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husband's adult
films. </P>
<P>Thus when she is found murdered late in the movie, neither Stanley nor his
daughter are allowed any time to grieve. In fact, subconsciously, many in the
audience are probably glad she was killed. </P>
<P>Then there is the sequence involving one of Gabriel's henchman holding a gun to
the head of Stanley's daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key computer
program for Gabriel. Children as pawns have become a most unwelcome cliché in
recent films. </P>
<P>There is enough violence in the real world involving children without having to
make them on-screen victims as well. 
Yea, it's only make believe, but that doesn't mean you have to tolerate it. </P>
<P>Travolta is cool, deadly charming and flamboyant as the near-crazy Gabriel. His
character is reminiscent of his villainous characterizations in Broken Arrow and
Face/Off. </P>
<P>Jackman looks dour through most of the proceedings. His only moment of any depth
comes when he finally is able to create the worm to get inside the government
database. His sense of joy and accomplishment is one any computer whiz can
appreciate. </P>
<P>Halle Berry is decorative and lovely as Gabriel's assistant, while Don Cheadle
is given little to do as the head FBI agent hunting Gabriel. </P>
<P>Swordfish plays like a comic book with a larger-than-life character in Gabriel.
Viewers align themselves with him despite their uncertainty if he is hero or
villain. And maybe that is the movie's underlying flaw: There is no real hero to
speak of, only those doing their upmost to survive. </P>
<P>And that is not enough. This is one Swordfish that should have been thrown back
in the water. </P>
