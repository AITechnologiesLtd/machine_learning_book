<PRE>Review of Hairspray (1988)</PRE>
<P>Seen on 25 October 1998 with Laura at the American Museum of the Moving
Image for $16 (part of missed double feature)</P>
<P>If you take John Waters's word as the Gospel Truth, and as far as I can
see, there is no reason you ought not to, music was a lot more fun before
the Beatles "came along and ruined everything." Hairspray is a homage to
that era, when dances had names and watched them on local versions of
American Bandstand. According to John Waters, all the dances you see in
Hairspray were ones he "knew and did them drunk at home with his friends."</P>
<P>Because Hairspray is campy and a lot of fun, the teens are very clean cut,
sober, and if they are addicted to anything, it's hairspray and mirrors,
and yeah, dancing.</P>
<P>For those of you who have somehow missed the last ten years, or simply
never saw Hairspray,  its the simple story of the Turnblads versus the von
Tussles. A hefty Tracy Turnblad (Ricki Lake in her movie debut) auditions
for the Corny Collins show, much to the ire of bitchy Amber von Tussle
(Colleen Fitzpatrick), who's on the Student Council and doesn't like too
much competition, or fat girls.</P>
<P>It's also 1962 and segregation is still in high gear; the Corny Collins
show still has a "Negro Day" and there is no interracial dancing. But as
luck would have it, Tracy's best friend Penny Pingleton (Leslie Ann
Powers) falls in love with Seaweed (Clayton Prince), a black boy. He's the
son of Motormouth Mabel (played by Ruth Brown herself), who is determined
to teach the white children how to dance the "Bird" as well as integrate
NOW.</P>
<P>And so the fun ensues. Tracy becomes a celebrity, does ads for Mr. Pinky's
Hefty Hideaway store for big gals, and even woos Amber's boyfriend, Link
(Michael St. Gerard). The girls squabble, and eventually, so do their
parents. Divine and Jerry Stiller are Tracy's parents, Debbie Harry and
Sonny Bono are the von Tussles.</P>
<P>When it was made, Hairspray was the most mainstream and tame of John
Waters's movies, with Female Trouble and Polyester being the most
representative of his body of work. Hairspray still retained the
"shocking" aspects that were Waters's trademark--close ups of zits being
exploded, rats crawling over a foot during a makeout session in an alley,
a time bomb in a up hairdo. It's all a lot of fun, though, if not a little
unreal. In real life, integration didn't happen; the show was run off the
air by parents who were "more racist than the kids," according to Waters.</P>
<P>Speaking of racist parents, Jo Ann Havrilla is a scream as the hyperracist
mother or Penny Pingleton, who goes nuts in a black neighborhood and
literally incarcerates Penny to keep her from her black beau.</P>
<P>Pia Zadora and Ric Ocasik appear as beatniks. Shawn Thompson as Corny
Collins; Mink Stole as his sidekick Tammy. Writer and director John Waters
appears as the doctor who tries, unsuccessfully to hypnotize Penny into
only liking white boys. </P>
<PRE>Ten Years Later</PRE>
<P>At the museum, John Waters spoke about Hairspray and his work in general,
and took questions from the audience. One thing that shocks just about
everybody is that Hairspray is now a staple of children's parties. Waters
said that he is often recognized by children as "the doctor from that
movie." He also says that Ricki Lake had just been turned down for a job
by the Gap before he cast her in the movie, but he knew she was destined
for greatness (or a least fame--have you seen Mrs. Winterborne? Not
great, not at all). </P>
<P>He's also a little more than shocked to discover one of his movies on the
AFI's Top 100 films-of-all-time list.</P>
<P>He also noted that Divine, who looked like a lot of the woman in the
Baltimore neighborhood in which he grew up (also depicted in Hairspray),
died shortly after the movie was released, and her fame was about to be
fulfilled. He also told us that people leave donuts, dresses, and
eyemake-up on Divine's grave.</P>
<P>On his years of working with Divine, he summed it up best: It was a
combination of "Divine's extreme beauty and my mental illness."<HR>Copyright (c) 1998, Seth J. Bookey, New York, NY 10021
