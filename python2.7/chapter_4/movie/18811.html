<PRE>_Limbo_ (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>For 99% of its running time, the latest unconventional, uncommercial
opus from writer-director John Sayles clearly had me and the entire
audience with whom I saw it.  _Limbo_ is set in sleepy Port Henry,
Alaska, where lounge singer Donna (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, belting
her own vocals) and fisherman Joe (David Strathairn), both damaged from
their pasts, take their first, tentative steps in a romance.  One such
step is Donna, reluctantly accompanied by self-destructive daughter
Noelle (Vanessa Martinez), agreeing to join Joe on a boat trip that
quickly goes awry in a number of ways, leaving the three to fend for
themselves against all manner of threats in the Alaskan wilderness.</P>
<P>The audience was completely engrossed by the intelligently crafted story
and involved in these believably complex characters, all terrifically
played by the lead trio (newcomer Martinez is particularly affecting). 
When the ending came, however, everyone was noticeably upset, as was I. 
Without giving too much away, Sayles extends these characters' emotional
limbo into something literal, and while I understand what he was going
for, it doesn't quite work.  Ultimately, he leaves his characters (and
the audience that grows to care for them) in, as one of the definitions
listed in the film's trailer goes, "a state of oblivion or neglect," all
in the name of a gimmick that is less clever than it is fatally
distracting.</P>
