<PRE>BLOW (2001)
Reviewed by Jerry Saravia
Originally viewed on Spring, 2001</PRE>
<P>The drug-dealing business has been shown time and again on film in great detail
- it is a business that has shadowed American films as far back as Frank
Sinatra's heroin addiction in "The Man With the Golden Arm." The year 2000 saw
the interminable ugliness of addiction in the tough-as-nails "Requiem for a
Dream" and the futility of the war on drugs in "Traffic." I still must ask this
one question: what else is there to say about drugs at this point that has not
been said? Well, "Blow" is fascinating for detailing how cocaine arrived in the
United States in the first place, and the picture is not pretty in telling it.</P>
<P>"Blow" stars the usually doleful Johnny Depp as George Jung, a drug dealer who
first begins his business by selling marijuana in Venice Beach. He hooks up with
his best friend, the portly Tuna (Ethan Suplee), and his new girlfriend, Barbara
(Franka Potente from "Run Lola Run") at a beach house - they all have no desire
to work real jobs though Barbara is a stewardess. A contact through Barbara, the
effeminate hairdresser Derek (Paul Reubens), helps establish George's business
deal as long as he can be a viable partner. Before you know it, they are
rejoicing in tons of cash and partying with petite, blonde women on the beach.
Deciding to make more money,  George considers extending their business to the
East Coast where there are some eager college students. Thanks to Barbara, she
can fly out there and sell the marijuana for big bucks. Of course, he gets
busted, as he does numerous times in the film and goes to jail.</P>
<P>In jail, he gets wind of the cocaine business in Colombia and George decides
that such a drug would make a killing in the United States. It sure does, and he
makes more money than he ever dreamed. He also has a stunning wife (Penelope
Cruz) who becomes addicted to all the wealth and all the monetary glory. There
is no end to it, but of course all good things must come to an end. Thus,
George's trusted friends become backstabbers, even his own wife. How can such a
business for one man turn itself upside down? Maybe because everyone wants a
piece of the pie and they all want to become versions of George Jung. 
"Blow" is the rise and fall of a cocaine king, a story told countless times
before as in Brian De Palma's jumbled "Scarface." The big difference is that
George got their first, and he is not someone that handles business matters with
machine guns or chainsaws. He is seemingly unaffected by his surroundings and
that is a major flaw for a rise and fall tale like this one. Who is George Jung
really? Does he have any ambitions in life besides cocaine and marijuana? The
only inkling we get of his persona is through his parents (both played by Ray
Liotta and a far too thickly-New York-accented Rachel Griffiths) who want their
son to be successful. Only George's mother does not share her son's enthusiasm
for drugs - she even rats him out in one scene. George's father just wants his
son to be careful, as if the drug business was like any other which it decidedly
is not. Still, as played by Depp, he carries the same doleful expression in
every scene. He has shown far more nuance as Ed Wood or as the book seller in
"The Ninth Gate" than he does here. </P>
<P>Director Ted Demme ("The Ref") borrows stylistic camerawork and editing styles
from "GoodFellas" and "Boogie Nights," using freeze frames and a roving camera
to keep situations flying from one scene to the next. It often works, as does
the dazzling opening sequence where we see how cocaine is made and shipped.  Too
often though, the film gets repetitive and monotonous but it does seem to perk
up occasionally to maintain interest. Still, if you have seen "GoodFellas" or
"Boogie Nights," you have seen this tale before. </P>
<P>"Blow" is largely uneven and inconsistent but it does burst with some magnetism,
and at its core is a sad story of a man who truly had nothing to offer in his
life except drugs. The downbeat ending accentuates the life of a man who had no
inner life and no sign of intelligence - a Forrest Gump of the drug trade. All
we learn is that George simply blew it.   </P>
