<P>   One of the great songs that came out of the sixties is Tom
Lehrer's "Who's Next," which opens thus: "First we got the
bomb, and that was good/ 'Cause we love peace and
motherhood/ Then Russia got the bomb, but that's okay/
'Cause the balance of power's maintained that way/ Who's
next."  Lehrer runs down the powers that have procured
nuclear capability: France, China, and some speculations
including Monaco and Alabama, but failed to mention India
and Pakistan which have both manufactured nuclear
weapons since.  Both powers on the Asian subcontinent
recently tested some of their nuclear wares, causing
commentators to fear an arms race between those two
hostile nations.  In the movie "Earth," Deepa Mehta takes us
to the root of the animosity, doing so with only a small degree
of didacticism for those in the audience whose familiarity with
the period is scant.  What makes "Earth" so intriguing, nay,
riveting, is the way a romantic West Side Story line is
seamlessly infused into a tale of violence situated in the
Eastern Hemisphere and filmed in New Delhi.</P>
<P>   The film's production notes imply that writer-director Deepa
Mehta holds the British largely responsible for the deaths of
one million Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs following the partition
of the Indian subcontinent in August 1947.  She gives the
impression that if the retreating British government simply left
the former colony alone, the various groups would have found
a way to live side by side as they had done by centuries.  
Only when the imperial government decided against the
wishes of such notables as Mahatma Gandhi to split the
predominantly Muslim area in the north (which became
Pakistan) from the mainly Hindu peoples in India, the huge
religious cliques became determined to snatch what land they
could for themselves.  Mehta makes her viewpoint vivid by
organizing his principals to represent the involved sects.  The
stunning Shanta (Nandita Das), a servant in the home of the
wealthy Parsee, Bunty Sethna (Kitu Gidwani), is a Hindu
whose lover of choice is the Muslim Hasan (Rahul Khanna). 
Dil Navaz aka the Ice Candy Man (Aamir Khan), a drop-dead
handsome suitor, is competing for Shanta's hand.  The
actions are viewed through the eyes of eight-year-old Lenny
(Maia Sethna), a Parsee whose semi-autobiographical book
"Cracking India" is the basis of Deepa Mehta's screenplay.  </P>
<P>   As the British prepare to disband in August 1947, they
announce their partition plans just two days in advance, a
scheme which almost immediately leads to raging hostilities
by people who had lived together as friends and neighbors
for centuries.  Sikhs are accused of being the battle arm of
Hindus and become thereby the enemy of the Muslims.  As
Hindus and Muslims alternately demonstrate loudly through
the streets of Pakistan's largest city, Lahore, violence erupts. 
A Hindu tenement in the city is set afire while Muslim
"firemen" pour oil, not water, onto the blaze.  When a train
arrives from the city of Gurdaspur crammed with the dead
bodies of Muslims killed by Hindus, the handsome and
heretofore charming Ice Candy Man vows revenge for the
brutal slaying of his sisters--a pledge that would lead to a
Romeo-and-Juliet style tragedy toward the conclusion of
Mehta's epic tale.</P>
<P>   While the battle scenes are brief, sporadic and filmed with
no great effort to emulate the grand design of Steven
Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan," the emphasis is on the
growing romance between Shanta and the peace-loving and
sincere Hassan.  In a climactic scene, the Hindu and Muslim
principals are witnessed in the act of love by the already
fuming Ice Candy Man, a display that greatly inflames his
already venomous soul.</P>
<P>   While "Earth" has far more in common with the genius of
Satyajit Ray's output than with the current, fluffy turnout of
the Bombay film industry, Mehta throws in a delightful
segment of song and dance led by Shanta--in the tradition of
hundreds of throwaway Indian commercial films.  But
whereas the South Asian country's traditional cinema coyly
shuns even the appearance of kissing, Mehta is not shy
about displaying the act of love, albeit with body parts
discreetly hidden.  </P>
<P>   It's a stretch to say that "Earth" combines the classic theme
of Shakespeare's famous star-crossed lovers with, say, the
combative drama of Henry V.  Yet by weaving romance with
politics so intriguingly, Mehta vividly shows the profound
effect that global and national politics can have on as
personal a tale as an ill-fated attachment between two loving
people.  As India and Pakistan face off this very year in the
ongoing conflict over the status of Kashmir, even
provocatively waving their nuclear arsenals at one another,
we in the audience cannot help thinking of scores of struggles
caused simply because two or more peoples with different
cultures suddenly decide they cannot live together peacefully. 
Never mind what they tell you in high school that Hindus hate
Muslims for eating cows and Muslims reciprocate against the
pork-eating Hindus.  Conflicting dietary restrictions are not the
point.  The essence is that the Creator did not make us all
alike in appearance, cultural values, and modes of religious
veneration.  This should not be a problem under normal
conditions, and even during periods of stress individuals of
different backgrounds can form profound romantic
attachments.  But when political, economic or social changes
threaten to upset stability, watch out.  No other movie to date
this year brings this concept home as well as this one, a
picture that is thrillingly down to "Earth."</P>
