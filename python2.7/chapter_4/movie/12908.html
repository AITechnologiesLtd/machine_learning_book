<PRE>"The Truman Show" - Must See TV</PRE>
<P>One criticism that many have made about today's television shows is that
it contains too little realism.  What we view are gross exaggerations,
lurid sensationalism running wild.  Witness the trashy talk shows, the
nutty soap operas, pay-per-view fiascoes, prime-time wrestling, and "oh
no...they killed Kenny!"  Is that why a show such as Seinfeld was so
popular?  Because they covered topics that seemed so ordinary that they
were downright insightful?  The public clamors for something real to
watch, and they get it in "The Truman Show."</P>
<P>Now in his 30th year, Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) has been the unknowing
star of his own show since he was born.  As he goes about his daily life
and interacts with the city's denizens, thousands of hidden cameras
follow him around, revealing to the audience every little detail of his
life.  Truman has no idea that his life has been carefully planned and
that all the world is a stage.  We're there when he suffers tragedy,
when he takes his first steps, and when he experiments with his first
kiss.  Truman eventually finds his life too comfortable.  An uneasiness
begins to gnaw at him.  The only thing that ever gave him spark was a
brief encounter with a girl whom he met in college who mysteriously
disappeared.  "I'm getting out of here," he exclaims.  But to actually
leave the community would mean the end of the show, and the producer (Ed
Harris) does what he can to keep Truman trapped in his storybook land.</P>
<P>"The Truman Show" is an elegantly constructed movie that explores two
things.  The first is Truman's growing realization that his whole life
has been some sort of masquerade.  He picks up clues here and there such
as the wife that talks like a television commercial, radio channels
whose announcer tells where Truman is heading, and a lifestyle that's
unrealistically harmonious.  He knows that finding his own truth
requires risks.  He is willing to shed his affable nature in search of
adventure.  The more interesting aspect, however, is the debate that
ensues between the producer of the show and a former cast member who
severely questions his ethics and accuses him of deceit and using
technology and media to satiate some kind of twisted appetite of the
public.  Ratings override his sense of humanitarianism, and thus the
direction of the movie soon becomes clear.  Who will win out?  Those
that seek the truth for personal betterment or those that manipulate the
facts in order to stave off change?</P>
<P>Carrey turns in a surprisingly good performance, and shows that he has
the ability to be both a manic comic and a person that can project a
sense of wonderment and awe.  It's easy for us to sympathize with Carrey
and as the movie progresses, we struggle with him and become a part of
his life.  The storytelling quickly draws us in, and we become as
interested as the viewing audience depicted in the movie.  "The Truman
Show" is a unique movie, his journey is immensely satisfying, and Carrey
is engrossing as a man who learns that there's nothing more important
than taking that first step.</P>
