<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>Sometimes, comedy is easy. Romance, sports, teen angst -- these topics 
and others have often been mined for the purpose of making us laugh. 
(Every now and then, it's even done successfully.) Other subjects have 
proved more difficult to capture successfully in a comedy format, 
however. Of these, few have been more elusive than the gangster genre.</P>
<P>"The Whole Nine Yards" is the latest attempt to marry mirth and the mob, 
telling the screwball tale of Nicholas "Oz" Oseransky (Matthew Perry). 
Oseransky's life is less than idyllic: he is trapped in a loveless 
marriage, he's forced to pay off his late father-in-law's enormous debts, 
and he's a dentist. Just when things seem as though they can't get any 
worse, Oz recognizes his new next-door neighbor as Jimmy "The Tulip" 
Tudeski (Bruce Willis), a feared hitman who turned state's evidence 
against Chicago's Gogolack gang and has recently been released from prison.</P>
<P>Oz does his best to ignore the situation, eventually becoming friends 
with Tudeski. But Oz's scheming wife Sophie (Rosanna Arquette) has other 
ideas. She forces him to fly to Chicago to inform mob boss Yanni Gogolack 
(Kevin Pollak, with a hilariously ridiculous accent) as to The Tulip's 
whereabouts and collect a finder's fee, while at the same time telling 
Jimmy what Oz is doing, in the hope that Tudeski will bump off her husband. 
To make matters worse, in Chicago Oz meets Jimmy's wife Cynthia (Natasha 
Henstridge) and instantly falls in love with her. It turns out that she, 
Jimmy and Gogolack have entered into an agreement whereby if two of them 
die, the third gets ten million dollars. It is this deal which drives the 
final two-thirds of the movie, as the different players try to bump each 
other off, and Oz tries to save Cynthia while not losing his own head.</P>
<P>Like most mob comedies, "The Whole Nine Yards" faces the difficult task 
of juxtaposing laughs with the sheer brutality of the gangster 
profession. Some movies deal with this by indulging in the truly bizarre, 
like Tarantino's "Reservoir Dogs". Others simply tone down the violence, 
so that the jokes seem less incongruous. "The Whole Nine Yards" does 
neither, and the result is a somewhat uncomfortable viewing experience. I 
found it difficult at times to laugh at the sitcom-level humor of the 
film, immediately after seeing four men blown away in a hail of gunfire.</P>
<P>Neither of the principals really seems to embrace the material, perhaps 
themselves uncertain how to reconcile the movie's plot with its comedic 
intentions. Willis looks like he's cruising in neutral as Tudeski. While 
The Tulip is given a number of interesting personality traits, they never 
really come together to form a convincing, complete individual. Perry's 
Oz is basically just his Chandler Bing character from the TV series 
"Friends" transplanted to a different milieu; even some of the vocal 
mannerisms are identical. He's likeable enough as a sympathetic Ordinary 
Joe caught up in events beyond his control, but just doesn't have the 
on-screen presence to really absorb the viewer into his plight.</P>
<P>Better are the supporting characters, particularly Amanda Peet as Jill St 
Claire, Oz's receptionist who harbors secrets of her own. Peet clearly 
relishes her role, and her electrifying performance helps her steal 
scenes from the more tepid Willis and Perry. Star of the TV sitcom "Jack 
and Jill", Peet appears to be a comedy star on the rise. Michael Clarke 
Duncan also has fun as Frankie Figs, one of Tudeski's hitman confreres.</P>
<P>"The Whole Nine Yards" is set for the most part in Montréal, and is 
attractively photographed. Surprisingly, though, it takes little 
advantage of the Francophone milieu. The movie is liberally sprinkled 
with the French language (and Arquette sports a grotesquely exaggerated 
Québecois accent), but virtually none of the humor arises from the unique 
culture, beyond a running gag about hamburgers and mayonnaise. This is 
unfortunate; were the comedy to arise more naturally from the film's 
situations and surroundings, instead of resorting to routine one-liners 
and pratfalls, I think I would have found the violent aspects of the plot 
less jarring and easier to swallow.</P>
<P>Like last year's "Analyze This", "The Whole Nine Yards" is an only 
partially-successful mob comedy. It has its moments, especially when Peet 
is involved, but the time between laughs is often lengthy, and many of 
the jokes just don't pack much of a punch, especially when paired with 
the violence of the gangster lifestyle. This is a film which desperately 
needs to eschew the conventions of the sitcom format and more wholly 
embrace its subject material. In essence, instead of falling back on a 
tired comedy format, "The Whole Nine Yards" needs to go the whole nine yards.</P>
