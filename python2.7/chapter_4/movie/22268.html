<P>"House on Haunted Hill" initializes itself to the audience with a scene
involving zombie-like mental patients attacking and murdering doctors in the
goriest ways possible. One doctor is killed instantly after having a pencil
rammed completely through his neck. A nurse has her head forced into a barrel
of water. These mobs of zombies presented are like those in previous B-horror
flicks, with grunting noises and cadaverous movements. Except this time, at the
end of the millenium, the film is given the power to show exactly how horrific
these creatures can be. In past horror films, the actual murder scenes are left
out or not shown forcing the viewer to assume their own nasty bloody deaths for
the hapless victims. "House on Haunted Hill" doesn't want their audience to
have an imagination, everything is provided for them to watch and squirm, not
think. This nonsense violence thrown out of nowhere is unfortunately the most
refreshing part about this film.
        "House on Haunted Hill", which is based on the 1958 film of the same title,
introduces a handful of characters as quickly as it can, following the opening
blood fest. The film has no intention of providing character development or a
laudable plot. The aim here is to scare the audience with chilling, unexpected
shots of blood, guts, and mayhem. However, the film is neither scary nor
unpredictable. The plot involves five people who are dared to spend the night
in a haunted house for one million dollars by an amusement park owner (Geoffrey
Rush). Each character is a failure in the external world and acknowledges that
they would do anything for that money. Since the characters are immediately
generalized as either greedy or caring, the expectations of who will survive or
not is killed five minutes after you meet them. The problem is that every
character is not likable. The two who come closest to being civilized are a
womanizer (Taye Diggs - who should be doing films a lot better than this with
all of his talent) and a businesswoman who accepts being womanized (Ali
Larter).  The characters presented are so annoying and pathetic, that it is
hard to cheer for them or scream them. The worst character in this film, or
maybe in any film released this year, is Chris Kattan's Watson Pritchett. He
spends the whole film whining about the spooky house in a tone so irritating
and inappropriate, that he unintentionally begins to seem more evil than the
house itself. Waiting for Pritchett to die, was a strenuously difficult act to
sit through. The most humorous actor of the bunch is Geoffrey Rush playing
Steven Price (an homage to Victor Price who starred in the original). Playing
the rich man who supposedly organized the party, he plays the role perfectly in
a twisted way where it is obvious that he is up to something just by the
expressions on his face. However, Rush is pretty much wasted in a confusing
subplot involving a hateful marriage with Evelyn Price , played by Famke
Janssen. 
        The main problem is that "House on Haunted Hill" is not scary. To top off that
huge disappointment, every actor was wasted and the script was completely
ludicrous.  If the annoying characters and hilariously bad dialogue were
intentionally underdeveloped (similar to "Deep Blue Sea"), the goal for
creating a creepy, suspenseful action film was completely missed.</P>
