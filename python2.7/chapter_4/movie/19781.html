<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>There is something about this chic look at modern English society- one
that is filled with wanton sex, drugs, and violence- that is more
frightening than all the mayhem, perversities, muggings, and rapes it
shows on screen. I think that something has to do with the fear we have
of trusting the young people depicted in the film with the future of the
country. Kubrick moralistically seems to be pointing his finger at the
pillars of the community and at the politicians who are clueless about
what to do about the violence that is seen on an everyday basis, in a
society that appears to be a nihilistic one, where crimes are mainly
committed by youths;  he questions  society's responses to deterring
crime in general: by social reform, organized religion, scientific
experiments, political meddling (from the Right and the Left), and by
making prisons as a solution to society's problems.</P>
<P>That Clockwork Orange  has stood the test of time and is as relevant
seeing in 1999 as it was when it first came out, is a sign that society
has not changed much since that time and that the film has opened up
some skeletons in our closet about how we as a society still can't face
the severity of the problems manifested.</P>
<P>The film is shot in such pleasingly stylish colors, especially the
orange background, whereby the film gets its title from. It is so
visually splendid a film, that it is shameful that we are confronted
with so much violence, as it seems that even the violence as presented
and choreographed is all too entertaining for the grim message it is
trying to deliver. One might be beguiled into expecting a musical film
to be taking place, if one were not aware that Kubrick was the director.</P>
<P>The droogs (McDowell, Clarke, Marcus, & Tarn) as they call themselves,
are sitting in their favorite Korova milk bar hang-out, drinking their
drug-spiked milk and surrounded by white-fiber glass nude furniture and
statues of submissive women kneeling. They are wearing white trousers
and white suspenders to match, with black combat boots and derbies, and
have billyclubs at their sides. Every night, they commit stylized but
meaningless acts of terrorism. Their feeling is that they can take
whatever they want by force. Sex is the old in-and-out thing; if they
want an auto they just steal it, and for someone they don't like, they
just pummel them. These school-age kids do not necessarily come from bad
homes- so why are they so alienated from society, is the million dollar
question.</P>
<P>In the first part of the film, we see a drunken bum (Paul Farrell) get
beaten up for being a bum; a choreographed gang fight; a vicious rape
(Adrienne Corri) and the paralysing of her writer husband (Patrick
Magee); the slaying, with a giant phallus artifact, of a wealthy elitist
woman (Karlin), known as the Catlady, who runs a health farm; and the
fighting for control of the gang among its four members.</P>
<P>The gang leader, Alex de Large (McDowell), lives at the graffiti- ridden
Municipal Flatblock 18a Linear North with his trendy older mum (Sheila
Raynor), sporting purple-dyed hair, and his working-class dadda (Philip
Stone), who do not know how to get Alex properly motivated for school.
The school advisor (Aubrey) is an obvious homosexual, who can't relate
very well to the troubled Alex. Music, in the form of Ludwig Van
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, arouses Alex's love for sex and violence. It
is his theme in life, the very joy of his existence, the inspiration for
his perverse dreams. The other piece of music that plays a large role in
Alex's life, is 'Singin' In The Rain,' which he triumphantly sings
during the rape and is played as the credits roll down at the film's
conclusion, when Alex is supposedly cured; that is, he is able to have
his violent sexual fantasies again.</P>
<P>In this rather cynical and probing look at societal attitudes and what
can only be termed as a dehumanized society that Kubrick sees all around
him, the harshest comments are reserved for the scientific experiments
conducted on Alex, so that he will be conditioned out of his criminal
impulses, where he is serving his fourteen year prison sentence for the
murder of the Catlady. His fellow droogs Georgie (Marcus ) and Dim
(Clarke), upset with his bullying them around, turn the tables on him
and conk him over the head with a milk bottle on that escapade, enabling
the police to get him.</P>
<P>The "experimental therapy" treatment Alex agrees to, that gives the
convicted killer a chance for an early release, is backed by the new
right- wing government in power, as the Machiavellian Minister of the
Interior (Sharp) worms his way into the headlines, hypocritically
claiming that his adminstration will put a stop to the criminal by
controlling his thoughts. When a bad thought comes up, the patient will
experience a severe sick reaction which stops him from doing anything
bad.</P>
<P>Alex reenters society a so-called "changed" man with a physical aversion
to the following: sex, Beethoven's Ninth, and violence. There is a
strong enough reaction to these things to induce a nausea in him. But he
quickly learns that he cannot go back home, that he must pay for his bad
deeds, and in his new journey he re-acquaints himself with that past.
The same bum he once attacked, now gets other bums to rough him up, the
police who help him from this attack are his former cronies Dim and
Georgie, who now take him out into the woods and work him over,
explaining his surprise at their current occupation, by telling him they
are now of age to have such jobs. By mistake, he enters the house of the
writer he once attacked, and will be used by that writer's left-wing
group for political revenge against the government they can't stand.
They get Alex to try and commit suicide to the constant playing of
Beethoven's Ninth. Alex survives his fall with broken bones and the
renewed friendship with the minister, who descries that former
treatment, blaming the doctors who experimented on him for their foolish
plan. Meanwhile he arrests the writer as a political subversive, and
re-conditions Alex to be like before. He does all this so that his party
can keep being in power.</P>
<P>Kubrick's look at society is an unduly pessimistic one. There is
something evil in society, but what to do about it, that is the question
that remains. At least, for Kubrick, we better think about what we are
doing to ourselves, before it is too late. The most frightening part of
the film, was that all the extremes of violence and cultural debasement,
are pretty close to what the norms of society actually are.</P>
<P>I was left feeling unsure of how to take the film's message. Was there a
moral ambiguity exhibited toward the violence? Or, is Kubrick, as a
moralist, pointing his finger at everybody? There just doesn't seem to
be much to think about as alternatives to the way the problem youth was
handled. The film adaption from Anthony Burgess' satiric novel, results
in a pure Kubrick over-indulgent, brilliantly visual and graphic film.
The jargonistic language used (called Nadsat- an onomatopoetic
combination of English, Russian, and slang) made for a most arresting
film, one that can't be put aside without thinking about what kind of
impact it makes on how we view such moral and ethical problems. But I
just don't think we come away knowing anything more about what to do
about these problems than before seeing the film. Nevertheless, I did
find it to be a visual joyride, something that is terrifyingly pertinent
in an eerie sort of way; a memorable film, one that has become ingrained
in our culture and must be looked upon as one of those 'important' films
that one should see. I just didn't think it reached the level of some of
his other masterpieces (2001, Paths of Glory, The Killing, Eyes Wide
Shut, and Dr. Strangelove), that, for me, were on more solid
intellectual footing.</P>
