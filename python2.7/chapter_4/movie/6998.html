<PRE>CODE BORING</PRE>
<P>In RANSOM, Mel Gibson and Rene Russo lose their son to a handful of
grungy kidnappers in Central Park and spend the rest of the movie
trying to get him back.</P>
<P>Gibson plays Tom Mullen, a Self-Made Airline Millionaire who's a bit
of a publicity hound, and Rene Russo, who is possibly the only
Hollywood actress capable of smouldering with a huge black bruise on
her temple, is his wife, Kate. While attending a Junior Science
competition in the park, junior Mullen (played by Nick Nolte's real
life son, Brawley) himself disappears and not much later, the Mullen
parents receive a ransom voice message, with a digitized film image
of their son taped and handcuffed, through email.</P>
<P>That's about the coolest and most interesting part of the film, other
than a nice bit at the end involving a lot of cut glass sticking out
of the kidnapper's throat in a police showdown. Director Ron Howard
takes us through the movements of the kidnapping with a good sense of
pace, throwing in a number of nice suspenseful moments, and even
introduces a Plot Twist that I suppose would be exciting if I (and
probably you too) didn't already know was going to happen from
watching the million trailers that have been running in entertainment
previews and the theatres.</P>
<P>Mullen sets out intending to pay the $2 million-dollar ransom
demanded, but a botched exchange situation (mostly due to the
over-eager FBI swat team that always botches things up in films like
these) soon convinces him that the kidnappers actually don't intend
to return his son at all. In a dramatic turn of events, he reverses
his decision and makes use of the one weapon that has served him well
in previous battles--publicity--to combat the kidnappers. Actually
it's only just that one Head Kidnapper who keeps in contact with
Mullen, and with whom Mullen develops an intensely personal,
adversarial relationship.</P>
<P>Eventually, though, things take the expected turn of events. If you
don't believe me, ask yourself these questions and see if you don't
think you already know the answers: will the Mullen son return safely
to the fold? Are the bad guys ultimately made to Pay For Their
Crimes? Will Ron Howard continue to make moving, powerfully emotional
human drama-type of films that make for Gripping Box Office
Successes?</P>
<P>RANSOM is a pretty OK film for S$7, mostly because director Ron
Howard does a good job of keeping the suspense up and there are some
genuinely likable bits in it. There's good dramatic support from both
the kidnapper and FBI-agent posses (played by Delroy Lindo, Lili
Taylor, Gary Sinise, Liev Schreiber, Evan Handler and Donnie
Wahlberg) that keep vigil on either side throughout the entire ordeal
(although there really isn't that much of a difference between either
side; as it turns out, they're all Basically Good People except for
the Evil Brains of the Outfit).  There are also number of nice
cinematographic points made by photographer Piotr Sobocinski, who
beautifully photographed RED.</P>
<P>In the end, though, RANSOM is just boring. The kind of film that
delivers everything it's supposed to, but makes you wonder why it
chose to be that kind of film in the first place. Mel Gibson, whose
face is even blander than Duncan Watt's on a bad day, dutifully runs
the gamut of emotions from determined to almost deranged parent, and
Rene Russo is charming as ever in her frantic, fragile disarray.
Still, watch this in the theatres only if you're into a jazzed-up,
fancifully rendered "Code Red" with production values beyond the
dreams of lowly TCS producers. Otherwise, turn up Jonathan Lim and
wait for the LD to come out.</P>
<P>Rebecca Wan enjoys "Code Red" because it is just like real life, only on
TV. She once kidnapped a relative's top but had to give it back almost
at once when a drastic cutting off of allowance was threatened. All in
all, it wasn't so different from RANSOM.</P>
