<PRE>                          JOSH AND S.A.M.
                   A film review by John Walker
                    Copyright 1993 John Walker</PRE>
<PRE>My form of "rating": I saw this first at matinee price--but to get
     there, I had to take time off from work.  Since I've used up
     leave time, I took leave without pay.  I don't really want to
     think what it works out to, but I figure *it was worth it*.
     I'll try to see it again this week at the (far cheaper for me)
     full rate.  If I can't, it'll be LWOP rates again for another
     matinee.  And I'll buy the video when it comes out.</PRE>
<PRE>                            <<In brief>></PRE>
<P>     "Expectations" may be an obsession of mine, but I'll say it:  *If
you can park virtually every expectation at the door*, this will be a
flick that can become addictive.</P>
<P>     It will hit you on more levels than most three other movies.  It's
a romp--the sort of thing lots of us wanted to do as kids--screw
everything, grab a car, and beat it for the border.  It's an
adventure--where the stakes are high, and the hero must play everything
right or face disaster.  It's a comedy--where adults are somewhat
silly, and two kids create their own universe.  It's sort of like a
horror story, but without magic or the supernatural--where the demons
are utterly ordinary people doing ordinary sorts of things.  And it's a
morality play--where the hero has to face himself and his own actions.</P>
<P>     But if you can't park the expectations, you may very well hit a
wall with this film.  Others have.</P>
<PRE>                            <<The story>></PRE>
<P>     Josh (Jacob Tierney), a 12-year-old or so, and Sam (Noah Fleiss),
8 or so, are brothers.  Their parents (Stephen Tobolowsky and Joan
Allen) are divorced.  Sam is sweet kid, a natural jock, and bright--but
withdrawn.  The other kids call him "Robot" and "Alien".  Josh is one
of those kids who has given the word "hacker" a bad name.  Besides the
usual computer stuff, he duplicates credit-card magnetic strips to use
the accounts of his mother's boyfriend.</P>
<P>     Josh also lies a lot.  After the kids get sent to the father's for
the end of the summer, Josh's opening gambit (besides previous stories
about the boyfriend) is to tell Sam that he (Sam) is really a
Strategically Altered Mutant (S.A.M.), and to generate documents to
"prove" it.  Sam believes it--and the further lies that he's set to
be sold to the Pentagon to be a child warrior and that his only hope is
to escape to Canada.</P>
<P>     When the two are going to be suddenly shuttled back to Mom for a
farewell because she's leaving for Europe and dumping them with Dad for
a year, Josh embarks on still further lies, that lead to mistaken/fake
identity, and a crunch where he has to kill a violent drunk (Chris
Penn).  (At least Josh thinks he's killed him; he can't find a pulse.)</P>
<PRE>     By the way, have I said that Josh is the *hero*?!</PRE>
<P>     In any event, now they *both* have reason to clear the territory.
They steal the drunk's rental car and make their move.  Along the way,
they'll pick up a friendly hitch-hiker, Alison (Martha Plimpton).  But
it ain't gonna be smooth sailing.</P>
<PRE>                    <<Some other points of view>></PRE>
<P>     When I talk to anyone about a movie, I try to think of two things:
what did I go through in seeing the flick, and what do I think other
people will do.  I'd like to flag things things that I think others
have missed, either to warn people of a negative *before* they go, or
to point out something that might be attractive.</P>
<P>     Before I saw JOSH AND S.A.M., I had signals from two quarters:  1)
Stanley Drew Rosenbaum (<A HREF="mailto:rosenbau@ucsu.Colorado.EDU">rosenbau@ucsu.Colorado.EDU</A>); and 2) the reviews
of a) James Berardinelli (<A HREF="mailto:blake7@cc.bellcore.com">blake7@cc.bellcore.com</A>) and b) Scott Renshaw,
Stanford University (<A HREF="mailto:AS.IDC@forsythe.stanford.edu">AS.IDC@forsythe.stanford.edu</A> (IDC Database)).</P>
<PRE>                      <<More than just a romp>></PRE>
<P>     Rosenbaum seemed to be describing JOSH AND S.A.M. as what I'd call
"a romp"--fun, plain and simple.  (I refer you to "The JOSH and
S.A.M. Audience Participation Guide 1.2" rec.arts.movies thread, among
others.)</P>
<P>     Well, I'd give a note of caution there.  (I'd caution you about
doing the Guide's "vocal" parts in a first-run theater!)  After the
movie jelled, I was wired throughout it.  It wasn't simply a nifty
comedy.  For me, it was an adventure.</P>
<P>     The only image I have is that it was like falling onto a sled in
winter and going down a totally new hill.  In one sense, you're in
complete control: turn left, turn right, shift your weight here, drag
your foot just a little bit there, the sled goes where you tell it.
But there are rocks and trees everywhere, and you can't see very far
ahead.</P>
<P>     The one thing you can never do is *stop*.  Try, and body parts
will be decorating the landscape.  All you can do is hope that the
trail you're making doesn't go off a ledge somewhere, or smack into a
dead-end rock.</P>
<PRE>     That's the situation Josh finds himself in.</PRE>
<P>     One test of a movie is whether my attention wanders, whether I
think of other stuff while it's running.  Two ideas came up, one right
after another--only a few times, and JOSH AND S.A.M.  immediately got
my attention again.  The *second* thing was "What's gonna happen?!
How's it gonna *end*!?"  I could only see terror and disaster.  That is
*not* what I think of during a light comedy!  (Maybe I have a problem
with getting into films too easily.)</P>
<P>     So, I think I'll use the Guide for *later* viewings, when I'm not
so wired.  (Let it be noted, however, that if I go to a theater that
sells hot dogs, it will be positively disloyal not to buy one or two!
Candy bars just won't cut it.  Also, the half-pepperoni, half-pineapple
pizza *has* acquired a permanent significance.  It has only a small
role in the film, but I will nonetheless concede to Rosenbaum that it
must now be regarded as a cultural icon!)</P>
<PRE>                       <<Accepting a premise>></PRE>
<P>     But I said that my fear of the end was the *second* thing--what
was the first?  It was "they [meaning: lots of you folks] are *not*
gonna believe this."  The closest I could come to finding a neutral
term to describe why was "a pervasive air of unreality".  And I don't
like that term, because in some sense, this film is completely
realistic--after you concede *one* premise.</P>
<P>     Although I disagree with their conclusions, I have to thank both
Berardinelli and Renshaw for stating the real problem very clearly:</P>
<P>Berardinelli:
>How much are you willing to suspend your disbelief?  In the answer to
>that question lies the degree to which you'll buy into the underlying
>premise of JOSH AND S.A.M, and how much you will therefore enjoy it.</P>
<P>Renshaw:
>     Every once in a while, I come upon a movie where I simply can't
>get beyond the basic premise; as well as certain individual elements
>might be executed, I'm so turned off by that premise that I can't
>possibly enjoy the film.</P>
<P>     (Note: I want to thank them both for stating the real problem.
Too few reviewers in the general press warn us of the decisions *we*
make that can radically alter our perception of a film.  However, now
I'm going to go into what *I* think the root premises of JOSH AND
S.A.M. are.  I don't want to imply that I'm representing what
*Berardinelli or Renshaw* view as the premises.)</P>
<P>     To some extent, I think there are *at least* two premises involved
in people's perception of JOSH AND S.A.M., but they will both stick in
the craw for some people.</P>
<P>     The *false* premise, as far as I can see, is to view Josh and Sam
as poor-little-abused-kids, or poor-little-disturbed-kids.  To mix
comedy with such kids is unacceptable: "poor-little-abused-or-
disturbed-kids never have a nice day."</P>
<P>     Well, first, that's *false* about kids in trouble in the real
world.  Humor is sometimes what keeps them *alive*.  Presenting *both*
the humorous aspects *and* the abuse can make a film a lot truer than
keeping each in its own tidy little niche.</P>
<P>     Regardless of that, however, it's *false* about the film.  The
screenplay (by Frank Deese) has to walk a very fine line, and does so.
Josh and Sam are neither abused nor disturbed--at least no more so
than lots of the rest of us.</P>
<P>     Yes, the mother seems too self-concerned.  Yes, the boyfriend
seems like a Continental lounge lizard.  Yes, the father is a bit of a
jerk.  Yes, his two stepsons are dumb and smug and worse jerks.  Yes,
Josh and Sam have both coped poorly with the breakup, Josh by
withdrawing into computers and lying and petty larceny, Sam by
withdrawing into himself except to get into fights.</P>
<P>     *None of those are neat things*, and the screenplay does not pass
them off as trivial.  They're real.  For Josh and Sam, they could
develop into *major* problems, and right now the parents are doing
*nothing* constructive.  But those problems are not yet the stuff of
high melodrama--sympathy and concern, yes, but not pegging Josh and
Sam as basket cases or everyone else as creeps.  No matter how lousy
their situations are, many kids go through similar things--*most*
pull out of them before things become a disaster.  Yes, some don't, and
maybe Josh and Sam were turning into two who wouldn't.  But that point
hadn't been reached yet.</P>
<P>     (If either Josh or Sam is a bona fide basket case, we shouldn't
even *think* about what many average kids are--much less the average
USENET reader!)</P>
<PRE>                      <<When lies come "true">></PRE>
<P>     But there's another premise, and it's this one I think that gives
JOSH AND S.A.M. an air of unreality.  It's remarkably simple.</P>
<P>     Josh is a liar, right?  He can tell his mother lies about her
boyfriend; she ignores him.  But when he once tells Sam that Sam is a
mutant, the lying game changes.  Sam *believes* him.  Why?  Because it
*fits*.  He's really got a lot of electronics inside?  It explains
*everything*.  Why he feels cold inside, why the other kids think he's
an alien, a robot, why he thinks about being dead.</P>
<P>     You and I can see those as the result of his not being able to
handle the breakup.  But for Sam, that's just how he *feels*.  Now he's
got an *explanation*.  (Do you remember when it seemed entirely
plausible that if you swallowed an orange seed, it would sprout into a
tree in your stomach?  Or lots of comparable ideas?)</P>
<P>     With further lies, the same thing will happen to Josh again:
people will *believe* him.  The film establishes clearly that Josh's
lies--*for the people he tells them to*--will be *plausible*, even
*wanted*.  Worse, when he tries to call a lie back, they won't believe
him; they'll have too much invested in the belief.  Or they'll be out
for revenge at being betrayed.  He will have to follow the lie out to
its end--even if it means apparently killing someone.</P>
<P>     Josh tells a series of lies that leads to that event--after
that, the escape.</P>
<PRE>                        <<Calling up demons>></PRE>
<P>     Now, I've said that Josh's lies will be believed.  What if they
would be *real*?  What sort of a story would we have then?  We'd have a
story line that goes back to Midas and underlies any number of horror
stories: What you *say* (want, ask for, etc.) becomes *real*--the
protagonist calls the demon into being and must thereupon destroy it or
be destroyed.  JOSH AND S.A.M. is a non-magical, utterly "realistic"
working out of the same idea.</P>
<P>     *That* strikes me as the root premise of JOSH AND S.A.M..  If
you're willing to accept that premise, JOSH AND S.A.M. can be a romp or
an adventure, but the events of the story do *not* thereafter require
any great suspension of disbelief.</P>
<P>     The premise itself doesn't seem to be that strange.  It's starkly
simple.  It's a traditional staple of literature dealing with the
supernatural.  What's so wrong with giving a perfectly naturalistic
interpretation?  It's been used in comedy.  And haven't we seen small
cases like it in real life?</P>
<P>     Of course, maybe we'd rather not think too closely about what it
would be like if everything we *said* were believed or actually came
true!</P>
<PRE>                  <<Dealing with the consequences>></PRE>
<P>     But conceding the premise can do more than simply allow us to
enjoy a romp or and adventure.  It also opens up a further layer of
meaning.  Josh has to deal with the consequences of his words.  And his
habit of casual lying can no longer be casual.  Now, even if *must*
lie, he has to realize that his words have consequences.  It's no
longer a game.</P>
<P>     When Sam buys into the S.A.M. lie so completely, Josh realizes how
cruel he's been--to someone who has never done anything to him.  Josh
has to face the fact that Sam is a nice sweet kid that he's been
jealous of because Sam can do things that he finds next to impossible.</P>
<P>     The movie, then, is to some extent more about Josh than Sam
because Josh created the lies, and must work them out.  Sam's working
out of the lies is his own journey, too, but it's also under Josh's
tutelage.  (I would like to write something strictly from Sam's
perspective, but, let's face it, this review is already *huge*!)</P>
<PRE>                             <<Alison?>></PRE>
<P>     Seeing JOSH AND S.A.M. as a morality play eases one criticism that
some have made.  The hitch-hiker--Alison--has been seen as a
possible romantic interest for Josh.  But nothing is made of it.  Why
is her character given short shrift?</P>
<P>     Well, first, Josh is *12*!  Alison, is *at least* 20-something,
and has had a *lot* of hard time.  She's far from bonkers, but she's
not totally with us when she shows up, and it's dealing with Josh and
Sam that brings her closer to reality.</P>
<P>     If this were a simple coming-of-age flick, then, yes, she'd be
important for the possible romantic interest, even as "the older
woman".  But if it's *not*, if it's really Josh's dealing with the
demons he's called into being, then her role is radically
different--and probably parallel to Josh's.</P>
<P>     Sorry, going further would take up too much space--and go right
into spoiler territory.</P>
<PRE>                     <<*My* one real criticism>></PRE>
<PRE>     So, did I like absolutely *everything*?</PRE>
<P>     I had one disappointment: The scene where Josh's lies produce the
mistaken/fake identity.  This was the one place where I think JOSH AND
S.A.M. was trying for stock comedy.</P>
<P>     The comic scene reminded me of "I Love Lucy" shows where Lucy was
digging herself in deeper.  Now, I happen to know that lots and lots of
people think such scenes are funny.  When I watched "Lucy" as a kid,
they drove me up a wall.  I'd cover my ears and scratch my head until
the scene was over.  (Hey--no remote control--no mute!) Very little
got through the noise.  Just enough so I'd know it was safe to listen
again.</P>
<PRE>     Sorry, gang, I *still* can't stand that form of humor.</PRE>
<PRE>                           <<The acting>></PRE>
<P>     It's embarrassing, but I've been so wrapped up in the story that I
haven't mentioned the actors.  In that regard, I get the impression
that I can safely refer you to practically anybody for an opinion.
People may criticize the film, but the acting seems totally beyond
criticism.  Tierney and Fleiss are simply excellent.</P>
<P>The thing that sort of shocked me was that I felt they were *real
kids*!  Somehow, actors always look like actors to me.  Maybe it's just
a pervasive air of unreality to all movies.  I just don't think I'll
meet the people on the screen when I go outside the theater.</P>
<P>     With Tierney and Fleiss, it was like two kids from outside had
somehow gotten on screen.  The acting doesn't come across as acting:
they just do things, and it happens to be on screen.  I never once got
the idea that one of them was going too far or not far enough; there
weren't any wrong notes.  I wasn't watching either one of them play a
role; I was just seeing them in situations.  How much of that is their
own talent, how much is the result of careful cultivation by the
director (Billy Weber), I don't know.  But it was there.</P>
<P>     It might well be that their unstoppable realism nullified any
hesitations I might have had about the story's reality.</P>
<PRE>                 <<Break out the hot dogs & pizza!>></PRE>
<P>     So, where does all this leave us?  Well, note what I said about
"Lucy."  Some of you like, some dislike "Lucy," some make a cult of it,
some hate it.  It would be fascinating to figure out why.  (I once saw
an article that cheerfully posited "Lucy" and "Gilligan's Island" as
symbolizing the great social/cultural divide of contemporary history.
I think I agree.)</P>
<P>     Regardless of the explanation or lack thereof, our preferences are
a fact.  Some will just not be able to get into the basic premise(s) of
JOSH AND S.A.M..  The question is the one I indicated at the very
beginning: *Can you park virtually every expectation at the door?*</P>
<P>     If you can't, you may very well hit a wall.  But if you *can*, I
think JOSH AND S.A.M. will pay off.  This is one film where our
expectations, our demand for something to fit into preconceived niches,
is the real objection.  JOSH AND S.A.M. doesn't just break a niche or
two, it obliterates them.  It creates it own, and gives you multiple
layers to explore.</P>
<PRE>     See it!  And don't forget the hot dogs!</PRE>
<PRE>     By the way, I concur with Rosenbaum's pizza advisory in the
Guide:</PRE>
<PRE>>       Before or after the movie don't forget to go out and get a 
>       1/2 Pepperoni
>       1/2 Pineapple pizza and be sure to eat it outside.
>       with root beers.
>       Preferably after the movie so you can reminisce.</PRE>
<P>a) Ya gotta have someone to talk it over with.  And b) even if the
theater management doesn't object, pizza is a mess to eat in the
dark!</P>
<PRE>         <<"Parental advisory" with something of a spoiler>></PRE>
<PRE>an ending spoiler, more or less</PRE>
<P>     I wonder whether some of you may be thinking that this is *not*
the thing young minds should be exposed to.  We have a larcenous liar
who's cruel to his brother.  They heist a car, pick up a babe, and make
for the border.  Since you've probably assumed (correctly) that it has
a happy ending, that means that Josh gets off scot-free.  Lie through
your teeth, do credit-card fraud, steal cars, and you, too, can become
a cult-hero for it!</P>
<PRE>     Yeah, just what we want kids to think!  (Insert irony symbol.)</PRE>
<P>     Well, we don't know he gets off absolutely scot-free.  But it's
the most plausible explanation.</P>
<P>     But when you see it as a morality tale, then it all fits.  The
only way he realizes how down his brother is, is by seeing him buy what
started out as just one of his snotty tricks.  *Then* he sees that
they're cruel, and not just wiseguy stuff.</P>
<P>     Further, the whole journey becomes one of Josh's trying to get Sam
*out* of the lie.  He can't let Sam go on alone.  Nothing else counts.
Moreover, he comes to realize that his lies can't just be withdrawn.
"I'm sorry" doesn't cut it.  He has to face the fact that he put Sam in
the lie, and he has to go in and get him out.  That's his first task.
His own safety comes second.  (Note that the reason he's really in
jeopardy is because he had to protect Sam from getting hit by the
drunk.)  All the other lies are beasts/demons that must be defeated on
their own turf, not just disappeared by admitting he lied.</P>
<P>     None of this is laid on with a trowel.  There's no card at the end
giving the moral of the tale.  The moral (or morals) is (or are) there
nonetheless, sometimes explicitly (as when Josh tells Sam about
forgiveness), sometimes implicitly (as when the lies turn out to mean
more to others than they mean to him).</P>
<P>     Admittedly, a little preaching might be better for younger kids.
But it would be a turn-off for almost everyone else.  But with this
review in hand, you at least have fuel for a little discussion of your
own.</P>
<P>     True, there's always the chance you'll notice your 12-year-old
going over road maps and casting lusting eyes on the family
conveyance.  If so, the only thing I can say is that he was probably
doing so beforehand.  Now, (since presumably you, too, will have seen
the movie) you will at least be alert to the warning signs!</P>
