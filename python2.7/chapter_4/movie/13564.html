<PRE>An American in Paris (1951)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 59</PRE>
<P>I don't understand it, myself.  Since "Singin' in the Rain" is
the greatest musical of all time, how come "An American in
Paris", made just the year prior, and also featuring Gene
Kelly, is not nearly as good?  How can a film that has
received so much acclaim over the years be such a letdown?</P>
<P>I have often criticized films that have too much action
and not enough content.  The same criticism can sometimes
be applied to art films; in this case, too much ballet
and not enough content.</P>
<P>"An American in Paris" does have a plot.  A love story,
of course, that thinly winds its way through numerous
lengthy production numbers.  An ex-GI painter (Gene Kelly)
is living (and struggling) in Paris.  A wealthy socialite
(Nina Foch) promotes his career, but seems more
interested in his body.  Kelly falls for chipmunk-cheeked
Leslie Caron, who is engaged to stage performer Georges
Guetary.  Unemployed pianist Oscar Levant is the laconic
mutual friend of Kelly and Guetary.</P>
<P>Undoubtedly, Kelly was an outstanding actor, dancer, and
choreographer.  But perhaps the envelope was pushed too
far in "An American in Paris".  Comparing with two Kelly
vehicles that I admire, "Singin' in the Rain" and "Take
Me Out to the Ball Game", both had better storylines,
and better supporting casts.</P>
<P>It is possible that since I don't have knowledge of European
culture, that I can't appreciate songs about German composers,
and lacking an understanding of ballet, I can't appreciate
eighteen minute ballet sequences.  But I enjoyed the
production numbers from the aforementioned Kelly vehicles.
The magic doesn't work here, perhaps because the numbers
fill up most of the movie, perhaps because Caron is only
perfunctory, or perhaps Donald O'Connor and even Frank Sinatra
are missed.  Perhaps because Guetary sings like Al Jolson,
while Levant appears about to fall asleep.</P>
<P>In any event, "An American in Paris" received more Oscars
than any other Kelly vehicle.  Awards were won for Best
Picture, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Costume
Design, Best Music and somehow even Best Writing.  There
were no nominations for acting, but Vincente Minnelli was
up for Best Director.</P>
