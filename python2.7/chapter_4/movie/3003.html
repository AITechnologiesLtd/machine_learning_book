<PRE>                             RADIOLAND MURDERS
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Director Mel Smith has the top-rated TV comedy show in Great
Britain but if this frantic comedy is to be taken as an indication of
his directorial abilities, he had better stick to comedic acting.</P>
<P>     Given a superb cast with which to work he failed to utilize their
abilities, instead employing what appears to be a scatter shot approach
with hysterical non-stop running around in circles to the point where
it leaves the audience exhausted; somewhere in the film you have to
slow down for a moment so when the pace picks up again it is noted and
appreciated.  This just becomes tiresome, seeming longer than its 112
minutes running time.</P>
<P>     To see what could have been accomplished, let us just list the
cast: Mary Stuart Masterson, Brian Benben, Ned Beatty, George Burns,
Scott Michael Campbell, Brion James, Michael Lerner, Michael McKean,
Jeffrey Tambor, Stephen Tobolowsky and Christopher Lloyd.  With few
exceptions, it was a waste of talent.</P>
<P>     Smaller roles included Harvey Korman, Robert Klein, Bo Hoskins,
Billy Barty, Bobcat Goldthwait, Corbin Bernsen and Rosemary Clooney,
among others.</P>
<P>     The story, in brief:  In the olden days of pre-TV, millions of
people tuned in their radios each night to comedy, mystery and
romance.  In addition to the three major radio networks, a fourth one
is making its debut.  While out in the studio's audience the show is
going on, the dancers are dancing, the singers are singing, the
comedians are being comedic and the orchestra with its genial, smiling
conductor is waving his baton.  Backstage, all is bedlam.</P>
<P>     There are murders, there are the producers and directors trying to
keep the show going so the studio audience is unaware of what is
happening behind the curtains. And there is even a love story. This
hodgepodge is flung at us to the point that we do not care who or why
anyone is murdered; rather the concentration is on when is this thing
going to end?</P>
<P>Story by George Lucas.  You never can tell.</P>
