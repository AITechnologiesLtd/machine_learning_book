<PRE>                               STRANGE DAYS
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     We are now into computer movies.  Suddenly, chips and virtual
reality have hit Hollywood.  We can expect more of the same and even
wilder films involving more than the present state of the art; the
state of a screenwriter's imagination.</P>
<P>     STRANGE DAYS hinges on a chip (they call it a "clip") which
records what a person is seeing, or thinking, or experiencing.  This is
caught on a digital contraption known as "the wire."  Put it on your
head and you experience what the person did.  Want to know what it is
like to be a woman?  A man puts the wire on his head and instantly
experiences what one woman did, saw, experienced.  Anything goes and it
happens, where else, but in Los Angeles on December 31, 1999,
incorrectly called the end of the Millennium.  (The Millenium ends
12/21/2000.)</P>
<P>     Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes, quite unrecognizable) is the most
prolific seller of these clips.  As he tells his customers, "This is
not TV; this is real life you will be experiencing."  And he has clips
of every sort from sex to murder.  This is the drug that has replaced
the old heroin.</P>
<P>     This would all be fine for those into this new genre but the film
gets bogged down in murder and the story gets wilder and wilder.  The
sound track, from beginning to end, is the loudest, most annoying noise
of any film I can think of.</P>
<P>     Helping Lenny in one way or another are MACE (Angela Bassett) who
is a friend.  She drives an armor-proof limousine as she chauffeurs the
wealthy and powerful around town.  MACE, in her way, loves Lenny but
Lenny loves Faith (Juliette Lewis) who no longer loves him.  Faith
dances at night clubs and does a mean wiggle; she never looked that
good before.  Max (Tom Sizemore) is an ex-cop, a friend of Lenny.  But
stirring them around in this film leads only to eventual boredom.  How
about waiting for the videotape?</P>
