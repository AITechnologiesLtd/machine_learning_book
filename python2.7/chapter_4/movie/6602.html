<P>     The formula is a familiar one:  two people meet, fall in love, and
spend the rest of the picture pretending they don't feel that way.  In
the bustling, big-city romantic comedy ONE FINE DAY, those two are
Michelle Pfieffer and George Clooney.  They play a pair of single,
working parents who are thrown together after their kids miss a field
trip.  The Cat and the Bat are an okay match, though neither actor
appears at a distinct advantage.  Mr. Clooney is not yet the Big Leading
Man that the hype would have him be, while Ms.  Pfieffer is stuck
struggling in a oddly unsympathetic role.  The latter point is
particularly problematic.  Pfieffer is portrayed as, well, a grouch who
can't control her son.  So when Clooney's character breezes in and
effortlessly takes charge of the situation, you can't help but wonder
what message is being sent.  Of course, these points are probably moot
as the movie itself is so exhausting that I'm tempted to label it
unwatchable.  Director Michael Hoffman (RESTORATION) overdoes it on
every possible front-- plot, music, repartee, etc.-- that the end result
is too much movie.  I just wanted to shut down and be done with it.</P>
