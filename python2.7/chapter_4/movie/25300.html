<PRE>ME, MYSELF & IRENE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Hollywood's bad boys are back.  Those equal opportunity offenders, the
Farrelly brothers (writer-directors Bobby and Peter), who gave us 1998's
funniest comedy, THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, turn their insults this
time to subjects ranging from black Mensa dwarfs to killer albinos.</P>
<P>The biggest surprise in ME, MYSELF & IRENE is that watching the movie is
about as much fun as attending a fireworks display on a rainy Fourth of
July.  Most of the jokes fizzle like soggy rockets, but a few do burst
in a marvelous display of outrageous humor.</P>
<P>The problem with the jokes isn't that they are too offensive but rather
that they simply aren't funny.  The Farrelly brothers certainly
acknowledge no bounds.  Their star, Jim Carrey, even defecates on his
neighbor's lawn in order to scare up a few laughs.  Our admittedly
sparse audience found little in the picture worth laughing at.  Indeed
the jokes that do work are more cute than outright funny.  Whereas in
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY I thought I was going to bust a gut, this
time I don't recall ever laughing loudly.</P>
<P>Carrey, as Charlie Baileygates (and his alter ego, the nefarious Hank),
work for "the world's greatest police force -- the Rhode Island State
Police," explains the film's purposely hokey narrator (Rex Allen, Jr.).
Charlie is a mild mannered guy who lets people run all over him.  When
his wife gives birth to black triplets, Charlie is the only guy around
who doesn't realize that his wife must have been cheating on him.  (The
kids grow up to be about 1,000 collective pounds of foul-mouthed wiz
kids, doted upon by Charlie.  His wife leaves him early in the story so
he is left to raise the kids on his own.)</P>
<P>One day, Charlie snaps.  His pent-up rage turns him into a "schizo" with
an evil personality named Hank.  Hank, who has more confidence than
ability, thinks he is invincible, which gets him into no end of trouble.
This leads to some of the film's best humor.  Hank ends up with an
unusual milk mustache in one clever scene.  Another funny episode
concerns his inaccuracy in his morning urination.</P>
<P>As Charlie's sweet companion, Renée Zellweger plays Irene P. Waters, a
woman in trouble.  Her ex-boyfriend has the EPA after him, and she finds
herself drawn into the controversy.  Soon corrupt cops (led by Chris
Cooper in a wasted role) are chasing her, and Charlie and Hank are along
for the ride, trying to defend her.  Carrey goes back and forth between
characters, enabling him to amply demonstrate his ability to transform
and contort his body in remarkable ways.  Although I didn't find it
funny, his fight with himself is certainly a tour de force of his
physical skills.</P>
<P>"Listen Pocahontas," Hank warns Irene.  "If you don't put your head to
the ground, you'll never hear the buffaloes coming."  The Farrelly
Brothers should have put their ears to the test screening walls more.
If they had, they might have heard that the laughs weren't coming as
they should on ME, MYSELF & IRENE.</P>
<P>ME, MYSELF & IRENE runs 1:56.  It is rated R for sexual content, crude
humor, strong language and some violence and would be acceptable for
older teenagers.</P>
