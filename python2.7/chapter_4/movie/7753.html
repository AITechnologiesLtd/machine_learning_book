<PRE>                              CATS DON'T DANCE
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     "No animals were harmed during the making of this movie.
      Although some were erased and had to be redrawn."</P>
<PRE>                                       -Final Closing Credit</PRE>
<P>     CATS DON'T DANCE is a cartoon musical featuring song and dance
numbers by animated animals with a story in-between.  The film had a
brief run in the secondary theaters and is now playing in the bargain
basement chains before moving to video.</P>
<P>     Distributed by Warner Brothers, the film has all new cartoon
characters, but most are takeoffs on older real actors.  The all too
cute human figure named Darla Dimple (speaking voice by Ashley Peldon
and singing by Lindsay Rideway) can be thought of as Shirley Temple's
evil twin.  She is so mean that she eats the heads off of all of her
animal crackers.</P>
<P>     The script was written by the committee of Mark Dindal, Robert
Lence, Brian McEntee, Rick Schneider, David Womersley, Kelvin Yasuda,
Robert Gannaway, Cliff Ruby, Elana Lesser, and Theresa Pettengill.  For
such an amalgamation of writers the style is amazingly consistent.  The
surprise in the approach is that the dialog is written at a much higher
level than in most kids' movies, which is both a blessing and a curse.
The adults will find more of interest, but the little kids may be lost,
especially in the story's many allusions to older films, like GONE WITH
THE WIND, and film stars (Cary Grant, Laurel and Hardy, Bette Davis,
and W. C. Fields).  The dialog tends to be more clever than funny.  ("I
hear that hippopotamuses are very big on Broadway," says Tillie Hippo,
voice by Kathy Najimy.  "Hippos are big everywhere," retorts another
animal.)</P>
<P>     The musical numbers are full of color and glitz worthy of old
Busby Berkeley numbers.  The animation uses a palate heavy on the
roses, pinks, and pale blues, and the images are drawn more for bold
imagination than realism.</P>
<P>     The story opens with a cat named Danny (voice by Scott Bakula)
leaving Kokomo on a bus for Hollywood.  He has a five day plan for
making it big in motion pictures.  ("See you in the Movies," being his
favorite expression.)</P>
<P>     Once he gets to Tinseltown, he faces discrimination because he is
an animal.  He gets a one-line part ("Meow") in the latest Darla Dimple
movie.  When Danny tries to upstage the star, her bodyguard Max (voice
by Mark Dindal), who has a body like the Rock of Gibraltar and a head
the size of an orange, throws Danny out.</P>
<P>     Danny spends the rest of the movie as a virtual warrior in a sort
of Animal Liberation Front.  "If we all work together, we can make our
dreams come true," he tells the animals in a classic pep talk.  "Let's
show the world what we can do."</P>
<P>     Some of the scenes may prove too dark and serious for younger
kids.  Danny's girlfriend Sawyer (speaking voice by Jasmine Guy and
singing by Natalie Cole) does a sad, but pretty, singing number in the
rain.</P>
<P>     Many of the scenes need crisper editing by Dan Molina.  And
Director Mark Dindal seems too infatuated with his obsession with
mimicking Hollywood of old to concern himself properly with the show's
timing.</P>
<P>     After a razzle-dazzle musical ending complete with battleship
guns, we are shown a set of movie posters from TWISTER to BATMAN AND
ROBIN to FREE TILLY with the show's animals in place of the normal
leads.  CATS DON'T DANCE is a highly forgettable romp of a movie which
can best be described as, well, cute.</P>
<P>     CATS DON'T DANCE runs just 1:15.  It is rated G and has little
other than a few ominous images to offend anyone.  Jeffrey, age 8,
thought the film was "excellent," and he especially liked Danny.  His
friend Amara, age 5 1/2, liked the film too but got a bit scared when
Max chased Danny.  A close call, but I do recommend the film and give
it ** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
