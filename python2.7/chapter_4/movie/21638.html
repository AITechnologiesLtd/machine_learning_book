<P>Wonders will never cease, said Sophocles.(Not the ancient Greek but 
a friend who speaks in cliches). Wes Craven, a shockmeister( plus 
schlockmeister for some), the creator of Freddy Krueger (Nightmare 
on Elm Street), is synonymous with horror flicks such as Scream, The 
People Under the Stairs, Shocker, The Swamp Thing, The Hills Have 
Eyes, Vampire in Brooklyn, etc.</P>
<P>The 77-minute documentary Small Wonders, released in 1996, made by 
Allen and Lana Miller, and Oscar-nominated, dealt with East Harlem 
violin teacher Roberta Guaspari-Tzavaras, whose sheer dedication, 
persistence and missionary-like zeal succeeded in educating hundreds 
of kids in the face of lack of funds and equipment, elimination of 
music and arts programs in the city's budget, and personal 
difficulties.</P>
<P>Craven, a professorial-looking, classical music lover, now 
middle-aged,  saw the documentary, was enthusiastic about making a 
theatrical feature of it, pursued his project with fervor. 
Overcoming raised eyebrows and  several stumbling blocks, (Madonna 
was to be his star), he was at long last able to enlist Meryl Streep 
who had never seen any of his films, to come up with a first-rate 
writer, other good performers, an amazing array of children, and 
finally a movie that looks, sounds and plays beautifully.</P>
<P>The film caught me by surprise. Its previews don't do it justice. 
The title is sentimental, old-fashioned. (It was originally 50 
Violins, which suggested a musical film, hence a probable loss of 
public). Every sign pointed to a feelgood, inspirational picture, of 
which too many are schlock without shock. But watching the finished 
product I realized that I, too, had fallen into the trap of 
preconceptions and generalizations about films with dedicated 
teachers. I had forgotten Mr.Holland's Opus; or the marvelous 
ancestor of them all, Goodbye Mr. Chips (1939); or the 
sweet-and-sour gem The Blackboard Jungle (1955), the British To Sir, 
with Love (1967), the less-known The Corn is Green (with Bette 
Davis, 1945) and others.</P>
<P>I suspect that my suspiciousness came from too many films made for 
teen tastes in the last two decades. They were school comedies 
--often funny for adults too --in which students did everything but 
study and their teachers were gamekeepers or ridiculous figures or 
ineffectual wall paper.</P>
<P>In any case, Music of the Heart is a first-class movie. I have not 
seen Small Wonders, so I cannot tell how faithfully MOTH develops it 
-- but I have the feeling that scriptwriter Pamela Gray and the 
director have stuck close to the documentary, with a few changes. 
(From a tiny picture I located the real Roberta is definitely a 
brunette). The feature is convincing throughout, with warmth and 
sentiment not exploited to the hilt.</P>
<P>In my audience no one wept audibly, but eighty-one percent of the 
viewers had moist eyes. (The margin of error is 3 %). My only 
criticism is that there is just a tiny bit of background given for 
Roberta. Her presence is alive and lively; her past is nebulous..</P>
<P>Roberta Guaspari, a mother of two boys, is ditched by her husband 
for one of the couple's close female friends. Roberta takes on a 
dumb store job, meets old school chum Brian who sends her to his 
friend Janet, a school principal. I'll omit general developments as 
well as details so as not to undo the pleasures of discovery 
--except that the movie wraps up with a large group of Roberta's 
kids playing in Carnegie Hall along with such fiddle greats as 
Itzhak Perlman, Isaac Stern, Arnold Steinhardt and several others.</P>
<P>All the actors are exceptionally good. Angela Bassett, who shared 
top billing with Eddie Murphy is Wes Craven's Vampire in Brooklyn 
is, additionally, gorgeous at 41. Gloria Estefan whom I knew only as 
a singer, has a perfectly performed supporting role.</P>
<P>On the screen, Aidan Quinn has always had a most likable persona. He 
can also be differentiated from others, an exception today when too 
many faces are interchangeable and semi-anonymous. It was a good 
move not to make too big a deal of his relationship with Roberta, 
and to have Quinn vanish for a couple of big stretches. The same 
non-hammering of several supporting characters is also a clever 
decision. It allows concentration on Roberta, her pupils and her 
struggles -- time well spent and never dull.</P>
<P>And Merryl Streep? Now 50 yet entirely credible as a woman in her 
late 30s, she is a marvel.  Let me mention an apocryphal story. In 
the 19th century, a famous Polish actress came to Paris. She was 
received like a queen. Appearing on the Opera's stage, she declaimed 
some things in Polish. The Who's Who audience did not know this 
language, but the lady was so great that she had them all moved to 
tears and applauding wildly. Later it was disclosed that the actress 
had recited the Polish alphabet, and La Marseillaise, the French 
National anthem. Streep could do the same.</P>
<P>For this movie she also learned to play the violin, from scratch (an 
apt expression in this case). Add this to her past feats, and you 
get not merely the Woman with a Thousand Faces, and Accents, but of 
a thousand capabilities too.</P>
<P>MOTH, on top of its other plusses, quietly yet firmly stands as a 
social triumph for race relations. The children, young and older, 
their parents, the overall milieu in Black and Hispanic Harlem, and 
so on, come in all sizes, flavors and ethnic backgrounds. Yet there 
are no sides formed, no racial conflicts, no mentions of prejudice. 
Striking a realistic note is the mother of black child who first 
rebels at the incursion of a Whitey teacher who does irrelevant 
white music. But Roberta wins her over.</P>
<P>The commonplace element of drugs and violence is played way down 
too. There is no X-rated language. Not that the film has been 
bowdlerized. Roberta has ex-cons working on the dilapidated house 
she bought, but furious at their methods, incapacity, and drinking, 
she fires them all. A student simply tells of her dad hitting her 
mother. Otherwise, there are no goody-goody passages in this early 
contender for the next set of Oscars.</P>
<P>This is indeed a feelgood movie, but with natural, realistic 
feelgoodness. We can use this in these rather cynical movie-days.</P>
