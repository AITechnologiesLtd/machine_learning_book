<PRE>Rating: Near Miss  (1 out of 4 stars)</PRE>
<P>The stereotypical American male has an undeniable fetishistic love of sports 
cars. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer plays upon that attraction with a movie so 
loaded with testosterone and laced titillatingly with shot after frenetic 
shot of powerful muscle cars, sleek foreign road huggers and iconic speed 
machines that many males will leave the theater in an orgasmic haze. Gone is 
60 Seconds is an orgy of maleness gone horribly awry.</P>
<P>Cage is legendary retired car thief, Memphis Raines (don't you love cute 
movie names), who must call upon his time worn skills to save his 
thick-headed brother (Ribisi) from being killed. Seems a murderous crime 
boss (Eccleston) with a fetish for wood (insert your own joke) hired brother 
Kip to steal a ridiculous amount of expensive, exotic autos. Fifty cars, to 
be exact. Poor Kip screws the pooch and bungles the job badly. If the cars 
aren't delivered in three days, bossman has a casket carved out just for 
Kip. Literally. If only someone could save him. Hmmmm..wonder what Memphis 
is doing?</P>
<P>In order to give the film some emotional heft, there are several subplots 
designed to tug at our heartstrings or give us the thrill of...yawn, excuse 
me, dramatic tension. Shadowing Memphis is an old law enforcement foe 
(Lindo) who's looking to send Memphis away. Will he catch him? There's old 
flame Sway (Jolie), who had her heart broken by Memphis years ago. Will they 
get back together? Shortsighted, thrill seeker Kip idolizes his brother, yet 
resents him for moving away from the family. Will they reconnect? Raines old 
mentor (Duvall) has long since left the life of crime. Will Memphis get him 
finally caught as he pulls him back into the life, one more time? Can you 
answer all these questions correctly in 2 seconds without seeing the film 
first? I'll bet you can.</P>
<P>Following the opening credits, which fill you in on the accomplishments of 
the Raines family through a montage of old photos, we was taken full 
throttle into the splendor that is Memphis. He's first shown living the good 
life teaching young children to drive go-carts. In a later scene, as misfit 
brother Kip knowingly tells Memphis he has the stolen car situation under 
control, all the while making breakfast, a metaphor is made of Shakespearean 
proportions. Just as a pan of grease flares up with Kip clueless to how to 
quell it, big brother Memphis calmly and efficiently throws some salt on it. 
Looks like everything might turn out alright after all. You know this 
because the music swells on the crest of violins.</P>
<P>That's about as strong as the characterization gets, which is a shame. 
Bruckheimer has a real talent for loading his movies with an obscene amount 
of talent given the task at hand.  Monumentally underused Jolie portrays an 
empty headed sexpot whose idea of sex revolves around cars and Memphis. Or 
maybe it's just the cars. Duvall trots out his ornery, but sweet old codger 
outfit. I'm sure he's still laughing at taking a paycheck for this one. 
Lindo projects a warm hearted, but tightly focused detective that almost 
transcends the material. The biggest waste of resources is Vinnie Jones, who 
plays a mute accomplice of Memphis. Without saying a word, he is easily the 
most charismatic person in the movie. Like a blast of nitrous oxide, he 
attacks each scene with a straightforward zeal. Too bad his minutes onscreen 
are so few. Somehow, Bruckheimer manages to attract top Hollywood acting 
talent to high concept, poorly written movies, gussies up the film with lots 
of gold hues and pleasingly stylized action and they sell like proverbial 
hotcakes.</P>
<P>Every time something clever happens it's counterbalanced by something so 
overtly wrong that it jerks you back into realizing you're watching a movie. 
There's a innovative usage of black lighting that goes from being a novelty 
to a part of the plot. It's counterbalanced by an extremely feeble attempt 
at humor by having an Asian American repeatedly failing a driver's test. 
Imagine the yuks. There's a segment where one of the thieves shows another 
his cool fake fingerprint trick. It's countered by the lame semi-subplot of 
a car being stolen with a bunch of heroin in the trunk. The ramifications 
are never explored. Then there's the ridiculousness of the many cops who 
actually shoot at fleeing cars. Not only is it stupid, but it's against the 
law.</P>
<P>This is a movie made of pretty, but tepid car chases strung together by just 
enough character interaction to move the plot along. Gone in 60 Seconds 
aptly describes how long it'll take for this marginally entertaining, but 
empty film to leave your memory.</P>
