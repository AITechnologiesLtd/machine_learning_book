Review by:        Joy Wyse</PRE>
<P>In the movie theater, prior to the screening, a trivia statement appeared
on the screen.  It said that Les Miserables was the first full-length
motion  picture filmed in America, in 1809.   Now if that was so Victor
Hugo would have been writing science fiction    because the story begins
in 1812 after  Jean Valjean has served 19 years in prison, and continues
for another 20 years.  The date should have read 1909.   Some later
versions have been 1913 [France], 1918 [US], 1922 [ GB], 1925 [France],
1934 [France] 1935 {US - with Fredric March and Charles Laughton], 1946
[Italy], 1952 [US - Michael Rennie and Robert Newton] and 1957 [France]. 
And, there is the musical version.</P>
<P>The trivia statement also said that the current version stars Geoffrey
Rush.  When did Javert become the main role?    Perhaps it was because we
get to know Javert a bit better in this rendition than in others.  His
admission that his father was a thief and his mother was a prostitute
helps us understand more fully his reactions to Valjean, Fantine, and
Cosette.</P>
<P>Unless you have read the very long book by Victor Hugo, you will have
different memories of the main and sub-plots as they unfold.  It was
interesting to me that an unusual number of people got up and left the
theater for short times.  When I went outside, because I started coughing,
I spoke with a couple of people.  They  said that they  knew the plot well
enough to miss a bit of it.  That does not speak well for a film.  How
many went outside during Titanic, because they knew the ending?</P>
<P>A brief synopsis is that Valjean had served 19 years in hard labor for
stealing food because he was hungry.  After his release he is shunned by
most people except for a bishop who gives him a second chance in life. 
Ten years later, in 1822, he owns a factory and is the mayor of Vigau,
living a quiet life.  </P>
<P>Javert, who was a guard at the prison, is assigned to Vigau and thinks
that he recognizes Valjean, although he's not certain.  </P>
<P>Working at Valjean's factory is Fantine who is an unwed mother.  Her
daughter, Cosette, is living with a foster family, The Thenardiers, who
treat the child poorly and overcharge Fantine for her keep.  Fantine turns
to prostitution but becomes ill.  Valjean takes her into his care and
promises her, on her deathbed, that he will protect Cosette and raise her
as his own.</P>
<P>As Javert closes in, Valjean and Cosette leave Vigau and take refuge in a
convent elsewhere, but when Cosette grows to be a young woman she does not
wish to become a nun.  She longs to learn of the world outside of the
convent walls.  During one of her first ventures into those unfamiliar
surroundings she falls in love with a young political activist, Marius.  </P>
<P>The conclusion combines an attempted rebellion, Javert's pursuit, Marius'
injury, and what destiny holds in store for all of them.</P>
<P>Marius was the big disappointment.  He came across as a wimp.  It had to
be Cosette's lack of knowledge that attracted her to him.  She could have
done so much better.   I don't feel that anyone, with the exception of
Fantine, was portrayed as well as possible.  There were times that I
should have been brought to tears, and I wasn't.  Perhaps it was because
August and Yglesias tried to condense the plot too much.  Only the scenes
with the Bishop, or the ones with Fantine moved me.   What should have
been a memorable motion picture was simply a good one.  Instead of wanting
to see it again, I'd like to see another  version  or re-read the book.</P>
<P>Because it does have so many redeeming features including costumes and
locations, I give it a B.  I wish it had been an A.</P>
