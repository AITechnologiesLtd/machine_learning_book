APOLLO 13
A film by Ron Howard
Starring: Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Ed Harris, Gary Sinise, 
and Kathleen Quinlan</PRE>
<P>    A cinematic tour-de-force, +ACI-Apollo 13+ACI- was not only one of 
1996's best films, but Ron Howard's critical and commercial 
breakthrough, as he found himself with universal acclaim for this 
extraordinary adaptation of Jim Lovell's true account on what happened 
on this doomed space flight.  Breathtaking in nearly every aspect, 
Apollo 13 succeeded in creating suspense and drama from a 
story that was already well-known, with breathtaking shots of space 
through excellent special effects work. </P>
<P>Jim Lovell (Hanks) is a veteran space commander who is being 
rewarded for all his efforts for the NASA space program by being given 
command of Apollo 13, the 2nd flight after Neil Armstrong's historic 
moon landing in 1969.  By then, public interest had gone down in the 
space program, and many viewed the space mission as routine, until an 
explosion in the command module left the crew, Jack Swigert (Bacon) and 
Fred Haise (Paxton), in the middle of space with extreme obstacles in 
their way.  Leading the efforts to bring the men back is Ken Mattingly 
(Sinise), who was the original pilot for the ship until he was scrubbed 
for medical reasons, and mission commander Gene Kranz (Harris).  Along 
the way, the crew encounters many problems that endanger their lives, 
and procedures never attempted before, as they try to defeat the odds, 
and make it home.
   Apollo 13 also tells the story of the people back home.  
While telling the story in the skies, the film manages to show the 
emotional turbulences that happen within the ship, and within the Lovell 
household.  Marilyn Lovell (Quinlan), Jim Lovell's wife, tries to keep 
her sanity while managing a household full of children, whose father is 
far from home, and in perilous danger.  The film also tells the story of 
the men in NASA, who are working frantically to solve the crew's 
problems, while managing with their own eccentricities. </P>
<P>The casting for the film is pure genius.  Paxton and Bacon give 
emotional power to their roles few would have thought possible, and 
Sinise builds on his stunning performance in Forrest Gump to 
create an emotionally torn, yet tough Ken Mattingly, whose feelings of 
resentment and concern are brilliantly balanced to play an integral part 
in bringing the crew home.  The centerpiece of the cast is the finest 
actor in Hollywood, Tom Hanks.  Through his pains, suffering, toughness, 
determination, cool, calm, and steadiness, we the audience feel ease.  
It is comforting to know that Hanks is piloting this ship+ADs- he has a 
calm quality that drives the film's emotional heart.  This is Hanks' 
film, and he pilots it with cool precision, as he gives the audience 
what he masterfully delivers everytime: a quiet everyman who gets the 
job done.  He draws the sympathy of the masses, and then drives this 
film home in the clutch.</P>
<P>This movie is an unqualified success.  Everything about it is 
pitch-perfect, from the acting down to the extraordinary special 
effects.  The script blends real news-clips with dramatic footage, 
placing the viewer in the year 1970 with brilliant success, even using 
comedy, romance, and dramatic cliches to perfection.  The score, made by 
James Horner, is also brilliant, heightening the suspense and drama in 
critical situations, and highlighting the emotional trauma of all those 
involved in the mission.</P>
<P>The special effects are simply astonishing.  From the liftoff to 
touchdown, every effect, every space shot has the same realism as the 
newsclips blended seamlessly into the film.  James Cameron's Digital 
Domain outdid itself with this splendid recreation of space travel that 
is simply a marvel to look at.  The scenes in space are visually 
astounding, especially the lunar sunrise.  Every shot made me want to 
travel in space, and look at these magnificent views of the world.  This 
film wasn't made of this Earth, the effects are so real it had to have 
been shot in space.</P>
<P>Howard's direction is brilliant.  From the ingenious cinematography 
and effects, to the comic undertones of the script, to the quick cuts 
that energize the film's decisive moments, everything about this film 
works.  Howard balances the many settings, the many characters, the 
technical jargon, the realism, the news-clips, and the vivid special 
effects with ease.  The performances just are simply outstanding, with 
Hanks delivering another knock-out.  There is nothing to dislike, 
nothing to even consider a flaw.  This is one of the finest pictures of 
the decade, and is destined to be one of America's most treasured 
accounts of a historical time-period that was traumatic and 
inspirational at the same time.  Designed to be a classic, Apollo 
13 is one of the finest dramas of our age, and firmly supplants 
Howard and Hanks as leaders in their respective fields.  One only wishes 
summer movies are always this good.  This is one hell of a movie.</P>
