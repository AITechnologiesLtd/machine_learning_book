<PRE>`Toy Story 2' – A Great Holiday Gift
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>Yee-haw!  The long-awaited sequel featuring Cowboy
Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) and Buzz Lightyear (voiced
by Tim Allen) has finally arrived.  And, if there is
any movie to see this holiday season, this is it!</P>
<P>When the first Toy Story came to the big screen.  It
was a fabulous achievement in both Disney storytelling
and computer-animation.  We fell in love with not only
Woody and Buzz, but the supporting cast of toys that
included a piggy bank, Mr. Potato Head, green army
men, and other playthings from the pre-Atari era. 
These toys stimulated the child's imagination in every
way that TS2 will stimulate yours.</P>
<P>The underlying story is about friendship and
sacrifice.  Woody learns the frailty of his existence
when during playtime with his owner, his arm is
accidentally damaged.  He is exiled away on the top
shelf where he learns the fate of a toy that had not
been seen in quite some time.  It's Weezy, a squeaking
penguin whose squeaker no longer works.  Weezy will be
heading for the dreaded garage sale.  Woody attempts
to save him.  This beginning sequence is important to
the concept of Toy Story.  Toys do have a life of
their own, and the happiness that they experience is
dependent on the love that the owner gives, much like
a pet.  Toys feel, they long for affection, and they
watch out for one another.  </P>
<P>In trying to save Weezy, Woody winds up as an item in
the garage sale.  A shopper recognizes Woody as a rare
collector's item.  His name is Big Al (voiced by Wayne
Knight) and he quickly snatches this rare find and
drives off.  Buzz and his crew of toys must get Woody
back. Using the unique mapping abilities of
Etch-a-Sketch, they embark on a dangerous search and
rescue mission across town.  To cross a street for
example, they hide underneath orange traffic cones,
which force oncoming cars to swerve left and right
through the ad hoc construction zone.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Woody learns why he was of such interest to
Big Al.  Woody is one of an ensemble of toys called
the Roundup Gang.  The other members of the gang
include Cowgirl Jessie (voiced by Joan Cusack), Stinky
Pete (voiced by Kelsey Grammer), and a horse named
Bullseye.  He is further amazed to learn that his
popularity stemmed from an old black and white
television puppet show.  A Japanese museum wants to
collect the entire ensemble.  Without Woody, the
others are worthless and would be locked away forever.
 It's a fate that no toy ever wants to experience. 
Jessie pleads with Woody to stay recalling her
experience as a toy once loved but then discarded once
her owner grew up.  Stinky Pete, still in its original
box, laments the fact that nobody would ever love a
doll the way he looks.  Their concerns touch Woody,
for he knows that it may just be a matter of time
before Andy forgets about him, especially with his
damaged arm.  But Buzz tells Woody that it's better to
be loved for a little while than to be locked away
behind a glass partition in some museum.</P>
<P>Like the first Toy Story, TS2 uses the same
state-of-the-art computer animation.  There is
enormous attention to details, and the film goes much
further than being just a Sunday school lesson about
friends.  Terrific shots of humor abound throughout
the film, and for the older set, there is also a great
deal of action, as the fate of Woody becomes unclear. 
Will Buzz be able to convince him to return?  Will Big
Al get his way and ship him off to Japan.  The
20-minute finale is nothing less than spectacular.  I
was thoroughly impressed with the skillfulness of the
animation, the pace of the story, and the ability of
the writers to remind us that toys are as magical as
our own childhood.  Far better than the original, TS2
should be atop your movie wishlist.</P>
