<PRE>A Perfect Murder (1998)
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Michael Douglas; Gwyneth Paltrow; Viggo Mortensen & David Suchet</P>
<P>Michael Douglas plays Steven Taylor, a rich financier who has a very young
wife. (Gwyneth Paltrow). Things are not going great in the marriage. This
may have something to do with the fact that she is having an affair with a
struggling artist (Viggo Mortensen). So Hubby decides to have his lovely
young wife murdered -- and he hires his wife's lover to do it. If that
doesn't interest you right there, I don't know what will. Douglas's
character has the murder planned to perfection. Except one little thing goes
wrong, his wife survives the murder attempt. Now her husband must cover his
tracks and avoid being caught.</P>
<P>A Perfect Murder is based on the stage play "Dial M For Murder" and is a
remake of the Alfred Hitchcock classic of the same name. This latest version
is certainly on of the most well written movies that you are likely to see
in the near future. I was amazed at the amount of thought that was put into
the story, particularly the amount of detail surrounding the murder plot.
The dialogue is also first rate, which is what you'd expect for a film of
this caliber.</P>
<P>It's one thing to have good writing, but you also need the acting to go with
it. Casting Michael Douglas in this film was the best thing they could have
done. He gives his usual stellar performance, and makes everyone around him
look that much better. That's not to say that Douglas's costars weren't
great. Quite the opposite, Gwyneth Paltrow and Viggo Mortensen did a
fantastic job in this film. In both cases though, they did not fail to give
their best performances in the film when they were doing a scene with
Michael Douglas.</P>
<P>Also worthy of mention is the overall look of this film. To say it was
stylish was an understatement. This is one good looking film. The obvious
attention to detail that was paid to the sets and overall feel of the film
is more than a match for the intricate plot line of this film.</P>
<P>A Perfect Murder is a film that makes you pay attention. Not because you
have to, but because you want to. This is a tribute to the fine storytelling
of this movie. It also makes A Perfect Murder a very good choice for your
next trip to the video store.</P>
