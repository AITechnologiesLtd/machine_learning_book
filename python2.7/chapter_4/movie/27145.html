<P>THE FAMILY MAN (2000) ** Director, Brett Ratner. Writers, David 
Diamond, David Weissman. Photography, Sante Spinotti. Editing, Mark 
Helfrich. Production design, Kristi Zea. Music, Danny Elfman. Cast: 
Nicolas Cage, Tea Leoni, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Piven, Saul Rubinek, et 
al. A Universal release. 125 minutes. PG-13.</P>
<P>Another Opera (with suds). Its  Overture.is in 1977 at  Kennedy 
Airport. Jack (Cage) is off to a one-year internship in a major 
London  bank. The camera  focuses on him and his girl Kate. (Leoni) 
as the mike picks up their gloppy kisses in surround-sound stereo. 
Kate has premonitions, begs Jack not to leave--but he does.</P>
<P>Jump ahead 13 years. Kate is out of the picture. Jack is a 
mover-shaker on Wall Street, Ferrari-driving, chic, fast-talking, 
authoritarian. He's  called a meeting on Christmas eve to finalize a 
financial coup.</P>
<P>Next morning, he wakes up in his regal apartment with a beautiful 
call girl at his side. She departs. He greets the day joyfully, 
bellowing atrociously the aria "La Donna e mobile," selecting his 
suit from a enormous collection of  priced-through-the-roof outfits.</P>
<P>Later he goes to a convenience store in which bum-like Cash (Don 
Cheadle.) irrupts to redeem his winning lottery ticket. Accused of 
having doctored it he goes wild, pulls out a gun. Jack intervenes and 
makes a deal with Cash. (Cheadle is very good, as is the whole 
sequence). The bellicose fellow will turn out to be a sort of angel 
whose  mission is to give Jack the chance to see what other road he 
might have taken.</P>
<P>The morning after Jack wakes up in a tatty house in a New Jersey 
suburb.. It is his house, complete with wife of 13 years Kate ( 
hardly aged) and kids. He labors at his father-in-law's tire store, 
consorts with working-class people, has a K-Mart. wardrobe. etc. Is 
this a fall  from grace?</P>
<P>The Family Man's schlock for the holidays is a feelgood fantasy in 
the lineage of excellent movies like It's a Wonderful Life, Here 
Comes Mr. Jordan, the latter's remake Heaven Can Wait (with Warren 
Beatty), plus a slew of others, some good some bad. The genre is 
crowd-pleasing but tricky to make and as delicate as thin crystal.    </P>
<P>Hours before this movie's preview I had watched Cocteau's enchanting 
Beauty and the Beast which has its own, its fairy-tale logic. But The 
Family Man is a juggling act, awkward, often trite, with a plot that 
keeps painting itself into corners.  The screenwriters must have had 
long bull-sessions about what to do next (which is a mess) and how to 
wrap things up (which is even messier).</P>
<P>Jack, conscious of both his lives, hates everything about his "new" 
one and his semi-blue collar existence. Yet this milieu of "little 
people" is supposed to be a good life, while that of the tycoons is 
bad.           </P>
<P>Story holes come in avalanches. Just one example. Kate is a 
low-income lawyer with social consciousness. She does pro bono 
(uncompensated) work for those in need. But since both she and Jack 
graduated from Law School, whatever turned him into a tire salesman?</P>
<P>You can bet your life that Jack will falling love with Kate and the 
kids. But then he wants to have his cake and  eat it, which tangles 
matters artificially and makes our suspension of disbelief grow 
exponentially.</P>
<P>There are some good (and/or funny) bits, including the couple's young 
daughter who  thinks that Jack is not her father but an 
alien clone--shades of the Invasion of the Body Snatchers  (Lite). 
But the tortuous plot and deja vu, by-the-numbers performances, are 
more for viewers who think "movies" rather than "cinema." --and 
that's not a snobbish remark. Cheadle's role is much too short and 
vague. Nicolas Cage is an actor I like, but I have the feeling that 
he has accepted too many roles that encourage a sameness in 
performing them. Here, in a variant of the (apocryphal?) judgment for 
Fred Astaire's first screen test, the verdict might be: "Can't sing. 
Can't dance. Can act a little."</P>
<P>On the other hand, Tea Leoni does grace the picture. There's a chance 
connection with her first ever role, in Switch, where a man dies and 
returns to earth as a woman. Leoni's was a bit part. Small roles 
followed in  A League of their Own and others. Then she was 
third-billed in Flirting with Disaster" and second-billed in Deep 
Impact. The predictable mass appeal of The Family Man will make her a 
star. But for my money, I'll stick to my favorite holidays movie, A 
Christmas Story.</P>
