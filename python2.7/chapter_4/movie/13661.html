<PRE>THE OPPOSITE OF SEX
A film review by Andrew Hicks
Copyright 1998 Andrew Hicks</PRE>
<PRE>(1998) ***1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        Christina Ricci was always a little weird. I mean, you'd have 
to be to play a convincing Wednesday Addams and hang out with 
Casper the Friendly Ghost. But in the past year, most of her movies 
have seen a turn from sitcom remake queen to a messed-up whore. 
Last year's THE ICE STORM saw her seducing a junior-high kid, but that 
was just the beginning. THE OPPOSITE OF SEX is one of the most twisted, 
amoral films of the year, and also one of the best.</P>
<P>        Ricci plays a teenager whose home life gets so bad that she 
heads to Indiana to live with a gay half-brother (Martin Donovan) who 
teaches high school. Life isn't so great for the brother, either. His lover 
has just died of AIDS and, worse yet, his ex-lover's sister is Phoebe 
from "Friends," and she won't go away. Actually, Kudrow has for once 
chosen a role with brains. She's been ditzy funny in ROMY AND 
MICHELE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION and MOTHER, but here she rattles off 
some of the most intelligent one-liners in the film.</P>
<P>        Clever one-liners are the backbone of THE OPPOSITE OF SEX, as 
is the cocky narration from Ricci. Rarely does the "Yeah, I know this 
is a movie" approach work, but when Ricci's character advances the 
story like someone who has seen hundreds of conventional movies and 
wants to keep her biography from being anything but, it's a new and 
witty approach. And, more importantly, it fits with a movie about 
unstable, abnormal people.</P>
<P>        As Ricci comes to visit Donovan, her brother has a new 
boyfriend in the overly handsome Ivan Sergei. She makes some 
smalltalk about "homos" and what-not before deciding Sergei is only 
gay because he's never had a real woman and, as all Internet perverts 
know, Christina Ricci is definitely a real woman. It doesn't take much 
prodding before Sergei decides to forsake the out-hole for the in-hole 
and join the heterosexual team.</P>
<P>        That's about the time Sergei realizes the biggest drawback of 
the straight life -- having your girlfriend tell you she's pregnant. Yes, 
Ricci is with child and Donovan is pissed, kicking them out of the 
house. So they swipe $10,000 of his money and head to L.A. while an 
ex-boyfriend (Johnny Galecki, David from "Roseanne") demands to 
know where Sergei is. When Donovan doesn't help him out, he tells 
the cops that the teacher molested him in high school.</P>
<P>        THE OPPOSITE OF SEX continues in true Springeresque fashion 
through one crazy plot development after another. Most of them are 
guaranteed to offend at least one audience member, although this 
product of writer-director Don Roos' imagination always manages to 
be elegantly sleazy. There are only a few ways to successfully approach 
horrendous storylines (blackmailing your half-brother by holding his 
dead lover's ashes hostage, Lyle Lovett as a love interest, etc.) but this 
movie does it well, and kept me laughing throughout.</P>
