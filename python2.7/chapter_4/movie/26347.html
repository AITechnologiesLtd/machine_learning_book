                        A film review by Jeremiah Kipp

<P>        Welcome to a piece of American history.  In the old music hall, white
comedians and song 'n' dance men would splash their faces in charcoal,
maybe throw on a pair of white gloves, then go through the
step-n-fetchin' routine, the exotica and the buffoonery of perceived
black culture.  Jim Crow, Amos 'n' Andy, Mammy, L'il Black Sambo, Uncle
Tom, and the Ten Pickaninnies were typical characters thrown on stage
and screen for the amusement and mockery of white audiences.</P>
<P>        What began as white actors in blackface evolved with the 1950s Amos and
Andy Show on television, featuring black actors in blackface.  The
content remained the same, with Amos and Andy portrayed as lazy,
ignorant, chicken eatin', banjo playin', shifty clowns.  Once the show
lost favor with an outraged public, the television studios put a halt on
developing new shows about the black experience -- degrading or
otherwise -- for several decades.</P>
<P>        Spike Lee's Bamboozled works as angry satire, asking that we not forget
the offensive and disturbing corners of our history.</P>
<P>        Pierre Delacroix (Damon Wayans) is the one black writer working for the
CNS television studio. The ratings are plummeting, so an Ebonics-talking
hotshot producer named Dunwitty (Michael Rapaport) turns to his
Ivy-League educated black stooge and demands a new urban themed show
with a fresh new hook.  "You can do it, my nigga!" Dunwitty beams, "and
I can call you my nigga because my wife is black and I got two
interracial babies at home."</P>
<P>        Delacroix has cooked up dozens of ideas for sitcoms and dramas
involving black characters, all of which have been rejected as old hat. 
Thinking he can beat the television industry at its own game, he comes
up with the most offensive, disgusting, horrible idea he could possibly
imagine: a revival of the minstrel show featuring black actors in
blackface.  His mission is to get fired immediately, the only way to
break his contract.</P>
<P>        Well, surprise, surprise!  Dunwitty claims to have a boner for the
idea, so they immediately go into production.  Delacroix and his
assistant, Sloan (Jada Pinkett Smith) are suddenly in over their heads,
faced with a choice to either go with the flow and ride on the magic
carpet of their success or realize the consequences of their actions and
do something to combat the blatant racism of this program.</P>
<P>        The premise of Spike Lee's film is undoubtedly strong, with a promising
first act that keeps the stakes very high.  Immediately, however, some
of the warning signs start to show, such as his one-dimensional
depiction of Delacroix, the whitest black man on the planet, and the
conflicted Sloan, whose character changes in such radical leaps and
bounds that we again realize, no matter how well-performed the role is
by Pinkett Smith, Spike Lee could not write a fully developed woman
character to save his life.</P>
<P>        If the opening of the movie is good enough to carry us through some of
its unsubtleties, Spike Lee really hits his stride with the televised
mistrel show.  Inspired by the vaudeville routines, performers "Mantan"
(Savion Glover) and "Sleep 'n' Eat" (the superb Tommy Davidson) dress in
gaudy costumes, don the white gloves and charcoal make-up, fire engine
red lips, and googly eyes, and they follow the gawky movements of
stereotypical blackface characters.</P>
<P>        No punches are pulled.  We see scenes where the two goofballs sneak
into the chicken coop for some good eatin' while massah prowls outside
with his shotgun.  The scene has been set in Massah's watermelon patch,
where the darkies dance their troubles away.</P>
<P>        Purely offensive and disturbing, Spike Lee's accurate recreations of
these programs are heightened by montage footage of the actual minstrel
shows of America's past.  This black and white footage haunts the
present day situations of actors Manray (Glover) and Womack (Davidson),
including those painful scenes where they sit in front of a mirror,
melting cork into black paste, swabbing their skin in cocoa butter to
prevent burning and smearing red lipstick on their mouths.</P>
<P>        For quite a while, Bamboozled works as brilliant satire.  Even if the
offstage antics of Manray, basking in his newfound fame, and Womack,
bitter at his own exploitation, feel fairly obvious as dramatic
archetypes, Lee's situation is strong enough to carry it through.</P>
<P>        However, in the middle of the second act, Spike Lee hurls his entire
movie over the cliff with some obvious dramatic tactics.  We're treated
to scenes which we knew were coming, such as the inevitable lecturing of
Delacroix by his mother, who is ashamed of him.  Of course, Sloan
figures into a predictable would-be love triangle between Delacroix and
Manray. (After all, what are women characters good for?)</P>
<P>        As with almost every film he's made, Spike Lee clutters up his movie
with distracting subplots such as obvious, pontificating potshots at the
Wu-Tang Clan, Tommy Hilfiger's clothing line, O.J. Simpson's trial, and
violence in the media.</P>
<P>        His unforgivable last fifteen minutes feature a kidnapping, violence
and bloodshed which are as ridiculous and contrived as they are
out-of-character and so concerned with making a "point" that it betrays
no less than three of the major characters in his scenario (especially
the main female character, who sinks to a great low without any
foreshadowing.)</P>
<P>        It nearly destroys the movie, and certainly tarnishes the conclusion.
Spike Lee again comes up with seemingly five different endings while
wrapping the movie up, and is content to include each and every one of
them.</P>
<P>        That said, no other filmmaker is tackling this subject matter today. 
Spike Lee may be pompous and arrogant, create one-sided arguments, and
go for unsubtle choices, but he's also a master of visual allegory, he
creates vivid and colorful dialogue, and he arouses passion in his
audience.  Bamboozled, for all its numerous and frustrating flaws, is
important viewing.  It's a film which says, in no uncertain terms, that
there are some things we must not forget.</P>
