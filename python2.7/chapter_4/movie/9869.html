<P>In a new addition to the Academy Award winning film Beauty and The
Beast, Enchanted Christmas tells the tale of how Belle and the Enchanted
Objects brought Christmas back to the castle despite Beast's wishes to
the contrary. Beast, who long ago lost everything on Christmas day hates
it and those who wish to celebrate it. Feeding this loathing is Forte, a
evil pipe organ who has decided that he likes life better as an
Enchanted Object than as a man and doesn't want things to change. Now
the friends, including the reluctant Angelique - a beautiful tree
ornament who was once the castle decorator must organize to bring
Christmas about in secret.</P>
<P>Beautifully animated and featuring great musical numbers including five
original songs in addition to a collection of Christmas classics,
Enchanted Christmas is sure to be a favorite for the kiddies. For the
parents it will also be fun to watch on Christmas Day, although it lacks
some of the charm of the original. The computer generation of Forte
actually adds to his sinister and evil charm when compared to the rest
of the characters who are drawn with traditional techniques. He is
devilish in the way he is realised. The rest of characters who are drawn
from the original movie are beautifully animated and brought to life.
Generally speaking, this won't be considered an all time classic like
the first installment, but it will add to the list of movies that the
kids just need to watch on Christmas day.</P>
