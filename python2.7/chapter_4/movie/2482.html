<PRE>                         FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Hugh Grant, Andie MacDowell, Kristin Scott Thomas, Simon Callow,
           James Fleet, Charlotte Coleman.
Screenplay:  Richard Curtis.
Director:  Mike Newell.</P>
<P>     Where romantic comedy is concerned, I am a tough sell.  Too many
of them seem to put across the impression that all you need to do is
put two people on the screen and have them end up together, regardless
of whether or not they are developed with an interesting conflict (or
even speak to one another, as in the monstrously overhyped SLEEPLESS IN
SEATTLE).  I'm not going to turn into a pile of goo every time I see a
screen kiss, but I will respond if I've spent two hours with two
well-developed characters who seem to belong together.  The new British
comedy FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL delivers only halfway.  Hugh Grant
turns in a charming, star-making performance in this uneven character
piece, but Andie MacDowell always appears to be more of a prop than a
person.</P>
<P>     Grant stars as Charles, an inveterate bachelor who seems to find
himself going to a friend's wedding every weekend.  At one of these
weddings, he spots a beautiful American named Carrie (Andie MacDowell),
and finds himself instantly smitten.  Their encounter is brief, but
leaves him wondering about his own desire for a lasting relationship,
and his ability to make it succeed.  Then, to Charles' surprise, he
meets Carrie again, at yet another wedding.  However, there is an
impediment to his affections:  Carrie is engaged.  While their flame
smolders throughout their periodic meetings, Charles is ultimately left
to deal with his own fears and to make some difficult decisions about
what he really wants.</P>
<P>     FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL was written by Richard Curtis,
co-creator of the popular British television import "Black Adder," a
series not renowned for its sentimentality.  And FOUR WEDDINGS is
extremely winning when it's not focusing on relationships.  The film is
loaded with goofy moments--Charles the best man frantically trying to
improvise for the forgotten wedding rings in the first ceremony; "Black
Adder" vet Rowan Atkinson as a nervous novice priest malapropping his
way through the second wedding; Charles trapped in a room with two
newlyweds with impressive stamina.  There are enough of these lively
set pieces that FOUR WEDDINGS rarely lags for too long, and the laughs
come at fairly regular intervals.</P>
<P>     It is when Curtis shifts to his characters that he stumbles.  Part
of the problem is that in an attempt to create yet another ensemble
friends piece he overloads the film with supporting characters, giving
short shrift to the crucial relationship between Charles and Carrie.
What's worse, almost all of the friends are drawn in only the
sketchiest of terms; characters like Charles' cynical friend Fiona
(Kristin Scott Thomas) and flatmate Scarlett (Charlotte Coleman) are
given a few lines to establish their particular romantic dilemma, then
sent to fade into the background.  Only James Fleet, as befuddled
aristocrat Tom, provides any spark to the proceedings.  The simple fact
is that I kept losing track of the relationships between all these
people, and didn't particularly care when I could figure them out.</P>
<P>     This lack of focus is inexcusable considering the cursory
treatment Carrie's character is given.  Part of FOUR WEDDINGS AND A
FUNERAL's message about love is that we should all be looking for that
one person who makes "lightning strike," and while the romantic
sentiment is laudable it also assumes that we as an audience should
recognize it when we see it.  Hugh Grant, looking frighteningly like
Harold Lloyd in his horn-rims, is an absolute delight; he turns Charles
into a wonderful, funny, fallible character, and we want to see him
happy.  But Carrie is simply a plot device.  We know virtually nothing
about her except that Charles has a crush on her, and Andie MacDowell
is not subtle enough an actress to fill in the blanks.  It also might
have been helpful to understand Charles' romantic history better, which
could have been accomplished through a more complete picture of
ex-girlfriend Henrietta, but that too is absent.  There is much to
recommend FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL as a comedy; it's bright and
spirited and well-paced.  As a romance, it leaves much to be
desired ... primarily a second party for the romantic pairing.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 weddings:  7.</PRE>
