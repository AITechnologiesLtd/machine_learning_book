                       A film review by John Paul Powell

<P>     "They call it Paradise.  I don't know why.  To call some place
Paradise ... kiss it goodbye." - The Eagles (The Last Resort)</P>
<P>     The Mormons were bright bulbs.  They moved in, spent two years
milking cows and praying, then split.  In 1864, the army built a fort
protecting prospectors from rattlesnake/cactus swarmings and the
occasional coyote drive-by shootings.  In 1931, the Nevada legislature
took a sledgehammer to Pandora's Box.  Quickie divorces and gambling
were legalized.  Sin City rolled out the welcome wagon.</P>
<P>     Las Vegas.  In Spanish, it's "the meadows."  Meadows where money
DOES grow on trees.  The politicians planted the seeds.  Organized
crime picked the fruit.</P>
<P>     Mob hirelings Lefty Rosenthal and Tony "The Ant" Spilotro were
among a host of crooks operating casinos and skimming the till for
out-of-state bosses.  Rosenthal, the superlative gambler was the
brains.  Spilotro, the muscle.  Though Martin Scorsese and
writer/journalist Nicholas Pileggi swapped names (Sam "Ace"  Rothstein
and Nicky Santoro); CASINO shadows Lefty and Ant's paradise flushed.</P>
<P>     Rothstein (Robert De Niro) is the mob's cash register, the
fictional Tangiers Casino frontman.  He minds the store, oversees
employees and patrons, puts out the trash (undesirables) and regulates
the take so the bosses get their cut.  He pulls the wool over
everyone's eyes.  The city, the press, the politicians hail him as a
community leader.  Rothstein is stunned. "Back home, they put me in
jail for what I'm doing.  Here, they give me awards," he says.</P>
<P>     Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) handles the "complications."  He
safeguards the investment.  The psychopathic pitbull cracks skulls and
if need be, buries troublemakers in the desert.  Dead rats don't chat.</P>
<P>     The green comes pouring in.  Bosses are happy counting the
profits.  Rothstein is content running the casino.  Everyone's
delirious save Santoro.  He craves the Big Score.  It's Las Vegas,
circa 1973.  Nobody's eyeballing the bank vault.  If you've got the
balls, they'll do everything but hold the door open as you loot the
joint.</P>
<P>     Santoro's gluttony rocks the boat and Rothstein treads water.
Dunking Rothstein are his pill-popping, booze-swilling, blood-sucking
tipsy wife Ginger (Sharon Stone) and her bottom feeding chum Lester
(James Woods).  The internal wrangling nukes Eden.</P>
<P>     Martin Scorsese loves the material.  You can tell.  It's in the
detailed plotting as Scorsese steers us behind the scenes.  A gambler
bets and loses, the cash is brought to the casino vault where it's
counted and packaged.  A middleman nabs the money (the "counters" look
the other way), fills a case, drives to the airport and boards a plane
to Kansas City, motors to a nondescript bakery and presents the case to
the bosses.  Scorsese and Pileggi have done more than their homework,
they've aced the final exam.</P>
<P>     It's in the performances Scorsese commands.  Parroting his
Goodfellas part, Joe Pesci talks tough and goes ape-shit.  We chuckle
and we cringe.  Under Scorsese's guidance, we observe what Sharon Stone
is capable of if she spends time concentrating on acting and not
doffing her duds.  CASINO is her foremost accomplishment.  Normally,
anyone wearing a flashy pink suit would have popcorn and spitballs
lobbed at them.  But this is De Niro and we wouldn't dare.</P>
<P>     It's in the realistic dialogue and violence.  De Niro and Pesci
relate their inner thoughts via narration.  The gritty, colourful,
witty dialogue underscores the biographical content, as does the
violence.  There are four brutal scenes that caused Yankee censors to
stain their pants and badger Scorsese with the dreaded NC-17 rating.
Scorsese doesn't fade to black or cut away.  Why should he? These are
gangsters, not Avon reps.  Gangsters commit repellent deeds.  Like it or
not, that's life.  That's reality.</P>
<P>     Censor Boards, why worry? We're adults.  We're potty trained.
Look ... we can even tie our shoelaces.  By fingering the violence, you
shelve the message.  The mob angle is actually the framework for a
morality tale.  Of how greed can corrupt, how love can blind and how
mistrust can poison any relationship.</P>
<P>     CASINO is rated M for Masterpiece.  Two exploding cars.
Gratuitous 70s blue eyeliner.  Ventilated craniums.  One head crushed
in a vice.  Guest star John Bloom (a.k.a. movie critic Joe Bob Briggs).
Two baseball bat attacks.  Blueberry muffins.  Gratuitous Frankie
Avalon.  No Wayne Newton.  Three old fossils (Steve Allan, Jayne
Meadows and Jerry Vale).  One Black and Decker hammer attack.  Pesci
Gin-Sus a drunk.  Half the Smothers Brothers.</P>
<P>Outreach Rating: 10 high rollers / 10.</P>
