<P>Like many of My Fellow Americans, my only real exposure to British
Humour has been through the occasional transplanted TV series made over
for an American audience, and through shows like BENNY HILL and
PRISONER: CELL BLOCK H (yes, I know it was Aussie, and a drama.  Hey,
work with me here).  All the more reason why I enjoyed CHICKEN RUN so
much: I didn't have the added burden of having the ready comparison to
its kin WALLACE AND GROMMIT or THE WRONG TROUSERS, for better or worse.
Without hesitation or excuse, I could (and did), in my Anglo-virgin
eyes, enjoy CHICKEN RUN for what it was.</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):</P>
<P>Life on the farm is anything but fun for dese hea' chicks.</P>
<P>Tired of being cooped up for her purchase of eggs (and of living in fear
that the axe will fall the day that her egg-production days are over),
Ginger (Julia Sawahla) dreams of freedom Somewhere Out There, away from
her oppressors, evil chicken farmer Mrs. Tweedy (Miranda Richardson) and
her henpecked husband Mr. Tweedy (Anthony Haygarth).  Ginger gets little
help from her fellow cacklers, featherbrained Babs (Jane Horrocks),
rough-and-tumble Bunty (Imelda Staunton), the scholarly Scotschick Mac
(Lynne Ferguson), or the old cock Fowler (Benjamin Whitrow), since most
of them are caught up in the slave mentality that tells them they are
destined to live out their lives in captivity.  But Ginger ain't havin'
it; and with the help of packrats Nick (Timothy Spall) and Fetcher (Phil
Daniels), and Rocky (Mel Gibson), a cocky flying Rhode Island rooster
who falls out of the sky and into their roost, Ginger believes she and
her chick friends might soon gain their freedom after all...</P>
<PRE>The Upshot:
Loverly.  Simply loverly.</PRE>
<P>CHICKEN RUN got the adult-to-children entertainment ratio right, even
moreso than TOY STORY 2 did--and TS2 was one of my top ten flicks of
1999, so you know that's saying a lot.   A good mix of clever allusions
to war flicks of the past (especially THE GREAT ESCAPE and STALAG 17),
plus quick nods to the likes of COOL HAND LUKE and Gibson's BRAVEHEART,
"Chicken" didn't forget to play for the kiddies as well--and it did so
without patronizing the children or insulting its older audience's
intelligence.  For every adult-type inside joke that went over the wee
tot's heads ("bend over and kiss your bum goodbye!"), there was a
message that could be easily grasped by the young ones.  Would that
DINOSAUR had been scripted by this team of folks; it might've been a
much different flick.</P>
<P>But that's too heavy a statement to make here.  The beauty of CHICKEN
RUN is that it was fun to watch, even with its non-bright colors (done
purposefully, I'd say, to denote a World War II-ish time period, as well
as the comparative bleakness of the setting).  In fact, not having seen
the aforementioned WALLACE AND GROMMIT yet (though I'll be remedying
that right soon, I reckon), I can easily compare it to another animated
favorite of mine, A BUG'S LIFE, in its attention to detail and
surrounding environment.  And, like "Bug" in its climax, "Chicken"
addresses the concept of teamwork, another good lesson for kids to take
away.   Not a shabby one for us adults either, come to think of it.</P>
<P>The animation technique used in CHICKEN RUN - claymation - worked
beautifully; there were only a few moments (primarily when the camera
was pulled back for a long shot) that the "drawings" seemed transparent
and the scene didn't look natural (as if a chicken with teeth, and hands
instead of wings, could possibly look natural).  Still, it was
head-and-shoulders above the schizo animation mix in TITAN A.E. with the
added benefit of looking less polished (and therefore, even more
believable) in its backgrounds.</P>
<P>But as good as the animation was, the voice characterizations were even
better; again, a welcome improvement over "Titan" and "Dinosaur" before
it.  Here, the characters were convincing in their chickdom (and let us
not forget about Nick and Fetcher's ratitude), and more important, the
actors seemed in-touch with their characters; they seemed to be having
fun with them.  From the sweet airheadedness of Jane Horrock as Babs
(her "How did you enjoy your Holiday?" as Ginger was brought back from
time in The Hole, had more sincerity in its English lilt than the same
line from an American Gen X actress could ever hope to deliver), to Phil
Daniels and Timothy Spall's delight in playing a couple'a rats, to Lynne
Ferguson's Mac and her playful nod to Scotty of STAR TREK fame, Julia
Sawahla's dogged determination as Ginger, and the overall image of
chickens running around like their heads were cut off - the actors and
their characters almost all worked for me.</P>
<P>Especially, much to my surprise, Mel Gibson.  After his mugging of the
camera in "Lethal Weapon"s 2, 3, and 4, I was ready to write off his
cute butt as one of those grossly overpaid movie stars who have more
money than talent.  As much as the producers balked at an American
"stealing the show" (it's been reported that the production team
insisted that the Yankee Rocky not be the hero here), that's exactly
what happened in any scene where Gibson laid on his considerable charms
as cocky Rocky.  It wasn't so much that the other actors were
lacking--they weren't--but Gibson just shined a wee bit brighter than
the rest, and most surprising of all, he didn't work that last nerve in
doing so.  But on the other end of the spectrum was Miranda Richardson
as Mrs. Tweedy; I know Richardson has the stuff of a good actress, but
in "Chicken", I just wasn't feelin' her.  Here, she was not only mean
enough, she also wasn't given enough lines, making her character seem
more a supporting player than the lead the story suggested.  A minor
quibble, to say the least; even at its worst, CHICKEN RUN just daggone
fun to watch.</P>
<P>The one head-scratcher I came away with was the attitude of the chickens
to their eggs.  One has to wonder if these chickens grasped the "where
do little chickens come from, mommy?" concept.  This, however, was
counterbalanced by the snicker-funny "which came first?" discussion
between rats Nick and Fetcher--which reminds me to remind you: never
leave an animated movie before the credits are over, or you might miss
something "special".</P>
<P>CHICKEN RUN is one of those flicks I look forward to seeing multiple
times with different age groups, to see the different vibes folks of all
ages get from it.  Can't wait to see it with my young cousins--and with
my mother.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
A clever, funny flick with a good sense of Brit style, and a
surprisingly good (without being overbearingly cloying) vocal
performance by Mel Gibson.  Claymation sure has come a long way since
"The California Raisins", eh?</P>
<P>CHICKEN RUN (rating: greenlight):
Now, who's up for a 2-piece and a biscuit?</P>
