Running Time: 94 minutes </P>
<P>Silly performances and some huge gaps in logic mar an otherwise
interesting tale of an eclectic group of people stranded at "The Last
Stop Cafe and Motel" due to heavy snowfall.  One of the stranded is a
Colorado State Highway Patrolman (Adam Beach) who discovers a murder
scene and a bag full of cash from a recent bank robbery.  Someone
amongst the group of strangers is a bank robber and a murderer, but is
it the same person or are there multiple criminals? </P>
<P>Adam Beach unfortunately was the wrong choice for the lead in this
film.  He doesn't play the role with enough seriousness to be believable
or enough goofiness for it to be funny.  His performance is stuck
somewhere in the middle, and this film really needed it to be on one
side or the other.  Rose McGowan is cold and unpleasant to the eye as
always, and Jurgen Prochnow... what on earth is he doing in this?  Best
performance comes from William S. Taylor as a cheesy (yet still somehow
cool and confident) Wayne Newton drifter type. </P>
<P>The Last Stop is available on DVD from Sterling Home Entertainment.  As
usual with Sterling, they've filled out this DVD with extra features. 
The disc contains the film in its original aspect ratio of 1.85:1, a
choice of 2.0 Dolby Surround Sound or 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound,
a full length audio commentary track with director Mark Malone,
interviews with the cast and crew, the original trailer, and the usual
cast and crew biographies. </P>
<P>The film itself might not be the greatest, but Sterling's effort of
adding decent extra features while keeping the price affordable
(suggested retail of $19.95) makes this DVD worth the money.  [R]</P>
