<P>When Rebel Without a Cause was released, it was a novelty.  It was one
of the very first mainstream films to depict the turmoil of
adolescence.  Prior to this movie, Hollywood avoided any difficult
themes and every family on screen was a template for the perfect, happy
American family.  The families in Rebel Without a Cause are not
perfect.  They all have their missteps.  I don't believe there is one
family in America that is as superficial and completely joyful as the
Brady Bunch and Rebel brings to light the tortures of parenthood and,
primarily, the tortures of youth.</P>
<P>Jim Stark (James Dean) is a teenager whose parents have moved around so
much just so he will get a chance to make good friends.  His parents are
good and affectionate and nurturing but they just don't understand him.
I suppose that it is difficult for any parent to understand the struggle
of a teenager because they have already passed that awful stage in life
and probably can't or don't want to recall it.  Jim's family is devoted
to him; they buy him whatever he desires but, as any teenager knows,
material things can never fill the sense of emptiness and frustration
that comes with the age.</P>
<P>We first meet Jim at the town's police station.  He has just been caught
drunk on the streets.  Rebel Without a Cause is not a spectacular
movie.  It is the power of several scenes that make the movie so good.
The first sequence is one such powerful moment.  When Jim's parents come
to pick him up at the station, his father comforts him, his mother
chides him, and his grandmother is a bit cold towards him.  He yells,
"You're tearing me apart!" and has a private talk with an officer at the
station who asks Jim to visit him if he feels the urge to do something
wrong again.  I think the brilliance of this scene lies in how honest it
is.  It doesn't sugarcoat as many movies do and it doesn't make the
teenage situation so extreme.  Though the dialogue seems a tad banal, it
brings to the surface wounding issues that plague my age group.</P>
<P>What struck me initially about this scene was when Jim tells the officer
the weaknesses of his father, who always allows his mother to mock and
step on him.  Later in the sequence we meet Judy (Natalie Wood) who was
found walking the streets alone at night.  She too is a teenager and
suffers from conflicts with her father.  He calls her a tramp and she
believes he hates her.  Teenagers take everything to heart and calling
your children ugly names will inevitably have an effect on them.  She,
like Jim, does not come from an indifferent family.  Her parents know
that adolescence is a painful stage but they have no idea how to help
her.</P>
<P>At school, Jim meets Judy and her gang friends.  They tease him with a
switchblade fight and invite him to a gathering that night on a
dangerous cliff.  Another thing that struck me about the character Jim
is that he doesn't want to get involved in trouble but he wants to prove
himself to his violent peers.  He accepts the invitation but later asks
his father what to do.  When his father has no answer, he turns angry.
What follows is the famous scene near the cliff in which the gang leader
and Jim measure who is more cowardly by seeing who will jump out of
their car first as it nears the edge of the cliff.  The gang leader is
killed.</P>
<P>Jim meets Plato (Sal Mineo), a social misfit who comes from a broken
family, and begins a strong friendship with him.  With Judy, whose
involvement in the gang is, of course, but a facade, Jim begins a
romance.  These three characters are lonely and without friends and they
create their own little world by caring for each other.  The climactic
sequence is both painful and saddening.</P>
<P>Rebel Without a Cause has been said to be about juvenile delinquency and
what spawns it, but, to me, it has never had anything to do with that
subject.  For me, it's always been about what troubles teenagers the
most: family, frustration, isolation, and the certain urge to prove
something.  James Dean, in his acclaimed debut, has been dubbed a Marlon
Brando for youth.  His performance as Jim Stark is splintering and so
sensitive.  He is not macho at all but he reflects what is nearly always
behind the tough exterior of young men.  Despite his tragic death two
movies later, he remains very much alive in our culture, an epitome of
anguish-ridden youth.  His image and his red jacket have become the
symbols of the distressed youth cry. This is by far his best
performance.  Natalie Wood gives a good performance here but would top
herself in Elia Kazan's Splendor in the Grass, an equally moving film
about adolescents struggling with sexuality. Sal Mineo plays the timid
Plato and he gives a career-changing performance.</P>
<P>Some say Rebel Without a Cause's elements are dated and, yes, several
elements are.  However, Rebel makes itself not about issues that
tortured teens in the ‘50s, but about the central, inner, sometimes
self-inflicted pains that plagued teens then and still, to this day,
plague teenagers.  That is why I can relate to Rebel and why generations
of youth will.  Rebel Without a Cause is not a great movie, but parts of
it are simply brilliant.  It is still one of the best teenage movies
ever made, though segments of Truffaut's The 400 Blows and many scenes
featuring Timothy Hutton in Ordinary People moved me, too.  Rebel
Without a Cause will be relevant for as long as adolescence remains the
period of angst.</P>
