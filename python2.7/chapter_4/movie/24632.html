<P>Sometimes we as critics judge a film to harshly.  Admit it.  We sometimes
look at a film and question its credibility but take a look at life.  Who
would have thought that we would ever see a trial like that of the famous
O.J. Simpson case.  If a script like that, with the events depicted in that
trial had been offered to the studios for consideration, it would have been
thrown in the garbage.  I constantly heard it in the media that no script
could be written this way, but truth, as they say, is sometimes stranger
than fiction.  So how then does a borderline burn out with three kids bring
a multi billion dollar corporation to its knees and rake in two million
dollars from the case herself.  That's the question you'll be following in
'Erin Brockovich', a truly great film with the best performance of Julia
Roberts' career.</P>
<P>First of all, this is a real life character.  Erin Brockovich obtained a job
as a clerk for a bottom of the heap law firm and helped in a case where a
corporate injustice struck people down in the prime of their lives.  It
opens as we see Erin in a car accident and her representation is carried out
by a law firm headed by a man named Ed Masry (Albert Finney).  Finney is
great in this role.  He takes on an American accent and like his fellow
countrymen from the UK who have tried it, such as Michael Caine, Bob Hoskins
and Kenneth Branagh, he is great at it.  Erin loses her case and is stuck
with large medical bills.  She hounds Ed's law firm to give her a job and
won't leave until she has one.</P>
<P>Her mannerisms in court, that of a highly profane nature, helped her lose
her case but her firey p*** and vinegar attitude is sorely needed when she
investigates a case that the law firm is considering handling.  A property
case comes to her attention and she finds that the water pollution around
it, carried out by the neglect of a billion dollar corporation, can infect a
person's DNA to the extent of causing death.  This movie comes a little more
than a year after 1998's 'A Civil Action' entertained audiences in a much
more subtle manner with similar subject matter but 'Erin Brockovich' has a
protagonist who is determined to win.  She uses her feminine ways, such as
short dresses and skirts and plenty of cleavage to get the information she
wants from men.</P>
<P>I haven't really cared for Steven Soderbergh's films much over the years.
His over rated effort 'Out of Sight' from 1998 was too stilted to truly
enjoy with some actors in roles way over their heads.  1989's 'Sex. Lies and
Videotape' and last year's 'The Limey' are probably his best films but 'Erin
Brockovich' is a close rival to these films for Soderbergh.  The real beauty
of the film is the way Soderbergh pays close attention to detail and makes
every scene extremely believable in the pursuit of a small law firm taking
on a gigantic monster of a company and doing a good job of it.  It shouldn't
be too hard to figure out the ending of the film but films of this nature
rarely end any other way, especially with big Hollywood stars not wanting to
cheat their fans but I'm still not giving away the extraordinary details of
how the case ends up.</P>
<P>Erin involves herself with a guy named George (Aaron Eckhart), and this
needless romantic sub plot is probably what prevents the movie from earning
a four star rating but you can't have everything I suppose.  The film also
boasts performances from actors such as Peter Coyote, Conchata Ferrell, and
Marg Helgenberger and these roles could help their careers greatly.</P>
<P>With all of the advanced press Julia Roberts has been getting for this film,
I can't leave this review without mentioning the excellent work by Albert
Finney who should be Oscar nominated if Roberts is and both of them
certainly deserve it at this point.  Finney is a guy who has been nominated
four times the Oscar between 1963 and 1984 and all of the nominations have
come in leading roles.  His first role was in 1960's 'Saturday Night and
Sunday Morning' and David Lean wanted Finney for the leading Peter O'Toole
part in 'Lawrence of Arabia'.  He is one of the most under rated of the
British actors who makes a great comeback in this movie.</P>
<P>Julia Roberts proves here that she earns every penny of her salary and
audiences can revel in the fact that with so many disappointments early in
2000, this film is one of the early year gems that will carry it's quality
to next year's Oscar ceremonies.  Let's keep our fingers crossed.</P>
<PRE>OUT OF 4 > * * * 1/2</PRE>
<P>A film must receive a three star rating or higher to be eligible for a
recommendation.</P>
