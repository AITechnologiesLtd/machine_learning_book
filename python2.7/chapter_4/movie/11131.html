<PRE>LIVE FLESH
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1998 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>***1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>        "Live Flesh."  Vintage Almodóvar.</PRE>
<P>        A standoff.  A man holds a woman, a diplomat's daughter, hostage in
his embrace, a gun pressed to her head.  A cop, impaired by drink due to
his wife's philandering, trains his gun on the man's nether regions,
threatening to shoot.  Another cop holds his gun to his partner's temple,
forcing him to disarm.  The scene unfolds like a foursome bidding in
bridge--upping the ante, signaling tacitly, going for game.  The second cop
retrieves the first cop's weapon, the suspect lowers his, and the woman
caught in the middle moves--in slow motion--to safety.  It is then that the
intoxicated officer makes his move, grabbing for the assailant's gun.  The
room turns upside down, a shot rings out, a cop is down.  Shot in the back
and paralyzed for life.  The young man who found himself in the wrong place
at the wrong time is sent to prison for six years for a crime he didn't
commit.</P>
<P>        Storytelling has always been one of Pedro Almodóvar's greatest
gifts and in "Live Flesh" he gives us a twisting, turning, compelling tale
peppered with well-written, colorful characters.  Characters who find
themselves, more often than not, in carefully-constructed scenes like
these.  Characters played by actors we might not know, but who look
strikingly familiar nevertheless.</P>
<P>        Take the ruggedly handsome Victor Plaza (Liberto Rabal), for
instance.  Before he gets out of prison he could easily be mistaken for
that Almodóvar favorite, Antonio Banderas.  When we first meet Elena
(Francesca Neri), the woman in the middle of the nervous shakedown, she
looks like Spice Girl Barbie with her frizzy shock of orange hair, but
later tones down her look sufficiently to pass for Juliette Lewis.  Elena's
husband David (Javier Bardem) is the cop crippled in the shooting and he
wears David Schwimmer's bemused expression throughout.  Playing the
inebriated cop and his cheating wife are José Sancho and Angela Molina--no
lookalikes spring to mind, but they round out the excellent cast.</P>
<P>        It's a credit to Almodóvar's craft that these five individuals
cross paths and intertwine with such credulity.  "Live Flesh" begins and
ends with a live birth and the film's contradictions come almost as often
as the contractions.  Between the two childbearings, coincidence, irony,
and a hefty dollop of sex form the key elements of this thoroughly
entertaining film.</P>
<P>        Although based on a Ruth Rendell story, "Live Flesh" is brimming
with the acclaimed Spanish director's high-heeled flourishes.  Women are at
times alluring and repulsive, their extravagant hairdos and animal print
coats providing colorful highlights to the intricately-woven drama, an eye
bruised by an abusive husband here, a mouth bloodied by an impromptu
delivery there.  While in prison, Victor learns Bulgarian from an inmate
and learns to love the Bible, quoting from Deuteronomy thereafter not
unlike the way by which David and Sancho refer to themselves as "guardians
of a sick flock."  Victor's pre-fab inheritance is a shambles in a slum
resembling Sarajevo.  "Dear son, I got cancer" his mother writes to him in
jail.  She dies before he is released and it's at the cemetery that Victor
is reacquainted with Elena--redemption, ultimately, substituting for
revenge.</P>
<PRE>        Touching, funny, sexy.  Classic Almodóvar.  "Live Flesh."</PRE>
