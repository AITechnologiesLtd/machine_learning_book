<PRE>"ELECTION" - A Thumbs For Sale! Review</PRE>
<P>w/ MATTHEW BRODERICK, REESE WITHERSPOON, CHRIS KLEIN
DIR: ALEXANDER PAINE</P>
<P>Maybe consciously I was simply avoiding any film with even the vaguest
hint of cyber-anything. Or perhaps unconsciously I'm hopelessly stuck
on titles that begin with the letter "E" (as in last week's review of
"Entrapment"). Whatever the case, I'm not the least bit sorry I chose
to duck in out of the sun and catch a  Saturday afternoon matinee of
"Election."</P>
<P>Senior Tracy Flick (Witherspoon) is the reigning Miss Apple Pie of the
Free World. Everything she wants, she pretty much gets. And everything
she gets, she pretty much deserves. So, getting elected president of
the student body should be little more challenging than copping a
smoke in the girls room in between third and fourth period.
At least that's the way she sees it.</P>
<P>Of course, being quite the perfect specimen (she's the type who on at
least one occasion probably wore her 4-H ribbons pinned to her
cardigan for school pictures), she's got ten perfect little toes, all
of which are just waiting to be stepped on.</P>
<P>Enter Jim McAllister (Broderick), three-time educator of the year and
student council advisor. He's got a wife he can't seem to get
pregnant, lust in his heart for the divorcee who lives across the
street, an aging Ford Festiva (one of the greatest self-esteem killing
auto designs in the history of motorized transportation), and a
nascent disgust with Ms. Flick.</P>
<P>Expect the shenanigans to begin momentarily.</P>
<P>When the Man Who Was Once Ferris declares war, you suddenly realize
you're in for one heck of an interesting ride. Director/co-writer
Payne and cast absolutely bond to create one of the more piercing
satires in recent memory. The script is so streamlined that it's no
less than positively aerodynamic. Not a single moment isn't accounted
for as the pieces of the puzzle come together. Big laughs emerge from
around unexpected corners. The allegory at hand is firmly anchored by
a foundation so sturdy it must have been constructed by union labor.
Not to mention the casting director deserves no less than a State
Dinner at the White House.</P>
<P>Witherspoon is so perfect as Flick that at one point I feared she
might slap me upside the head with an apple pie. The shear depth of
her unctuousness will forever make you think twice about accepting a
complimentary cupcake from anyone less than your best friend. If she
burst into tears within earshot, you'd cross a street during rush hour
without looking both ways to offer her a shoulder to cry on. As
student body president, she would undoubtedly wield enough power to
convince the lot of us to chuck pizza and pay more attention to
getting in our three squares a day.</P>
<P>Broderick thoroughly becomes quite the slightly downtrodden
proletarian next door. But  the moment he senses his big chance to
really "make a difference," that malicious demeanor he perfected all
those years ago as Ferris Bueller takes on a whole new dimension.
While it's safe to say all the characters here are somewhat flawed in
character, he is in many ways the most believable.</P>
<P>The rest of the cast is filled out mostly by first-timers and
unknowns. Chris Klein as a Keanu Reeves Jr. clone more than proves
that a thoroughly vapid aptitude shouldn't stop one from running for
office. Jessica Campbell as his sister, the third candidate in the run
for the roses, clearly illustrates that getting a little political
during your tender sophomore year really isn't a bad thing--especially
if having vaguely diabolical leanings are an integral part of your
fabric. And finally, Phil Reeves as the hapless
ringmaster--er--principal... No need to say more here; he's a walking
laugh factory.</P>
<P>Payne and collaborator Jim Taylor have successfully mined the fields
of political satire once before with "Citizen Ruth" (1996), which I
coincidentally just caught on video a couple weeks ago. While that
little morality tale about the tug-of-war between pro-life and
pro-choice fronts was entertaining enough, it was in many ways more
interesting than effective. "Election" is quite the quantum step
forward.</P>
<P>For all practical purposes, "Election" is a civics lesson with one big
advantage over your rank-and-file lesson plan; it's built-in fun
factor is actually worth dropping a few bucks to check out.</P>
