<PRE>.                                WAG THE DOG
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1998 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Another year-end flick with another four-star rating?  What, am I nuts,
or just some corporate tool shilling for would-be Oscar contenders?</P>
<P>     Never mind that I am saving up all my *real* praise for SPICEWORLD next
week... I'll try to lay it on again for WAG THE DOG.  It's a great little
premise: what would happen if you tried to produce a phony war as a diversion
away from a lecherous President's leisure time?  A lot of wacky hijinks, from
the looks of it!  With everything from a "We Are the World" parody to a
memorial for a P.O.W., WAG THE DOG is really just a send-up of America's
fascination with war from WWII through the Gulf War, where combat truly became
a ridiculous exercise in soundbites and TV footage.</P>
<P>     The story is good, the comedy is goofy but still solid, but it's Dustin
Hoffman that is the crown jewel of the film, hamming it up as a kind of C.C.
De Mille-meets-Liberace egomaniac/movie producer.  De Niro's understated
cover-up man is also good, and Anne Heche's Prince Valiant haircut is
interesting, at the very least.</P>
<P>     Finally, the commentary on our society is pretty rich, and I can't help
but think that a lot of people are going to be subtly offended by this movie. 
I think that pleases me most of all.  You see, as WAG THE DOG states, modern
war really is a "pageant."  It's more dangerous to drive to work than hit the
front lines... if there are any lines, that is.  Is it live, or is it Memorex?
 What's the difference?</P>
<PRE>     Enjoy.</PRE>
