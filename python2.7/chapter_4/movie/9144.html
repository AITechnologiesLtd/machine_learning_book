                      MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
      3 Big  :-) :-) :-)  for Julia the bridesmaid, never the bride</PRE>
<P>Cast: Julia Roberts, Dermot Mulroney, Cameron Diaz, Rupert Everett,
Philip Bosco, M. Emmet Walsh, Carrie Preston, Rachel Griffiths Director:
P.J. Hogan Screenplay: Ronald Bass</P>
<P>If I'm not married by twenty-eight, I'm NOT going to marry my best
friend cause I don't think it's legal. If Julianne (Julia Roberts) isn't
married by twenty eight she IS going to marry her best friend Michael
(Dermot Mulroney). Legally possible, personality compatible, wonderful,
except .... he's met somebody else.</P>
<P>Julianne was the centre of Michael's life 9 years ago. After splitting
with him, they have remained friends with the vague memory of a promise
of marriage, if still single by 28. Jules doesn't realise that she is
still in love with Michael until 3 weeks before her 28th birthday; when
he calls to tell her that he's getting married, and asks if she would
come to give him emotional support before the big day. Suddenly,
feelings of jealousy are awoken in her, as she sets out to win Michael
back in every underhanded way possible.</P>
<P>Yes, Julia Roberts is the BAD GUY. The fly in the Chardonet, the rain on
a wedding day, the good advice that you shouldn't take - isn't it
ironic? If cupid had a quiver full of arrows, they would probably all be
sticking in his little butt right now if Julianne had anything to do
with it. Which is the reason why I like this movie. It's a great
learning experience for those wishing to sabotage weddings, and failed.
Away with the simple 'I object' and in with karaoke aptitude tests, gay
fiancees, falsified E-mail and wicked lies. I would also have
recommended laxatives, but that's too cruel even for me, not on a
wedding day.</P>
<P>So these are the tests that true love faces, when a very jealous best
friend does not get her way. In this subtle competition for the groom,
the bride Kimmy (Cameron Diaz) carries with her the girdle of bright
eyed sincere innocence, whilst her rival maid of honour wields the magic
of brains and beauty. So with whom shall I side? They both love him
soooo much. How can one win without the other getting hurt. If I had to
take sides, I can only let my conscience guide me. I have always
believed that the motive behind every action, is the most important
reason behind a  good relationship. Sorry Jules you lose. But if I had
my way with the plot - Kimmy gets Michael, and Jules ends up with Rupert
- who makes an exception to his rule, and changes his sexual orientation
the last minute. Not likely, but an interesting idea - cause we'd have
something of a 'Chasing Amy' - Oh dear! Now if Shakespeare had his way
with this tale of jealousy, it would probably have ended up with four
dead bodies - now that would have been funny.</P>
<P>Director Hogan has once again decided to fill his 'wedding' movies with
catchy tunes, making the marital experience a joyful ride. Julia is back
in sparkling form, with an effervescent smile and long curly red hair.
She has once again left mankind panting for more. Her every look carries
with it an easy charm reminiscent of Rita Hayworth in her hey day. Yes,
beauty and humour makes this particular lady prettier still. Cameron
Diaz carries herself well against the stiff competition, whose
performance at a karaoke bar will be painfully remembered. Dermot
Mulroney is the ever likeable object of desire for both women, whose
bland personality makes him the ideal reliable husband that every woman
looks for; but it is Rupert Everett who steals the movie's funniest
moments with his wry wit, humorous tale telling and spontaneous singing
- making this wedding party a curious gem of rare sorts.</P>
