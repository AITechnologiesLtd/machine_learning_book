<P>Legally Blonde (2001). 2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Reese Witherspoon, Luke
Wilson, Selma Blair, Matthew Davis, Victor Garber, Jennifer Coolidge, Holland
Taylor, Ali Larter, Jessica Cauffiel, Alanna Ubach, Oz Perkins, Linda
Cardellini, Bruce Thomas, Meredith Scott Lynn and Raquel Welch. Screenplay by
Karen McCullah Lutz & Kirsten Smith. Based on a book by Amanda Brown. Directed
by Robert Luketic. 96 minutes. Rated PG-13. </P>
<P>Star quality is that intangible gift that simultaneously enables  performers to
rise above their material as well as elevate projects - no matter their
shortcomings - on the weight of their talent. </P>
<P>With Legally Blonde, Reese Witherspoon shows that she is such a performer. </P>
<P>Legally Blonde is a very appealing feature despite its stock situation and
clichéd and stereotypical characters. </P>
<P>The feature's charm rests squarely on Witherspoon's lovely shoulders. In films
such as Cruel Intentions, Pleasantville and especially Election, Witherspoon has
demonstrated her keen acting ability. However, it was not necessary in any of
those films for her to carry the burden of the projects' success or failure. </P>
<P>But this bubbly comedy is different. From opening scene to final fadeout, this
is Witherspoon's baby, and, as Elle Woods, she delivers. As played by
Witherspoon, Elle is no dumb blonde. </P>
<P>She's an achiever, a go-getter but without the pathological drive of her
Election's Tracey Flick. Elle,  a senior at CULA, is president of her Delta Nu
sorority, has a 4.0 G.P.A. - her major is fashion design - appeared in a Ricky
Martin video and was a runner-up in the Miss Hawaiian Tropic contest. </P>
<P>Elle is a warm, loving person. But because she is very perky, blonde and
beautiful, no one takes her seriously. Her boyfriend, Warner, dumps her on his
way to Harvard Law School, because he plans to run for the Senate and Elle is
not his nor his family's picture of a senator's perfect wife. "I need a Jackie,
not a Marilyn," he tells her upon dumping her. </P>
<P>Elle, to win him back, determinedly works her way into Harvard Law School,
creating a dynamite video essay (directed by a Coppola) to impress the all-male
admissions board. At first, her stuck up East Coast classmates treat her as a
joke, but Elle, despite some setbacks, proves her worthiness and wins the day. </P>
<P>In a sense, Legally Blonde is a movie about perceptions. It's one of those
don't-judge-a-book-by-its-cover life lessons. The movie says nothing new nor
profound. As Elle complains, People just "see my blonde hair and my big boobs."
Legally Blonde is a pleasing pastiche about self-worth and self-confidence. </P>
<P>Witherspoon gives a finely honed performance. She's ebullient, quick-witted and
a rather nice person. She is sensitive and caring, and even though she looks
clueless, she's not. Witherspoon uses makeup and wardrobe to deflect from Elle's
intelligence, but allows you to see it in her eyes. </P>
<P>The rest of the cast merely lives in her shadow. Matthew Davis is rather bland
as Warner, and it is difficult to understand why Elle is so infatuated with him.</P>
<P>Some memorial turns are provided by Oz Perkins as one of Elle's dorky, but
brainy, classmates and Ali Larter as a murder suspect Elle comes to defend. </P>
<P>The lawyers in the audience may cringe at some of the courtroom antics, but keep
in mind that this is a comedy not Anatomy of a Murder. </P>
<P>Legally Blonde is a fun summer date movie, a lightweight enjoyable outing that
in its own sneaky way will make you think twice before judging someone merely by
their appearance. </P>
