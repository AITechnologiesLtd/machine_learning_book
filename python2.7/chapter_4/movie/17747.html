<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
3 and a half stars</P>
<P>Standard horror films keep characters and their actions in check.  They
produce shrieks and squeals from violence that is either meaningless or
irrelevant, and rarely look at what motives evil actions.  It is sort of
an irony that Stephen King - whom you may expect would produce this sort
of stuff - wrote the novella on which Apt Pupil is based.  Brandon Boyce
has skillfully adapted King's work and made it accessible for the big
screen, while director Brian Singer (who astonished audiences with The
Usual Suspects) and the film's performers give it impact.  The result is
a subversive and gripping experience; one that crawls under your skin
and stays there.  Sometimes disturbing, at other times merely
entertaining, this is a solid piece that grounds itself in a truly
frightening subject matter, but occasionally deviates into ordinary
urban scenarios.</P>
<P>Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro) is an apt pupil.  He is a straight A's student
who is destined to top his class.  After a week of learning about the
Holocaust, Todd is fascinated - so much so that he immerses himself in
extra-curriculum study of the era.  In his research, he discovers an
incredible secret that nobody else has: Nazi war criminal Kurt Dussander
(Sir Ian McKellen) has been quietly living in Todd's hometown under the
assumed name of Arthur Denker.  Denker has lived a quiet, uneventful
life - until now.  Todd confronts Denker and blackmails him with a deal
he can't refuse - Todd will keep silent about his true identity, and in
return Denker must tell him about the atrocities he committed in the
war.  Thus a dangerous relationship begins, in which Todd learns
valuable lessons about having the upper hand.</P>
<P>The character of Kurt Dussander is one of the most fascinating in recent
years.  His fragile elderly body is deceiving, as is his serene
existence.  As Todd unlocks Dussander's memories, he also unlocks the
man's true character - his sinister actions have obviously only been in
hibernation.  Sir Ian McKellen brings Dussander to life with eerie
skill, and Brad Renfro is also great as a teenager whose world is turned
topsy-turvy.  McKellen and Renfro first appear to be a hostile odd
couple, but as the plot goes along Singer draws parallels.  There is no
hero in this story, nor is there a bad guy.  Apt Pupil makes it quite
clear that everybody has the capacity for evil - the temptation to
perform wicked deeds is as much alive in Nazi war veterans as it is in
youth.</P>
<P>The film's most chilling moments are when we learn of Dussander's dark
past.  In one scene he explains in explicit detail what the gassing
chambers were like - though it is purely dialogue, a painful visual
illustration is carved.  Had the film followed this rapid psychological
momentum, it may have been a mind-rousing classic. But Singer deviates
too often from his exhilarating central plot.  In comparison to the
nightmares of war told by one of its fomenters, the slip of Todd's
school grades seems woefully uninspired.  But still, this film is often
a powerful examination on what drives people to commit evil actions.
Apt Pupil is a must see for anybody who ever thought a horror film can't
have a brain or a heart.  Though far from perfect, this film evokes a
morbid fascination that is hard to shake.</P>
