<PRE>THE COLOR OF GOD (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>"God is not visible."</PRE>
<PRE>3 out of ****</PRE>
<P>Original Title: Rang E-Khoda
Starring Mohsen Ramezani, Hossein Mahjub, Salime Feizi, Elham Sharifi;
Written & Directed by Majid Majidi;
Cinematography by Mohammad Davudi</P>
<P>        The children in Majid Majidi's films seem to exist, at times, in a
state of grace, an earthly Eden where their experience of the world is
whole and uncorrupted.  Their perceptions are not filtered through
politics, sexuality, economics, prejudice, or other adult concerns.  The
world is there, and they are in it--they ask for no more.  Their actions
are motivated by love and selflessness, by reverence for creation.  They
are, to borrow the title of Majidi's previous work, the children of heaven.</P>
<P>        Such is the case for Mohammad, a young boy who happens to be blind,
but whose other senses are keenly attuned to the sounds and smells and
surfaces around him.  His teacher once told him that God favours the blind,
and while Mohammad--reasonably enough--questions this logic, at times we
understand what the teacher means, because Mohammad seems to experience the
undiluted essence of the world in a sensual communion which we could only
dream of sharing.</P>
<P>        Early in the film, Mohammad hears the cries of a chick which has
fallen out of its nest in a tree onto the grass below.  Acting by sound and
touch alone, he scares off a cat which is closing in for the kill, locates
the defenseless little creature, shinnies up the tree, and returns the
chick to its nest.   This tender moment may mean little in the grand scheme
of things, but it resonates with a sense of the interconnectedness of all
life.  And because this is a deeply religious film, implicit in the scene
is the notion that just as Mohammad cradles the chick in his hands and
lifts it to its place up in the tree, we too are cradled in the nurturing
hands of God, and will be lifted up to Heaven.</P>
<P>        Or perhaps not.  Mohammad's life is not easy.  Blissfully Edenic as
it seems at times, Mohammad nevertheless inhabits the secular world, where
the Word of God, if it exists, is written in invisible ink.  His mother
died several years ago.  His father does not want the burden of caring for
him.  At the beginning of the film, the father urges a teacher at his son's
school to care for the boy, claiming that he cannot manage on his own.  But
Mohammad's grandmother and sister care deeply for him, and when he returns
to his rural home at the end of the school term they are delighted to see
him.  We discover that the father is not concerned about his inability to
provide adequate care for his child, but rather is worried that having a
blind son will cause a setback to his plans to remarry.</P>
<P>        The movie is sweet and joyous in its contemplation of the
children's lives--innocent without being cloyingly cute--but it does not
ignore the troubles that complicate those lives.  The children are limned
by clouds of glory, but Mohammad's father is a tired, selfish, unhappy man,
beset by poverty and sorrow.  There is no childhood, no heaven, left in
him, and he cannot appreciate what it is that makes Mohammad's life
meaningful.  He cruelly insists that his son go to study carpentry with a
blind carpenter, taking him away from his sister and grandmother.  He
claims that he is acting in Mohammad's interests, but the grandmother sees
right through him.  She herself is another delightful character, but her
health is failing, and she serves as a reminder that even the children of
heaven are mortal in this world.</P>
<P>        THE COLOR OF GOD is not so much a story as an act of devotion.
Majidi concentrates on natural unembellished images, and allows us to
contemplate them until they take on a kind of spiritual depth.  He allows
us to share Mohammad's perceptions, to some extent, by holding the camera
steady and filtering out unnecessary sounds so that our attention is
focused on the noises the blind boy hears: woodpeckers in the forest,
seagulls crying above the roar of surf on the beach.  A sense of the
vibrancy of the living world is impressed upon us: close-ups of touching
hands, a dying fish being returned to its pool of water, a butterfly caught
momentarily in a girl's palm.  The movie reminds us of the delights of
simple things, and makes them seem almost sanctifying.</P>
<P>        The serene, hymnal mood is disrupted in the climactic sequence,
which forces a crisis in the relationship between Mohammad and his father.
It is an exciting and tense finale, but comes as a shock, and is rather
contrived, forcing closure upon a film which does not need it.  It does,
however, lead to a remarkable final shot which perhaps justifies the shift
in tone.  On a literal level, what we see is ambiguous, but its
significance is as clear and pure as the bells that ring out at the end of
BREAKING THE WAVES.  There is no question: it is, like the film as a whole,
an act of unadulterated faith in a world where a father--or perhaps
Father--allows his children to doubt his love.</P>
