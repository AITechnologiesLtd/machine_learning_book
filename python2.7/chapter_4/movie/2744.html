<PRE>                                    TRUE LIES
                       A film review by Jon A. Webb
                        Copyright 1994 Jon A. Webb</PRE>
<P>     TRUE LIES is the kind of movie LAST ACTION HERO tried to be: a
clever, inventive variation on the action movie.  It succeeds where
LAST ACTION HERO failed because here we actually care about the hero:
he's a real person, with a family, even if his adventures as a spy are
hardly believable.</P>
<P>     Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a spy whose cover is that he is a
insipid computer salesman.  Jaime Lee Curtis, who plays his wife,
believes his cover and finds her life dull enough to consider having an
affair with a used car salesman who pretends to be a spy.</P>
<P>     The plot is a little too cute, like LAST ACTION HERO, but it gives
a minimally acceptable context for the action in the film, which is
where the heart of the movie is.  The important thing is that this
context supports all sorts of jokes that normally wouldn't appear in an
action film.  This, and the incredibly good effects (I'm still trying
to figure out how they made it appear that they blew up part of that
bridge--it couldn't be real, could it?) make this a highly
entertaining film, not only for fans of Arnold Schwarzenegger.</P>
<P>     N.B. To appreciate this film you have to accept the usual conceit
of action films, which is that of the lone good man battling against
evil all around him.  In other reviews I've seen, plainly the reviewer
didn't do this.  If you can't handle stereotypes in the context of an
action film, you won't appreciate this film; you'll find it racist (all
the bad guys are Arab terrorists) and brutal (people die routinely;
women are abused).  Schwarzenegger and Curtis turn in the solid
performances you'd expect of them from their previous work.  Tom Arnold,
who plays Schwarzenegger's side-kick, is a real surprise; he's fresh,
funny, and a good part of the reason the film is so entertaining.  He's
just the right choice for this role, after which he should be taken
seriously as a comic actor.  For example, he'd be a great choice to take
over O.J.'s part in the "Naked Gun" series.</P>
<P>     The direction (by James Cameron) is tight and makes good use of
rapidly improving effects technology.  The script is over-written, with
a little more intellectual appeal than is really necessary.
Schwarzenegger and Curtis are in fine form.  All in all, a fine
effort.</P>
