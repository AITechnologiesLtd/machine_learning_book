<P>         There's a segment of the moviegoing public some theater
managers refer to as the Ohmigods. They're young women between the ages
of 11 and 15 -- that pre-dating period -- who flock to the cineplexes
every Friday night or Saturday afternoon to see the latest Freddie
Prinze Jr. or Joshua Jackson film and to discuss their peers. Their
comments often sound something like this: "Ohmigod, she is getting so
fat!"; "Ohmigod, he looks just like Josh Hartnett!"; "Ohmigod, 'Oops, I
Did It Again' is, like, the best song ever!"</P>
<P> The Ohmigods will love "Center Stage," which was clearly
designed with them in mind. It has lots of graceful and sometimes
teasingly erotic dancing, a variety of attractive youthful stars, and a
plot that can be easily followed, even if you spend long stretches of
the movie talking to your best friend about how hot Brandon looked in
geometry class or how Trina totally embarrassed herself at the party
last week.</P>
<P> Screenwriter Carol Heikkinen apparently spent more time
studying "42nd Street" and "Gold Diggers of 1933" than she did
researching what aspiring ballet dancers actually go through in their
struggle to get into the spotlight. So "Center Stage" shamelessly hauls
out every trick in the dusty old musical comedy book, from the scolding
stage mother who pushes her daughter onto the boards to the chorus girl
who miraculously gets to play the lead when the star drops out at the
last minute.</P>
<P> Stop me if you've heard this one before: Bright-eyed Jody
Sawyer (Amanda Schull) lands a slot at the American Ballet Academy,
alongside "everyone who matters in American ballet." Heck, one of her
fellow students even gave up the promise of a job at Hooters to go to
ABA, so you know it must be something special.</P>
<P> Jody's classmates include Eva (Zoe Saldana), the requisite
smart-mouth who violates the dress code and hides her bruised heart;
Maureen (Susan May Pratt), who's hailed by everyone as the Next Big
Thing; Sergei (Ilia Kulik), the Russian who loves to party; and Charlie
(Sascha Radetsky), the nice guy from Seattle who's too shy to tell Jody
he's in love with her. So Jody eventually drifts into the arms of vain
Cooper Nielsen (Ethan Stiefel), who changes partners as often as he
changes leotards.</P>
<P> Does Jody have enormous difficulty fitting in? Does one kid
turn out to be bulimic? Does a character tell another, "whatever you
feel, just dance it"? Does someone proclaim, "I'm not dancing for them
anymore -- I'm dancing for myself"?</P>
<P> You need not see "Center Stage" to correctly guess the answers
to those questions.</P>
<P>  Most of the cast run into problems convincingly reading their
dialogue, but that's not much of a drawback since director Nicholas
Hytner routinely stops the story for lengthy, smoothly executed dance
sequences that will make any aspiring ballerinas in the audience want to
take some extra lessons.</P>
<P> While it's hardly revolutionary, Susan Stroman's choreography
is the driving force behind the film, and the main reason to sit through
it. Every time the movie threatens to put us to sleep, Stroman throws in
a revitalizing scene, such as the Broadway dance class workout
underscored by Mandy Moore's bubblegum-pop treasure "Candy" and the Red
Hot Chili Peppers' pulse-pounding "Higher Ground."</P>
<P> "Center Stage" wraps up with a supremely weird rock
ballet/pantomime that sets the story of "The Red Shoes" first to the
dreary music of Michael Jackson, then to the dynamic sounds of
Jamiroquoi. It's supposed to be part of a big stage show, although the
spectacle includes so many sets and split-second costume changes it
could only happen in the movies. The number somehow manages to get a
standing ovation from an audience of tough critics. "Center Stage"
itself isn't likely to get quite the same response. James Sanford</P>
