<P>The Jane-Austen-goes-to-Hollywood craze has subsided, but Austen has a
replacement, it seems, in Henry James; with last fall's "Portrait of a
Lady, and this fall's "Wings of the Dove," "Washington Square" represents
one of three James novels to hit the silver screen lately. But though the
treatment of them by Hollywood may be superficially similar--sumptuous
costumes, elaborate sets, a liberal dose of British acting--James and
Austen could hardly be more different: whereas Austen's novels are largely
comedies with some character development but little social critique
(Austen's villains are products of the same milieu as her heroes, and
their failings tend to be conventional human faults rather than anything
emblematic of their societies), James generally has different priorities.
Put another way, one can rely on the plot to keep the audience entertained
in an adaptation of an Austen film, but taking James' stories as a basis
for a film is less than a sure thing. </P>
<P>Director Agnieszka Holland accordingly takes some liberties with
"Washington Square," though far fewer than Jane Campion's "Portrait"--and,
as it happens, far more successfully. The story is fairly simple:
Catherine Sloper (Jennifer Jason Leigh), plain and shy, falls for
penniless socialite Morris Townsend (Ben Chaplin), but her father Austin
(Albert Finney), suspecting that Morris is out for Catherine's
considerable wealth, threatens to disinherit her should the two marry.
This is the stuff of countless uninteresting films and novels, on the one
hand, but James has more in mind than the average writer, and the plot
reflects it; the focus is as much on the illusions associated with
romantic love as on its virtues, and the father is as compelling--and, in
a way, as sympathetic--as the suitor. And Holland, in her turn, puts her
stamp on the story; what was a fairly pessimistic ending becomes more
hopeful, with a distinctly feminist element. The initial scene, set up by
a skillful and elaborate tracking shot, depicts Catherine's birth and her
mother's resulting death, and Holland illustrates in it the relationship
that is central to the film.</P>
<P>Leigh has, to say the least, played a motley crew of neurotics and damaged
souls--but it is here, where her scars are displayed by facial tics and
barely visible body language, that her acting genuinely shines. Whereas in
films like "Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle" and "Georgia" she was
given room to express pain loudly and angrily, there are few such moments
here--but those few moments (at the reading of her father's will,
following Morris' carriage along a muddy street) are all the more
effective. When she declines Morris' invitation to dance, her
movements--looking down, twisting away--say as much as any lines could.
Leigh's delivery has been described as "lockjaw"--a promising career in
ventriloquism awaits her should she give up acting--but the murmuring
serves to reinforce her character's shyness here. Her awkwardness is
equally well realized; in dropping a pile of papers and clumsily
scrambling around picking them up, she conveys the humiliation of the
moment. Leigh's face is immensely expressive; watching her closely yields
real insight into her character's conflicts. And she does manage to
develop the character over the course of the film; her final confrontation
with her father is both dramatic and thoroughly believable.</P>
<P>The other performances are, mostly, strong. Finney goes well beyond 
conventional father-villain in portraying Austin: though we see his
limitations, we also see where they come from. His grief for his wife
keeps him from relating to his daughter fully: the gulf between them is
established in the first scene and reinforced in a variety of ways
thereafter. But the audience never doubts the genuineness of his grief,
nor that his distance from his daughter saddens him. This is a flawed
character, not a monster, and there is much more to his resistance to
Catherine's marriage than malice. Chaplin, for his part, does well with
the ambiguities of his character--though the final revelation is not as
believable as it might be, and the concluding scene between Morris and
Catherine feels a bit incongruous, it is possible throughout to understand
how Catherine can see him as a good-hearted boy while her father considers
him a parasite. Maggie Smith is as effective as usual as Catherine's
fluttery, sentimental Aunt Lavinia, though her character has little to do
with the central plot and sometimes feels more like a device for comic
relief.</P>
<P>The appeal of "Washington Square," particularly for those who want 
something more than authentic costumes and backdrops in a period piece,
lies in the way it subverts expectations. Catherine begins the film as an
awkward wallflower, but, for once, that is not a signal that she will soon
become a society belle; though her confidence grows as the film
progresses, she is recognizably the somewhat clumsy, homely girl. Points
for realism, at any rate. Moreover, this is not a story of tragically
denied lovers, though it may seem so at first; rather, it focuses firmly
on Catherine and the various treacheries and cruelties that she deals
with. The result, though slow in coming, is intriguing. Finney's character
is central to many of the surprises; his real feelings regarding his
daughter are not obvious until well along in the proceedings, but when
they become apparent, the real focus of the story shifts somewhat. 
Holland's visuals are particularly effective; she uses stark, even brutal,
images to reinforce her point, for instance when Austin discovers
Catherine secretly modeling a wedding gown, or in the young Catherine's
humiliation at a birthday recital. Though one is miscalculated--a showdown
between Catherine and Austin atop a rocky peak in the Alps--most are
effective, and the cinematography, mostly, fits the screenplay well.</P>
<P>It has been observed that, as is often the case with James, the conflict
between love and money predominates--but it's not clear that that's the
real point here. Certainly, that conflict is the source of much of the
plot, but arguably it masks the real tension, between a daughter too old
to be kept at home and a father whose opinion of her is so low that he
refuses to believe that she can make a viable life for herself. As it
stands, love and money are not genuinely in conflict--there is sufficient
money for Catherine to leave and marry Morris, were that the entirety of
the problem. Moreover, Morris does, eventually, land a job, satisfying
Austin's request that he make something of himself. But the problem
persists, and as we see no evidence that Austin is by nature a miser, it
seems logical to look deeper, at what truly motivates him. As usual with
James, there are hidden motivations at stake; the "money" angle is
relevant, though not in entirely expected ways, but more vital is Austin's
inability to see Catherine as anything other than an awkward, insecure
girl.</P>
<P>Though the ending of "Washington Square" is satisfying, it also provides
one of the film's major flaws, in that the script seems to rush to its
conclusion. After a climactic scene between Catherine and Morris, there is
little further resolution of either character--at least, not on 
screen--and we are forced to infer most of what happens after that. It 
could be argued that subsequent events are obvious, but it would have been
nice to see them--if for no other reason than to see how Leigh handles
them--and it's a bit jarring when a rather deliberately paced film
suddenly speeds up.</P>
<P>On the whole, though, this is a strong adaptation that captures many
of the most important elements of the novel but also gives the plot a
contemporary twist. Memorable chiefly for Leigh's portrayal of Catherine,
"Washington Square" deserves recognition for being something other than a
conventional period piece, in style and in plot.</P>

<P>The room is as you left it; your last touch--
A thoughtless pressure, knowing not itself
As saintly--hallows now each simple thing,
Hallows and glorifies, and glows between
The dust's gray fingers, like a shielded light.</P>
