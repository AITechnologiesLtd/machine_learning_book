<P>  Sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll. Burhanuddin Rabbani understands
the power of this troika, which is why he keeps his Taliban
morals squad combing Kabul with whips and chains to take
care of any woman who dares show her left eyebrow in
public, keeps an ear out for degenerate music, and may not
be too sure that coffee is not the Devil's brew.   The picture
of America imprinted on Rabbani's brain like a tattoo on a
with-it American girl's ankle could be that of the bygone era
in which the beards sported by our country's youth
symbolized anything but the religious fanaticism of today's
fundamentalists.  </P>
<P>   Where have those liberated times of the late sixties and
early seventies gone now that the cell phone is our country's
soundtrack, the personal computer the hallucinogen of
choice, and Wall Street replaces the sack as the instrument
of getting off?  No wonder that Cameron Crowe's
autobiographical character in "Almost Famous," William Miller
(played by the heretofore unknown Patrick Fugit), could
keep not a semblance of objectivity when asked to write an
unbiased journal article about the fictitious rock group known
as Stillwater.</P>
<P>   Cameron Crowe, whose blockbuster hit "Jerry Maguire"
dealt with a sportscaster's crisis of conscience, takes on a
similar theme with this work.  This time a 15-year-old kid,
asked write objectivley about a rock band in 1973, must
tackle his guilt as he decides to cast aside a journalist's
detachment and replace neutrality with passionate
partisanship.  In the role of a 15-year-old prodigy about to
graduate from high school, the bright, curious, eager William
Miller (Patrick Fugit) is assigned by a second-tier magazine to
knock out an article about the explosive rock scene during
the still robust days of student rebellions a couple of years
before the U.S. withdrew its forces from Vietnam.  A virgin in
many ways--never been kissed, never been out of San Diego,
not the sort to fit in with the regular guys in his high school,
William is full of anxieties and excitement as he tries to get
through the back door of a Black Sabbath rock concert but is
shunted aside as a novice.  But when he suddenly impresses
members of the band with his knowledge of their background,
Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) and Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee)
invite him to join them backstage.  Fortuitously gaining an
assignment from Rolling Stone magazine editor Ben Fong-
Torres (Terry Chen) and smitten by Russell's adorable
mistress Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), William gets far more
than he bargained for.  Not only does he capture the spirit of
this effervescent but occasionally confrontational group with
their women followers (known as band-aids because they
serve as the group's muse): he joins them on their
nationwide bus tour as they knock the crowds dead wherever
they perform, gets as intimate a view as is possible for a non-
member of the players, and is introduced, wide-eyed as a
pug in heat, to a bevy of women just a couple of years older
than he.  All the while he is pursued by a profusion of phone
calls from his stern but loving mom, Elaine (Frances
McDormand) whose way of saying "I love you" is her
repeated mantra, "Don't take drugs."</P>
<P>   Though the band is seen through William's eyes, the face
that decks the posters on almost every bus in New York City
is that of Kate Hudson, who performs in the role of Penny
Lane, who is captivated by Russell and uses the 15-year-old
William as a liaison between her and her main man.  Teased
and bewitched by this lovable beauty--who even playfully
urges him to join her on a trip to Morocco--William is all but
ready to sell out and to write a puff piece about his
experiences rather than a take-no-prisoners account of the
ensemble's vehement in-fighting and marital infidelities.  </P>
<P>   "Almost Famous" is an enticing surprise, a major studio
release coming on the heels of a summer of the usual
dumbed-down Hollywood rubbish. Splashy, loud, and full of
itself, Cameron Crowe's autobiographical coming-of-age
film looks more like a beautifully photographed, gloriously
scored, effectively realized project that could win the
affections of both the popcorn set and fans of the
loosely-structured panoramas of a Robert Altman.  Though
admittedly a stretch, "Almost Famous" is this year's
"Nashville," which critic Leonard Maltin called "full of cogent
character studies, comic and poignant vignettes, done in
seemingly free-form style."  Yet you could be disappointed if
you expect "Almost Famous" to give you greater insight into
the meaning of rock music, the wherefore of its hold on so
many of the world's young people who'd lift their arms,
swaying and rocking and caught up in its ecstatic grip which
is often fueled by hallucinogenic substances.  Many of the
songs on Nancy Wilson's soundtrack are secondary,
completely unknown by those who are not denizens of the
scene... strains that include performances by Led Zeppelin in
"Bron-Yr-Aur," Deep Purple's "Burn," and Todd Rundgren's "It
Wouldn't Have Made Any Difference."  The music is not the
thing, any more than it was in Crowe's well-received "Jerry
Maguire."  </P>
<P>   Instead, this is primarily a slice of Cameron Crowe himself,
informed by his 1975 interview with Led Zeppelin in which he
asked such penetrating questions as "When you wear the
makeup, how does it make you feel?"  We get the idea that
the impressionable lad's excitement in taking in the essence
of rock-band ambiance is matched by the band's own
devotion to an interviewer who makes them feel even cooler
than could an entire room of dancing devotees.   When
Crowe interviewed the singer-songwriter Jackson Browne in
1974, Browne was talkative with the young Crowe in
speaking of his record of youthful delinquency and sexual
exploits.  Through this film we feel the pain of Billy Crudup's
Russell Hammond, who is the stand-in for Jackson Browne--a
man who treated the cub journalist like a little brother and felt
betrayed by the kid's all-too-honest exposure in the magazine
piece.  "Almost Famous" does not give us enough of the
spirit of the times, of the world outside the cocoon of rock
concerts--the rebelliousness, the antiwar protests, the
excitement and vigor of an age less wrapped up in money
concerns than our own.  But the movie has more appeal for
an audience not a part of the rock world than other greats
and near greats, satiric or otherwise like "This is Spinal Tap"
and "Stop Making Sense" because it is told from the point of
view of a kid we all wish we could have been.  And to the
bliss of those of us who spend our time writing about the
movies, few other films glorify the critic as much as Cameron
Crowe's.</P>
