<P>Growing up as the child of dirty hippies, I was introduced to the plight
of Ruben `Hurricane' Carter at an early age.  Via the Bob Dylan song, I
learned that Carter was the number one contender for the middleweight
boxing title until he was accused, falsely tried and convicted of a
grisly triple murder by an all-white jury.  The song also detailed the
cover-ups, witness tampering and corruption ranging from the local
police to the judge that handed Carter his life sentence.  Pretty heavy
subject matter for a song (thank God that Dylan was writing in blank
verse), not to mention my five-year-old brain.  The tale seemed
inconceivable, even to a kid whose biggest concern was trying to get the
brake on his Big Wheel to make him spin to a groovy halt.</P>
<P>Still, I approached the film with apprehension.  First, you have to
consider the fact that you're basically seeing a movie that will offer
no surprises.  It's a biopic and, like Man on the Moon, based on
real-life events that most people already know.  Then there's director
Norman Jewison.  He's made some decent films, especially when he focuses
on racial injustice, but his last two (Bogus and Only You) really stunk
up the joint.  And then there's Denzel Washington (The Bone Collector),
an actor who, in my opinion, is one of the most overrated in the
business (it's a photo-finish with Liam Neeson).  But since The
Hurricane has already been praised by critics worldwide, I felt I should
probably check my preconceptions at the box office window.</P>
<P>Hurricane is a good film.  Is it a Best Picture candidate?  Absolutely
not.  Does it belong on Top Ten lists?  Not unless you've only seen two
dozen movies in 1999.  I'm not even sure that you can call the film
entertaining, considering the depressing material and lack of
surprises.  It is simply a good film.</P>
<P>Among its strengths is the way the film is assembled.  Instead of going
for the simple, linear, timeline approach, Jewison skips from Carter's
welterweight title fight in 1963; to the release of his novel, `The 16th
Round,' in 1973; to the murders in 1966; to Carter's youth in Patterson,
New Jersey; to the `present day,' when a group of Canadians lead a fight
to free the imprisoned boxer.  Jewison is able to pull this off without
Hurricane seeming too jumpy or confusing.</P>
<P>Also commendable is Roger Deakins' (The Big Lebowski) cinematography,
which is fantastic without being intrusive.  His camera-work, especially
during the grainy black-and-white fight, is quite remarkable.  At this
point in post-Raging Bull cinema, it's almost a requirement that all
fight scenes be filmed in black-and-white, but Deakins does more than
just use black-and-white stock:  He gives these scenes such a dated look
that you can almost hear Howard Cosell calling the action.</P>
<P>But the biggest surprise of all is Washington, who does a really great
job in the titular role.  The usually one-dimensional actor manages to
appear angry, scared and delusional at the same time.  There is one
standout scene where he meets with his lawyers and they do that whole
talking-on-the-phone-separated-by-a-thick-pane-of-glass thing.
Washington gets so worked up that his side of the glass starts to get
steamed up.  Or maybe he just had really bad gas.</P>
<P>Hurricane certainly isn't without flaws, though.  It's one slow-moving
train, punctuated by a tedious scene of Carter in `the hole.'  It feels
like we're watching the entire ninety-day ordeal play out in real time.
I also have a big problem with the creation of the fictional character
Detective Vincent Della Pesca (Dan Hedaya, Dick).  The detective is
portrayed as a bigot that sat around and dreamed up ways to incarcerate
Carter.  Sound familiar?  It should - it's the O.J. defense.  While I
understand his inclusion intends to illustrate the corruption of the
system, it's really hard to swallow.  I'm sure that law enforcement
officers wish they had this kind of free time on their hands.  The
character does nothing but potentially incite hatred toward police.  And
that just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.</P>
