<P>In a way Joe the King is a movie that feels too bad to be true :
surely, it couldn't be happening at this time, and definitely not in
this country?</P>
<P>Well, that's a question for the audience to answer, and film depicts
the plight of its 14 year old character, Joe Henry, well played by Noah
Fleiss. It's impossible to ignore the similarities with Truffaut's 400
Blows while watching the film, but to its credit, the story is told in
an uncompromising fashion without any sentimental moralizing baggage.</P>
<P>Joe's absentee father -- convincingly played by Van Kilmer (with a beer
belly and all) -- is an alcoholic janitor who works at his school. Joe
is subject to countless taunting and humiliation revolving around this
fact, and even his teachers don't seem immune to it. His mother (Karen
Young) works full time, and is too tired to care for Joe. His father's
absenteeism may be for the better, as his idea of discipline seems
to be brutalizing his son.</P>
<P>Joe also works at a small eatery to try and make ends meet, and his
woes are multiplied by his father's debtors who hound him regularly.
The uncared and lovelorn Joe plays truant, and resorts to petty theft,
but very soon things spin out of control.</P>
<P>Debutant writer-director Frank Whaley's film tells it as it is, but
don't go to the movie expecting the king to be redeemed.</P>
