A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>You'll hear a lot of people say this, and I'm here to tell you it's 100% true.
There hasn't been a movie so dead on not only in it's comedy, but in current
events since Wag The Dog in 1997. Kenny, Cartman, Stan, and Kyle sneak into an
R-rated movie starring Candian comedians Terrance and Phillip who's main
concern is singing the audience songs about having sex with everything
imaginable (donkeys, uncles, mothers, etc.) this strikes a chord with the crude
3rd graders who begins quoting lines from the film. Several (hard) pokes at the
MPAA, anyone of an ethnical race or religion, and Canada (who gets poked the
hardest, which caused me to wonder if they'd re-edit the film to show "Blame
the United States" for Canadian viewers.) follow to ensure a wild comic ride
that reminded me of Election on swearing steroids. </P>
<P>Is the film for kids? Nah, it's full of plenty homosexual jabs, profanity,
murders and pokes at celebrities (Winona Ryder and ping-pong balls! An unlucky
Bill Gates!) and other extreme and objectionable material to set off thousands
of concerned parents and activists. As Kyle's mother (who is the head of
M.A.C., Mothers Against Canada) says that these movies corrupt our youth,
there's another point (proven in the musical number "Kyle's Mom's A Bitch")
that the outcome of the children "affected" by this film depends on the
impressionability (if that's even a word) of the viewer. It all starts at home,
and this message is loud and through this movie that, while crude for some, is
controversial, political, and funny all at the same time.</P>
