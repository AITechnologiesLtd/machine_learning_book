<PRE>                             IF LOOKS COULD KILL
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1991 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     IF LOOKS COULD KILL, starring Richard Grieco, will be a very
amusing $2 rental in the video store.  At $3.50 matinee rates, it still
provided some honest laughs but I cannot recommend it to anyone who can
wait a while (a short while judging from the three other people in the
auditorium at the Friday 5 PM showing) to see this personable, hunky guy
with great pecs and good definition in the tummy spend a five-minute
scene in rather abbreviated jockey shorts.  Obviously, I couldn't.</P>
<P>     The movie, which hardly merits a serious review, is a parody of
secret-agent flicks and especially of GOLDFINGER, my favorite Bond
movie.  Like the old Punch cartoon of the country vicar being served bad
eggs by his bishop: "Parts are excellent."  And indeed, the movie romps
along powered by the idea of a wise-guy going to France with his
French-teacher-from-Hell and the French Club to make up his French
class; he is immediately mistaken for Secret Agent Man who in the first
of many coincidences has assumed the same name as the Grieco character.
The bad guys include Linda Hunt, having a lot of fun with a bad German
accent and a gold whip that does double duty as her necklace.</P>
<P>     The scene where Grieco tours the weapons lab and get his shiny new
gadgets including a Bondian sports car is pretty rich.  Unfortunately,
the movie slows down occasionally to take itself a little seriously, to
introduce the love element, and to make room for a couple of MTV videos.
The woman who plays the French teacher is rather wonderful as is the
madman intent on stealing all the gold in Europe, Hunt's boss (?).</P>
<P>     Also unfortunate is the skimpy special effects budget and enough
editing errors to fuel r.a.m. for a year.</P>
<PRE>Look for it next month.</PRE>
