<PRE>The Dish</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony </PRE>
<P>Back in '69, the USA made good on its promise to put a man on the moon. 
This modest, yet charming, Australian comedy asks, "What's the primary 
purpose of that?" Then answers its own question, "Perhaps a live TV 
signal so that the entire world, all of mankind, could watch." </P>
<P>Since these signals can't bend around the Earth, the US needs a high 
performance communications dish on the other side of the planet. When 
the moon (and therefore Apollo XI) pass over the land down under, all 
eyes will be on a signal pulled out of the sky by a loveably real team 
of four gentlemen in a field of sheep. The patient dish director, with a 
pipe, is the heart of the team. His emotional and sharp-whitted 
right-hand man has a problem with the no-nonsense black-tied NASA 
American. The young engineer crunches numbers while wobbling weak in the 
knees over the local girl who brings the crew lunch. </P>
<P>Such involvement in the lunar landing is a scientist's dream. As the 
responsibility heats up the tension, bonds cement across our four leads. 
Meanwhile, the tiny town of Parkes, Australia prepares to be either 
exulted or embarrassed as obstacles mount, "He knows everything about 
Apollo 11 - does he know where it is?" </P>
<P>The local band of teens tunes up to play America's national anthem for 
the visiting US ambassador, but forgoes their own set up for the Jimi 
Hendrix (teeth to guitar) version. Any disappointment over that 
missed-op fades when the band's brass instead fires up the theme to 
"Hawaii Five-O." </P>
<P>This sharp-tongued small film is well directed, acted, cast, written, 
conceived and scored. The mayor and his family play perfect on the 
screen. Watching Armstrong take "One giant leap for mankind" on the 
telly in their living room crowded with neighbors will likely choke you 
up as it did I. </P>
<P>Quote from engineer Neil "Fox" Mason at the Dish's Control Desk in 
Parkes, Australia back in '69: </P>
<P>"Delivering the pictures to the world was my proudest moment. Apollo XI 
was a once in a lifetime experience and it was great listening to the 
original audio broadcast that is used in the movie. It brought back lots 
of memories. ... I think it's one of mankind's greatest achievements in 
the 20th century." </P>
