<P>One of the most amazing things about "Tarzan" is that it has taken this 
long for someone to produce an animated version of the Edgar Rice 
Burroughs adventure. With a lead character who talks with apes and 
routinely performs physical feats of superhuman ability, the jungle king 
has always seemed a natural for the form. Even Burroughs said so back in 
the '30s, with the caveat "the cartoon must be good. It must approximate 
Disney excellence." Done and done. Disney's "Tarzan" is a corker; a 
robust, remarkably kinetic realization of Burroughs' grand, preposterous 
fable. The most successful melding of classic and modern Disney styles to 
date, "Tarzan" takes the essence of the venerable tale and presents it in 
a streamlined form, filled with drama, humor and amazing vitality. </P>
<P>The enduring popularity of "Tarzan" (47 films prior to this one, not to 
mention the TV series, comics and, of course, Burroughs' many books) is 
easy to understand. A kid grows up in the wild, away from all societal 
rules, to become a living legend, a hero routinely having fantastic 
adventures in an exotic world. Burroughs cooked up an incredibly juicy 
premise that neatly encapsulates virtually everyone's escapist fantasies, 
not to mention their sexual ones. Be honest, between Tarzan, the near-
naked jungle stud, and Jane, the prim Englishwoman who defies propriety 
to embrace the wild life, you've had a dirty thought or two.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, most "Tarzan" movies are formulaic crap. For every gem 
like 1934's "Tarzan and His Mate" (starring Johnny Weissmuller and 
Maureen O'Sullivan, the definitive Tarzan and Jane), there has been a 
steady stream of pure dreck, with trite situations and stock footage 
substituting for creativity. The nadir came last year with "Tarzan and 
the Lost City," a godawful mess with walking mannequin Casper Van Diem 
striking poses for 108 torturous minutes.  </P>
<P>Disney restores the luster to the franchise with its "Tarzan," a lush, 
economic offering which minimizes many well-known story points in favor 
of character development and swirling visuals. Although romance plays a 
part in the film, this "Tarzan" is primarily a coming-of-age story, as 
the young ape-man wonders why he is so different from the other apes and 
tries to find his place in the family, while his disapproving surrogate 
father glares from the distance (for a family-friendly company, Disney 
sure produces a lot of movies where at least one parent is either 
emotionally inaccessible or dead).</P>
<P>"Tarzan" takes care of the story basics with a dazzling opening montage 
set to Phil Collins' song, "Two Worlds," adroitly jumping between 
parallel shots of humans and apes. One breathtaking image flash-cuts from 
a human family cowering in a boat to an ape family huddled in the jungle. 
In short order, Tarzan's parents are killed by a leopard in their 
treehouse sanctuary, and Kala (Glenn Close), a grief-stricken gorilla 
mother who lost her child to a leopard, discovers the infant orphan. She 
adopts the squirming pink baby against the wishes of Kerchak (Lance 
Henriksen), her mate and leader of the tribe. As the child grows, he 
struggles to be accepted by his ape brethren, keeping up with the tribe 
by swinging on vines and "surfing" moss-covered tree limbs. Eventually, 
of course, humans show up and yadda yadda, you know the rest.</P>
<P>Thankfully, "Tarzan" is not a musical and Phil Collins' songs serve to 
propel, rather than interrupt, the story (incidentally, while I've been 
burned out on Collins for years, his rhythm-heavy tunes are surprisingly 
effective in this context). Although the artwork represents another leap 
forward for Disney, the company continues to cling to the tried and true, 
so Tarzan is provided two comic sidekicks. Wayne Knight is fine as a 
neurotic elephant, but Rosie O'Donnell, as a smart-ass ape, is a bit 
annoying, largely due to her grating voice. </P>
<P>The rest of the actors are exemplary. Alex D. Linz voices Tarzan as a boy,
 with Tony Goldwyn as the adult ape-man, and both are very good. 
Particularly strong is Minnie Driver, providing Jane a nicely layered 
personality. Together, they make the oft-told story seem fresh and 
Tarzan's identity and cultural crisis genuinely poignant.</P>
<P>But the main appeal of the film remains the knockout combination of art 
and music. Beyond the thrilling action scenes, some of the best images 
are the smallest. When the infant Tarzan yawns and stretches, watch the 
movement of his tiny rib cage and belly. This baby actually moves like a 
baby - a rarity in cartoons. The depth and detail in the jungle vistas 
are equally impressive, as Disney continues to up the ante in animation. 
"Tarzan" may not be quite as compelling as some Disney films, but it 
still ranks as one of their strongest efforts to date, a rich melange of 
comedy, drama and adventure surrounded by some of the dandiest eye candy 
I've seen in a long time. </P>
