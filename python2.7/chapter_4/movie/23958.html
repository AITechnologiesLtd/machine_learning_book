<P>A Review by Akiva Gottlieb
James Toback is no stranger to controversy. In 1998, his brilliant "Two 
Girls And A Guy" was slapped with an NC-17 because of a sex scene that 
contained not a trace of nudity. His latest film, "Black and White", 
also received an NC-17 for a pre-credit sequence involving mE9nage a =
trois in Central Park between a black man and two white teenage girls. 
Both films were eventually cut to receive a more marketable R rating, 
but each one is crafted with the skill of a filmmaker unafraid of taking 
risks.</P>
<P>It's too bad, then, that "Black and White" is as stagnant as it is. It 
is supposed to be an opus about race relations in New York City, but 
ultimately, the film is as inconsequential as any one of the 
underdeveloped caricatures that this ensemble cast attempts to animate. 
However, that doesn't stop it from being an entertaining 98-minute 
diversion.</P>
<P>Toback has fashioned "Black and White" unconventionally. He allowed his 
talented ensemble to improvise many scenes in the film. I'm sure Toback 
made this choice in order to add some realism to his character study, 
but most of the time, the improvisation leads to dialogue that is 
unnecessary, silly and artificial.</P>
<P>The plot of "Black and White" involves a dread-locked Brooke Shields, 
playing a documentary filmmaker out to study the recent phenomenon of 
upper class white kids who pretend to live the hip-hop lifestyle. Along 
with her closeted gay husband (Robert Downey Jr., who starred in 
Toback's "Two Girls And A Guy"), she follows around a group of Manhattan 
teenagers (Bijou Phillips, Elijah Wood, Gaby Hoffmann, Eddie Kaye 
Thomas) on their daily journey to "the 'hood", where they meet up with 
members of the fictional rap group Cream Team (Power, Raekwon, Method 
Man),</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Dean (Allan Houston), a local basketball player, receives 
$50,000 from a mysterious man (Ben Stiller) in order to lose a game. His 
girlfriend (Claudia Schiffer) tells him to "be true to yourself", and 
taking her advice gets him into trouble with the law.</P>
<P>There is an already infamous scene in "Black and White" which finds 
Robert Downey Jr. hitting on a hilarious Mike Tyson (playing himself). 
The fun of the encounter is derived from Toback's clever improvisation 
guidelines. He told Downey to make a move on Tyson, and told Tyson that 
Downey would merely come up and make conversation. After Downey gets a 
little too close, Tyson slaps him across the face. "But what if he kills 
me?" Downey asked Toback. Toback replied, "Look at it this way; firstly, 
I'll get it on camera and we'll have a great scene and secondly, if he 
does kill you, what more dramatic way is there to go?" This is a 
director with a unique vision.</P>
<P>For a while, "Black and White" gets by on the charm of fish-out-of-water 
encounters like the aforementioned Downey-Tyson sequence. But the charm 
easily wears thin since many of the actors give irritating performances. 
NBA star Allan Houston, supermodel Claudia Schiffer, and rapper Power 
all make unsuccessful transitions into acting. Also, Toback's film works 
better when it's not worrying about plot. Towards the end, as "Black and 
White" works toward its weak denouement, it becomes a conventional 
murder story; one that isn't particularly interesting.</P>
<P>Toback is obviously aiming for a dissection of role-playing in society, 
but it rarely works as such. Instead, it's a day-in-the-life journey 
across the respective 'cribs' of those living "the lifestyle", in one 
way or another. To call it a dissection would give Toback too much 
credit, because he never gets under the skin of his characters in a way 
that Robert Altman might have.</P>
<P>The "wigga" phenomenon was explored in last year's critically reviled 
"Whiteboys", and more explorations of the matter seem pointless. "Black 
and White" tells its viewer "to thine own self be true," but it 
glorifies a culture that would contradict the statement.</P>
