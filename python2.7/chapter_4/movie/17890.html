<P>
Despite deep, deep misgivings about "Dark City", from how bad the TV
commericals look after the seriously cool theater trailers, and from
word of mouth, I went to see the movie last night and was surprised.
It didn't totally suck; it wasn't totally cheesy.</P>
<P>This is a science fiction/fantasy/horror film that aspires to art.  The
visions this film presents gets up there -- it's very pretty, with the
fish being released into the water merely being the first of many
elegant images -- but the writing fails here and there, and then breaks
down completely near the end.  The writers, whether through a failure
of talent or through a cave-in to a producer's low opinion of the
audience, try to explain everything in agonizing, repetitive detail,
far worse than "Blade Runner" with the voice-over.  Mysteries are
solved and removed before they have a chance to be savored and
revealed.</P>
<P>It's also not a completely original piece of work.  The film concerns a
man who wakes up in a hotel room, with his memories gone.  It's an old
plot, though, the twist here is to make his quest to regain memory into
a meditation on the idea of memory and identity.  Philip K. Dick has
done this any number of times, usually better.  While a less pretty and
less serious film than "Dark City", the PKD inspired "Total Recall"
perhaps makes for a better meditation on memory and identity if you
ignore the Schwarzenneger pyrotechnics.  We won't get into PKD's
stories or the intensely literary and just-as-elegantly-shot "Blade
Runner".</P>
<P>There are a few moments when the film wanders into stupidity, but
generally not fatally.  At one point, a character is informed of his
god-like powers of shaping reality.  He uses the powers to make a beach
-- a lame one -- instead of, say, building temples and calling on the
people to cast golden calves in his honor.  (That's what I'd do.  I
suppose I shouldn't achieve god-like powers.)  Oh, the god-like powers
are expressed by a woo-woo-woo-woo rings coming from out of foreheads.
Awe-inspiring, this isn't.  Actually, thinking about it, I'm not sure
how god-like the powers are, since the evil-people have them, and they
work in labor-intensive ways, either in Dickensian infernal mills or as
roadies in a mysterious rigging company.  They also have to get very
close to mere mortals in order to put them to sleep (in a
less-lame-than-expected gesture of the hand and a slinkily spoken
"sleep" -- it looked really good in the trailer, since you're hearing
only industrial-like music, but looks really bad in the commercials
since you can hear them talking)</P>
<P>The bad guys are "derivative" or "refers to", depending on if you're in
a good mood or not.  The Strangers seem to be inspired by the old
silent film "Nosferatu".  Except for pointy teeth, they're dead ringers
for the first on-screen vampire, complete with bald head and
out-of-proportion limbs.  There is something deliciously creepy about
these figures carrying knives and wearing cheerily malevolent smiles.
Yes, some of the good photography in "Dark City" may be inspired by
Expressionist films, though any movie scenes featuring tall, lean
figures in the shadows may be references to that style.</P>
<P>The art design for the film -- the costumes, the cars, the props (which
looked like models, actually) -- borrows from the 1930s, arguably the age
of totalitarianism, though that wasn't made explicit (which, given how
much they like to explain everything, was missed by the writers).  The
issues of identity and control certainly has totalitarian implications,
though my main thought was, how did people in the 1930s avoid hat hair?</P>
<P>One question for the audience: when did clocks acquire mystical
significance?  The film's production company is in fact called "Mystery
Clock" -- a good name -- but mechanical clocks didn't exist until a
few hundred years ago.  The idea of the mystery clock hasn't been with
us forever.  Cinderella focuses on the stroke of midnight, but when did
this motif come about?  The story is older than clocks.</P>
<P>Oh, one thing they might have done, which would've been cute, would've
been to put a couple pair of elephants standing on a big turtle in a
particular scene.  You'll know which it is.</P>
