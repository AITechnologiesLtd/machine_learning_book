<PRE>                            IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Nicolas Cage, Bridget Fonda, Rosie Perez, Wendell Pierce,
Isaac Hayes, Stanley Tucci.
Screenplay:  Jane Anderson.
Director:  Andrew Bergman.</P>
<P>     IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU is nice.  It's about nice people who do
nice things for other nice people, and how nice things happen to them
as a result.  It's also about not-so-nice people who do not-so- nice
things, and how they are similarly rewarded.  It wears its niceness so
baldly on its sleeve that it's impossible to miss it.  Mind you, I have
nothing against niceness; heaven knows there is far too little of it
portrayed in movies these days.  But IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU is so busy
being nice that it forgets to be interesting, resulting in a watery,
flavorless little love story with a good heart.</P>
<P>     Based (oh-so-loosely) on a real event, IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU
tells the story of Charlie Lang (Nicolas Cage), a decent New York beat
cop married to gold-digging beautician Muriel (Rosie Perez).  One
afternoon, Charlie is without sufficient money to leave a tip for
down-on-her-luck diner waitress Yvonne Biasi (Bridget Fonda).  To make
it up to her, Charlie offers Yvonne half of whatever winnings he might
receive from the lottery ticket he is holding.  The ticket turns out to
be a $4 million winner, making Yvonne's cut $2 million.  This
development goes over not at all well with Muriel, who begins to make
life even more miserable for Charlie, and soon Charlie and Yvonne find
they have more in common than their new fortune.</P>
<P>     IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU was originally titled COP GIVES WAITRESS
$2M TIP, and it was then that I should have smelled trouble.  Tri-Star
clearly wanted to play up the story as a fairly tale, and from the
opening shot of New York City's skyline being revealed through removed
laundry, you know that's what you've got.  There seems to have been a
desire to make a "decent guy fights the system" comedy, something that
would inspire that much mis-used adjective "Capra-esque."  However, one
wonders whether anyone involved in IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU ever saw a
Frank Capra film.  The Capra heroes played by James Stewart, Gary
Cooper and others were not spotless, just basically good folks
struggling to do the right thing.  Nicolas Cage's Charlie, on the other
hand, is too good for sainthood, helping blind people across busy
intersections, playing stickball with neighborhood kids and intoning "a
promise is a promise" at regular intervals.  I almost wondered whether
the nice guy character was being mocked.  Bridget Fonda is nearly as
angelic, though she is given a tough background to overcome and an
endearing fatalism.  She does a lot of interesting things with her
performance, and has a standout scene where she first registers her
good fortune, dispensing free ice cream to all of her customers.  Fonda
and Cage are two likable actors, but ultimately there is not a drop of
tension in their relationship.  They're too perfect _not_ to end up
together.</P>
<P>     That's a real disappointment, because I expect better from Andrew
Bergman.  He has written or co-written some of the funniest and
quirkiest screenplays of the last twenty years, including BLAZING
SADDLES, THE IN-LAWS and THE FRESHMAN, and directed last year's
enjoyable HONEYMOON IN VEGAS.  He is working here with a screenplay by
Jane Anderson, who also showed a sharp wit with THE POSITIVELY TRUE
ADVENTURES OF THE ALLEGED TEXAS CHEERLEADER MURDERING MOM for HBO.
Both of them should know better.  Comedy requires some kind of edge to
get it rolling, whether it's situation or character, and IT COULD
HAPPEN TO YOU has neither.  At its best, it produces a few smiles.</P>
<P>     At its worst, Rosie Perez is on screen.  As the "villain" of the
film, Perez plays Muriel as an unrepentant shrew-from-hell, and it's
the kind of part where she's in the most trouble.  Her voice, somewhat
grating in its most tolerable moments, skyrockets into dog whistle
range when she browbeats Cage.  It is a performance so annoying that
even had IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU been satisfying on all other counts,
she might have spoiled the experience singlehandedly.</P>
<P>     There's nothing wrong with fairy tale love stories; BEAUTY AND THE
BEAST was one of the most romantic film experiences of the decade so
far.  But those animated characters were more real than anyone in IT
COULD HAPPEN TO YOU.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 happy endings:  3.</PRE>
