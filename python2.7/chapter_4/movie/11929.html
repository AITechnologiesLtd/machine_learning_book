Nightwatch (R) **</PRE>
<P>With two hot young stars (Ewan McGregor and Patricia Arquette), a stylish
director, and a creepy premise based on a popular Danish thriller,
Nightwatch built some buzz... back in October 1996, when it was originally
slated to surface in theatres.  A year and a half and many scrapped release
dates later, Nightwatch is finally set to make its long-delayed screen bow,
and this flat, predictable chiller will likely come and go so quickly some
will wonder if it ever did come out.</P>
<P>The ever-amiable Scot McGregor struggles with an American accent as law
student Martin Bells, who bravely accepts the nightwatchman gig at a morgue
as a serial killer stalks the city.  After more bodies and plot twists pile
up, Martin finds himself the prime suspect in the case, earning the
suspicion of his girlfriend Katherine (Arquette, completely wasted in the
screaming galpal role), his best friend James (Josh Brolin), and police
inspector Cray (Nick Nolte) as the real killer continues his rampage.</P>
<P>Writer-director Ole Bornedal, adapting his 1995 original, is a natural at
creating atmosphere.  Martin's first few scenes in the morgue, with its
creaky elevator, long hallway, locked room with vats of body parts, and
stark white room with alarm cords hanging over the dead bodies (in case
they "wake up") are downright skincrawling.  Ironically, this grim,
daunting atmosphere of fear and dread disappears when the serial killer
plot comes to the forefront.  This is mainly because the so-called mystery
is so incredibly predictable.  One character is set so obviously set up as
a possibility early on that the person might as well have "red herring"
tattooed on the forehead, and when the killer's identity is revealed, it's
an anticlimax--there is no surprise.  And the overdone climax, with the
killer wielding a buzzsaw as two characters lie helplessly tied to
operating tables, inspired guffaws rather than shrieks from the audience.</P>
<P>According to the press notes, Bornedal's original Nightwatch "broke all
Danish box-office records."  I can only hope that that version is much
scarier than the American Nightwatch, or else Denmark's cinematic taste is
just about as notoriously bad as France's.  (opens April 17)</P>

<P>"I didn't know what to expect. It's like something you chase
 for so long, but then you don't know how to react when you
 get it.  I still don't know how to react."
