<P>Dead Again has one of the best endings to a film I have ever seen.
Period.  It ranks up there with CITIZEN KANE, THE USUAL SUSPECTS, and
other films with surprise endings.  However, while the resolution is
surprising, the denouement is so well done that you may find yourself
watching it over and over again.  Director Kenneth Branagh, with his
second feature, has proven that he is very capable of directing many
different types of films, and at the same time, starring in them.  No
other director that I know of has starred in his own films, given
credible performances, and at the same time, created a masterful work.</P>
<P>Dead Again has a very refreshingly original plot which allows the film
to combine the style of the 40s with the frantic, quick-paced action
of the 90s.  The film noir moments are filmed using black and white,
not only for effect, but to give the viewers a little clarity.  Both
actors, Emma Thompson and Kenneth Branagh, have dual roles and the
color/no color contrast allows viewers to distinguish which time
period the events are taking place in.  The only problem with the film
is the beginning which starts in the past, and then shifts to the
present.  It was a little confusing trying to figure out that Branagh
was playing two roles.  Fortunately, once the film gets on its feet,
it never stops its relentless adrenaline-pumping run.</P>
<P>Most of the film takes place in the present day, with Kenneth Branagh
portraying Mike Church, a private detective.  He is asked to
investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding one Amanda
"Grace" Sharp (Emma Thompson).  Sharp won't talk, and she is paranoid
that someone is trying to kill her.  She locks the door to her room
and puts a chair under the door handle for added protection.  But what
makes her think she is being stalked is one of the essential pieces of
information Church must deal with.  She has been having nightmares
about a man on death row who stabs her to death with a pair of shears
which he stole after his final haircut.  Church suggests that she go
to a hypnotist who can help her.  Franklyn Madison (Derek Jacobi) is
only a part-time hypnotist, but a hypnotist nonetheless.  He considers
that her problem may be something in her past, perhaps in a past life.
Church, being the logical and sensible man that he is, thinks that
Madison is crazy.  Madison puts Sharp under, and she begins to tell
the story of a married couple: Roman and Margaret Strauss (Branagh and
Thompson).</P>
<P>I will tread lightly because most of the film hereafter is mysterious
in its unfolding, and I may not reveal anything at all.  I will say
that the rest of the plot consists of surprises, plot twists, and
uncertainty.  The revelation of the Strauss' life begins to uncover
events which may have led to Sharp's paranoia.  This story begins to
clarify why Sharp is so nervous, but suddenly twists arrive in the
plot, and nothing is as it seems.  Is someone actually trying to kill
her?  At the hands of a lesser director, nothing would have made
sense.  Branagh, being his second major film, is a powerful director,
with traces of Hitchcock in his film.  We may even have our next
Hitchcock in Branagh.  Unfortunately, Branagh has strayed from
mainstream films, choosing to direct the brilliant HAMLET, a film most
people tried to stay away from.</P>
<P>Watching Dead Again, I began to realize how much detail is involved in
Branagh's work.  The music is perfect (and won a Golden Globe
nomination) and sets the right mood for the different time periods.
Composed by Patrick Doyle, who also appears in the film in both
timelines, the eerily enchanting score enhances the mystery as well as
the tone.  The ending is the best moment of the film.  Many directors
don't know how to end a film, or it isn't consistent with the rest of
the picture.  Branagh uses slow motion to enhance the final showdown,
a film technique which, if used appropriately, can strengthen the
suspense and climax.  Dead Again is one of the few films which end
with the climax, instead of a resolution.  In my opinion, most
resolutions are slow and distasteful.  Sometimes a film will call for
one, but after the climax, most audience members don't care what
happens.  Branagh wisely ends this film once the high point of the
film is finished, leaving a sense of pleasure, instead of a sense of
boredom.</P>
<P>Most of the praise should go to the director, but without the actors,
there is no director.  Kenneth Branagh is one of the only directors
who can star in a film and direct it at the same time, creating a
masterpiece (this does not include Mel Gibson).  As an actor, Branagh
is terrific.  His dual role is handled extremely well, and without
revealing too much, his portrayal of Mike Church has some hints as to
the ending of the film.  Certainly, only Branagh would be able to
handle this kind of role while directing.  Emma Thompson fairs better
than Branagh, because she has a more complex role to play.  Thompson
maintains her nervous, but paradoxally trusting, character throughout
the film.  In her dual role, she does the same thing Branagh does,
revealing small clues as to who is who and what is what.  Derek Jacobi
has a tough job, trying to rise to the level of the two leads.
Surprisingly, he does so, and gives one of his best performances I
have seen him give.  Andy Garcia gives a good performance in his
smaller role.  Unfortunately, Garcia's role is a little too small, and
his performance isn't as memorable as the rest of the cast.  Also
worthy of note is Wayne Knight (from SEINFELD), and Robin Williams,
toned down from his normal frantic self.</P>
<P>Dead Again is rated R for violence and language.  The screenplay,
written by Scott Frank, is very intelligent and witty.  The plot
twists are amazingly detailed and impressive, and I wonder how the
Academy forgot to nominate this screenplay.  Maybe it was too original
for their tastes (and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS was out that year).  The
cinematography, done by Matthew F. Leonetti, is quite impressive,
especially his management of both time lines.  Dead Again is a
masterful piece of filmmaking with impressive sets, great acting, and
some of the best direction of a film of this genre.  Snubbed by the
Academy, this film exhibits Branagh's multiple talents, and the ending
is pure cinema.  Films these days aren't made like this anymore.</P>
