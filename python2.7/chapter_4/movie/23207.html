ANGELS AND INSECTS (director: Philip Haas; screenplay: from novella

Mark Rylance (William Adamson), Kristin Scott Thomas (Matty Crompton),

Lady Alabaster (Annette Badland), 1995-UK)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A sophisticated mid-Victorian drama, told in the form of an allegory,
about upper class society, playing more like a PBS special or a
high-brow Merchant-Ivory film but with a darker secret to tell. It
comments on the environment influencing one's behavior more than
anything else, as the female protagonist is studying a colony of red
ants attacking black ones. This model is compared with the behavior of
civilized society in England.</P>
<P>William Adamson (Mark Rylance), the son of a Scottish butcher, who is a
naturalist, returning from 10 years away exploring in the Amazon jungle,
surviving a shipwreck where he lost all his collected specimens except
for the rare butterflies he brings back to his patron. His patron is the
enlightened Sir Harald Alabaster (Kemp), who believes in the Creator but
accepts Adamson's beliefs in Darwin's theories, just published at the
time. He encourages him to stay and live on the estate and help him
organize his own naturalist collection according to scientific rules. He
offers no resistance when the destitute scientist asks his permission to
marry his beautiful daughter, Eugenia (Kensit). She is like the
butterfly, so delicate and beautiful to behold.</P>
<P>William is surprised that she accepts his sudden proposal. He first
meets her on the dance floor, but she abruptly leaves him, filled with
tears. When he tries to comfort her, at a later date, she tells him she
was engaged to a Captain Hunt, but he killed himself rather than marry
her. She agrees to marry him in a double wedding with her younger sister
Rowena (Saskia).</P>
<P>The Alabaster family is put under the microscope and the kindly but
obsequious William observes first-hand how different each member of the
family is. Eugenia's brother Edgar (Henshall) behaves boorishly toward
him, telling him he despises him for marrying his sister, that he could
never be one of "them" because he has poor bloodlines. The mother
(Badland) is an obese woman, always collapsing from exhaustion, who is
used to being pampered, surrounded by servants who feed her strawberries
in cream and other elegant treats. She might be compared to the queen
bee in the insect family, always being cared for.</P>
<P>Insects were easy to find as comparisons to family members, angels is a
different story. Matty Crompton (Kristin Scott Thomas), who befriends
William, having similar interests to him, mentions that "There are
people in houses who know everything, yet remain invisible.'' Which
refers to the servants, but might be the closest we come to anything
resembling angels in this film.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Matty, who is reminiscent of an ant-like creature, taking up
a study of an ant colony on her own so she can publish a book, is also
becoming closer to William, as he realizes he has more in common with
her than with his beautiful but cold wife. Matty is the household tutor
to the family's younger children, the poor cousin of theirs. She has
been attracted to William for some time, but he hardly notices her. She
chastises him one day by saying to him, "you do not know if I am aged 30
or 50''. He does notice her wrists when she draws the insects so
perfectly, and feels very close to her intellectually. If one can read
his mind, he is saying to himself I shouldn't have married for looks.</P>
<P>The film enters a period where the years pass wantingly by with William
living a comfortable but not fulfilling life. He also has a few
children, whom he does not feel strongly about. He is like some insect
who is trapped in a spider's web and can't get out, until he learns
about a dark secret that he can't bear to live with. And the very
cautious and measured man must choose between going back to the
uncivilized Amazon jungle or remaining in luxury in the most civilized
of all nations.</P>
<P>The film was visually pleasing; the costumes were beautiful; the script
was acceptably literate, and the film ably took the viewer into an
antiquated world and its peculiar customs, where the many maids who
worked at the estate turned their back to the wall in the presence of
their betters, giving one some rough idea about life there. The problem
with the film, was that it was tedious and had no emotional oomph to it.
The acting was stiff. The pace of the film was lethargic. The most
interesting sights were the insects themselves, which if that's your
thing, it would be better to view on one of those nature shows public
television has. Overall, this film showed the dramatic events in too
clinical a manner for it to be viewed as anything more than a competent
production.</P>
