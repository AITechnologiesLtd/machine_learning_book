<PRE>FIRESTORM (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Copyright 1998 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>Wow! What a great movie -- er, made-for-TV movie. It's now nine days into 1998
and I already have a film for an entry into my Top 10 Worst Films list.</P>
<P>I like Howie Long, he's a good guy, very down to earth looking and congenial.
His debut acting stint, starring opposite John Travolta and Christian Slater,
in John Woo's Broken Arrow was a good one. But, it was good for the fact that
Long was not the lead in the film.</P>
<P>Firestorm starts out with an action sequence that overuses just about every
camera technique known to movie making. From the slow-mo shots of our heroes
running directly towards the camera to the quick zooms to a
little-girl-in-distress. The opening sequence also uses some of the most hokey
cliches; a lost child in a burning house, the parents outside trying to get in
to save the child, cars in a fire with the requisite firefighter yelling,
"Run,
there's gas in the cars! They're gonna blow!", and the all annoying slow-mo
tight shots of happy firefighters jumping up and down in joy as their
teammates
come walking out of the blaze with a child in their hands (don't forget the
crescendo of music to follow this.) Whew, and that was just the first ten
minutes of the film.</P>
<P>Jesse Graves (Howie Long) is a smokejumper -- one of only a few hundred
firefighters trained in the specialty of jumping into a blaze to save stranded
campers and such. What happens next takes a leap of believability; a big-time
robbery prisoner (William Forsythe) breaks out of jail with the help of four
other prisoners, their plan brings them to an arson site where they, as the
big-time robbery guy tells the others, "Will become Canadian firefighters."</P>
<P>The rest of the film is spent following Graves, the bad guys, and the hostage
(Suzy Amis) around. The action is cheezy, uninspired, and plain uninteresting.
The action includes Howie in a fire, Howie in a building on fire, Howie on a
bike in a fire, Howie on a bike in a fire throwing a chainsaw, and so on. The
special effects for the fire are some of the worst I've seen, especially
during
the climax.</P>
<P>Firestorm marks the first film directed by Oscar winning cinematographer Dean
Semler (Dances With Wolves). Unlike another cinematographer turned director,
Jan De Bont (Speed, Twister), Semler does not have the eye for action. The
action is flat and bland in this film. His cinematographer, Stephen F. Windor,
tries to spice up the action with strange camera angles and techinques, but
none of these work. And worst yet all this "unique" camera work only worsens
the action. The camera work suffers from the dreaded shakey-makes-it-urgent
camera technique. Also used are a lot of extreme close-ups of things that
could
have been shot wider and the out-of-focus-makes-it-look-cool shots.</P>
<P>Scott Glenn and William Forsythe are the two A-list actors in the film and
both
do horribly. Glenn seems to be walking through this part since he's already
done it once before (hint, hint.) Forsythe opens the film with a somewhat
familiar imitation of the Sean Connery character, John Mason, from The Rock.</P>
<P>I'm glad that the film was just a few minutes under 90 minutes long. If it had
lasted any longer I would have walked out. Firestorm is a bad film that could
have past as a made-for-TV movie, but unfortunately it made it to the big
screen. Skip this film. Personally, I enjoyed the trailers more than I did the
film. (For those of you wondering, the there was a new and longer trailer for
Michael Bay's Armageddon, one for Chow Yun-Fat's US debut film The Replacement
Killers, and one for The X-Files.)</P>
