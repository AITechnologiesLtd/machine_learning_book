<PRE>Ulee's Gold
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1997 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>This "small" film concerning the life a beekeeper in the Florida panhandle is
surprisingly enjoyable. The biggest surprise is that, as many people do, Peter
Fonda has become his father. At times he is the spitting image of his old man
with the same lean body, gaunt face and eccentric mannerisms.</P>
<P>Ulee Jackson (Fonda) is a Vietnam vet who has never recovered from his wife's
death several years ago and would like nothing more than to retire from the
world and spend his the rest of his life tending his bees and harvesting
Tupelo Honey. Because his estranged son Jimmy (Tom Wood) is in prison and his
daughter-in-law Helen (Christine Dunford) abandoned the family, Ulee is
raising his two granddaughters. He's doing the best he can in a situation that
he didn't create.</P>
<P>And things get worse. Jimmy calls to tell him that Helen is strung out and
staying with his former partners-in-crime in Orlando. She needs rescuing.
Ulee's existence is based on duty: to the bees, to his little girls and now to
Helen. He drives his pick-up to carry the unconscious woman back home.</P>
<P>The robbers are archetypal sleezoids and threaten the family unless Ulee comes
up with money that Jimmy kept from the robbery and hid in a swamp. Unlike
other directors, Victor Nunez doesn't go for the big gun shoot-em-up scenes.
The intimidation and threat of harm are readily apparent and create a tension,
but the only actual violence is realistically understated.</P>
<P>With the help of a nurse neighbor, he helps Helen through her cold turkey
while, at the same time, attempts to deal with the threats. His life of quiet
desperation has gotten a lot louder.</P>
<P>In many ways, it's easy to see Ulee as Fonda's "Easy Rider" Captain America as
he has gotten older. (Of course the fact that the character was killed at the
end of that generation-defining film makes it a bit difficult for this to be
fact.) In that film, he was a loner looking for America, now he is a loner
looking for his soul.</P>
<P>Very different from the vast majority of the summer cinema fare, this is a
breath of fresh air. Don't expect any explosions or bug-eyed aliens, but
you'll find a glimpse into the inner workings of a human being.</P>
