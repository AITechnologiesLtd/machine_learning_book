<PRE>                             THE NINTH GATE
                    A film review by Christopher Null
                      Copyright 2000 filmcritic.com

<P>     What is THE NINTH GATE?  Judging from the cryptic marketing
campaign, you might be likely to dismiss it as another ridiculous action
movie, with big fireballs and car chase scenes.  Or worse, maybe you'll
shun it as a metaphysical adventure -- yet another END OF DAYS.</P>
<P>     Fortunately, THE NINTH GATE is neither of these.  In actuality,
it's a mystery with Johnny Depp as the unlikely hero, Frank Langella as
the perfectly-cast antagonist, and Lena Olin and Emmanuelle Seigner as
the femmes fatale.  Under the direction of Roman Polanski, you can rest
assured that these characters get mixed up quite a bit en route through
a serpentine plot that is far more interesting than its subject matter
would imply: The search for a couple of rare books.</P>
<P>     As Polanski's first movie since 1994's DEATH AND THE MAIDEN, the
auteur has a lot to make up for in lost time.  Apparently striking into
more commercial territory, THE NINTH GATE offers Depp as a
chain-smoking, rare-book-finding mercenary.  Employed by Langella's
publishing magnate, he is tasked with hunting down the two additional
copies of "The Nine Gates," a book also owned by Langella's character
and which he wishes to authenticate.</P>
<P>     Mystery ensues, largely owing to the subject matter of "The Nine
Gates," which is purported to be a manual for summoning the devil.  Now
if only a couple of these books weren't forgeries....</P>
<P>     An awful lot of THE NINTH GATE (based on the book "The club Dumas")
is better than you'd expect, but a lot of its potential is wasted on
repetitious scenes and a meandering storyline (the film runs about 2 1/4
hours).  The fistfight scenes are weak, the car chases dull.  The ending
is particularly annoying, essentially leaving the interpretation up to
the audience (and thus making it unable for loudmouth critics to spoil).</P>
<P>     However, Depp and Langella are fantastic, playing off one another
with demonic flair.  Imagine Depp's SLEEPY HOLLOW character with a
personality and you've got him spot-on.  Seigner (aka Mrs. Roman
Polanski), whom you might recognize from Polanski's BITTER MOON and
FRANTIC, is starting to lose her credibility as a sex goddess, I will
note.</P>
<P>     Still, despite a little snickering in the audience, Polanski still
pulls enough tricks out of his sleeve to recommend this film.  It
certainly isn't CHINATOWN, but it does carry a punch.</P>
