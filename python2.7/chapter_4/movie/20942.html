Wild Wild West</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>The opening sequence brings back memories of the TV series it recreates on
the big screen. Not only is Jim West back, but now he's black! I absolutely
love that! Others may criticize feature film remakes of 50/60/70's TV shows
for changing character attributes; but hey, these are the 90's, filmmakers
have got to meet the changes of the viewing public. Taking a white character
and making him black ... it's very bold and I applaud the decision. Oddly,
it was Artemus Gordon's casting I would have liked re-thunk. Every time I
see Kevin Kline in a comedic role, I feel like he's trying to be Steve
Martin. Speaking of casting ... the menace, Arliss Loveless, is played
marvelously by Shakespearean actor Kenneth Branagh.</P>
<P>Jim and Artie are U.S. Marshals trying to protect President Grant from
less-than-pleased Southerners shortly following the civil war. Loveless (who
lost his legs in the war) has developed a steam powered weapon of mass
destruction with which to recapture the union. Salma Hayek plays Rita, a
plainly pointless character.</P>
<P>Artemus Gordon is an inventor bent on using his mind to botch the bad guy's
schemes, while Jim West, in the words of the President is a "Shoot first,
shoot later, shoot some more" kind of guy smooth with the ladies. These
characters haven't much more depth than that. But if you're looking for a
script thick with intrigue and dimension, then you're looking in the wrong
place. Aside for the slightly-adult sexual innuendoes, "Wild Wild West" is
an action comedy for the 10 year old -- give or take 3 or 4 years. They'll
no doubt love it. That's not to say you won't have fun. In fact, I was
having a real good time ... until the climax.</P>
<P>In fact, "WWW" sports some impressive stuff. The sinister Loveless bursts on
the screen from a shattered 10 foot model of Pres. Lincoln's head. How very
morbidly appropriate to his character! Further, "WWW" is also to be
applauded for it's creative design of Loveless' wheel-chair and master
weapon, and for Gordon's method of viewing a murdered scientist's last seen
image, among other less notable steam-powered creations. "A-" for fun,
special effects, and action right up to the climax where "WWW" wanes into a
"B+".</P>
<P>PS: For the record (forgive the pun), I don't like Will Smith dubbing over a
perfectly good Stevie Wonder track.</P>
