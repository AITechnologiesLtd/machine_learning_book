<PRE># [film] "Godzilla"
A Postview, copyright 1998 p-m agapow</PRE>
<P>A giant mutant lizard attacks New York.  As if.</P>
<P>Yes, your honour.  I'm representing the producers in the case of "The 
State versus Godzilla".  And might I add what a pleasure it is to 
appear before you again, ma'am.  Yes, it has been a long time - the 
Christopher Lambert deposition if I'm not mistaken.  But may I be so 
bold as to ask you to throw this case out?  My clients, Mssrs Emmerich 
and Devlin, are highly respected auteurs.  It is beneath the creators 
of "Independence Day" to be placed on trial like this ...</P>
<P>Yes ma'am, and "Stargate" and "Universal Soldier".  However ...  
Yes, and "Moon 44".  With Michael Pare.  But that was never bought to 
trial.</P>
<P>In any event, my clients plead not guilty to the charges of reckless 
lack of imagination and perverse negligence of plot.  We won't be 
dealing with the charges of acting crimes against humanity as the 
prosecution has referred these to the International Court in the 
Hague.</P>
<P>If I might turn to the first charge.  Irrespective of whether 
the witness has seen "King Kong" or "The Lost World", or "Alien", 
"Godzilla" is completely different.  Godzilla is not a giant ape 
running amok in New York, a T-Rex running amok in California, or 
indeed an alien running amok on a colony world, spaceship or earth.  
No, Godzilla is a giant lizard running amok in New York.  This is 
totally different.  As regards the second charge, in the prehearing 
the plot was ruled to be purely hearsay and inadmissible.</P>
<P>No, your honour.  "Inadmissible", not "invisible".  Yes ma'am, I 
suppose one interpretation is that a special effects film should be 
special.</P>
<P>Move to strike.  According to "The People versus Starship Troopers", a 
director cannot be held wholly responsible for the performances within 
his or her film.  In any event, I have Mssrs Broderick and Reno 
outside, waiting to be called.  Ms ... uh ... the lead actress 
wasn't available for this hearing.</P>
<P>Actually your honour, we weren't able to locate Ms ... uh ... the 
actress playing the reporter.  We've interviewed moviegoers widely and 
none of them can identify her or what she was doing in the movie.  The 
local police department have deployed stakeouts in several theatres in 
an effort to catch her on film.  We've also enlisted CSICOP, who have 
set up infra-red cameras in several venues.  They apparently believe 
she's just a misidentification of the planet Venus, or maybe swamp gas.</P>
<P>I object!  There is no way the witness could know that the producers 
were "creatively bankrupt bimbos who think that throwing money at a 
piece of broccoli would make it a hit".  The prosecution is asking the 
witness to speculate on the internal state of my clients.  Also, it is 
clearly demonstrated in the scene where the army realises they've lost 
Godzilla that ...</P>
<P>Lost, your honour. In Manhattan, yes.</P>
<P>We throw ourselves on the court's mercy.</P>
<P>While I wrote off "Independence Day" as a B-grade movie that had been 
given a blockbuster gloss, "Godzilla" is not even graced by being 
gloriously bad or cheesy.  It is just dull, an empty trotting out of 
the essentials of the Godzilla myth, poorly masked by much sound and 
fury, signifying little but a gnawing black hole at the heart of the 
film.  The filmmakers were apparently unaware that any effort had to 
be expended on wooing the audience - to them, the sight of Godzilla 
crushing pedestrians should be thrilling in of itself, without any 
effort at suspense, empathy or surprise.  With luck, this may convince 
Devlin and Emmerich (and Hollywood at large) that no amount of 
advertising fervour will make a hit out of poorly acted, lazily plotted 
garbage.  [*/misfire] and meatloaf surrounded by fireworks on the Sid 
and Nancy scale.</P>
