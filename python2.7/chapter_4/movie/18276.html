<P>   The massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton,
Colorado, received massive publicity partly because of the
extent of the tragedy, but as much because the perpetrators
were privileged kids living in an upper- middle class suburban
area of the country.  Psychologists appear to agree that the
killers--who wore trench coats and referred to themselves as
mafia--were outsiders, disdained and ignored not only by the
"in" cliques of athletes but by women and scholarly types as
well.  They did not fit in and so they took brutal revenge.  </P>
<P>   "Instinct" deals as well with a violent man--one who
becomes an outsider, but by his own volition. Repudiating the
safety, prestige and comfort of his academic profession, he
puts himself outside of so-called civilized society, living alone
among the gorillas of Rwanda for two years.  For motivations
which should not be revealed in a review lest such disclosure
spoil a key plot point, the man summons fearsome strength in
attacking park rangers with a wooden club, killing two and
injuring others.  Placed in a solitary cell in a bleak African
prison for a year, he grows his white hair and beard to great
lengths and refuses to speak to anyone.  But because he is a
celebrated anthropologist, the U.S. State Department
manages to secure his release, fly him back to Florida, and
incarcerate him in a maximum security prison that resembles
the institution of last year's documentary "The Farm" more
than it does the correctional facility displayed in the movie
"Life."</P>
<P>   "Instinct," which balances educated (if sophomoric)
discussion with occasional bouts of violence, juggles more
ideas about the human condition than Freud and Kierkegaard
could have formulated in a year.  While nothing novel is
trumpeted--certainly nothing that would gain the attention of
major peer-review magazines--director Jon Turteltaub
("Phenomenon," "3 Ninjas") keeps both the physical action
and the verbal exchanges flowing, gradually revealing the
demons that arouse the scholar to murderous fury.  The
picture shows off unusually good chemistry between Anthony
Hopkins as the besieged prisoner Ethan Powell and Cuba
Gooding, Jr. as Theo Caulder--the therapist who seeks to
uncover the mystery of the professor's mind but winds up
finding out more about himself than he learns about his
reluctant patient.</P>
<P>   The story opens in Rwanda (actually filmed among the lush
vegetation of Jamaica) as Professor Ethan Powell (Anthony
Hopkins) is transferred by the African authorities to the U.S.
State Department in preparation for his incarceration in a
prison for the criminally insane in Florida. The ironically-
named Harmony Bay facility, run by a pragmatic warden
(John Aylward) and staffed by psychiatrist John Murray
(George Dzundza) and brutal guards like Dacks (John
Ashton), is overcrowded.  To help control the inmates, the
prison resorts to the principle of divide and rule, manipulating
the convicts to take out their anger on one another rather
than on the staff.  Dr. Theo Caulder (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) is
assigned to assist in the psychotherapy, but his real interest
is in Dr. Powell.  What makes a man in a staid, secure
profession turn violently criminal?  </P>
<P>   Those sections of "Instinct" that deal with the  turbulent talk
sessions between the anthropologist and the psychiatrist are
the most involving, notwithstanding the Psych. 101 level of
dialogue.  As the two professional men talk--or, rather, stalk
each other like creatures on a Rwandan jungle--they make us
privy to such issues as the nature of freedom, the lust for
control and domination, and the concept of illusion.  When
Powell accuses his helper of being a "taker," a person
consumed, even tied-up-in-knots by ambition, we think of the
character of Tracy Flick in Alexander Payne's great satire,
"Election."</P>
<P>   As Dr. Caulder encourages the patient to "show me the
violence"  he learns quite a bit about himself.  He finds out
that his primary motive is not the search for knowledge but
his own desire to advance his career--to publish an article
about his unhappy patient, perhaps even to get out a
best-seller that re-creates the buttoned-up psychiatrist as a
genuine hero.  </P>
<P>   As "Instinct" is a studio-made film, an entertaining, well-
acted one indeed, we are not surprised by the dollops of
sentimentality that scripter Gerald DiPego uses to pepper the
action.  Powell's daughter Lyn (Maura Tierney) yearns to
have her estranged father "back," but Powell does not want
even to talk about her.  When Caulder lends the intelligent
and witty, but heartbroken, woman an ear, director Turteltaub
hints at a budding romance between the two.  The story
strains credibility at various points: where does a sixty-year
old academic get the strength to virtually pulverize a three-
hundred pound, much younger prisoner, and to smash his
way through a batallion of police officers determined to
restrain him?  By what vigor can he overpower several young
and muscular African park rangers who, presumably, work
out quite a bit more than the hirsute primatologist?   How
does Powell manage to get the lion's share of attention from
the guards and to have his session run from a room inside
the prison, while the other unfortunates, who need services
as well in this overcrowded facility, must settle for quick
meetings in an entirely public part of the recreation area?</P>
<P>   Donald Sutherland does a credible job as Ben HIllard, who
is Theo Caulder's mentor, who advises the ambitious
young man to think primarily of his career and not of his wish
to help the enraged and frequently silent patient he is
studying.  John Ashton has the appropriate demeanor as the
sadistic guard.  But the other supporting players who are
prisoners--Paul Bates as Bluto, Ian Ingram as Lester
Rodman, and Thomas Q. Morris as Pete--are directed as
cartoonish characters.</P>
<P>   Many in the audience will be reminded of "The Silence of
the Lambs," in which Anthony Hopkins dazzled as the
psychotic criminal Hannibal the Cannibal Lecter, with Jodie
Foster in the Cuba Gooding, Jr. role as the person who tries
to get through to him.  But "Instinct" is closer in
temperament to Peter Shaffer's play "Equus," the story of an
English psychiatrist, Martin Dysart, working with an obsessed
lover of horses, Alan Strang, who commits a barbarous act. 
While Dysart is horrified by his patient's psychosis, he
secretly admires the young man's vitality and ends up
questioning his own staid, middle-class life.  "Instinct" is
inspired by the screenwriter's book, "Ishmael," more of a
meditation between a man and a gorilla than an action
adventure.  Turteltaub has turned the book into a not-always-
convincing balance of escapade and reflection, eminently
watchable with its National Geographic-like shots of Hopkins
living as a human being among the gorillas that fully accept
him.  </P>
