<PRE>                                       HAMLET
                       A film review by Sandra J. Grossmann
                        Copyright 1991 Sandra J. Grossmann</PRE>
<PRE>Cast:        Mel Gibson, Glenn Close, Alan Bates, Helena Bonham-Carter,
             Ian Holm, Paul Scofield, Nat Parker</PRE>
<PRE>Director:    Franco Zeffirelli</PRE>
<P>Screenplay:  Christopher De Vore and Franco Zeffirelli, based on Shakespeare</P>
<PRE>Synopsis:  A bold, risky version of Shakespeare's most challenging play.
           Worth seeing on the big screen at full price even if you hate
           the cast, the director, and Shakespeare in general.</PRE>
<P>     Maybe you did your Master's thesis on Gertrude's libido.  Or maybe you
never read HAMLET and never want to.  Whatever your background, this version
of HAMLET will give you something new.</P>
<P>     Zeffirelli has taken a complex and ambiguous 4.5 hour play and
transformed it into a 2-hour film.  Gone are subplots, political
intrigue, secondary characters, and much of the rich dialog that makes
Hamlet-the-play so fascinating to read.  What's left?  A captivating
tale so visually rich, with such strong characters, you can't help but
be carried along.</P>
<P>     The sets, the costumes, the lighting, the sound: all are perfect.
Faultless.  At a price tag of 15.5 million, producer Lovell got one hell
of a bargain.  The cast worked for pittance; apparently they felt that
the play's the thing.  And just how well did this cast do?  At worst,
moderately well.   At best, phenomenally well.  One thing is clear: the
cast got to experiment and play and create new dimensions within their
characters.  </P>
<P>     Each part--except Horatio--seemed to break new interpretive ground.
Sometimes it worked to great advantage.  For example, Laertes (Nat
Parker) is a younger, more impressionable lad than I'd ever imagined
him.  That fits.  Sometimes, though, the new ground seems unwarranted.
For example, Polonius (Ian Holm) seems more savvy than his lines would
indicate; he only plays the fool instead of being a fool.  This
interpretation doesn't fit, even though Holm does his usual excellent
job in delivering a performance.</P>
<PRE>     A brief commentary on each of the major roles and their new ground:</PRE>
<P>     The ghost of King Hamlet, played by Paul Scofield, is less a
frightening aberation than a haggard and sorrowful soul.  Scofield's
rendition is particularly effective, especially since Zeffirelli refused
to use hokey special effects and decided the ghost should appear as a
man.  (Zeffirelli claims to have seen a ghost three times; he says
they're just there.   Guess you could say he plays them as he sees
them...)</P>
<P>     Ophelia (Helena Bonham-Carter) is a stronger, smarter lass than is
usually portrayed.  Her descent into madness is therefore inexplicable
and absolutely does not work.  Also, Bonham-Carter's performance is
unexpectedly weak in spots.  Because Zeffirelli's "screenplay "
emphasizes her importance, this weakens the film.  The only places the
film dragged were her "madness" scenes.  (And there were too many of
those, as long as I'm complaining.)</P>
<P>     King Claudius (Alan Bates) is more a lovesick puppy than a
calculating, power-hungry politician.  This is certainly new ground!
Personally, I found this the most curious of all the portrayals.
Perhaps Bates (and Zeffirelli) felt that all the missing subplots took
the oomph out of Claudius' political maneuverings, but Claudius the
Cuddly never occurred to me as a possibility.  In rereading the play, I
still don't see it.  Does it work in the movie if you've never read the
play?  Yes!  Is that enough?  For those who haven't read it, obviously
yes.  For those who have, probably not.</P>
<P>     Hamlet (Mel Gibson) is a displaced son with all the confusion and
frustration that implies.  Most of Shakespeare's dialog that explored 
Hamlet's displacement from the throne is missing from this version.  
Therefore, the only remaining displacement for Hamlet is as the major 
object of his mother's affection.  While other Hamlets have been 
contemplative and/or indecisive, this Hamlet is a prince of action 
trapped by circumstance into inaction.  </P>
<P>     Queen Gertrude (Glenn Close) is so surprisingly sensual that it'll
catch you off-guard even if you know it's coming, so as to speak.  (No
wonder this Hamlet has trouble weaning himself.)  Yes, yes, yes, the
basis for this interpretation is certainly in the "script", but Close
pushes it much further than it's probably ever been taken before.  This
isn't the regal queen of Elizabethan theatre.  This is a queen for a
lusty king, the medieval King of Denmark.</P>
<P>     Speaking of lust and times medieval, one thing Zeffirelli has most
definitely accomplished is making the story of HAMLET a tale of real
people--folks with hopes and drives and hates and fears.  These aren't
stiff, serious, solemn renditions.  Neither are they one-dimensional.
However, some purists accuse Zeffirelli of creating too simple and easy
a version of HAMLET.</P>
<PRE>     Is this a simple, easy version?  Are you kidding?  </PRE>
<P>     It is a short version, though.  And rearranged.  Now, it must be
mentioned that there are at least four "original" versions of
Shakespeare's HAMLET.   Scenes are shuffled, lines are changed.  All by
Shakespeare's own hand.  Zeffirelli contends that few audiences of
Shakespeare's time would sit through nearly 5 hours of play, and that
the shuffled scenes and changed lines of the surviving versions are
proof that Shakespeare himself played with the presentation of HAMLET.
Well, yes, but I doubt he left out key characters such as Fortinbras,
and I doubt he ever left Denmark without an apparent ruler in sight.</P>
<P>     For those familiar with the play, the movie may give you vertigo
sometimes as it combines disparate scenes and condenses dialog and cuts
particular lines out only to reinsert them in completely unexpected
places.  It ain't pure, but it sure is interesting.  I suspect that
viewers who haven't read the play recently (or never read it) will find
the film quite fluid and sensible.  </P>
<P>     I saw HAMLET during a Saturday matinee.  The audience was mostly
quiet and attentive.  I say "mostly" because at least three teenage
girls--in different parts of the theatre--giggled at the beginning of
each of Gibson's soliloquies.  Behind me sat a couple in their late 40s
or early 50s who consistently commented at the end of each soliloquy,
"Wasn't that nice."  If it hadn't been for such "bookending" of the
soliloquies, they would have been seamless.  In other words, they were
soliloquies, not Soliloquies.  Although I've heard them delivered
better, I've never heard them as well-incorporated into the play.  When
in doubt, Gibson underplays.</P>
<P>     There are so many good moments in this rendition.  Here's a short
list.  The interactions between Hamlet and Gertrude, Gertrude and
Claudius, and Claudius and Hamlet are more dynamic than I've ever seen
them before.  The "get thee to a nunnery" scene between Hamlet and
Ophelia, although oddly placed in time, is extremely effective.  The
wistful "Yorick's skull" scene is quiet and lovely.  The sporting
contest between Hamlet and  Laertes is done with more humor, then more
temper, then more pathos than any other on film.  The moment Gertrude
realizes she's been poisoned is more poignant than you'll ever see it
again.  And Hamlet's shock at his own mortality is profoundly right.  </P>
<P>     For these moments and more like them, for the thrill of the
spectacle, and for the majesty of the language, get thee to a theatre
and see HAMLET.  The film's the thing.</P>
