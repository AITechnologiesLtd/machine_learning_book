<PRE>Title:                     RAN
Director:              Akira Kurosawa
Country:               Japan
Super Point:       Cinematography...the VISION of K.</PRE>
<PRE>         !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<P>Nowadays, the only real well known Japanese film maker ( unless you happen
to be in a film department in a major university ) in America, thanks in
part to Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, who went out of their way to make
sure  this man's best work was remenbered and revered.  Must sees include
THE SEVEN SAMURAI, THRONE OF BLOOD ( based on Macbeth ), YOJIMBO, DREAMS,
KAGEMUSHA,  and so many other films,... he is the scourge of Japanese
producers, who wish  to make billions ( not millions ) while this director
just wants to make  critically acclaimed work based on his vision.  Almost
all of his work has been 'stolen' by either Hollywood or Cinecita Roma, who
went out of their way to make garbage remakes of the same story.
Fortunately, the film copyright system forces the flattery makers to thank
the originators with some green
backs for their creativity.  It says a lot for the copycats, doesn't it.???</P>
<P>RAN is based on William Shakespeare's KING LEAR.  And instead of following
the story like Shakespeare, Kurosawa turns his three children loose until
they not only have destroyed themselves, but also everything in sight.  Like
LEAR,  where we actually feel sorry for the main character, this becomes a
tour the  force for the lead actors.  It's only weak spot, in my estimation,
is in the scenes with the FOOL, which tend to lag,... perhaps because his
voice is not specially attractive, or 'soft' enough to seduce you with 'his'
wisdom.  Here, he is a fool breaking down as well, which may explain the
awkwardness.</P>
<P>Much like THE SEVEN SAMURAI, the choreography of the battle scenes is so
intense, and well done, that you can't help feeling you are there.  And you
end up taking sides with the father, and thinking the children are full of
it.  I think this film is more of an 'expose' of the downfall of the feudal
lord system in Japanese society ( specially seen today with their economy
coming down to reality ... the rise of the middle, and fighting, and working
class ) than it is based on the story of King Lear, although the sequence of
'fillers' in between the action is decidedly Shakespeare flavored.  Unlike
the Shakespeare play, the women in this film ( one in particular ) are the
downfall of at least two of the sons.  Brutal too!!!</P>
<PRE>This film is long.</PRE>
<P>But it is beautifully filmed, and has country side shots which are breath
taking,... you can even hear the wind golliwog the mountains several times
 which is real folks,... ), has no music per se ( a compliment to Peter
Brook, ??? ), though Kurosawa doesn't always use music, a sore point with
his producers.  Kurosawa likes the silence, and the inherent sound  effects
found naturally.  Story goes that he bumped into the sound effects
accidentally,... and he has kept them.</P>
<P>Akira Kurosawa's other films are worth seeing, if you decide that you wish
to see something which tends to make you think a bit.  If your mode is not
art films, or curiosity in some one else's point of view, then save your
dollar.  But HE is GOOD.</P>
