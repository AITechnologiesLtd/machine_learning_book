<PRE>.                             GODS AND MONSTERS
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1998 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     It will probably be honored as a triumph of filmmaking (and indeed
has already one the National Board of Review's Best Picture award), but
while GODS AND MONSTERS is a good film, it's really more of a curiosity
than a legitimate masterpiece.</P>
<P>     The adaptation of a fictionalized account of the final days of
director Frank Whale (best known for directing the first two
FRANKENSTEIN movies), director Condon's story is really a simple one,
about Whale's infatuation with his gardner Clay (Fraser).  That Whale is
a not-so-in-the-closet homosexual is pretty clear up front, but for some
reason, Clay can't figure that out.</P>
<P>     What follows is a series of encounters between the two, the
degeneration of Whale's mind thanks to a stroke, and, most curiously,
one dream/fantasy sequence after another, wherein Whale relives his
childhood, World War I, and his years in Hollywood.</P>
<P>     The dream sequence, long known as the biggest crutch a screenwriter
can use, works.  At least part-way.  Because Whale's mind is going
south, we are asked to indulge his fantasies as near-reality for him. 
Like I say, this works, but only up to a point.  After two hours, the
device has grown stale and predictable.</P>
<P>     Still, GODS is a truly good film with a great cast (McKellan and
especially Redgrave, playing Whale's maid, both deserve serious praise),
and what must have been a tricky adaptation of the novel on which it was
based is also a feat unto itself.</P>
