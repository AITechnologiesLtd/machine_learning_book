<P>"You who enter here, abandon all logic." Depending on a film's genre, lack
of logic can range from disastrous (in serious dramas), to annoying (in
action movies), to anodyne (in comedies), to fun (in farces). And
"Krippendorf's Tribe" is a farce as broad as the Titanic was long -- the
real ship, as the movie's is only 4/5ths to scale.</P>
<P>"KT" is the story of an academic and most imaginary fraud. Anthropologist
Professor Krippendorf (Hoffman) had received a $100,000 Proxmire Foundation
grant  to find a "lost" tribe in New Guinea. He, his wife -- also an
anthropologist -- and their three kids went on a field expedition, but it
came a-cropper.</P>
<P>Things get cinematically murky from here on out. Upon their return, Mrs. K
died (where, when, of what?). Apparently Prof.James Krippendorf claimed
that the expedition was a success but kept stalling with making the results
public. In reality, he fell apart professionally and personally, made a
mess of being a single father, and in the past two years has gone through
the rest of the grant money to raise his kids and buy stuff for the home.
He is broke and way behind with his mortgage payments.</P>
<P>The above is a relatively coherent decryption of the movie's messy --but
often funny -- exposition. It opens with a view of the K household in
disarray, furniture that looks partly like the outcome of Goodwill
(Industries) hunting, the Professor in a state of confusion and the kids
not respecting Papa.</P>
<P>Old Hollywood college movies were populated by overage students who danced,
sang, lit bonfires and apparently majored in ukulele. Nowadays, pictures on
Academe, in keeping with the times may stress research. So,when Veronica
Micelli (Jenna Elfman) persistently bangs on the Professor's door, she sets
the plot in motion. Veronica, whose height dwarfs Krippendorf's, was an
adoring student of his and is now a new Assistant Professor of Anthropology
at the University. She wants to collaborate with her idol --  a good way to
get fame, promotion and tenure. She also reminds him that he is giving a
lecture on his findings. In a matter of hours.</P>
<P>Krippendorf's panic,chaotic school office and his bluffing throughout his
lecture are as amusing as they are unlikely. Under pressure, the
invent-as-you-go scholar baptizes the imaginary tribe Shelmikedmu --
concocted from the names of his children -- and describes it by using his
own experiences as a single dad. His biggest "discovery" is that the
Shelmikedmu fathers alone raise their progeny and are respected.</P>
<P>So far, so bad for Prof. K. The worst news is that visual proof of his
success is expected of him. It's a nightmare. The professor must feel like
Kafka's K. With necessity being the mother of invention, he gathers his
children, builds a "New Guinea"" landscape in his yard (!), adds huts and
stuff (!) and disguises the kids as "natives" (!)  Then he films all this
like a pro, on 16 mm. no less (!).In record time (something like a few
hours) the film is shot, apparently developed at home, and edited with real
anthropological footage spliced in (!)</P>
<P>What follows is chaotic madness, fluff as credible as Mel Brooks
extravaganzas, the Three Stooges, The Marx Brothers or Monty Python. The
tangled web we weave whenever we deceive grows non-stop and exponentially.
At every step additional inventions are required, all  unbelievable, of
course. The tribe -- eventually including co-conspirator Veronica -- goes
through lightning-quick masquerades, transformations, and complications
which include a rival, suspicious and witchy colleague (Lily Tomlin, played
as a caricature) suddenly taking off for New Guinea so as to discredit
Krippendorf.</P>
<P>On the whole, the picture is entertaining, albeit uneven.  It creates in
the audience the gamut of reactions: big laughter, chuckles, smiles,
smirks. Shudders too, since this "Widowed...with Children" farce can be
just as tasteless as "Married... with children" and at times just as
unfunny.</P>
<P>Alfred Hitchcock's famous remark "It's only a movie" applies here. Set
aside your morals, as a precondition to having fun. Take "Krippendorf's
Tribe" solemnly and its heavy load of bathroom and sexual "humor" is
reprehensible, as is the spectacle of a dysfunctional family bonding
through major cheating.</P>
<P>What certainly is politically incorrect is not the showing of white people
in blackface, but the transparent and insensitive use of African-Americans
(and a South African) to impersonate "real" New Guineans. Couldn't the film
makers have gone the extra mile and somehow found natives of New Guinea?</P>
<P>Superfluously tacky too is a big banquet to honor donor Mrs. Proxmire on
her 100th birthday.The sight of her and of several guests connected to
intravenous machines is pure ageism -- not helped by an amazingly unfunny
question to the centenarian: "Was it you who died or your sister?"</P>
<P>"KT" is to a great extent a burlesque send-off of Academe. The script,
starting with the scandalous cheating on, or illegal use of grants, takes
aspects of academic life and pushes them to most outrageously absurd
levels. Cannily, it throws in the in-joke  (wasted on most viewers) of the
name Proxmire used for the grant and for a major campus building.</P>
<P>Wisconsin's great Senator William Proxmire served for 32 years, retiring in
1989. A devoted public servant, he created in 1975 his famous Golden Fleece
Award which,  each month,  singled out a "wasteful, ridiculous or ironic
use of the taxpayers' money." In 1985 he declared:"My own favorite was the
study to find out whether sunfish that drink tequila are more aggressive
than sunfish who drink gin." (See below for a sampling of other awards) *</P>
<P>Performances range from adequate to very good, the latter by the manic
Dreyfuss and his brood. In a work of pure fantasy the youngsters are smart,
imaginative, and deliver their lines more convincingly than in most
child-roles.Jenna Elfman is overdone. Save for the smallish role of Lily
Tomlin, the supporting cast have tiny parts</P>
<P>Photography (in Hawaii and California) is skillful. In another in-joke
which  only older or savvy viewers will appreciate, much of the musical
score nicely consists of exotic tunes, including the once-famous "Taboo" by
Margarita Lecuona ("Babalu"), a distant cousin of the admirable Ernesto
Lecuona, the Cuban composer of, among many songs, "Malaguena," "Siboney,"
and"Jungle Drums."
