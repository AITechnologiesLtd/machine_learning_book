<PRE>10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * 1/2 out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Ten Things I Hate About 10 Things I Hate About You:</P>
<P>10. The Downsizing of Shakespeare.  Poor William Shakespeare.  Who'd
have thought his plays could sink so low.  10 Things I Hate About You is
loosely (very loosely) based upon his play, The Taming of the Shrew.
Updated to a modern high school setting, the movie strips away virtually
all of the dialogue, characterizations and plot.  What's left?  Some
vaguely recognizable names: instead of Katharina, we are given Kat
(Julia Stiles); instead of Petruchio, the film gives us Patrick (Heath
Ledger); and, in place of Lucentio, we get the plain Cameron (Joseph
Gordon-Levitt).  And, well, that's about it.  In place of Shakespeare's
finely crafted comic plot, we get:</P>
<P>9. The Plot That Wouldn't Die.  You may remember it most recently from
She's All That, and from countless other films.  In short, Patrick is
dared (or in this case paid) to date the shrewish Kat.  Along the way,
the two fall in love...but eventually his terrible secret must come
out.  When it does, the couple is driven apart, only to realize their
true love for each other and come back together.  Fade to black.  Whew!</P>
<P>8. Whiplash Relationships.  10 Things I Hate About You must have decided
that one hot-and-cold relationship wasn't enough for a film.  So, in
addition to the maelstrom of Patrick and Kat, we have the sweet-and-sour
relationship of Kat and her sister Bianca (Larisa Oleynik).  Then
there's the affections of Cameron for Bianca that range from love to
indifference and back again.  Now, throw in another student, Joey
(Andrew Keegan), who has love and hate relationships with both Bianca
and Kat.  And we haven't even started to look at the secondary
characters!  You need a scorecard to keep track of who's hating whom at
every moment of the film.</P>
<P>7. Teen cliches.  Luckily, if you're completely confused by the ever
changing character allegiances, there's one thing you can count on:  the
omnipresent cliches.  10 Things I Hate About You doesn't just present
them and move on, no, it revels in every predictable detail.  From
absolutely cartoonish archetypical students, to the "standard" events in
any teen movie (including not only a wild party, but even the prom),
this film has them all.  It handles itself better than other recent teen
flicks, but not by much.</P>
<P>6. A Horrendous Lack of Pacing.  Have you ever seen a comic with
absolutely no sense of timing?  That's the same feeling you get when
watching this movie, which leaves a pregnant pause after every other
line of dialogue.  What little humor there is doesn't take that long to
digest, nor is it inclined to provoke plot obscuring bouts of laughter.</P>
<P>5. The Interaction Between Patrick and Kat.  The two characters have
perhaps the best dialogue exchanges in the movie.  However, it not only
pales in comparison to Shakespeare's original wordplay, but makes the
rest of the movie's dialogue look terrible in comparison.  Rather than
being sharp, cruel and biting, most of the screenplay's wit is rather
limp.</P>
<P>4. An Overwhelming Sense of Falseness.  Whether the film is trying to be
spontaneous, happy or sad, the film's scenes just don't quite ring true.
You're always aware that these are actors reading from a script; you
never get lost in the characters.  Nowhere is it more evident than in
the acting of...</P>
<P>3. Julia Stiles.  She's able to display emotions, but she never truly
expresses them (a fact that is particularly evident during one of her
final speeches). Stiles never seems to fit her part...whether she's
being shrewish or sweet, it all seems to be an act.  It further
distances us from the movie.</P>
<P>2. The Scarcity of Larry Miller, as the father of Kat and Bianca.  His
scenes provide the few genuine moments of humor present in the whole
movie. 10 Things I Hate About You certainly could have used more of him,
or at least more characters as entertaining as him.  The film tries to
spice things up with a romance novel-writing guidance counselor (Allison
Janney), and a hip-hop English teacher (Daryl "Chill" Mitchell)...but
fails, miserably.</P>
<P>And, the thing I hated most about 10 Things I Hate About You:  1. The
Fact That It Inspired Me To Write My Review In This Ridiculous Format.
Enough said.</P>
