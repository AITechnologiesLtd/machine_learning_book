<PRE>Rush Hour
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1998 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of 4) </PRE>
<P>Before I knew much about Chris Tucker, I found his schtick
(high-pitched, super-fast trash talking) annoying. His sense of
self-deprecation has allowed him to grow on me, and he is now one of my
favorite comics.</P>
<P>Jackie Chan's schtick is, and always has been, amazing. His graceful and
daring stunts always entertain.</P>
<P>Combining the two seems more like a cheap Hollywood gimmick than a
stroke of inspiration. But whatever the motive, the outcome works. The
two look like they had a great time with each other, and that genuine
energy makes this otherwise-formula movie into something worth
remembering.  </P>
<P>Tucker is James Carter, an LAPD cop. He's not very good, but his ego
doesn't know that. Carter ruins an undercover operation, blowing up the
evidence in the process. True to Tucker's schtick, Carter can't even
acknowledge the mistake. He has a million excuses and they are unleashed
fast and furious. He's a nuisance to his boss and a laughing stock to
his colleagues, yet he remains egotistic and cocky.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the FBI is investigating an international kidnaping in L.A.
Their Chinese counterparts insist on sending their own agent Lee (Chan)
to help with the investigation. The FBI sees Lee as more of a hindrance
than a help, so they ask the police for someone to keep Lee busy. The
LAPD is all too happy to get Carter out of their hair for a while.</P>
<P>Turns out Carter isn't too pleased about the babysitting job, and
neither is Lee. The two team up to solve the crime themselves, with or
without the support of the FBI or the LAPD.</P>
<P>The movie, thankfully, makes no pretense about why the audience is in
the theater. It's not because of the plot or the conflict, it is only
because of Chan and Tucker, and the filmmakers know it. The movie
doesn't put us through any more plot than is necessary, and it gives us
plenty of Chan's amazing stunts.</P>
<P>Most of Chan's so-called "American" movies of late (Mr. Nice Guy,
Supercop, Rumble in the Bronx) were actually made a few years ago in
Hong Kong, so if Chan seems to have aged a lot since his "last" movie,
he has.</P>
<P>That doesn't mean he's lost his touch.</P>
<P>One of Chan's more amazing moves comes early in the film as he hops
between vehicles in slow-moving traffic. The stunts don't look as
physically challenging as some of his earlier ones, but they highlight
the grace with which Chan can still move.</P>
<P>Tucker is funnier than ever. As I said, his sense of self-deprecation
makes his annoying persona palatable, even tasty at times. His strutting
ego won't hesitate to broadcast a victory or explain away a defeat. But
his strutting is always an order of magnitude bigger than the actual
accomplishment. You can't help but laugh both at Tucker and at all the
other loudmouth braggarts in your life.</P>
<P>The two aren't a natural duo, but they do have some good scenes
together. While waiting at a stakeout, they teach each other their best
moves (to the tune of "War"). And in the tradition of Jackie Chan
movies, there are outtakes at the end that show just how much fun Tucker
and Chan had together.</P>
<P>And that's why this movie is worth seeing. Don't kid yourself. You're
not going for the plot or the suspense. You're going because Jackie Chan
kicks ass and because Chris Tucker is hilarious, and because the
combination is sure to be entertaining.</P>
<PRE>You won't be disappointed. </PRE>
