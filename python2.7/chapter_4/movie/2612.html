          - Ruocheng to Fonda, upon entering 
            her character's spacious Seattle apartment.</PRE>
<P>     LITTLE BUDDHA is a *great* chaser to the Summer Movie Memorial Day
500.  Intriguing, entertaining, and ultimately relaxing, Bernardo
Bertolucci's primer on Tibetian Buddhism tells the story of a 9
year-old-son Seattle son (Wiesendanger) who may bear the spirit of a
great Tibetian lama.</P>
<P>     When confronted by visiting Lama Norbu (Ruocheng), the parents
(odd choices Fonda and Isaak) take the news surprisingly in stride.
They allow their son to learn from the Lama, who tells the boy the
storybook story of Prince Siddhartha (Reeves) and his search for
enlightment in ancient Nepal.  From this tale, the boy (and the
audience) learns about the Buddist fundamentals of compassion,
knowledge, and impermanence.</P>
<P>     LITTLE BUDDHA is a two-tiered tale and both sides of the story are
equally engaging.  Fonda and Issak are both a bit stiff, but
Wiesendanger is a find.  His foil, best of the bunch Ying Ruocheng, is
a calming presence if there ever was one.  The gimme-a-break casting of
Reeves is something to behold, though.  Bronze, buffed, and beautiful,
he makes a most excellent Enlightened Dude.  Somehow, he works.</P>
<P>     Of course, the *real* reason to watch this film is for
Bertolucci's dynamic direction and Vittorio Storaro's prodigious
photography.  Together, they open the eyes as well as the mind.  Best
surprise: the multi-million dollar special-effects sequence of Reeves
sitting under the spreading Bodhi tree.</P>
<P>     There are a *couple* bumps on the road to enlightment.  The plot
is confusing now and zen, and the dialogue is often overpowered by the
music.  (Courtesy of Ryuichi Sakamoto, whose sweeping score, oddly,
recalls the work of Vangelis in BLADE RUNNER.)</P>
