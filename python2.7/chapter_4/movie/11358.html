Desperate Measures
4 out of 5 stars</PRE>
<P>"Desperate Measures," a new film by Barbet
Schroeder starring Andy Garcia and Michael Keaton,
is an action-packed production from start to finish.
While the screenplay is based on an unlikely sequence
of events, the events are coherent enough to form a
solid story that doesn't require desperate measures to
retain the audience's attention.</P>
<P>Frank Connor (Garcia) is a San Francisco police
officer who lives to uphold the law. However, when his
young son Matt (Joseph Cross) is diagnosed with
leukemia, his top priority becomes finding a bone
marrow donor who can save Matt's life.</P>
<P>As it turns out, the only person with DNA suitable for
the transplant is Peter McCabe, a sociopathic killer
who is serving a life sentence (Keaton).</P>
<P>While McCabe appears to consent to the surgery in
order to receive redemption for all his previous crimes,
he really has ulterior motives.</P>
<P>After an ingeniously orchestrated escape from the
operating room, McCabe starts ravaging the hospital,
which happens to be connected to a prison ward via a
pedestrian bridge. While the entire San Francisco
Police Department's goal is to eliminate McCabe as
soon as possible, Connor is actually trying to save him
because bone marrow from a dead man is worthless.</P>
<P>Connor figures that the only way McCabe will survive
is if he helps him escape the hospital. The unlikely
partnership between Connor and McCabe and the
interesting hospital / prison setting are the two elements
that make this film so much fun.</P>
<P>Naturally, these two elements alone do not make an
action movie and even though the scenes in the hospital
include everything ranging from gun-fights to hostage
situations, the movie would not have been complete
without a thrilling car chase.</P>
<P>In one particularly spectacular scene, Connor jumps
his police car over the median on Highway 101 and
has to drive backwards to avoid a collision with a
trailer that is sliding right at him.</P>
<P>The characters in this movie were well developed.
Both the antagonist and protagonist invoke strong
feelings of compassion because so much depends on
their success. Both men's actions are driven by
desperation, as each one is fighting for someone's life.
Both Garcia and Keaton play their respective parts
very convincingly.</P>
<P>"Desperate Measures" is a sensible movie pick if you
are looking for action that is nicely packaged with an
unusual story. Not too bad for a measly</P>
