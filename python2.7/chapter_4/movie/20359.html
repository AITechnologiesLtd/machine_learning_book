<PRE>"The 13th Warrior" -- Lifeless Eaters of the Dead
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>Vikings v. Bears?  No, this isn't the lineup for Monday Night Football.
 Rather, these are the two opposing forces that will battle to the
death in "The 13th Warrior," a film that is as dramatically flat as it
is gratuitously gory.  Based on Michael Crichton's book, Eaters of the
Dead, this Viking saga tries to evoke the mysticism of fabled Norsemen
and the glorious battles that they fought.  Their strength and honor
would eventually etch their place in history among the greatest
warriors that ever picked up a sword.  Luckily for the Vikings,
however, their warring abilities were not as clumsy as this film.</P>
<P>Antonio Bandaras is Ahmed, a travelling ambassador.  Accompanied by his
friend (Omar Shariff in a cameo), they eventually come across a small
Viking village.  We see that the Vikings are an extremely proud group
whose greatest strength is their fortitude.  They laugh heartily, revel
in their arrogance, and sing songs of battles won.   But their
festivities are about to be halted when a messenger boy arrives to tell
the village leader that a great evil is threatening their land.  Help
is needed quickly.  An elderly, fortune-telling witch arrives.  After a
brief incantation, she proclaims that 12 warriors and one more "not of
Norse blood" are needed to ensure victory.  Personally, I always wonder
why people believe these oracles when they look so haggardly and on the
brink of insanity.  Nonetheless, 12 men eagerly accept their place
while Ahmed becomes the pivotal 13th. The group then sets out to do the
greatest battle of their lives.</P>
<P>Of course during their ride, Ahmed becomes the target of fun for the
other 12 burly Viking warriors.  But he ably shows that it's not the
size of the dog in the fight but rather the size of the fight in the
dog.  He is able to overcome the proud arrogance of the Vikings, but
will his skills (and that of the group) be enough to defeat whatever
evil is menacing the countryside?  It does not look promising.  These
creatures, resembling bears, are strong and have high morale.  They are
fearless and display a desire for decapitating the heads of their
enemies.  They attack by the hundreds and the next strike will come
soon.  The warriors prepare their defenses and pray to their Gods. 
They are ready to sacrifice their lives.  "This is a good way to die,"
says one of the fallen warriors.</P>
<P>Despite the larger-than-life battle sequences, I was unmoved by the
entire experience.  At many points, I was even confused.  For example,
somewhere in the middle of the film, a sub-plot creeps up involving the
Prince of the threatened land.  He seems to have an agenda to elevate
himself to greater power during this crisis.  However, the sub-plot
never fully materializes, and we are left scratching our heads as to
the purpose of its inclusion.  There are other questions that I had,
but the real problem was that the story (little of it that there was)
offered no characters to love or hate.  The leader of the Viking
warriors had the most charisma.  However, Banderas's role is completely
underwritten and it is unclear why being the 13th warrior makes him so
special.  An entire rewrite of the Ahmed character is in order.   
Also, much of the action takes place during torrential downpours or at
night, which made battles very difficult to follow.  I would have
preferred more time looking at the Viking culture and how their beliefs
shaped their decision to do battle against the enemy.  As it stands,
the film manages more confusion than intensity.  It would make Thor
cry.</P>
