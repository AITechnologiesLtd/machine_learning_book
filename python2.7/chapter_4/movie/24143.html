<P>Tom seems to be living in a seemingly happy family, that is, until he
witnesses what his father and his sister, Jessie, doing something together.
Almost immediately, he becomes a recluse. To makes matter worse, he witness
her sister and father committing sex. Very soon, he can take it no longer
and decides to break the silence, and this leads to a terrifying conclusion
The directorial debut of Tim Roth, The War Zone deals with a theme which no
much film dares to deal with, and that is incest. Right from the point where
Tom witness the scene of both his sister and father in the shower to the
final shot where Tom killed his own father, we are forced to see the film
from a voyeurs point of view, especially the scene where we witness the sex
scene between Jessie and her father.  Also, we are forced to see the film as
a true nature of life itself, bleak and stark naked, devoid of any humour.
Every scene in the film can be as truth as it is. It also raises a problem
for all to solve, whether home is the safest place, and whether your family
can be trusted. For it is now too common in every society that even among
every family, that may be a chance that anyone cannot be trusted, and
especially your closest one.
That is, however, one nudging question in my mind after the show. Is Tom
also interested in Jessie, just as his father? In the scenes where Tom looks
at Jessie, I suspected that. When at the end scene when Tom, alone with
Jessie, closes the bunker door, where Jessie have sex with her father, I
suspect that he wanted to enact what his father did. That is just my humble
opinion. Maybe you can explain it to me.</P>
<P>The War Zone was shown on 15th April 2000 at the 13th Singapore
International Film Festival.</P>
