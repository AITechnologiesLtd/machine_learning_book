"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>You would expect a film written and directed by the guy that co-wrote
Analyze This to be a hoot.  Or at least be somewhat comedic in nature.
But Ken Lonergan's directorial debut is a tender drama about the
relationship between a nomadic brother and his unadventurous sister in
upstate New York.  Save the heavy-handed music and the embarrassing
two-hanky ending, You Can Count On Me is one heck of a great film.</P>
<P>Laura Linney (The Truman Show) plays Sammy Prescott, a single mother and
the lending officer at a small bank in Scottsville, New York.  She's
more than a little overprotective of her eight-year-old son Rudy (Rory
Culkin…yes, those Culkins), leaving her job each afternoon to transport
her child from the school bus to his babysitter.  The absences from work
don't play well with Sammy's unpleasant new bank manager, Matthew
Broderick (Inspector Gadget).  She's also got a great boyfriend (Jon
Tenney from television's Get Real) that seems ready to commit to a
long-term relationship.</P>
<P>Sammy has a younger brother named Terry (Mark Ruffalo, Ride With the
Devil), who, apparently, has spent his entire adult life as a drifter.
He always makes sure to send his worried sister letter from each stop he
makes (she excitedly reads them and carefully files them away in a
drawer).  Terry's latest correspondence announces he's coming home to
Scottsville for a visit, causing the overjoyed Sammy to nearly spin out
of control with happiness.</P>
<P>But when Terry arrives at Sammy's house, old sibling rivalries are
reheated.  Sammy can't understand Terry's lack of desire for stability
in his life, and he thinks she's too uptight, rigid and set in a life
full of routine.  As much as they don't get along, the two share an
incredible bond – the result of losing both parents in a car crash while
they were both small children.</P>
<P>After a few days in Scottsville, Terry develops a close bond with Rudy,
who has been pining away for a father figure for years.  In the
meantime, Sammy's life begins to become unhinged, dumping her boyfriend
to have a tawdry affair with her married manager (how many more films do
we have to see Broderick having sleazy affairs in seedy hotel rooms, a
la Election?) to Loretta Lynn's `The Other Woman.'  Count is one of
those films where the two main characters slowly begin to take on each
others traits.  Kind of like Simpatico, but nowhere near as awful.</P>
<P>The chemistry between Linney and Ruffalo is amazing.  In fact, it's
almost too good.  I was half expecting a storyline involving incest to
pop up toward the end of the film (independent cinema has taught me to
expect the unexpected).  Lonergan script is fantastic, and his direction
may be even better.  He elects to leave out scenes that you would
typically find pivotal in other films.  In particular, Lonergan doesn't
show the young Sammy and Terry being told of their parents demise.
There is also a great scene where Terry takes Rudy to a pool hall to
make some money off the local yokels, and Lonergan points his camera on
the uncle and nephew for a long shot while their competitor runs the
table.</P>
<P>Executive produced by Martin Scorsese, Count made me wish I had an older
sister.  And I'd have to strongly recommend a film that made me feel
that way.</P>
<P>1:49 - R for adult language, some drug use and sexual content</P>
