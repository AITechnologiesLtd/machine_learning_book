<P>   Americans can't get enough movies about sports
competitions.  We'll take movies "Any Given Sunday" and
we'll "Play It to the Bone."  We'll even cheer for "The
Waterboy" if we can't get "Bull Durham" every year.  If the
competition does not involve a ball, heck, we'll make up a
tournament, and we'll make sure the picture has the usual,
predictable victory for the good guys in the final seconds (or
a draw if both guys are good). We'll send the former champs
home in bad spirits showing them for the bad sports they
acted like throughout.  While Scotland displays its own
regional craze for soccer, the large, autonomous block of
land north of England is not globally known for any special
game, so Kevin Allen, using the scripting talents of Sacha
Gervasi and Craig Ferguson, came up with a bright idea.  If
tough men don't wear plaid, there's still an area in which they
can fiercely compete, and that's hair dressing.  </P>
<P>   "The Big Tease" is a comedy about a worldwide freestyle
hair dressing competition that's as fluffy and forgettable as
last season's fashions at Beverly Hills.  This is the kind of film
that has you rooting for the underdog throughout knowing full
well that he has victory in the bag once he overcomes the
usual obstacles that a villainous competitor puts in his way. 
Featuring a number of cameos by people playing themselves,
"The Big Tease" stars Craig Ferguson as gay, Scottish hair
dresser Crawford Mackenzie, a clueless but gutsy and
determined professional playing the scissors game with some
of the biggest names in tresses and locks.  He's the sort of
fellow that those in the audience wholly unimpressed with
sports can relate to: a celebrated frog in his own little pond
ignored and laughed at when trying to play the role of the
prince when he lands in the big time.  Watch this guy go for
the gold--the platinum scissors in this case--and you might be
inspired to push harder the next time you find yourself
brushed off by the folks you're trying to influence.</P>
<P>   Filmed by Kevin Allen as a mockumentary, "The Big
Tease" follows the misadventures of Scotland's well-known
hair stylist Crawford Mackenzie (Craig Ferguson) who never
quite understands that well known in his province does not
necessarily translate to the status of global celebrity.  Invited
by the annual L.A. Freestyle Hairdressing Contest people to
sit in on its annual competition, he mistakes the letter for an
invitation actually to participate.  Flying from Glasgow to L.A.
with a team of film makers led by actual documentarian Chris
Langham in the role of his friend, Martin Samuels, Crawford
runs up large bills under the misguided assumption that his
expenses are covered.  When the contest's coordinator,
Monique (Mary McCormack), sets him straight and refuses to
enter his name in the contest, Crawford is about to fly home. 
But he instead turns on his charm with Sean Connery's
publicist, Candy Harper (Frances Fisher), and prepares to
connive his way into the competition against the formidable
past champ, Stig Ludwigssen (David Rasche).</P>
<P>   Ferguson, who is popular in Scotland for his role on the
Drew Carrey TV show, evokes occasional laughter, principally
by his figurative pratfalls.  Since we're ahead of him each
step of the way, we simply sit back and wait for the sitcomish
scenes to produce their mild laughter.  One of the best
involves Crawford's discussion with the manager of the posh
L.A. hotel (Larry Miller) who pretends to interview The
Famous Guest but instead--after describing how  "I thank my
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ that I have not had a drink for
five days"--pressures him to keep his account up-to-date
despite a maxed-out credit card.  Much of the fun comes
from watching Crawford work on Sean Connery's publicist,
getting nowhere with her at first but casting a spell after doing
a number on her hair.  David Rasche is appropriately
villainous as the full-of-himself Norwegian-born champ who at
first dismisses the Scot as laughable but then plots to get
Crawford disqualified  through duplicitous tampering with the
materials.  The one series of shticks that does not work
involves limo driver Eamonn (Donal Logue), who like
everyone else in L.A. is working a day job only until he
breaks out with the next Oscar-winning screenplay.</P>
<P>   "The Big Tease" is one comedy that does not deserve its R
rating despite the suggestions of homosexuality.  It takes a
pleasant break from the teen gross-out comedies that have
plied their wares with varying degrees of success.  If there is
such a thing as a Scottish sense of humor, "The Big Tease"
probably appeals to just that.  For an American audience, the
movie is not unpleasant but awfully predictable and
weightless.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 88 minutes.  (C) 2000
