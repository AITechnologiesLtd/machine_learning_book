<PRE>BREAD AND TULIPS (Pane e tulipani)
A film review by Pete Croatto
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>An unhappy Italian housewife, a lonely waiter, a goofy masseuse, lots of
love, and gorgeous scenery all come together in Bread and Tulips, which
proves charming despite its covering of predictable, well-worn material.</P>
<P>The story concerns the aforementioned housewife, Rosalba Barletta (Licia
Maglietta) who accidentally becomes separated from her immediate family
while on vacation.  Instead of waiting for a ride home, Rosalba opts not
to go home to her Italian town, but to instead hitchhike to Venice. 
Upon arriving, she tells her self-centered husband, Mimmo (an excellent
Antonio Catania) that she'll be home in a few days.</P>
<P>Of course, that doesn't happen, as Rosalba quickly gains a level of
independence that has been unattainable in her past life of scrubbing
floors and buying groceries.  In what seems like days, she moves in with
lonely, suicidal waiter Fernando (Bruno Ganz), gets a job as a florist,
learns the accordion, and befriends her neighbor -- a wacky holistic
masseuse named Grazia (Marina Massironi).  Rosalba, who is first seen
wearing a gaudy stretch pants outfit, starts wearing sexy dresses and
getting closer to Fernando.</P>
<P>I can think of at least five other (American) movies (including Fried
Green Tomatoes and An Unmarried Woman) that are more than similar to
Bread and Tulips.  But Maglietta and Ganz, who act with restraint and
care, help Bread and Tulips from becoming a tired retread.  Ganz plays
the suicidal waiter role with a solemn, sometimes playful dignity that
is a joy to watch, while Maglietta never overreacts to her growing
comfort with the outside world.  Throughout the movie, Maglietta has an
easygoing, confident demeanor, which makes it very easy to root for her
and her growing attraction for Ganz's character. The gorgeous scenery of
moonlit town squares and sparkling rivers provides a perfect love story
backdrop -- you just might want to ask the attractive stranger in the
seat behind you for coffee after the lights come up.</P>
<P>Director and co-writer Silvio Soldini must get credit for sprinkling the
movie with effective goofy humor.  The cheap Mimmo, desperate to find
his wife (after all, he needs his shirts ironed and his mistress won't
do it), hires a job applicant (Giuseppe Battiston) at his bathroom
supply firm to do the job.  The reason?  Mimmo discovers that the
prospective plumber loves detective stories.  The novice detective's
various misfortunes, including him saying goodbye to his weepy mother,
are very funny.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, there are flaws that somewhat spoil Bread and Tulips'
cheery tone.  Rosalba is bothered by several surreal dreams during her
time in Venice, which bring the movie to a halt.  It's like putting a
gunfight in a Nora Ephron movie.  Several details in Fernando's life
also never get proper closure, including his suicidal tendencies.  Early
in the movie, he nearly hangs himself before Rosalba knocks on his
apartment door.  After that, Fernando's step towards death is never made
reference to, probably because Soldini wanted to include a lukewarm,
underdeveloped subplot about Fernando's stormy past.  It seems more like
a desperate attempt to pump up the drama in a plot that doesn't need
any.</P>
<P>But there aren't a lot of overwhelming negatives in Bread and Tulips. 
The movie is fun and romantic, with beautiful scenery and characters
whose lives we'd like to live if we had the nerve... or if our passports
weren't missing. </P>
