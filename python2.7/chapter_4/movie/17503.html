<PRE>Payback</PRE>
<P>Starring Mel Gibson, Maria Bello and Kris Kristofferson
Directed By Brian Helgeland
Running Time: 1 hour 50 minutes</P>
<PRE>(Warner Brothers)</PRE>
<P>A 'sort of' remake of the Lee Marvin classic Point Blank, Payback is an
overly violent, egotistical vehicle for Mel Gibson. Although the movie
offers some laughs, this film is too hit and miss to be truly enjoyable.
Gibson plays Porter, a 'nice guy' who losers $70,000 to both his wife
(Deborah Unger) and his partner in crime Val (Gregg Henry.) Mr Nice Guy soon
becomes Mr Bad Guy, as Porter deals with the 'Outfit' to get his money back,
meeting a variety of characters along the way.</P>
<P>Payback is a well made enough thriller, with good action and some nice
jokes. Although the film tends to use over the top violence to achieve it's
laughs, this is a enjoyable enough ride. Mel dominates the whole
proceedings, and while he carries the film enough, he's never believable
enough to make a truly bad guy. His 'hard assed' face is all very good, but
when he speaks it's comes off as a low mumble which is irritating. Also,
someone decided a voice over would be a good idea, but it turns out to be
the worst voice over since Bladerunner (1982) with annoying muttering by
Gibson over the proceedings. The rest of the cast fare somewhat better:
Bello is fun as a stereotypical call girl, the only 'good guy' in the movie.
Familiar to viewers of T.V's E.R, Bello is fine on television but fails to
make an impression on the big screen. More fun Lucy Alexis Lu as a
terrifying S &M girl, and Gregg Henry as Mel's psychotic ex-partner. Kris
Kristofferson, a victim of Paybacks infamous re-shoots, is nice and intense,
if underwritten. Finally, William Devane turns in an excellent performance
as Carter, a super slimy crime boss, and James Coburn is fun as a sharp
dressing villain.</P>
<P>The direction by L.A Confidential writer Brian Helgeland is nice, the action
especially done well. Sadly, the 'talky' scenes are boring and long winded,
which slows down the film. This film should be more of an action movie than
the drama it's obviously trying to be. The film is shot in a grainy blue
colour which adds to the gritty feel of it all in an effective way. And it's
also nice to root for the bad guy, although Porters charisma doesn't come
apparent to the last 30-40 minutes of the film, making it somewhat hard to
root for him at the start. In fact, I warmed to the 'proper' bad guys before
Porter. The violence quota is also high, although the very violent scenes
usually use implied, rather than explicit, violence.</P>
<P>There's a cool soundtrack running throughout, and the come uppance of all
the bad guys are enjoyable enough. The last twenty minutes are hugely
enjoyable, a great cat and mouse chase which has an upbeat pace missing from
the rest of the film. And here lies the main problem with Payback: the
pacing is off. This film should be a fast moving, pacy, violent epic, which
instead gets itself bogged down in 'character developing' scenes it doesn't
need. When the violence arrives, it's a breath of relief, and enjoyable. But
then the drama comes back, and so does the boredom.</P>
<P>Payback, therefore, is a worthwhile film, although flawed enough to not make
this a classic. Gibson fans will enjoy it, as there is a _lot_ of Gibson,
and for the rest of us: Payback is a slow thriller which delivers the goods
a little too late. A shame.</P>
