<PRE>                                 DAYLIGHT
                       A film review by Paul Miller
                        Copyright 1996 Paul Miller</PRE>
<P>When I got to the ticket window, I thought to myself, after Stallones'
last film (the bomb Judge Dredd), do I really want to plop down $5 to
get in to see his new one DAYLIGHT.  I did, and am thankful for it.</P>
<P>Daylight starts out with two shady guys argueing about getting rid of
toxic chemicals in New Jersey.  The deal between the two is made and the
chemicals are taken away, down the Holland Tunnel.  (If you don't know
this is the underwater tunnel that links New York to New Jersey).</P>
<P>In the next scene, some punks steal a car from a business man.  The cops
catch up to these punks and they try to get away.  By doing this, they
wreck.  And wouldn't you know it, right into the explosive toxic waste.
Well, a fire (very similar to the ones in Independence Day) engulfs the
whole tunnel.  Few people are still alive.   And on top of that, the
Tunnel has collaped on the ends and is barely still standing in the
middle.</P>
<P>Bring in Sly.  He's an ex-EMF operator and was for some reason or
another fired (they do explain why in the movie) and is now a cab
driver.  He finds a way to enter the tunnel  to tries to lead the group
of about a dozen to safety. </P>
<P>That as far as I'm going to go with plot details.  Here's why I enjoyed
this movie:</P>
<P>1.  Sly shows acting skills in what I thought was just going to be
another "Sly" action movie.  Don't get me wrong, I love Cliffhanger,
etc, but you really need to know how to act when you have special
effects on your side.</P>
<P>2.  Special effects.  Yes, I know this sounds like a contradiction, but
the special effects were first rate!  This are some of the best special
effects I have seen in a long time.  The fire especially amazed me!</P>
<PRE>and</PRE>
<P>3.  Twists in the action.  You think everyone is going to die, or do
you?  You think everyone is going to pull through, somehow they will
find a way, or will they?  This constant thought and suspence makes you
have to think through this movie.</P>
<P>I thought this was a super movie with outstanding special effects and
good acting.  I would recommend it to anyone.</P>
<PRE>(*** of 4 stars)</PRE>
<PRE>Paul's Scale</PRE>
<P>**** - If you haven't seen this movie, something is terribly wrong.
***  - Excellent movie!  Take an afternoon off work and take in this
       flick.
**   - Don't waste your money
*    - Your reputation will be ruined if you are seen at this movie.</P>
