<PRE>   Stop me if you've heard this one:</PRE>
<P>  Patient: "Doctor, doctor, I have a serious problem.  You've
got to help me.  I can't remember anything."</P>
<PRE>  Doctor: "When did you first notice that you had this
problem?"</PRE>
<PRE>   Patient: "What problem?"</PRE>
<P>   Whether or not Jonathan Nolan ever heard that one, his
short story illustrates not so much the hokey wit behind the
sally but the horror that inhabits the body of a man actually
afflicted with this rare disease.  In the story adapted and
directed by the writer's brother, Christopher Nolan,
"Memento" tells of a thirty-something insurance investigator
who, in the process of rescuing his wife from a rapist, suffers
a blow to his head that causes him short-term memory.  He
cannot remember facts, names or faces once they are out of
his mind for a few minutes, though memories of his life
before the encounter with the attacker seem to be no
problem for him.  Or so he believes.  As a memento of each
meeting with a man, a woman or even a car, he snaps a
Polaroid picture, captioning each shot with a fleeting
statement like "Don't believe his lies," and dedicates his life
to avenging his wife's rape-murder.  Since the thought of
revenge compels his every action, he actually tattoos vital
information to his body, even having license numbers etched
into his thigh and letters across his chest running
backward so that they will appear normal when he faces
himself in the mirror.  Most chilling is the simple
announcement written in reverse across his chest, "John G.
raped and murdered my wife."</P>
<P>   A thinking person's thriller with some occasionally startling
albeit split-second sounds and striking imagery, Nolan's
movie is an original.  The story is told backwards, but this is
not a mere gimmick such as that used to no useful effect by
Mike Figgis, who divided his screen for "Time Code" into
quadrants.  Nolan is attempting to put the viewer into the
poor guy's mind to show the confusion that has taken over
his life, in effect making the audience as flustered as the
brain-damaged Leonard--whose role is performed almost as a
one-man show by the alarmingly talented Guy Pearce ("L.A.
Confidential").  </P>
<P>   The story begins, then, with the conclusion.  Leonard has
wrestled a man known as Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) to the
ground and has put a gun to Teddy's face prepared to do him
in for the murder of his wife.  But who, really, is Teddy?  Is
he the perpetrator against whom Leonard is justifiably
seeking revenge?  We don't know because Leonard himself
doesn't know, a concept that gives the picture its fascinating
intrigue.  "Memento" is a jigsaw puzzle which, each time you
think you have the pieces in place, you are confronted with a
new twist that keeps you guessing about each individual's
role.  </P>
<P>   For example, who is the mysterious Natalie (Carrie-Anne
Moss), a woman willing to help Leonard gain his revenge?  Is
she merely using him to gain the satisfaction that she seeks,
a vengeance against a man who has beaten her silly?  Or
does she take pity on this bewildered individual, empathizing
with his tragedy and willing to go the distance for the stranger
out of sheer compassion?  Why does Nolan bring in the
character of Sammy (Stephen Tobolowsky), a man who has
apparently suffered a similar ailment as Leonard and whom
Leonard is investigating to determine whether Sammy's
affliction is an insurance-covered physical condition or an
insurance exempted psychological one?</P>
<P>    Most of all, who is Leonard and why has he been able to
afford to drive a Jaguar and wear designer suits on the salary
of an insurance investigator?  He doesn't know, so we are
kept in the dark as well. By the final minutes of the film (that
is, the beginning of the action), some but not all of the
enigma is resolved.  This is not the kind of solution that most
people in the audience would have guessed, I would imagine,
making "Memento" a satisfying puzzle throughout and,
perhaps equally important, a vehicle for 32-year-old Guy
Pearce's tour de force performance--which is backed up well
by an ensemble which includes Mark Boone Junior as Burt,
who manages one of the motels in which Leonard is living
anonymously and especially Carrie-Anne Moss (seen in
November of 2000 in the far bigger-budgeted but less
challenging "Red Planet").  Viewers accustomed to clever
indies such as this one already know that you don't need
megabucks to challenge and entertain.  With the limited
budget available to the producers and the circumscribed time
afforded to its filming, Nolan's work is probably edgier than it
would have been had the intensity and focus been missing.</P>
