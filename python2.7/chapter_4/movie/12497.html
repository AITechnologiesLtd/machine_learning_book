A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Fredrik Du Chau</PRE>
<P>Written by: 
Kirk De Micco, William Schifrin, Jacqueline Feather, David Seidler from
a novel (THE KING'S DAMOSEL) by Vera Chapman.</P>
<PRE>Ingredients: 
Adventurous girl who wants to become a knight, King Arthur, blind young
hunk, stolen sword </PRE>
<P>Starring the voices of: Jessalyn Gilsig, Cary Elwes, Gary Oldman
(Singing voices for Kayley and Garrett are: Andrea Corr, Bryan White)</P>
<P>Synopsis:
In this animated feature, beautiful Kayley (voice of Jessalyn Gilsig)
wants to become a knight of the Round Table - - like her father, the
late Sir Lionel (voice of Gabriel Byrne), who was killed defending King
Arthur (voice of Pierce Brosnan) from the rogue knight Ruber (voice of
Gary Oldman). One day, Ruber's monstrous flying pet griffin (voice of
Bronson Pinchot) steals King Arthur's magical sword Excalibur and
accidentally loses the weapon in flight, dropping it into the forbidden
forest. Ruber, who has recently kidnapped Kayley's mother Juliana (voice
of Jane Seymour), seeks the sword, and also plots to attack Camelot with
enchanted metal warriors. </P>
<P>On a quest to find the forbidden sword, Kayley enters the forbidden
forest. There she meets a blind and handsome boy falconer Garrett (voice
of Cary Elwes) and a friendly two-headed dragon (voices of Eric Idle and
Don Rickles). Will Kayley, Garrett, and pals recover Excalibur and foil
Ruber's attack?</P>
<P>Opinion: 
Warner Brothers' QUEST FOR CAMELOT is similar to 20th Century Fox's
ANASTASIA in that both movies are attempts by non-Disney studios to
capitalize on the Disney-watching crowd. </P>
<P>The best modern animated films include a sharp script, great songs, and
detailed artwork. Many use rotoscoping - - a technique where one takes
live action footage, and inks it into the animation by copying each
frame onto animation paper (ex: for SNOW WHITE, Disney hired Marjori
Belcher to do the dancing). Thus, even with a cartoon you can mimic
interesting camerawork: having the viewing angles zoom in, spin, and
move around. </P>
<P>But don't expect any of the above from QUEST FOR CAMELOT, which is a
middle-of-the-road movie. Actually, I get the impression QUEST FOR
CAMELOT was hurriedly created, because the film lacks attention to the
story's finer details. The blind falconer doesn't act convincingly
blind; the two-headed dragon tries rapidfire comedic patter (like Robin
Williams' genie in ALADDIN) but sounds irritating rather than cute; the
hero gets hit with an arrow and two seconds later sings a song (and
stumbles on a magical plant that heals all wounds); the protagonists
tramp through dangerous forests when they could just as easily ride
magic helicopter plants; they mosey along with no sense of urgency
during life-threatening situations where they should be running in fear
for their lives: et cetera. In other words, QUEST FOR CAMELOT is
contrived rather than compelling. And as for music, coming out of the
theater, nobody could remember a single song from the soundtrack. This
is mediocre stuff.</P>
<P>On the bright side, QUEST FOR CAMELOT soundtrack features songs from
Celine Dion and LeAnn Rimes. QUEST FOR CAMELOT also features the voices
of a star studded cast. Very young children probably won't notice the
numerous plot holes, and it has a happy ending.</P>
