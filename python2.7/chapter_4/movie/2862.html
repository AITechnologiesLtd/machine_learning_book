                       A film review by Raymond Johnston
                        Copyright 1994 Raymond Johnston</PRE>
<P>Dir: Oliver Stone
Starring Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis, Robert Downey Jr.
Tommy Lee Jones, Rodney Dangerfield
A Regency Film distributed by Warner Bros.</P>
<P>     Oliver Stone's new film is a nonstop barrage of pop cultures'
images.  Like a two-hour rock video, the film switches from grainy black
and white, hand held home color, wavy video transfer, and professional
35mm film.  Each medium brings with it its own way of contemplating the
story.  Mallory's (Juliette Lewis) abusive childhood is presented on
video with a laugh track.  Her wedding to serial killer Mickey (Woody
Harrelson) is in home movie color.  Their spree across the West is
presented as a bad movie; they sit in a prop car in front of an
undisguised rear screen projector showing stock footage of different
roads.  Some scenes even include their own commercials.  Other scenes
simulate switching channels with a remote and landing on the story of
Mickey and Mallory, the murdering couple who take the  place of James
Dean and Marilyn Monroe in the hearts of 90s youth.</P>
<P>     While this technique of story telling is functional and sometimes
interesting, director Stone's choice of making the actors play their
lines for broad comedy is less successful.  Harrelson and Lewis manage
to pull off their sneering cynicism because it is pretty much in
character.  Rodney Dangerfield's father character manages to parody the
"Father Knows Best" cliches and has a laugh track.  Tommy Lee Jones as
the warden, Stephen Wright as the psychiatrist, Robert Downey Jr. as
the tabloid reporter all fall flat when they mug their lines and
consciously over emote.  As a surrealistic comedy (or perhaps parody of
a comedy) about the callousness and sickness of modern society NATURAL
BORN KILLERS does not succeed.</P>
<P>       In his scatter shot approach, there are other levels to the
film.  As a social commentary on the media the film is a little better.
It is difficult to have sympathy for the media characters who prey on
the same carcasses as the serial killers.  The fans of Mickey and
Mallory strike a much more realistic note considering the fans of
recent tabloid criminals.</P>
<P>      Besides using a variety of filming styles and techniques, Stone
cuts in a variety of stock footage from everything from "Leave It to
Beaver" to THE WILD BUNCH.  Music in the soundtrack is also diverse and
supportive, including everything from Jane's Addiction to Leonard
Cohen.  Among all these sounds and images, Mickey and Mallory fit right
in.  The problem with the film is that all too often they get lost in
the mix.</P>
<P>     Juliette Lewis plays a similar role in last year's KALIFORNIA, a
similar and more coherent film, if a less adventurous one.  Two other
serial killer couple films worth checking out on tape are THE HONEYMOON
KILLERS with Tony LoBianco and BADLANDS with Martin Sheen and Sissy
Spacek.</P>
<PRE>     NATURAL BORN KILLERS was edited to receive an R rating.</PRE>
