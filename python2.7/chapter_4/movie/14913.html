                             BELOVED (1998)
                     by Chris Webb  copyright 1998</PRE>
<PRE>        cast: Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, Thandie Newton, Kimberly 
              Elise, Beah Richards, Albert Hall, Irma P. Hall, 
              Kessia Randall, Lisa Gay Hamilton
        directed by Jonathan Demme
        written by Adam Brooks, Akosua Busia, Richard LaGravenese
        based on Toni Morrison's novel "Beloved"</PRE>
<P>Everything Oprah touches turns to gold, what is surprising is that shehas
sustained her touch for thirteen years.  Emmy-winning and Oscar-nominated
for her first and only other major film role ("The Color Purple"), she is
a best selling author and now sings her television show's theme song.  She
would probably win the Presidency if she wanted.  Still, I entered
"Beloved" with reservations.  When it comes to adaptations, Toni
Morrison's novel is not film-friendly and had tremendous risk of failure.
Sometimes, as is the case with "Beloved," the risk can turn into a
powerful experience.  </P>
<P>        I have read "Beloved" twice and still cannot grasp all of its
intricacies.  I watched with my parents, who have never before read the
book.  This allowed me to judge if reading the book is needed for the
film.  Aside from being able to follow the plot, previous knowledge will
not enhance or detract from the experience.  </P>
<P>        Beloved follows the story of ex-slave Sethe (Oprah Winfrey) eight
years after the end of the Civil War.  An old friend from the plantation
she worked, Paul D (Danny Glover) arrives on her doorstep after wandering
for eighteen years after his own escape.  There he finds Sethe and her
daughter Denver (Kimberly Elise) living in a house haunted by the demons
of Sethe's past.  Her house is possessed by the spirit of the baby
daughter she killed right after her escape to spare her from being claimed
by the master.  This daughter, Beloved (Thandie Newton), returns home in
the body of a teenager further haunting and suffocating the life out of
everyone in the house.</P>
<P>        The story is told partly through flashbacks from Sethe's point of
view.  Director Jonathan Demme weaves image after image of the
psychologically horrific reality that slavery must have been:  the
slaveholder's sons sucking Sethe's nursing milk from her body as Sethe
would have seen it, the spinning delirium of running away from evil not
knowing who is following, the bloody terror of whipping, the gagging and
hanging of slaves.  Demme's use of extreme close-up locks the viewer into
this trauma in almost the same way Stephen Spielberg brought the audience
into the battlefield in "Saving Private Ryan."  It is a grotesque and
nerve-wracking ride, but well worth the struggle. </P>
<P>        While the direction is inspired, the performances keep the focus
on the characters and story.   The characters of Sethe, Denver, and
Beloved are so deep and layered, "Beloved" should be a woman's acting
dream.   Beah Richards as Baby Suggs, Sethe's soulful mother-in-law that
we see through flashback, is commanding in her small, but pivotal
performance.  Demme is known as an actor's director, and he pulls out
career-defining performances from all the leads.</P>
<P>        I found potentially five acting Oscar nominations that could arise
out of "Beloved."  Yet since 1977, the year I was born, there have been
thirteen Academy Award nominated black actors.  Only one woman, Whoopi
Goldberg ("Ghost" - 1990), has won in that time.   Keep in mind, too, that
only five of the past one hundred acting nominees have been black.
Unfortunately, I do not see this year equaling that total no matter how
good they are.  Then again, maybe Hollywood will put away its bias this
year.</P>
<P>        Oprah Winfrey is almost a shoo-in for the Best Actress
trophy, putting in one of the top performances of the decade.  Kimberly
Elise is riveting as Denver as is Beah Richards.  Danny Glover shines as
Paul D and should score his long overdue first nomination.  But the show
really belongs to Thandie Newton who outdid Morrison in creating a
tangible Beloved.  </P>
<P>        Newton first appears walking out of a lake covered in bugs,
huskily breathing like an alien inside a human body.  She walks as if
uncomfortable in her skin, talks in growly monotone, and eats with
reckless abandon.  Beloved is an unbridled and undeveloped soul trapped in
a human body, and is a creation different from anything in the movies.
Newton exhibits a range of often volatile emotions and unrepressed
sexuality in a sincere, intense, and extremely brave performance.  This
should put her on the acting map for a long time.</P>
<P>        "Beloved" deserves to be seen, but I fear that much of the public
will dismiss it because of its length and complexity.  It is as complex as
the novel, and should leave more questions than answers.  Painful and
frightening, my father mentioned that it unintentionally made for a great
horror movie.  But that is what good films do.  They transcend the
boundaries set by conventional wisdom.</P>
<P>        Toni Morrison endorses "Beloved," always a good sign for a film.
It is a vision that Oprah held for ten years that has finally come to
fruition.  As a result of this labor, we might have a close Oscar race for
the first time in years.  This is one of the best films you will see in
1998, joining "Saving Private Ryan" and "The Spanish Prisoner."  Submerge
yourself in this entrancing film and savor it.  Films this deeply driven
by character do not come around often.  </P>
