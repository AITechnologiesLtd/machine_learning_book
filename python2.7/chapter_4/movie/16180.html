<P>In these days of lawyer-jokes, the legal profession could use some
redemption. It comes in "A Civil Action," which is excellent, intelligent,
touching,complex, impeccably scripted, directed, produced and beautifully
served by all its performers.</P>
<P>It's a true story, one that gave birth to a prize-winning book. In the
1970s, in Woburn, Mass., many children died of leukemia. It was a mystery
for most people, but not for their parents who identified the culprit:
water polluted --better yet, poisoned--by two industrial giants, the Grace
Co, and Beatrice Foods.</P>
<P>The Boston firm of Jean Schlichtmann (Travolta), a personal-injury lawyer
(aka an ambulance chaser) is doing very well. When the children's families
ask him to take their case, Travolta politely declines. On the way to
Woburn in his speeding Porsche, he gets a ticket. On the way back,whether
by cinematic device or real coincidence-- I cannot tell , but it matters
little--comes a second ticket, next to the very location of the toxic
dumping.</P>
<P>Is Schlichtmann having an epiphany? Does it dawn on him that a win over the
mega-corporations could fill his firm's coffers? Is it a combination of
both? Hard to tell. But he takes the case and, in the long run, becomes
haunted by it, to the point that he and his associates have to keep
borrowing from banks, mortgaging their possessions, homes, insurance
policies, and going broke.</P>
<P>The fluid, meticulous but unforced script and direction are by Steven
Zaillian, who rightly jumped to fame with his scenario for Schindler's
List. His credits also include the writing (from other true-story books)
the hospital-based Awakenings, and The Search for Bobby Fisher (Zaillian's
first directorial job) about  a child who was a chess prodigy.</P>
<P>All those titles, plus the scenario for the fictional Jack the Bear, are of
works that move and highlight Zaillian's unquestionable compassion. He
moves you without resorting to kitsch, phony dramatics, manipulation of
emotions. A Civil Action avoids flamboyance, yet shines by its empathy for
human misery. It is also a great thriller-plus-courtroom drama, superior
because of its (mostly) low-key approach, its refusal to yield to flashy
dramatics, its exceptionally good characterizations, whether full-blown or
just sketched in.</P>
<P>At the root of the film we have a David and Goliath story of common
working-class people against corporate King Kongs, and of a small law firm
versus the infinite funds of Grace and Beatrice. The latter's platoons of
lawyers are headed by a powerhouse memorably --if a little too colorfully--
played by Robert Duvall, a prince of foxes.</P>
<P>Every moment counts in the suspenseful depiction of who will outsmart whom,
which strings will be pulled. Each deposition is a self-contained,
mesmerizing drama. We are made painfully conscious that this David is not
the Biblical one; that lawsuits seldom win outright; that the whole
procedure is a preamble to settlements; that  of fifty appeals, only five
win in the courts.</P>
<P>Of course, the film gets its momentum and its thrills from the use of the
tricks of the movie trade, but these are in pastels rather than screaming
colors. From photography to editing, from framing to continuity, from
dialogue or confrontations to the first-rate score by Danny Elfman, the
picture remains discreet and unexplosive.</P>
<P>To put the movie in a historical context, we are, in a sense, in
postmodern, post-post-post-Frank Capra populist territory of the little
people and the Masters of the Land, all framed by the fact-of-life that
Justice and the Law are far from synonymous.</P>
<P>Details are chosen with extraordinary care, from repressed tearfulness, to
the gradual impoverishment of the smaller law-firm, to the Harvard Club
encounter of Travolta and Grace's CEO. He is wonderfully, quirkily played
by director Sydney Pollack.</P>
<P>As for Travolta --or should I say Lazarus? -- I'll just say that he
continues his extraordinary comeback like a speeding bullet.</P>
