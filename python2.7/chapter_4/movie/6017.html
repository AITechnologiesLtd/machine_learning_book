<P>     All of the sudden, after years of languishing in art houses and=20
specialty film festivals, the luminaries of Hong Kong cinema are=20
breaking into the mainstream American market.  Jackie Chan, one of the=20
best-known action stars in the world, scored a modest financial hit with=20
RUMBLE IN THE BRONX. Actor Chow Yun-Fat has been working on something=20
called THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS. Director John Woo already has two=20
English-language features under his belt (HARD TARGET and BROKEN ARROW),=20
and there are more to come.  Now, another of Hong Kong's celebrated film=20
makers, Ringo Lam (director of CITY ON FIRE, which is the likely=20
inspiration for Quentin Tarantino's RESERVOIR DOGS), has reached U.S.=20
screens.  His Hollywood debut is called MAXIMUM RISK, and everyone=20
eagerly awaiting the film's release is in for a big disappointment.</P>
<P>     Watching MAXIMUM RISK, I had the feeling I'd seen the film before. =20
I hadn't, of course, but the generic nature of the plot and action=20
sequences, not to mention the presence of Jean-Claude Van Damme, made=20
everything seem all-too-familiar.  If I hadn't known beforehand that Lam=20
was the director, I never would have guessed it.  MAXIMUM RISK displays=20
little of the style that has gained the film maker an international=20
following.  This is the kind of job that a hack director could have=20
accomplished.</P>
<P>     The plot is rather convoluted, and frequently doesn't make sense,=20
but I'll try to present the cogent details here, for anyone who's=20
interested.  Van Damme plays a dual role.  He starts off as Mikhail=20
Suverov, a high-ranking member of the Russian Mob's American chapter. =20
When Mikhail is killed in a car chase in South France, a French cop who=20
looks eerily like the dead man is brought into the case.  As it turns=20
out, the policeman, named Alain Moreau, is actually Mikhail's twin=20
(screenwriter Larry Ferguson must have been watching a soap opera when=20
he came up with this twist).  The two were separated shortly after birth=20
when their mother realized she couldn't care for them both.  Now, with=20
Mikhail dead, Alain is determined to discover all he can about his=20
brother's life and death.  His investigation leads him to New York and=20
Mikhail's girl friend, Alex Minetti (Natasha Henstridge).  Alain also=20
meets a sadistic gangster named Ivan (Zach Grenier), a bunch of ugly=20
thugs, and a group of crooked FBI agents.  Soon, he and Alex are in over=20
their heads, and running for their lives. =20</P>
<P>     We're talking pedestrian action here.  There are all the usual=20
staples:  car chases, foot chases through moving traffic, foot chases=20
across rooftops, fist fights (with a little kick-boxing thrown in for=20
good measure), and shootouts.  I kept expecting Lam to do something=20
unique, but, by the time the end credits started rolling, I realized it=20
was a vain hope.  This is just another story of Van Damme hunting, and=20
being hunted by, a variety of stereotypical bad guys.  There's no room=20
in the formula for improvisation or originality.</P>
<P>     Van Damme's presence is an immediate disadvantage (just ask John=20
Woo; the action star headlined his American debut, HARD TARGET, which=20
went down in flames at the box office).  While the actor is capable of=20
handling action sequences, his acting range can charitably be described=20
as "limited", so any emotional component to MAXIMUM RISK is=20
irretrievably lost.   We're supposed to believe that Alain is distraught=20
over the death of the brother he never knew he had, but Van Damme's=20
wooden expression doesn't get the point across.</P>
<P>     Then there's Natasha Henstridge as The Love Interest.  In SPECIES,=20
she didn't show much in the way of acting ability, but wasn't shy about=20
displaying her physical attributes.  Here, this cookie-cutter role=20
doesn't exactly challenge her range, but it gives her another=20
opportunity to expose the assets that were much in evidence in that=20
previous outing.  Beyond that, however, there's not much to Alex, and=20
any romantic heat that might have been generated is diffused by the=20
complete lack of chemistry between the leads.  Henstridge and Van Damme=20
together couldn't light a cigarette.</P>
<P>     It's reasonable to hope that Lam agreed to direct this movie=20
because it was a means of entrance into the American film market.  Even=20
then, however, there's no denying that this is the most unpromising of=20
beginnings.  It took John Woo three years to recover from working with=20
Van Damme.  Let's hope the same misfortune doesn't befall Lam.  As for a=20
trip to the theaters=85 instead of seeing MAXIMUM RISK, rent one of Lam's=20
Hong Kong films.  They highlight the talent that is woefully unapparent=20
in this generic action flick.</P>
