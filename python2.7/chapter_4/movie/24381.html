"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>You've probably seen films with overlapping storylines, but you've never
seen anything quite like Time Code.  Like Robert Altman's Short Cuts or
P.T. Anderson's Magnolia, where the lives of seemingly unrelated
characters cross paths almost by chance, Code one-ups its predecessors
(technically, at least) by allowing viewers to watch each story uniquely
unfold by splitting the screen into quarters and showing four different
plots developing at the same time.</P>
<P>Gimmicky?  You bet.  Potentially annoying?  Perhaps.  But the Brady
Bunch-esque split-screen isn't the only unique element of Code.  It's
one of the first pictures to be shot entirely in digital format instead
of using film, which allows Code to be filmed in one long, ninety-three
minute shot (standard cameras only hold enough film for about ten
minutes).  There is no editing.  And no script, either - director Mike
Figgis (Miss Julie) gave his actors a general idea of what he wanted in
terms of Code's plot, but most of what unfurls onscreen is improvised.</P>
<P>But wait, there's more.  The four hand-held digital cameras all began
filming at the same time, so the film progresses in real time.  So
basically Figgis sent a group of about thirty actors with no script to
improvise to four cameramen and - ninety-three minutes later - had a
completed picture.  Figgis' premise is audacious and groundbreaking, and
it really makes you realize how awful and unoriginal films like Here on
Earth and Where the Heart Is really are.</P>
<P>Code's story (there isn't much of one – remember, it's improvised)
focuses on Red Mullet, a film production company in Los Angeles.
Mullet's employees are your typically jaded Hollywood types and are
portrayed by (among others) Holly Hunter (Living Out Loud), Steven
Weber  (Wings) and Suzy Nakamura (The West Wing).  Stellan Skarsgård
(Deep Blue Sea) plays Alex Green, one of Mullet's founders and the
thread that holds Code together.  Alex is a drunk, which affects his
relationship with his co-workers and his wife (Deep Blue Sea co-star
Saffron Burrows), and he's having a fling with a struggling bisexual
actress  (Salma Hayek, Dogma), who has a dangerously suspicious lover
(Jeanne Tripplehorn, Mickey Blue Eyes).</P>
<P>While I'm not sure how much of the film is improvised, Code's acting is
pretty well done (a surprising portion of the acting talent in this film
will also appear in Wim Wenders' upcoming film The Million Dollar
Hotel).  Like any decent film about southern California, Code also
prominently features earthquakes, drug use, booze, sex and lesbians
(there are two girl-on-girl make-out scenes - Hayek vs. Tripplehorn and
Burrows vs. Leslie Mann).  There's even a bit of self-mockery thrown in
for good measure, which makes Figgis' slightly pretentious concept seem
a bit easier to swallow.</P>
<P>1:33 - R for drug use, sexual content, adult language and violence</P>
