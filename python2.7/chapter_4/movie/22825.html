<PRE>"Topsy-Turvy" - Gilbert and Sullivan Charms the Big
Screen
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>Long before Andrew Lloyd Webber and the days of Rogers
and Hammerstein, there was the era of William Schwenck
Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan.  These two comprised one
of the most prolific show business teams of their
time.  Gilbert and Sullivan were responsible for a
string of memorable (and some not-so-memorable) comic
operas put upon the London stage during the late 19th
century.  </P>
<P>However, their creative juices would begin to run dry.
 Praised for such dandy showpieces as "The Pirates of
Penzance" and "H.M.S. Pinafore," the duo's next
offering, "Princess Ida," is labeled as formulaic and
predictable by an influential London Times critic. 
This infuriates librettist Gilbert (John Broadbent),
who believes that "Ida" is a great play.  However,
composer Sullivan (Allan Corduner) ruefully agrees
that "Ida" does feel a bit recycled.  Worse yet,
Sullivan's health is failing.  He declares that he
needs some time to rest before being able to continue
composing new songs.  In the meantime, the sweltering
summer heat is keeping audiences away from the
theatres, so box office receipts are steadily
declining.  And, there seems to be a variety of
personal problems that are brewing among the cast
members.  This all amounts to a serious setback and
does not bode well at all.</P>
<P>"Topsy-Turvy" is a sweet film that focuses on this
particular period of this partnership's lives when it
seemed that the two were ready to split up over
creative differences.  In a meeting that the two have
to discuss their future and current impasse, Sullivan
explains that he has always understated his music to
Gilbert's words.  Surprised to hear this, Gilbert
interjects that he has always subordinated his words
to the grandness of the music.  Yet, despite their
mutual respect for one another, they can not move
forward.  Gilbert's latest idea is an opera about a
couple who finds a magic potion.  Sullivan fires back
that his idea is none too different from a recent
production about a couple that finds a magic lozenge
and none too different from another recent production
about a couple that finds a magic coin.</P>
<P>It is not until Gilbert visits a Japanese exhibition
that his creativity becomes reinvigorated.  Gilbert is
entranced by a Kendo sword fighting demonstration, the
raw emotions brought forth through a kabuki play, and
a dainty tea ceremony where the waitress can only say
"six pence, please."  This experience steers him
towards a new and better work, eventually turning out
to be "The Mikado."  Sullivan, now feeling better,
loves the idea and begins to set his words to music.</P>
<P>Like many British films, the strength of this one is
its charm.  I credit most of it to the wonderful sense
of frivolity that exists during this time period where
music and laughter, good manners and wonderful dress
seemed like the guiding principles of the day.  I
especially enjoyed Broadbent's portrayal of Gilbert
who seemed to always suffer in deadpan silence in his
struggle to create his next great work.  In one
passage, he talks about his estranged mother.  "No one
respects her more than I do," he says.  "And I can't
stand the woman!"  I also appreciated the sacrifice
that the cast, chorus and orchestra members went
through as they prepared for the show (having once
been myself an orchestra member for my high school
plays).  "Topsy-Turvy" is not the typical film that
presents a problem, dramatic arc, and then a solution.
 Writer Mike Leigh does not write for Hollywood. 
Thus, Gilbert and Sullivan's dilemma is not a race
towards some glorious resolution.  Rather, it is more
like a leisurely walk through a Victorian park that
unveils delicate beauty in every direction you look.</P>
