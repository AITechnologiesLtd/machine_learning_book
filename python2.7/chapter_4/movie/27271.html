<P>   This one's addressed to the men...when you were in high
school, did you have fantasies about women who were about
your own age, in your own class for example, or did you
fancy women who were a decade or so older than you? 
We're told that nowadays teens consider anyone more than
ten years older than they are to be over the hill, not worth
considering as real people.  Stereotype this may be: But
another convention is that European men actually prefer
women to be considerably older, or at least they do not
consider age a barrier to a good relationship.  This may have
been particularly true before the sixties, and indeed if you
watch Giuseppe Tornatore's new movie "Malena," which he
adapted for the screen from Luciano Vincenzoni's story, you
get the impression that the young Sicilian guys of the early
1940s in one particular medium-sized town drooled
exclusively over the 27-year-old Malena Scordia (Monica
Bellucci).  Maybe one or two teen-aged women make
appearances in the film, just briefly, but for Tornatore's
purposes there is only desirable female in the entire
municipality.</P>
<P>   Soaking his movie in the obligatory brown hue which is the
way warm climes situated in the past are photographed,
Tornatore uses Renato Amoroso (Giuseppe Sulfaro) as his
spokesman. Renato is a lad lucky enough to own a bike
during a critical time that just about everything was in short
supply.  He joins a gang--which in those days meant not a
group that indulged in pot or coke or crime or basketball, but
whose raison d'etre was dribbling over one particularly
comely individual.  Malena, daughter of the deaf Professor
Bonsignore who is the teacher of the young men, is married
to a man who is at the front and reported dead.  Though
Malena at first appears to be untouchable, gossip quickly
spreads that she has been involved in several affairs--with
the town's lawyer, its dentist, and ultimately the German
officers who take up occupation in the town in 1943.  When
the war ends, the women of the town take near-biblical
revenge on the object of their long-term envy, while young
Renato feels helpless to protect her form the enraged and
mostly homely lynch mob.</P>
<P>   Tornatore's magnum opus was "Cinema Paradiso," about
the love of a young boy for the movie theater in his small
Italian town during the late forties--a warm tribute to the art of
the film.  "Malena" by contrast is an overly simple tale
highlighting a woman who has so few lines that we know little
of her motivations or her very character.  Perhaps her
silence, her seeming obliviousness to the stares she receives
from literally everyone she passes on the cobblestoned
Sicilian streets, gives her the aura of mystery that informs the
boys' wet dreams.  But with Renato's looking consistently
soulful (in fact in downright psychic pain) throughout--unless
he is actually being physically tormented by his cartoonish
parents (Luciano Federico and Matilde Piana), we in the
audience are simply starved for stimuli.  Nor does the film's
derivativeness help.  Take another look at Robert Mulligan's
"Summer of '42," the 1971 movie about a teen with a crush
on a young war bride (played by Jennifer O'Neill) which also
captures the flavor of the 1940s and possesses a delightful
Michel Legrand score.</P>
