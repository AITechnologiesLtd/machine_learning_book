<PRE>DISNEY'S THE KID
----------------</PRE>
<P>Russ Duritz (Bruce Willis) is fast approaching his 40th birthday. He's a
successful image consultant, makes a lot of money, and has an expensive home
and a fancy car. But, he's a loser when it comes to the things that count in 
life - a family, friends, and people who care. Russ is at an emotional 
crossroads and, though he doesn't realize it, needs help. A pudgy 8-year old 
boy named Rusty (Spencer Breslin) arrives on his doorstep. When Russ realizes 
that Rusty is himself, 32-years ago, he makes a start on the road to personal 
redemption in "Disney's The Kid."</P>
<PRE>ROBIN:</PRE>
<P>It gives me a chill when I see a movie title include the name of the company
that made it. When I saw the title of "Disney's The Kid," I knew that the
family entertainment giant was trying a little misdirection, as if to say, 
"Pay no attention to this movie. Just look who made it! That's the important 
thing." It isn't. The story is the important thing and "The Kid" lacks a good 
one.</P>
<P>"If only I knew what I know now when I was growing up...." Everyone has said
this to himself or herself at least once and probably many times over the
years.  It's an interesting premise, like time travel, and one that is ripe 
with possibilities. Unfortunately, the screenplay by Audrey Wells
("Guinevere")
doesn't capitalize on the idea. Basically, the story for "The Kid" is about a
pretty unlikable character, Russ, who happens to be very good at what he does.
His consultation business is lucrative and his clients are happy with his
efforts, but nobody likes the man. Even his loyal assistant, Janet (Lily
Tomlin), seems to tolerate the taciturn, often rude, style that defines Russ.</P>
<P>When Russ's alter ego, Rusty, arrives on the scene, there is no explanation,
aside from some vague magical incidents that don't explain anything. The boy
just appears out of the blue with a toy airplane, which Russ believes is his
from 32 years ago. Matching birthmarks and scars, the pair realizes that they
are the same person, but separated by decades. From here on in, it's a matter
of who helps whom. Rusty sees his future life as, "I'm 40, I don't fly jets 
and I don't have a dog. I'm a loser!" Russ sees his past life as something to 
be forgotten. This odd little couple must come to grips with their life
crises 
and turn to each other for help. Russ shows Rusty how to defend himself
against
bullies, while Rusty teaches Russ the importance of nurturing the kid within.</P>
<P>Bruce Willis seems to have made a career choice to star in film with kids.
"Mercury Rising" and "The Sixth Sense" come to mind with the former a
thriller,
the later a horror flick, and both starring a little boy, too. "The Kid" is a
comedy, but no one apparently told Willis that his latest is supposed to be
funny as he gives a humorless performance as Russ. Compounding Willis's wooden
perf is the unendearing one by little Spencer Breslin as Rusty. The kid
schleps
around and endlessly complains of not having a dog (and you know where that's
going to go. As you do with just about everything in the movie.) Young Breslin
doesn't have the personality or charm to make you like him. In the end, you
don't care about either Russ or Rusty.</P>
<P>The supporting cast is lightweight in number and the players are allowed to be
symbols only. Emily Mortimer, as Russ's assistant Amy, is the obvious love
interest in the film, though why she would deign to be seen in the company of
her rude boss is a question I asked more than once. The script covers this by
having Amy declare to Russ, "I [sometimes] see the kid in you." I'm glad she
does, because I never did. Nonetheless, Mortimer is pretty and perky in the
role. Jean Smart gets some mileage as a middle-aged southern belle who
relocates to LA as a news anchor. Her Deirdre becomes Russ's muse and
advisor, 
basically telling him the obvious - let the inner kid out.</P>
<P>The production, led by helmer John Turteltaub, is straightforward. There is
little to take note of as the team behind the camera goes through the motions
of capturing the action. There's not a lot of passion in front of or behind
the
camera.</P>
<P>When I first saw the trailers for "Disney's The Kid," I was less than
enthusiastic about seeing it. Now, having been there, I find my instincts were
correct. Save your money (or, go see "Chicken Run" instead). I give it a D+.</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>Bruce Willis once again braves sharing the screen with a child (and TWO
dogs, including a handicapped one!) in "Disney's the Kid."  He's Russ Duritz, 
an image consultant with a long-suffering assistant (Lily Tomlin) who buffers 
him from his father and an employee, Amy (Emily Mortimer, "Love's Labour's 
Lost") who keeps having her hopes of finding his good side dashed.</P>
<P>We witness a day in the life of Russ, where he treats people rudely (although
the script, by Audrey Wells ("Guinevere"), needed some real toughening up
in this regard) and engineers a media moment with a bunch of kids recruited
at a baseball game to save a dishonorable client.  Amy protests (script
problems again - why would she work for this guy if she constantly rejects
his 
methods?) and Russ redeems himself by tossing the video.  Of course, he then 
has to spoil the good will he's generated by shoving her childlike enthusiasm 
for a perfect moon back in her face.</P>
<P>Then things get really weird when it appears a little kid is breaking into
his highly secure LA home.  (And, oh yeah, he's been buzzed by a bright red
biplane, too.)  A toy plane is left on Russ' doorstep and then he catches
the kid, who claims the plane because his name, Rusty, is painted on the
bottom.  Turns out - surprise - that this is Russ' plane and he's just been
introduced to himself as a child.</P>
<P>"Disney's the Kid" is an odd hybrid of a movie - the Disney inserted in the
title implies a kids' film, but it's really a midlife crisis flick mixed
with some fantastical time travel elements (the pilot plus multi-generational
male bonding aspect recalls Mel Gibson's "Forever Young").  Unfortunately the
story never seems to get out of the concept phase and Turteltaub's
("Phenomenon," "Instinct") direction is bland, but the cast can't be faulted.
Willis generously lets his costars shine, even as his character is undone
by writing that can't live up to its convictions (Russ doesn't seem unhappy
with his lot until he's made aware that he should be).  Young Spencer Breslin
(TV commercials) is a solid foil, never playing for the sap factor and 
able to pull off his disdain for 'a dogless, chickless guy' as being a loser
(he also does a pretty good job with the 'Holy smokes' signature line he
must say repeatedly).</P>
<P>Support really shines in this centerless film with Lily Tomlin's Janet 
leading the pack in a naturally comic performance as the power behind the
throne.  Jean Smart (a vet of screenwriter Wells' "Guinevere") exudes warmth 
in a small but pivotal role of a new LA news anchor who gets free advice from 
the early, begrudging Russ in order to pop up later and return the favor more 
generously.  Emily Mortimer finally establishes herself with a character that
actually has a personality (her performances in "Scream 3" and "Love's
Labour's
Lost" hardly being memorable).  She holds her own against both Willis and
Breslin with adroit charm.</P>
<P>"Disney's the Kid" continues to waste its potential with an overly
sappy, overly 'happily ever after' ending that would actually make life
almost 
not worth living for the two different-aged Russes if any of these pedestrian 
filmmakers stopped to think about it.  </P>
