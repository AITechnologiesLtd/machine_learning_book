<P>Just two weeks ago, I reviewed a movie in which sixteen different kinds
of devil spirits could be identified as influencing the actions of the on
screen characters.  Of course, there are more than just those sixteen
classifications.  Now I understand why the one film only used the sixteen.
The others were needed on the set of FIGHT CLUB, a disturbing and twisted
cinematic roller coaster of a ride.</P>
<P>David Fincher (SEVEN) does not flinch or shy away from depicting a
nihilistic view of society.  Instead he embraces the challenge of making
two self-destructive characters his likable leads.  He paints the bleak
and darkly comedic picture with the skill and adeptness of a genuine
auteur.  The film is original, inventive, and spiritually nauseating all
at the same time.</P>
<P>Edward Norton (AMERICAN HISTORY X) narrates the film for us as Jack, an
insomniac so disillusioned and disenfranchised with life that he regularly
visits different support groups in order to experience some kind of
cathartic release which enables him to sleep.  Testicular Cancer,
Alcoholics Anonymous, Brain Tumors R Us... it doesn't matter, although it
would appear that the more painful the affliction, the greater the
emotional release.  Ergo, the sweeter the sleep.</P>
<P>His need for this perverse charade is eliminated once he meets Tyler
Durden (Brad Pitt, MEET JOE BLACK).  In hindsight, his continuing the
pretense of having testicular cancer would have been a lot saner than
following the direction of this charasmatic, unconventional, soap
salesman.   Together, Tyler and Jack discover the therapuetic benefits of
beating the living daylights out of another human being (or conversely,
being knocked senseless by another person).</P>
<P>Dubbing their new organization "Fight Club," they begin attracting other
followers who, like them, want to fight another person in order to feel
the adrenaline rush through their bodies, even as their blood is pouring
out.  Only then do they truly feel "alive."</P>
<P>This perverse type of logic runs throughout the film.  More and more
"members" are recruited, joining what has become a "don't ask, don't tell,
don't think" army.  Having two men pummel one another is no longer
sufficient for Tyler's demented psyche, so plans for "Operation Mayhem"
are put into action.  Fight Club takes on the shape of an underground
terrorist organization with their aggression turning outward, targeting
the societal ills Tyler deems "responsible" for the desperate plight of
mankind.</P>
<P>Jack watches the evolution of the Fight Club he helped to found, feeling
a bit left out as the club takes on a life of its own, moving inexorably
to an end he cannot control.</P>
<P>The acting is superb, both Mr. Pitt and Mr. Norton demonstrating their
consummate talents in difficult and complex roles.  Helena Bonham Carter
(THE THEORY OF FLIGHT) is very much their acting equal as a tough but
troubled girl who inserts herself into Jack's life and home, first by
invading his support groups and later by engaging in a violently sexual
relationship with Tyler.  Meat Loaf (CRAZY IN ALABAMA) and Jared Leto
(URBAN LEGEND) also provide strong support as two very different Fight
Club members.</P>
<P>As artistically fascinating as the movie may be, the spiritual sickness
that it depicts is, at the very least, distasteful.  While I have given
the movie high praise for its artistic elements and director's vision, the
lack of a star rating indicates my strongest caution.  This is a movie
that depicts characters with no spiritual insight and therefore no defense
against devilish logic, influence or possession.  The "glitzy" style and
the boisterous performances may make it palatable for today's audiences,
but when stripped down to its ugly essence, the negative anti-social
messages at its core give nihilists worldwide something for which to cheer.</P>
<P>At one point, the no-named, dehumanized members of Tyler's army learn
that upon dying, one becomes "human" and finally worthy of being called by
a proper name.  This sick message is something the author of death would
dearly love to promote.</P>
