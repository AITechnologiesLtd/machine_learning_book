<PRE>                            MEET THE PARENTS
                    A film review by Christopher Null
                      Copyright 2000 filmcritic.com

<P>     Pity poor Greg Focker.  Not only is the man employed as a male
nurse with an unfortunate name, but he's about to meet his girlfriend's
parents in order to ask dad for her hand in marriage.  Only dad is about
as humorless as, say, Robert De Niro.  And poor Greg can't do anything
right to save his skin.</P>
<P>     It all reminds me, with flashback-like intensity, of meeting my own
father-in-law-to-be, a guy so stern he makes De Niro look like Jim
Carrey.  Picture Ben Stiller as Focker (or me) and De Niro as himself,
and, like magic, you've got yourself one hell of a comedy that will see
few equals this year or any other.  (Note to Dr. Carder: This is just a
joke that I know you'll laugh about because we have such a great
relationship!  See you this Christmas!!!)</P>
<P>     De Niro comes off surprisingly perfect as the straight man to
Stiller's streetwise doofus, equally apt in his role as the guy who will
never be good enough for the girl (Teri Polo).  At first we see De
Niro's Jack as a harmless but hard-nosed retiree, with Focker (a name
which is repeatedly said aloud with great comic effect) doing everything
in his power to make dad like him.</P>
<P>     But as things like this typically go, nothing works out, and before
long the septic tank has overflowed, a fire has been started, the other
daughter's wedding has been ruined, and an incident involving a
champagne bottle, and urn, and a very naughty cat have filled your eyes
with tears so thick you can't see the screen.  Which is no good, because
you can't hear anything either due to all the laughter.  I literally
found myself gasping for breath during Meet the Parents' most comic
moments, wishing I could rewind the film.</P>
<P>     Ultimately, Meet the Parents is one of the funniest comedies I've
seen since Annie Hall, a film with which it shares a wry sensibility
about modern romance.  Jack, his true nature revealed, is so obsessed
with perfection for his daughter that he gives Greg a lie detector test
about his past.  Greg is so obsessed with making a good impression he
spray-paints a stray cat to look like Jack's pet when it goes missing. 
All of these situations are, against all expectations, utterly
believable, and invariably they are hilarious.  To top all that, somehow
the film has been kept suitable for teens with a PG-13 rating, yet it is
perfect for couples with its upbeat love story, and equally good for
anyone looking for a good comedy where they can let go and yuk it up.</P>
<P>     Director Hal Roach (of Austin Powers fame) handles the camera well,
framing Focker in scenes that would be worthy of The Fugitive if they
weren't so funny.  I can't think of much in the film that isn't done
equally well.  Randy Newman's title song "A Fool in Love" should earn an
Oscar nomination, along with the script and the two lead actors if
there's any justice in the world.  Altogether, Meet the Parents is one
of few films that I can highly recommend to anyone.</P>
<P>     But perhaps the best part of the film is its ending, which leaves
plenty of room for at least two sequels.  Like me, I'm sure you'll be
hoping they decide to make them before you're even back to the parking
lot.</P>
