<P>     FATHER'S DAY is an unfunny, unmoving sentimental comedy, about two
middle-aged men (Robin Williams and Billy Crystal) who team up to find a
17-year-old runaway who may or may not be one or the other's son.  For-
get the missing jokes, or the glaring lack of sympathetic characters, or
the wasted talents of two talented comedians, or the throwaway role for 
Julia Louis-Dreyfus.  Most stupefying is the premise itself:  we are to
believe that a happily married woman (Natassia Kinski) has no other re-
course than to contact her decades-since-seen lovers?  I mean, her
husband is already on the case.  Doesn't she have any friends or family
who can also assist?  Idiotic.  Directed by Ivan Reitman and written by
Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, all of whom can do (and have done)
better.</P>
