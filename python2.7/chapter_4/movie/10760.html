Saboteur (1942)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 65</PRE>
<P>"Saboteur" is not one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films,
but it is a good film despite all its problems.
The plot lacks credibility at times, and the acting
is surprisingly hammy.  However, the story is exciting,
and there is some fine cinematography.</P>
<P>The plot has a young man (Robert Cummings) falsely
accused of blowing up a factory.  He eludes the police
while searching for the real saboteur (Norman Lloyd) 
to prove his innocence.  He uncovers a major network
of saboteurs, headed by wealthy and respected members
of society.  Will Cummings escape these agents?  Will
the police believe his story?  Will the saboteurs
succeed in their evil plans?  Will Cummings win the
heart of pouty love interest Priscilla Lane?</P>
<P>Cummings was not Hitchcock's first choice.  They would
work together again in "Dial M for Murder", so
Hitchcock must have been pleased with his acting.
Certainly Cummings is likeable, and probably it is
the fault of the script, but he delivers multiple
fiery patriotic speeches that become jingoistic.
His character also commits many crimes in order
to prove his innocence (kidnapping, stealing a horse,
escape, resisting arrest, etc), an oxymoron that
is shared by similar films such as "The Fugitive".</P>
<P>There may be some spoilers in the following paragraphs.</P>
<P>I had complaints with other characters as well.
Cummings encounters a truck driver and a blind man who
are willing to break the law to help a fugitive from
justice whom they have just met.  Lane, who has the world's
biggest lips, is kidnapped by Cummings when she attempts
to turn him in.  Initially she despises him and thinks
him guilty.  For no apparent reason, she suddenly changes
her mind and does all she can for him.  When the evil
saboteurs finally catch them, they fail to kill them
or even physically restrain them.  These are the same
people who plot to blow up ships and dams?</P>
<P>Cummings plays Superman in the final scenes of the movie.
He manages to escape, guesses the next sabotage act
correctly, manages to prevent it, tells all to the police,
who believe and release him despite his status as
America's Most Wanted.  He then finds the saboteur,
and nearly kills himself while trying to save the
saboteur's life.  All in a day's work, I suppose.</P>
<P>But "Saboteur" is still a good movie.  It is exciting
and loaded with action and (albeit heavy-handed) drama.
The cinematography is occasionally outstanding, with
great shots of the ship launch, the Statue of Liberty,
a ritzy party, city skyscrapers, and of course, the 
famous scene of the saboteur falling.</P>
