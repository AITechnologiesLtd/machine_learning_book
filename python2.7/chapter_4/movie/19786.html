<PRE>IDLE HANDS</PRE>
<P>There have been many classic films that provide a nearly flawless balance
between comedy and horror. Two of the most successful, EVIL DEAD 2 and AN
AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON, seem to have been the biggest inspirations for the
new attempted black comedy IDLE HANDS. Unfortunately, the new film is neither
as funny or as scary as its predecessors.</P>
<P>Devon Sawa plays a teenage stoner who finds his right hand possessed by an
evil force that causes him to go on a killing spree. His victims include his
two best friends (Seth Green and Eldon Henson) who come back as zombies because
they are too lazy to move on to the afterlife. There is plenty of mildly
amusing humor involving pot smoking and severed heads, but a lot of it is stuff
we've seen done better before in films like REANIMATOR. 
The stoner stuff is generally more successful than the mutilation slapstick:
Sawa one-ups Sarah Michelle Gellar's cocaine-spoon crucifix in CRUEL INTENTIONS
by wearing a pipe disguised as an asthma inhaler. I also like the scene where
Sawa recognizes two police officers -- "You were seniors when I was a freshman"
- and asks them if they're "holding." The two cops are outraged not so much at
the illegality as at the brazen stupidity of asking cops for weed. Another good
example of the type of humor they're going for is the scene where a horrified
Sawa brings the pre-zombified Green and Henson into his house to show them that
his parents are dead. They don't notice the corpses and assume that their
friend has brought them in to watch the 2 Live Crew video playing on TV. I
myself am always up for a joke involving corpses and 2 Live Crew, and this is a
good one, but it doesn't have good enough timing to come off as anything more
than a cheesy throwaway joke.</P>
<P>There's not a whole lot more to the story. There's not even a full explanation
of where the hand-possession curse came from, why Sawa's character received it
or why he was able to kill his parents without knowing it. What little
explanation there is comes from Vivica A. Fox, who plays a voodoo priestess who
(in the tradition of the bounty hunter guy in JASON GOES TO HELL: THE FINAL
FRIDAY) lives to stab the possessed killer with one of them all powerful magic
dagger things. Jack Noseworthy (star of DEAD AT 21, MTV's embarrassing mid-'90s
attempt at a sci-fi series) plays a local heavy metal enthusiast who drives a
souped-up truck that seems to play Motley Crue's "Shout At the Devil" 24 hours
a day. His funniest moment is when he and Fox (two actors who, I feel compelled
to note, have always bothered me) meet and have an overacting duel.</P>
<P>None of the characters are really fleshed out enough to be likeable or to be
really funny. Most of the leads generate a few laughs, but it's easy to lose
interest in their plight since it's all so lazily sketched out. Particularly
useless is the buxom neighbor chick who Sawa is supposed to have long had a
crush on. You're told that she writes lyrics and plays bass in a band, and that
that's cool, and I guess that's supposed to give her a personality. Although
she is later portrayed as intelligent and heroic, she is instantly charmed by
Sawa, who is frantically wiggling his hand around, making bizarre statements,
drenched in what he claims is cat blood, repeatedly attempting to strangle her.
It's not the most believable teen relationship I've ever seen portrayed on
screen - perhaps it's meant to give hope to today's generation of Last American
Virgins. If this guy can get laid, so can you. And knowing is half the battle.</P>
<P>Although possessed hands had certainly been done before, it seems certain that
the creators of IDLE HANDS were conscious of their film's similarities to the
legendary EVIL DEAD 2 scene in which Ash has a fight with his own hand, then
cuts it off, chases it into a mousehole and hunts it down like Elmer Fudd on
speed. IDLE HANDS never matches the dark looniness of Ash stabbing his own
hand, gleefully shouting "Who's laughing now!?" as the blood sprays on his
face, nor does it have any lowbrow gags as goofily inspired as the severed hand
taunting Ash by giving him the finger. Perhaps Sam Raimi would have known how
to extend the premise to 90 minutes, but these filmmakers don't. While the hand
is only one of many demonic villains in EVIL DEAD 2, it's the only one in IDLE
HANDS, and as the story progresses it becomes increasingly difficult to think
of as a genuine threat. </P>
<P>While watching the CHILD'S PLAY movies (even the first one, which I am able to
take seriously) I often wonder if Chucky could really be such a threat to these
people. I mean yeah, the little bastard might stab you in the knee or
something. But it shouldn't be too hard to fake him out with a little foot tap
on one side of his head and then punt him hard out the window with the other
foot. (If only little Andy had been on the soccer team Chucky never would have
made it to the third act.) The hand in IDLE HANDS is much less menacing than
Chucky, but of course it is able to defy gravity and many other physical laws
and somehow manages to kill a lot of people. (I was thankful for its magic
fighting powers in one of the film's best moments, when it single-evil-handedly
scalps the lead singer of The Offspring.) </P>
<P>IDLE HANDS actually has a very similar feel to parts of BRIDE OF CHUCKY. Both
films seem to be primarily lowbrow comedies, but occasionally there are
humorless murder scenes that make you wonder whether the movie is actually
supposed to be scary. BRIDE OF CHUCKY, however, is the far better film - its
berserk puppet mayhem is enjoyably surreal, despite the many jokes that fall
flat. I like movies where hands crawl around on their own and decapitated guys
walk around carrying their own heads, but I've seen them before. BRIDE OF
CHUCKY is only one of two movies I've seen where murderous puppets have sex,
and it's the best of the two. (So how about that - if you're choosing between
BRIDE OF CHUCKY, IDLE HANDS and MEET THE FEEBLES tonight, you have my
recommendation.)</P>
<P>At one point, NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS director Henry Selick was attached to
this script. It makes you wonder what kind of exquisitely designed imagery and
stop motion severed hand action he had planned. The Selick-less film isn't much
to look at, although to their credit the filmmakers mostly stick to old
fashioned makeup effects rather than trendy CGI techniques (which so far tend
to look out of place in horror films). </P>
<P>As the title implies, the film tries to preach a little bit about laziness
leading to evil. For a while, the story links the hand problem with Sawa's
empty pot-and-television lifestyle. But then it turns out that keeping his
hands occupied really doesn't help, and our heroes smoke up to regain their
strength when it really counts. This is typical of the film - too lazy to
follow through with its theme, too lazy to work as a comedy or as a horror film
or especially as a smooth combination of the two. I didn't hate IDLE HANDS, but
I'd be too lazy to ever go watch it again.</P>
<P>Important note: IDLE HANDS contains the Rob Zombie song "Dragula," which also
appeared recently in THE MATRIX. Another Rob Zombie song, "Living Dead Girl,"
appeared in URBAN LEGEND, BRIDE OF CHUCKY and PSYCHO. And I mean, I like Rob
Zombie. But I think it's time for his movie-soundtrack-hooker-uppers to take a
holiday.</P>
