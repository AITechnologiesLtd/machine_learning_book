<PRE>GLORIA
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Gloria is a remake of the 1980 John Cassavettes drama about a streetwise
woman who ends up protecting a child from the mob.  A good lead
performance keeps this otherwise sluggish film from becoming a disaster,
but it's a mild redemption at most.</P>
<P>Gloria (Sharon Stone) has spent the last three years in a Miami jail,
covering for her sleazy gangster boyfriend, Kevin (Jeremy Northam). Upon
being paroled, what is the first thing she does?  Breaks parole by
hopping a jet back to New York.  She seeks out Kevin, hoping  to find a
changed (and grateful) man.</P>
<P>Kevin, of course, could care less about his trashy girlfriend.  He's a
mid-level gangster in the Irish mob, and he has other things on his
mind. Most notably, an accountant in his employ has made a copy of all
the bribes and payoffs.  Kevin's lackey Sean (Mike Starr) goes
overboard, and kills the accountant, and his entire family...all except
the young Nicky (Jean-Luke Figueroa), who, as luck would have it, has
the disk with the incriminating data.</P>
<P>Wouldn't you know that Gloria and Nicky would get together.  The
tough-talking Gloria's long-dormant maternal instincts kick into high
gear as she does her best to protect the little kid from the wrath of
the mob.  But is this a challenge that even Gloria can't face?</P>
<P>This movie belongs to Sharon Stone.  Her plucky, streetwise Gloria is
the best thing about the film.  She tackles the role with plenty of
brass and personality.  Though her character begins to get a bit grating
as the film winds to a close, she's still head and shoulders above the
rest of the cast.</P>
<P>However, though Sharon does her part, the rest of the movie doesn't keep
pace. The bad guys are as generic as the "find the floppy disk" plot.
The film's few action scenes are sluggish and dull.  Even the developing
mother-son bond between the spunky kid and the spunkier Gloria is rather
trite and contrived.</P>
<P>A few good actors in some small roles here and there don't make a
lasting impression.  George C. Scott stumbles as mob boss Ruby.  Bonnie
Bedelia is downright irritating as Gloria's better-off sister, Brenda.
Only Cathy Moriarty is able to add some zest to the proceedings, as the
woman Gloria might have become.</P>
<P>Gloria is not quite good enough to recommend purely on the basis of
Sharon Stone's performance.  But that performance is good enough to
avoid an all-out pan.</P>
