<PRE>Election (1999)  * * * 1/2 (out of ****)
Brief Comments By Zachary McGhee</PRE>
<P>Paramount, MTV Films, Rated R (some sexuality and related dialogue, some
graphic language), 105 Minutes. Reese Witherspoon, Matthew Broderick, Chris
Klein. Screenplay by Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor. Directed by Alexander
Payne.</P>
<P>(Note: There are spoilers regarding the film's climax; the election, of course)</P>
<P>We see Matthew Broderick, a man torn to a primal state; he's been unfaithful
to his wife, lied to and manipulated his students,  and by the same token
they've demeaned his masculinity, his self-respect, his desperate attempt at
changing the world. And yet, he equates the cause of his pain, his torment,
with Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon). No matter how many students have come and
gone, and disappointed him as an educator, she's the real threat. About to
give in, and divulge that she's won by only a lone vote, Broderick's
McCalister turns in defeat, sees Tracy's euphoric celebration in the outside
corridor and says, 'No'. The fact that he simultaneously lusts after her
ideologically further illustrates that Freudian foundation of entitlement which
all men, no matter how obscure, have in their relationships; a traditional
expectation of success, to usurp and surpass women as a proverbial industry.
She can't go higher than him. He won't allow it.</P>
<P>And what's amazing about "Election" is that every word of that criticism is
drawn from a rather opaque metaphor. Early in the film we learn that Tracy was
romantically, and then sexually, involved with a now departed teacher. It's
like Payne and Taylor, his co-screenwriter, have taken Tracy, a girl desperate
for friendship, loyalty, and almost perversely drawn the mythological pattern
of kids who were so utterly rejected by their peers, that they found sitting at
the teachers' lunch table more fitting, to an unlikely extreme with her as
the protagonist. And it's amazing the compassion that we have; it seems so
real to us, and not merely because it's happened before, splashed all over
the front pages, but, because of the all around "nice" persona of these people,
we easily dismiss the truly wayward deeds of the characters. It's with Mandy
Barnett's "If You'll be The Teacher" playing winsomely over the closing
credits that Payne skewers the tenets of his detractors most; a final, viscous
injection of bittersweet irony.</P>
<P>Sexuality, though, is not the only basis for Payne's satire, or its success.
It also makes a telling point about politics, friendship, and class boundaries.</P>
<P>Satire is required (or ought to be, anyway) to take itself seriously, or act
so, while the audience does not. It's a fine line to straddle, but some films
ignore it altogether ("Drop Dead Gorgeous" leaps infuriatingly to mind). Payne
and Taylor hit the right chord; their characters are real people: neither is
perfect, but rather both of the leads are flawed, misguided individuals who
retain, somewhat, noble intentions at heart. We sympathize with them, but
still, as a satire, their idiosyncratic behavior, and their wrongdoing, is
taken to an extreme for the audience to knowingly chuckle, but also reflect and
meditate, about.</P>
<P>Minus half a point, though, for Payne admitting not to having seen "Ferris
Bueller's Day Off". Whatever.</P>
