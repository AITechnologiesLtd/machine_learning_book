<PRE>                                CLIFFHANGER
                  A film review by David N. Butterworth
      Copyright 1993 David N. Butterworth/The Summer Pennsylvanian</PRE>
<P>     CLIFFHANGER is everything you'd expect from a summer blockbuster
starring Sylvester Stallone--big, predictable, and dumb as houses.</P>
<P>     As action pictures go, CLIFFHANGER has its fair share of
white-knuckled, sweat-inducing sequences, and those sequences aren't
bad.  But when Sly isn't falling off a cliff, or perched high atop a
precipice, or flexing his muscles in general ... well, the movie's just
plain dull.  Perhaps Stallone's stunt double would have been better
employed in the acting department!</P>
<P>     The plot, for want of a better word, is your standard
Hero-Who-Has-to-Prove-Himself story.  Park ranger and expert
mountaineer Gabe Walker (Stallone) goes into seclusion after being
involved in a fatal, botched rescue attempt, but is lured out of
"retirement" when a government plane carrying $100 million in cold
currency goes down in the Colorado Rockies.</P>
<P>     Unbeknownst to our fearless rescue ranger, it wasn't the storm
that brought the plane down.  It's been skyjacked by a ruthless gang of
politically incorrect anarchists, led by international crackpot Qualen
(John Lithgow, in danger of playing one psycho too many).  Lithgow does
seem to be having some fun with this role; his Qualen is a malevolent,
single-entendre quipping maniac, with a stock generic European accent.
It's a shame the writers give him some of the flattest one-liners
since, well, Stallone's last movie (the addle-brained STOP! OR MY MOM
WILL SHOOT).</P>
<P>     Qualen's bunch of assorted heavies get more than they bargained
for when they force Walker to "fetch" the scattered suitcases of
booty.  Aided and abetted by ex-partner Hal Tucker (the familiar-faced
William Rooker), Walker goes mano-a-mano with the bickering thugs, a
sort of man-against- the-mountain in reverse.  Tucker's still smarting
over a hand-holding incident between his ex-girlfriend and Walker, so
there's interpersonal tension and then some!</P>
<P>     Walker's ex-girlfriend--there are a lot of ex's in this
movie--Jessie Deighan is played by TV's Janine Turner (NORTHERN
EXPOSURE).  Her emotional range in this film is severely untested; she
huffs and puffs up the mountainside, screeches in a cave full of
vampire bats (in one of CLIFFHANGER'S several allusions to the INDIANA
JONES movies), and whines in a ho-hum "Don't hog all the guilt for
yourself, spread it around some" head-to-head with Stallone that
detracts from all that pretty scenery.</P>
<P>     Bringing up the rear is the craggy-faced Ralph Waite (resurrected
from TV's THE WALTONS) who plays Frank, a forest ranger with a wacky
artistic bent.  Further comic relief is provided by a couple of
surfer-dude base jumpers, whose luck you just know will run out.</P>
<P>     Trevor Jones' overblown score is virtually identical to his
collaboration on last year's THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS, give or take a
chord.  It's fine when the visuals comprise grand, sweeping shots of
the majestic Italian Dolomites (doubling for the Rocky Mountains), but
its oft-repeated theme grows tiresome during some of the film's less
cinematic scenes.</P>
<P>     Director Renny Harlin (DIE HARD 2) is in familiar terrain here,
but Stallone's larger-than-life Gabe Walker is no John McClane (Bruce
Willis moves his mouth when he speaks, for starters).  As expected, the
punch- drunk Stallone gets the crap kicked out of him, but barely lets
out a grunt (saving those for the film's more dialogue-bound moments
instead). After all, anyone who can survive being smashed into a cliff
face by the weight of a disabled helicopter and still work in a
one-liner can't be bothered by a little internal bleeding.</P>
<P>     All this adds up to a very tired formula that cries out for a
boost of adrenaline, but co-writer Stallone can contribute only
testosterone.  Will the two rangers battle the bad guys and make up by
the film's conclusion?  Will Jessie be suitably impressed by Gabe's
rock climbing skills?  Will Gabe ever find it in his heart to forgive
himself?  Will the audience wish they'd paid matinee prices instead?</P>
<P>     This movie isn't even worth trashing.  It's Sly Stallone up a
mountain with bad guys.  But then what else did you expect?  For all
its spectacular aerial footage and gravity-defying stunt work,
CLIFFHANGER is a snowjob of a movie that amounts to nothing more than
thin peaks.</P>
