<PRE>                                  HIGHWAY 61
                       A film review by Joseph Brenner
                        Copyright 1992 Joseph Brenner</PRE>
<P>     HIGHWAY 61 is an attempt at being charming in a cult film sort of
way that never really comes off.  The story is very similar to, say,
SOMETHING WILD, and easily a dozen other films: a geeky but nice guy
meets a wild woman hot babe who gets him involved with some weird
happenings, and eventually they fall in love.  I'd rate it around -1 on
the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
<P>     In this case, our hero the geek is a barber in Canada who has
pretensions of being a trumpet player (he's awful).  He discovers a body
lying in his back yard.  Our hero the wild woman (well, really the woman
in this kind of story is more of an archetypal image than a hero), is a
heavy metal roadie who decides to claim the body, so she can use it to
smuggle some stolen cocaine into the US.  She manages to con our hero
into giving her a lift, so they strap the coffin on top of his Ford
Galaxie, and off they go down Route 61.  </P>
<P>     First demerit: none of this makes any sense.  More importantly, the
nonsense isn't particularly engaging in any way, it's just there.</P>
<P>     The third character is the most interesting one, a guy who thinks
he's Satan, who goes around talking people into selling him their souls.
The joke is that they almost always do it for something really trivial,
because they don't take him seriously.  As you might expect, there's
some ambiguity about whether or not he's really Satan, but mostly he
just seems to be a nut.  He wants the body our heroes are schlepping
around.</P>
<P>     There are also some dissolute ex-rock stars that are friends of the
wild woman, who engage in some degenerate activity that might be mildly
amusing.  </P>
<P>     The "surprising" conclusion to this movie makes even less sense
than the beginning, and it's even more unsatisfying.  It's supposed to
be ironic and show some sort of change of character on the part of the
female character, but it comes out of nowhere, and it doesn't really
mean anything.</P>
<P>     So, there's an occasional funny line in this movie, and some minor
sound and fury near the end that might draw you in, but it all seems too
silly to matter, and it just doesn't go anywhere.</P>
<P>     Incidentally, there is a little Bob Dylan on the sound track, but
it's not the title cut, and it's probably just as well.</P>
