<PRE>.                              THE CELEBRATION
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1998 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Does anything come out of Denmark that's not disturbing?</P>
<P>     A grand experiment that is a smashing success, THE CELEBRATION
adheres to the principles of "Dogme 95," a collective of filmmakers who
swear to adhere to certain rules in filmmaking: no studio shooting,
location sound only, no music, hand-held camera only, natural light
only, etc.  The full manifesto has ten rules, *none* of which are
commonly adhered to in Hollywood.  It's a real surprise to see how
magnificent these rules can be when put into the context of a good
script and good acting.</P>
<P>     But enough about the method.  The story is one of a family
unraveling during the celebration of the father's 60th birthday.  As it
turns out, dear old dad's done some pretty unspeakable things, and today
is payback.</P>
<P>     I won't spoil the rest for you, but THE CELEBRATION remains the
best (okay, the only) foreign film I've seen this year.  If you're a fan
of cinema that keeps you up late and doesn't have a bunch of teen
screamers... this one's for you.</P>
