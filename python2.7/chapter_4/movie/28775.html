<PRE>THE DEBUT
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>In first-time writer/director/producer Gene Cajayon's coming-of-age 
drama, THE DEBUT, Ben Mercado (Dante Basco) is torn between two worlds.  
His Filipino-American home couldn't be more ethnic, but he spends his 
time hanging out with his white buddies from school.  He doesn't bring 
his friends home, and, when once forced to, he tries to hide his family 
and the heavy smell of Filipino food coming from the kitchen.</P>
<P>Ben's domineering, postman father wants Ben to be the success that he 
isn't.  And with the offer of a scholarship to UCLA, Ben appears to be 
following in the medical school tradition of some other members of the 
Mercado family.  Ben, however, has a radically different dream.  He has 
sold his prize possession, a collection of classic comic books, in order 
to pay the tuition to Cal Arts, where he has been accepted to study 
comic book artistry.  "Stop it with those stupid pictures of yours!" his 
father keeps barking at him with palpable anger.</P>
<P>A heartfelt, crowd-pleaser of a story, THE DEBUT suffers from acting 
that can be amateurish at times and a plot that could be called clichéd 
were the film not so honest in its presentation.  But it is a movie that 
is able to rise above its limitations.  It is also one that is careful 
to show that racist attitudes occur in all cultures.  The story takes 
place over one night at two parties, one white and one brown, as several 
of the Filipino-American characters refer to their race.  Interestingly, 
the movie's one bad guy, a Filipino-American named Augusto (Darion 
Basco), spends all of his time trying to talk like the leader of a black 
street gang.</P>
<P>The white party, which we join only briefly, is a typical collection of 
older teens who are trying to drink themselves silly.  Ben and his two 
white buddies turn out to be more comfortable at the Filipino-American 
party, which is a substitute debutante ball for Ben's sister, Rose 
(Bernadette Balagtas).  Ben's disapproving grandfather is ashamed of the 
way his son can afford only a mere birthday party for Rose's coming out.  
Just as we sympathize with Ben's plight, we also empathize with his 
father's since we can see how he is the product of his upbringing.   </P>
<P>Of course, there will be a beautiful girl at the party, Annabelle (Joy 
Bisco), who will be dating the tough guy, Augusto.  And, of course, 
there will be the requisite fight.  That it is all predictable doesn't 
negate its impact.  I found myself applauding at one point as one guy 
finally got what was coming to him.</P>
<P>Filmed handsomely by Hisham Abed, THE DEBUT isn't one of those indie 
pictures shot on grainy video that attempts to equate gritty ugliness 
with realism.  </P>
<P>The movie knows when to back off and include some self-deprecating 
humor.  The best of the film's humor comes from the party's 
Filipino-American militant.  As the guys drool over some hot cams, he 
explains about the "car conspiracy."  It turns out that white folks have 
invented hot cars as a way to distract Filipino-Americans from their 
lack of opportunities.  He claims that they've never had a brown driver 
at the Indianapolis 500 and never will because it's all part of this 
vast conspiracy.  Ben's two white friends are astounded by this 
revelation.  "That's deep!" one of them remarks quite seriously.  They 
couldn't have been more impressed if someone had figured out who the 
other members of Lee Harvey Oswald's team were.</P>
<P>THE DEBUT runs 1:34.  It isn't rated but might be PG-13 for language and 
one fistfight.  The film would be acceptable for kids around 11 or 12 
and up.  </P>
