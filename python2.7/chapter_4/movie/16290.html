<PRE>VARSITY BLUES by DeWyNGaLe    Rating: B</PRE>
<P>Varsity Blues is just another high school sports movie.  Most of them aren't
very good, but Varsity Blues is different.  The key in Varsity Blues was
casting.  James Van Der Beek and Jon Voight lead the cast of Varsity Blues. 
The two play enemies- James Van Der Beek plays Jonathan Moxon, second string
football player, and Jon Voight plays the extremely mean football coach at
Canaan High School, Bud Kilmer.  Bud has coached football there for a number of
years.  He has mis treated many his players every year.  He doesn't care about
them at all, he just wants the championship.  He makes them play in sickness,
pain, or sadness.  He always takes his team to the championship, and he expects
to do it again this year.</P>
<P>He relies on star quarterback Lance Harbor, played by Paul Walker. Lance is the
typical movie sports star.  He is the best on the team, and he is always the
hero during the games.  The talent isn't all natural for Lance though,
considering that he takes steroids.  Jonathan, or Mox, (his nickname) discovers
that the coach is doing this.  This is your typical sports movie- the star of
the team is pet to the coach and the man who is better than the star is
absolutely hated by the coach.  Although it is unoriginal, Varsity Blues is
still a winner.  There are a lot of funny sequences, and there are well played
out dramatic sequences as well.  When Lance is sustains an injury that may put
him out of football for life, Mox is the teams only hope.  Coach Kilmer is
reluctant to play Mox, but has no choice.  Mox goes out there and shows coach
how it is done.  The football sequences that were filmed were done very nicely.
 They looked very realistic, and were put together very well.  It looked like
the cast was actually playing the game, and it wasn't coordinated.</P>
<P>Mox continues to win game after game for the Coyotes.  He likes being a star
now, but is very upset with the way Coach Kilmer treats the team.  His dad
(Thomas Duffy) is very proud of him.  He was a star in high school football as
well, and wants his two sons to do the same.  When Mox gets an academic
scholarship to Brown University, his dad is very upset.  He wants Mox to play
football all of his life.  Mox doesn't want to take after his dad, he wants to
live his own life.  James Van Der Beek gives an impressive acting performance
in these arguments with his father.  He made you believe the tough position
that Mox was in at that moment.</P>
<P>Mox's girlfriend, Julie, played by Amy Smart, isn't in to the whole football
craze.  She doesn't care about who wins or who loses or anything like that. 
Since Mox has become a football star, she has noticed a huge change in him.  He
is thinking more about himself than anyone else.  Amy Smart has not done many
movies, but in her role in Varsity Blues, she does a great job of dramatic
acting.  While all this drama is going on, Mox continues to win many games for
the Coyotes.  Coach Kilmer is very proud when Mox takes the team all the way to
the championship game.  During the game, Mox is very reluctant to play.  He
doesn't want to play for his dad and Kilmer.  He is sick of being controlled by
others.  The entire team agrees with what Mox is saying to them about Kilmer.</P>
<P>Varsity Blues is a teenager movie.  Most adults will probably dislike this
movie.  Laughs mixed with sad moments in Varsity Blues make it score big with
the teen audience.  Jon Voight gives a wonderful performance as Coach Kilmer. 
He did a great job of seeming evil, not caring about anyone but himself.  James
Van Der Beek tells us with Varsity Blues that he can handle the lead in a movie
as well as the lead on a hit television show.  Some of Varsity Blues wasn't all
that great, and that's the reason that adults won't like it.  It may not be the
type of movie that will win awards or anything close to it, but it was
certainly enjoyable, and that's enough for me.</P>
<P>The Bottom Line- The typical sports movie with some changes makes for a fun
time.</P>
