<P>     ANGELA, director Rebecca Miller's award-winning debut feature (it 
captured two prizes at last year's Sundance Film Festival), presents a 
view of the modern world through the eyes of a creative ten-year old 
girl.  With a relaxed pace and lyrical visual style, this motion 
picture, which explores issues of spirituality and guilt, will never 
find an audience among mainstream movie-goers.  Nevertheless, for those 
who appreciate perceptive, offbeat, experimental features, ANGELA offers 
a rewarding one-hundred minutes.</P>
<P>     The two main characters, Angela (Miranda Stuart Ryne) and her six-
year old sister, Ellie (Charlotte Blythe), have just moved into a new 
upstate New York home.  Their mother, Mae (Anna Thompson), a manic-
depressive ex-singer, has an erratic relationship with her two daughters 
and her husband, Andrew (John Ventimiglia).  Sometimes, she's sweet and 
joyful; on other occasions, she's violent and self-destructive.  Angela 
doesn't understand her mother, but she's sure that her own sin and 
spiritual inadequacies are somehow responsible for Mae's problems, so, 
with Ellie in tow, she runs away from home, following obscure "signs 
from God" in a quest to purify herself, and, as a result, save her 
mother.</P>
<P>     Angela readily plugs the holes in her understanding of the Catholic 
catechism by coming up with mystical constructions of her own.  In her 
metaphysical vision, the world is a place of angels -- both good and bad 
-- and the difference between going to heaven or hell depends on whether 
you can differentiate between the two.  Mistakes are easy to make -- 
Angela erroneously believes a pedophile to be an agent of God because he 
gives her the money to win a stuffed animal at a carnival.  She sees 
reality through naive eyes, and Miller (who wrote the screenplay in 
addition to handling the directorial chores) does a superlative job of 
presenting this story from the child's viewpoint while still making it 
clear what the more objective, "adult" perspective of events is.</P>
<P>     Miranda Stuart Ryne, a young actress of astounding ability, was 
chosen for the title role from a field of more than 1000 hopefuls.  
Viewing her nearly-flawless performance, it's easy to understand why 
Miller cast her.  For someone of her age, she has amazing screen 
presence, and makes acting appear effortless.  The impish Charlotte 
Blythe, although not as effective as her older co-star, is entirely 
believable.</P>
<P>     When we're children, we attribute more power to ourselves than we 
actually have.  That's the quality of youth that ANGELA most perfectly 
captures.  Not since last year's obscure Polish feature, CROWS, has 
there been a more apt exploration of how children relate to their 
setting.  Angela's refuge is the imaginative spirituality that she 
shares only with her sister.  The film builds slowly, but inevitably, 
towards a conclusion that is at once powerful, shocking, and moving.  In 
some ways, ANGELA can be seen as a cautionary tale about the dangers of 
taking a particular dogma to an extreme, but, mostly, the movie reminds 
us of the complexity of life from the child's point-of-view, something 
it's easy to forget once we cross the invisible boundary of adulthood. </P>
