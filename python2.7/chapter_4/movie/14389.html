<PRE>BABETTE'S FEAST (1987)</PRE>
<P>"This head chef had the ability to transform a dinner into a kind of 
love affair."</P>
<PRE>3.5 out of ****</PRE>
<P>Starring Stéphane Audran, Bodil Kjer, Brigitte Federspiel, Jarl Kulle
Written & Directed by Gabriel Axel, from a story by Isak Dinesen
Cinematography by Henning Kristiansen</P>
<P>It is hard to imagine, in the last years of the 20th century, why 
anyone would choose the chaste, ascetic lifestyle that deeply 
religious people lived in the past (and that some still live today).  
The pleasures of the flesh are so immediate, so tangible: why forsake 
them?  BABETTE'S FEAST, a wise, gentle Danish film, poses this 
question, but rather than the usual contrast of pious self-denial with 
the intense rewards of sex, it approaches the issue from a different 
angle, by looking at that other great carnal pleasure: eating.</P>
<P>Based on a novella by the great Isak Dinesen (probably best known for 
her memoir, OUT OF AFRICA), the tale is set in a village on the wild, 
rugged coast of Jutland.  It is the 19th century, but it could easily 
be the 17th.  The people are kind but puritanical; they live in 
simple, modest cottages; their favourite recreation is singing 
devotional songs.  There are few young people in the community, and 
it's not hard to imagine why.</P>
<P>The first half of the film mostly fills in details of the past.  We 
meet Philippa and Martina (Bodil Kjer, Brigitte Federspiel), the 
sweet, virginal daughters of a respected minister.  Each sister is 
wooed by an outsider, but they reject their respective suitors, opting 
instead for lives of duty and charity, following in their father's 
footsteps.</P>
<P>As is often the case in Dinesen's stories, these brief, youthful 
passions have long-lasting consequences.  Martina's suitor is an 
emotional French singer, and years later, still remembering the 
sisters' generosity and humanity, he refers a woman to them, a refugee 
from civil war in Paris.  The sisters agree to let her live with them 
as a maid.  The woman is Babette (Stéphane Audran).  And years after 
this, Philippa's suitor, Lorenz (Jarl Kulle), who had departed when he 
realized he could not have her, happens to be visiting, on the 
occasion of their late father's 100th anniversary.  For this special 
occasion, Babette asks that she be allowed to create a special dinner.  
Reluctantly (they don't want to indulge themselves), the sisters agree 
to let Babette treat them and their guests to the full range of her 
culinary talents.</P>
<P>The movie's first half is awkward; it betrays its literary 
provenance.  We are shuttled back and forth in time, jarringly.  
Frequent voice-overs try to smooth over the awkward transitions, but 
the end result is intrusive.  The film explains everything that is 
happening--the emotions and events are kept at a distance.  But if it 
seems hurried and detached, it is perhaps because the filmmakers were 
anxious to get to Babette's feast, and who could blame them?</P>
<P>What a dinner it is.  It is the centerpiece the movie, and it is 
wonderful.  The guests arrive; are seated; they chat; fine wine is 
poured; and, one by one, exquisite French dishes are set before them.  
The camera lingers lovingly on every aspect of the meal: the 
preparation, the serving, the consumption.  With musical precision, 
the film cuts back and forth from kitchen to dining room.  Babette 
devotes herself to the feast, while the guests enjoy the results of 
her devotion, all the while making small talk, or religious 
observations, or toasts, or quiet sounds of satisfaction.  Without 
fuss or bother, we are shown just how much pleasure can be had from a 
single meal, after a lifetime of soup and ale-bread.</P>
<P>There is very little use of incidental music; instead, ambient noises 
are emphasized, and this is particularly effective during the feast.  
The sounds of the kitchen and the dining room become a sort of ersatz 
orchestration, the perfect accompaniment to the conviviality and 
epicurean delight of the dinner.  The fizz of champagne filling a 
glass, the bubbling of sauce in a pot on the stove, the soft clink of 
knife and fork as a piece of fruit is sliced open--these become a 
symphony, and Gabriel Axel the conductor.  He makes the dinner 
sequence sensuous, intimate, vivid, but never calls attention to his 
methods: this is filmmaking so fine, so subtle, you are hardly aware 
of it.</P>
<P>Because they fear they are indulging their appetites unbecomingly, 
the dinner guests make a pact: they will say not a word about the food 
or drink.  They will not admit that they have enjoyed it.  Lorenz 
alone is not part of this pact, and his vocal enjoyment of the meal is 
humourously contrasted to the other guests' refusal to express their 
delight.  But they certainly are delighted, and, in, the end, it is 
fortunate that they promised to say nothing--no words would have been 
adequate to express their dawning realization that in the 
gratification of our earthly senses there is, perhaps, something holy.</P>
