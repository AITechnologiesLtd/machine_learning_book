<PRE>ANGEL EYES</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Luis Mandoki</PRE>
<PRE>With Jennifer Lopez, James Caviezel</PRE>
<PRE>UA South     R     103 min.</PRE>
<P>     It may be a sign of a beginning thaw, or perhaps just of audience 
desperation, but this year's bad movies are beginning to seem a little 
less bad.  Angel Eyes, the Jennifer Lopez action-romance with a 
supernatural tease, is bearable and sometimes even engaging.  It should 
never be confused with a good movie, but it will do to pass the time.</P>
<P>     It comes from director Luis Mandoki, whose When a Man Loves a Woman 
and Message in a Bottle  will give you some idea of what to expect - 
soapy sentiment yoked to professional competence.  This idea was 
probably born following a screening of The Sixth Sense, or rather after 
the box office returns began to show the sleeper potential of that 
movie's supernatural appeal. </P>
<P>     Angel Eyes picks up where the Shyamalan movie left off.  There, we 
weren't supposed to even think about the fact that Bruce Willis might be 
dead until the surprise ending.  Here, we're supposed to think about 
little else.  Is he dead or isn't he?  Catch (James Caviezel) strides 
the seedy neighborhoods of Chicago in his long flapping overcoat 
(wings?) doing good deeds which go largely unappreciated.  But we've 
seen him before - in the movie's prologue, when Officer Sharon Pogue 
(Jennifer Lopez) tries to save his life at the scene of a terrible auto 
accident.  Does she or doesn't she?  Only the filmmakers know for sure..</P>
<P>     When they meet again, neither of them seem to recall the incident.  
He feels a bond with her, but doesn't appear to know why.  His face 
rings no bells with her.</P>
<P>     Here's what we know about Sharon: she comes from a family where the 
men sometimes beat up their wives.  She once called the cops on her 
father (Victor Argo) when he was beating up her mother (Sonia Braga), 
and he hasn't spoken to her since.  Now she's a cop herself, and as 
tough as they come.  She drinks and swaps friendly macho barbs with the 
guys.  But she has intimacy issues.</P>
<P>     Here's what we know about Catch:  damn little.  He's a bit on the 
weird, silent side, but Caviezel is too good an actor to leave himself 
completely mired in that tedious movie clichE9, and he leavens his =
performance with unexpected smiles and flashes of humor.  He has a 
kitchen drawer full of action figures, and it's hard to miss the 
correlation with Sharon, a feisty little action figure herself if there 
ever was one.  He leaves doors open.  And he has intimacy issues.      </P>
<P>     To a large extent your enjoyment level will depend on how well you 
connect with its two stars, and how well you feel they connect to each 
other.  There are bits of cinematic carelessness: Sharon takes a bullet 
smack in the bulletproof vest, which leaves a deep and angry bruise 
above her breast; but the next time she exposes that area of flesh, and 
it doesn't take long, it's creamy enough to reveal at the Oscars.  There 
are also bits of pure pleasure: Catch picks up a trumpet on the 
bandstand at a blues club and plays a nicely haunting rendition of 
"Nature Boy".  And of course there are many bits of nonsense: long 
silences as people stare uncomfortably at each other, a disease that 
seems to be caused by cameras and lights.</P>
<P>     This isn't a gotta-see-it movie, it's more of a 
what's-at-the-movies movie.  As the old blues line has it, it can be 
your little dog till your big dog comes.</P>
