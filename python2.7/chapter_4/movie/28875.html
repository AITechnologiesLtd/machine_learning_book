<P>It's probably no coincidence that Driven is only one letter away from being
Drivel.  The film, made by long-time critical whipping boys Renny Harlin
(director) and Sylvester Stallone (star/screenwriter), features a 20-race
Formula One season that pits the defending champion (an unlikeable German)
against the rookie (a dreamy Calvin Klein model).  When it's showing a race,
Driven is merely adequate; when it's not, it's downright awful.</P>
<P>Admittedly, I know nothing about racing, other than the fact it's as
exciting as watching paint dry, and I furrow my brow at the fans who insist
it's a sport.  "You've got to be in great shape to race a car," they say.
Right.  I've seen plenty of fat people drive fast.  As far as I can tell
(and Driven didn't change my opinion at all), you need only a big bladder
and the ability to sit still for a really long time.  The only thing those
hillbillies in the stands (and the theatre audience, for that matter) want
to see is a crash, and then they're horrified when somebody zooms off to
that Big Oval in the Sky.  Here are a few things I did learn from the film:</P>
<P>- When there's an accident on the track, the Kyrgyzstan flag is triumphantly
waved to cheer up the spectators.</P>
<P>- Drivers pass their girls around like joints. (Have you seen Jeff Gordon's
wife?  Where do I sign up for this racing thing?)</P>
<P>- If you hum, you'll drive faster (try it at home, kids!).</P>
<P>- The cars are really controlled by laptop computers manned by nerdy men who
are neatly tucked away so nobody sees them.</P>
<P>Driven focuses on an F1 racing team managed by the wheelchair-bound Carl
Henry (Burt Reynolds, The Crew).  He has two drivers in his stable - Memo
Moreno (Cristián de la Fuente, Family Law) and rookie Jimmy Blye (Kip
Pardue, Remember the Titans).  When Blye begins to challenge the defending
F1 champion, Beau Brandenburg (Til Schweiger), he jettisons Memo and makes a
call to a washed-up ex-racer named Joe Tanto (Stallone, Get Carter) to help
steer his promising rookie in the right direction.</P>
<P>Thrown into the mix are three women who do incredibly little to add anything
to the weak story.  Gina Gershon (The Insider) is married to Memo but is
also Tanto's ex-wife.
Synchronized-swimmer-turned-Sports-Illustrated-swimsuit-model Estella Warren
(who is dating Pardue in real life) plays Brandenburg's squeeze, but she
leaves him for Blye.  In the Company of Men's Stacy Edwards clocks in a
throwaway role as a reporter assigned to cover the F1 season and all of the
chest-thumping attendant thereto - you know, kind of the Jane Goodall of
car-driving chimps.  Since you can practically see testosterone dripping off
the screen here, it's a big surprise that there isn't one sex scene.  Nobody
even kisses, which is just plain weird, especially since you know Stallone's
character will nail Edwards' five seconds before they even meet (it just HAS
to be on the cutting-room floor, abandoned for the PG-13 rating).</P>
<P>Isn't it about time we go ahead and subtitle Stallone?  I've heard more
intelligible things spewing out of the homeless guy at the bus stop who's
always going on about flying hams.  Sly's psychic mother makes more sense at
this point.  His script - the first he's penned on his own since the
celebrated Rocky V - goes out of its way to show that each character is
damaged in some way or another, but not in a way to make viewers care.
Driven includes several laughably bad motivational speeches and the lamest
foreshadowing in years.  Oh my God - I can't believe it's going to come down
to the last race of the season!</P>
<P>Harlin (Deep Blue Sea) does well with the racing scenes (especially the
crashes), but everything else is a poorly paced mess.  The music (from BT)
is annoying and the non-stop product placement is way too convenient to
ignore.  Driven can't even find anything to do with the beautiful but
clearly untalented Warren ("Well, what CAN you do, sweetie?"  "I used to be
a synchronized swimmer."  "Bingo, then that's what you'll do.").  When Gina
Gershon lends an air of credibility to your film, you're in big, big
trouble.</P>
<P>1:45 - PG-13 for language and some intense crash sequences</P>
