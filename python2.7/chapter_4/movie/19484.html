<PRE>Big Daddy ***</PRE>
<P>rated PG-13
Columbia Pictures
93 minutes
starring Adam Sandler, Joey Lauren Adams, Jon Stewart, Cole and Dylan
Sprouse, Josh Mostel, Leslie Mann, Allen Covert, Rob Schneider, Kristy
Swanson, Steve Buscemi
based on the story by Steve Franks
written by Steve Franks, Tim Herlihy and Adam Sandler
directed by Dennis Dugan</P>
<P>Adam Sandler makes more money than any other 32-year-old comic on the
planet, but he also takes more slack from the critics than basically
anyone else. To him, and to his fans, it should be a breath of fresh
air when I admit that I enjoyed his latest film, "Big Daddy".</P>
<P>The boyish Sandler stars as Sonny Koufax, a New York City law school
graduate who's a toll booth collector while preparing to eventually
take the bar exam. His life, however, is taking a turn for the worse,
as his girfriend(Kristy Swanson) dumps him for an older man. One day,
while his roommate(Jon Stewart) is in China on business, a
child(played by twins Cole and Dylan Sprouse) comes to the door with a
note saying that he is Julian, the product of a one-night-stand that
Sonny's roommate had 5 years before.</P>
<P>Seeking a sense of responsibility that he knows he has lost, and
partly to impress his girlfriend, he decides to become the father of
the child, named Julian. He decides to give him the life that his
father never gave him; a life where the father will not give orders;
he will merely make suggestions. This way of parenting makes the two
of them very good friends. They piss on walls; they trip oncoming
skaters, and they do what basically any Adam Sandler-raised child
thinks is cool.</P>
<P>Julian also helps Sonny get a girl named Layla, played by Joey Lauren
Adams of "Chasing Amy" fame. She turns out to be the sister of his
roommate's girlfriend(Leslie Mann), but she is charmed by his wit and
his newfound sense of "responsibility".</P>
<P>The usual eclectic clan of Sandler characters is back. Rob Schneider
plays a foreign delivery boy who comes to Sonny's apartment to Indian
wrestle him; Steve Buscemi plays a homeless man who desires a Sausage
McMuffin; and Allen Covert plays Sonny's gay friend(a sign of Sandler
becoming more PC). Sandler's early films, "Billy Madison" and "Happy
Gilmore", were unashamedly dumb, but also incredibly funny. His two
latest, and more popular, films, "The Wedding Singer" and "The
Waterboy" are my two least favorite of his. "The Wedding Singer"
misfired by trying to portray Sandler as a romantic lead. "The
Waterboy" went back to his dumb roots but turned out to be quite
unfunny. "Big Daddy", however, is a step in the right direction.</P>
<P>"Big Daddy" has taken "Happy Gilmore" director Dennis Dugan and
successfully combined Sandler's comedic and dramatic ability. "Big
Daddy" has its share of predicability and throwaway lines(not to
mention the cheesiness factor), but it's consistently funny and
entertaining, warmhearting and accessible.</P>
<P>Accessibility really is Adam Sandler's whole routine. He represents
those who may not have "talent", but he is showing them(and us) that
anyone can make it big. At heart, Sandler is still a teenager obsessed
with fart jokes. As for those who have talent and still don't make it
big...</P>
