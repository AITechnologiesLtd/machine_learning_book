<PRE>INNOCENCE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>INNOCENCE is a rarely told tale of seniors in love that is written and directed
with a graceful delicateness by Paul Cox.  Starring three veteran Australian
actors, Julia Blake (MY BRILLIANT CAREER), Charles 'Bud' Tingwell (THE DISH) and
Terry Norris, the film is superbly and touchingly acted.  Although they may be
in their waning years, the movie's seventyish characters demonstrate a palpable
zest for the essence of life and love.  The sometimes surprising story is
wonderfully moving without being overly sentimental and completely honest while
avoiding cheap theatrics.  </P>
<P>The film opens about fifty years in the past as innocent and carefree young
lovers Claire and Andreas are bicycling down an Australian country road. 
Utterly in love, they stop to kiss and caress.  Kristien Van Pellicom, who looks
like a young Rachel Griffiths, plays this younger Claire and Kenny Aernouts
plays the younger Andreas.  Shot with an oversatured look, these flashback
images are a cross between someone's memories and an old home movie.  In a film
that has so much is right about it that it's hard to list everything, it should
be pointed out that the casting of these two is quite perfect.  They look
remarkably like younger versions of the actors who play their characters fifty
years later.</P>
<P>We quickly cut to the present when most of the story is set.  Although they
haven't seen each other in almost half a century, Claire (Blake) accepts
Andreas's (Tingwell) offer to come and visit him.  Andreas's wife died thirty
years ago, but Claire has been married to John (Norris) for 45 years now. 
(Actually, 44 years, 3 months and a few odd days as Claire will remind John
later in one of her few fits of anger.)  Besides spouses, Claire and Andreas
have children and grandchildren.  Nevertheless, their love for each other has
remained constant even if dormant all of these years.</P>
<P>Once they see each other again, their lives are forever changed.  Like sleeper
spies, they are roused to action and begin an affair.  You may well wonder what
an affair among seniors is like.  Certainly, the cinema gives us little guidance
as to what we should expect.  Affairs in movies rarely occur with anyone older
than middle age.</P>
<P>In a film that takes several unpredictable turns, one of the most unusual ones
occurs when the ever honest Claire confesses to her husband what is going on. 
His initial reaction isn't what you'd expect.  Since the story focuses on the
love that Claire and Andreas have for each other, it would be easy to have John
be either unimportant or some kind of cliché.  Instead, Terry Norris infuses his
character with a mixture of hopelessness, confusion and resoluteness.  In his
best scene, John tries without success to explain his feelings to Claire.  "I'm
old," he tells her with overwhelming sadness.  "I'm tired.  I suddenly realized
that my whole life…"  His thought process trails off then, and he is so lost
that he is unable to finish his sentence.</P>
<P>"You know what matters in life?" Andreas asks his daughter.  "Love.  Everything
else is rubbish."  This is a perfect sentiment for our times.</P>
<P>INNOCENCE runs 1:34.  It is not rated but would be R for sexual situations and
nudity and would be acceptable for teenagers.</P>
<P>The film opens in very limited release in the United States on October 26, 2001.
 In the Silicon Valley, it will be showing at the Camera Cinemas.</P>
