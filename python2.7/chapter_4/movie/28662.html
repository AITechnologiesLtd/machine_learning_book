<P>It becomes clear almost immediately that Bridget Jones's Diary is going to 
be a chick version of High Fidelity, complete with narration from its main 
character, not to mention the fact that both films were based on popular 
British Gen-X novels (although Fidelity's Rob Gordon never had self-esteem 
problems quite as bad as Ms. Jones).  Behind the slick veneer of the 
narration, this is a fairly conventional and entirely predictable story - 
pretty much the same story, in fact, as the recently maligned Someone Like 
You, which was also based on a popular book.  Diary probably worked much 
better as a novel, as it doesn't translate nearly as well as Fidelity. </P>
<P>Renée Zellweger (Nurse Betty) plays the titular Bridget Jones, a single, 
32-year-old, London publishing house employee who is afraid of either 
turning into Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction or being eaten by a pack of 
hungry dogs after dying a sad, lonely death in her flat.  Diary takes place 
over one year, between Christmases, and begins with her mother's (Gemma 
Jones, The Winslow Boy) annual holiday party/Bridget fix-up festival.  This 
year, Mom's potential future son-in-law is a smarmy barrister named Mark 
Darcy (Colin Firth, Shakespeare in Love).  Even though Darcy is an old 
friend of the family who has known Bridget for most of his life, sparks 
don't fly, and the two go their separate ways. </P>
<P>In the meantime (and like Zellweger's first big film), Bridget keeps lusting 
after her boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant, Small Time Crooks), and, after 
trading some suggestive e-mail, the two begin a torrid affair until, exactly 
at the halfway mark, the wheels fall off.  Despite watching her father's 
(Jim Broadbent, Topsy-Turvy) relationship with Mom crash and burn, Bridget 
has to pull herself together, and, among other things, find a new job and a 
new man before her biological clock explodes (cue Aretha Franklin's 
"Respect").  And all the while she keeps the audience updated on her weight 
and consumption of both alcohol and cigarettes, which are all things Bridget 
keeps track of in her diary. </P>
<P>This isn't as accessible as The Full Monty or Four Weddings and a Funeral 
(which shares Diary's producers Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner), but the one 
thing that Diary has that those Best Picture nominees didn't is Zellweger. 
She looks incredible and her performance is even better (leaving me to ask 
"Julia who?" just two weeks after the Oscars).  Fans of Helen Fielding's 
novel (especially the British ones) raised holy hell when the skinny Texan 
was cast as Bridget, but after gaining a well-publicized 20 pounds and 
working undercover (and completely unnoticed) as a real British office 
drone, they should all be amazed at her performance.  Zellweger nails it, 
delivering what should be one of the year's best performances.  From her 
impeccable accent (which almost puts Gwyneth's to shame) to her uncanny 
knack for physical comedy, Zellweger is so likeable and fun to watch, it 
doesn't matter what happens in the film. </P>
<P>Grant, who plays his second sleazebag in a row, is also very good, as well 
as wiry and chiseled.  Firth does well, and well he should do, as it's 
actually the second time he's played this part.  In Fielding's book, Bridget 
falls madly in love with the real-life Firth after watching him in Pride and 
Prejudice (where he played a character named Mr. Darcy), so his casting is a 
bit of an inside joke for the novel's readers. </P>
<P>Diary is the feature-film directorial debut of documentary filmmaker Sharon 
Maguire (no relation to Jerry) and was adapted from Fielding's book by 
Andrew Davies and Notting Hill's Richard Curtis.  The film probably sets a 
record for the number of times the word "fuckwit" is used (a good thing) and 
its closing credits are sweet and memorable (so stick around) </P>
<P>1:32 - R for language and some strong sexuality</P>
