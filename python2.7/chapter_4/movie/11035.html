<P>Way back in 1995, we went to the newly built 20 screen cineplex-a-rama to
take in NADJA, a black and white avant-garde vampire movie that was doing
the rounds at the time. Before going in, a nice usher asked to see our
ticket stubs, so as to make sure that we actually had a ticket to see
NADJA. We thought, "Hey, NADJA must be amazingly popular if they're
checking tickets to the midnight show!" It turns out this is not why they
were checking stubs (we hear the roving gangs aren't much a problem there
anymore) and we were totally alone in the theater. We could have heckled
the screen all we wanted, but instead we sat quietly and watched NADJA,
the boring vampire movie. It was pretty darn bad, with a slow plot and
weird camera effects that wore out their welcome about two seconds after
they started, and lots of pretentious dialogue. The only thing that made
NADJA even slightly watchable were some fairly funny lines, like when Van
Helsing (Peter Fonda) explains why he did Dracula a favor by killing him.
"He was all bloated and surrounded by zombies," he explains, "kinda like
Elvis at the end."</P>
<P>Two years older and wiser, we rented THE ADDICTION, 1995's other black and
white avant-garde vampire movie. We think Santiana said something we
should have remembered, but we're pretty sure it will be repeated if we
really need to know it.</P>
<P>KATHLEEN: The old adage from Santiana, that those who don't learn from
history are doomed to repeat it, is a lie. There is no history. Everything
we are is eternally with us. Our question is therefore, what can save us
from our crazy insistence of spreading the blight in ever widening
circles?</P>
<P>Oh, right. Thanks. In THE ADDICTION, the main character is a doctoral
student in philosophy named Kathleen who is walking down the street one
night when she is attacked by a vampire (Annabella Sciorra). Only in New
York City. OK, vampires could attack people anywhere. But only in New York
City would the cops react with the amazing indifference that we see in
this film. In any case, the doctors think that the traumatic experience
has aggravated a minor case of anemia that Kathleen didn't know she had,
and she is released.</P>
<P>Of course it isn't really anemia. Kathleen is now a vampire, a creature of
the night, nosferatu. Which means she wears sunglasses and becomes
unbearably pretentious. She goes to her classes and rants against the
concept of free will, while her friends worry about her.</P>
<P>And then comes the blood lust. At first, Kathleen gets the blood she needs
by using a hypodermic to take blood from street people and shooting up
with it. Remember, the name of the movie is THE ADDICTION. Get it?</P>
<P>Soon Kathleen moves on to living targets, sucking the blood out of mentor,
a jive-talking youth, and some random anthropology student she meets in
the school library.</P>
<P>KATHLEEN: Oh, the stench here is worse than a charnel house. This is a
graveyard. Rows of crumbling tombstones, viscous libelous epitaphs. And
we're all drawn here like flies.</P>
<P>Wow! So you don't like the library, already! For some reason, all the
vampires in this movie have to demand that their victims tell them to go
away. This way, when they get bitten, it's the victim's own fault, the
victim's own free will, or so the argument is presented to us. We suppose
that the heavy dose of Cypress Hill on the soundtrack, with their message
that consenual crimes (i.e. using drugs) are OK, is probably supposed to
underscore this theme. Profound, huh?</P>
<P>KATHLEEN: Sure, it's easy to spot in people like me. The cancer's grown
obvious. But you're as terminal as I am, you know that? You're as addicted
as I am. It's the nature of the organism.</P>
<P>Zing! You showed us what for, Kathleen. On to the actors. The biggest name
in the cast is Christopher Walken, no stranger to either horror movies or
bad horror movies. He shows up for about ten minutes, suggests Kathleen
read NAKED LUNCH, and calls her 'nothing' about twenty times, apparently
because he can defecate and she can't.</P>
<P>Lili Taylor, as Kathleen, gives a pretty standard performance for this
kind of role. She gives a painfully self aware performance, but she is
playing a painfully pretentious character so we guess it fits. She also
amused us because of her resemblance to Gen X spokesperson and comedienne
Janeane Garofalo, so we guess you can say we were happy with her in
general.</P>
<P>What annoyed us so fully about this film is that it has no entertainment
value. It is totally obsessed with its 'message.'</P>
<P>KATHLEEN: Some things are more important that others. Besides, aren't you
the one who eschews speculative philosophy? </P>
<P>Large portions of the movie seemed like a lesson in philosophy, with
people quoting Sartre and reaffirming that Kirkagaard was right. This goes
on forever. Didn't director Abel Ferra (BAD LIEUTENANT) realize that this
was a vampire film? And vampire films should be either scary or fun?
Instead we get LOST BOYS 3: THE DISSERTATION. It's EXOTICA with fangs. Or
considering that the Janeane Garofalo look-a-like's best friend is tall
and blonde, maybe it's THE TRUTH ABOUT BATS AND FOGS. It would be the
second vampire movie Janeane Garofalo has been in, the other being REALITY
BITES.</P>
<P>The only entertaining moment in the film is when, after obtaining her
doctorate, Kathleen sucks the blood out of one of the professors on her
dissertation committee. We're pretty sure she meant this act as social
commentary on her student loans, but the rest of the movie showed us
nothing interesting.</P>
<P>JEAN: So you what, ur, you want an apology for ethical relativism or something?</P>
<P>THE GUYS AT STOMP TOKYO: No, just an apology for this movie.</P>
