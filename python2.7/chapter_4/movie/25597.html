<PRE>                             HOLLOW MAN
                  A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Really disappointing is this films
          complete failure of originality and imagination.
          Now that filmmakers have visual special effects
          sufficient to do an invisible man story on the
          screen, they no longer have writers who can
          think of intriguing things to do with the idea.
          Some incredible special effects cannot save a
          pedestrian and overly familiar plot.  Rating: 3
          (0 to 10), -1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     If Hollywood's makers of summer films can be said to show any
creativity and imagination--admittedly a difficult point of view to
defend--it is in how they manage to takes such a variety of film
premises and turn them into standard borrowed endings.  It is truly
remarkable how many different films build to cliches like the
sympathetic underdogs winning the big game.  The other standard
ending, which if you think about it is only a variation on the first
one, is the sympathetic heroes in a confined space facing and
defeating something that wants to kill, perhaps already has, but
cannot itself be killed.  We saw it in IT! THE TERROR FROM BEYOND
SPACE, ALIEN, ALIENS, HALLOWEEN, and who knows how many more films.
Of the eight films playing currently at my local multiplex three
have unkillable killer endings.  One of them is HOLLOW MAN which
begins as a revisiting of concepts from H. G. Wells's THE INVISIBLE
MAN but in the end is just two people being chased by a perfectly
visible monster and killing him several times only to have him keep
on coming.  The once-respectable Paul Verhoeven should have rejected
the script as inferior, but instead let it be just another step in
his decline.  Besides its striking lack of originality HOLLOW MAN
wastes some of the most interesting convention of the Invisible Man.</P>
<P>     Most invisible man films are all based on H. G. Wells's novel
THE INVISIBLE MAN.  That novel is itself a reframing of the story of
Gyges, which today we remember best through its reference in Plato's
REPUBLIC.  Gyges, a shepherd who comes into possession of a ring of
invisibility, uses it unscrupulously to make himself king.  In the
dialog of THE REPUBLIC Glaucon suggests that god-like power, like
that of Gyges, of necessity corrupts.  These stories look at the
power an invisible man has and frequently examine whether that power
really does necessarily corrupt the person who has that power.  One
important aspect is that he can be virtually anywhere unseen, using
his power in clever ways.  But since this film places the invisible
man in an inescapable deep lab complex (with the exception of one
short sequence) most of the imaginative power of the concept is
thrown away.  There is just too much haste to get to the secure
territory of cliches and ultra-familiar plotting.</P>
<P>     Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) heads up a super secret
government project.  With his ingenious process he already can make
animals invisible.  Ironically his most difficult problem is making
them visible again.  (Perhaps this is also an idea borrowed from
Wells.  As the novel begins Griffin has already made himself
invisible and struggles to find the way back to visibility.  The old
Universal Invisible Man series stretches this quest over multiple
films.)  For Sebastian's discoveries he expects to win a Nobel
Prize.  (Why does every cinematic mad scientist who can grow a
three-foot-long blood-sucking garden slug think that is what they
give Nobel prizes for?)  The military is ready to cut his funding
for lack of usable results so Sebastian decides to experiment on
himself.  He already is a bit of a jerk, will the power that
invisibility gives him exaggerate his character flaws into madness?
Was this plot built from a kit or what?</P>
<P>     This is a film that could have risen to the level of mediocre,
but blows it in the cliched final reel.  Sure, there is a tradition
in films that the hero and the villain survive hazards and
situations that really should have killed them.  The final sequences
of this film go beyond any reasonable suspension of disbelief.  The
writers confuse the concepts of "invisible" and "invincible."
Sebastian goes through a gauntlet that should have reduced him to
the consistency of tapioca pudding, made even worse by him running
around without the protection of clothing, but he keeps on fighting.
The heroes themselves survive treatment only a little gentler.</P>
<P>     The script by Andrew W. Marlowe seems oblivious to the most
basic technical issues about invisibility.  H. G. Wells gave more
thought to the technical questions of invisibility than went into
this film.  This film uses Star-Trek-style double-talk physics to
explain the invisibility in the first place, something like a
"quantum phase shift," but then apparently is going to use chemical
and biological means to bring the guy back.  At one point Sebastian
eats a Twinkie and it is immediately invisible.  Wells knew better.
Sebastian is totally invisible and yet his eyes are apparently still
focusing.  Again Wells knew better.  Even the opportunities for
prurient voyeurism, while absent from Wells, have been handled
considerably better elsewhere.  Jerry Goldsmith probably saw little
effort on the part of the filmmakers to exercise much imagination
and followed suit with what is one of his least memorable scores.</P>
<P>     Not to be totally negative and to give the film its due, the
special effects are uniformly dazzling.  The original series used a
few simple effects that were not entirely convincing.  Most notably
I believe they filmed in a black room an actor with clothing over a
black velvet suit that totally covered him.  Only the clothing shows
and it gives them an image they could lay on top of another shot.
The computer has changed a very great deal.  The visuals here are
flawless and delightful.  Also as is ironically if frequently the
case, even a very bad horror film can have a very good first scene.
(MARS ATTACKS is a prime example.  Most of what is good in that film
is in the pre-credit sequence.) The horror potential of concept of
an invisible predator has never been captured on film so well as in
the first scene of HOLLOW MAN.  That makes it all the more
disappointing how the filmmakers so badly blew the rest of the film.</P>
<P>     For the same budget this film could have brought the invisible
man film into the modern age.  Instead if will hopefully quickly
sink from sight.  I rate this a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a -1 on
the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
