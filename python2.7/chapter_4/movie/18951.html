<P>_The_General's_Daughter_ (R) *** (out of ****)</P>
<P>It appears that the "in" thing for directors of popcorn fluff to do
these days is tackle projects of greater weight--witness _Ace_Ventura_
helmer Tom Shadyac's _Patch_Adams_ and _While_You_Were_Sleeping_ director
Jon Turtletaub's _Instinct_.  Yet while those films proved--all too
painfully--the limits of their respective directors' skills, _Con_Air_
director Simon West respectably stretches beyond slam-bang action
theatrics with the largely absorbing mystery thriller
_The_General's_Daughter_.  </P>
<P>However, West is not completely immune to regressing to his
commercial-bred bag of tricks.  That's not necessarily a bad thing; in
fact, West channels that energy into some effective sequences.  The quick
edits during a big fight scene between Army investigator Paul Brenner
(John Travolta) and a weapons-trading baddie are initially distracting,
but they do succeed in ratcheting up the tension level.  The frenetic
visual style works even more effectively in a harrowing rape scene, where
the cuts keep the onscreen happenings from being overly graphic and
exploitative, all the while still jangling the audience's nerves.</P>
<P>What does become problematic, though, is West's insistence on pleasing
the audience in the broadest terms.  The story, based on the best selling
novel by Nelson DeMille, revolves the brutal murder of the title
character, Army captain Elisabeth Campbell (Leslie Stefanson), an Army
captain; brought in to solve the crime is Brenner and rape investigator
Sarah Sunhill (Madeleine Stowe).  It soon becomes clear that the two have
stumbled onto something bigger, and must (as the tagline goes) "go behind
the lies" to find the truth.  Complex issues of honor, military code, and
loyalty are brought up along the way, and they are all fairly
intelligently handled--that is, until the underwhelming end.  A big
explosion at the climax serves no real purpose other than to inflate the
budget and sate audiences hungry for pyrotechnics.  The film rebounds
with a thought-provoking coda, but instead of leaving audiences with
something to chew on, West spoils the mood with an arbitrary (perhaps
test screening-mandated?) closing text card that divulges the ultimate
fate of one key character.  As if not knowing when to quit, he ruins
things further with rolling the end credits over a pointless shot of
another character literally driving off into the sunset.</P>
<P>Nonetheless, these missteps do not fatally dilute
_The_General's_Daughter_'s effectiveness.  While Christopher Bertolini
and William Goldman's script takes some interesting twists and turns,
what keeps the film gripping are the actors.  Apparently learning a page
from his _Con_Air_ producer, Jerry Bruckheimer, whose instincts at
casting are rarely less than keen, West's actors are a perfect fit for
their roles.  Travolta is ideally cast as the alternately goofy and
no-nonsense yet always on-target Brenner; Stowe, exuding her usual air of
intelligence, works well off of him.  James Woods is in his element as
Elisabeth's shady and slimy mentor; just as intimidating, if not more, is
Clarence Williams III as a colonel loyal to the general (James Cromwell,
carving out a nice post-_Babe_ career as an all-purpose character actor).</P>
<P>Although it has more dramatic heft than a _Con_Air_,
_The_General's_Daughter_ is a fairly comfortable step for West; in the
end, it's still unmistakably a Hollywood entertainment, which kept his
wrong turns from being ruinous ones.  Nonetheless, it is an important
step for him, one that shows that he has a grasp on substance as well as
style--and, as such, making him a filmmaker to keep an eye on.</P>
