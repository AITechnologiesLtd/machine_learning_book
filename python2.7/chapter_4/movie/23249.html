<P> Reindeer Games (2000) 1/2 star out of 4. Starring Ben Affleck, Charlize
Theron and Gary Sinese. Directed by John Frankenheimer</P>
<P> Take my word for it, you don't want to play in any of these "Reindeer
Games."</P>
<P> This convoluted heist caper is turgid, stupid and preposterous, an
embarrassment for director John Frankenheimer, a man whose distinguished
career has included such classics as "The Manchurian Candidate," "Seven
Days in May" and "Seconds."</P>
<P> The main problem with "Reindeer Games" is the illogical complexity of
what is basically a simple robbery. Plus the actions of the characters
seem dictated more by script necessities than by what could be
considered normal - or even abnormal - human behavior.</P>
<P> The basic story involves Rudy (Ben Affleck), a car thief who, when
released from prison, masquerades as his slain cellmate Nick (James
Frain), because he has fallen in love with Ashley (Charlize Theron),
Nick's prison pen pal, who promised to meet him upon his release.</P>
<P> Rudy and Ashley's brief romantic interlude is violently cut short by
Gabriel (Gary Sinese), Ashley's brother, who wants Rudy - whom he
believes is Nick - to help him and his gang rob a Michigan casino at
which Nick once worked as a security guard.</P>
<P> Of course, no one believes Rudy when he tells them he is not Nick,
despite his complete ignorance about the casino and its workings.</P>
<P> Gabriel and his cohorts are the gang that couldn't shoot straight. They
are long-distance truckers who run guns on the side. And they all have
unusual names such as Merlin, Pug and Jumpy. Gabriel's nickname is
Monster, so of course he acts like one.</P>
<P> As "Reindeer Games" progresses, we are treated to a series of double
identities, double crosses, botched set-ups, lots of gunfire and more
twists than a Chubby Checker dance marathon.</P>
<P> Now all of this sounds like it should be an exciting outing. But, for
some reason, there is too much talk, too much exposition and "Reindeer
Games" just drags and sputters on and on.</P>
<P> The characters are so cartoonish, so unbelievable - and act so dumb
that one wonders how they could rob a 7-Eleven, let alone a casino.</P>
<P> Affleck has no chance to stretch his acting chops. In fact, he goes
through the movie merely posing, acting the leading man, instead of the
paroled convict.</P>
<P> Sinese, who is usually a performer of exceptional quality, made a bad
career decision with this flick. His Gabriel merely rants and raves, and
he is supposed to be the brains of the outfit.</P>
<P> Theron looks pretty and works hard at acting the seductress, but she
lacks that Barbara Stanwyck-"Double Indemnity" hard edge needed for her
character.
Frankenheimer merely lets his scenes drag on. Judicious editing -
cutting "Reindeer Games" from its nearly two hours to about 90 minutes -
may have improved the overall pacing, but it is doubtful it would have
salvaged this mediocre misfire.</P>
<P> "Reindeer Games" is no fun at all. It is a slow, dim-witted excuse for
sex, gunfire and a Ben Affleck butt shot. And even that's not reason
enough to spend your money.</P>
