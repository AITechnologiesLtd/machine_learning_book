<P>It is rare to see an action-adventure film that evokes memories of the action
serials of yesteryear - remember The Masked Avenger or Buck Rogers? A
commonplace argument is that recent action films focus more on Dolby-ized
explosions and car crashes than any story or plot. "The Mask of Zorro" is that
rarity - a fast-paced, rollicking action film that brings back the snap and
vigor of Zorro in all its glory, without resorting to extreme violence or heavy
explosions, and it has a reasonably decent story to tell.</P>
<P>During the opening sequence, we learn that Zorro, otherwise known as Don Diego
de la Vega (played with panache by Anthony Hopkins) is the masked hero of the
Mexican people. Some prisoners are about to be executed by a firing squad led by
Governor Don Rafaelo Montero (Stuart Wilson), and the crowd bawls. Before you
know it, Zorro comes out of thin air and rescues the prisoners with sword, whip,
a trusty steed, and attitude. Unfortunately, he is apprehended by Montero's
guards resulting in the death of his wife. </P>
<P>Twenty years later, Alejandro Murieta (Antonio Banderas) is a wandering street
thief who inexplicably becomes Zorro's star pupil - I say inexplicably because
who would want to tutor a curly long-haired wanderer on the street, but never
mind. Zorro teaches Murieta everything about swords, chivalry, matters of
etiquette, conversation, and well-groomed appearances. Thus, Murieta becomes the
new, dashing Zorro slicing his way through several of Montero's minions, and
dancing elegantly with Montero's daughter, Elena (British-born Catherine
Zeta-Jones), who is really Vega's daughter. </P>
<P>"The Mask of Zorro" has plenty of stunts and action scenes, but its main thrust
is an expanded backstory about Vega's past and the revenge he seeks on his
wife's death. This exposition with the well-cast Hopkins shows more flair and
promise than I might have anticipated, even for a hokey Hollywood production
like this one. </P>
<P>As for Banderas and Zeta-Jones, they do have sparkling chemistry, culminating in
a romantic kiss during a sword duel. The biggest weakness is Stuart Wilson
(previously a villain in "Lethal Weapon 3") as the fatuous Montero who isn't
remotely threatening or evil. Still, "The Mask of Zorro" is as escapist and fun
as Hollywood has been getting lately.</P>
