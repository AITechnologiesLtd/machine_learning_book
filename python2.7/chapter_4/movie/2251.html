<PRE>                          MAN'S BEST FRIEND
                       A review by The Phantom
                           (<A HREF="mailto:sbb@panix.com">sbb@panix.com</A>)</PRE>
<P>     As it happens, the very friendly-looking, good-natured dog that is
the star of MAN'S BEST FRIEND -- John Lafia's ill-fated, poorly-made
updating of Stephen King's CUJO -- is apparently supposed to be rather
more evil-minded than the enthusiastic, happy-go-lucky fool he appears
to be throughout most of the film.  And he is, in fact, a Tibetan
mastiff, a bit of information the Phantom was able to glean from the
review in the New York Times -- which can only mean that it was
mentioned in the press kit, since the reviewer assigned to the unsavory
task of writing up this turkey normally spends his time reviewing pop
music and likely knows even less about dogs than he does about horror
films.  As no press kits were made available to the Phantom, he'll
trust Mr. Holden got the breed right, even if the rest of his review
was, as usual, something less than helpful.</P>
<P>     The Phantom figured that Max (short for EMAX 3000, his official
designation as yet another genetically-enhanced product of science run
amok) was part of the "working dog" group, but it was hard to tell
exactly what breed this smiling, happy dog was.  Not St. Bernard,
though that was the Phantom's first guess, perhaps influenced by the
preview for BEETHOVEN'S 2ND, a movie that as it happens looks a lot
like MAN'S BEST FRIEND with fewer prosthetic canine effects and one or
two less maulings.  And he certainly wasn't a Doberman, or a
Rottweiller, or a German Shepherd -- or in fact any breed of dog bred
for at least a modicum of aggression under the right circumstances.  Or
any breed in the Husky family that might, on first sight, raise uneasy
thoughts of our none-too-friendly relationship with wolves and other
wild predators.  No indeed.  This dog was just a big, sloppy, friendly
dog of indeterminate breed who wouldn't scare a three-year-old; and
unless one harbored an unreasonable fear of drool, it's hard to see how
he could inspire even a worried thought or two, let alone real terror.</P>
<P>     Cujo was a big, normally harmless St. Bernard-like mutt, which
might have raised similar problems for King; however, Cujo was rabid,
and a rabid St. Bernard could certainly engage in activities a tad more
worrisome than chronic slipper-chewing.  And while Lewis Teague's
screen adaptation was not entirely successful, it did at least capture
the horror inherent in the situation: a normally domesticated friend of
man who, because he becomes possessed by forces outside of his control,
turns on his master and everyone else he would normally do no more than
drool on.  It's exactly the scenario that made CHILD'S PLAY such an
effective film -- what could be more frightening than seeing a friend
turn on us, especially one that should be entirely in our control?
Lafia, who as a writer-director turned in a very serviceable entry in
the "small doll run amok" sub-genre of horror cinema with CHILD'S PLAY
2 (and whose witty screenplay helped make the original CHILD'S PLAY a
sleeper hit), seems a bit at sea here, not knowing how MAN'S BEST
FRIEND should play -- one moment we're convinced that Max might really
run amok, and the next we're listening to a none-too-convincing parrot
get all the best lines in the screenplay.</P>
<P>     The very thin plot revolves around Ally Sheedy who, as a hot-shot
television news producer, discovers that the friendly mad scientists at
EMAX experiment on animals.  After a daring break-in, Sheedy and her
assistant go to some lengths to present us with a brief episode of
"Vivisection on Parade" -- film which would make any PETA member proud,
and which presumably provides MAN'S BEST FRIEND with its redeeming
social value; then Sheedy discovers Max.  Naturally upon seeing a very
large, caged and tortured animal, the first thing she does is pose with
him; the second thing she does is release him and take him home with
her, making only a quick pit-stop at a local 7-11 to get mugged and
allow Max to perform an off-camera Charles Bronson impersonation by
mauling the mugger (in a startlingly non-graphic off-camera scene) and
returning Sheedy's purse to her.  The fact that the mugger is nearly
dismembered is not revealed until very late in the film, leaving us to
wonder both how the film planned to go about earning its "R" rating and
how Max -- who returns to the parking lot looking just as happy and
well-groomed as he left it -- cleaned himself up so much in the few
seconds he had off camera.  Just the first of far too many continuity
problems in the sloppily-written screenplay; occasionally the Phantom
enjoys keeping track of such blunders, but in the case of MAN'S BEST
FRIEND it quickly became clear that if he kept count he'd need more
than two paws to do so; in fact Lafia's screenplay is on occasion so
bad that it seemed a whole litter's worth of paws might be needed.</P>
<P>     Putting continuity and a distinct lack of horror aside, early on
it became obvious to the Phantom that Sheedy was, herself, part of
what's wrong with MAN'S BEST FRIEND, and that he was not the only
member of the audience hoping for her timely demise (hopefully at Max's
hand -- or rather, his paw).  Her character is written as unlikable and
stupid, and Sheedy certainly does the role credit; yet as incredible as
it may seem, Sheedy's character is the most likeable and intelligent in
the film.  Her yuppie boyfriend certainly goes to great lengths to be
as unappealing as possible, and yet it's not until the film is nearly
over that Max decides to put us out of our misery by engaging in yet
another off-camera mauling.  Tied for third in the "least appealing
character in this film" contest are everyone else.</P>
<P>     This would not necessarily be a bad thing, since after all there's
nothing like watching a really annoying character get chewed to death,
but Lafia is curiously reluctant to show much of anything on camera.
Yes, special effects are expensive, but what's the point of making an
R-rated horror film that's less violent than HOME ALONE?  So as in
JURASSIC PARK, much of the carnage is left to our imaginations; of
course Speilberg wanted JURASSIC PARK to be as much of a horror film as
JAWS and DUEL were and filmed it as such, whereas it looks like Lafia
aimed for horror/comedy and missed.  MAN'S BEST FRIEND, on the
infrequent occasions when it does decide to turn back into a horror
film, plays a lot like ALIEN might had it been set in the middle of a
open, sunny field, rather than on a dark, claustrophobic spaceship.
Since the maulings are all shot from Max's perspective; since we know
where everyone is throughout; and since in any event the carnage is
something less than graphic, the audience doesn't find itself exactly
overwhelmed by feelings of tension or terror.  Which leaves the comic
aspects of MAN'S BEST FRIEND, about which the less said the better.</P>
<P>     And then there's Max himself, who is presented throughout the
first two-thirds of the film as a sort of Lassie on steroids, able to
maul muggers, rid the neighborhood of pesky cats, and perform minor
light truck repairs while bounding around with a suspiciously sunny
disposition.  Even by the end of the film, and wearing a fair amount of
uncomfortable-looking canine prosthetics, Max just doesn't come off as
a worthy successor to DEVIL DOG: THE HOUND FROM HELL (the
mid-seventies, made-for-television production that remains one of the
prototypical "Man's Worst Enemy" horror films).  We wait, it seems in
vain, for Max to get mean, or angry, or even the least perturbed, but
waiting is the order of the day in MAN'S BEST FRIEND -- nothing much
happens when the screenplay isn't focused on a cliched set piece (Max
chases a cat; Max finds true love in the form of a collie named Heidi;
Max pays back the abusive, crazy-looking, junkyard-dwelling loner with
which the idiot Sheedy left him after reading his "Dog needed for
endless, cruel abuse -- large friendly dogs with amiable, sunny
dispositions preferred" want-ad in the newspaper and deciding that this
would be the best way to keep Max out of the hands of the mad
scientists at EMAX).  And when Max finally snaps, he does so only
because he's been so thoroughly provoked that even had he been
cross-bred with Ghandi he could hardly have restrained himself
further.  Although Max is not exactly kept on the shortest of leashes
in this film, he generally does little more than perform a set number
of impressive tricks and wonder whether every washed up, post-BREAKFAST
CLUB actor will eventually be reduced to co-starring with members of
another species.</P>
<P>     Lance Henriksen, as the mad-scientist-who-would-dare-to-play-God,
blunders through much of the film harassing two stereotypical cops and
urging them to find his million-dollar dog; should Max continue to
remain unfound, there's no telling what might happen.  Dire things are
predicted: once the drugs that keep Max looking and acting an awful lot
like a very clever, well-trained and friendly Tibetan mastiff wear off,
he will be transformed into a crazed, unstoppable killing machine,
ridding the film of extraneous characters left and right.  Maulings;
chewings; fatal lickings -- anything could happen.  Carnage-A-Go-Go --
really!  But the Phantom should have known better, much as the two
people who walked out on the film midway through obviously did.  Any
film that talks this much about terrible things to come generally
provides little in the way of terror, and much in the way of being just
plain terrible.</P>
<P>     The Phantom could go on, but let's face it -- this film just
doesn't work.  Sheedy needs to call her agent; Max should call his
trainer; and Lafia should stick to playing with dolls.  Although MAN'S
BEST FRIEND has a few funny moments, it can't hold a candle to
BEETHOVEN; and as far as horror goes, it was fairly obvious to the
Phantom that the screenplay wasn't HOUSE-broken enough to qualify.
Calling this film a dog is too easy; but as we're just days away from
Thanksgiving, calling it a turkey will do.</P>
