<P>   Reviewing a recent Hollywood blockbuster, New 
Republic critic Stanley Kauffmann advised that "we all have a
bomb ticking inside us."  This is not a surprising revelation. 
Think of all the books, plays and movies that would otherwise
never have seen the light of day.  David Rabe is one writer
who has made a career from this wisdom.  The Iowa-born
playwright believes that this interior bomb is the ultimate
truth; that wars are merely the external expression of a rage
that demands release.  His best work, "Streamers," is a
sharply written, highly focussed and firmly paced tale of three
soldiers in a Virginia army barracks--an intellectual, a gay
man, and a black--whose life in the quarters takes a dramatic
turn when one of them goes ballistic.  "Hurlyburly," Rabe's
1984 play which enjoyed an opening in New York's
Promenade Theater in 1984 with a dynamite cast, is not as
fortuitious an achievement.  By contrast with "Streamers,"
"Hurlyburly" is flowery and overwritten, an end-of-the-world
play about Hollywood sharks whose internal rage seeks
release in their attitudes and conduct toward women.  Though
director Anthony Drazen tries mightily to open it up in its
current screen version, its celluloid remake is a mistake; a
stagy, unfocused set of monologues which happen to be
spoken to others in the room.  Fueled by cocaine, the men in
the story and the largely masochistic women who associate
with them run through their experience in a drug-induced
haze.  The audience can't be blamed for feeling that they are
themselves enveloped by smog, by a surfeit of prose which
never lifts off to become lyrical.</P>
<P>   Perhaps the truest words articulated in the movie are by
the youngest member of the group, Donna (Anna Paquin),
who sums up the theme toward the conclusion of the two-
hour drama by exclaiming, "It's great when people know what
each other is talking about."  The ever-present chatter--the
"blah blah blah" as one of the characters periodically calls it--
is not especially revealing, though the writer may be making
the barb that the conversation of men in general runs in
much the same way.  During the initial half, the men vent
their spleen about women--bitches, whores, ghouls--while
during the final half, they are petulant, vulnerable, and seek
redemption at the hands of the very gender they have so
regularly belittled.  </P>
<P>   The principal character, Eddie (Sean Penn), is a casting
director who is ensconced in a Hollywood Hills villa with a
dramatic, hillside view.  He is joined by cronies, namely a
tough-guy actor with a prison record, Phil (Chazz Palmintieri);
a sceenwriter who is chasing deals, Artie (Gary Shandling);
and a smooth-talking business partner, Mickey (Kevin
Spacey), who is taking a break from his wife and kids. 
Shortly thereafter the company is to include a teen-age
drifter, Donna (Anna Paquin), whom Artie has found living in
an elevator; Darlene (Robin Wright Penn), who has been
dating both Eddie and Mickey; and a sweet stripper, Bonnie
(Meg Ryan) whose night out with Phil sets off a disastrous
chain of events.</P>
<P>   To punctuate the notion that these human beings are
leading lives of lives, deception, superficiality and
meaningless sensation-seeking, director Drazan cuts
frequently to news items on TV, which flashes a barrage of
seemingly unconnected stories--the newscasters taking little
time to penetrate the surface to catch the truth behind the
reports.  The male buddies in "Hurlyburly" lead lives of similar
prevarication, dismissing their depravities as merely aspects
of their personalities.  Drazan does a decent job of capturing
the anesthetized lives of these men, on several occasions
highlighting the diatribes of the psychotic Phil who, like one
person in David Rabe's "Streamers" is about to explode. 
When that occurs, the men break down in remorse and gain
new insights into their hurlyburly existence, intuitions that
allow them to make changes that could turn their lives
around.</P>
<P>   While this is Sean Penn's movie, allowing that actor to run
the gamut form self-satisfied, hollow casting director nose
deep in the cocaine culture to go below the surface (literally)
and save his soul, the performance to watch is Kevin
Spacey's.  This actor, remarkable in every role he is cast,
gives a fully realized performance as a self-protective cynic. 
We don't wonder why he hangs out with the fellows he does:
though he is the least mannered of the group, he gains his
own macho accreditation by standing above the fray, settled
in judgment over his less stable peers.  Fitted with an
outrageously cool white rug, Spacey's Mickey is the movie's
fully ripened, comic performance.  Meg Ryan is reliable as
the too-trusting stripper, eager to hook up with any decent-
looking man thrust upon her, while Chazz Palminteri plays to
type as a hoodlum whose wife--seen only once in the story--
must be the only smart one in town for having divorced him
and left his circle.</P>
<P>   While this movie version has an all-star cast, none except
Spacey is up to the dynamic group that appeared fourteen
years ago at a little-known off-Broadway theater; stars like
Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken, Jerry Stiller, Cynthia
Nixon, Judith Ivey, William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver.  With
a marquee like that and a director like Mike Nichols,
"Hurlyburly" was the year's play to catch.  As a film, however,
it comes across as static--though not nearly as inert as last
year's "The Designated Mourner" which ironically featured
Mike Nichols in the starring role.  Long on theatrics that
belong on the live stage, this filmed version appears sluggish,
a buddy movie spotlighting a good-ol'-boys network whose
wires are desperately crossed.</P>
