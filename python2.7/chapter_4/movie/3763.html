<P>     Wim Wenders must have considered this his dream film (literally,
as the story turns out).  His earler road movies (ALICE IN THE CITIES;
KINGS OF THE ROAD; PARIS, TEXAS) and preoccupation with transient,
questing characters finally comes to a head with UNTIL THE END OF THE
WORLD, a road movie that travels all over the planet, no less.</P>
<P>     The year is 1999, "the year the Indian satellite went out of
control", so we are told, and Claire (Solveig Dommartin), a freewilled
young woman, is given the opportunity of a lifetime when she lucks into
a cache of stolen money.  At almost the same time she meets an
enigmatic stranger (William Hurt) who steals a small amount of her
find, and so begins their global game of hide-and-seek, as Claire uses
the rest of her money to chase him from continent to continent.  This
chase, which drags in others (not the least of whom is Sam Neill,
Claire's former lover), seems to be the thrust of the film until about
halfway through when it abruptly stops in Australia (the end of the
world?), changes gear, and introduces a secondary cast and a new
story.  Suddenly Dommartin, Hurt, Neill, and others are involved with
Max Von Sydow's (Hurt's father) experiments to digitally reconstruct
images from the neo-cortex.</P>
<P>     Opinions will be divided among many over which half of the film is
better--or at least more enjoyable--but for some UNTIL THE END OF THE
WORLD will be just too much: too long, too big and too slow.  At the
outset, the material looks tailor-made for a whimsical fantasy (who
wouldn't like to chase someone clear across the globe?) but Wenders has
a curiously practical approach.  It's hard also to get a handle on
Dommartin's character.  Her motivation for hunting down Hurt is
unclear--is it obsession?  Romance?  The thrill of the chase?  Or does
she look upon her actions as the last expression of freedom and
spontaneity (her character is established as capricious right from the
start) beneath the decaying orbit of the satellite that hangs above her
head like a Damocletian sword?  Whatever the reason, she and Hurt do
not make a terribly convincing couple--but then again, perhaps they are
never meant to be.  Like the others in the cast, Hurt and Dommartin are
almost swamped by the scale of events Wenders places them in.  State of
the art technology (as it would be in 1999) is in every scene, and an
impressive soundtrack of original songs, specially commissioned by
Wenders, plays constantly throughout the first half of the film.</P>
<P>     It almost seems like Wenders' grand game, but we can enjoy
watching him shuffle the pieces because he never loses sight of the
humanity of the characters--witness the poignant scene in which Hurt
interviews his sister and her daughter.  And a final shot, capturing
the meditative wonder in Claire's face, is truly special, causing one
to reappraise the title of the film.  It's not a film to get serious
about and find fault with--you'd rather just let Wenders indulge
himself and take you along for the ride.  Naturally, with scale as
large as this, UNTIL THE END OF THE WORLD is best enjoyed on a big
screen--the video version suffers badly, not only in picture but also
in content, with half an hour pruned out of it.  See it in a cinema
with a good sound system, if you can.</P>
