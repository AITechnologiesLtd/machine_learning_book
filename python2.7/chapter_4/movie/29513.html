<P>A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001) 145m </P>
<P>In much the same way that Spielberg included the adjunct 'EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL' 
to his film E.T., the self-explanatory 'ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE' has been 
tagged on to what was previously known simply as A.I.  One can't imagine the 
late Stanley Kubrick, who nursed the project for many years, making such 
concessions, suggestive as they are of a dumbing-down of the original 
concept, but for all intents Spielberg has brought his version of it to the 
screen with integrity.  While he and Kubrick are considered superb 
technicians and masters of film-making, their art is approached from 
viewpoints that couldn't seem more opposite.  Spielberg is an emotive 
choreographer; Kubrick a philosophical visionary.  Kubrick spent years 
developing his story for A.I. (so many that he died before getting a final 
script); Spielberg had finished principal photography barely a year after 
announcing his intentions to make the film.  Whether or not A.I. is a 
success or failure is almost secondary to the fact that it creates an 
irresistible intersection point between these two major talents. </P>
<P>The 'Spielbrick' film, then, sees its genesis in a very short Brian Aldiss 
story, 'Super Toys Last All Summer Long'.  In truth this story by itself 
makes more sense as a Spielberg project than it does a Kubrick one, a fact 
that Kubrick himself acknowledged when he handed the material over to 
Spielberg for completion.  Significantly, it became the first feature 
screenplay written by Spielberg for nearly twenty years.  A.I. concerns 
itself with cybernetic technology so advanced that it can formulate concepts 
about itself beyond the boundaries of its program.  Hence David, the 'boy' 
who is the central character of the film, believes he is capable of love and 
seeks it in return.  He simulates all emotional sensations to the extent 
that they resonate in his programming just the way they might influence 
themselves physically in a living human body.  What's intriguing about A.I. 
is that the subject matter itself almost requires the collaboration of these 
two very different film-makers - one could not have made it without the 
other.  David is both Spielberg and Kubrick, a work of technological 
craftsmanship searching for a soul, an answer, and a resolution. </P>
<P>And here's the problem: A.I is multilayered, beautiful, unique and haunting, 
but early on it sets itself up for a resolution that it cannot possibly 
deliver.  David, drawing inspiration from the story of Pinocchio, wants to 
be a real boy.  This film may have fantastic elements, but it is not a 
fantasy, and no blue fairy is going to be waving a wand at its conclusion, 
which leaves only two outs: either David's mission will fail utterly or it 
will arrive at a compromise (which is another way of saying 'cop-out').  It 
appears that any likely ending is going to leave us wanting, but for a 
while, it looks like Spielberg has a chance of pulling it off.  On my first 
viewing of A.I. I had no idea of the film's length and thought that the film 
had reached its conclusion around the two hour mark, in a striking scene 
that found David confronting the object of his quest personified.  It was a 
moment I found profoundly moving, and the fact that it had drawn such a 
powerful emotional response from me was enough to prove itself entirely 
satisfying as the film's ending.  But as anyone who has seen the film knows, 
there is more to come beyond this scene, and A.I. still has a whole separate 
act to follow. </P>
<P>As it happens, I find the 'actual' finale less satisfying if only for the 
reason that I'm not sure how I am  supposed to react to it emotionally.  
These narrative leaps of faith are more Kubrick's technique for storytelling 
than Spielberg's, and the film makes a habit of dramatically altering its 
tone and setting.  The first act is mesmerizing and intimate, and holds us 
in thrall with its world of possibilities; the second becomes visceral and 
nightmarish; the third a voyage of isolation, despair and hope.  It's an 
approach that will irritate many viewers, and at odds with the mass audience 
that Spielberg is accustomed to catering for.  If you're drawn into the 
story, then you won't care too much about its changing backgrounds.  The 
point is that the foreground remains the same throughout.  Haley Joel Osment 
is a wonder as David, pulling off the formidable task of making us believe 
he is an artificial life form, or 'mecha', from the moment he first appears. 
  His companionship with a pleasure mecha called Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) and a 
'supertoy' teddy bear provides cinema with a trio like none other you have 
seen (some of these images seem destined as instant classics).  The rest of 
A.I. follows suit - its distinctive art direction, continuously provocative 
questions (it doesn't try to presume answers), and John Williams score 
(which follows in the footsteps of Phillip Glass) combine to create a film 
like nothing that Spielberg, or anyone else for that matter, has done 
before. </P>
<P>But technical aspects aside, the major achievement of A.I. must be that it 
is able to funnel our emotional investment into a character that is a 
machine, and moreover, to do it without seeming manipulative.  We are never 
allowed to forget that David is not a real boy, but this does not stop him 
from gaining our empathy.  Even though we should know better, we don't 
discriminate between a human being with real feelings, or a simulacra that 
is programmed to believe it has real feelings (in much the same way that a 
crowd at a robotic demolition derby are instantly convinced that David is 
real when he shows fear).  Why do we accept David so easily?  Because years 
of going to the movies have taught us so; for what is any person we see on 
screen but a scripted character played by a hired actor?  Arguably, the 
success of any film is not dependent on our abilities to separate ourselves 
from its actors or acting, but our connection with the emotional content 
they are working in.  Kubrick had already proved this with non-human 
characters in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, during the justifiably famous scene in 
which the computer HAL is dismantled and 'dies' before our eyes.  A.I. 
relies on that part of us, as human beings, which projects itself on to 
inanimate objects, and in turn is projected back to us via the cinema 
screen.  Is it possible to identify the moment where our animatism turns to 
animism?  It's one many conundrums offered in the story, and even David 
himself is unable to tell, as is heartbreakingly proved by his belief that a 
simple statue has the power to grant him a wish.  He may be the most 
sophisticated creation of his time, yet he is still programmed with the 
reasoning of a child. </P>
<P>In the end, A.I. is the kind of project that the term 'flawed masterpiece' 
is reserved for.  It reminds me of 'Tintin and Alph-Art', the final book of 
Herge's Tintin series that was unofficially completed in different 
capacities by other artists working from his notes and sketches.  It's 
there, and it's not there.  It almost feels like something that was never 
meant to be there, or something that you'd dreamed about but never expected 
to see in the waking world.  Even though Spielberg's heart is beating 
throughout A.I.  you still feel the ghost of Kubrick watching from hidden 
vantage points.  It may be disappointing, or it may be the stuff of genius.  
But the reasons I'd give for anyone interested in watching A.I. are the same 
I'd give for reading 'Alph-Art'.  The fact is, it was made, and we have the 
opportunity to see it at last, for better or worse: whether you think you're 
going to enjoy it or not, how could you bear never to know? </P>
