The Thin Red Line (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>a review by Christian Pyle</PRE>
<P>The television ads for "The Thin Red Line" promise "images you'll never be able
to shake."  Thankfully, that blurb is hyperbole (psychological scars are not
something I'm looking for in a movie experience), but the line from the ads
suggests a collection of powerful fragments, which is what "Red Line" offers.</P>
<P>"The Thin Red Line," based on a novel by James Jones, marks the return of
writer/director Terrence Malick after a twenty-year absence.  Malick's previous
works as a director-"Badlands" (1973) and "Days of Heaven" (1978)-still garner
the praise of critics.  Several Hollywood stars (including George Clooney, John
Travolta, Woody Harrelson, and John Cusack) took small roles in "Red Line" just
for the opportunity of working with Malick.</P>
<P>The movie is about the effort to drive the Japanese out of Guadalcanal in World
War II.  It's an ensemble piece with a variety of characters, each dealing with
the horrors of war in his own way.  There's no clear protagonist or linear plot
development, but these may not be faults-war doesn't have a protagonist or a
plot.  Malick explores the psychological and philosophical aspects of war, the
latter in voice-overs in which various characters muse about the meaning of it
all.  </P>
<P>There is brilliance in this movie-powerful images, intense performances,
thought-provoking confrontations-but the accumulation of beautifully-crafted
fragments never melts together into a coherent whole.  This lack of cohesion is
probably due to contradictory desires for what the movie should express.  The
desire to represent the scope of war by painting a large canvas competes with
the desire to explore the psychologies of individual characters in depth.  The
viewer has trouble remembering who's who, and the size of the roster leaves
little time, even in a three-hour movie, to develop the characters clearly. 
The desire to pose philosophical questions raised by war competes with the
desire to capture the intensity of combat.  The voice-overs suggest a lyrical
repose where characters can muse on the why's of war, but the characters live
in constant danger.</P>
<P>So, we are left with a pile of fine pieces.  "Red Line" begins with deserter
Pvt. Witt (Jim Caviezel) enjoying a separate peace with island natives whose
simple lives centered around family and community contrast with the war. 
Later, pulled back into the war, Witt wanders through another native village
and sees a collection of human skulls.  The war in these Pacific islands is a
siege of paradise.  The scenery the soldiers plod through is breathtakingly
beautiful and tranquil, a powerful contrast to the machinery of war.</P>
<P>Many of the most dramatic moments occur as Charlie Company crawls up a grassy
hill to attack the Japanese machine gun nest hidden above.  The camera gives us
a soldier's perspective, crouching in the mud, unable to see through the
surrounding grass.  Explosions burst nearby, appearing suddenly and seemingly
at random.  Machine-gun fire crackles ahead.  Malick draws us into the terror
of war for soldiers who are like us, ordinary Joes plucked out of their
ordinary peacetime lives.</P>
<P>Their leaders, too, are unused to combat.  Halfway up the hill, Capt. Staros
(Elias Koteas), a lawyer in civilian life, refuses to advance for fear that his
men will all be slaughtered.  Staros' refusal draws his commander, Col. Tall
(Nick Nolte), closer to the fray.  Tall is an aging West Point graduate who's
been passed over for promotion.  This is his first war, and he is eager to
prove himself.  The two men play off of each other-Staros, unwilling to
sacrifice any man's life no matter how important the objective; Tall, can see
only the objective and is puzzled by the concern that Staros and Capt. Gaff
(John Cusack) have for their men.</P>
<P>The conflict between Tall and his captains is parallel to a conflict between
Sgt. Welsh (Sean Penn) and Witt.  Penn gives the most compelling and complex
performance of the movie, and Welsh is a fascinating mixture of cynicism and
heroism.  Other performances are considerably weaker, particularly the cameos
by Clooney and Travolta.</P>
