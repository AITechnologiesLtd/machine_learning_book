<P>Richard Gere follows his heart and stars in this picture that
ironically pits his character against the government of China. Let it
be known that Gere, a devout Buddhist, does not generate a huge
following amongst the officials of the Chinese government, as his
stance for the freedom of Tibet has been widely documented. </P>
<P>PLOT:
Businessman Moore (Gere) goes to China to negotiate distribution rights
to American television programs with the government of China. During a
reckless night out, Mr. Moore hooks up with a sexy Chinese woman,
bringing her back to his apartment for a little nightcap. The next day,
Moore is awakened by the Chinese police, who charge him with the murder
of said sexy Chinese woman, now lying dead in apartment. If found
guilty, Moore could face the firing squad. The US embassy, many
high-ranking Chinese officials, and an intelligent Chinese defense
lawyer all get involved in this mysterious case. </P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Interesting, insightful, somewhat derivative, and a tad overlong,
suspense tale that managed to keep me awake and entertained through
most of its hackneyed tactics and plot twists. Granted, I recently saw
RETURN TO PARADISE (7.5/10) set in Malaysia, which was much more
original and gripping. True, the ultimate
American-caught-in-a-foreign-jail-cell film will always be MIDNIGHT
EXPRESS (8/10). But having said that, this film was good enough for
what it was (mindless entertainment for Mrs. JoBlo, me and some nachos
on a Saturday nite), and even offered some small moments of actual
suspense. </P>
<P>The acting was so-so on Gere's part, who seems to be walking through
most of his roles of late, (on his way to the Dalai Lama's pad, I
imagine) but a great performance by his defense lawyer, Bai Ling, makes
the characters much more compelling than they might've been on paper.
Another thing that I liked about this film is the fact that it didn't
just show the Chinese justice system as an ancient, unfair system
compared to our "great"American counterpart. The film made sure that we
saw some of the strengths in their system, while simultaneously
demonstrating the real weaknesses that remain in ours. </P>
<P>All in all, the film is no masterpiece by any stretch of the "fish out
of water movies" book of imagination, but I guess it didn't really hurt
while swallowing and left very little taste in my mouth, so check it
out if you feel like a decent thrilling flick set in a foreign country
starring the wonderboy of salt-and-pepper hair, Richard Gere (Note:
There's also a decent shot of Rick's big white ass at one point in this
picture...if you're into that kind of thing, that is.) Keep in mind
that I found the ending to be rather anti-climactic, and that the film
could have been cut by about twenty minutes or so, but with my nachos
warm and my Coke cold as ice, what the heck did I have to complain
about ?!?</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Richard Gere was married to supermodel by day, playboy centerfold by
night, Cindy Crawford for about four years. He was born in
Philadelphia, and was banned from the Oscars once after making
anti-China comments on the air at the 1993 ceremony.
Screenwriter Robert King also wrote the script for one of the 90's
biggest flops: CUTTHROAT ISLAND. 
Bai Ling played the character of Myca in the original CROW (8.5/10)
film opposite Brandon Lee. She was born in China, in the year 1970.</P>
