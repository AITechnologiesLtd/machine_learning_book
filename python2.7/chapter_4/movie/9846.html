<PRE>Chad'z rating: ** (out of 4 = fair)</PRE>
<P>1997, PG-13, 90 minutes [1 hour, 30 minutes]</P>
<PRE>[comedy]</PRE>
<P>starring: Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean), Peter MacNicol (David Langley), Pamela
Reed (Alison Langley), Harris Yulin (George Grierson); written by Richard
Curtis, Robin Driscoll; produced by Tim Bevan, Eric Fellner; directed by Mel
Smith.</P>
<P>Seen Monday, November 17, 1997 at 7:20 p.m. at The Glenwood Movieplex Cinemas
(Oneida, N.Y.), theater #4, by myself for free (press pass). [Theater rating:
**1/2: fuzzy, dark picture, slightly uncomfortable seats, average sound.]</P>
<P>The problem with making a motion picture related to some kind of cult
following is that it usually doesn't adapt well to the mainstream. And it's
not that "Bean" fails because of this principle (although that has a lot to
do with it), it's just not a very funny, nor entertaining film to begin with.</P>
<P>Rowan Atkinson stars as Mr. Bean, the title character whose British
television series has been acclaimed by audiences around the world. The
premise to the show is simple: a slow-witted, almost mute man wanders around,
oblivious to world around him, and in the process creates for zany comedy.
What makes the show so good is the fact this simple concept makes for some of
the funniest comedy without becoming too lowbrow. It was really just a matter
of time before this was applied to a feature film and this is the net result.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, where the TV series works, the film fails. Bean's antics
don't work here  because, unlike the cartoony nature of the show, the film
establishes a relatively serious setting, therefore the character doesn't
keep with the atmosphere at all. </P>
<P>Bean is about to be fired from his job as a security guard at a London art
museum, but the head of the board of directors won't let him go (for reasons
not well explained). When a Los Angeles art museum buys their most valued
painting (an American impressionist portrait they've had for years), they
decide to send Bean as their representative as either some kind of obscene
gesture to the Americans, or to show the head of the board what an idiot he
is, or both.</P>
<P>What ensues is a cross between a generic fish-out-of-water comedy, recycled
gags from the show that don't work out of their context, and ideas the show
probably threw away. Example of the first: Bean seeing an armed guard at the
airport and pretending he has a gun. A wild chase scene occurs and when they
tell him to "take out the weapon and place it on the floor," he does this
using his hand in the shape of a gun and is still arrested. Example of the
second: Bean trying to cheer up a sick kid on a plane and ends up popping a
vomit-filled bag over someone's head. Example of the third: Bean making silly
faces and doing a Dirty Harry impersonation for his passport photo. These
might sound funny on paper, but what actually shows up on the screen seems
pretty lame. There's just such a rigid contrast between Bean's eccentricity
and the realistic world around him, the jokes don't mesh will.</P>
<P>The film is virtually without plot, except a sub-plot involving the L.A.
museum's curator, David Langley (MacNicol), who invites Bean to stay with him
even though his wife Alison (Reed) decides to take the kids and leave five
minutes after Bean arrives. In fact, most of the film is MacNicol's, as the
story revolves around his character's attempt to make sure the unveiling of
the painting and the accompanying ceremony go smoothly. </P>
<P>Of course Bean is a klutz and an idiot and ends up ruining the priceless
work of art. The scenes depicting this and showing his attempts to fix it are
set up through cliches and unbelievable plot devices. Bean's appeal lies in
his stupidity, therefore the scenes of him going to great lengths to restore
the painting seem all wrong. Some funny things do happen in the process, but
not nearly enough to make up for the mediocre screenplay.</P>
<P>But it is the last act that really kills the film. It plays like one of
those "serious" episodes of a sit-com, and what's worse is it's done in
questionable taste. Once again, Bean is mistaken for a doctor and somehow
ends up in a few scenes that seem very serious, but look like poor parodies
of "ER." The ending itself should be a ripping satire, but is just another
fish-out-of-water gag.</P>
<P>It's disappointing "Bean" is the empty comedy it is. This is just another
case of a good premise ruined by commercialism.</P>
