<P>   In the movie adapted from Oscar Wilde's play "An Ideal
Husband," one character states in typical Wildean prose,
"God punishes us by answering our prayers."  This is
another way of saying, "Don't wish too hard for something:
you may get it."  But what about the converse?  Let's say
that something, or somebody, is about the last thing you'd
want?  You'd be surprised how often your life would be
turned around for the better if you got it.  "Big Daddy" is
an object lesson.</P>
<P>   Adam Sandler's latest comedy is sure to be a big,
sentimental hit with his extensive fan club but not so prized
by more mature film lovers.  Sandler's character performs
in the role of a 30-year-old lazy, single guy whose girl
friend is about to split in disgust over the man's languor. 
Would you imagine that someone with a law degree who
can't get up the energy to work more than one day a week
as a toll collector would want to adopt a 5-year-old kid? 
But ironies are the lifeblood of filmed fantasies.  Surely the
plot won't be spoiled for you if you have advance
knowledge that boy and new dad will bond, the little one
turning the caretaker's life around while the kid will learn
lots of cute new ways to survive in the urban jungle.</P>
<P>   "Big Daddy" is a big-hearted sentimental comedy that
might make you wonder whether you'd really want to be
brought up for a single month by a hang-loose dude like
Sonny Koufax (Adam Sandler).  If you were treated by this
likable fellow with a good deal of respect, never yelled at 
or punished in any way, you'd think you were in stepdaddy
heaven.  But think again: what sort of adult would you
become if you learned that it's OK to pee against the wall
when a restaurant won't let you use its bathroom; that it's
cute to train yourself to regurgitate slowly and then draw
the disgorgement back into your throat before it hits the
ground; that there's nothing wrong with breaking into a
man's town house when the resident refuses to give you
candy and to rob him of his watch and CD's; that it's no
big deal to give legal authorities a false name when it suits
your ego?  As Koufax says to his friend, he gives the kids
options instead of ultimata and lets the boy make his own
choices.  Some choices indeed!</P>
<P>   The story opens as Koufax gets a stern lecture from his
girl friend, Vanessa (Kristy Swanson), who is about to
leave him because she is fed up with his lack of ambition. 
Koufax, who has a law degree but refuses to take the bar
because he prefers to be an idler on the $200,000 he won
in a lawsuit, is upset, but his life is about to change.  When
his roommate leaves town on an assignment in China,
Julian (played alternately by twins Cole and Dylan
Sprouse) turn up at his door, a lovable but sad,
monosyllable kid who does not yet know that he is the love
child of the man who shares Sonny's apartment.  Since the
social services office is closed, Sonny takes the kid to
Central Park to teach him how to trip rollerbladers.  When
the lad has to pee and the snooty maitre d' at a posh
restaurant announces a customers' only policy, Sonny
teaches Julian how to use the wall. And when the two
show up late at McDonald's for the breakfast special,
Sonny plays role model once again by picking up a
customer's fries and heaving them to the floor. (In a later
experience, he teaches the kid how to get half-off on food
by throwing the cans to the floor and getting a discount for
the dents.)</P>
<P>   While "Big Daddy" does not have nearly the raunchy
vocabulary of the far more imaginative, even exhilarating
"South Park," Steve Franks--who wrote the story on which
the movie is based--manipulates the audience into thinking
that kidding around about drug-taking and talking
obsessively about your ex-girlfriend's sister's former job at
Hooter's is a hoot and a holler. "Big Daddy" does try to be
political correct in one way--in using two of Sonny's friends
to demonstrate that gay is perfectly OK--but the two
lawyers display their affection is such sloppy and
hackneyed ways that you'd think the whole movie is a
primer on being cool.</P>
<P>   Steve Buscemi makes a fool of himself by ineptly playing
a homeless man as though he were a darling character out
of a Damon Runyon story, and in the movie's coda, Sonny
proceeds to teach his roommate how to be silly enough as
well so that little Julian can love him too.</P>
<P>   Sandler has a better role than he enjoyed in "The
Waterboy"--which is not saying a heck of a lot--but he has
a way to go before reaching the peak he hit in "The
Wedding Singer."  The real scene-stealer of the movie is
not the kid or the stepdaddy, but Joey Lauren Adams (from
"Chasing Amy"), who seems to be the only one who knows
how to act.  "Big Daddy" is directed by Dennis Dugan, who
appears to be well aware of his targeted audience.</P>
