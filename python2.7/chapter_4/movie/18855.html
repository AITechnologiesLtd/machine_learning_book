<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Disney's annual summer animation extravaganza begins promisingly –
there's no annoying Mickey Mouse cartoon and about ten minutes of
fantastic-looking action with no dialogue or song.  But it can't keep up
the pace and it fails to generate the laughs that adults have enjoyed in
Disney's past two summer hits, Mulan and Hercules.</P>
<P>Don't get me wrong – it's certainly not a bad film.  Disney and
screenwriter Tab Murphy (The Hunchback of Notre Dame) do an admirable
job of adapting the classic Edgar Rice Burroughs novel.  The script
pulls no punches and might actually be a bit jarring and melancholy for
the youngsters.  And old-timers beware - this ain't your father's
Tarzan.  The loin-clothed wonder not only swings from vines, but also
surfs down tree trunks like those bastard kids that rollerblade down the
handrails in front of the post office.</P>
<P>The infant Tarzan (voiced by Alex D. Linz, Home Alone 3) and his parents
land on a deserted island after narrowly escaping death on a flaming
ship.  They quickly build a remarkable treehouse (a la Swiss Family
Robinson) and seem fairly content spending their lives in their remote
surroundings.  But one day, a bloodthirsty leopard slays both parents,
leaving the tot to be discovered by Kala (Glenn Close, 101 Dalmatians),
a gorilla that ironically lost her only child to the same deadly feline.</P>
<P>When Kala brings the human child home to the tight-knit gorilla
community, she is met with great resistance – especially from her
husband and primate leader, Kerchak (Lance Henriksen, Millenium).  The
boy grows up feeling like an outcast, but is able to befriend a
similarly aged gorilla named Terk (annoyingly voiced by nasally K-Mart
pitch-person and media whore Rosie O'Donnell) and a bumbling elephant,
Tantor (Wayne Knight, Seinfeld's Newman).</P>
<P>Years later, an older and more chiseled Tarzan (Tony Goldwyn, Kiss the
Girls) turns everything around when he saves Kerchak's life after the
savage leopard attacks the patriarchal figure.  In an instant, Tarzan
becomes a man, unknowingly avenges the death of his birth parents, wins
the affection of Kerchak and develops his trademark yell.  But the
excitement doesn't stop there.  Almost immediately after dispatching the
deadly leopard, the jungle is jolted by the sound of gunfire.  There are
visitors on the island!</P>
<P>Of course, the visitors include Jane (Minnie Driver, An Ideal Husband),
the girl who would be Mrs. Tarzan.  Almost instantly, she strays from
her three-party group – father Porter (Nigel Hawthorne, The Winslow Boy)
and trigger-happy bad guy Clayton (Brian Blessed, Boss Nass in Episode
One) – and quickly finds herself being chased by a bunch of angry
baboons.  Tarzan saves her and realizes that Jane is more like him than
his monkey brethren.</P>
<P>Having not been trained in human social skills, Tarzan shocks Jane by
first mimicking her and then violating her `personal boundaries' by
looking up her dress and jamming his head between her perky Disney
breasts.  Needless to say, the two hit it off and Tarzan even considers
leaving the island to return home with Jane.  If she had simply put out,
he probably would have gone with her, leaving the film with a completely
different ending.</P>
<P>Tarzan was directed by Chris Buck (his debut) and Kevin Lima (A Goofy
Movie) and features new music from former Genesis frontman Phil
Collins.  His songs replace the big, flashy musical numbers that usually
plague Disney ‘toons, leaving precious little time to develop any
semblance of a story.  But that isn't the case here – the absence of
singing characters is welcomed in any film.  (1:30 – Rated G, but
contains some seriously depressing and violent scenes)</P>
