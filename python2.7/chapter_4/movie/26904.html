<P>Three things you should know about Bammer, before we get started:
    -Generally, remixes grind my gizzard.
    -Jim Carrey and his extremely-over-the-top clowning gets on
     my *last* nerve.
    -Dr. Seuss was one of the first heroes I had; hell, he
     Spoke For The Trees before treehuggers were even thought of!
     Mess with him, and somebody's Feelings are gonna get hurt.</P>
<P>So, I probably loathed Jim Carrey's remix of Dr. Seuss' cartoon, "How
The Grinch Stole Christmas", right?  Maybe.  Maybe not.</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
He's a Mean One: Mr. Grinch.</P>
<P>In this updated version of the classic tale by Dr. Seuss, The Grinch
(Jim Carrey) has Issues.  He doesn't like all the noise that his
Whoville neighbors 'round the way make - especially the Christmasy noise
they make.  The Grinch, frankly, doesn't like Christmas.</P>
<P>The concept of which astonishes young Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Mumsen) -
though she's having Issues of her own over the commercialization of
Christmas.  Cindy sees her father, Lou Lou-Who (Bill Irwin) buying up
Christmas stuff left and right, her mother, Betty Lou Who (Molly
Shannon) in fierce Christmas light-stringing competition with Martha May
Who-vier (Christine Baranski), and the Maywho of Whoville (Jeffrey
Tambor) discriminating against the Misunderstood Grinch because the
Maywho's beloved Martha once had a Thing for Grinchybaby, and Cindy is
left to wonder just what Christmas is about.</P>
<P>The Grinch has no doubts, though: for him, Christmas is about being
tortured by the Whos, a practice that started when he was yet a wee
Grinch (Josh Ryan Evans).  But this year will be different; this year,
The Grinch and his dog, Max, will stop Christmas for good...</P>
<P>The Upshot:
Quite a few things about THE GRINCH were exactly as I thought, and even
hoped, they would be: director Ron Howard obviously put a lot of love
and care into this project; certainly, he and his production team put a
lot of moolah into set design and costumes.  I also imagined narrator
Anthony Hopkins sonorous voice would pick up where the original cartoon
"Grinch" narrator - Boris Karloff - left off.  Hope against hope, the
key song - "You're A Mean One, Mr. Grinch" - was updated just enough to
be jazzy, but still remained true to the original (ok, I'll admit it: I
liked Carrey's version even *more* than the original song.  Who knew he
could actually sing?).  Overall, my hopes that this production would
remain true to Seuss' Whoville, weren't shattered.</P>
<P>It's where they veered off of Seuss' beaten path, that rankled me.
That, and Jim Carrey being allowed off-leash without a pooper scooper to
clean up behind him.</P>
<P>For the life of me, I couldn't figure out why they decided to explain
Why The Grinch, Grinched.  Some stuff just *is*; let it be, I say -
especially if you're gonna explain it like this flick did.  Needless to
say, my eyes rolled.  Also, I like my Whos unspoiled by Y2K
sensibilities; it twisted my liver that the Maywho was allowed to be
Evil, and sneakily so.  Totally ruined the "everybody comes out for
Christmas any old way" theme for me.</P>
<P>And - can I just say this? - if I never see Taylor Mumsen in another
movie again, it'll be too soon.  Her saccharine-coated Cindy Lou Who
reminded me of the mouse in STUART LITTLE.  And, oooh, I *hated* the
mouse in STUART LITTLE.  Yes, I realize that Cindy Lou is probably
charming the socks off America right now, but I just feel sticky after
being dunked in all that Sweetness And Light.  Ya know what?  I didn't
*care* why she was Conflicted about What Christmas Really Meant.  I just
wanted her gone, gone, *gone*!</P>
<P>Uh...sorry if I got any on ya.  Lest ye think I didn't really like the
movie, ye would be right for those thirty or so minutes that Carrey went
hog-wild without any sense of direction.  And it showed; many of his
shticky bits should've been edited out, no matter how Wacky or Inspired
his antics seemed.  There were far too times when Carrey just went manic
onscreen, but no one in the packed audience went along with him.  But
there were enough good bits of his to generally balance the movie out;
though there were some questionable scenes that I didn't feel were
appropriate for the child-skewed audience [is there a clause that Carrey
puts in his movie contracts that states he must, at some point, crack a
butt-joke?], it's clearly the younger set that will eat this movie up,
and will probably demand an update of the remake.</P>
<P>The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:</P>
<PRE>Black "Whos".</PRE>
<P>I'm sure it can't be easy being a Hollywood Filmmaker; they can be boxed
into a damned if you do/damned if you don't corner: if they sprinkle a
few Blacks (and since We're still the Default Minority, it'll probably
remain "a few *Blacks*") in their productions, some folks will scream
"TOKENISM!!!".  But if they *don't* include Blacks, the scream becomes
"WHERE THE BLACK FOLKS AT?".  I don't envy Howard et al their decision,
and maybe the result should just be seen as the "Grinch" Powers That Be
having taken the high road.</P>
<P>But still: Black "Whos", for me, was about as weird a sight as, say,
Black Vulcans.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
I'll make about the safest prediction a non-prognosticator ever made:
based on the huge crowds I saw here in Podunkville this weekend, THE
GRINCH will be a monster hit the likes we haven't seen in awhile.  And I
won't begrudge them that: for folks who weren't weaned on the
originator, the duplicator will do just fine.  Really, it wasn't all
that bad, and in some spots (most notably when The Grinch found out he
was nominated for an award), Carrey Wrecked Stuff! (quick Blactionary
definition: "In a few noteworthy scenes, Carrey was amazing!").  Still,
I think I'll stick with the original for now - and maybe when "Grinch"
comes on DVD, I might fast-forward through Cindy Lou's
saccharine-coating and Jim Carrey's fatty hamming.</P>
<P>THE GRINCH (rating: flashing yellowlight):
Just call me Mrs. Grinch...</P>
