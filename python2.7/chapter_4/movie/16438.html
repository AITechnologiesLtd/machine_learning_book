<PRE>The Wedding Singer</PRE>
<P>It's just your basic romantic comedy. It's also an eighties film (so if you
hated the eighties …) On the overall the film is all right, not too good,
not too bad. But, watching in dejected calm, staring as the screen threatens
epilepsy at 24 frames per second, I realize that this is so much the same
movie I had seen time and time again in my life. One out of a hundred within
the past sixteen years. Yet somehow I keep going back. Mindlessly, numbly
heading into the movie theater to see yet another movie, not entirely sure
of the title yet certain as to an inevitable memory of the details.</P>
<PRE>Oh, well.</PRE>
<P>As far as this one goes, it tries to take off of the success of last years
very offbeat dark romantic action comedy, Grosse Point Blank, another 80's
movie about a hitman who has become dissatisfied with his professional life
and returns to his high school reunion to try to rekindle an old flame
(remember the tag line : Even a Hitman Deserves a Second Chance). Not that
it [Wedding Singer] is in any way a sick comedy or nearly as good, but it
still serves as a romantic comedy. You sympathize with the characters (like
you sympathize with the people on "Friends"), you like the sweet romances,
you know the ending as you go into the movie. Sure, it serves up well for
jokes but, as was once the focus of a Seinfeld episode …</P>
<PRE>Yada, yada, yada…</PRE>
