<P>First, I'd like to say it's nice to have Spike Lee vindicate himself after
doing something like GIRL 6. GET ON THE BUS is easily the best film he has
made since DO THE RIGHT THING with the exception of maybe MALCOLM X. Spike
does in this film what he does best--he presents issues that face society
in an unbiased manner and lets the audience sort their feelings on their
own. I love a film that engages my mind.</P>
<P>The story is about a busload of black men that board in South Central Los
Angeles and drive across the country to The Million Man March in
Washington D.C. The film was funded by fifteen African-American men and
shot in just 18 days. This is another example of expert filmmaking
(writing, directing, acting) that I hope the Oscars do not overlook.  The
screenwriter, Reggie Rock Bythewood is very talented.  However, I would
say that the screenplay is a little weak in a few spots.  This may be due
to the film's hurried production. But I tell you that nothing in the
script is so bad as to detract from the better scenes. The greatest aspect
of the screenplay is that the ideas behind The Million Man March and the
reasons for going are expressed without directly involving the march
itself. This makes those ideas much more powerful because it eliminates
the inclusion of Minister Farrakhan, to which many would disregard the
march's message in favor of claiming it racist and sexist. This idea is
also expressed in another way. There is a member of The Nation of Islam on
the bus who never says a word and never gets involved in any of the
scenes. His presence is a symbol of the march, in that, even though The
Nation of Islam was there and organized the march, the march was not about
The Nation of Islam.</P>
<P>Spike Lee is one of the best filmmakers working today. In GET ON THE BUS,
he's trying something different--the sure sign of a filmmaker that
understands that the learning process never stops. Here, he meshes his
ever-evolving style with that of a documentarian's eye. The bus ride feels
"captured" by the filmmaker. Although there is plenty of hand-held
camerawork, it is as though Spike Lee was able to film a documentary and
still maintain effective use of dollies, cranes and tripods. It is an
astonishing feat from a filmmaker's perspective and an effective technique
for anyone watching.</P>
<P>As I watched the film, I noticed two things about the audience. The first
was that anytime a character made a slant toward one of the homosexual
characters, the audience laughed hysterically. The scenes were obviously
written to be funny, but I think that the predictability of our own
stereotypes was what the screenwriter was knowingly commenting on. I back
this up with another scene where the bus stops at a roadside diner in
Tennessee. The instant we see all the white faces inside, the audience
expects a confrontation.  In fact, everyone gets along pretty well. Even
when Ossie Davis explains that steer wrestling was invented by a black
cowboy, his listener responds with, "How about that."  It's fairly obvious
that these two scenes say more about the audience than the characters. But
then, that's what I expect from a Spike Lee joint.</P>
<PRE>It's great to have you back, Spike! </PRE>
