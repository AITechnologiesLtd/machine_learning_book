<P>[I am posting five reviews of STAR TREK VI.  I could easily swamp the group
with reviews of this movie, so I will probably not post any more unless
they say something very different than those posted here (e.g., a review
of the fashions in STAR TREK VI :-) ).  Followups are directed to
rec.arts.startrek to keep the discussion in the appropriate group.

<PRE>                   STAR TREK VI: THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY
                       A film review by Mark Santora
                        Copyright 1991 Mark Santora</PRE>
<P>     Okay, so the last(?) Star Trek film has opened.  Well to start off 
with something like, it's better than TREK V would be kind of be like
saying TREK II was better than I.  Anyway, it opens, and  deserves to
open big.</P>
<P>     We start approximately three years after TREK V, or at least three
years since Sulu took over command of the Excelsior.  Anyway, a Klingon
moon explodes and this sets the stage for the Klingons coming to the
Federation for help, and peace.  Then Spock volunteers the Enterprise
and Kirk to go to meet the Klingons.  However, when the Klingon ship is
attacked, Kirk is blamed.  Bones and Kirk beam over to help the wounded
and are accused of killing the Klingon Diplomat.</P>
<P>     Plot-wise, the story moves quickly in TREK VI.  This I give credit
to the wise mind of Nicholas Meyer.  Meyer has had his hand in the two
biggest successes in the TREK movie series (II and IV).  His direction
is obviously geared toward the intensity of the scenes.  He also manages
to capture a little of the claustrophobic feel that space and the
Enterprise has.</P>
<P>     The sets, even the redressed Next Generation ones, are quite good.
There is one I must take issue with, however.  The design of the 
Klingon "Hoth" planet prison.  I found it very human.  It lacked any of
the feel that would be associated with the Klingon Empire that we have
seen before.  I would also like to take this time to make point with
the fact that I found the time spent on the planet too short.  It in
fact just managed to get by.  There was not a lot of time associating
it to any real prison.</P>
<P>     Michael Dorn in TREK VI is wasted.  He is on the screen for a 
matter of minutes.  It is not that his character was bad.  It was just
that all of the sudden he was there.  There is no background for WHY he
is there.  I guess it was left on the cutting room floor.</P>
<P>     The special effects, which I took heavy issue with in TREK V, are
top-notch ILM effects.  There are the standard effects, including a
great one of the Enterprise getting whipped by a photon torpedo.  But
there are also some great shots when some imitation Federation Marines
go around killing Klingons and their floating blood, which by the way is
computer-generated.</P>
<P>     The Music: No film review would be complete without a quick listen
to the music.  Anyway, the music by Cliff Eidelman is very good.  It
takes off in a new direction from the previous scores by Jerry
Goldsmith, James Horner, and Leonard Rosenman.  Remember that it was
Meyer who brought on Horner who composed, I believe, my favorite music
from the STAR TREK series (II and III).  My only problem with the score
for TREK VI, was the fact that the traditional fanfare that is *always*
before the opening of the films was curiously absent.  The score would
have been greatly enhanced by the use of it.</P>
<P>     Overall, I find STAR TREK VI: THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY to be
a worthy of the fandom that Star Trek has created over the years.
While I find it to be lacking sometimes, all films do.  This is 
not the best of the series--see STAR TREK II for that--this
is high up there.  And to paraphrase one of my favorite quotes
from another Trek film, "...they'll never be gone, as long as
we remember them."</P>
