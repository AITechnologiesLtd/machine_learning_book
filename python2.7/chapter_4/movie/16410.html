<P>Saving Private Ryan (1998) 4 stars out of 4</P>
<P> Saving Private Ryan is a brilliant, savage piece of filmmaking, a soaring
paean to the courage of man - as individual and as family.</P>
<P> And director Steven Spielberg, with the aid of cinematographer Janusz
Kaminski and film editor Michael Kahn, has created the most intense,
riveting 30 minutes of combat footage in the history of cinema.</P>
<P> Silence, except for the fluttering of a pale, ghostlike flag, greets you
at the outset of this marvelous movie. The prologue follows a World War II
veteran as he shuffles through the allied cemetery at Omaha Beach in
Normandy.</P>
<P> The movie then flashes back to D-Day, June 6, 1944. And here the
audience's senses and emotions are bombarded with the sights and sounds of
war.</P>
<P> A chaotic choreography of carnage is what Spielberg and his team have
thrown at us. Kaminski's hand-held camera darts through the death and
destruction, capturing moments of terror, confusion, fright and most of all
blood.</P>
<P> It's everywhere. Death comes unexpectedly, swiftly, randomly. Spielberg
spares none of the horror that was D-Day.</P>
<P> The documentary-style footage will make you wince and perhaps turn away.
These battle scenes are stomach-churning in their realism. And the film's
main story has not yet begun.</P>
<P> As the GIs earn a toehold on the beach and methodically begin decimating
the German bunkers, Kaminski's camera slowly pans back down the beach,
lingering on a dead GI named Ryan.</P>
<P> It is that image that propels the plotline of Saving Private Ryan. The
dead Ryan was one of three brothers killed.</P>
<P> A fourth brother, a paratrooper who was dropped into France the night
before the invasion, is believed to still be alive somewhere behind enemy
lines.</P>
<P> The big brass in Washington, with equal parts of mercy and attempts to
avoid a PR disaster, order that this fourth brother, James Francis Ryan, be
found and returned stateside.</P>
<P> Ranger Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks), who survived the D-Day invasion with
only a few of his men, draws the assignment of finding this needle in a
very huge haystack.</P>
<P> Spielberg deftly establishes the moral dilemma faced by Miller and his
squad. Why is this Ryan so special? Why does his right to go home outweigh
anyone else's? How does finding him aid the war effort? Is it worth risking
and possibly sacrificing the lives of others just to find one man?</P>
<P> As the film progresses, these questions are answered.</P>
<P> Saving Private Ryan is not your gung-ho, John Wayne-Randolph Scott war
movie. These GIs' main focus is not defeating the enemy so much as staying
alive and returning home. If finding Ryan will achieve that goal quicker,
then so be it.</P>
<P> The men in Miller's squad do what GIs have done since the beginning of
warfare. They gripe, second-guess their superiors and insult each other.
Yet, when thrown into battle, they are a unit, protecting their
brother-in-arms.</P>
<P> Hanks gives a sterling performance as Miller. He is low-key, a bit
mysterious (his squad has created a continually growing pool trying to
guess what the captain does in civilian life) and very much frightened.</P>
<P> Despite his fears - his hand continually shakes - and his doubts about
their mission, Miller leads his men on, at times either cajoling, bullying
or sweet-talking them forward. Hanks ably embodies the Everyman-ordinary of
warfare. He is no professional soldier.</P>
<P> Miller and his men eventually find Ryan, portrayed by Matt Damon as a
sturdy and willful young soldier.</P>
<P> Among the other cast members, Tom Sizemore is wise, tough and
compassionate as Sgt. Horvath, Miller's second-in-command. Jeremy Davies as
Cpl. Upham, the translator drafted by Miller to leave the safe confines of
the now-secure beach and possibly come face-to-face with the enemy,
represents us, the audience. He is constantly scared, recoiling at every
sound, avoiding combat at any cost.</P>
<P> Saving Private Ryan is a magnificent achievement. It shows Spielberg as a
more mature filmmaker, a man willing to gamble. How else do you explain why
he uses what could be the grand finale of any other film as the opening
gambit to cast the audience into the story and its characters?</P>
<P> This is not a movie for the squeamish. Spielberg refuses to compromise.
Death is not pretty. With an unblinking eye, the director shows the misery,
the horror, the tragedy and the human toll of war.</P>
<P> But the movie's magic is that, while it does not glorify war, it glorifies
its reluctant warriors, not because they are heroic, but because they
trudge on and do their duty, overcoming their fears and own instincts for
survival.</P>
<P> Saving Private Ryan is an unrelenting, emotional experience that deserves
its "R" rating. Yet it's a movie that young adults should see with their
grandfathers who served in World War II to better comprehend and understand
their sacrifices.</P>
<P> In Act IV, Scene III of Henry V, Shakespeare had King Henry deliver a
speech to rouse his troops. Part of it went like this:</P>
<P> He that outlives this day and comes safe home
 Will stand a-tiptoe when this day is named ...
 And gentlemen ... now abed
 Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,
 And hold their manhoods cheap ...</P>
<P> There is no comparison between the battle of Agincourt and the beaches of
Normandy. But that special bond that is forged and exists between men who
have walked through the gates of hell and returned, must be timeless and
universal.</P>
<P> And that is the majesty and power of Saving Private Ryan, for it has
captured that camaraderie and shown it to us in all its horrifying
brutality and spiritual splendor.</P>
