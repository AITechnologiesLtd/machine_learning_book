<PRE>                               BABY'S DAY OUT
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Joe Mantegna, Lara Flynn Boyle, Joe Pantoliano, Brian
Haley, Adam & Jacob Worton.
Screenplay:  John Hughes.
Director:  Patrick Read Johnson.</P>
<P>     Just as a little role playing exercise, pretend you're John
Hughes.  The HOME ALONE films have grossed somewhere in the
neighborhood of a gazillion dollars, and you're not convinced that
particular cow has been fully milked.  Unfortunately, Macaulay Culkin
has crossed the line from adorable moppet to gawky adolescent, and last
year's variation on the theme, DENNIS THE MENACE, didn't do well enough
to warrant a sequel.  So what do you do?  Apparently, you write and
produce BABY'S DAY OUT, yet another kiddie-pleaser featuring copious
cartoon mayhem directed at bad guys.  Strangely, though, there is a
modicum of originality present, thanks to imaginative visual effects
and the charmed wanderings of Baby Bink.</P>
<P>     Baby Bink (twins Adam & Jacob Worton) is the 9-month-old son of
the wealthy Cotwells (Lara Flynn Boyle, Matthew Glave), self-
absorbed socialites whose primary concern is getting Bink's picture
in the paper.  To that end they hire a photographer, but the three
men (Joe Mantegna, Joe Pantoliano and Brian Haley) who show up at
the Cotwell mansion have other plans for Bink ... plans that include a
$5 million ransom.  Of course, getting the ransom requires actually
having the baby, and when Bink slips out through a window to explore
New York, the three hapless kidnappers find themselves perpetually
chasing down the little tyke, and racking up a growing injury count in
the process.</P>
<P>     For anyone who has seen either HOME ALONE or its carbon copy
sequel, there is very little new to be found in BABY'S DAY OUT.  Joe
Pesci has been replaced by Joe Mantegna, and Daniel Stern has been
split into Joe Pantoliano and comic Brian Haley.  Mantegna appears
embarrassed much of the time, making his slow burn look like a plea for
sympathy from the audience.  The scenes of the three villains being
thwarted in their attempts to re-acquire Bink are a parade of Wile E.
Coyote routines, most recognizably a shot of Haley dropping from a
great height to produce a small plume of dust; director Patrick Read
Johnson at times seems to cop more liberally from Chuck Jones than from
John Hughes.  Still, there are only so many ways that the male
genitalia can be mangled before intense boredom sets in.  I heard gales
of laughter from kids in my audience at such mid-section humor, but I
think they would have responded the same to a 90 minute loop of kicks
to the groin.</P>
<P>     What is most annoying about films like BABY'S DAY OUT is that they
pretend to have an emotional message.  In one scene, Lara Flynn Boyle
tearfully acknowledges her misplaced priorities when the kidnapped Bink
does appear in the paper, and later comforts Bink's distraught nanny by
admitting that the nanny is probably more of a mother to Bink than
herself.  But BABY'S DAY OUT is no more about good parenting than SPEED
is about traffic safety.  Hughes and Johnson make no attempt to follow
up these token gestures with any closure; it's just typical Hughesian
troweled-on emotion to make the violence more palatable.</P>
<P>     If there is one reason for anyone of driving age to sit through
BABY'S DAY OUT, it is to see the clever special effects which allow
Bink to survive every adventure with nary a smudge of dirt to tell the
tale.  One sequence finds him crawling across a busy street as cars
whiz by in every lane but the one he happens to be in.  Later, he makes
his way through a construction site in Rube Goldberg fashion, sitting
blissfully as tractors roll over him and sliding down girders onto
moving elevators.  These are fun moments, made all the more appealing
by the adorable Wortons as Bink.</P>
<P>     Naturally, Hughes ends BABY'S DAY OUT with a teaser for a sequel.
But enough is enough, John.  The Wortons are probably two by now; that
doesn't mean you can squeeze four more films out of them.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 babies:  4.</PRE>
