<P>     Auntie Em!  Auntie Em!  The summer-movie season has officially blown 
into town with TWISTER, the first must-see movie of the year.  Though
both underwritten and lacking the momentum of his last film, SPEED,
director Jan De Bont's take on Oklahoma storm chasing still impresses
with some of the most spectacular special effects ever seen on screen.
Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) has blended the authentic with the
computer-generated to create a series a storms the likes of which
Dorothy and Toto never saw.  You'll marvel at the dark, swirling clouds
of debris and other matter-- flying cows and tractors and houses, oh my!
A tanker-truck that drops out of the sky is a sight, though my favorite
is the splintering screen of a doomed drive-in that's showing THE
SHINING.  The FX also get better as they go.  De Bont wisely rations the
thrills, saving the best for last.  (I could've done without the
continuity gaffes, though.  Just how *does* a red truck stay shiny after
riding through a storm?)</P>
<P>     The effects are great, but the script is a *mess*.  Blame Michael
Crichton, Anne-Marie Martin, and a host of script doctors for, oh,
predictable plotting, dumb drama, and characters as corny as Kansas in
August.  The non-star cast does what they can with the material.  Helen
Hunt and Bill Paxton, playing soon-to-be-divorced scientists, are very
sincere shouting lines like "Come on!", "There's no time!", and "Take
cover!" (Did the MST3K gang also do a rewrite?)  Other cast members
include Cary Elwes as a rival storm chaser, Philip Seymour Hoffman as a
tie-dyed metalhead who is particularly fond of the meteorological-by-
way-of-MTV term "Suck Zone", and Jamie Gertz as Paxton's character's
fiancee.  (Ms. Gertz plays a "reproductive therapist," if you can
believe it.  She's there to scream, ask questions, and provide comic
relief.  That is, until she predictably can't take it anymore.)</P>
<P>     There's a lot going on in this movie and, unfortunately, very
little of it makes (focused) sense.  The central character motivation is
a geeky combination of science and thrill-seeking; these guys love to
take risks because they love to study storms.  De Bont attempts to
inject other elements into the film, but they don't work as written.
For example, we could do without the tragic fate of Hunt's character's
aunt.  She exists to reinforce the Very Noble goal of better weather
predicting, by showing that tornadoes often cause huge amounts of damage
and injury and often without warning.  No duh.  The sequence is a
melodramatic cheap shot and doesn't belong here.  Not in a movie that's
just out for thrills.  In fact, the "back stories" are all pretty bad,
but like most storm chasers-- or, if you prefer, most summer-movie
audiences-- we're in for the ride.  We certainly expect more than a few
lulls before we get to see a TWISTER.</P>
<P>     Finally, something should be said about the shameless inclusion of
pop songs on the soundtrack.  They're played too prominently in the
background, intruding for no other seeming reason than to sell something
else for Time-Warner.  The mix of musical genres and styles is often
distracting and certainly doesn't blend with the other accompaniment, a
windy orchestral score from composer Mark Mancina.  (The score is also a
bit much, I must say.  Must movie music be so overblown?  Is James
Horner teaching classes in this stuff?)  The exception is a short
sequence that combines Rainbow, Rossini, and Rogers and Hammerstein; it
happens early the film and is one of the few places on the soundtrack
that doesn't feel prepackaged.</P>
