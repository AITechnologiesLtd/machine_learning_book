<P>     In the opening scene of DUETS, director Bruce Paltrow establishes
with little room for doubt that we have fled reality for its hideous
cinematic doppleganger. In that scene, a weathered-looking fellow in
horn-rims named Ricky Dean sits in a karaoke bar, taunting the hot-shot
kid who has just wowed 'em from the stage. Ricky feigns ignorance about
"karateoke," then bets the kid that he can win the competition out from
under him. Of course the bet proves to be a hustle, but the problem is the
casting. As Ricky dazzles the crowd with his rendition of Joe Cocker's
"Feeling Alright," we're left with the baffling realization that Ricky is
played by Huey Lewis. The kid's jaw drops, the patrons shriek, women throw
themselves at him ... not for the Voice of God, but for the competent,
breathy chops of Huey Lewis. This isn't the Eddie Felson of the karaoke
set we're talking about; it's not even the Eddie Money of the karaoke
set. It's Huey. Freaking. Lewis.</P>
<P>     For the next 108 minutes or so, DUETS leaps from that implausible
scenario to scenarios even less plausible, turning it into a character
study in which inhabitants of the planet earth are nowhere to be found.
Essentially it's a road picture, switching back and forth between three
less-than-dynamic duos converging on a big karaoke contest in Omaha. The
aforementioned Ricky is on his way, with a tag-along named Liv (Gwyneth
Paltrow) who happens to be the daughter he's never met before. Brassy Suzi
Loomis (Maria Bello) also has designs on the prize, and a reluctant
chauffeur in recently-cuckolded cab driver Billy (Scott Speedman). And
Todd Woods (Paul Giamatti), a career salesman having a mid-life crisis,
has also become a born again karaokist, accompanied by a career convict
named Reggie (Andre Braugher) he picked up hitchhiking.</P>
<P>     DUETS is one of those "When Bad Movies Happen to Good Actors" 
experiences that makes you wonder whether anyone involved actually read
the script before committing. It's particularly sad watching Giamatti and
Braugher do the buddy bonding thing with such shallow characters. Giamatti
makes for such a wonderfully manic schlub that he's entertaining to watch
in spite of the material; Braugher has presence, but he can't bring any
depth to a character that's ultimately supposed to be tragic. Paltrow does
a nice ditzy bit, but that's the one note her character is allowed. In
fact, that's true of every character in the film. Bello, Speedman, Lewis
and company are all playing characters with one note, one epiphany and one
grinning resolution. These aren't performances; they're cries for help.</P>
<P>     Paltrow the elder offers none, and goes one better by actually making
matters worse. A talented television director with little feature film
experience, Paltrow puts his film together in such a disjointed manner
that even well-constructed characters would have been hard-pressed to
emerge intact. Close-ups become medium shots for a couple of seconds for
no apparent reason before returning to close-ups; ostensibly comic scenes
linger and dawdle with no punch. Paltrow does have the paternal generosity
and good sense to let the gifted cinematographer Paul Sarossy shoot
Gwyneth lovingly. There's no pacing, no momentum and no point.</P>
<P>     There is, however, plenty of karaoke. DUETS seems constructed with
the desperate hope that viewers will be entertained enough by the
musical numbers -- lifted heavily from the pop music glory years of the
late '70s and early '80s -- that they'll ignore the complete absence of
personality in anyone singing them. For the record, Gwyneth Paltrow has a
sultry, insinuating voice, and does justice to both "Bette Davis Eyes" and
Smokey Robinson's "Cruisin';" also for the record, there is no need for
cross-cutting between a police action and plus-size comic John Pinette's
rendition of "Copacabana." Unfortunately, that's fairly typical of the
skewed world served up in DUETS. If you loved Huey as the pride of every
karaoke joint, you'll love the police leaving an armed man alone for a
final tender moment. In this paper-thin road film, reality is the road not 
taken.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 lip stinks:  3.</PRE>
