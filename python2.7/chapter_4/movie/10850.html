<P>Hello. My name is Jamie, and I'm a Spiceaholic. Well, not really. Let's 
just say I'm a casual fan of the Spice Girls; I know they're not too deep 
or challenging, but their British bubblegum bounce is good enough to keep 
me on the stairmaster for a long while. (And, a definite plus, group 
members Geri "Ginger Spice" Halliwell, Emma "Baby Spice" Bunton, Melanie 
"Sporty Spice" Chisholm, Victoria "Posh Spice" Adams and Melanie "Scary 
Spice" Brown are all easy on the eyes.) I fearlessly admit that I'm 
familiar with their music, and now I'm familiar with "Spice World," their 
feature film debut, as well. A kind of hybrid between "A Hard Day's 
Night," "Clueless" and the "Naked Gun" movies, "Spice World" isn't quite 
tasty, nor does it leave you with a bad case of indigestion. It's alright, 
but I'd probably rather be on the stairmaster listening to them than sit 
through their movie again. </P>
<P>There isn't much of a story here, as "Spice World" is basically a series 
of interchangeable, scattershot skits and spoofs stuck between some 
adequately spirited musical numbers. The movie is framed around a hectic 
couple of days for the girls, as they ready themselves for a big concert 
in England. Along the way, there are dozens of potential comedic 
catastrophes -- a documentarian (Alan Cumming) trails the group endlessly, 
a pregnant pal (Naoko Mori) prepares to give birth and sleazy tabloid 
types conspire the end of the Spice Girls for good, all while a 
mysterious, T.J. Eckelberg-like figure (Roger Moore) watches from above. 
And of course Posh, Baby, Scary, Ginger and Sporty are in just about every 
scene, talking about clothes, guys and "girl power" whenever they aren't 
singing. </P>
<P>Perhaps the big question mark here is regarding the Spice Girls' acting 
capabilities, but I'm not too sure of the answer. They're not thespians 
(hey, neither were the Beatles), but they boast a perky, self-depreciating 
buoyance that's sort of difficult to deny. The rest of the cast is nice 
enough to acknowledge that this isn't their show, with George Wendt and 
Mark McKinney getting the best bits as American filmmakers on a quest to 
convince the quintet to make their American movie debut. Meatloaf seems to 
be cast as their tour driver simply so he can make groan-inducing 
allusions to his album playlists, while weird Richard E. Grant ("Bram 
Stoker's Dracula"), as the Spice Girls' manager, is decked out in so many 
emerald suits he looks like a refugee from Oz. And those familiar with the 
British entertainment scene will note sometimes-clever, sometimes-not 
cameos by the likes of Bob Geldof, Stephen Fry, Bob Hoskins and Jennifer 
Saunders. </P>
<P>The fundamental problem with "Spice World" is an even hit-or-miss gag 
ratio. For every moment that scores (a hilarious faux-movie trailer for an 
action flick called "Spice Force Five"), there's one that comes close to 
embarrassment (the ladies' impromptu performance of their hit "Wannabe" in 
a coffee shop-flashback). The best sequences arguably come whenever the 
Spice Girls are holed up inside their tour bus, which is modeled after the 
British flag. They poke the most fun at themselves here; watch each's 
reaction when one whines that the media has a tendency to stereotype them 
too often. Around the 45-minute mark, things seem to screech to a halt, 
certainly not helped by a dwindling sense of humor (what's up with that 
goofy labor scene?) or stuff that's just too stupid to work (what's up 
with that dopey alien encounter?). At least the film is capped-off nicely 
with a vibrant live rendition of their current tune "Spice Up Your Life." </P>
<P>"Spice World" definitely isn't going to win any of the gals' detractors 
over, and it isn't likely to sway those who are neutral one way or the 
other. Those seeking a message or any kind of social relevance had better 
look elsewhere; the closest "Spice World" comes to either of those is a 
sequence that illustrates the dangers of driving a bomb-equipped bus in 
stiletto heels. It's an hour-and-a-half of brainless comedy and music, 
starring five pleasant-looking pop divas who don't seem to fear 
self-parody. And that's presumably all that die-hard Spice fans really, 
really want. </P>
