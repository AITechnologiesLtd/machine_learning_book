LITTLE VOICE     1998
Reviewed by Pierce Dalton
2 1/2 stars (out of 4)</PRE>
<P> Little Voice is a dramedy about the rise, and fast fall, of LV (Little Voice),
a painfully shy girl who rarely speaks, but mostly imitates her favorite
musicians, notably Judy Garland.</P>
<P> A small, UK feature, Little Voice is a mostly enjoyable film, with a grand
cast, including the mighty Brenda Blethyn, who's performance in 1996's Secrets
& Lies was phenomenal.</P>
<P> She plays, basically, the same role in this movie:  a druken, chain-smoking
fool who is very distant from her daughter.</P>
<P> Jane Horrocks plays LV.  She is most notable for Bubble on the BBC's fab show
Absolutely Fabulous.  In Little Voice, she is also good.</P>
<P> Ewan McGregor and Michael Cain round out the top cast.</P>
<P> The basic plot is Cain "discovering" LV and trying to make her a star.</P>
<P> But, the real reason to see this film is Blethyn and Cain.  They both feature
remarkable performances, especially Cain, who, in the film's last reel, has a
show-stopping scene in which he drukenly sings about his career.</P>
<P> Little Voice could have used that extra zing, but, as an acting feature, it is
a masterpiece.</P>
