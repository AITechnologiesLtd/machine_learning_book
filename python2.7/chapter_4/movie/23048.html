<P>I'm assuming that anyone who has read this far is familiar with the
series, so I'll keep the plot description to a minimum. Set mostly in
Hollywood, "Scream 3" continues the movie-within-a-movie conceit, as
production of "Stab 3" comes screeching to a halt when a killer, dressed
in the familiar ghost mask and black cowl, appears on the scene. In
short order, all of our old favorite characters, along with a host of
new ones, are scrambling to stay alive and unmask Ghost Face once and
for all.</P>
<P>The character dynamics have significantly changed along the way. Where
central target Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) was once the focal point
of the action, she now plays second banana to Deputy Dewey Riley and
cutthroat TV tabloid reporter Gale Weathers, played by the recently
married David Arquette and Courteney Cox Arquette. Although "Scream 2"
ended with Dewey and Gale as honey-bunnies, this storyline has the
couple estranged again, thereby allowing the Tom and Roseanne of the
21st century to bicker a lot before their relationship heats up again.</P>
<P>While Dewey and Gale play junior detective on the "Stab 3" set, Sidney
is holed up far, far away in a high-security mountain cabin, counseling
abused women via a series of high-security phone lines. When she learns
of Ghost Face's Tinseltown Tour 2000, she leaves her sanctuary and
reluctantly heads for Los Angeles (incidentally, reluctantly is the only
way anyone should ever head for Los Angeles).</P>
<P>Fine. The veterans are in place, newcomers are running around all over
the set and the killer is slashing away. So what are we dealing with
here? Kevin Williamson, who became white hot thanks to his dandy script
for the original "Scream," was too busy to write the finale (he
reportedly was trying to salvage his wretched TV series, the aptly named
"Wasteland"), leaving flavor-of-the-month Ehren Kruger ("Arlington
Road," "Reindeer Games") to fill in, with mixed results.</P>
<P>One of the high points is his pairing of Gale Weathers with Jennifer
Jolie (Parker Posey), the actress playing Gale in "Stab 3." The
combination of a hyperactive, manipulative reporter and a ditzy starlet
determined to copy her every move is inspired, and Posey is a riot. The
only thing that hampers their scenes is the alarming physical appearance
of Courteney Cox Arquette. With her increasingly gaunt features (please,
somebody feed this woman!) and godawful Cleopatra-with-hacked-bangs
hairdo, she looks scarier than Ghost Face.</P>
<P>While going lighter on the pop culture references than Williamson,
Kruger does get in some good ones. In addition to the pointed
one-liners, check the closing credits for the character names of the
"Stab 3" players, which can be taken as a nod, or a swipe, at a gaggle
of popular young actors.</P>
<P>Director Wes Craven has some fine moments as well. His composition work
is exceptional, particularly in a haunting shot where Sidney emerges
from a studio hallway and the camera slowly pulls away as she finds
herself on a movie set recreating a street scene straight out of her
personal nightmares. Throughout the film, Craven uses lights and darks
masterfully, and his positioning of music to heighten tension is far
more effective than in most films of the genre.</P>
<P>Had he only paid as much attention to the script. In climatic scenes,
Sidney, Dewey and Gale abandon the very survival rules their characters
supposedly learned in the first two films. Even more damaging to "Scream
3" is the simple passage of time. Since the series burst on the scene in
1996, other artists have upped the humor-meets-horror ante. On any given
week, shows like the outstanding "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" mix chills
and giggles as adroitly as anything in "Scream," while creating
characters with considerably more substance. Regardless, though "Scream
3" represents a franchise running on fumes, there's still enough gas in
this old buggy for a moderately entertaining final ride.</P>
