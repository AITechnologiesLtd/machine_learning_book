<PRE>MAN ON THE MOON</PRE>
<PRE> Reviewed by Harvey Karten, Ph.D.
 Universal Pictures
 Director:  Milos Forman
 Writer:  Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski
 Cast: Jim Carrey, Danny DeVito, Courtney Love, Paul
Giamatti, Jerry Lawler</PRE>
<P>   Jim Carrey impersonates Andy Kaufman so deftly that the
performance artist--who died of lung cancer in 1984--comes
alive in all his weirdness. That Kaufman was strange,
maverick, a performer who listened to the beat of his own
drummer, is never challenged.  Instead "Man On the Moon,"
an extraordinary vehicle for the actor in the lead role, shows
Andy Kaufman as neither a misunderstood person nor an out-
and-out looney tunes.  What comes across by the time the
two-hour entertainment ends is that Kaufman, who insisted
that he was not a comic and did not even know what being
funny meant, was intent on getting a reaction from the
audience.  We've all heard of entertainers who bore the pants
off the audience; who are neither funny nor tragic,
mesmerizing nor amusing.  Andy Kaufman probably knew
that the worst thing a person can be in real life or on the
stage is b-o-r-i-n-g, to evoke no reaction.  What mattered to
him, then, was to get a reaction, even if the effect he had on
his crowd was one of loathing, resistance, and disgust. 
Perhaps no other man in recent entertainment history pushed
the envelope more in that regard or was so intent on being
an original that he actually loved getting booed and hearing
shouts of abhorrence as much as he adored the approving
roar of the crowd.</P>
<P>   You wouldn't know this from the opening scene. If an
award were given for the most ingenious start of a picture,
that would be for "Man On the Moon," hands down.  To show
us that Kaufman wanted to keep the audience off-guard,
never knowing when he was serious or when he was messing
with our minds, Carrey appears on stage with a old,
table-model phonograph, rolls his eyes to the left, to the right,
up and down, and says nothing for a while as the credits roll. 
When the credits stop rolling mid-way as the record ends, he
starts the music from the beginning and the credits roll once
more.  He then announces that the movie is over and
disappears, making this what could have been the shortest
full-length film of the year.  Seconds later, he re-appears to
explain himself. </P>
<P>   That's about the last time we really do understand the
method behind the madness, however, since Carrey never
resolves the question we all have in mind throughout the
performance.  We really do not know the extent of Kaufman's 
emotional stability.  After all, he did plenty of things during his
pursuit of performance art to alienate the crowd, a practice
which conventional psychotherapists would call neurotic
behavior indeed.  What person intent on a career in show
business would have the temerity to turn down a leading role
on a popular TV sitcom, "Taxi," which Kaufman's agent,
George Shapiro (Danny DeVito) won for him?  Was he truly a
man of principles who detested the very idea of sitcoms with
"dumb jokes and a dead audience," or was this guy simply
being self-destructive?  And how could a person so soft-
spoken, one who comes across as so shy that he appears to
be stage-struck, impersonate a no-talent singer like the
fictitious Tony Clifton?  "Clifton"'s night-club act demolished
the people in the lounge unlucky enough to be singled out for
his devastating commentary and made others simply squirm
with uneasiness, probably eager to crawl under the table.  </P>
<P>   Director Milos Forman, whose "The People vs. Larry Flynt"
similarly deals with a man outside the bounds of respectable
society (who made us wonder whether the title character was
simply a scuzz or a person involved in upholding First
Amendment freedoms), takes a chronological approach to
Kaufman's life.  Working with a script penned by Scott
Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, Forman takes us from
Kaufman's early night club acts, where he wows the
audience with a spot-on impersonation of Elvis Presley, to his
being scouted by hotshot Hollywood agent George Shapiro. 
He appears on Saturday Night Live where he has a chance to
become a regular but later, in a straw vote of people calling
a 900 number, is voted out by a margin of 72% to 28% 
Attaining a whopping five-year contract with the TV sitcom
"Taxi" starring Judd Hirsch, he plays Latka Gravas, an
Estonian with a heavy accent and, inciting the women in one
live audience with the most outrageously sexist comments,
he winds up challenging the females to wrestle with him to
prove once again that men are the superior sex.  This gets
him a girl friend in Lynn Marguiles (Courtney Love), who
takes up the challenge and loses.  All the while Kaufman's
greatest supporter is his writing partner, Bob Zmuda (Paul
Giamatti)--who writes into an ABC special that is
characteristically Dadaist and makes people squirm.</P>
<P>   The movie cleverly pastes in some actual scenes from
"Taxi" with Carrey playing the Kaufman role next to the actual
stars including Judd Hirsch, Marilu Henner, Carol Kane and
Christopher Lloyd and features an interview between
Kaufman and a former wrestling opponent, Jerry Lawler
(playing himself throughout) on an actual David Letterman
show.</P>
<P>   As a biopic "Man on the Moon" goes further than the more-
or-less factual study of the association between Gilbert and
Sullivan, "Topsy-Turvy."  Using actual resurrected scenes to
cement its authenticity, "Man on the Moon" is an amazing,
frenzied, even deranged experience that will doubtless re-
create a posthumous fan club for Kaufman, whose death from
lung cancer is graphically re-created, including his trip to an
alternative treatment clinic in the Philippines.  Like the boy
who cried wolf, Kaufman has a difficult time convincing even
his own family and girl friend that he actually has the fatal
disease: some believe that even the doctor who points out
Kaufman's x-rays is a Hollywood actor and that the playful
performer is again toying with everyone's head.  To Jim
Carrey's credit, he presents Kaufman the way he really was--
a largely bizarre person who at the very least made a lot of
people uncomfortable with his antics, and yet by Carrey's
charisma, he makes us love the guy, foibles and all.  Now,
that's acting.  And this is quite the original film.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 119 minutes.  (C) 1999
