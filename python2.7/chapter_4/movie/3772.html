<PRE>                              THREE COLORS: BLUE
                       A film review by Bryant Frazer
                        Copyright 1995 Bryant Frazer</PRE>
<P>     It's hard to defend the artiness of BLUE.  With a Kieslowski movie
(maybe with all Kieslowski movies), either you get it or you don't.  If
you get it, you're a fan.  The movie becomes a mystical, dream-like
experience.  You recall the most indulgent camera angles and close-ups
at the oddest moments of your day.  Perhaps you hum a few bars of
Zbigniew Preisner's formidable score as you drink your coffee in the
morning, or you have a nightmare about the kind of car crash that sets
this story in motion.  And when a friend doesn't appreciate the film --
in fact, they think it's a dull, pretentious throwback to the French
New Wave or somesuch -- you find yourself speechless.  It's hard to use
words to explain the cinema's moments of great beauty, and you may as
well give up before you begin.</P>
<P>     THREE COLORS: BLUE is the first film in Polish director
Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy built around the precious themes of
liberty, equality, and fraternity (the second and third films are WHITE
and RED, respectively).  The concepts correspond to the three colors of
the French flag, and the conceit is actually less a stricture than a
simple excuse for Kieslowski to make a set of movies that meditate on
love, loss, and our essential humanity.  Liberty is personified in the
newly-widowed Julie (Binoche), who survives the automobile accident
that kills her husband Patrice (a famous composer) and daughter Anna.
This sea change in her life drives her to divorce herself from familiar
people and surroundings, but she's dogged by an unwelcome artifact from
her husband's life.  His unfinished composition, Song for the
Unification of Europe, is the subject of intense interest, and although
Julie disposes of Patrice's notes for the piece (and tries to dispose
of all her own memories), it continues to insinuate itself into her
life until she confronts the music as well as her own devastated
psyche.</P>
<P>     It sounds very color-by-numbers, but the film is actually
anything but.  Kieslowski is a bold filmmaker, with a knack for
hypnotizing an audience.  As much as Kieslowski's THE DOUBLE LIFE OF
VERONIQUE seemed concerned with lenses, this one dwells on reflections
-- Julie's face reflected on the curve of a spoon, a doctor's face
reflected in the iris of her eye, filling the screen.  The richness of
imagery occasionally rivals that of a novel (Julie touches a sugar cube
to coffee; as we watch, the sugar turns the luminous color of her own
skin).  And Kieslowski works at capturing the essence of memory and the
passage of time.  At four moments during the film, the screen fades
completely and music swells - Patrice's unfinished piece - and then the
music cuts, and the scene fades back in at exactly the moment where it
faded out.  It's part of the mystery of the film that a viewer can have
an immediate and intuitive grasp on such an abstract device.</P>
<P>     Intuition, indeed, is the driving force behind Kieslowski's
films.  The relationships and imagery are drawn so intricately that the
pictures reward repeated viewing, and it's only on the second or third
time around that the whole power of one of these films really becomes
apparent.  It's easy to belittle a film like this, with its languid
pace, elliptical dialog, and propensity for introspection
(navel-gazing?).  Don't these somber sequences substitute a content New
Age-ism for any real statements in response to the questions they
pose?  Isn't Kieslowski living in a blithe, egocentric dream world? How
can we be expected to identify with the rich widow of a French composer
as she mourns her way through Paris?</P>
<P>     Yet through Binoche's performance and Kieslowski's guidance, we
do identify.  We feel Julie's aloneness even as we understand her
resolve to cast off her sentiment and distance herself from the
inexorable sadness.  At the end of BLUE, as Preisner's music swells up
on the soundtrack, all of the disparate characters and situations that
make up Julie's story finally come together.  Pictures recall pictures
as Julie is finally reflected in the eyes of another, and the delicate
shape of another character is traced on a video monitor, echoed in
shades of blue.  These final moments articulate character and
contradictory emotion in one crystalline, irrefutable passage of
images, absolutely wordless -- the very definition of great cinema.  If
you're asking the same questions as our director, the simple clarity of
such images provides answers enough.</P>
