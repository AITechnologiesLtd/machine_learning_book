<P>   I'd like a dollar for every time a colleague of mine in the
high-school drug counseling enterprise told me, "This druggie
kid asked me what I could possibly know about addiction:
'Did you ever smoke or take horse'?" Of course the teachers,
whether they inhaled or not, had to be like candidate Bush
and deny having taken any illegal substance during the past
25 years.  Result: who'd trust these advisers?  After all, it
takes one to know one, and truth to tell, lots of people in the
drug counseling business outside the school system are
reformed addicts themselves.  Their experience gives them
credibility.  Who, then, could better advise a police
department about the criminal transport of drugs and about
the art and science of burglary than one who is himself a
thief?  This is the motif of Martin Lawrence's latest vehicle,
"Blue Streak," which deals with a career burglar, Miles Logan
(Martin Lawrence), who must impersonate a police detective
in order to find a huge diamond that he stole two years back.</P>
<P>   The thirty-four-year old Lawrence, who treads on much the
same territory of Eddie Murphy, made his movie rep in '95 in
a movie with a similar hook, Michael Bay's "Bad Boys."  An
action film situated in Miami, "Bad Boys" dealt with two cops
who are forced to switch roles after they're mistaken for each
other during a drug-murder case.  A blockbuster hit despite
its being nothing more than a padded sitcom, this was a
perfect role for the guy who starred in a Fox TV sitcom,
"Martin," who was featured on HBO's Def Comedy Jam, and
who gets roars from his target audience for his slam-dunk, in-
your-face acting.  Few others can draw chuckles and guffaws
by exposing one side of his teeth, or opening one eye real
large or landing an edgy smirk on the camera during his
many close-ups.  "Blue Streak," loaded with fast-paced, car-
chase scenes, is no model of subtle or especially witty
dialogue but Lawrence brings in the howls whenever he pulls
off one of his many impersonations, his body language
substituting for cosmopolitan colloquy.</P>
<P>   Starting off with a surprisingly bloody (for a comedy) action
sequence which sees one villainously selfish criminal kill a
colleague at point-blank range to increase his own share, the
movie focuses on Miles Logan as the head of a jewel heist
gone awry.  Miles pockets a valuable diamond and, on the
verge of being arrested, tapes it to a wall in a heating duct. 
Emerging from jail two years later, he discovers to his horror
that the duct is part of a police station in the LAPD.  Needing
access to the building which is under heavy security, Miles
tries to enter disguised (much like Kit Ramsey's brother in
"BOWFINGER") as a delivery man with protruding teeth, bad
hair and thick glasses.  Foiled, he is mistaken for a new
transfer, a detective with an astonishing resume, and given
dangerous assignments as head of the burglary division with
wide latitude to shake up the department.  Each task paves
the way for Lawrence's nonpareil mugging as he fakes his
way time and again despite his commission of small errors. 
When getting into a car with his new partner, for example, he
automatically takes the back seat, moving forward only when
told "you can ride up front."  Behind the lectern, he is asked
by his fellow cops whether he intends to keep the P31
weapon or switch to the P40.  He cleverly turns the query
around like an LAPD version of Dudley Moore (who once
faked his way in a similar fashion as a man impersonating a
doctor) by asking the crew, "What do you think?"  </P>
<P>   Miles' first-hand knowledge of crime makes his star rise
with the LA police, who wonder whether he is actually from
Internal Affairs, an FBI plant, or a Navy seal.  "Blue Streak" is
as light an actioner as you can get, even in the summertime,
a frolicsome film that's destined to bring in a fun-seeking teen
audience.</P>
