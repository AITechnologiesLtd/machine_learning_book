<P>I just can't do it.  I just can't rubber stamp Jerry Maguire as a perfect
romance/sports movie, let sleeping dogs lie, and recant the bash that I
first wrote of it back when it was released.  I'd like to say that I want to
recant and am being stopped by higher journalistic ethics, but that's not
really it.  I just didn't like Jerry Maguire, and can't honestly send anyone
to a film that compromises its own integrity so many times while claiming to
be about integrity, ethics, ideals, and romance.</P>
<P>Jerry Maguire concerns (!you guessed it!) Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise), a
sports agent who makes Arliss Michaels look like a two-bit hack.  Maguire,
faced with a kid who curses at him, decides to write a mission statement
that states `fewer clients, less money.'  When reality hits, he is fired for
writing this statement (before you think of the conglomerate agency he works
for as evil, remember that he is advocating something directly against
business ethics… he is basically kamakazing himself), Jerry makes the sudden
switch back into money-grubbing sports agent.  Of course, a very public
nervous breakdown that caused the mission statement kind of gets in the way
of getting as many clients, so he's left with just two.  And, when one of
these clients drops him due to double talk by another agent, he's left with
linebacker Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr) as his only income, no money, and a
single-mother employee Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellwegger) to support.</P>
<P>>From here on in, the film is about as clear-cut as they come.  Rod triumphs,
Jerry triumphs, Dorothy triumphs and we're left listening to `shelter from
the storm' as the end credits roll.  But how does everyone triumph?  By
directly recanting on every moral stance they've taken, becoming the
money-grabbing schmucks they loathed, and marrying to make medical plans
simpler.  Who are we kidding?  Really?</P>
<P>Yes, Jerry Maguire sweeps you off your feet if your not looking for it,
because Jerry Maguire is inundated with all of those things that sweep
viewers off their feet.  Nice sports scenes, decent sex scenes, memorable
lines, vapid humor, and a soundtrack that you just want to own, but none of
this holds up when placed under even the lightest of scrutiny.  The acting
may be wonderful, but the script is so uncreative and illogical that you
might as well not ever bother.</P>
<P>Then, of course, you consider all of the little pet peeves that can annoy
the hell out of any techhead.  Take the sound mix.  How the hell did an
ex-Rolling Stone editor come out with such a terrible sound mix?  In a
restaurant, when the camera shifts back 5 feet, the sound is almost
completely washed out.  Dorothy, Jerry, and Rod are consistently overlit, so
much so that if this is an artistic technique Crowe is using it to overkill
levels.  What happened with this Cameron Crowe fluke?  Why does this film
exist, and why was it nominated for Best Picture?  Where the hell are
Singles and Almost Famous when you need them?</P>
<P>Yes, some level of Jerry Maguire applies to me.  I'm not a completely
callous critic, immune to all sweet talking movie stars and devoid of a
sense of romance.  Nor am I a football-hating intellectual.  But does this
film complete me?  I don't think so.</P>
