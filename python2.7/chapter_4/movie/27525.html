<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>It's sometimes said that today's society -- especially in North America 
-- is lacking a modern mythology. We have no counterpart to the Greek 
myths of two thousand years ago, the Norse sagas of the first millennium, 
or the Arthurian legends of the Middle Ages. But this really isn't true; 
we have developed our own mythology, but not one populated by gods and 
demons and magicians. Instead, it is made up of actors like Marilyn 
Monroe, singers like Elvis Presley, Prime Ministers like Pierre Trudeau... 
and Presidents, like John F Kennedy.</P>
<P>Few figures in recent history have accumulated such a body of folklore as
the thirty-fifth president of the United States. Much of this is derived 
from the mystery surrounding his assassination, of course, but it extends 
back further than that, to the various crises which highlighted JFK's term 
of office, his rumored romantic liaisons, and so on. And the mythology 
encompasses the rest of his family too, from his brother Robert to his
son, John Junior.</P>
<P>If John F Kennedy is a figure of modern mythology, then "Thirteen Days"
stands as one of the legends which make up his myth, an "Odyssey" to his
Ulysses. Like any good legend, of course, it is a fictionalised version of
the true events. But, although the screenplay by David Self plays fast and
loose with real history, it does so in a manner which avoids overt
sensationalism. "Thirteen Days" effectively portrays the tension and
paranoia of the time -- the feeling that one wrong decision could mean not
only the end of free society, but human civilisation itself.</P>
<P>"Thirteen Days" chronicles the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962.
During routine aerial surveillance of Castro-controlled Cuba, the American
military captures photographic evidence of Russian nuclear missile
emplacements on the island -- contrary to the Soviet promise that they
would not equip communist Cuba with offensive weaponry. Aware that the
combination of short- and medium-range missiles threaten the integrity of
much of the continental United States, a special committee of top White
House and military brass is quickly formed to map out strategy.</P>
<P>Leading these sessions are President Kennedy (played here by Bruce 
Greenwood, looking not very much like the real JFK but successfully
channelling his fire and sagacity) and Attorney General Robert Kennedy
(Steven Culp, looking very much indeed like the real Bobby). They're
assisted by their boyhood friend Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner). The
Kennedys quickly find themselves under pressure (especially from the Joint
Chiefs of Staff) to abandon any efforts at a diplomatic solution and
undertake a full-scale military deterrent. JFK is well aware that such a
maneuver carries with it the very real risk of nuclear war -- but with
just days left to go before the weapons in Cuba become operational, and
even more Russian ships steaming toward the island, time to find an
alternative is quickly running out.</P>
<P>Under the careful direction of Roger Donaldson ("Dante's Peak"), "Thirteen
Days" perfectly evokes the atmosphere of October 1962; it is difficult not
to feel transported back to the turbulent Cold War era. The film has
received some criticism for playing up the antagonism between the
administration -- particularly the Kennedys, O'Donnell and Secretary of
Defense Robert McNamara (Dylan Baker) -- and the military brass over
appropriate tactics. There is a persistent implication running throughout
the movie that the Joint Chiefs are trying to bully the President and have
their own way in the Crisis: "this is a setup," intones O'Donnell.</P>
<P>But even if such scheming and dissension did not really occur behind the
scenes, their place in this film is not unwarranted. Because certainly,
even if the politicos were in accord, the general population was not --
the United States was a seething mass of opposing viewpoints. Just as many
people wished to avoid the possibility of war at all costs, there was
also a sizeable number who wanted to duke it out with the Reds at the
nearest opportunity. "Thirteen Days", then, transposes this mix of popular
opinion onto the nation's leaders, and is thereby able to bring such
conflict to the fore.</P>
<P>That said, the picture does not neglect the common man either. Indeed,
that's basically the role that O'Donnell is supposed to play. In real
life, he was a minor figure in the Crisis, a footnote in the historical
annals. In "Thirteen Days", he is used as the audience's point of view on
the proceedings, a man who has very little direct involvement in the
political maneuverings but who is nonetheless in a position to watch the
situation unfold from beginning to end. Donaldson's most successful use of
O'Donnell comes when he sends him out onto the streets of Washington
midway through the crisis, to see firsthand how the country is reacting to
the Crisis.</P>
<P>But unfortunately, O'Donnell's effectiveness in "Thirteen Days" is at best
mixed. While he has his uses, there are times when he feels more like 
extra baggage -- hanging around in the background of scenes and tagging
along after the Kennedys like a groupie in suit and tie. To make matters
worse, Costner is burdened with a laughable New England accent that
recalls his similarly ludicrous effort in "Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves".
It is not impossible to see beyond this and recognise that Costner
delivers a solid performance as O'Donnell -- consider, for example, a
well-acted scene in which he tries to persuade an Air Force captain to
betray convention and hide certain facts from his superiors for the
national good. But in order to work well, O'Donnell needs to be an almost
invisible presence in the film, and Costner's casting makes this virtually
impossible.</P>
<P>Still, "Thirteen Days" is a potent film which does an excellent job of
taking well-documented historical fact and turning it into a 
suspense-filled drama. Donaldson rarely falters, and the cast approaches
the material with perfect conviction. I wasn't alive during the Cuban
Missile Crisis -- but now I almost feel like I was there.</P>
