<P>JERRY MAGUIRE: Why is it that in every Tom Cruise movie of late, he has
to show the entire range of his acting abilities?  Going from primal
rage to a sensitive 90's man in under 120 minutes seems to be his
specialty.  Leaving that aside, I found the movie rather disjointed.  It
had a jerky start & stop feel, instead of flowing effortlessly from one
scene to the next.</P>
<P>There was only one good scene which stuck in my mind: Cruise & his wife
were talking about the failure of their marriage and how his weekly
trips have become a "welcome break" from the daily drudgery of polite
conversations which epitomized their relationship.</P>
<P>The worse scene in the movie was when he came back to her, ready to pour
out his heart in front of the bitter old maids club.  Instead, he
rambles on about nothing, and just as he was about to continue, his
teary eyed wife says: "Shut up, you had me from the word Hello."  WHAT
THE %&*@ IS GOING ON HERE????!!!!!  This is completely inconsistent with
her character.  She's been blaming him for lack of intimacy, but just as
he was ready to spill the beans, she effectively says "Nevermind."</P>
<P>There were also numerous annoying & cliched "Hollywood" touches which I
won't bother going into.</P>
<PRE>Rating: a generous 3.</PRE>
<PRE>Rating system:
1 - absolute worse film
2 - poor
3 - average
4 - good
5 - excellent</PRE>
