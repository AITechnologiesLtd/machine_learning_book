<PRE>MOUSE HUNT
Review by Luke Buckmaster (<A HREF="mailto:bucky@alphalink.com.au">bucky@alphalink.com.au</A>)</PRE>
<PRE>>From 0 stars to 5 stars:
4 stars</PRE>
<P>Here's a riddle: what do you get when two slow-witted men attempt to
invade a house manned by a solitary young boy?  The answer, of course,
is Home Alone.  All you need to do now is substitute the "young boy" for
"mouse," and you'll have a fairly good idea of what Mouse Hunt is all
about.</P>
<P>However, their is one major difference that separates the two films from
being distinctly alike: whilst the young lad in Home Alone set traps for
goofy villains, the mouse in Mouse Hunt simply avoids the ones set by
the invading men until they are stupid enough to fall for them
themselves.  This alone proves to be more amusing and much more enticing
than Home Alone's formula, and the same sort of physical comedy is
presented in an artistic and entertaining way that's bound to appeal to
both young and old.</P>
<P>It's the story of two greedy brothers. Ernie Smuntz (Nathan Lane) is a
professional chef who owns a high-class restaurant, and Lars Smuntz (Lee
Evans) works along side his father Rudolf Smuntz (William Hickey) in the
family string factory.  So when Rudolf dies, his string factory and an
apparently abandoned old mansion is left at the brothers' dispense.
They quickly ride off their new assets as worthless, and quickly stumble
into financial crisis.  Eventually, they discover that the old house was
in fact designed by a famous international architect and is worth
millions.  All they need to do to cash in is renovate the house.
There's just one problem: there's a mouse in the house.</P>
<P>Yes, this problem is more than laughable - but in no time Ernie and Lars
realize how serious the situation is and their money making scheme is
now in jeopardy.  This is when the real fun begins…</P>
<P>Just as is expected from such a film, the two greedy brothers go to
absolute extremes to ensure that they do everything but kill the mouse.
In fact not only do they fail to succeed on all accounts, but they also
make themselves look like money seeking morons; and as their traps get
progressively more outrageous their hatred for this hairy critter grows
and grows.  But of course when they finally get the little rodent in
their hands, killing it seems to be a far too easy option…</P>
<P>It is with a subtle cleverness and ingenious cartoony atmosphere that
unknown director Gore Verbinski has created in Mouse Hunt's zany
characters and their hilarious physical and intellectual comedy.  It's
definitely not your average kid's comedy; and if the advertising
previews are any incentive for you to give this one a miss then I
suggest you ignore them, run to your local cinema and let Mouse Hunt
refresh your idea of what an excellent family film really is.</P>
