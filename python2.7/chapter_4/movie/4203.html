<PRE>                               THE ADDICTION
                       A film review by Bryant Frazer
                        Copyright 1995 Bryant Frazer</PRE>
<PRE>Written By Nicholas St. John
Directed by Abel Ferrara
Starring Lili Taylor, Christopher Walken
U.S.A., 1995</PRE>
<P>     Abel Ferrara is on the record saying that he originally thought
making a vampire movie was "a stupid idea."  Presumably, then, the idea
came from his longtime coconspirator, screenwriter Nicholas St. John.
It's a good decision, because Ferrara is arguably at his best when he's
working within a well-established mythos--taking on the BODY
SNATCHERS in his 1993 remake, for instance, or casting Christopher
Walken in the Al Pacino role, updating and revamping DePalma's SCARFACE
and Coppola's GODFATHER for his own KING OF NEW YORK (1990).</P>
<P>     So with THE ADDICTION, Ferrara sinks his teeth into a moral fable
that equates bloodlust with amorality and postulates that there may,
even now, be salvation for the sinner.  Shadow-slinker Anabella Sciorra
nails star Lili Taylor early on, dragging her into an appropriately
chiaroscuro corner of Greenwich Village and biting her, hard. Taylor,
who plays a philosophy grad student at New York University, acquires
the vampire's thirst for blood and starts stalking the campus, preying
on the victims who are weak enough not to tell her just once, with
feeling:  get away from me.</P>
<P>     The movie progresses more or less as a series of episodes
detailing Taylor's interactions with old friends, professors and other
potential victims, and even other vampires. Before long, she's adopted
the cool black-clad cigs-and-sunglasses attitude of a fashionable
junkie and starts to ruminate weirdly on the Meaning of it All.</P>
<P>     The NYU setting defuses a problem Ferrara movies have been
having with dialogue lately; in this movie, the characters talk like
pretentious philosophy students because that's what they are, and it
makes all the difference when Taylor seduces a sweet young thing at the
movie's midpoint by inviting her upstairs to study Feuerbach. The
movie's wildly literate bent comes to a wacky fruition during a key
scene featuring Walken in a longish cameo.  Discussing the nature of
blood addiction, and giving Taylor metaphysical tips on ways to best
deal with her habit and the attendant immortality, Walken gets animated
and lurches toward her with feeling: "Have you read NAKED LUNCH?"</P>
<P>     Walken's presence is welcome, even though Taylor is quite capable
of handling her part without a helping hand. Ferrara's forte lately has
been coaxing anguished performances from his stars, and the camera here
lingers on Taylor, framing her body dispassionately as it wracks and
convulses, or as she crawls across the floor in the throes of her
addiction. This isn't to say that you should expect a full-frontal
Keitelian assault, but Taylor is excellent, and she provides a
necessary dollop of humanity within Ferrara's big picture.</P>
<P>     Shot entirely in black-and-white, Ferrara's New York is used
here mainly for backdrop and attitude. There's no real sense of
location, but this is the kind of story you'd hardly expect to see
anywhere else. The photography is mostly rich and evocative, but
occasionally heavyhanded.  You wish, for instance, that someone would
reach up and turn on a light during Taylor and Sciorra's first
encounter. It takes a little while for THE ADDICTION to get going, and
the overly mannered dialogue may have your eyelids dropping if you're
up past bedtime.  Fortunately, when the going gets weird, it's weird
enough to make you care where Ferrara and St. John are taking you.</P>
<P>     THE ADDICTION culminates in two major scenes, one of them being
an over-the-top party sequence that recalls the climax of my favorite
Ferrara film, MS. 45. That first scene leads directly into the second,
which is the allegorical climax, complete with a priest and communion
wafers. It'll be no surprise to anyone who's seen BAD LIEUTENANT that
Ferrara is most concerned here with the concepts of sin and redemption,
and while the last moments of THE ADDICTION are a little obscure, he
follows through, perhaps shoring up a new reputation as one of New
York's foremost gloomy optimists.</P>
