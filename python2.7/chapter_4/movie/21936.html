<PRE>In James Bond's Latest Outing, `The World' is Flat
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>The latest installment in one of the most durable
franchises in Hollywood history has been released. 
And by now, either you've seen it or you've already
made up your mind to pass on James Bond's latest
escapade.  If you've decided to pass, you're probably
making the correct choice.  `The World Is Not Enough'
has all of the ingredients that make for a fun Bond
film, but it lacks spark and ingenuity.  </P>
<P>Before I bring out the three major weaknesses of this
film, I do want to say that the Bond formula has
worked again and again for a couple of reasons.  Bond
films are not about character development or an
absorbing story line.  It's about the beautiful women,
the exotic locations, amazing gadgets, sexual humor,
and breathtaking action sequences.  In the beginning
of this film, there is a terrific water chase through
the Thames River that probably ranks as one of the
best beginning sequences among all of the bond films.</P>
<P>This chase occurs because of a bombing that has
occurred within MI6 Headquarters (home of the British
Secret Service).  The victim in the accident is a
wealthy business tycoon who is in the midst of
constructing a new pipeline from Russia to Europe.  It
is vital that this pipeline be completed to help
ensure the West's supply of oil for the coming
millenium.  Now, his daughter, Electra, must take
control to finish the project (Sophie Marceau).  But
there are plenty of people that would like to see this
project fail.  The British Ministry, headed by `M'
(Judi Dench), believes that the person most capable of
carrying out such a plan is the baleful Reynard
(Robert Carlisle), a rogue KGB agent.  In the process
of protecting Electra, Bond meets up with the nubile
Dr. Christmas Jones (Denise Richards).  Why is her
name Christmas?  I think that the only reason is so
that the film can end with one of those silly
double-entendres.  She's a nuclear scientist, and her
importance remains unclear until at some point in the
film a nuclear warhead is stolen.  This is an abrupt
turn of events, but true Bond fans should be able to
stay the course.  Others who are not as devoted will
instead laugh every time Dr. Jones speaks about the
internal workings of a bomb (which is what happened in
my theatre).  She's less convincing as a scientist
than a bed pet for Bond.</P>
<P>Up to this point, I'm only enthused for the first 20
or 30 minutes of the film.  Then the energy of the
film begins to wane.  Why is that?  Here are those
three weaknesses.  1)  There is no wacky, evil
sidekick.  The best spy films have a cool sidekick
like Oddjob, Jaws, or even Mini-Me.  2)  The women are
nothing but pretty pin-up posters.  In the last film,
they were smart to introduce the karate-kicking
Michelle Yeoh.  Here, Denise Richards didn't seem like
a necessary addition to the cast.  Meanwhile, Sophie
Marceau, while adequate, couldn't punch her way out of
a bag.  3)  Brosnan was excellent in the sophisticated
remake, `The Thomas Crown Affair.'  Judi Dench is an
Oscar-winning actress.  Robert Carlisle is a great
actor whose credits include `Trainspotting' and `The
Full Monty.'  Here, they are tremendously
underutilized.</P>
<P>Let's face it.  James Bond is not great detective.  He
lucks his way in and out of situations that gets him
closer to his final encounter.  Guns equipped with
laser sights still manage to miss him and despite his
need to be covert, he always smugly gives out his real
name as Bond, James Bond.  Watching 007's exploits is
a guilty pleasure through and through.  </P>
