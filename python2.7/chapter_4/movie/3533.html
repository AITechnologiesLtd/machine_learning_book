<PRE>                   FROSH: NINE MONTHS IN A FRESHMAN DORM
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1995 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     First, let me clear up a little confusion.  There are now two
movies in release in the US with almost the same names: FRESH and
FROSH.  The movie I saw is a documentary about the lives of a dozen
freshmen in a dorm at Stanford.  It is called FROSH and not FRESH
(which is another of the life in the 'hood shows).  Moreover, FROSH has
the official subtitle of NINE MONTHS IN A FRESHMAN DORM.  Clearly, it
has the unofficial title of Academic Freedom Today--Believe and Say
Anything You Want Provided It Is Official Politically Correct Dogma,
but more on that latter.</P>
<P>     In my opinion, documentaries are one of the highest cinematic art
forms.  They cover a wide spectrum of beliefs from TRIUMPH OF THE WILL
to ROGER AND ME.  The purpose of a documentary is to allow you to
vicariously live in another world, but in the case of a documentary, it
is a real world--full of warts, bad grammar, and bad hair days.  A
documentary, if it is good, will frequently enrage you.  At a minimum,
it should make you think.  Three of my absolute favorite movies I have
ever seen are documentaries: 28 UP, 35 UP, and SHERMAN'S MARCH.  This
documentary, although poorly made and constructed, nevertheless, is a
full fledged descendent of this art form for it did enrage me, and it
certainly made me think.</P>
<P>     The directing, cinematography, and just about everything in the
production of this documentary was done by Daniel Geller and Danya
Goldfine.  As far as the technical merits of the show, it was
amateurish in parts.  The camera was held fairly steady, but only one
camera was used and hence there was too much panning and zooming.  The
colors were hopelessly faded.  They needed a better camera, better
processing or something.  The editing was a little loose and although
scenes had labels, they were pretty arbitrary and overall the
documentary was not well organized and constructed.</P>
<P>     The reason to see this movie has nothing to do with the above
technical aspects.  You want to see it for the content.  In the rest of
the review I will cover some of the high points to give you a flavor.</P>
<P>     It starts and ends with the speech given to the freshmen on their
first day at the school.  They are told always to respect each other's
opinions no matter if it differs from their own and that they will
encounter a wide range of differing opinions while they are at
Stanford.  Based on what was presented in the documentary, the previous
statement was a bold face lie.  We find kids who almost all think
exactly alike, total PC.  Those who have even mildly differing opinions
are put down until they give up and agree with the official norm.  The
parallels with this and the book "1984" are chilling.</P>
<P>     We learn that Aristotle was evil.  He was a "sexist pig" and that
if he was black, they would not have been able to study him.  The males
are constantly put down by the women.  Ditto the whites by the blacks.
Interracial dating is also put down.</P>
<P>     Two people go to church.  We learn in detail from one how sexist
the church is and how she is going to stop going soon.  The other still
believes in God, but he is constantly ridiculed by his peers until he
finally relents and says, Okay, okay, you people are right, what can I
say?</P>
<P>     What do these kids believe in?  Very little.  One says that he has
rejected religion as has everyone he knows, and that he thinks
everyone's philosophy these days is "enjoy yourself and do as little as
possible to hurt others."  The only consistent value they have seems to
be heavy drinking contests, some dope smoking, or lots of hanging
around the dorm arguing what is PC and what isn't.  I should point out
that the term politically correct is never mentioned explicitly in the
movie, but the philosophy is all over the place.</P>
<P>     One girl talks about how certain thoughts and speech "must be
suppressed."  Her friend does muse aloud about who is going to make
that determination.  Reading the constitution, especially the Bill of
Rights, does not appear to be part of the curriculum.</P>
<P>     Studying is not high on the priority list for them.  One girl on a
financial scholarship keeps getting her grades reduced because she
forgets to turn in her homework.  She is also the chief motor mouth in
the dorm.  Walking over and turning in papers are not high on her
personal priority queue.</P>
<P>     On the surface the kids seem bonded to each other, but if you
think about it for a minute you realize that there are almost no scenes
where they do any actions that show they really care for each other.
On the other hand, when they go home for Christmas break and meet their
parents, with the exception of the one religious boy, they seemed
totally unbonded to their parents.</P>
<P>     One girl tells her mom she is switching majors to feminist studies
and will be going to Washington to take a job as a political activist
for minimal pay after college.  Her mom advises she think about her
future and says she knows of "no 52-year-old hippies".  The girl thinks
her mom is terminally stupid for telling her this.</P>
<P>     The movie has no MPAA rating.  For the drug use and the frequent
use of F word, I would assume it would be rated R, but who knows.  I
would take my teenager to see it and discuss it with him or her about
it afterwards.  I rate this a MUST SEE for anyone with kids anywhere
near or at college age.  I recommend it to everyone and give it ***.
It runs a bit too long at 1:33.  Finally, I would love to see a sequel
with the same people in their first real job in life.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
