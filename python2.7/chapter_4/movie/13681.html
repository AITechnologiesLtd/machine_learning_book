<PRE>starring Robert Redford, Kristin Scott-Thomas, Scarlett Johanssen, Sam
Neill
                  screenplay by Richard LaGravenese, based on the book
by Nicholas Evans
                                     directed by Robert Redford</PRE>
<P>After Indecent Proposal and Up Close and Personal, Redford was wise to
direct himself in a picture at last. Redford
may look great on-screen, but over the past few years, he's proven
himself a bigger talent behind the camera.
Ordinary People is one of the best films of the nineteen-eighties, and
it was the first picture he helmed. While The
Milagro Beanfield War was only occasionally successful at combining
magic-realism with...um, realism, and I've
never been much of a fan of A River Runs Through It (to the chagrin of
many), Quiz Show was dazzling, energetic
and convincing. THE HORSE WHISPERER represents both his directorial
return to nature films and the first time
in that sub-genre Redford seems equally concerned with humans and
scenery.</P>
<P>Scott-Thomas plays Annie MacLean, an uptight but respected New York
magazine editor whose daughter Grace
(Johanssen) loses a leg and a good friend when an early morning ride
climaxes with their horses colliding with a
semi. Grace's horse survived, but barely, and has gone mad. Annie
refuses to put the animal out of his misery,
believing that if the horse heals it will mend Grace's newly-broken
spirit. Eventually, mother and daughter travel
alone to Montana to be with Tom Booker (Redford), a famed "horse
whisperer" who has a gift of calming horses
with simple looks and touches, leaving busy husband Neill behind.
Eventually, they move onto the Booker ranch
with the rest of Tom's family, and Annie finds herself falling in love
with all things Montana, including, naturally,
Tom, the wise and lonely trainer.</P>
<P>THE HORSE WHISPERER is delicately made. I dare say lyrical, since to
many people's ear, that word is
synonymous with boring. Hardly. THE HORSE WHISPERER has little to offer
in the way of surprise, but it does
have an honesty that is refreshing and consistently enjoyable to watch,
especially in the final third of the
story. Scott-Thomas and Johanssen seem like mother and daughter, and you
have no doubt believing that the
mountain vistas would put these New Yorkers under a spell, especially
since d.p. Robert Richardson's photography
casts Montana as Heaven on Earth. (A gimmicky but effective technique
the filmmakers employ is a switch in
aspect ratio from squarish to widescreen when the central location
shifts from New York to Montana.) The
underrated Sam Neill turns in perhaps his most heartfelt, emotive
performance as the nice-guy husband, who is as
authoritive and likeable as Tom. He is indeed a refreshing change from
the sexist, lout of a husband so many
writers resort to as a short-cut for explaining away the cheating
spouse's motivation. Unfortunately, one of THE
HORSE WHISPERER's only flaws is the chemistry between would-be lovers
Scott-Thomas and Redford. I liked
both of them, but I didn't necessarily believe that Redford would fall
for such a cold fish, even if the countryside air
thawed her slightly. Luckily (and curiously), this is such a rich and
textured movie that it doesn't quite matter-their adultery
seems like an afterthought, the obligatory sub-plot that ties many of
the characters' complex relationships together.</P>
