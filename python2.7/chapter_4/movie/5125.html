<PRE>                                 THE DOORS
                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  ***1/2  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1991)</PRE>
<P>        After Oliver Stone's hit-you-over-the-head antics in BORN ON THE
FOURTH OF JULY, I was skeptical about THE DOORS, fearing he would ruin
another fertile subject with sledgehammer direction.  To my great delight,
however, I found THE DOORS to be an extraordinary technical and artistic
achievement, from Stone's direction to the cinematography, set design, and
sound editing--not to mention Val Kilmer's mind blowing performance as Jim
Morrison.</P>
<P>        Granted, there are some things the movie does NOT do particularly
well.  For example, it gives Meg Ryan (who plays Morrison's common-law
wife, Pamela Courson) far too little screen time.  Further, Stone is so
obsessed with Morrison that he fails to shine any light on the other Doors
members.  But these deficiencies are inconsequential blemishes on an
otherwise striking canvas.  Stone's recreations of the Doors' concerts are
breathtaking, and he chronicles Morrison's self-destructive descent with a
chilling sense of claustrophobia.  THE DOORS also provides an extremely
vivid sense of the era, perfectly capturing the essence of the late '60s
and early '70s.  The psychedelic, drugged-out point of view makes this a
film for the time capsule.</P>
<P>        In short, all of the qualities that I hated about BORN ON THE
FOURTH OF JULY I admired in THE DOORS.  In this case, Stone's over-the-top
direction is appropriate to the subject matter--even integrated with it.  A
counter example is GREAT BALLS OF FIRE, in which the light comic tone is
completely at odds with the controversial nature of Jerry Lee Lewis' life.
Stone's flamboyant and portentous visual style, on the other hand,
perfectly suits Morrison's excessive personality and his group's foreboding
music.</P>
<P>        If THE DOORS is a stylistic victory for Stone, then it's a
monumental triumph for Val Kilmer.  After playing bubble gum heroes in
forgettable movies, such as TOP SECRET, WILLOW and KILL ME AGAIN, Kilmer
has stepped into the major leagues with his seamless performance as the
Doors' tormented, death-obsessed lead singer.  You forget that it's Kilmer
you're watching; all you see on the screen is Jim Morrison.  Kilmer has
completely transformed his image as an actor; there's nothing lightweight
about him.</P>
<P>        You may also get a kick out of seeing Kyle MacLachlan shed his
clean-cut Dale Cooper persona from "Twin Peaks" to play Ray Manzarek, the
laid back hippy who became the Doors' keyboardist.  And in a priceless
cameo as Andy Warhol, Crispin Glover is not to be missed.</P>
<P>        The icing on the cake is the wall-to-wall soundtrack of classic
Doors songs.  The group's evocative music and Stone's potent visuals
combine to form a wild ride--for your eyes AND ears.</P>
