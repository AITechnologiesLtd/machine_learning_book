<PRE>                        SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION
                       A film review by Jon A. Webb
                        Copyright 1994 Jon A. Webb</PRE>
<P>     The home of a wealthy, culturally sophisticated New York couple is
invaded by a man who says he is Sidney Poitier's son.  They are charmed
by him, their lives entwine with his, and the continuing series of
incidents become dinner party fodder that ultimately changes their
lives.</P>
<P>     This film has two very strong performances, and several more than
adequate ones.  Stockard Channing is great as the rich wife.  She's
witty and interesting and her performance leaves you wanting to know
more about her.</P>
<P>     Will Smith is remarkably impressive as the young man who claims to
be Poitier's son.  His work here is especially impressive because his
most prominent past work was on a television series.  He manages to
stay right on the edge of either portraying a somewhat theatrical but
real person, or a remarkably good pretender -- you can't be sure.</P>
<P>     The direction (by Frank Schepisi) is what carries the film.  Not
all the performances are as great as Stockard's and Smith's, but they
are carefully entwined by someone who has obviously spent a long time
observing people of this class, and who knows exactly how to portray
them, their children, and their lives.</P>
<P>     Performance by Donald Sutherland and Anthony Michael Hall (nice to
see he's grown up now) are more than adequate.  Sutherland has always
annoyed me a little, with his fakery and choice of roles.  Here he is
less annoying than usual, because his air of insincerity fits the role
so well.  Hall is quite compelling as an intense gay MIT undergrad.  I
think this role will finally revive his career.</P>
<P>     The central point of this film is somewhat similar to that in
Kasdan's GRAND CANYON--something about the interconnectedness of all
humanity ("Six Degrees of Separation" refers to the six mutual
acquaintances that one study has said relate any two people in the
world), how small incidents can change lives, and how love can triumph
over all.  It's an interesting theme, hopeful without being
sentimental.  It's intriguing to me that these films are coming out
now, at the beginning of a new political era; are moviemakers
responding to that, or am I simply noticing it more?</P>
