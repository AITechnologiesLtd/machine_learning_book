<PRE>                            NOTHING TO LOSE
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     Sometimes an audience can work against you.  For the press
screening of the comedy NOTHING TO LOSE, the studio and the hosting
radio station had given out more tickets than seats.  And the vast
majority of those fortunate enough to find a place acted like card
carrying members of the Martin Lawrence fan club.  Lawrence, from A
THIN LINE BETWEEN LOVE AND HATE and the HOUSE PARTY series, has a happy
demeanor to go with his fast and sometimes foul mouth.  He's quite a
likable star so I can understand part of his attraction.</P>
<P>     When Lawrence, playing robber Terrence Paul Davidson, said two
words, any two words, the audience went into pandemonium.  Since I
thought the first part was only sporadically funny, I felt strangely
isolated.  As pleased as I was that the audience was having such a
great time, I found the audience's riotous attitude off-putting since I
thought most of the initial gags in the movie only barely worked.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the biggest surprise for me was that writer and director
Steve Oedekerk (ACE VENTURA: WHEN NATURE CALLS) eventually won me over
by sheer audacity.  The broadly written comedy in NOTHING TO LOSE takes
many risks and some of them pay off beautifully.  And then again, some
sink like a stone.</P>
<P>     Tim Robbins, who had many fewer fans at my screening, was much
funnier than Lawrence.  Although most people associate him with his
more serious parts, as in THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, he has a wide
comedic pedigree from the hilarious (BULL DURHAM) to the comedically-
challenged (HOWARD THE DUCK).  In NOTHING TO LOSE he has the delayed
reaction down pat.  After a pregnant pause, he delivers his lines with
great deadpan humor.</P>
<P>     In NOTHING TO LOSE Robbins plays rich advertising executive Nick
Beam, who works out of a palatial suite of offices in Los Angeles.  The
story starts simply but lovingly with him and his wife, Ann (played by
Kelly Preston from CITIZEN RUTH), engaged in make-believe while sitting
on their bed.  She would make up a lie that she was having an affair,
and he would have to try to keep a straight face, and then they would
switch sides.  The chemistry and love between them seems genuine from
the first scene.  They call each other on the phone during their hectic
work schedules just to flirt with all the passion of two new lovers.
In short, a perfect marriage.</P>
<P>     Nick comes home early one day to find his lecherous boss, Philip
Barrow (Michael McKean), whose office contains arguably the funniest
fertility statue ever, having sex with his wife.  Rather than speak up,
Nick slips out the door in a state of utter devastation.  His drives 16
MPH on the freeway and in town oblivious to the world he no longer
cares about.  When Terrence hops in Nick's car to rob him, Nick looks
at him with a vacant stare and declares, "Boy, you picked the wrong
guy, on the wrong day."  Nick starts his sport utility vehicle on a
kamikaze mission.  When he fails at getting them both killed, he heads
for the Arizona desert, turning the robber into a crying hostage.</P>
<P>     Slowly the two leads begin the inevitable bonding process which
culminates with Nick's concocting a scheme to steal money from his
boss's safe as a way to get back at his boss for ruining his life.</P>
<P>     Not content with having Lawrence play a robber, the writer had to
design a Norman Rockwell family for him and let us in on his secret.
The reason he has turned to a life of crime is that people will not
hire him.  Although he has the skills to make it in the computer
industry, people will not give him a chance because he is black and
inexperienced.  We are even shown a stack of rejection letters.  Why
can't a robber in a comedy just be a robber?  (Still, it does make for
one joke that people in the computer field will appreciate.  Terrence
wants to know exactly what kind of computers they have in Nick's
office.  "NT?" Terrence asks.  Looking like someone who has just wasted
their money on the wrong designer shoes, Nick sheepishly replies, "No,
just Windows.")</P>
<P>     Along the way to their big crime, Terrence and Nick run into two
lowlife criminals named Rig (John C. McGinley) and Charlie (Giancarlo
Esposito), whose purpose is to supply a plot device to complicate the
big burglary.</P>
<P>     Of the movie's farcical scenes that work, two stand out.  In one,
Terrence and Nick steal two flashlights from a hardware store and use
the owner as a focus group of one to evaluate the fright factor of
various ways of holding people up.  In another, the guard watching the
boss's office does a late night John Travolta-style dance number that
our two would-be robbers worry will never end.</P>
<P>     NOTHING TO LOSE's name says it all.  Not a great comedy, but one
worth trying.</P>
<P>     NOTHING TO LOSE runs a fast 1:37.  It is rated R for profanity and
sex.  Although we were shocked to see a large part of our audience
under 9 and many under 6, kids under 13 have no business being there.
For teenagers, the show should be fine.  I give the picture thumbs up
and ** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
