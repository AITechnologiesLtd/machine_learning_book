PRIMARY COLORS</PRE>
<PRE>A film by Mike Nichols
Written by Elaine May
Starring: John Travolta, Adrian Lester, Emma Thompson, Billy Bob 
Thornton, Kathy Bates, and Maura Tierney
Rated R</PRE>
<P>    During "Primary Colors", I honestly wondered what this film's impact 
would have been if we had never heard of Monica.  That we did makes 
"Primary Colors" all the more powerful.  Despite major flaws, and holes 
at the end of this modern-day fable, the questions it raises about our 
moral state in politics today are without a doubt powerful and 
important.  The basic question Mike Nichols and Elaine May raise is 
this: what part does morals and character play in choosing our 
President? 
    John Travolta turns in a solid, albeit unspectacular, performance as 
Jack Stanton, a Democratic progressive candidate who has mastered the 
art of the game.  He is an impeccable candidate, with populist positions 
and an ability to inspire.  However, like every other character, he is 
extremely flawed, with serious womanizing problems and troubles in his 
past.  During one of his many campaign stops, he meets Henry Burton 
(Adrian Lester).  Henry is beginning to question the present state of 
affairs, and he wants to be inspired. 
    Henry and Jack are joined by Susan Stanton, the ambitious wife 
played perfectly by Emma Thompson.  They are the three who define this 
story, it is through their eyes that we see this story unfold.  Billy 
Bob Thornton is hysterical as Richard Jemmons, a campaign consultant, 
and Kathy Bates turns in a marvelous performance as Libby Holder, a 
private investigator hired to protect the Stantons from any dirt that 
might come at them.
    The story follows the primary races, as Stanton battles for the 
Democratic nomination.  His main rival is Lawrence Harris, a New England 
senator who is running on an economic platform that is gaining support.  
Stanton has to face all obstacles.  He is running against Harris, the 
press, his vices, and the past.  Early on, we see how Stanton uses lies 
and deceit to conjure up an emotional anecdote that connects with a 
group of voters.  We ask, is this so wrong?  Shouldn't a man appeal to 
his constituents, because he must be able to inspire them, to make them 
believe?  Stanton's beliefs are never in question.  His flaws are 
extreme, especially his womanizing, that which we are introduced to 
early and often. 
    The story follows Stanton and Harris, and is often a raucous comedy 
filled with humor to the extreme.  However, midway through the campaign 
Harris suffers a heart attack.  The man who takes his mantle is Fred 
Picker, a former governor of Florida who runs an idealistic campaign on 
the issues AND on the moral high ground.  He abhors campaign finance 
abuses, therefore, he runs no ads.  He abhors words, so he leads by 
action.  Picker's campaign sets off a deep contrast between he and 
Stanton, whose vices add up tremendously.  Slowly, Henry is forced to 
make difficult decisions regarding his life, the people he loves, and 
the ideals he adheres to. 
    "Primary Colors" isn't a brilliant film.  The beginning is flat-out 
hysterical, but the comedy dies down when the movie becomes more of a 
character drama/study.  It is unevenly paced, too long, and simply 
boring at some parts.  Yet, it is also deeply emotional, it triggers 
responses which generate questions on the system of affairs today.  
"Primary Colors" just might be the most important film of the year 
because of what it shows about ourselves.  It is a mirror to our 
society, displaying our faults as people, and displaying the state of 
affairs in our nation.  It is not about the Presidency.  In the end, it 
is about ourselves.</P>
<P>FINAL: *** out of ****
Flawed, but important and entertaining nonetheless</P>
