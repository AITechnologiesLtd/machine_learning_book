<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>An average Charlie Chan featuring Warner Oland as the Honolulu-based detective.
Rita Hayworth has a bit part as a servant, while Stepin Fetchit plays his usual
stereotyped role--this might be offensive to some. He's called Snowshoes and
believes his ancestors are buried in one of the tombs. Charlie shows up at an
archeological dig in Egypt to investigate why the sponsors of the dig, The
French Archeology Society, haven't received their valuables as arranged and why
these valuables are showing up in the collections of their rivals. Charlie
learns that Professor Arnold (Irving) opened up the Ameti tomb and a King-Tut
curse came with it, as one of his workers, Ali, mysteriously died. </P>
<P>Professor Arnold has been unheard of for a month, and his daughter Carol
(Paterson), her boyfriend Tom Evans (Beck), and his violin playing son Barry
(Eagles) are worried. Carol's uncle, Professor Thurston (Conroy), a business
partner on the dig with Professor Arnold 
doesn't seem concerned, saying that he's probably too busy to communicate. When
Charlie insists on seeing the treasures, he has an x-ray machine look through
the mummy case and discovers Professor Arnold's body with a bullet hole in it
near the heart. He later learns  the cause of death was a blow to the head. </P>
<P>Another partner in the venture is Dr. Racine (Thomas), who took over sponsorship
when the other group pulled out. He now wants to make a profit on that
investment, and Thurston admits selling the items to private collectors so he
could pay Racine; Racine's also the family physician and is treating Carol with
drugs for her nervous condition. There's one other suspect, Edfu Ahmad, a
servant who is fanatical about making sure those who open up a tomb get paid
back with vengeance. </P>
<P>Through his investigation Chan finds the cause of Professor Arnold's death is
that he discovered a secret passage in the tomb leading to a hidden room with
more valuable treasures, and that the killer didn't want anyone else to know
about this room. </P>
<P>There are really only two logical suspects, and the usual traps Charlie sets do
the job in bringing the killer out in the open. This was a lackluster suspense
story, which at times seems more like a horror film; and, the actors didn't
distinguish themselves. But the film gave off some Egyptian charm, those
borrowed from a long list of Hollywood B-movies. But the crime motif was greed
and had nothing to do with any ancient curses. </P>
