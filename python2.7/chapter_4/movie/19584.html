<PRE>Rosemary's Baby (R) ***
Starring Mia Farrow, John Cassavetes
Directed by Roman Polanski
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Reading Entertainment Weekly (also known as "The Bible") I discover that I had
not seen the 10th scariest movie of all time. This caused me to rush to the
video store to rent Rosemary's Baby (Blockbuster actually had a movie over 20
years old!) which can't really be put into a catergory, unless raped mother
conspiracy thriller is a genre. </P>
<P>Rosemary Woodhouse (Farrow) and her husband Guy (Cassavetes) move into an old
apartment building where several people have died of witchcraft over the years.
Guy is an out-of-work actor (Rosemary always answers "What has he been it?"
with "He's been in two plays and has done lots of TV and radio.") he's willing
to do anything to make it big, including summoning the devil.</P>
<P>This he does, turns out almost everyone (including Ruth Gordon who won an
Oscar) in the apartment building is a member of a Satan-loving cult. They
massacre babies and feed their blood and flesh (pleasant) to the devil himself.
Guy gets his big break after Rosemary has a dream that she is raped by the
devil (a dark and disturbing scene) she is to bear his only child.</P>
<P>As the plot unfolds Rosemary is led through countless twists and turns each one
of them more shocking than the next. While I can't say that I enjoyed the
ending, I do commend the director for not ever showing us the child of Satan.
For that, and for the fact that this 136 minute long movie wasn't hard to sit
through, I give it *** stars.</P>
