<P>Calvin:  Dad, how come old photographs are always black and white?  Didn't
they have color film back then?</P>
<P>Calvin's Dad:  Sure they did.  In fact, those old photographs are in
color.  It's just that the world was black and white then.</P>
<PRE>Calvin:  Really?</PRE>
<P>Calvin's Dad:  Yep.  The world didn't turn color until sometime in the
1930's and it was pretty grainy color there for a while.</P>
<P>Calvin:  But then why are old paintings in color?  If the world was black
and white, wouldn't artists have painted it that way?</P>
<P>Calvin's Dad:  Not necesarily.  A lot of great artists were insane.</P>
<P>Calvin:  But... but how could they have painted in color anyway?  Wouldn't
their paints have been shades of gray back then?</P>
<P>Calvin's Dad:  Of course.  But they turned colors like everything else did
in the 30's.</P>

<P>There are only two good things about Pleasantville.  One is that it made me
get my Calvin and Hobbes books out of the closet to find that quote.  The
other is the seamless integration of color and black-and-white images as
the small TV town of Pleasantville metamorphizes into a colored world.
Other than that, there's not much to recommend this awkward puzzler of a
movie about a town that struggles as its population and landscape starts to
take on new hues.</P>
<P>We've seen this technique before, most notably in Schindler's List, where
Steven Spielberg chose to color his black-and-white vision of the Holocaust
by showing us the color of a doomed girl's red dress and the bright flame
of candles.  But Schindler's List had a great story to tell -- the color
was just a device to accent two moving and poignant scenes.  In
Pleasantville, the color changes aren't accents, they're the whole story --
and it's not a story that's emotionally compelling in any way.  (Although
the line between Pleasantvillians and the Nazis turns out to be very
narrow.)</P>
<P>Pleasantville draws from two main sources of inspiration:  time travel and
alternate reality.  In this instance, two modern quarreling teenagers
(Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon) are thrust into the alternate
universe of a 1950's television sitcom.  While this seems like an original
concept (or it must have seemed like an original concept to the studio
bosses who greenlighted it), both strands of this genre have been done
before, with better results.  Back to the Future, a less ambitious but more
entertaining movie, effectively showed the culture shock of a modern
teenager coping with a world without MTV.  Peggy Sue Got Married does an
even better job of cultural juxtaposition.</P>
<P>Pleasantville is able to manage only a few pokes at satire in a setting
that's ripe for it -- even the wretched-beyond-words Last Action Hero and
the listless Truman Show managed to skewer their respective targets
somewhat effectively.  The only cleverness exhibited by the script is in
its references to the segregation rampant in the 50's:  the people who have
transformed from black-and-white to Technicolor are branded as "coloreds"
and forced to sit in the balcony of the courthouse.</P>
<P>The problems of Pleasantville have nothing to do with the cast.  Maguire is
given the lead, and he's effective and touching as the leader of the
"coloreds".  He starts out as an uber-geek, a fanatical devotee of the
Pleasantville reruns on a "Nick at Nite" knockoff.  When he wrestles with
his sister for the remote control on the night of the Pleasantville
marathon, he shouts that he's been waiting a year for this -- and we
believe him, and that's very very sad.  Somehow, he matures emotionally
during his stay in Pleasantville, and it's a treat to see his character
transform into a compassionate and sensitive adult.  But his character is a
mass of paradoxes.  Thrust into his ideal fantasy world, he screams to be
let out, presumably to watch the show some more.  He watches the show
ostensibly to bask in the parental love missing in his dysfunctional
family, but we never see him spending much quality time with his parents.
He wants to preserve the town of Pleasantville, but ends up altering it
forever.  We're never sure what Maguire is thinking, or why he acts the way
he does -- a trait, unfortunately, he shares with his fellow townsfolk.</P>
<P>Witherspoon sparks the sexual revolution in Pleasantville and then all but
disappears.  She looks outstanding in black and white, and she makes angora
sweaters look better than anyone this side of Johnny Depp in Ed Wood.  But
she's given very little to do in the second half of the movie, and the
movie is poorer for it.</P>
<P>The Pleasantville parents are absolutely dead-on in their portrayal.
Veterans William Macy and Joan Allen look like they were born to play their
roles of Mom and Dad.  I would have loved to have seen Macy get a little
bit crazy with the whole family-man thing, the way he did in Fargo, but
instead he settles into befuddlement.  Allen is the spouse who gets to
rebel, but her transformation from prim housewife to town scandal happens
so sharply that it's scarcely credible.
Of the other grownups, Jeff Daniels is wasted as a soda jerk with an odd
learning-disability who learns to paint overnight, while the late great
J.T. Walsh glowers effectively in his last performance.  (Don Knotts makes
the least sense of anyone in the whole movie as the TV repairman who sends
Maguire and Witherspoon on their journey:  if he's a comic genius, then I'm
Pauline Kael.)</P>
<P>Pleasantville reminds me of a film that seems to be its polar opposite:
Alex Proyas's brooding nightmare Dark City.  Both films are well-cast, with
outstanding set designs and cinematography emanating from an overarching
vision.  But neither of them has a plot to speak of.  They both lie up
there on the screen like well-dressed corpses, waiting for a spark to
animate them.  Dark City is marginally worse, I suppose, because it's
largely humorless, but it's a close call.</P>
<P>I did like one scene in Pleasantville, where the high school kids stand in
line waiting to go to the library, whose books have miraculously sprouted
words.  Kudos to Pleasantville for encouraging reading.  And that's the
message of this review as well:  Don't watch Pleasantville, read a book
instead.  (And no, sorry, Calvin and Hobbes books don't count.)</P>
