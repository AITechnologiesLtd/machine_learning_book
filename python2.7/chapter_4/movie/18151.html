 The Mummy (1999) 1 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Brendan Fraser, Rachel
Weisz, John Hannah and Arnold Vosloo.</P>
<P> At its core, the original version of "The Mummy" was a story of lost love.</P>
<P> A priest in ancient Egypt loses his princess and, after her death, commits
blasphemy by trying to use a forbidden incantation to raise her from the
dead.</P>
<P> He is caught, condemned and buried alive. Much later - 3,700 years later -
he is unearthed and accidentally brought back to life. This living mummy
then helps a team of archeologists find the tomb of his lost love so he can
again try to read that same spell and bring her back to life.</P>
<P> It was the stellar performance of Boris Karloff that was the main
attraction to this - by today's standards - creaky and somewhat campy
horror film.</P>
<P> The action-packed remake of this venerable classic owes more to Steven
Spielberg and George Lucas than to the Universal studio filmmakers of the
early 1930s.</P>
<P> For the new version of "The Mummy" isn't a horror film. It's more a
combination of many things - Indiana Jones rip-off, Foreign Legion
adventure, Cecil B. DeMille extravaganza and video game shoot-'em-up.</P>
<P> This remake of "The Mummy" may be bigger and incorporate the latest
technology in computer special effects, but it definitely is not better.
 It lacks the two key ingredients that made the original a classic -
atmosphere and sincerity.</P>
<P> "The Mummy," starring Brendan Fraser, cannot decide what coat to wear. It
continually changes from adventure to horror to spoof, never settling on
one course. It also lacks the romanticism of the original.</P>
<P> That much you learn at the outset. Instead of the priest, Imhotep (Arnold
Vosloo), being in love with pharaoh's daughter, he and the pharaoh's
mistress are two-timing the Egyptian ruler. He catches them, and they
assassinate him.</P>
<P> Captured themselves, she is killed while he, like in the original, is
buried alive. However, because of the nature of today's movie audiences,
some embellishments are added for thrills. Imhotep has his tongue cut out
and a swarm of flesh-eating scarabs are dumped into his sarcophagus.</P>
<P> The story then leaps forward to the Egyptian desert of the 1920s. A band
of legionnaires, among them daredevil and dashing Rick O'Connell (Fraser),
is battling a group of nomads in the ruins of the ancient, legendary city
of Hamunaptra. It's a scene straight out of "March or Die," as O'Connell,
the only survivor, is allowed to wander off into the desert.</P>
<P> A couple of years later, O'Connell teams up with a brother-sister pair of
treasure-hunting archeologists (Rachel Weisz and John Hannah) to again find
Hamunaptra and carry off its treasures.</P>
<P> And just for fun, there's another expedition, racing to the same locale.</P>
<P> Of course, they find the city and inadvertently unleash the dead Imhotep,
who is not your slow, stiff-walking, bandage-wrapped dead Egyptian.</P>
<P> No, thanks to computer technology, he can change into sand and be gone
with the wind.</P>
<P> He goes after members of the expeditions, stealing their body organs to
assist in his regeneration, so he can resurrect his girlfriend and
together, they can conquer the world.</P>
<P> "The Mummy" is not dull. It's action-laden in that outlandish, cartoonish
way most modern films treat such enterprises. People are mauled, beaten,
wounded, but, just like video game characters, they pop right back up and
return for more.</P>
<P> Fraser is actually quite good. He gets into the spirit of the proceedings,
and keeps his tongue in cheek. He knows this is a lark and goes along for
the fun.</P>
<P> Weisz is rather ditsy for an academic and totally unbelievable, while
Hannah is just along for comic relief.</P>
<P> Admittedly, this update of "The Mummy" is exciting, but it's also sad. It
seems so cynical, so contrived.</P>
<P> In the original, for all his foul deeds, you felt a twinge of sympathy for
Imhotep. You even were a bit sorry for him.</P>
<P> In this remake, Imhotep is only pixels and memory bytes, to be shot to
pieces and reconstituted as the plot dictates.</P>
<P> And that's too bad. "The Mummy" lacks heart. It's as cold and dead as a sphinx.</P>
