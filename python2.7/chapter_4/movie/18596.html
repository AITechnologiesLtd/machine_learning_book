<P>     Not to be glib, but there are two very simple reasons why so many
romantic comedies are so bad:  1) no romance; 2) no comedy.  The structure
is so simple it could be banged out by monkeys -- find two characters, put
them together, introduce an obstacle, tear them apart, resolve the
obstacle, bring them back together again.  That's where every romantic
comedy script begins, and sadly, that's also where most of them end.  See,
there's the not-so-small matter of creating two likeable characters whose
pairing is as plausible as their separation, as well as entertaining the
audience along the way to the foregone conclusion.  When your audience is
ready and willing to be charmed, a film's inability to generate wit or
warmth is inexcusable.</P>
<P>     NOTTING HILL, penned by FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL scribe Richard
Curtis, does everything a romantic comedy needs to do right.  Hugh Grant
plays William Thacker, a London bookseller living a simple if vaguely
lonely life.  That life is promptly turned upside down when Anna Scott
(Julia Roberts), the world's biggest female movie star, walks into his
shop.  Anna, the hounded subject of perpetual press coverage, is
understandably guarded; William, though a bit dazzled, is understated in
his treatment of the star.  Though Anna finds William's absence of fawning
unexpectedly appealing, plenty of barriers stand in the way of a potential
relationship:  famous boyfriends, paparazzi, geography and the uneasy way
celebrities interact with laypeople.</P>
<P>     The romantic side of NOTTING HILL works most effectively because
Curtis and director Roger Michell (PERSUASION) allow it to develop in
stages.  Initially, Anna and William's attraction to one other is 
abstract.  Anna is intrigued that William treats her with a degree of
normalcy, and longs for the simpler life she sees in William's interaction
with his group of friends; William, previously unlucky in love, is
overwhelmed by the prospect of being desired by one of the world's most
desirable women.  The abstractions give way to a more personal
understanding during a day spent together, which in turn give way to more
concrete realization of the different worlds in which they live.
Crackling with chemistry together, both stars give assured, engaging
performances while still leaving a few rough edges -- Anna's prickly
preoccupation with the perils of her fame, William's addiction to the
"love heroin" of his romance with a star.</P>
<P>     It's convenient that the writer who can put these romantic
developments together is also one of the finest comedy writers working.
Curtis -- a co-creator of both the wonderfully wordy "Blackadder" and the
purely physical "Mr. Bean -- has always had an impressive comic range.
Here he slides from the broad (Rhys Ifans as William's slovenly flatmate
Spike) to the silly (William's fumbling efforts to climb into a fenced
private garden) to the cleverly satirical (a film press junket William
muddles through posing as a reporter from "Horse and Hound Magazine") with
equal dexterity.  The solid supporting cast, including Tim McInnerny, Hugh
Bonneville and Emma Chambers, comes through with appealing work, but it's
Curtis' wicked way with a line or a visual gag that keeps the comic energy
high.</P>
<P>     NOTTING HILL does make the mistake of clocking in at a heavy 125
minutes, dragging out its denouement to an unnecessarily tortuous degree.
In fact, there are several occasions where the editing seems disjointed,
with odd cutaways and dialogue beginning too early.  The technical
glitches are perhaps more notable in a film which spins its romance
unabashedly into a confection that's pure Hollywood, and not just because
one of the characters is a Hollywood star.  This is romantic comedy in an
old-fashioned sense, where the pleasures come more from a zestful staging
than from foolish details like whether the relationship is "realistic."
NOTTING HILL takes you to a slightly heightened reality, a place where
movie magic moves you because it has found both the romance and the comedy
in romantic comedy.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 star powers:  8.</PRE>
