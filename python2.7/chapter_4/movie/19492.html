<P>There's not much to say about "Varsity Blues", the latest
insignificant entry into the teen movie field, other than the fact
that it's another clunker from MTV Films. "Dawson's Creek" heartthrob
James Van Der Beek plays John Moxon, or "Mox", a second-string
quarterback on his high school football team; a team playing in the
football-obsessed West Canaan, Texas. When the star quarterback gets
injured, Mox finds himself in the spotlight as West Canaan's new
hero. But Mox would rather stay home reading Kurt Vonnegut than play
for his legendary hard-ass coach, Bud Kilmer(Jon Voight).  Mox decides
that if his team is going to win the championship, it'll be for them,
not for the coach.  Sounds like high aspirations for a film that is
actually a frat-boy movie filled with gratuitous nudity, beer-drinking
and football. That Van Der Beek and Voight manage to give decent
performances is a wonder considering that W. Peter Iliff's screenplay
is nothing but a bunch of stereotypes. "Varsity Blues" is watchable
when it doesn't take itself too seriously, but more often than not, it
does.</P>
