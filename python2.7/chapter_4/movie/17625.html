<P>     To be or not to be?  That is the question.  Or, at least, that is
supposed to be the question.  In the care of Disturbing Behavior, the
question is rather what to be.  One on hand, you have a fairly gripping
psychological thriller.  On the other, you have a teen moneymaking vehicle.</P>
<P>     One may ask, why can't it be both?  It can't be both because you just
can't be a psychological thriller and a horror film.  Sure, people have
tried, but I haven't seen it yet, and dollars to doughnuts, I've probably
seen more films than you.  Unfortunately, the writer and director of
Disturbing Behavior didn't quite get this.</P>
<P>     At least it focused mainly on being a teen vehicle.  In Disturbing
Behavior, instead of good kids going bad, bad kids are going good.  Of
course, having all seen our share of films with this plot, we know that
they're being brainwashed.</P>
<P>     Like all horror films, there really isn't any mystery or surprise to
the film.  Point A can figure Point B.  You have your basic secluded
setting: nice, suburban, and, of course, on an island only accessible by
ferry.</P>
<P>     Well, basically, the movie grudges along, trying to be good.  That's
fine.  It tries to be funny and basically succeeds in that part.  It tries
to surprise and trick us, but basically fails in that respect.  It has a
hell of a soundtrack.</P>
<P>     The thing that bugged me about the film was that, instead of accepting
that it was a popcorn movie, it tried to be intelligent.  For that, you may
blame "X-Files" vets David Nutter and Scott Michael Rosenburg.  It tries to
be surreal, it tries to be intelligent, and it makes references that pass
way over the heads of its target audience.</P>
<P>     This basically puts a stake in the heart of the movie, killing what
could have been a good teen flick, which still was, according to the
majority of teens, a cool movie.  This yet again proves Cynical Hollywood
Thesis #132: "If you slap a good-looking girl, a teen-idol guy, and a good
soundtrack on a film, and it will make up its incredibly meager budget."
The soundtrack on this one is mostly punk metal, but includes some
interesting additions, such as the 50s song "Accentuate the Positive."  It
also gives us the gift of Harvey Dangerfield's "Flagpole Sitta," the song of
the 1998 summer that is basically gone but not forgotten.</P>
<P>     The kicks I got in the film mostly came in the form of inside jokes.
For instance, I was the only one in the theatre who noticed that Bruce
Greenwood, the bad guy, was in the exact opposite position in the cult TV
show "Nowhere Man" a few years back.  Or the million references it put in to
The Stepford Wives.  Or the homage it pays to "The X-Files."</P>
<P>     The performances are better than the average horror film, but the
script isn't: cliches dot the movie and basically get on my nerves.  The
director tries to do film noir, but forgot how to somewhere along the line.
Nick Stahl and Bruce Greenwood are the standouts of the film, although
Holmes hones her natural talent to some degree.</P>
<P>     This isn't all to say that Disturbing Behavior wasn't fun: it was.  I
enjoyed watching it, making fun of it, watching Katie Holmes not have to be
the all-American girl with the SAT-level vocabulary she plays on "Dawson's
Creek" (nipple and nose ring and all), but the film basically disappointed
me.  I wanted a paranoid thriller.  I got Wes Craven.</P>
