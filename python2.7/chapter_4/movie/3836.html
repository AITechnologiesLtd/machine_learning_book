<P>     With HOME ALONE and MRS. DOUBTFIRE, director Chris Columbus has 
shown an aptitude for rescuing reasonably mediocre films by infusing 
them with doses of high-energy humor.  If not for certain hilarious 
sequences, neither of those movies would have climbed above the usual 
continuum of forgettable comedies.  Now, adapting from a French 
screenplay (NEUF MOIS), Columbus has chosen to helm this exploration of 
the ups and downs of pregnancy. </P>
<P>     For the most part, "unspectacular" is an apt description for NINE 
MONTHS.  The motion picture has a pedestrian script that attempts, with 
only limited success, to wed a romantic comedy with a one-hundred minute 
exhortation on the joys of having a family.  Bursts of hilarity -- and 
there are three worth mentioning -- save NINE MONTHS from wearing out 
its welcome.  One of the more obvious problems with the film is that it 
takes a few feeble stabs at drama, something this sort of movie is not 
well-suited for. </P>
<P>     Hugh Grant plays Dr. Samuel Faulkner, a child psychiatrist who, 
paradoxically, is afraid of kids.  His live-in lover of five years, 
Rebecca (Julianne Moore), is beginning to realize that something is 
missing from her life.  It's not until she discovers she's pregnant that 
she realizes her maternal instincts have been in overdrive.  
Unfortunately, Samuel doesn't share Rebecca's excitement about impending 
parenthood, and spends so much time bemoaning the loss of his perfect 
lifestyle that his distraught girlfriend moves out.  Refusing to see 
Samuel, she lodges with a pregnant friend (Joan Cusack) and her boorish 
husband (Tom Arnold).   </P>
<P>     Despite limited screen time, the real star of NINE MONTHS is Robin 
Williams.  Playing an obstetrician from Russia who has never delivered a 
human baby and seems more adept at malapropisms than diagnoses, the lead 
from MRS. DOUBTFIRE shows that he and director Columbus have formed an 
excellent rapport.  With his mastery of physical comedy, Williams is 
right at home in the midst of this hit-and-miss farce. </P>
<P>     Grant, with his "aw shucks" manner and bumbling cuteness, was very 
good in both FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL and THE ENGLISHMAN WHO WENT UP 
A HILL..., but seems a little out of his element in this, his first big 
budget, Hollywood movie. Grant's undeniable strength lies in his 
subtlety, and that's not a quality Columbus films are renowned for.  
There are times when the actor is charming and charismatic, but those 
instances are mixed with scenes where he seems lost. </P>
<P>     Julianne Moore, on the other hand, continues to display great 
range.  Although there's nothing spectacular about the role of Rebecca, 
this part, taken in conjunction with her appearances in SHORT CUTS and 
SAFE, is indicative of the breadth of the actress' ability.  On the 
other hand, following a reasonably strong turnout as Arnold 
Schwarzenegger's sidekick in TRUE LIES, Tom Arnold gives an uneven 
performance.  On those occasions when he's not funny, he tends to be 
just plain irritating. </P>
<P>     Three sequences in NINE MONTHS are guaranteed to get huge laughs.  
The first involves a toy store fracas between the two male leads and a 
green dinosaur ("Arnie") with a penchant for profanity.  The second is 
madcap drive to the hospital in which Samuel manages to injure just 
about everyone who gets in his way.  Then there's the delivery room, 
where the birth becomes almost incidental.  Sprinkled around these 
payoff scenes are smaller chuckles, but, on the whole, the comic tone is 
uneven.  Those expecting to spend one-hundred minutes rolling in the 
aisles will probably be disappointed, but, if nothing else, this film 
offers a light summer option for anyone whose palates has not acquired a 
taste for action. </P>
