<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
2 and a half stars</P>
<P>I'm not sure what message Steven Zaillian is trying to give us in his
new film, A Civil Action.  Zaillian adapted Schindlers List and
Searching For Bobby Fischer for the screen, and once again he has shown
considerable talent in his take on the true story of lawyer Jan
Schlichtmann, a man who gives up everything in his search for justice,
only to realize that justice cannot be measured in dollars.  The film
should have been character based, but unfortunately it is based almost
entirely on Schlichtmann's complicated legal case and how he and his
business partners go broke trying to prove the truth.  But as Robert
Duvall tells John Travolta, truth is not something that is found in a
courtroom.  Perhaps this cynical view on the American legal system is
what Zaillian is getting at, but I'm still not sure.  He also has
something to say about compensation, justice and moral order, though
none of these issues are voiced with adequate emotional depth.</P>
<P>Schlichtmann's case centers on a tragedy that deprived eight families -
living in the small American town of Woburn - of their children.  They
say this is due to Woburn's water supply, which has allegedly been
poisoned by riverside factories. Schlichtmann is at first reluctant to
take up the case, but sees dollar signs after discovering that major
corporations are involved.  With the help of his dedicated small team of
employees - including financial advisor James Gordon (William H. Macy,
in yet another excellent small role) - Schlichtmann attempts to bring
the big guys to their knees.  He faces veteran attorney Jerome Facher
(Robert Duvall), an expert with considerably more experience under his
belt, and ends up delving far too deep in the case, landing his company
in serious financial trouble.</P>
<P>A Civil Action is yet another vehicle that showcases John Travolta's
dominant presence, although he is not eccentric here.  Travolta has
channeled and refined himself and his performance is tamer than what you
might expect.  He is a pleasing actor and this is a pleasing part,
although the script rarely gives him the chance of grasping emotion.
Robert Duvall is expected to give the film its energy, but again the
script doesn't properly utilize his capabilities. With such a talented
cast, it's a pity that A Civil Action doesn't benefit from any of them
except perhaps Macy, who provides the only character I could clearly
relate to.  As his financial world tumbles down around him, Gordon
confronts Schlichtmann in an excellent scene that expresses the
arrogance of Travolta's lawyer perfectly - he can fight crusades, but
what gives him the right to bring his friends down with him?</P>
<P>Like so many others, A Civil Action is pretentious because it tells an
important story without building a solid dramatic core on which to stage
it.  Though it is often involving, often engaging and occasionally
moving, this is ultimately a heartless piece that is too focused on
facts and too little on character. If you don't mind a courtroom caper
that is so stripped of emotion that it often feels like a documentary, A
Civil Action's coherent screenplay and steady performances will keep you
ignorant of its faults.  There is material for a potentially excellent
film here, but one can't help but feel that Steven Zaillian has taken
the easy way out on too many occasions.  Instead of examining tragedy
and what it means to those involved, he examines courtroom procedures.
Instead of looking into the hearts and minds of characters that are
fighting for truth, he merely studies the truth itself.  One might say
that A Civil Action could have been a lot worse - that's true, but my
main complaint is that it could have been a lot better.</P>
