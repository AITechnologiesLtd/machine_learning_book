<P>   Pulsating with puissance, throbbing with testosterone,
"Boiler Room" deserves the comment it received from critic
Ray Pride who calls it "a slick, dick-swinging diversion."  A
first feature for writer-director Ben Younger--who spent a year
interviewing workers in our nation's so-called boiler
rooms--this debut is going to be a tough act for the man to
follow.</P>
<P>  The classic movie about the world of stocks and bonds is,
of course, Oliver Stone's 1987 "Wall Street," an unsubtle but
compelling foray into the notion that greed is good.  The
youthful, vibrant, mostly conscience-free brokers in Younger's
movie do not disagree in the slightest.  But "Boiler Room"
brings the highly commercial classic of thirteen years ago
down to a level that could be appreciated by its expected
demographics without dumbing down the plot scheme.  Don't
think that the hip-hop score is thrown in arbitrarily to appeal
to a younger, more urban audience.  The rap music
symbolizes the psychological construct of the players in this
game of chance.  Almost unanimously young, suburban,
white males, they nonetheless picture themselves as a
cosmopolitan, sophisticated, hip and thoroughly modern
group of Wall Street tycoons who just happen to work in the
sticks of Long Island an hour away from the #6 Fulton Street
stop on the IRT Lex line.</P>
<P>   Like Michael Mann's "The Insider," this film aims not
simply at a single industry but serves as an indictment of
American capitalism in general--a system whose viva-yo spirit
of "What's-in-it-for-me-and-damn-the-public" generates big
bucks for the ethically-challenged while destroying the
physical and financial health of its victims.  The CEO's of Big
Tobacco spout long noses with their insistence that their
weed is not addictive: the hustlers selling snake oil miracles
in shady, obscure brokerage houses are their epigonous
disciples.</P>
<P>   In Giovanni Ribisi--who comes across as a mousy guy with
a chip on his shoulder, especially eager to prove
himself to the world--Younger has found the ideal protagonist. 
As Seth David, Ribisi performs in the role of a 19-year-old
college dropout who runs a successful but illegal casino in his
home.  Eager as a puppy to please his acerbic dad Marty
(Ron Rifkin), Seth is determined to show his old man that
though the kid was once brutally smacked by him for falling
from his bicycle and thereafter treated with relative
indifference, he can achieve on his own and make his father
proud.  But Marty, a federal judge, is merely disgusted by the
boy's dabbling in illegal gambling--which he feels threatens
his own respectable position in the judiciary.  When Seth
takes a job as a trainee with a Long Island brokerage house,
J.T. Marlin, he finally succeeds in making his dad proud--for a
time.</P>
<P>   "Boiler Room" follows the fast-moving adventures of this
young and acquisitive everyman in the bowels of the boiler
room, where the trainees are lectured in the style of
"Glengarry Glen Ross"'s honcho (played in that movie by
Alec Baldwin).  Repeatedly cajoled and motivated by the
firm's 27-year-old multi-millionaire, Jim (Ben Affleck) that you
WILL make your first million in three years, these wet-behind-
the-ears agents don't give a damn that the stock they're
pushing is backed by failing or non-existent companies.  The
movie serves as a warning to each of us to resist the
entreaties made by telemarketers--who have an answer for
every rebuttal you can make to their products.  Younger
appears to advise us, when under the hard sell, to "just hang
up" (to paragraph Nancy Reagan), though women who
answer the phone need not worry.  Among this company's
rules is never to "pitch the bitch," that is, never try to sell to
women.  Women are implicitly harder to con than men and
will pester the hell out of the salesmen the first time
something goes wrong with their stock.  As you listen to the
egregiously pushy phone banter of these snake-oil
telemarketers, you've got to get a big charge out of their
sheer cockiness--while simultaneously deploring their white-
collar criminality.</P>
<P>   These young guys may look like suburban wimps, but
Younger makes clear that their high-tension profession instills
them with tough-guy, racist, homophobic attitudes.  They
think nothing of beating up a large dude in a bar who makes
threatening noises to one of their number; they loudly insult a
gay man in Tribeca's trendy Odeon Restaurant; they
exchange ethnic and religious pejoratives to one another on
their work floor; and in more than one instance they act as
though fired up by a Fascist provocateur--marching loudly to
receptions provided by their big boss, Michael (played
charmingly by Tom-Hanks lookalike Tom Everett Scott).</P>
<P>   The movie has some minor flaws.  Seth's dad is
increasingly concerned that his son's illegal casino activities
are a threat to his own position as a federal judge.  However,
we often hear of celebrities whose sons and daughters are
coke-heads--situations irrelevant to their own tenure on the
job.  Also the movie sets a new record for the use of the
most obnoxious of all English-language expressions, "ya-
know"--which is uttered thirty times at the very least.  Other
than these civils, heck, this movie is a gas.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 120 minutes.  (C) 2000
