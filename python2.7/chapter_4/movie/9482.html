<PRE>FLIRTING WITH DISASTER (1996)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Writer/Director: David O. Russel
Starring: Ben Stiller, Patricia Arquette, Tea Leoni, Mary Tyler Moore,
George Segal, Alan Alda, Lily Tomlin, Josh Brolin, Richard Jenkins</P>
<P>David O. Russel's debut film, "Spanking the Monkey" (no jokes about the
title, guys, it's old), devastated my emotionally, and I'm still not
over it.  It was the most intense character study I've ever seen and
depressed me beyond belief.  His sophomore film, however, made me laugh
so hard that I'm still not over the physical damage I did to my gut
while watching this.  Okay, I'm exaggerating, but this film is a
screwball film that just gets funnier and funnier as it goes on, and
ends on an even funnier note.</P>
<P>The seemingly standard screwball plot deals with a grown man (Ben
Stiller) searching for his real parents, since he was adopted.  His
parents (Mary Tyler Moore and George Segal, who were so funny together,
that they were forced to appear on several episodes of co-star Tea
Leoni's sitcom, "The Naked Truth") are outraged when he announces this,
and introduces them to his slim, slightly neurotic adoption agency
helper or whatever she is (Tea).  The thing that caused him to bring
this up is the birth of their son (his wife is Patricia Arquette, by the
way), and is inability to name him for that anal reason.</P>
<P>So he embarks on a trek with his wife and Tea to find his parents and
rejoin them, but finds out that the agency screwed up and sends them to
the wrong people twice before winding them up with his real parents
(Alan Alda and Lily Tomlin).  What's great about this is that everyone
you meet is nothing like they first seem.  They run into Patricia's old
male pal from high school (Josh Brolin) who's a U.S. Marshall, and turns
out to be married to his male partner who suffers from hysterically high
amounts of hypertension (wonderfully and memorably played by Richard
Jenkins).  And, of course, his real parents turn out to be drug addicts
who brew LSD in their basement but are still tight about their
"non-smoking household."</P>
<P>There's also a lot of partner swapping, as Brolin and Arquette begin to
go at it, but in Brolin's fetish way (wait till you find out what his
favorite part of the female body is, which spurns one of the funniest
scenes in 90s cinema).  And Tea and Ben go at it, although neither is
really sure if they should.  One scene they just give eachother little
pecks, then jump on eachother simultaneously.</P>
<P>Then there's the direction and writing by Russel, who certainly has a
knack for breaking taboos (like incest and masturbation in "Spanking the
Monkey" - title doesn't say it all), shocks the audience and causes them
to laugh hysterically, a great feat if you've seen his first film since
he drained all emotions from his audience till they were silently
depressed for months afterwards.  Here, he shows us many big taboos:
like the Brolin fetish; the Brolin/Jenkins gay relationship; openly
talking about felatio; the truth about B&Bs; and we even get to see Mary
Tyler Moore pull up her shirt and show us her bra, as she brags about
how perfect her breasts are.  This film isn't flirting with disaster,
much less crashing into it.</P>
<P>But Russel holds it all together, and by the ending where a hundred
things are going on, and you can't decide which one is funnier, he still
manages to hold a tight grasp on things, and even ends on a note of
semi-sentimentalism, which isn't even cringe-inducing.  And, of course,
he shows some more shocking moments during the end credits, where we get
to see all the end couples in bed in their numerous ways, and all with
that lovely prop: the baby.</P>
<P>This film is a lovely companion piece to "Spanking the Monkey": brings
you down from your depression, by showing you some of the same taboos
but in a different sense.  So, if you ever go ahead and rent "Monkey,"
make sure you couple it with this one.  You'll laugh your ass off.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***1/2</PRE>
