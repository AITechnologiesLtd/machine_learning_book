<PRE>                               THE LION KING
                       A film review by Eric Walker
                        Copyright 1994 Eric Walker</PRE>
<P>     Walt Disney came up with a winning formula when he made SNOW WHITE
AND THE SEVEN DWARFS, back in 1937; over the years, his company refined
that formula to a science.  With the re-birth of Disney in the late
1980s, the "magical" formula for Disney animation was re-discovered by
Jeff Katzenberg and Michael Eisner, the studio heads.  Unfortunately,
these two men are not Walt Disney: they're Hollywood studio
executives.  That means that you can expect them to milk a winning
formula for all it's worth, and not dare to push the edge.  If it
works, why change it?</P>
<P>     Because you can wear it out, that's why.  The spectacular
box-office success of Disney's animated films (except for THE RESCUERS
DOWN UNDER, which deserved to do better) has blinded the men on the top
of the heap; as long as the money keeps rolling in, they're not going
to want to make any changes.  But they don't see that when you rely too
heavy on a safe, predictable formula, you risk losing the life-granting
"spark" that infuses your creations with energy--and keeps the money
rolling in.  THE LION KING is going to make another pile of money for
Disney, and as a result we can expect to see no changes in the formula
for Disney animated films in the future.  That formula is laid bare
here:</P>
<P>     - Pour lots of money into producing great animation.  This is the
easy part.  The Disney studios have hundreds of artists and the latest
computer technology to produce lavish, dazzling animation that can be
matched by no one else.  There are some amazing moments here,
especially during the opening sequence (which Disney has pushed for
months, revealing this sequence at its many Disney Stores as early as
February) and a scene where Mufasa speaks to his son from the clouds.
The animation on the rest of the movie is also good, as one expects
from Disney.  But is great animation the only reason we watch Disney
films?  No. The formula has more ingredients, such as ....</P>
<P>     - Create an evil, sneaky villain, and then let him be utterly
defeated (preferably in the midst of an inferno of some sort, with
lightning and smoke and explosions and fire to make it more dramatic).
With the Disney formula, there are only the Good Guys and the Bad
Guys--you know whom to root for, because the Bad Guys are always drawn
in a cartoonish way that makes them look less than human.  The perfect
hero and heroine battle the freaks, and guess who wins in the end?</P>
<P>     - Create a hero, and give him a girlfriend--but make sure the
hero is nice and bland.  What's the difference between Simba, the hero
of this film, and Aladdin?  Nothing at all, other than being drawn
differently.  They're both young and naive; they both make a big
mistake; they both correct that mistake by beating the Bad Guy once and
for all.  And the girlfriend must be equally bland, though at least in
ALADDIN Princess Jasmine was a major character.  In THE LION KING, the
girlfriend is merely there for the hero to grow up with, and to bring
him back to face his big mistake so that the movie can reach its
climax.  Why must the hero and his girlfriend be so generic and
uninteresting?  So that they won't overshadow the supporting
characters, as we see in the next ingredient ....</P>
<P>     - For comic relief (and merchandising), through in a few goofy
characters to play the hero's friends.  These characters always act
silly, and they get the lion's share (pun intended) of the laughs,
except during the climax when they stay by the hero's side and battle
the bad guys.</P>
<P>     - And of course, include a bunch of musical numbers.  Ever since
THE LITTLE MERMAID won the Oscars for Best Original Score and Best
Song, Disney has been pushing its animated films as the last bastion of
the Hollywood musical.  Each of their animated films includes a bunch
of bouncy numbers as filler, one Busby Berkeley surrealist musical
number, and a sappy, treacly "love" song to get the audience all
weepy-eyed.</P>
<P>     When this formula works, it can awaken the child in us.  I enjoyed
THE LITTLE MERMAID, because it made the Disney films seem fresh and new
again.  I loved ALADDIN in spite of its flaws--but if it weren't for
Robin Williams, that movie would have fallen flat on its face, because
it was nothing but Disney formula.  THE LION KING doesn't have Robin
Williams; and while it does have James Earl Jones' booming baritone as
Mufasa, the great king, that's not enough to keep this film from
feeling like a re-hash.  There's nothing new here, and there's not
enough creativity to make it seem refreshing.</P>
<P>     Sure, the animation's great--that's easy for Disney to do,
because they've got millions of dollars to do it.  But there's more to
making a great film than merely dazzling the eyes, whether it's with
animated lions, computer-generated dinosaurs or exploding bridges
(which we'll see in TRUE LIES).  As in all great movies, it's the story
and the characters that count, and there's nothing in here that we
haven't seen before.  Mufasa himself is a regal, majestic figure; the
comic-relief characters are funny; and the evil Scar is wicked and
properly evil.  But Disney has given us a long line of majestic, funny,
and evil characters, from Cruella de Vil and Stromboli to Gaston and
Iago; the characters in THE LION KING simply aren't charismatic enough
to come out from the shadow of their predecessors.</P>
<P>     As if to add insult to injury, the musical numbers are downright
awful.  There's nothing in here to match the catchy, joyful "Under The
Sea and "Be Our Guest," or even the fun "Prince Ali" and "Never Had A
Friend Like Me."  The songs were written by Tim Rice (who also worked
on the ALADDIN soundtrack) and Elton John--who also sings the "love
theme" over the ending credits.  Bleah.  Disney is certain to push this
soundtrack for the Oscar...but if it actually wins, it will be
undeniable proof that taste is dead in Hollywood.  There IS a
reasonably good musical score by Hans Zimmer that's based on on African
music (though why didn't Disney just bring in some real African
musicians to compose it?), but that's about all the praise I can give
it.</P>
<P>     The problem is simply that we've seen it all before.  Nothing is
new here, and one gets the impression that Disney is merely spinning
its wheels.  The Disney formula is starting to wear thin ... but as
long as it keeps making millions for the company, we're not going to
see anything different.</P>
<P>     In this respect, one can say that BEAUTY AND THE BEAST was the
most original Disney film in a long time, because while it included
many aspects of the Disney formula (animation, musical numbers, comedy
relief characters), it actually worked on real characterization (at
least on the part of the Beast himself) and an entertaining story
(though I detested the character of Gaston).  But that film proved to
be an exception to the rule.  ALADDIN, despite Robin Williams'
delightful presence, was merely a return to the old formula ... the
same formula that mires down THE LION KING.</P>
<P>     This does not bode well for the long-term future of American
animated films.  Hollywood is falling once again into the trap of
trying to imitate Disney, rather than experimenting with other ways of
making animated films.  But Walt Disney himself knew that if you don't
keep looking forward and aiming for something new, fresh, and
different, you're liable to dig your own grave.</P>
<P>     Disney has reached the height of its popularity; in fact, it may
have already passed that peak (note the troubles of Euro Disneyland).
But if corporate history has any precedents, it is that the bigwigs at
the top don't notice that the tree is sick until it's already rotten
and ready to collapse or be cut down.  I suspect that the same thing is
starting with Disney:  THE LION KING is merely one symptom of corporate
rot that is starting to seep into the Disney empire--its movies are
safe, non-controversial, and bland; the theme parks are expanding with
seemingly endless re-hashes of the same few ideas (movie-based rides);
and all of the company's other projects (the BEAUTY AND THE BEAST stage
musical, or their proposed ceremonies for the World Cup tournament)
consist of them spending money like water to flash and dazzle the eyes
and promote themselves.</P>
<P>     Disney is in trouble--but they don't know it yet.  The next few
years are going to be *very* interesting times, indeed.</P>
