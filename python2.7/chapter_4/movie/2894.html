<P>     With a cast like this, it's probably very difficult (if not
impossible) to make a bad movie.  The strength of PRINCESS CARABOO, a
likable SOMMERSBY wannabe, is in its performers, who manage to submerge
a great many script-related flaws.  The result is a story that, if not
high on originality or inventiveness, makes for a palatable fable.</P>
<P>     At the heart of PRINCESS CARABOO lies a question of identity: is
the title character (Phoebe Cates) a real Javanese princess who had
been kidnapped and sold into slavery, or is she a wonderfully creative
English servant girl who has invented this character to mock an
aristocracy that exploits her class?  The story, which takes place in
1817, is told from the point-of-view of Gutch (Stephen Rea), a
newspaper reporter trying to get to the truth.  During the course of
his investigation, he becomes obsessed by the Princess, and predictably
falls in love.</P>
<P>     The screenplay has a tendency to go off on unexpected and, for the
most part, undesirable tangents.  There's a subplot about crooked bank
dealings, a long-winded examination by a local "expert" (John Lithgow)
of the Princess' authenticity, and a tediously overblown sequence in
which Caraboo is introduced to the Prince Regent.  These distractions
keep the film from ever finding a stable focus.</P>
<P>     The romance between Gutch and Caraboo isn't especially compelling
or, for that matter, believable.  The two spend very little time
together and, with Caraboo unable to speak English, they certainly
don't hold any lengthy conversations.  Rea and Cates do what they can
with limited material, but the best they manage to come up with is
"cute."  There certainly aren't any sparks.</P>
<P>     Wendy Hughes and Jim Broadbent play Mrs. and Mr. Worrall, a
wealthy upper-class couple under whose roof Caraboo takes refuge after
she is nearly imprisoned for being a vagrant.  These two veterans form
stable anchors around which the rest of the uneven production can
swirl.</P>
<P>     Phoebe Cates, having used roles in recent films like BODIES, REST
AND MOTION to shed her GREMLINS image, is the picture of serene
beauty.  She is effectively mysterious and equally acceptable as either
a foreign princess or a lower-class pretender.  Her real-life husband,
Kevin Kline, steals a few scenes with his buffoonish, over-the-top
portrayal of Fixos, the Worralls' Greek butler.</P>
<P>     Although PRINCESS CARABOO tries a lighter approach to a subject
dealt with more seriously by THE RETURN OF MARTIN GUERRE and its
American remake, SOMMERSBY, the issue of the central character's
legitimacy is similar.  In this case, however, resolving the mystery
becomes a secondary diversion to watching so many accomplished
performers struggle to fashion something entertaining out of an
unpolished script.  Their success, though qualified, proves the value
of a strong cast to any motion picture.</P>
