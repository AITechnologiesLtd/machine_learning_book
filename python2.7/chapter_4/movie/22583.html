<PRE>Review by Donlee Brussel</PRE>
<P>It's time to soak up the estrogen with the chick flick version of "One
Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest."  "Girl, Interrupted" stars the dynamic
duo of homely Winona Ryder and Power Puff Girl Angelina Jolie.  Also
along for the ride are the latest pseudo-teen stars, Clea DuVall (the
dyke in "The Faculty") and Jared Leto (Angel Face in "Fight Club").
Thrown in for ethnic sprinkling is Whoopi Goldberg.  So get some
Kleenex and the Spice Girls CD because Girl Power rules for two hours.</P>
<P>The year is 1967; Susanna (Ryder) is dazed and confused.  She's the
only senior not going on to college.  She attempts suicide, fails and
is sent off to Claymoore by her parents.  Claymoore's a Boston
psychiatric ward with several colorful patients.  There's Georgina
(DuVall) the compulsive liar who's Susanna's roomie; Daisy (Brittany
Murphy), the stuck up daddy's girl with an eating disorder; Polly
(Elizabeth Moss), the deformed pyromaniac; and Lisa (Jolie), the sultry
sociopath.  It's the job of Valerie (Whoopi Goldberg), the head nurse,
to keep them all in line.</P>
<P>"Girl, Interrupted" chronicles Susanna's 18-month stay at Claymoore and
at times, it's an intriguing one.  Don't think for a second that it's
because of Winona Ryder.  She seems almost monotonous compared to the
extravagantly prodigious Angelina Jolie who is going to get the
recognition she deserves come award time.  Since Jolie won a Golden
Globe for her ardent performance in "Gia" she seems to only get better
with age.</P>
<P>Goldberg gives an a-OK performance as the nurse who watches Susanna
shave her legs.  Jared Leto struts around topless as Susanna's
boyfriend who mutters some "this is not right" BS in an after school
special manner midway through the film.  Jeffrey Tambor delivers
a "square" performance as Susanna's psychiatrist.  And Vanessa Redgrave
provides us an unnecessary mediocre performance that should've been
edited out.</P>
<P>Winona Ryder has been trying to bring Susanna Kaiser's autobiographical
book to the screen for years.  And now that she finally has, she can go
back to doing ping-pong ball tricks.  James Mangold does an admirable
job of helming "Girl, Interrupted."  He takes an attenuated and
conventional approach at the film. Often it works.  Often it doesn't.
Dig the groovy tunes on the soundtrack and behold the historical clips
of 'Nam and Martin Luther King Jr. in this seemingly ambitious 60s
period piece.  Dread the all-too-predictable basement confrontation
finale that is "Girl, Interrupted's" most fatal flaw.</P>
<P>Crazy people are people too...despite my proof that they aren't!  Don't
judge a book by its cover.  It doesn't matter how you look on the
outside, it's what's on the inside that counts.  Most of you know the
cliched moral of the story already.  Therefore, the only real reason to
see this film is Angelina Jolie's magnetic performance.  If that
doesn't interest you, pass on this formulaic work and get yourself some
Maxi Pads with wings.</P>
