<P>     Another overrated underachiever from last year, SHINE is the true
story of David Helfgott, a classical pianist from Australia who spent a
double decade in a mental institution before returning to the ivory
fold.  Three actors play the prodigy, with Geoffrey Rush's adult
arguably the most memorable of the lot.  (He doesn't even use a hand
double!) His stammering, seen-RAIN-MAN-one-too-many-times shtick,
however, is far less affecting than it should be.  Blame better movies
like MY LEFT FOOT, whose tortured heroes were a world more-accessible
than this one.  (Helfgott's story is incomplete and, at times, incompre-
hensible.  More than once I wondered if I was watching a dream
sequence.)  Of the other actors, Armin Mueller-Stahl displays subtle
sadism as Helfgott's demanding, narcissistic father.  Even better is
John Gielgud's London mentor, the one character who comes the closest to
showing us the soul of a performing musician. </P>
