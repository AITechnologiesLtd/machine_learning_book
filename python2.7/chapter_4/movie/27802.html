Down To Earth</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony </PRE>
<P>Don't get me wrong, I like Chris Rock the comedian. But Chris Rock the 
comedic actor needs quite a bit of work. Ironically, his character is 
nicknamed "boo-y" in this rewrite of Warren Beatty's "Heaven Can Wait." </P>
<P>A jumpy angel presumes Rock, a struggling comedian, dead as a truck 
approaches Rock's bicycle. Pulled from his body too soon, Rock pleads 
with heaven's managing angel, "I am not dead, now get me a new body, 
I've got an audition at the Apollo!" The angel concedes that Rock's 
death was indeed "untimely" and sets him up (temporarily) with the body 
of an older rich white guy who had just been killed by his wife's lover. </P>
<P>It's a fun story, decently updated with a strong enough script. 
Unfortunately, nearly everyone in the film outperforms the lead; most 
notably two character actors - the butler and the maid. Chris is as 
stiff as a rock; his awkward delivery never lets us enter this wonderful 
world of make believe. Coupled with occasional rickety editing, the 
production feels of a less than average independent film. </P>
<P>That said, of course, a few humdingers slip through:
"She's so skinny, you two might just start a fire havin' sex."
"Your mom has so much hair under her arms - she looks like she's got 
Buckwheat in a headlock." </P>
<P>Wonderful also, the first scene where Rock (as the rich Charles 
Wellington) meets the butler. And, Rock (as Wellingtion) stirs up the 
waters as well as the intensity level of the film in a strong hospital 
board meeting scene. Nicely done. One last touch, Rock's first attempts 
at the Apollo result in boos so Herculean they create a gale, his 
coat-pocket handkerchief fluttering in its the wind. </P>
<P>A stronger lead could have pulled this picture together. Additionally, 
the heart-stopping political incorrectness of Rock speaking hood-talk 
from the mouth of a rich white guy gave the film some of its brawnier 
moments. The production would have benefited by displaying the white 
Wellington (outside) more often (juicing the contrast), instead of 
showing us Rock (inside & out) nearly all the time. </P>
