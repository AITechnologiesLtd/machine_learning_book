<PRE>Saving Private Ryan
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1998 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>**** (out of 4) The first 20 minutes of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN had been so
hyped that I wondered if anyone had questioned whether it fit with the rest
of the movie. I knew it would be amazing, but I wondered if it would be
gratuitous, Spielberg's way of showing off his technical skill, a little
treat before the rest of the movie got underway.... </P>
<P>The sequence is rightly praised for it's grim depiction of the chaos and
casualties of the invasion of Normandy. Spielberg's approach is to portray
the confusion and violence of battle on a personal, not a tactical, level.
There are no establishing shots or god's-eye views of the beach. We never
know how the battle is being played out because the hand held camera has a
personal point of view, following only a handful of the film's main characters. </P>
<P>In a sense, the first sequence IS gratuitous, and Spielberg most certainly
is showing off. The sequence is full of small details that must have been
extremely difficult to set up. For each soldier the camera watches die, it
seems two others are killed in the corners of the screen. Yet this whole
sequence has little to do with the plot of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. If it were
cut, the story could be summarized in the same way. </P>
<P>But the film's plot is not what the film is about. It is merely a thread
that ties together the patches that make up the rest of the film. SAVING
PRIVATE RYAN is really a tour of the life of American soldiers in Europe.
There are distinct vignettes in the film, each one showing a small part of
the big picture. In that sense, the taking of Normandy is an important part
of the tour, and therefore, its depiction is not gratuitous. </P>
<P>The plot is that Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) must find and return
Private James Ryan (Matt Damon) to the States. Ryan's three brothers died in
combat and his mother received the news of all three deaths on the same day.
A general back in Washington, feeling sympathy for the mother and possibly
seeing an opportunity for some good P.R., ordered that James Ryan must be
saved. </P>
<P>But as I said, the film is not about its plot. It is about the war in
Europe, and more deeply, about the value of human life. The film follows
Miller from his landing at Normandy to the fields of northern France. From
the rainy town threatened by a sniper to the wreck of an American plane.
>From an isolated nest of German machine-gunners to the rubble-strewn bridge
in need of defending. </P>
<P>In each episode, Spielberg finds a way to explore the value of human life. </P>
<P>At Normandy, one soldier suggests that they hide behind the defenses on the
beach, because advancing costs so many lives. Miller points out that if they
don't advance, even more soldiers will die and it will have been for
nothing. By advancing, their lives buy two things: precious ground against
the Germans and more meaning, a higher value, if you will, for the lives of
those already killed.  </P>
<P>When Miller and his seven men learn of their mission to save Ryan, they are
outraged at the thought that so many lives should be risked for the sake of
just one. Yet Ryan's life is worth so much more, at least to his mother,
because his three brothers have died. An exponential curve is at work,
making the last son's life worth more than the first three combined. </P>
<P>At the site of the plane crash, we learn that 22 soldiers died because one
general wanted extra protection for himself. He ordered a steel plate to be
welded to the plane under his seat to protect him from flak. But the weight
of the steel made the plane fly "like a freight train," and the pilot was
forced to crash-land, killing and wounding dozens of soldiers in the process. </P>
<P>While talking to his men one night, Miller recounts the number of lives lost
under his command. He believes there must be a formula, some factor by which
each lost life can be multiplied, whose product is the number of other lives
saved. Losing 96 men must mean that at least 960 other lives were saved.
True or not, it is one way Miller can assuage his guilt. </P>
<P>In one of the film's most interesting dilemmas, a single German gunner
remains alive after a battle. Most of Miller's men want to kill the German,
slowly and painfully, but, as Upham (Jeremy Davies, in a very interesting
role) points out, that would be against the rules. They cannot take him
prisoner because he would hinder their mission, so Miller must weigh the
moral costs of killing an unarmed man against the possibility that, once
released, he might live to kill more U.S. soldiers, perhaps even Miller's
own men. </P>
<P>The movie is very well made. That's not surprising considering the skill of
the director. Thankfully, this time Spielberg refrained from including his
sermon and his directorial signature. InAMISTAD, there were signs throughout
the movie that reminded you what a clever director Spielberg was. It was
downright distracting. In SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, there are no directorial
flourishes, just good filmmaking. </P>
<P>During battle scenes, the camera is hand-held. The picture is jittery, but
not blurry. It's as though Spielberg and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski
used a camera with a very fast shutter speed, or else shot at double speed,
then used every other frame. I can't say what the intent of this was, but it
made the film feel sharper, edgier, less soft. </P>
<P>The film also pays very close attention to sound, making us feel much closer
to the events on screen. As Miller prepares for the invasion of Normandy,
the landing boat's motors are clear and distinct. It's a detail that makes
the scene seem mundane and real, not heroic and romanticized. For a time the
camera goes underwater and the sound becomes more distant, more dreamlike,
but as soon as it breaks the surface, the nasty whizzing of bullets and
screams of dying men return. At two points in the movie, the sound takes the
point of view of Miller, mentally and aurally drifting away from the
battlefield, before coming back to insistent reality. </P>
<P>Finally, the casting of Tom Hanks as Captain Miller was an extraordinary
stroke of genius. At first he seems unlikely to lead a pack of soldiers in a
war movie. He's too much the nice guy. His voice is a gentle tenor instead
of a cussing bass. And yet, that seems to be exactly the point that
Spielberg was making in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN: that World War II was fought by
normal, everyday men. There were gruff generals and posturing politicians,
but the men on the front lines were average Joes with wives, jobs, and rose
bushes back home. And that makes the violence of the battle scenes all the
more horrifying, the cost of 96 lives all the more painful. </P>
<P>One final comment is worth making. I believe this film raises the level of
acceptable graphic violence in mainstream movies. Soldiers are disemboweled,
decapitated, and blown to bits on screen. Perhaps the most difficult scene
is a closeup of a German soldier slowly and gently stabbing a G.I. in the
heart. It is hard to imagine this film getting anything less than an X
rating as little as a decade ago, yet it got an R rating from the MPAA on
the first try. Spielberg handles the subject matter well. He deals with a
gruesome subject matter honestly and appropriately. One scene reminds us not
to treat death lightly, even when it is too widespread to be comprehended.
No scene glorifies the mass slaughter of enemy soldiers. Still, the standard
has been raised, and the next war movie will have to be even more gruesome
to make its point. </P>
<P>Let us hope the next filmmaker will be as thoughtful, careful, and serious
as Spielberg.</P>
