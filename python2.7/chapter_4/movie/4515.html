<PRE>                        DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT may be
          marginally better than the other films we have seen
          from Mel Brooks in a decade, but he is trying too
          hard to imitate the Zucker Brothers rather than to
          write in the style of THE PRODUCERS and THE TWELVE
          CHAIRS.  Too many of his gags fall embarrassingly
          flat and he is not bothering to create characters
          the way he did in his early comedies.  This is a
          film that frequently shows visual style and keeps
          promising to be something, but in the end it did
          not care to deliver more than gags.  A few of the
          gags work.  Rating: high 0 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     It is faint praise, but DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT is the best
Mel Brooks comedy in quite a long while.  And for once he made a film
that without the humor might have been above average.  But some of the
nice visuals are just wasted here and the film remains only a very
mediocre effort with humor that is just too weak and mechanical to
carry the film.  The enema jokes and other unfunny run-on gags spoil
the few funny bits in this satire of three different film adaptations
of DRACULA.</P>
<P>     At one time Mel Brooks was a really good filmmaker with genuine
characters and a great sense of humor.  Consider the skill with which
he balanced personality with humor in THE PRODUCERS or the too-rarely-
seen TWELVE CHAIRS.  We have not seen much of that Mel Brooks in quite
a while.  Brooks's humor these days leans to cheap and easy gags,
scatological or just lame far too often.  And the weak humor sabotages
not only his own production values, but his better gags as well.
DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT is no YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, but it has a nice
visual sense and many of its jokes really are funny.  But Brooks needs
to get a better idea of which gags work and which fall flat.  In the
end this new film has too many jokes to work as a horror film and too
high a percentage of lame jokes for it to work as a comedy.</P>
<P>     DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT is basically a reworking of the 1931
screen version, itself a reworking of the John L. Balderston and
Hamilton Deane play.  That play, is a perennial favorite on the stage
and formed the basis of the 1931 Bela Lugosi and the 1979 Frank
Langella versions of DRACULA.  The Brooks film then recreates and
satirizes scenes from the Lugosi, the 1958 Christopher Lee DRACULA
(U.S. title: THE HORROR OF DRACULA), and the 1992 Gary Oldman BRAM
STOKER'S DRACULA.  There is even a quick nod to the 1921 NOSFERATU.
There is a nice recreation of the stairway and web sequence from the
1931 version and a beautiful recreation of the staking of Lucy from the
1958 version, even matching the odd color values.  It is in these two
scenes that the film has its best moments.  There are times when the
photography has an exaggerated dreamlike quality that really does work.
And the opening which takes us through famous graphic portrayals of
vampires is done with a great deal of style.  Unfortunately, these good
moments get lost in the film.</P>
<P>     By far not the smallest fault in the film is the transparent
casting of Leslie Nielson as Dracula.  Nielson's forte is playing
characters who are overly obvious like big children, while a quality of
mystery and otherworldlyness is necessary to play the famous vampire,
even in a comedy.  He is cast against type, and he plays against type.
If that was a gamble, it fails miserably, but more likely he is in the
film because of his associations with other films.  Harvey Korman as
Dr. Seward has more than a little Nigel Bruce in his performance.</P>
<P>     Brooks's writing has turned formulaic and that is slow death in
comedy.  He fills time in the film with pointless run-on gags that do
not seem to get any funnier with the repetition.  One of the run-on
gags only reaches its real point at the end of the credit sequence when
it plays mostly to empty seats--another example of where Brooks
misjudges his audience.  Too many of his jokes just end up a reference
to urine or feces as if that by itself is funny.  Also overused are
pratfalls.</P>
<P>     It is a sad state when all the best aspects of a Mel Brooks comedy
have little to do with the humor.  Brooks should take a look at what
made some of his early films so good and refresh his memory on the
difference between humor and gags.  The style of the film, perhaps
contributed by a good cinematographer, brings this one up to a high 0
on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
