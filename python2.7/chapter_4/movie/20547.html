<P>RUN LOLA RUN (LOLA RENNT) (Germany, 1998) *** Written and directed by 
Tom Tykwer. Photography, Frank Griebe. Editing, Mathilde Bonnefoy. 
Set design, Alexander Manasse. Music, Tom Tykwer, Johnny Klimek,

Potente (Lola), Moritz Bleibtreu (Manni), Herbert Knaup (Lola's 
father), Armin Rohde (Mr. Schuster), Joachim Krol ( the tramp Norbert 
von Au), Nina Petri (Mrs. Hansen), Heino Ferch (Ronnie). A Sony 
Pictures Classics release. 81 minutes. R (some merely "cartoonish" 
violence).</P>
<P>Overall applauded (but there are some naysayers too), Run Lola Run 
was probably made when its author was 32. Tom Tykwer had worked in 
TV, and in the realm of features had co-written a script, and wrote 
and directed two well received movies. Whether or not he'll prove to 
have been a "wunderkind" will depend on how much of his past output 
we can see (an unlikely occurrence) and what he will offer us next.</P>
<P>RLR is, at the very least, an interesting novelty, an unclassifiable 
work which is, above all, a stylistic exercise. The place is Berlin, 
though not identified as such and with no landmarks identifiable by 
strangers. Twenty-something Manni, a small-time courier for powerful 
mobsters boy is doing nicely and hopes to be promoted. But then the 
unexpected happens. Having delivered some goods to a buyer, and 
received 100,000 Deutschmarks (at this writing $ 52,356), he leaves 
his plastic bag in the subway when he makes a hurried exit to evade 
ticket inspectors. (OK, we all know that one always should keeps 
holding such loot with clenched fingers, but the film, being a 
fantasy, makes suspension of disbelief easy). If Manni returns 
empty-handed, the top mobster will doubtlessly kill him.</P>
<P>The panicked, hysterical young man phones his girlfriend Lola who 
asks him to wait 20 minutes until she gets there with the money -- 
which she does not have but somehow will get. She leaves her home, 
starts running, and runs and runs and runs.
She's in great physical form, but see above the part about suspension 
of disbelief. This also applies to the ground she covers in just 20 
minutes.</P>
<P>Manni is waiting for her outside a supermarket, which he said he 
would rob if Lola didn't get there on time. We keep track of this on 
a large clock which at the start showed 20 minutes to 12, and 
gradually, inexorably, suspensefully closes in on the fatal hour 
of12.  This is High Noon, Germanicized with a twist!</P>
<P>It's all over in 20 minutes. Which leaves us 60 more of film. What 
the director does with them is to start Scenario One all over again, 
work in--with meticulous and unpredictable spontaneity--small 
variations, increase them to larger ones. Then he  then backtracks 
and ends up with a different ending. The same goes for the 20-minute 
Scenario Three.</P>
<P>If I am cryptic it is that giving details, or even the main lines of 
the story (-ries) would be a killjoy. Especially since the movie's 
maker uses a full array of visual (and sound) tricks, from cartoons 
that connect to the action to split-screen, to pixillation, still 
shots, varying speeds, video, etc.</P>
<P>Lola in the running (and the stopping) process discovers a number of 
new things, mainly about her banker father and about herself. Again, 
I'll be cagey on the subject.</P>
<P>The Berlin of the film seems to be a sparsely populated, minor 
traffic city, which brought to my mind the title of the EricWolfgang 
Korngold opera The Dead City. I am guessing that the film must have 
been on Sundays or holidays. The relative emptiness of the sets makes 
it easy to keep track of Lola. Better yet, she can be always spotted 
by her distinctive, punkish hair painted flaming red-orange. The 
device is essentially similar to Haskell Wexler's, who made the 
classic Medium Cool (1969), a tour-de-force which dealt with the 
actual riots during the famous 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago. 
Using a great deal of documentary footage, it inserted Wexler's 
actors in the streets and the crowds. For the audience to identify 
immediately Verna Bloom, Haskell had her wear a bright yellow dress 
that always stood out.</P>
<P>How much of a love story RLR may be does not get pictured by overt 
sentiments. There is just one small interlude of the lovers talking 
in bed. Otherwise, it is the extremely kinetic nature of the film 
plus the fact that Lola will do anything to save Manni.</P>
<P>Humor has always been an iffy aspect of Teutonic cinema. It does 
exist here however, but in indirect and/or played-down ways which do 
not get into the cuteness or broad effects that we find in much of 
American films these days. The funniest gag may be of Lola stepping 
out of a bank with a stash of stolen money and facing a regiment of 
heavily armed police. She is taken for a customer and taken out of 
harm's way by solicitous lawmen. And the last line in the movie, 
spoken by Manni, is deliciously ironical.</P>
<P>RLR, beyond showing the fickle finger of fate, has no real depth, 
carries no significant dialogue, no realistic or symbolic weight. But 
it is fresh and inventive, has a good matching musical score, 
excellent camera work, original editing (that's what makes the 
movie), and a fine musical commentary. It has avoided such 
smart-aleck shoals as pedantry, pretentiousness, pseudo-philosophy, 
pseudo-populism, and so on. On the surface, it is a light-weight job 
that could baffle audiences partial to well-made, well-told 
narratives. But it's also very clever.</P>
