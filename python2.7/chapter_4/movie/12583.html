<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>A fellow critic, in his review of Godzilla, states his belief that his
opinion will not sway readers' decisions whether or not to see the
film.  I agree with that submission, although I think there will be a
lot of people out there reading reviews of Godzilla, wanting to see how
many critics agree or disagree with their opinions on what is perhaps
this summer's most-anticipated film.  Based on this assumption, I am
going to express my opinion in a manner which will hopefully convey that
I feel passionate about the words I have written here.</P>
<P>I hate Godzilla.  It's a film so bad that words like "incompetent" and
"wasteful" lose their meaning.  Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin are such
hacks, so devoid of talent and vision, that they simply throw away what
seem to be good ideas for films.  I was hesitant to admit this belief
until now:  Stargate is a mediocre wannabe sci-fi action flick with a
few interesting aspects and a nice cast.  Independence Day, their "best"
film, is exciting for the first half and at least in good humor (even if
it doesn't know it's awful) through the ludicrous and insipid second
half.  Godzilla, however, begins at the bottom of the "mediocre"
category and spirals quickly downward into a wretched pit of bad special
effects, shameless unoriginality, and possibly the worst script ever to
plague a film whose budget could retire the national debt.</P>
<P>In fact, there's almost nothing good to say about Godzilla.  There's
one scene that has Godzilla stomping full speed around the streets of
New York in pursuit of a taxi which contains our heroes; this segment is
a good action sequence.  Some of Matthew Broderick's lines are
fashionably executed, for he seems to be the only actor in the cast who
is fully aware of the fantastically bad dialogue that Emmerich and
Devlin have penned.  That, my friends, is the list of positives.  Seeing
as how the film is well over two hours, and that one scene and a few
lines of dialogue don't exactly fill the entire frame, I must now
explain to you that Godzilla is not just an intense disappointment, but
probably the worst film of 1998. </P>
<P>Maybe I should begin with a summary (though I have considered not doing
this, for it is apparent that I will have given the film more thought
than the two men responsible for it).  The film begins with an
insightful look at a bunch of lizards getting irradiated.  Later, big
cargo ships and smaller fishing boats are ravaged and pulled
underwater.  So, we are introduced to Nick Tatopoulos (Broderick), a
worm specialist who is called in to investigate some really big
footprints on a tropical island.  Pretty soon, the huge radioactive
lizard is taking his first steps in Manhattan, having fun knocking down
buildings and screaming at things that are, perhaps, too small for it to
see clearly (such as human beings).  Later, it turns out that Nick's
skills as a worm specialist are very helpful, for Godzilla is burrowing
under the city and laying eggs in Madison Square Garden.</P>
<P>That's the story.  It doesn't sound too bad, and I think a pretty
decent summer blockbuster could have emerged from it, as opposed to this
film, which unsuccessfully aspires to be referred to as "incompetent"
and "wasteful."  I suppose it's time to be concrete about all this, so
I'll begin with the least of its problems.  First, the soundtrack is
bad.  The music by David Arnold is not the least bit exciting or
original, and is often very mushy and sentimental in parts that are
supposed to be touching.  </P>
<P>There are no characters, and most of the acting is extremely mediocre
(not that anyone cares about acting in a film like this).  Broderick, as
I said, has his moments, because he understands the awfulness of the
dialogue.  Kevin Dunn is the worst of the bunch, playing the Head
Military Guy who refuses to listen to reason and just wants to shoot
missiles at Godzilla, and ultimately cause more damage to the city than
the creature itself.  Maria Pitillo, in one of the pointless subplots,
plays Nick's ex-girlfriend, and she tries very hard to change her facial
expression on several occasions.  Hank Azaria plays a cameraman and is
far less interesting than he was in any other film he's ever been in. 
Most perplexing is the presence of Jean Reno, who is part of a pointless
and time-consuming subplot regarding the French government (although I
do like it when he says, "Running would be a good idea," with a straight
face).</P>
<P>The rest of the problems with this wad of cinematic refuse are
equivalent in intensity and importance, so I'll just lay into the script
first.  I can't think of a worse screenplay than this one, and that
includes all the low-budget straight-to-video numbers that get aired in
the middle of the night on HBO.  It is humorless (although there are
many failed attempts at humor).  It is not thought-out, and most of the
dialogue sounds like it was written by middle-schoolers still trying to
get a firm hold on the language.  Example:  "They might escape out into
the city!"  Any competent screenwriter would notice that "escape out" is
redundant, and that "They might escape into the city!" would be the
correct statement.  Am I quibbling?  No, because the script is
jam-packed with this kind of sloppy writing.  It makes me wonder if they
proofread the script before filming it.  Better yet, I wonder if they
wrote the script down at any point in time.  Keep in mind that *two*
adults are responsible for this writing.</P>
<P>How about this -- some helicopters have Godzilla targeted with
heat-seeking missiles.  When he dodges them, and the missiles blow up
the Chrysler building (I'm having flashbacks of Independence Day . . . I
can't believe they ripped off their own film), the reason is that he's
colder than the buildings around them.  That must be because he's cold
blooded, because he's a lizard, right?  Well, cold blooded doesn't mean
that he's really cold, for even the smallest snake in the world would
have a higher body temperature than a concrete building in the rain. 
This film, in every aspect, is the result of carelessness and idiocy.  </P>
<P>And here's the final blow:  the special effects just aren't that
great.  The sequence I mentioned above is exciting and fairly
well-crafted, but everything else here is terrible.  Godzilla frequently
looks like a cartoon, such as in the underwater scene that is a direct
rip-off from Alien Resurrection.  There's a lengthy sequence in which
our heroes find the egg room, and this is lifted straight out of
Aliens.  Everything else in the film is a poor remake of Jurassic Park;
Godzilla itself looks just like the Tyrannosaurus, and all the baby
lizards hold striking resemblance to the raptors from that film.  Every
single sequence (note that -- every single sequence) is unoriginal,
complemented by mediocre-to-lousy special effects and drab direction. 
The film is not exciting, and not interesting, and lacks even a hint of
style and energy that even the silliest summer flicks always have.</P>
<P>Godzilla is unacceptable.  It is the worst big budget film of all time,
and it wins this title by a landslide.  Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin
are con artists, and coning is apparently the only kind of art they have
a handle on.  Understand this:  I love big-budget summer fare.  Recent
films like The Rock, The Fifth Element, and Contact are great
blockbusters that use big budgets to their advantages, and treat their
audience with respect.  Godzilla is a sloppy, boring film that delivers
none of what it promises.  I hate this film, and I hate that people are
going to flock to see it.  Certainly some will enjoy it, and I can't
stop that.  But I predict that most people will be disappointed in this
film.  I'm hoping that Emmerich and Devlin have spewed their last, for
this piece of crap retires all patience I once had for them.  </P>
