<P>My Fair Lady
<A HREF="http://www.ram.org/ramblings/movies/my_fair_lady.html">http://www.ram.org/ramblings/movies/my_fair_lady.html</A></P>
<P>/My Fair Lady/, released in 1964, is hailed as one of the greatest
films ever made and I had the opportunity to watch the remastered 30th
anniversary edition for the first time while spending Christmas at
Yosemite National Park.</P>
<P>The film is based on the story /Pygmalion/ (1912) by George Bernard
Shaw (the name refers to the King of Cyprus who fell in love with a
statue of his own making). Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) is an English
Linguistics Professor who takes on Eliza Doolittle (a beautiful Audrey
Hepburn) under his tutelage to change her from an unrefined flower girl
with a Cockney accent to a genteel who brings forth the majesty and
grandeur of the English language (which hasn't been used in America
for years) with every utterance. Higgins is a misogynistic bachelor
who pushes Eliza day and night, while wondering why a woman can't be
more like a man, so she can learn to speak properly.  Riding on
Eliza's success is a bet Higgins makes with his friend, Colonel Hugh
Pickering (Wilfred Hyde-White), wherein Higgins claims he will be able
to pass Eliza off as a Duchess in six months.  As Eliza and Higgins
train together, they become accustomed to each other even though it is
an abusive relationship on Higgins' part. Finally the inevitable
confrontation occurs: Eliza has surpassed the teacher's expectations,
but the teacher still considers her a common flower girl.  How does
one move forward in such a situation?</P>
<P>The script, by Alan Jay Lerner, retains Shaw's acerbic wit and
delicious irony and succeeds for that reason. Both the dialogue and
the song lyrics are crafted extremely well. The music itself has a few
high points but there are plenty of low ones as well.  The acting is
impeccable: Rex Harrison's role as a happy-but-cynical misanthrope
(his excuse for treating Eliza badly is that he doesn't treat anyone
any better) is played out extremely well. Audrey Hepburn's
transformation from a common girl to a cultured lady is extremely
convincing, particularly in terms of her accent (although her songs
were dubbed by Marni Nixon).  The supporting cast is excellent:
Eliza's father Alfred P. Doolittle is played in a irreverent and
charismatic manner by Stanley Holloway who gets some of the coolest
lines in the film and was my favourite character; Jeremy Brett shows a
bit of the talent that would later come in handy when he played
Sherlock Holmes; and Gladys Cooper as Henry Higgins' mother also gets
to deliver a few barbed lines of her own ("Henry, what a disagreeable
surprise").</P>
<P>Even though the film's tongue is firmly in its cheek, the degree of
social commentary that occurs amidst the happy songs and the
straight-forward story is amazing.  The film comments about the
British class system, class systems in general, and the notion of
language being the reason for there being a class division (an almost
Universal concept prevalent in any culture). Further the movie
addresses the virtues of being "civilised" (when Eliza becomes a lady,
all she can do is sell herself), the virtues of morality when one has
nothing to left to lose (as Eliza's father says, he can't afford it),
and the repressed nature of British society in general.</P>
<P>The direction by George Cukor is amazing: the use of pausing
characters, the fantasy of Eliza thinking about Higgins' death, the
detached race track scene (with the classic "move your bloomin' arse"
line), and the use of novel devices to measure Eliza's speech, which
is a tangent on its own and done as a throwaway, are brilliant.  The
remastered audio and video brings the film to a vibrant life, with the
latter presenting an extremely colourful and bright Technicolour look
that is not seen in movies today.</P>
<P>I still think Higgins gets away too easily considering the poor way he
treats Eliza, reflecting the mentality of the era the movie was
made. At about three hours, the movie is a little too long, but is
great to watch with a date or as a group event. I highly recommend it.</P>
