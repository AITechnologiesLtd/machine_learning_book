<PRE>FACE/OFF    A Film Review By Jesse A. Kaplan</PRE>
<P>Cast:  Nicholas Cage, John Travolta, Joan Allen, Alessandro Nivola, Gina
Gershon, Dominique Swain
Directed By John Woo</P>
<P>        To tell you what, I was not impressed at all by the only other
John Woo film I have seen.  Starring Travolta, BROKEN ARROW was a
mediocre action movie at best, and I really could have cared less about
anything when I saw it.  Not ture here.  I went into FACE/OFF expecting
the same and was blown away!!      This is by far, one of the best films
of the year.  Amazing action sequences, stunts, explosions, some hott
girls, and (is this the best thing?)  Characterization!!!!!</P>
<P>John Travolta (PULP FICTION, PHENOMENON) stars as Sean Archer, leader of
an L.A. Anti-terrorist squad.  He is still working to find and kill
Castor Troy, Nicholas Cage (THE ROCK, CON-AIR).  Cage, you see, had
killed Archer's son several years back and his life hasn't been the same
since.  After an amazing shoot out involving aiplaones and hangars, Troy
is captured as is his brother Pullocks (Nivola).  However everything is
fine from peachy as Castor has planted a bomb somewhere in L.A. and
Archer has no idea how to find it.
    So, the doctors recommend switching faces, so Archer can be at jail
as Troy to find out where the bomb is.  In a rediculous sequence,
Travolta and Cage switch faces.  However Cage is left without one and is
out like a light.  Prolems begin when Cage wakes up and is able to get
Travolta's face on him, then he kills the medical staff.  The movie
really takes off from there and let me tell you, Cage deserve's an
Acadamy Award Nomination for this one.  First he is the evil cold heated
villian Troy, then he must win back our hearts as Archer.  Not that
Travolta good either, he certainly had fun.</P>
<P>        Joan ALlen plays Archer's wife who is confused and hen scared as
she slowly realizes the man she's living with is not her husband.
Dominique Swain is great as Archer's misunderstood daughter.  And Gina
Gershon (remember SHOWGIRLS) gives a good performance as Troy's
ex-girlfriend, who tells Cage (as Archer) that her son is his.</P>
<P>    The action sequences here are memorable.  One of the best includes
Gerhon's son listening to "Over the Rainbow" as a fight goes on all
around him.  ANother includes a mexican standoff in a church, complete
with the doves and the whole megillah.</P>
<P>    The only prob's i had with FACE/OFF is that its about 25 minutes too
long,  Just when you think its over, there is another chase scene
involving speed boats, etc.  This scene is actually better then the
entire movie of SPEED 2.  Thats another stor yall together though.</P>
<P>FACE/OFF runs way too long at 2:20. It is rated R for violence and
language.  See it, but check your brain at the door.  *** 1/2</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
  *** = Good show. Look for it.
    ** = Average movie. Kind of enjoyable.
      * = Poor show. Don't waste your money.
      0 = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
