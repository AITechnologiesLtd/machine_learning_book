<PRE>                                     JADE
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     A few short weeks ago I posed the question, "What is Joe Eszterhas
going to do next (after SHOWGIRLS)?"  Well, this is it:  JADE, a horrid
little thriller about a whole bunch of obsessive-compulsive crazies,
some of whom may be murderers.</P>
<P>     Actually, I wish it was that simple.  Perennial bad-girl Linda
Fiorentino plays Trina Gavin, a sultry psychologist with a questionable
past.  Chazz Palminteri is her sicko attorney husband Matt, and David
Caruso plays assistant D.A. David Corelli, who is assigned to look into
the murder of a wealthy art collector to whom everyone seems to be
linked ... especially Trina.</P>
<P>     What follows is a convoluted delving into a prostitution ring, one
backstabbing after another, some raunchy sex, and a whole slew of sick
obsessions, each of which seems to outdo the last one.  You realize
pretty quickly that no one is innocent in JADE, and it soon becomes
clear that the identity of the real killer is unimportant--*all* of
these people should be locked up.</P>
<P>     A bunch of annoying characters combined with a bad script conspire
to give us a thriller that isn't particularly thrilling.  Except for
one awesome car chase through the hilly streets of San Francisco and
through a parade in Chinatown, there's very little to redeem this
feature.  Director William Friedkin previously won a slew of awards for
directing THE FRENCH CONNECTION, and seems to have found his calling in
car chases.  Unfortunately, CONNECTION was made in 1971, and while
Friedkin's direction still has style, it ain't what it used to be.</P>
<P>     It's really a shame that a cast of genuinely great actors would
get together and star in such a poor film.  Palminteri looks simply
ragged in JADE, obviously not happy to be there.  Even supermodel Angie
Everhart, in her motion picture debut, is wasted--spending her entire
screen time being chased and beaten up.</P>
<PRE>     It's funny.  That's how *I* felt.</PRE>
