<P>Let's begin by saying that I am heartily sick and tired of post-modern,
cleverly designed horror/slasher flicks which try to comment on the whole
slasher genre, only to end up becoming what it is that they are pretending to
satirize. The year 1998 had the following in store: "Urban Legend," "I Still
Know What You Did Last Summer," "Halloween H20," and "Bride of Chucky." The
latter has the same degree of self-awareness, considering there's one shot of
someone watching a clip from "The Bride of Frankenstein." </P>
<P>"Child's Play" is one of the better horror films at around the time of
"Halloween 4" and "Monkey Shines." It unfolds at a quick pace with some tense,
scary scenes. The best scene is when the mother picks up the package that the
doll came in, and the batteries fall on the floor! Oops! How can the doll speak
without batteries? When she threatens to throw the doll into the fireplace, the
doll's face contorts into the angry, evil Charles and emits some Exorcist-like
obscenities: "You filthy slut!", and so on, and so forth. </P>
<P>"Child's Play," however, has some unbelievable moments that hinder the tension
towards the end. For example, the suave cop who shot Charles Lee Ray
disbelieves the kids stories about the doll speaking and giving orders, and he
disbelieves the mother after she's obviously been attacked (she's bitten on the
arm). Then the cop is attacked by Chucky, and curiously, when he sees the kids
mother afterwards, he doesn't even tell her that he was attacked! Why not?
That's hard to swallow, and it is unlikely that such a doll would travel
through the cold city of Chicago unnoticed, but that's a trivial complaint. The
ending, as effective as it is, is a cross between "Terminator" and "Halloween,"
where the killer just keeps rising back from supposed death. They could have
easily blown the doll to kingdom come, so you can see why it was stupid to make
two inferior sequels about the same damn Chucky doll. </P>
<P>"Child's Play" is done the old-fashioned way (even for an 80's horror movie) by
not including a high body count or any needless gore- the movie builds its
suspense with thrills and chills. The performances are decent and most
importantly, we care about the characters' plight. Although it doesn't come
close to the unrelenting terror of the voodoo doll episode in "Trilogy of
Terror," "Child's Play" is still better than most recent horror flicks. Oh
yeah, and there are no clever post-modernist jokes. </P>
