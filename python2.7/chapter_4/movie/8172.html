<P>Carlo Ponti and Joseph E. Levine, the producers of Jean-Luc Godard's
"Contempt", were eager to make a commercial film that would appeal to
a broad audience, while simultaneously exploiting their "edgy" young
director's notoriety. They were interested in a "product" that would
sell both in art-houses and in shopping malls. Godard resisted them
every step of the way and turned the film itself into a brilliant
satire on Hollywood stupidity and greed, including the bottom-line
mentality of his producers.</P>
<P>"Contempt" is about the making of a new version of Homer's Odyssey. A
crude and venal American producer named Jerry Prokosch (Jack Palance)
has arrived in Rome to assemble a crew that can realize his new vision
of the epic. While the director Fritz Lang--played brilliantly by
himself--wants to film ancient Greek sculptures of the gods to
accompany the action, Prokosch dictates that there should be nude
mermaids instead. Joseph E. Levine himself had achieved some success
in Hollywood making trashy versions of Greek and Roman myths. These
inevitably featured body-builders playing gods and heroes, scantily
dressed actresses and the most ridiculous sorts of plots. The analogy
between Prokosch's vision of the Odyssey and the producer's prior
efforts could not have been lost on Levine. Tensions ran high on the
set of "Contempt", according to press reports of the time.</P>
<P>Prokosch hires a young novelist and Communist Party member Paul Javel
(Michel Piccoli) to crank out a screenplay that would cater to popular
tastes. Javel is only too happy to please the Hollywood producer who
can pay him the money he needs to finish the work on his new
apartment. In the opening scenes of the film we observe Paul making
love to his wife Camille played by Bridgette Bardot in their bedroom.
She asks him "Do you think my feet are beautiful?" and the camera pans
in on her feet. As she repeats the question about her thighs, breasts
and buttocks, the camera dutifully and clinically pans in on each body
part. The scene is studiously anti-erotic.</P>
<P>Just as Prokosch instructed Lang to include plenty of nude mermaids,
Levine and Ponti had urged Godard to show the sex-goddess Bardot
unclothed. It was good for the box-office they told him. Godard, ever
the rebel, gave them the nudity they wanted but made it so antiseptic
as to subvert their intentions.</P>
<P>In a long scene that constitutes the entire middle section of the
film, Paul and Camille have a marital squabble that leads to their
separation. Paul believes that sexual jealousy has sparked the fight.
In the preceding scene, Prokosch has made a play for Camille while she
has caught him in the act of fondling Prokosch's beautiful young
assistant. But it is not sexual jealousy that is the cause of their
estrangement. It is rather her loss of respect for him as an artist.</P>
<P>The film gives Godard plenty of opportunity to take knocks at the
Carlo Pontis and Joseph E. Levines of the world. Prokosch tells his
screen-writer Paul and his director Fritz Lang that "Whenever I hear
the word 'culture,', I reach for my checkbook." This is an allusion to
Nazi culture minister Joseph Goebbels' famous remark about hearing the
word "culture" and reaching for his gun. The background to this is
interesting since Joseph Goebbels offered Lang the job of supervising
German film production in 1933. He responded by fleeing into exile--a
choice (and true story) that Godard relates in the film.</P>
<P>For Godard, the comparison between Hollywood and Nazi Germany is of
real significance. In 1963, when the film was made, the United States
had not only achieved global economic and military dominance, it also
had begun to enforce its cultural standards on the rest of the world
as well. Godard had become disillusioned by the crisis facing both the
American and European film industries. The American studio system was
collapsing and could no longer support the creative vision of
"auteurs" like John Ford or Howard Hawks who had strongly influenced
French "nouvelle vague" criticism and film-making.</P>
<P>Godard's had a love-hate relationship for American popular culture.
Although he clearly despised the sort of commercialism that Joseph E.
Levine represented, there were continual reminders of his affection
for its icons. Paul Javel wears a fedora and smokes cigarettes during
the entire film, even while bathing, because as he tells his wife, he
wants to look like Dean Martin in "Some Came Running". Godard even
considered casting Frank Sinatra and Kim Novak in the roles of Paul
and Camille at one point. His hatred was toward the moguls in
Hollywood, not working professionals like himself.</P>
<P>"Contempt", above all, is a film about irony. The irony of a Communist
screen-writer turning out commercial schlock. The irony of his sex
kitten wife Camille rejecting him for his failure as an artist rather
than as a lover. Perhaps the least ironic figure in the film is Fritz
Lang himself who Godard had a deep respect for. The fact that Lang's
heroic period as a director was of the 1920s and 1930s did not
diminish his stature in Godard's eyes. But Godard could not completely
block out what had happened to Lang, even in his own film: "It's
always a bit sad when I see Lang in the film. He was touched that the
young filmmakers admired him, but it was mostly because he needed
money that he accepted."</P>
<P>This sense of disillusionment, of betrayed hopes, of contempt for
oneself for being part of the capitalist nexus is distinctly modern.
Godard, more than any film-maker, introduced this mood into the
culture of the 1960s. He influenced a wide range of artists, from the
sublime (Martin Scorsese comes to mind--he is responsible for the
release of this film to the public for the first time in 30 years) to
the ridiculous (Quentin Tarentino). The optimistic and socially-minded
films of the 1930 and 40s were no longer possible since there was no
historical agency capable of being the protagonist. The "Grapes of
Wrath" could no longer be made. By the same token, the bitter "noir"
films of the 1950s had run their course as well. Their
anti-heroes--gangsters, drifters, cheats--were no longer relevant
since the urban setting that provided their milieu had begun to
disappear. Gone were the lonely hotel rooms looking out at blinking
neon lights. They were replaced by sun-drenched suburban tracts and
swimming-pools.</P>
<P>Godard's film is a masterpiece. Currently it is being shown at the
Film Forum in New York City, but there is every likelihood that it
will appear on the art theater circuit. It is not to be missed.</P>
