<PRE>                       THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT
                       A film review by Mike Joyce
                        Copyright 1997 Mike Joyce</PRE>
<P>Larry Flynt is a self proclaimed smut pedlar and the owner/publisher of the
multi-million dollar Hustler Publications company. The People vs. Larry
Flynt is the story of Larry Flynt's fight for the freedom to circulate and
sell his pornographic magazine, Hustler. Based on a true story, the film is
almost a documentary in that it's a very vivid and detailed look at Larry
Flynt's life.</P>
<P>Woody Harrelson gives an excellent performance. He conveys Flynt's
peculiarities and his character with depth and focus. By the end of the
film the audience actually finds themselves, somewhat grudgingly, liking
Larry Flynt. This is some feat given Flynt's apparent lack of any morals or
ethics and his extremely smutty and childish behaviour in court. However,
Flynt has a number of things going for him, he's rich, he's funny, and most
importantly, he says exactly what he means.</P>
<P>Larry Flynt's wife, Althea Leasure is played by Courtney Love. Larry meets
Althea at one of his clubs, and they fall in love (a very sexual and open
love). Both of them indulge in a world of too much sex, and eventually too
much drugs. Flynt had been taking an excessive amount of pain killers after
being paralysed from the waist down (which was especially upsetting for
him) by an assassin. Althea had joined him in taking the drugs. Following
an operation Flynt decides to stop taking drugs, Althea does not have any
such plans, nor the determination to follow them. As the film progresses we
see her become increasingly frail and sick. Courtney Love obviously has a
great understanding for Althea's situation, as she is brilliant in
portraying Althea in every respect. It's extremely sad to watch Althea
literally wither away.</P>
<P>Edward Norton plays Flynt's lawyer, Alan Isaacman. Again, this is a solid
performance. The audience finds it easy to sympathise with Isaacman who
somehow puts up with Flynt's courtroom antics. Flynt is not only childish
in the courtroom, but downright rude to the judges, and lands himself in a
lot of trouble (and even in a mental institution) because of it. Isaacman
is very easy to like, and great at proving (in quite clever ways) his
points to the court.</P>
<P>Milos Forman has done a great job in directing The People vs. Larry Flynt.
It is not really an exciting or thrilling film, but instead a highly
interesting portrayal of a true story. Due to Larry's character it is also,
at times, a very funny film. However, it is much more than that. It is
about the fight for freedom of speech, anti-censorship, and the right to be
able choose for oneself what to see and buy. An excellent look at Flynt,
his life, and his story. Keep a look out for the real Larry Flynt who makes
a cameo as Judge Morrissey.</P>
<PRE>4.5 out of 5</PRE>
