Rated R</P>
<P>"Magnolia" is the strangest kind of masterpiece, one that's both frustrating
and enthralling at the same time. Is it confusing? Almost certainly. But
there's a reason. "Magnolia" is the kind of film that wants to challenge
you, that assumes that you, the viewer, do indeed have a brain, and you do
know how to use it. Paul Thomas Anderson's film is not one to lay everything
out neatly for you. It's for this reason that "Magnolia" is consistently
maddening, but where that is usually a criticism, here it's oh so right.
Why? Because the film dares to surprise, to keep pulling the rug out from
under us. It is certainly not your typical film, and as such, it's not for
everyone. But to those who enjoy a challenging film open to more than one
interpretation, "Magnolia" is a dazzling experience. You don't see films as
ambitious and audacious as this one come along too often.</P>
<P>This film interlocks the stories of several apparently disparate characters
in the San Fernando Valley. First we have dying TV mogul Earl Partridge
(Jason Robards), who wastes away under the care of his gold-digging wife
Linda (Julianne Moore) and hired nurse Phil (Philip Seymour Hoffman). We are
introduced to a children's game show called "What Do Kids Know?" hosted by
veteran TV man Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall), who like Earl, is dying of
cancer. The current "whiz kid" on the show is Stanley Spector (Jeremy
Blackman), a young man pushed to succeed by his overbearing father. The
former whiz kid was Donnie Smith (William H. Macy), now a grown man whose
life is in a shambles. He loses his job and considers resorting to a life of
crime. Gator's daughter is cocaine-addicted Claudia (Melora Walters), who
finds herself attracted to Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly), a seemingly stable
beat cop. Earl's long-lost son turns out to be misogynist speaker Frank T.J.
Mackey (Tom Cruise), who teaches men how to better disrespect women because,
in his view, they don't respect men. The stories twist in and out of one
another in more ways than I could possibly explain here, but let's just say
many of them are rather unpredictable.</P>
<P>The most noticeable strong point of "Magnolia" is the bravura acting engaged
in by the entire cast. Your personal opinion of which performance is the
best may depend mostly on what you thought of the characters they played,
but there really aren't any weak links here. Everyone pulls his or her
weight. My personal favorite was John C. Reilly, whose cop balances a
fatherly impulse with deeper insecurities masterfully. As such, his
unconventional romance with the drug-addicted Walters seems positively
touching. His impulse is not to act as a policeman and bust her for
narcotics possession, but to help her escape the problem. Tom Cruise is
extremely well-cast as the self-important motivational speaker. His
breakdown to a female reporter during an interview is astoundingly
deliberate, with the reporter methodically wearing down Frank's false
bravado by pulling out revelations from his past. The only point where
Cruise really stumbles is in his final big scene, when he's forced to cry on
Robards' deathbed, and he displays that he hasn't quite got the acting chops
to pull it off. After excelling at playing freaks and weirdos, Hoffman
finally gets to play a more well-adjusted human being and does it very
convincingly. Macy does his usual chameleon job into the former quiz kid who
wants braces because he thinks they'll make him more attractive to his
favorite bartender. Moore has what's probably the most underwritten part,
but beefs it up with sheer force of talent. Her character is one-note, but
her performance is quite accessible. The veterans-Robards and Hall-inhabit
decaying forms with ease, with Hall's on-air breakdown being on of the more
fascinating scenes in the film. There are several I haven't mentioned, but
rest assured, they did fine work. No weak links.</P>
<P>After his critically-lauded hit "Boogie Nights," Paul Thomas Anderson seems
to have been given the freedom to follow his own vision, and "Magnolia" is
it. Anderson's vision is sprawling and confused, excitingly and wonderfully
so. The major stylistic point of interest is Anderson's decision to throw
standard three-act film structure out the window in favor of a more
musically-oriented construction. An article in "Entertainment Weekly" quoted
the director as saying that he drew greatly from The Beatles' "A Day in the
Life" for his film's structure. Such influence is evident in the way
"Magnolia" climaxes twice, each being preceded by a long and deliberate
buildup. The first climax occurs around the middle of the film, when many of
the major characters experience a certain public or private deflowering.
Gator collapses on his game show. Stanley has an on-air "accident." Frank is
exposed in an interview. And so on. Any old film might have then rushed to a
conclusion, but "Magnolia" is not any old film. Instead of a resolution, we
get a drop-off, and the tension starts building again. (With regards to the
Beatles reference, this is where Paul McCartney starts singing "Woke up, got
out of bed, dragged the comb across my head.") Then it climaxes again in a
wondrously bizarre scene that will have audiences talking for weeks. To
reveal it would be a crime, but it does serve a purpose other than to shock.
It ties together the film's themes in one fell swoop.</P>
<P>It's necessary because the themes present in "Magnolia" are not up front for
all to see. They can be seen in the subtle Biblical references (Exodus 8:2
is everywhere, but you have to look closely), in the vague connections
between characters, and in the film's clever opening sequence. "Magnolia"
starts with a narrator (Ricky Jay) relating three supposedly true stories of
chance occurrences. Coincidence and happenstance are recurring themes
throughout the film, with the final climax being the mother of all chance
occurrences. The most important thing to remember about "Magnolia's"
surprise finish is that it is not randomly inserted to test the audience's
reflexes. Jay narrates that these chance occurrences do not happen randomly;
they happen for a reason. The final scene seems to help certain characters
meet their destiny, to get other characters to meet when they might not have
otherwise. It also relates to another major recurring theme: family dynamics
and father-son relationships in particular. It seems a warning to many of
the film's characters not to repeat the sins of the past. Will the message
connect? That is left for us to decide.</P>
<P>It would be pointless to list all of Anderson's technical brilliance,
because it is all there, just like we saw in "Boogie Nights." He ties images
and music together seamlessly (with a nice assist from Aimee Mann), he is
remarkably able to intercut scenes together without losing coherence, and
his film manages to remain consistently interesting, despite the three hour
running time. But the most impressive aspect of "Magnolia" is how complex
Anderson's vision is. Is it perfect? That's kind of hard to decide. As is
often the case with films that tell many interconnecting narratives all at
once, different audience members are sure to find some characters intriguing
and others annoying, but which characters those are stems mostly from
personal preference than anything else. What we have here is a film whose
conviction manages to overshadow its flaws (I was mildly annoyed by Robards'
deathbed soliloquy and Moore's one-note drug addict), and one whose themes
are varied and challenging. If someone were to ask me just what was the
point of "Magnolia," I would reply that there isn't one. There are many.</P>
