<PRE>             THE WONDERFUL HORRIBLE LIFE OF LENI RIEFENSTAHL
                       A film review by Guy Berliner
                        Copyright 1994 Guy Berliner</PRE>
<P>Note: This film has also appeared in American theaters under the title,
THE WONDERFUL, HORRIBLE LIFE OF LENI RIEFENSTAHL (1994).  The original
German title, DIE MACHT DER BILDER: LENI RIEFENSTAHL (1993)</P>
<P>     Ray Muller has created in DIE MACHT DER BILDER: LENI RIEFENSTAHL
(LENI RIEFENSTAHL: THE POWER OF THE IMAGE), a sweeping documentary on
the life of the world's most famous woman film director.  Leni
Riefenstahl is an extraordinary and enigmatic woman by any measure.
Starting as a dancer in the 1920's Weimar Republic, she was inspired by
a poster for Fanck's DER BERG DES SCHICKSALS (MOUNTAIN OF DESTINY) to
see the film, and became so captivated by this new genre of epic
mountaineering films that she begged for a role from the director.
>From this she went on to direct her own films in this genre, among them
DAS BLAUE LICHT (THE BLUE LIGHT).  As the Third Reich took hold over
Germany in the '30's, the talented, attractive young lady director did
not escape the attention of the luminaries of the new regime.  As
Riefenstahl watched many of her friends and colleagues in pre-Hitler
German filmmaking leave the country, she stayed on, seemingly unaware
of the turmoil that was to come.  Muller does a good job of probing
Riefenstahl's perceptions of this period.  Riefenstahl viewed Hitler as
just a good patriot who would bring the economy around, put Germans
back to work, and follow egalitarian social policies.  She completely
overlooked the "master race" rhetoric, and chose to believe that that
was not really a central component of Hitler's ideology.  Through
Muller's questioning, we see a defensive Riefenstahl, whose political
naivete is convincing.  But we also see a Riefenstahl who has still not
come to terms with her own moral duplicity.  Riefenstahl convinces us
that she never liked Hitler's more odious propaganda or his vicious
agenda for German supremacy.  In 1934, Riefenstahl made one of the most
famous propaganda films of all times, DER TRIUMPH DES WILLENS (Triumph
of the Will), on the occasion of a Nazi party congress in Nuremberg.
She points out correctly that this film was the only major propaganda
piece she ever produced for the Nazis, and only after much resistance
on her part and the personal pleading of Hitler himself.  She also
demonstrates that the film contained no references to race propaganda
and, far from proclaiming Hitler's belligerent demands for
"Lebensraum," portrays a Hitler who calls for "peace and brotherhood."
She even plausibly defends herself when Muller confronts her with a
telegram she wired to Hitler on the occasion of his lightning conquest
of France in 1940.  The telegram is filled with rapturous praise and
the words, "My fuehrer, no one can equal the greatness of your deeds!"
Riefenstahl, in an interview with Muller, says: "I was ecstatic because
I thought this terrible war would be ended by this stroke! I just
wanted peace and I thought this would bring it!"</P>
<P>     But while Riefenstahl offers us a plausible defense when
confronted with some questions, she is less willing to admit to that
central human failing:  ambition, and the complicity in the crimes of a
murderous regime that it can lead to.  Muller quotes for her extensive
passages from the diaries, dated circa 1932-33, of Josef Goebbels,
Hitler's propaganda minister, detailing his intimate hobnobbing with
various noted German celebrities, including the attractive young
Fraulein Riefenstahl.  When confronted with this evidence, Riefenstahl
outright denies she had anything to do with Goebbels.  She says she
loathed Goebbels, and made early enemies with him, and that all the
quoted passages are fabrications of Goebbels' fevered imagination, or
lies.  These are obviously none too credible charges in light of the
elaborate details Goebbels includes, and the fact that these diaries
were never intended for public consumption.</P>
<P>     Through it all, though, the central theme of Muller's film is not
politics, but aesthetics.  We are convinced by Riefenstahl because she
is a person who is obviously too obsessed with art and aesthetic
perfection to give politics much attention.  As she describes DER
TRIUMPH DES WILLENS, probably her most famous film, she talks mainly of
the many small details which make it the artistic masterpiece that,
ironically, garnered top prize at the Paris Film Festival for that
year.  The politics of the film are, for her, mainly an afterthought.
Having been finally convinced to make the film after great reluctance,
she threw herself into the task with all her creative energies.  Her
"triumph" in this film was in turning what was, after all,  mainly a
parade of talking heads, yelling, screaming, and marching--maybe
exciting if you were there but not a recipe for an exciting film--into
an epic drama of movement.</P>
<P>     Her next great epic documentary, made for the 1936 Olympic Games
in Berlin, was OLYMPIA, another international award-winning film.  She
describes the techniques she used to bring to life the toil of the
athletes, the astounding perseverance of the runners, continuing on and
on in the face of utter physical exhaustion.  In the clips shown, we
see some of the most powerful imagery in the history of sports.  She
describes how she used daring and unprecedented techniques to get these
shots: the trenches she dug in the fields to get unusual angles, the
reversal of the film at certain points to give the divers the
extraordinary appearance of effortless flight, and so on.  This is a
fascinating inside look at the methods of one the great pioneers of
documentary filmmaking.</P>
<P>     Finally, we are ever amazed at the breadth of this woman who,
suffering ostracism and universal scorn in the postwar era as a
"collaborator," managed to pull off a second birth as world traveler,
ethnographer, and underwater photographer.  In the sixties, Riefenstahl
took an abiding interest in the lives and art of the native peoples of
the Sudan.  Taking many trips and eventually spending several years
living full time among the Nuba tribespeople, she captured rare
archival footage of Nuba life and became acquainted first hand with
these people as no European or other outsider had done before.  At the
age of seventy (she is now in her nineties), she got her scuba
certification so she could photograph rare marine life in exotic places
around the world.  Probably the oldest scuba diver in the world, she
had to lie about her age to get her certification!  Concerned about the
perils of pollution, overfishing, and environmental degradation on the
world's sea life, she has joined Greenpeace.</P>
<P>     Muller himself, appropriately enough, has made a documentary
worthy of one of the world's great documentarians.  This film's own
striking attributes include an unforgettable opening scene which is
surely one of the most discordant and dramatic to appear in a
documentary.</P>
