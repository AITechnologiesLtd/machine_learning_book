<P>   Some 30 years ago a couple of colleagues of mine, high
school teachers like me, bought homes in Matawan, New
Jersey where writer-director David Maquiling last year filmed
"Too Much Sleep."  They encouraged me to do likewise
since, after all, for $19,000 they were getting spanking new
digs built by Levitt complete with refrigerators and washing
machines.  I was young and naive and spouted the usual
urban nonsense about the suburbs as homogenized,
uninteresting, sterile places where all your associates are just
like you, but one of my pals took issue with me with the
argument, "My next-door neighbor is Japanese!"  So much for
my theories about homogeneity.  What Mr. Maquiling is trying
to bring out in "Too Much Sleep" is, well, it could be just
about anything.  He might want to tell us that within those
prettily manicured, conventional, uniform blades of grass lie
some of the most biazarre people, folks you might even find
in the heart of Manhattan.  He could be putting his original
touch on the folk tales of his native Philippine Islands, as he
tells us in the press notes.  But mostly I'd guess that he's
displaying a young man's fast odyssey from naivete and sloth
to activity and concern just like the David Hemmings
character in Antonioni's "Blowup."</P>
<P>   He doesn't really succeed, though, in part because there's
no way that his key figure could possibly grow up in such a
short time.  His experiences are shallow.  What's more the
gun is falsely utilized to symbolize manhood--a maturity that
its 24-year-old owner does not really have but has to earn.  If
that's what Mr. Maquiling is attempting here, he's pushing
the envelope quite a bit past its comfortable margins.</P>
<P>  Let's take the weight from Mr. Maquiling's shoulders and
presume that he's simply writing a shaggy-dog story about
his own youth in a bland American suburban neighborhood. 
He tells of Jack Crawford (Marc Palmieri), a night security
guard who carries an unlicensed gun which he inherited from
his father.  Riding a bus one day, he is scammed into losing
the piece and suspects two women riding next to him; the
older Judy (Judo Sabo Podinker) and the youthful Kate (Nicol
Zanzarella).  Rather than go to the police, he consults with
the town know-it-all, Eddie (Pasquale Gaeta), a motormouth
who brags endlessly about his affairs, his political standing
(he was deputy county clerk for 19 years), and his contacts
with both the police and the local criminal faction.  Eddie,
who prefaces a good many of his statements with "Let me tell
you something, Jack," advises him where to go and what to
do in his search for the revolver, an exploration which
supposedly leads Jack from a detached dude who lives with
his mother and sleeps in a childhood bed too small for his
over 6' body, to a committed, more manly character: a
mensch.  </P>
<P>   Critics have compared the movie thematically to the far
better David O. Russell "Spanking the Monkey," Stacey
Cochran's "My New Gun," also "Coldblooded" and "In the
Soup" and even David Lynch's "Blue Velvet," but the director
seems influenced most by Martin Scorsese's "After Hours"
which features an ordinary guy who goes through a series of
bizarre experiences during one night in New York City.  Like
the Griffin Dunne character in the film, Jack is the about the
only normal person in "Too Much Sleep."  The others are like
those we try to avoid like the plague.  Who wants to spend
15 minutes with a blabber like Eddie or listen to the jabbering
of a woman who runs into Jack at the bus terminal and
lectures him about how much he looks like his father--while
not recognizing that Jack's looking all around the room
signifies his lack of interest?  What kind of woman would ask
the bouncer in a gay bar featuring untalented dancers to beat
the crap out of Jack just because he's asking her some
questions in her back-room office?  </P>
<P>   Marc Palmieri's Jack, though, can gain audience
involvement if only because he's normal--which is a switch
from the usual concept that outlandish people are the most
absorbing.  At least Nicol Zanzarella is cute but she too is
without a personality and has not a thing of interest to say. 
Robert Mowen's camera has little to work with in a film that
could easily fit on your 13-inch TV screen.</P>
