<PRE>                     THE GARDEN OF THE FINZI-CONTINIS
                     (IL GIARDINO DEI FINZI-CONTINI)
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     This is the twenty-fifth anniversary of the widely praised THE
GARDEN OF THE FINZI-CONTINIS.  Director Vittorio De Sica won the 1971
Academy Award for Best Foreign Film for his depiction of fascism and
romance in Italy.</P>
<P>     If you think you've seen this material covered before in
innumerable other films, you haven't.  THE GARDEN OF THE FINZI-CONTINIS
looks at both of its subjects from overlooked perspectives.</P>
<P>     For the anniversary, Sony Pictures Classics is releasing to the
theaters a beautifully restored print with a new Dolby Stereo sound
track.  In the press kit they gave me, they cite twenty-six
international awards the film won at the time.  I could not find a
single problem with the print unlike some other recent restorations I
have seen.  Since the images are central to this film's effectiveness,
the restoration is an important part of what I hope will be a
successful rerun.</P>
<P>     Simply stated, THE GARDEN OF THE FINZI-CONTINIS is a dream.  Not a
dream in any conventional sense, but a dream nevertheless.  It is set
in Italy just before and during the start of World War II.  The
aristocratic Jewish families in the story live in a dream world
believing fascism will leave their plush existence untouched.</P>
<P>     The young Jewish people in the story are full of illusions about
romantic love.  This causes them almost as much pain as their denial of
the consequences of fascism.  The whole texture of the film is
ethereal, and the lush cinematography by Ennio Guarnieri uses a soft
haze to enhance the mood.</P>
<P>     Based on the autobiographical novel by Giorgio Bassani, the story
starts in 1938 when Mussolini's racial laws are beginning to take
force.  Like similar ones of his Nazi brethren, his laws start to clamp
down on the rights of people of Jewish lineage.  The proscribed list
includes no servants, no phone listings, no library privileges, no
public schools, and no obituaries.  And it goes on and on.</P>
<P>     As the show opens, however, the law's harshness seems irrelevant
to our protagonists.  Biking through spectacular scenery, a group of
affluent college students is the embodiment of serenity.  Their solid
white tennis clothing shines in the slightly overexposed images.
Backed by the green of the forest about them, they appear as deities.</P>
<P>     As they make small talk at their tennis club, they are as innocent
as forest nymphs.  Their superrich existence must be forever secure.
The luxurious sets by Giancarlo Bartolini Salimbeni and Mario Chiari
show their castles and large homes to be magnificently appointed.</P>
<P>     Giorgio (Lino Capolicchio) talks to his father about the troubles
starting to affect them.  His father (Romolo Valli) begins to worry
that even though he is a Fascist member in good standing, he may not be
able to escape the evil net that is engulfing others.</P>
<P>     A second aspect of the story starts with the blossoming of a
romance between Giorgio and his now grown up childhood sweetheart Micol
Finzi-Contini (the gorgeous Dominique Sanda).  Micol is a member of a
Jewish family even richer than his own.</P>
<P>     After a sudden rainstorm, they find themselves alone.  Her blouse
has become see-through, and naturally, his heart turns to love.
"Children are always prisoners of grownups," she remarks about how she
has now broken the shackles of her parent's control.  He figures that
this is his opening, but it is not to be.  She is an ice goddess to
him, which drives him crazy.  The scene, which happens in a carriage,
is a forerunner to the one in THE AGE OF INNOCENCE (1993).</P>
<P>     Like the Christmas glass ball with the idyllic snow crusted
cottage inside, their world is picture perfect.  The troubles around it
continue as nothing more than mirages to them.  Surprisingly, most of
the show takes place before there are any major fissures in the ball.
Certainly the rich and respected Prof. Ermanno Finzi-Contini (Camillo
Angelini-Rota) and his family are safe from the tyranny on the streets.
Indeed, when Giorgio begins to be shunned, the Finzi-Contini retain
most of their privileges, and Micol continues playing tennis with her
Aryan friends.</P>
<P>     Even as the whole world begins to collapse, it is no one's fault.
As the director of the library explains to Giorgio when he tosses him
out, it is not up to him.  He is just following the rules somebody else
devised.</P>
<P>     This is not a perfect show.  For one, by today's standards it
seems curiously dated at times.  For another, there are some hard to
believe sequences.</P>
<P>     Micol says she views Giorgio like her brother Alberto (Helmut
Berger) and has no interest in having any romantic attachment to him.
Where does she say this?  She has her servant bring Giorgio to her bed
when she is lying in her nightgown and partially under the covers.  She
is stunning in this setting.  This incongruity perplexes Giorgio and
me.  His reaction is probably what mine would have been.</P>
<P>     The music by Bill Conti (THE RIGHT STUFF) and Manuel De Sica is
worth the effort put into its restoration.  It takes the audience on a
journey from romantic to bittersweet to tragic and finally, to hopeless
sad.</P>
<P>     In MACBETH Malcolm says, "nothing in his life became him like the
leaving it."  So it is with the wealthy Jews in the movie.  They line
up politely to go to their slaughter with all the sophistication of
their upbringing.  A simple and beautiful, but completely tragic
ending.</P>
<P>     THE GARDEN OF THE FINZI-CONTINIS runs just 1:34.  It is in Italian
with English subtitles.  In 1970, the picture was rated R, but today it
would get a PG-13.  There is no sex, bad language, or violence.  There
is only two brief scenes of partial female nudity.  This year's THE
NUTTY PROFESSOR got a PG-13, and this show is a hundred times tamer.
This film would be fine for kids say ten and up.  I strongly recommend
the movie to you and give it *** 1/2.  To be honest, if I had not
considered when the film was made, I would have given it a half star
less.  Perhaps some of its approaches do seem dated, but the show is
full of simple truths and great beauty.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
