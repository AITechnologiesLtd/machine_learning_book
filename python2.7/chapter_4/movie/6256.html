<PRE>                          THAT THING YOU DO (1996)
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1996) **1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        Tom Hanks is one of Hollywood's few genuine success 
stories, an actor the public continues to love even after turkeys like 
Bonfire of the Vanities, Turner and Hooch and Joe 
vs. the Volcano. His preformances are subtle and low-key, yet 
he's won two Oscars. It's his everyman, Jimmy Stewart-like appeal 
that is responsible for his success and makes you like him whether 
he's a gay man with AIDS or an idiot with a heart of gold.
        If this affable, charming personality of his could be 
personified as a movie, THAT THING YOU DO would be it, no great 
coincidence considering Hanks scripted and directed it himself. 
The movie is likeable, mild entertainment that makes you smile 
more than laugh and never offends, like Hanks himself. It is a 
nostalgic story of a fictional 60's band, the Wonders, and their 
rise and fall from stardom. The story is predictable and pretty much 
writes itself, but Hanks should still be congratulated for stumbling 
upon a topic of interest and fascination and coordinating it in an 
entertaining way.</P>
<P>        As THAT THING YOU DO begins, the band's drummer 
(Corey from "My Two Dads" in his first acting gig of the 90's) has 
broken his arm and their friend Guy (Tom Everett Scott) is called in 
as a replacement for their show in a talent competition. At the show, 
Guy speeds up the tempo of lead singer Jimmy's (Johnathon 
Schaech) ballad "That Thing You Do" to match the dance pop 
sound of the Beatles. Suddenly, it's the latest teen sensation and 
the band is playing a local bar / pizza parlor.</P>
<P>        The road to fame continues as they record a single on 
some church equipment, get a manager who works out of a camper 
and play a Pittsburgh rock show. That's when they hit the big time 
and trade off their old manager for a slick Hollywood version, 
played by Hanks. His small role in the movie is the only thing that 
reminds us we're watching a big-time Hollywood movie. The rest is 
acted out by people we've never heard of like Scott, Schaech, Steve 
Zahn and Ethan Embry as "The Bass Player." Liv Tyler, playing 
Jimmy's girlfriend, is the only other link back to Hollywood. Liv 
doesn't do too much in the movie, but she is definitely getting 
more beautiful with each movie she appears in.</P>
<P>        There are a lot of scenes on the way to fame that are more 
cute than funny, the most effective of which is the scene when the 
band members hear "That Thing You Do" on the radio for the first 
time. Liv is mailing some letters when she hears it and begins 
screaming and jumping up and down. She breaks into a run, 
heading for the department store Guy works in, and meets another 
band member on the way. By the time they reach the store, two 
other band members pull up in a car and jump out. Hanks handled 
the whole scene incredibly, capturing the mixture of triumph and 
joy a moment like this would bring a band.</P>
<P>        He handles the last part of the movie with much less skill. 
By the time everything falls apart, we know it's going to fall apart 
and we pretty much know how it's going to fall apart. The Wonders 
seem to be an Americanized one-hit version of the Beatles so we 
know it's only a matter of time before Liv Ono inadvertently breaks 
them up. But it's a fun ride while it lasts, and a definite strong 
showing for Hanks in his directorial debut. Even the song, "That 
Thing You Do," which we hear played eight or nine times 
throughout the course of the movie, is catchy and fun.</P>
<P>        THAT THING YOU DO doesn't have the big laughs or 
thrills of the usual Hollywood movie machine products, nor does 
it have the drama or vision of a low-budget arthouse movie. It will 
probably be a big hit anyway, though, because it has the same 
innocent, family-friendly quality Hanks himself has been bringing 
us for years, even if his role in the movie is small. The Guy 
character, though, is obviously patterned after Hanks, with the 
same personality and many of the same mannerisms. It's no 
coincidence that his name is Guy -- he's the plain old average 
guy we know and love.</P>
