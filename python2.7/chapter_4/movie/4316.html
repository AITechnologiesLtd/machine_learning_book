<PRE>                                  CASINO
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Martin Scorsese's story of the rise
          and fall of a casino manager is a detailed but
          informative and even enthralling three hours.
          CASINO chronicles how organized crime lost Las
          Vegas, as seen through the eyes of two close
          friends appointed by the mob to run the operation.
          In spite of strong graphic violence this could get
          the Best Picture Oscar.  Rating: low +3 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Following the structure of a classical tragedy, CASINO chronicles
in fascinating detail the rise and fall of Sam "Ace" Rothstein, the
mob-assigned manager of a prestigious Las Vegas casino.  Martin
Scorsese co-wrote the screenplay with Nicholas Pileggi, basing it on
Pileggi's novel.  The two previously co-wrote GOODFELLAS, based on
another Pileggi novel.  (Pileggi also co-wrote the screenplay for the
upcoming CITY HALL.)</P>
<P>     CASINO has an epic length, just short of three hours, and while
the central plot advances slowly the film is filled with the engrossing
details of what is involved with the running of a major casino as well
as telling a complex yet never confusing story.</P>
<P>     Ace (played by Robert De Niro) is a consummate gambler who does
his homework for bets in painstaking detail.  His skill has earned
enough for the Kansas City Mob that they reward him, a non-Italian Jew,
by letting him manage the Tangiers Casino.  This is a position in which
he can get very powerful while becoming very rich.  In the job he
really comes into his own as a perfectionist who oversees all the
details, some unsavory, of running the high-profit show.  Ace
reluctantly allows his friend since childhood Nick Santoro (Joe Pesci)
to come to Las Vegas and to get involved with the Tangiers.  Ace also
falls for a beautiful hustler, Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone).  Neither
turns out to be a good decision.  Nick is a loose cannon thug with a
volatile temper.  He will do whatever it takes to get money and power.
Even as Ace's power and prestige increase, the seeds of his downfall
are being sown by idealistic but questionable decisions.  Ace's
marriage and over-generosity to Ginger, his trust of the uncontrollable
Nick, and his unwillingness to rehire the incompetent brother-in-law of
a local official all lead to major trouble.  As he and Nick narrate,
each self-righteously defends his own actions.</P>
<P>     Robert De Niro is fine as Ace, though the character is well within
the range of characters he has played before.  Pesci's violent thug is
very much the same character he played in GOODFELLAS, though perhaps
with a shorter fuse here and with more of a penchant for cruelty.  The
actor who really shows us something new is Sharon Stone, whose descent
into alcohol, cocaine, and rage is her most effective screen role to
date.   As an apparent joke, the deeper addicted Stone gets, the more
she is made up to look like Michelle Pfeiffer.  James Woods is around
playing his usual slimeball character.  Don Rickles is surprisingly
effective in one of his rare serious roles.</P>
<P>     Scorsese's style with this film is fresh and new, though not all
of his touches really work perfectly.  The film starts near the story's
end with Ace in a car bombing and blown through a strange credit
sequence with impressions of the lights of Las Vegas.  The sequence is
strange and the floating through of De Niro in what looks like a car
ejection seat is very odd, indeed, almost reminding one of Fellini.
The sequence was created by Elaine and Saul Bass.  Saul Bass was one of
the classic credit sequence designers of the 1960s.  Scorsese does use
violence more often than in previous films.  And what is there is very
strong stuff and is not for the sensitive.  Borrowing a touch from
FORREST GUMP, the film is seasoned with popular music of the 1970s,
often as a commentary on the story.</P>
<P>     The whole package is a riveting account and a well-told story.
Though the script does not always play absolutely fair with the
audience, the small cheats help lead to unexpected plot twists.  No
film I have seen this year has a better shot at a Best Picture Academy
Award.  I give CASINO a low +3 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
