<P>   In a film which opened a few days after this one, Chen
Kaige's "The Emperor and the Assassin," the titled emperor
of the Qin kingdom of ancient China (Ying Zheng) tells his
mistress (Lady Zhao) that they were happier in the old days
when they were poor and hungry and relished the times they
rolled in the haystacks.  This from an emperor, no less!  He
may have been confusing youth with poverty, but not entirely. 
When you're struggling but not reduced to begging, you're
more likely to be committed to a genuine, worthwhile cause
than when you're rolling in gold simply soaking up life's
material pleasures, although since the finish of the Age of
Aquarius there seem to be no more social movements that
have captured the hearts of large groups of people in the
U.S. or elsewhere in the West.</P>
<P>   But during the Depression, when so many people were out
of work that you did not have to feel like a aberration to be
similarly unemployed, politically conscious Americans could
join in a crusade just like the 19th century French canonized
in the Broadway musical "Les Miserables."  The people who
felt that their privation was largely the result of their
exploitation by the big industries like steel backed by right-
wing newspapers like the Hearst chain could affiliate with the
labor union movement or move even further to the left and
identify with communism.  Their insurgence led to
congressional investigations, notably the Dies committee, which
sought to investigate the operations by subpoenaing
individuals to testify about their possible connection with the
Soviet Union or with domestic radicals.  Like the late sixties
and early seventies, the thirties was a politicized era, causing
people to engage themselves in fervent discussion,
particularly about the fascist programs and politics of Spain,
Italy and Germany.</P>
<P>   "Cradle Will Rock" takes place during this agitated time in
America's history, and while many events and persons are
added to the plot of the 132-minute movie written and
directed by actor Tim Robbins, the incidents are largely true. 
Because the story is loosely constructed, ultimately bringing
together what appear to be diverse stories with little
connection, the movie may be a hard sell for a public that
largely demands easy-to-follow, tightly plotted tales.  The
rewards of watching the movie are many, not the least being
that Robbins shows those of us who did not live through such
polemical eras what it means to be connected to events
larger than our own immediate families; what it's like to
discuss and act upon political causes more dramatic than the
quotidian races between today's often tweedledum-
tweedledee political parties.</P>
<P>   Robbins uses as his metaphor the huge canvas on which
Diego Rivera (Ruben Blades) paints a mural in Rockefeller
Center depicting his view of major events transpiring during
this century.  The mural is commissioned by Nelson
Rockefeller (John Cusack) at a price of $21,000, and though
Rivera is a well-to-do communist, he leaps on the project as
an opportunity to construct such unexpected images as a
portrait of Lenin--to Rockefeller's disgust.</P>
<P>   We observe Marc Blitzstein (Hank Azaria) who is sitting on
a park bench in 1936 composing a radical musical called
"The Cradle Will Rock," while being advised by the ghostly
presence of Bert Brecht.  At about the same time, a
homeless waif, Olive Stanton (Emily Watson) is wandering
the streets about New York's theater district offering to sing a
song for a nickel while desperate to become an actress in
these difficult times.  An astonishing range of characters of all
polemic stripes is introduced including a ditzy socialite,
Countess La Grange (Vanessa Redgrave); Hazel Huffman
(Joan Cusack), a clerk in a government employment office
who is rabidly anti-communist; steel magnate Gray Mathers
(Philip Baker Hall) whose social circle includes conservative
newspaper baron William Randolph Hearst (John Carpenter);
a passionate director of theater pieces, Orson Wells (Angus
Macfadyen); a ventriloquist, Tommy Crickshaw (Bill Murray)
who blames radio-based communists for destroying his
vaudeville career; a Jewish Italian fascist, once Mussolini's
mistress, Margherita Sarfatti (Susan Sarandon); and the head
of the government's Federal Theater program which gives
jobs to unemployed actors, Hallie Flanagan (Cherry Jones).</P>
<P>   Essentially a history lesson taught by a truly interesting
professor, the film moves swiftly along, honing in on the lives
and concerns of these diverse New Yorkers, interpreting their
troubles and showing all seek in their different ways to
resolve their dilemmas.  While the quandary faced by
magnate Gray Mathers, which is dealing with a threatened
steel strike, is a different matter from the predicament of
Olive Stanton, who is not eligible for an acting job because
she was never employed on the stage, each is consumed
with a passion to make life conform to his or her hopes and
partisan passions.  The most involving scenario takes place
inside the theater which is stage Blitzstein's radical play, a
play which, in effect, states that "when the wind blows the
cradle will rock"--or, when the revolution comes, the
foundations of government will fall.  Barred on federal order
by soldiers surrounding the theater, the thesps take their fight
to the streets and ultimately perform their piece before a
cheering crowd of like-minded folks.</P>
<P>   Robbins' film is an intrepid one, a daring venture into
cutting-edge celluloid by Disney studios, particularly when
considering the view of Variety critic Emanuel Levy who
states in his new book "The Cinema of Outsiders" that
"mainstream movies are uneasy with displaying any extreme
ideology, which means that their narratives are
centrist...Hollywood films...don't want to offend any segment
of their potential audience."  If a large number of moviegoers
stay away from "Cradle," more's the pity.  You can count on
your fingers the number of genuinely political films that the
major studios have put out during the decade. (Sorry, those
strictly action-adventure stories centering on terrorists do not
count.)  "The Insider" is one of them, yet another daring adventure
Disney.  Because "The Insider," who box office was somewhat
disappointing, and "Cradle Will Rock"-- deal with political
activity, both translated to the screen in striking manners--
we can only wonder why anyone who professes to be concerned
about the machinations of business, government and labor can
afford to stay away.</P>
