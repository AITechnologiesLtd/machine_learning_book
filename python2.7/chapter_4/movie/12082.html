<PRE>Less Than Zero (1987)

A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1998 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>CAPSULE: Bret Easton Ellis's flash-in-the-pan novel becomes a weak and
sentimental movie. Casting of Robert Downey, Jr. is an asset, though.</P>
<P>I read LESS THAN ZERO when it was first published, and several other times
since. Each time I've come back to it, it seems to contain that much less.
It wasn't that profound a book to begin with, and what little insight it did
have (Los Angeles is a terrible place for anyone to try to be a moral
person, for one) has not survived the transition to the big screen. LESS
THAN ZERO, the motion picture, is even less absorbing than the book that
spawned it. It's just not a good movie, despite the presence of three good
actors (Andrew McCarthy, Jami Gertz, and Robert Downey, Jr.) who are given
potentially interesting roles to play.</P>
<P>McCarthyis a young L.A. denizen, Clay, who goes off to an Ivy League
university. His girlfriend and best friend (Gertz, as "Blair", and Downey)
enter into a kind of relationship of the damned, and then a panic-stricken
Blair calls Clay at Christmastime. Maybe he can help straighten his friend
out. Maybe not.</P>
<P>Downey has drifted into the coke-and-decadence orbit that many people fall
into for no particular reason. In Downey's case, it's boredom, more than
anything else. He's got pretty much everything he could ask for -- he's more
or less been given a recording studio by his father -- but none of it is
enough. He has never learned how to really enjoy any of it, and so of course
he's thousands of dollars in debt to a drug dealer (James Spader, also
good). All of this is played out against a glossy, 90210-ish backdrop of
pool parties, rock clubs, coke binges, and so on.</P>
<P>It's funny how many individually good things there are in the movie -- and
sad how they never quite add up, probably because the movie's agenda is too
cut and dried. Instead of getting a story about lives in decay, we get a
simpleminded parable about the dangers of cocaine; it's on the level of an
ABC AFTERSCHOOL SPECIAL. The worst thing about LESS THAN ZERO is how, like a
bad gangsta rap video, it winds up glorifying what it's supposed to be
attacking -- partly because it doesn't know how to be angry enough about its
subject, I think. It winds up being more like a resigned sigh.</P>
<P>And yet in the middle of this movie there are some very good performances.
Jami Gertz takes what could have been a one-note role and populates it with
small tics and mannerisms that make it real and substantive. Spader, as the
drug dealer, sounds like a human being, not a stupid Hollywood conception of
what a drug dealer is supposed to sound like. And Downey, despite the fact
that the script he's given marches him clean off a cliff, works nicely as
the damned soul. What was missing was a stronger backbone to the movie, a
more definite sense of purpose other than the easy target of drug addiction,
to make it really worth the experience.</P>
