                       A film review by Michael John Legeros

<P>     We could paraphrase Michelle Pfieffer's character in DANGEROUS
MINDS and say that BEYOND RANGOON starts with an "A."  That's fair
enough.  All movies, like all school children, should be given the
benefit of the doubt.  The chance to succeed.  After all, we like to
think that the right combination of talent and effort can do wonders.
Mountains can be moved, and good movies can be made.  Yeah right.
Children fail, as do films.  As does director John Boorman's latest.</P>
<P>     The success of BEYOND RANGOON hinges on the believability of
Patricia Arquette (ED WOOD, TRUE ROMANCE) as the busty
Westerner-in-peril wandering about 1988 Burma without a passport.
Though we can stomach the mild plot contrivances that get her there,
it's a tougher task to overlook the actress.  She's a lightweight.  As
the first scene (with narration!) demonstrates, she doesn't have
*nearly* enough range for the emotions that her character--a mother
fleeing the memories of a murdered husband and son--is supposed to
show.  She may give a stronger performance than, say, Keanu Reeves in A
WALK IN THE CLOUDS, by not by much.</P>
<P>     BEYOND RANGOON is a very physically appealing film, thanks to the
practiced craftsmanship of John Boorman (DELIVERANCE, EXCALIBUR, HOPE
AND GLORY).  He keeps the narrative moving, no matter how muddy the
story--or the heroine--gets.  Why he chose Arquette remains a
mystery, though.  Maybe he was thinking that the dramatic weight of the
story would overcome any casting deficiencies.  But even after an hour
of half-stated political statements and murky mass killings, we *still*
don't know enough of what's happening in this country to feel
distressed for the characters or their situations.  Empty exoticism.</P>
<P>     The technical credits in BEYOND RANGOON are a curious mix,
combining lush jungle photography with bad blue-screen work.  Also odd
is the obvious dubbing.  Done to make some of the foreign characters
sound less foreign?  And, is it my mistake, or do the same extras keep
reappearing as different soldiers??  Doo doo doo doo.  ["Twilight Zone"
theme, or opinion of movie.  You be the judge.]</P>
