<PRE>                              BLUE IN THE FACE
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1995 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     BLUE IN THE FACE was made by the same directors (Wayne Wang and
Paul Auster) that made the highly acclaimed SMOKE.  In fact, the whole
reason that BLUE IN THE FACE was made was that the directors and the
cast found that they had an extra week on their hands, so hey, they
decided to make a fast, improvisational movie with the same sets and
some of the same cast.  The result is a fun, upbeat movie that is
another talk fest just like SMOKE, but not as serious - think of it as
SMOKE-lite.</P>
<P>     BLUE IN THE FACE is a series of vignettes.  The writing is
credited to the directors, but it feels like the actors were winging it
most of the time.  The movie is again set in the Brooklyn Cigar Company
run by Auggie Wren (Harvey Keitel) but owned by Vinnie (Victor Argo).
The subject this time is Belgium waffles, Jackie Robinson (Keith
David), the passing of the Brooklyn Dodgers, and the destruction of
Ebbets Field.  A subplot has Vinnie closing the cigar shop to turn it
into a health food store since, "Tobacco is out.  Wheat germ is in."
There is also attempted infidelity and robbery, but most of all, it is
just a bunch of good friends of all ethnic groups standing around and
gabbing about life.</P>
<P>     The picture starts with a 10 year old kid (Sharif Rashed) stealing
the handbag of a beautiful, miniskirted, young woman (Mira Sorvino from
Barcelona).  Auggie chases the kid down only to have the woman say let
him go.  Auggie takes the bag from the woman and gives it to the kid
and tells him to beat it.  She is nonplused.  The movie is a series of
crazy incidents like that.</P>
<P>     Intertwined with the regular movie, there are two different series
of interviews, documentary style.  One series is done with a cheap
camcorder that produces grainy, saturated images.  I believe that these
interviews were real.  There is also a set of made up interviews,
mainly of an unnamed owner (Lou Reed) of another smoke shop.  He is a
talker, a philosopher, and a long time New Yorker.  He tells us, "I'm
scared twenty-four hours a day, but not in New York.  I'm scared in
Sweden" and then he goes on to explain it is because they keep
benevolently looking after his every move there.  In another of his
scenes, he says, "Yes, I am smoking cigarettes and some of my friends
have died of them, but I am not downing a quart of Scotch in fifteen
minutes.  Looked at that way, cigarettes are actually a health tool!"</P>
<P>     One of Auggie's regulars, Bob (Jim Jarmusch), decides to give up
cigarettes, but smoke his last one with Auggie.  Bob regrets having to
give them up, saying that, "Coffee and cigarettes.  That's like the
breakfast of champions."</P>
<P>     Keitel makes you feel good to be alive.  His smile is infectious.
You want so bad to be there swapping stories.  In fact the ultimate
message of the film has to be that the brotherhood of mankind
transcends all races.  Many scenes feature actors of one race telling
how many people of some other race live in Brooklyn.</P>
<P>     I have only touched on the numerous sketches in BLUE IN THE FACE.
Among others, you get to see a signing telegram one with Madonna and a
seduction one by the store owner's wife, Dot (played by none other than
Roseanne).  And on and on.</P>
<P>     It is a fun time at the movies.  The sets by Kalina Ivanov are
just as imaginative and realistic as in SMOKE since they are the exact
same ones.  The costumes (Claudia Brown) are a little more outlandish
than SMOKE since I think she wanted to tease the audience a bit more.
The cinematography (Adam Holender) is natural but not anything special.</P>
<P>     BLUE IN THE FACE is edited (Maysie Hoy) crisply and runs a fast
1:29.  It is rated R for a little nudity and a little bad language.
Personally, I would have given it a PG-13.  It would be fine for any
teenager, and perhaps even slightly younger kids.  This is a little
movie that I am not wild about, but did enjoy, and I can and do
recommend it to you.  It gets ** 1/2 in my book.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
