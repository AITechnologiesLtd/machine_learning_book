<P>IN SHORT: Seriously inappropriate for anyone under 17. Period. No
discussion necessary.</P>
<P>That summary line is from the publicist. Cranky endorses it
heavy-handedly. Long time readers know of my love for animation and my
admitted lack of education about Japanese anime. There are three types
of anime; without embarrassing myself by using a language I don't
understand they break down to "standard" animation, cute-stuff for
kidlets a la Sailor Moon or Pokémon, and absolutely hardcore adults only
material.</P>
<P>Perfect Blue is absolutely hardcore. I'll be blunt to scare the parental
units first, then we'll get into the bones of the story. Fundamentalists
will consider Perfect Blue to be pornographic, as its main character
moves from a pop-star music world to a soap opera career in which
photographers get her to pose nude for publicity shots. By the end of
the film she will be attacked and raped and confined to a mental
institution. Or maybe not, as this tale of schizophrenia, stalkers and
image sublimation tears into your cortex.</P>
<P>Understand the difference in culture demonstrated here. In Japan, hard
core pornography in comics is considered normal. Phonebook sized XXX
comics are read by the suits on their way to work on the train. It's a
different world from where we come from. More disturbing, to these eyes
at least, is the graphic violence depicted in Perfect Blue. Ice picks
into the eyes, a couple of bloody murders and the aforementioned rape.
If this film were rated, it would carry an NC-17, no question about it.
Parents, and the rest of us grownups, have been warned. This is
absolutely not for children. It's not for most American adults, either.</P>
<P>The story: Mima Kirigoe has had a good career as part of a popmusic girl
group called Cham. Think Spice Girls at the bitter end and you've locked
in to Mima's position. Prodded to leave music behind for a career as an
actress, she bows off the mainstage leaving shocked fans behind,
including a gray haired, pale thin geeky looking stalker type. Needing
to lose the squeaky clean image, Mima is convinced to take a role which
will require her to be "raped" and whose publicity shoot turns into a
soft core bonanza. The Cham fans aren't happy, and Mima's advisors and
scriptwriters start getting killed in gruesome ways. It may be the
stalker, who is maintaining a detailed daily website which purports to
be from Mima herself or it may be a schizophrenic Mima, whose split
personality is asserting itself in an attempt to set right what has gone
wrong. As a straight psychological drama, there's a good nut of story
here.</P>
<P>Cranky couldn't lose himself in the story because the quality of
animation varies wildly. The changes aren't indicative of Mima's mental
state, or of anything symbolic that I could figure out. Then there's the
violence, which is nauseating, disturbing, creepy, you add the synonyms.
Cranky was gasping for air and reeling from the very unpleasantness of
this story.</P>
<P>You know how I've been describing the thought of an animated flick for
grownups? This ain't it. The thing is, this story could do gangbuster
biz as a live action flick, it's certainly deep enough and has enough
twists and turns. We accept the violence in "live" movies because, at a
most basic level, we know it's all fake. Graphic cartoon violence is way
beyond our parameters. Perhaps we've been mind-wiped by Disney, but
watching this kind of violence in cartoon format is truly stomach
turning.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Perfect Blue, he would have paid...</P>
<PRE>$2.00</PRE>
<P>Which is mid-week rental level Perfect Blue is reco'd only if you're a
die hard anime fan or curious and self-confident as all get out (as in
"no cartoon is gonna make me sick...")</P>
<P>Give it five years and you'll probably see a live action remake.</P>
