<PRE>                                 QUIZ SHOW
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  QUIZ SHOW is an intellectual EIGHT
     MEN OUT.  It is an in-depth look at an almost forgotten
     scandal that made national headlines back in 1958.  Once
     the public realized that TV quiz shows were rigged to
     promote ratings, they would never look at television in
     quite the same way again.  Robert Redford directs from a
     terrific, ironic screenplay.  Rating: low +3 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>     In 1958 the biggest things on television were the TV quiz shows.
They were a national craze of rarely matched proportions.  One producer
had four highly-rated quiz shows: "Dotto," "Twenty-one," "The $64,000
Question," and "The $64,000 Challenge."  Edward Hilgemeier Jr. was a
daytime "Dotto" standby contestant who was never actually chosen to
appear, but was waiting to appear if he was needed.  A woman waiting to
appear was chosen and she went on-stage leaving behind a small
notebook.  Hilgemeier read the notebook and found some odd notes.  The
woman contestant won that night against a man who was a former winner,
but all the answers she gave were in the little notebook.  Hilgemeier
went to the man she defeated and showed him the notebook.  The two then
complained to the producers and each was given a bribe to forget about
the notebook.  But Hilgemeier found out the actual contestant was paid
$4000 for his silence, he had gotten only a $1500 bribe.  This struck
Mr. Hilgemeier as unfair and he no longer felt bound to keep silent.
Soon the New York State attorney was involved.  Little attention was
paid to the story until a second contestant confirmed Hilgemeier's
claims.  This was a disgruntled former winner on "Twenty-one" named
Herbert W. Stempel.  He joined Hilgemeier to claim that the game show
he was on was also fixed.  Hilgemeier was a complete unknown but
millions of viewers knew Stempel and now the story was news.  The
result was a three-year national scandal that would rock the TV
industry and the country as well as tarnishing the name of one of the
most respected families in American academics.</P>
<P>     To tell the story in 130 minutes in QUIZ SHOW, those three years
have been somewhat simplified and scoped down to seem like less than
one year.  But the result is yet another powerfully-scripted and
beautifully made film co-produced and directed by Robert Redford.  The
film is like an ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN or EIGHT MEN OUT for the first
television generation.</P>
<P>     Why was it considered important to control the results on quiz
shows?  The most commonly heard explanation is a shrug and the comment
"This is television."  Indeed television was and is treated as if it is
a different reality and this scandal and its aftermath helped the
industry define just what television is.</P>
<P>     When the film opens the sponsor is unhappy that the reigning
champion on "Twenty-one" Stempel (played by John Turturo) is a Jew, and
one with a Queens accent and bad teeth.  The time has come to get a new
champion.  About this time Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes) is
applying to be a "Dotto" contestant.  Van Doren comes from a family of
well-known scholarly academics.  Van Doren has just the WASPy style and
background that the show producers Enright and Freedman (David Paymer
and Hank Azaria) would like their champion to have.  But they need to
control him and ask will he play along and take answers?  "What would
Kant say?" Van Doren muses.  "He'd agree!" the producers tell him
confidently.  Van Doren and Stempel allow themselves to be manipulated
into cooperating with the rigging.  But when Stempel is first
humiliated by having to miss an easy question and then feels he is not
being properly rewarded he decides to take action.  The story is told
by Richard Goodwin (Rob Morrow), an idealistic Harvard grad student in
a low-paid job on House Subcommittee on Legislative Oversight who led
the investigation.  Incidentally, after the uproar the real Goodwin
wrote a book about the scandal and now is one of the producers of this
film based on the book.</P>
<P>     With the possible exception of THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, QUIZ SHOW
has the best script of any film I have seen this year.  Paul Attanasio
has written a screenplay full of often very funny ironic humor.  It is
also packed with contrasts and conflicts.  Beyond the obvious contrast
of honesty and dishonesty, we have a father-son conflict with Mark Van
Doren (played by Paul Scofield) representing the values and honor of
the family while Charles at once tries to live up to and rebel from
those values.  There is the high academic standard that the father hold
up for the family and the son who is only a disappointingly very good.
There is a conflict between the academic culture of the Van Dorens and
the mass culture that television and the quiz shows represent.  We see
the wealth of the aristocratic Van Dorens and the cheap and disarrayed
home of the Stempels.  There is a perceived anti-Semitism in the
viewing public to which the Jewish game show producers pander in their
decision to take Stempel off the show.  And there is just a moment of
negative reaction at the Van Doren when they hear that their guest,
Dick Goodwin, is from the predominantly Jewish town Brookline.  The
script also contrasts the slow money world of campus teaching with the
fast-money world of television where a college instructor who used to
earn under $90 a week but lives a quiet scholarly life can earn
thousands in one night at the cost of a life of fame and constant
tension.  All of these individual conflicts continue at the same time
in the script.</P>
<P>     As someone who considers SCHINDLER'S LIST and A MAN FOR ALL
SEASONS to be the two best films he has ever seen, seeing Paul Scofield
and Ralph Fiennes on the screen together as father and son is a special
experience in itself.  No character is really the main character of
QUIZ SHOW, but Ralph Fiennes's Charles Van Doren is the character we
learn most about.  And  Fiennes certainly cuts a trimmer and more
dashing figure than he did in SCHINDLER'S LIST.  He has not quite
mastered an American accent, but here one ascribes his tones to perhaps
having been educated abroad.  Scofield is very dignified as his father,
but it is hard not to see a lot of Thomas More's quick mind and starchy
correctness in his Mark Van Doren.  John Turturo is adequately abrasive
as his course vulgarian from Queens.  One of the biggest surprises is
David Paymer's slimeball executive.  He has usually played simpy nice-
guy roles and it is nice to see him in a role into which he can put a
little power.  Barry Levinson, who directed Redford in THE NATURAL, is
cast as Dave Garroway, long-time host of the "Today Show."  The two men
are entirely different types and one wonders why there was such an
inappropriate piece of casting.  Levinson gives the roles about the
same authenticity that Sylvester Stallone could give to playing Ronald
Coleman.  Martin Scorsese is also present playing a very high executive
for Geritol, but at least here nobody knows what a Geritol executive is
supposed to look like.</P>
<P>     Michael Ballhaus was director of photography and here one of the
big mistakes was made.  The entire film is shot in a tiresome yellow
filter to create some sort of period feel and in addition most scenes
seem dominated by the color brown, probably for the same reason.  The
effect is artificial and irritating, though it might have worked better
with a lighter filter.</P>
<P>     A few minor quibbles with the script: In a crowded restaurant quiz
show producer Dan Enright has a heated discussion with Stempel over
arranging for Stempel to lose.  It is very difficult to believe Enright
would be so indiscrete.  Levinson raises his hand in a gesture somewhat
like the one that Dave Garroway would use, but Garroway would say
"Peace."  Levinson merely raises his hand.  And frankly I do not
remember NBC using the peacock until the 60s, though I could be
misremembering.</P>
<P>     Still, this is a great script and a very good look at a nearly
forgotten, but nontheless influential American scandal.  I give it a
low +3 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
