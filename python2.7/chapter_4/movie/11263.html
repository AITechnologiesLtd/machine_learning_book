<PRE>                          THE HEROIC TRIO 1992
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                      2 :-) :-) for fighting chics</PRE>
<P>Starring: Michelle Yeoh, Anita Mui, Maggie Cheung, Damian Lau, Anthony
Wong Paul Chin, James Pak,  Shiguan Ren Directed by: Johnny To Kei-Fung
Action Director: Ching Siu-Tung Written by: Sandy Shaw</P>
<P>The only reason why I came across this China Town kung-fu, girl chic
flick was because my eyes caught the name Michelle Yeoh on the front
cover. A recent convert fan of hers since Bond James Bond, I couldn't
help myself but indulge. Fantasy and fascination are quite becoming when
there are plenty of flying, fighting women in leathers lighting the
screen. So I had a picnic with this movie raging war faring women.</P>
<P>Somebody in modern time Hong Kong is stealing all the babies in town.
This has something vaguely to do with the search for the next Chinese
Emperor and a prophecy resurrecting Chinese world domination. All pretty
unconvincing, mumbo jumbo Chinese fiction, so let's forget about the
plot and focus on the women.</P>
<P>Wonder woman (Anita Mui) wears a rather flimsy purple two piece suit,
with matching cloak and mask. Boring! Nothing as sexy as the US version
of the one piece, flag drag outfit, with wonder belt, lasso and head
piece. Otherwise, Mui knows how to give good kick and glass eyed looks
of emotion when a baby cacks it, and the music, the music really swells
with the moment.</P>
<P>Now to Invisible Woman, my favourite actress Michelle Yeoh is dressed in
divine red. What makes her outfit by far the best, is the use of
excessive wind to blow lots of cloth about. She doubly knows how to kick
arse and when it comes to tragedy, the scale of wind is increased to
blow petals of flowers around the room – to remind her of the lover who
wanted to smell roses before he died. Hmmmm?</P>
<P>Then there is the effervescent, ever boisterous, femme fatale Maggie
Cheung – nicknamed the Thief Catcher - very sexy and very butch. Cheung
delightfully contrasts the dramatic styles of the other two females. She
is all playfulness and gives the movie cheek, as Mui represents
sensibility and Yeoh emits tragedy.</P>
<P>So the ending is all together great fun, as these Amazon sisters combine
to fight a demon reminiscent of the original TERMINATOR – no matter what
you do he keeps coming back. Making this funfest of female action
unbelievably exciting.</P>
