<P>Six Days, Seven Nights is one of those movies that give critics a bad
name.  Movie critics like originality.  Critics -- even inexperienced
ones like myself -- have seen so many, many movies that original movies
stand out more in their minds.  Movies that aren't original tend not to
get reviewed very well.</P>
<P>Six Days, Seven Nights is not an original movie.  It thumbs its nose at
originality, it picks its teeth at originality, it uses its keys to
scratch the paint job on originality's car.  Six Days, Seven Nights
happily, gleefully, rips off everything from Casablanca to The African
Queen to The Fugitive (Harrison Ford breaks the all-time career record
for jumping off impossible heights and surviving).  That's just the part
with Ford and Anne Heche stranded on a remote tropical island:  the
subplot involving the hapless David Schwimmer is lifted completely out
of a Friends episode.  The plot is so thin and transparent you could use
it to wrap compact disks.</P>
<P>It would be fair to call Six Days, Seven Nights a shallow, unoriginal,
uninspired, summer popcorn feature.  But it would not be fair to call it
a bad movie.  Although the criticism aimed at Six Days, Seven Nights is
well-earned it misses the point.  This is a fairly good movie that
manages to be entertaining and fun despite its obvious failings.</P>
<P>The best thing about Six Days, Seven Nights is Harrison Ford, who almost
single-handedly redeems the movie from the depths of badness.  Ford
displays a dry, cynical wit reminiscent of his Indiana Jones
performances.  I've always felt that Ford is at his best playing a rogue
and that his recent roles as Jack Ryan and as the President in Air Force
One haven't really allowed him to display that side of his character.
It's nice to get to see him play someone disreputable, and his role as a
scruffy cargo pilot gives him the opportunity.</P>
<P>Anne Heche has equal billing with Ford and deserves it.  The only thing
I didn't like about her earlier effort in Wag the Dog was the short
shrift that the movie gave its supporting characters.  Heche was
convincing as a ditzy press aide in that movie, and it's good to see her
given more screen time.  She knows what to do with it, too, holding her
own with Ford in the comic banter that ensues when Ford's plane crashes
on a spectacularly beautiful South Pacific island that looks to be the
size of Michigan.  Heche manages to be cute and funny even when her hair
is completely wrecked -- a rare thing in Hollywood.</P>
<P>Much has been made about the relationship between Ford and Heche in Six
Days, Seven Nights.  What I liked most about the movie was that their
conversation almost seemed improvised, as if the individual who wrote
the script sort of left blank spaces for the actors to pencil in
whatever lines they wanted to.  The dialogue between Ford and Heche is
the best part of the weak script, and it's nice to picture the actors
making up dialogue as they go along.</P>
<P>Critics are people who look at movies and say that the glass is half
empty, rather than half full.  However, there's just enough in this
particular glass to give a positive recommendation to Six Days, Seven
Nights, a movie that manages to be fun and entertaining in spite of
itself.  Relax, kick back, and pass the popcorn.</P>
