<PRE>     JEANNE AND THE PERFECT GUY (French with English Subtitles)
         A review by Mark R. Leeper in bullet-list form
           from the Toronto Internation Film Festival</PRE>
<P>     CAPSULE: How do you tell a now fairly familiar love story set in
the time of AIDS?  The French do it by turning it into a light musical.
Virginie Ledoyen is charming as a young woman who finds her new lover
is HIV-positive.  Rating:  7 (0 to 10), low +2 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>   - Directed by Olivier Ducastel and Jacques Martineau
   - The musical is not my favorite genre of film.  Musicals got too
     big with ornate production numbers in the US and fell apart of
     their own weight.  Woody Allen tried his own hand at the musical
     with EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU.  It just did not work for me.  The
     French have a better approach.  They do not build the story around
     huge production numbers.  They just tell their story and at
     various moments a character will sing a simple song.  Perhaps
     there will be a few dance steps.
   - Virginie LeDoyen plays a switchboard operator who rarely is
     lacking a bed-partner.  But Jeanne is anxious to find a perfect
     lover.  She finds one, Olivier LaGrange (Mathieu Demy), on the
     underground, only to find he is HIV positive.  Without her
     realizing it they have a mutual friend, a gay school professor who
     knows Olivier from ACT-UP, the AIDS activist group.
   - Hard to imagine Jeanne is this promiscuous and this is the first
     time she has been touched by AIDS.
   - Musical numbers seem to start up very naturally.  Often they are
     on unexpected subjects like Tsing-tao Beer or foreign workers
     singing how they cannot get naturalization papers.
   - Most of the plot twists are predictable.
   - Last scene of film very different that what we would have in an
     American film.</P>
