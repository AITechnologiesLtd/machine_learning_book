<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Chen Kaige's (Farewell My Concubine) latest film has a lot going for
it.  This gorgeous, sweeping epic is reportedly the most expensive Asian
film ever produced.  It won a technical award at the Cannes Film
Festival.  And it reunites Kaige with his Concubine and Temptress Moon
star Gong Li, one of Asia's greatest actresses.  But despite this, The
Emperor & The Assassin is still a tough sell because of its running time
and its subject matter – a nearly three-hour film about political
turmoil in 3rd century B.C. China.  And it ain't in English either.
Doesn't exactly scream crowd-pleaser, does it?</P>
<P>According to history, there was a 200-year period of unrest between the
many kingdoms that composed China.  There were seven major territories,
with the strongest, called Qin, ruled by Ying Zheng (Li Xuejian, The
Blue Kite).  Ying was fixated on the unification of the Chinese
territories so that he could rule the cohesive land as its first
Emperor.  He destroyed everything he viewed as a potential obstacle,
slowly conquering the other kingdoms and eventually realizing his goal.
But Ying died only one year into his reign, and his Qin dynasty
dissolved within nine years, leaving the original Emperor a casualty of
his own ambition and voracity.</P>
<P>The film, which is divided into five acts, focuses on Ying's attempt to
defeat China's other states without appearing ravenously bloodthirsty.
His concubine, Zhao (Li, Chinese Box) hatches a brilliant scheme
involving a phony assassination attempt on Ying, whose attempted
elimination would appear to be the doing of Yan, a neighboring kingdom
that has proven to be the biggest hurdle for his plans to integrate the
country.  But in the process of setting up the assassination, Ying
learns something about his ancestry that causes him to go unhinged,
killing anyone that could either know or find out his secret, as well as
turning against Zhao's native soil (which, just to be confusing, is also
called `Zhao').</P>
<P>Zhao, horrified at Ying's actions, is forced to support the Prince of
Yan (Sun Zhou), intending to make the phony assassination attempt on
Ying into a very real threat.  In Yan, she meets Jing Ke (Zhang Fengyi,
The Blue Kite), an ex-killer who returns to his brutal ways in order to
help Zhao.  The double-crossing is reminiscent of Shakespeare, while the
surprise heritage is suggestive of Star Wars.</P>
<P>Kaige's direction (he also wrote the script with Wang Peigong),
especially of the intensely gruesome battle scenes, is tremendous.
Cinematographer Fei Zhao (Sweet & Lowdown) bathes the film a warm light
and Li delivers her best performance in years.  Costumes and design
teams add to a top-notch production.</P>
<PRE>2:46 – R for intense battle violence</PRE>
