<PRE>HAPPY GILMORE (1996)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Dennis Dugan
Writers: Tim Herlihy and Adam Sandler
Starring: Adam Sandler, Christopher MacDonald, Julie Bowen, Frances Bay,
Carl Weathers, Ben Stiller, Bob Barker, Kevin Nealon</P>
<P>While Chris Farley films pretty much rely on Farley's weight problem and
his ability to scream and overact, Adam Sandler seems to more
versatile.  Well, in comparison.  I didn't see his "Billy Madison," and
have no desire to, but he makes far more comically interesting flicks
than Farley, or any of his SNL generation cohorts.  In comparion,
obviously.</P>
<P>"Happy Gilmore" is actually the name of the protagonist, played by Adam
Sandler with great energy and overacting, although far less than
Farley's.  He's a likable over-reactor who wants to play hockey for a
living, but has a problem: he sucks.  He can't skate, he can't shoot,
but he has such a short temper that he could probably take out anyone in
an actual NHL game.  Anyway, so that's as much as I know about the sport
of hockey.</P>
<P>But one day, when his grandmother, who raised him after his father was
killed by a hockey puck, is evicted from her house, and forced to live
in a nursing home (headed by a sadistic Ben Stiller, who uses the old
people to do slave labor), Happy tries to get her money so she can pay
the mortgage on her house, and get it back.  And one day he finds out he
can hit a golf ball farther than anyone else (and hit various people - a
joke that I admittingly laughed at every time).</P>
<P>With his ex-golf player mentor (Carl Weathers, who needed the paycheck)
who's missing a hand due to the fact that an alligator chewed it off
(another redundant gag target), Happy goes to a bunch of golf
tournaments in his hockey shirt, and is soon winning everyone, much to
the disenchantment of the only big golfer (Christopher MacDonald,
currently enjoying a role on that Kirstie Alley sitcom, "Veronica's
Closet") who hasn't won the big tournament yet, where he receives a
yellow jacket.</P>
<P>There's a half-assed love interest that goes on with some chick who
handles the tournaments or something (Julie Bowen), and then there's the
whole fascination with Happy, who is known to yell obscenities at the
golf ball, and beat up mocking people.  And then there's the bit about
his grandmother.  This is all, luckily, handled with the utmost amount
of non-seriousness, and even the skating scene where Adam and his chick
skate to the theme from that Brooke Shields masterpiece, "Endless Love,"
is handled hysterically.</P>
<P>But this film is only funny when watched every now and then.  This is
not a flick you see over and over and over and over again in a short
amount of time.  Sure Adam's a funny guy.  And Christopher MacDonald
makes a hilarious villain (who stumbles on his obscenities sometimes,
making him a good old incompetent nemesis).  And the Ben Stiller
sub-plot is pretty funny. But the film never really becomes the
absolutely hysterical film it should be.  The jokes are usually ones
you've seen before, most of the time earlier in the film.  But luckily
the parts that would be handled melodramatically aren't.</P>
<P>"Happy Gilmore" IS a funny film, and remains more enjoyable than most of
those cheap SNL spin-offs/member vehicles.  But it's still not the
greatest flick, and never shows that Adam Sandler will get the respect
that ex-SNL people like Bill Murray and Dan Ackroyd at one time got 
It's just a minor little film that you forget until the next Adam
Sandler flick comes along.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): **1/2</PRE>
