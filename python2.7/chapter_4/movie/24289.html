<P> Frequency (2000) 2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Dennis Quaid, Jim
Caviezel, Andre Braugher, Noah Emmerich and Elizabeth Mitchell. Written
by Toby Emmerich. Directed by Gregory Hoblit.</P>
<P> "Frequency" is an implausible, but entertaining fantasy that taps into
one of man's primal fantasies: the what-if scenario.</P>
<P> "Frequency" is a thriller in which a father and son, separated by time,
work together to stop a serial killer.</P>
<P> Detective John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel) who, after breaking up with his
girlfriend (or wife, we are never sure which she is) hooks up his dad's
old ham radio gear and - with the help of `the mother of all sun spots'
- he is conversing with his dad, Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid), a heroic
firefighter killed 30 years earlier in the line of duty.</P>
<P> Am I giving anything away by spilling the beans here? Not really.</P>
<P> For as Frequency progresses, history changes as often as diapers on
newborn quintuplets.</P>
<P> History is first altered when John warns his father about his impending
death. </P>
<P> Frank, acting on John's advice, escapes the fatal Bruxton warehouse
fire.</P>
<P> But then traces of John's mother disappear, and it appears she has
become a victim of a serial killer who was never captured. Somehow
Frank's survival has changed history.</P>
<P> Of course, no one in either era believes John or Frank as they go about
mucking up the space-time continuum.</P>
<P> The problem with movies such as "Frequency" is that they ignore the
larger context of how one small change, like a ripple in a stream,
affects the entire timeline. To cover all that, of course, a movie would
have to run four or five hours, while a novel would probably run close
to 1,000 pages.</P>
<P> So, wisely, most filmmakers and authors ignore this potential snare.</P>
<P> Written by Toby Emmerich and directed by Gregory Hoblit, who directed
"Primal Fear," "Frequency" has an innocent charm about it, despite its
sometime gruesome subject matter.</P>
<P> Much of what happens is predictable. The suspense is not so much
who-done-it, but how will everything be resolved.</P>
<P> Quaid gives a solid performance as the hot-shot firefighter who is
devoted to his wife and young son. A die-hard Mets fan, he uses
knowledge told him by Frank about the Amazin' Mets and their 1969 World
Series heroics to convince others of his sanity.</P>
<P> Caviezel, who was featured in "The Thin Red Line," is almost childlike
as he makes contact with his role model-hero. He is good looking and
macho, yet vulnerable and a bit dazed by the events that begin to
dominate his life.</P>
<P> Also in the cast is the fabulous Andre Braugher as Frank's best friend
and John's police mentor; Noah Emmerich as Gordo, John's lifelong best
friend; and Elizabeth Mitchell as John's loving mother.</P>
<P> "Frequency" is not prime filmmaking, but it does grip you despite some
of its shortcomings. It's a middle-fare meal of a movie, one that will
not overwhelm you, but will leave you satisfied.</P>
