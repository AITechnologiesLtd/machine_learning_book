HEAR NO EVIL (1993)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>Marlee Matlin is a great actress, and it is real pity that
we don't see her more often in the movies. Unfortunately,
that seems to be case because of her own affliction. Being
deaf herself, she has rather limited pool of available
roles, but when she gets any of them, the audience is
rewarded with truly remarkable performances. One of the
examples is HEAR NO EVIL, 1993 thriller directed by Richard
Greenwald.</P>
<P>In this movie Matlin plays Jillian Shanahan, deaf exercise
instructor who, without knowing, got involved in rather
dangerous situation. Her friend, journalist Micky O'Malley
(played by John C. McGinley) got into the possession of
rare, valuable and stolen coin. Before being blown up in his
car, Micky had stashed the coin in Jillian's apartment.
Jillian is now becoming the target of Lieutenant Brock
(Martin Sheen), ferocious corrupt cop who sees the coin as
his own retirement fund. She is also being stalked by
mysterious figure dressed in black. The only help comes in
the shape of Ben Kendall (D.B. Sweeney), mountain climber
that also happens to fall in love with her.</P>
<P>Although not very original in concept and borrowing a lot
from WAIT UNTIL DARK, 1967 classic with Audrey Hepburn as
blind woman in similar situation, HEAR NO EVIL is very good
thriller. The crime subplot is unoriginal and very
formulaic, full of usual Hollywood plot holes and
implausibilities. On the other hand, the atmosphere of the
film is very well-done, Oregon locations seems refreshing,
and sometimes, the horror that waits our heroine can be
sensed by the audience too. The best thing in this film is
in actors' performances. Marlee Matlin is superb, and she
has a good chemistry in the romantic scenes with D.B.
Sweeney. Martin Sheen is also good in very reserved, yet
menacing role of corrupt policeman. All in all, HEAR NO EVIL
is film with weak concept, but the execution so good that
deserves praise.</P>
