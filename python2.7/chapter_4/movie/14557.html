LOLITA
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>After a long and highly publicized sojourn in release purgatory, the new
version of LOLITA has finally made it into wide release at the theaters.
The immediate question is was it worth all the fuss?</P>
<P>Directed by Adrian Lyne in his usual flashy manner, the film lacks the
literary feel and substance of Stanley Kubrick's 1962 classic starring
James Mason, Shelley Winters, Sue Lyon and Peter Sellers.  Lyne
(FLASHDANCE, FATAL ATTRACTION and NINE AND 1/2 WEEKS) manages to turn
Humbert Humbert into a sympathetic character.  The blame for the affair
is laid at the hands of his 14-year-old stepdaughter, Lolita.  In this
bit of perverted ethics, the stepfather is made into a poor guy who
suffers a fatal attraction to young girls.  And Lolita is a sexual
predator, who continually seduces her stepfather.  In one typical
instance, she demands a raise in her allowance, among other things.  He
sits there "helpless" as she increases the sexual foreplay until he
agrees upon the exact figure she dictates.</P>
<P>Jeremy Irons with his sad, pensive eyes specializes in playing tragic
characters.  As Humbert Humbert, especially in the narration, he puts
just the perfectly hopeless spin on the role that Lyne wants.  Irons,
who is never less than riveting, rises way above the rest of the
presentation.  His narrations of Vladimir Nabokov's rich text from the
novel are the film's high points.</P>
<P>The major problem with the production is the casting of Dominique Swain
as Lolita.  Her overly "cute" mannerisms almost single-handedly sink the
picture.  Precocious to a fault, she acts every scene in ways that would
never occur in real life.  She loves to sit behind Humbert while they
are driving and stick her toes in his eyes, almost causing accidents.
She "accidentally" drapes her body over his in contorted ways that are
awkwardly staged.  Fidgeting constantly like someone who mainlines
sugar, she never stands still long enough to become the alluring
creature that the part demands.  One of the least natural of actresses,
her acting shows through on every scene and gets in the way of our ever
taking the film seriously.</P>
<P>The other two principles in the cast, Melanie Griffith as Charlotte Haze
and Frank Langella as Clare Quilty, are perfectly satisfactory but
little more.  In the original, Shelley Winters made the part of Lolita's
mother, Charlotte, convincingly loathsome.  Griffith, on the other hand,
plays a pleasant wife with no noticeable faults other than wanting to go
to bed with her husband, who prefers her daughter instead.  He uses
heavy sleeping pills to avoid his "husbandly duties."</P>
<P>Much is made of Lolita's innocence.  She tosses her braces retainer
everywhere to remind you of her youth.  When she can't figure out where
to put them, she twirls them in her mouth like a big piece of candy.
These displays of mock immaturity are directly contradicted by her
actions, so few are credible.</P>
<P>Exquisitely filmed by Howard Atherton with a lovely gloss, the movie has
meticulously constructed period sets.  But Lyne has little sense of
proportion.  He flaunts his reconstruction of "Magic Finger" beds and
"Tee Pee" motels so often that one might think the movie was a
Smithsonian documentary.  Already too long, the film should have had
most of these period homages cut.  What purpose is served with detailed
close-ups of the production of an old-fashioned ice cream float?</P>
<P>The movie ends badly in every sense of the word.  Do we really need all
that gratuitous gore?  And a corpse blowing blood bubbles?  Please!</P>
<P>LOLITA runs 2:17.  It is rated R for aberrant sexuality, violence,
nudity and profanity and would be acceptable for teenagers only if they
are both older and mature.</P>
