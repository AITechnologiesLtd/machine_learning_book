                       A film review by David N. Butterworth
                        Copyright 1997 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: ** (Maltin scale)</PRE>
<P>"One Night Stand" is a slight, puerile, and rather pointless tale of
infidelity that tries too hard to be deep.  The performances are all fine;
it's the writer, composer, and director--Mike Figgis all--that spoil the
show.</P>
<P>Successful television commercial director Max Carlyle (Wesley Snipes) is in
New York visiting an old friend who's dying of AIDS.  He misses his flight
back to L.A., however, for a variety of reasons--a leaky pen in his shirt
pocket, bad traffic, and a more-than-passing interest in an intriguing
blonde called Karen (Nastassja Kinski), with whom he winds up spending the
night.</P>
<P>Max returns to L.A. where his petite, fun-loving wife Mimi (played by
Ming-Na Wen) tells him she misses her "Mr. Pufnstuf," referring to Max's
(recently used) "equipment."  Once home, the family dog acts all funny
around him (Max didn't *shower*!?) causing Mimi to comment, half in jest
and half in fear, "maybe he smells another bitch on you?"  Charming.</P>
<P>A year later, Max and Karen bump (and grind) into each other again,
triggering a chain of coincidences that result in the film's ridiculous
(double!) climax.  (Talking of entendres, there are plenty of unintentional
laughs in "One Night Stand" but deliberate attempts at humor fall
completely flat.)</P>
<P>Stylistically, "One Night Stand" is awkward.  Scenes frequently fade to
black, not at the end but throughout, and often.  It's a sophomoric
technique that damages the film's tempo: scenes that appear to have ended
continue, and those that require resolution have gone by the wayside when
the image returns.  Having Snipes talk directly to camera in the opening
sequence sets an inappropriate expectation also, especially as the
technique is never used again (one frustrated sigh to camera
notwithstanding).</P>
<P>Similarly, Figgis slaps together a schizophrenic score--jazz doodlings,
solo piano pieces, melancholic strings, and flighty vocal passages--as if
this multifaceted filmmaker can't decide what mood he wants to establish.</P>
<P>The crisis at the center of the film is troubling as it elevates "One Night
Stand" to a level of "significance" it doesn't deserve.  While Robert
Downey Jr. is appropriately cast and affecting as Charlie, Max's
HIV-positive friend, it's uncomfortable and decidedly tacky watching Max
and Karen groping at each other while Charlie's life ticks away.  Kyle
MacLachlan, as Charlie's brother Vernon, doesn't have much to do (unless
doubling for Matthew Perry was a script requirement), and Julian Sands and
Amanda Donohoe, both often extreme performers, are wasted in minor roles.</P>
<P>Nothing makes a whole lot of sense.  Max has a sexy wife so we should
believe he's looking for more than just physical gratification?  Mimi's
dinner conversation might not be all that stimulating--Max tries to stir
things up by suggesting, for example, that the California mudslides were
started deliberately--but he doesn't engage Karen in any kind of
intellectual discussion either.</P>
<P>While "One Night Stand" isn't nearly as Penthouse Forum as Figgis' previous
film, the critically-acclaimed boozefest "Leaving Las Vegas," it does
continue his penchant for seedy situations in which his lead actresses slip
in and out of flimsy outfits.  After a couple of wet dreams in a row, Mike
Figgis might want to consider refocusing his efforts in a less adolescent
direction--one that might provide him with the depth he seeks.</P>
