<PRE>                                 GUN CRAZY
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1993 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>1:37, R, Action/Drama, 1992, Made-for-Cable-Television
Director: Tamra Davis
Cast: Drew Barrymore, James LeGros, Billy Drago, Rodney Harvey,
      Joe Dallesandro, Michael Ironside, Ione Skye</P>
<P>     Promiscuous teenager Drew Barrymore gets James LeGros, who is in
prison for manslaughter, as a pen pal.  Barrymore learns that LeGros
likes guns, so she learns how to use them.  LeGros gets out of prison on
parole and he goes to live in the same town as Barrymore.  Even though
LeGros can't have sex, he and Barrymore find that they have some things
in common, especially a liking for guns.</P>
<P>     GUN CRAZY was aired on, and made for, Showtime, several months ago
and it was just released on videocassette.  Apparently the film had a
small theatrical run, too, but it didn't come to any theaters around my
area.  Even though this film is a B movie, I think that it ends up
looking like it had a much higher budget then it really did.  Part of
the reason for this is that it has a very talented cast.  I highly
recommend this film.  On a scale of zero to five, I give GUN CRAZY a
five.  GUN CRAZY is rated R for explicit language, adult situations, and
violence.</P>
<P>     Drew Barrymore ("2000 Malibu Road," SKETCH ARTIST), I think, is the
most alluring female in movies today.  She has had the same basic type
of character in most of her recent films that I have seen; POISON IVY
(1992 version), FAR FROM HOME, and BEYOND CONTROL: THE AMY FISHER STORY.
She plays a sensuous young female, and she doesn't have to go nude to
portray this character.  I think that she is much better in this role
then actresses that go nude (like Shannon Tweed in NIGHT EYES 2 or Bo
Derek in GHOSTS CAN'T DO IT).  I think that Drew Barrymore's performance
made this film, even though the entire cast is very talented.  She is
excellent in her role and completely believable.</P>
<P>     James LeGros (DRUGSTORE COWBOY, POINT BREAK) is excellent in his
role.  Billy Drago (THE UNTOUCHABLES, DELTA FORCE 2: OPERATION
STRANGLEHOLD) plays a preacher and is excellent.  Joe Dallesandro
(CRY-BABY, WILD ORCHID 2: TWO SHADES OF BLUE) gives a perfectly slimy
performance as Drew Barrymore's mother's boyfriend.  Who ever played the
sheriff also was great.  Ione Skye (GAS FOOD LODGING, WAYNE'S WORLD) has
a great cameo.  She plays a friend of Barrymore's, who is the daughter
of the sheriff.  Even though her part is very small, she brings life to
her character.</P>
<P>     GUN CRAZY is well written, although the basic plot behind the film
is not original.  The basic plot line of the film reminded me of WISDOM
(with Emilio Estevez and Demi Moore).  However some parts of the film
are different.  Also, I enjoyed GUN CRAZY more than WISDOM.</P>
