<P>As the middle of seven sisters, I've been anticipating seeing "Hanging 
Up" for weeks now.  Surely, I thought, they'd be addressing Issues like 
the ones I've had with my younger and older siblings for thirtysomething 
years now.  Surely, I thought, the Female Factor would be in full 
effect.  Surely, I thought, I'd leave the theater with a better 
Understanding of the mystique that is sisterhood--or at least pleased at 
having been able to identify with the chicks on screen ("yeah girl, my 
sister tried to play that sh...tuff too!") </P>
<PRE>Boy, was I wrong. </PRE>
<P>The Story (WARNING: some spoilers contained below):
In what probably sounded better On Paper than what was actually 
realized, Eve (Meg Ryan), Georgia (Diane Keaton) and Maddy (Lisa Kudrow) 
are sisters who really strain to have Issues with each other, with their 
dying father (Walter Matthau), with their estranged mother (Cloris 
Leachman), and with the phones that seem to rule their lives. </P>
<P>The Upshot
Take note: this will be the shortest review I've written to 
date--because there's really not much to tell.  This movie can be summed 
up in a single phrase: the Ephron sisters (Nora and Delia, co-writers of 
this dud) need to keep their boring Issues to themselves. </P>
<P>I tried, lord knows I did, to find something to write about.  The 
storyline just bored me to tears, being linear and obvious as it was; 
the acting was tedious; the dog was as unnecessary as the unfortunate 
inclusion of Adam Arkin as Eve's husband Joe and Jesse James as their 
son Jesse (not that they did anything wrong, per se, only that they were 
just so much dead wood in a forest full of logs); Diane Keaton's 
directing debut was uninspiring; and the whole phone gimmick was too 
through after the first or second time it was crammed down the viewers' 
throats.  Except for Leachman's somewhat interesting role as the mother 
who didn't want to be a mother, nothing else about this movie justified 
it taking up 92 minutes of my life. </P>
<P>I won't take up more minutes of your life trying to make more out of 
this by-the-numbers movie than needed.  You won't laugh, you won't cry, 
you won't feel moved to tell your sisters you love them.  You'll only 
wonder why Mom and Dad Ephron didn't send their girls to writer's camp. </P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line: 
If you've seen the trailers/commercials for this flick, you've seen the 
movie.  No, not just the best parts, I mean that you've seen the 
*movie*; the other 90 or so minutes are just filler.  Boring, trite 
filler at that.  Guess I'll have to wait for The Black "Hanging Up" to 
see my sisters and I on the big screen, after all. </P>
<PRE>"Hanging Up" (rating: yellowlight): 
Never even got a dial tone.</PRE>
