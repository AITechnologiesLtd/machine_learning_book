<P>Allow me to get philosophical on you for a minute. If a bad ending were to
fall in an otherwise "okay" movie and you were sitting in the audience to
witness it...would it be considered a "bad" movie? Well, in the case of this
film, the ending was so over-the-top that it just tore away any cozy
feelings that I had burrowed in me during the hour and a half previous. A
note to writer Ehren Kruger: it's called over-writing...look into it : )</P>
<P>PLOT:
A convict gets out of jail and finally meets the girl that he'd heard so
much about during his stint in the big house. Unfortunately for the tender
loving duo, the girl's older brother decides to crash their party and
blackmail the ex-con into helping him and his gang of hooligans rob the
Tomahawk casino.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
An okay movie with a few decent one-liners, a couple of semi-interesting
action sequences and Charlize Theron looking great is dramatically killed
with an ending so ridiculous that it practically washes away the entire
entertainment value of its previous ninety minutes. I say "practically"
because I do not like to blow a movie off just because "one aspect" of the
film didn't click for me, so let me tell you what I did like about this
film. First of all, Charlize Theron is now officially a grade A movie star!
She's the type of actress that can make you love her no matter what she
says, does, wears or doesn't wear. She is a beauty to behold, a solid
thespian in her own right and a sparkplug of charisma, all wrapped in one.
Fans of Charlize will love her in this film, as will fans of Theron's
boobies, which make an uncredited cameo about halfway through the picture.
Ben Affleck does an okay job, but his performance in this film won't be
putting him on the Brendan Fraser action-hero map anytime soon (To be fair,
Big Ben also flashes us some ass during an early sex-scene). And let's not
forget Sinise, who fills the shoes of the official "bad guy" pretty well, as
well as his tank top, which he fills rather nicely with his newly buffed
body. Nice biceps, dude!</P>
<P>So the actors were are all pretty good, the film started with an intriguing
shot (Five dead bloody Santa suits spread across old man winter), and it
even included a couple of neat twists and turns. So what went wrong?
Unfortunately, the film on the whole just runs along with a little humor
here and there, a little bit of pseudo-romance, which actually drags the
film down especially at the very beginning, a little bit of action and an
even smaller bit of suspense. All in all, nothing to majorly crow about, but
certainly a film which I would have had no problem recommending to people
who liked Theron or Affleck, like "winter" movies and Christmas songs and
didn't mind suspending their disbelief every now and again. But
unfortunately for Frankenheimer and crew, they decided to finish the movie
off with one of the most absurd endings that I've seen in a while. So
whatever little recommendation there was left in me by that point
disappeared along with all sense of reality in the script. Of course, to
each his own, and God knows every single one of us has our own barometer of
far-fetchedness, so who knows, maybe you won't mind the ending so much. But
as much as my buddy and I tried to make sense of the cards that we were
dealt during this film's final moments, it was obvious that neither one of
us could pretend that any of it made much sense.</P>
<P>An okay movie...with a laughable ending.</P>
<P>Little known facts about the movie and its stars:
Charlize Theron stands 5'9". She is fluent in Afrikaans. Ben Affleck stands
6'3". He speaks decent Spanish. Apparently, poor ol' Ben was accidentally
knocked unconscious by football player Dana Stubblefield during the filming
of this movie when Stubblefield slipped and knocked Affleck down. Bennie was
quickly taken to the hospital, and fully recovered.
Clarence Williams III is best remembered for his part of Linc Hayes, his
big-ass afro role in TV's "The Mod Squad".
When Senator Robert Kennedy was shot at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles
on June 5, 1968, it was his good friend John Frankenheimer who had
personally driven him there that day.
Writer Ehren Kruger is the latest flavor of the month in Hollywood, with no
less than three films carrying his writing credits in the past year alone.
Besides this one, he also wrote the thriller ARLINGTON ROAD (7/10) and the
last of the Scream movies entitled SCREAM 3 (7.5/10).
Watch closely and you will notice singer Isaac Hayes in a small cameo part
at the beginning of this movie, as the convict in jail who finds a roach in
his jello, eventually leading to a food fight. You will also note the acting
debut of Washington Redskins tackle Dana Stubblefield who plays another
fierce convict named Alamo. Apparently while casting for the film, director
Frankenheimer told his associates that he "wanted a mean, tough guy to play
Alamo. I want a guy like that Dana Stubblefield". When the filmmakers
contacted the ballplayer, he was more than willing to play the part.
Thankfully the filmmakers decided not to change this film's title from the
pretty cool REINDEER GAMES to the very lame DECEPTION.
This film was shot entirely in the province of British Columbia, Canada.</P>
