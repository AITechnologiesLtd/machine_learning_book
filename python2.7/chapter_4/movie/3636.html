<PRE>                                  CRIMSON TIDE
                        A film review by Christopher Null
                         Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<PRE>     The Cold War may be over, but it lives on through films like CRIMSON TIDE.</PRE>
<P>     CRIMSON TIDE is a new action/psychodrama about a mutiny aboard a U.S.
nuclear submarine.  When World War III is about to erupt thanks to Russian
coup-artists, the USS Alabama, helmed by Captain Frank Ramsey (Gene
Hackman) is sent to prepare for the worst.  When the order to launch comes
in, Ramsey's executive officer, Lt. Commander Ron Hunter (Denzel
Washington), clashes with the Captain over a last-minute, incomplete order
which could recall the missile launch.  The result is mutiny, with half the
ship siding with the Captain's single-minded, stubborn decision to fire,
half standing with Hunter, who wants a confirmation before blowing up the
world.</P>
<P>     Sound thrilling?  Well, after about 45 minutes of the two principals
philosophizing about life and war, trading quips, and smoking cigars,
*then* the action part of the film comes to life.  Unfortunately, this
prologue does little more than develop the characters like this:  Captain
Ramsey is a obstinate military man, Hunter is a thoughtful peace-lover.  In
fact, most of the lengthy dialogue is arranged to show just what a great
guy Hunter is, and that Ramsey is on the verge of being a Captain Ahab,
hunting the Russkies like they're a latter-day Moby Dick.</P>
<P>     When the action sequences do finally come up, they start with a
nonsensical galley fire (no one can put it out except Hunter, who--get
this--actually pushes a button on the wall to save the day).  Then there's
a flooding bilge bay, and on this ultra-high-tech ship, the preferred tool
for repairing a flooding sub is none other than a monkey wrench.  When the
radio breaks, the crew is fast at work soldering together enough wire and
circuit boards to control the U.S. telephone system.  All this talk about
the film making the military look bad isn't quite right; instead, it just
looks ridiculous.</P>
<P>     This all may be quibbling, but the pure silliness of some of the film
really detracts from the bulk of it, which is a gripping and tense thriller
with two armed factions of men trying to either launch or stop the launch
of ten of the Alabama's nuclear missiles.  The chemistry between Hackman
and Washington, while kept basically predictable, is still full of tension
and repressed anger as the characters are forced to maintain a surface
civility despite an obvious dislike underneath.  The set constructed to
recreate the USS Alabama and the sub combat scenes are incredibly realistic
and make the film worth watching all by themselves.</P>
<P>     Much has been made of the similarity between this film and movies like
THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, TOP GUN (directed and produced by the same team
that did TIDE), and other genre pictures.  While the inevitable
similarities are apparent to some extent, they certainly don't overshadow
the picture, and like the flaws discussed above, they don't keep CRIMSON
TIDE from being a worthwhile film.</P>
