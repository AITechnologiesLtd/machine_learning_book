<P>     The premise for THE PEREZ FAMILY offers the potential for a fairly 
light, somewhat quirky romantic comedy.  Unfortunately, this production 
has difficulty converting that potential into something substantial.  
There are numerous difficulties that even the deft hand of director Mira 
Nair (MISSISSIPPI MASALA) can't completely overcome.  To her credit, she 
manages to milk some entertainment value out of a script that stumbles 
around trying to find an emotional focus. </P>
<P>     The story, which takes place in 1980, centers on Juan Raul Perez 
(Alfred Molina), a Cuban political prisoner who is released from jail 
after twenty years and sent to the Florida Keys along with hundreds of 
his countrymen.  Also in the refugee group is a sugar cane worker and 
sometimes-prostitute named Dottie Perez (Marisa Tomei), who decides that 
if she and Juan pretend they're married, they can find a U.S. sponsor 
more quickly (families are placed before singles, and the larger the 
family, the faster the placement).  However, since Juan already has a 
real wife (Anjelica Huston) and daughter (Trini Alvarado) in America 
(neither of whom knows he has arrived), he's reluctant to go along with 
the charade, but that doesn't stop Dottie.  After convincing everyone 
that Juan is her husband, she sets out to recruit a "father-in-law" and 
"son", going to any lengths necessary to escape the confines of the 
Orange Bowl, which, as the refugee holding area, has become a virtual 
prison. </P>
<P>     The casting choices here are extremely strange.  Alfred Molina, an 
accomplished English actor, seems somewhat out-of-place as the brooding 
romantic lead.  Anjelica Huston is even worse as Carmela, Juan Raul's 
wife.  She's a bit too cool for this hot-blooded role, and her scenes 
with her Federal officer boyfriend, played by Chazz Palminteri, lack 
even the barest semblance of chemistry.  Marisa Tomei is probably the 
best of the bunch, but that's because everything about her character is 
so over the top:  the sensuality, the accent, and the delivery.  Tomei 
breezes across the screen with an explosion of energy. </P>
<P>     The script could have used a little tightening.  Subplots (like one 
involving Carmela's over-protective brother) meander and it takes a long 
time to get to the unnecessarily-contrived conclusion.  Even then, 
there's still a protracted denouement needed to get everyone with the 
"proper" partner.  Along the way to this conclusion, we never develop 
much feeling for the characters.  Too often, they come across as 
stereotypes and caricatures rather than real people.   </P>
<P>     Nevertheless, there's still something fascinating about THE PEREZ 
FAMILY.  Perhaps it's the way it weaves in elements of the 
American/Cuban culture conflict, or maybe it's the none-too-subtle jabs 
at the disorganized, easily-manipulated immigration process.  Whatever 
the case, this film offers some nice touches, both of the comic and 
dramatic variety, and when things work -- which they do sporadically -- 
it's usually because of these elements.   </P>
<P>     If nothing else, THE PEREZ FAMILY can be described as "colorful."  
Like Tomei's Dottie, it's often bold and brash.  This technique of film 
making is good for upbeat moments (like a disco scene), but far less 
effective when the mood turns serious.  Ultimately, however, it's this 
enthusiastic style, coupled with a real appreciation of details, that 
just barely keeps THE PEREZ FAMILY from sinking without a trace into 
romantic comedy obscurity.   </P>
