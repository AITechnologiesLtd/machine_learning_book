DINOSAUR</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * * 1/2</PRE>
<P>Directed by: Eric Leighton, Ralph Zondag
Written by: Thom Enriquez, Walon Green</P>
<P>Aladar (D.B. Sweeney) is a dinosaur with none of his own kind to be
with. As an egg, Aladar was carried away to an island dominated
entirely by monkeys.  While there, the lead monkey, Yar (Ossie Davis),
takes Aladar into his home as a son after some coaxing from his wife,
Plio (Alfre Woodard).Years later, Aladar is grown up and wishes he
could be with one of his own species.  However, before he has a chance
to think too much about how lonely he is, meteorites hit the
planet. Aladar, Yar, Plio, and Plio's children, Zini (Max Casella) and
Suri (Hayden Panettiere), are forced away from their home.  The five
soon come across a herd of other dinosaurs who are heading across the
vast deserts for the fabled nesting ground; the one remaining spot on
the planet which still has water and life. The herd is led by the
arrogant Kron (Samuel E. Wright) and his sister, Neera (Julianna
Margulies). A rivalry soon grows between Aladar and Kron. They aren't
given much time to feud however, because two cartosaurs (t-rex's) are
on their tails.</P>
<P>"Dinosaur" is the kind of movie which is going to have two age groups
gaping at the screen in awe. Kids are going to be thrilled by the
chance to see dinosaurs brought to life like they haven't been able to
see before (granted, I'm assuming their parents haven't allowed them
to see "Jurassic Park"). Anyone over the age of forty or so is going
to be shocked by how far animation has come, since "Dinosaur" is (in
some ways) even more impressive than "Toy Story". The problem is that
anyone between those two age groups will be used to seeing effects
this impressive, and there isn't enough of a story to "Dinosaur" to
hold their attention. Much of the movie consists of watching dinosaurs
walk, and walk, and walk over a whole lot of desert.  In the beginning
of the film, when we were able to see all sorts of different dinosaurs
in interesting looking jungles, this was enough to keep our
attention. Watching the same herd of dinosaurs walk over a lot of sand
for forty five minutes just doesn't work.</P>
<P>The voices in "Dinosaur" are a mixed blessing. Joan Plowright (1996's
"101 Dalmations") and Della Reese (television's "Touched by an Angel")
give some wonderful personality to two elderly dinosaurs, who befriend
Aladar and his family. Ossie Davis ("Grumpy Old Men") does a nice job
providing the elderly Yar with a subtle, comic touch. Samuel Wright
("The Little Mermaid") is a perfect choice for the stubborn, haughty
Kron. The weak links are, unfortunately, the lead
voices. D.B. Sweeney, who usually gives great performances in shows
like Fox's short lived "Strange Luck", is a rather poor choice for
Aladar. Sweeney simply sounds too experienced and, frankly, too old to
be playing a naive young "man" going out into the real world for the
first time. Julianna Margulies ("The Newton Boys") sounds strangely
cold and detached as Aladar's perspective girlfriend. Scenes where she
is forced to intervene between her brother and Aladar there is almost
no emotion in her voice. She sounds as though she's reading directly
from a que-card.  Alfre Woodard ("Love and Basketball") nicely
underplays her role as Yar's sometimes submissive, sometimes tricky
mate.</P>
<P>Let's face it, the main reason everyone is going to see "Dinosaur" is
for the insanely expensive computer animation. In fact, this is the
most expensive animated film ever created by Disney. The effects may
have cost a fortune, but they certainly are impressive. Every dinosaur
is detailed right down to the last scale and the intricacies of their
eye movements. The landscapes look shockingly real at times, and the
oceans reflect images perfectly. The animation makes up for what is
lacking in the rest of the script, but not by much. The story is even
more predictable than your usual Disney film, but the usual Disney
humor is sadly absent throughout most of the film. In movies like "Toy
Story", Disney writers did a great job combining juvenile humor and
jokes adults would find amusing. The humor in "Dinosaur" is so cheesy
and childish that adults will only be rolling their eyes while their
kids squeal in delight. The only exception is a little spiked
dinosaur, named Earl, who doesn't say a word but runs around like a
typical family dog. I hate to admit it, but I couldn't help but laugh
at his antics. I'd recommend "Dinosaur" to anyone who loves computer
animation and certainly to every kid who ever had a thing for the
giant lizards (I know, I know, they're warm blooded yadda yadda). The
movie runs a nice, fast 84 minutes, and I give it three and a half out
of five stars.</P>
