<PRE>HIGH ART (October Films)
Directed by Lisa Cholodenko</PRE>
<P>Of all the Brat Packers of the early 1980s, none was more
consistently charming and down-to-earth than Ally Sheedy. And none has kept
such a low profile in the past few years. While former co-stars such as Demi
Moore and Matthew Broderick have since become household names, Sheedy has
been toiling in films with titles like "Country Justice," "Groupies" and
"The Pickle." If you somehow managed to miss all of them, count yourself in
the majority.</P>
<P> What's initially most startling about seeing Sheedy in "High Art"
is her appearance: flat black hair, a pasty face that hasn't seen the sun in
weeks, jutting shoulder blades that threaten to burst through her blue-white
flesh. Hard to imagine this is the same young woman who was the adorably
wholesome ingenue of "St. Elmo's Fire" and "War Games." Have the years been
so unkind to her?</P>
<P> No, actually Sheedy appears to have spent her time out of the
spotlight learning the mechanics of performance. As Lucy Berliner, a
once-acclaimed photographer who drifted out of the New York art scene into a
private world of drugs and dead-end relationships, Sheedy is a genuine
revelation; gone are the days when she coasted by on charm and her
girl-next-door smile. Patricia Clarkson matches Sheedy magnificently as
Greta, an ex-film star from Germany who's now both Lucy's lover and the
albatross around her neck. Though Lucy can see the toil heroin has taken on
the older Greta -- Greta rarely has both eyes open at once and tends to fall
asleep in the midst of sex -- Lucy still can't shake her own addiction.</P>
<P> Enter downstairs neighbor Syd (Radha Mitchell), a moon-eyed
editorial assistant at Frame magazine who meets Lucy by chance and tries to
engineer a comeback for her. Lucy, who freely admits she's irresponsible, is
less interested in resuming her career than she is in pursuing intimacy with
Syd. Director Lisa Cholodenko makes no attempt to romanticize the bohemian
squalor in which Lucy and Syd live, nor does the screenplay paint the bond
between the two as a positive first step toward a better future. Instead,
both women have serious issues they hope to bury in the relationship: for
Syd, a confused sexual identity; for Lucy, an existence built around
self-destructive behavior. "High Art" opts for a rather predictable finale,
but up until that point the movie works as a compelling, well-observed
character study, tinged with razor-sharp black humor. And Sheedy's incisive
work should guarantee she won't spend the next ten years hiding her light
under a bushel.
