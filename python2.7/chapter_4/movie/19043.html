GINGERBREAD MAN, THE (director: Robert Altman; cast: Kenneth Branagh
(Rick Magruder), Embeth Davidtz (Mallory Doss), Robert Downey Jr. (Clyde
Pell), Daryl Hannah (Lois Harlan), Robert Duvall (Dixon Doss), Tom
Berenger (Pete Randle), Famke Janssen (Leeanne), Jesse James (Jeff), Mae
Whitman (Libby), 1998)</P>
<P>This wasn't a bad film, as much as it was a mediocre one. It is taken
from a paper thin story by the renown pulp writer of the vox populi,
John Grisham (the screenplay is credited to Al Hayes, but rumored to
have been re-written by Robert Altman). It was directed with
misdirection by the legendary director Robert Altman (M*A*S*H (69),
McCabe & Mrs. Miller (71), The Long Goodbye (73), Nashville (75)), who
has never directed a thriller quite like this one before, and shows with
this film that his enormous talent, probably, does not lie with this
genre. The only thing that saves this movie from being a complete bust
is the marvelously energetic cast. They took this inane formula story
seriously and did a fine job in keeping it going.</P>
<P>In particular, I liked Duvall's Dixon Doss portrayal of the supposedly
insane father of Mallory Doss (Davidtz). A minor part for Duvall, but a
good diversion from the constantly intense and impetuous performance of
Branagh's (Magruder) amoral, Southern accented, slick Savannah lawyer.
Branagh might be a capable British Shakespearian actor, but he has a
tendency to chew up his scenes, which he does here, to the further
detriment of the film.</P>
<P>That Altman did such a haphazard job in directing this thriller, is
proven in the first fifteen minutes of the movie, when he gives away the
plot by anxiously holding his attention too long on an obvious set-up
situation. If you didn't know that the lawyer was going to be set-up by
the low-life Mallory, who literally throws her nude body on this
divorced father/lawyer, whose only redeeming quality is that he loves
his children, then you must have been out getting popcorn in the lobby
while that scene was taking place. As a result, with all the tension
taken out of the film, in the very beginning of it, the only reason for
seeing the rest of the film has become dissolved into watching how well
the actors could work without a well-developed story.</P>
<P>The plot revolves around a surprise party being given for Magruder, who
is coming off a victory in court, where he got his client off by
thrashing the police. Here he meets the waitress Mallory who needs a
ride home after her car is missing and there is a big rain storm. Once
at home, the seduction takes place. Magruder and Mallory from now on
become inseparable, or maybe not. So the obvious set-up begins and
Magruder is unwittingly drawn into a whacky families' dirty business.</P>
<P>Magruder becomes the lawyer for Mallory, who is accusing her father of
stalking and harassing her. She succeeds in getting him put away. But
the dangerous father escapes and begins to make not only the life of his
daughter hell but also her lawyer's life, as he kidnaps Magruder's
child.</P>
<P>When the best part of the movie for me, is watching the hurricane take
place, and I know that the weather conditions has little to do with the
story, except as setting a mood, then I'm certain that I haven't been
swept away by this film. There was, as far as I could tell, no
particular character development of the principal players, no intense
drama taking place, no new insights into the judicial system, or
compassion felt for any one remotely connected with this story. I found
myself trying to figure out why there is such a huge market for
Grisham's stories, and it sure beats me...</P>
<P>The film becomes an Actor's Studio venture, with the following
characters acting out their supporting roles with varying degrees of
effectiveness: Clyde Pell (Robert Downey Jr.) appears to be the most
likable one in the film, playing a fun-loving alcoholic private dick and
buddy of Magruder. Pete Randle (Tom) is scary as Mallory's ex-husband.
Daryll Hannah is the busybody aide in Magruder's office. Famke Janssen
is Leeanne, Rick's nondescript ex-wife. They all make an earnest
contribution to a film that would have served Altman better if it wasn't
so thin a story
he was telling.</P>
