<PRE>                          MIDNIGHT COWBOY
                            [Spoilers]
                   A film review by Ahmed I Shibab
                    Copyright 1996 Ahmed I Shibab</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: ****  (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>     This "dumb" cowboy blondie who thinks he is a `darn' good
loverboy, decides to leave his dusty ol' town somewhere in Texas and go
to New  York.  He puts on his beloved Cowboy attire and off he hops on
the next New York coach.</P>
<P>     When he arrives to New York, he immediately sets out to play Mr
Playboy thinking he is the best `darn' `stud' in the whol'o' New York
City.  Obviously he fails.</P>
<P>     He meets the 'cripple' Rico (Dustin Hoffman, who is terrifically
good) in a bar.  Rico has a leg that is paralysed from the knee down,
so he walks in a peculiar way.  Rico is a thief and wants to get some
money off this 'rich' dumb  Cowboy.  He cheats our Cowboy out of $20
through a somewhat detailed routine and disappears.</P>
<P>     Soon, our cowboy runs out of money: he gets kicked out of his
hotel, and starts getting hungry.  Walking through the city, with
"Everybody's talkin'" playing in the background (oh, and his prided
techno transistor radio in hand), he spots Rico in a cafe.</P>
<P>     Rico, half-scared, pours out all the money in his pocket. 60
filthy cents.  Our cowboy, hungry, is forgiving.  He is glad he found
someone he knows.  Rico offers to make it up for him.  And he invites
him to his place.  And what a filthy, cold place it is.  Our cowboy
falls asleep instantly in the (junk) bed.  When he finally wakes
(jumps?) up, he finds Rico looking at him. "You wanna cup'a'coffee?"
Rico asks in his friendly, sleazy, somewhat-childish manner while he
smokes on a ciggy.</P>
<PRE>     "What're you?  A goddamn faggot? What do you want from me?  Where
are my shoes?  What did you do to them?"</PRE>
<P>     But all his doubts turn out to be unfounded.  Rico really has a
heart.  Together, they live in the junk apartment and almost freeze to
death.  Rico is convinced that the best place to be is Florida, where
the sun shines beautifully and there are lots of coconut trees.  But he
falls sick and is convinced that his cure is to go to Florida.</P>
<P>     "We will soon be in Miami" is the last sentence uttered in this
film and what a shocking, moving end of a film it is.  The classic
theme music: "Midnight Cowboy" helps bring about the feeling of
attachment that most viewers will experience towards the end of the
film.  Whether the attachment is to the two main characters or to their
dreams, is probably as debatable as whether it was the acting or the
direction that makes this film so memorable.</P>
