<P>Ah, yes, The Untouchables. I do not believe that I am exaggerating when 
I say that Brian De Palma's grand 1987 cops-'n-robbers epic is one of 
the best films of the 1980s, as well as one of the best movies ever to 
be based on a TV show, and one of the best entries in this director's 
canon. Sure, it plays fast and loose with the historical record of its 
time and place like nobody's business, and sure, there's not exactly 
much in the way of plot, but boy oh boy, is this great entertainment.</P>
<P>Which is good, because considering the caliber of people involved in 
this project, I don't think it unreasonable to expect something a little 
better. Don't get me wrong. De Palma defied all my expectations with 
this picture, delivering something truly inspired. His able cast and 
superb technical crew have also outdone themselves. But I have to say 
that the performance by Robert DeNiro and the screenplay by David Mamet 
leave something to be desired. I don't know. Maybe they were saving 
themselves for their extraordinary collaboration in John Frankenheimer's 
masterful Ronin, ten years later. But The Untouchables packs such a 
punch that ultimately it's very easy to gloss over their -- I can't 
believe I'm writing this -- inadequacies.</P>
<P>We are in Chicago, in the year 1930. Al Capone (DeNiro), a punk from New 
York, has risen to a postion of undisputed power over the city's 
bootlegging trade. And he enforces his rule with an iron fist; no one is 
safe from his reign of terror, not even a pretty little girl who gets 
blown to shreds when Capone's top gun, Frank Nitti (Billy Drago) plants 
a bomb in a tavern whose owners won't play ball with Capone. The federal 
government, responding to a plea from Chicago's legitimate city 
government, sends in Treasury Department special agent Eliot Ness (Kevin 
Costner) to oversee a program that will bring down Capone. Ness's 
initial efforts don't meet with much success; saddled with a legion of 
corrupt cops and the recipient of a bad tip, his first raid is an 
embarrasment that lands him on the front pages, for all the wrong 
reasons.</P>
<P>A chance meeting with a honest veteran street cop, Jimmy Malone (Sean 
Connery) convinces Ness that he's going to have to change his tactics. 
Deciding to work from outside the thoroughly rotten Chicago police 
department, he recruits his own strike team; himself, Malone, 
mild-mannered accountant Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), who 
thinks that he might be able to nail Capone on tax evasion charges, and 
George Stone (Andy Garcia), a rookie policeman from Chicago's South Side 
who's the best shot in the Academy. Quickly dubbed `the Untouchables' by 
friends and enemies alike, they set about decimating the Capone empire 
any way they can. But Capone's not going to give up his absolute power 
without a fight...</P>
<P>I'm going to state right up front that this is not, repeat not, the way 
it happened in real life. For one thing, Capone's downfall didn't happen 
until 1931. There really was an Eliot Ness, and he really did have a 
squad of agents called the Untouchables, but their efforts were 
exaggerated by newspaper accounts of the day -- I think, to convince 
Capone that things were worse than they actually were and thereby cause 
him to make a mistake which Ness and his crew could use against him. And 
yes, Capone was brought down by a mild-mannered accountant, Elmer N. 
Irey, but he was not, to the best of my knowledge, on Ness's team. 
However, the version of this story presented to us in the classic Robert 
Stack TV series from the late 50's, the rather short-lived but enjoyable 
revival in the early 90's, and this picture, is infinitely more 
entertaining. It's like a classic 30's Warner Bros. gangster movie, only 
one in which the good guys not only win, but are the stars of the show.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the film doesn't have a script quite as good as those 
epics of yesteryear. Mamet's screenplay here is not one of his best; it 
doesn't have the sort of plotting that have marked his best outings as 
screenwriter and director -- House of Games, The Spanish Prisoner -- and 
it depends on cliche and contrivance. Events necessary to give the 
Untouchables the opportunities they need to nail Capone just sort of 
happen, without any real rhyme or reason, and are explained by having 
Malone say something like `If you want to keep a secret, don't tell the 
boss.' It also doesn't have the staccato dialogue we've come to expect, 
and maybe even demand, from Mamet in peak form. Maybe he figured that 
his usual style would be off-putting to a mainstream audience that's not 
all that familiar with his work. But when you see `Written by David 
Mamet' in the opening credits, it's not unreasonable to have certain 
expectations, and the script doesn't fulfill them.
There's another problem with the film, and Robert DeNiro is its name. 
It's bad enough that Mamet has drastically underwritten the role of 
Capone and that we never really get to know him (as if we really wanted 
to get to know somebody like Al Capone), but DeNiro, who in trying to 
look like Capone ends up looking in my mind like Robert Duvall, doesn't 
exactly apply himself, despite having done his usual 
let's-gamble-with-my-own-health-by-gaining 
-a-lot-of-weight-in-order-to-look-the-part bit. He's also too old for 
the role. One of the aspects of the Capone legacy that I find both 
fascinating and frightening is that Capone was born in 1899. The St. 
Valentine's Day Massacre, which occured when Capone was at the peak of 
his power, took place in 1929. That means that Capone had built a 
staggering empire of crime and corruption by the time he was thirty 
years old; the most powerful gangster of the Prohibition era was still a 
relatively young man when he rose to dominance. De Niro, who was about 
forty-three when the film was made, was, and looked, too old to play 
Capone. Don't get me wrong. I am not one to argue with De Niro's 
reputation as perhaps the greatest American film actor of his 
generation, because I agree with it. And if this had been made in, say, 
1977 instead of 1987, De Niro's being too old for the role wouldn't have 
been an issue. But in casting De Niro for his presence, which happened a 
lot back in the mid- to late-80's, the filmmakers made something of a 
miscalculation.</P>
<P>They did not make a miscalculation in hiring Brian De Palma to direct 
this picture. In spite of his (undeserved) reputation as a Hitchcock 
ripoff artist, a cynic, a misanthrope, and a misogynist, and in spite of 
the drubbing that his new film Mission to Mars is about to take, De 
Palma remains my favorite director of all time, and I was reminded of 
why when watching this film. I haven't been able to find out what 
attracted De Palma to the project -- whether he saw it as an artistic 
challenge, or Paramount paid him a king's ransom, or he originated the 
project himself -- but it doesn't matter, because he has turned out one 
of his best films. It may not have the emotional resonance of previous 
pictures like Carrie or Blow Out and later pictures like Casualties of 
War and Carlito's Way, which together comprise his all-time greatest 
hits, but for sheer entertainment in the De Palma oeuvre, you can't do 
much better than The Untouchables (wait, didn't I say the same thing 
about De Palma's The Fury? Well, The Untouchables is even more 
entertaining). It may be that Mamet's script is actually an asset -- in 
paring it down to essentials, minimalist that he is, Mamet has given De 
Palma the ability to make a film that's consistently exciting, because 
without the excess fat of such niceties as character development and 
intricate plotting (which of course are always an asset, but sometimes, 
yes, you can do without them), De Palma can get down to business. 
Specifically, `sequences.' De Palma's films always have elaborate action 
and suspense sequences, long stretches of film, sometimes without 
dialogue, in which the emphasis is on pure filmmaking. The Untouchables
 has several such sequences -- the shootout at the Canadian border, the 
stalking of Jimmy Malone in his apartment by a Capone operative, and the 
legendary slow-motion gun battle in the LaSalle Street train station, 
with its ingenious homage to, or flagrant ripoff of, depending on your 
perspective (I'll go with the former), the famed Odessa Steps sequence 
in Sergei Eisenstein's The Battleship Potemkin. I haven't seen Potemkin, 
and so I won't do what every other critic in America by now has done, 
which is either extol or excoriate De Palma for this little stylistic 
touch. But I will say that it is one of the most exciting action 
sequences I've ever seen in a movie. The tension in this scene is so 
thick, you could cut it with a knife. And it leads to an incredibly 
suspenseful moment in which the entire outcome of the picture depends on 
whether or not Andy Garcia's character is as good a shot as he's 
supposed to be.</P>
<P>But all is not sequences in De Palma's films, and indeed, the entire 
film is a masterpiece of virtuoso filmmaking. There are nifty tracking 
shots, brilliantly composed matte shots that capture the essence of the 
Prohibition era, sumptuous period production design by Patrizia Von 
Brandenstein, and a dynamic, emotionally rich score by Ennio Morricone. 
And it has a number of striking performances. Even if Kevin Costner's 
career doesn't survive the unholy fiasco that was The Postman, he can 
always be proud of his performance in this film. Simple goodness, as one 
critic has pointed out, is one of the hardest traits for an actor to 
embody, and yet Costner is able to do so. And it's interesting how 
Ness's fundamental decency, as played by Costner, is what's standing in 
the way of his getting the job done. `Didn't you hear what I said?' he 
frustratedly thunders at the corpse of a mobster he's just blown away, 
after the man ignored his entreaties to surrender. `What is this, a 
game?' Even as he's violating the law he swore to uphold, there's still 
a part of him that wants to stay by the book -- and expects the bad guys 
to do the same. Sean Connery, in his Academy-Award-winning role, applies 
all of his charisma, gusto, energy, and wit to Jimmy Malone, and while I 
might have preferred to see him given such an award for performances 
like The Man Who Would Be King, The Offence or The Russia House, his 
work here is more than worthy of the honor. Rounding out the 
Untouchables themselves, Charles Martin Smith provides solid, appealing 
comic relief, and Andy Garcia is a likable presence as Stone, the voice 
of reason (within obvious limits) on Ness's squad (a precursor to his 
role in Ridley Scott's Black Rain, perhaps?). And DeNiro, for all my 
griping earlier about his being too old for the part, is dynamic and 
villainous as Al Capone. Too bad Mamet didn't give him a meatier role.</P>
<P>The Untouchables is a superb crowd-pleaser, a guilt-free shoot-'em-up 
that never fails to entertain. It's also an example of a great director 
at the height of his powers. Brian De Palma has made some fine films 
since The Untouchables, but none that provide as much sheer fun as this. 
After ten years, it still holds up amazingly well, and even if De 
Palma's career doesn't survive the debacle that I fear Mission to Mars
 is about to become (though I haven't lost hope yet), he can always 
count this film as one of his true masterpieces.
