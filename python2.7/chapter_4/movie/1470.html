<PRE>                           DAUGHTERS OF THE DUST
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<PRE>120 min., not rated, Drama/Documentary, 1992
Director: Julie Dash</PRE>
<P>     The film is about a tribe of African people who used to be slaves
and are now living on a series of islands off the coast of South
Carolina and Georgia.  They have their own culture and speak a mixture
of American and their native tongue.  Their islands are now threatened.
The basic plot behind the film covers one family leaving their island.</P>
<P>     This is going to be a relatively short review because I only
watched half an hour before I got completely bored with this film.
Because of the number of people on the network who disliked this film
compared with those who liked the film I didn't go to see it when it
played at the art theater in my area.   One week later it came on public
television, and I figured I would try it for free.  I found the film to
be incredibly boring, and I am glad that I didn't pay any money to see
the film.   Someone who is really interested in these people might like
this film; I don't know.  On a scale of zero to five I give this film a
zero.  DAUGHTERS OF THE DUST is not rated and doesn't contain anything
objectionable.</P>
<P>     The cinematography was beautiful, and so were the islands.   I
think that this was the best part of the film, and why I lasted half an
hour.  The actors/actresses also did a great job.  The fault lies in the
writing.  The dialogue was boring and the people spoke in a way that was
hard to understand, so it took a lot of concentration to follow the
dialog.</P>
<P>     I don't recommend this film unless you are interested in a
documentary type film on these people or if you will watch a film just
for the photography.  The photography probably looks better in a theater
on a large screen than on a television screen, so if that is your reason
for seeing the film I suggest that you see it in the theater.  If you do
decide to go see DAUGHTERS OF THE DUST, I suggest matinee prices if
available.</P>
