<PRE>The World is Not Enough (1999)</PRE>
<P> "Why can't you just say 'hello,' like a normal person?"</P>
<P>Starring Pierce Brosnan, Sophie Marceau, Robert Carlyle, Denise
Richards, Judi Dench. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>Why can't James Bond just say "hello" like a normal person instead of
the cocky "The name is Bond, James Bond" staple? I don't think people
get a kick out of it anymore. Instead of eliciting knowing nods, it
produces lame chuckles. It's worn out and it needs to go the way of
Timothy Dalton. As a matter of fact, it's not the only thing that needs
to be eliminated from Bond's repertoire. I move for all trademark
phrases to be erased. That means buh-bye, "Martini, shaken, not
stirred." No more "talking killer." Here's a franchise desperately in
need of a reworking, and I don't mean erasing all sentimental value and
making a conventional thriller. I mean completely original, more tongue-
in-cheek humorand less self-importance. After 19 installments, the old
tradition is wearing thin.</P>
<P>Bond's latest escapade, uncleverly titled The World is Not Enough, runs
through all the regular conventions -- catch phrases, bodacious babes,
bad puns, et al -- except they aren't as much fun. The maniacal
supervillain this time around is Renard (Robert Carlyle), an aspiring
oil tycoon with a bullet embedded in his cranium. The bullet makes him
immune to pain and while it will eventually kill him, he grows stronger
and stronger until the day he dies. His evil plan for world domination
involves taking over a pipeline owned by the sexy Elektra (Sophie
Marceau) whose father was just killed in a bombing at Bond's
headquarters.</P>
<P>007 is dispatched by head honcho M (the formidable Judi Dench, playing
my favorite character in the series) to help Elektra, but whether she
actually needs help is debatable. Is she really the good girl she seems
to be? Or does she have an ulterior motive in this risky endeavor. Any
guesses? Anyone?</P>
<P>Things get personal when Renard kidnaps M. Rescuing her becomes Bond's
highest priority and he enlists the help of a gorgeous nuclear
physicist named Christmas Jones (Denise Richards, and by the way, where
do you get off saying a women is not interested in men at all and then
have her wear shorts above the thigh and revealing tanktops? Oh, never
mind, this is a Bond movie. I get it now. Beg your pardon.) to diffuse
the bomb Renard has planted in the pipeline and get to the place where
he's stashed away Bond's beloved boss.</P>
<P>This is the same old stuff except the camp value has all but
disappeared, the action isn't as exciting and the puns get lamer every
second. Director Michael Apted (responsible for, along with about 40
other movies, Nell and Gorillas in the Mist; this is, however, his
first crack at a 007 feature), who's a film veteran if ever there was
one, doesn't inject the movie with enough life; the action, with the
exception of one scene involving a bomb and a quickly moving
contraption inside a pipeline, seems perfunctory and mundane. For all
the flaws of Tomorrow Never Dies, at least that installment, helmed by
Roger Spottiswoode, had its share of exhilirating chase sequences and
inventive gadgetry. The World is Not Enough doesn't even have any cool
new Bond gizmos to amuse us with.</P>
<P>Pierce Brosnan is no Sean Connery, but he is one of the better things
about this movie. Charming and charismatic, I'd have to say he is the
best Bond since Connery left the scene to pursue romantic film
relations with women about 1/3 his age. Sophie Marceau and Denise
Richards are both fairly atrocious though, and while a good Bond goes
along way, he can't pull the whole movie out of the water when it's
desperately drowning.</P>
<P>When Bond was resurrected in 1995 with Goldeneye, the world accepted it
because of what can only be called the novelty of the old. People went
six years without Bond and all the old Bond traditions brought back to
life seemed new and cool again. Now that's worn off and the MGM
franchise is in need of some new life. Keep Brosnan. Change everything
else.</P>
