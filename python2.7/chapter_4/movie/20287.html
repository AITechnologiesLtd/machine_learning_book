<PRE>** out of four</PRE>
<P> Starring Claire Danes, Bill Pullman. Rated PG-13</P>
<P>I've seen Brokedown Palace twice before. The first time it was called
Red Corner and then Return to Paradise (you are welcome to click on the
link and refresh your memory concerning the latter as I will come back
to it numerous times in this review). This, then, is nothing but typical
Hollywood recycling of earlier, superior movies. Such rehashing almost
never makes anything decent and the resulting film suffers all the more
if its predecessors are still fresh in our minds.</P>
<P>The first scene has "Yankee" Hank, a lawyer, receive an audio tape in
the mail. He inserts the tape into a player and listens to the story of
Alice (Claire Danes) and Darlene (Kate Beckinsale) two recent high
school graduates who come to Thailand on vacation and meet a charming
Australian fellow who convinces them to go to Hong Kong with him. At the
airport they are stopped by police who find an inordinate amount of
cocaine in one of their backpacks. Alice was carrying the backpack and
Darlene was the one who packed it but both claim to have no idea where
the narcotics came from.</P>
<P>They are arrested and taken to a typically brutal and unlivable Eastern-
world penetentiary where one of the girls is deceived into signing a
confession. The girls are then urged to consult with a lawyer, as there
is no sign of the mysterious Aussie, whom the girls suspect of planting
the drugs in their luggage. The lawyers they talk to both advise that
they plead guilty to the crime in hopes that the judge is lenient and
sentences them to a mere 40 years in jail as opposed to life. If they
plead innocent and are unable to provide indemnifying evidence, the
lawyer says, then the judge will not think twice before sending them to
jail for the rest of their lives.</P>
<P>In the movie's most compelling act, Darlene's father arrives at the
scene and attempts to enlist the help of the American embassy. Not
surprisingly, he gets no help from the embassy, leaving Alice and
Darlene with but one hope: the services of "Yankee" Hank Green, who is
more than sympathetic to the girls' cause but is equally concerned about
money and his other pressing cases.</P>
<P>Brokedown Palace is most reminiscent of last year's near-brilliant
Return to Paradise which placed a riveting moral dilemma in what was
essentially the same plot. This is the Hollywood version of Return to
Paradise; a sanitized reworking of what was a breathtakingly real work.
That movie was resolved mercilessly and believably while the resolution
here comes off as a contrivance. Paradise was a brilliantly pulled off
morality play which asked a thoughtful, (hopefully) rhetorical question:
would you sacrifice X years of your life to save a friend by taking
responsibility for your own mistakes or would you let him hang? Palace
is the "Monkey-see monkey-do" movie; a film in which the director leaves
the audience with nothing to do but just watch the protagonists' dilemma
unfold and sympathize with them.</P>
<P>But my biggest problem with Brokedown Palace isn't its blatant
hollowness but rather its ending. It's not even the fact that it's
contrived, as I mentioned earlier. What angered me is how the filmmakers
found a way to have their cake and eat it too, and in the process ended
their film on a glaringly false note. As much as I want to describe
exactly what I mean here, I cannot for fear of spoiling the film for
those who, despite my fervent admonitions, decide to see it; I will,
however say this: Brokedown Palace has one of its characters do
something that it claims is the right thing to do. At first glance the
here unspecified action may ring true, but with a little thought you
realize that it is probably the worst possible thing said character
could have done.</P>
<P>There are some things worthwhile in this most flawed of films. Although
Kate Beckinsale is phony in a lead role, Claire Danes is wonderful. Her
extraordinary talent manages to surprise me even the times when I fully
expect a compelling performance. Bill Pullman, never known for emoting,
is stoic but effective as "Yankee" Hank, although his character is taken
directly out of the proverbial "Screenwriter's Guide to Movie Cliches."</P>
<P>Somewhere near you there is a video store. Instead of going to the
theater to see Brokedown Palace rent Return to Paradise instead. Please.
It is the American moviegoer who needs to show Hollywood that sub-par
pseudo-remakes of good movies will not fly. I'm starting a crusade.
