<PRE>THE SWEET HEREAFTER *** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>starring Ian Holm, Sarah Polley, Bruce Greenwood, Tom McCamus
written by Atom Egoyan, based on the novel by Russell Banks
directed by Atom Egoyan</P>
<P>No filmmaker deconstructs a story as well as Atom Egoyan. I'm
referring, specifically, to the narrative form. In The Sweet
Hereafter, Egoyan tells his story in a similar framework to his
Exotica or The Adjuster. Said story, of a fatal school bus accident in
the small town of Sam Dent, British Columbia, that shatters the morale
of the locals, is told in a most unstraightforward manner.</P>
<P>When the film opens, the accident has already happened, and Stephens
(the wonderful Holm), a polite ambulance-chaser, has arrived with the
promise of a lawsuit that will eek out the truth of what really
occurred that fateful morning.  Throughout, we get to meet the parents
of the dead, broken souls who follow Stephens like "The Pied Piper"
(passages of which are read during the film). But there is one living
passenger, the paralyzed Nicole (Polley), whose dark secrets of a life
before the accident may affect her decision to testify.</P>
<P>We finally do see the accident, about three quarters into the film,
which is a stunning visual effect. A horrific long take that shows the
bus sliding, then stopping, then collapsing into a frozen lake, is the
best digital trickery in any movie this year and, perhaps, ever, in a
motion picture.</P>
<P>The fractured narrative also intercuts a preoccupied Stephens on an
airplane, traveling to meet his HIV-positive runaway daughter, as well
as glimpses of the artificially happy lives these people led
pre-accident.</P>
<P>I have a problem not with the story or story structure, but with
Egoyan's heavy- handedness behind the camera. For the first hour or
so, I can quite honestly say I was on the verge of tears; these are
miserable, miserable people. But that's just the problem: so anguished
are these folk that sympathy wanes after a while, when a lot of
sadness becomes too much. Also, a subplot involving incest rings
untrue. Perhaps it wouldn't feel so contrived if it weren't shot in
such a tasteful manner. There are two characters who are father and
daughter; when they first appeared I thought they were lovers. I was
half-right.</P>
<P>Nevertheless it's worth-seeing. The delightful critic Geoff Pevere
recently wrote that "American films are about action, Canadian films
are about consequences," hence a recent wave of films about the
effects of shock and death from Toronto directors, including Crash and
Kissed. The Sweet Hereafter is much better than either of these two
films, simply because it's not boring or, in the case of Kissed,
afraid of its own material (necrophilia). Egoyan is a fine, fine,
postmodern storyteller, whose work is entertaining, edgy and smart, if
a bit too intellectual at times. Though I harped on the weightiness of
the material, I was always absorbed, engrossed, and surprised by The
Sweet Hereafter.</P>
