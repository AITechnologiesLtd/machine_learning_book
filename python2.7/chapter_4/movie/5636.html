                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1996 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>(1995) ** - C:Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Jon
Voight, Ashley Judd, Wes Studi, Mykelti Williamson, Natalie Portman, Jeremy
Piven, Hank Azaria.</P>
<P>Finally, the two greatest actors of our generation, De Niro and Pacino,
appear together in a film (they were both in "Godfather II" but never shared
a scene together). Actually, one could almost argue that they don't share a
scene together in "Heat" either. Their characters have three scenes
together, but the way they are shot, the two never really appear on screen
at the same time, which is a huge disappointment, much like the film itself.</P>
<P>I have a theory about "Heat" and the people who like it. I have seen the
film twice now. The first time I left the theater thinking, "Hmmmm, well
that was pretty good." Here's why. You go into the film with huge
expectations. I mean, De Niro and Pacino! Cops verses bad guys! A heist
movie! How bad can it be? Also, the film is almost three hours long. Well,
there must be a lot of story to tell here. Then, when the film ends, a
triumphant music score plays as you're leaving the theater, making you think
that you've just seen a good movie. So people leave with the impression they
they have just watched a fine motion picture. But, there were many things
that started to bother me the more that I thought about them, so I decided
to give the film a second chance when released on video. And I was right in
my assumptions.</P>
<P>I asked others who had liked "Heat" what exactly it was that they liked
about the film. No one could really answer the question. A friend of mine
told me that the film was all about how people change, which is a ridiculous
statement to me and if you read on you'll understand why.</P>
<P>The rest of this review contains spoilers, so if you haven't seen the film I
suggest you stop reading here.</P>
<P>I have no problem with long movies. As long as a movie is good, it can go on
forever as far as I'm concerned. But "Heat" is unnecessarily long. Countless
subplots are completely unnecessary, and scenes run on forever. For example,
Pacino and his girlfriend have a discussion, and Pacino gets mad and storms
out of the room. The scene should end. But no, he goes to the kitchen, looks
around, stands there and thinks, and then exits. A minute and a half to two
minutes that we don't need to see. And many scenes are like that. Characters
looking at things, reacting to things forever, stuff we just don't need to
see.</P>
<P>There are so many unnecessary subplots here. For the first hour and a half,
every few scenes or so we see this black guy applying for a job, talking to
his girlfriend, etc. What does this have to do with anything? His character
does figure into the big heist at the end, but why is his character worthy
of background info? We don't get any on the characters that we are
interested in. De Niro's a crook, that's all we ever get to know. Tom
Sizemore and Val Kilmer work for him, that's all we know. How do they all
know each other? How long have they been working together? Never explained.
Nah, we don't need to know that, but let's watch this very minor character
cook on a grill at a diner and argue with his boss. Yeah, ok. Then there's
the daughter of Pacino's girlfriend, who towards the end of the film
attempts suicide. Pointless, has nothing to do with anything. No reason we
have to be subjected to that. Her character was only in two other scenes, so
who cares? There are two romantic subplots here and neither of them work
because neither of them are interesting.</P>
<P>Then, there's stuff that just doesn't make any sense. De Niro's character
seems to be very detailed about his work. Everything is planned perfectly
and back-up plans are always ready to go. He knows exactly what he's doing
and where he'll be at all times. Yet for the first heist of the film he's
hired this psychotic to work with his team. And this guy is really nuts.
Obviously he would have some sort of criminal record, something De Niro
would have checked. Also, after the heist the four criminals leave a
resturaunt and proceed to attempt to kill the psycho because he almost
botched the heist, because he's a psycho. So De Niro beats him to the
ground, pulls out his gun and prepares to blow the psycho away as the team
watches. Then a police car drives by, distracting them for about three
seconds. They look down, the psycho is gone. They look around, but in a
period of about ten seconds the psycho has completely vanished without
making a sound. Ridiculous.</P>
<P>"Heat" is by no means anywhere close to being original. There's not one
scene in the film that hasn't been done a million times before. For example,
De Niro and crew are planning the final heist and they know that Pacino and
the other cops are on their trail. So they all discuss if they should
participate or not. When they get to Tom Sizemore, they tell him, "Look,
you've got a wife, a kid, and you have more money than you could ever spend
in a lifetime... don't do this. Walk away now." Sizemore refuses, and they
keep pressuring him, remind him of what he has. So obviously Sizemore is
going to die. It's a ridiculous cliche. And he does. Also, there's a scene
in the film towards the end that if it had stopped there and the credits
would have rolled, I would have been satisfied. It's when De Niro is driving
away with his new girlfriend, smiling because he's finally happy, and when
Pacino and his girlfriend are in the hospital waiting for the daughter to
recover. Pacino tells her that he'll be there for her when she needs him.
This would had been slightly more original because THEN the film would have
been about how people can change. But no, De Niro turns the car around to
take care of some more crime business, and Pacino runs off to catch him. Oh,
so the cop keeps being a cop and the criminal keeps being a criminal. Gee,
I've never seen that before in my life. Groundbreaking.</P>
<P>I place complete blame for this dismal failure on writer/director Michael
Mann. He just had no earthly idea what he ws doing here. He had no control
over Pacino, because every once in a while he would break into his character
from "Scent of a Woman", yelling at times for no reason. He had a nice
trailer put together for the film, and then used different takes in the
actual film itself. But the takes used in the trailer were much better than
the actual takes that were in the film! Val Kilmer's character has maybe
eight lines and spends most of the film wandering around with a weird
expression on his face like his head is empty or something. "Heat" had SO
much potential that the first time you see it, you just can't admit that it
was bad, because you so desperately wanted it to be good. And the truth is
that it's just as bad as everything else, it just has better actors in it.</P>
