<PRE>                 AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY
                       A film review by Rodney Mayton
                        Copyright 1997 Rodney Mayton</PRE>
<PRE>A film by Mike Myers
1997, 87min. Rated PG</PRE>
<PRE>** out of five</PRE>
<P>        "Shagadellic!", "Groovy, Baby!" "Smashing!" adorn the 1/4 page ad
for this movie tabbed as "the #1 comedy in America" as of May 8th. Did we
attend the same movie?! At 87 minutes it seemed overlong, like a SNL skit
on steroids, and at any length it seemed unfunny. Yes, the sets and
costumes were an interesting exaggeration of 60s Pop frills, and yes, the
concept, dealing with a 60s secret agent/pop icon (played by Myers)
awakened from his cryogenic slumber to battle his arch enemy (Dr. Evil,
also played by Myers) in the present day, had a great deal of potential.
        Fun costumes and scenery and potential do not a movie make so lets
 throw in a hefty dose of bathroom humor. Don't get me wrong, I like a
good "bubbles in the bathtub joke" as much as the next person, but to have
this type of humor be the funniest thing about your movie is a waste of
yuor talent and my money. 
        But, the way things work these days in the movie business, all a
film has to do is call itself the funniest and people will believe it. I
do give this film 2 out of 5 stars because of the sets, costumes, and
sadly, unmet potential.  <HR>Rodney Paul Mayton
