<P>"Horror movie sequels suck," says a film student at one point. "The entire
horror genre was destroyed by sequels." I couldn't agree more considering the
junk that preceded the original "Scream" such as "Halloween: The Curse of
Michael Myers" or "Wes Craven's New Nightmare" to name a few. I approached
"Scream 2" with the same kind of dread: why make a sequel to a self-referential
movie that didn't exactly ask for a follow-up? Surprisingly, "Scream 2" is that
rare sequel that is far superior to the original in every aspect - it is
wittier, funnier, bloodier and, double surprise, more cunning and clever. It's
also a more effective commentary on teens and twentysomethings who get wrapped
up in the mundane slasher/horror films of yesteryear. </P>
<P>"Scream 2" brings back Sidney (Neve Campbell), the strong screaming heroine
from the original Scream, who now has a new boyfriend (Jerry O'Connell), and is
attending a midwestern school called Windsor College. This time, she has
caller-ID and can tell when someone is playing a prank on her. Jamie Kennedy is
also back as the geeky survivor from the original who is now a geeky film
student at the same college. All is well until someone dressed in the Edvard
Munch-like mask and black cape begins to stalk the streets again. The killer is
now hacking off girls at the college's sorority, a group whom Sidney wisely
decided not to join (Shades of "Black Christmas"). The corpses begin to pile up
forcing tabloid reporter/superstar Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) to unwisely
report on the murderous news, once again. These incidents also bring the former
police officer Dewey (David Arquette), another survivor from the original, back
to visit his old friends and to rekindle his romance with the unwilling Gale.
And we also see Liev Schreiber (he had a brief cameo in "Scream") as the
wrongly convicted Cotton who's looking for a little pay back.</P>
<P>"Scream 2" might seem like just another slasher picture with better actors, but
it is more than that - it manages to be a sequel-within-a-sequel film that
keeps referring back to itself in clever, original ways. For example, we see
that Gale's book on the events in the first film had been made into a feature
film called "Stab." We see clips from the film starring Heather Graham ("Boogie
Nights") in the Drew Barrymore role, and Tori Spelling as Sidney, an actress
whom the real Sidney had scoffed at in the first film. And then we have the
coup de resistance: the opening sequence set in a movie theatre showing the
film "Stab" where most of the audience is in costume waving fake knives.
However, the real killer may be somewhere in the theatre. </P>
<P>And there are the requisite in-jokes and little asides. My favorite is when
Gale refers to her nude Website as her head on "Jennifer Aniston's body." I
also liked the scene where the geeky film student is talking to the killer on a
cell phone: "My favorite scary movie is 'Showgirls'. Very frightening." And the
aforementioned sequel discussion in film class is a classic. </P>
<P>"Scream 2" is very effective in establishing its characters including Sidney,
the 90's horror version of Jamie Lee Curtis impressively played by Neve
Campbell, who still harbors certain doubts about the people in her life, such
as her boyfriend who may or may not be the killer. Campbell has several good
scenes, and she, once again, makes Sidney a sympathetic, heroic character. She
has a very moving scene where she is performing the part of Cassandra on stage
stalked by actors in demon outfits. One of them turns out to be the killer
wearing the mask, or was it just a hallucination? Courteney Cox is more
animated and hilarious, this time, as the media-obsessed Gale who has a
fixation on the killer and can't wait to see when he'll strike next. She has a
hysterically funny scene where she hires a new cameraman who's hesitant to work
for her because he might get killed like the last one. "He wasn't gutted. I
made that up. His throat was slashed," admits Gale. The cameraman's response:
"Gutted, slashed - the guy is not in the union anymore. Besides, brothers don't
last long in situations like this." Isn't that the truth? </P>
<P>"Scream 2" is strictly by-the-numbers in terms of plot structure and story, but
it also tends to be unpredictable. There are the usual scares but some of them
are unexpected. Basically, it's a sequel about a sequel being made as we are
watching it - you can almost feel the giddiness in Gale's character as she
becomes aware that the events happening around her is good material for her
next book that will eventually be made into a movie sequel to "Stab." Get it?
"Scream 2" is part of the 90's postmodern movement where we are consistently
reminded we're watching a movie about a movie-within-a-movie.</P>
<P>Director Wes Craven still knows how to build suspense and thrills better than
any other horror director: the opening pre-credit sequence with Jada Pinkett as
a moviegoer at the "Stab" screening is one of the most frightening and
compelling scenes I've ever seen, certainly topping the Barrymore opening from
the original. Screenwriter Kevin Williamson, who also helmed the original, has
crafted a smarter, more character-oriented script with sharper dialogue and a
keener eye for detail. "Scream 2" also succeeds in pinpointing the problem of
teenagers and twentysomethings obsessed with violence in American movies today,
especially horror movies, and how many of them will blame the entertainment
industry for their own blood lust. </P>
<P>"Scream 2" was easily one of the most entertaining movies of 1997, and it is
Wes Craven's best work since the original "Nightmare on Elm Street." Neve
Campbell and the whole cast bring a sense of humanity and pathos that
definitely makes this a cut above the rest. As a character rightly suggests at
the end of the film: "It's going to be one hell of a movie." </P>
