<P>   If you know good music you could probably listen to a piece
you've never heard before--a symphony by Brahms or Beethoven,
an opera by Mozart or Puccini--and figure out who composed it. 
The same is true of film directors but to a limited extent.  Who
would have guessed that Brad Anderson, who scared the wits out
of his audience with "Session 9," could turn out a fluffy comedy
like "Happy Accidents"?  On the other hand, we do see that in
both cases an active imagination is at work.  In "Session 9,"
Anderson tells a horror story that breaks away from the standard
genre of devils-outside to take on the "Repulsion"-like terror of a
mind breaking down--the demons within.  With "Happy
Accidents," Anderson takes on a similarly atypical story, this one
about love rather than the abhorrence felt between men in
"Session 9," and asks the question: Can a woman love a man
enough to overlook  what she considers a sick mind?  </P>
<P>   Anderson's romantic tale hits us with a twist near its conclusion
that could knock out socks off were it not that "Happy Accidents"
dwells so interminably on a single concept that by the time we
learn the truth, we find it difficult to care.  When Ruby Weaver
(Marisa Tomei) runs into Sam Deed (Vincent D'Onofrio) on a park
bench in New York, she is so taken in by his gentle demeanor
that she overlooks the co-dependency situations with other men
that drove her to a therapist (Holland Taylor) and invites him to
share her flat in just a week's time.  After Sam invites Ruby to
listen to some music--bringing some records to her place rather
than taking her to a concert--they switch off the nostalgic stuff, put
on the contempo, and dance wildly all the way to her bed.  It is
there that she notices a bar code tattooed to his underarm, at
which point he explains that he's  a time traveler who has come
back from his existence in the 25th century--which prompts her to
give him his walking papers.  But when she discusses the
situation with her best friend Gretchen (Nadia Dajani) and later, in
the film's best scene, has a heart-to-heart with her mother Lillian
(Tovah Feldshuh) about savoring the passion because "it doesn't
last," she decides to go along for the ride.</P>
<P>   Though Marisa Tomei and Vincent D'Onofrio were both born in
Brooklyn (which should make them soul brother and sister as far
as I'm concerned), they are miscast.  D'Onofrio is forty-one years
old playing a role he should have been given just after his capacity
in "Full Metal Jacket," while Tomei, going on thirty-seven, is simply
past the time of girlie chats, of looking endless at pictures of the
"freaks" they had dumped, leaving their pictures in what they call
the ex-files.  Besides, Marisa Tomei is in her usual bimbo role, first
as a telephone operator who gets fired because she spends too
much time chatting with her 411 clients and promptly lands a job
teaching English to foreigners!  What sort of training did she get
in TEFL?  And how could she possibly keep up in some heavy
discussion of the laws of physics with art-gallery-loving friends who
are far too sophisticated for her--including Anthony Michael Hall in
the role of a famous actor who believes he is seeing some cool
improvs as Sam discusses his life in the 25th?</P>
<P>   Credit must be given nonetheless to director Anderson for a
good attempt at putting across a decidedly lower-budget sci-fi pic
than Gregory Hoblit's excellent time-travel saga "Frequency," but
quirkiness of plot and engagement of audience do not always go
hand in hand.   The dialogue is often incisive but the film could
easily lose fifteen minutes by dispensing with the repetitive
discussions of time travel and making the chemistry between two
middle-aged people more credible.                                          </P>
