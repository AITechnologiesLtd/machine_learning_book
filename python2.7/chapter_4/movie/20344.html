<PRE>THE ASTRONAUT'S WIFE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>Let me answer the question that is on the mind of every viewer who has
seen writer/director Rand Ravich's THE ASTRONAUT'S WIFE: Is the movie
really in slow motion as it appears?</P>
<P>No.  But, the zombie-like movements so carefully mastered by the story's
leads, Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron, make it seem that the
projectionist is running the movie at one-quarter speed.</P>
<P>When we meet the Armacosts, husband Spencer (Depp) is off to his office
in space.  He's a NASA astronaut who will lose a mysterious 2 minutes
while on a space walk.  The story, which essentially reveals almost
everything from the beginning, makes it obvious that aliens have visited
him during this communication blackout.</P>
<P>Spencer's wife, Jillian (Theron), wants some answers when he gets back
on earth, but she doesn't get them until months later.  At a busy,
company cocktail party in New York, where he has gone to accept a
lucrative executive position at an aircraft firm, Spencer finally agrees
to answer her constant queries about the infamous missing 2 minutes.  He
pulls her around a corner at the crowded enclave and begins having sex
with her as he provides an explanation of sorts.  Never does she
interrupt him and suggest that he tell her the answers first before
engaging in any sexual activity.  The scene itself somehow shifts in
mid-thrust to their bedroom.  The story is rife with many such illogical
and implausible happenings.</P>
<P>At least the party does provide an opportunity for some much needed
humor in a movie that, given the hackneyed quality of the material,
takes itself way too seriously.  "I used to be into AIDS," one emaciated
socialite tells Jillian.  "Now, I'm into hunger."</P>
<P>Shot in shadows with heavy tones of dark wood paneling and deep blues,
the film tries its best to look convincing.  The script certainly needs
all of the help it can get.  The film, which is as inert as outer space,
uses choral music full of over-the-top creepiness to supply most of the
fright factor.</P>
<P>Johnny Depp, in one of his lesser performances, still manages to be the
only even partially satisfying aspect to the movie.  Charlize Theron,
who was so good in a similar role last year in THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE,
talks in constant whispers as if she thinks she's having a religious
experience.</P>
<P>Jillian's hairdo?  Short like Mia Farrow's.  You know, like in
ROSEMARY'S BABY.  Cute, huh?</P>
<P>Okay, now finish the story yourself.  You don't need any more clues.</P>
<P>THE ASTRONAUT'S WIFE runs 1:49.  It is rated R for violence, language
and a strong scene of sexuality and would be acceptable for teenagers.</P>
