<P>PRICE OF GLORY - A Film Review by Jerry Saravia</P>
<PRE>PRICE OF GLORY</PRE>
<P>In the last five years, independent films have become more and more like 
Hollywood films in terms of genre, formulas, and general sappiness. Consider 
"The Tao of Steve," a low-budget film that resembles a corny Hollywood 
romance with a neat and tidy happy ending. "Price of Glory" falls under the 
same category: a boxing film full of cliches and a wishy-washy ending. The 
big difference is that "Price of Glory" aims to be something more, and heads 
for a wrongheaded climax with no payoff. </P>
<P>Jimmy Smits is Arturo Ortega, a former boxer who wants his children to become 
boxers. He wants them to have the life he never had. In the opening 
black-and-white flashback, we see a young Arturo beaten to a bloody pulp in 
what was ultimately a fixed fight. Since then, he lost the passion and nerve 
to continue boxing - he knew when to quit. </P>
<P>The problem is that Arturo doesn't know when to quit when it comes to his 
sons. Nevertheless, as the boys grow older, Sonny (Jon Seda), Jimmy (Clifton 
Collins, Jr.) and Johnny (Ernesto Hernandez) become the "Fighting Ortegas" 
yet it is Johnny, the youngest and meanest of the bunch, who becomes the 
likely prizefighter to become heavyweight champion. This means a lot to his 
father, and naturally to the Latino community in their hometown of New 
Mexico. But when opportunity knocks, family squabbles take over. Arturo is 
their trainer and their promoter, but an outside fight promoter, Nick Everson 
(Ron Perlman) wants to represent the promising Johnny and the other boys. 
Will Arturo let go, or will the sons follow the glitz from Nick's promotion? </P>
<P>"Price of Glory" has one major flaw and that is the character of Arturo - he 
is a man trying to live his dream through his sons. The sons know this but it 
takes Arturo a long time to come to this realization. And when tragedy comes 
between them, Arturo continues to be naive and hurtful. Even his wife, Rita 
(Maria del Mar) can't reason with him. Arturo's personality is enough to 
cause the audience to lose their patience. </P>
<P>"Price of Glory" benefits from the fine, truthful performance by Jimmy Smits 
but the screenplay avoids dealing with some larger issues. Since Arturo 
refuses to sell out his sons, which is really for their own benefit, and 
since he feels he can redeem himself through their success, then why does he 
feel he can still bond with them and make them forget his harmful emotions 
after the tragedy that takes place prior to the climax? In fact, it is no 
suprise that the climax is headed for a "Rocky" finish, but why deny Smits' 
the expected payoff scene where his character can learn the error of his 
ways? The drama and tension peter out to some heavy melodrama that would seem 
at home in any daytime soap opera than in a real film about real people. Even 
the villainous promoter, Nick, seems more sympathetic and understanding than 
Arturo.</P>
<P>"Price of Glory" has some wonderful flavor to it in its cinematography and 
scenery, and I liked the sporadic depiction of a Latino family trying to come 
to terms with their troubles. The boxing fights are also well-directed but 
they do lack the thrust of "Raging Bull," which set the standard for all 
boxing movies. Still, "Price of Glory" is the kind of film that tastes good 
on the surface yet leaves a bitter after taste once you consider how the 
ingredients were mixed. </P>
