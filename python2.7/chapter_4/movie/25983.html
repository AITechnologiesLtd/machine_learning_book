<PRE>                           THE WAY OF THE GUN
                    A film review by Christopher Null
                      Copyright 2000 filmcritic.com

<P>     In case you're utterly dense and stupid (and some of my hate mail
indicates that if you're reading this, you just might be), know that
with a title like The Way of the Gun you are getting yourself into a
very, very violent film.  I do not mean a couple of cap guns and a blood
pack under someone's shirt.  I mean more shots fired per foot of film
this side of a Rambo movie.  Bring your earplugs.</P>
<P>     This is not to say that violence can't be stylish or clever. 
Movies like Pulp Fiction have proven that a gun can be poetry.  Or it
can just be a gun.  Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie (best known
for writing The Usual Suspects; Gun is his directorial debut) has set
out to make a Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid for the millennium. 
>From its all-bad-guys cast (except for the girl) to the arch, black
comedy to a south of the border shootout, the homage is pretty sincere. 
Too bad it didn't quite work out.</P>
<P>     This crime thriller weaves the story of two thugs (Ryan Phillippe
and Benicio Del Toro) looking to make their big score.  Opportunity
arises in the waiting room of a sperm bank, when they learn of a very
pregnant surrogate mother (Juliette Lewis) who is being paid big money
to carry the child of a wealthy couple.  A kidnapping/ransom plot is
hatched, and complications ensue.  As it turns out, the man can pay such
a rate for his new son because he's dirty, and he sends the goons out en
masse in order to recover his property -- an unborn baby boy.</P>
<P>     Subplots and side roads abound, as the kidnappers find themselves a
bit out of their depth, resulting in a chase across Mexico, filled with
double-crosses and trickery galore.  Notable among the players is James
Caan as the "bagman" on the case -- the guy sent in to try and trick the
kidnappers into an even worse situation by offering solace.  Caan's
aging gangster is intentionally hilarious, sporting a Members Only
jacket and followed by a crew of aging henchmen that look straight out
of Palm Beach.</P>
<P>     The drama plays out at a suspiciously familiar-looking Mexican
brothel, with Lewis giving birth (her doctor -- I'm positive -- played
the jerky redheaded kid from Dead Poets Society) amid a hailstorm of
gunfire.  When it's over, it's amazing the place is left standing. 
Suffice it to say that few members of the cast are.</P>
<P>     Ultimately, The Way of the Gun is flecked with many laughs despite
its gruesome storyline.  As a cinematic experience, it's also
competently made, but something just doesn't sit right, and the picture
never reaches the echelon of the Reservoir Dogs of the violence-in-film
world.  This is largely because though Gun is clever, it's considerably
over-plotted and, as a direct result, interminably slow as detail after
detail is explained at length.</P>
<P>     But perhaps its biggest failing is that Gun gives us absolutely no
one to root for.  And it takes some doing to make a pregnant woman
unsympathetic.</P>
