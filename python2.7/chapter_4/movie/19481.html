<P>"I'll give you a dollar if you grab her booty!"</P>
<P>Starring Omar Epps, Sean Nelson, Taye Diggs, Trent Cameron, Richard T
Jones, Duane Finley. Rated R.</P>
<P>Films featuring adults reminiscing about times and friends they had when
they were kids have the potential to be tremendously effective. When
done right, they can be sad (Stand By Me had me in tears), funny,
nostalgic and just plain terrific. But as is the case with every genre,
there is no foolproof formula for making a good movie. With its constant
ineptitude, The Wood demonstrates that for every winner there's a dud.</P>
<P>We are introduced to the people with whom we are about to spend two
hours when they actually start talking to us. Omar Epps (The Mod Squad)
kicks off the movie by speaking directly into the camera, introducing
himself as "Big Mike". You see, Roland, one of Mike's best friends, is
about to be married -- only he's nowhere to be found. His other friend,
Slim, is terribly nervous (in fact, when he sees Mike speaking he blurts
out "Who the hell you talking to?"). It's not long before the story goes
into flashback, as the three buddies fondly recall their adolescent
years in "The Wood" ("not what you think," says Mike, although what you
may be thinking soon becomes a recurring motif; what is being referred
to is the town of Inglewood, California, a suburb of LA).</P>
<P>The Wood tracks the girl-chasing adventures of the three teenagers. From
a booty-grabbing contest that gets Mike into trouble with a nasty big
brother to an American Pie-ish who-shall-get-nookie-first contest, this
movie seems concerned solely with the boys' relationships with the
fairer gender.</P>
<P>I wish this film had explored more than one aspect of the potentially
interesting lives of these characters. A movie solely about "gettin'
some" can be immensely entertaining when it is said film's sole focus,
like in American Pie. Here, however, we get a movie that is supposedly
the story of the friendships of these three people when they were young.
Thus, it is disheartening to see it refuse to do anything interesting
with that scenario. The extent of The Wood's versatility is the
characters' choice of breath mints.</P>
<P>The first hour of this veritable sap-o-rama entertains, with some funny
gags and affecting moments. But then The Wood falls apart. At nearly two
hours its at least half an hour too long and it begins to repeat itself.
The same jokes turn up more times than we find it fitting to laugh at
them. Before we know it, what we've wound up with is yet another retread
of the Horny Teenager Movie even though its first hour lead us to
believe otherwise.</P>
<P>The characters are exclusively one-dimensional as are, for the most part
the performances from the six leads. The standout, is Omar Epps as adult
Mike, whose performance is sincere. Sean Nelson who plays young Mike has
an annoying fish-out-of-water quality: the story calls for him to make
us believe that his character has just moved from North Carolina to
California and doesn't know anyone or anything there. He goes one
better: he makes us think his character just moved from Venus.</P>
<P>The Wood is a movie with a one-track mind, which is unfortunate because
had it tried to develop other aspects of its characters it may have been
a fascinating character study. As it is, it's a mildly diverting, seldom
entertaining piece of alleged nostalgia that doesn't seem very nostalgic
at all.
