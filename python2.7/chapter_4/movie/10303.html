<P>When making a statement regarding the animated cinema, one can't be broad
in scope -- you have to narrow things down to a point where you really know
what you're talking about. Disney has revolutionized this area, with their
sometimes brilliant, sometimes mediocre animated films -- from Snow White
And The Seven Dwarves, to Hercules. But outside cel animation, there are
different masters -- the up-and-comer Henry Selick, of The Nightmare Before
Christmas and James And The Giant Peach. Even more notable, is the
excellent Nick park, creator and animator of Wallace And Grommit. Of all
these films, considering A Grand Day Out, and The Wrong Trowsers, the best
is A Close Shave -- by turns, deliciously exciting and wonderfully funny,
the animated masterpiece is a near perfect example of story-telling. How
much of a story can you cram into thirty brief minutes? This is just about
how much. With humor, both physical and sophisticated, and action, truly
exciting, the storyline pulls together in unexpected moments -- the
expressions we see on the faces of our heros (Wallace and Gromit) are far
more then we have came to expect. This is an excellent example of how well
good stop-motion can communicate to the audience. </P>

<P>"Movies are really a kind of dream state, or like taking dope. And the
shock of walking out of the theatre into broad daylight can be terrifying.
I watch movies all the time, and I am also very bad at waking up."
