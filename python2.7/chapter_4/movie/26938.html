<PRE>"The 6th Day" -- Twice the Ah-nold, but Only Half the
Fun
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>Imagine the following fascinating but profoundly
challenging ethical issues surrounding the topic of
cloning.</P>
<P>* World population explodes to such an extent that
food levels decrease to dangerously low levels. By
cloning fish and livestock, however, new food supplies
could be easily reintroduced into the food system to
eradicate any future shortages.  </P>
<P>* Your precious 10-year old daughter would be
heartbroken if she found out that her adorable pet
pooch has gone to Heaven.  To save her from the pain
and yourself from the excruciating task of explaining
to her what happened, you visit a business at the
local mall that specializes in cloning pets.  Within
two hours, Rover is 'resurrected'.  Your daughter
never knows the difference and life goes on.</P>
<P>* Deion Sanders, a talented football player acquired
by our Washington Redskins for an ungodly sum of money
to help ensure a championship season, suffers what
seems to be a career-ending injury. With that, the
hopes of winning the Super Bowl and the $50+ million
investment die.  Miraculously, Deion appears in the
next game looking as if nothing had happened.  The
pursuit of the coveted Super Bowl championship
continues and all seems normal.  </P>
<P>These are all compelling quandaries regarding the
future of Man and would certainly make for an
interesting sci-fi yarn.  However, despite the fact
that "The 6th Day" is layered with philosophical
undertones, the moral issues are much more compelling
than the film itself.</P>
<P>Starring a somewhat subdued Arnold Schwarzenegger,
this moderately entertaining science fiction/action
adventure film takes place in the "not too distant
future and sooner than we think."  Science and
technology has advanced to a point that the lines
between reality and artificiality are becoming
increasingly blurred.  Virtual girlfriends are
becoming as acceptable as the real thing. SimPals
(lifelike but eerily ugly dolls) are the hottest
holiday toy.  Meanwhile, there is heated debate that
rages over the legitimacy of human cloning.  Although
it is currently banned under law, a greedy
businessman, Michael Drucker (Tony Goldwyn), wants to
have the laws overturned.</P>
<P>Our hero, Adam (Schwarzenegger) gets caught up in a
bizarre and dangerous situation when he learns that
he's been cloned.  Wait…perhaps he's the clone and the
other guy is real.  It's another absorbing question. 
But no matter how interesting this film could've been,
the basic DNA of any Schwarzenegger film sacrifices
ingenuity for eye candy and a bit of action.  You can
expect several gunfights that make it look like a sort
of revved up commercial for Laser Tag.  There are some
cool sci-fi effects that will surely please the
men-who-love-cool-gadgets population.  And, there are
some pretty good performances.  Of note is Michael
Rappaport as one of Drucker's henchman, and there is a
tender turn from Wanda Cannon who plays the dying wife
of a key scientist within Drucker's firm.</P>
<P>But where "The 6th Day" goes awry is that it is
basically a toned down version of the typical
Schwarzenegger movie.  It doesn't have over-the-top
action sequences, the violence level is somewhat
subdued (although there is one graphic scene), and our
hero even displays an uneasy gushiness.  It's even
rated PG-13.  Perhaps seeing so many of his other
cartoonish but action-packed films have caused me to
consider this project a step in the wrong direction. 
While it tries to be more than just a mindless action
flick, the movie doesn't really have anything to get
excited about.  You'll walk out of the theatre
thinking that you saw a preview for Playstation 3.</P>
