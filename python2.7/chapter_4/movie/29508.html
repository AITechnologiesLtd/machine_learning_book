<P>Susan Granger's review of "THE GLASS HOUSE" (Columbia Pictures)</P>
<P>Actor Stellan Skarsgard single-handedly makes this sinister thriller more
effective than you might expect. When the parents of 16 year-old  Ruby Baker
(Leelee Sobieski) and her 11 year-old  brother Rhett (Trevor Morgan) are killed
in a car crash, they're placed in the custody of their parents' best friends and
former neighbors, Erin and Terry Glass (Diane Lane, Stellan Skarsgard). The
Glasses'  lavish, contemporary, gated glass house in Malibu offers a
sun-drenched California distraction, complete with trendy clothes,
state-of-the-art TV and video games. Squabbling Ruby and Rhett must share a
bedroom, temporarily, but the estate lawyer (Bruce Dern) assures them that
there's $4 million to insure their comfortable future. If they have a future,
that is, since Ruby begins to suspect that the Glasses may not be the ideal
guardians they seem to be. Erin, a doctor specializing in pain-management, is a
moody drug addict, while Terry is heavily in debt to loan sharks. Working from
Wesley Strick's hackneyed script, television director Daniel Sackheim ("Law and
Order," "The X-Files") propels the creepy melodrama, unnecessarily underscoring
the malevolence, aided by production designer Jon Gary Steele and
cinematographer Alar Kivilo, who drenches the screen with cold, watery blue
imagery. There's one almost-surreal, amusing moment when a group of Valley teens
emerge from a showing of "Prom Nightmare," and one notes, "That actress was no
Meryl Streep." "Who's Meryl Streep?" another asks. "She's like Katie Holmes to
our parents" is the reply. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The Glass
House" is a scary 6 - at least until the final transparent moments when it
shatters into a formulaic teenage horror flick.</P>
