<PRE>MUSIC OF THE HEART
A film Review by Athan Bezaitis
Copyright Athan Bezaitis 1999</PRE>
<P>The creator of A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET and SCREAM is toying with our
conscience again, only this time his weaponry isn't Freddy's claws or a
murderous prank caller.  Director Wes Craven's latest endeavor, MUSIC OF
THE HEART, switches gears to more virtuous human emotions in order to
tell us the story of one woman's triumph and the revival of a
downtrodden urban community.  Oddly enough, this film is just as
powerful as any of Craven's horror films and can evoke strong emotion
and sentiment, if you let it.</P>
<P>MUSIC OF THE HEART begins like any of the other `triumphant teacher'
dramas we've all seen.  STAND AND DELIVER and DANGEROUS MINDS both
crossed my mind as I sat through the first hour of Roberta Guaspari's
(Meryl Streep) struggle to teach a handful of young urban kids how to
play the violin.  This part of the story is hackneyed and clichéd, and
you've seen it before--if not in a previous movie than in some boring
after-school special.  But where other `triumphant teacher' dramas fail
because they concentrate too much on the saintliness of the teacher,
this movie succeeds in its captivation of Roberta Guaspari's character
flaws, and her struggle as a single mother attempting to raise her two
children in East Harlem.  When the film expands beyond the existence of
just `Roberta the teacher' and into the rest of her life, the film
becomes genuinely enjoyable.</P>
<P>About an hour and a half into MUSIC OF THE HEART, it zaps you ten years
into the future.  All of a sudden, you're in the nineties.  Roberta's
kids are older and more mature and although she's still single, she is
now an accomplished teacher.  However, her fate is not yet sealed as she
faces a career-threatening crisis that jeopardizes all she has worked
for.</P>
<P>This is where the film really takes off and the strong supporting cast
kicks in.  School principal Janet Williams (Angela Bassett-- HOW STELLA
GOT HER GROOVE BACK) and Jane Leeves ( `Frasier') both are superb in
support of Streep, who puts on yet another credible chameleon act.  Her
teenage children, Nick (Charlie Hofheimer) and Lexi (Kieran Culkin) are
both uplifting and extremely affable as they help their mother cope.
Even Gloria Estefan, in her acting debut, rounds out an excellent
supporting cast.  With all its cylinders clicking, the film takes a kind
of MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS path toward a conclusion filled with grandeur.</P>
<P>I don't consider myself overly emotional, but this movie is really
touching:  I haven't felt tears swelling up like that since CURLY SUE
with James Belushi.  I don't know if it was just my mood or the violin
music coupled with some powerful surges of sentimentality.  Decide for
yourself, and let me know.</P>
