<P>MY LIFE SO FAR (PG).  
(Miramax/Village Roadshow)
Director: Hugh Hudson
Stars: Colin Firth, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Rosemary Harris,
Malcolm McDowell, Irene Jacob, Tcheky Karyo, Robbie Norman, Kelly
MacDonald, Freddie Jones, Brendan Gleeson
Running time: 96 minutes.</P>
<P>Set in Scotland in the period between world wars, this rather
forgettable and unspectacular tale from Hugh Hudson (Chariots Of Fire,
etc) seems inspired by the Merchant Ivory school of film making.  This
visually beautiful but dramatically dull family saga explores a life
of privilege and wealth that was soon to be changed forever by
sweeping events.  The film's sedate pace and gentle rhythm suggests
the calm before the storm.  Based on the memoirs of Sir Denis Forman,
one of the founding fathers of the British television industry, My
Life So Far really offers little of great insight or interest to
casual audiences.</P>
<P>The film is set in Kiloran, the sprawling ancestral estate in
the Scottish highlands that is home to the fictional Pettigrew family.
Much of the film unfolds from the perspective of its ten year old
narrator Fraser Pettigrew (a rather grating and unappealing
performance from newcomer Robbie Norman), who comes of age during this
period of great change.</P>
<P>His father is Edward Pettigrew (Colin Firth, from Shakespeare
In Love, etc), an eccentric inventor who also farms moss on the
property, and seems to lack any real sense of ambition.  His wife
Moira (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, wasted in a fairly thankless role)
raises the numerous children, and suffers her husband's foibles
quietly.  But the arrival of Edward's millionaire brother Morris
(Malcolm McDowell, in probably his most sympathetic and substantial
role for quite some time) and his much younger and beautiful French
fiancee Heloise (Irene Jacob) for a brief visit brings a new dynamic
and air of sexual tension to the house that eventually disrupts the
family harmony.  Fraser and Heloise develop a strong bond that upsets
Edward, who is secretly attracted to his future sister in law.
Another visitor to the property is Gabriel Chenoux (Tcheky Karyo), the
enigmatic French aviator, who also leaves his mark on the family.
Fraser's slow awakening to the broader world beyond the confines of
Kiloran provides the film with some of its humour and charm.</P>
<P>Beautifully shot around Argyle and the Scottish highlands, the
film certainly looks superb, and the period detail is spot on.
However, Hudson's direction is uninspired and unhurried, and lacks
flair.  The film moves at a sedate pace that may test the patience of
many.  This is little more than a routine television movie on a lavish
budget.</P>
<P>On the evidence of this glossy but rather uninspiring film,
it's been a rather unspectacular life so far.  It certainly doesn't
whet the appetite for further instalments in the rather ordinary life
and times of Fraser Pettigrew!</P>
