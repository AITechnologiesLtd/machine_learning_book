<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>The year's second scariest film (after The Blair Witch Project) comes
from an unlikely source – writer/director David Koepp (The Trigger
Effect), who adapted the script from Richard Matheson's book (he also
wrote the novel What Dreams May Come).  Echoes will unfortunately open
after the similar but big-budgeted Bruce Willis flick The Sixth Sense
(due 8/6), but is still one of the creepiest films to be released since
Se7en.</P>
<P>Echoes opens with a little boy named Jake staring into the camera while
sitting in the tub.  He's answering questions that nobody appears to be
asking.  Is it an imaginary friend?  His parents seem to think so, but
Jake is really conversing with the spirit of a missing local girl named
Samantha Kozak.</P>
<P>Kevin Bacon (Wild Things) plays Tom Witzky, Jake's blue-collar working
father that has spent his entire life within a six-block radius of one
Chicago neighborhood.  He's disappointed with his boring life and
dead-end job.  His hippie sister-in-law Lisa (Illeana Douglas, Grace of
my Heart) talks a disbelieving Tom into undergoing hypnosis at a party.
He only sees a second or two of seemingly unrelated and fragmented
flashes, but when Tom comes to, he's been told that he was out for
several minutes.  To make matters worse, Lisa also plants a suggestion
into Tom's subconscious.  Not the kind that will make him cluck like a
chicken when somebody says the word `omelette,' but rather an innocent
appeal to be a bit more open-minded.</P>
<P>Before he went under, Tom crowed `C'mon – what's the worst that could
happen?'  Well, the worst does happen - amateur hypnotist Lisa
accidentally opened the door to his mind instead of making him
open-minded.  What does that mean?  Just that Tom slowly is able to see
and hear the same things as his son.  He catches more glimpses of the
spooky images that he saw while under hypnosis, and even catches a
glimpse or two of Samantha.  He also drinks a lot of orange juice and
begins to unwind mentally, putting a strain on his wife Maggie (Kathryn
Erbe, Dream with the Fishes).</P>
<P>When Lisa puts Tom under a second time in an attempt to close the
Pandora's box, he instead gets a one-word message from beyond: `Dig.'
What follows is very reminiscent of the slow descent into madness
previously seen in The Amityville Horror and The Shining.  In fact, you
can't help but think of Amityville's George Lutz (James Brolin) digging
up his basement while watching Bacon do the same thing.  And maybe
you'll be reminded of Bacon's Flatliners.  The story is derivative of
both films (and many others), but it's still original enough to raise
the hair on your arms on several occasions.</P>
<P>The story is fairly predictable (I called it about 40 minutes into the
film) but seems oddly short.  It's almost like a lot was carved out of
the final cut – Tom's rock band, Jake's baby monitor, Maggie's pregnancy
and a cop named Neil all seemed destined to have more screen time, but
were curiously skipped over after careful introductions.  But the film
is worth the price of admission just for Bacon and the young son's eerie
performances.  (1:35 – R for brief nudity, sexual content, adult
language and violence)</P>
