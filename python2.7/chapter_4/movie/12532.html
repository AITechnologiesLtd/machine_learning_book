<PRE>THE BUTCHER BOY (1998)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Neil Jordan
Writers: Neil Jordan and Patrick McCabe (based on the novel by McCabe)
Starring: Eamonn Owens, Stephen Rea, Fiona Shaw, Alan Boyle, Aisling
O'Sullivan, Andrew Fullerton, Sinéad O'Connor, Patrick McCabe, Ian Hart,
Ardal O'Hanlon, Milo O'Shea</P>
<P>Neil Jordan's "The Butcher Boy" is the tale of a young lad from a small
town in Ireland during the early 60s who has a very traumatic childhood
where every single thing that probably could go wrong goes wrong, and he
begins to take it out on society.  For Jordan, it's a return to some of his
more Irish roots after hitting big with "The Crying Game" and experimenting
with Hollywood with "Interview with the Vampire" and "Michael Collins"; for
us, it means a return or introduction to elements from other films that
have come before and have actually fared better.</P>
<P>First off, "The Butcher Boy" is a very odd, eccentric film, and watching
it, I could see how in about 20 years, this film will have a avid cult
following.  It has a wildness to it that will be appreciated by those who
enjoy surreal and interesting ways in which films are presented, and will
probably even be dubbed "brilliant" by a couple groups.  However, "The
Butcher Boy" is not the amazing film it really sets itself out to be,
probably because it's: a) unoriginal, and b) doesn't really dive into its
topic the way it should.</P>
<P>The film's focus is on childhood and the ways that what we experience when
we are children has a mighty affect on us for the rest of our lives.  The
focus is on Francie Brady (Eamonn Owens, in a stunning debut), who's the
bottom of the lot: he's a bully, he comes from a bad home, and he's just
generally a jerk.  His dad (Stephen Rea, who's been in most of Jordan's
flicks) is "the town's best drinker," and his mom (Aisling O'Sullivan) is
about four flews over the cuckoo's nest.  In fact, one day, Francie comes
home to find her trying to tie a noose and hang herself.</P>
<P>But Francie is able to escape this trauma with his one friend, Joe (Alan
Boyle), who plays games and steals stuff with him.  We see that the only
way he can escape is through this, and also by watching old action shows on
TV like "The Lone Ranger" and reading comic books.  He also picks on a
young peer of his, Philip Nugent (Andrew Fullerton), and steals his comic
books and whatnot because, hey, the boy is a wimp.  I mean, the boy takes
piano lessons, for christ's sake!</P>
<P>It's Philip's mother, referred to as simply "Mrs. Nugent" (Fiona Shaw) who
becomes the object of Francie's hatred.  To him, she's everything that's
wrong with the world: she's a snob, speaks with a delicate British accent,
and seems to delight in torturing him by making him feel bad because of who
he is.  She's the scapegoat for all his problems, and it's only appropriate
because the 60s, as well as the 40s and 50s, were when scapgoating was like
a worldwide fad.</P>
<P>The entire film is told from the perspective of Francie as a middle-aged
man (played by Stephen Rea again, but with some red hair dye so you don't
get confused), who tells it with a nostalgic distancing that allows him to
stay above it, but still get involved with the storyline because he still
understands what he was thinking at the time.  We get the feeling that
though he's still an adult and it's been rougly 30 to 40 years since the
events occurred that he's still the same kind of person, just a little
wiser and with a couple more wrinkles.  But he's still Francie Brady.</P>
<P>Jordan takes these ideas and actually runs with it for awhile, and then
begins to meander around a lot.  Francie's behavior winds him in a juvenile
delinquint home, where he's preyed on by a hilariously perverted pedophile
priest (played by Durand-Durand himself, Milo O'Shea), and then is zipped
around in the storyline before he's brought back for la grande finale,
which brings it right back to its focus.  Episodic storylines work if the
episodes build on one another, but this one actually becomes redundant for
an hour chunk of itself, and then for the last half hour, builds on this.</P>
<P>It would also help if this film was even more original.  The film blatantly
lifts from several films, most notably two great cult favorites: Truffaut's
"The 400 Blows" and Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange."  From "The 400 Blows,"
it lifts the whole idea of a bully-like boy protagonist, as well as the
somewhat incompetent parents (I'll say).  From "A Clockwork Orange"...well,
the narration which brings the audience in and makes it more of a story
instead of distancing us from it, and, well, the basic premise of getting
back at a society which is pretty inadequate which dealing with criminals
and basically everyone else.  Not only this, but the film uses these like
they were original concepts, trying to be as great as them.  Sorry, Neil:
ain't gonna happen.</P>
<P>But now for some positive remarks: Jordan is very competent in creating the
feel of the 60s in Ireland, and pretty much everywhere else.  We see lots
of talk about nuclear holocaust, and it actually seems like the world could
end any minute.  And he is able to create a very great feeling of being a
kid in this time period, including some really nifty surreal montages using
kid's point of view, and even digging deep into and exposing the way that
kids are taught about violence and hatred through some of the material they
are presented, like comic books.</P>
<P>The film is also interestingly directed by Jordan, who does lots more with
the weird camera movements and whatnot that make this technically great. 
He also gets a lot out of the music by Eliot Goldenthal, who does some cool
work along with placing some interesting tunes on the soundtrack, including
a couple Kurt Weill songs, and even some groovy arrangements of classics
and standards (I loved the modern-day version of Tchaikovsky's "March" from
his Nutcracker Suite).  Even if it's not as great as the films it rips off,
it's gonna be a cult classic nevertheless.</P>
<P>This is where the film works, and since this is what it was aiming for, we
get an understanding that Jordan was not just trying to tell a cool story
so that he can make a cult film, but is able to show that what occurs in
childhood and adolescence really does affect who you are as an adult.  In
some parts of the film, we see Francie talking to a vision of the Madonna
(played by none other than Sinéad O'Connor, avec hair), who comforts him in
some of his more traumatic episodes of his life.  And then when he's older
and out, we see him talking to her again.  There are parts of childhood we
never really get over, and it doesn't matter if we're the town bully or
not; we'll always be the same person.  And by the end we understand not
only this, but why kids often become these so-called "horrible" people.</P>
