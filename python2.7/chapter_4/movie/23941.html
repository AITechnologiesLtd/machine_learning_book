<P>Ingrid, Renee, Jackie, Stephanie, Susan. Those names I can rattle off my mind
like shards of lightning, and they are at the top five of my list of breakups
in my life. And so I could identify with Rob Gordon's unique ability to not
only remember the names of past loves and the extent of their relationships,
but to also know which pop/rock and roll songs were playing at the time,
exclusively on vinyl. Music is an identifiable factor for me too, and for my
sweet miseries of the past, it includes Huey Lewis and the News performing
"Small World" in 1988 and "Shakedown" by Bob Seger from the summer of 1987. For
Rob, it includes a different era of Fleetwood Mac and Paper Lace, and that is
at the heart of Stephen Frears's delicately oddball romantic comedy "High
Fidelity," which is more oddball comedy than romantic but it delivers all three
in nearly equal doses and that is part of its charm.</P>
<P>Based on Nick Hornsby's 1995 cult novel of the same name, John Cusack plays the
record-loving Rob who owns a small Bohemian-like record shop in Chicago called
Championship Vinyl, which specializes in selling records wrapped in plastic
(vinyl has not lost its touch since it is still sold in record shops,
especially in New York City or Princeton, N.J.). Rob speaks directly to the
camera, ruminating on his past top five breakups, most recently Laura (Iben
Hjehle), while giving us the pop history of each breakup - the song that played
and where it played as a reminder of that misery. Or as Rob puts it, "I don't
remember if I was miserable when I listened to pop music or if listening to pop
music made me miserable." </P>
<P>Laura has left Rob's pad but he loves her too much to just let go. She lives
with a sexual hippie (hilariously portrayed by Tim Robbins) who is a
martial-arts master. We get more than a few scenes of Rob dripping wet like a
madman in the rain while calling Laura from outside her new home - this almost
seems like an extension of the classic "Say Anything" by director Cameron Crowe
that also starred Cusack. All Rob has left in his life, minus Laura, is his
record store and two employees, the geeky, apologetic Dick (Todd Luiso) and the
musically encyclopedic, irascible Barry (Jack Black) who is ticked off by
anyone who does not share his music tastes. I love the moment when they discuss
"Evil Dead 2" and its "great soundtrack" or Barry's recommendation to use "You
Can't Always Get What You Want" at Laura's father's funeral:</P>
<P>Dick: 'That is an immediate disqualification on the grounds of it being used in
"The Big Chill".'</P>
<PRE>Barry: 'Oh, God. You are right.'</PRE>
<P>Besides his listless life without Laura, Rob is a part-time DJ and briefly beds
a sexy singer (Lisa Bonet) who shares Rob's lovelorn disappointments and sings
Peter Frampton songs. And we get glimpses of Rob's obsession over his past
loves, shown in brief flashbacks. He is so obsessed that he arranges to meet
all five and figure out why he has failed them. Most memorable of these
ex-girlfriends include Lili Taylor as an unhappy yet sometimes cheerful woman
(only Lili can credibly play such a part) and Catherine Zeta-Jones as a rich,
wild woman who is confused by Rob's need to explain why she left him. </P>
<P>"High Fidelity" is familiar turf, a lot of is reminiscent of some of the best
parts of "Singles," one of my favorite comedies of the 90's. Still, thanks to
director Stephen Frears's offbeat direction and Scott Rosenberg and Cusack's
writing, the laughs come in with terrific precision, mainly due to Cusack's
dead-on, quirky line readings. The cast is richly entertaining to watch,
including the histrionic, energetic Jack Black, and a marvelous Joan Cusack as
Rob's friend who is shocked to discover how Rob treated Laura thanks to Laura.
I also enjoyed the presence of Hjejle - for once in these comedies, a real
human being of the opposite sex shows how deeply hurt she is by a man's
transgressions. Though the film loses momentum in the last half hour building
to the predictable final act with Laura, "High Fidelity" has oodles of charm
and a consistently jerky funny bone. It's uneven, like Cusack, but you expected
that. </P>
