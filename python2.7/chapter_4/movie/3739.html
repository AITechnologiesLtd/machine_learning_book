<PRE>                              BATMAN FOREVER
                       A film review by Lewis Butler
                        Copyright 1995 Lewis Butler</PRE>
<P>     The most remarkable difference in BATMAN RETURNS is the lack of a
good director.  Schumacher creates a movie that is choppy, hard to
follow, and has some of the worst directed action sequences in recent
memory.  The movie has some neat gizmos and gadgets, too bad we don't
get to see how they work, or even exactly what the are doing.  There is
one scene in particular where Batman manages to escape certain death by
doing something involving his feet and fire.  I have no idea what
happened in this segment, and neither did anyone else in the audience.</P>
<P>     The casting is good.  Carey delivers a wonderfully wacky psycho
portrayal of The Riddler, and Tommy Lee Jones is passable as Two-Face,
although his character doesn't get the development that Carey's does.</P>
<P>     Nicole Kidman is as bad as Kim Bassinger was in the first movie.
A completely unbelievable female character, again.  Too bad, I like
Nicole Kidman (ever since FLIRTING).  I will say, all traces of her
accent are gone; she has a perfect American accent throughout the
film.  But she's not believable in any way, and there is no depth to
her character.</P>
<P>     Val Kilmer was not particularly impressive either.  Somehow his
Bruce Wayne lacked that edge of craziness that was the one thing
Michael Keaton did well.  Kilmer's Wayne is stoic and dull. There's
none of the interesting little quirks that were evident as far back as
TOP SECRET! and REAL GENIUS.</P>
<P>     Chris O'Donnell manages to make Robin an actually interesting
character.  Not that he's given a lot of opportunities.  He does manage
to make Robin a believable character Something the comic books never
did.  I did like the inclusion of "Nightwing" among the possible
nicknames, though.  Nice touch.</P>
<P>     The sets are quite poor, often involving shots that scream
"MATTE!" in large capitals.  There are also some strange instances
where one feels as if the director is setting off beacons and showing
off how he too can be clever.  All the uneasy mood of Tim Burton is
exchanged for cheap flash and poor editting.</P>
<P>     If one rates BATMAN at a +3, BATMAN RETURNS was a nice +2.  BATMAN
FOREVER drops the stakes considerably, weighing in at a mere +0.0 on
the -4 to +4 scale (where 0 indicates an average movie)</P>
