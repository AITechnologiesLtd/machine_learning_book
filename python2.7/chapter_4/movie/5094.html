<PRE>                                     SEVEN
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        I used to avoid Brad Pitt movies like the plague, like famine, 
like a Bob Dole presidency... but after watching INTERVIEW WITH 
THE VAMPIRE and 12 MONKEYS, I realized the guy actually can act. 
Imagine my surprise that his success isn't solely based on being a 
greasy-haired pretty boy. Part of that is also because, with the 
exception of the dreadful horror flick STUDENT BODIES, he manages 
to somehow pick compelling and original movies to star in, something 
you can't always say about the other what-a-cute-butt stars like Mel 
Gibson (BIRD ON A WIRE) and Tom Cruise (DAYS OF THUNDER).</P>
<P>        SEVEN is a stylish thriller you should be able to follow even 
if you haven't seen ONE through SIX. There's a serial killer on the 
loose committing brutal murders for each one of the seven deadly sins 
(kind of like that "Batman" story I wrote four years ago in which the 
Joker commits crimes based on holidays... I wonder if there's a 
possibility for a lawsuit.) and detectives Pitt and Morgan Freeman 
have to discover the freak's identity and stop him.</P>
<P>        Here comes the formula we've seen a hundred times before. 
Rookie cop Pitt has to earn the respect of about-to-retire cop Freeman, 
who keeps going on and on about how he's only got a week left until 
retirement. Uh-huh. We know what his final decision will be because 
no movie cop has ever been able to bring himself to leave the force. 
We're left to believe that, in the movie realm, police officers die and 
decompose at the station.</P>
<P>        There's also a plotline with Pitt's wife coming to Freeman for 
advice on how to cope with the coming lifetime of stress and heartache 
in a miserable, crime-ridden city for them and their unborn children. 
This is a movie with an incredibly grim view of humanity, potentially 
depressing for people who don't like to hear about naked, obese men 
being force-fed to death (because I know that hits a little too close to 
home for me). The murders in the movie are definitely creative to the 
point of disgust, I'll give them that. It's hard to work people up about 
sins like sloth and gluttony, but SEVEN manages to make it 
interesting.</P>
