<PRE>                            MANSFIELD PARK
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A liberated young writer is brought
          to her uncle's mansion to be little more than a
          servant.  As she grows she is involved in romantic
          adventures as she seeks happiness and the right
          husband for her.  Patricia Rozema adapted and
          directed the novel by Jane Austen mixing in details
          from Austen's own life and adding themes that
          Austen somehow missed.  This is an entertaining but
          decidedly fluffy tale of romance.  Rating: 6 (0 to
          10), +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Let me start by identifying my attitudes on Jane Austen so the
reader knows if to continue or not.  I consider these stories an
excellent view into the minds of a certain class of woman in the early
19th century.  Austen novels are at the high-end of what we have come
to call the romance novel.  Jane Austen heroines, if one may call them
heroines, seem to aspire mostly only to achieve comfort.  This they
accomplish via the institution of marriage.  The choice of whom they
will marry is usually obvious to every reader, if not to the heroine
herself, from the early pages of the novel.  Her heroines are people
with no ambition to be known fifty years after their death or indeed
fifty miles from home during their lives.  Usually the reader has more
interest and certainly better knowledge of the events of their times
than they appear to have themselves.  They are living during the
Napoleaonic Wars, a fascinating period, but to all appearances are
ignorant of the fact.  This does not say that great literature cannot
be written about minor and narrowly absorbed people, but the greatness
of some other authors is more readily apparent.</P>
<P>     Fanny Price in the new MANSFIELD PARK is a little more aware of
the world than most Austen heroines, though not by the intention of
Jane Austen herself.  Patricia Rozema who adapted the navel for the
screen and then directed it has revised and corrected Austen for
current audiences.  To spice up Fanny's personality she now is a
budding writer.  The amusing melodramatic stories that Fanny writes are
stories that really did exist.  They are stories that Jane Austen
herself wrote as a young teen.  Fanny's knowledge of the world, her
social conscience, and most of the anti-slavery subplot is all Rozema's
revision.  There is some but very little mention of slavery in the
Austen novel, though by a coincidence that perhaps Austen herself was
not aware of, Mansfield Park was named after Lord Mansfield who in 1772
ruled that any slave brought to England was legally free.  The film's
implications of open sex and even lesbianism are pulled from Rozema's
fertile imagination.  Still it is hard to be too harsh on a film with
this much historic charm.  It may not be what Austen intended, but it
is still enjoyable.</P>
<P>     Fanny Price (Frances O'Connor) was taken from her poor parents in
Portsmouth at age ten and brought to Mansfield Park to be raised by the
Bertram family who live in a huge mansion called Mansfield Park.  The
masters of Mansfield Park are her aunt and uncle and she is to have a
status somewhere between a family member and a servant.  She will get
to know the Bertram children but everyone will be constantly aware that
she is not their equal.  She is treated at best insensitively by the
family except for young Edmund Bertram who from the very start shows
her compassion.</P>
<P>     As the years pass Fanny is accepted at arm's length by the four
Bertram children Tom, Edmund, Maria, and Julia.  Into their lives come
brother and sister Henry and Mary Crawford (Alessandro Nivola, Embeth
Davidtz), neighbors.  Henry and Mary are close and share a tendency to
flirt, an attraction to the opposite sex, a sense of style, an interest
in the Bertrams, and both are attracted to women.  Fanny who secretly
loves Edmund sees him attracted to Mary Crawford and Maria and Julia
attracted to Henry.  But Henry is more interested in Fanny.  This is
Jane Austen so we know from the start that things will sort themselves
out and that the heroine will get the right man and in doing so get to
live on the big estate. "It could have ended differently, I suppose,
but it didn't," Fanny muses at the end of the film.  But then she does
not know Jane Austen as well as we do.</P>
<P>     Frances O'Connor's Fanny Price is perky and free-spirited, but
just a little too attractive for the Jane Eyre-like heroine.  Sir
Thomas Bertram is played by none other than Harold Pinter.  Alessandro
Nivola does bring enough charm to the role of Henry that the audience
is almost rooting for him.  Michael Coulter's camera captures a usually
bright and sunny view of early 19th century England created by
production designer Christopher Hobbs and art director Andrew Munro.
The historical detail is questionable with details like lipstick and
eye makeup on a ten-year-old child, but it is nice to look at.</P>
<P>     This is perhaps not Jane Austen's MANSFIELD PARK, but Jane Austen
would have probably recognized most of it and would have been amused by
the rest.  I rate it a 6 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +1 on the -4 to +4
scale.</P>
