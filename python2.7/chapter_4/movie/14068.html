<P>   As a dark comedy that takes place in a small Montana
town--the sort of site an urban traveler avoids even if he
needs gas--"Clay Pigeons" recalls the crazy antics of "Fargo." 
Yet it's a work of considerable originality that has been made,
surprisingly, by a first-time director and by a screenwriter who
is making a debut in his field as well.  Breaking with the
typical SmallTownUSA picture, helmer David Dobkin and
scripter Matt Healy do not concern themselves a heck of a lot
with exposition.  Scant minutes into its opening, a guy is
pointing a gun at his best friend, whom he accuses of having
a torrid affair with his wife, and pulls the trigger.  But the
fellow on the ground is not the author of the bedroom intrigue
but the shooter himself.</P>
<P>   The the stick-in-your-throat laughs and unanticipated
incidents continue from there without interlude in "Clay
Pigeons," an innovative program which manages to lampoon
the American pueblo while taking an easygoing, Pulp Fiction
attitude toward a captivating murderer.</P>
<P>   Like "Fargo," this movie commutes easily among the genres
of satire, comedy, and melodrama, giving the scoundrel the
best lines and keenest temperament in the story.  Only one of
the residents of Mercer, Montana (actually filmed in various
hamlets of the beautiful state of Utah) is a bumpkin, the
others acting as prototypes for stable scout, slatternly slut,
laid-back law-officer, magnetic malefactor and caustic cop. 
The acting is so aw-shucks convincing, backed up by such a
bounteous sound-track of 70s country-style music that "Clay
Pigeons" delights throughout.  But be advised: if you're the
kind who shocks easily when you see callous killings treated
with a down-home posture, you'll consider this sort of film the
sort that's causing the decline and fall of American civilization.</P>
<P>   The story opens on a shooting match as best friends Earl
(Fregory Sporleder) and Clay (Joaquin Phoenix) test their
skills at shattering beer bottles.  Earl suddenly turns on Clay,
accusing him of having an affair with his wife.  In the
conventional picture, Earl would either blow his friend away or
lose his chance in some hand-to-hand combat.  But just about
everything in this yarn turns out the converse of what you
expect.  Clay returns to the newly widowed but conspicuously
unconcerned Amanda (Georgina Cates), is disgusted by her
lack of distress, and after shifting his libidinous intent to
another Montana enchantress is plunged into an ambivalent
fellowship with the engaging visitor, Lester Long (Vince
Vaughn), whose swollen cowboy Panama matches his
towering personality.  </P>
<P>   If Mercer, Montana is ethnically homogeneous and surely
no New York, NY, it is nonetheless filled with characters as
varied as those in a large metropolis.  The gorgeous, British-
born Georgina Cates turns in a muscular baby-doll
performance as a hard, chain-smoking trollop who sets her
sights on everyone except the guy she married, and Joaquin
Phoenix is again reliable, as in "Return to Paradise" as
bewildered guy who gets more than he envisioned--
considering his career as a jockey in a dilapidated gas station. 
He finds himself confronted with the sardonically deadpanned
Janeane Garofalo as federal agent Shelby who, unamused at
an attempt to pick her up in the village bar assures the lusty
cowboy that the seat next to her is taken: "for the first person
not wearing denim."</P>
<P>   Best of all is Vince Vaughn, who worked together with Mr.
Phoenix in a more forthright role in "Return to Paradise," and
who shows his depth in a wholly distinct performance.  His
Lester Long is clap-on-your back clamorous, his congeniality
covering a penchant for slashing young women--his contempt
excited by the ease with which his victims flock to his all-
American allure.  Changing easily and frequently from hale-
fellow to inflamed slayer, he attacks his unsuspecting prey
with a calmness that belies each operation.  Also cleverly
drawn is Sheriff Mooney (Scott Wilson), an unexcitable peace
officer who can fool people into thinking he'd rather build
model boats--while prying essential information from suspects
and witnesses.</P>
<P>   Being the sort of movie in which everything turns out the
contrary of what you'd expect, it is also one of the few stories
featuring a cigarette that saves lives instead of ruining them. 
Director Dobkin skillfully retains a light touch, giving the
twenty-five songs their chance to be heard.</P>
