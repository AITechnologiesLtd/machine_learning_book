<PRE>"The Legend of Rita" </PRE>
<P>"Legend" - in Stasi-speak (East German Secret Police lingo), a term used to 
connote a false identity. </P>
<P>In the 70's, militant idealism swept through the youth movement in West 
Germany. For Rita Vogt (Bibiana Beglau), it is the most exciting time of 
her life. She believes in a just world, built on violence if necessary, and 
is in love with charismatic leader, Andi (Harald Schott), of their little 
group of revolutionaries. The gang robs a bank as their first strike 
against capitalism and the die is cast for the rest of their lives. </P>
<P>When Rita passes through East Berlin in transit from Beirut, a hidden 
pistol is found in her bag and she comes under the scrutiny of East German 
security in the person of Stasi officer Edwin Hull (Martin Wuttke). The 
secret policeman lets her pass through to the west, where Rita gets 
involved in a botched jailbreak for Andi. A guard is killed and the gang 
must go underground to avoid arrest. The movement remains stagnant for 
years and everyone grows complacent in their Parisian exile until, one day, 
Rita is stopped for a routine traffic violation. She tries to run for it 
and becomes a cop killer in the process. Her only out is asylum in East 
Germany and her first legend - factory worker Susanne Schmidt - is born. </P>
<P>Rita/Susanne must now live the life she has idolized for all these years 
and is content with her new world where there is no wealth, but no poverty, 
either. These feelings aren't shared by her friend, Tatjana (Nadja Uhl), 
who just wants out of the East, even if it is with the help of a stolen 
bottle of vodka. Their deepening relationship is abruptly ended when the 
news reports Andi's death in a skirmish with the police. Rita's old wanted 
poster is broadcast on TV and she must seek a new legend. </P>
<P>Hull arranges a new identity for Rita as Sabine Walter, a child-care 
worker, and she enters the happiest time of her life. She meets a young 
physicist, Jochen (Alexander Beyer), and, for the first time, falls in love 
with something other than the cause. Rita's dreams, that summer, of living 
happily ever after in the worker's paradise will soon be dashed when, in 
1989, the Berlin Wall came down and Rita loses her protectorate. </P>
<P>Volker Schlondorff brings us a fictional look into a period of our history 
that is relatively virgin territory. Only the recent "Invisible Circus" 
comes to mind and that runs a pale second to "The Legend of Rita." The 
helmer, with screenwriter Wolfgang Kohlhasse, examines the life of one 
young German radical, Rita, and her flight from the law as she seeks asylum 
in East Germany. He succeeds in developing a character study of a woman 
whose rash youthful decisions marks her for life. Newcomer Beglau gives a 
commanding performance as Rita and matures nicely as she struggles to 
maintain her idealism after her fateful decision to pull the trigger on the 
gun and murder a policeman, a rash act that changed her life forever. </P>
<P>Although the focus of the entire film is on Rita, the supporting cast does 
a good job in fleshing out those around her. Martin Wuttke is outstanding 
as Stasi copper, Hull, and conveys the controlling nature of the 
totalitarian Communist government whose policy is "we're for the people, 
that's why we're against them." Nadja Uhl is believable as the desperate 
Tatjana who doesn't see her "paradise" through same idealistic glasses as 
Rita. </P>
<P>Schlondorff, with a veteran team behind the camera, gives the film a sound 
period feel of the 70's and 80's. The flick has a docu quality in its 
realism, provided by cinematographer Andreas Hofer. Costumer Anne-Gret 
Oehme and make-up artists Jeanette-Nicole Latzelsberger and Karin Stephan 
do a seamless job of clothing and aging the characters over a decade plus 
time, oftentimes as disguises to hide the fugitives' identities. Cheesy 
East German rock music works wonderfully in putting you where the filmmaker 
wants you to be. Rita's struggles with right versus wrong, good versus 
evil, makes for an interesting study of a world little known. </P>
<PRE>I give "The Legend of Rita" a B. </PRE>
