<PRE>Tasty `American Pie'
by Homer Yen
(1999)</PRE>
<P>I recall the trials and tribulations of my high school years.  It was a
period that would mercilessly force me to exit boyhood and thrust me
into the unwelcome arms of adulthood.  But of all the experiences that
I collected throughout those tender years, I can honestly say that the
toughest and the scariest thing that I had to cope with was my raging
hormones and my crazed curiosity about girls and sex.  Yes, more
scarier than my seventh grade English teacher and even scarier than the
bullies that constantly hounded me, trying to deal with my personal
wonderment about sex was like trying to fight an invisible monster. 
For all teenagers, it's almost like a rite of passage.  And what we did
was sometimes downright nasty, sometimes funny, and sometimes shocking.
 And all of that is terrifically and shamelessly brought to light in
what might be the funniest movie this summer.</P>
<P>`American Pie' is a comedy about four sexually frustrated seniors that
enter into a pact to lose their virginity by the end of the school
year.  Just how great are their hormones raging?  One of them notes,
after watching Disney's The Little Mermaid, that Ariel is soooo hot. 
The four schoolmates are Kevin, Oz, Finch and Jim.  Kevin is the only
one with a steady girlfriend, but doesn't want to have sex until the
time is just right.  But what is the perfect time?  There is just no
way to know, and that frightens him.  Oz is the big jock who decides
that the way to score with the girls is to listen to them and to be
more sensitive.  He joins up with a jazz choir and discovers that
getting in touch with his feminine side has some tremendous advantages.
 Finch is the phobic hermit who doesn't stand a chance with any girl. 
So, he pays someone $200 to start spreading rumors about his prowess. 
Suddenly, girls are lining up to go out with him.  But among these
friends, it is Jim that is the most curious and the most fearful.  When
he has a chance to romp with a pretty exchange student, his
inexperience comes shining through.  He has much to learn, and will do
anything to seek out this kind of knowledge.  This may include watching
scrambled porn channels or experimenting with Mom's apple pie in a
scene that is completely shocking, raunchy, yet unbelievably funny.</P>
<P>The one thing that I want to say about this film is that it well
deserves its `R' rating.  There is stuff in here that is completely
gross in the same manner that `There's Something about Mary' was
gloriously ribald.  In fact, at first this film received a sinful NC-17
rating before a couple of more cuts finally brought it down to a
teen-accessible rating.  But I guess after seeing the no-holds-barred
coarseness of South Park, this seems tame by comparison.  Teens and
anyone who can still remember their acne years are the ones that will
laugh hardest.  But unlike many teen sex comedies, there is a genuine
intelligence at work here.  These are four normal boys who have a
natural curiosity about sex.  Their plans of action are thoughtful and
they think about the consequences.  They know what they want, yet
temper it with responsibility.  But almost always, it's impossible to
know how to fight the invisible monster, and it's these episodes that
make `American Pie' such a carnal delight to watch.</P>
