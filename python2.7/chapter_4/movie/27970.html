<PRE>Saving Private Zaitev
Enemy at the Gates</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony </PRE>
<P>1942, A trainload of young Russian soldiers (Jude Law among them) spills 
out into the Volga River to Stalingrad; German bullets ripping through 
the chests of the brave ones, Russian bullets piercing the backs of the 
cowards. Law somehow survives, his amazing marksmanship witnessed by an 
enthusiastic Russian writer (Joe Fiennes) who delights in fighting the 
Germans with propaganda instead of gunpowder. Fiennes makes a war hero 
out of Law, "We need examples, yes, but to follow, not fear." A fine set 
up to a film where the war itself becomes the backdrop to an indecisive 
focus between a love story and a one-on-one of dueling snipers. </P>
<P>After an opening sequence reminiscent of "Saving Private Ryan," the 
newspaper black and whites of Jude Law with his rifle and those award 
winning eyes piercing through the print and the depression lifts the 
hopes of those fighting to save Stalingrad. They'll make your heart 
swell, too. </P>
<P>Law and Fiennes become fast friends, and then of course, in walks a 
woman soldier, Rachel Weisz -- well educated, but tough. Law is 
embarrassed by his lack of proper literacy. Later, unfortunately too 
much later, jealousy and desire provide the ammunition for a climactic 
ending. But with the timing off, the supply of ammo loses its potency 
while the passion misfires, missing targets it should have hit. </P>
<P>A brash barracks love scene graces the picture, but ought to have 
occurred twenty or so minutes prior in order to set up believable 
intentions - namely the picture cutting exercise. A few other improbable 
progressions snag what essentially is a very nice piece of work. </P>
<P>That opening sequence not only compels, but takes firm hold of your 
heart, only to slowly lose its grasp with a third act nearly as chaotic 
as war. Strong direction (aside from story telling difficulties), solid 
acting (especially from Law - he's awesome), tremendous set design and 
cinematography. The positives create a stronghold; though taking 
casualties, this fort of a film still stands. </P>
<P>Perhaps a better title: "Snipers in Love" </P>
