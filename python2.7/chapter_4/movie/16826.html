<PRE>Rushmore</PRE>
<P>I like the character of Max Fischer.  He loves his school, and is
totally dedicated to nearly every single extracurricular activity that
could ever be dreamed up.  So he joins them all, as his grades suffer.
He campaigns to save Latin from being dropped from the curriculum.  He
stages elaborate school plays with explosives and miniature subway cars.</P>
<P>Then something extraordinary happens.  Max falls in love.  Of course,
Ms. Cross, the First Grade teacher, is too old for him and has married
once before, but nevermind.  Max will win her heart by campaigning to
have an aquarium built in her honor.</P>
<P>So he enlists the aid of Herman Blume, a local steel tycoon.  Blume,
played by Bill Murray, is depressed, unhappy with his family, and nearly
has all the vigors of his youth nearly taken from him.  Then he falls in
love with the same teacher.</P>
<P>Thus begins the setup of one of the year+s most engaging comedies.  A
multi-generational love triangle between an underaged, overly active,
under-achiever and a successful schmuck with the wind taken out from
him.  Other than the minor references between _The Graduate_, _Good Will
Hunting_ and _Revenge of the Nerds_, this is totally original
entertainment.</P>
<P>Bill Murray has not only made a comeback, but has delivered the goods
with compounded interest.  It+s as if he+s read too many negative
reviews over his last several projects, and had it gone to his head.
The result is the most engaging, mature character in the entirity of
Bill Murray+s career.  While a few individuals are having a hard time
retaining their personas as they age (Eddie Murphy, Dan Ackroyd) while
others become more obnoxious (Woody Allen), Murray takes this original
character to the next logical step.  He interiorizes every bit of rage
we know is there, converting it to a dispirited demeanor, who cannot
believe the complications that ensued.  And yet he marvels and admires
Fischer+s ingenuity.</P>
<P>Max Fischer is played by newcomer Jason Schwartzman, the son of Talia
Shire, and cousin to Nicolas Cage and Francis Ford Copolla.  It is hard
to retain go neck and neck with Murray, with a complicated character
that+s on screen most of the time, but he succeeds.  He has the
endearing task of appearing smarter than he actually is ("Do they speak
Latin in Latin America?").  We root for him, but we root that he will
grow, not necessarily that he gets the girl in the end.</P>
<P>_Rushmore_ more than anything else, is a triumph of its creators Wes
Anderson and Owen Wilson.  It moves quickly, with a major plot secret
occuring within the first half-hour.  And when it+s all over, you will
be surprised how easy it was to take it all in, and find it hard to
forget a few precious moments.</P>
