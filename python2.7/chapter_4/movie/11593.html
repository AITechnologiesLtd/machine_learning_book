<PRE>Sgt. Bilko
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1996 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>* (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Steve Martin is one of the funniest men alive. If you can take that as a true
statement, then your disappointment at this film will equal mine. Martin can
be hilarious, creating some of the best laugh-out-loud experiences that have
ever taken place in movie theaters. You won't find any of them here.</P>
<P>The old television series that this is based on has its moments of humor and
wit. Bilko (and the name isn't an accident) is the head of an army motor pool
group, but his passion is his schemes. Every episode involves the sergeant and
his men in one or another hair-brained plan to get rich quick while outwitting
the officers of the base. "McHale's Navy"'s granddaddy.</P>
<P>That's the idea behind this movie too, but the difference is that, as
far-fetched and usually goofy as the television series was, it was funny.
There is not one laugh in the film. The re-make retains the goofiness, but not
the entertainment.</P>
<P>Everything is just too clean. It was obviously made on a Hollywood back lot
and looks every bit like it. It all looks brand new, even the old beat-up
stuff. Martin is remarkably small in what should have been a bigger than life
role. In the original, Phil Silvers played the huckster with a heart of gold
and more than a touch of sleaziness. Martin's Bilko is a pale imitation.</P>
<P>The only semi-bright spot is Phil Hartman as Bilko's arch-enemy. It's not
saying much, considering Martin's lackluster character, but Hartman leaves him
in the dust.</P>
