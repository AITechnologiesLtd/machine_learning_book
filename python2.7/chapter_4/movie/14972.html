LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Little Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini), around 4 years old, is locked up in a
Nazi concentration camp, but he doesn't mind. It's a fun place to be,
what with the contests and all. If he and his father, Guido (Roberto
Benigni), can amass enough points for proper behavior, they can win the
grand prize -- their very own armored tank.</P>
<P>Welcome to the wild and wacky world of writer, director and actor
Roberto Benigni as he takes a comic's eye view of the Holocaust in LIFE
IS BEAUTIFUL (LA VITA E BELLA).</P>
<P>(This is the second time in two days that I've screened motion pictures
with a Holocaust theme. Yesterday's screening had Stephen King using it
as the subject for a horror picture in APT PUPIL. And today's LIFE IS
BEAUTIFUL takes a humorous view of the same topic. Personally, I much
prefer the serious treatment it got in THE LONG WAY HOME that I saw a
couple of weeks ago.)</P>
<P>Regardless of how it sounds, Roberto Benigni, one of Italy's favorite
funnymen, treats the biggest tragedy of this century with respect. The
film, thank goodness, moves away from its slapstick first hour to a
poignant second that is its salvation.</P>
<P>Starting just before the outbreak of the Second World War, the movie
shows Fascist Italy in its most handsome light. The sets are sumptuous,
the gowns are elegant and the cinematography stunning. The jokes,
however, are such old-fashioned slapstick that they are almost never
funny. Eggs accidentally breaking on unsuspecting heads and dresses
inadvertently ripped by clumsy feet are such old sight gags that it is
hard for them to even generate smiles, much less laughs.</P>
<P>The good-spirited film tries hard, perhaps too hard, to charm its
audience. It works so hard at being cute that it forgets to be funny.</P>
<P>Eventually the zany style of the first part gives way to the serious
second part when Guido, his wife Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), and their son
Giosue are send to a Nazi concentration camp. It is there that Guido
hides his son and invents the prize cover-up to mask the hopelessness of
their situation. Even in the camp, Guido still hams it up to keep up his
son's spirits.</P>
<P>The movie's relentlessly happy music will put you in such a pleasant
mood that the scenes of the "shower" changing rooms may seem almost
harmless. And the Nazis appear a lot nicer than they usually do. Rather
than burning Jewish shops, they paint one of their horses a bright lime
green and put the words "Achtung Jewish Horse" on it.</P>
<P>Fans of the Roberto Benigni brand of physical humor will undoubtedly
love LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL. Others may want more.</P>
<P>LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL runs 2:02. The film is in Italian with English
subtitles. It is rated PG-13 for holocaust-related thematic elements and
would be fine for kids around 12 and up.</P>
