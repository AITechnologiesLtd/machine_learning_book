<PRE>                              FATHER'S DAY
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon</PRE>
<P>Cast: Robin Williams, Billy Crystal, Charlie Hofheimer, Bruce Greenwood,
Nastassja Kinski, Julia Louis-Dreyfus Director: Ivan Reitman Screenplay:
Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, based on the film LES COMPERES by
Francis Veber</P>
<P>I like presents. There is nothing quite like the feel of wrapping paper
ripping beneath your finger tips, and hearing the edges tear at the same
time. So I was pleasantly surprised by this particular 'Father's Day'
offering. Expecting to find some recycled, thoughtless gift beneath the
pretence of some pretty wrapping paper with the names 'Williams and
Crystal together for the first time' written all over it; instead I
found a decent, amusing, thoughtful pairing.</P>
<P>In this package of unusual goods, we have contained 'three fathers with
a teenage baby', and in the card a single question from the mother
(Natasha Kinski). Who is this baby's father?</P>
<P>Our options are the manic depressive, effervescent one minute, tearful
the next, failed playwright (Williams). Who is compassionate, but lacks
any direction in life. Then there is the smart talking, head butting,
sensible, no nonsense lawyer (Crystal). Who wants to have kids, but has
great reservations because of the heavy responsibility of child bearing.
Lastly, we have the usual regular, round the mill, responsible 'I can't
understand my son', 'how do I break through to him', 'struggling to
reach out' father (Greenwood). Who wants the best for his son, but
doesn't quite know how to express his feelings of love for his son.</P>
<P>Now if I had a choice, I would probably choose the best qualities of all
three fathers - fun but not frivolous, sensible but not stern, reliable
but not restrictive. In truth it takes all three of these very different
fathers to reach out to this very confused, lost prodigal son, who has
been waylaid by the wayward temptations of this world. Namely, drugs,
alcohol and untrue friends. This movie brings a positive message to all
fathers who have difficult teenage children, the reminder given is never
give up on them no matter how lost they have become.</P>
<P>Ivan Reitman has done a good job in controlling the talents that are
Williams and Crystal. My greatest preconceived fear before watching this
movie, was that these comic talents would be trying to out funny, or out
perform the other; but instead I have found a good rapport and mutual
respect develop between these two actors, who have fairly distributed
the humour between them. Was there electrifying chemistry? Probably not,
but friendship, self control, and a good understanding of timing under
the umbrella of sensitive direction is all that is required to make this
movie work.</P>
