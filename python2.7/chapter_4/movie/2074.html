<PRE>                                ROAD SCHOLAR
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1993 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  Poet and humorist Andrei Codrescu
     drives a big new used Cadillac across the United States and
     shows us slices of American life as it is rarely seen.  While
     the film is not original, Codrescu's outsider's view is never
     dull.  Rating: +1 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     Andrei Codrescu is a Romanian-born Jew, a fact that explains many
aspects of his personality.  His acerbic sense of humor is a survival trait
when one lives in a background radiation of anti-Semitism from both the
neighbors and the government.  It also trains one to expect the worst and
hope for the best from institutions and the bureaucracy running the country.
At the same time, having come to the United States and finding conditions
better, he clearly likes this country and has an affection, if somewhat
bewildered, for Americans.  And he sees America as an outsider.  Because of
these different perspectives, he has become a commentator on National Public
Radio's "All Things Considered."  In ROAD SCHOLAR Codrescu brings these
perspectives to bear on various aspects of American life seen during a trip
across the country.</P>
<P>     ROAD SCHOLAR is not so much a film as a news magazine in cinematic
form.  It is supposedly inspired by the book ON THE ROAD by Jack Kerouac,
but it is closer in form to a stringing together of segments of "Charles
Kurault on the Road" or "Jean Shepherd's America."  It is also comparable to
Michael Palin's short television series "Around the World in Eighty Days"
and "Pole to Pole."  Codrescu drives from Manhattan to San Francisco
commenting on the passing parade.  He visits Ellis Island and comments on
the immigrant experience.  He also visits a Romanian restaurant, where his
compatriots make up for years of extreme poverty in the old country by
eating pornographically large cuts of meat.  He is served a steak so long he
has to fold over the end so that it does not drag on the table.  Detroit and
its hard times remind him of Romania.  In Chicago (if I remember correctly)
he visits a sausage factory and discovers a new sensuality in the packing of
sausages.  Also in Chicago he visits a McDonald's restaurant exactly as they
were when they were first open.  It is an educational exhibit for McDonald's
Hamburger U.  Codrescu mixes in a private war between the city council and a
junk artist who is half burying a car in her yard.</P>
<P>     Westward he continues to report on New Age crystal religion and a
healing shrine in New Mexico, and a drive-up window in a kitsch matrimonial
chapel in Las Vegas.  We visit Biosphere II, a sealed and totally self-
contained community to which inhabitants have exiled themselves for two
years.  This is supposed to prove people can live in similar confines in
space, though presumably in space there will not be a constant stream of
tourists to chat with at the windows.  Codrescu dubs Biosphere II a
"Disneyland for the Millenially Disabled."  According to Codrescu, America
seems to be discovered over and over again and never definitively.
Definitive discovery seems to have eluded Codrescu also, but at least his
commentaries and slices of life are never dull.  I rate this a +1 on the -4
to +4 scale.</P>
