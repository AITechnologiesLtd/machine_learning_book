<PRE>Cast: Treat Williams, Famke Janssen, Wes Studi, Kevin J. O'Connor, Djimon
Hounsou
Written and Directed by: Stephan Sommers
Running Time: 98 minutes
My Rating: * out of *****</PRE>
<P>Say, who thought combining "Speed 2:Cruise Control" and "Deep Star Six" was
a good idea? Why it's none other than writer-director Stephan Sommers,
that's who. He's the one to blame. He's the one to hurl your stones at.
Let's do that now shall we?</P>
<P>Treat Williams stars as a complete and total rip-off of Han Solo, a sea
pirate of sorts taking on missions for lots of cash (at one point he
actually says "I've got a bad feeling about this..." straight from the mouth
of Solo). Anyway, as the film opens we learn that he's been hired by the
most racially balanced group of terrorists you'll ever meet. I believe every
nationality aside from maybe the eskimos and people from Atlantis are
represented by this group. Their plan (from what I can understand, since
it's never discussed in any real detail) is to hijack a super-expensive
cruise ship on it's maiden voyage and sink it, so it's owner can collect the
insurance money. When they arrive onboard though, they have a surprise
waiting for them: slimy sea monsters!</P>
<P>First of all, I know previews are misleading sometimes, but this is the
first time I can ever remember a trailer just downright LYING to the
audience. In the trailers, when we see footage of the terrorists walking
around the ship, the omnious voice over tells us that "They answered a
distress call". THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY WE'RE DOING AT ALL!!! They actually had
to lie to the audience, because they must have realized that NO ONE WILL
CARE about seeing terrorists eaten one by one by sea monsters.</P>
<P>I can give the film credit in two areas. One being the stunts and visual
effects. Granted yes, the effects are computer graphics, but these are
pretty good ones. Most of the time they seem fairly realistic, for monsters
anyway. The other would be the film's ending. Now normally I loathe it when
films (especially horror films) end the way "Deep Rising" does, but in this
case I don't mind at all. These people deserve this ending.</P>
<P>"Deep Rising" is one of those movies that's so bad, it's almost a fun
experience. For example: At the heart of the plot we have the fact that the
ship's owner, who worked all his life to build the ship, wants the boat
destroyed because he just realized that the cost to keep the boat up and
running far exceeds the money he'll make. WHAT??? You devote your life to
something and yet don't bother working out such an important detail like
that? It's that level of stupidity that sinks "Deep Rising". That, and the
fact that you've seen this done, oh, a million times before, and a million
times better. [R]<HR>       The Jacksonville Film Journal -- Film Reviews by Chuck Dowling
