<PRE>                         SEVEN YEARS IN TIBET
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Only in the casting does SEVEN YEARS
          IN TIBET reveal itself as a very Western
          production. While the basic plot is very
          reminiscent of SHOGUN--each story is about a
          European who finds himself in an exotic and
          incomprehensible Asian land, eventually becoming
          the confidante of the ruler and a pawn in politics
          of momentous events--the setting is endlessly
          fascinating and director Jean-Jacques Annaud
          creates an entire world of the past caught in the
          wheels of changing time.  Rating: +2 (-4 to +4), 7
          (0 to 10)</PRE>
<P>     For millennia Tibet has been protected from intrusion by the
tallest guards in the world, the Himalayan Mountains.  There in the 7th
Century A.D. a culture all but unremembered first mixed with Chinese
culture. Until relatively recent history it was a culture that was so
isolated that it could go its own way and not be very much influenced
by any other culture in the world.  SEVEN YEARS IN TIBET tells the true
story of two Austrian climbers who happened to be in Tibet during its
years of fastest change, probably the only Europeans in the country at
the time.</P>
<P>     In Austria of 1939 lives Heinrich Harrer (played by Brad Pitt), a
world-renowned Olympic athlete, a member of the Nazi Party as a matter
of style, and a totally selfish boy-man.  He abandons his pregnant
wife--who is nearly due to give birth--over her objection and he goes
on a four-month climbing expedition in the Himalayas.  His first shock
is to discover that the expedition will be led by an awkward-looking
climber, Peter Aufschnaiter (David Thewlis).</P>
<P>     Harrer determines to undermine the ungainly man's authority and to
make himself the star of the expedition for the press.  His little
battle only gets him into trouble, first of the sides of the mountain
to be climbed, then when war breaks out in Europe the troop of climbers
are captured by the British in India and imprisoned in a POW camp.
Harrer fights a two-front war against the British imprisoning him and
against Aufschnaiter's authority.  Eventually Harrer and Aufschnaiter
escape from the camp, lead the British a chase through India, and flee
across the border into Tibet, a country officially closed to
foreigners.  The two lie their way into the capital city of Lhasa, a
beautiful mountainside city forbidden to any non-Tibetans.  After some
time there dealing with the bureaucracy of monks, Harrer is given
counsel with the Dalai Lama.  The great lama, still a young boy, finds
he likes the brash German.  Harrer becomes a friend, confidant, and
teacher to the boy.  The warm relationship between the two forms the
core of the film.  But their relationship is cut off when the country
is virtually stolen by invading Chinese Communist troops.</P>
<P>     There has been discussion on whether this was a good role for Brad
Pitt or not.  As the supercilious Heinrich who finds his humanity by
loving Tibet, Pitt was fairly believable.  I had the feeling that if I
had never seen him before I would not have thought twice about whether
this part was right for him.  In fact associations with previous films
were about the only thing that got in the way of the credibility of the
story. We have people like Victor Wong of THE JOY LUCK CLUB and BIG
TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA; Mako of CONAN THE BARBARIAN; and B. D. Wong,
whom we saw around the incubator in JURASSIC PARK and flitting around
in FATHER OF THE BRIDE.  It almost makes the film seem less Asian to
see these actors present.  David Thewlis has turned in one good
performance after another over the last four years since he stood out
in Mike Leigh's NAKED.  The Dalai Lama, played by three boys of varying
age, seems not so much a font of wisdom as an unending source of simple
straightforward curiosity, mostly about Western culture.  Jetsun Pema,
who plays the Dalai Lama's mother is in reality the Dalai Lama's
sister.  The film is directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud, who directed THE
NAME OF THE ROSE and THE BEAR.  As with the former, the setting is main
attraction of the film.</P>
<P>     One disappoint of the film is that the actual time covered in
Tibet is shortened by a long introductory section.  The screenplay by
Becky Johnston spends nearly half of the film just getting Harrer and
Aufschnaiter to Lhasa so that the story from that point forward seems
rushed.  Most of the adventure, however, is in the first hour, with
some harrowing scenes of mountain climbing.  The stories of escapes,
bound by the truth, seem almost cliched.  John Williams spices the
score with eerie Tibetan music.  I rate the film a +2 on the -4 to +4
scale.</P>
