<P>     With some "mockumentaries" (or "meta-documentaries", "pseudo-
documentaries", or whatever else you want to call them), it's best not 
to know beforehand that they're fakes.  The opposite is true of 
FORGOTTEN SILVER, an inventive and wily project made for New Zealand 
television by film makers Peter Jackson and Costa Botes.  With this 
film, if you don't know in advance that it isn't a real documentary, 
you'll almost certainly be bamboozled, and, in the process, miss some of 
the most subtle humor.  Taken at face value, FORGOTTEN SILVER is mildly 
entertaining, but, for those who recognize its true nature, it's nothing 
short of brilliant.</P>
<P>     Jeffrey Thomas, a man with an appropriately stentorian voice, does 
the narration for FORGOTTEN SILVER, which is presented as a 
straightforward documentary about an all-but-forgotten, turn-of-the-
century New Zealand film maker.  The contributions of this pioneer, 
named Colin McKenzie, were only recently recognized when his complete 
body of work was discovered.  His achievements included inventing the 
first mechanized camera, making the first full-length feature film with 
sound (in 1908 -- it was a failure because all of the actors spoke 
Chinese and he didn't have the foresight to invent subtitles), 
experimenting with color (in 1911 -- he was arrested on smut charges 
because a topless woman appeared in the test film), and introducing the 
closeup. </P>
<P>     To add to FORGOTTEN SILVER's verisimilitude, various expert talking 
heads are called upon to provide commentary.  Movie critic/historian 
Leonard Maltin gushes about the scope and quality of McKenzie's work.  
Miramax honcho Harvey Weinstein calls the unearthing of McKenzie's 
footage as "the greatest film discovery of the last fifty years" (then 
reveals that his company will distribute the previously-unseen epic 
SALOME with an hour edited out).  Actor Sam Neill comments about the 
importance of the McKenzie revelations to the New Zealand film industry.  
And directors Jackson and Botes mount an expedition to go deep into the 
New Zealand bush in search of the legendary lost site where McKenzie 
filmed SALOME.</P>
<P>     Using subtle special effects to re-create old, damaged footage, 
FORGOTTEN SILVER makes it easy to believe that we're seeing celluloid 
that has been stored in a shed for fifty years.  Not only are we treated 
to glimpses of McKenzie's pioneering efforts in cinema, but we're shown 
significant chunks of SALOME, a credible-looking silent presentation of 
the Biblical tale about the dancing girl who demanded John the Baptist's 
head.  While the film makers have crafted FORGOTTEN SILVER as a first-
rate parody, it's clear that both men possess a great deal of affection 
for and knowledge about the early history of cinema.  </P>
<P>     This is the sort of project one might expect from Peter Jackson, 
the inventive director whose previous outings have included the 
brilliant HEAVENLY CREATURES, the outrageously sick MEET THE FEEBLES, 
and the big-budget, offbeat comedy, THE FRIGHTENERS.  Along with co-
director Costa Botes, Jackson has put together one of the most 
interesting fake documentaries to come along since the genre was first 
popularized with THIS IS SPINAL TAP.  The more you love film and 
understand film history, the more you'll get out of this picture, but 
even the most oblivious movie-goers will find FORGOTTEN SILVER's mixture 
of fact and fiction enjoyable. </P>
<P>     When this movie was shown on New Zealand TV, it's impact was akin 
to that of Orson Welles' legendary Halloween radio broadcast of WAR OF 
THE WORLDS.  Suddenly, men and women across New Zealand thought they had 
a new national hero.  This simple fact shouldn't be taken as an 
indication of New Zealanders' gullibility, but of the effectiveness of 
FORGOTTEN SILVER.  Watch it carefully, and you'll be amused, amazed, and 
entertained.</P>
