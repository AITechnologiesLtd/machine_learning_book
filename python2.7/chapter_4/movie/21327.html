<P>Martin Scorsese's Bringing out the Dead, staring Nicholas Cage, is an 
edgy and unusual, yet solid, film. The movie, despite the absence of a 
material plot, has strong themes and character development that serve as 
a guide through a two-hour span. Those seeking deep and meaningful 
content similar to the director's Taxi Driver and Goodfellas or 
Cage's Leaving Las Vegas will not be disappointed. But those looking 
for a film that hops on the emergency room bandwagon in wake of hit 
television shows like ER, Chicago Hope and the new Third Watch may find 
this film to be too much of an intellectual challenge and are advised to 
seek their thrills in the popcorn hit Double Jeopardy.</P>
<P>"This film takes place in New York City in the early 90's" read the 
first words across the screen. Those 13 words and the ambulance that 
appears soon after create the film's most important character: the 
city. The audience can gather that the Big Apple is still a crime 
polluted mess in the pre-Giuliani era and that hospitals are an equally 
large issue. Just in case any doubt lingers, the film quickly shows us 
streets lined with prostitutes and hospital hallways lined with 
stretchers. From there emerges the hero, Frank Peirce (Nicholas Cage), 
an ambulance driver who has seen it all. For the next 58 hours (three 
nights, two days) Peirce will experience a variety of extreme measures, 
and the audience looks on in an almost voyeuristic fashion.</P>
<P>Peirce fringes on insanity throughout the film due to the numerous 
people who come into his ambulance pronounced insane and leave it 
pronounced dead. He gets them all, from the drug addicts to the suicidal 
to the "just plain nuts." This makes for an interesting juxtaposition: 
society's insane vs. society's insane workers. And then there are 
the corpses that he sees regularly, making him witness to more last 
moments than the average person's tolerance could possibly allow. Like 
all the other drivers, hebuilds an immunity, but, during these 58 hours, 
that shield is dropped.</P>
<P>Bringing out the Dead is sprinkled with the type of deranged and 
desperately dark humor that you only find amusing somewhere around 3:00 
AM when you are out of caffeine but forced to stay awake. Scorsese 
creates that setting so well that the jokes not only work, but you come 
to rely on their comic relief as a means of surviving the film. 
Highlights include the assorted calls that come through the ambulance 
radio (elderly woman abducted by her cat, etc..) and one scene where 
Peirce and eccentric fellow driver (Ving Rhames) find a supposedly dead 
victim, but stage a dramatically overdone revival for his stoned 
friends.</P>
<P>This summer, another legendary director gave us his look at New York 
City by following a character over a period of a few days. In Eyes Wide 
Shut, Stanley Kubrick portrayed an upper-class, secretive and perverse 
society that seemed to function completely on its own. Scorsese's look 
into paramedics is very similar. The men we meet run the night shift and 
find themselves isolated from society. They know each other, recognize 
their peers' ins and outs and are even accustomed to some of the same 
drug and alcohol calls from people who never learn their lesson and 
revolve in and out of the hospital doors.</P>
<P>Another summer film set in New York City showed the power of using 
contrasting music and scenes. Throughout Summer of Sam, as people would 
be brutally murdered on the streets, bright and uplifting music would 
dominate the moment. In Bringing out the Dead a whole panoply of tracks 
come into play. Stretchers, crying families and bloody scenes are 
accompanied by Van Morrison, R. E. M., The Who, UB40, Martha Reeves & 
The Vandellas and Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue (famous in part for 
another New York film, the Woody Allen classic Manhattan).</P>
<P>Bringing out the Dead is a thought-provoking and powerful film. Like the 
other cerebral movie at a theatre near you, American Beauty, this 
production can look for a prolonged box office run with no leading 
numbers but a positive buzz to give it stable positioning. Early on, 
Peirce tells us "I am good at my job." So is Martin Scorsese.</P>
