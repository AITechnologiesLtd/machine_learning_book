<P> The General (1998) 2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Brendan Gleeson and Jon
Voight. Directed by John Boorman</P>
<P> John Boorman's The General is an interesting, yet frustrating, look at the
life of Martin Cahill, a notorious Dublin criminal.</P>
<P> Shot almost documentary-style in black and white, Boorman's film is a
fascinating look at a man who held the basic institutions of society  the
law, the church  in contempt, and used his cunning and ferocity to live
life on his own savage terms.</P>
<P> Cahill, nicknamed "The General," was a legend in Ireland during his brutal
life, yet very few people could identify him. Cahill developed a habit of
continually obscuring his face, thus making it difficult for anyone to get
a clear picture of him.
And it seems, in a sense, Boorman was confronted with that same problem.
For while he shows the brazen and clever ways Cahill planned and committed
his various crimes, the director seems unable to get under his subject's
skin.</P>
<P> Boorman masterfully displays Cahill's rage and contempt, his bravado and
cleverness, but he falls short in showing what sparked it.</P>
<P> True, we get early scenes of a young Cahill in a boy's detention home,
where he fights off the sexual advances of a priest, and we learn he spent
most of his early life in prison.</P>
<P> Yet while this may be a simplistic approach to explaining his contempt for
authority and society, it does not answer the big question: How and where
did Cahill develop the wiliness to plan such perfect crimes as well as
outwit the police for nearly two decades?</P>
<P> As you watch The General, you get the sense that Boorman is valiantly
attempting to paint a complete picture of Cahill, yet his brush continually
misses strokes.</P>
<P> For example, for years Cahill lived in a menage a trois with his wife and
her sister, and had several children by both. No explanation for this odd
arrangement is offered.</P>
<P> As Cahill, Brendan Gleeson (best known to American audiences as Mel
Gibson's friend, Hamish, in the actor's Oscar-winning Braveheart) gives a
compelling performance.</P>
<P> He creates a man of contradictions  a loving husband and father at his
homes, but a brutal, conniving, merciless thug on the outside.</P>
<P> Gleeson's Cahill is a deadly charmer.</P>
<P> Jon Voight seems wasted as the police inspector who's obsessed with
bringing Cahill to justice. There is nothing particularly memorable about
his performance.</P>
<P> At a bit over two hours, The General seems to lapse during some sequences.
Also, the Irish accents are a bit hard to understand, and Cahill's habit of
covering his face and talking through his hands makes comprehending what he
is saying even more difficult at times.</P>
<P> Despite these obstacles, The General is an interesting look at a unusual
individual. It's a movie Boorman fans  used to his artistic visions in such
films as Excalibur and The Emerald Forest  may not find totally satisfying.
But the force of Cahill's personality draws you to the screen and rivets
your attention.</P>
