<P>     Stephen King makes his living by writing horror stories, so it's odd
that the most successful screen adaptations of his work are those outside
the boundaries of his usual genre.  STAND BY ME, MISERY, THE SHAWSHANK
REDEMPTION, and now DOLORES CLAIBORNE are all intelligent, well-fashioned
films that bear little resemblance to the gory schlock of SLEEPWALKERS
and PET SEMATARY.</P>
<P>     DOLORES CLAIBORNE begins as a dark and dreary murder mystery set in
the small town of Little Tall, Maine.  The skies above this village are
continually congested with clouds, the streets are slick with rain, and
the sea is gray and angry.  Yet this story, which starts out as an
investigation of a suspicious death, soon takes a grim, disturbing turn.
Memories crowd out the present as the narrative takes us back eighteen
years to expose the ugly roots of one family's dysfunction.</P>
<P>     Two deaths lie at the center of DOLORES CLAIBORNE--Vera Donovan's
(Judy Parfitt) in the present and Joe St. George's (David Strathairn) in
the past.  After Joe fell into a partially-concealed well during the
total solar eclipse of 1975, his wife Dolores (Kathy Bates) was
suspected, but never convicted, of murder.  The death was eventually
ruled as accidental, splotching the previously-perfect record of
Detective John Mackey (Christopher Plummer).  Now, nearly two decades
later, Dolores stands accused of killing her invalid employer and,
although the evidence is entirely circumstantial, Mackey is determined to
get a conviction.</P>
<P>     Dolores' daughter Selena (Ellen Muth at age 13; Jennifer Jason Leigh
at age 31), a reporter living in New York city, receives a fax of an
article in a Bangor newspaper detailing her mother's suspected
involvement in Vera's death.  Haunted by her muddled recollections of her
father's end and driven by an unshakable conviction that her mother is
guilty, she takes a brief leave-of-absence to go home.  Once there, she
is confronted not only by the unpleasantness of the present, but by the
ghosts of the past.</P>
<P>     Parts of DOLORES CLAIBORNE are delivered with an unshielded
emotional and psychological impact.  The script is not consistently at
this high level--there are times, most notably during the climactic
sequence--when unfortunate choices are made, but the overall result is
a film that illuminates certain "forbidden" shadows.  Generally,
mainstream movies avoid risky material like this honest exposition of the
issues underlying the fissure between Dolores and Selena.</P>
<P>     The main characters, mother and daughter, are well-written and
effectively portrayed.  Dolores is a sad, lonely survivor who has,
perhaps unjustly, endured a lifetime of misery.  Secrets can be an
oppressive burden, and Dolores has been worn down by them.  Selena, on
the other hand, has become an alcoholic and drug-abuser as the result of
what she has repressed.  Bates and Leigh, two accomplished and versatile
actors, are in peak form as they settle into the isolation of their
characters--two very different people whose individual pain is
intertwined.</P>
<P>     Less effort is vested in DOLORES CLAIBORNE's male principals.  In
the case of Joe, this is understandable.  He exists only in flashbacks
with our impressions filtered through Dolores' perspective.  She has no
reason to recall him kindly, and Strathairn's portrayal echoes this.
Plummer's John Mackey, on the other hand, is basically an unpleasant
person.  Supposedly, he's a very good detective, but we're never shown
anything other than obsession and bitterness.</P>
<P>     There's a lot to digest in DOLORES CLAIBORNE.  The subtle visual
effects, which mix digital animation and live-action, form an effective
framework for a story teeming with emotional turmoil.  With their unique
method of delineating shifts in time (a person in the present actually
walking into the past), the flashbacks are invested with a degree of
eerie immediacy.  Although the forced ending, which seems deigned to
create an unnatural moment of triumph, weakens the climactic catharsis,
it doesn't diminish the human tragedy which is central to DOLORES
CLAIBORNE.</P>
