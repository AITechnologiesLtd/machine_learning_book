<PRE>RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK
A Review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Harrison Ford; Karen Allen; Paul Freeman; Ronald Lacey & John
Rhys-Davies</P>
<P>In My humble opinion, Raiders of The Lost Ark ties Star Wars as the best
movie of all time. If that doesn't give you a hint as to the contents of
this review, nothing will.</P>
<P>It's 1935, and Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is a professor of archaeology.
Only, that's his day job. Jones is a globe hopper who has a unique talent
for acquiring rare antiquities. Jones' talents come to the attention of U.S.
Army intelligence, who just happen to require a little assistance. It seems
that Adolf Hitler and his Nazis have set out to recover the long lost Ark of
the Covenant. The Ark, according to the bible, was the container in which
the Ten Commandments were housed. According to legend the Ark will bring
incredible power to those who possess it. Jones, always up for a challenge,
agrees to try to find the Ark before the Nazis do.</P>
<P>I'm not going to bother giving a synopsis of the rest of the movie, because
99% of the people reading this review will already have seen the movie. As
to the other 1%, trust me when I say that nothing I could write here would
ever do this movie justice. Raiders is the classic action adventure, there
has never been anything like it before, and nothing since has ever measured
up to it. Including it's two sequels.</P>
<P>Harrison Ford is perfect as the adventurer who completes his goals no matter
what it takes.
The rest on the supporting cast do a fantastic job, including John
Rhys-Davies as Indiana's Egyptian connection Sallah and Paul Freeman as
Beloq, the French archaeologist who heads up the Nazi team searching for the
Ark. The only weakness in this movie comes from the casting of Karen Allen
as Marion Ravenwood, Jones' former flame and current partner in his quest
for the Ark. Not that there is anything wrong with Allen's acting, I've just
never felt that she was right for the part. Oh well, if that is my biggest
complaint about a movie I'm doing OK.</P>
<P>I could rave on and on about this movie for hours, but in the end I would
probably be just preaching to the choir. If you are one of the very few
people who have never seen this film, do yourself a favor and watch it. I
guarantee you will not regret it.</P>
<P>Possibly the best film ever made  10/10</P>
