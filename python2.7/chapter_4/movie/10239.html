<PRE>"A" is for Amistad
by Homer Yen
(c) 1997</PRE>
<P>Throughout the history of Man, our individuality, our evolution, and
our innate ability to define who we are stems from one concept.
Freedom is what allows us to pursue our inalienable rights of life,
liberty and happiness.  The struggle to attain that freedom; however,
has come at a high price.  Consider the sacrifice that Jesus made.
Consider the American Revolutionary War.  Consider the case of the
Amistad.</P>
<P>In 1839, slaves aboard the ship, La Amistad, escape from their bonds
and subsequently overrun the ship.  Enraged, they kill most of their
captors. The Amistad is eventually captured by the US Navy, and the
escapees are brought to stand trial for various counts of murder and
mayhem.  But this is more than just a simple trial.  During this time
period, the symbolic nature of this trial will have a long-lasting
effect that will ultimately help to shape the direction of young
America.  Several interested parties all have a large stake in its
outcome.  Some view the slaves as property and want the trial to be
handled as a property issue.  The trial also has repercussions that
threatens the stability of an international treaty.  But most
importantly, exonerating and freeing the Amistad defendants may
ultimately throw the country into civil war as southern leaders will
look upon this as a prelude to total emancipation, which would be a
threat to their economic prosperity.</P>
<P>This is a very fragile and pivotal point in America's history.  Part
of the film acutely illustrates the atrocities of the slave trade.
Men, women and children are ripped apart from their families and
communities, only to be sold as a commodity. Their lives have been
stripped away.  Their ordeal is torturous.  Like cattle, some are sold
off while others are slaughtered.  It is truly shocking to witness
such brutality.  You can not help but shed a tear for those
unfortunate victims.  The other portion takes the form of a courtroom
drama that shows how the great minds of that day tried to maneuver
through moral ambiguity and address a higher order of responsibility.</P>
<P>Those that wished to set the slaves free include Roger Baldwin
(Matthew McConaughey), a lawyer who at first bases his case on
property law but slowly comes to see his clients as human beings. The
cause is also supported by two abolitionists, a former slave (Morgan
Freeman) and an immigrant named Tappan (Stellan Skarsgard).  Former
President John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins) also argues eloquently
and ably for their freedom. Those that oppose their freedom include
the pubescent Queen of Spain (Anna Paquin) who demands that the slaves
be returned to her, sailors and merchants that hold receipts of their
purchase, and a bumbling President Van Buren (Nigel Hawthorne), who is
constantly being pressured by Southerners that threaten secession.
The leader of the slaves, Cinque, (African model Djimon Hounsou), is
truly a majestic and formidable leader.  He doesn't speak any English,
but must somehow try to free his comrades in a foreign environment
where the judicial system is still experiencing growing pains.</P>
<P>Directed by Steven Spielberg, you can see his penchant for
over-the-top poignancy.  Indeed, there are some incredibly moving
scenes that can bring you to tears.  The plight of the Amistad
defendants is a heart-wrenching one.  Cinque's crusade is poetic.
Another highlight is Anthony Hopkins as the dotty politician, who
delivers one of the best courtroom speeches ever (Oscar contender as
Best Supporting Actor).  There are, however, two minor (very minor)
complaints that I want to point out.  The first is that the actual
exploration of the slave trade happens outside the main framework of
this movie.  It serves as a backdrop to Cinque's quest for freedom.
Eventually, and this is my second minor reservation, this fact gives
way to an extended courtroom drama, which covers the last 90 minutes
of the film.</P>
<P>But, do not let these observations discount the importance of this
historical epic.  Amistad, based on the book, Black Mutiny, is
courageously weighty and poignant.  It's an important movie and offers
a historical peek into a young nation when a few good men desperately
tried to do the right thing within a misguided society that was deeply
divided.</P>
