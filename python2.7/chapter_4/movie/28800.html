<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>An atmospheric and most entertaining Charlie Chan episode. It was the longest
Charlie Chan made at 79 minutes and it was the first one not based on an Earl
Derr Biggers book. World famous detective Charlie Chan (Oland) has just finished
a case in London and says farewell to the home secretary on his way back to
Honolulu. But he is approached by the sister of an innocent man convicted of
murder, who is set to be hung in 65 hours. Pamela Gray (Leyton) along with her
fiancé, the lawyer Neil Howard (Milland), who defended her brother Paul
(Walton), appeal to Chan for help after the home secretary says he can't stop
the execution. When Neil tells Chan he thinks Paul is guilty, Pamela breaks the
engagement by flinging the engagement ring at him. </P>
<P>Charlie thinks differently and takes the case. He heads for the scene of the
crime, the wealthy estate of Geoffrey Richmond (Mowbray). All the guests are the
same that witnessed the murder and are gathered there for a weekend fox hunt.
Since all the court appeals have been exhausted, the only chance of freeing Paul
is to catch the real killer. </P>
<P>As Chan pries into the way the actual murder occurred, he reenacts the crime
with the help of the three witnesses who were present and testified in court.
The witnesses are Maj. Jardine (Barraud), Bunny Fothergill (England), and Jerry
Gorton (Johnson). He discovers that the groom, Lake (Rogers), can calm the wild
horse in the stable where the murder took place and is a very nervous man. But
the groom claims he was not there the night of the murder. </P>
<P>Chan zeroes in on the circumstantial evidence used against Paul, by noting there
were no fingerprints found on the knife used as the murder weapon, that no one
saw Paul do the crime, and that the victim, Air Force Captain Hamilton, did not
like Paul and earlier on quarreled with him over a chorus girl. Chan believes
this is not motive enough for a crime of passion, especially since the killer
wore gloves and had to have someone quiet the stable horse or else the mare
would wake up the entire house. </P>
<P>When he goes to question Lake again in the morning he discovers that he was
murdered, but that it was made to look like a suicide as the poor man is found
with a wallet full of hush money. Sergeant Thacker (Clive) is called in to
investigate and after believing it a suicide now agrees with Charlie. He
comically calls Chan by the name of Chang; he's a dim-witted detective, who is
more of hinderance than a help. </P>
<P>Chan receives a note from Geoffrey's fiancee, Mary (Barrie), someone who is also
being courted by Gorton, who tells him she has important evidence to share with
him. But Chan is visiting the Air Force base Hamilton was stationed at and
discovers that he was an inventor working on a secret invention to silence war
planes. That if his plans could be gotten, they would be very lucrative. Chan
figures the motive for the murder was the stealing of those plans and they are
to be found in the study of Geoffrey's estate. </P>
<P>When Chan returns to the fox hunt, it's discovered Mary had a serious accident
and has a fractured skull. Upon investigating Chan finds it was no accident, but
someone blinded the horse causing the nearly fatal spill. </P>
<P>Chan now gathers everyone in the study, including the secretive butler Phillips
(Kinnell), whom he sees poking around the study for the plans, and announces the
murderer's fingerprints are on Hamilton's invention plans. This traps the killer
to come out in the open and try to kill Chan. But Chan saves Paul from being
hung with at least a few hours to spare, as he put blank cartridges in the
killer's gun and the cop's waiting in the other room arrest the killer in the
study. This film was more a case of Charlie Chan in the English countryside than
in London, but why quibble over a title when the story was so entertaining! </P>
