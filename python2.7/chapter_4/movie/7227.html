<PRE>                             THE DEVIL'S OWN
                       A film review by Walter Frith
                        Copyright 1997 Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>Columbia Pictures was quite upset with Brad Pitt recently when Pitt made
statements to the media that 'The Devil's Own' was one of the worst
filmmaking experiences he had ever had.  Pitt later recanted those statements
but the cat was already out of the bag and while this motion picture isn't
really all that bad, it does have large plot holes and one dimensional
characterizations.</P>
<P>A terrorist in the IRA (Pitt) escapes justice in Northern Ireland in 1992
where he is hunted for the deaths of twenty four people.  The people he's
been involved in murdering are a combination of police officers and British
soldiers and Pitt flees to America where he makes connections to take up
residence with a family headed by Harrison Ford who is a New York City police
officer.  Pitt passes himself off as a landed immigrant with a construction
job to go to so the family never learns at first what the true objective of
his visit is.  His true objective while in New York is to purchase military
hardware, mostly missles from and arms dealer (Treat Williams).  Ford's
family is dragged into the chaos which erupts as Pitt becomes the target of
many of his enemies.</P>
<P>The movie's psychological profile of Pitt's involvement in terrorism stems
from the fact that as a boy of eight, he witnessed the murder of his father
by an intruding gun man one evening as his family was sitting down to dinner.
 Ford's character has an attack of conscience on two fronts.  One by helping
bring Pitt in to the authorities alive once Pitt's cover is blown and the
other involves Ford lying to protect his partner (Ruben Blades) who is being
investigated for shooting a robbery suspect in the back.  </P>
<P>Director Alan J. Pakula ('All the President's Men', 'Sophie's Choice',
'Consenting Adults') uses silence in many scenes to make the picture's
atmosphere more powerful without disruptive music or loud action sound.  Brad
Pitt and Harrison Ford have some good moments on film together but 'The
Devil's Own' lacks plot and character development wide enough for the movie
to justify its running time of almost two hours courtesy of screenwriters
David Aaron Cohen, Vincent Patrick and Kevin Jarre based on Jarre's story.
 It does have a convincing story about clandestine terrorism gone awry but
looks too much like the studio was trying to use big name stars to rake in
the dollars when stars of much less notoriety could have pulled it off.</P>
