<PRE>PERFECT BLUE</PRE>
<PRE>A film Review by Athan Bezaitis
Copyright Athan Bezaitis 1999</PRE>
<P>If it were somehow easier to translate Japanese into English without
losing so much essential meaning and depth, anime style films would
surely be more entertaining and maybe even accepted by mainstream
American audiences.  This unique style of animation is fun to watch,
especially when it's in the context of a sadistic story such as
PERFECT BLUE.  The exaggerated features and expressions along with the
mess of blood and gore seem perfectly suited for the larger-than-life
anime style.  Unfortunately, PERFECT BLUE is nothing more than
visually exhilarating, and the reason is that too much is lost in the
dubbing from its original format.</P>
<P>Directed by Satoshi Kon, PERFECT BLUE is the story of 21-year-old pop
star Mima Kirigoe, who is the lead singer in the all-girl band Cham.
Heeding advice from her agent to get out of the business before her
fame runs out, she decides to become an actress.  Like many of the
instant pop celebrities before her, Mima finds it hard to be taken
seriously and is forced to change her image in order to be cast in
larger roles.  In her first big feature she plays a stripper who is
raped and sets off on a wild killing spree.  A disturbed fan, who also
runs her Website, refuses to accept that his favorite pop star is
changing her persona and is obsessed with keeping Mima the innocent
young starlet that he has fallen in love with.  After several of the
people associated with casting her in smutty roles are murdered, Mima
becomes plagued with disturbing hallucinations and is stalked by the
deranged Webmaster who somehow knows too many details of her personal
life.  Mima eventually can no longer discern fantasy from reality and
becomes paralyzed by her inability to associate the events around her
with increasingly disturbing visions.</P>
<P> The film is inundated with frighteningly sordid imagery.  I would
definitely categorize it as a horror film complete with vicious
stabbings, a naive female victim being stalked and hunted, and a
staged rape scene that is downright chilling.  Don't be fooled into
taking your kids to see this one just because they like Power Rangers.
This one will be rated R and deservedly so.</P>
<P>The main problem is that too much of the dialogue seems canned and
sappy.  The translation makes Mima seem almost dumb as she is
confronted with a chain of events that she does nothing to cope with.
She comes off as nothing more than a ditsy child even as those close
to her are dying and she seems to be losing her mind.  If you're in
the mood for something dark and twisted this is the right film for
you.  Otherwise spare yourself the trouble of having to sit through
what is a crude film that will be hard for most audiences to swallow.</P>
