                - Wiest to her character's son, who thinks he's a vampire.</PRE>
<P>     Despite what the "critics" claim, COPS & ROBBERSONS may be the
movie that jump-starts the career of Chevy Chase.  Said career needs
*something*, considering that its brightest spot (in the last five
years, at least) is a nacho chip commercial.</P>
<P>     Survive the trailer for 3 NINJAS STRIKE BACK--Pepto Bismal
encouraged--and you're ready for COPS & ROBBERSONS: a nicely
underplayed, almost-charming comedy about a super-tough city-cop
(Palance) who invades Suburbia to start a stake-out.</P>
<P>     Welcome to Pleasant Valley--a sickly sweet suburb located only a
few blocks away from the preplanned nonsense of E.T. and EDWARD
SCISSORHANDS.  The cars and homes and streets look almost alike and in
this idyllic little world lives the less-than-idyllic Robbersons.</P>
<P>     The father, Norman (Chase), is a cop-show junkie who spends his
boring days humming TV themes and reading penal codes and driving with
a police radio.  Over-eager Mom (Wiest) tries to be super-sunny, but
she can't even get the family to eat dinner together.  The daughter is
dating, the older son (Ritcher) is smoking, and his younger brother
thinks he's a vampire.</P>
<P>     Clearly, this family needs *something*.</P>
<P>     Enter Detective Jake Stone (Palace).  He and his partner (Gray)
want to spy on a counterfeiter (Davi) living next door.  Jake is a
seasoned sourpuss and his relationship with the Robbersons is strictly
hate-hate.  That is, until Norman starts snooping and ends up
introducing "Uncle" Jake to their nefarious neighbor.  Said action
forces Jake and The Young Man to maintain their cover for 24
hours-a-day and, thus, eat, sleep, and shoot with the Robbersons.</P>
<P>     COPS & ROBBERSONS is 100% light comedy.  The plot is absurd, the
characters are sketches, and the gags are mild.  Even the prerequisite
free-for-all ending is a tame one, save for Chase impersonating Robin
Hood Daffy with a gag stolen from Chuck Jones.</P>
<P>     What's fun, though, is the lazy chemistry between the leads and
their delivery of some great, goofy dialogue from writer Bernie
Somers.</P>
<P>     Chase remains *the* effortlest bumbler.  His blase blunder hints
at the simplicity that Peter Sellers brought to the role of *Chief*
Inspector Jacques Clouseau.  Watch him roll a cigarette for maximum
minimum-hilarity.</P>
<P>     COPS plays closer to ensemble comedy and Chase shares his share of
screen time with both Jack Palance and Robert Davi--two rasping
rapscallions who get quite a bit of mileage by simply leering at Chevy
chasing his tail.  Palace doesn't have much of character, though, but
he gets to growl great lines like "Don't ever throw a cat on me."
Listen for his classic monologue about mowing grass.</P>
<P>     (The obligatory one-armed pushup occurs in a photo montage before
the closing credits.)</P>
<P>     Dianne Wiest doesn't get to play as often as the boys, but she's a
stitch in her few scenes and, in the finale, go nuts with gusto.</P>
<P>     COPS & ROBBERSONS strains in a couple places.  The beginning is a
bust--come on, *another* exploding car?  Then there's Chase doing
DeNiro doing TAXI DRIVER.  Save that one for your next SATURDAY NIGHT
LIVE appearance, Chevy.</P>
<PRE>Bottom line:    COPS & ROBBERSONS is fluff.  But as fluff goes, it's
                pretty tasty stuff. </PRE>
<PRE>Grade: B-</PRE>
