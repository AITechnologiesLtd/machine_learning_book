<P>AIR FORCE ONE -- a movie review by Justin Siegel</P>
<P>Harrison Ford is the president of the United States.</P>
<P>No really, Harrison Ford _is_ the president of the United States. If I 
were an American citizen and was of legal age and woke before noon one 
day, I'd vote for him. He's my hero, man. I mean, when he's up there 
battling terrorists, being a family-man and fighting tooth-decay, I don't 
worry about him. He'll be A-Okay! If it were Bill Clinton up there, then 
I'd be scared, but come on, this is Harrison Ford. They should've handed 
out little buttons that say "Vote for Harrison Ford this July!" after the 
movie.</P>
<P>Ford is one of the many good things AIR FORCE ONE (or AFO to those who 
are too cool for their own good) has going for it. Others are Glenn 
Close, William H. Macy (the guy from FARGO), director Wolfgang Petersen, 
and a great script. One thing going against it is the 
impausability-factor. While it's not as high as that of FACE/OFF, where 
two men swap faces, it's easily as high as CON AIR, in which a handful of 
prisoners highjack an airplane.</P>
<P>What is it with all the implauable movies this summer?</P>
<P>After giving an emotional speech about how the USA will not negotiate 
with terrorists and locking up some sort of Russian comrade, President 
Harrison Ford heads back to Air Force One in a limo, looking forward to 
watching a football game and spending some time with his acting-impared 
12-year-old daughter.</P>
<P>Not so easy, because this time, loyallist to the aformentioned Russian 
comrade Gary Oldman has, with the help of someone who is supposed to be 
on President Ford's side, hijacked Air Force One. He will kill one 
hostage (there are like, 50, including the first lady, first daughter, 
and first monkey) every half-hour until the Russian comrade that they 
locked up is released.</P>
<P>Silly Russian. Didn't anyone ever tell him not to mess with Harrison 
Ford?</P>
<P>President Bill Clinton has said he's seen this film twice. _Twice_. This 
is the busiest, most powerful man in the world and he's seen this film 
_twice_. Then he goes home and has a nice long jacuzi. It's funny -- I 
can just imagine him swinging from a cable dangling from a diving plane. 
He's lucky he let Harrison Ford do that for him.</P>
