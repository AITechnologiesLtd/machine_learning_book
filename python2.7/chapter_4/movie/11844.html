<PRE>SLEEPERS
** (out of four)

<P>Kevin Bacon, Robert DeNiro, Dustin Hoffman, Jason Patric, Brad Pitt
written & directed by Barry Levinson</P>
<P>With a weak script at its core, SLEEPERS is akin to the world's
greatest chefs making toast. Based on the supposedly non-fictional
book by Lorenzo Carcaterras (it's difficult to believe, for starters,
that Carcaterras and his friends look like Patric and Pitt), the film
offers very little in the way of tension or drama, and even resorts to
such tired devices as (flat, obvious) narration to make sense of the
complicated--but by no means involving-- plot. This is despite a
wealth of talent before and behind the camera.</P>
<P>Hell's Kitchen is the setting for the story, in which a group of four
mischief-prone boys accidentally injure a bystander when one of their
pranks goes awry. Said boys are then sent to a reformatory, where they
pay for their mistake in the form of Bacon's perverted guard, who
sexually tortures them repeatedly during their stay. Fourteen years
later, two of his victims discover Bacon at a bar and gun him
down. It's up to Patric and Pitt, who have grown up to become a
reporter and a lawyer, respectively, to help their childhood amigos
win the court case that follows.</P>
<P>The best thing one can say about SLEEPERS is that it features some
nice performances by DeNiro as Father Bob, the neighbourhood priest,
and Dustin Hoffman as a washed-up alcoholic lawyer, as well as a few
well-crafted individual scenes.  Levinson (RAIN MAN, DISCLOSURE) pays
no attention to detail in terms of the eighties sequences, in which
everyone wears stylish 1996 clothing. But that's a moot point compared
to the script's central problem: we don't care about any of these
people, or whether they triumph in the end, because their
personalities are interchangeable and ultimately unappealing. The
pacing is terrible; if Levinson insisted on making a film this long
(two-and-a-half hours) he should have spent the time developing the
characters instead of showing us redundant flashbacks and silly scenes
which further complicate the plot.</P>
<P>Molestation and pedophilia are very serious issues that have been
fashioned here into a story as perfunctory and pointless as a TV
movie-of-the-week. While "Sleepers" in the film are defined as people
who have been waiting to get revenge, the title more aptly describes
director and crew during the making of the film. It's bad enough that
these wonderful chefs made toast. They burned it.</P>
