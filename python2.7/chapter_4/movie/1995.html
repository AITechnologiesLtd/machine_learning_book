                       A film review by Keith Meng-Wei Loh
                        Copyright 1993 Keith Meng-Wei Loh</PRE>
<P>EL MARIACHI -- LOW BUDGET ACTION, 'BIG BUDGET' EFFECT? -- </P>
<P>     For those of us who have been raised on a steady diet of Hollywood
films and culture, the pre)eminence of the budget and of dollar signs
have come to represent a benchmark--a signpost--that, in the hype
media, at least, indicates the value of a film.</P>
<P>     Those absorbed in the Hollywood culture have come to follow films
as an industry and, consequently, have come to regard the budget as a
star on the marquee, and at times on an equal footing as the true stars
themselves.  So, then, the budget of LAST ACTION HERO, which can only
be guessed as more than the health expenditures of many developing
countries, should have equal billing as the formidable name of Arnold
Schwarzenegger and John McTiernan.</P>
<P>     If so, the marquee for EL MARIACHI would be ridiculously out of
touch.  It would read: EL MARIACHI / written and directed by Robert
Rodriguez / budget: US $7,000.</P>
<P>     $7,000 is surely a fraction of the cost of a Hollywood marketing
campaign in mid-sized city.  For a Hollywood seven grand you may be
able to rent cameras for an hour but you would not be able to pay for
their insurance.  Seven grand worth of film can be shot and dumped in a
few minutes.  You could not afford Arnold Schwarzenegger for any length
of time.</P>
<P>     Likely, you also would not have John McTiernan or even John Woo
helming your production, but you would have twenty-four-year old Robert
Rodriguez.  And if you are Rodriguez, you can hire yourself for nothing
and work between university semesters, beg for cameras, probably
collect a cast of actors willing to work for nothing or a percentage,
and *then* somehow find studio time for editing.  Your $7,000 would go
a far longer way in Mexico than in Hollywood, but not a lot more.</P>
<P>     EL MARIACHI is not a great film, but it is a decent action/comedy
in the mold of many Hollywood styled guns and laughs films that have
come to pervade the film industries of many other countries.  The
bustling Hong Kong and Indian film industries each boast output far in
excess of the U.S. industry and with budgets likely a third of the
average U.S. film budget for their most expensive action blockbusters.
Many, like EL MARIACHI will have come through on shoestring budgets
with very decent, even big budget effects.</P>
<P>     It took nearly a decade for the fame of John Woo to come through
to the U.S., a director of action films with a distinctive American
flavour but who out-does most Americans in dazzle and stunts.  On the
American doorstep, does the Mexican industry offer a similar boomerang
effect?  EL MARIACHI is not HARDBOILED by any means, but it is a
good example of how, in many places, a low budget means very little if
off-set by energy and vision.  Gussied up and given a recognizably
Hollywood cast, EL MARIACHI becomes a Van Damme movie or even
RESERVOIR DOGS, another example of how a small budget (though not
$7,000!) can mean very little within the U.S.</P>
<P>     The vision in EL MARIACHI is a familiar one with a twist just as
its character is American put on a Mexican twist.  It's a case of
mistaken identity: a mariachi player arrives in a town looking for work
at the same time as a vengeful hitman returns looking for the yanqui
crime boss who put him in jail.  Both wear black and carry guitar
cases.  But in the hitman's case is an arsenal; the mariachi has his
guitar.</P>
<P>     You can figure out the rest but it must be said that EL MARIACHI
is witty and well plotted.  The action is not complex, but comparable
with many American films.  There is an obligatory body count but in its
heart EL MARIACHI is a comedy that is well worth the time.</P>
<P>     EL MARIACHI's billing as an "homage to the spaghetti western" is
an irony that can't be missed.  "Spaghetti westerns" were, in the 60s
and 70s, examples of Italian directors like Sergio Leone outworking an
American mythos better than Americans when the dominant American
cinemacultural product was the western.  In the 80s, the dominant
American product has had to be the action-adventure (sourced, of
course, from the westerns).</P>
<P>     At the height of the action)adventure dubbed copies of RAMBO:
FIRST BLOOD PART III played to packed houses in Beirut.  While no film
would likely bill themselves as homages "to the 80s Rambo pictures," it
seems clear that the boomerang for this American product is coming back
with a vengeance.  Later this year, John Woo will be releasing HARD
TARGET starring Jean Claude Van Damme.  Is this any different than
Sergio Leone bringing back Clint Eastwood in the "Man With No Name"
pictures?</P>
<P>     None of this is to say that what are coming back are photocopies.
To do that would be to enter into the dangerous America vs. Asia
stereotypical battles which have come to litter the political arena.
Here we are speaking of culture and cultural spin.  The films that come
back may have been sourced in American "flavour" but they return with
decidedly different and original spins.</P>
<P>     While in EL MARIACHI we have a scene with the Mariachi in black
clothes walking down the street with a MAC-10 slung over his shoulder
in a seeming carbon of the TERMINATOR, Arnold was never carrying a
guitar case in the other hand, nor did he ever sing love songs while
under threat of castration.  The enemies in EL MARIACHI are the
gringos, not the dark skinned enemies of Rambo and the code of conduct
is decidedly latin.</P>
<P>     Finally, the most important spin that has come back with this
boomerang is a perspective on the cost of films.  Returning to what I
was said at the beginning, if we are to regard film budgets as an
expression of their value, then to see quality films returning with
budgets a fraction of the cost of their American cousins is to realize
that American costs and benefits have polarized.  The budget has taken
on an immense portion of the marquee in the U.S., where elsewhere the
cost is still a means, not a justification.</P>
