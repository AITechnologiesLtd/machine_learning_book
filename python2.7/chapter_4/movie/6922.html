<PRE>                             MARGARET'S MUSEUM
                       A film review by Froilan Vispo

<P>Treasure to be found in MARGARET'S MUSEUM </P>
<PRE>*** out of ****</PRE>
<P>Those familiar with Helena Bonham Carter from Merchant-Ivory films may
be mildly surprised by her transformation from her previous prim and
corseted roles to the drably dressed but earthy lead in MARGARET'S
MUSEUM, a romance set in a 1940s Nova Scotia coal mining town.  The
gothic conclusion offers a shock seemingly disparate from the gentle
melodrama, but consider it an emphatic reclamation of love lost and
proclamation thereof. </P>
<P>Bonham Carter does admirably as Margaret, a self-described "snot-nosed
whore" whose candid working-class humour conceals the loss of her father
and older brother from a coal pit accident.  Margaret's mother, played
by Kate Nelligan in the film's best performance, is instead soured by
their deaths and she makes the social rounds at the frequent funerals
more out of self-interest than actual grief.</P>
<P>Death is a frequent visitor to Glace Bay's coal mines, and each time an
accident occurs the town, alerted by sirens, gathers at the mine
expecting familiar victims.  The residents seem resigned to a fate
linked with the mines, by far the town's largest employer, but Margaret
has had enough and is defiant in her wish for a rosier future for
herself and her younger brother, whose own blossoming romance is
stiffly-handled and is the film's minor flaw.</P>
<P>Margaret meets Neil (Clive Russell), a gentle giant of an Irishman
skilled with the bagpipe and many things Gaelic.  His disdain for
working in the coal mines echoes hers and he is set head and shoulders
above the miners to Margaret.  Theirs is a down to earth romance,
refreshingly blunt and uninhibited.  When the reality of their meagre
finances hits home, Neil is forced to reconsider his aversion to the
mines, and Margaret becomes reluctant about the return to a life where
death is an everyday unrelenting threat. </P>
<P>And what will you find in Margaret's museum?  Expect to find evidence of
lives lost to the coal mines.  Most importantly is that those lives have
been reclaimed from the mines and returned to those who continue to love
them.</P>
<P>Review completed February 12, 1997.
