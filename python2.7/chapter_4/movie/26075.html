<PRE>NURSE BETTY</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * * *</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Neil LaBute
Written by: John C. Richards, James Flamberg</PRE>
<P>Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) is a waitress obsessed with a soap opera 
called "A Reason to Love". Who can blame her for dreaming of another life 
when she's stuck with a dead-end job and a husband, Del (Aaron Eckhart), who 
couldn't care less about her? One evening, her husband comes home with two 
associates, Wesley and Charlie (Chris Rock, Morgan Freeman), not knowing 
that Betty is still in the house. It turns out these associates are actually 
there to reclaim stolen drugs from Del. After Del is killed, and Betty 
witnesses the event, she becomes so traumatized that her mind convinces her 
she is actually living in the world of her soap opera, and she is engaged to 
the lead character, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). So she leaves a message 
for Del, telling him she had to leave (her brain refuses to admit he's 
dead), and heads for Los Angeles, where Dr. Ravell works at Loma Vista 
hospital. Of course, Dr. David Ravell is actually an actor named George 
McCord, and Loma Vista hospital is only a set, but Betty's traumatized mind 
has no idea. Meanwhile, Charlie and Wesley find out that Betty saw 
everything, and they head after her. Wesley just wants the job over with, 
but Charlie's mind soon becomes as warped as Betty's, and he becomes 
convinced she is really the perfect woman for him.</P>
<P>After a summer filled with useless movies, "Nurse Betty" is like a breath of 
fresh air. Just as I was getting ready to write 2000 off as the worst year 
for comic movies (actually, for movies in general) ever, along comes this 
little gem. Big surprise, it came from USA Films; the same company that 
brought us "Being John Malkovich". While the film certainly isn't your 
traditional comedy, it has a nice blend of laugh out loud bits and a great 
many chuckles. Now, you have to like your humor a little on the unusual side 
to enjoy this movie. In fact, throughout the film, all I could think about 
was how much it felt like a Coen brothers movie. Just like the Coens' 
excellent "The Big Lebowski", this is a movie made great and entertaining by 
its sheer variety of eccentric characters. Is it as funny as the Coens' 
film? No, but the dude is a tough act to follow. Yet in its own way, "Nurse 
Betty" succeeds admirably. By the way, if you love gross-out humor you're 
going to the wrong movie. This is one that's made for the rest of us 
(finally). In other words, it's fairly intelligent fluff that probably won't 
win many major awards, but it'll sure entertain.</P>
<P>One of the greatest strengths to "Nurse Betty" is the excellent cast. Renee 
Zellweger ("Me, Myself, and Irene"), who I really wasn't too sure about, 
proves herself here. As the slightly ditzy, very confused Betty, she is 
simply too endearing for words. She manages to keep a smile plastered on her 
face without making it look phony, and it only slips when a situation arises 
to really confuse her (this happens a lot less often than you'd think, she's 
so caught up in her fantasy world). Greg Kinnear ("Mystery Men") is perfect 
as Betty's obsession, going from decent guy to sleaze ball and back again 
without missing a beat. I have to hand it to Kinnear, the man does baffled 
almost as well as Zellweger. I normally don't care for Chris Rock's 
("Dogma") particular brand of acting, which seems to involve him yelling a 
lot. While he uses this same acting style throughout "Nurse Betty", it works 
since he is counter balanced by the eternally calm Morgan Freeman. Speaking 
of that great actor, if he doesn't get an Oscar nomination for this 
performance heads are going to role. His turn as Charlie, the hit-man one 
job away from retirement, is simply brilliant. It's a shame Freeman doesn't 
get more of these kinds of roles, because his comic timing is impeccable.</P>
<P>There are several scenes in this movie that are, quite frankly, comic gold. 
The first meeting between Betty and George is absolutely priceless. The two 
play off each other so well, the entire scene almost feels improvised. 
Another great scene is one where Charlie and Wesley take a slight detour to 
visit the grand canyon (Wesley calls it the bland canyon), and Charlie 
starts dancing with a hallucination of Betty. Yet the movie is, above all 
else, a black comedy. If you can't laugh at detestable people getting 
exactly what they deserve, you're better off seeing something else. For 
example, the scene where Charlie and Wesley kill the hapless Del is 
horrifying, but the aftermath is quite funny if you can bring yourself to 
laugh after watching someone get scalped. Neil LaBute (who also directed the 
very disturbing "In the Company of Men") keeps the film running along quite 
nicely, and this is a big boon. This was one of those rare movies (at least 
this year) where I wasn't just waiting for it to end. In fact, I wouldn't 
have minded in the slightest if it had run a touch longer; maybe have 
explored a few subplots (more on that next paragraph) that never develop. Oh 
well, that's just me for you, impossible to satisfy.</P>
<P>My complaints with the movie are few, but rather significant. Foremost among 
them being that there are a few little sub-plots which sadly never get 
developed. For example, one involves Betty getting hired on at the hospital 
after saving a man's life. After the head nurse hires her to work in the 
pharmacy, and warns her against messing with the patients, you expect this 
to go somewhere and it never does. The film also starts off a little slowly 
(I was starting to think, "oh no, not another dud."), but once it gets going 
it really goes. There were a few points during the movie where I couldn't 
breath I was laughing so hard. The real priceless scene is near the end, 
when Charlie and Betty finally meet up. The dialogue in this scene is 
absolutely perfect, and Freeman and Zellweger have some great on-screen 
chemistry. The soundtrack features a great new score from composer Rolfe 
Kent ("Election"), and the cinematography by Jean-Yves Escoffier 
("Rounders") is really quite beautiful (his shots of the western countryside 
belong in a travel magazine somewhere). The movie runs 112 minutes, but it 
won't feel half that long. I'd recommend it to those who like their humor a 
little on the dark side, and to fans of Morgan Freeman and Renee Zellweger 
since both really shine here. I give the movie four out of five stars.</P>
