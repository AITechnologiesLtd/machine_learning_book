<P>     THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION, based on the novel of the same name by 
Stephen McCauley, is a pleasant romantic comedy that asks (and tries to 
answer) questions about the nature of love, sex, family, and friendship.  
And, while some of the solutions are a little facile, the film 
nevertheless succeeds, due in large part to a luminous performance by 
Jennifer Aniston and the effectively-developed central relationship 
between Aniston's Nina Borowski, a pregnant twentysomething 
heterosexual, and George Hanson (Paul Rudd), a gay man in the same age 
range.  </P>
<P>     In most movies, friendships are the equivalent of cinematic side 
orders.  Especially in contemporary productions, almost every main 
character has to have a best friend.  This facilitates character 
development and allows secondary interaction.  Rarely, however, is 
friendship the point of a movie.  That's not the case in THE OBJECT OF 
MY AFFECTION, which, although it is a little about sex and love, is much 
more about the undemanding, casual affection that builds between real 
friends.  The chemistry between Aniston and Rudd is perfect in 
establishing this relationship.  They have a real camaraderie which is 
only occasionally spiced up by a hint of sexual tension.</P>
<P>     George and Nina meet at a dinner party that neither of them is 
enjoying.  They soon discover that they have a great deal in common, and 
the fact that she's straight and he's gay makes them ideal candidates 
for roommates.  Once George's current relationship with a egotistical 
doctor (Timothy Daly) comes to an end, George moves into a bedroom in 
Nina's Brooklyn apartment.  The two quickly become best friends, with a 
closeness that is so extreme that, when Nina becomes pregnant by her 
boyfriend, Vince (MAD ABOUT YOU's Ira, John Pankow), she tells George 
first.  Problems arise, however, when Nina begins to fall for George 
while he simultaneously becomes interested in a young actor (Amo 
Gulinello).</P>
<P>     Jennifer Aniston's movie career has proceeded along an interesting 
trajectory.  She broke into the big screen business in LEPRECHAUN, a 
low-budget horror flick that she would probably prefer to forget about.  
Following a meteoric rise accompanying her participation in TV's 
FRIENDS, she gave a plastic performance in Edward Burns' SHE'S THE ONE.  
In her first feature starring role, PICTURE PERFECT, she showed hints of 
the charisma that has earner her a legion of loyal fans, but not until 
THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION has she truly sparkled.  As Nina, Aniston not 
only displays a surprising capacity for both comedy and drama, but she 
shines with the kind of star quality that only a handful of current 
performers exhibit.  THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION is clearly better 
because of her, not in spite of her.</P>
<P>     Nina's platonic/would-be-romantic opposite, George, as portrayed by 
Paul Rudd (CLUELESS), is likable.  This isn't a standout performance, 
but Rudd is good enough to convince us that his character feels genuine 
affection for Nina.  Alan Alda, who has a supporting part as Nina's 
brother-in-law, provides a fair share of humor in an openly-comic role.  
And Nigel Hawthorne once again proves his strength as an actor by 
fashioning a memorable individual out of what is little more than a bit 
part.  Hawthorne's Rodney Fraser is the kind of sad, lonely man who 
effortlessly captures one's pity.</P>
<P>     Many aspects of THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION are not new to movies.  
In fact, the central theme, which struggles with the similarities and 
differences between sexual and platonic love, has been more fully 
explored in recent historical features like CARRINGTON and MRS. BROWN 
(ideas presented in the former bear an especially strong resemblance to 
those developed here).  On the contemporary side, Kevin Smith's CHASING 
AMY travels a similar path (albeit to a different destination) with 
CHASING AMY, about a straight man who falls for a lesbian.  The one 
thing that all of these films have over THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION is an 
edge – each of them tries something a little unconventional and risky, 
while this movie attempts to be a crowd-pleaser.</P>
<P>     This is apparently director Nicholas Hytner's push to make a 
mainstream Hollywood movie.  The respected British director, whose best-
known effort is probably THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE, has a keen sense of 
character and a good feel for the details of a friendship, and these are 
the reasons why THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION, which has a pleasant (but 
not superlative) script, work.  For, while many of the secondary 
relationships are sketchily-developed and occasionally hard-to-swallow, 
the connection between George and Nina is so strong and believable that 
it draws us into their world and allows us to root for the seemingly-
improbable happy ending.</P>
