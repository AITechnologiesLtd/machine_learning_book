<P>I'm not sure about you all, but I always seem to relate the words
cutie-patootie to the lovely actress known as Sandra Bullock. Whether it be
in her interviews or her movie roles, the woman just seems to radiate joy,
giddiness and a generally nice aura of someone who doesn't take herself too
seriously. Which is why she is perfect for this role of a woman who is full
of energy and apparent joy, until confronted with the decision to take her
life more seriously or destroy herself and her loving relationships in the
long-run.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A woman with a penchant for the bottle drives a limousine into the side of a
house while intoxicated, and must serve 28 days in a rehabilitation center
or go to jail. Her initial indifference to the place and her issue, land her
into even more trouble, at which point, she must ultimately decide what she
wants out of her own life.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A surprisingly emotional and funny picture, which despite its
road-much-traveled feel, gives us enough interesting characters and a solid
performance from Bullock, to qualify as a solid feel-good dramedy. I don't
recommend you see this film if you're expecting to learn something new about
the process of rehabilitation, drug or alcohol addiction or the
relationships of an addict. But if you don't mind revisiting some of these
tendered themes once more in a film which moves at a quick pace, delivers
tit-for-tat moments of humor and drama, and ultimately gives you every
single 12-step quote needed for anyone to conquer any addiction of life,
then grab a couple of six-packs and check yourself into this moving picture.
Of course, I've never been shy to admit my own enjoyment of "the beverage"
every now and again, but thankfully my even bigger fixation on Internet
porn, hasn't allowed either habit to take over my life completely. But
enough about me. Harumph!</P>
<P>Sandra Bullock really surprised me in this film. Sure, her character is
still pretty cute, does and says cute things, and knows how to party (well,
early on in the movie that is... : ), but this movie allowed Sandra to
demonstrate a little more of her dramatic range, a talent which up until
this film, had personally gone completely unnoticed by moi. Well by golly,
she pulled it off something fierce with several decent scenes featuring a
serious Sandra wallowing in her troubles that be. Of course, much like any
other "institutionalized" movie, the rest of the characters in the film also
needed to create a certain amount of interest, if only enough to pad the
lead performances. The film delivers on that front as well. The stand-out in
the area of humour was definitely the "german gay guy" aka Alan Tyduk, who
had the crowd in stitches every time he uttered, or tried to utter, a word
in this film. Dramatically, Azura Sky took the honors with a touching
portrayal of a girl struggling to overcome her disabling disease, and the
best hair, as usual, went to the great Viggo Mortensen. I suspect that most
fans of Julia Roberts' ERIN BROCKOVICH (7/10) will enjoy this one as well,
seeing as both films feature top-dog actresses at the top of their
respective game, an interesting yet predictable story, and as per usual
Hollywood style, a generally upbeat ending. Of course, this film also has a
lot more humor going for it, but I suppose that's offset by the film's many
serious moments as well.</P>
<P>All in all, you don't have to be a drinker to appreciate this flick, but I
suppose an affection for Sandy Bullock, an understanding of the subject at
hand, and the capacity to embrace a familiar but entertaining theme, should
make this one enjoyable for most anyone fitting that bill. Bottom's up!</P>
