<PRE>                          THE SECRET OF ROAN INISH
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Mick Lally, Eileen Colgan, Jeni Courtney, Richard
Sheridan, John Lynch.
Screenplay/Director:  John Sayles.</P>
<P>     That John Sayles continues to make films is something of a
testimony to his dedication, and that his films continue to be
released is a testimony to an audience somewhere out there with
taste and intelligence.  Sayles has been relentlessly his own animal
as a writer-director, making movies like THE BROTHER FROM ANOTHER
PLANET, MATEWAN and PASSION FISH which have been marketing
nightmares because they were unique tales that a single tag line
couldn't capture.  As those examples also show, Sayles doesn't help
his cause any with catchy titles.  THE SECRET OF ROAN INISH is
another of Sayles' unconventional efforts, and yet another work of
art, a beautifully filmed tale of myth, magic and the power of oral
history.</P>
<P>     THE SECRET OF ROAN INISH opens in 1946, with 10-year-old Irish
girl Fiona Coneelly (Jeni Courtney) being sent away to live with her
grandparents on the isle's Western coast after the death of her
mother.  Grandfather Hugh (Mick Lally) is a fisherman who tells
Fiona tales of the family history, and brings her out to the
family's abandoned lands on the island of Roan Inish.  It was during
the family's mass departure from the island five years earlier that
Fiona's infant brother Jamie was washed out to sea in his cradle, an
event which still troubles Grandmother Tess (Eileen Colgan).  But
Tadhg (John Lynch), a Coneelly cousin, tells Fiona of a legend
connecting the Coneelly family to the seals of Roan Inish, a legend
which strengthens Fiona's belief that Jamie is still alive and
living on Roan Inish.</P>
<P>     I have made no secret in the past of my inordinate fondness for
tales of mythical Ireland (most recently 1993's INTO THE WEST), and
it is true that THE SECRET OF ROAN INISH plays to all of my
weaknesses.  Gifted cinematographer Haskell Wexler captures stunning
land- and seascapes with clarity even through layers of mist, and
his interiors are close but inviting.  Mason Daring's arrangements
of traditional folk melodies provide the perfect complement to
Wexler's images, full of soaring tin whistle and plaintive violin.
Most effective is Sayles' unsentimental directing style, which
presents ROAN INISH's more mythical elements so matter-of-factly
that they take on even more of an aura of wonder.  The Ireland of
THE SECRET OF ROAN INISH is full of magic, and Sayles presents magic
as an understood part of the tapestry of Irish life.</P>
<P>     What keeps the magic alive, however, is the oral tradition, and
this is what Sayles is truly celebrating in THE SECRET OF ROAN
INISH.  Several key events in the film unfold in flashback, but
always accompanied by the voice of a tale-teller (usually Hugh, on
one occasion Tadhg).  Even though we are also seeing the events
described, it is the words which are truly memorable, spoken with
passion and conviction, a direct link through time between
individuals and their history.  The story eventually becomes very
much about the consequences of abandoning one's history, and Sayles
makes his case strongly for the importance of maintaining those
connections, as well as the sheer joy to be derived from the
sharing of family legends.  At a time when tradition is a somewhat
unfashionable concept, Sayles has crafted a love poem to tradition.</P>
<P>     There is probably not a single name or face in the cast of ROAN
INISH which is familiar to American audiences, but the performances
are mostly charming and understated.  Mick Lally is delightful as
the seafaring grandfather, and John Lynch is dark and mysterious in
a small but significant role.  Newcomers Jeni Courtney (Fiona) and
Richard Sheridan (Fiona's cousin and co-conspirator Eamon) have
their weak moments, but are basically solid.  THE SECRET OF ROAN
INISH is lyrical, low-key and evocative, which could translate to
"slow and boring" for some audiences.  Those with a taste for
something crafted with grace, confidence and a feel for the power of
a well-told tale will find this one SECRET worth sharing.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 family legends:  9.</PRE>
