<P>        It seems like everyone has a gun in the movies, these days.  They
carry them, flaunt them, shoot them, and no one blinks an eye.  They're a
given; they're commonplace.  But for those of us who live outside of, say,
Texas, guns are not a commonplace, and while it's generally assumed that
characters get a hold of their guns somehow, we're not really encouraged to
wonder how or why.  BULLET BALLET is a film that wonders how and why: how
people get guns, and why they need them so much in the first place.</P>
<P>        The movie begins with a premise familiar from other recent Japanese
movies (cf. THE EEL, SHALL WE DANCE?, THE BIRD PEOPLE OF CHINA): a
plain-looking white-collar thirtyish Japanese man finds himself propulsed
into a situation that stands his world on its head, that unlocks the cell
in which his id, we assume, has long been imprisoned.  In BULLET BALLET,
the man is Goda (played by writer/director Shinya Tsukamoto), who makes
commercials; one day his girlfriend commits suicide, and although Goda
doesn't miss a day of work, he is (understandably) deeply traumatized.
There are repeated shots of a window in Goda's apartment, pierced by a
bullet hole, radiating cracks; similarly, the suicide is like a hole in his
head, radiating shards of pain that undermine his sanity.</P>
<P>        One day he is beaten by a gang of street punks and subsequently
fixates on one of them, sullen gamine Chisato (Kirina Mano).  Seeming both
to wish to revenge himself upon the gang and to become like them, Goda
becomes obsessed with purchasing a gun.  He roams the streets, he surfs the
Net, he searches, and finds it harder than you might think to acquire one.
Why does he want it so badly?  We're not sure--to provide an answer would
require something akin to characterization, which isn't the film's raison
d'être.  It's clear, though, that Goda's need for the gun has nothing
really to do with being beaten by the gang; they are a pretext, although he
displaces his motives onto them.</P>
<P>        It seems, ultimately, as if what he really wants is either to lash
out at the world for taking his girlfriend or to kill himself for failing
her.  In the world of BULLET BALLET, both impulses are one and the same:
the seduction of destruction is also the appeal of annihilation.  There is
an astonishing scene in which Chisato stands on tip-toe on the brink of a
subway platform, balancing on outstretched arms, as a subway train flashes
by.  One twitch, and she's dead.  She won't throw herself in front of the
moving train, but she'll come as close as she can.  She, aimless and
disaffected like all the characters, both perpetrates violence and courts
death until the two become inextricable, until it's hard to tell the dancer
from the dance.</P>
<P>        BULLET BALLET, then, is a movie about violence as a vicious cycle,
as a state of mind, as a manifestation of anger against the world and
hatred of the self, which feeds on its own energy.  Tsukamoto pulls out all
the stops, using jump cuts, freeze frames, fade outs, slow motion, and,
most impressively, an inspired use of ambient sound, to sustain a vision of
violence as both appealing and appalling.  It's all shot with a hand-held
camera in harsh black and white which transforms the mundane into the
evocative: sun and shadow pass over a Tokyo high-rise rooftop in the rain
like a fleeting glimpse of God; an insect crawls across a dead man's face
like the embodiment of Death.</P>
<P>        In addition to writing and directing, Tsukamoto shot and edited and
designed the movie, and he deserves much credit--BULLET BALLET isn't
notably coherent or profound, but damn if it doesn't look cool.  As in Wong
Kar-wai's best work, the hectic disjointed rhythms, the unconventional
pacing, and the incongruous flashes of humour mimic the fractured frenetic
experience of contemporary urban life; the film speaks to us in the
language of our time.</P>
<P>        You would think that Tsukamoto's fellow Japanese Beat Takeshi's
work had given us the last word on violence as vicious cycle, especially in
his VIOLENT COP, but BULLET BALLET is even more extreme in its
aestheticization--and fetishization--of violence.  In Takeshi's films
violence is expressed as a transient disruption of the Taoist still centre
which the characters inhabit most of the time, and to which they inevitably
return after momentary frenzies of action.  The ultimate still centre is of
course death--which is where most of Takeshi's characters end up.  In
BULLET BALLET, however, there is no centre; the characters live on the
margins where hurt and risk and degradation are ever-present.  Violence is
a modus operandi, and its allure is simple: it keeps people too busy to
think or reflect.  For everyone in this film who has or wants a gun,
reflection seems worse than the threat of death.</P>
