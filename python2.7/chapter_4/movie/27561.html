GEORGE WASHINGTON
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>Let's start by clearing up one point.  First-time writer/director David 
Gordon Green's GEORGE WASHINGTON is not about the father of our country.  
In fact, the movie isn't about much of anything, which you will find out 
if you can manage to stay awake.  With its minimal plot and acting, 
there aren't any characters worth caring much about even though the 
director tries hard to pull on our heart-strings with some contrived 
tragedies.  Although one can assume that the production had a written 
script, it feels like something from a junior college improvisational 
group.   </P>
<P>Set in a graffiti-filled, rural South that looks like an inner city 
ghetto, the story wants badly to be the next STAND BY ME.  As the 
story's enigmatic lead, 12-year-old George, Donald Holden delivers an 
exceptionally bland performance.  George has a baby-like head, so he 
wears a football helmet since an accidental blow to the head might kill 
him.  </P>
<P>The central and only substantial incident occurs in a bathroom where one 
of the kids slips and cracks his skull during some innocent horseplay.  
Incongruously, the other kids just stare at him.  They don't appear 
upset, and they don't take him for medical help.  Eventually, they 
decide to move the dead body but do a terrible job of hiding it.  This 
is all so unbelievably written and acted that it is almost impossible to 
have much sympathy or concern for the kids, even the dead one.  Watching 
it is like observing some little children play acting on the street.</P>
<P>The movie's saving grace, to the extent that it has one, is Tim Orr's 
vibrant, rust-colored cinematography.  At its best, it evokes the lush 
sort of images found in THE THIN RED LINE.</P>
<P>Declining an offer to come to a girl's house, George tells her, "I just 
ain't got nothing to say."  And neither does the movie.  </P>
<P>GEORGE WASHINGTON runs a long 1:29.  It is not rated but might be PG-13 
for mature themes and violent images and would be acceptable for 
teenagers.</P>
