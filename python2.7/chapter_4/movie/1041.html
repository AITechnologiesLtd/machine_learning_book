<PRE>                               THE ROCKETEER
                       A film review by Laurie Mann
                        Copyright 1991 Laurie Mann</PRE>
<P>     I dragged my husband and child off the the sneak preview of THE
ROCKETEER on Saturday, and I was very glad I did (even though I didn't
get a commemorative button).</P>
<P>     THE ROCKETEER is sort of a slower-moving Indy Jones movie with time
for a little character development and things like that.  The action
scenes are superb, and the performances are good.  And there are so many
little extras in this movie, I'm not sure where to begin.</P>
<P>     There's a thug in this movie who's the living image of Rondo
Hatton, a character actor who always played thugs in 1940s B-movies.  The
movie has much of the structure of a 1930s or 1940s movie, with heroic
heroes, villainous villains, an over-interest in the doings of
Hollywood, and a fancy restaurant scene with singing and dancing.  There
are "appearances" by folks like Clark Gable, W. C. Fields, Howard Hughes,
and other characters of the era.  Timothy Dalton gives a perfect
performance as an Errol Flynn-like actor with a penchant for over-acting.
And Jennifer Connelly has matured significantly since she played the
Dorothy-like character in LABYRINTH.</P>
<P>     This movie is solid and extremely enjoyable.  While there's some
sexual innuendo in the movie and some character endangerment,  I think
most kids over about 7 would like it (I think it's rated PG).  It was
also a pleasure to see Alan Arkin in a film---where the hell has he been
lately???  The lead actor is amiable enough as the Rocketeer, but I
can't say he gave the sort of performance that Harrison Ford did in the
Indy movies.  While he maybe could have used a charisma transplant, he
was okay.  (Besides, if we still need charisma, we can go see Kevin
Costner this weekend!!)</P>
<P>     I disagree strongly with the earlier poster who compared this film
to BATMAN (and the poster didn't like BATMAN either).  BATMAN was a film
where style triumphed over all.  THE ROCKETEER never quite lets style
overtake a very compressed story.</P>
<PRE>     The ending is loads of fun.  Seriously.</PRE>
<P>     This is a solid 7 on the Chuck scale.  Absolutely worth your time,
and a movie you can take your kids to (even if they did have a preview
of TERMINATOR II which featured full sidal nudity of Arne!)</P>
