<PRE>"NOW What?!"</PRE>
<P>This becomes the catch-phrase for John Finnegan in DEEP RISING, a movie
that starts off like kinda like SPEED 2, turns into a poor rip-off of
ALIENS/ALIEN RESURRECTION, and in the last 15 minutes, actually becomes
semi-original, leading up to a final ten seconds (yes, SECONDS) of film
before the credits roll that I think are gonna be pretty memorable for
me.  </P>
<P>Okay.  There's a cruise ship that's attacked by a big beast thing.  And
there's this group of bandits on their way to do... something (but we're
not supposed to know what) to said cruise ship.  Of course, when they
get there, they find the place mostly devoid of people, and why?  Some
kind of big squid thing, of course.  Add to that the fact that their own
boat is too damaged to be seaworthy, and you've got yourself an ALIEN
movie ripoff.</P>
<P>And what a ripoff it is!  I mean, they seem to try to take the
underwater scene from ALIEN RESURRECTION, make it as devoid of momentum
as possible, and slap the remainder of the copy into this movie. 
There's even a scene where exact dialogue from ALIENS is slapped into
the show just for kicks.  Yes, exact lines.  It's annoying on some
level, but wait a second...</P>
<P>...is this a spoof?  With such intentional ripoff signs, and the fact
that this movie sure as hell isn't scary at all, floating around in the
mist, I'd be inclined to say... maybe.  If so, and if viewed as such,
this is a funny flick.  Only bout **1/2 to *** star level, though,
because it doesn't quite take it far enough.  But it's still a good
satire.  But if viewed as another one of these traditional
monster-in-enclosed-space flicks, then, it ain't that hot.  *1/2 star
kinda movie.</P>
<P>Either way, the acting is alright (Treat Williams is always a likable
guy, and O'Connor is loads of fun, too), the evil CGI tentacles look
cool (but the big head thing didn't quite measure up), and the final
chase scene is actually worthy of... well, a better movie.</P>
<P>For me, the final moment of the film was just hilarious.  The rest of
the audience didn't seem to think so.  But for me, those final seconds
add about another 1/2 star to this baby.  I won't forget those ten
seconds anytime soon.</P>
<P>Overall, what do I give this, this exercise in
what-kind-of-movie-am-I-watching?  Well, I'm going to go ahead and give
it a medium rating of **1/2.  You'll have the most fun if your view as a
spoof of the ALIEN movies and their numerous ripoffs rather than a
serious monster flick.  But you'd certainly still be better off heading
down to the dollar theater to check out ALIEN RESURRECTION again, or
shelling out the bucks for another three glorious hours of TITANIC. 
Still, if you're in the mood for something else, sit back and... well,
just look at those darn cool tentacles.  Wait, there's a mouth inside of
another mouth on that thing there... uh... where have I seen that
before?</P>
<PRE>RATING: **1/2</PRE>
