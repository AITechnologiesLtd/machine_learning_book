<PRE>"Unbreakable" -- A Gripping, Heroic Tale
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>Imagine that Santa has left for your child a
beautifully wrapped toy on Christmas Day.  While Santa
knows that it's one of those high-tech mechanical
dogs, several layers of wrapping paper are used to
help hide its secret.  As the little one tears away at
the paper, what was first a formless mass is now
starting to take shape.  The child's eyes glow with
anticipation as the truth nears.  Finally, the payoff
arrives, and the little tyke lets forth a wide smile
knowing that it was all worth the effort.</P>
<P>This is the sensation that you might feel as you watch
"Unbreakable," an engrossing tale about an ordinary
man who experiences extraordinary events.  But why
does this happen?  The answer, wrapped in mystery, is
something that needs to be unraveled, uncovered and
understood.</P>
<P>"Why are you looking at me like that," asks the
bewildered David Dunn (Bruce Willis).  He's visibly
confused as he peers around the hospital's emergency
room where he has been recently taken after another
one of those extraordinary events.  The doctor answers
slowly, with a soft-spoken voice that connotes mixed
feelings of curiosity and wonderment.  "Your train
derailed," he begins to tell him.  "And to answer your
question, there are two reasons why I'm looking at you
this way."  It seems that Dunn is the only survivor of
a horrific (off-screen) train crash in which 131 other
lives were lost.  Moreover, there wasn't a scratch on
his entire body.  Although most of the train cars were
badly mangled, Dunn escaped unscathed.</P>
<P>This event raises many questions.  Is he just lucky? 
Perhaps he's blessed.  Maybe it's something more.  But
whatever the mystical reason may be for his good
fortune, it's an answer that begs to be revealed.  As
our hero begins his search for meaning, the audience
eagerly and anxiously follows him every step of the
way.  The only thing that he does know, however, is
that a stranger named Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson)
seems to know a lot about him.  Elijah asks Dunn if
he's ever been hurt, the last time he got sick, and
his reason for choosing his career.  Most of all, he
asks Dunn to reassess his life in order to understand
the truth.</P>
<P>>From the Oscar-nominated talent that gave us "The
Sixth Sense," writer/director M. Night Shyamalan,
"Unbreakable" is a hauntingly good yarn.  What makes
this film atypical of most other films is its inspired
belief in itself and its adroitness in taking us into
an alternative universe.  It's almost like watching
reality shift in front of our eyes as Dunn and the
audience are challenged to negotiate through this
labyrinth layered with hints and revelations.  This
transformation happens slowly, however, so don't
expect a quick-paced film.  Meanwhile, dialogue is
spoken in a hushed tone that causes the audience to
strain to hear what they are saying.  I was fascinated
and found it gripping, but this might be maddening for
others.  Ultimately, like the doctor that examines
Dunn in the emergency room after that train wreck,
you'll likely feel that same sense of curiosity and
wonderment.</P>
