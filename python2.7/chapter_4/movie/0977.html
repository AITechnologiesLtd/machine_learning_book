<PRE>                                   WARLOCK
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1991 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  Three years after the coming
     attractions ran, WARLOCK is finally getting a release, albeit
     spotty.  A prestigious producer, a good director, and a
     distinguished cast turn out a good drive-in horror movie made
     with care and imagination.  The one flaw is a rather obvious
     borrowing from the plot of TERMINATOR.  Rating: low +2 (-4 to
     +4).</P>
<P>     One of the odd mysteries of cinema of late has been "whatever happened
to WARLOCK?"  Three years ago there were coming attractions that promised a
horror film with a  nice look.  From what we saw it could have been decent
or it could have been another special effects and gore film.  But for three
years it did not seem to get released either to theaters or to cassette.
Finally, in 1991, the film is getting a spotty, here-and-there release and
while nothing great, it is certainly closer to my best hopes than to my
worst fears.  Only on reading material about the film afterwards do I
discover that the film had a pedigree that should have raised my
expectations--perhaps to the point that I would have been disappointed when
I actually saw the film.  It is produced by Arnold Kopelson, who also
produced PLATOON.  It is directed by Steve Miner, whose HOUSE did have some
good moments.  It stars Julian Sands of A ROOM WITH A VIEW and Richard Grant
of WITHNAIL AND I.  The film has a very nice look.  It is clear this was not
intended to be a film dominated by special effects.  There is a little gore,
about the amount you might find in a Hammer Films horror piece of the early
1960s.  Most of the other effects are nicely orchestrated, and occasionally
done with the subtlety to leave the viewer not quote sure what has just been
seen.</P>
<P>     The worst touch is that the basic plot is very similar to TERMINATOR.
The film opens near Boston, Massachusetts, in the year 1691.  A rather
unappealing witchfinder, Giles Redferne (played by Richard Grant) has
sentenced to death a rather charismatic sorcerer (played by Julian Sands).
Our warlock escapes with a spell that catapults both him and the witchfinder
into modern-day Los Angeles.  There the warlock begins a mission to re-unite
three separated sections of the Devil's Grimoire.  When brought together
they will tell the warlock God's most secret name.  (This aspect sounds more
as if it came from the Kaballah than from 17th Century European tradition.)
Reciting that name backwards will uncreate the world which then presumably
Satan can recreate by his rules.  The warlock kills one of the two
housemates who care for him after a somewhat rocky arrival.  The other
housemate he curses.  Each morning she will find herself aged twenty years
over the day before.  This rapidly aging woman (played by Lori Singer) and
the witchfinder set out to find and stop the warlock.</P>
<P>     This is an oddly sexless film and that works in its favor.  The plot is
never stopped nor is its mood sabotaged for gratuitous scenes of
titillation.  Nor is the film padded out with long chase scenes.  The film
is 102 minutes long because there was just about 102 minutes of story to
tell.  Most of those 102 minutes show some imagination.  Don't get me wrong:
WARLOCK is a drive-in sort of movie, not great cinema.  It is not a ground-
breaker even as a horror film.  It is a drive-in movie that delivers the
goods just about every moment it is on the screen.  I give it a low +2 on
the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
