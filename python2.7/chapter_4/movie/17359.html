<PRE>RAVENOUS (1999)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1999 Ted Prigge</PRE>

Writer: Ted Griffin
Starring: Guy Pearce, Robert Carlyle, Jeffrey Jones, Jeremy Davies,
Stephen Spinella, Neal McDonough, Sheila Tousey, David Arquette, Joseph
Runningfox, John Spencer</P>
<P>It's been a good long while since we had a really good horror film, not
merely one that's scary, but one that puts atmosphere before plot, that
replaces cheap special effects with more draw to earthly elements, and
that is totally and truly original.  Of course, 'Ravenous' isn't all
original: it's more like a suspenseful twist on the Donnor Party or
'Alive.'  'Ravenous' may even be a twist on the more traditional vampire
flick, with a villain who's seemingly unstoppable, suave, and lovable,
and a general air of men sinking their teeth into other men and finding
strength.  Sounds all 'Interview With the Vampire'-esque to me, but
'Ravenous' is pretty much all about shocking you, not with gore or
tension, but with originality and a bucketload of terrific atmosphere.
Pretty much everything about 'Ravenous' screams unique, from the
incredibly bizzaro score by Michael Nyman and Damon Albarn
(incidentally, two of my favorite musicians, the latter who has a new
album with his band Blur coming out in a few short days) and, my
favorite aspect, a tone which is so off-the-wall unplaceable that just
explaining it sends me into streams of gibberish.  It's not exactly
darkly comic, and it's not exactly camp, but it's really funny and still
really disturbing and gory and freakish and, well, I can't put a finger
on it.  The opening, especially, caught me off guard, even before the
first shot.  The screen pops up with a traditional quote from Nietzsche
(the one about if you fight monster you may become him...), then you
hear an arrow shot on the soundtrack and hit its mark, and suddenly
another quote has popped up: '"Eat me." - Anonymous.'</P>
<P>We quickly meet our faithful protagonist, Capt. John Boyd (Guy Pearce),
an accidental hero during the Mexican-American War being awarded a medal
for capturing a fort, but in flashback, we see that after all, he was
basically a big fat coward, who, like I probably would, plays dead in
the middle of a key battle.  A flashback occurs during the ceremony when
he stares at the big juicy steak put in front of him (teeming with
blood), showing us how he was buried under a pile of corpses, and when
blood dripped into his mouth, he was able to regain his strength and
single-handedly capture the fort.  Due to nausea and whatnot, the
commanding officer unveils his cowardice, and awards him third in
command of a post way out in northern California, in the middle of
nowhere.  There he meets the usual motley crew: nervous priest Toffler
(Jeremy Davies), drunken second-in-command Knox (Stephen Spinella),
anal-retentive soldier Reich (Neal McDonnough), peyote-loving cook
Cleaves (David Arquette), two helpful native Americans (Sheila Tousey
and Joseph Runningfox), and droll C.O. Hart (Jeffrey Jones).</P>
<P>Mundanity plagues the post until one night when a mysterious man named
Colqhoun (Robert Carlyle) stumbles into the area, freezing, starving,
and unconscious.  They nurse him back to health, and he relays his
story: he was part of a trip to settle out in the west that got derailed
due to a snow storm and had to take refuge in a cave.  There, they ran
out of food, and one by one, they started dying off, at which point they
ate the dead.  Hart, hearing that Colqhoun fled for fear that one of the
two remaining people would kill him and eat him too, suggests that some
of them take the three day hike up to the cave and investigate.  From
here, there are frightening revelations, numerous twists, and soon the
film has turned into a gory, intense thriller, with frightening acts
befalling several of the characters, and then a major twist that is
there basically to keep the story going.  Much of it is clichéd, and a
lot of it is unbelievable (especially when one key character returns
unexpectedly), but what keeps this film afloat is the way it has been
crafted.  On paper, it'd look lame and underthought, and standing back
from it, and looking at each twist that occurs and everything that
happens, it's easy to see how this film could use a little bit more work
on the script and idea level.</P>
<P>But it's easy to ignore all that when it's right there in front of you
because what is most memorable about this film anyway is not the twists
and turns and contrivances of the plot, but the freakin' tone, which is
so unnerving and strange that I can hardly believe that a major studio
has released this wide, hoping it'll make a bit of kickback.  I doubt it
will; it's so weird that during the screening I attended, I was
surprised surprised surprised that there weren't a whole bunch of
walkouts.  'Ravenous' is strange, and people usually don't like strange,
but maybe this film has a unique pull that makes it completely
absorbing.  I liked how it dealt with a Native American myth (that by
eating flesh, one absorbs that person's energy and lifeblood) but never
took it way too seriously, like a lot of films do (no chants and the
peyote smoking is kept comical, thank you David Arquette).  I liked the
way it's structured, it allows there to be layer after layer after layer
of mystery, making sure we never totally know what's going on and are
shocked by every twist.  And despite a somewhat boring lead character
(Pearce needs to get out of the silent quasi-noble types department he's
been in in this and in 'L.A. Confidential' before he gets in a rut),
everyone else is pretty much interesting, if not a bit baffling (I just
couldn't figure out Davies' character).  And there's good acting too,
especially from Caryle, who uses his trademark zeal to really ham it up
and demonstrate that he's one of the best up-and-coming actors right
about now; and there's a great performance from Jeffrey Jones, showing
us what an ingenious supporting player he can be, breathing life into
what could have been an otherwise dull character with a couple nice
lines (again, just love this guy).</P>
<P>But as much of a blast as it is to watch, this film just doesn't know
how to reach several of its conclusions throughout: its finale, notably,
is extraordinarily anticlimactic, if not drolly stretched out and nicely
gory.  And throughout, even with the clichés, I was flabbergasted by how
much they took the opening Nietzsche quote so literally, so much that
placing it at the beginning seems coyly campy.  Yet this film, despite
its obvious and numerous flaws, is really entertaining.  Antonia Bird,
the director who stepped in when its original director was removed
shortly into shooting, finds exactly the right tone for the film from
the get-go, carries through with it, and makes 'Ravenous' several times
better than it would have been, all while crafting everything to be
devilishly unique and clever, from the performances to the
cinematography.  She even knows how to set up a shot so that it's at
once interesting to look at and completely surprising in its
revelations.  In fact, 'Ravenous' may be the extreme example of a film
saved by the correct application of atmosphere: its more mundane scenes,
like flashbacks and gory bits of business, are saved by the tone, which
give it a fresh, idiosyncratic feeling.</P>
<P>In fact, I'm nearly willing to ignore all the lousy parts of the film
and merely state that this film is a rather excellent movie going
experience: tense, captivating, original, moody, and abashedly
entertaining.  For every distracting cliché, there's a totally
wonderful, free-spirited, and witty moment, like the one where a
visiting general (John Spencer) discovers a pot o' stew and tastes it,
though only we know what's really in there.  For every lousy moment
involving plot explanation or Native American mysticism explained over
and over again, there's a great scene like the one where two cannibals
try to seduce another one into their flock by robbing him of free will,
all while spouting witty one-liners and aphorisms by Benjamin Franklin.
And because of its tone, its sense of humor, and its general air of
moody atmosphere, it's easy to brush off the more lame aspects of the
film into the back corners of your membrane, and enjoy what's there on
the screen.  It's fun to watch a film that would otherwise be bad, that
has a pretty terrible trailer that makes it looks like dung, and
discover that it actually has a streak of originality and wit that
allows to rise above what it could potentially be.  Now, wouldn't it be
nice if there was a film that took this farther, and was a surprise
masterpiece despite the premonitions surrounding it?</P>
