<P>Logical time travel movies are a near-impossibility. Considering that
the skeptic's best argument against the possibility of time travel is
the idea of altered realities, writing a script that deals with this
problem is an imposing task. Occasionally, we get a film that does
manage it. Terry Gilliam's "12 Monkeys" was one such film. But more
frequently, we get films that don't much deal with it at all. There is
one question to ask in this case: Does the film have other virtues
that override the existing logical inconsistencies? The "Terminator"
films made up for them with exciting action, "Back to the Future" did
it with an entertaining story, and the new film "Frequency" pulls off
the trick with a strong package of its own.  Is "Frequency" filled
with plot holes? Yes. Does it matter? Not really.</P>
<P>The film opens in October of 1969. Firefighter Frank Sullivan (Dennis
Quaid) puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job,
then goes home to his loving wife Julia (Elizabeth Mitchell) and son
Johnny (Daniel Henson). The double-pronged story flashes forward to
1999, where Johnny (now Jim Caviezel) is all grown up and working as a
police detective. A strange occurrence -- the appearance of aurora
borealis over New York City -- allows father and son to communicate
through the same ham radio Frank used in '69 and that John has found
in the present day. Though both are initially skeptical of the idea,
John eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his
impending death in a warehouse fire, and he succeeds in saving Frank
from certain doom. Now flooded with memories of a full life with his
father alive, John is initially overjoyed, until he discovers that the
changes to the timeline have been disastrous: A serial killer that
would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women. Frank and
John now must work together to set things right, with John using the
information he has gathered in the future to instruct Frank on what to
do in the past.</P>
<P>The premise of "Frequency" is unusual, and requires getting over one
very important mental hurdle to fully accept: John and Frank are the
only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result
of their actions.  This isn't explained; you just have to go with
it. When Frank doesn't die in a fire, John is the only one who
remembers it differently, while everyone else remembers it the new
way. The concept also runs into problems concerning just how
synchronous the two realities -- 1969 and 1999 -- are to each
other. Sometimes Frank's changing the past results in something
happening right away in John's world, and sometimes John gets the
changes ahead of time. Now, the filmmakers might have perfectly good
explanations for this, and I could probably come up with something
fairly convoluted (but nevertheless logical) if I thought about it
hard enough (for example, the reason John gets advance information of
the serial killer's murders was because the change had already
happened in Frank's world, and John is only witnessing the
*projection* of that change), but explanations aren't really the
point. When "Frequency" gets cooking, it's a riveting little thriller,
even if it is confusing. What matters to a film like this is if the
plot makes sense in the moment, and "Frequency" works as long as it
keeps moving.</P>
<P>The film manages to be engaging despite the logical
confusion. Director Gregory Hoblit and screenwriter Toby Emmerich
structure "Frequency" as good Hollywood entertainment, establishing
decent, likable characters, making us care for them, and setting up a
goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved. I liked many of the
creative touches: the split screens, allowing us to see how the
universe is being affected in both realities, and the greater
framework of baseball to drive the action forward. It actually uses
the 1969 Mets-Orioles World Series (the one that featured the Amazin'
Mets) to great effect -- Frank uses John's advance knowledge of the
Series outcome to convince his friends to believe him. (Admittedly,
this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself.) I
even liked the final scene, which features Frank and John both
fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods. Some
may find this scene blindingly confusing, as the reality shifts start
coming fast and furious, but it does make sense if you think about it
(and give the script a lot of leeway), and let's face it: It's a darn
cool way to end the film. There are enough surprises and plot twists
in "Frequency" to keep you on your toes, and as a result the movie
avoids growing stagnant.</P>
<P>The other major thing to appreciate about "Frequency" is the handling
of the father-son relationship. Quaid and Caviezel carry off their
parts easily; it's a rock-solid job from both actors. The relationship
is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the
high concept: How would one react to being able to communicate with a
dead relative, or with a future descendant? Watching the exchanges
between Frank and John will give you a pretty good idea of how to
answer that question. The credibility of the human relationship is
absolutely crucial to the rest of the film; if we don't believe in the
characters, we don't care about the outcome of the thriller
plot. Here, we do care, because we like the lead actors. I also liked
some of the supporting cast members. Elizabeth Mitchell gets stuck
with two thankless roles, playing Julia the doting wife *and* mother,
but still performs admirably. Andre Braugher, late of the television
show "Homicide: Life on the Street," gives a nice supporting turn as
Frank's best friend and future colleague of John. He has a lovely
scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to Julia
while Frank's World Series predictions come true before his very
eyes. Braugher strikes the perfect facial expression here,
simultaneously dismayed and amused.</P>
<P>Perhaps the only thing I didn't like about "Frequency" is the overly
sentimental coda, during which the camera's focus goes a little too
soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard. But that's only
because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to
cheap tactics. I freely acknowledge that "Frequency" may best work as
a "guy" movie, since it focuses on the very male-oriented idea of
father-son relationships (echoes of "Field of Dreams" can be easily
heard), but the underlying concept is universally applicable. Who
wouldn't want to speak with a long-dead parent?  Or see how their
children turn out? "Tell me about your life, son" -- excuse me while I
mist up. And don't call me a sissy.</P>
