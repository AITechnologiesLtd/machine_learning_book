<PRE>A film review by Michael Redman
Copyright 2000 by Michael Redman</PRE>
<P>Certain things in our lives are inevitable. Death, sorrow, love, heartbreak,
pain, joy. We expect these events. We know they're going to happen and some,
we even look forward to. It's part of the human condition.</P>
<P>We have also become accustomed to inevitable occurrences in our society. As
we near the fall election, several of them are hitting us in the face.
Politicians exaggerate their own importance. Our side is always right;
theirs is always wrong. In the end, voters are usually forced to choose the
lesser of two whocares.</P>
<P>In Hollywood the one indisputable inevitable is that if a film makes big
money, there will be a sequel. Even if the original story doesn't merit one.
Even if the first film is complete in itself. Even if success is a fluke.</P>
<P>"The Blair Witch Project" was made with a budget of $1.75 and exploded on
the screen, raking in huge profits. The concept was brilliant. The
filmmakers created a remarkable buzz that the story might be real. The film
itself was even more convincing. The movie _must_ be authentic. Why else
would such amateurish footage be on the big screen?</P>
<P>The first film caught lightning in a bottle. The sequel proves you can't
pour that old lightning into a new bottle.</P>
<P>You have to give this effort some credit. It would have been easy to have
made the same movie again with a new group of kids. It would have been easy,
but of course, it wouldn't have worked.</P>
<P>Instead "Book Of Shadows" acknowledges the first film as a movie and
concentrates on the hysteria following its release. It's a great scheme and
possibly the only entertaining way to do a sequel.</P>
<P>Unfortunately it doesn't work either.</P>
<P>Five kids spend the night in the woods at the scene of the first film. Weird
stuff happens and they retreat to an old factory where one of them lives.
Even weirder stuff happens. Some people die, there's blood and knives and
none of the characters have a lick of common sense.</P>
<P>While supposedly doing serious research, the group sets up a circle of
surveillance cameras in the ruins of the old house in the woods and vows to
stay alert all night awaiting a visitation. Then they proceed to get totally
trashed on drugs and alcohol and party down with very loud, very obnoxious
heavy metal music. It's a bad plan.</P>
<P>The cast shows some early promise. A couple is doing research on a "Blair
Witch" book. The tour guide is a former mental patient turned ebay
aficionado. A Goth amazon princess adds a bit of comedic relief. The
obligatory hot babe is the 2000 spiritual cinematic descendent of the cute
hippie chick, the cute rock and roll chick and the cute disco chick: the
cute Wiccan chick.</P>
<P>The first film's unaccomplished actors came across as real people in a real
situation because hours and hours of video were shot during days in the
woods. This time, these unaccomplished actors just come across as
unaccomplished actors. There's not one character you care about when they
start shouting for no reason.</P>
<P>Although what passes for a plot starts out with a solid idea, it's ruined by
poor execution. The follow-up to one of the most successful horror films
ever is nothing more than a bad slasher movie. They're trapped in an old big
weird house. They stupidly separate into various rooms. There are strange
noises, they see scary apparitions and people disappear. Ever see this movie?</P>
<P>Seasoned documentary director Joe Berlinger should know better. The film
features mostly cheap tricks and unnecessary gore. For a storyline filled
with surprises, it's oddly predicable.</P>
<P>"The Blair Witch Project" was a rare triumph of style over substance. "The
Book Of Shadows" is a triumph of tedium over promise.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman has written this column for over 25 years. For the first
time during that period, he's going to vote for someone who might make a
good President. But he'll have to use a pencil to do it. Send vapid
political commentary to <A HREF="mailto:redman@bluemarble.net.">redman@bluemarble.net.</A>)</P>
