<P>     I have to give this to MEET WALLY SPARKS:  if you've ever seen Rodney
Dangerfield before, you're going to get exactly what you expect, and if
you've never seen Rodney Dangerfield before, you have no business being in
the theater.  Dangerfield isn't an actor; he isn't even a personality.  He
is a persona, a leering 70-year-old adolescent who has parlayed not
getting any respect into a career most entertainers would envy.  The irony
in the Dangerfield persona is that he has in fact gained respect, or at
least appreciation, from a generation of young comedians.  MEET WALLY
SPARKS turns out not to be simply a vehicle for Dangerfield to do his
schtick, but a great big tribute in his honor, a dopey but almost reverent
celebration of Rodney at his Rodney-est.</P>
<P>     Dangerfield plays Wally Sparks, the host of a tabloid talk show which
has developed a reputation for being the sleaziest example of a sleazy
genre.  When one advertiser too many pulls out of Wally's show, the
network's president (Burt Reynolds) threatens to give Wally the ax.  Wally
and his producer Sandy (Debi Mazar) plead for a chance to clean the show
up, and it is with that goal in mind that they head to Atlanta for a
chance to meet with conservative Georgia governor Floyd Preston (David
Ogden Stiers) at a fund-raiser for the governor's Senate campaign.  When
Wally is injured in an incident at the party, he feigns being unable to
walk so that he can televise from the governor's mansion and try to get an
interview with the governor.  While the governor and his wife (Cindy
Williams) try to maintain order, Wally turns the house upside down, even
as he helps bring the governor's poll numbers up.</P>
<P>     MEET WALLY SPARKS is an extremely busy movie, which is not the same
as saying that a lot happens.  Even the most die-hard Dangerfield fan must
admit that a little bit of Rodney goes a long way, and the script seems
almost desperate to provide sub-plots which will allow the star to take a
breather.  There is a tangent involving an attempt to blackmail the
governor, a tangent involving a network toadie (Eamonn Roche) who wants
to sink Wally, a romance between Wally's son (Michael Weatherly) and the
governor's daughter (Lisa Thornhill), and sentimental musings about being
a good father on the part of both Wally and the governor.  There really
isn't any point to any of it, except to pad the running time, and at 106
minutes it certainly feels padded.  When it all wraps up -- with a
wedding, no less -- there are going to be a lot of numb buttocks in the
theater.</P>
<P>     I'm not really sure why the even bothered with a plot at all, since
it's all about Rodney.  The 25 minutes which take place at the governor's
fund-raiser set the tone, as Wally wanders through high society like an
even more lecherous Groucho Marx, a walking punch line in search of a
straight line to a gag about sexual potency, sexual frequency, sexual
organs or just good old-fashioned sex.  It is so obvious Rodney's world
that it is almost a shock when anyone else gets a joke (the pratfalls to
which Stiers, Roche and others are subjected notwithstanding).  The rest
of the cast is around to set 'em up, then get out of the way while Rodney
knocks 'em down.</P>
<P>     Or at least taps them over.  There are a couple of genuinely funny
bits in MEET WALLY SPARKS -- in one, Wally inadvertently breaks the
genitalia off a male nude statue, then does a very bad job of hiding it in
his pocket -- but this isn't a film built around comedic creativity.  On
the contrary, it is a tribute to comedic venerability, like a Henny
Youngman performance with half the audience providing the obvious and
familiar double entendre before Rodney can.  The film is so self-aware on
that point that Wally's son gets one scene in which _he_ anticipates the
joke and mouths the punch line.  It's all terribly dumb and predictable,
but it doesn't matter to anyone involved because this is less a Rodney
Dangerfield film than "Rodney Dangerfield: This Is Your Life," with a host
of guest stars turning up to honor the star:  Jay Leno, Roseanne, Tim
Allen, Bob Saget.  Tony Danza and Michael Bolton even turn up to do
Dangerfield impressions, and if you think you've seen it all, you haven't
until you've seen Michael Bolton do Dangerfield.  MEET WALLY SPARKS is
likely to be a snooze to anyone who is not arriving similarly to worship
at the altar of Rodney.  It is a strange experience watching a movie where
everyone in the film, perhaps hoping for Dangerfield's personal
benediction of "Hey, kid, you're all right," seems more interested in
entertaining the star than in entertaining the audience.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Dangerfield zones:  4.</PRE>
