   Small towns and suburbs with lots of land may be ideal
places for raising little kids, but teenagers and the sticks do
not mix well.  Just look at Bruno Dumont's slow-paced "La Vie
de Jesus," so named because he considers it a sort of
passion play, about the suffering of a small group of 20-year-
olds in the Flemish town of Baileul in Northern France. 
They're not really bad boys.  When they make racist remarks
in the presence of an Arab family they're just playing, though
they're too immature to realize the extent to which their
razzing is harmful.  But they feel compassion and when they
make mistakes like dissing members of another ethnic group,
well, they feel sorry for it.  This is particularly true of one of
the gang of young people Michou (Samuel Boidin) who has
just lost a brother to AIDS and guards the body of the poor
fellow together with his empathetic pals.  It is likewise
legitimate to feel for the central individual, the unemployed,
poorly educated Freddy (David Douche), who expresses
genuine sympathy for Michou and who, together with the
others, takes the young man out for a day at the beach to
help him to mourn.
   There's quite a difference between the way Hollywood
portrays the boredom of small-town lie and the way the
French do it.  Oliver Stone in "U-Turn" shows the people of
the miserable white-trash burg of Superior, Arizona, to be
thoroughly off-the-wall, from a conniving, weird-looking and
unrecognizable Billy Bob Thornton to the philosophy-spouting
blind Indian played by Jon Voight.  By contrast, Bruno
Dumont's sticks figures are anything but cartoonish: they're
the types of people you'd expect to find anywhere: listless,
jobless, on the dole, looking for kicks, playing around but with
an undercurrent of violence.
   After introducing us to Freddy's mother, Yvette, (Genvieve
Cottreel), who runs a small cafe of the type you'll find
throughout European villages, Dumont takes us to a core
relationship, that of Freddy and his girlfriend Marie (Marjorie
Cottreel), who works as a supermarket checker.  With little to
do during their spare time but ride around the motor scooter
which Freddy's mom bought him, Freddy and Marie spend
much of their energy lovemaking.  Marie even waits for
Freddy in his room, situated next door to Freddy's mom's--
who takes their liaison in a purely matter-of-fact way. 
Complicating the relationship, Freddy is subject to epileptic
fits, which his kind mother helps him to work through as do
his friends when he is assaulted by the disease on the road. 
He is also helped by the local hospital which has
sophisticated equipment for helping him to cope.  The tension
begins when Kader (Kader Chaatouf), a young Arab man, hits
on Freddy's girl, his advances at first repelled by Marie and
later welcomed quite openly.  When the fellas take note of
these developments, the stage is set for violence.
   Director Dumont pulls no punches.  He is what you might
call a Flemish nationalist, in love with the beauty of the
northern French landscape and determined to make the hard
bodies of his characters serve as metaphor for the silent land. 
The lovemaking is shown close-up as would the maker of a
hardcore porn film: his lovers have no time for foreplay but
simply go at it like the simple people they are.  Dumont
appears to want to convey emotion by closeups of the faces
and body language of his people rather than through
dialogue, which is spare--quite unusual for a maker of French
films which are notably talky.  He does not quite succeed in
playing off the soil of the region against the torsos of his lead
characters but he does get authentic acting from the people,
especially from David Douche--not a professional actor but
one chosen by the director from a hundred or so candidates
from the town of the director's birth.  
   For the most part these young people are going nowhere,
get their kicks from games of chicken pitting their motorbikes
against the cars passing through, expressing racist remarks
that they do not really feel.  "Flanders sends shivers up and
down my spine," the director recently reported in an interview,
but while his movie looks like the genuine article, a portrait of
the compassion and hostility of "the boys," "La Vie de Jesus"
makes a case neither as a parable for the sufferings of Jesus
on the cross nor for 96 minutes of audience quivers and
shudders. Not Rated.  Running Time: 96 minutes.  (C) 1997
