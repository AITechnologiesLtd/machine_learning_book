<P>In "An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn," a director demands final cut 
on his picture.  A studio head responds, "Nobody gets final cut except 
Spielberg and Kubrick!"  This is possibly the only time the names of these 
famous directors were mentioned in the same sentence before "A.I." linked 
them to the same project.  Stanley Kubrick worked for years on developing 
Brian Aldiss' "Supertoys Last All Summer Long" into a film.  Before his 
death, Kubrick passed the project on to Steven Spielberg.  Little probably 
remains of Kubrick in "A.I." except for the use of some of his production 
designs for Rouge City, where architecture is derived from the erotic female 
form, and in cinematographer Janusz Kaminski's use of natural light.  (Some 
of Kubrick's designs can be seen in the recent documentary "Stanley Kubrick: 
A Life in Pictures.")</P>
<P>The plot explores familiar science-fiction themes, particularly whether 
artificial intelligence (A.I.) constitutes human life.  The A.I. in question 
belongs to David (Haley Joel Osment), a prototype of a new kind of "mecha" 
(android) that is capable of love.  Up til now, mechas have only been able to 
simulate emotions, but Prof. Hobby (William Hurt) has created a 
child-surrogate who will genuinely love its owner/parent.  Enter Monica and 
Henry Swinton (Frances O'Connor and Sam Robards), whose son Martin (Jake 
Thomas) is in a coma.  Henry brings David home, and, after some initial 
reluctance, Monica initiates David's attachment programming.  However, Martin 
miraculously recovers and returns home.  Naturally, he resents his new 
brother and begins to needle David; David is unable to compete because he's 
programmed to be an ideal child and aspects like sibling rivalry and childish 
cruelty are not part of the package.</P>
<P>After an accident nearly drowns Martin, Monica decides to get rid of David.  
Once a mecha has attached itself to a parent, it cannot be reprogrammed and 
must be destroyed.  However, Monica cannot bring herself to take David back 
to his manufacturer to be melted down, so she releases him in the forest.  
Taking his cue from Pinocchio, David decides to seek out the Blue Fairy to 
turn him into a real boy so his mother will love him again.  As companions he 
has a mecha Teddy Bear (voice of Jack Angel) and a "love-mecha" named Gigolo 
Joe (Jude Law).  </P>
<P>The premise seems sick and sad.  Why would anyone create a child that never 
grows up?  Why would anyone want to love a child whose destiny is to be 
destroyed when its parent dies or becomes bored?  Kubrick specialized in 
"sick and sad," and he may have intended to explore these areas.  However, 
Spielberg seems too wrapped in the high-tech Pinocchio story to think about 
how twisted David's very existence is.</P>
<P>Something about science fiction brings out the sappiest side of Spielberg.  
His aliens in "Close Encounters" and "ET" are the warmest and fuzziest this 
side of Ewoks.  (But even Ewoks tried to eat the humans.)  The treacle of a 
robot's quest to be a real boy is only interesting because the goal seems 
impossible.  However, Spielberg seems unable to accept that.  There is a 
point where the movie seems to end, after David finds the Blue Fairy.  It's a 
good ending, a powerful ending, but a downer.  Spielberg seems unwilling to 
accept that, so the movie continues the story in the even more distant 
future.  </P>
<P>At the heart of the problem in "A.I." is probably Spielberg's father issues.  
He has a well-documented tendency to depict fathers as absent, reluctant, or 
distant.  This theme explains the otherwise bewildering fact that David is 
only programmed to bond with one parent.  David's "father" Henry seems 
irrelevant to David and to Spielberg, who uses Henry as a catalyst to 
introduce David to Monica, then pushes Henry aside.  As David's quest 
develops, he doesn't want to win a place in the family; instead, he wants to 
eliminate his father and brother and have his mother all to himself.  </P>
<P>Spielberg's greatest asset and greatest weakness as a filmmaker is that he 
is, at heart, a ten-year-old boy who never grew up.  This aspect of his 
personality gives his films a trademark sense of wonder that can be 
compelling.  But judging by the self-indulgent ending tacked onto this 
picture, the ten-year-old is still working on his Oedipal conflict.</P>
