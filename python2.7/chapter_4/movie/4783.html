<PRE>                             UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     If nothing else, UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL will remind you just how
hideous the hairstyles of the 1980's were, especially among media
personalities.  Fortunately, the film accomplishes a lot more than that,
giving us a nice romance that isn't harmed too much by its attempts at
melodrama.</P>
<P>     UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL tells the loosely-based-on-reality story of
Sally (who becomes Tally) Atwater (Michelle Pfeiffer), a vain upstart girl
from Reno who wants to make it big in television.  Robert Redford costars
as Warren Justice, a Miami news director who gives her her big break and
takes her under his wing.  Under his influence, Tally is transformed from
brash loudmouth to The Next Big Thing, and of course, the two fall madly
in love along the way.</P>
<P>     With a smart script enhanced by some excellent comic relief, Pfeiffer
and Redford work together with a good chemistry.  And while there are a
few substantial plot gaps as the film tries to do too much in too little
time, the exciting climax set in the midst a prison riot makes up for any
holes in the movie's continuity.</P>
<P>     Still, this isn't NETWORK, and at times UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL really
can't decide between being romantic comedy or a tough drama.  This
unfortunately creates some unevenness and a couple of false endings with a
tacked-on tearjerker finale.  The supporting cast is also uniformly bland,
with Joe Mantegna's talents totally wasted and both Kate Nelligan and
Stockard Channing looking very scary and beyond over-the-top as cutthroat
"I'm so tough I eat men for breakfast" newswomen.</P>
<P>     But there I go, nitpicking again.  Altogether, UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL
mostly works and only occasionally doesn't.  It will certainly be
successful as a pleasant spring romance flick with broad appeal, but most
importantly, it's a whole lot of fun.</P>
