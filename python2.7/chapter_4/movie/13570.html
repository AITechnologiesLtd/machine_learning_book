<P>There is a stunning scene in THE TRUMAN SHOW where Truman Burbank (Jim
Carrey, in a breakthrough dramatic role) attempts to have a serious
conversation with his wife Meryl (Laura Linney, who gives the role just the
right touch of icy hypocrisy). He tries desperately to communicate, but his
words do not dent the armor of her soul-numbing insincerity. As Truman
tries to tear down her seemingly impenetrable facade, she reacts in a
subtly horrifying, surreal manner--she suggests that Truman might like to
try a new product called Mococoa and launches into a sales pitch for it.
During her spiel, she holds up the product's package as if to an unseen
camera. Like the rest of the film, this scene is slick, smart, and superbly
realized, but Carrey's performance is what gives it its emotional core. His
face reflects just the right mix of dismay, anger, and disbelief, as he
slowly begins to understand that something is terribly wrong.</P>
<P>A rather similar scene a little later in the film also strikes a
particularly moving emotional chord. Truman and his best friend Marlon
(Noah Emmerich) spend an evening together, nursing a couple of beers while
sitting on the end of an unfinished bridge. Although it sounds like pure
paranoia, Truman tells Marlon, "Everybody seems to be in on it." But Marlon
looks Truman straight in the eye and says convincingly, "I'm not in on it,
Truman, because the last thing I would ever do is lie to you." However, it
turns out that in spite of Marlon's seeming sincerity, he is getting his
lines from an ear piece. At this moment, Truman does not yet know that
Marlon is an actor. Everything Marlon has ever said or done around Truman
all their lives has been a well-performed lie. I found this to be a
powerful, memorable scene, and it struck me as yet another hard-hitting
example of the tragic emotional toll on Truman as he slowly learns about
the artificial world surrounding him. No matter what he tries, Truman
cannot communicate with or get close to his family or friends because they
are not what they seem. In this scene, the sadness in Truman's eyes is only
a shadow of the devastation he will eventually feel when he realizes the
extent to which he has been cruelly deceived by those he loves and trusts.</P>
<P>For almost 30 years, Truman Burbank has been unaware that he is the star of
an uninterrupted, live television broadcast. It is the ultimate in reality
programming. In addition to being the longest running show in history, it
is also the most popular, with a devoted, world-wide audience. In fact,
some of his more ardent fans get a feeling of reassurance from keeping the
show on while Truman sleeps; but if his audience ever gave any thought to
Truman's exploitation, they would need more than a television night light
to keep their terror safe.</P>
<P>Without ever having committed a crime, Truman has been held captive his
entire life in a man-made world that is enclosed within a huge dome, a
structure so large that it can be seen from space. Within the dome is
Seahaven Island, which is actually a huge stage set. Except for Truman, all
Seahaven's citizens are actors. It is a created world with the
verisimilitude of reality, and seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day,
ingeniously concealed cameras broadcast every aspect of Truman's life to a
global village of vacuous voyeurs. In concept it is a cross between "Candid
Camera" and the omnipresent, all-seeing eye of Big Brother in George
Orwell's novel "1984."</P>
<P>I was particularly impressed with the satiric imagination that went into
the design of Seahaven; it is a safe and sanitized utopian dream, a
community seemingly conjured out of the plastic world of 1950s television
comedies. The feel of Seahaven is similar to walking into the world that
exists only within the frame of a Norman Rockwell illustration--a
heartwarming place where the smiles seldom waver. Yet, on closer
inspection, there is something unsettlingly saccharine and hollow about the
conspicuous absence of the gritty, untidy realities of life.</P>
<P>A chilling aspect of the story is that Truman was adopted before his birth,
not by surrogate parents, but by a corporation. Instead of being nurtured
by parental love, Truman has been treated his whole life as if he were a
commodity. Everything that surrounds him forms a matrix for product
promotion, and he is kept in a place that is little more than a picturesque
prison, while his free will is callously manipulated.</P>
<P>The puppet master pulling the strings of Truman's life is the television
show's creator and director Christof (well played by Ed Harris)--a man so
enraptured with his own creative vision that his arrogance and egotism make
him blind to the moral implications of Truman's plight. I found Christof to
be a brilliantly conceived and absolutely frightening character. The
control that Christof holds over Truman's life and world is almost
God-like--at one point he directs his crew to "Cue the sun!"-- but Cristof
is a faux-deity whose vanity makes his blood run very cold. He is even
cynical enough to go as far as to contrive events to instill fears in
Truman that will keep him from leaving Seahaven Island. For example, Truman
believes that when he was a small boy, he witnessed his father's drowning;
but in actuality what appeared to be the drowning was merely a staged
event, designed to make Truman fear the water.</P>
<P>At one point in the film, Christof makes a provocative statement: "We
accept the reality with which we're presented." Few people have the kind of
courage it takes to question the veracity of the world they are presented
with, but when there are too many disturbing incidents for Truman to
ignore, his faith in everything he has believed all his life begins to
unravel. His first clue that something is rotten in Seahaven is when a
stage light falls from the sky, nearly landing on top of him. Another time,
something goes awry with his car radio, and he hears actors getting their
instructions instead of the radio program that was on the air. On another
occasion Truman finds a homeless man wandering around town who claims to be
his father--the man Truman watched drown years ago and believed to be dead.
Later in the film, a close inspection of Truman's wedding photo reveals his
bride's fingers were crossed when the picture was taken. </P>
<P>But what finally makes Truman take action--spurring him on a quest for the
truth--is the memory of his true love (played by Natascha McElhone), a
woman who went by two names, Lauren and Sylvia (indicative of the slippery
nature of her identity). On a brief romantic moonlit walk on the beach, she
courageously told him, "Everyone is pretending, Truman." Soon after she
said this, she was whisked away by her father, who dismissed her words as
the ramblings of a madwoman. Yet Truman is haunted by her last words to
him: "Get out of here! Come and find me." She vanishes from his life, but
what has actually happened is that she was tossed off the show for straying
from the script. Truman's refusal to accept her disappearance is the
impetus for unraveling the web of lies that has been the matrix of his
reality for so long. He is determined to go to Fiji, where he believes he
will find her. But suspiciously, every time he tries to leave, strange
events prevent him from doing so. </P>
<P>Truman's attempts to escape Seahaven brought a haunting question to my
mind: What would freedom mean to Truman? Through television many millions
of fans around the world are more familiar with his face than they are with
those of people they see frequently in real life. But Truman is a person
who has never had the luxury of a private self. I imagined that if he ever
made it to the outside world, he would have even less privacy--his fans
would hound his every move. Yet, if he remained in the artificial
environment of Seahaven, he would be little more than a pawn trapped in an
illusory world. Either way, his life would be a kind of living hell. </P>
<P>Although this film is not without its comic touches, the dramatic aspects
of Jim Carrey's performance are what really surprised me. Working different
ground than the kind of manic, exaggerated, over-the-top comedy that made
him famous, Carrey brings off some subtler tricks here. He manages to do as
much dramatically with slight changes in his facial expression and body
language as he has shown in other films that he could do comically with his
trademark brand of humor. Truman Burbank is a fascinating archetypical
hero, an innocent everyman who has the courage to search for the truth and
not to accept the lies he has been told all his life. But Truman is a
character who is more mythic/iconic than realistic and thus is by design
not a fully faceted character. Yet Carrey puts so much into the role that
he almost makes Truman more than that, and it is difficult to imagine the
movie without him. Carrey's performance gives the film its heart and
humanity, and I believe that if he had not been in it, THE TRUMAN SHOW
could have easily been little more than a fascinating intellectual
exercise. </P>
<P>This is an extremely well crafted movie. I felt that the superb production
design and cinematography intentionally imbued the film with a slick,
soulless artificiality. This made the scenes appear wholesomely picturesque
and sweetly beautiful, yet at the same time somehow so cold and sterile
that there was an eerie deadliness to them. To my mind, the visual aspects
of the movie were meant to echo and intensify the subtle undercurrent of
horror that runs throughout the film. It is rare that style and substance
work together so seamlessly in a movie. THE TRUMAN SHOW is a multifaceted
and resonant film of ideas that has aspects of myth, allegory, and fable.
It even delves into complex philosophical issues such as illusion and
reality. A far cry from the usual summer movie fare, this is a thoughtful,
nuanced film that also manages to be highly entertaining.</P>
