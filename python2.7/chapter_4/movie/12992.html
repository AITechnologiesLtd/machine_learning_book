<PRE>Dirty Work
        Starring Norm MacDonald and Artie Lange
        Directed by Bob Saget</PRE>
<PRE>Reviewed by John Latchem</PRE>
<P>        At one point in this movie there is a staging of an Opera that goes
completely wrong.  But one member of the crowd stands up and cheers, thinking
the performance was planned, and applauding it for their efforts.  That's
"Dirty Work" in a nutshell.  A very different kind of movie.
        This is not a movie that I can easily review.  The critic in me analyzes the
structure, plot, acting, characters. . .and tells me this movie is terrible.
        But the Norm MacDonald fan in me had me rolling on the floor laughing.
        This movie plays more like an HBO sketch comedy than a movie.  It's a one
note concept.  Mitch and Sam need $50000 in order to bribe a doctor to give
their father a heart transplant before other more needy patients.  Realizing
they are very good at revenge plots, they open a revenge for hire business,
eventually running afoul of a rich businessman played by Christopher MacDonald
(who after roles in "Happy Gilmore" and "Veronica's Closet" seems typcast in
this role), who sends them to destroy a building that Mitch learns is the home
of his girlfriend's grandmother, thus leading them to plot against the rich
businessman on the night of the grand opening of a new Opera house.
        First the critic in me.  The plot is the standard poor guy vs evil rich guy
device, where the main character meets the girl of his dreams along the way.
Here's the catch.  None of the characters are sympathetic.  They're all
selfish jerks who don't care who they hurt in their attempts to do whatever
they want.  The jokes are juvenile, crude, appealing to the worst elements in
people.  There's jokes about prostitutes, the homeless, beastiality, anal sex.
There's even a subplot that's developed, it seems, only to make jokes about
infidelity and incest.
        And I loved watching it.
        I was a huge fan of Norm MacDonald's sarcastic, to-the-point comedy on
Saturday Night Live, and this movie is an hour and a half of it.  Norm
MacDonald takes a joke, strips it to the core, and tells it like it is with a
dry wit.  Like the scene were he and his friend are learning the ropes at a
new construction job.  The foreman goes over the basics, which Mitch and Sam
don't understand.  How do they get out of it?  By admiting they lied on their
resumes, and don't know a thing about construction!  And surprise, they get
fired.
        The characters are incredibly mean-spirited.  There's a father who's loud and
obnoxious, a gambling addicted Doctor played by Chevy Chase who tells Sam of
his father's condition by saying "If I were a gambling man I'd put a lot of
money on death."  The businessman Cole who always has his dog Spunky, and does
who knows what with it.  And then there's Mitch and Sam, who, thinking they
can get $50000 by destroying a building, ponder how their actions would ruin
the lives of the residents.  "Too bad we have to do it," Mitch says.
        Here's a movie where every joke that is executed as it is set up, where you
see every punchline coming, where every spot profanity could be used and then
is used.  At least the film is honest, and makes no mistake that it is
anything more than idiotic.  But at least it isn't dull, and it isn't
predictable.
        And that's the way it should be.  It's sketch comedy, and if you're a fan of
Norm MacDonald, you'll love it.  The jokes are crude, the characters are mean
to the core, the attitude of the movie is that it just doesn't care.
        If you don't like Norm MacDonald, or stupid movies, then you probably won't
like this one.  The jokes are crude, the characters are mean to the core, the
attitude of the movie is that it just doesn't care.
        So before seeing this one, tune your mindset, and prepare for a slew of Norm
MacDonald humor, gay animal sex, prison rape jokes, uncaring characters, and
one last performance from Chris Farley.</P>
<P>The critic in me says 3 out of 10 (*)
But I give it an 8 (***).  I just couldn't stop laughing.</P>
