<P>It is difficult to fall in love with a material thing like a violin,
except when it is played as beautifully as it is by solo violinist
Joshua Bell, as Esa-Pekka Salonen conducts the London Philharmonia
Orchestra, playing John Corigliano's score. When the music they play
stops and the story begins, that is where the problem lies for this very
awkwardly told arty story. Its ill-conceived plot is so sloppily
directed and trite, that it was a very trying experience just to try and
figure out what the director was trying to say about the violin that
made him think that this story was so mysterious and worth telling. That
the film is about the changing ownership of a red-stained violin
(stained with the blood of the violin maker's dead wife), and it being a
curse on those who own it, and that the main excitement centers around
it being auctioned off and sold in Montreal for a whopping sum of over
two million dollars after travelling through several countries and
centuries, does not make this tale rise to the level of exhilerating
suspense.</P>
<P>The film tells the fictionalized account of a great violin maker in
Cremona, 1861, named Nicolo Bussotti (Cecchi), who has made the perfect
violin for his expectant son. His wife's servant Cesca (Laurenzi) reads
the tarot cards and sees in them the future, predicting a tough delivery
for the mother but a long life. But the mother dies at childbirth and
the long life the tarot will refer to, is for the red violin. We will
repeatedly return to the five cards turned over in the tarot for updates
on the uncannily accurate predictions made, as over the time-frame of
three- centuries, the violin makes its way from 17th-century Italy
(Cremona), to 18th-century Austria (Vienna), to a tribe of gypsies, to
19th-century England (Oxford), to Communist China (Shanghai) and finally
to contemporary Canada (Montreal). Each century is a primer for relating
the current society's love for classical music compared to the love
shown for it by the violin's creator.</P>
<P>All the vignettes involving the violin changing hands in different
countries made me cringe with embarrassment, as the tales were so devoid
of any logic and so ridden with cliches, as to make them unintentionally
laughable.</P>
<P>In the first vignette, a  fragile child prodigy, Kaspar Weiss (Christoph
Koncz), raised by monks in Austria, is turned over to a violin tutor
(Jean-Luc Bideau) who teaches him to keep musical time with a metronome.
The child sleeps with the red violin and dies in a swoon at an audition
that will have given him a chance to become famous.</P>
<P>A ludicrous vignette takes place in England, as its greatest violinist,
the egotist Frederick Pope (Jason Flemyng), composes great compositions
playing the red violin while his girlfriend, Victoria (Greta Scacchi),
slobbers all over him while making love to him in gymnastic postions.
What could this team of writer and director have been thinking about? It
is hard to believe that this is the same team that made the very
pertinent and inspiring "Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould."</P>
<P>The scenes in Shanghai during Mao Tse-tung's Cultural Revolution, in
which Western culture is demonized and its books and musical instruments
are unceremoniously tossed into a bonfire, are flatly and uninspiringly
done. Sylvia Chang is featured as a leader in the Cultural Revolution
spouting dogmatic propaganda, but who hides the red violin, given to her
by her bourgeois mother, from her own party members.This vignette left
no lasting impression on me, except as a further illustration of how the
story got the costumes right but distorted the historical events.</P>
<P>That the film has lost all track of itself in these tedious vignettes,
so much so that it has no chance of ever uncovering what it probably
wanted to show, of how the universal message of  music brings harmony to
the world and how it transcends all cultures and kinds of people.</P>
<P>The most tawdry scene is saved for last, as a rude and corruptible New
Yorker, Charles Morritz (Samuel L. Jackson), is in Montreal working for
an auction house to restore and appraise the worth of the violin and
ends up authenticating the legitimacy of it. If that was all he did, it
would have been enough and perhaps the film could have ended with some
dignity, and the music presented would have left a big enough impression
so that the film could at least be worth seeing for that. But no! For
some unfathomable reason, we are supposed to get worked up about a
bidding war for the violin and who would possess this perfect instrument
when for the entire film there was not one person in the movie covered
in enough depth that we could get emotionally involved with, and to care
at this late date about who owns this material object, when it has long
since been viewed as a mere trophy, just doesn't make sense. That the
one who does walk away with the trophy, confirms my feeling that every
judgment the director and writer made about this film was a wrong one.</P>
<P>What makes this film seem worse than the usual Hollywood blockbuster, a
film that it is most imitative of, is that it is presented as a
high-brow art film and will draw its audience from those who see such
films, but it is done so pretentiously, lacking in any kind of subtle
mannerisms and humor, that all it has to offer story wise is its
superficial dialogue and pretty costumes. Its high production costs to
attain accuracy of story only resulted in a film of kitsch art. If you
see it, it should be only for the wonderful solo violin of Joshua Bell.</P>
