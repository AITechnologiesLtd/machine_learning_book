<P>'The Evening Star' is the long awaited sequel to 1983's 'Terms of
Endearment.'  Shirley MacLaine returns as Aurora Greenway, the firey,
outspoken and no nonsense character we came to admire in the first film.  As
'The Evening Star' begins it is 1988, approximately 15 years since the
untimely death of Aurora's daughter Emma portrayed in 'Terms of Endearment'
by Debra Winger.  Aurora's three grandchildren are now fully grown and they
all have misguided and disfunctional lives.  Throughout the course of the
movie there are many sentimental moments on film which echo the tone and feel
of the first film as we are re-united with old characters and come to know
some new ones.  The problem 'The Evening Star' has is the inevitable scrutiny
it will come under in being compared to 'Terms of Endearment.'  If that
picture had never been made then there might be something here but while it
is entertaining and contains the realistic look of everyday life, it is a
disappointing follow up movie with absolutely nothing new to offer.  The most
memorable character from 'Terms of Endearment' was Garrett Breedlove played
brilliantly by Jack Nicholson and his character is desperately needed and
guess what?  He has a cameo but it comes at a bad time at about an hour and
forty five minutes into this movie which runs two hours and eight minutes.
 We are fed up with the film by the time he shows up and it's a case of too
little too late.  There is a ridiculous and silly storyline early in the film
which has Aurora carrying on an affair with here therapist which lasts about
half of the movie and it bored me silly.  It is hard to make a good sequel to
a movie that won five Academy Awards including Best Picture of the year.  For
those who don't want the memory of the first film tarnished stay away from
this one but if you long for more of the same you'll get it but only on a
superficial and less than ambitious level.  </P>
