<PRE>PRICE OF GLORY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>Carlos Ávila's PRICE OF GLORY is the answer for those who think that the
problem with bad television is that the screen is too small.  With
schmaltz so thick that you could cut it with a knife, this sappy TV
movie-of-the-week is set to open in your local multiplex and not your
living room.</P>
<P>Nominally telling the story of "The Fighting Ortegas," the story is
really about a father, Arturo Ortega (Jimmy Smits), who wants his three
boys to succeed in the boxing world where he failed.  Rushed along too
quickly by an uncaring promoter, Arturo ended up working "on a crappy
assembly line" rather than enjoying the fruits of a championship career.</P>
<P>Devoting his life to training his sons, he relinquishes the job of being
their father in order to concentrate his energies on managing their
careers.  Each of the lads,  Sonny (Jon Seda), Jimmy (Clifton Collins
Jr.) and Johnny (Ernesto Hernández), turn into contenders.</P>
<P>When we first meet the brothers as young children, their father is
already yelling at them and throwing them against lockers for not trying
hard enough in their Silver Gloves competition.  As they grow up, they
will continue to take the abuse with remarkably little rebellion.</P>
<P>The attractive women in the story provide the supporting wallpaper.
They smile a lot and say encouraging things to their men.  Other than
backing the male members of the cast, they have no other reason for
their existence.</P>
<P>As the mildest of villains, Ron Perlman plays a slightly slimy but
extremely successful boxing promoter named Nick Everson.  Nick, who has
the face of a large gargoyle, sports big sunglasses and smokes foot-long
cigars.</P>
<P>The real delight of the movie, since it provides so many unintentional
laughs, is Phil Berger's heavily-clichéd script.  ("The only one that
can beat you is you."  "I want to talk to the man upstairs."  "Do you
think we've got a guarantee?  Do you think any of us here have a
guarantee?")  Although I can't recall them ever saying, "be the best
that you can be," I suspect it was in the script but was removed in the
final editing.</P>
<P>The movie, unlike the recent, disastrous PLAY IT TO THE BONE, ends in a
reasonably decent big match.  The outcome is never in doubt, but at
least it is filmed invitingly and edited lucidly.  The ending of PRICE
OF GLORY isn't exactly memorable, but, compared to the rest of the
movie, it is the only winning sequence.</P>
<P>PRICE OF GLORY runs too long at 1:57.  It is rated PG-13 for violence,
language and brief drug content and would be acceptable for teenagers.</P>
