<P>Major League: Back to the Minors (PG-13) no stars (out of ****)</P>
<P>You know the guy: sometimes bearded, often burly, he always manages to
sit in the seat directly behind you, ever so eager to greet a film's
every slight attempt at humor with a hearty, guttural explosion of
laughter.  You know you're neck-deep into something awful when even
that guy, who reveals his erpetually guffawing self during the
trailers, remains as stonily silent throughout the film as everyone
else in the auditorium.  And Major League: Back to the Minors is truly
something awful.  Horribly written and directed by John Warren, this
third installment of the baseball comedy series is unwatchable drivel.</P>
<P>Aging minor-league pitcher Gus Cantrell (Scott Bakula) is recruited by
old friend and Minnesota Twins owner Roger Dorn (Corbin Bernsen) to
coach the Twins' struggling farm team, the Buzz, an inept squad that
counts among its ranks a former ballet dancer (ha ha).  As can be
expected, Gus manages to make winners out of these goofballs, leading
to the Buzz's big moment in the sun: an exhibition game against the
major league Twins themselves, in their big-city home field.  Much to
the chagrin of the Twins' slick, self-absorbed manager (Ted McGinley),
the Buzz put on a respectable showing.</P>
<P>End of story.  But wait--only 45 minutes of screen time has passed. So
what does Warren do now? Why, what any desperate, in-over-his-head
hack would do--recycle his script.  After the Buzz's star player (Walt
Goggins) is wooed into the majors, the Buzz once again hits hard
times, and Gus has to prod them back into shape. And he does, leading
to the team's big moment in the sun. You guessed it--an exhibition
game against the Twins, but this time taking place on the Buzz's
backwater home turf.</P>
<P>Going through the same story twice would not have been as big of an
annoyance if Warren's script had simply done its job: be funny.  But
nothing in the film comes close to eliciting the slightest smirk when the
writer's painful idea of witty comic repartée is something like this:
        "This team has a former ballerina?"
        "I don't think they call men ballerinas."
        "A balladeer?"
        "Isn't that a singer?"
        "I think that's a troubadour."</P>
<P>But to merely attack the screenplay on the humor level (though it
deserves a most thorough beating on that basis) is to let Warren off
too easily; he can't even integrate his product plugs with the
slightest trace of subtlety.  Says Bob Uecker, playing the Buzz's
announcer, in reference to something that happened a long time ago:
"That was before Diet Coke became my beverage of choice."  Warren's
direction is every bit as sloppy as his writing; even though the final
game's outcome is never in doubt, there's no attempt--through the
editing, music, anything--any at creating any illusion of suspense.
Contributing to the mess are the actors, who plod along in haphazard
directions as if no helmer were present at all, especially McGinley,
whose over-the-wall-and-out-of-the-ballpark antics worked on
Married... with Children but not here.</P>
<P>I have not seen either of the first two Major Leagues, and I'll give
those films the benefit of the doubt; they could very well hold some
merit. But after sitting through the excrutiating Back to the Minors,
you won't find me rushing to the video stores any time soon.</P>
