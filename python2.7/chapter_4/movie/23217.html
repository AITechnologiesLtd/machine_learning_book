<PRE>LIGHT SPOILERS</PRE>
<P>There's a fledgling subgenre out there in movie-land; for arguments'
sake, let's call it the "mainstream postmodern ironic suburban hitman
comedy."  On its good days it brings you your Get Shorty's and your
Grosse Pointe Blank's; and on it's off days, well, you end up with
Mickey Blue Eyes.  The Whole Nine Yards lies somewhere in the middle
ground - it's a movie that has all the right elements waiting on the
sidelines, but suffers from having a central character that simply
can't bring everything together.</P>
<P>Matthew Perry plays Nick Oseransky (if he had friends they'd call him
"Oz"), the charming loser dentist.  He lives in Montreal with his wife
Sophie (Rosanna Arquette, sporting an obnoxious accent, and tapping
into the old comedic standby that Americans just don't like those
snotty French people) and her mother; it's clear that these women
despise him and wish death upon him, and that poor Oz is driven to the
brink of insanity by them, but, dammit, they're all he's got.  And
that sentence about as detailed as what we're told in the movie - the
one- minute, one-dimensional setup of these folks' relationship is
really all we get.</P>
<P>When the notorious Chicago hitman Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski moves in
next door, Nick's world is, of course, set on its ear.  Nick
recognizes Jimmy instantly, and, since Nick also happens to hail from
the Windy City himself, he knows Jimmy The Tulip's entire kill record
and courtroom history.  He also knows that the Gogolack crime family
back in Chicago has Jimmy on their hit list.  His wife Sophie,
money-hungry leech that she is, decides that Nick should take a plane
to Chicago and let the Gogolacks know about Jimmy's whereabouts,
hoping there's some sort of finder's fee.  Nick, spineless wimp that
he is, agrees to go along with her plan, and, of course, he gets
caught in the middle up in a mini-mobster war of sorts.  It's a silly
and contrived sitcom setup, granted, but the plot in this kind of film
is secondary; it really only needs to serve as a showcase for its
quirky and off-center characters.</P>
<P>But alas, The Whole Nine Yards doesn't have a whole lot to offer in
the character department - except for a few of the more minor roles,
there's just not a whole lot of quirky goin' around.  Let's take a
look at the lineup of the usual suspects, in order from least to most
appealing...</P>
<P># 1 - "The Hitman's Wife" aka Cynthia aka Natasha Henstridge - She
plays Jimmy The Tulip's unhappy and uninteresting wife, and seems
genuinely surprised that a man who's killed 17 people turned out to be
a bad husband.  What doesn't seem genuine, however, is the romance
that quickly flares up between herself and Nick the Dentist.  She's
also the lucky contestant that gets to utter the inevitable line that
includes and poorly explains the movie's title.</P>
<P># 2 - "The Dentist" aka Nick "Oz" Oseransky aka Matthew Perry - The
movie's fatal structural weakness.  A central character needs to be
able to hold a film together, and Nick just doesn't have what it
takes.  It's not Perry's fault that Oz is an uninteresting and only
occasionally funny guy...  He trips over couches, runs into lamps, and
stutters with the best of them, but the script makes the mistake of
filtering too much through his boring and unoriginal eyes.</P>
<P># 3 -" The Hitman With a Heart of Gold" aka Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski
aka Bruce Willis - Here Willis plays the fundamentally good-hearted
contract killer with the skewed view of the world that makes Nick the
Dentist roll his eyes and do spit takes.  The Whole Nine Yards
features Bruce Willis in "Acting Mode 2."  These are the movies he
does to make up for the pay cuts he takes to be in good films like 12
Monkeys and Pulp Fiction, and if that's what he has to do, then that's
all right by me.  He delivers a perfectly acceptable performance that
he could have easily just phoned in, but at least it looks like he was
having fun.</P>
<P># 4 - "The Ving Rhames" aka Frankie Figs aka Michael Clarke Duncan -
If Duncan, who was the heart and soul of The Green Mile, is trying to
differentiate himself from Ving Rhames, then this is the wrong way to
go about it.  Here he plays another hitman with hidden and shifting
motives.  He shows the same kind charisma he did as The Green Mile's
John Coffey and gets some genuine smiles, but his ultimate fate seems
remarkably unfitting.</P>
<P># 5 - "The Boss" aka Yanni Gogolack aka Kevin Pollak - The boss of the
Hungarian Gogolack crime family who wants to see Jimmy dead.  Most of
his laughs come from his indescribably goofy accent - a humorous and
well-practiced blend of Michael Corleone and Bela Lugosi - and the
bizarre non-words that come out of his mouth as a result.</P>
<P># 6 - "The Apprentice" aka Jill aka Amanda Peet - This overly
enthusiastic protege of Jimmy the Tulip is the movie's clear standout.
She projects the same brand of believable nonchalance toward her
chosen profession as John Cusack's character in Grosse Pointe Blank.
I couldn't help but smile whenever she was on the screen.  And
unfortunately for The Whole Nine Yards, I couldn't help but wish I was
watching Grosse Pointe Blank instead.</P>
