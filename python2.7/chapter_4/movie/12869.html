-----</PRE>
<P>The central figure in "Bulworth" is a man who is fed up with the
pointlessness and nonsense of the system. The problem is, he's part of
the system--a U.S. senator who plays the political game not unlike, we
may suspect, every other person in American politics. He's trapped in
a world where words and image mean everything and in-practice policy
and true intentions mean virtually nothing.</P>
<P>The man is democratic Senator Jay Bulworth, portrayed by Warren Beatty
in a hypercharged, madcap performance that borders on the surreal,
which is perfectly appropriate, since "Bulworth" is a film that exists
in a sort of surreal state. This isn't a film about realistic events
or circumstances; it's all about attitude. The movie is a commentary
that takes situations and twists them into exaggerated parodies of the
American political arena.</P>
<P>As the movie opens, Bulworth, the incumbent up for re-election, sits
in his office in a trancelike state, staring blankly at footage from
his own TV campaign ads. He hasn't eaten or slept in days, but instead
has been pondering the nature of his political existence. He's
disgusted to the point of catatonia. He has reached a point in his
career where everything he does exists simply to serve his own
campaign's interests. Why is he even in office? All of his
advertisements and speeches begin with the same sound bite: "We stand
at the doorstep of a new millennium." But just what does that mean?
It's an irrelevant line of hogwash--frosting that just sounds good.
When you think about it, it doesn't serve any useful purpose.</P>
<P>One of his wealthy campaign contributors (Paul Sorvino) is a powerful
corporate influence in the insurance industry--a right-winger who is
happy that Bulworth's new platform takes a more conservative slant
than in the past. Sorvino's character is the type whose opinion of
blacks boils down to being a fan of Colin Powell and Michael Jordan,
but not at all sympathetic where black poverty and crime are
concerned. So the fact that Bulworth's new policy is to step away from
social programs and aid is a big plus in his book.</P>
<P>But Bulworth doesn't seem very interested with the issue at all. He
wants out--now. So he hires out a hit on himself. Set to travel to
California for his campaign, he expects to be dead before he returns.
("If I'm not dead by Monday, I'm going to stop payment on that
check.") Once he gets to California it seems like campaign business as
usual, until Bulworth realizes that he might as well make the best out
of knowing he's not going to see the end of next week.</P>
<P>>From here, Bulworth ceases all self-censorship and simply says what's
on his mind. When he gives a speech early in the film in front of an
African-American community, he says the only reason he made any
promises to black voters is so that he could garner their votes. Sure,
we've seen this "tell all truth" slant on such material before, but
the difference in "Bulworth" is that all of the film's points
eventually turn inward to stare the political machine straight in the
eye.</P>
<P>A big part of the movie's comedic sell is the way Bulworth's newfound
cavalier attitude leads him into a techno-rap dance club, where he
jams the night away with Nina (Halle Berry), a young black woman from
South Central L.A. who proves with each succeeding scene that there's
more to her than anyone might suspect.</P>
<P>As a satire, "Bulworth" is often scathing and always pointed, and it's
interesting to ponder the intended audiences of a film starring and
directed by a 60-year-old white guy and featuring a soundtrack that's
wall-to-wall with youthful hip-hop. After his night in the club,
Beatty's character incorporates rap into his political campaign, much
to the bewilderment of his campaign manager (Oliver Platt). Scenes
where Bulworth "rhymes" his speeches to a well-to-do audience or on a
TV broadcast could've been hopelessly silly, but Beatty pulls it off,
finding the balance between zany, tongue-in-cheek farce and blunt
social commentary. Beatty's decision to push the envelope pays off; I
was constantly interested in where the movie would go next, and was
glad that it pulled few punches.</P>
<P>As the plot unfolds and Bulworth careens from one campaign site to
another, he finds himself in an enigmatic relationship with Nina, who
has some interesting political views of her own. Bulworth, of course,
also realizes he has been freed from his burden of politics and thus
no longer wants to die, so both he and Nina find themselves on the run
from the apparent hitman whom Bulworth hired. The chase takes on a
life of its own.</P>
<P>In the process, the movie devours cliches just as fast as or faster
than it acknowledges them. The irony of the movie's use of rap music
in juxtaposition with politics is interesting; some politicians
frequently target rap as a social problem, but Bulworth's answer to
the accusation that rap is "obscene" is particularly interesting. In a
world with so many tangible problems, blaming the entertainment
industry seems more than just a little ridiculous.</P>
<P>As a comedy, "Bulworth's" laughs are generated through witty social
mockery as well as the plot's obvious sight and dialogue gags. The
pace is fast and furious; one of the film's biggest appeals is the
high-energy buzz generated by the rapid-fire dialogue. You have to
listen fast in many scenes, because the film is a constant earful.
Many characters serve to unleash snippets of the screenplay's points
of view, and some have entire speeches that add to the film's canvas
(particularly an interesting drug dealer character played by Don
Cheadle, whose exploitative use of his advantages is compared to the
methods of politicians). Such speeches are sudden an lengthy--yet
remain just far enough outside the confines of sullen
seriousness--that we always know "Bulworth" is a comedy, but also that
it is an angry comedy with a lot on its mind.</P>
<P>The topics range anywhere from big-business economics versus
government spending, the plight of forgotten minorities in the
inner-cities, the inefficient use of media to cover politics, and the
fact that drug use isn't limited to back alleys (Bulworth's campaign
manager snorts cocaine whenever his stress levels breach their
limits)--really, anything is fair game. Essentially, the movie is an
argument for socialism. But it's worth noting that a man like Bulworth
could never maintain a plausible existence in our mainstream political
system, which is perhaps why the film's closing scene is all the more
honest and true.</P>
<P>Perhaps everything about "Bulworth" can be summed up in that first
scene, where the "doorstep of the next millennium" is uttered over and
over again until it becomes its own useless cliche in the sea of
political cliches. Maybe, the film argues, that's what politics is all
about: It's all window dressing used to spice up a process that
doesn't serve its people nearly as adequately as it should. "Bulworth"
offers little in terms of realistic solutions to the problems it
points out; it is, essentially an angry farce that is willing to
tackle anything and everything it can muster. But it's so much smarter
and fresher than the average movie. It may not know exactly how the
world can be fixed, but it certainly knows that there's more broken
with America than the people in Washington would likely be willing to
acknowledge.</P>
