<P>After single handedly crafting the worst film of 1999, the unbearably
heavy handed art house rubbish The Loss of Sexual Innocence, jazzy
auteur Mike Figgis brings his experimental eye to an adaptation of
August Strindberg's Miss Julie.</P>
<P>It's a brilliant play, one which observes naturalistic behavior and
flawed, complex characters without judgment. It's filled with
beautifully written scenes of emotional conviction. Naturally, Figgis is
so hell bent on his radical tinkering with form and content that the
story becomes a muddle of sensual implications taken straight from
fashion magazine perfume ads.</P>
<P>Indeed, he casts former model and current girlfriend Saffron Burrows in
the title role as Julie – a challenge for even the most experienced
actor. Julie slowly breaks down on the evening after her marriage has
fallen to pieces. She will ultimately return to a family structure which
will stifle her, and struggles willfully with her passions and appetites
embodied in the form of a robust servant (Peter Mullan).</P>
<P>Burrows gave sulky, shallow performances in Figgis' Sexual Innocence and
in Renny Harlin's Deep Blue Sea (the audience I was with cheered when
the sharks pursued her with bared teeth.) Her performances in those
films were remarkably similar to her work here. She does wear her hair
in slightly different curls and perhaps uses some blond highlights, but
her emotional range remains the same, haughtily demanding to be waited
on or entertained, occasionally allowing her lips to part for wet kisses
and chafing tongues. Would this be a Figgis film without smutty groping
and breast fondling every ten minutes?</P>
<P>When we first glimpse Miss Julie, she enters the large kitchen space. It
resembles the crumbling theater used in Louis Malle's superior Vanya on
42nd Street. Julie stares at a bird in a cage. Figgis can't resist
hammering the point home by shooting Julie through the bars. After that
image, there's hardly any point to watching the rest of the film, which
is her last gasp of inflicting her will on the macho, belligerent and
self righteous servant, who continually mutters that she on her pedestal
can never understand the lives of those below. She allows herself to be
ravished on her own terms (`kiss my foot'), with the inevitable regret,
guilt and sadness which surely follow. She is, after all, merely `a
fragile woman' full of dew.</P>
<P>If Burrows had a commanding screen presence, some shred of integrity or
glimmer of intellect – Cate Blanchett would have been perfect – one
would feel Strindberg's sense of all too human tragedy which comes hand
in hand with female oppression. Instead, we are presented with Figgis
posturing artistically and, shooting her brooding face in the soft
sunlight, sexually objectifying her.</P>
<P>Figgis has a penchant for hand-held photography on the mobile super-16mm
camera, which makes free use of the space and puts us on the same level
of his characters. This does manage to break through the stodgy barrier
of making a highbrow, affected period film, which all too often
degenerates into costume drama waxwork displays and loses all passion
and vigor.</P>
<P>However, he neglects to make it as `human' as this technique might
imply, still overly fixated on hyperreal, gauzy lighting and formal
devices over content, even making fade out ellipses feel heavy handed.
He's in love with long, adoring close ups of Burrows vacant good looks,
or of Mullen staring at her obsessively. His performance is so rigid he
might as well be wearing a corset.</P>
<P>His most indulgent choice is editing a sex scene from two angles running
parallel in a split framed sequence, which reeks of being experimental
for its own sake and a prelude for Time Code, which tells its story in
four panels simultaneously (one in each corner of the screen.) If Miss
Julie is any indication, it's a device which serves to increase the
artificiality and, thus, the ridiculousness of his scenario.</P>
<P>Mike Figgis is not without prowess or enormous technical skill, and I
admire his adventurous spirit. If only he didn't get high on the fumes
of his own highbrow artistic flatulence, he's become a filmmaker of
serious consideration. Until that time, he remains merely a curious
dilettante.</P>
