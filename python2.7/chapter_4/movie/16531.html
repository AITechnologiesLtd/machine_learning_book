<PRE>GOD SAID 'HA!'
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>Although it is a bit easier in a stage play than a movie, few people can
single-handedly carry an almost hour and a half production with a single
unbroken monologue.  The brilliant orator Spalding Gray can do it, as he
did in SWIMMING TO CAMBODIA and other movies.  His rapid-fire delivery
and his fascinating material mesmerizes his audiences even if his
overabundant exhilaration can exhaust them.</P>
<P>GOD SAID 'HA!,' written and directed by and starring Julia Sweeney, is a
one person play that was filmed in front of a live audience and is being
released to movie theaters.  The live audience supplies the equivalent
of an annoying television laugh track.  As Julie talks non-stop, the
studio audience guffaws at her every phrase.  You begin to feel guilty
for not laughing on cue, and you find yourself subconsciously looking
around the movie theater for one of those obnoxious, neon "Laugh!" signs
found in some old television studios.</P>
<P>Julia Sweeney, while a completely likeable and utterly confident
actress, is no Spalding Gray.  Her delivery and her script can hold a
viewer's attention only for the length of an extended television comedy
sketch (she's a veteran of the "Saturday Night Live" TV show).  A little
of her routine goes a long way.</P>
<P>Julie tells an apparently true story about the time after her happy
divorce when her dying brother and her parents came to live with her.
With minimal stage props and with two relatively fixed camera angles,
she looks the camera in the eye and tells her story through a series of
vignettes.  Wandering slowly around the stage, she speaks in one of two
monotonic voices, her own and one mimicking her parents.</P>
<P>Her only slightly quirky brand of humor does produce several smiles
albeit few laughs.  She tells, for example, about the time that she
wanted to be rebellious while her parents were staying with her.  She
decided to smoke a cigarette and get the latest book by the Pope, with
whom she always disagrees.  Another time she talks about the
50,000-piece puzzle of Sarajevo that her father got for a 50-cent
donation to PBS and how it had taken over her dining room table.</P>
<P>Her best pieces concern sex.  She tells a sweet and funny little tale
about a boyfriend coming to visit.  Feeling like a Catholic schoolgirl
again, she played footsie with him under the table and generally hid her
sexual escapades with him from her parents.  She had forgotten how
exciting forbidden sex can be.</P>
<P>Trying to move a play to the screen without making any changes is almost
always a bad idea.  The mediums are different and require different
approaches.  Although there are the exceptional performers like Spalding
Gray who can pull this off, it is a feat better not attempted.  Julia
Sweeney gives it her best shot but only sporadically succeeds.</P>
<P>GOD SAID 'HA!' runs 1:26.  It is rated PG-13 for mature themes and some
drug references and would be fine for teenagers.</P>
