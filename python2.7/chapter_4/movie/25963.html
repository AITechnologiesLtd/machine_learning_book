<PRE>      WENT TO CONEY ISLAND ON A MISSION FROM GOD... BE BACK BY FIVE
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Who would have thought that the life of Jon Cryer -- actor in such
memorable films as Hiding Out and Morgan Stewart's Coming Home -- would
be such fertile ground for based-on-a-true-story filmmaking?</P>
<P>     Based on a script co-written by Cryer himself, Went to Coney
Island... is a movie about exactly that.  Daniel (Cryer) and Stan (Rick
Stear) head to the New York landmark in the dead of winter, based on a
rumor they've heard about their childhood friend Richie.  The
long-missing Richie, it seems, has taken up residence under the
boardwalk, joining ranks with the insane and otherwise homeless Coney
Island-dwellers.  It's Daniel and Stan to the rescue.</P>
<P>     Why has Richie gone nuts?  Will Stan come to terms with his
alcoholism and gambling issues?  Will Daniel loosen up a little?  All
these questions will be answered in the 90 minutes that Coney Island
runs -- and these are some of the bleakest moments on film.</P>
<P>     Washed out to the point of near monochrome, Coney Island is a hard
film to watch because the anguish onscreen is unrelenting.  Cryer and
his compatriot Richard Schenkman have obviously poured a lot of soul
into this picture, so much so that the film feels insular to the cast
and crew -- and off-putting to the audience.  Fortunately, a number of
lighter moments (and a memorable by Frank Whaley as a Skee-Ball
attendant) make the film quite watchable, not to mention keeping you, as
a viewer, from slitting your wrists thanks to all the melancholy.</P>
<P>     Ultimately, Coney Island tries to be a mini-Magnolia with its tales
of intersecting pasts and presents, and in some aspects it is
successful.  But Coney Island could steal a thing or two from Magnolia
about how a depressing story can resonate with an audience by tricking
the viewer into caring deeply about its subjects.  The Wonder Wheel may
not spin fast enough for that.</P>
