<P>"Pearl Harbor" – Ambitious Plans, Fair Results</P>
<P>If "Pearl Harbor" were released at any other time
during the year, this film would at best be considered
a thin offering that's often more banal than moving. 
It's oversimplified perspective on history and it's
underdeveloped cast of characters never adequately
portrayed the stark realities of war, the strains of
rivalry, the importance of camaraderie, the glory of
love, or the necessity of sacrifice.  </P>
<P>But it's the summertime and we crave special
effects-laden movies.  Thus with a theme that mixes
war, love, and glory and the multitude of impressive
dogfights and battle sequences, there's plenty to keep
people seated through the 3-hour film.  Seated yes,
riveted no. </P>
<P>After watching this film with my best friend (Daniel
Scher) and my roommate (Ming Shih), I was intrigued to
learn that we all came away with similar reasons to
applaud the movie and similar reservations as well. 
This is interesting to note because Daniel prefers
dramas, Ming favors love stories, and I like anything
that gives me an excuse to sip soda.  So, no matter
what you look for in a film, you will probably note
these observations as well.</P>
<P>Of distinction was the ambitiousness of this project
and its epic feel, which seemed to pull ideas from
films like "Titanic," "Saving Private Ryan," and "Top
Gun."  The central story of love and friendship is
told against the backdrop of WWII.  Our likeable
patriotic flyboys, Rafe and Danny (Ben Affleck and
Josh Hartnett), battle each other for the love of
dedicated nurse Evelyn (Kate Beckinsdale).  The
stability of their friendship, however, may be as
fragile as chances for peace with Japan in late 1941. </P>
<P>With its high production values, the film ably evoked
America's image as a society of 'weaklings and
playboys,' the frenzied atmosphere of trying to
ascertain Japanese fleet movement, and the imminent
danger that lied ahead.  Most stirring were the
moments leading up to the fateful sneak attack as
dozens of Japanese squadrons flew toward their
military targets unnoticed by American listening
posts.  FDR's (Jon Voight) emotional appeals for
action were also moving.  And the film incorporated
black and white camerawork to give the imagery an
added sense of realism.</P>
<P>However, our chief reservation was that its tone was
noticeably indecisive, flirting between an epic love
story and war film.  The story about friendship and
sacrifice could have stood on its own without the
clutter of war.  But with the haze of combat, it
became unclear what happened to many of the
interesting secondary characters.  Most shameful,
though, was the weak segment on Dorie Miller (Cuba
Gooding Jr.), a real-life cook who manned a gun during
the Pearl Harbor attack to defend his ship, and who
was the first colored man to receive the Navy Cross.  </P>
<P>Actually, the whole Pearl Harbor sequence did nothing
to advance the story and at the very least, seemed out
of place.  It does not succeed in establishing any
tone or groundwork for some future occurrence.  This
could have been spliced out and made into its own IMAX
feature.  Meanwhile, much of the other war aspects was
heavily sanitized to gain a mass audience-accessible
rating of PG-13.  As such, this component lacked soul.</P>
<P>At times, the movie achieved some majestic and
poignant highs.  At other times, the syrupy Harlequinn
Romance dialogue and music brought it to embarrassing
lows. For several of you, this may be a time that
tries mens' souls.  But the overall effort is
certainly worth a matinee ticket and a bucket of
popcorn. </P>
