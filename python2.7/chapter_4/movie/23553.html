<PRE>THE BIG KAHUNA</PRE>
<PRE> Reviewed by Harvey Karten
 Lions Gate Films
 Director: John Swanbeck
 Writer: Roger Rueff, from his play "Hospitality Suite" 
 Cast: Kevin Spacey, Danny De Vito, Peter Facinelli</PRE>
<P>   Some actors were born to play scam artists.  Alec Baldwin
as chief huckster Blake in "Glengarry Glen Ross." Ben Affleck
in a similar role as Jim Young in "Boiler Room,"  Steve Martin
as Jimmy Dell in "The Spanish Prisoner."  Kevin Spacey as
an industrial lubricants salesman, Larry, in "The Big Kahuna." 
There's one difference, though.  In "Kahuna," written by
Roger Rueff from his play "Hospitality Suite" and directed by
first-time helmer John Swanbeck, Spacey comes across as
huckster in the initial part of the story, the comic scenes. His
con-man guise gradually fades as Swanbeck moves him into
the second part: a deeper, more intense, more human portion
of the narrative.  By watching this remarkable staged play on
the big screen, we leave the theater with more insight about
the characters and, I dare say, more intuition about
ourselves.  Isn't this what good cinema is all about?</P>
<P>   "The Big Kahuna" exhibits the typical structure of a
theatrical drama--a group of people essentially locked up
together in a room to work out emotional difficulties (a good
example being Eugene O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into
Night" in which a single family reveal with brutal honesty the
causes of their tragic lives).  Playwright Roger Rueff is no
O'Neill, but in showing us his trio's long night's journey into
day he cuts through their defenses so incisively that he
reveals the goodness beneath one seemingly shallow man's
bravado and the inanity behind a seemingly principled
character's saintliness.  An older man is the catalyst for the
war between two opposing viewpoints of life, a referee in a
90-minute bout pitting people of contrasting philosophies in
the ring, each taking something from the other that makes
him a better person.</P>
<P>   "The Big Kahuna" is set almost wholly inside a relatively
small hospitality suite on the sixteenth floor of a hotel in
Witchita, Kansas, to be the hub of a business party taking
place in a few hours.  Three marketing reps from a company
selling industrial lubricants--middle-aged, fast-talking Larry
(Kevin Spacey), the older Phil (Danny De Vito) and a nervous
kid on his first real job, Bob (Pete Facinelli)--have been sent
to the Midwest location to sell the company's product.  Their
major target is the president of a client corporation whom the
trio are eager to snare into a big sale.  The big problem is
that the big Kahuna seems to be a no-show, but just as Larry
and Phil despair, they find out from young Bob that this kid
was talking to the man all night.  He was not discussing
lubricants, though; a practicing Baptist, Bob spent the hours
addressing the nature of God with the corporate president.</P>
<P>   "The Big Kahuna" turns our expectations inside out.  As we
observe the cynical Larry deliver quips about beautiful women
and complaints about the cheap look of the room and the
food; as we watch the newly divorced and troubled Phil
reading a copy of Penthouse magazine before the party is to
begin; we imagine that the hero of the evening will be young
Bob, who is pure at heart, a young man who takes seriously
the New Testament concept that if you lust after a woman
you are as guilty as the man who actually commits adultery. 
Having gazed down his priggish nose at the "fallen" men with
whom he is teamed, wearing a shining, metaphoric halo
about his head because he discussed higher things with the
client than plain old lubricants, Bob is jolted, absolutely
stunned, to find that of the threesome, he is the one with the
least character.  How he comes to this cognizance should not
be revealed in a review.  The point of the movie is to have us
indulge the threesome working on one another rather than on
their clients and to discover how each of the three--Phil, who
is tired and looks to another way of life now that he faces his
mortality; Larry, whose repartee hits all the right comic notes;
and Bob, who is so full of his upright self that he cannot
distinguish character from cottage cheese--leave the hotel in
the morning wiser, more attuned, more human. For a script
this trenchant, director Swanbeck and the writer, Roger Rueff,
could not have assembled a better cast than the
extraordinary Kevin Spacey, the remarkable Danny De Vito,
and, big surprise, newcomer Pete Facinelli who as an actor
must have felt like the salesman he is playing.  In a room
with the two greats, he must have been most deeply affected
by the key line in the story.  The cynical Larry asks the kid,
"You think you're ready?" to which Bob answers, "There's
only one way to find out and that is to throw me into the
ocean and see if I can swim."  Larry's retort: "We are about
to throw you off a cliff and see if you can fly."  Bob does
indeed fly as does the whole film.  Well done all around.</P>
