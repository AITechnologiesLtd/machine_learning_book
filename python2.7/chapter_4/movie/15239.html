<P>"What Dreams May Come" is like two movies in one. On one hand, it's one of
the most manipulative, dry, boring and even silly dramas I've ever seen.
The title may come from a quote from "Hamlet", but believe me; "Hamlet" it
ain't. Also, Vincent Ward's direction is so self-indulgent it's almost
laughable. But on another, much more positive note, it is the most
breathtakingly beautiful film this critic has ever seen. No other movie in
the history of cinema has taken me on such a sensory journey for the senses
and, above all, the imagination. There are shots in this film that will
literally make your mouth drop open. In my mind, there is absolutely no
question as to what should/will pick up some Oscars in March for
cinematography and art direction. </P>
<P>However, as visually stunning as "Dreams" is, the monotonous and rather
shallow narrative really bogs it down. Despite predictably great
performances from the film's two leads, Robin Williams (who may be looking
at another nomination, if he doesn't nab one for the up-coming "Patch
Adams") and Annabella Sciorra, it never really rises out of the hole it dug
itself into to become the truly great film experience that it should have
been. Something with this much potential can't afford any screw-ups. </P>
<P>The story starts out promising, but as I said, gets increasingly
predictable and silly. Williams is Chris Nielsen, a married doctor mourning
the recent deaths of his two children (Jessica Brooks and Josh Paddock),
who died in a car wreck. In a coincidence even the film seems to find
extreme, Chris dies a short time later in yet another car crash trying to
save someone else's life. </P>
<P>Chris is taken to Heaven (though not immediately), where he meets an old
doctor friend of his now acting as his guide and companion in his own
version of the afterlife. For a short time, Chris runs free, enjoying the
unparalleled pleasures of the kingdom of God. </P>
<P>Here is where the strong art direction and cinematography kick in.
Williams' vision of Heaven is so unique and, for lack of a better word,
revolutionary, that I just sat in my seat and gawked at what I was seeing. </P>
<P>After a while, it is found out that Chris' wife Annie, distraught over her
recent losses, took her own life and is now condemned to an eternity in
Hell. Only with the help of another guide called, plainly enough, The
Tracker (Max von Sydow - is anyone surprised?) will Chris be able to travel
to the underworld and bring back the woman he loves. </P>
<P>It is also worth noting that the film's vision of Hell are equally as
stunning as Heaven's. It is still beautiful and brilliantly realized, only
in a much darker and more disturbing way. </P>
<P>All in all, director Ward took what had the potential to be the very best
of '98s films, put in some stupid plot twists (the "twists" that I'm
referring to occur not once, not twice, but three times during the movie.
The only problem is, it's the same twist over and over!) and slapped on a
happy, smilely and way to sappy ending, all to assure box office results.
Note to Hollywood; when you have great material, put it in the hands of a
capable filmmaker. </P>
