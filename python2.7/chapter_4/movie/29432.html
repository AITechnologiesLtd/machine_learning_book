<PRE>TAPE
A film review by Norm Schrager
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>While the film world awaits what sounds like a daring experiment from
director Richard Linklater -- the animated Waking Life, coming in
October -- the filmmaker attempts to hold us over with Tape, a failure
of a low-budget project if ever there was one.  The movie is shot on
video and confined to a single motel room, for the entirety of its
real-time, 84-minute length.  With such restrictive parameters
self-imposed on a feature, success really must lie in creative
direction, acting power, and a solid screenplay.  All three are
non-existent here.</P>
<P>Tape is based on a play by Stephen Belber, and the playwright
contributes the clunky script, full of obvious dialogue and silly
posturing.  With one strike already against them, the experienced, name
cast (Hawke, Leonard, and Thurman) then take the problem a step further,
apparently not realizing that performances need to be taken down a notch
on video, as the medium tends to overexpose every movement and moment. 
(While Thurman's performance is good, the trio need to watch Brad
Anderson's Session 9 for a good example of subtle acting on video.)</P>
<P>Hawke, Linklater's Before Sunrise star, is Vince, a manipulative,
possibly violent drug dealer who's reuniting with Leonard's Johnny, ten
years after their questionable friendship in high school.  Johnny is in
town to premiere his first film in a local festival, and they convene in
Vince's seedy, low-key motel room.</P>
<P>Through some poorly delivered dialogue -- although much of it can't be
saved from the page anyway -- we learn of Vince's problematic tendencies
and Johnny's existence as a self-proclaimed goody-two-shoes, high on
moral fiber and good intentions.  When Vince pushes Johnny's buttons in
just the right way, a revelation surfaces, steeped in jealousy and
revenge.  Fellow classmate Thurman is then thrown into the mix, as is,
unfortunately for her, the motel room.</P>
<P>It must be quite a challenge adapting a stage play to the screen, as
many plays can be painfully static in comparison to the cinematic
rhythms of a film.  One would think that camera movement and placement
could truly turn a "stagy" setup into a visually intriguing film
(Lumet's Deathtrap comes to mind, as do the warehouse scenes in
Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs).  So it's quite a disappointment to see
Linklater's direction of Tape alternate between being stale and cliché.</P>
<P>When he's not spending too much time sitting on one shot -- trying to be
kind of video "underground", I guess -- he's pulling off annoying swish
pans between Hawke and Leonard while they argue, trying way too hard to
force some urgency.</P>
<P>Hawke's performance reeks of exaggeration, and Leonard would appear to
be a plain-old bad actor.  He barely gets into the role, looking as if
he were auditioning for the school play.  The plaintive, wimpy,
holier-than-thou stance that he applies to Johnny comes off as being not
only annoying, but wholly stilted.  I kept hoping for Vince to sock John
in the face, but alas, it never happens.</P>
<P>Things perk up when Uma Thurman's Amy joins the fray, not only because
it highlights the smartest points of the script, but because Thurman's
performance is the richest of the three.  She plays it naïve,
mysterious, and collected, and it helps push through the finale -- a
finale which Linklater and Belber surely think is cooler than it
actually is.</P>
<P>Reviewed as part of our 2001 Boston Film Festival coverage (feature
story coming soon).</P>
