<P>The ads for "Batman And Robin" scream "the event of the summer is here" 
and that's the problem. The producers were apparently so intent on 
creating a spectacle that they forgot to put an actual movie inside of it.
 "Batman And Robin" is 126 minutes of lavish sets, flashy costumes and 
big, confusing fight scenes with barely a hint of substance. It's like 
one of those cheesy Kings Island stage shows; bright, busy and visually 
diverting, but not very much fun.</P>
<P>It wasn't always this way. Tim Burton's "Batman" was an epic story of 
obsession and duality, of darkness and revenge. The film, while far from 
perfect, was a striking mood piece with an otherworldly feel. Batman was 
a creepy, brooding  creature of the night. The Joker, brilliantly 
overplayed by Jack Nicholson, was at once charismatic and repellent. 
Batman and the Joker were opposite sides of the same coin, battling inner 
demons and one another over Gotham City's breathtaking gothic skyline.</P>
<P>Those days of the Dark Knight are gone, replaced by a psychedelic Ice 
Capades run amuck. "Batman And Robin" has far more in common with the 
campy 60's Batman TV show than with Tim Burton's tale of darkness. 
The blame lies with director Joel Schumacher. A former window-dresser, 
Schumacher is adept at decorating sets and dressing people in exotic 
costumes. Unfortunately, when it comes time to have those people walk and 
talk, he hasn't the faintest notion of what to do. "Batman And Robin" is 
overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited 
that it's often difficult to tell who's whacking who. While the 
characters flail at each other, one-liners and bad puns are tossed about 
like confetti. A few carefully placed jokes can set an action movie 
sailing, but too many wisecracks can undermine the momentum of a film. 
"Batman And Robin" doesn't merely lose momentum, it stalls out completely 
on several occasions. It's rare to see an action flick as sluggish as 
this one.</P>
<P>Ironically, the parts of "Batman And Robin" that work are the ones 
showing the characters in street clothing, and most of those succeed 
because of George Clooney as Bruce Wayne. Easily the best Batman yet, 
Clooney's expressive eyes and weary smile gives the character a sense of 
depth that the script doesn't even hint at. The film's most effective 
scene is a tender, quiet exchange between Clooney and Alfred (Michael 
Gough), Bruce Wayne's butler and surrogate father. </P>
<P>As for the other heroes, Chris O'Donnell's Robin is enthusiastic, perky 
and horny as hell, while pudgy Alicia Silverstone is hard to accept as an 
athlete in her debut as Batgirl. In a movie filled to the brim with major 
characters, the decision to add the entirely unnecessary Batgirl and Elle 
Macpherson as Bruce Wayne's girlfriend is puzzling. I suspect the 
producers inserted the women in an attempt to convince audiences that two 
guys who run around in rubber suits with built-in nipples, shapely 
buttocks and huge codpieces are actually straight.</P>
<P>Of course, the real stars of a Batman film are the villains and that's 
where "Batman And Robin" really suffers. As Mr. Freeze, Arnold 
Schwarzenegger gives his worst performance in years, spitting out a 
stream of lame catch phrases in wooden fashion. Laboring under a ton of 
appliances, Schwarzenegger looks as if he's having trouble even moving in 
his suit, let alone trying to act. Uma Thurman fares somewhat better as 
Poison Ivy. She overacts terribly in the early establishing scenes of her 
character (it's apparently a rule in the Batman series that before a 
person becomes a villain, s/he must be a cartoonish, bumbling nerd). Once 
Thurman transforms into the eco-psychotic Poison Ivy, she does a nice Mae 
West impersonation as a classic vamp who can seduce men with her breath 
and kill them with a kiss. Thurman fails to maintain the character's 
maniacal sense of style though, and ends up merely sputtering her way 
through the latter scenes of the film.</P>
<P>The biggest lesson to be learned from "Batman And Robin" is that more is 
not better. Joel Schumacher fills the screen with eye candy; but the 
Technicolor overkill merely emphasizes what a trifle the film really is. 
Some critics suggest that the Batman series has run out of steam. I don't 
think so. My prescription? Fire Joel Schumacher (but offer him a ticket 
to a rubber fetishist's convention so he'll understand that there's no 
hard feelings). Give Alicia Silverstone her walking papers, while keeping 
Clooney, O'Donnell and Michael Gough. Call Jack Nicholson and Michelle 
Pfieffer and beg them to reprise their roles as the Joker and Catwoman. 
Then, ditch the campiness and, for the love of Pete, lose the "Event" 
mentality and make a movie instead of a spectacle next time.</P>
