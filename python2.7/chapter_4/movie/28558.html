<PRE>"Tomb Raider" – Jolie is Jolly as Lara Croft
by Homer Yen
(c) 2001</PRE>
<P>How much you'll enjoy "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider" will
depend on a couple of things.  If you are an avid fan
of the buxom, video heroine and just can't get enough
of straining your fingers by pressing those tiny
buttons on your Nintendo handset, then you won't be
disappointed.  "LC:TR" offers lots of elaborate
sequences that game players can only wish that they
could execute on their video consoles.  The most
impressive scene features our heroine utilizing a
bungee cord to fend off a group of armed mercenaries
(and if I was trying to do this on the game console,
sweet Lara would have died a thousand times at my
control).  Also neat is the singular motion she
executes to reload the ammunition clips of her twin,
semi-automatic pistols.  </P>
<P>Meanwhile, movie watchers who are enrapt with special
effects extravaganzas and big film budgets like "Pearl
Harbor" or "The Mummy Returns" ("LC:TR" reportedly
cost $100 million to make), will have their hunger for
eye candy satiated.  This is probably the most
handsome looking film thus far this year.  Whether
Lara is battling stone statues come-to-life, exploring
some lost city, or fleeing though jungle foliage, the
film pays a great amount of attention to atmosphere. 
For example, most scenes are bathed in a golden luster
to connote a world of power and wealth, while locales
of adventure are draped with a mysterious fogginess. 
The team behind the art direction, set design, and
special effects deserves much applause.</P>
<P>So far, so good.  But what if you don't fall into
either of those two categories and your taste demands
more?  As long as that taste is for hot, buttered
popcorn, then you'll be fine.  LC:TR is a good summer
film.  But it's not much more.  It features separate
and distinct acts, each featuring cool combat or some
other action sequence.  It doesn't overcomplicate us
with plot.  And it gives us a great heroine who is
lithe and athletic.  The goth Jolie portrays her well,
bringing an alluring dimension of seriousness and
sexuality.</P>
<P>Lara Croft is James Bond and Indiana Jones rolled into
one.  Born into wealth and groomed at the most elite
schools, she has an appetite for adventure.  She
travels to dangerous locales around the globe in
search of lost crypts and long-forgotten empires.  Her
greatest quest, however, challenges her to find two
halves of an ancient artifact buried in space and
time.  So with her thigh-high holsters, body-hugging
outfits, and the help of her butler and a weapons
designer, she travels from England to Italy to
Cambodia and a few lost cities in between.  Luckily,
its brisk pace, it's watchable heroine, and the film's
gorgeous look makes us forget about the video
game-like plot.</P>
<P>What Lara Croft really lacks, however, is a soul. 
There is a noticeable lack of humanity in this film. 
Perhaps Croft comes across as so invulnerable that it
didn't matter who wanted to kill her or how many
people were going to try or what it meant if Lara
should fail.  But as this was adapted from a video
game, you can arguably say that the film kept its
spirit intact.  Fans certainly won't be disappointed. 
All others may feel something lacking.</P>
