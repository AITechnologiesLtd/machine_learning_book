<PRE>                                 RADIO DAYS
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>***</PRE>
<P>        This Woody Allen film is like no other -- a nostalgic 
collection of vignettes about the now-ancient days of radio, when 
the imagination provided the visuals and physically unattractive 
people could succeed in the entertainment world on the basis of 
a strong voice alone. For instance, the voice of the Masked Avenger 
superhero in RADIO DAYS is the short, bald, "Inconceivable!" 
guy from THE PRINCESS BRIDE. And maybe Woody's trying 
to make a point about his fondness for radio by staying out of 
the camera's view for the entire movie, serving only as 
narrator.</P>
<P>        The main character is Woody Jr., a kid named Joe 
(played by Seth Green) whose grades are slipping because he's 
always listening to the radio. When his mom points this out, he 
replies that she's constantly listening to the radio too, she says 
it's different because she's already ruined her life and he's got the 
rest of his ahead of him. That means plenty of time to do 
mischevious little kid things like using collection money for Israel 
to buy a Masked Avenger decoder ring.</P>
<P>        Woody throws in a lot of stories about the radio stars 
themselves, mostly about the coat check girl (Mia Farrow) and 
her slow rise to stardom, from singing laxative jingles ("X marks 
the spot") to being interrupted during her radio debut by the 
bombing of Pearl Harbor ("Who's she?"). Farrow's role this time 
around is as more of a dumb blond than her usual sensitive, 
emotional type.</P>
<P>        Other favorite Allen actors appear in Radio Days, like 
Danny Aiello and Jeff Daniels (PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO), 
Dianne Wiest (Hannah and Her Bullets Over 
Broadway), Tony Roberts (Annie Hall's Sex Comedy) 
and Diane Keaton (Manhattan Bananas). It's large scale vaudeville 
type entertainment, including reenactments of different radio shows 
and musical numbers. Eight years later, a movie called THE 
RADIOLAND MURDERS would try to do a very similar thing 
and instead fall flat on its face. If THE LAST ACTION HERO 
has proven anything, it's that you don't rip off Woody Allen.</P>
