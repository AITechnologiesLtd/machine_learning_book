<PRE>                                MAGNOLIA
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Sooner or later, every director makes his SHORT CUTS.</P>
<P>     Paul Thomas Anderson (BOOGIE NIGHTS) only waiting until his third
film to make his, an over-three-hour epic with at least 10 major
characters in almost as many separate story lines.  And thanks to those
characters, every one a rich mystery burning with secrets, MAGNOLIA is a
smashing success.</P>
<P>     MAGNOLIA has one of the greatest openings I've ever seen in a
film.  Narrated by Ricky Jay, who also has a small role in the movie, we
are led through a few short examples of strange coincidence, allegedly
real events from the past.  Whether or not they are true (one involves
the old story of a boy who attempts suicide by jumping from his roof,
only to be shot in the stomach by accident on the way down, thus being
murdered), they set the tone for the far more bizarre events to come.</P>
<P>     And again, it's those characters that drive MAGNOLIA along.  There
are far too many players to list, but the highlights include Julianne
Moore as the unhinged and much-younger bride of a dying older man.
William H. Macy as a once-famous 1960's quiz show star, now an
unemployable loser.  Tom Cruise as Frank "T.J." Mackey, an over-the-top
guru of female seduction.  And my favorite, John C. Reilly as a bumbling
and lovelorn LAPD officer looking for a meaningful relationship -- on
the job.  How these characters all come together is what makes MAGNOLIA
so much fun.</P>
<P>     It's unfortunate that the sheer, ass-numbing length of MAGNOLIA
tends to drag it down at times.  Most annoying is the fact that Anderson
gives virtually every character a long, drawn-out soliloquy to speak.
Invariably these are lost on an audience more interested in keeping the
plot moving.  There's even an inexplicable moment toward the end of the
movie when all the characters sing along to a song on the radio
together, although none of them are in the same place.  As an old friend
of mine would say, "What's up with THAT!?"</P>
<P>     And of course, as with any three-hour movie, maintaining a solid
theme from beginning to end is tough.  MAGNOLIA rolls its opening
credits to the tune of "One Is the Loneliest Number" and begins as a
study of exactly that.  By the end, it's become a movie about redemption
and forgiveness, a trend that PULP FICTION launched and has since been
done to death in countless films.</P>
<P>     And that's too bad, because otherwise MAGNOLIA is a world-class
film that would have been a shoo-in for the best of the year.</P>
