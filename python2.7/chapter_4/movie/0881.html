<PRE>                               THE RUSSIA HOUSE
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1990 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  Colorless spy story keeps promising to
     pay off with something happening, but plot twists are a long
     time coming.  Photography in Russia tries to make it look
     exotic and interesting, but the rather drab cities are not
     the best photographic subjects.  Rating: 0 (-4 to +4).</P>
<P>     At the beginning of THE RUSSIA HOUSE three notebooks purportedly
containing Soviet military secrets have been passed to a British publisher
and the British want to know if the notebooks are genuine.  An hour and
forty minutes into THE RUSSIA HOUSE we have seen a lot of Russian scenery,
we know some of the characters involved a little better, a fourth notebook
has been passed, and now the Americans as well as the British want to know
if the notebooks are genuine.  That may well be how the spy business really
is, but it really is not a very good piece of story-telling.  It would be
one thing if the evidence built up in an interesting way the way it did in a
previous LeCarre adaptation, TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY.  But here we are
dealing with far less than compelling characters.  The two main characters
are Sean Connery as British publisher Barley Blair and Michelle Pfeiffer as
Soviet publisher Katya.  Katya passes the notebooks written by a former
lover Klaus Maria Brandauer as the enigmatic Dante.  Barley and Blair seem
to fall in love for reasons never very clear.  This has to be a what's-the-
attraction love pairing to rival the one in HAVANA.</P>
<P>     Fred Schepisi has taken a script that would move moderately well at
thirty minutes and stretched it to a hundred and twenty-three.  One way that
he has stretched it is to show you the scenery of Russia, mostly Moscow and
Leningrad.  This plays off the new post-glasnost interest in the Soviet
Union; however, it seems unlikely this film will greatly contribute to
Soviet tourism.  While many of the buildings are of majestic design, the
film only underscored the drabness of Russia.  That drabness is further
emphasized by filming Russia with perpetually overcast skies.  The film also
unsells tourism by underscoring how much the economy has degraded under
glasnost.  As Katya complains, "Glasnost gives everyone the right to
complain and accuse, but it doesn't make shoes."  Curiously, Katya manages
to be able to get plenty of eye make-up, as Michelle Pfeiffer's characters
always do.</P>
<P>     What is curious about the uninteresting background is that the
screenplay is by Tom Stoppard, who made Shanghai mystical and fascinating in
his screenplay for EMPIRE OF THE SUN.  Here, however, he tries to show us
not a physical landscape but the figurative landscape of the world of
espionage and counter-espionage.  LeCarre can make that landscape
interesting, but it does not come through in Stoppard's screenplay.  I like
Stoppard and LeCarre, but I hope they realize they are no good for each
other.  I rate their result a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
