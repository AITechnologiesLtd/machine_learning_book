<P>My jaded snarkasm is, I think, my biggest movie-watching handicap.  Let
one teeny bit of nonsense be shown on screen - like, say, the portrayal
of an Honest Politician - and WHOOSH; the air just squirts right outta
my Disbelief's Suspension, sending it tumbling...</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
The Clinton era is over, yet there's another Democratic White House -
with Yet Another Sex Scandal on its hands: this time, involving an
ex-Republican of the female persuasion.</P>
<P>The Vice-President Of The United States has died, and President Jackson
Evans (Jeff Bridges) searches for a replacement amongst his Democratic
party.  A candidate, Governor Jack Hathaway (William L. Petersen), is
proposed after he heroically tries to rescue a woman whose car crashes
into the river in which he's fishing.  But the shadow of Ted Kennedy is
cast much too wide for Hathaway to escape, and Evans and his Chief Of
Staff, Kermit Newman (Sam Elliott), reject Hathaway on the basis of
possible misperception and potential innuendo.</P>
<P>Wanting someone who Looks Good above all, Evans - much to the dismay of
Newman and fellow staffer Jerry Tolliver (Saul Rubinek) - decides on
naming Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen) as his new VP.   Insisting that
the reason for not wanting Hanson in the number two spot has nothing to
do with her gender, but that she certainly wouldn't be appointed "just
because" she's a woman, young Democratic Senator Reginald Webster
(Christian Slater)  seeks out Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman), the
Republican chairman running the VP confirmation committee, asking if he
could be part of Runyon's committee.  Before the conformation hearings
begin (using tactics that "even the FBI wouldn't touch"), Runyon and
Webster discover that Hanson may have had a Sordid Past: as a college
freshman, she was rumored to have been part of a fraternity/sorority
gang-bang.  Armed with that knowledge, Webster, and especially Runyon,
set out to destroy any chance of Hanson ever seeing the White House from
the Seat Of Power.</P>
<P>The Upshot:
Like NURSE BETTY before it, THE CONTENDER was chock full of good
performances leading to a dead-end.  Joan Allen, one of the best parts
of the movie PLEASANTVILLE, was excellent as the downtrodden,
too-good-to-be-true Senator Hanson [which reminds me: if she was already
a Senator, why did the scandal not break when she was running for that
office?  Silly me, asking logical questions again].  Gary Oldman, as the
sleazy slimy Shelly Runyon, sent chills down my spine.  Once again, he
submersed himself fully into a role in which he acts and looks
completely different from his previous roles; why his name isn't brought
up when his contemporaries like Streep and DeNiro are mentioned, is
beyond me.  In two strong supporting roles, Christian Slater's naive
junior Senator, and especially Sam Elliott as Kermit [Kermit?  WTF???]
Newman, often Own the scenes they're in.  And even though Jeff Bridges'
food-obsessed version of the President was too comical for me to get
behind, he was Clinton-esque enough to be believable throughout the
first 100 or so minutes of this flick.</P>
<P>So why'd THE CONTENDER fail to get the 3BC equivalent of two thumbs up?
This movie was like the best passage in dancehall tune: the passage
itself may be great, but in the end, the song just repeats one phrase
over and over.</P>
<P>The "one-phrase" in "Contender" split itself in two: on the low octave,
it's "Republicans Are Bad, Mean/And Ugly Too"; and in the high register,
it's "Look At The Honest Politician Done Wrong/And Taking It Up The
Wazoo".  And both notes, hit repeatedly and fair loudly, were enough to
deaden my eardrum. Especially with that "Honest Politician" bit.  The
light went out on that search a long time ago.</P>
<P>THE CONTENDER was a slow-starter, picked up with a twist near the
three-quarters mark, and comes complete with a Big! Speech! reminiscent
of Michael Douglas' turn in THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT.  In this, it's very
much like the political campaign of the GoreBush morph Borg: it looks
like it's saying something Real, but it's really just mouthing the words
without any real feeling.</P>
<P>The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
Setting aside the fact that, unless I misremember, the only speaking
part a Black actor got in THE CONTENDER was that of a White House waiter
[and how's that for a rosy outlook of Our role in the Democratic
future?], let's focus on The Female Factor and how it comes back to The
Black Factor, shall we?</P>
<P>What peaked my curiosity most is that, in some ways, the words "Female"
and "Black" could be used interchangeably in this movie; couldn't you
just hear those Senators saying "I don't mind that he's Black, but I
won't vote for him simply because of that!", or even better, "This is
what comes of Affirmative Action!", and meaning the same thing aimed at
a White woman or a Black man? And yes, I know that there are actually
Black women in relatively high-ranking political positions; but get
real: besides that nutcase that the equally nutcased Pat Buchanon has as
a running-mate, do you really think that an American presidential
candidate is anywhere near ready for a Black woman as the Vice
button-pusher?</P>
<P>Terms being somewhat interchangeable or not, though, I doubt that a
political movie that did interchange them would ever be made.  Unless it
was a Black movie.  Make that, a Black comedy. Starring the Wayans
Brothers as Stepin and Fetchit.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
My lack of respect for the whole of American Politicians having informed
my Suspension Of Disbelief that it was time to give up the ghost, I just
couldn't take this movie at face value.  THE CONTENDER was a pretender
to the throne.  An idealistic pretender, sure; but I defy anyone to find
a Senator Laine Hanson hiding out inside any of the corrupted charlatans
who are our elected representatives.  grumble.</P>
<P>THE CONTENDER (rating: flashing yellowlight):
Hey, I think I'm on to something: "The Pretender" is a much better title
for a portrayal of an Honest Politician, eh?</P>
