                       A film review by Michael Redman
                        Copyright 1997 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Heading to his 10-year high school reunion, Martin Blank (John Cusack)
is having something of an early mid-life career crisis. It seems that
his chosen profession of hitman-for-hire just isn't as emotionally
rewarding as he would like for it to be. He's even seeing therapist Dr.
Oatman (Alan Arkin) who's so afraid of him that the sessions are
monologues.</P>
<P>At the urging of his office manager Marcella (sister Joan Cusack) and
Oatman, Blank decides to attend the reunion and patch things up with his
high-school sweetheart that he stood up for the prom just before he
disappeared from sight for a decade. Conveniently he also has a hit
scheduled nearby.</P>
<P>Once back in town, he discovers that you really can't go home again;
especially if they've built a Stop And Rob on the site. He does find his
ex though. Suspicious Debi (Minnie Driver) appropriately keeps him at
arm's length as she perfects her "Don't! Stop! Don't! Stop! Don't stop!
Don't stop!" routine. Odd chemistry that works well on occasion.</P>
<P>To further complicate matters there are several uninvited guests in
town. Rival assassin Grocer (Dan Aykroyd) is attempting to start a
hitman union and Blank doesn't want to join. Grocer decides to
exterminate the scab in the time-honored tradition of the vocation.
Another killer is hanging out to eliminate Blank. Two G-Men are trailing
our hero waiting for him to strike. It's a crowded little rich suburb.</P>
<P>The film milks the most out of every situation. High school reunions are
inherently ripe with comedic possibilities. People who knew each other
for a few years as kids and haven't been in touch for years are
desperate to impress. As everyone else is bragging about their adult
careers, Blank is upfront about his and receives remarkably blase'
responses: "Good for you. Growth industry." </P>
<P>The dialog is thickly layered. You have to pay attention to catch
everything that is going on as often more than one character is talking
at the same time. When that's not happening, the retorts come fast and
furious. Much of the subtle humor is easy to miss if you're careless.</P>
<P>Despite the commercials promising a light romantic comedy, there's a
very dark tint to the story. At the same time that Cusack's murderer has
us rolling in the aisles, he's killing a gunman by stabbing him with a
ball point pen. Grocer and Blank shoot at each other with a gun in each
hand in a scene (unfortunately, more than one) straight out of a Clint
Eastwood western while blasting away others. The extreme violence goes
hand in hand with the extreme wit.</P>
<P>Although the humor is of the highest level, the movie doesn't provoke
much psychological involvement. Even with her standoffishness, there
isn't much guesswork involved in figuring out if Martin and Debi will
get together. Will Blank survive? You can probably figure it out. Cusack
is a tad too cool for me to care much about him.</P>
<P>But it doesn't matter very much. The comedy is king here and the
characters secondary. Check it out. Watch and listen closely and you'll
be entertained. And that's what you're going to this film for.</P>
