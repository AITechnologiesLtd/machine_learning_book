<P>In Tim Burton's `Sleepy Hollow', there is a mysterious Headless Horseman
who decapitates residents of the small town of the same name. He rides a
beautiful black steed and carries an imposing sword that cauterizes the
wound of his victims with an immediate swipe. Burton's update on
Washington Irving's classic tale of `The Legend of Sleepy Hollow' offers
us the mystery of the Horseman, when the screenplay should have merely
settled on the aspect of the horror. Writer Andrew Kevin Walker
(`Seven') throws in perhaps too healthy a dosage of Sherlock Holmes, but
the visual treatment of the film is absolutely entrancing, as Burton
offers foggy locales and detailed costumes that are gorgeous and
stirring to examine.</P>
<P>As `Sleepy Hollow' opens, we're greeted with a juicy cameo from Martin
Landau, who won an Oscar in Burton's `Ed Wood'. Landau plays a prominent
citizen of Sleepy Hollow, who, on a fateful carriage ride through the
forest, is decapitated by an unseen horseback rider. After two more
murders haunt the residents of the quaint little town, Constable Ichabod
Crane (Johnny Depp) is sent in to investigate. Landlord Baltus Von
Tassel (Michael Gambon) explains to Crane that the heads have been
severed from the carcass and mysteriously taken in each separate case,
and that they believe the murderer is a dead Hessian trooper (played
briefly by a wonderfully jarring Christopher Walken) who has risen from
the grave after being decapitated in the Western Woods. Crane is not a
man of great superstition, and is determined to root out the human
culprit with his assortment of gizmos and gadgets (things I was not
surprised to find in a Tim Burton movie).</P>
<P>First and foremost, `Sleepy Hollow' is a fun horror film. As with
virtually all Burton movies, we are treated to a wonderful score by
composer Danny Elfman, who has once again poured excitement and
imagination into an atmospheric soundtrack that accentuates the gothic
mood perfectly. The Horseman F/X are stylish and impressive,
particularly in perfectly blended battle sequences involving actual
actors. But why did I enjoy `Sleepy Hollow' as much as I did? Although
enjoyable, it was not the numerous beheadings and the plentiful gore
that spurted left and right.. It was the light comic touch that Burton
applied. The film has the sweetness of a candy apple, usually channeled
through Depp's wonderful performance as the lovable geek Ichabod Crane,
who is no longer a mild-mannered school teacher but still attains his
cowardly qualities.</P>
<P>This is certainly not the only alteration that's been made. As the film
progresses, it becomes apparent that Walker is more concerned with the
mystery of the murders than the murders themselves. The momentum is
slowed considerably once Crane begins piecing the mystery together,
because for the audience, it's not an issue we particularly wish to be
solved. It's more effective for the Headless Horseman to be an elusive
demon than an elusive demon with an ulterior motive. Still, we are still
captivated by the breathtaking technical detail and Burton's keen eye to
capture our attention. The costuming is exceptional, and the dialogue is
crisp and effective throughout (it's recognizable that the script was
refined by award-winning playwright Tom Stoppard).</P>
<P>The supporting cast exhibits more color and playfulness than many. A
blonde Christina Ricci is in fine form as Von Tassel's daughter Katrina,
and an unlikely romance between she and Ichabod is surprisingly
consistent. Walken, Michael Gough (who appeared in Burton's `Batman'
films) and Miranda Richardson are all enjoyable in tackling their
separate roles. I suppose the strengths behind `Sleepy Hollow' lie
within the central trio: director Burton, Constable Depp and the
Headless Horseman who hunts him down with ruthless accuracy.</P>
<P>All of this is not to be taken seriously, of course. `Sleepy Hollow' is
a lavish, frightening and altogether amusing reworking of a classic tale
that many people cherished as children. If you've got a decent head on
your shoulders, you'll have the good sense to gallop off to the theater
and enjoy it one last time.</P>
