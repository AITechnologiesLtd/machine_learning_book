<P>Semi-remake of the 1973 film, THE DAY OF THE JACKAL, this thriller
about the internationally renowned terrorist known as "The Jackal" is
brought to us by director Michael Caton-Jones, famous for 1995's ROB
ROY and THIS BOY'S LIFE (8/10) with the young Leo DiCaprio. This was
one of two "Jackal" films to come out in 1997. The other was THE
ASSIGNMENT (7/10) starring Aidan Quinn.</P>
<P>PLOT:
The Russian mob hires the Jackal to assassinate someone high up the
U.S. political ranks. The FBI and Russian police work together to
identify, find and arrest the Jackal, but come up empty. With few
alternatives remaining, they recruit help from a jailed Irish terrorist
who has already seen and met the Jackal. This is when the international
chase begins.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Overlong, action-less, semi-interesting but mostly boring so-called
"thriller" which showcases some solid acting performances by Poitier
and Gere, but does very little else to keep the audience awake. I have
not seen the original movie upon which this movie was based, but word
on the street is that it is one of the best thrillers ever! This film
on the other hand, has very few thrills in it, a couple of small scenes
of action, and sprinkles of intrigue. It's basically just a chase movie
that reminded me a lot of THE SAINT (7/10), with all of the clever
costume changes, and THE PEACEMAKER (5.5/10), with its cat-and-mouse
hunt around the world.</P>
<P>I was pleasantly surprised to find Richard Gere finally stretching his
acting abilities by actually playing a character other than a rich,
smug guy in a nice suit! I also liked his Irish accent and his
ever-popular salt-and-pepper hair. Sidney Poitier also lent some much
needed credibility to this project, and pulled off a strong performance
as the FBI agent struggling to find the Jackal. Willis didn't do much,
but it wasn't really his fault, since the script didn't really call for
him to do much more than switch disguises every now and again (Oh yeah,
and he also got his Canadian accent down pat, by adding an "aye" at the
end of his sentences.)</P>
<P>Despite all of these negative points, and the film lasting about thirty
minutes past its welcome, I wasn't totally bored at any point, and did
like the international aspect of the plot. I also dug the fact that the
final scene of the movie was shot in the exact Metro station that I
used to stand in every day of my life for three years during my years
of College. Ahhhh yes...the sweet, sweet memories. But enough about me!
The bottom line is that this thriller does not provide many thrills or
suspense, but does offer a semi-interesting plot and some decent
performances from Poitier and Gere. Having said that, if you want to
see a better Jackal movie, toss some coins the way of THE ASSIGNMENT
(7/10), and have yourself a good time!</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
This film was originally slated to be released as THE DAY OF THE
JACKAL, but was later changed.
Bruce Willis' full name is Walter Bruce Willis. He was born on the 19th
of March 1955, in Idar-Oberstein, West Germany. His song "Respect
Yourself" reached number five on the music charts in January of 1987.
Bruce received US$15Million dollars for his role in ARMAGEDDON
(7.5/10), and US$5Million for his role in the original DIE HARD (8/10).
He had three children with his ex-wife Demi Moore (they divorced in
1998 after 11 years of marital bliss). Their names are Rumer, Scout
Larue and Tallulah Belle.
Bruce grew up in New Jersey and waited tables and tended bar for a
living until he began to get roles in plays. He broke into the business
when he was seen tending bar in New York by a casting director who
liked his personality & needed a bartender for a small movie role.
Christopher Reeve was offered US$1Million for the lead role in AMERICAN
GIGOLO (6.5/10), but turned it down. John Travolta also turned down the
lead in this film (which later went to Richard Gere), and AN OFFICER
