<P>**1/2 (out of 4 = OK)

[drama]
starring: Holly Hunter (Ada), Harvey Kietel (Baines), Sam Neill (Stewart),
Anna Paquin (Flora), produced by Jan Chapman, written and directed by Jane
Campion.</P>
<P>"The Piano" is a good movie but not a great movie. Taking into consideration
the elements that make up this film, it's not much more than a Victorian soap
opera, full of passion, seduction, sex, and violence. It's interesting and
well acted, but the elements that make it up and push it along aren't
anything special.
The setting is 18th Century New Zealand with Holly Hunter starring as Ada, a
pale but beautiful widow who has been arranged to marry someone she has never
seen in a country she has never been to. She also brings along her daughter
Flora (Paquin), who provides for some of the film's best moments.
Ada cannot talk, she speaks through sign language and by playing her piano.
But Stewart (Neill), her new husband, won't let her bring it into the house.
The piano is the major plot element and metaphor for just about everyone and
everything in this film. It shows how music reflects and defines mood and
attitude. When Ada is happy she plays a flowing, beautiful song, and when she
is angry she slams the keys and hits the deep notes.
Stewart is a shy and withdrawn man, he is not cruel, but he just doesn't
know how to handle the situation. His co-worker Baines (Keitel) is the
typical brute with a heart of gold, he can't read but he does understand what
art and beauty are. When he hears Ada's piano he adores the music and buys it
from Stewart and agrees to sell it back to Ada one key at a time if she
teaches him how to play. 
As Ada tries to play for Baines, he keeps making sexual demands. This
element is definitely erotic because of what it doesn't show, as it is an era
when woman wore layers of clothes - just getting one layer off would excite a
man. This is the kind of passion we don't usually get to see, and Campion
films with careful craftsmanship and detail.
The way that Hunter portrays this character, it doesn't seem like Ada likes
Baines. She is just using him to get her piano back, so they're both being
shallow. But when she does get it back, she throws herself at him and they
make love. I was totally confused, it seemed like she hated him, now she
loves him? 
Then the story becomes a glamorous soap opera as Stewart finds out about Ada
and Baines and spies on them. He chops off one of Ada's fingers and sends it
to Baines via Flora. The ending is predictable and not very appealing.
Overall, "The Piano" was somewhat enjoyable, very well acted, but much too
eloquent in its attitude.</P>
