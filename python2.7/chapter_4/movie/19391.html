<P>SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT (M).  
(Warner Bros/Village Roadshow)
Director: Trey Parker
Stars: voices of Trey Parker, Matt Stone, Mary Kay Bergman, Isaac Hayes, 
George Clooney, Minnie 
Driver, Brent Spiner, Eric Idle, Dave Foley, Mike Judge, Stewart 
Copeland, Jennifer Howell
Running time: 80 minutes.</P>
<P>With this feature length version of the cult animated series
South Park, creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have deliberately
pushed the envelope.  Although aimed at adult audiences, South Park
has developed a strong following among younger audiences, much to the
horror of parents and cultural experts.  The animation definitely
lacks sophistication, but Parker and Stone more than make up for their
simplistic style with their razor sharp wit and wickedly off beat and
profane sense of humour.</P>
<P>The pair also possess an iconoclastic sense of humour.  In
this energetic and irreverent farce they target a number of familiar
figures, including America's premier acting family the Baldwins,
Winona Ryder, talk show host Conan O'Brien, and billionaire computer
geek Bill Gates.  A heavyweight cast, including George Clooney, Minnie
Driver, Brent Spiner and Eric Idle, also lend their vocal talents to
the film.</P>
<P>The film's defiantly politically incorrect humour is laced
with obvious racist and homophobic overtones.  However, despite its
subversive nature, South Park also resonates with positive messages
about tolerance, understanding and family values.  South Park
highlights the hypocrisy and dichotomy of American movie censorship,
in which massive violence and wanton destruction are okay, but sex and
profanity are a definite no-no.</P>
<P>When the fragile little minds of the children of this sleepy
Colorado mining town are endangered by an adult movie starring cult
heroes Terrance and Philip, South Park is in an uproar.  The disturbed
mothers unite to save their sons' morals and launch a campaign to
blame Canada.  Cartman is even implanted with an electronic chip that
sends out an electrical charge whenever he swears.  However,
censorship and censure soon leads to war between the US and Canada.
Meanwhile, Saddam Hussein and the devil, who are depicted in a cosy
relationship in hell, eagerly await their chance to dominated the
world.  Eventually, common sense prevails and peace returns to this
sleepy little mountain community.</P>
<P>South Park: Bigger, Longer And Uncut also features a number of
superb musical numbers, which is an obvious departure from the tv
series.  This can only be interpreted as a deliberate move by the
creators to send up those quaint and wholesome Disney movies so
admired by the previous generation.  The movie begins innocently
enough with a simple song that seemingly sings the praises of life in
this small mountain town, but it quickly reveals its darker intent.
The film features a number of decidedly catchy tunes that will help
sell soundtrack CDs by the truckload, even if their lyrics ensure they
won't receive commercial airplay.</P>
<P>South Park: Bigger, Longer And Uncut certainly crams plenty
into its brisk 80 minutes.  However, this hugely entertaining but
ribald film never outstays its welcome.  Even those unacquainted with
the popular series will find a lot to enjoy in this hilarious feature
length version.</P>
