<PRE>A SIMPLE PLAN (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong

<P>When I read Scott B. Smith's book A Simple Plan, I was enthralled with the
book almost all the way up to the end. When I heard that a film based on
the book was coming out, I was excited to see it.  Is this film as good as
the book?  And did it live up to my expectations?</P>
<P>One winter day, two brothers, Hank (Bill Paxton) and Jacob Mitchell (Billy
Bob Thornton), and Jacob's friend, Lou, find a crashed plane in a snowy
field. What they find inside the plane is intriguing: a duffle bag with
$4.4 million dollars in it. What does one do? What would you do? These
three strike a deal, a simple plan to keep the money. They take the money
and hide it until summer comes. When the snow melts and someone finds the
plane, they'll see if anyone is looking for the money. If not, they split
the money between themselves.</P>
<P>Sounds easy enough, but three's a crowd – and we all know how hard it is to
keep a secret between three people. To make matters worse Jacob and Lou are
drunkards and don't have well and stable lives like Hank. Jacob and Lou are
poor and with every passing day that money looks more enticing to split
early. A Simple Plan follows Hank who before the money, lived a fairly
normal life. His wife (Bridget Fonda) is pregnant with their first child
and he holds a stable job at a local feed store as an accountant. But, the
large amount of money is just too big a draw for everyone involved and the
simple plan starts to unravel rather quickly. Lines are drawn, sides are
picked, and eventually everything is spinning out of control. All moral
beliefs that the characters might have held fall to the wayside in order to
clear a path to the money. This movie is a superb look at ordinary people
stuck in an extraordinary situation.</P>
<P>The script by Scott B. Smith fixes all the flaws that were in his book. The
biggest of them was the ending of the book. The ending in the book gets way
out of hand and goes overboard into absurdity. In the film, Smith writes a
more believable and satisfying ending. Kudos to Smith for translating an
already impressive book into an even better film.</P>
<P>Sam Raimi is best known for his more eccentric work like the Evil Dead
series and Darkman. With A Simple Plan, Raimi graduates into the more
serious side of filmmaking and also expands into a genre with a wider
audience. Not lost though is Raimi's style. He has a very distinct style in
his films; the offbeat humour and the subtly over-the-top feeling in some
situations. Two strong images that Raimi introduces in the film are the
opening chicken-fox images and the continuous one of the crow. I hate
talking about symbolism, but the crow was a particularly effective one.
"They just wait till something dies," one of the characters observes. Using
the crows, Raimi and Smith makes a simple observation that these characters
are not driven by evil, but they are driven by nature.</P>
<P>Bill Paxton is a face that most people recognize but can't connect to a
name. He's an actor who does a lot of supporting roles (Titanic, True Lies)
and sometimes he holds a leading role (Twister). With A Simple Plan he
should gain that much needed name/face recognition that he deserves. His
performance in A Simple Plan is right on the nose from what I thought his
character was like in the book.</P>
<P>Billy Bob Thornton, like always, gives a wonderful performance. The look
that he adopts for A Simple Plan is absolutely revolting, but strangely
enough it works. Thornton is able to make us sympathetic to him, even
though we see that his character is a lazy drunk.</P>
<P>Fonda is not given as much to do in the film as her character had in the
book. In the book her character is changed from sweet and innocent to
conniving and sneaky. And although this change does happen in the film, it
doesn't happen as well as it did in the book.</P>
<P>The cinematography and film score are worth mentioning. The cinematography
by Alar Kivilo is gorgeous. The snow fields are most memorable, but there
are small moments like the one in Jacob's apartment that stand out. The
film score by Danny Elfman is brilliant. Subtly urging the audience in
different directions, Elfman writes a score that fits the film like a
glove. Although this score is not as good as some of Elfman's other works,
Batman and Midnight Run for example, it is a score to remember.</P>
<P>A Simple Plan is not simply a good movie. A Simple Plan is one of the best
movies I've seen so far this year. Don't Miss A Simple Plan on the big screen.</P>
<P>[Rated R for violence and language. Running Time: 121 Minutes]</P>
