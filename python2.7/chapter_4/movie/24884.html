Running Time: 81 minutes </P>
<P>Screwed stars Norm MacDonald as a much put-upon butler whose boss
(Elaine Stritch) treats him like a slave.  When he finally feels as
though he can't take the abuse anymore, he and his dim-witted friend
(Dave Chappelle) launch a scheme to kidnap the woman's dog and hold it
for ransom.  This leads to a bizarre chain of events that leads
authorities to believe that MacDonald himself has been kidnapped, and
that the ransom for his return is $5 million. </P>
<P>Written and directed by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, who wrote
the excellent biopics Ed Wood, The People vs. Larry Flynt, and Man on
the Moon.  Their work here however more resembles their scripts for
drivel like the first two Problem Child movies and the remake of That
Darn Cat.  There are some funny moments in Screwed, but the majority of
them come thanks to the performances of the actors and not from the
material itself.  (One odd thing of note about the script is that all
the names of the main characters are all variations of lesser known U.S.
Presidents.) </P>
<P>The story just isn't as sharp as it should be.  The events in Screwed
only make sense in the film's own reality.  Here in the real world, any
police investigation (no matter how inept) would have the kidnapping
figured out in no time.  Also, there are two plot twists late in the
film that serve no other purpose but to make the audience say
"Ewwww...". </P>
<P>Norm MacDonald is one of the funniest people on the planet, but he's
just not in the right role here to display his comedic talents. 
MacDonald is at his best when he's being sarcastic, so casting him as a
poor hapless schmuck doesn't let him show his stuff.  Dave Chappelle is
another good comedian misused here.  Chappelle is able to carry limp
films like Half-Baked and steal movies like Blue Streak away from its
star, but like MacDonald he's just not given good material here to work
with.  Daniel Benzali (the bald guy from "Murder One"... to quote
"Saturday Night Live") overacts his role as the lead detective on the
case.  Everything in the film seems to exasperate his character to
cartoonish levels, and it renders his performance just too silly for the
film.  The thing is, had Benzali just played the role as he always plays
roles like this it would have been perfect.  I guess because he was
doing a comedy he felt he had to overdo it.  And I'm not even sure why
Danny DeVito (who makes a lot of "Penguin" noises in the film) thought
this was a good idea. </P>
<P>The most annoying thing about Screwed isn't how much of a disappointment
it is (although that is a close second)... it's how LOUD the film is. 
The music in the film (generic frantic music that plays at some point in
every single scene) is so exhaustingly obnoxious that it wore me out
just having to hear it.  Also, the film just degenerates into a shouting
match amongst the stars to see who can deliver their lines the loudest. 
Louder jokes aren't funnier jokes. </P>
<P>Screwed runs 81 minutes long, which leads me to the possible conclusion
of the dreaded "studio tampering".  Potential example of that: Danny
DeVito's character is the vice-president of the "Hawaii Five-O" fan
club.  Why?  It's adds nothing to his character and never really comes
into play in the film.  I doubt Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski
would write details for these characters without any rhyme or reason for
them.  Also, Screwed sat on the proverbial shelf for a long time after
completion and went through several title changes. </P>
<P>Everyone involved with this project has talent.  Somehow though it just
never came together as it should have.  So who ends up getting screwed
here?  The audience. </P>
