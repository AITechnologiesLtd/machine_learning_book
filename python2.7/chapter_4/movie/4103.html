<PRE>                             FANCI'S PERSUASION
                       A film review by Max Hoffmann
                        Copyright 1995 Max Hoffmann</PRE>
<P>     Touted as a chaotic fairy tale for the queer, urban world, FANCI'S
PERSUASION might more aptly be retitled GET OUT OF TOWN!  Because
that's exactly what you'd be doing if San Francisco even slightly
resembled the unwatchable mish mash captured by
Director/Writer/Producer Charles Herman-Wurmfeld.  If you're part of
the politically correct set that can't possibly criticize a queer film,
and just have to support it no matter what--my advice; go to this flick
stoned.</P>
<P>     The press kit claims this film celebrates the visual styles of
Pedro Almodovar and John Waters with a story loosely based on A
MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM.  The only thing missing is wit, humor and
talent.  As near as we can tell, a few cardboard cutouts of a
flamingos constitute the tribute to John Waters, and Almodovar is
honored with a few garishly painted walls in some Mission District
flats and intricate hair-dos.</P>
<P>     The film falls several yards short of being high camp enough to
entertain on an unintended level.  Frequent black-and-white dream
segments might have caused a few titters, if they weren't so damned
embarrassing.  Most of the performances invoke the same type of painful
embarrassment you feel for a neighbor's talentless child who's goaded
into an impromptu recital.</P>
<P>     Cinematographer David Rush Morrison spins gaudy images that
resemble a film student's homage to Andy Warhol.  However unsteadily the
camera may be held, it's an irresistible attraction for the actors, who
are more than just a little aware of its presence.</P>
<P>     Drag superstar Justin Bond is utterly wasted in the role of the
vicious mother to lesbian bride wanna-be, Fanci (Jessica Patton).  The
title character is surely the most annoying screen presence this side
of Pippi Longstocking.  Fanci's intended, Lorretta (Boa) is yet another
screen version of a black lesbian that can't let "butch" and talent
coexist in the same frame.</P>
<P>     The plot: A mysterious spell falls over San Francisco, causing
power outages, and unlikely sexual liaisons.  Will the marriage vows be
spoken? asks the press kit.  The answer is a resounding: who cares!</P>
<P>     A butt-numbing 80 minutes of incomprehensible sound and image can
be yours at San Francisco's Red Vic Theatre October 5 & 6.  FANCI'S
PERSUASION will crop up regularly at Midnight showings around the
country.</P>
