<P>   They say that travel is broadening.  Taking a journey
outside of your home state exposes you to cultures and life
styles other than your own.  This is true.  Travel has the
added benefit of allowing you to turn inward as well, affording
new perspectives on your life and home and your
relationships with your loved ones.  "The Out-of-Towners"
seeks to prove this premise.  This is the story of a marriage
which has fallen into a rut when the last of the children
leaves the nest, and how a journey of just a few hundred
miles bequeaths to its two pilgrims some new perspectives
not so much on cultures outside of their own provincial town
but on their very own connection to each other.  </P>
<P>   Neil Simon's play was first adapted to the screen some
thirty years ago.  That screen version featured Jack Lemmon
and Sandy Dennis as two people married two score and four
years, whose trip from Ohio to New York is charged with so
many blemishes that the very disasters serve to strengthen
their marriage.  Full of dated humor even then, the 1970
version directed by Arthur Hiller would not appear a fitting
vehicle for a sequel.  Nor can two of our finest comic actors,
Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn, breathe life into this tired
concoction of predictable country-mouse-visits-the-big-city
theme. Though Marc Lawrence's version changes some of
the details of the Hiller interpretation, the structure remains
intact and so does the outmoded humor.  In fact Steve
Martin, whose talent for portraying what showbiz biographer
Ephraim Katz calls "his likeable, self-mocking split personae,
forever wavering between vulnerability and overconfidence,
between frenzied cheeriness and pathetic heartbreak," fails to
ignite the screen, owing to director Sam Weisman's
incapacity at comic timing.  Nor does Martin develop much
chemistry with Ms. Hawn who, despite being almost exactly
the same age as the prematurely gray Martin, could virtually
pass for his daughter.</P>
<P>   The story is propelled by a job interview that Ohio resident
Henry Clark (Steve Martin) has with a mid-town Manhattan
advertising agency.  As his daughter had left the nest some
time back and his son has just followed suit, Henry and his
wife of 27 years, Nancy (Goldie Hawn), are vaguely
uncomfortable.  What will they now have to talk about?  The
excursion to the Big Apple gives them enough material to
keep their conversation flowing for years to come.</P>
<P>   During the relatively brief duration of the movie, Henry and
Nancy suffer a diversion of their flight to Boston; a missed
train connection; lost luggage; a Manhattan mugging from a
man whom they believe to be Andrew Lloyd Webber; a failure
to get a hotel room given their lack of money; a zany therapy
session into which they have wandered; and stomachs
growling with insatiable hunger.  They are chased by police
on horseback; are observed having sex in Central Park by
New York's mayor (played by Rudy as himself); and dangle
dangerously on a hotel veranda twenty-two stories above the
city.  </P>
<P>   While Neil Simon's show was never one of his better
efforts, the work should have been left interred along with
several other frolics of the world's most economically
successful playwright, along with "The Odd Couple" and
"Barefoot in the Park."  John Cleese turns in an encouraging
performance as a cynical clerk in a posh Manhattan hotel--
recreating his role as Basil Fawlty on one of TV's most
rollicking comedies.  But his high-kicking dance in drag is as
antiquated today as is Steve Martin's duck-walking romp on
city streets while high on speed, waddling to the soundtrack
beat of "The Age of Aquarius."</P>
<P>   A few scenes, nevertheless, begin to catch fire, particularly
one involving the couple's attempted theft of a New York
Times outside an apartment door (reminiscent of Jack
Lemmon's similar aspiration in "The Prisoner of Second
Avenue") and a sex therapy session that could have come
out of the Bob Newhart TV show, featuring Cynthia Nixon as
a nymphomaniac.  </P>
<P>   "The Out-of-Towners" is the second script adapted by the
pen of Marc Lawrence, whose "Forces of Nature" was
released just weeks ago.  While Steve Martin and Goldie
Hawn are immeasurably more charming than Ben Affleck and
Sandra Bullock, "The Out-of-Towners" gives them little more
than recycled pap for their considerable talents.</P>
<PRE>Rated PG-13.  Running Time: 85 minutes.  (C) 1999
