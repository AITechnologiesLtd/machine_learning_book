<PRE>Rating: * (out of five)  </PRE>
<P>Written by David Diamond and Richard Shepard.  
Directed by Kurt Voss.  
Starring Alyssa Milano and Ice-T.  
Rated R (contains violence, profanity, and sexuality)  88 mins.  </P>
<P>Synopsis:  Nice girl Susanne has sex with her boyfriend Daniel in his car,
visits Daniel's rich family during Thanksgiving at their mansion in the
middle of nowhere, and has sex with Daniel again in the basement.  Susanne
and Daniel must then decide where to hide from evil art thieves who shoot
everyone else in the mansion to steal paintings.  Brace yourself for one of
those painfully obvious "surprise endings."  </P>
<P>Comments:  Thanksgiving.  For most, it's a time to be with your loved ones
and enjoy a good, home-cooked meal.  For the makers of BODY COUNT, however,
Thanksgiving is a time for multiple murders, violence, profanity, family
dysfunction, and sex.  Boy, do I feel all the more better having sat through
this crap.  </P>
<P>Alyssa Milano, the former child star of WHO'S THE BOSS?, matures to
made-for-video sludge like this movie.  Someone somewhere thought it'd be a
great idea to pair her with rapper Ice-T, who has since guest-starred in the
made-for-the-Sci-Fi-Channel series WELCOME TO PARADOX.  This isn't exactly a
winning combination.  </P>
<P>Outside of permanently ruining a holiday for me, what else may be said for
this turkey?  Well, it teaches us that beautiful, attractive women who look
strikingly like Alyssa Milano fall in love with nerds who drive down long
winding roads with their eyes closed and complain about being English
teachers.  It presents us with a heartwarming Thanksgiving dinner attended
by alcoholic, stuck-up rich white people waited on by black servants.  It
shows us that old guys, try not to laugh, sit around and talk about "the
appeal of postmodernism" during their free time.  And, it proves that you
can have sex in your parents' basement when they have a dozen or so guests
over, and no one will notice.  </P>
<P>Before I go any further, if any young male reading this has hopes of seeing
Alyssa naked, forget it.  The filmmakers cleverly shoot the simulated sex
scenes in a manner that makes sure you don't see any of Milano's attributes.
They do, however, inexplicably throw in a scene where Ice-T whistles "Jingle
Bells" after killing people, for whatever that's worth.  </P>
<P>This film was originally titled BELOW UTOPIA.  Perhaps they should have
renamed it HELL.  Avoid this clunker.  </P>
