<P>     "People ask if this film is autobiographical, and many of the 
circumstances in it are but I've pushed them farther than they really 
went.  It's personal, but not completely autobiographical.  It was common 
in my home and my friends' homes to see no fathers around--and even when 
they were around they weren't really around.  It wasn't just that they 
were so busy working hard for the family to afford living there, but they 
became estranged from the family and it was too hard for them to come 
back into the fold, I think.  There were lots of lonely mothers who got 
over-invested in their sons' lives .... The weird thing about this very 
common situation is that nobody much talks about it." 
     - David O. Russell, writer/director of SPANKING THE MONKEY </P>
<P>     My college days aren't so far behind me that I can't recognize a
nightmare summer vacation when I see one.  And that, amongst weightier
issues, is exactly what SPANKING THE MONKEY is about.  If poor Ray
(Jeremy Davies) ever had any illusions about life being fair, they
don't last beyond the first five minutes of David O. Russell's debut
feature.</P>
<P>     Ray's freshman year at MIT has gone very well.  So well, in fact,
that he has been awarded a rare summer internship working at the
Surgeon General's office in Washington D.C.  It's the opportunity of a
lifetime--but not Ray's, apparently.  His father Tom (Benjamin
Hendrickson) has other plans for him:  stay home, mow the lawn, take
the dog on long walks, and--while he's there--play nurse to his
mother Susan (Alberta Watson).  She's suffering from a low self-image,
acute depression, and a badly fractured left leg.  So much for Ray's
perfect summer.</P>
<P>     SPANKING THE MONKEY is a diabolically dark comedy complete with an
insight or two into human nature keen enough to cause a little
discomfort.  Director David O. Russell has set up his world as a
"normal" suburban community, then caused all sorts of bizarre things to
happen.  While circumstances aren't taken to David Lynch extremes, one
has a sense that the director of BLUE VELVET would appreciate what
Russell has done with his canvas here.</P>
<P>     Much of the conflict in SPANKING THE MONKEY centers around Ray's
resentment at being forced to sacrifice his life to care for his
mother.  He tries all sorts of alternatives, but is unable to come up
with a way to escape the trap.  Susan, feeling neglected by her
philandering husband (who cares more about his dog and car than her),
is only too happy to have Ray around.</P>
<P>     The relationships are fascinating to observe and dissect.  This is
true even considering that all of the characters are too self-absorbed
to be especially likeable.  The most obvious interaction to watch is
that between Ray and Susan, two people whose feelings for one another
have become warped and twisted by their individual imprisonments.  On
the other hand, the emotional interchange between Ray and his father
rarely reaches beyond the most superficial level--but Tom never wanted
any children in the first place.  Then there's Toni (Carla Galio),
Ray's girlfriend for the summer, whose views on sex leave our
protagonist confused and frustrated.</P>
<P>     SPANKING THE MONKEY is often funny--and sometimes
hilarious--because of its acute perceptiveness.  This is not a
     "nice" movie--it deals with some pretty intense issues (like
incest and suicide)--but it is both bold and inventive, and works
because of an unforced approach.  Daring us to laugh at some of the
blackest foibles of mankind, SPANKING THE MONKEY ventures into realms
that more conservative viewers might label as "taboo", and emerges
triumphant.  Add Russell's name to the growing list of young directors
who know what they're doing and how to get it done.</P>
