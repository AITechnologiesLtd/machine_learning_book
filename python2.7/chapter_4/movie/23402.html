<P>In `The Whole Nine Yards', everyone is eager to whack someone else,
whether the incentive is marital difficulties or business. For Jimmy
`The Tulip' Tudeski (Bruce Willis), a hitman formerly associated with
the notorious Gogalack crime family in Chicago, it's strictly business.
After supplying the FBI with evidence against the Gogalack family and
serving his 5-year prison term, The Tulip has relocated to Montreal,
Quebec to hide out. His new neighbor, the `poor dentist' Nick Oseransky
(Matthew Perry), recognizes his mug immediately because he once
maintained a dental practice in the Windy City. And so begins `The Whole
Nine Yards', a surprisingly enjoyable farce that jettisons some of its
comedic appeal in favor of crafting a rather convoluted storyline.</P>
<P>For Matthew Perry, the transition from `Friends' to the big screen has
been occupied with unpleasant turbulence. Contrary to most, I somewhat
enjoyed his two critically battered romantic vehicles `Fools Rush In'
and `Three to Tango'.... but despite his perceptible charm and gifted
comic timing, the actor has carried with him a wretched box office curse
in whatever film he inhabits. Hopefully, `The Whole Nine Yards' will put
an end to that mean streak. After all, the movie stars Mr. Box Office
himself, Bruce Willis - whose career seems to have been jump-started
once again by the little supernatural thriller that could (`The Sixth
Sense'). Tack on a talented supporting cast willing to experiment with
an accent or two, and the result is a fairly perky and energetic comic
stew containing just enough clever zeal and enthusiasm to fill a 2-hour
gap quite entertainingly.</P>
<P>The plot will sound complicated to most, but once you get a taste of
`The Whole Nine Yards' first-hand, everything will level out in a
straightforward fashion. Once Tudeski moves in, Oseransky (or `Oz') gets
overwrought with panic. His miserly Canadian wife Sophie (Rosanna
Arquette), who has made the union of marriage hell for Oz, persuades him
to travel to Chicago and inform the Gogalack family of Tudeski's
whereabouts (the method of persuasion being that she will grant him a
divorce). But this is only the start of the intricate shenanigans, as
Jimmy's lovely wife Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge), Nick's bubbly
receptionist Jill (Amanda Peet) and behemoth underling Frankie Figs
(Michael Clarke Duncan) all get involved in the fiasco. The plot is so
convoluted that it causes you to speculate about what director Jonathan
Lynn's primary concerns were. If the layout of `The Whole Nine Yards'
was a race track, the shady mobster/hitman portion of the plot would
have lapped the humor five times over.</P>
<P>Fortunately, the film still has its laughs. Lynn, who has done good (`My
Cousin Vinny') and not-so-good (`Sgt. Bilko'), keeps the pace churning
at a consistent momentum, and his slick approach leaves little margin
for error. Although `The Whole Nine Yards' deals with somber dealings
like murder and double-crosses, most of the film has a light, puckery
taste to it. This agreeable flavor is largely due to the beaming
supporting cast - particularly Amanda Peet, whose terrific comic
performance lends a sense of illumination to every scene she's in.
Meanwhile, Henstridge (the babalicious alien from `Species') shows us
her surprising competence with giving a strong serious performance, and
Duncan (the Oscar-nominated actor from `The Green Mile') occupies the
character of Frankie Figs like few others could. The only general
exception is Rosanna Arquette, who is mainly just shill and grating with
the character of Sophie, and her highly inconsistent `Canadian' accent
reveals that she maybe forgot to do any research whatsoever.</P>
<P>The most interesting accent of the show belongs to the funny Kevin
Pollak, playing imposing (and rather unintelligent) mob boss Yanni
Gogalack, who introduces Cynthia as `Yimmy's vife'. In a way similar to
Yanni's verbal clumsiness, `The Whole Nine Yards' has its priorities in
a tangle. The script straddles two separate genres and sometimes reveals
a gaping hole of incompetence. The film itself is a bit off-centered,
but Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis know every nook and cranny of their
characters, and their one-two punch of forceful tough guy and suburban
doofus helps add to the entertainment value of the film. `The Whole Nine
Yards' is not as fulfilling as the title may suggest, but as a comedy,
it is still more leisurely than most.</P>
