<PRE>                                THE EDGE 1997
                        A film review by Timothy Voon
                         Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                        1 :-)  for the big, bad bear</PRE>
<P>Cast:  Anthony Hopkins, Alec Baldwin, Harold Perrineau, Elle Macpherson.
Screenplay:  David Mamet. Director:  Lee Tamahori.</P>
<P>How many billionaires (Anthony Hopkins) in their late fifties are well read
and able to survive the winter wild and man-eating bears? Not many, but
let's put aside unlikelihoods to focus on what this movie has to offer. It
teaches us not to put our trust in young, pretty wives who are super models
(Elle Mcpherson) or to rely too heavily on their photographers (Alec
Baldwin). When your death is everybody else's gain, nobody can be trusted
and the cliché term poor little rich billionaire comes to mind.</P>
<P>This movie should just focus on men pooling their resources together to
survive the wilderness, leaving out the melodramatics of attempted murder
and betrayal. The plot is initially engrossing, but becomes hard to swallow
when one man becomes an excessively, forgiving hero and the other a literal
dying swan. Find me a humane billionaire and I'll gladly donate five dollars
to the Mother Theresa Foundation, find me one who doesn't have a lawyer as a
‘best friend' and I'll donate ten. One would have thought that life
threatening experiences such as a bear hunt would create sufficient male
bonding to resolve most differences, but apparently not so. If Helen was
enough to cause the fall of Troy and Eve the fall of man, then perhaps Elle
is sufficient to make a man think with his dick instead of his head.</P>
<P>By far the best actor is the bear. These big, mangy beasts are too often
disguised as soft cuddly toys which children take to sleep. This is most
uncharacteristic of them (soft, cuddly) and the question of beds should
never have arisen with Goldilocks in their jaws. Anyone who tells their
child otherwise is being dishonest. It is this fascinating creature that
makes this story exciting. The rest of the cast is merely supportive.
Anthony Hopkins skilfully portrays an intellectual, resourceful billionaire
who is unusually compassionate, and Alec Baldwin injects hilarity into the
situation when he starts crying; but this is truly the tale of the big, bad
bear.</P>
