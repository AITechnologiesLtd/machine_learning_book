 15 Minutes (2001). Starring Robert De Niro, Edward Burns, Kelsey
Grammer, Avery Brooks, Melina Kanakaredes, Karel Roden and Oleg
Taktarov. Written and directed by John Herzfeld. Rated R.</P>
<P> Supposedly buried deep within 15 Minutes is some profound statement
about our society, its relationship with the media and how said media
allows us to abrogate our responsibilities for our actions.</P>
<P> Or 15 Minutes could just be another cynical, exploitive melodrama out
to score a quick buck by offering audiences what they crave ó violence
and sex ó or at least female nudity.</P>
<P> Actually 15 Minutes is an amalgamation of both. It damns tabloid
journalism ó especially those reality-based news shows such as Hard Copy
and Inside Edition ó while simultaneously allowing the audience to be
voyeurs to some rather gruesome proceedings.</P>
<P> 15 Minutes is fascinating in a cheesy and sleazy way. This loud, crass
thriller sucks you into the action, and you discover a kernel of
enjoyment in this overblown drama. Afterward, though, your conscience
berates you indulging yourself in such low-fare, obvious melodramatics.</P>
<P> 15 Minutes tries to take the high-road approach of foisting itself off
as an examination of our culture's cravings for celebrities ó to the
point that we don't care if the people shown on camera are cops or
killers. If they're on TV, they're famous, which gives them to impetus
to try to get away with murder.</P>
<P> But this is only window dressing, because ó at its core ó 15 Minutes is
nothing more than your standard-fare cops hunting down killers B-movie
plot.</P>
<P> Some of the plot points are so dumb that you wonder how
screenwriter-director John Herzfeld was allowed to keep them in his
script.</P>
<P> For example, the two lowlife criminals are Eastern European refugees.
One is a movie-crazy Czech, the other an ex-con from Russia, newly
released from prison.</P>
<P> They come to the United States to collect money from an old pal with
whom they pulled a job in the old country. Which old country, we are
never told, but it makes no difference.</P>
<P> From the outset these two goons, Emil Slovak (Karel Roden) and Oleg
Razgul (Oleg Taktarov), should be setting off alarms. They do nothing
but sweat. It pours off them like a sumo wrestler in a Turkish bath.</P>
<P> Plus, they look so shifty at customs, that the dimwit who allows them
into the country, should be fired.</P>
<P> But, of course, they are passed through, so they can begin their
murderous spree.</P>
<P> Representing the side of law and order is Detective Eddie Flemming
(Robert De Niro), a media darling who breaks the big cases and who
manages to always get his mug ó and his collars ó on a fast-paced
tabloid TV show hosted by the smarmy Robert Hawkins (Kelsey Grammer).</P>
<P> Flemming is aided by fire marshal Jody Warsaw (Edward Burns), who gets
involved in the case after our two slimebags torch a building to cover a
crime.</P>
<P> All of this leads to a lot of spilled blood, gunfire, cursing and legal
wranglings.</P>
<P> Of course, virtue triumphs in the end and the American way of life is
preserved.</P>
<P> 15 Minutes does offer one big shocker, but even that is not enough to
elevate it from programmer status.
The media, of course, is the scapegoat as well as the punching bag ó
literally ó for the ills of society.</P>
<P> The performances are mixed. De Niro, who seems to be taking any kind of
role and whatever he is offered, adds nothing to his canon. Here he
relies on props ó a cigar, a two-headed quarter ó to create his
character.</P>
<P> Burns seems to whine his every line. At times, he sounds like that Will
Ferrell character on Saturday Night Live who cannot modulate his voice.</P>
<P> The acting honors here go to Roden and Taktarov as the two émigrés who
try to live the American dream on their own terms. Taktarov, especially,
is memorable as he carries around his little video camera filming
everyone and everything he sees. Life ó and death ó to him are merely
extensions of some cosmic movie in which he is vying for the final cut.</P>
<P> 15 Minutes is a brutal excursion that may make you uncomfortable. But
as a serious examination of the ills of the media and the cult of
celebrity, it is laughable. So take it for what it is, a two-hour-plus
game of cops and robbers played by some well-paid actors.</P>
