<PRE>Coincidence is a funny thing.</PRE>
<P>This is explained in the opening prologue of Paul Thomas Anderson's
`Magnolia'. Our narrator (Ricky Jay) guides us through several unlikely
scenarios of chance and coincidence that display, with great humor, how
past relevance can intrude on the present. For instance: a man plummets
off the side of a building in a suicide attempt, but is inflicted with a
shotgun blast on his way to landing in netting that would have surely
saved his life. The shotgun was fired by his mother from their apartment
several floors below. With shotgun cocked, she was violently threatening
her husband when the weapon accidentally fired and struck their son on
his descent to the netting. But she insists that, to her knowledge, the
gun was never loaded. Coincidentally, it was he - the suicide `victim' -
had loaded the weapon a few weeks prior, hoping that it would end the
feuding his parents had continued for years. `These strange things
happen all the time,' the narrator concludes. P.T. Anderson has
collected a photo album of lonely, troubled characters in an
intersecting plot line that he uses to prove this thesis.</P>
<P>`Magnolia', a sprawling masterpiece of operatic grandeur, is an
ambitious film in which the director's inventive jest never seems to
stop flowing. Anderson leads us through several intertwining stories in
Los Angeles, and each is fascinating for separate reasons. There is the
story of cancer-stricken television producer Earl Partridge (Jason
Robards), who lies on his deathbed, attended to by his unstable young
wife (Julianne Moore) and a caring nurse (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Earl
desperately wants to get in touch with his distant son, who, we soon
realize, is self-help sex guru Frank TJ Mackey (Tom Cruise). Frank has
made himself an icon among males everywhere with his `Search and
Destroy' program and his energized public seminars, in which he
raucously lectures the audience on how to best invade female territory.
There's the story of game show legend Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall),
who has hosted the beloved quiz show `What Do Kids Know?' for 30-odd
years. Jimmy has also received the news that he is dying from cancer,
and, in light of the fact his strength is deteriorating faster than
anticipated, he tries to reunite with his daughter Claudia (Melora
Walters). Meanwhile, current `What Do Kids Know?' contestant Stanley
Spector (Jeremy Blackman) begins to notice his rigid father (Michael
Bowen) sees him as merely a walking encyclopedia for cash income. And
former child genius Donnie Smith (William H. Macy) ponders the
misfortune of his job at an electronics store, and looks back at his
brief and turbulent 15-minutes of fame.</P>
<P>Finally, there is the story of Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly), a
mild-mannered police officer looking for love at age 32. In more ways
than one, Anderson uses the Kurring character as the backbone of the
story. He is kind and thoughtful where other characters are rough and
violent, adding some emotional stability to the mix. As an ensemble
piece, `Magnolia' is superbly crafted. The dignified and accomplished
cast of actors balance their screen time miraculously, and each is given
the spotlight at some pivotal time to properly voice their character's
emotional dilemma. Everyone (or almost everyone) is successful in
identifying with their character during these critical moments. Hall has
a positively stunning, heart-wrenching breakdown on the game show,
Robards is chillingly effective as he croaks out his untold confessions,
and Walters is phenomenal throughout. However, the brunt of the
recognition deserves to be bestowed upon Mr. Tom Cruise, who delivers a
dazzling, high-voltage performance as Frank Mackey - the kinetic ball of
vivacious energy at the center of Anderson's amazing concoction.</P>
<P>The cast is astonishing - but you knew that already. The outrageous kick
behind `Magnolia' is writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson, a brilliant
filmmaker who shows infinite ambition to plumb the emotional depths of
this work in methods both extravagant and unique. Anderson received
endless praise for `Boogie Nights', his detailed account of pornographic
filmmaking in the 1970's. In `Magnolia', the director shows a keen and
thoughtful eye for pacing. At just over 3-hours in length, the film
could have been a tedious and pretentious experience, but it transforms
into a moving, thrilling and audaciously funny spectacle under
Anderson's wing. What David O. Russell did earlier this year with `Three
Kings', P.T. Anderson achieves again here. By the time a totally
outrageous, completely unexpected finale rolls around, you must
acknowledge the fact that Paul Thomas Anderson is a bold and ambitious
filmmaker, and `Magnolia' is a one-of-a-kind experience.</P>
<P>Another highlight is the soundtrack. Many scenes are accompanied by the
music of Aimee Mann, including one expertly integrated segment in which
the characters sing the lyrics of `Wise Up' in episodic fashion. The
musical score, by Jon Brion, blends seamlessly into the fast-moving
action in the 2nd act. But this is not necessarily a `viewer-friendly'
movie. I can tell you right now, many audience members will be utterly
confounded by the director's style - particularly the Biblical climax.
Those who get involved in the film, though, will realize the treasure
P.T. Anderson has delivered. `Magnolia' is a profound and effective
motion picture, and a monumental achievement in film.</P>
