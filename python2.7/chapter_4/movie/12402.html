Written and Directed by David Lynch, 1976
By Zach Douglas (<A HREF="mailto:Zachd@fc.net">Zachd@fc.net</A> / <A HREF="http://www.fc.net/~zachd">http://www.fc.net/~zachd</A> ) 1998</PRE>
<P>(Note: I highly recommend reading Ray Wolf's excellent web guide for his 
insights on Eraserhead. I left out a lot of information because I couldn't 
bring myself to regurgitate all the things I read on Ray's page and instead 
tried to bring forth a few new elements that I didn't find there or 
elsewhere. Other recommended readings on the subject is Danny's Pearry's 
review in his book Cult Movies. Here is Ray's web page:</P>

<P>It's been a long time since I have watched a film as intricately detailed, 
thought provoking,  and scary as Eraserhead. While my opinion of David Lynch 
was was somewhat mixed after having seen all of his films except for The Lost 
Highway, it has become apparent to me that having some understanding of the 
meanings of his films is of up most importance to the enjoyment of them. Many 
will say Lynches films are "visually entertaining" or "bizarre" enough to be 
entertaining but don't fully endorse the films because they can't fully 
embrace just what the hell the film meant. That is understandable. Lynch 
himself says that people should not try so hard to understand his films in 
absolute terms. I will agree with him so far as saying that precise 
interpretations of films such as Eraserhead are impossible.  However, I 
refuse not to give up that easily and not attempt to grasp at an 
interpretation and contribute my thoughts, regardless where it leads, how 
misguided it might be, or how much time on a nice Saturday afternoon it might 
take me to do so. </P>
<P>I've read a few different ideas on the meaning of Eraserhead. I can for the 
most part agree with them, but I must seek to fill in some crucial and what 
seems to me - obvious elements that seem to me missing from many 
interpretations. To add to the popular theories concerning Eraserhead I (like 
others) have turned to the Auteur theory (1.) for insight. With what 
understanding I do have of Lynch's other films and also with a general 
knowledge that many of our greatest film makers continually made
autobiographical works wherein they cast leading men who resembled 
themselves. Another aspect in Eraserhead of which I am not sure exists in his 
other films are visual puns to be explained later. Going back to leading men; 
Lynch would later utilize Kyle McGlaughlin as his alter ego, it is Jack Nance 
in Eraserhead who is Lynch. If we imagine Lynch telling his own story of 
troubled days in a hellish area of Philadelphia when he was 21, then this is 
what I believe Eraserhead is saying: </P>
<P>As Henry lies prone at the first of the movie, we see him yawn and from his 
mouth he emits a sperm-like worm. The yawn is the first pun - Henry has had 
intercourse or "slept" with a woman who turns out to be Mary. We see the man 
at the window looking down. The man pulls the levers of the great machine and 
we see the sperm head toward a swirling black pool and enters. Yes, it's God. 
>From here see Henry's life. We don't know much about it but know he is a 
depressed, sad man. Henry then meets his girlfriend Mary's parents and they 
declare he is to be married because he and Mary had
intercourse. It's notable that Henry doesn't have any say in the matter and 
just accepts his fate as if he has no control over it. Henry's premature 
mutant baby comes. Henry looks at the radiator and sees a funny puffy cheeked 
woman. This woman is death, and Henry is contemplating suicide when he thinks 
of her and sees her singing her happy tune, "In heaven, everything is fine". 
Mary leaves Henry. Henry takes care of the baby when it gets sick. But Henry 
soon wants to leave but baby won't let Henry leave. Henry has sex with the 
bad lady across the hall. Things then get really bad for Henry as his head 
falls off. From Henry's neck comes the head of the child. Henry later kills 
the baby and goes on to be with the puffy cheeked lady (and embraces death). </P>
<P>Now, a smaller point of interest before getting to what my main point is what 
Lynch is saying about old people. From Blue Velvet we can see that Lynch 
likes to poke fun at American traditions such as family, religion, teen 
romance, and the like. In Eraserhead we see a strong contempt for the family 
of Mary X and perhaps for the elderly in general. Lynch says they are are 
stupid, frightening, and useless. "Grandma" sits motionless, posed as 
Whistler's Mother, except with a cigarette dangling from her mouth
reinforces her pathetic pose. Her uselessness is shown by her "helping" 
mother X make salad as Mother X puts the bowl in her lap and then tosses the 
salad herself, reaching her arms under Grandmother's to toss the salad. 
Father X is near senile and beats his arm which he tells Henry he has lost 
use of and lost feeling in. Lynch obviously finds it disgusting, yet somewhat 
comical that old men often are overly eager to relate their physical 
infirmities to others. Once Henry and Mary are "married" the in-laws are 
removed from the picture. </P>
<P>The new focus is on the "Baby" that enters their lives. Another key is the 
statement that the baby is premature which is important later. Mary can't 
stand the baby and leaves. Henry begins to look toward the radiator (suicide) 
as an option. He tries to take care of the baby. Finally, he steps on the 
stage with the woman from the radiator and it's at about this time that Henry 
loses his head. I find it easiest to apply the most basic of visual metaphors 
(the puns) to the following key sequences after Henry's head falls off. 
First, Henry has "Lost his head". Equivalent to Lynch thinking that he is 
crazy to have been married (or living with someone) and having a child in the 
prime of his life. When his head is found by the boy, he takes it in to the 
shop. Before they use the material in Henry's head the proprietor of the shop 
first drills in to the head to get a core sample of the material inside. He 
says that it is "OK". Lynch is saying that someone in their prime should 
"have their head checked" if they become shackled by wife and child. This is 
backed by the proprietor's findings: That the material in Henry's head is 
grade A
material for making pencil erasers. It is now confirmed that Henry (Lynch) 
must have been very stupid to make the decisions he made. It is this point 
that seems to have gone unspoken in deciphering Eraserhead's meaning. Perhaps 
we are too sympathetic toward Henry (because he must endure such a hellish 
life and appears like a scared boy) or toward Lynch (because he is an artist 
we respect) to make that statement to say that being an Eraserhead means 
being an idiot. That's my main point. </P>
<P>To further iterate, we see that from Henry's body has sprung the tiny head of 
the baby. Remembering now that the baby was premature, we again see now that 
it is also Henry/Lynch himself who was premature in their decision (or lack 
of a decision) to take on a wife and child. </P>
<P>Now, of course there is a lot left unexplained that I won't go in to, or 
perhaps can't go in to. Does Henry die? Why is the lady behind the radiator 
so grotesque if she represents a beautiful way out of the hellish life? Why 
does she kill the worms? Is she like an angel? Does that make the lady across 
the hall a demon? There are many other questions, but once you have a tiny 
grasp of what might be happening in this film, it becomes really fascinating 
to dig deeper and deeper as Eraserhead is so intricate that new aspects will 
surface with each viewing. I think I have done about all the digging in to 
the film and my mind that I can do on this viewing, so perhaps when I watch 
the film again someday I will return with some more thoughts on Eraserhead. </P>
<P>Postscript: Do I like Eraserhead? Yes. I think it is one of the most 
monumental achievements in modern film history. I really don't know of any 
other full length, live action film that so fully creates such a singular, 
visceral, and personal world as Eraserhead. The closest works I can think of 
might be films such as Fellini's 8 1/2 or La Dulce Vita and the works of 
Louis Bunuel who's nightmarish surrealist films might be Eraserhead's only 
equals.  I take that back, one other film that I can think of is Tetsuo: The 
Iron Man.  Check that out some time if you dare.   Also, I don't know of many 
other films who's soundtrack (consisting of what Sounds like saws, grinding 
metal, and other various industrial noises) has been so carefully 
constructed. Only the Kubrick films such as 2001 and The Shining come to 
mind. The only thing more disturbing than watching Eraserhead might be to 
listen to it. </P>
<P>1. - Auteur Theory. Critical theory on films originated by Francois Truffaut. 
The theory focused on the director's of the films rather than stars, plot, or 
production company. The theory states that by becoming more familiar with all 
the works of a director, that familiar themes would arise from the 
filmmaker's personal visions, desires, and sensibilities. These themes can 
then be used to explain individual films which might, when viewed as singular 
works, be hard to explain otherwise.  </P>
