<P>HILARY AND JACKIE *** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers ( <A HREF="mailto:wchamber@netcom.ca">wchamber@netcom.ca</A> )</P>
<P>(Happy New Year! from Film Freak Central -
<A HREF="http://filmfreakcentral.net">http://filmfreakcentral.net</A> )</P>
<P>starring Emily Watson, Rachel Griffiths, David Morrissey, Jim Frain
screenplay by Frank Cottrell Boyce
directed by Anand Tucker</P>
<P>1998 may go down as the year of the Disease Movie. This month alone,
Susan Sarandon gets cancer in Stepmom,  and half the cast of Patch
Adams has leukemia by the time the closing credits roll. Last fall,
Meryl Streep contracted cancer in One True Thing. Hilary and Jackie
also co-stars a disease: multiple sclerosis, which attacks cellist
Jacqueline Du Pré in her prime. But the film is very much unlike the
sanctimonious, movie-of-the-week affliction melodramas currently
scoring at the box office. Death, you see, is anything but romantic;
it doesn't happen on cue; and it does not transform a person into a
saint. Hilary and Jackie acknowledges these cold, hard facts.</P>
<P>Hilary and Jackie Du Pré are sisters growing up in 1950s Sussex
County, England. Both are encouraged by their  overbearing mother to
practice music, but Hilary is the favoured daughter, having appeared
on local television with her flute. Jackie becomes obsessed with
achieving her sister's level of achievement, and practices her cello
night and day. Eventually, she actually ties with Hilary at a local
talent competition. Fame and fortune seek Jackie out; while Jackie
tours Europe, Hilary finds a mate in an amateur conducter named Kiffer
Finzi (Morrissey), much to Jackie's chagrin.</P>
<P>Hilary, as the filmmakers would have it, is entirely selfless,
abandoning her instrument at a young age so as not to interfere with
Jackie's desire for success. Jackie, on the other hand, is a
monster-despite the fact that she has a mate of her own (Frain, as
famed pianist Daniel Barenboim), she demands sexual favours from
Hilary's husband; Hilary allows Jackie to take advantage of her
generosity.</P>
<P>The story is divided into two halves: "Hilary" follows Hilary from
childhood to domesticity. In scene after scene, she lets Jackie walk
all over her out of an inherent sisterly devotion, then cowers away to
a corner to cry silently about it. Griffiths, who played Jude's
conniving first wife in Jude, demonstrates great range as the ‘nice'
sister, a woman who essentially gives up whatever makes her feel
special out of guilt. The movie wisely avoids pitting her against
Jackie in a big shouting match-much of her pain remains unresolved at
the finish. The "Jackie" half essentially tells the "Hilary" story
from the opposite viewpoint; some, but not all, of Jackie's callous
actions are justified in this section. (For example: In "Hilary," the
Du Pré family are disappointed to open a package from travelling
Jackie that contains only her laundry, while in "Jackie," it is
explained that Jackie has no access to a washing facility, and sends
her clothes home in desperation.) Jackie resents Hilary for her
decidedly unhectic lifestyle; her cello is a crutch, something she
can't abandon. (Indeed, she tries to, but neither a night of harsh
weather nor an attempt to leave it behind in a cab end the
relationship Jackie has with her instrument. It is as resilient as
Hilary.) That resentment does not pass as the disease begins to ravage
her body, and this is the movie's strong point. When Jackie makes a
cruel joke regarding Kiffer's infidelity-while lying in a hospital
bed-we can see the heartbreak in Hilary's eyes.</P>
<P>Watson's performance is certainly impressive (though her
unidentifiable accent sometimes distracts), but we should not overlook
Boyce's relentless screenplay, which allows Jackie to remain immature
and rapacious. (That Jacqueline Du Pré is a bona fide historical
figure sort of makes daring Hilary and Jackie this year's Raging Bull:</P>
<P>at the heart of the film is a fascinating jerk.) Boyce's script is not
impeccable. Though more unified than his last produced work, Welcome
To Sarajevo, his beach-set bookends don't pay off, and the male
characters-particularly the third Du Pré sibling, their brother-are
vaguely drawn.</P>
<P>Tucker's fluid camera and candy-coloured interiors tend to gloss over
the story's flaws. (Tucker has little flair for subtlety-the film has
been assembled in such a way that you're always aware of what will
become a motif the first time it appears on screen, such as Jackie's
tendency to "raspberry.") Understand that I'm strongly recommending 
Hilary and Jackie on the basis of its central performances and its
frequently courageous writing. The real disease that Jackie suffers
from, the movie posits, is envy. The competitive spirit attacks Du Pré
like a cancer at a young age, and a terminal illness simultaneously
punishes her for it (her battle with MS lasted sixteen years) and
liberates her from its grip.</P>
