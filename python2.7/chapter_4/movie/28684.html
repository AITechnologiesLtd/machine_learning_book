<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A solid psychological suspense yarn that plays like a modern noir, but one that
comes to a screeching dead-end after its subject matter becomes exhausted and it
decides to solve its moral dilemma with bullets instead of with the mind. Alex
(Macy) is an emotionless, mild-mannered man of middle-age, who has a nagging
psychological problem that is making him feel weird. His family doctor suggests
he see a therapist about his midlife crisis. While in the therapist's waiting
room, he strikes up a conversation with an outspoken 23-year-old beautician
named Sarah (Neve), who is waiting to see another therapist. He becomes
strangely attracted to her and feels compelled to see her again. Sarah's private
life is chaotic and much looser than his, as she's attracted to both men and
women. She feels that this married man who has a 6-year-old son, will only use
her for sex and dump her when he has no more need for her body. </P>
<P>Alex tells the therapist, Dr. Parks (Ritter), that he has two jobs -- a
mail-order business run out of his home and he works for his father (Sutherland)
as a professional hit man: he kills people. He wants to leave the family
business but doesn't know how to. His father trained him at an early age to be
in the murder for hire business by killing squirrels as a child. His
occupational secret is something that only his creepy mother Deidre (Bain) knows
about outside of him and his father. His wife Martha (Ullman) has no clue, while
his precocious son Sammy (Dorfman) is gently handled by him; father and son
spend quality time together talking about such things as infinity. </P>
<P>The main plot development occurs when his mother gets it out of him that he's
seeing a shrink, and she tells hubby. Since one of the rules of the family
business is to tell no one else what their business is, the father orders his
son's next contract to be Dr. Parks. </P>
<P>The tension builds for Alex as he wrestles with how to handle dad, how to raise
his son, how to reconcile his already weakened sanity if he kills his shrink,
and how to handle his feelings for Sarah and his wife. </P>
<P>It's a smart film with weighty dialogue to bring the story to the height of its
dilemma in such a crisp way. It builds in tension to show how unhappy Alex is
with his bourgeois life and how unhappy Sarah is with her bohemian party
lifestyle. But his dilemma is the greater, as he is drawn out by his therapist
to ask himself questions that he doesn't want to answer but is now forced to. </P>
<P>What keeps the film compelling is the shaded introspective performance by Macy
who ably anchors the film, as he allows us to see who and what he is; and, more
importantly what suffering he is now going through. Sutherland's performance is
devilishly demonic, and in his understated call for violence gives voice to a
very scary character who gets under our skin. Bain's complicity with Sutherland
adds to the psychological trauma of the Macy character. In contrast to the men,
Neve Campbell's performance is loud and reaching. As a character-driven film, it
is handled with a quiet reassurance by first-time director but experienced
screenwriter Henry Bromell. Panic plays like an episode for Homicide does that
has become more invigorated with psychological possibilities. Bromell, the
Homicide cop-show writer, has made a TV cop drama come to life as a B movie that
can't get away from TV's weakness of hanging a moral ending onto its dramatics.
But, nevertheles, I still found it to be a hit man movie with a heart and a
brain, a film that keeps a low profile while taking you on a mind trip laced
with bitter irony. </P>
