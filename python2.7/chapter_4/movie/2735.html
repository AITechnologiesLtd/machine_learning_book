<PRE>                                    NORTH
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     This could have been an enjoyable movie.  Rob Reiner, who has
given us one excellent film after another, really blew it on this one.
Even the great cast were not utilized to their fullest, most being on
the screen for a few minutes at a time.  Was he just snowing us with
big names?</P>
<P>     North (Elijah Wood) is eleven years old.  His dad and mom
(Seinfeld's Jason Alexander and Julia Louis-Dreyfus) are totally
oblivious to him; at the dinner table he can't get a word in.  And that
is sad because everyone else loves the kid.  He is tops in school
grades, best hitter and pitcher on his baseball team and even does a
great Tevye in his school's "Fiddler On The Roof" play.  Every parent
holds him up as an example to their kids: "Would North do that?"</P>
<P>     Every kid has a place where he likes to be by himself and think
about his life.  North's is a chair in a department store in a mall.
Passersby would think he was just a young boy waiting while his parents
are shopping.  But along comes someone dressed as a bunny.  (Bruce
Willis ... who also does the narrating).  The bunny works at the
store and is on a break.</P>
<P>     The bunny hears out North's sad story and gives him some options.
North brings his parents to court where a judge (Alan Arkin) rules in
his favor, allowing him to seek out some parents he would prefer to his
own.  The courtroom scene with the crazy judge is funny.</P>
<P>     The stipulation is: find parents you want by Labor Day or you will
be sent to an orphanage.  North sets out to various places around the
world looking for parents with whom he would be happy.</P>
<P>     Where did the movie go wrong?  In a couple of places.  The
"adventures" become repetitious and the 88-minute film drags.  But the
worst and most incredible part, given Reiner's history, the sub-plot
involves someone trying to murder North, actually firing at him.  What
a poor plot for a movie for children!</P>
