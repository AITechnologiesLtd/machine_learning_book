<P>     AMNESIA tries to be a provocative condemnation of war and violence.  
Instead, it ends up as an awkward, unevenly-scripted morality play.  
Very little of this film is new or original (in fact, a similar story 
was tackled with considerably greater power and finesse in a small 
Romanian film called AN UNFORGETTABLE SUMMER), and its presentation, 
which includes offbeat acting styles and choppy pacing, is distracting. </P>
<P>     The story centers on Private Ramirez, an ineffectual soldier 
serving in the Chilean army during the 1960s, following the ouster of 
Salvador Allende by the military (with help from the CIA).  When Zuniga, 
Ramirez's brutal commanding officer, orders the execution of several 
prisoners of war, the private balks.  From that point on, Zuniga treats 
Ramirez with ill-concealed contempt and eventually compels him to 
participate in a double murder by placing a gun to his head.  During his 
time fighting under Zuniga, Ramirez manages one small victory by 
allowing a prisoner named Carrasco to escape. </P>
<P>     Twenty years later, on the streets of Valparaiso, Ramirez meets 
Zuniga for the first time since they served together.  While the 
commander is delighted to see a familiar face, Ramirez's first thoughts 
are of vengeance against the man who broke his mind by forcing him to 
engage in atrocities.  He contacts Carrasco, and together the two 
concoct a scheme of revenge. </P>
<P>     Zuniga's excuse for his actions is that he was just following 
orders, that "somebody has to clean up the world!"  It's a defense as 
old as war, and one claimed by almost every Nazi back in the 40s -- the 
loyal soldier cannot question the commands of his leaders.  War makes 
monsters of men, but what happens when peace returns?  Can barbarity be 
ignored if it was committed by the victors in the name of winning?   </P>
<P>     What occasionally undermines AMNESIA is not the message, but the 
manner in which it is delivered.  The core story is interesting enough, 
but there are several lengthy tangents and detours that interrupt the 
main plot flow.  The conclusion, with its all-too-obvious sermonizing, 
lacks punch.  Ultimately, this film's perspective is its strength -- it 
looks at a complex issue from a cultural viewpoint unfamiliar to many 
North Americans.  However, in terms of impact, films like PLATOON, which 
survey similar territory, leave afterimages far more difficult to 
expunge. </P>
