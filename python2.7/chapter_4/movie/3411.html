<PRE>                            LOSING ISAIAH
               A film review by Benjamin Edward Swire
                Copyright 1995 Benjamin Edward Swire</PRE>
<PRE>LOSING ISAIAH'S Poor Oversight</PRE>
<P>     How much cash does it take to be a mother?  Stephen Gyllenhaal's
new film LOSING ISAIAH delves into the issues of motherhood and race
attempting to separate them.  But if one looks at all closely into what
the film has to say, it is apparent that underlying these surface
concerns is a quickly dismissed issue of class.</P>
<P>     While at times a bit heavy handed, occasionally going for the
easy tear-jerking moments, LOSING ISAIAH is a good film--solidedly
acted, well scripted, and skillfully directed.  It is however, exactly
what you'd expect it to be.  That may be good and that may be bad
depending on your taste, but if you have seen the previews or ads, then
you know exactly what you're in for.  The film knows its audience and
is aimed directly at sentimental viewers with an affection for
heartwarming/wrenching domestic tales.</P>
<P>     The story is about an African-American infant boy (played by cute
'n' cuddly Marc John Jeffries who inspires more "ahhs" than a tornado
in Kansas) abandoned by his crack-addicted mother Khaila (Halle Berry)
and ultimately adopted by the Lewins, an affluent white family.</P>
<P>     Three years pass, and after getting clean, Khaila wants her Isaiah
back.  The Lewin clan however, and especially Isaiah's new mother
Margaret (Jessica Lange), has inconveniently grown fond of the boy and
consider him an important part of the family.  They are after all, the
only family Isaiah has ever known.</P>
<P>     The battle which ensues for custody of the three-year-old traipses
across some volatile and controversial cultural lines--bringing to
the fore valid though contrary viewpoints from both sides of the
argument that "Black babies belong with black mothers."</P>
<P>     Yet while the surface debate concerns itself with the question of
whether motherhood can escape the boundaries of race and biology (as
opposed to being dependent on those very factors), the question which
gets no debate is whether the quality of a mother is determined by her
financial status.  For the film, the answer is unquestionably "yes."</P>
<P>     A major emphasis is placed on presenting Khaila to the court as
a competent mother.  Judging by the steps taken to achieve it,
competence in this film apparently depends upon one's decorating budget
and fashion sense.</P>
<P>     For when she is being prepared for her court appearance there
is a sequence of scenes (reminiscent of the A-Team preparing for the
climactic battle) in which all signs of her poverty are systematically
erased.  Her unkempt hair is redone in a corporate coif; in place of
sweatshirt and jeans, she is outfitted in a well-tailored suit accented
by a string of pearls on loan from her counselor; she is even relocated
from the friend's apartment in which she had been staying and provided
with more "respectable" housing (which she is promptly instructed to
decorate and repair).</P>
<P>     On the one hand, one can suppose that given the need to
convince the court, she needs to appeal to the aesthetics of the court
and its sense of propriety.</P>
<P>     But the affection for the facade is not exclusive to the
courtroom--Khaila is thrilled by the prospect of wearing real pearls
and the camera treats her initial courtroom appearance, the first time
we have seen the ensemble assembled, as if it were the second coming.
There is an utter absence of any sort of working-class consciousness.
The standards are the standards of the wealthy class, validating its
own aesthetic while condemning all else as inferior and
embarrassing--it is humiliating to be poor.</P>
<P>     The film makes no effort to address poverty except to equate it
with criminality and corruption.  "Why should I bother cleaning up,"
Khaila asks, "if someone is just going to look in, see what I've got,
and take it?"</P>
<P>     Beyond this specific impairment in the film's social vision, there
lies a more disturbing matter: the simplicity with which the film
ultimately treats the questions and issues it does recognize.  This
simplicity is both dangerous and damaging.  It is bound up in an idea
of entertainment as catharsis--a purging of emotions.  The idea is that
as one watches the Lewins cry, Khaila cry and Isaiah gurgle, all sorts
of emotions and energy will be stirred up ("I laughed, I cried, it was
better than Cats!" etc.).  By the time one is fed a resolution, all the
energy which was conjured up during the show is spent.</P>
<P>     While during the film one may be horrified by the injustice of
the court system, since it all works out in the end, that horror
evaporates with the credits.  Nothing is left to motivate the viewer
into action--for example to do something about the injustice of the
real court system.  In a sense, the make-believe solution to the Isaiah
dilemma has been substituted for a solution in the real world.  Rather
than a call to action, film becomes a $7 pacifier.</P>
<P>     The film responds to some of the most complex, and problematic
issues of our society by dismissing them with the vacuous simplicity of
"just say no" and "can't we all just get along?"</P>
<P>     Although it is undoubtedly a step forward to even attempt to
tackle this type of subject matter in a mainstream forum, in fact it
does damage to this same subject matter by trying to solve it in a
four-minute, spine-tingling, teary-eyed climax.</P>
<P>     Lurking behind the various cheap emotional tugs of LOSING ISAIAH
are extremely relevant social issues.  The film tries to take a good
hard look at the insane social imbalance which remains virtually
unscathed day after day, and for that LOSING ISAIAH deserves some
credit.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, these issues are treated as simply another set
of loose plot lines--that type which Hollywood loves to tie up just
before the credits with a big hug and dramatic swelling of the
soundtrack (usually violins).</P>
<P>     Hello?  With apologies to Sherlock Holmes, swelling violins
solve nothing.  If you are going to acknowledge an issue, acknowledge
it and allow it some weight.</P>
