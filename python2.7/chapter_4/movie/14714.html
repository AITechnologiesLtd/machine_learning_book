<P>Susan Granger's review of "CLAY PIGEONS" (Gramercy Pictures)</P>
<P> To call this a creepy black comedy is a serious
understatement.  This debut feature from director/producers Ridley and
Tony Scott's new Scott Free production company is about as "noir" as
film gets, this side of "Fargo." The story begins on a sweltering
summer day as two buddies, Gregory Sporleder and Joaquin Phoenix
("Return to Paradise"), are shooting at empty beer bottles in a canyon
near the sleepy town of Mercer, Montana. Suddenly, Gregory turns on
Joaquin, accusing him of having an affair with his wife (Georgina
Cates). Admitting the truth of the accusation, Joaquin tries to talk
him into lowering the gun but, instead, Gregory kills himself, making
it look as if Joaquin murdered him. That's just the beginning of this
twisted tale. Terrified, Joaquin covers up the killing and discovers
the hot-to-trot wife doesn't much care, since she soon takes up with a
swaggering cowboy, Vince Vaughn. This lusty, mysterious stranger also
befriends Joaquin. Then Janeane Garofalo shows up as an FBI agent
tracking a serial killer on the loose in the region. And more people
keep turning up dead. "I usually say, 'The more the merrier', but a
murder scene is not really crowd appropriate," she mutters
sardonically, criticizing the sheriff's penchant for allowing anyone
and everyone to mill around, inspecting evidence. Since he's sleeping
with one victim, dating another, and found a third, Joaquin becomes
the bewildered prime suspect, but writer Matt Healey and director
David Dobkin soon convince us that things are not always what they
seem. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Clay Pigeons" is a
silly, slick, surreal 6. It's more of the madness, mayhem, and murder
flooding the screens today.</P>
