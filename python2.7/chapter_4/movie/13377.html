<P>FOR ME AND MY GAL (1942) Directed by Busby Berkeley. Script by five
writers.  Cinematographer, William Daniels. Editing, Ben Lewis. Art
direction, Cedric Gibbons, Gabriel Scognamillo. Sets, Edwin B.Willis &
Keogh Gleason. Music director, George Stoll. Choreography, Bobby Connolly,
Gene Kelly. Cast: Judy Garland, George Murphy, Marta Eggerth, Gene Kelly,
Ben Blue, Horace McNally, Keenan Wynn, et al.</P>
<P>The movie is the result of the collaboration of two musical-movie greats:
director-choreographer Busby Berkeley and producer Arthur Freed. Producer
and lyricist Freed is synonymous with all those famous, big and lavish MGM
musicals. Among them: Meet Me In St. Louis, Easter Parade, On the Town,
Annie Get Your Gun, An American in Paris, Royal Wedding, Show Boat, Singin'
in the Rain,  Gigi.</P>
<P>"For Me and My Gal" is a backstage picture about vaudevillians, mostly Judy
Garland and Gene Kelly. It has lots of flag-waving since it was made during
World War II and deals with the WW I period. Kelly is a draft-dodger, who,
of course, gets redeemed. Basically this is routine nonsense, but made with
oomph, brio and strong production values.</P>
<P>The young Judy Garland has some charm and cuteness, though her voice is no
great shakes here. Curiously, Berkeley does not stage any chorines doing
his celebrated ensemble dancing. The picture is generally appreciated by
lovers of musicals, although it cannot rate at the top of the genre.
However, it should be quite appealing to connoisseurs and film historians
for the additional reason of its two debuts. This was Gene Kelly¹s first
major movie role as well as the first American film of Marta Eggerth.</P>
<P>In  1930s Europe, the Hungarian-born (1912) Marta (or Martha) was the
undisputed queen of German and Austrian musicals and filmed operettas. She
also made some notable musicals in Italy, the UK, and France. The king in
that category was her husband and sometimes co-star, Polish-born tenor Jan
Kiepura.</P>
<P>In that decade, on the Continent,  Eggerth and Kiepura were household
names. They were often refrerred to as Eggerth-Kiepura, the way, in
America, one spoke of the Jeanette MacDonald-Nelson Eddy musical
couple.This was a bit odd, as in reality, in the 22 films Eggerth made, and
in Kiepura's 13, the two singers appeared together only in two, both of
1934. (They did three more in post-war Europe)  but the performers were no
longer major names)</P>
<P>Those figures are quite unlike those for the melodious, romantic American
duo of MacDonald-Eddy. Jeanette made some 28 film in her career, Nelson,
20. They were together in 9.</P>
<P>In the late 1930s, after the Nazis had annexed Austria, both singers, still
very much at the height of their popularity, fled the violently
anti-Semitic "Greater Germany" and came to America. Alas, their fame did
not travel with them. They did not do all that well in the USA.</P>
<P>Kiepura at least did sing opera. Eggerth was only in two pictures: For Me
and My Gal  and, the following year, again with Judy Garland, Presenting
Lily Mars.</P>
<P>How sad was Madame Eggerth's professional situation in America can be
measured by her all too brief role in  For Me and My Girl, despite her
being listed third in the screen credits. Early on she sings her one and
only song, inside a special railroad car equipped with a grand piano.The
voice is lovely and beautifully controlled. Those few minutes make the
movie well worth watching. Yet, somehow, Hollywood must have decided that
her box-office appeal would be too small.</P>
<P>After World War II, the couple returned to Europe where they made their
remaining three films together, always in the same, light, operetta-ish
format. Madame Eggerth was also in a fourth, but without her husband. None
of those movies was particularly good or a real comeback for the singers
who soon after retired.</P>
<P>Kiepura died in 1966. Madame Eggerth remained in New York. Some years ago,
a friend who teaches German film in an Eastern college, invited her to one
of his yearly film festivals. She impressed all with her youthfulness,
naturalness and charm. She lives in the State of New York.</P>
