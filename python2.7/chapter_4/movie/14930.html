<P>At the center of Practical Magic are two immensely attractive women. 
The two women are, of course, Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman.  Both
are talented actresses, and have displayed their talents in many films. 
Any film in which they are visible for most of its running time is, by
definition, watchable.  Sometimes, however, they star in films that,
without their presence, would be simply unwatchable.  This is the case
with Practical Magic, which is a film so deeply entrenched in stupidity
that I fear my IQ dropped ten points from watching it.</P>
<P>Practical Magic is a the cinematic equivalent of a nuclear meltdown: 
it's disastrous from the first shot, and it only gets worse, waving its
wand of simpering senselessness over audiences until, finally, they
either give up or stumble out of the theater to safety.  This film gave
me a headache.  The bad dialogue attacked my ears.  The stupid concepts
assaulted my intelligence.  The pointless special effects scraped at my
eyes.  And it's all smashed together into one big wish-I-were-witty lump
by director Griffin Dune.  </P>
<P>It's the story of two sister witches, Sally and Gillian Owens (Bullock
and Kidman).  The film begins with a look into the past, as "their
ancestor" (as she's described) is shown to escape a hanging during the
Salem witch trials, thanks to her super special powers.  Flash ahead a
few hundred years, and our protagonists are young girls, learning that,
when they hear a certain kind of beetle squeak, then the man they love
is dead (this, of course, is how their father died).  So Sally wishes
never to fall in love, while Gillian can't wait to do so.  When the
setup finally ends, we're thwarted with a formula film of such
inescapable badness that I wonder if anyone was conscious during the
making of the film.  </P>
<P>Sally, as expected, wants to deny her witch heritage and raise a
family.  So, she meets and instantly falls in love with her
husband-to-be, who promptly dies after supplying her with a couple of
daughters.  Gillian, on the other hand, is running around in paradise,
drinking and dancing all the time.  But wait!  The plot synopsis isn't
done!  Conflicts arise when they accidentally murder Gillian's psycho
boyfriend.  Then, to give the film a romantic input, Aidan Quinn is
introduced as an investigator looking for the psycho (who, apparently,
is wanted in other cities for murder).  </P>
<P>This is the kind of film where every element is poorly conceived; the
most obvious deficiency is in the script.  Adapted from the novel by
Alice Hoffman, the story fails to recognize characters or plot on a
comfortable level.  Each character has one big trait:  Sally is
down-to-earth; Gillian is racy, etc.  And, due to the exceptional lack
of depth, story developments that are supposed to be sad and/or moving
strike with no impact whatsoever (the death of Sally's first husband,
for instance).  </P>
<P>The banality of the first half is soon accentuated by the pure idiocy
of the second half, which features elements from decent films like The
Frighteners the The Exorcist.  A good example of this is the scene in
which the psycho inhabits Gillian's body for no purpose at all.  When he
gets himself out, he's a black-and-white shade and really really crazy
(kinda like the spooks in The Frighteners).  It's poorly done and
derivative, but it's also pointless and unexplained.  The ending
sequence, which features a bunch of chanting soccer moms with brooms, is
truly abhorrent, and made me cringe with hatred.  </P>
<P>The strangest thing is that the film is totally arbitrary when it comes
to the magic and the witch stuff:  these women seem to have almost no
powers; all they seem to be capable of is putting people to sleep. 
Little details -- where the magic comes from, why these women are able
to use it, why the psycho comes back to life, why he keeps haunting them
(I could go on and on) -- are never explained or even hinted to.  But,
alas, by this point, I just wanted to escape the theater.  I was glad
they didn't spend more time explaining.</P>
<P>Dunne's direction is as misguided as any I've seen this year.  The film
shifts gears frequently, from soft and cuddly (scenes with the children)
to gooey and sentimental (all the romance junk between Bullock and
Quinn) to dark and evil (the ghost scenes) to slapstick comedy (anything
having to do with potions).  And it wants to be so funny; there are
scenes that try so hard to be edgy and wickedly clever (everything with
the psycho, for instance), but they all just fall flat.  It's a bubbling
cauldron of elements that make no sense and don't fit together.  I
longed for some consistency, some idea of what the film was trying to
accomplish.  It fails in every way:  I found none of it interesting,
engrossing, or funny.  </P>
<P>Well, I take that back.  Dianne Wiest is mildly amusing as one of two
aunt witches (the other is played by Stockard Channing, who just acts
silly).  The one scene that has a bit of life is the one in which
Gillian walks in on the soccer mom meeting and says, "Hold on to your
husbands, ladies!"  And, of course, there are two immensely attractive
women to look at.  But Practical Magic is just plain bad -- a confused
disaster, tedious and cloying and singularly moronic.  I'm sorry that
two beautiful women had to star in this example of stupidity; no matter
how attractive they are, their looks can't alleviate my aching brain.  </P>
