<PRE>THE TIGGER MOVIE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>In Disney's THE TIGGER MOVIE, Tigger is busily searching for a tree, but
not just any tree.  Hoping to be united with other tiggers, he's looking
high and low in the Hundred Acre Wood in hopes of discovering his family
tree.</P>
<P>In a world in which every kid's movie works hard to morph into a
full-fledged family movie by blending Woody Allen adult humor with STAR
WARS special effects, THE TIGGER MOVIE is a delightful throwback to a
simpler time -- a time when every kid's movie didn't feel obligated to
throw in vague sexual innuendoes and transparent bathroom humor and a
time when the animation didn't look like it was prepared on computers
sophisticated enough for nuclear weapons simulation.</P>
<P>This charming little picture, based on the beloved A. A. Milne
children's books, sets itself a modest goal of entertaining a crowded
room full of squirming youngsters and attains it admirably.  (Actually,
just keeping a bunch of little kids in their seats with their eyes
transfixed to the screen is probably rather an ambitious goal, as any
parent can attest.)  The more amazing part of the simple story is the
pleasant effect that it has on the adults.  Without a single line that
they can call their own, the old fogies in the audience will find
themselves just as touched by these wonderfully sweet characters.</P>
<P>Granted, not a lot happens in the movie, but the drawings are handsome
and the characters compelling and lively.  Tigger, voiced by Jim
Cummings, who also does the voice of Winnie the Pooh, does what tiggers
do best, which is lots of bouncing.  A high-spirited and good-spirited
character, Tigger is a character who deserves his own movie.</P>
<P>Tigger's a funny guy who says some of his precious old lines ("TTFN:
Ta-Ta For Now.") and some new ones.  Among the latter, a particularly
good example has Tigger describing his little buddy Roo as "lacking in
the perpendicular."</P>
<P>The gorgeous animation uses picture book images rather than realism in
the drawing.  This gives the movie a lush look that reminds you of
illustrated books from your childhood.  The movie sometimes comes back
to the book itself and lets the drawings on the pages come alive.</P>
<P>Among the show's other delights is a song-and-dance dream sequence
featuring rows of tiggers performing in everything from chorus lines to
synchronized swimming.</P>
<P>The message of the film is an old-fashioned one lifted straight out of
the WIZARD OF OZ: There's no place like home.  Tigger realizes that his
friends are his family.  Like the rest of the movie, it's a sweet and
simple theme, which is delivered with understated delicacy.</P>
<P>THE TIGGER MOVIE runs just 1:16.  It is rated G and has nothing to
offend or frighten anyone of any age.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 10, gave the film *** and remarked that it would be
great for all ages. He couldn't think of anything he didn't like about
it. His cousin William, age 5, loved the picture, giving it ****. His
favorite part was when the avalanche hit. William's sister, Liana, age
3, doesn't talk much. At her first theatrical movie, she was clearly
fascinated. On the edge of her seat through most of the picture, she
stared in big-eyed delight at it.</P>
