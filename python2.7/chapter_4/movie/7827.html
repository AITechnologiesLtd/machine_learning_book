<P>What else can I say so much already has been said about this movie?</P>
<P>But despite all of its wows and hypes there are some problems with it
that I just have to point out.</P>
<P>Firstly, a PG rating
Hmmmm I wonder how the kids responded to T-Rex ripping a man in half (I
mean it was all there to see, believe me Spielberg didn't hold back on
that one) or those carnivorous, 'hyena' like, tiny little dinosaurs
attacking a little girl, or hunting down a man in packs. Just wandering
if they inspire nightmares?</P>
<P>Then there's cute baby T-rex who has his leg broken and needs plastering
from those crazy scientists. Mom and Dad T-Rex soon come to the rescue
and before you know it, baby T-rex is free and a couple of scenes down
the track is running around quite happily (without the plaster) and
capable of feasting on a man (not so cute any more).</P>
<P>Then one of the scientists unloads the bullets of the guns of one of the
hunters, knowing quite well that T-Rex is on the hunt for them. Was he
hoping to make friends????????</P>
<P>Otherwise, Stephen Spielberg has done what he achieved with the original
Jurassic Park another dinosaur epic.</P>
<P>Those who like the original Jurassic will undoubtedly also like this
movie and will rate at least an 8/10</P>
<P>Those who didn't will probably give it a 6/10</P>
