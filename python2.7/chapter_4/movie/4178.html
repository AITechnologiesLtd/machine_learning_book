<PRE>                               TO DIE FOR
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     As Jimmy Durante used to say, "Everyone wants to get into the
act."  TO DIE FOR is the story of Suzanne Stone (Nicole Kidman) who
wanted the limelight so bad she let nothing stand in her way ... and
by nothing, we mean just that.</P>
<P>     Suzanne is married to Larry (Matt Dillon) and live in a small
town.  He is madly in love with her, as who would not be; she is
absolutely beautiful.  On the other hand, Suzanne's desire to be
"somebody" moves into an obsession and Larry has become an obstacle.</P>
<P>     Managing by coyness, aggressiveness, and her beauty, she talks a
local TV station into giving her a job as their weather-person.  From
there she embarks on the making of a documentary at a school where the
high school students hear her speak about the world of TV and the
opportunities available to anyone who wants to really go for it.  The
purpose of her talking to her students is in fact to select some losers
to do her a favor: get rid of her husband.</P>
<P>     I must say that I was surprised by Nicole Kidman.  That she was
pretty was obvious but in the film, when she turns on all her sexual
charms, she is stunning.  Her acting in the film is right on target.
That, in addition to the screenplay by the brilliant Buck Henry, make
for a very entertaining film.</P>
<P>     The students Suzanne inveigles into her scheme are played by
Joaquin Phoenix, Casey Affleck and Alison Folland.</P>
