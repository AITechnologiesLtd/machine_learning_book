<P>If there's one thing I hate, it's movies where adults acting juvenile is meant
to be humorous. You know, those films where we see adults making vulgar
remarks, farting, belching, and pulling silly faces. I was so sure that's what
I was in for about two minutes into FIERCE CREATURES that I jumped to the
conclusion it would be one of the worst films of the year. Luckily there's a
thing called improvement.</P>
<P>The cast of 1988's A FISH CALLED WANDA reunites nearly a decade later for yet
another wild comedy caper, this time surrounding the possible shutdown of a
zoo in Great Britain that was recently acquired by multi-billion dollar
industry, Octopus Inc. Kevin Kline, who won an Oscar for his performance in
the aforementioned film, plays a duel role as Octopus Inc. president Rod
McCain and his chauvinistic son, Vince. When the Marwood Zoo is taken under
the wings of the company, Vince finds himself traveling to England along with
Willa Weston (Jamie Lee Curtis), the seductive independent-woman type whose
business knowledge is hoped to improve the dwindling profit brought in by the
zoo. Right off the bat we're introduced to unfunny jokes such as "Are your
breasts real?". Why this is considered funny, I'll never know, and why Curtis'
character seems to react to every sexual-harassing comment with silent
flattery is another mystery.</P>
<P>When they actually arrive in England, things start to pick up pace, and if you
haven't given up on the film by then, you're actually in for quite a few
treats. Here we are introduced to Rollo Lee (John Cleese), a seemingly snooty
and self-absorbed zoo director whose plan for improving zoo profits involves
discarding all the furry, loveable animals and keeping only "fierce creatures"
on display. Once they got involved with the events taking place in the zoo,
signs of redemption begin making themselves known, and after the twenty or so
minutes of absolute awfulness, something wonderful happened. I found myself
laughing. Amazingly, it was something I found myself doing often from then on
out.</P>
<P>The idea to turn the zoo into a vicious-animal museum is soon forgotten as
Vince barges in and takes over. Putting Rollo in his place, he turns the zoo
into an advertising haven, where banners and posters for various companies
hang from every available structure, the zoo keeps uniforms start resembling
those worn by NASCAR racers, and illegitimate celebrity endorsements for
varying creatures are boasted. A lot of ideas sparkle with potential but
aren't fully realized as our attention turns more toward a possible Rollo-
Willa romance and a conniving Vince out to embezzle millions. Still, there is
a surprising amount of well-done physical comedy to keep us laughing without
insulting us with immature slapstick. It's just that those moments of
immaturity keep creeping up.</P>
<P>What brings FIERCE CREATURES down so much is several self-induced humor
wounds. Just as you begin forgetting how terrible things started out, they
throw in an off-balance joke that is so moronic, you worry everything good
will be lost. It becomes a comedic roller coaster, reaching fairly high,
gliding, and then plummeting very sharply to the trenches once again. Cleese
is who makes this worthwhile, and even with the always-strong Kline on board,
it's obvious that without Cleese, this film would have nothing. Cleese's
mixture of flubbering nervousness, yet self-righteous arrogance provides the
biggest laughs, which is in dire need alongside the consistently annoying
Curtis. (Personal note: why Curtis was ever considered sexy is one of the
great mysteries I've come to encounter in the world of cinema, ranking right
up there with John Leguizamo being considered a comic "talent")</P>
<P>FIERCE CREATURES is actually a highly enjoyable film bogged down with a high
tally of misfires. What could have been one of the funnest comedies of the
year has too many reminders of why it isn't. All this film needed to do to win
me over was grow up a little, but that was something it refused to do. Why
watching a group of adults acting more vulgar and base than a group of junior
high students is considred entertainment to some is beyond me. Sadly, FIERCE
CREATURES tests this theory a bit too much.</P>
<P>FIERCE CREATURES is one worth checking out on video, and if you utilize the
stale moments to jump up for another can of soda, this just might be the
perfect movie after all.</P>
