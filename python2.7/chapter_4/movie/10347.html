<P>Review of "The Blues Brothers" (1980) by Regis M. Donovan</P>
<P>"The Blues Brothers" has it all: music, romance, drama, stunts,
thrills, adventure, nuns, beer, whips, smashing bottles, bar fights, a
car chase through a shopping mall, hordes of police and military,
Aretha Franklin, a mission from God, and about a zillion cars crashing
into everything.  It's a no-holds-barred funhouse ride.</P>
<P>The plot is just enough to hold together the outstanding musical
numbers.  Jake (just relased from Joliet prison) and Elwood Blues are
informed by "the penguin" (Sister Mary Stigmata) that the orphanage
where they were raised is going to be closed for nonpayment of taxes.
Inspired by James Brown and many leaping flipping celebrants at a
gospel service, the brothers decide to put together their old band,
make enough money to pay the tax bill, and keep the world safe for
nuns wielding rulers.  While collecting the sometimes reluctant band
members, Jake and Elwood manage to incur the wrath of the police, the
American Nazi Party, a country & western band, and one very
destructive mystery woman.  Hijinks ensue.</P>
<P>The plot is not the thing that makes this movie great, however.  It's
the music, and the sheer fun the film has.  The Blues Brothers' Band -
with some help from Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, and Cab Calloway -
fill the film with classic performances.</P>
<P>"The Blues Brothers" clocks in at 133 minutes of silliness.</P>
