<P>Capsule Review:
One of the dangers of being a hard-core movie freak, besides a 
diminished social life and the threat of accidentally seeing something 
starring Pauly Shore, is the possibility of burnout. I was in an 
extremely ashen phase when I stumbled across the low-budget Hong Kong 
flick. Things haven't been quite the same since. Watching director Wong 
Kar-Wei's goofy ode to dysfunctional relationships is the most fun I've 
had with a movie since John Woo's legendary THE KILLER. A barely 
connected pair of stories filmed in kamikaze fashion (Kar-Wei would 
write scenes in the afternoon and shoot them that same night), this 
borders on complete incoherence at times, but always manages to recover 
to spectacular effect. The first story involves a lovesick cop, a 
blonde-wigged female smuggler who can blow away a roomful of bad guys in 
the time that it takes Stallone to remember a line, and 31 cans of 
pineapple. The second, and infinitely more amusing, story features 
another cop (Woo regular Tony Leung, who picked up a Chinese Oscar for 
his great work here) and his wacked-out relationship with a waitress who 
constantly breaks into his apartment to redecorate. To say anything more 
would be to spoil the fun.</P>
<P>At its best moments, this movie delivers a sustained jolt of pure 
cinema; it'll get you high.</P>
