<PRE>Pushing Tin
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1999 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*** (Out Of ****)</PRE>
<P>Competition is one of the almighty forces in the universe. In the course of
human affairs it ranks up there with gravity, nuclear fission and sex.</P>
<P>When I was a kid, we were told that competition was the main difference
between communism and capitalism. We had it, they didn't and because of that,
their economic system was doomed to failure. Plus they were godless which was
almost, but not quite as bad.</P>
<P>Competition is what drives wars. For 50 years the Soviet Union wanted to be
King Of The World as did the United States. Oddly enough for a non-competitive
country they were as aggressive as we were.</P>
<P>Competition causes men and women to do weird stuff. It's behind the macho and
catty attitudes. It's why people can be remarkably stupid in the presence of
the opposite sex. It causes individuals to cheat, lie and steal to get ahead
in their careers.</P>
<P>It's also one of the reasons that some perform at their peak and do
extraordinary work.</P>
<P>Nick "The Zone" Falzone (John Cusack) is a competitive guy. And he's the best.
An air traffic controller at the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control, he
guides planes at three major airports with rapid fire commands.</P>
<P>It's a frantic job. The facility controls 7,000 flights a day. Controllers are
responsible for thousands of lives a day. Sitting at radar scopes, they are
one with the electronic images. They stare through the screen into a virtual
3-D world with the same concentration that teenage video game players possess.</P>
<P>After work, they play with the same intensity. Drinking, flirting in cafes,
shooting hoops, catching a quickie with their wives: everything is fast and furious.</P>
<P>Nick's life is good. In the small town of Controllerville, he's top dog.
Until, that is, a new gun moves in. Russell Bell (Billy Bob Thornton) shoves
aside the chair on rollers, pulls up his own folding chair, sticks a feather
in his hair and gazes into the scope with a Zen-like serenity.</P>
<P>Russell is a wonder, stacking up planes like no one has seen before. He shows
up Nick. Even worse, he does it without breaking a sweat. He effortlessly
bests Nick's free throw record at a barbecue. All the wives are agog in the
presence of the mysterious stranger. Nick is fueled by caffeine and
adrenaline. Russell is a smooth as silk.</P>
<P>Nick can't stand it and begins his search for a way to win the rivalry. Soon
his paranoia takes over and he starts to lose it. Is Russell playing the
one-upmanship game or is he just who he is?</P>
<P>The actors are first rate. Cusack masters his quirky obsessed character and
makes it seem as easy as rolling off a log. Thornton retains his impressive
presence he's shown in other films and captivates the screen.</P>
<P>The women are equally skilled although they don't get as much screen time.
Cate Blanchett is Nick's wife Connie, a middle class floosie with a look of
intelligence behind her eyes. There isn't a second you don't believe that's
who she is. Her performance is particularly impressive when you realize this
is the same woman who played a completely different role in "Elizabeth".</P>
<P>Angelina Jolie, as Russell's child bride Mary, is the film's hot babe. When
she struts through a backyard party, leather-clad, pouty-lipped and exhibiting
abundant cleavage, the men are speechless. She and Nick have dinner in an
Italian restaurant after he chances upon her crying in a supermarket. While
they are talking, she slowly tastes one of her fingers and his fidelity is a
lost cause.</P>
<P>Mary is the woman that every man would like to meet - until they discover the
foundation of her personal food pyramid is vodka.</P>
<P>The film has dozens of sub-plots maneuvered like the tiny blips on radar,
lining up one after another. Although most glide to smooth landings, some
meander around and eventually crash into the Atlantic. The individual scenes
are well crafted, but a few don't work together.</P>
<P>The story's weakness is the ending. Not completely unsatisfying, it still
feels out of synch with the rest of the movie. Like many films recently, it
could have ended about ten minutes earlier.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman has written film columns since before the invention of
moveable type and thinks he's going to take the train on his next trip. Email
