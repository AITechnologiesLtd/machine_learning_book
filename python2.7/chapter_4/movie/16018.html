<PRE>Home is Where the Steam Is</PRE>
<P>Review of Hamam (1997, Italian and Turkish with English subtitles; a/k/a
Steam: The Turkish Bath)</P>
<P>"Go like the tide and come back like the tide," says a Turk to a visiting
Italian in Istanbul. That's the tone of *Hamam*. Life is slow and easy in
this crowded, ancient corner of Istanbul (not Constantinople), and
presented as a pleasant alternative for the stressed out and skinny
Westerners looking to unwind, get real, and live fuller lives. </P>
<P>Whether this is true or not of Turkey, this is the reality of *Hamam*.
Francesco (Alessandro Gassman) inherits a building in the Turkish capital
from an aunt he's never met. He leaves his shrill wife Marta (Francesca
D'Aloja) back in Italy while he goes to wrap up his aunt's affairs. But he
sure does take his time when he realizes three things. First, his property
included a steam bath, a hamam. Second, he discovers that Zozo (Zozo
Toledo), who is pressuring him to sell, is working for a woman who wants
to tear down the whole area and build a conference center and office
complex. Oh, third, he's gay. He figures this out when the son and
daughter of his aunt's servants eye him pruriently, and the son (Mehmet
Gunsar) wins. Shades of *Boudu Saved from Drowning*...</P>
<P>An interesting device is the narration of his aunt's letters to his
mother, which were returned unopened. "One must be happy in life; one
must," she tells her sister. They are estranged, but we never find out
why. Like a prescient Auntie Mame, she sees ahead to the adult Francesco
as someone with "eyes that see desires and strong arms to accomplish
them." And that's what happens. Once in the bosom of his aunt's servants'
family life, where he becomes one of them, he decides to restore the hamam
to its former glory; it faded as the hamam's went out of vogue, probably
due to indoor plumbing and increased Western influence. Francesco's
restoration efforts are seen with a voiceover of the aunt's letter that
details her own restoration of the building years earlier.</P>
<P>Because Italian moviegoers are treated to Intermission, the film had the
"part one/part two" markers. This is interesting, as it delineates two
distinct movements in the film: Istanbul's seduction of Francesco, and
having to face the wife with his new life when she turns up after
Francesco stays there a wee bit too long.</P>
<P>*Hamam* succeeds in its storytelling, accentuating the cultural
differences with humor (the Italians are told constantly they are too
skinny) and observation (women "share secrets" by yelling out the windows
to each other; circumcisions are a public event, but the boys are about
ten years old). The music is also very stirring, sweeping you up
feverishly in what seems like an otherwise quiet lifestyle.</P>
<P>Pushed to gay audiences with a sexy poster of two towel-clad men facing
away from the camera, very little sex, much less male pulchritude, is
offered to us. Pushed to straight audiences with a photo of the couple,
there is very little of them together until the second half.</P>
<P>Like *When the Cat's Away*, Hamam shows the small unsung joys of living in
a metropolitan enclave facing "urban renewal" and changes in a way of life
that doesn't need changing. And despite an appalling human rights record,
life in *Hamam*'s Turkey looks mighty appealing.</P>
<P>Directed by Ferzan Ozpetek and original music by Aldo De Scalzi and Pivio.</P>
