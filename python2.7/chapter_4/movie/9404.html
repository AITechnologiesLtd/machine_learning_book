                           VEGAS VACATION 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
                  2 :-( :-(  for a forgettable holiday</PRE>
<P>Cast:  Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, Randy Quaid, Ethan Embry, Marisol
Nichols. Screenplay:  Elisa Bell. Director:  Stephen Kessler.</P>
<P>What was I expecting on this vacation? A five star hotel with a
presidential suite and adjoining swimming pool and spa? Fool. I'm
forgetting that this is a Chevy Chase movie, where pearls are tossed to
swine. I should have rented "Leaving Las Vegas" instead, in which case I
would have got a budget motel and a bargain priced prostitute. Then at
least I would have been spared the meaningless squander of the Griswald
Clan. After four Vacations, "National Lampoon's", "European",
"Christmas" and now "Vegas", I think the next family outing should be
kept a private affair.</P>
<P>I have great difficulty remembering the basic plot elements with any
Chevy Chase movie. In particular the ones where he goes on holiday with
his family. What do they end up doing? How does it start or end? The
truth is I can't remember. Aren't movies meant to be memorable, the good
ones at least. So one can reflect back and say that was a good movie
because -- My single memory of any Vacation movie is of a cyclist who
starts spurting blood from all his major vessels, after being run down
by the Griswald family. Not one for the family photo album I'm afraid.</P>
<P>Little happens in this movie that hasn't already joined the black hole
of lost thoughts lingering in my mind. The children, now grown up go
their worldly ways as their father abandons the family to the guile of
gambling. The wife, lonely and miserable falls into the arms of Wayne
Newton. The movie climaxes when they steal a winning lottery ticket from
a dead man. Which brings up the only thought provoking moment of the
entire movie. Would you do the same?</P>
