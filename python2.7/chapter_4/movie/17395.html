<PRE>Evaluation: ***1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Waiting at the train station near the beginning of Fury, Joe says: `After
all, we're human.' In the context of events to transpire, Joe's line is
prophetic, foreshadowing the internal conflict of the protagonist in the
latter half of the film. Does being human necessarily imply humane behavior?
Through the baseness of human character exemplified in the formation of a
mob, Fritz Lang prompts the viewer to consider whether our inclination
towards impulsiveness supersedes our civility.  Expressing his abhorrence
towards the rise of Nazism in his homeland, Lang takes great care in
creating a sense of discomfort during the scenes of mob hysteria.</P>
<P> In the scene prefacing the lynching, the mob achieves critical mass at the
bar. Deputy Meyers is brought in as an exalted informant, but when he is
unable to augment the mob's myth of Joe, he is quickly renounced from his
position as town gossip. We see in a shot where two bar patrons are arguing
that the deputy looks around nervously at the growing monster and then
carefully slips out of the bar. What is quietly horrifying is the
realization by both the audience and the deputy that the crowd no longer
exists within the confines of reason and has succumbed to what the barber
referred to as impulse. What once was excitement to the deputy has turned
into fear with the realization that he is now powerless. To the audience,
the deputy's quiet exit concurs with their own sinking feeling of uneasiness
as the mob's delirium crescendos. Lang educes this discomfort not through
movement of the camera, but rather its stillness. The shot's composition
places the audience equidistant and directly across from the pair of arguing
patrons and the Deputy effectively becomes a mirror to our own
apprehensions. As the intensity of the mob closes around Deputy Meyers, it
does so around the viewer as well. The stationary camera in this shot
heightens our fears because when the Deputy escapes, we are deserted by our
reflection and the viewer becomes the sole proprietor of sensibility amongst
a swarm of irrationality. Because the camera does not track the Deputy's
movement, we are left with an amplified perception of desertion and
vulnerability.</P>
<P>As the bar scene progresses, the camera pans 180 degrees to reveal the fury
of the mob. This shot is unique because it is a point-of-view shot where the
audience, not a character in the film is the subject. While a long, or dolly
shot may objectively reveal the size of the mob, panning from the mob's
belly distorts the audience's spatial reference and exaggerates the
claustrophobia of the scene; we feel we are at the epicenter of something
infinitely large. We see close shots of people's faces, contorted by their
rage. With the pivot of the pan being in the center of the mob and angry
members within a short radius of the pan, Lang offers the viewer a sense of
what it feels like to be the subject of a lynching. In this shot the
audience is at the mercy of the mob; Lang's camera makes us feel vulnerable
and powerless as Joe must have felt in the jail. In some greater sense, it
must have been what Lang felt when he saw his countrymen overcome with
unjustifiable hatred towards their own humankind.  Lang's observations of
his fellow man succumbing to mob behavior left him with an indelible image
of malevolent human behavior.</P>
<P>As Joe faces his peril, trapped in his burning cell, his dog Rainbow rushes
to be by his side. Lang makes Rainbow a martyr to contrast his humanity
against the recklessness of his human counterparts. Using his camera to
create shots that elicit disturbing images of mob mentality, Lang depicts
man's volatility and `impulse' towards inconceivable cruelty. Reprising Joe'
s line at the train station, we are induced to question why our primeval
impulses so easily transcend our humanity.</P>
