The Matrix</PRE>
<PRE>A review by M. Pierce</PRE>
<P>  In a dark hotel room, a women sits in front of a computer.  Cops bust through
the door, telling her to freeze and put her hands up in the air.  Down stairs,
a couple of mysterious FBI-type men, later known as Agents, tell the captain of
the police force that his men are already dead, that the women has most likely
escaped.</P>
<P>  How is this possible?  As we watch the first spellbinding minutes of The
Matrix, we are drawn into a masterfully created work of brilliance, a film so
absorbing and exciting, it is nevertheless an instant classic.  One of the true
great science fiction films ever to unfold on the silver screen.  I would rank
it right up on the list with Star Trek: First Contact, The X-Files motion
picture, and Andrei Tarkovski's Solaris.</P>
<P>  I hate to write long, drawn-out reviews, especially of films I really like,
so, for The Matrix, all I will say is See This Movie Before It Escapes The
Cineplexes!  Not only are the special effects truly amazing, the action
breathtaking, and the acting wonderful, the plot is a brilliant story, so well
thoughtout, so eluded with creativity, it simply is a state of movie magic,
"cinematic gold."</P>
