<P>     Winner of the Camera d'Or at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, LOVE 
SERENADE, the feature debut of Australian director Shirley Barrett, has 
the kind of nasty, biting wit that juries at film festivals seem to 
appreciate.  For the most part, movies tend to tell the stories of love 
affairs between the "right" people, with romance and fate being an 
integral part of the mix.  LOVE SERENADE is a clear exception -- call it 
an anti-romantic comedy.  And, unlike Ellen DeGeneres' failed MR. WRONG, 
with which it shares a few superficial characteristics, LOVE SERENADE is 
well-written and ably acted.</P>
<P>     There aren't many characters in LOVE SERENADE, which takes place in 
an almost-deserted outback town called Sunray.  We're introduced to a 
pair of sisters, Dimity (Miranda Otto) and Vicki-Ann (Rebecca Firth), 
who share a house.  Dimity, the shy and insecure sibling, is a waitress 
at a local Chinese restaurant.  Vicki-Ann, the brash one, is a hair 
stylist.  Both are, in their own way, looking for love, although the 
prospects in Sunray seem bleak, at best.  That is, until Ken Sherry 
(George Shetsov) moves into the house next door.</P>
<P>     To Dimity and Vicki-Ann, Sherry is a star.  A journeyman radio 
personality who was once on the air in Brisbane, Sherry has come to 
Sunray to take a deejay's job at the local FM station.  The sisters, 
enthralled by his apparently urbane, cultured manner, fail to recognize 
what a slimy person he is.  Sherry has the mannerisms and appetites of a 
snake.  He is cold, calculating, and cruel.  He engages in mechanical 
sex, not because he likes it, but because it's a means to give him 
power.  His dead eyes reflect an equally lifeless soul.  Actor George 
Shetsov does a marvelous job bringing this character to life in all of 
his sinister glory.</P>
<P>     In their own way, the sisters are both innocents.  Dimity, who is 
played with great appeal by Miranda Otto, falls for Sherry when he 
arrives at her restaurant for a meal.  Her clumsy "seduction" of him 
leads to a brief tryst that doesn't sit well with Vicki-Ann, who has set 
her sights on the disc jockey as a potential husband.  As the brazen 
sister, Rebecca Firth's performance is the most broadly comic in the 
film, and occasionally seems a little too over-the-top.</P>
<P>     The first thirty minutes of LOVE SERENADE are nearly perfect.  The 
script is clever, the acting is fresh, and the cinematography is 
interesting.  Thereafter, however, things start to become repetitive, 
leading to several patches where the proceedings drag.  Fortunately, the 
level of humor remains consistently high and the film never loses its 
edge, even when it's spinning its wheels.  And the ending is definitely 
worth staying for.</P>
<P>     As has become commonplace in Australian films, the soundtrack is 
bloated with '70s songs, many of which we haven't heard since they 
stopped playing on the radio two decades ago.  In this film, there's a 
twist -- the lyrics of the songs are matched perfectly to the scenes 
they're used in.  The movie's title comes from a Barry White hit that 
the writer/director calls the "creepiest seduction song" that she has 
ever heard.</P>
<P>     LOVE SERENADE is a sly, quirky offering guaranteed to appeal to 
anyone who is sick of screen romances that always work out for the best.  
In fact, this is one film where we pray that the leads don't get 
together in the end.  Shirley Barrett has done an effective job of 
combining acid humor and parody with a somewhat more serious subtext 
about unrealistic expectations.  The resulting motion picture is 
considerably different from the usual multiplex fare, and all the more 
worthwhile because of it.</P>
