<PRE>                           THE BIG LEBOWSKI
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: The Coen Brothers tell their funniest
          story since RAISING ARIZONA.  Jeff Bridges plays an
          aging, burned-out hippie pulled into the weird
          goings-on after the wife of a famous multi-
          millionaire is kidnapped.  The film is big-time
          funny, has a host of really weird characters and
          tremendous visual imagination, but could have used
          a stronger third act.   Rating: 8 (0 to 10), high
          +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Now I claim what is going on here is that a cowboy without much
respect for the sort of people he finds in Los Angeles, spins the
gull-darnedest yarn about a guy he met in a bar a couple of times.  But
there will probably be other interpretations.</P>
<P>     Jeff Bridges plays a laid-back aging hippie who happens to have
the same name, Jeff Lebowski, as a famous philanthropist, though the
hippie prefers being called The Dude.  That sounds like it could be a
good thing, but the philanthropist has enemies and some of the no-so-
bright ones confuse the two and take their ire out on The Dude.  After
discussing the situation with his close bowling buddies, para-military
Walter Sobchak (a hilarious role for John Goodman) and low-voltage
surfer Donny (Steve Buscemi), The Dude figures there is nothing he can
do but face the Big Lebowski (David Huddlestone).  The Big Lebowski at
first has little use for someone with The Dude's marginal life-style,
but he finds a use when his wife is kidnapped and he needs someone to
drop off the million-dollar ransom.  The Dude wants to play it
straight, but Sobchak figures if they play their cards right he and The
Dude could split the million.</P>
<P>     Only the Coen Brothers could tell a story this complicated, this
weird, and with so many characters on so many different frequencies.
The film is full of weirdoes, many of whom are present only to add
texture. John Tuturro, missing from films for a while, plays the
totally superfluous role of Jesus, the bowling rival of our heroes.
The over-ripe Jesus practically dances a flamenco every time he throws
the ball.  Then their are the nihilist bikers.  And if the script does
not add enough weird characters, the character you think you know get
weirder and weirder.</P>
<P>     Raymond Chandler used to add a touch of the surreal to his mystery
stories whenever his detective was knocked out by telling us Marlowe's
dreams while he was unconscious.  But then Philip Marlowe was only an
amateur at hallucinating.  He was not a stoned-out hippie like The
Dude.  Conk The Dude on the bean and you get weird bowling dreams that
are worth the price of admission by themselves.  The Coen Brothers have
incredible visual imagination and tremendous good humor.  Comedies of
late have been mild smile- along-with-Sandra-Bullock sorts of things.
The only recent film that made me laugh out loud recently was MIDNIGHT
IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL.  But it has been a good while since I
have laughed as hard as I did at THE BIG LEBOWSKI.  The only real
problem with the script is the plot lacks a strong finish.  After a
strong first and second act, the film has a much lower-key third act
that resolves the mystery but lacks the strength and the humor of the
first two.  The film needed a wild finish and goes soft and sentimental
at the wrong time.</P>
<P>     This is a film that has great visuals and has genuine laugh-out-
loud humor.  If it has a weak spot it is only that the story is just
okay, but that is not really the point.  I rate it 8 on the 0 to 10
scale and a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
