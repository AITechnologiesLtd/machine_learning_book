<PRE>BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD DO AMERICA
Review By David Wilcock (C)1998</PRE>
<PRE>Starring Mike Judge, Bruce Willis, Demi Moore and Robert
Stack</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Mike Judge</PRE>
<P>The two thickest, rudest and sex desperate teenagers on MTV
finally made there way to the movies with this uneven, but usually
funny road movie. The film opens with Beavis and Butthead (both
voiced by Mike Judge) waking up to find that they television has
been stolen. While searching for it, they stumble into Muddy's
(voiced by Bruce Willis) motel room. Muddy mistakes Beavis and
Butthead for two murderers he hired to 'do' (i.e kill) his wife
(voiced by Willis' real life wife, Demi Moore) Naturally, the boys
mistake 'do' for 'have sex with' his wife, and go to 'do' his wife.
When they finally reach the wife, she tells them to kill Muddy, and
also hides a deadly virus into Beavis's pants, which the F.B.I are
after. Soon, our heroes have Muddy, the wife, and the F.B.I all
trying to kill them. </P>
<P>Beavis and Butthead prove to be their normal irritating, yet
strangely likeable selves. There are some good movie references,
such as King Kong (1933) and every single blaxploitation film
ever made (such as the classic Shaft (1971)) The voices are
good, with Bruce Willis and Demi Moore delivering fine
performances, and an resonable funny Robert Stack (1941
(1979), Airplane! (1980)) as a cavity searching obsessed F.B.I
officer. </P>
<P>But although the performances are good, the jokes are hit and
miss. I have never watched Beavis and Butthead on MTV, so this
was the first time I was introduced to their world. Some of the
gags are great (such as an hippy teacher singing 'Lesbian Seagull,'
before being flattened by a door) yet some are pretty awful (such
as Cornholio, which, although funny at first, started to grow on my
nerves.) Thankfully, though, the film is not particulary long (about 1
hour 20 minutes) so when the gags do start running out, the film is
about to end anyway.</P>
<P>Fans of the television show will probably enjoy this far more than I
did, but I would still recommend this film to people who are
unfamiliar with Beavis and Butthead. There are some good jokes
in there, and the film is resonably good fun. Overall, then, this a
enjoyable, if not particulary smart, comedy.</P>
<PRE>OVERALL= *** out of *****</PRE>
