<PRE>THE ASTRONAUT'S WIFE
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR></PRE>
<P>Rating: * (out of four)
New Line / 1:46 / 1999 / R (language, violence, clothed sex)
Cast: Charlize Theron; Johnny Depp; Joe Morton; Clea DuVall; Donna
Murphy; Nick Cassavetes; Blair Brown
Director: Rand Ravich
Screenplay: Rand Ravich<HR></P>
<P>In "The Astronaut's Wife," Charlize Theron plays a young woman with a
nervous demeanor , pixie-hairdo and demon spawn unwittingly growing in
her belly. If only her name wasn't Jillian, the makers of this
embarrassing bit of sci-fi shlock could have come up with a far more
appropriate title: "Rosemary's Species." What a shame it is to see such
a gifted actress as Theron - Oscar-worthy in "The Devil's Advocate" -
struggle with the lamest rip-off of a screendom classic in recent
memory.</P>
<P>OK, maybe "The Astronaut's Wife" deviates from "Rosemary's Baby" turf
for its set-up, which finds our heroine terrorized not by Satan's
minions but her possessed husband (Johnny Depp), a shuttle pilot whose
mission mishap leaves him, um, a changed man. Predictably, he and the
missus get it on in a sequence best described as unpleasant, his evil
seed impregnating her with twins and realizing that great "Bowfinger"
line about "alien love." Theron's "Advocate" character faced a similar
dilemma, the horror there resonating strongly. "Astronaut" provides only
artificial anxiety.</P>
<P>Last year's equally noodle-headed "Species II" spun a similar premise
about the breeding habits of an extraterrestrial on earth, but at least
that movie more or less knew it was garbage. "The Astronaut's Wife" is
grave and humor-free, passing its increasingly silly story off as
full-fledged serious, right down to an ambiguous finale that isn't even
going to satisfy those who've stayed with it thus far. Here's a hint: It
involves lots of water, electrical equipment, a special effect from "The
Abyss" and the tots who doubled up as Adam Sandler's co-star in "Big
Daddy." Draw your own conclusions.</P>
<P>Director/writer Rand Ravich coats the proceedings in dynamic sights
masterminded by legendary "E.T." cinematographer Allen Daviau, but too
often favors the film's visual presentation over the story he's trying
to tell. This bodes horribly for each dramatic development, like the
surfacing of a suspicious NASA official ("Speed"'s Joe Morton) to
instigate Jill's slow and stupid comprehension of the truth. His
hyper-erratic behavior is probably supposed to give Wife a paranoid
edge. Instead, he adds to the phoniness.</P>
<P>Theron and Depp are certainly beyond this junk and will get other
chances to prove themselves this fall - she as part of an imposing
ensemble case in the John Irving adaptation "Cider House Rules," he in
the lead of Tim Burton's eagerly-awaited "Sleepy Hollow." Undeserving of
such talent, "The Astronaut's Wife" manages to be derivative, dull and
uninvolving despite its seemingly ripe potential for unintentional
laughs. In space, no one can hear you scream. But in a movie theatre,
everyone can hear you snore.<HR></P>

"The best possible argument for including [a shot of Bruce] Willis'
genitals would have been that the movie, after all, contains everything
else." -Roger Ebert on "Color of Night"</P>
