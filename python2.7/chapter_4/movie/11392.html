.                             THE REAL BLONDE
                        A film review by Bradley Null
                         Copyright 1998 Bradley Null</PRE>
<P>     Daryl Hannah plays the titular character in "The Real Blonde," which
does not bode well, considering the fact that the last film in which Hannah
had this distinction was 1993's "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman."  Nonetheless,
 the film manages to achieve a degree of respectability (far surpassing the
debacle that was "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman"), but not much else.</P>
<P>     The subjects of this film are the intertwined worlds of modeling, soap
operas, and music videos in New York City, and given the nature of these
industries, it is obvious from the beginning that the film's director (Tom
DiCillo of "Living in Oblivion" fame) is setting us up for another stale
commentary about the superficiality of these image industries with little
actual plot to revolve around.</P>
<P>     In contrast to "Living in Oblivion," wherein DiCillo focused on the
humor surrounding the mishaps of a low-budget film production, "The Real
Blonde" is centered primarily around the dramatic and moral issues that
those involved with these image-oriented industries undergo.  Sadly, the
humor is lost, despite the presence within the film of such talented comic
artists as Christopher Lloyd, Buck Henry, and Dave Chappelle.</P>
<P>     Despite this limitation, the film does contain some interesting
elements.  At a certain point in the movie, we begin to realize that "The
Real Blonde" is not only criticizing the three industries mentioned above
for their obsession with sex objects and artifice, but it is
self-reflexively criticizing itself for focusing on the same artificial
reality.  Additionally, the startling intrusions of the intermittent dream
sequences are also pleasantly appealing.</P>
<P>     Ultimately, despite solid performances by Matthew Modine as Joe, a
struggling serious actor who takes on background work in a Madonna video to
get his foot in the door, newcomer Maxwell Caulfield who is convincingly
creepy as Joe's former best friend turned soap star, and Elizabeth Berkeley,
continuing her slow post-"Showgirls" return to the living with a solid
performance as a Madonna body-double, the film fails to follow through with
any true substance.</P>
<P>     "The Real Blonde" is as artificial as the world that it portrays.</P>
