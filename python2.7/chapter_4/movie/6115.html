<P>     The writing and directing debut of Tom Hanks is very much like his
screen persona:  pleasant, witty, and entirely inoffensive.  THAT THING
YOU DO!  is about a fictional '60's pop band (from Erie, PA) who find
fame and fortune with their first recorded song.  (That song they do,
which you'll soon love to hate, is played at least ten times during the
movie.  Or is it eleven?) Most of the story (about 90 minutes worth) is
devoted to the *rise* of the band and, once that's over, what happens
afterward is all but ignored.  No problem!  The obvious intent, here, is
a feel-good, everybody's happy period piece with lots of freshly
scrubbed faces and plenty of upbeat, uptempo, up up up music.  Few
frowns are allowed, thank you very much, which I guess means a movie
better suited to Beatles people than Elvis people.  (Somewhere you have
to make a choice.) And, if you winced at the modern-sounding soundtrack
of GRACE OF MY HEART, be prepared for more canned music.  Damn slick,
like every- thing else.  Frankly, I didn't like this movie.  Despite the
honest laughs, an appealing cast, and a couple of very personal cameos,
it was just too nice for my tastes. </P>
