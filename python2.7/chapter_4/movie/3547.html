<PRE>                           WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  This is a cute puppy-dog of a film
     with a cute puppy-dog of an actress.  The film called
     for a collection of characters that is a little weird
     but adorable.  It was close, but the family was never as
     winning as intended.  This is an amusing but fluffy
     romantic comedy.  Rating: low +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Preston Sturges could have had a good time with this story.  John
Turteltaub is no Preston Sturges, but he is at least able to make it
into an amiable comedy.  Sandra Bullock plays Lucy, a drab and lonely
token-booth attendant for the Chicago Transit Authority.  Her life is
dreams.  She dreams of travel,   She dreams of getting a nice boy
friend.  She dreams of having a family.  And Turteltaub dreams of the
audience believing Sandra Bullock as a drab and lonely token-booth
attendant with no boyfriends.  Lucy does have a dream boyfriend, a
well-heeled and handsome man who comes by her CTA station.  One lonely
Christmas the family-less Lucy is working and her dream boyfriend is
mugged on the platform and falls into the path of an approaching train.
Lucy saves his life and takes the unconscious man--Peter as she
discovers his name is (appropriately played by Peter Gallagher)--to a
hospital.  There a careless comment gives a nurse the impression that
Lucy is really the now-comatose Peter's fiancee.  In the sort of comedy
of errors that can occur only in the most contrived of stories, when
Peter's somewhat strange family show up, they hear Lucy referred to as
Peter's fiancee and they also believe it.  Peter's family adopts Lucy
as a prospective family member that they have never met.  Further
complicating matters is that Peter's brother Jack (Bill Pullman) is
skeptical that brother Peter would have gotten engaged to Lucy without
Jack finding out.  He sets out to prove that Lucy is not what she
appears to be.</P>
<P>     This is a film with its heart in the right place, and one with a
good sense of humor.  But it just does not have the polished style ofa
professionally made film.  There are mismatched styles of humor that
often conflict with each other.  Pieces of slapstick are thrown into
what is mostly a comedy of personality.  Much of the humor is built
around the eccentric conversations of Peter's family.  Somehow this
joke just does not work as well as scriptwriters Daniel G. Sullivan and
Frederic Lebow think it does.</P>
<P>     Sandra Bullock has been winning in SPEED and was likable in
DEMOLITION MAN, but here she overplays her personality.  She gives the
kind of performance in which you can read her every emotion, just a
little too exaggerated, on her face.  That works for a while, but the
slight overplaying eventually makes her seem sappy and unctuous.  It
may well have been a director's decision since Peter Gallagher also
seems to have the same problem, though luckily for Gallagher he is not
on the screen and conscious long enough to allow it to become
irritating.  Several good veteran character actors are also present
including Jack Warden, Glynis Johns, and Peter Boyle are present but do
not have sufficient screen time to show us any acting touches that we
have not seen from them many times previously.</P>
<P>     WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING is no great classic of cinema.  In fact,
to all appearances it no more than a light Christmas programmer that
got delayed in its release.  If it has no great virtues, at least it
has no great faults either.  This piece of feather-light holiday fluff
gets a low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
