<P>The 1957 British film musical version of THE GOOD COMPANIONS (Directed by J.
Lee Thompson for Associated British) creates a world far removed from the
present in which a different, cosier set of values reigns, which
isseductively attractive to those of a certain age. In the opening scene of
the film the world of the theatre concert party is compared by a heartless
theatre manager with the emerging culture of 'rock n' roll, striptease and
television', and indeed the form of the film itself, in its use of
widescreen, colour and enchanced sound (it is likely that at the film's
premiere engagement at the Warner cinema in London's Leicester Square, the
film had  enchanced sound, as ABPC Elstree was experimenting with
'perspecta' (pseudo stereo) sound at this time), it directly takes on the
new domestic competition of television, which was beginning to take hold of
the British viewing public by 1957. In this old world is philanthropic
spinster Miss Trant (Celia Johnson), living comfortably in middle age, and
very much Laura Jesson from BRIEF ENCOUNTER, if she had not married Fred in
that classic film. Her encounter with the struggling concert party, the
'Dinky Doos', and the world of the touring theatre as depicted by J.B.
Priestley is well known to English audiences, and was much appreciated by
the lyricist Johnny Mercer, who, with composer Andre Previn, worked on a
stage musical of the story which played in London at Her Majesty's in 1974.
THE GOOD COMPANIONS was previously filmed by Gaumont in 1932 with Jessie
Matthews and John Gielgud. Apparently, a remake was planned in 1953 with
ABPC contract stars husband and wife team Michael Denison and Dulcie Gray,
together with a young and little known actress/dancer named Audrey Hepburn
to be cast as Susie Dean. Then Hollywood became interested in Audrey, and
Paramount brought her out of her contract with ABPC so she could star in
ROMAN HOLIDAY, and the rest, as we know is history. ABPC then shelved the
project, and released the others from their contracts. Three years later,
they decided to revive the project, brought in new writers to polish the
script, and decided to turn it into a CinemaScope musical, with newly
commissioned songs from Paddy Roberts and others. They brought in a new
cast, mainly composed of young contract talent, which is how Janette Scott,
John Fraser and Rachel Roberts became involved.</P>
<P>The 1957 version of THE GOOD COMPANIONS had been out of circulation for many
years - it was last shown on British television in the monochrome days of
1964. One had assumed that the colours had faded and that the film was
beyond repair. What a joy therefore to see the new print which was first
broadcast on Channel Four(UK) in 1997. In the restored print the CinemaScope
image is simply wonderful with all colours looking bright and sharp, and TGC
is now revealed as one of the most attractive and elegant British films of
its decade. The lighting of interiors is exceptional - rooms and decor are
beautifully depicted: Jess Oakroyd's living room, public houses, a private
dining room at the back of a seedy cafe which takes on a warmth all of its
own because of the theatricals seated round the table, theatre interiors,
and there is a scene in a lavish hotel dining room with Joyce Grenfell (Lady
Parlitt) in which the surroundings are rich in detail. Special praise should
go to the director of photography (Gilbert Taylor).</P>
<P>As the setting of the story is updated from 1929 (when touring shows were
highly popular) to the 1950's, when they were in decline, the musical style
is also updated, and the songs are all catchy in the style of
ballads/revue/variety c1956/7. This perhaps explains why the film was not a
big commercial hit in 1957, in spite of an Easter release date- it had the
misfortune to open just as rock and roll was taking off as the music for the
young, and even to the teenagers of 1957 (the target audience defined in the
film's press book), it must have seemed terribly old fashioned, looking to
the past rather the present. It also had the misfortune to be released in
the UK (it was never released theatrically in the USA- not the kind of film
Allied Artists, the distributor of Associated British films in the USA was
interested in- it had no 'exploitation' angle) in the same month as the Fred
Astaire/ Audrey Hepburn FUNNY FACE, one of the all time classics of the
musical genre, and critics were tempted to make comparisons with the British
musical effort. In hindsight however, this is unfair to THE GOOD COMPANIONS,
and with the passing of time the qualities of the film are more evident. For
TGC is priceless as a 1950's British film musical which owes nothing to
operetta or rock and roll - in its recording and celebration of fifties
variety it is unique, bearing in mind that all television variety at the
time went out live. In the UK little was filmed and videotape was still
several years away. The decline of this form of entertainment is disguised
by the triumphant finale, although earlier passing reference is made to the
'three graces' appearing 'stripped to the buff', as in the 1950's touring
nude revues. Interestingly, at the same time as THE GOOD COMPANIONS was
released, 1957, John Osborne's Play THE ENTERTAINER, with Laurence Olivier
as Archie Rice, was premiered at London's Royal Court Theatre (and later
filmed in 1960), and it provides a fascinating counterpoint to the essential
optimism of TGC. What a fascinating double bill these two films would make!
(An interesting foonote: the main location of the film of THE ENTERTAINER is
the Lancashire seaside town of Morecambe, where Janette Scott spent her
early years. Her grandfather was manager of the theatre used in THE
ENTERTAINER, and this was the theatre where her mother, the actress Thora
Hird (who incidentally appears in both films) made her stage debut).</P>
<P>THE GOOD COMPANIONS, although greatly condensed, remains faithful to the
essential spirit of Priestley's novel in its celebration of showbusiness and
the theatrical life, and in particular, the metaphor of the touring theatre
as an escape for the middle aged male from a society that is domesticated,
drab and puritanical, epitomised in those apron wearing, dour wives (played
by Thora Hird and Beatrice Varley in TGC) who appear at the stage door and
attempt to drag their 'erring' husbands away from the chorus girls, and back
to a 'reality'. Then there is the sense of community amongst the performers,
and of communal travel by steam hauled trains through the length of Great
Britain from Wales to Yorkshire, to Bournemouth and on to London. This
romantic vision is captured in a beautifully realised montage sequence which
commences with a distant shot of a train crossing a viaduct, goes to the
train (which looks like a toy train, but isn't) chugging through a verdant
green mountain valley, which fades into a travelling shot of the view from a
carriage window of a harsh industrial landscape, a steel works, which then
cuts directly to the nets of a theatre stage and the performance of a ballad
'If Only' by Susie Dean (Janette Scott). The sequence is linked by the title
song on the soundtrack, and the whole effect is strangely moving, perhaps
something to do with the power of the entertainer to transform our
perception of the world around us, and brighten our lives.</P>
<P>Practically all the minor roles in THE GOOD COMPANIONS are played by
performers who subsequently became much more famous, so the film is full of
incidental pleasures. Because so many of these artists were also appearing
in West End shows in the 1950's, the film provides us with an invaluable
snapshot of certain performers at a specific stage of their careers. Some
were just beginning and had appeared in West End productions of the period:
others were vetrans whose career in musical comedy goes back to the 1930's
and earlier. In the latter category was Bobby Howes, who appeared in
numerous shows from 1923 onwards, the most well known being
Mr.Cinders(1929). In the 1950's he appeared in Paint Your Wagon(Her
Majesty's 1953) and in the NY revival of Finian's Rainbow with Jeannie
Carson (46th St. Theatre 1960). Joyce Grenfell, a West End revue artist
since 1939, appeared in the 1950's revue Joyce Grenfell Requests the
Pleasure of your Company (Fortune Theatre 1954 and for one month in NY in
1955). Paddy Stone and Irving Davies had both appeared in Annie Get Your Gun
(London Coliseum 1947), in which the latter performed the duet 'Who do you
Love, I hope?' with Wendy Toye: both Stone and Davies had also appeared in
the aforementioned Joyce Grenfell revue in 1954, in which Irving Davies
performed a duet with Joyce ('Ordinary Morning'). They also both appeared
with Jeanie Carson in a song and dance number ('In Again/Out Again Heart')
in the 1955 film AS LONG AS THEY'RE HAPPY (which was also directed by J. Lee
Thompson, and featured Janette Scott). Regrettably THE GOOD COMPANIONS was
Paddy Stone's only major featured film appearance. Apart from his brilliant
solo chair number ('Where there's You'), he also choreographed all the
numbers, with Irving Davies, and is responsible for much of the film's
energy. Along with Davies, in the 1960's he became resident choreographer
for Lord Lew Grade's Associated Television variety shows (featuring
Millicent Martin, Librace, Englebert Humperdinck, Tom Jones and many others,
and his most recent screen credit was as choreographer for the 1982 movie of
VICTOR,VICTORIA. John Fraser was later to appear in Strike a Light
(Piccadilly,London 1966) with Jeanie Carson and Evelyn Laye. He is probably
best remembered for his portrayal of Lord Alfred Douglas to Peter Finch's
Oscar Wilde in THE TRIALS OF OSCAR WILDE (US:THE MAN WITH THE GREEN
CARNATION)(1960), and is an amiable romantic lead - there is a charming
little scene where Inigo and Susie take a ride on the top deck of a tram in
a Midlands town (actually filmed in London). John LeMesurier appeared in
Twenty Minutes South ((Greenwell(m) /Browning(l)) at the Players Theatre in
1955. Anthony Newley had appeared in Cranks (Addison(m)/Cranko(l)) in London
New Watergate Theatre 1955) and NY (1956). Rachel Roberts had appeared in
the revue At the Lyric (Lyric, Hammersmith London 1953). As no recordings of
this exist, her featured spot in THE GOOD COMPANIONS ('The Gentleman is a
Heel' number) provides a good indication of the style she must have brought
to revue. Soon after TGC she appeared in the musical Oh! My Papa! (Garrick,
London 1957), and was later to appear in Lionel Bart's Maggie May (Adelphi
1964). So in TGC we can see the star of such classic British 'realist' films
as SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY MORNING and THIS SPORTING LIFE as a song and
dance lady! Incidentally, her co-star in the former film, Shirley Anne
Field, appears briefly in TGC as the brunette of the 'three graces', and
looks as pretty as a picture as a gold trilby hatted chorine. The
distinguished actor Alec McCowen (who incidentally plays Professor Henry
Higgins in the 1997 CD recording of the complete My Fair Lady score (TER
records)), appears in an early scene as Albert, Jess Oakroyd's son. I will
leave you to spot the rest of the familiar faces! Scenes are charmingly
played by the two romantic leads, Janette Scott (Susie Dean) and the
aforementioned John Fraser (Inigo Jolliphant), an archetypical 1950's 'nice
couple',although Susie's calculating sense of ambition at moments threatens
this spirit of niceness and prevents Susie from being too cloying.</P>
<P>TGC is not an integrated musical - the songs (with composition shared
between Paddy Roberts(m/l), C. Alberto Rossi(m/l), and Geoffrey Parsons(l)
do not further character or plot, and the lyrics are not related to the
story, except in a most tenuous way. All musical numbers are performed
either on the theatre stage or in rehearsal. Nevertheless, they are staged
with a professionalism that is rare in a fifties British musical film.
Although imitative of Hollywood models, staging and colour design show some
flair - for example the finale ('Round the World'), in the use of orange and
red in the casbah scene and cool blue for 'Flo's Ice Club'. The lavish
orchestral arrangements were provided by Laurie Johnson, later to compose
the music for many films and television shows (ie THE AVENGERS), as well as
the music for Lock up your Daughters (Mermaid Theatre London. 1959). The
large ABPC studio orchestra was conducted by distinguished vetran conductor
LOUIS LEVY, whose film credits go back to the 1930's, and fondly remembered
for his work with the Gaumont British Symphony Orchestra. Eighteen year old
Janette Scott (placed under contract by Associated British as a child
actress, and groomed for stardom as a teenager throughout the 1950's, and
once, according to David Frost (in volume one of his autobiography) in the
running for the lead in My Fair Lady on Broadway in 1956) does not receive
top billing, but clearly emerges as the star of THE GOOD COMPANIONS, and
remains a potent icon of a past age of innocent screen romance. She displays
great spirit and loads of charm, especially in 'Today will be a Lovely Day'
in which she appears with Paddy Stone and Irving Davies as her two partners
in a very slick routine, which starts with a gamine Jan liltingly responding
to her suitors' invitation 'Whatya doin' Tonight?' - her enthusiasm is also
quite infectious in the skilfully staged finale, when accompanied by a large
troupe of dancers, she is joyously swept across the Elstree soundstage on a
luggage trolley, and lifted into flight to exotic climes across the
CinemaScope screen. Her youthful joie de vivre led one English critic, Peter
Baker of 'Films and Filming' to write (April 1957) that he sees in Janette
Scott 'that vivacity and unaffected warmth which marked the young Judy
Garland in THE WIZARD OF OZ, BABES IN ARMS and LITTLE NELLY KELLY'.
Reviewing the premiere at the Warner Cinema in London's Leicester Square,
Variety's correspondent writes more modestly that 'Miss Scott makes a
refreshing and appealing showing as the concert party star with ambitions'.
At the conclusion of the 'Round the World' number, the pampered, overweight
cigar smoking critic, sitting in his private box with his blonde 'secretary'
comments directly to camera (ie to the cinema audience ):'It is my job to
extinguish lights, but tonight I've seen a little light that one day may
become a star', and we, the spectator, are invited to collude with this.
However, this was the last musical film made by Janette Scott, and ABPC's
next musical project was THE YOUNG ONES(1960), a much bigger commercial
success which incorporated rock and roll (amongst the more traditional
musical numbers by Peter Myers and Ronnie Cass) in the form of Cliff Richard
and the Shadows. The type of musical represented by TGC was no longer a box
office attraction. Janette made many later films of course, including the
classic SCHOOL FOR SCOUNDRELS and several sci -fi films (such as THE DAY OF
THE TRIFFIDS), but none of the later films have the spontaneous innocence of
THE GOOD COMPANIONS, which is uniquely a film of its time. Janette Scott
retired from feature films after her marriage (1966 to 1977) to Mel Torme.</P>
<P>I would also single out for praise Eric Portman, who is perfect in the role
of Jess Oakroyd, and brings richness and depth to the role. There is a
wonderful moment at the end of TGC, when after Susie Dean's triumph, he nods
leans forward and glances towards Miss Trant, who is sitting in the same row
of the theatre stalls, and almost telepathically communicates with her to
share Susie's moment of triumph with a thumbs up sign followed by the
removal of a handkerchief from his top pocket in order to dry his eyes. THE
GOOD COMPANIONS has several moments like this (those looks that Jess Oakroyd
(in the wings operating some piece of equipment) gives to Susie as she is
performing, speak volumes. TGC is strong in rich character acting in a very
English tradition (even a theatre manager has an individuality about him,
even though he appears only briefly with one line of dialogue). It is also
to the credit of the direction and the writing, that with such a large cast
the characters are so clearly defined and the narrative remains focused. It
is these qualities, together with the film's excellent production values and
the charm of the performances make the film such good entertainment.</P>
<P>Back in April 1957, I saw THE GOOD COMPANIONS as an Easter treat at my local
ABC cinema when it was first released. I was nine at the time and the film
made a deep impression on me. Seeing it again for only the second time forty
years later in 1997, I was amazed to find how much I could remember from the
first viewing. A film must have something rather special to remain in one's
memory so clearly for so long. I cannot think of any other British film of
the 1950's that evokes so vividly a sense of time and place - of steam
trains, rides on trolleybuses, tea rooms, provincial theatres and touring
variety - it is all there in colour and CinemaScope, and thankfully, has
been preserved.</P>
