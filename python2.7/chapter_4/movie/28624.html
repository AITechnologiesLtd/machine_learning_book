_Lara_Croft:_Tomb_Raider_ (PG-13) * 1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        On paper, it looked like Hollywood finally figured out how to
make a live action film out of a video game.   A hot Oscar-winning star
(Angelina Jolie) and a name-brand (if not exactly acclaimed) action
director (Simon West) would join forces to bring to the screen an
interactive character (adventurous archeologist Lara Croft of the `Tomb
Raider' series) with real potential for a life beyond player-controlled
pixels.  Despite the promise for being something more, the much-hyped
_Lara_Croft:_Tomb_Raider_ ends up playing exactly like a video game
committed to film--and, no, that's _not_ a compliment.</P>
<P>        Compliments are due Jolie, who ably fills out Lara's figure in
every way.  Not only does she amazingly resemble her computerized
counterpart and do a spot-on British accent, the role offers her an ideal
vehicle to channel her off-screen `wild child' persona.  While Lara may
be born a `lady' of privilege, she doesn't act the part.  She's less at
home all gussied up in fancy dresses in her large country mansion than
she is sporting form-fitting hotpants and tank tops while facing various
dangers in booby-trapped (no pun intended) caves.  Jolie clearly enjoys
the character and shows great potential as a badass action star.  But
there's nothing to the Lara character beyond Jolie and the ready-made
personality she brings to the part.  Even Lara's key vulnerability--her
desire to see her long-dead father again--is intrinsically tied to Jolie:
Lord Croft is played by none other than Jon Voight, Jolie's own father.</P>
<P>        So the movie Lara is not much different from the empty digital
shell that stars in the video game, and the film's basic plot (by West,
five other credited hands, and who knows how many others) reads like the
outline for a game scenario.  Lara has to prevent the evil Illuminati
from rejoining the two halves of a legendary triangular idol that grants
its possessor the ability to control time.  Of course, the way to stop
them is to collect the pieces herself first, so we get a series of
glorified video game stages masquerading as action sequences.  Lara's
mansion is invaded, and she has to dispose of the bad guys while tied to
bungee cords.  In the central sequence set in a cave in Cambodia, Lara
must complete a number of tasks to collect the elusive first piece: turn
a key, swing on a log to reach an urn, do away with all the warrior
statues that come to life with the piercing of the urn, then battle the
cave's biggest statue, which must be defeated in order to advance to the
next level--er, scene.</P>
<P>        The mechanical feel of _Lara_Croft:_Tomb_Raider_ would have been
easier to swallow if the filler between action scenes were the slightest
bit tolerable.  Whenever the mayhem dies down, the film commits a bigger
crime than being boring--it tries to be funny.  Not a single would-be
comic touch elicits so much as a grin: not the one-note `eccentric' side
characters like Lara's stuffy butler (Christopher Barrie) or her nerdy
gadget designer (Noah Taylor); not feeble culture-clash scenes such as
Lara asking a monk if he knows where to find a phone.  (The only time the
audience laughed was when it was tricked into thinking they were going to
be treated to a second gratuitous Lara shower scene late in the film;
alas, the camera panned down from the shower head to reveal the face of
her rival archeologist Alex, played by Daniel Craig.)</P>
<P>        It's interesting to note that the only thrills to be found in the
PG-13 _Lara_Croft:_Tomb_Raider_ are of the prurient kind: the previously
alluded-to Lara shower scene, which bares a bit more skin than expected;
and a slo-mo Lara running scene that's downright _Baywatch_-worthy. 
Nearly $100 million was spent to make things blow up and fill the screen
with loads of fancy special effects, but all anyone talked about at
length when walking out of _Lara_Croft:_Tomb_Raider_ is something anyone
can figure out after shelling out a couple of bucks on a video rental of
_Gia_ (which offers real dramatic substance in addition to ample nudity):
Angelina Jolie is one hot babe.</P>
