<PRE>                               RADIOLAND MURDERS
                       A film review by Kevin Kibelstis
                        Copyright 1994 Kevin Kibelstis</PRE>
<P>Rated:  PG
Running Time:  112 minutes
Starring: Brian Benben, Mary Stuart Masterson, Corbin Bernsen,
          Michael McKean and several other familiar faces.</P>
<P>     I don't know what movie the critics saw, but it wasn't this one.
The popular consensus among newspaper critics was that this movie is
unfunny and dreadfully boring.  In my personal opinion, they couldn't
be more wrong.  If you were expecting AIRPLANE!-like laughs and Agatha
Christie-intense mystery, then yes, this movie would be a
disappointment.  However, If you're just looking for an enjoyable movie
and a good time, this is one to see.  Honest, it is.</P>
<P>     This story is about a 4th network, WBN, taking to America's
airwaves in 1939.  Penny Henderson (Mary Stuart Masterson), the station
owner's secretary, must deal with her overbearing boss, an unimpressed
sponsor and writers ready to quite on a moment's notice, partly due to
the fact that they haven't been paid in weeks.  Among the mayhem, she
must also deal with her soon-to-be ex-husband, Roger (Brian Benben) who
desperately wants her back.  Unfortunately, her problems only get worse
as the night goes on and the body count rises without explanation.</P>
<P>     While trying to woo Penny back, Roger must deal with the police
and try to find the killer that lurks at WBN.</P>
<P>     Mary Stuart Masterson does well in her role as Penny (I'm trying
to be unbiased so I won't tell you how amazing she looked), although
Brian Benben gets most of the screen time.  Along with the two leads,
are several recognizable faces, including Corbin Bernsen (L.A. Law),
Michael McKean (Laverne & Shirley) and Bobcat Goldthwait.</P>
<P>     The special effects are amazing, and fooled me (which some may
argue isn't very difficult to do) in many scenes.  Although the movie
sometimes goes overboard with the physical comedy, it more than makes
up for those mistakes throughout the movie.</P>
<PRE>     Overall, I gave it 3 stars out of four, or an 8.1 out of ten,
depending on what system you use.</PRE>
<P>    Some comments collected from friends:</P>
<PRE>        "It was more riveting than ... God"
        "I feel like seeing RADIOLAND MURDERS again"
        "Damn Good Movie" "Happy - Fun - Neat-o"</PRE>
