<PRE>                                     TRUE LIES
                       A film review by James J. Dibenedetto
                        Copyright 1994 James J. Dibenedetto</PRE>
<P>     First thing--it's a comic book put to live-action film.  A $100
million (or more, depending on the source) live-action comic book.
It's not realistic in the least, and it's not ashamed.  If you're the
type of person who says "But there were 10 bad guys shooting at the
hero!  How could they all miss him?", you're probably not going to
enjoy "True Lies".  But if you can suspend your disbelief for 2 hours
and 20 minutes, you're in for one hell of a ride.</P>
<P>     The plot is pretty simple: Arnold Schwarzenegger is a spy (working
for some really-ultra-secret outfit called "Omega Sector", powerful
enough that field agent Arnold can get directly connected to the White
House in a crisis), whose job is to hunt down terrorists.  Trouble is,
he's never told his wife (Jamie Lee Curtis), instead telling her that
he's a computer salesman.  The story gets moving as two apparently
unrelated plots develop.  In one, Arn, along with partner Tom Arnold,
are on the trail of a radical terrorist group that might have nuclear
weapons.  This involves infiltrating a high-class party in Switzerland,
and a horse-and- motorcycle chase through Washington, D.C., among other
stunts.  The second plot is more mundane:  Arn thinks his wife is
cheating on him.  Arn decides to find out for sure, using all the
resources at his disposal (wiretaps, bugs in his wife's purse, etc.) to
do so.  And then ... well, things get complicated, finally resulting in a
truly stunning sequence involving helicopters, Harrier jets and people
dangling from a crane hundreds of feet in the air.</P>
<P>     All in all, it's great fun.  The stunts are truly amazing--the
Harrier sequence in particular.  You can see every penny of the $100
million budget on the screen.  And the acting?  Big Arnie is good--he's
mastered these kind of roles--taking himself and the film just
seriously enough not to make it a farce, but no more.  And Tom Arnold,
as the wisecracking sidekick, is surprisingly good.  Jamie Lee Curtis
turns in a fine performance, especially when her character gets
something to do.</P>
<P>     To sum it up, I highly recommend this film.  Just don't think
about it too deeply.</P>
