<P>The Thin Red Line is a spectacular movie, intelligently written and
directed by supergenius Terrence Malick, and don't let anyone tell you
different.  Like no other film, it shows the passionate futility of war,
the dark side of mankind, and the stark, underappreciated beauty of
elephant grass.  Brilliantly acted, with haunting, eloquent voiceovers
supplementing the gritty, realistic pace, The Thin Red Line is a courageous
movie which will be studied by generations of film students.  Only an
ingrate, a person with no appreciation for truly great cinema, could ever
say bad things about this instant classic.  If a critic comes along who
doesn't like this movie, who doesn't appreciate its preeminent place in
film history, he should be forced to leave the country and eat taro root in
Guadalcanal until he regains his senses.</P>
<P>Or so the fans of this movie say.  Me, I'm packing my bags and wondering if
Tabasco makes taro root taste any better.  The Thin Red Line is
overserious, overlong, and over my head.  It is ostensibly the story of a
WWII infantry company fighting for control of Guadalcanal, but don't be
fooled into thinking that this is Saving Private Ryan in the Pacific
Theater.  The Thin Red Line is overlaid with symbolism and philosophy to
the point that it makes Platoon look like The Green Berets.  In this movie,
Higher Truths fly past faster than bullets.</P>
<P>This is not to say that I did not take any Higher Truths away from The Thin
Red Line.  I did.  Out of all the high-flown sentiment, all the stunning
visual jungle imagery, all the scenes of heroism, courage, and sudden
violent death, I left The Thin Red Line with one truth:  Don't take small
children to movies that have explosions in them.</P>
<P>Ha-ha!  And I could go on, poking cruel and heartless fun at Terrence
Malick and The Thin Red Line for the next three hours (or until some nice
person from the Miami Herald taps me on the shoulder and mentions that Dave
Barry is sick this week, and can I have a column ready by 5 this
afternoon?).  But it would be incredibly rude and mean-spirited of me to do
so.  (Although, come to think of it, that hasn't stopped me so far.)  The
Thin Red Line is a great movie whether I like it or not.  (So is Saving
Private Ryan, for that matter.)  It is a matter of taste, that's all, and
if my taste isn't broad enough to encompass this boring, pretentious,
pointless clunker of a movie, so be it.</P>
<P>Before going to see The Thin Red Line, you need to understand that it is
actually three one-hour movies all spliced together.  If you like at least
any two of them, you're going to enjoy the movie.  If you only like one of
them, however, you're in for a long stretch over some rough road.</P>
<P>The first movie is the one I liked best, and the one I was expecting.  It
is the War Epic, complete with all-star cast and on-location filming.  I
love war epics.  I love all the great epic WWII movies like The Longest Day
and The Great Escape and Bridge on the River Kwai and all of the others.
And this third of the movie is spectacular.  It has Woody Harrelson leading
his team in a desperate assault on a Japanese-held hill, only to make a
tragic error.  It has Nick Nolte in the John Wayne part, pushing the
company up that hill by force of pure will -- along with Elias Koteas as
the decent infantry captain who opposes him, not wanting to throw away the
lives of his troops.  And it has a lot of good, young actors playing in
minor roles, building their resumes.</P>
<P>There are two great scenes in The Thin Red Line that help put all of these
movies to shame.  There's a scene where an infantry squad (led by John
Cusack, of all people) has to take out a Japanese machine gun battery on
top of a hill.  The company has inched painfully up this gorgeous hill
covered in leafy elephant grass for a good chunk of the movie, but has
suffered a lot of casualties from the unseen machine gun nests ahead.  The
scene where Cusack's team charges up the hill and takes the nest is a
great, courageous, almost wordless piece of filmmaking.  You understand
exactly what's going on and where the armies are situated and the sheer
guts it would take for anyone to trot over to a machine gun emplacement and
lob in a grenade.  There's another great scene at the two hour mark where
the company overruns a Japanese barracks and hospital.  It is a scene of
terror and desperation, almost as good as Spielberg's D-Day landing, and
much more fast-paced.  Malick does an outstanding job in conveying the
chaos and fear that both sides must have experienced...  but it's the last
good scene in the movie, which still has an hour to run.</P>
<P>The second movie is, of all things, a nature documentary.  There are scenes
-- dozens of them -- that look for all the world like they were snipped
from a National Geographic special on Guadalcanal.  If you have cable, and
want to get an idea about what The Thin Red Line is all about, click back
and forth between The History Channel and The Discovery Channel and you'll
have some idea.  The movie's opening scene is an alligator sliding, slowly,
into a filthy pond.  And it looks great, from a purely visual perspective,
but a whole hour of such images gets to be a bit oppressive.  And it really
doesn't help matters that Malick is so good at his craft.  There's a shot
of some bats at one point, and I will concede that it may be the best, most
poetic, most lovingly crafted film rendition of bats ever made.  But --
ingrate that I am -- if I want to see bats, I can find better ways to
manage it than paying to see The Thin Red Line again.</P>
<P>The third movie stitches the other two together.  It is, at least partly, a
debate about philosophy -- how the beauty of Rousseau's "state of nature"
is destroyed and tarnished by a nasty and brutish Hobbsean war.  Whatever.
It is told largely by director Malick in a series of moody, pointless
voiceovers.  It is as though Malick is one of the angels in long black
leather coats from City of Angels, drifting around Guadalcanal the way that
Nicolas Cage drifted around Los Angeles, hearing the thoughts of the dying
and of brave men, hearing the ineffable music in the sunset.  What was
magical in City of Angels is, well, wretched in A Thin Red Line.  (Or vice
versa.  Like I said, it's a matter of taste.)  The voiceovers are overlong,
incomprehensible ramblings about life, death, nature, eternity, and some
blonde chick back home.  This all may be deeply profound, inspired
thinking, but I thought it was boring as hell.</P>
<P>A Thin Red Line is almost exactly like the Olympics, in one way.  You have
a great, exciting contest between men and teams of men, with national honor
at stake.  But every so often, when you're not paying attention, the
coverage switches to gymnastics or figure skating or women's volleyball or
some such other event.  It's not so much that the other events are bad or
evil or something worse than the complete waste of time that they are.
It's that every minute they're on the screen is another minute we're not
watching basketball or hockey or the decathlon.  And in The Thin Red Line,
every minute we spend listening to the deep inner thoughts of howler
monkeys or what have you is a minute that can't be used to show the Battle
of Guadalcanal, which is what we came to see.</P>
<P>In grading The Thin Red Line, I give the battle scenes an A, and the rest
of the movie an F.  That averages out to a C in my book, although I'm
confident that my mean-spirited rant will not detract from the greatness of
this movie.  If anyone needs me, I'll be watching a hockey game.  And
eating taro root.</P>
