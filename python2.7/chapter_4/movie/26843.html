<P>   I missed the critics' screening of "Men of Honor" and
caught up with the picture not in a sophisticated Manhattan
neighborhood but in a Brooklyn community filled with people
who are politically and social conservative.  As their voting
record over the past few decades indicates, they are strongly
family-minded, traditional, and at the Sunday screening I
attended mostly over 55 years of age.  The seats were filled.
Why did "Men of Honor" attract the largest audience of the
multiplex theater rather than "Charlie's Angels" or "Little
Nicky" or "The 6th Day"?  Because the other three films are
targeted to the young?  That's partly the reason.  But I'd
suggest another purely on speculation.  These are people
who are dismayed by the plethora of violent and sexually
explicit movies but even more, they are opposed to the
rampant cynicism projected on today's screens. They look
forward to movies that might urge them--were they just a little
less inhibited--to stand up at the end and recite the pledge of
allegiance or even sing the national anthem.  "The
Contender" would be a similar sort were the hero not a pro-
choice, atheist vegetarian who likes sex, because absent
those traits, who could resist the rousing call of President
Jackson Evans to a joint session of Congress to accept his
nomination of Laine Hanson to the post of vice president?</P>
<P>   "Men of Honor" shares the all-American thrills of "The
Contender" while celebrating an African-American man whose
political views are unknown but whose determination to
contribute mightily to his country is liberty-bell clear.  His life
could have been the subject of a dull, talking-heads biopic but
director George Tillman Jr. does a bracing job of bringing this
true American hero to life with all the force that a stirring
sound track (by Mark Isham) and lines-are-drawn acting
could bring.  If the music obtrusively punctuates what is
apparent in the struggle of Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding Jr.)
to overcome racial prejudice in the post World War II Navy
(as scripted by Scott Marshall Smith), Tillman means well.  If
the obligatory courtroom finale is as schematic and schmaltzy
as the conclusion of Rod Lurie "The Contender," all the better
to appeal to a crowd less influenced by modern critical
standards to condemn the mawkish.  "Men of Honor" may be
square, but in recent years we've had all the hip we need in
the movie theaters.</P>
<P>   Filmed by Anthony B. Richmond with some tense, authentic
underwater photography, "Men of Honor" focuses on the 
struggle between Carl Brashear, who became the Navy's first
African-American diver, and a crew of people headed by
Master Chief Diver Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro).  Pushed by
his sharecropper father to be all he can be, Brashear enters
the all-white Naval diving program.  Despite his seventh-
grade education, he struggles through the initial written tests,
fails one, and passes the second with a reasonable grade. 
The real test comes for Brashear when he must deal with the
refusal of the entire crew save the stuttering Snowhill
(Michael Rapaport) to bunk with him.  (All but Snowhill walk
out...so where did they get to bunk anyway?) While Sunday is
determined to flunk the man, pushed to do so by his racist
commanding officer Mr. Pappy (Hal Holbrook), as he puffs
away on his corncob pipe--a gift from General MacArthur--he
slowly grows to appreciate Brashear's enormous motivation. 
This impetus to become a diver and even rise to the top of
his profession is made most dramatic by what Brashear does
to himself in the hospital while recovering from an accident.</P>
<P>   Since Carl Brashear was a real, live person who--as the
audience knew beforehand actually fought and won the good
fight depicted here-- we in the audience knew from the start
that this was a man that Billy Sunday could not shut down. 
Despite this, Tillman's characterizations bring out the humor
as well as the poignancy, making the journey to victory the
cause for celebration.</P>
