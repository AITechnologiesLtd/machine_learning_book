        The problem with most long running horror series is that they
inevitably have a habit of outstaying their welcome.  Friday The 13th,
Halloween, and Nightmare On Elm Street, etc, quickly deteriorated once
they started producing increasingly ludicrous sequels that moved
further and further away from the original in both flavour and intent.
On the other hand, true movie trilogies seem to fare better.  Star
Wars, the Indiana Jones and Jack Ryan series, and, to a lesser extent,
The Godfather saga maintained the integrity and standards of the
original.
        Similarly, Scream 3, the third instalment in this popular
horror series that revitalised the teen slasher genre, sticks to its
established formula.  Despite the familiarity of the plotting and a
singular lack of originality, though, Scream 3 will not disappoint
fans.
        Scream 3 is set in Hollywood, where a studio, fascinated by
the gruesome Woodsboro slayings, is filming Stab 3, a sequel that
continues the film-within-a-film that opened Scream 2.  But this
triggers off a new killing spree in which the familiar masked psycho
begins killing off the cast in the order that their characters die in
the movie.  The recent low budget Australian teen slasher film Cut
shares a few superficial similarities and may have stolen some of its
thunder, but Scream 3 is still a vastly superior film.
        The brutal murders reunite tenacious reporter Gale Weathers
(Courtney Cox Arquette) and Dewie Riley (David Arquette), who is
working as a technical advisor on the movie.  The key to the killings
again seems to be feisty Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), who has
disappeared into seclusion and now works as a telephone counsellor
from the anonymity of her safe house.  In probing the new series of
murders, the three raise disturbing questions about the past and the
real identity of the Woodsboro killer, long thought to have been
killed.
        While the regular stars merely go through the motions, Scream
3 introduces us to some new protagonists, who become victims or
suspects.  Mark Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey) is a handsome, film literate
homicide detective, the perfect man to help investigate a series of
murders surrounding a movie set, or so one would assume.  And indie
queen Parker Posey is an absolute delight as Jennifer Jolie, the
actress portraying Gale on screen, who throws herself into the role of
playing real life investigative reporter with annoying gusto.
        Scream 3 has not suffered greatly with the departure of
original writer Kevin Williamson, as it manages to retain much of the
same flavour.  The film supposedly plays around with the conventions
of film sequels, and also adds a new dimension to the
film-within-a-film concept.  Scream 3 also manages to generate some
suspense as to which of our three heroes may not survive.  However,
the writing is not as sharp and there is a greater emphasis on gore
here.  Scream 3 also abounds with clever red herrings and artful
misdirection, as well as some spectacular and bloody deaths.
        Ehren Kruger (who wrote the superb paranoid conspiracy
thriller Arlington Road) ups the body count, but still manages to
punctuate the grisly slayings with lashings of humour, dubious film
lore and heaps of sly in-jokes.  Cameo appearances by famed '60's
director and producer Roger Corman, Silent Bob and Jay (aka Kevin
Smith and Jason Mewes) and Carrie Fisher add to the irreverent flavour
of the whole thing.
        Veteran director Wes Craven knows the rhythms and pacing of
the horror genre, and he directs this familiar material with
assurance, deftly punctuating the gore with judiciously timed shocks
and laughs.  Hopefully, though, Craven et al will now quit the Scream
series while they are still ahead.</P>
