<P>Nutshell: Summer has begun; mindless destruction and virtually no

-----</PRE>
<P>Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich, the two industry-smart coordinators
behind "Stargate" (1994) and "Independence Day" (1996), have taken
their special-effects approach to filmmaking a step further with
"Godzilla," a film that has plenty of computer-generated
monster-induced destruction but next to zero in terms of a story.</P>
<P>Quite frankly, I wasn't really expecting much in terms of a story.
>From the word go, "Godzilla" was very obviously intended as the first
mindless summer blockbuster of 1998. It promised a simple, streamlined
story, lots of mayhem and destruction (a la "Independence Day" two
years ago), and all the elaborate special-effects sequences a
filmmaker can conjure with a $120 million budget.</P>
<P>But somewhere along the line, Devlin and Emmerich forgot that we still
need to feel *something* as the movie progresses. We need to care how
the events of the story will unfold. At the very least, we need to
feel viscerally involved as New York City becomes a stomping ground
for a 300-foot lizard.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, aside from a few isolated moments, "Godzilla" fails to
generate those feelings of awe. I didn't care about any of the
characters, I didn't care about the possible downfall of New York City
or "the entire world itself"--and I didn't really even care about the
lizard.</P>
<P>What we have here--a summer tradition invented once it became clear to
producers and directors that computer-generated effects could bring a
new sense of realism to the realm of natural (or unnatural) disaster
action--is yet another "special-effects movie." Without the special
effects (and a need to have well-known structures like the Chrysler
Building and Madison Square Garden leveled by film's end) there
wouldn't be a point to have the movie at all.</P>
<P>As always, there are good ways to do special-effects movies and bad
ways. "Jurassic Park" back in 1993, with its sense of wonder
concerning uncontrollable possibilities, was one of the groundbreaking
examples of the good way. And "Independence Day," while shallow and
silly, was also entertaining and had plenty of attitude to get by. But
as characterization and even the general sense of intensity get
stripped away, it becomes harder to feel that we're watching a giant
lizard stomping through a major city, and all too obvious that we're
watching millions of dollars and thousands of labor hours for special
effects being projected onto the screen.</P>
<P>The plot to "Godzilla" is a no-brainer. After a few token scenes used
to set up the premise and loosely establish the major characters, the
giant lizard (which, as most already know, is dubbed "Godzilla" and is
a mutated product of nuclear radiation) crawls out of the Atlantic and
begins stomping through the City That Never Sleeps. A biological
expert on mutated organisms (Matthew Broderick), known to most as "the
worm guy" (because he studies worms at Chernobyl, you see) is brought
in by the U.S. military to submit his opinions about the instincts of
the 300-foot lizard. He naturally offers helpful hints to the military
people, such as telling them to remove manhole covers so it can smell
the hundreds of tons of fish that have been placed on the street to
bait it. "What are they doing?" asks the unit's commander when his men
scatter to open manholes. Well, says I, they're *your* men. If you
can't keep up with what they're doing, then we're all probably in a
lot of trouble, aren't we?</P>
<P>There are scenes where helicopters chase Godzilla through the city,
firing thousands of rounds at him to no significant effect. One might
wonder why it takes the military characters so long to figure out that
bullets won't do the trick, except that a higher strategy is in work
here--a strategy set to ensure the movie will last close to 2 1/2
hours and produce a maximum amount of net destruction. At one point,
the mayor (Michael Lerner) complains to the colonel (Kevin Dunn),
saying, "You've destroyed more of the city than he has!" As someone
who is aware that this is a demolition derby rather than a plausible
reaction to a crisis, I suspect that's the whole point.</P>
<P>There are plenty of slow-witted characters at work here. It always
kills me the way officials in charge of situations like this one are
always the most likely to scoff at issues that any rational person
would address with swift action and undivided attention--like, oh, the
fact that Broderick suspects Godzilla is laying eggs that could
produce more Godzillas within only a few hours. Naturally, these
people don't look for this nest of eggs; instead, they kick Broderick
off the team because of a press leak. Talk about priorities.</P>
<P>As with all major disaster movies, there is of course a romantic
theme; in this case it's between Broderick's character and his old
college sweetheart (Maria Pitillo), who is an aspiring journalist
trying to break the "Godzilla story" (undoubtedly the biggest thing to
hit TV airwaves since O.J. Simpson). I was surprised at even how
ineffective and perfunctory this angle of the story was. I expected it
to be cliched, and it was, but I didn't expect it to be quite so
hollow. Pitillo's character comes off as a complete airhead, and the
performance doesn't bring a thing to it. At times the character seemed
worthy of self-parody, but Pitillo plays it hopelessly straight.</P>
<P>It's frustrating that this movie doesn't contain any interesting
characters or personalities. Everyone is a cardboard device used
solely to advance the plot. The most watchable character is probably
the one played by Jean Reno, an enigmatic persona who turns out to be
from an organization that's best summed into a sound bite as "the
French CIA."</P>
<P>I was also pretty amazed at how lacking the film was in original
action. The scenes that take place in Madison Square Garden prove
themselves to be so blatantly ripped off from the velociraptor attacks
in "Jurassic Park" and last year's "The Lost World" that I found
myself realizing how much more class and originality Steven Spielberg
brings to his set pieces.</P>
<P>And you'd think a movie from the makers of "Independence Day" would
have more room for good jokes about a 300-foot lizard. Alas, the humor
is surprisingly lacking here, and, when present, is surprisingly
stale.</P>
<P>The early-teenage level of the movie's pitch is perhaps a forewarning
that everything about the story is just a means to fill time between
lizard attacks: Every emotion is cued by David Arnold's relentlessly
obvious score, the dialog is as simple and succinct as it possibly can
be, and the supporting characters offer their comments only to prompt
the subsequent actions. It's plotting by comic book means.</P>
<P>On the other hand, even if the story completely fails to generate a
believable sense of doom, the effects manage to come off as very
realistic. Devlin and Emmerich and their crews are technical experts
when it comes to filming large-scaled destruction in a way that looks
utterly convincing, and the scenes of Godzilla stomping through the
streets, knocking down buildings and bridges and crushing cars are
extremely well done, and particularly effective in the taut final
fifteen minutes of the film. If you're going to see "Godzilla," see it
only because you want the visual experience of seeing New York City
decimated. There's no other reason to see it--though, deep down, you
probably knew that.</P>
