<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Ron Howard's latest film has the misfortune of following the superior
Oscar-nominated The Truman Show.  The similarities are numerous, and
when the inevitable comparisons are made, EdTV comes up short.  Really
short.</P>
<P>The reason Truman was such a great movie was because Truman was
completely unaware that he was being filmed.  When we saw people tuning
into Truman's life on a regular basis, we thought `Cripes!  This is
really messed up.  This guy's whole life has been a big charade and
these horrible people are using him to entertain themselves.  Media
bad.  Society doomed.'  Andrew Niccol's script was clever, dark and
preyed on mankind's paranoid fear both of being secretly watched and of
being a pawn in an intricate scheme to have the wool pulled over its
collective eyes.</P>
<P>EdTV's script, by Billy Crystal's crap-factory writing team of Lowell
Ganz & Babaloo Mandel, doesn't have that edge.  It features a guy, Ed
Pekurny (Matthew McConaughey, A Time to Kill) that knows he's being
watched by millions of people.  He even had to audition for the part.
So, basically, it's like watching MTV's The Real World except that it
concentrates on one person.  And that it's duller and more predictable.</P>
<P>Like Truman, Ed's real father (Dennis Hopper, Speed) tries to reunite
with his now-famous son.  Like Truman, the shows producers try to veer
Ed away from the plain-Jane girl he really loves (Jenna Elfman, Dharma &
Greg) toward a gorgeous ratings-grabber (Elizabeth Hurley, My Favorite
Martian).  And like Truman, there's even a scene where Ed, arms
outstretched, looks up into the sky as rain beats down on him.  Jeez, I
think I'm going to go rent Truman right now.  (2:02 – PG-13 for adult
language, adult situations and some sexual content)</P>
