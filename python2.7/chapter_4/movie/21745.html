<P>You can probably blame `Friday the 13th' for all the putrid, Grade-Z
slasher film garbage that amassed in the 1980's. It was so popular among
horror movie fans that endless imitations begin spawning quickly
thereafter, drowning the Hollywood market in gore. Among these
imitations were eight `Friday' sequels (you heard right), but most
sucked the big one. People couldn't get enough, apparently, so the
slasher trend continued on throughout the years. I suppose the John
Carpenter classic `Halloween' initially started the horror craze that
lasted a healthy decade, but `Friday the 13th' brought the realization
that a horror movie could be lame and cheesy but still modestly received
by the public. Actually, despite the bad rap it often takes, the
original `Friday the 13th' isn't bad at all.</P>
<P>In fact, in comparison to the awful clones that followed, it may be a
flat-out masterpiece. The premise: a bunch of kids travel to Camp
Crystal Lake, where they are signed up as counselors for the approaching
season. Unfortunately, even before the young campers arrive, some
mysterious killer is knocking off the sex-crazed teens in singular (and
very gory) fashion. Of course, no one realizes they are being ruthlessly
hunted down until the finale, when the sole survivor stumbles upon their
rotting corpses and erupts in screaming. To once again quote Randy Meeks
(Jamie Kennedy), the legendary `Scream' character: `Their bodies will
come popping up in the last reel somewhere. Eyes gouged out, throats
slashed...' Yes siree, Randy knows his sh-t.</P>
<P>Despite being a blatant rip-off of the undeniably superior `Halloween',
this entry manages to generate a fair tally of scares. The mass
murdering takes a while to get underway, bet when it does, there is some
nice tension and a few sufficient shocks. (HEAVY SPOILERS AHEAD, FOR
ANYONE WHO CARES). The best of all comes when a young Kevin Bacon (who
graduated from the experience unscathed) is stabbed through a bed
mattress
with an archery arrow. That's about as inventive as the proceedings get,
but for anyone interested in researching famous horror cinema, `Friday
the 13th' is a fun and frightening little experience.</P>
<P>As anyone who watched `Scream' also knows, Jason Voorhees is not the
actual killer. Get ready for this shocker, boys and girls: it's his
mother!!! Yes, Mr. Voorhees doesn't do laundry or bake chocolate chip
cookies anymore - she murders people to make end's meet. But there is a
motive for these homicidal tendencies. Back in 1958, little Jason
drowned in the lake because his supervising counselors were too busy
with.... other matters. So now, the lady is out to exact revenge at the
place where she lost her beloved son. It's a real tearjerker.</P>
<P>As with the majority of horror films, the characters and dialogue in
`Friday the 13th' are unanimously pathetic. I will say, however, that
those aspects are more interesting than in the following sequels.
Director Sean S. Cunningham establishes a nice chill in the air, and the
elaborate death scenes deliver on a fairly reliable basis. The movie is
still relatively idiotic, though. I paid particular attention to how
efficiently Mrs. Voorhees could swing an axe while her face is off
screen. Funny, when the killer's identity is revealed and Betsy Palmer
steps in as the deranged matriarch, she can barely muscle up enough
strength to pick up a machete (and has even more trouble heaving it
toward the helpless victim). Despite this, along with numerous other
defects, `Friday the 13th' will still give you the jitters when you
watch it late at night.</P>
<P>Horror fanatics will definitely want to look into seeing this puppy,
mainly because it christened the most successful slasher movie franchise
in history. By all means, don't bother with any of the sequels (although
a few have some stylish attributes). Pick up this ancient fright flick
from the cobwebs at your local video store, and pop it into the VCR this
Halloween. The ending is terrible, but `Friday the 13th' is not as
unlucky as the title may suggest.</P>
