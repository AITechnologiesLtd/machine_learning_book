<P>The character Neve Campbell plays in "Scream 3" has been so badly shaken in 
the first two movies that she now lives in Monterey with a reclusive 
anonymous lifestyle. When she finally drives to California to join in with 
the rest of the action, she's quieter, thoughtful and more authoritative. 
Watching this makes us realise what great potential Campbell has for 
performing in serious drama. I kept fantasising about writing a great 
screenplay for her, to showcase her captivating presence and win her 
international acclaim.</P>
<P>It's not just time for Neve to move on, though, but everyone involved. When 
the original "Scream" was released in 1996, it was a stunning comic idea -- a 
film with the structure of a slasher pic in which the characters knew all the 
clichés and had self-referential conversations about them. Unfortunately, the 
idea was copied, and quickly became a cliché in itself. Now almost every 
American movie starring kids under 20 is filled with smug, cynical allusions 
to pop culture that just make us groan and yawn.</P>
<P>Given that its options are limited and it's the third trek over the same 
ground, "Scream 3" does a pretty good job of engaging us. The filmmakers have 
announced that it's the last in the series, and while I'm not about to 
complain, at least their latest work is watchable. It comes up with a pretty 
ingenious way of generating more jokes, in fact, by setting its story in 
Hollywood, and featuring the production of a movie called "Stab 3". A horror 
movie, wouldn't you know it, based on characters from the first two "Scream" 
pictures.</P>
<P>This gives the director, Wes Craven, and his screenwriter, Ehren Kruger, the 
freedom to blur the line between what's going on in the 'reality' of the 
story and the world of movies. The plot involves another mystery about who is 
perpetrating a murderous rampage, and at this point in the trilogy we've been 
introduced to so many characters with so many conflicting personality traits 
that there is indeed a fair amount of suspense about the identity of the 
killer. In the end, Craven and Kruger come up with an unpredictable and 
arbitrary solution, but hey, at least we're not bored, as we were in "Scream 
2". That sequel made a bad mistake in thinking it was a real horror movie, 
and ditching the humour.</P>
<P>"Scream 3" is generally easy to watch, with colourful, sexy visuals, and 
although its form of parody is becoming old hat, there is enough successful 
ironic chatter to get us giggling. As I've suggested, it's better than 
"Scream 2". But somehow it doesn't work well enough to recommend. The idea 
has been stretched too far. They should have made one movie, and called it 
quits.</P>
<P>My biggest concern is that a lot of the violence is excessive for a 
lighthearted flick. Every time a knife is pulled out, for example, there is a 
disgusting metallic 'zing!' on the sound track, and a bright gleam on the 
screen. People get slaughtered in cruel, not amusing, ways. Unnecessary. Sick.</P>
