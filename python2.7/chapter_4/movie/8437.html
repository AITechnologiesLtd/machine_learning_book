<PRE>                            BLOOD AND WINE  (1997)   
                            a review by chris webb    
                                copyright 1997</PRE>
<PRE>        CAST: Jack Nicholson (Alex Gates), Stephen Dorff (Jason Gates),
              Jennifer Lopez (Gabriella), Judy Davis (Suzanne Gates),
              Michael Caine (Victor), Harold Parrineau Jr. (Henry).
              Directed by Bob Rafelson.    </PRE>
<P>        Rage.  Integrity.  Intensity.  Passion.  Disillusionment.  Pain.  
Charm.  Jack Nicholson can incorporate all these contradictions into 
whatever role he plays.  Such is the case in Blood and Wine, his latest 
collaboration with director Bob Rafelson (Five Easy Pieces, King of 
Marvin Gardens).  Over the past few years, we have seen him in the 
two-dimensional role, no matter how compelling, in A Few Good Men, as a 
cartoon in Batman, and as a compassionate and angered man in The Crossing 
Guard.  But nothing can exercise Nicholson's talents as good as when 
he displays absolute paranoia and irrational psychosis as we've seen in 
Five Easy Pieces and Carnal Knowledge, which was a subtle, but calculated 
performance of mental deterioration.</P>
<P>        To watch Nicholson in a frenzy, the gritted teeth, the extended 
facial expressions is to face the devil.  Much as is seen in Blood and 
Wine.  We are presented with Alex Gates (Nicholson), who is 
married to Suzanne (Judy Davis), and step-father to Jason (Stephen 
Dorff).  The verbal abuse begins immediately in the family's first scene, 
and relationships have already been fractured when we enter their lives.  
Jason can do no right in wine merchant Alex's eyes.  He doesn't dress 
right, he doesn't have many friends, and he sticks up for his mother.  
They simply don't like each other, never had, and we must take that at 
face value.</P>
<P>        On top of his wine business, Alex is into some small time jewelry 
heisting.  In his second life, he is close associate to Victor (Michael 
Caine), who is an expert safe-cracker on probation.  Meanwhile, Alex is 
having an affair with Gabrielle (Jennifer Lopez), the nanny for a rich 
Miami family.  Alex has been using her to get at a necklace which could 
bring him in more than a million dollars.</P>
<P>        In a slow-developing format, we begin to see motivations of each 
character.  Jason wants to leave home, and hopes his abused mother leaves 
too.  A loner, Jason's dream is to ride the seas on a fixed-up boat.  He 
wants peace in his life.  Gabrielle loves Alex.  Unfortunately, Alex is 
selfish and relentless in his pursuit for riches.  Despite his business, 
he feels unsuccessful and needs money to live the lavish lifestyle he 
feels he missed out on.</P>
<P>        When Suzanne discovers he has two tickets to New York, she 
refuses to let Alex leave the house.  The Nicholson rage emerges for the 
first time.  In a fight which leaves you sympathizing for both 
characters, both parties are beaten pretty badly.  Suzanne leaves home 
and takes Jason with her.  In the process, they wind up with the jewels.  </P>
<P>        Alex and Victor need the jewels, as this game has suddenly gone 
terribly wrong.  At this time, Jason has also fallen for Gabrielle, who 
leads them both down different paths.  Nicholson has landed in the love 
triangles he has had in his earlier movies.  This leads to more rage as 
he descends deeper into his self-created psychosis.  At one point, he 
does the unforgiveable asking his hurt wife to tell him where the jewels 
out.  That sentence does not give the scene justice, but I don't want to 
ruin the film.</P>
<P>        Caine is superb as a man who has nown only crime his whole life 
and will stop at nothing and hurt anyone who stands in his way.  But 
Rafelson is not content in that.  Doublecrossing abounds on the parts of 
Steven, Victor, Alex, and Gabrielle, and we are led deeper and deeper 
into this tragic tapestry.  All characters at one point in time are the 
bad guy and all become victims.  </P>
<P>        This is one of the best films I've seen this year, hands down.  
It brought back the Nicholson of the past, which is the best Nicholson.  
He wasn't becoming complaicent, I don't think.  These types of roles just 
weren't around.  But, he's returned to form, and Dorff is quite the 
discovery, in this transition from the indie circuit to more mainstream 
fare.  </P>
<P>        Rafelson seems to have Nicholson's number when it comes to 
tapping into his irrational side, and its nice to see them teaming up 
again.  There is no diner scene here likei n Five Easy Pieces, but 
Nicholson can sneer and Rafelson can pull this mesmerizing picture 
together without the need to prove anything to the audience.  They need 
not our approval anymore, they've mastered that.  Now, its time to just 
watch this film, and enjoy Blood and Wine for the thrilling, though 
depressing, drama it is.  This picture is about contradictions, even the 
title suggests one.</P>
<PRE>        I loved this film, no contradicitons here....</PRE>
<PRE>My grade: A </PRE>
