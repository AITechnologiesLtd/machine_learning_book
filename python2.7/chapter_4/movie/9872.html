<P>   The accepted wisdom about one-night stands is that they
are virtually meaningless trysts between people who may or
not be persons of substance.  In the hands of Mike Figgis,
though, the title takes on an ironic sense: the sexual
rendezvous of two attractive human beings has a seismic
impact on their lives and those of the people who love them
by causing two generally superficial beings to re-examine their
existence.  While "One Night Stand" does not share the
quality of Mike Figgis's masterwork, "Leaving Las Vegas," the
picture carries some of his signature pointers.  Like "Vegas,"
this film zeroes in on one character who is in desperate
straits, in this case a man dying of AIDS, while bearing still
another resemblance in highlighting characters who are at the
most dramatic points in their lives.</P>
<P>   Written originally by Joe Eszterhas who had Nicolas Cage
in mind for the key role of Max, "One Night Stand" was
overhauled by Figgis who retains full credit for its writing. 
Opening theatrically as Max (Wesley Snipes) addresses his
audience directly to describe his shallow but busy life, the
movie follows him as he walks down the familiar New York
streets of his childhood, on the way to a meeting with an
actor, Charlie (Robert Downey Jr.), with whom he once
shared a deep friendship.  Max describes himself as an
advertising man, a successful one of about 35 years, who has
a sense of guilt for abandoning his friendship with Charlie.</P>
<P>   When Max misses his flight to L.A. because of traffic
congestion, he meets Karen (Nastassja Kinski), who has
called attention to an ink stain on Max's shirt and later joins
her at a concert.  The two are later mugged, and when Max
fights off the felons, Karen invites him to share her quarters
for the night.  One year later Max, a resident of Los Angeles
who is married to Mimi (Ming-Na Wen), returns to New York
to visit Charlie, now hospitalized with AIDS, and coincidentally
runs into Karen.  What follows seems contrived but features a
dramatic payoff that brings the entire work into sharper focus.</P>
<P>   While "One Night Stand" does not have the edgy acting of
Nicolas Cage and Elizabeth Shue from "Leaving Las Vegas,"
it is performed particularly well by Robert Downey Jr., who
redeems himself from a disastrous role in the indie movie
directed by his dad, "Hugo Pool."  Like Eric Roberts in "It's My
Party," the dying Charlie insists on setting up a party in his
hospital room, his pals regaling him with gifts, laughs, and
good cheer.  While he looks deathly ill, he can elicit surprising
laughs from the audience by the grimaces on his face, the
most enduring being the expression he suggests when he
sees Max locked in a passionate embrace with Karen who, it
turns out, is Charlie's sister-in-law.  In several well-developed
and partly improvised episodes preceding this love-clasp,
Figgis exposes us to the coming breakdown of Max's
marriage to Mimi, who objects strongly to the way Max has
been putting down the shallow people he works with in his ad
agency.  The humor of his job is effectively pointed out at a
meeting in which the serious discussion of the day is how to
get a public to become interested in having their hot dogs with
their sponsor's sauerkraut.  Still another prolonged and very
funny episode finds Mimi suspiciously smelling Max, who had
just returned from his one-night stand in New York, accusing
him of misbehavior--which, she concludes, is proven by the
cigarette smoke she sniffs on his clothing.  Max has been
caught: he has not really given up smoking.</P>
<P>   Figgis knows how to back up the humor and pathos of his
production with the right music, contrasting New York and
L.A. not as Neil Simon did in "California Suite" but by
differentiating the coasts by a jazz track to represent the East
and pop music for the Hollywood set.  Perhaps the most
interesting subtext is the way race has absolutely nothing to
do with the dynamics of the story.  Max is black, his wife
Asian-American, and his lover a dazzling blonde. Rated R.
