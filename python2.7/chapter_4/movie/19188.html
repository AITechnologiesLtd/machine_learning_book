Reviewed July 3, 1999.</P>
<P>Spike Lee has always been an obviously talented director, creating inventive 
storytelling and technical techniques that have been nothing short of 
impressive. 1989's critically-heralded "Do the Right Thing" is still Lee's 
most praised work, but he has also made the successful likes of 1991's 
"Jungle Fever," 1992's "Malcolm X," 1994's "Crooklyn," and 1995's "Clockers." 
One of the downfalls in Lee's films that have been detected, however, is his 
unnecessary emphasis on sex and nudity when it has very little to do with the 
story at hand (for proof, just take a look at his frustratingly uneven 1998 
drama, "He Got Game"), as if his only reason for adding these elements is 
simply because he can. </P>
<P>Spike Lee's latest opus, "Summer of Sam," marks a major turning point in his 
career because, with this picture, he has swayed away from his usual 
African-American characters to focus on a group of white Italian Americans, 
which was a vital decision in his evolution as a filmmaker. And, ultimately, 
this film's often extreme sex and nudity (which had to be slightly trimmed 
when the MPAA first stamped the film with an NC-17) serves a definite purpose 
when dealing with the characters' conflicts, invoking a certain place and 
time, and leads to one of the more powerful moments in this 
long-but-not-too-long 144-minute epic. </P>
<P>Set during the hottest summer on record in New York City, in 1977, while 
serial killer David Berkowitz, the .44-caliber killer, later titled the Son 
of Sam from a letter he sent to writer Jimmy Breslin, was going on a rampage, 
murdering primarily women with shoulder-length brown hair. The movie may be 
named after the Son of Sam, but he, as well as his grisly acts, pose as 
supporting characters. Instead, the film is about that fateful and memorable 
summer, when NYC was ablaze in hysteria due to the killings, and when many 
frightened women were getting blond wigs or getting their hair dyed. It was 
also the summer when, as already mentioned, there was an extreme heat wave, a 
city-wide blackout, and mass looting. Amidst all of this are the central 
characters, living in the Bronx. Vinny (John Leguizamo) is a hairdresser who, 
night after night, goes out with his sweet wife, Dionna (Mira Sorvino), to 
various night clubs to dance the night away. What Dionna does not know about 
Vinny is that he is a compulsive cheater, feeling the need to have sex with 
seemingly every woman he meets except his wife. When Son of Sam strikes 
within moments of him leaving an area where he was having a quickie with 
Dionna's cousin in a parked car, Vinny believes that he is next on the 
killer's hit list, and takes it as a sign to change his philandering ways and 
become a good, faithful husband again. This vow, indeed, proves more 
difficult than he anticipates. The other running story thread in the film 
deals with Vinny's best friend, Ritchie (Adrien Brody), who returns to his 
old neighborhood after living in Manhattan, but to the surprise of all of his 
old buddies, has taken up with the punk movement, complete with spiked hair 
and a leather dog collar around his neck. An amateur musician for his band 
called Late Term Abortion, Ritchie hooks up with the neighborhood slut, Ruby 
(Jennifer Esposito), and secretly begins to dance at a gay porn theater and 
make pornos for the extra money. When two police investigators approach a mob 
boss (Ben Gazzara) to help them search for the mysterious Son of Sam, he 
turns them down, but opts to rally up a group of his own friends to make a 
list of suspects, gradually narrowing them down to a select few.</P>
<P>"Summer of Sam," like some of the very best films (Robert Altman's 
incomparable 1975 masterpiece, "Nashville," comes quickly to mind), is a 
wildly ambitious motion picture overflowing with characters and stories, all 
of which are somewhat pawns in the grand scheme of things to vividly and 
accurately portray a certain place, this time that "place" being NYC in the 
summer of 1977. Aided by Spike Lee's fresh, assured direction, "Summer of 
Sam" is an electrifying, high-charged drama that is easily one of the most 
engrossing films I've seen thus far in 1999. Moving at a dizzying pace from 
one character and predicament to the next, the film only stops long enough to 
carefully observe the people's interactions with each other, and even then it 
has energy to spare.</P>
<P>Watching the film, you are not merely watching what is going on, but are 
practically put right in the middle of the horrifying chaos. The alternate 
desperation and fear that the characters are feeling, not only due to the Son 
of Sam but also from their own troublesome relationships, is always strongly 
palpable, and the film also succeeds as seldom period pieces do. Technically, 
while most movies set somewhere in the past usually seem like a bunch of 
actors playing dress-up and the settings looking manufactured, "Summer of 
Sam" feels as if Lee has literally gone back in time and really made the 
picture in 1977. To acquire this, a great deal of work has gone into the set 
decoration, production and costume design, research on the year of 1977, and 
Lee experiments with several different film stocks to give the picture an 
"in-the-moment" feeling. The cinematography, by Ellen Kuras, is strikingly 
distinct and moody, further helping along the setting of 1977. Another 
decisive technical element that is cause for praise is the astounding, edgy 
music score by Terence Blanchard that occasionally gives off an air of 
dreaminess and fantasy amidst the nightmare going on. Complimenting the score 
are the perfectly-chosen '70s songs, and it is one of the strongest song 
compilations on a period movie in recent memory.</P>
<P>Lest you have misunderstood, the Son of Sam killer, David Berkowitz (Michael 
Badalucco), is intermittently shown as a severely unstable man in extreme 
stages of schizophrenia. Pounding his heavy-set body down on the bed in his 
trashed apartment, writing wicked, ominous messages on the walls, Berkowitz 
is constantly being annoyed by the black labrodor retriever whom allegedly 
told him to kill in the first place, and in a shocking moment that might have 
been transformed into an unintentional laugh if it wasn't for the painful 
realism in which it was presented, the dog speaks to him briefly (voiced by 
John Turturro). When Berkowitz sets out to shoot and kill his victims, the 
murders are graphically, but non-exploitatively shown. There are no false 
scares and rising suspense, just a blink-and-you'll-miss it look of horror on 
the peoples' faces before the gun points straight for them and, BANG, they're 
life has been taken from them. Too often serial murder is superficially 
looked upon in mainstream films, so credit Spike Lee for taking these 
sequences and turning them into stark moments of pure, unadulterated terror.</P>
<P>John Leguizamo has had a misfortune so far in his acting career because he 
has been given usually comic, one-note roles (1997's horrific comedy, "The 
Pest," 1995's "To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar"). In his 
first strictly dramatic role that I can remember, we are finally given a 
glimpse of Leguizamo as a talented, serious actor. His character of Vinny has 
his virtues--he cares for those people around them, is the symbol of normalcy 
around his off-beat, foul-mouthed friends who hang out at a "Dead End" street 
corner--but more often than not is a seriously flawed, unlikable man who 
blatantly has casual affairs despite the love and care that his wife gives 
him, and when he is caught, foolishly believes that she will forgive him for 
what he's put her through.</P>
<P>Academy Award Winner Mira Sorvino (1995's "Mighty Aphrodite, where she gave 
the best supporting performance of the decade) plays his suffering wife, 
Dionna, as a loyal woman who is close to her father and works as a waitress 
at his Italian restaurant. Suspecting Vinny is cheating on her, and unable to 
please him sexually, Dionna becomes distressed that something must be wrong 
with her. Starting off as the token "wife," Sorvino's Dionna eventually is 
uncovered to show us an unexpectedly strong woman who is firm in her beliefs 
and knows what is right and wrong. Leading to the most heartbreaking moment 
in the film, Dionna goes along with Vinny to Plato's Retreat, a sleaze club 
that turns into a free-for-all orgy. Feeling that if she participates in it 
with Vinny, she will gain his respect, Dionna is devastated afterwards when 
Vinny blames her for the whole experience, accusing her of not caring about 
him. Sorvino does not strike one false note, as we are able to deeply 
sympathize with what she is going through, even more so when she is revealed 
to be an intelligent, free-thinking woman later on.</P>
<P>Adrien Brody is exceptional as the misunderstood Ritchie, the character who 
is most suspiciously looked upon due to his quick-changing punk/musician/porn 
lifestyle, even though he clearly has the most virtuous personality. Seeking 
to be an individual, Ritchie is always changing his physical appearance and 
not really sure where his life is headed, but is loyal to Vinny, listening to 
his problems when even he knows what Vinny is doing could potentially destroy 
Dionna.</P>
<P>All other performances in "Summer of Sam" are also top-notch, particularly 
Ben Gazarra; Jennifer Esposito, who adds a fetching naturalism to her 
relatively underwritten role; and Patti LuPone, as Ritchie's mother who loves 
him dearly but finds herself throwing him out of the house because of her 
overpowering new husband (Mike Starr). Even Spike Lee appears as an 
inadequate news reporter who pops up every now and again to make a commentary 
on the goings-on in NYC, and adds a much-needed light dose of humor to the 
overpoweringly dark material.</P>
<P>Controversy has been surrounding "Summer of Sam" ever since Spike Lee began 
filming the picture in the exact neighborhoods where David Berkowitz once 
prowled the streets. This simple thought gives the film an added eerieness, 
but Berkowitz and the families of the victims have cried out about how 
exploitive this film would be. The good news for them is that they are wrong; 
the movie does not center or dwell on the gruesome slayings, but wisely 
exposes an open-ended tapestry of feuding stories, characters, and 
occurrences within a 2-month time period. Jimmy Breslin opens and closes 
"Summer of Sam," saying, "There are 8-million stories in the Naked City, and 
this is one of them." It is, indeed, and a truly spellbinding and powerful 
one at that.</P>
