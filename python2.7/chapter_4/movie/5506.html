<PRE>                                HEAVY METAL
                       A film review by Lewis Butler
                        Copyright 1995 Lewis Butler</PRE>
<P>Well, it's been fifteen years, and the near mythical HEAVY METAL is
finally out on video tape, and will be out on Laserdisc next month.</P>
<P>HEAVY METAL was never legally released on video, and the film has been tied
up in some sort of littigation almost since it's release, if not before.
I'm not up on the legal details,but I seem to recall it had something to do
with the soundtrack.</P>
<P>Anyway, its scarcity elevated the film to a cult status that was probably
undeserved.  The film, enjoyable as it was, and is, is very much a product
of the 70's, and it's age shows.  The film (a group of vignettes, tied very
loosely together) is uneven, though the animation is well done throughout.</P>
<P>People who haven't seen the film in 15 years might find they are
disappointed, though it's not so bad that it won't be enjoyable.  Still,
you might leave the theater thinking, That was >IT<?</P>
