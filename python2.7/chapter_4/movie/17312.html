<P>HILARY AND JACKIE
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)
October / 2:02 / 1998 / R (subject matter, language, brief 
nudity/sexuality)
Cast: Emily Watson; Rachel Griffiths; James Frain; David Morrissey; 
Charles Dance; Celia Imrie; Auriol Evans; Keeley Flanders
Director: Anand Tucker 
Screenplay: Frank Cottrell Boyce<HR>Even before the opening credits roll, "Hilary and Jackie" has two 
strikes against itself: First, it's a biography of a musical genius - in 
this case, celebrated cellist Jacqueline du Pré, the Jackie of the title 
- and second, the story eventually focuses on her battle with a deadly 
disease - in this case, multiple sclerosis. Both topics that would seem 
to play better on the small screen of any given TV-movie-of-the-week, 
but pretty much from the opening scene on, "Hilary and Jackie" justifies 
its cinematic status with a crisp visual style, great-sounding 
orchestral presentations and at least one performance that guarantees 
serious Oscar consideration. </P>
<P>That'd be Emily Watson, whose staggeringly brilliant work as the tragic 
Jackie is pretty much everything Academy voters look for in a Best 
Actress candidate. However, the Hilary du Pré character, played by 
Rachel Griffiths ("My Best Friend's Wedding"), doesn't get top title 
mention for nothing, and it'd be a shame if her subtle - but every bit 
as moving - acting was overshadowed by Watson's far showier role. The 
jury's currently out on whether or not that will happen, but already 
assured is that these lovely ladies put power and presence into a 
true-life tale filled with the kind of emotion and human drama that 
requires such treatment to really hit its heartbreaking story home. </P>
<P>"Hilary and Jackie" sets up a tale of pseudo-sibling rivalry in 1950s 
England, when the du Pré sisters were young girls (nicely embodied by 
Keely Flanders and Auriol Evans, respectively) and it appeared Hilary, a 
natural on the flute, would become their family's claim to fame. But 
when Jackie reveals herself to be a cello prodigy after watching 
Hilary's gift garner much attention, their futures are altered forever; 
the former puts away her dreams for a fulfilling domesticity while the 
latter spirals into madness brought on by her musical success. For the 
second time in her life, Jackie begins to long for what Hilary 
possesses: sheer, stable normalcy with a loving husband (David 
Morrissey) and kids. </P>
<P>This story is told in halves - first from Hilary's point-of-view and 
then Jackie's - a gimmick that seems initially frustrating but pays off 
beautifully in the concluding hour, when viewers are allowed to finally 
see most of the puzzling past events from both sides of the coin. There 
are a few underexplained forays into the deeper, more questionable 
branches of their relationship, especially some bed-hopping business 
after Jackie asks Hilary to help fulfill a shocking favor, but even in 
the film's weak moments, Watson and Griffiths (one or the other is 
nearly in every frame) deserve and demand attention. Simply put, these 
women work wonders. </P>
<P>Also remarkable is how debut director Anand Tucker avoids the pitfalls 
of this type of picture by slathering his potentially devastating canvas 
with restraint - "Hilary and Jackie" never stoops so low as to indulge 
in blatant manipulation or false emotion. Screenwriter Frank Cotterell 
Boyce ("Welcome to Sarajevo"), who based his work on real-life Hilary 
and brother Piers' memoir "A Genius in the Family," might skimp on 
certain details that better the bond between Hilary and Jackie, but 
makes up for his shortcomings by concocting scenes that will hang in the 
memory for a long time. One such rendering is a haunting beach-set coda 
that perfectly emphasizes how unforgettable certain pieces of this movie 
are.<HR>© 1999 Jamie Peck

"The most ethical guy on the production must have been Norman Hollyn, 
the editor, because he didn't cut anybody out, and there must have been 
people willing to do him big favors to get out of this movie." -Roger 
Ebert on "Mad Dog Time"</P>
