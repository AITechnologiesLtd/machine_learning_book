<PRE>                               CRIMSON TIDE
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Almost the entire film takes place aboard a U.S. submarine
equipped with long range nuclear missiles.  What the film makes clear
is that a nuclear war is a nuclear holocaust for the whole world; there
would be neither winners nor losers of such a war.</P>
<P>     When the Nationalist Russians tangle with the rebellious Russians
as to who will have control of Russian nuclear missiles, the U.S. fleet
is put on alert.  At all costs, the rebels, who have already declared
the U.S. an enemy, must not be allowed to get control of the missile
site.</P>
<P>     Captain Frank Ramsey (Gene Hackman) who has been the commander of
the sub, the Alabama, for many years, and his very intelligent but new
Executive Officer, Lt. Commander Ron Hunter (Denzel Washington) are in
charge of the sub.  When an Emergency message comes over the wireless
to get missiles ready if they have to be fired should the rebels take
over the missile site, everyone on the sub realizes what could lie
ahead for the world.</P>
<P>     The Navy rule is that both the Captain and the Executive officer
have to be in agreement before the missiles can be fired.  At that
point another message comes through saying (paraphrased) "Have the
missiles ... " but the radio is down and the rest of the sentence
does not come through.  It is at this point that the Captain and
Executive officer get into a fierce disagreement which turns to
mutiny.  The Captain wants the missiles to be fired; the Exec officer
wants to wait until they can read the rest of the message.  What if the
message read "Have the missiles taken off the ready.  There is no
longer a crisis"?</P>
<P>     Mutiny, encounter with a Russian sub that is firing at them while
both subs spot each other under the water, and the radio out of
commission, all make for a thrilling film.  If it were not that in 1981
I had seen another submarine film, the German DAS BOOT (which was many
times better), I would give CRIMSON TIDE a higher rating.  In addition,
some of the CRIMSON TIDE's crucial endings are predictable.</P>
<P>     My suggestion then is to see CRIMSON TIDE but be sure to get a
video of DAS BOOT (The Boat), preferably in German with English
subtitles.</P>
<P>Others in the cast include Matt Craven, George Dzundza, Viggo
Mortensen, James Gandolfini and others.</P>
<PRE>Directed by Tony Scott.</PRE>
