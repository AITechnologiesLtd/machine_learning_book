<P>If you were to watch all of Jean-Claude Van Damme's movies and assign a
value to each of them based on campiness, plotting those points on a
graph would reveal a decidedly downward trend. One might think, though,
that Van Damme would eventually sign on a good movie, and that the graph
would finally bottom out before heading upward again. But, if one
thought that, one would be wrong. KNOCK OFF, the latest feature from the
infamous martial arts expert, is so void of any redeeming qualities that
it becomes questionable as to why it was even made. Even long-time fans
of Van Damme's work will be disappointed by this one. </P>
<P>As always, with this sort of feature, the writer/director team attempts
to cover up for the lack of substance by creating a plot that's overly
complicated and rarely to the point. In KNOCK OFF, Van Damme plays
Marcus Ray, a fashion designer working for V-Six Jeans Company in Hong
Kong. He, along with his business partner Tommy Hendricks (Rob
Schneider), happen upon some local mafioso who are in the business of
making knock-off jeans and slipping them into the shipping manifest.
There's one catch, though: the knock-off jeans are loaded with the
ultra-high-tech nanobombs - tiny devices which contain the explosive
power of a half-stick of dynamite but look like buttons. Bring in the
Russians (apparently they developed the bombs) and the CIA (they're out
to stop the Russians) and you've got a full-scale action movie on your
hands. </P>
<P>That's about the one thing that works for KNOCK OFF: the action.
Unfortunately, it's so overdone and trite by now - Van Damme is only
following in a trend that was initiated and mastered by Jackie Chan -
that it's not even worth it. This is a far cry from the explosive
mixture of martial arts and guns that was so popular in UNIVERSAL
SOLDIER. Van Damme never was very good on-screen, and now his longevity
is beginning to show it. Unlike Arnold Schwarzenegger, who's managed to
turn out an enjoyable feature once in a while, Van Damme has not matured
to any level of watchability in recent years. </P>
<P>Rob Schneider is thrown in for comedy, but his ability to deliver the
sidelong, snappy one-liners is hampered by the poorly written script.
It's hard to believe that this piece of writing comes from the same man
(Steven De Souza) who wrote DIE HARD. De Souza makes unnecessary
melodrama out of Hong Kong's change from a British colony to a Chinese
protectorate, and this only emphasizes the lack of substance. Unlike
another recent failure, THE AVENGERS, excuses cannot be made for the
cast and crew involved here; Director Hark Tsui has not made an American
film prior to this and Van Damme's movies have never received critical
praise in this decade. Hopefully Hollywood dollars will now be spent on
making more realistic and enjoyable movies after the sure box office
failings of this picture, for word of mouth will spread fast and it will
not be good.</P>
<P>FINAL AWARD FOR "KNOCK OFF": 1.0 star - a poor movie.</P>
