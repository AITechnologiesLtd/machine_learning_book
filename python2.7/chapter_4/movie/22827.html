<P>Isn't she great? Well, she's actually a boisterous 2nd rate actress who
strikes it big after writing a gossipy trash novel filled with all of the
dirtiest stories she'd ever heard and calling it "Valley of the Dolls".
Hmmm...not so great in my eyes, but definitely an interesting
behind-the-scenes look into the life and times of one Jacqueline Susann and
her rise to fame. She's actually pretty so-so.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Director Andrew Bergman claims that this film is "loosely based" on the life
of Jacqueline Susann, a woman who began her career in showbiz with two-bit
parts and radio spots, and ended up as one of the most controversial and
successful novelists of her generation. Starting from the 1920s and into the
late 60s, this movie also accentuates the impact of her relationship with
husband/publicist Irving Mansfield.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Interesting, funny at times, well cast, this movie works when taken in as
the story of an underdog whose determination, persistence, flair and tinge
of talent take her to the top, but surrenders to mediocrity when considering
itself an all-out comedy or romance drama. I didn't really know what this
film was about before entering the theatre, so just the fact that it was
able to keep me interested all the way through, is a point in its favor.
Having always held a strong interest in discovering the background of all
grass roots success stories, this film handed me a fine helping of
nutritious facts, despite some apparent "loosening" of her real-life story.
One of the areas of this film which didn't quite work for me on the other
hand, included the relationship with her husband/publicist, which seemed
arbitrary and just plain odd in my eyes. The humor was also pretty spotty,
with some solid guffaws from Midler, Lane and Channing from time to time,
but overall, it felt more like a chuckle-and-smile film than anything else.</P>
<P>David Hyde Pierce was also pretty solid as the tight-ass WASPy character, as
was John Cleese, whose small role was actually funny just for his 60s jive
and clothing. In fact, I really did enjoy most of the cast, despite my
reluctance to accept some of their obvious overacting early on, but when the
curtain call came to set, the whole thing just left me with a "whatever"
feeling. I suppose that the many people who do know of this lady, her books
or the movies made in their name, might enjoy this on another level
altogether, but if you're like me, and know little about this woman or her
sleazy novels, I don't think you'll be taken on to any kind of ROCKY
"let's-go-out-there-and-kick-some-ass-in-the-world" type feeling. I would
say that it's a nice movie, enjoyable to watch, but even easier to forget.
See it if you're in the mood for light laughs or appreciate the work of any
of its principals, and enjoy its underdog-done-good story in the meantime.
Otherwise, you could always wait until this puppy shows up on your local
video rental shelves or skip it altogether. Trust me, she's not that great
and your life will be fine without her.</P>
<P>Also, if you're like me, and you happen to live in Montreal, Canada, well,
you could also make a game out of this film, and try to spot any of the
local hangouts which were dressed up like New York in this camouflaged
movie.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Ironically, it turns out that the real Jacqueline Susann wasn't particularly
funny, and that her relationship with Irving Mansfield was actually
"somewhat unconventional", but I guess that's just showbiz!
Well-known critic Roger Ebert has one movie screenplay credit, and it came
by the way of his gig as screenwriter on the so-called "sequel" to the
original VALLEY OF THE DOLLS movie, called BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS.
Known for having written and directed such films as STRIPTEASE, THE FRESHMAN
and HONEYMOON IN VEGAS, this is the first time that director Andrew Bergman
directs a picture based on someone else's screenplay. Interestingly enough,
Bergman received his first writing credit along with four other men,
including Richard Pryor and Mel Brooks, for the 1974 hit comedy BLAZING
SADDLES. Bergman also has a Ph.D. in American History from the University of
Wisconsin.
Interesting casting note in the scene featuring Steve Lawrence and Eydie
Gorme singing at Jackie's "Valley of the Dolls" best-seller party: the part
of Steve Lawrence is played by their actual son, singer/songwriter David
Lawrence, and Debbie Gravitte, who has appeared as Eydie Gorme in the past.
All exterior shots in this film were completed in Manhattan, despite the
rest of the production being shot in Montreal, Canada, due to economics.
Screenwriter Paul Rudnick, best known for his screenplay of IN & OUT, is
rumored to be the writer of a monthly satirical film review column in
"Premiere" magazine, under the name Libby Gelman-Waxner.</P>
