<P>`We run tings. Tings don't run we.'
    -Sound advice from Capone (Paul Campbell) to his squaddie (or
partner), Floyd (Winston Bell).</P>
<P>Jamaican film, shot entirely on video, featuring a standard cop movie
plot mixed with a dash of John Woo-styled brotherhood morals (and a
little gunplay).  Capone, a tough as nails super cop, gets a transfer
back to his hometown of Kingston after successfully taking down some
gangsters that have broken into his home (while he was with his lady)
and killed his partner in front of him.  When he arrives, he discovers
that the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse, thanks mainly to the
crime boss Wonie (Jamaican film veteran Carl Bradshaw), so named because
his left hand has been amputated and replaced by a grasping hook). 
Capone discovers that Wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of
charity supplies for the area churches and, much to his disappointment,
also finds out his childhood friend Ratty (Mark Danvers) has been
helping him.  Torn between doing his job and protecting his best friend,
Capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right
again.</P>
<P>Directed deftly by first time Jamaican filmmaker Chris Browne (assistant
director for such American films as How Stella Got Her Groove Back and
Instinct), one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while. 
Shots are handled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances
of the aforementioned John Woo films, although the action isn't as
hyperkinetic as most of Woo's films are.  The action scenes are handled
with a kind of flair though, and eventually begin to take on a life of
their own (beyond the Hong Kong films that they are obviously patterned
after).  The make-up effects are particularly good in these scenes as
well, with flawless squib work on display from the effects team.</P>
<P>The cast is superb and listening to their dialogue, spoken with thick
Jamaican accents (half of which have to be subtitled because of their
extensive use of slang), just adds to the interest.  Paul Campbell, as
the `loose cannon' Capone, essays his role perfectly, displaying the
right amount of menace and compassion at the right times.  Mark Danvers
evokes sympathy as Ratty, the part-time gun smuggler who is also trying
to help the community by building football fields and organizing block
parties to bring people together.  Unfortunately, Carl Bradshaw is given
the least to do and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective
(largely because his underlings seem to run all over him), but then
again, that could be the way his character was intended to be portrayed.</P>
<P>The music in the film is composed of all reggae songs, and the
soundtrack was produced by Grammy Award winning artists, Sly and Robbie
(who have worked with the likes of The Rolling Stones, Maxi Priest, Bob
Dylan, James Brown, Grace Jones, Herbie Hancock, Bootsy Collins, and
Carly Simon among others).  The end credit song, `We Run Tings', by the
group Red Dragon, is pretty decent and carries on the theme of the movie
established early on by the quote that opens this review.  Oddly enough,
Desmond Ballentine (who plays the character Deportee) is well known as a
pioneer in the realm of `gangsta' reggae as the performer Ninjaman, and
he doesn't contribute a single song to the film (that I could see),
which is virtually unheard of here in the US.</P>
<P>At the time of this writing, Third World Cop has been put into limited
theatrical release in the US, coming off of a six-month box-office
breaking run in Jamaica, where it holds the position as highest grossing
film of all time (bringing in $21 million in Jamaica, which is roughly
$500,000 US).  Palm Pictures (the company that released the offbeat, but
entertaining Six-String Samurai) is the company releasing the film and
considering that their main focus is the DVD market, I can imagine that
a disc will be available once the film has left theaters.  Chris
Blackwell, founder of Palm Pictures, was also involved in the production
of another Jamaican box-office smash in 1981 entitled Countryman, so I'd
say he has a pretty good track record.</P>
<P>Overall, Third World Cop is a pretty entertaining homage to the films of
John Woo, Ringo Lam, Tsui Hark, and many other action films by directors
from Hong Kong.  If action films are your thing and you don't mind
intermittent subtitles, then you can't go wrong with this film.  The
performances and the story are solid (if only a little cliched) and the
action is tight.  I'm not sure what the other Jamaican films released in
that country are like, but apparently Third World Cop's honors are well
deserved.</P>
