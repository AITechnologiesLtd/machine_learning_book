<PRE>American History X</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>"Whewwww." An exclamation you'll likely hear exiting a showing of Tony
Kaye's American History X. The film is a pressure cooker of kerosene set on
simmer. Most of us tend to avoid tension in our daily lives, so if you've
forgotten how to stay calm while somebody probes you with a pointed object
such as racism -- either you should stay home or make sure you watch this
film to it's end.</P>
<P>Yes, whether you're white, black, yellow, Jewish, Christian, or even a
visiting extra terrestrial -- you are very likely to have an exercise in
restraint. And yes, American History X could be likened to a bent and rusty
dental implement; it's audience, a less than perfect set of teeth. Sound
like fun? "Fun" is definitely not the befitting word. But "poignant" might
be. Especially if you are temporarily mesmerized by the thought of hating --
as in race hate. Then take a look at this picture.</P>
<P>Aside from the uncomfortable feeling one gets at the sight of a bald white
man with a swastika the size of a tarantula tattooed to his chest, the film
was a bit awkward getting off the ground. The first 20 to 30 minutes were
aggravated slightly by some stiff dialogue and sticky acting. But after
that, a tar-thick layer of tension was cimematically laid via strong script,
careful direction, photography and a subject matter that has the strength in
it's little pinkie to tear America in half.</P>
<P>The middle is where this film effectively grabs (or should I say pins) the
viewer. A gritting dinner table scene with mother's boyfriend (Elliott
Gould) and skinhead Derek (Edward Furlong) serves Rodney King concentrate
instead of orange juice. I think I've still got my date's nail marks in my
wrist from that one. In another scene, Derek, being handcuffed in slo-mo,
connects eyes with his younger brother. That one glare tells the story of
their intense relationship. In fact, that one scene is the screenplay of
American History X in a glance. Artfully done.</P>
<P>I usually get antsy in longer films. My butt cheeks get cramped, or I'm
grinding my teeth to keep my bladder from bursting. For once, this is a film
I thought could have gone longer. Derek, gets a perspective-setting lesson
in prison (talk about posterior discomfort!). This and a wonderfully
developed friendship with a black inmate set his transformation in motion.
But it happens a bit too quickly for me.</P>
<P>All in all, Kaye paces this project well. Through its intense scenes and
grainy black and white flashbacks, the tale is revealed to us carefully.
It's a bold film, not afraid to speak it's mind. If you're bold enough to
see it, exercise your tolerance and sit through the whole thing.</P>
<P>American History X is high school student Danny Vinyard's (played by Edward
Furlong of T2 fame) essay on his older brother, Derek (Edward Norton) a
white supremacist skinhead just released from prison after killing two black
men.</P>
<P>Starring Edward Norton and Edward Furlong with Elliott Gould and Avery
Brooks.
Directed by Tony Kaye. Rated R.</P>
<P>Grade..........................B</P>
