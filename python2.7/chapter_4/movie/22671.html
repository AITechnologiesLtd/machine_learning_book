<P>---Those of you in the Portland, Maine are can hear Mac VerStandig's 
movie reviews every Friday morning on 98.9 The Point radio.---</P>
<P>Despite opening with footage of old black and white 16 millimeter film, 
Magnolia quickly splices away from many time-revered filmmaking 
fundamentals and bravely ventures into cutting-edge territory. In that 
sense, the film is a true first effort and, like many freshman attempts, 
the end-product is only semi-interesting but extremely noteworthy 
because of the boundaries it crosses.</P>
<P>The film, however, isn't director P. T. Anderson's initial voyage into 
Hollywood. He previously achieved momentary fame with the critically 
acclaimed but Academy-snubbed Boogie Nights. Many of the cast and crew 
members from that 1997 effort join him again here. He re-embraces a 
similar filmmaking style in Magnolia, but those that think Boogie Nights 
was as new-age as they could handle, will likely struggle through this 
production.</P>
<P>A dying father, woman at his side, a nurse taking care of him, a quiz 
show host, a well-intentioned cop, a coke-sniffing daughter, a former 
quiz show champion, a current quiz show champion and a sex-craving 
instructor of "Seduce and Destroy" courses. Throw in some men at the 
gallows, Hustler magazine and a mind-boggling biblical reference and all 
the pieces fit together as in a very fragile jig saw puzzle. But don't 
dare blink, because the one major connecting piece is quick, quiet and 
very subtle. It is trying to connect those pieces that is the film's 
plot. </P>
<P>Not only does the movie venture outside the lines with the 
aforementioned unconventional plot, but the actual filmmaking technique 
used by P. T. Anderson might give some Tisch professors nightmares. The 
supposedly unbreakable 180 degree rule, which states that no cut should 
be made in one scene that jumps more than 180 degrees, is flagrantly 
ignored. Ditto the concept of never intentionally cutting off someone's 
head in the frame while they are talking. Yet the most shocking 
violation comes when Anderson uses shaky handheld footage, a technique 
normally only utilized when absolutely necessary, voluntarily.</P>
<P>In front of the camera is a rather impressive cast including Jason 
Robards, Philip Baker Hall, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H. Macy, 
Julianne Moore and John C. Reilly. But the real treat is Tom Cruise who 
ventures into this film having just played a sex-craving New Yorker in 
legendary director Stanley Kubrick's last movie, Eyes Wide Shut. Here he 
is a sex preaching Californian whose in-your-face course includes 
lessons like "How to fake like you are nice and caring." (I would list 
more, but this is a family website.) Cruise will likely finally get an 
Oscar for this film in the form of Best Supporting Actor, after his 
previously being snubbed in the lead actor category for films like Born 
on the Fourth of July and Jerry Maguire.</P>
<P>I am told that P. T. Anderson's director's cut of this movie was five 
hours long. I have little doubt that those 300 minutes of footage are 
boldly original and might fascinate hardcore film junkies. But to most, 
the movie will lose steam after about two hours in its current three 
hour state. Although its too early to tell, P. T. Anderson could 
ultimately end up leading a filmmaking revolution in Hollywood. Lets 
hope he doesn't cure insomnia in the process.  </P>
