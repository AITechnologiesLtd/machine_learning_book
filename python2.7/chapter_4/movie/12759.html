<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>The best scene in Hope Floats is the first one, and I somehow knew that
the rest of the film wouldn't live up to this scene even as I was
watching it.  We are introduced to Birdee Pruitt (Sandra Bullock), who
is on a talk show thinking that she's getting a free makeover with her
best friend.  What Birdee actually learns on national television is that
her best friend is having an affair with her husband.  This is a funny
scene, but it's also moving, and director Forest Whitaker does something
that is not easily done -- he makes the character sympathetic before we
know her.</P>
<P>It's also an interesting and unusual way to begin a really sentimental
and formulaic bundle of schtick.  After this beginning (which,
unfortunately, belongs in a different film), Bridee leaves her husband
and takes their daughter, Bernice (Mae Whitman), with her.  She goes to
stay with her mother, Ramona (Gena Rowlands), in Smithville, Texas. 
There, she drowns in her own self pity.  She was once the most admired
girl in the town (she was prom queen for three out of the four years of
high school), but now that her peers have seen her emotionally
disemboweled on a scummy talk show, she's little more than a town joke.</P>
<P>I'm sure that screenwriter Steven Rogers thought it necessary to add a
love interest to this mix of ideas, so he did that.  We learn of the
existence of Justin Matisse (Harry Connick, Jr.), who, of course, has
always had a crush on Birdee (but he detests the word "crush" and
insists that it's only used in high school).  Most of the conflict
arises through the mother-daughter relationships, for young Bernice is
not happy with her mother, and wants to believe that her father is going
to come and save her from this awful little hick town.</P>
<P>I don't typically like movies like these because they only have one
agenda -- to make you cry.  I didn't cry at any point during Hope
Floats, and I don't think I was more than a little bit moved by any of
the scenes.  There's a very significant problem in this, though, because
the audience is supposed to care when good and bad things happen to
characters in films.  It's not really that the characters don't have
enough development (because they do).  I think the main problem is that
every situation here is something that we've all seen in so many
formulaic dramas just like this one.</P>
<P>Take, for instance, everything that has to do with Bernice.  The child
is upset because she needs to be upset because it works for the story. 
But the film never gives her much of a reason to be upset, and any child
that age could probably understand the fact that her father was the one
doing the bad stuff in the relationship.  And if she has a deep,
inexplicable resentment for her mother (which seems to be the only
possibility that the film allows), then the entire story should be
dedicated to that theme.  In the end, though, the situation is concluded
with an easy and unconvincing talk between Birdee and Bernice.</P>
<P>I know, I know, this is a "chick flick," right?  It's supposed to be a
little predictable, and just pretty safe all around, right?  Well, why
does it have to be?  Why can't a film be engineered to appeal to people
wanting lighter films and still surprise you with a few interesting
turns in story and characterization?  You can still have the obligatory
happy ending and not make everything work out so perfectly well at the
end.  The biggest problem I have with movies like this is that the only
reason things happen and characters exist is to get the story from point
A to point B (I would elaborate on one particularly annoying element,
but that would take the surprise out of it). </P>
<P>Still, Hope Floats isn't unbearable or even that difficult to sit
through -- the actors all make the film watchable.  Bullock is, in my
humble opinion, a fantastic actress with a lot of strength.  She holds
this film together beyond Whitaker's sappy, heavy-handed direction, and
keeps my interest in her strong.  Also good is Connick, who gives a nice
low-tone performance here.  Rowlands is a pro, and handles this part
like a pro.  I didn't much care for young Mae Whitman, but that's mostly
because the screenplay makes her such an annoying child.  I did,
however, greatly enjoy Cameron Finley, who plays the oddly eccentric
young nephew of Birdee.</P>
<P>There are good things to be said about this film, but for the most part
it doesn't have the sweeping emotional resonance that dramas need in
order to be successful and moving.  The pieces are in place for a good
story, but Hope Floats instead relies on the good old formula, and the
result is a picture that will show you a lot of things that you've
probably seen a few times before. </P>
