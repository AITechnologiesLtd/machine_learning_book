<PRE>GHOST DOG: THE WAY OF THE SAMURAI
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 2000 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        He moves through the night with the lumbering bulk of the grizzly
bear and the stealth of the sleek panther.  He cruises the urban NYC
streets in stolen luxury cars listening to his favorite gangsta grooves on
the surround sound.  He worships at a makeshift altar with incense and
oranges.  He sleeps with the pigeons.</P>
<P>        When he strikes, his hits are swift, effortless, and final.  He is
Ghost Dog and his ways are those of the Samurai.</P>
<P>        He, Ghost Dog, is played by Forest Whitaker in a lumbering, sleek
performance and he, Whitaker, is directed by Jim Jarmusch, the decidedly
inventive filmmaker of such oddball classics as "Stranger than Paradise"
and "Night on Earth."</P>
<P>        Whether or not you're a Jarmusch fan, it's hard to deny that his
films--quintessential indie successes all--have all paid strong attention
to casting.  Think John Lurie's laconic, deadpan turn in the melancholic
"Stranger than Paradise," or Screamin' Jay Hawkins as the larger-than-life
concierge of "Mystery Train," or Johnny Depp in "Dead Man."  And let's not
forget Roberto Benigni's star-making role in "Down by Law."</P>
<PRE>        So, too, with Whitaker in "Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai."
He's a standout.</PRE>
<P>        Ghost Dog is a professional killer who lives the life of an 18th
century Samurai.  His bible is the "Hagakure," a little ivory book which
contains the ancient rites and rituals of the Japanese warrior and from
which Whitaker narrates, in voiceover, accompanying the film's periodic
title-boards.  Ghost Dog is devoutly loyal to his Lord and Master, a
small-time mobster called Louie (John Tormey), who once saved his life.
Unfortunately, Ghost Dog's latest contract now has its "complications" and
the bosses who ordered the hit want Ghost Dog whacked.</P>
<P>        With his hooded fleece pulled up high above his head like a monk's
habit, Ghost Dog moves from hit to hit with a briefcase full of guns and
gadgets and a brooding look on his benevolent face.  Although his
reputation is that he speaks to no-one and has no friends, Ghost Dog shares
some literary advice with a young girl he meets in the park, and
"converses" with his best friend, a French-speaking Jamaican ice cream
vendor who understands no English.  (Odd.  Jarmusch himself appeared as an
ice cream vendor in Billy Bob Thornton's accomplished "Sling Blade."  But
anyway...)</P>
<P>        This is a thoughtful, compelling performance from Whitaker--would
that they gave awards for this kind of film.</P>
<P>        In truth, Jarmusch's latest outing doesn't have much more than a
"mysterious contract killer hounded by disloyal crime syndicate" plotline
at its center but, as in all of his films, the writer/director embellishes
a simple storyline with richly drawn characters, evocative music (here
provided by hip-hop artist THE RZA), lush photography (Ghost Dog is shot
from end-to-end by veteran cinematographer Robby Müller), and a wicked
sense of humor.  There's a scene in which Louie tries to explain to a trio
of crime lords (Cliff Gorman, Henry Silva, and Victor Argo, fantastic faces
all) just how little he knows about Ghost Dog that is truly hysterical.</P>
<P>        From its evocative, pigeon's eye view opener to its closing high
noon showdown, "Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai" is another offbeat gem
from the offbeat, irreverent genius of Jim Jarmusch.  And it's the latest
in a long string of excellent performances from Forest Whitaker.</P>
