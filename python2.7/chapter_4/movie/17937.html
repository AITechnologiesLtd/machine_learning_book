<P>The spectre of Cameron Diaz hangs heavily over "Lost & Found," and not
just because the film climaxes with David Spade rocking out with a
version of Neil Diamond's "Brother Love's Travelling Salvation Show"
that outdoes Diaz's tuneless rendition of "I Just Don't Know What To
Do With Myself" in "My Best Friend's Wedding.</P>
<P>Long before that unnerving sight, anyone who went to the movies last
summer will recognize "Lost" for what it is: a diluted variation on
Diaz's blockbuster "There's Something About Mary." Instead of bodily
fluids in hair, "Lost" offers dog excrement being smeared on the face;
in place of the now-infamous zipper gag, we get Spade trying to
conceal his naked figure in an apron after losing big in a strip poker
game.</P>
<P>For the under-12 crowd who couldn't persuade Mom and Dad to rent
"Mary" for them, this might serve as a decent substitute. But anyone
who's not a dyed-in-the-wool Spade fan might be crying "Just Shoot Me"
well in advance of the closing credits - which, by the way, try to do
for Deee-Lite's "Groove is in the Heart" what "Mary" did for the
Foundations' "Build Me Up Buttercup."</P>
<P>Spade, with customary smirks intact, plays Dylan Ramsey, a bistro
owner who spends considerably more time trying to put the make on
comely French neighbor Lila (Sophie Marceau) than he does putting out
kitchen fires and dealing with customers.As part of his plot to catch
Lila's eye, Dylan kidnaps her beloved dog Jack, and when Lila becomes
distraught over her chien's disappearance, Dylan is right there with a
shoulder to cry on.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, it's Dylan's turn to weep when the voracious Jack
swallows a diamond ring Dylan was holding on to for a friend. And the
tears just keep on coming as one of Dylan's employees, the
relentlessly jolly Wally (Artie Lange) decides to turn himself into a
clone of the boss.</P>
<P>Lange, in a part obviously designed to position him as a replacement
for the late Chris Farley (Spade's co-star in "Tommy Boy" and "Black
Sheep"), comes off as merely a pale imitation; say what you will about
Farley, but he had considerably more bluster and gusto than this new
model. As for Marceau, she's adorable and earned every franc of her
paycheck.</P>
<P>But the primary fun here comes from an unbilled cameo by Jon Lovitz as
a "certified dog whisperer" Dylan enlists in the hopes of retrieving
the ring. To call the rest of the humor in "Lost & Found" hit or miss
would be kind.</P>
