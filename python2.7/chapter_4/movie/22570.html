<P>What makes Johnny and Mary run? To the movies, that is. No one really 
knows for sure. Market Research is an approximate non-science. With 
or without it a few things are obvious. The main target of Hollywood 
(the term is used generically) is the under 30 public. Publicity will 
help, hype,  celebrity actors, awards, and so on.</P>
<P>Yet the precise influence of reviews is unfathomable. The bulk of the 
audience reads no reviews. The smaller but still sizable group of 
potential viewers who do read the critics consists of movie 
professionals in one way or another: aficionados, critics, film 
students, people who parse newspapers and magazines...</P>
<P>Most persons in this sub-group limit themselves to one or two 
reviewers, especially if the latter have built up attraction and/or 
trust among their readers. A major example of this was  for many 
years the appeal of Pauline Kael in the New Yorker magazine. Another, 
current case, is the huge popularity of critic Roger Ebert.</P>
<P>But even for faithful followers, a laudatory review is often 
superseded by the question to end all questions : "what is the movie 
about?" Which may result in attending a show -- even if Ebert gave it 
a lukewarm rating -- or not attending, in spite of the critical 
praise, because the film's genre or type is unattractive.</P>
<P>"Felicia's Journey" is about a serial killer. That's all that may 
matter to John and Mary Doe, who may (mostly John) either get their 
kicks from such a subject or be repelled by it.  But here "serial 
killer" is an oversimplification. We neither see nor hear violence 
and there is minimal "Old Dark House" scariness.</P>
<P>Felicia, a 17-year old from County Cork, is bereft of her boyfriend 
Johnny  now gone to find work in England. There's no news of him, but 
plenty of news for him: Felicia is pregnant. She encounters hostility 
from her own, widowed father, and from Johnny's mother.</P>
<P>As the story is told in bits and pieces --and crucial, skillful 
flashbacks--Felicia thinks that Johnny is working in a lawn mower 
factory in Birmingham, the Midlands. In fact he has enlisted in the 
British Army. This is a betrayal of his Irishness, one of several in 
the story. Felicia's father, a fanatical Irish nationalist, betrays 
his daughter who, according to him, has also betrayed her country. 
"You're carrying the enemy within you." Johnny's mother cheats by not 
forwarding Felicia's letters. And there's more to come.</P>
<P>The very naive girl  sets on a journey to find her lover. She crosses 
the sea, reaches the industral Midlands, is confused, and in a chance 
encounter meets Joseph Ambrose Hilditch, who offers to help her.</P>
<P>Hilditch is an amiable, plumpish quinquagenerian who manages the food 
services of a large factory. He is respected by his admiring staff 
for his culinary judgments. He is, in fact, nothing short of a 
gourmet, and in the oddest of places. Since in spite of the Michelin 
Guide's stars, the UK is not exactly a haven of gastronomy, Hilditch 
is a multiple oddity in his profession and his private life. He is 
aloner without any public life outside the factory.</P>
<P>Hilditch lives alone in a large house whose innards and decor mix 
Victorian, Edwardian, and 1950s styles. You expect antimacassars, 
hand-wound granfather clocks, samplers on the walls, aspidistras. But 
what catches your eye is the man's huge kitchen, his large array of 
old but functioning culinary tools, his antique Mixmaster, his 
kitchen video set. Also his collection of popular, Mantovani-style 
LPs of the 50s era.  Outside the house, the past is symbolized by 
Hilditch's old-fashioned suits and his small, old British  Morris 
car, a kind of VW or Fiat Topolino.</P>
<P>The past and haute cuisine meld as Hilditch obsessively watches tapes 
from way back, tapes of Gala's cooking programs on TV. He follows her 
instructions and prepares refined dishes for just himself.</P>
<P>Gala, a Frenchwoman-in-England (played by director Egoyan's wife 
Arsinee Khanjian) was a great favorite of the public when Hilditch 
was a child. Her appearances, cajoling and imperious, are like a 
subtle take-off on such programs. And a young Hilditch shows up in 
them. Gala was his mother.</P>
<P>Which goes a long way in explaining (or does it?) that Mother-Smother 
is at the root (or a catalyst?) of chidhood traumas which turned 
Hilditch into a serial killer. (The film has sensibly eliminated the 
sexual mother-son element). He has, over the years, "helped" a number 
of women with problems (e.g. runaways or prostitutes); he has, in 
these days of electronics, recorded them and their talks on tape. But 
there are no images of the actual murders. Felicia, that other loner, 
is next in line, but...</P>
<P>Of Armenian descent, Atom Egoyan was born in Cairo, grew up in 
Canada, and is one of most prominent filmmakers of that country as 
well as the world. This, his eighth feature, contains many of his 
themes and preoccupations, is more concentrated than usual, avoids 
arty pitfalls, and is essentially a character-driven psychological 
two-hander. Beautifully and intelligently shot and edited, in both 
literal and symbolic ways, it is refined. Ireland is a feast for the 
eyes, yet cruel towards Felicia. Birmingham is cold and miserable, 
yet, ambiguously, what warmth there is comes from a killer.</P>
<P>The movie is much closer to Bluebeard and  Beauty and the Beast tales 
and very far from Vlad the Impaler. Hilditch is, in odd fashion (the 
key words for this film)  likable and pitiful. He is superlatively 
well acted by Hoskins who has said that his character was a cross 
between Winnie the Pooh and Jack the Ripper. A not-so-obvious 
originality in the film -- for visual reasons--was his casting. 
Rotund and/or short killers in movies are the exception and to a 
lesser degree this applies to plain villains too, to whom it is 
easier to give a lean and hungry look. Of course this is not an 
inflexible rule,   especially when one thinks of Fat Man Sydney 
Greenstreet  in "The Maltese Falcon," or Laird Cregar  as the main 
suspect in the Jack the Ripper melodrama "The Lodger" (1944)</P>
<P>The story-telling is both simple and complex. It evokes sympathy for 
Felicia's misery and her naive pluckiness. It is balancing act 
between sad empathy and alienation for Hilditch. Additionally, it 
handles the dangerous  trick of having some un-jarring black humor. 
What do you expect from a movie featuring a Miss Calligary?</P>
