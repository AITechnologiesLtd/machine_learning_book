<PRE>My Best Friend's Wedding
Review by Larry McGillicuddy
Copyright Larry McGillicuddy 1997</PRE>
<PRE>**** (out of 4)               
Directed by PJ Hogan                                        
Starring Julia Roberts, Dermot Mulroney, Cameron Diaz,      
Rupert Everett, M Emmet Walsh, Rachel Griffiths, Phillip    
Bosco                                                       </PRE>
<PRE>While most people were lining up to check out the 4th       
installment of the immensely popular Batman series, I       
decided to wander over to this movie. 2 hours later, I would
leave the theater with a huge smile, having just witnessed  
the most charming, spirited romantic comedy of the decade.  
What a great lift after the miserable experience known as   
Speed 2: Cruise Control.                                    </PRE>
<P>Former lovers Julianne and Michael once made a pact that    
when they turned 28, if neither had found someone else, then
they would marry each other. Three weeks before the deadline
he calls Julianne and tells her he's getting married, to    
someone else. She is obviously upset by this, but agrees to 
attend the 4 day wedding party in Chicago so she can have a 
chance at fouling up the wedding.                           </P>
<P>Cameron Diaz plays Kimmy, Michael's fiance who immediately  
asks Julianne to be her maid of honor. As it turns out,     
Kimmy is more resourceful than Julianne imagined. An attempt
early in the movie to embarass her in a karaoke bar         
completely backfires, as Kimmy ends up singing to a cheering
audience. This is more than just an extraneous third        
haracter that you get in most love triangle romantic        
comedies. Diaz invests her character with so much energy,   
cheerfulness, and innocence that you just want to leap      
through the screen and give her a hug.                      </P>
<PRE>Then, Rupert Everett, as Julianne's editor and confidante,  
enters the picture, and I can just say that next year's     
Oscar nomination list for Best Supporting Actor only has 4  
slots left. He comes to Chicago to help her out, and        
pretends to be her fiance. Everett takes what could've been 
a stereotypical and offensive charaterization and makes it  
seem fresh and hilarious. The films highlight comes when    
Everett leads the whole wedding party in singing "I Say a   
Little Prayer for You". PJ Hogan directs this scene like a  
Broadway musical, and the result is so entertaining,        
touching, and lively that it becomes a moment of pure       
ecstasy.                                                    </PRE>
<PRE>The final third of the film throws away all we know and     
expect about romantic comedies. Most viewers will think they
see the conclusion coming a mile away. But there are several
twists and turns in the final act, and you never are sure   
who will end up with who.                                   </PRE>
<PRE>All 4 leads are outstanding. Mulroney is basically only     
asked to look confused and be attractive, both of which he  
does exceedingly well. Diaz is a knockout, and is not       
content to give up any scene to her co-stars. Everett shifts
his character from lovable goofball to reliable friend and  
back again. He is equally effective at both. And Roberts    
gives audiences what they've been asking for. Here she is in
all her splendor. She takes her Pretty Woman charm and adds 
a little depth to it.                                       </PRE>
<PRE>I had been so utterly charmed by My Best Friend's Wedding,  
but when the end came near, I was worried. How could they   
possibly wrap this up to please me? The movie had done such 
a great job of creating so many likeable characters, I      
figured any ending would have to be a sad, downbeat         
conclusion, but what Screenwriter Ron Bass comes up with is 
touching and honest. What is this other movie that opened   
Friday everyone keeps talking about? For some reason, I cant
remember the title.                                         </PRE>
