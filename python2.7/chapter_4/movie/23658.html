<P>It's a good thing that I didn't see "American Beauty" when it was 
released back in October; I would've had a hard time choosing between it 
and "The Green Mile" for 1999's "Best Of".  As it is, I'm having a 
dickens of a time making my personal Oscar pick between them.</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Residents of Plastic Suburbia, U.S.A. populate "American Beauty"...</P>
<P>Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), a fortysomething burnout whose highlight 
of the day is the time he spends with himself each morning in the 
shower, feels as trapped by his now-loveless marriage to his wife 
Carolyn (Annette Bening)--a mediocre real estate agent who can't quite 
see past the plastic liners on her furniture, her house, and her 
life--as she feels trapped by him.  Lester seeks a new life through 
rebuilding his body through exercise, as suggested by gay lovers Jim 
(Scott Bakula) and Jim (Sam Robards)--arguably the most "normal" 
residents of their little villa.  Carolyn, meanwhile, seeks mentorship, 
and a wee bit more, from real estate king Buddy King (Peter Gallagher).  
Equally trapped in their misery is their daughter Jane (Thora Birch); 
and as if normal teen angst wasn't enough for her, she also has to deal 
with her father's men-o-pause attraction her very blonde (and she knows 
it) cheerleader friend Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari).  </P>
<PRE>And, behind door number two...</PRE>
<P>...the Fitts are Watchers Of Life: dope-dealing loner Ricky (Wes 
Bentley) watches Jane and her family while he tapes them via camcorder; 
bulldog Colonel Fitts (Chris Cooper) watches son Ricky turn into a 
zombie under the Colonel's cold, austere regiment; and all-but-braindead 
mother Barbara (Allison Janney) watches life go by in a haze of her own 
non-existence.</P>
<P>True poster families for Dysfunctions R Us.</P>
<P>The Upshot:
While I may have not seen "The Insider" until its Oscars re-release 
because, well, I didn't want to, my reasoning for missing "American 
Beauty" the first time around is much less harsh: I simply forgot to, 
until it was too late.  This is to my deficit--because "Beauty" lives up 
to its hype. </P>
<P>There's little doubt that these are people you wouldn't normally want to 
associate with everyday--but in fact, probably do.  "Look closer", 
indeed: is flabby, unmotivated Lester really unlike sloppy 
Joe-down-the-street?  Doesn't Carolyn remind you of that obnoxious Avon 
Lady that keeps ringing your doorbell just as you're sitting down to 
dinner?  And face it: if Jane hasn't started bringing guns to Public 
School 101, she probably will soon.  Yes, America: these are the people 
in your neighborhood/in your neighborhood/in your neigh-bor-hood...</P>
<P>And look closer yet: beyond its portrait of dysfunctional suburbia in 
all its ugliness, "Beauty" has humor, glimmers of hope, wonderful 
cinematography, and above all, kickass performances throughout.  </P>
<P>As Lester, Kevin Spacey is, in a word, magnificent.  An actor's actor, 
Spacey lights up the screen in nearly every scene he's in.  Equally 
convincing both as a burnout and as a rejuvenated weightlifter, the only 
time I questioned his character was near the end, when he took a giant 
leap backwards, character development-wise (and since to say more would 
mean spoiling the movie unnecessarily, I'll just leave it at that for 
now).  But even with that seeming character mis-step, Spacey the actor 
was solid through and through.  Though I've wavered between "Beauty" and 
"Green" ever since seeing this film, my choice for Best Actor is 
crystal-clear.   As they used to say back in the day, "no comp".</P>
<P>Good on a different (and, somewhat lesser) scale is the rest of the 
cast.  Annette Bening gives a Oscar-worthy performance as Carolyn 
(though I still think that Hilary Swank should win for what I've seen of 
her "Boys Don't Cry" performance), proving yet again her range as an 
actress.  And though most reviewers trumpet Thora Birch as angry, angsty 
daughter Jane, my favorites among the supporting cast are Chris Cooper 
as the Colonel, and especially Wes Bentley as Ricky.  I've made it a 
point to look for both Cooper and Bentley in upcoming movies; I'm sure 
we haven't heard the last of either of them.  </P>
<P>For me, the sign that a director has done his or her job well is that I 
notice something behind the acting, but not quite know what that 
something is.  This was borne out in "Beauty", with Sam Mendez's 
"unseen" touches adding icing to a well-baked cake.  One scene in 
particular that I noticed his work came when Jane and Lester were seen 
talking through a kitchen window; though I listened and saw what was 
going on, I also noticed the row of bottles filled with colored liquid 
(which reminded me of a Photoshop class I'd just taken), and that 
further made me notice the use of light and shadows throughout the 
scene.  I had to snap out of it so I wouldn't miss the forest for the 
proverbial trees.</P>
<P>Where some would see those bottles as an unnecessary distraction, I saw 
the Beauty; it was a good touch on what might have otherwise been Just 
Another scene.</P>
<P>The "Black Factor"  [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
In her "American Beauty" review, my esteemed colleague The Diva implied 
that this movie may be more relevant to White audience members than to 
Blacks, because the types of dysfunctions portrayed are more typically 
seen in White suburb dwellers.  While I agree to a point, I'd say that, 
considering the phenomenon of "Buppies" and (for lack of a better term) 
the "Whitening" of the more affluent amongst us, the Melting Pot effect 
may see a few more of Us looking very much like Lester and Carolyn--and 
the Colonel.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
I'd like to think think that my Brilliant Exposition is the 
be-all/end-all of my reader's existence, but that would be folly.  And 
in fact, the "American Beauty" site I happen to like most was not even 
done by an American (though she is most def a Beauty): I invite you to 
look closer at my good friend Katy Lindeman's tribute to "Beauty" (at 
<A HREF="http://www.americanbeauty.freeserve.co.uk/">http://www.americanbeauty.freeserve.co.uk/</A>).  It's a real beaut.</P>
<P>"American Beauty" (rating: greenlight):
If this movie does for Dysfunctional Suburbia what "Fatal Attraction" 
did for...uh, Dysfunctional Suburbia...hmmm...</P>
