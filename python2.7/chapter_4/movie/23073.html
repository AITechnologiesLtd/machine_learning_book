Summer of Sam (5/10)</PRE>
<P>In the sweltering summer of 1977, New York was terrorised by the serial
killer known as Son of Sam. Although the killer and his crimes feature
in Summer of Sam, Spike Lee's film is more concerned with the squabbles
of a group of young Italian lowlifes and misfits who hang around on
street corners, swear a lot and beat each other up. </P>
<P>It is the year of Saturday Night Fever and punk. Philandering
hairdresser Vinnie (John Leguizamo) takes his wife Dionna (Mira Sorvino)
to the disco, while Ritchie (Adrien Brody) has embraced the punk
movement and started wearing spiky hair and affecting an atrocious
English accent. They live in a Bronx neighbourhood where, it is thought,
the killer might live, and suspicion soon falls on the increasingly
estranged Ritchie, whose punk look and lifestyle is making him an
outsider.</P>
<P>Certain sequences, such as the killings themselves, are stylishly
realised, but the film succeeds or fails by the character studies of
Ritchie and Vinnie. Ritchie is an interesting character we can believe
in and sympathise with, but the characterisation of Vinnie is utterly
tiresome. The character is a louse, sure, but he could have been made an
interesting louse, instead of which he bores while he repels. And this
is a long film. The characters must also have something to do that
interests us and develops the story or relates somehow to the film's
themes. I suppose the film was about loyalty and suspicion, but it took
an awfully long time to say, well... not a lot really.</P>
<P>It is possible that the film was not properly projected the day I saw it
(the BBFC certificate before the film did not have the customary
brilliance and clarity I've come to expect from the usually excellent
Warner cinemas) but the film seemed poorly photographed, and this dull
look added to the feeling of gloom and tackiness the film inspired. </P>
<P>With Summer of Sam's New York setting and its cast of Italian wiseguys,
Spike Lee must have known he was inviting comparison with Martin
Scorsese. Despite some good performances and some interesting moments,
its script ensured that Summer of Sam could never be anything more than
a brash but ultimately dull Scorsese pastiche.</P>
