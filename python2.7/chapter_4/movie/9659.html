<PRE>EVENT HORIZON is dreadful horror.</PRE>
<P>No, it is not a bad film, in fact it is so good in achieving its purpose, I
actually wished for the film to end itself quickly. EVENT HORIZON is not
your run-of-the-mill sci-fi film, I'm sure many who have watched this will
agree with me. It is not even original in that sense, and it does borrow
heavily from films like ALIEN, HELLRAISER and even BLADE RUNNER. The magic
of this film lies in its unorthodox setting and methodical build-up that
makes it wonderfully horrifying.</P>
<P>The story brings us to the year 2050, where space travel have since
enormously progressed. The EVENT HORIZON is actually a ship built for a
secret experimental purpose; it has the ability to fold time and space thus
making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in a man's
lifetime. The ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation but after
7 years, it reappeared again within the orbit of Neptune. A search and
rescue team led by Miller (Fishburne) is given the task to check for
survivors of the EVENT HORIZON. The designer of the ship, Dr. Weir (Neill)
follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually happened to his
otherwise technologically impressive ship.</P>
<P>EVENT HORIZON is a sci-fi horror film, much truer to the word than say,
ALIEN would ever be. While in ALIEN, the crew has to cope with a ferocious
creature while encased within tight spaces, in EVENT HORIZON, the forces
which goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful and
horrifying. The story unfolds itself slowly and the suspense buildup is
superb, up till the point where I really felt like saying out loud `enough!
I can't stand this anymore!'. There are more than enough jolts to send your
adrenalin pumping overtime. The story in itself is not exactly something
very exciting and also, the acting is only at most, average by most
commercial standards. Even so, the essence of horror is carried out very
well in this film, thanks to its well-paced storytelling, disturbing set
designs and some really gory sequences (which incidentally, has been quite
generously removed by our censorship board).</P>
<P>Director Paul Anderson (who did MORTAL KOMBAT) and his team of `atmosphere'
creators have done well in keeping EVENT HORIZON within the bounds of the
term `horror'. This picture did not do very well in the US box-office most
probably for the dread-factor impact it has on most audiences; people will
not see it again and not many would recommend their friend to watch this.
Although on the face of it, EVENT HORIZON is mostly molded for
mass-entertainment; many thrills, spills and suspense to keep audiences in
focus. However, the offbeat horror element which it ultimately convey
audiences is very disturbing. My friend and I could not say a word to each
other for quite a while after going through the `experience' of EVENT
HORIZON. I guess it was just the immense feeling of dread which the film
had cast upon us.</P>
<P>Be forewarned, this film is not for the faint-hearted nor for pure
entertainment. Be prepared to be disturbed if you should decide to watch
this film! EVENT HORIZON is highly recommended‡‡but at your own risk! It
has been a long time since good-horror embraced the big screen, and EVENT
HORIZON is one.</P>
