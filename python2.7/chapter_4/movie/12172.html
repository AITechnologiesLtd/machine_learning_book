<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>There are many films about that great jungle guy Tarzan, but I've only
seen a couple of them.  I've been subjected to Tarzan, the Ape Man
(1932) with Johnny Weissmuller, which is one of the earliest, if not the
earliest, of the series.  Although considered a classic by some, I found
it to be an intensely dull film on every level.  The other that I've
seen is Greystoke (1984), with Christopher Lambert as Tarzan and Ian
Holm as his friend.  That film I enjoyed very much; it's well-made,
well-acted, and seemed to update the very dated concept competently.</P>
<P>Now, in 1998, we are given Tarzan and the Lost City, staring Casper Van
Dien (of Starship Troopers) as the man in the title.  It's much more
like the 1932 film, although far worse in every way.  This is a
profoundly boring cinematic experience.  Not only is it boring--it's a
terrible film.  It's poorly acted, terribly written, ornamented in
sloppy special effects, and a shameless Indiana Jones rip-off.  Even the
sets and locations, which should be vast and exciting, are dull and
perfunctory.  I'm not a fan of Tarzan to begin with, but I can
appreciate a good film about him.  Tarzan and the Lost City had me
looking at my watch every five minutes.</P>
<P>I've thought long and hard about how to synopsize the story, but the
"story" of this 83-minute feature is so thin that I find it vastly
difficult to do so.  Van Dien, as I mentioned, plays Tarzan.  We are not
introduced to him as a character--he simply appears in an early scene,
dressed in a tuxedo, apparently having already passed the humanizing
phase that I thought was present in all Tarzan films.  </P>
<P>The next scene has him telling Jane (Jane March) that he needs to go to
Africa to stop somebody bad.  Jane is also given no real introduction;
when we first see her, it's like we're already supposed to know who she
is and what she's like.  This is a major flaw:  this film, since it's
not an official sequel or continuation of any story, should start from
scratch and introduce characters--especially the main characters--in a
formal way.  Since it doesn't, the characters are never explained or
developed, and there's nothing to care about.</P>
<P>Well, they get to Africa, and Tarzan quickly takes off his clothes to
be a jungle guy.  It turns out that he's there to stop a mad fortune
seeker named Nigel Ravens (Steven Waddington), who's butchering African
tribes in his trek to find the Lost City described in the title.  What's
in the Lost City?  Who knows.  Why does he want to go there?  Don't
bother asking.  Even the climactic scene provides nothing but a light
show (and a poorly-animated one, at that), and never do we hear a single
coherent explanation of what the freakin' heck this piece of twaddle is
about.  The film even uses magic in a few scenes to solve problems
(Tarzan gets bitten by a poisonous snake, and is saved my magical bees),
and where this magic comes from or what it is remains a mystery at the
end of the film.</P>
<P>Did I mention the film is boring?  The direction by Carl Schenkel is
without even a hint of style to make it interesting, and a dry action
film is never good.  There's not a single clever shot in the entire
film, and there's not a scene to be found that is interesting, exciting,
funny, or charming.  There are a lot of moments featuring tribesmen
dancing, and none of this is new.  When they finally reach the Lost
City, it's just a big map painting of a pyramid.  I was expecting to be
enthralled in the visual presentation of this film (I didn't see any
previews for it beforehand), but there's nothing here to elicit
wonderment or awe.</P>
<P>The acting just isn't good, but there aren't any characters, so it
barely matters.  Waddington overacts in a rare way, but it's still not
fun like most overacting usually is.  March has almost no lines, and
therefore doesn't have much of chance to prove anything.  Van Dien's
wooden (but not terrible) acting is appropriate for Starship Troopers,
but here he needs to carry the whole show.  He looks right for the role,
but he begins the film with a hint of some unknown accent, and slowly
loses it as the film progresses.  This isn't that big of a deal, really,
because the screenplay (written by *two* people with apparently no
judgment whatsoever) provides almost no dialogue through the second half
of the film.</P>
<P>Tarzan and the Lost City is not a good Tarzan film.  It's not a good
film by any comparison, or by any definition of a "good" film.  It is
not entertaining.  It is not well-crafted.  It's a boring chore, an
exercise in inadequacy and ineptitude.  I don't recommend it, even if
you like bad films, even if you love Tarzan films.  I didn't care about
Tarzan films before this, and I'll approach them with skepticism from
now on.</P>
