<PRE>SMOKE 1995
 A film review by Timothy Voon
Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon</PRE>
<P>Cast: William Hurt, Harvey Keitel, Stockard Channing, Harold Perrineau
Jr., Forest Whitaker, Ashley Judd Director: Wayne Wang Screenplay: Paul
Auster</P>
<P>Smoking is a carcinogen, and it also hardens your blood vessels causing
coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease and cerebrovascular
accidents. In short you either die of lung cancer, a heart attack or
become an invalid, that is, unless, you die of old age first....and
everyone in this movie smokes.</P>
<P>Imagine taking out the garbage, making dinner, getting groceries or
buying a newspaper. This is what this movie feels like ….very ordinary.
Strangely enough, being ordinary is its greatest strength.</P>
<P>Wayne Wang in his lapse-a-dasical manner, goes the long way about
telling a story about a grocery store owner (Keitel) who likes to take
photos, and smoke; who has an ex-girlfriend (Channing) needing money and
help, who also smokes; they have a illegitimate daughter who is drug
addicted and has an abusive boyfriend, who probably smokes; a regular
customer (Hurt), is an author, who chain smokes; he befriends a runaway
teenager, who learns to smoke; the kid is searching for his father
(Whitaker), who smokes expensive cigars. They all end up at a family
picnic smoking.</P>
<P>This is a very slow, non-involving movie, which has it's moments, but is
best left for nights when one is suffering from insomnia.</P>
<P>Comment: Where's the warning label that says smoking can be hazardous to
your health?!</P>
