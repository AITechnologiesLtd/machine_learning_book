<P>     For the most part, despite an impressive track record with
animated films, Disney hasn't awed anyone with its recent live-action
releases.  Poorly-scripted, weakly-acted, and unaplogetically
politically correct, these features have been more like cookie-cutter
cinematic candy than anything worth consuming.  Thankfully, THE JUNGLE
BOOK represents something of an entirely different breed.</P>
<P>     Beautifully photographed and tightly paced with a spate of solid
performances, this latest Kipling-inspired motion picture is an
enjoyable and exuberant film-going experience.  Where Disney's animated
JUNGLE BOOK was a light-hearted affair, this rendition is more of a
straightforward adventure.  That's not to imply that it's in any way
stodgy or somber; comic relief is provided by an orangutan called King
Louie and a human named John Cleese.</P>
<P>     Taking place in late 19th-century, British-occupied India, THE
JUNGLE BOOK's story is uncomplicated:  a human boy who has grown up in
the jungle is lured back to civilization by the sight of a beautiful
young woman.  There, surrounded by a few who wish to help him and many
whose motives are less pure, he learns to speak and act like a man.
Eventually, his enemies, motivated by jealousy, ill-will, and greed,
drive him back into the wild.  Once there, the battle for life becomes
a struggle of man's guns against the Law of the Jungle.</P>
<P>     Those familiar with the animated feature will recognize some non-
human characters, including King Louie, Baloo the bear, Bagheera the
panther, and, of course, Shere Khan, the tiger king.  Mowgli, the "wild
boy" of the Black Jungle, is portrayed by Jason Scott Lee.  This
performance, while not of award-winning caliber, is characterized by a
number of nice little "man/beast" touches.  Lena Headey, as Katherine,
is the object of Mowgli's love, but she's engaged to a British officer
(Cary Elwes) who kills wild animals for sport.  Sam Neill plays
Katherine's father, and John Cleese is the kindly Dr. Julius Plumford.</P>
<P>     The most remarkable thing about THE JUNGLE BOOK is Juan Ruiz-
Anchia's photography.  With its striking shots of lush forests,
cascading waterfalls, and catacomb-like treasure chambers, the movie is
a visual feast.  Nevertheless, THE JUNGLE BOOK rarely pauses to savor
the scenery, moving instead with a pace that disallows opportunities
for boredom.</P>
<P>     There are moments when THE JUNGLE BOOK may be too intense for
small children.  Animal maulings, while shown obliquely, occur on
screen.  Those old enough not to be disturbed by such things should
enjoy this movie, regardless of whether they consider themselves
adults, kids, or something in-between.  Disney isn't just courting the
younger audience with this film, either.  Jason Scott Lee's wardrobe,
frequently limited to a loincloth, is designed to display his tanned,
well-muscled body.</P>
<P>     THE JUNGLE BOOK doesn't offer any thought-provoking philosophical
messages, and its view of good and evil is simplistic (characters
clearly fall into one category or the other), but that lack of
complexity is part of its charm.  This film proves that the company
behind THE LION KING can create worthwhile entertainment regardless of
whether the animals are real or illustrated.</P>
