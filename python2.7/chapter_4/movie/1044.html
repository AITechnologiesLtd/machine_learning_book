<PRE>                                CITY SLICKERS
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1991 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     CITY SLICKERS is a movie by Ron Underwood, written by Lowell Ganz
and Babaloo Mandel, and starring Billy Crystal, Daniel Stern, and Bruno
Kirby, with Jack Palance, Patricia Wettig, and Helen Slater.</P>
<P>     CITY SLICKERS is a very funny, very touching film that compares
favorably with Billy Crystal's WHEN HARRY MET SALLY.  Indeed, both films
concentrate at their hearts on pretty much the same concern, a
redefinition of manhood and manliness, within the context of sustained
hilarity.  CITY SLICKERS is an amiable, well-intentioned, feel-good,
irresistible, and heartfelt comedy.</P>
<P>     Indeed, the cattle drive hadn't even begun and the muscles in my
face were already sore from non-stop grinning.  Which may be a
reflection how little smiling I do these days.</P>
<P>     Billy Crystal has been a favorite of mine since the Seventies when
he played the token gay man on TV's SOAP.  Over the years, he's gotten
funnier and no less attractive for being older.  He mugs the camera, he
throws away priceless one-liners like a maharajah scattering coins, he 
keeps us gasping as we struggle with his wise-guy, city-boy energy and
wit; he's pretty much limited to playing Billy  Crystal but for me
that's enough.  In CITY SLICKERS he's as good as he's ever gotten; his
angst over aging, over being stuck in a meaningless job, is real
without being pushed to new histrionic heights.  Crystal emotes by 
cracking wise and here he cracks very wise indeed.</P>
<P>     His two buddies are a supermarket manager (Daniel Stern) bullied by
his wife and father-in-law/boss and a gravel-voiced macho-man (Bruno
Kirby) who drives his friends to take vacations from common
sense--running the bulls at Pamplona and driving cattle from Colorado to
New Mexico.  Both actors are effective and appealing.  Stern is an
owl-eyed, life-shocked victim, a man who everyone agrees has no life.
Kirby, a veteran supporting actor, may find his role a break-away part
for his career; he is self-protecting, vulnerable, a tough guy whose
afraid, and immensely appealing.</P>
<P>     (The three of them are first seen in an opening sequence that is
part of the credits and may well be one of the funniest credits
sequences I've ever seen.  Funny and altogether appropriate to the
story to come.)</P>
<P>     Even more appealing is the camaraderie between the three men.  They
compete, they criticize, they occasionally dislike each other, but
always they love each other.  And it is the real strength of CITY
SLICKERS.</P>
<P>     Of the supporting parts, only that of Palance is really memorable.
The women are largely irrelevant in this "men's movie"; Wettig and
Slater are perfectly fine, but their parts are small.  However, it is
wonderful to see Jack Palance again, even though he looks and sounds
very sick.  He sounds like he has emphysema, gasping for every breath,
and his skin looks waxy and translucent.  Palance has been making
Westerns since SHANE, and his mere silhouette encapsulates the entire
mythos of the West for this viewer.  There is a very special scene
between Palance and Crystal that is going to be on several posters'
lists of special movie moments.</P>
<P>     The story idea is said to have been Crystal's.  It was worked up by
a veteran writing team, Mandel and Ganz (SPLASH, PARENTHOOD, NIGHT
SHIFT), and the script is definitely a strength here.  They create comic
situations that are more than funny, they also inform us about the
characters.  Underwood's (TREMORS) direction also helps the film capture
the agony of characters who find that their lives don't offer anything
other than loss and dissolution.  There is also some wonderful Western
locale photography.</P>
<P>     CITY SLICKERS isn't going to challenge you; it isn't an
intellectual heavyweight.  Instead, it's life-affirming, meaningful,
funny, skillful, heart-warming, and ingratiating.  I got my money's worth
and more and I recommend CITY SLICKERS, even at full price.</P>
