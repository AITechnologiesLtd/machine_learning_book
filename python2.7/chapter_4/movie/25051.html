<P>   When Playboy magazine critic Leonard Maltin slammed
Hugh Hudson's 1985 movie about the American War for
Independence, "Revolution," he predicted that "thanks to this
megabomb, it'll be 2776 until we get another one."  Though
critics are never wrong, this is the exception.  "Revolution,"
one of only about a half-dozen films that deal seriously with
the Eighteenth-Century conflict, featured top actors Al Pacino,
Donald Sutherland, Natassja Kinski and Joan Plowright. 
Nonetheless, Maltin called the script ludicrous and the acting
a travesty.  Unless you get a chance to take in D.W. Griffith's
1924 silent, "America," with Lionel Barrymore in an especially
villainous role, "The Patriot" will likely be your first opportunity
to see Redcoats and peasants battle in open fields, their
stated mission to prevent the armies of General Cornwallis
from moving swiftly North to New York.</P>
<P>   While "Gone With the Wind" exploited our fascination with
the Civil War during a good deal of the last century,
Americans now seem to have lost interest in that
conflagration and, indeed, for history in general.  What could
be more unusual, more horrifying, than the great experiment
in modern democracy's pitting brother against brother during
the 1860's?  And nowadays, who could imagine that
Americans could so enthusiastically fight the British people,
now our staunchest allies?  Perhaps the apathy lies with the
history curriculum, which sucks the life out of these events by
concentrating on laundry lists of causes and results and the
political attitudes of only high government officials.</P>
<P>   Utilizing Robert Rodat's ("Saving Private Ryan")
screenplay, German director Roland Emmerich presents the
rebellion of England's thirteen colonies with a full range of
human emotions and ideologies.  "The Patriot" examines the
theme of father-son conflict, pits the pleas of pacifism against
the allure of belligerence, sets the cowardice of collaboration
against the mandate of patriotism.  Some battle sequences 
rival even the exceptional panoramas of Steven Spielberg's
"Saving Private Ryan." Solid performances by Mel Gibson in
the title role and handsome Australian Heath Ledger as his
defiant son fashion "The Patriot" as a spectacle that could
cause its audience to rise up against the dull treatment of this
marvelous episode from history teachers.  By fixing attention
on the lives of ordinary southerners during the final quarter of
the Eighteenth Century, the film at once illuminates the ways
that we ourselves might have fared were we living in good old
colony times and crosses the border into schmaltz and
cutesy-poo sentimentality.</P>
<P>   Emmerich opens on a scene with the kind of humorous
metaphoric resonance that can be easily grasped by a the
broad audience which the picture hopes to attract.  Benjamin
Martin (Mel Gibson), a French-and-Indian war hero noted for
his ability to fight guerrilla style rather than confront the
enemy on open grasslands, has retired to raise his seven
children as a single parent.  Since his wife had died leaving
the youngsters largely in the custody of his sister-in-law
Charlotte (Joely Richardson), Martin is now determined to lay
down his muskets despite the call to arms by his neighbors in
the early stages of the Revolution.  But when the Redcoats
take the fighting right into Martin's back yard, gratuitously
shooting one of his sons in the back while taking another to
be hanged, Martin can no longer embrace pacifism.  Arming
his male children, he sets out to free his eldest son, Gabriel
(Heath Ledger) and avenge the death of his boy at the hands
of the evil Col. William Tavington (Jason Isaacs), whose
arrant brutality shocks even the officer's superior and
supreme commander of the English forces, General
Cornwallis (Tom Wilkinson).</P>
<P>   What follows during this two hour and forty-one minutes'
epic is a series of scenes, alternately ruthless and emotional,
as Emmerich unfolds a microcosm of the war's effect on
ordinary American families during the final year of the colonial
experience.  While critics will be divided on which aspect is
the more effective--the scenes of carnage in the fields or the
display of family tensions and political strife within the
environs of Charleston--I would applaud principally the
former. Emmerich's cinematographer, Caleb Deschanel,
makes more than effective use of costume designer Deborah
L. Scott's uniforms, the outfits contrasting the majestic attire
of the English (which ironically increased their vulnerability)
with the peasant threads of the irregular fighting forces known
as the militia.  This was a time that every citizen was armed,
when attempts to pass gun control laws would be properly
looked upon with laughter by the raggedy bunch of "farmers
with pitchforks" whose ability to take on the disciplined armies
of Redcoats so shocked Cornwallis.  (The right of the people
to keep bear arms, "a well-regulated Militia, being necessary
to the security of a free State," was to be incorporated into
the Constitution fifteen years later and to become one of the
most politically charged battlefields in our own time.)  </P>
<P>   The most memorable scene occurs shortly after the
lingering opening of the movie, as Martin hands guns to his
kids, who then methodically and with no small butchery
ambush and wipe out a force of Redcoats holding Gabriel
prisoner.  This is the scene bound to be the most talked-
about one in the movie, as present-day Americans, horrified
by a sequence of murders committed by youngsters in
Columbine High School and other institutions of learning, will
protest the butchery.  </P>
<P>   While Martin's struggle with his insubordinate son Gabriel
is well-handled--the teenager insisting on his prerogative to
sign up for the conflict like any adult--other aspects of family
life are maudlin.  Emmerich often lingers on the scrubbed
faces of the Martin brood, capturing the love-hate feelings of
Martin's youngest, Susan (Skye McCole Bartusiak) in the
manner of a TV soap while frequently cutting to the other
children, Thomas, Williams, Samuel, Nathan and Margaret
simply to evoke "awww's" from those in the audience who
enjoy expressing their affinity to young'uns.  Nor does
Emmerich shy away from too obviously suggesting the shy
attraction between Martin and Charlotte, with Charlotte at one
time pretentiously intoning, "I am not my sister."  The family
sequence that does stand out involves the mostly New
England custom of bundling, in which a young man and his
sweetheart are allowed to spend some time alone in bed
without undressing.  The way the Pennsylvania Dutch do this
is to place a wooden board between the lovers, but in the
situation at hand, Gabriel is swaddled in a primitive
straitjacket to immobilize his arms and legs before he is
joined in the sack by his girl friend, while his in-laws-to-be
retire to the next room, their ears scrunched tightly to the
wall.</P>
<P>   The largest flaw in this mostly meritorious project is its
predictability.  How often have we heard the hero hiss to the
villain, "Before this war is over, I am going to kill you," and
have the two meet in the open battlefield, seeking each other
out to decide their fate?  And how often have we seen the
tables turned as antagonists, facing each other, talk instead
of shooting, or get tricked as the opponents play dead? 
Jason Isaacs is convincing, however one-sidedly ruthless, as
the gung-ho officer who believes that the English have no
right to play by the rules of war if they want to win, and Mel
Gibson, photogenic as ever, mirrors the complexity of Tom
Wilkinson's Cornwallis.</P>
