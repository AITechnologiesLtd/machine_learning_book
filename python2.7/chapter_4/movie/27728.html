RECESS: SCHOOL'S OUT
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>Help me out with something that I just don't get.  Why would people pay 
movie ticket prices for films that are nothing more than another episode 
of a television cartoon series that they could stay at home and see for 
nothing?  I can understand this if the movie, and the series on which it 
is based, has some edge, as did RUGRATS IN PARIS.  But RECESS: SCHOOL'S 
OUT is about as generic a kids' movie as you're likely to find.  There's 
not much to laugh at and barely enough material even to keep the viewers 
awake.  It's harmless enough, but watching a blank wall is also pretty 
benign, so its lack of offensive material hardly serves as a 
recommendation.</P>
<P>RECESS: SCHOOL'S OUT is the type of movie that sets your mind to 
worrying about the strangest things.  I became concerned that a wind 
might hit the screen.  If it did, the characters, which are drawn to 
look as flat as paper dolls, would certainly all blow down, leaving us 
with no actors for the story.  Now that would undoubtedly upset the 
youngsters in the audience.  Actually the kids in our audience were so 
quiet I began to wonder if they had fallen asleep.</P>
<P>The completely forgettable story concerns a renegade ex-principal, Dr. 
Philliam Benedict (James Woods), who sets up a covert operation one 
summer at Third Street School.  The nefarious Dr. Benedict, with the 
help of a huge laser, has a plan to abolish summer vacation.  Theodore 
'T.J.' Detweiler (Andrew Lawrence) and his buddies are out to thwart the 
evil educator and save playtime for kids all over America.</P>
<P>Most of the script is as bland as Saturday cartoons, but a few lines are 
good ("Technically, after the completion of fourth grade, we are 
pre-young adults." and "I got to warn you.  I'm a black belt in 
origami.").</P>
<P>There is one saving grace for adults: the music -- high-energy, classic 
rock tunes, including "Born To Be Wild," "Dancing In The Street," "Wipe 
Out," "One" and "Let The Sunshine In."  It's about the only thing that 
will keep most of them awake.  Buy the CD.  Skip the movie.  If your 
kids want to see RECESS, let them watch it on television.</P>
<P>RECESS: SCHOOL'S OUT runs 1:24.  It is rated G and has nothing to offend 
anyone of any age.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, almost 12, gave the movie ** 1/2.  He thought the plot 
and characters needed improvement.  His buddy Maxim, age 12, gave it **, 
saying that he liked the fighting part the best.  Both of them said that 
they really liked the soundtrack but didn't like the hippie period 
flashback.  (I especially liked that scene, but I was at Berkeley in the 
60s so it brought back good memories.)</P>
