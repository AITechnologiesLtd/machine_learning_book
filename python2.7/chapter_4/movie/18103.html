<PRE>Review of Can't Hardly Wait
Written by: Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan
Directed by: Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan 
Rating: * out of ****</PRE>
<P>        Movies about teenagers and teenage culture rarely prove to be
either interesting, entertaining or convincing, because of one
fundamental reason: movies are made by adults and not teenagers.</P>
<P>        Occasionally, however, films like Say Anything, Dazed And
Confused and The Breakfast Club will break the mold and offer genuine
insight into the lives of those bizarre creatures which surround us
called "teenagers." Can't Hardly Wait, however, does not. Instead, the
writing/directing team of Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan manages to
take every cliché found in the teenage genre, strip it completely of
perception, intelligence and wit - and turn it into one of the most
nauseating cinematic experiences I have ever been subjected to.</P>
<P>        Can't Hardly Wait follows a group of characters as they attend
a house party on the night of their high school graduation. The main
characters are such perfected stereotypes that no analysis needs to be
provided to perfectly understand them: there's the average male
protagonist Preston (Ethan Embry), prom queen and cheerleader Amanda
(Jennifer Love-Hewitt), football star Mike (Peter Facinelli), white
rapper wannabe Kenny (Seth Green), computer geek William (Charlie
Korsmo), and brainy outsider Denise (Lauren Ambrose).</P>
<P>        I couldn't stand any of those characters. Whether it was
William getting drunk and signing along to heavy metal songs or Kenny
proclaiming "Yo, I gotta have sex tonight!", all I could think of was
how Elfont and Kaplan possibly managed to con Columbia Pictures out of
ten million dollars to fund their film.</P>
<P>        Apparently, Can't Hardly Wait is supposed to be a comedy, but
it tends to fail in this respect because of the fact that it's not
funny. In all honesty, Elfont and Kaplan should be forced by their
employers to attend remedial classes in humour. And when I say
"forced", I mean it. They should be strapped down to a chair and have
their eyes wedged open in a similar fashion to Alex in A Clockwork
Orange. This is how desperately they need to be educated about the
concept of humour. For instance, Can't Hardly Wait features a foreign
exchange student who is instructed to repeat absurd statements such as
"I am a sex machine." For some reason, Elfont and Kaplan believe that
if this character repeats it enough, eventually it will be funny. If
only Elfont and Kaplan could recognise the irony that they actually
got paid for making this junk - now that's funny.</P>
