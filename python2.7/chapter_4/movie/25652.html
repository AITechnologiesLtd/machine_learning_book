<P>Carrey plays Charlie - an overly friendly, gutless Rhode Island bike cop who 
one day snaps and develops a
split personality whereby he becomes Hank - a ruthless, twisted enforcer. At 
first the extreme lengths
"Hank" goes to in order to get his way are funny, but it's a joke that can't 
carry an entire film. Especially
one where the plot is non-existent and the screenplay so poorly developed the 
cliches are about the only
thing going for it. </P>
<P>The jokes here are intended to appeal to the modern audience's craving of the 
extreme, but it comes off as
tired and unoriginal. The film's vulgarity quotient is just absurd and 
offensive. </P>
<PRE>GRADE: C </PRE>
