<P>     DEAD MAN, Jim Jarmusch's first feature since 1992's NIGHT ON EARTH, 
is a quirky chronicle of one man's physical and spiritual search for a 
place of belonging.  Jarmusch chose to make DEAD MAN a western because, 
according to him, the genre is "very open to metaphor, and has deep 
roots in classical narrative forms."  Actually, any kind of road picture 
could have been used to tell this oddly-compelling tale.</P>
<P>     The main character is William Blake.  He's not the William Blake, 
of course (the English poet), although a Native American named Nobody 
(Gary Farmer) accepts him as such.  Blake is an accountant from 
Cleveland who travels to the frontier community of Machine sometime 
during the latter half of the 19th century.  When he arrives, he learns 
that his would-be employer, John Dickinson (a scenery-chewing Robert 
Mitchum who spends half of his scenes yelling at a stuffed bear), has 
filled the position.  At gunpoint, Dickinson tells Blake to get out of 
town.  But, before he can decide what to do with his life, Blake becomes 
involved in a shoot-out in which he kills Dickinson's son (Gabriel 
Byrne).</P>
<P>     Injured and on the run, Blake is befriended by Nobody, and the two 
travel together.  Their destination is a mystical place where Blake's 
spirit can cross back to where it belongs.  Along the way, they 
encounter a number of strange characters (including lawmen named Lee and 
Marvin), and are hunted by a trio of hired killers (Lance Henriksen, 
Michael Wincott, and Eugene Byrd) who are as likely to off one another 
as their quarry.</P>
<P>     DEAD MAN is an undeniably strange movie, and sometimes it's hard to 
figure out what to make of it.  Filmed in black-and-white with an eerie 
score by Neil Young, and using contemporary dialogue and mannerisms, 
Jarmusch's picture has a dream-like quality.  It's filled with irony and 
subtle humor, but contains a serious message about the fragility and 
uncertainty of human existence.  Blake, normally the mildest of people, 
discovers how easy it is to kill.  In fact, he becomes wanted for a 
series of murders.</P>
<P>     Johnny Depp has always been willing to take acting chances.  From 
EDWARD SCISSORHANDS to ED WOOD, Depp has consistently sought out 
challenges. With William Blake, he breathes life into another in his 
series of oddball personalities.  Depp's Blake is lost and injured both 
physically and spiritually.  Playing opposite the lead actor, Gary 
Farmer portrays the enigmatic Nobody with a caustic edge that makes him 
very unlike other Native American movie "sidekicks".  The impressive 
list of actors with cameo appearances includes Robert Mitchum, John 
Hurt, Gabriel Byrne, Crispin Glover, and Alfred Molina.</P>
<P>     Even if it accomplishes little else, DEAD MAN will almost certainly 
inspire thought and discussion.  This isn't the kind of movie that can 
be digested easily or immediately.  Although I don't have all the 
answers, I recognize that this provocative, puzzling movie will stay 
with you long after the twangy strains of Neil Young's end credit music 
have faded away.</P>
