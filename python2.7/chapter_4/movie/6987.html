<P>    Who is Billy Bob Thornton?  Well, he's an actor (DEAD MAN, INDECENT
PROPOSAL, CHOPPER CHICKS IN ZOMBIETOWN), a writer (ONE FALSE MOVE, A
FAMILY THING), and, now, a director.  SLING BLADE, the story of a gentle
giant who returns to his rural Arkansas hometown years after murdering
his mother and his mother's lover, is Thornton's first time behind the
camera.  His direction is good, very good, but his writing and acting--
both on display here-- are the stuff of Oscar nominations.  (And the
stuff of head-scratching.  I wonder how many people think that Joe Bob
*Briggs* is up for Best Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay?) Thornton's
performance as Karl, the slow-moving, slower-speaking small-engine whiz,
is mesmerizing.  He's Forrest Gump with fewer laughs and darker
thoughts.  Much darker thoughts.  Karl ends up staying with a young boy
(Lucas Black) and his single mom (Natalie Canerday) and, after we've met
her abusive boyfriend (Dwight Yoakam, excellent), the outcome of the
story is no longer in question.  SLING BLADE is many things, including a
catalog of unspeakable small-town (Southern?) horrors.  No, nothing is
shown on screen, but they add a grim-- and at times gruesome-- subtext
to an equally endearing and, even, hilarious tale.  Uh huh.</P>
