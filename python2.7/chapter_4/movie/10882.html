<P>   Since at least one-third of American homes have dogs as
members of the family, you may wonder what makes this
animal so endearing.  The answer is simple: we are taken in
by the unmixed love that our dogs feel for us (assuming we
treat them half-decently) and we probably envy the many
ways they are superior to us homo sapiens.  They hear
better, run faster, have a more acute sense of smell, and
judging by the way they swiftly gobble up the blandest-looking
of commercial food, we've got to assume they have a more
robust sense of taste.  Without expressly saying this, or even
mentioning these canine concepts in her movie, Penelope
Spheeris's in the hilarious "Senseless," written by Greg Erb
and Craig Mazin, concocts a funny, funny man who injects
himself with a potion that gives him these superior attributes.  </P>
<P>   "Senseless" revolves around a brilliant, but penniless,
college senior, Darryl Witherspoon (Marlin Wayans), who
works his way through Stratford University doing just about
anything that will support his stay at the school.  He not only
waits tables, the typical chore of people in his category: he
sells his blood to the blood bank and semen to the sperm
bank, two tasks that provide munificent materials for comic
scriptwriters.  When a research doctor advertises for people
willing to take an experimental drug which will increase the
five senses of those who inject it into their backsides, a
number of students turn up, but because of the alleged side
effects, only the desperate Darryl is left in the room.</P>
<P>   Using a young cast, some of whom from backgrounds with
"Saturday Night Live," director Penelope Spheeris--whose
credentials include being at the helm of the high-spirited
"Wayne's World"--unfolds a fast-moving progression of side-
splitting events that mix physical comedy, romance,
sentimentality and even Wall Street jargon so effortlessly that
the performers look as though they're having at least as good
a time as their audience.  In the beginning, when Darryl
follows the protocol given him by the scientist, Dr. Wheedon
(Brad Dourif), he's amazed at what he can do.  He sees
women wiggling their bodies on the street with his binocular
vision, hears conversations of women behind bathroom doors,
and becomes so virile that he offers to fill up a water-cooler
sized jug at the sperm bank with a single donation.  He uses
his powers to get to first base with the lovely and
sophisticated Janice (Tamara Taylor) but can get no further
because he has no proved to her that he's a super guy in the
maturity department.  He works wonders on the hockey court
and becomes a contender for the high-paying job of junior
analyst conducted by one of its executives, Randall Tyson
(Rip Torn), a job which he wants desperately so that he can
move his mother and siblings out of Harlem.  Forgetting that
more is not always better, he ignores the doctor's advice and
doubles up on the drug, causing him alternately to lose his
vision, his hearing, his sense of touch, and his smell--a
temporary handicap which provides most of the ribald humor
of the story.</P>
<P>   Marlon Wayans may have entered the movie business on
the coattails of his better-known brother, Damon, and if his
role in "Senseless" is any indication he may become the next
Eddie Murphy.  Demonstration an uncanny ability to mimic the
fast talk of Jim Carrey, the rubber faces of Jerry Lewis, the
physical shtick of Chaplin, Wayans not only keeps the
audience laughing but makes us care about him. In fact at a
recent critics's screening, a few sophisticated folks watching
the film actually yelled at the screen, "Don't! Don't! as Wayans 
is about to plunge the double-dosed hypodermic into his rear.</P>
<P>    A good deal, perhaps most, of the humor is sophomoric,
the sort of waggery that would appeal to the "Animal House"
crowd, "Senseless" probably can cross over to a crowd older
than thirty and from various ethnic groups.  David Spade of
"Saturday Night Live" is a splendid foil in the role of Scott
Thorpe, who is Darryl's well-connected principal competitor for
the job of junior analyst and Matthew Lillard is well cast as
Darryl's well-pierced roommate.  Appropriate farcical elements
are contributed by Kenya Moore as Lorraine, who is Janice's
competition for the attention of the super-hero.</P>
<P>   Cinematographer Albert Beveridge captures the swift action
on the hockey court as Darryl blocks a hundred pucks in
succession and affords us some garish, fish-eye poses to
simulate the torment which the leading man is enduring.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running time: 95 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten 1998</P>
