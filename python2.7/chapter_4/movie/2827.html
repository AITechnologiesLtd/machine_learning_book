<PRE>                             THE ADVOCATE
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                     Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  Covering some of the same
     territory as THE NAME OF THE ROSE, this is a mystery
     story set in Medieval Western Europe.  The attitudes are
     a cross between those of the time and of our own, but
     there is more than a little enjoyable "culture shock" in
     this film.  Nicol Williamson very nearly steals the
     film, but the whole cast is enjoyable.  Rating low +2
     (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     The year is 1452 and Paris lawyer Richard Courtois is tired of the
legal entanglements and corruption of city law.  He wants to use his
talents to help common people, so he and his clerk Mathieu travel to
the small town of Abbeville.  There he indeed finds that law is
different, though no better and in some ways a lot weirder.  Rural law
cases involve accusations of witchcraft, devil pacts, and sodomy with
animals.  And the law extends to human and animal alike.  If a farmer
is shown to have had sex with his donkey, both might be hung on the
same gibbet.  Animals may also be called to court to be sworn as
witnesses.  One of Courtois's first cases is a very bizarre "murder
trial," at least by modern standards.  Today such an incident would not
fall under the category of murder, but we are looking at a very
different culture.  Incidentally, the case really did get tried as it
is portrayed in the film according to historical records.  It seems at
first like a ludicrous and trivial court action until Courtois starts
sensing that the state's case is invented and may be a part of a larger
conspiracy.</P>
<P>     THE ADVOCATE is a film with a lot going for it.  First and
foremost is the setting.  Years go by between good films set in so
remote a historical period.  Even without a good plot the historical
detail by itself would keep this film intriguing.  The historic detail
that gives the film its texture and gives a feel of being very well
researched.  The viewer is consistently astonished by the differing
attitudes and life-style of the 1400s.  Unfortunately too often the
attitudes we see are a mix of that century's and our own.  Similarly to
THE NAME OF THE ROSE, the photography often appears inspired by the
master artists of the time like Breugel and Bosch.  The peasants look
grizzled and a bit grotesque.</P>
<P>     But beyond the historical detail the plot is also enjoyable by
itself.  The mystery is not one of the best or most unpredictable, but
it is likely to keep the audience guessing.  THE ADVOCATE is at once an
intriguing mystery film and a well-written drama with comedic
overtones.  One historical detail that the film makes clear is that in
the Middle Ages people were a good deal less sensitive about being seen
without clothing.  That, however, tends to make me suspect it would get
some editing before American public television would show it.  But
clearly it seems intended for some wide audience because of a major
budget and a cast of familiar actors including Colin Firth in the title
role, Ian Holm as a likable but corrupt local priest, Donald Pleasance
as Abbeville's other attorney, Michael Gough as town judge, and Nicol
Williamson thoroughly enjoying his role as a local lord.</P>
<P>     THE ADVOCATE was written and directed by Leslie Megahy, a director
nearly unknown in the United States but who has made several TV movies
for the BBC.  This is his first feature film and deserves attention.
My rating would be a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
