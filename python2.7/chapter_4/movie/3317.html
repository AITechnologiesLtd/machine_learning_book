<P>     ONCE WERE WARRIORS, a New Zealand export, is centered upon the
touchy yet timely topic of domestic violence.  It is not, however,
merely another "domestic violence motion picture."  With its complex
cultural backdrop and its stark view of this societal cancer, ONCE WERE
WARRIORS attains a level where it is equally painful and potent.</P>
<P>     The critical themes of this movie are universal, even though there
is a great deal of background that only a New Zealander (or a student
of that country's history) can appreciate.  Nevertheless, though many
elements of the subtext may be lost to outside viewers, the key
issue--the brutal cycle of violence and denial within a family--is
brought to the fore in a manner that necessitates no special
awareness.</P>
<P>     It is helpful, although not essential, to know a little about
Maori society and culture (Maoris are the Polynesian warrior-race who
settled--or, more appropriately, conquered--New Zealand some 1000 years
ago).  Equality is not a basic tenant of the Maori lifestyle, at least
as depicted in this film.  However, alcoholism and unemployment are.
It's the lot of the woman to work, while the man--the
"protector"--spends all day at the local pub getting drunk.
Wife-beating, while distasteful, is acceptable behavior, especially if
the woman has the audacity to talk back to her husband.</P>
<P>     The movie takes place in an urbanized area of south Auckland,
where Beth and Jake Heke (Rena Owen and New Zealand soap stud Temuera
Morrison) live in a small house with four of their five children.  The
fifth, Nig (Julian Arahanga), has moved out to join a local gang.  At
first glance, Beth and Jake seem to have a solid marriage.  They gripe
at each other, but all seems pretty tranquil, and there are moments of
genuine affection.  But when Jake is drunk (which is frequently), his
temper is easily ignited, and when one of Beth's barbs pushes him too
far, the bloody and violent results are terrible to behold.  Many films
have depicted wife-beatings.  Few have been as graphic and difficult to
watch.</P>
<P>     Beth and Jake's troubles have a domino effect on their children.
Boogie (Taungaroa Emile) has been arrested, and when neither of his
parents appear at his court hearing, he is sentenced to enter social
welfare custody.  Grace (Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell), the Heke's
thirteen-year old daughter, is having as much difficulty coping with
her own sexuality as with the brutal chaos of her home life.</P>
<P>     The acting throughout ONCE WERE WARRIORS is uniformly strong, with
leading and supporting actors turning in performances that range from
credible to electric.  The musical score, by Murray McNabb, is
evocative, and a perfect match for the drab, dreary colors suffusing
Stuart Dryburgh's camerawork.  Great pains have been taken to emphasize
that everyone in this film is trapped by one thing or another--if not
their circumstances, then their personality.  The only moment of
serenity--the opening scene depicting a pastoral setting--turns out to
be an illusion:  a billboard in the midst of a gray city.</P>
<P>     By anchoring ONCE WERE WARRIORS in the turmoil of a Maori family,
director Lee Tamahori takes full advantage of an opportunity not only
to dissect the forces that lead to domestic violence, but also to focus
on the clash between Maori traditions and modern values.  The snares
laid for men and women are not the only concepts put forth to ponder.
ONCE WERE WARRIORS works, to some degree, on three levels:  the
visceral, the emotional, and the intellectual, and it is the
amalgamation of these that makes this a memorable film.</P>
