<P>It is rare for Hollywood, especially in these politically correct
times, to pursue controversial biographical figures who leave a bad
taste in societal and political terms. Bad taste could be the title of
director Milos Formas's unequivocally great film biography on the king
of bad taste - the controversial Hustler magazine publisher, Larry
Flynt.</P>
<P>Woody Harrelson plays the flashy Larry Flynt (always wearing loud
disco suits) who starts out in Ohio running a plethora of strip clubs
with his patient brother (played by Harrelson's real-life younger
brother). Flynt loves the job because he can sleep with any woman he
wants. He decides to start putting nude pictures of women in
newspapers and eventually magazines. At one of these strip clubs, he
meets Althea Leasure (Courtney Love), a 17-year-old stripper who
becomes Larry's wife and business associate. They have an open
marriage - Althea is bisexual and has many male and female lovers, and
Larry can screw every woman he meets, as long as he doesn't kiss
them. Their love and commitment is deep, and their relationship
reminded me a lot of the two lovers in "Leaving Las Vegas" where two
people can fall in love despite who they are, and what they do for a
living.</P>
<P>"The People vs. Larry Flynt" is not just a love story, it is a hybrid
of events in Larry Flynt's life such as the lurid, loathsome porno
magazine he created, which has sparked dissent among feminists and the
like, the eventual tragic circumstances of the attempt on his life,
Althea's death from AIDS, and the Supreme Court ruling centering on
his right to Freedom of Speech - the right to mock any politician
without being sued for hurting his/her feelings.</P>
<P>Firstly, Forman concentrates deeply on the emotional bond between
Flynt and Althea, it is a relationship based not only on respect but
also mutual honesty.  For example, there's a crucial scene where Flynt
decides to become a born-again Christian and attracts the attention of
Jimmy Carter's evangelist sister, Ruth Carter Stapleton. Afterwards,
he decides to make Hustler a "safer" magazine by eschewing
misogynistic, violent pictures of women and replacing them with
religious symbolic collages. Althea can't and won't accept his
moralistic and religious stance - she doesn't want him to stop being
the avaricious publisher he is.</P>
<P>The second half of the movie becomes a springboard for Flynt's Freedom
of Speech defense as he is sued for libel by Moral Majority leader
Jerry Falwell (apparently, Falwell was offended by Hustler's depiction
of an incestuous relationship with his mother). As Flynt memorably
retorts, "If the First Amendment can protect a scumbag like me, then
it will protect all of you.  Because I'm the worst." He is persecuted
by all kinds of moral watchdogs, prosecutors, protesters, and
political affiliates. Flynt is a hard man to keep down - he continues
to fight even after being shot and paralyzed, enduring never-ending
trials, and jail. He doesn't stop for a second after being released
from jail - he wears an American flag as a diaper to court, throws
oranges at the judge, and becomes a political freedom fighter
defending his pornographic magazine all the way to the Supreme Court.</P>
<P>Woody Harrelson gives the boldest, most liberating performance of his
career - he growls, he spews, he laughs in the face of every judge,
and generally offends everyone because he has the right to do
so. Harrelson delivers to the fullest extent with verve and a
wonderful sense of humor - it is impossible to hate Flynt based on
Woody's emphatic, likable performance. Ditto the trashy Courtney Love
who brings a fuller sense of empathy and humanity for the smart,
vivacious Althea - she is the film's soul and it is a performance on
par with Elisabeth Shue in "Leaving Las Vegas" and Sharon Stone in
"Casino." Love also has that rare gift for an actress where she
doesn't seem to be acting - she is giving us a long look at this
woman's tragic, frail human soul (and unlike some naive critics, it
isn't due to Love's similar addictive background that gives the
performance fire and dynamic energy). Kudos must also go to Edward
Norton as Flynt's long-suffering lawyer.</P>
<P>Director Milos Forman has crafted a rich, penetrating, entertaining
tapestry of Larry Flynt's life with the help of screenwriters Scott
Alexander and Larry Karaszewski (who helmed the similarly ironic "Ed
Wood"). What the movie is most successful at is making Larry Flynt
into a national hero for all liberals out there. The screenplay,
however, omits the most obvious aspect of Flynt's life - he is
notorious in this country for his controversial magazine, and not so
much for the Falwell case. Throughout the film, we never really see
what drove or even inspired him to create such a magazine - the movie
opts to present a balanced viewpoint on the issue of censorship but it
is a mistake not to include the pictures of bestiality, violence,
masochism and, arguably, sheer hatred of women included in his
magazine (A brief shot of the infamous cover where a woman is being
fed into a meat grinder barely skims the surface). And where are all
the feminist characters such as Gloria Steinem who decried Flynt?
Perhaps I am being a bit too harsh but in order to see why so many
people hated Flynt, we have to see what drove them to hate him. He is
essentially protecting the entire magazine (as he does through the
movie) from censorship and libel, and not just the political
cartoons. It is his vision he wishes to protect.</P>
<P>Regardless of these significant oversights, "The People vs. Larry
Flynt" is director Milos Forman's finest film since Amadeus. He has
managed to bring a vivid, penetrating portrait of the most infamous
magazine publisher of the 20th century. His film biography is witty,
humanistic, honestly emotional, three-dimensional, acutely written,
and marvelously acted and directed. Forget "Michael Collins." Based on
the film and the renewed interest in this man, Larry Flynt is an
individual who will be talked about for decades.</P>
