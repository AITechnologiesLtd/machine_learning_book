<PRE>HIMALAYA
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>When it becomes a case of survival, who do you trust? Man or God? The 
wise old village elder or the strong young leader? In Eric Valli's 
exquisite HIMALAYA, the first Nepalese film ever to be nominated for an 
Academy Award, the villagers are faced with these simple but difficult 
questions.</P>
<P>As the story opens, the leader of the village's annual caravan has been 
killed in an accident so his head-strong father, Tinle (Thilen Lhondup), 
vows to lead the caravan instead.  (The English title of the film was 
once CARAVAN, which is much more descriptive.)  The aged Tinle seems to 
be in no shape to lead anything more than a trip to the well, but he 
insists that he can lead the caravan like he used to decades ago.  
First, however, he must consult the gods who will pick the best date to 
depart.  As he labors over various religious tables, it begins to appear 
that he will never find an auspicious date to begin the long journey 
through the mountains.</P>
<P>As Tinle deliberates for what seems an eternity, Karma (Gurgon Kyap), a 
young upstart, desperately wants to lead the yak herd off before the 
winter storms come.  It is dangerous to wait too long, he warns.  The 
village needs the salt, which they mine, traded for grain so that they 
will not starve during the long, harsh winter.  And, if the caravan 
waits too long, they will die in the deadly storms that grip the 
mountain passes.</P>
<P>Since Tinle doesn't trust Karma, he refuses to follow his lead.  The 
rift causes the village to break into two caravans, one run by Karma and 
the younger men and the other led by Tinle and the elders.  Their 
harrowing journey is visually astonishing.  That the cinematography of 
rich browns and golds is breathtaking is obvious from the first scene.  
What isn't immediately obvious is that the film will become much more 
than just a gorgeous travelogue.  The yaks, magnificent beasts of 
burden, become stars in their own right, but it is the human drama that 
captures our imagination.  As they cope with their own conflicts, the 
caravanners have to fight a much bigger battle against the mountain.  
The senior citizen contingent, especially, appears to be headed for 
certain disaster.  Maybe with some big Hollywood stars the film would 
seem a bit trite, but, with these honest, straightforward actors, the 
story is completely engrossing.  You won't care about winners, you'll 
just be rooting for both sides to survive.</P>
<P>HIMALAYA runs 1:44.  The film is Tibetan with English subtitles.  It is 
not rated but could be a G since there is nothing to offend anyone of 
any age.</P>
