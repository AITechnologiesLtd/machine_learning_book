<P>Yeah, yeah, the advertisements didn't even try to conceal the fact that this
movie had only one hook - sex. Neve Campbell and STARSHIP TROOPER's Denise
Richards getting it on? Ok! Yeah, it's a decent two minutes of film erotica,
but even if that's your main interest in this film, there's plenty of
cheeziness to sit thru in exchange for those two minutes.</P>
<P>WILD THINGS does have a lot more to think about than you might expect however.
Nearly every single scene is a huge plot twist guaranteed to leave you
guessing, or at least curious to see the next turn, throughout the entire
movie. But this fast-paced, razor-sharp turning of events doesn't leave much
time to enjoy the surprises. We start off in a high-class California high
school where every student resembles a supermodel in the making. Guidance
counselor Sam Lombardo (Matt Dillon) seems to catch the eye of every student,
particularly Kelly Van Ryan (Richards), daughter of the locally prestigious
family whose social status is about as high as their bank accounts. Right off
the bat, Kelly is using every asset she has in an effort to seduce "Mr.
Lombardo". The fund-raiser car wash seems the opportune time, particularly
when you wash your guidance counselor's jeep in all white clothes and take
plenty of precautions to insure you'll be soaked from head to toe when you're
done.</P>
<P>On the weekend of the car wash, Kelly's attempts at seduction fall flat, and
when they do, she concocts the tale that Sam in fact raped her that day.
Naturally Sam is thrown into a state of panicked shock at these accusations.
But the otherwise unsubstantial fabrications soon lead to a criminal trial
when a low-class, marijuana smoking student by the name of Suzie Toller
(Campbell) comes forth with a near identical story, also involving her trusted
guidance counselor. Pitting himself against the communities most respected
names and authoritarians, Sam must prove his innocence thru the aid of his
makeshift defense attorney, Ken Bowden, played by Bill Murray. Yes, that Bill
Murray!</P>
<P>Sound like a good, complete movie? Yes, that alone could have been, but this
is just the beginning. In fact, the trial is over about fifteen or twenty
minutes into the film. It is merely used to launch the most twisted story of
recent time. By the time the movie finishes, you will have gone thru every
plot twist imaginable. Unfortunately, with so much going on, you're not given
enough time in one predicament to be as effectively shocked when a new twist
comes about. This is just one way director John McNaughton fails to make this
movie as fun as it could've been. The 113 minutes fly by, and although it
never feels underdeveloped, this pretzel of storytelling could've been much
more richly realized had a slower pace been taken.</P>
<P>The acting is incredibly reminiscent of Fox prime-time soap operas, which no,
is not a good thing. And it's not just Campbell, who happens to hail from the
prime-time Fox soap "Party of Five", but everyone suffers from heavily
melodramatic overtones. Dillon, who was so charming in his understated role in
last year's IN & OUT, gives the best performance, and Murray's surprising
appearance adds some comedic flare to the film. In fact, if the whole movie
had been promoted as a subtle comedy, even if it was the exact same film, I
would actually give it a better grade. That's how cheezy it comes off. But
aside from these two, the rest offer nothing more than some good eye-full's.</P>
<P>In the right hands, WILD THINGS could've been a wickedly delightful,
scrumptiously twisted thriller, but instead we get juvenile overuses of
profanity and some very laughable displays of acting. And what's up with these
people passing as high school students? I realize Hollywood often casts older
actors to play teenage roles, but when I realized it wasn't supposed to be a
college they were at, I had to snicker. </P>
<P>I won't lie - this is definitely a guilty pleasure. As corny as it is, it's
got some interesting aspects and could deserve at least a "B" for effort. But
if you just want to admire Denise Richards, go for last year's STARSHIP
TROOPERS, which was every bit as campy, but a million times better. Of course,
if seeing her breasts is your most important goal, you'll be right at home
with WILD THINGS. Perhaps the wildest thing of all is that somebody actually
looked at this and thought it deserved to be in theaters.</P>
