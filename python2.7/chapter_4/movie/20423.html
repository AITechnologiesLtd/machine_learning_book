<PRE>THE ASTRONAUT'S WIFE
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        Something not of this world is gestating in Charlize Theron's
tummy, and methinks not-what-he-seems hubby Johnny Depp--who just returned
from deep space with a weird look on his face--is the responsible party.</P>
<P>        That's all you really need to know about "The Astronaut's Wife," a
silly and inconsequential little thriller about some icky alien space spawn
insinuating its way into the lives of two very attractive people, causing
them to re-evaluate their lives as human beings.  It begs the best bits of
the "Species" series and borrows the worst bits of the "Alien" series; in
between, there's some stuff worth watching and there's a lot of stuff that
isn't.</P>
<P>        If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the film.  In retrospect,
the trailer is actually more satisfying than the full-length feature, since
it gets to the point much more quickly and omits the dumbbell finale, which
to appreciate fully requires an understanding of electrical conductivity.</P>
<P>        Nevertheless, Depp and Theron have never looked so attractive on
screen, each sporting short-cropped blond hair and an endless wardrobe of
fancy duds.  So alike are our two leads that at times it's hard to tell
which one's the astronaut and which one's the wife.  But as we've learned
time and time again (the most recent example being "Eyes Wide Shut"),
good-looking performers do not a movie make.  Since Depp will soon co-star
with a headless horseman (Thanksgiving's "Sleepy Hollow") and Theron
recently shared top billing with a large gorilla (Disney's "Mighty Joe
Young"), the allure of going head-to-head with some yucky space issue must
have been irresistible.</P>
<P>        Joe Morton, typically so reliable, overdoes it as a government
shirt who cottons on to Depp's identity crisis following the two minutes
NASA lost contact with him.  An unrecognizable Samantha Eggar has a brief
scene as Theron's gynecologist.</P>
<P>        But perhaps the film's most bizarre moment occurs when Theron's
character, relieved that her husband's antique radio isn't blasting out
those secret alien transmissions, flips up her collar and goes into a
gratuitous salsa grind, heading for the refrigerator and downing the
Redi-Whip faster than you can scream "wanton product placement!"</P>
<P>        "The Astronaut's Wife" could have been a better movie had the
commitment Depp and Theron brought to the project been imitated by
writer/director Rand Ravich, whose uncreative screenplay can't decide
whether to be a horror show, plain and simple, or something deeper.  As it
is "The Astronaut's Wife" is predictable and uneventful, despite the
valiant attempts of its pretty players.</P>
