<P>1776. South Carolina. Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) is  the legendary "Hero of Fort Wilderness". He has portrayed his patriotism and courage in many a battle. Now he is retired from his dark past and spends his days with his children. But times are uncertain. In the north, lightning from the storm clouds of war against the Crown have already touched off brush fires. The Colonies are calling are searching for volunteers to join the regular army. A longing for freedom is in the air. The country mobilizes against the British in an attempt to gain independence. Ben's oldest son Gabriel (Heath Ledger), dreams of becoming a soldier and fight for freedom. His father's objections do not prevent him from leaving home and exchange his peaceful life for an uncertain and carnival everyday life on the battlefield. But the good spirits and the glorious patriotism slowly fade away when the fierce British armies occupy the States, proving the resistance to be helpless. Led by the incredibly ev!
il Col. Tavington (Jason Isaacs), the soldiers burn Ben's house and kill one of his sons, despite of the fact that Ben has been helping wounded Englishmen. In Ben this awakens a gruesome rage and hunger for revenge. He takes up arms along side his idealistic son, and leads the Militia into a battle of freedom. Soon many hear about the successful crusade, which awakens a spark of hope in the American souls... </P>
<P>Robert Rodat's ("Saving Private Ryan") script drags for all too long, making even the magnificent battles and Kirk M. Petruchelli's beautiful set design look tiring. Besides the fact that his story is not historically accurate, it is not structured in an even manner. There are some logical irrationalities along the way. There is no natural float or balance in the story line. The events progress either too fast or far too slowly. None of the characters represent anything besides their excessive patriotism. The love story feels as it has been inserted into the script along the way. There is no sensuality, emotions, meaning or realism in this relationship, which comes as unexpected as thunder from a clear sky.</P>
<P>With Mel Gibson's name on the marquee, comparisons with Braveheart are unavoidable. In fact, the role of Benjamin Martin appears to be an attempt to create "Braveheart 2" and find another William Wallace-like part for the high profile actor. Unfortunately, the script doesn't provide enough tension, fury and intelligence to be even compared to the likes of 'Braveheart'. Emirich's most successful picture "Independence Day" succeeds in being exactly what it is supposed to be -- a light popcorn-entertainment. 'The Patriot' does not, because Emerich aims higher than his capabilities. His film does not depict the important historic events with a sense of realism. Instead it glorifies them with magical images, terrible villains and noble heroes that risk their lives for a greater cause. In other words, Emerich turned the fight for freedom into MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE. You almost expect 007 or Godzilla to appear from the shadows.</P>
<P>As a historical film with a lot of modern action, 'The Patriot' challenges "Gladiator", but looses the duel immediately. Neither the plot, script or acting can measure up. And even its visual abilities, that are grand, with Caleb Deschanel's rich cinematography, and very decent costume design by Deborah Lynn Scott, can't quite measure up to Ridley Scott's epic. 'The Patriot's main fault is that it is too patriotic. It's too preachy with its simple symbolism and stereotypical melodrama. Every frame is drained in sticky patriotism, which makes it at times tough to bare. Picture this: Mel Gibson dodges bullets and runs right through the battlefield as soldiers die around him. As he nobly kills his virtually unstoppable and evil nemesis, his eyes turn to the sunset where his brave men are running with American flags towards the frightened Englishmen. All of this is of course accompanied by John Williams' loud and patriotic fanfare that rises above the screams of victory. And thus,!
 no matter how hard Gibson tries to recapture his golden moments of 'Braveheart' and no matter how honest Ledger delivers his lines, nothing can save this film from being a pompous cliché. It's big, it's beautiful, it's expensive, it's well acted, but it's not very convincing. Starting seriously and impressively, Emerich soon tiers and resorts to what he does best -- brainless, but occasionally entertaining popcorn films. 'The Patriot' has its moments. The beautiful shots of the sea and war galleons in the sunset and a couple of emotionally charging moments, such as when Ben teaches his sons to kill, but mostly it remains a pompous, unreal and seldom exciting celebration of the way to the America that we know today. Of course I could be disappointed, but what can we expect from the director of 'Godzilla'? </P>
