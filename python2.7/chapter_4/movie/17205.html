'Vampires'</PRE>
<PRE>by Simon Calloway</PRE>
<P>Cast: James Woods; Daniel Baldwin; Sheryl Lee</P>
<P> Vampires is one of the slickest vampire movies to come out of Hollywood is
quite some time.  In fact, I would even go as far to say it is one of the most
entertaining; it ranks right up there behind Interview With the Vampire (1994)
and the original masterpiece, Dracula (1931).</P>
<P> Not much in the plot department.  Basically the film tells the tale about main
vamp slayer Jack Crow (Woods) and his search for the all-mighty master who is,
also, on a search of his own: To locate a cross that can give him the power to
walk in the sunlight.  In this pic, the vampires aren't scared of crosses,
don't sleep in caskets, don't mind garlic, etc.  I was a little disappointed
about all that stuff.  I like the old fashion sense of when vampires slept in
coffins.</P>
<P> The amount of gore in this film is surprisingly high.  From the director of
such classics as Halloween (1978) and The Thing (1983), I knew the film would
be violent, yet the level of blood is ominously higher than usual, like
Carpenter was hiding plot holes with carnage, something that he has never done.
 Halloween was actually filmed vise versa, with suspense and atmosphere
frightening instead of gory violence.</P>
<P> Based on the novel 'Vampire$,' Vampires is a stylishly made, high-octane
thriller, but, undoubtably a little disappointing.  Instead of all that
crimson, maybe Carpenter should have made the master a little like Michael
Myers, all silent, never really seen til the last reel, pounces in sudden
frames.  Overall, Vampires lacks a certain bite, but is nonetheless gruesome
fun.</P>
