<P>Himalaya sounds a lot like something you'd find at your local IMAX theatre.
For starters, it's full of stunning panoramic shots that can't help but
overshadow an inferior plot.  The film tells the story of a young boy (kids
are an IMAX staple) on track to become Chief of his Nepalese village, which
means audiences will be treated to magnificent views of snow-covered
mountains that practically dare people to cross them.</P>
<P>Anyone familiar with Iranian cinema will notice similarities between
Himalaya (an awfully fun word to type) and that country's recent critical
hit A Time For Drunken Horses - this could have been called A Time For
Teetotaling Yaks.  Both films deal with impoverished villages whose survival
depends on caravans that wind through the dangerous mountains. While Horses'
characters smuggled contraband into Iraq, the people in Himalaya haul packs
of salt hundreds of miles away to exchange for grain that will keep their
tribes eating throughout the harsh winter months.</P>
<P>As Himalaya opens, the salt caravan has just returned to town.  One might
think this would be a time for celebration, like when the fishing boats came
home to Gloucester at the beginning of The Perfect Storm, but this time the
convoy has returned with the remains of their Chief in a burlap sack.
Lhakpa, we are told by his close friend and caravaneer Karma (Gurgon Kyap),
died trying to follow a risky path.  Lhakpa's elderly father Tinle (Thilen
Lhondup) doesn't believe Karma, suspecting he may have done something
devious to assume his place in the community.</P>
<P>A power struggle ensues, with most of the villagers in favor of Karma taking
over, but Tinle thinks the gig should remain in his lineage (he was the
Chief before Lhakpa).  The only problem is that the family's next male heir
is little boy named Tsering (Karma Wangel), who isn't nearly ready to man a
salt caravan through mountains big enough to make Lance Armstrong burst into
tears.</P>
<P>But that's not enough to stop crotchety old Tinle, who comes off as a
taller, Far East version of Cotton from King of the Hill (he even has a few
"I've been blah-blah-blah-ing since before you were born!" lines).  Tinle
hauls his other son, Norbou (Karma Tensing), out of the monastery he was
forced into as a boy and starts his own damn caravan (another fun word to
type) with a few of the village elders, his grandson and his widowed
daughter-in-law (Lhakpa Tsamchoe).</P>
<P>What follows is probably the closest thing we'll ever see to a Nepalese
road-trip flick, as the two separate caravans (Karma's and Tinle's) embark
on the salt-for-grain journey. There's one dicey scene where Tinle's crew
tries to cross a very narrow mountain path, but filming it was probably a
hundred times more precarious than it appeared on screen.  Not only are
there no stunt doubles in Himalaya, there aren't any professional actors,
either.  The faces weathered by the elements that you see on the screen
really have to lug salt through the mountains to exchange for grain.</P>
<P>Some folks might complain about the lack of character development, but since
Himalaya is populated by non-actors, beefing up their parts isn't going to
be a positive thing.  It'd be one thing if the picture starred Brad, Julia,
Haley Joel and Robert (as in Redford - his craggy puss would have been
perfect), but the story here is kept pleasantly simple.  It's almost a
fable - old customs (like using astronomy to tell you when to start the
caravan) butting heads with modern thinking (like using medicine over
hocus-pocus stuff).  But not too modern, mind you.  The only major problem
with Himalaya is that there isn't supposed to be a clear-cut protagonist,
yet it's hard not to root for Karma over the gratingly unpleasant Tinle.</P>
<P>Himalaya, which won César Awards for its score (Bruno Coulais) and
cinematography (Eric Guichard), was Nepal's first-ever submission to the
Academy Awards Best Foreign Language Film category in 1999 (it was actually
nominated, too, but lost to Spain's All About My Mother).  The picture was
directed by Eric Valli, a National Geographic photographer who, for the last
20 years, has lived in the same remote Dolpo region of Nepal in which
Himalaya is set (he was also a unit director for Seven Years in Tibet).  The
uncomplicated screenplay took four writers to tackle (one of whom,
ironically, was a scribe on fellow 1999 Foreign Film nominee East-West).</P>
