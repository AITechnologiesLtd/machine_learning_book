Double Jeopardy (1999)
a review by Christian Pyle</PRE>
<P>Libby Parsons (Ashley Judd) has the perfect little life -- a rich husband, a
cute son, and a house on the ocean -- but when her husband Nick (Bruce
Greenwood) takes her sailing, she awakes to find him gone and her hands covered
with blood.  Just as she makes it to the deck and picks up the bloody knife
lying there, the Coast Guard arrives in response to a distress call her
vanished husband sent.  She's convicted of his murder, of course, and leaves
her son Matty (Benjamin Weir) with her best friend (Annabeth Gish).  Time
passes, and the friend disappears with Matty.  During their last phone
conversation Libby hears Matty yell "Daddy!" and realizes that her husband is
still alive.</P>
<P>Libby serves six years, growing harder and driven by the desire to kill Nick
(based on the theory that because of the "double jeopardy" amendment she can
off him with impunity).  When she gets parole, she's sent to a halfway house
run by Travis Lehman (Tommy Lee Jones), a former law professor who ruined his
life with a drunk driving accident.  After a little breaking and entering and
some destruction of property, Libby jumps parole and lams it across the country
looking for Nick and Matty.  Travis pursues, naturally.</P>
<P>"Double Jeopardy" is a watered-down version of "The Fugitive," with Jones
sleep-walking through his well-worn pursuer persona.  Although Libby never
leaps from a bus that collides with a train, she manages to get into a few
nail-biters -- chased down the beach by a jeep, chained to a car that plunges
into the ocean, sealed in a coffin -- that add some much needed thrills to an
anemic, slow-moving script.  </P>
<P>Character development is thin.  Travis' intriguing backstory is mentioned a
couple times but has no effect on the story.  (I think they only made him a
former law professor so that he could verify the double-jeopardy theory when
Libby gets the drop on Nick.  It's a long way to go for one line).  There's
considerable sexual tension between Travis and Libby (hey, there's something
"The Fugitive" didn't have!), but it never goes anywhere.  Libby is a TV-movie
Everywoman, but Judd's intense performance draws us in and makes us forget 
that her character has no distinguishing characteristics.  This is Judd's most
prominent role to date, and she proves that she can light up the screen.  Let's
hope Hollywood gives her more to work with next time around.</P>
<P>The quality of director Bruce Beresford's movies seems to depend on luck.  When
he has a good script and a strong cast, he turns out Oscar-caliber work like
"'Breaker' Morant," "Driving Miss Daisy," and "Tender Mercies."  When he
doesn't . . . we get "Double Jeopardy."  Screenwriters David Weisberg and
Douglas Cook previously collaborated on "The Rock," a script which probably
benefited from the numerous uncredited rewrites.</P>
<P>Bottom Line:  Ashley Judd tries hard but can't save this predictable bore.</P>
