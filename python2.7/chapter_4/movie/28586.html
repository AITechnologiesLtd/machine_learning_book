<PRE>DIE HARD 2
A film review by Jeremiah Kipp
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Die Hard had it all: a sympathetic hero, a wonderfully serpentine
villain, kick-ass fight scenes and shootouts (which are really hard to
make entertaining, in the glut of routine action flicks that overflow
our video racks), an enjoyably quirky supporting cast of character
actors, and dialogue you could really sink your teeth into.  ("I wanted
this to be professional.  Efficient, adroit, cooperative, not a lot to
ask.  Alas, your Mr. Takagi did not see it that way, so he won't be
joining us for the rest of his life.")  This flick was so pervasive, we
had to endure a slew of rip-offs: Die Hard at sea, Die Hard on an ocean
liner, Die Hard in a friggin' library!  OK, so they never did one in a
library, but that would be pretty funny, wouldn't it?  [Indeed they did
do it in a library: Masterminds.  -Ed.]</P>
<P>What a pity that Die Hard 2: Die Harder (based on the novel 58 Minutes)
falls into the trap of being just another Die Hard in Washington's
Dulles Airport.  I mean, it's kinda funny that John McClane (Bruce
Willis, having a good ol' time) acknowledges his pathetic luck.  Not
this shit again!  He's waiting for his wife's plane to land when
terrorists seize control of the airport, crashing a plane just to prove
that they'll stop at nothing.  Yes, they will stop at nothing!  Insert
an evil laugh here, and throw in a moustache twirl, why dontcha?</P>
<P>Bruce Willis is not to blame.  There are plenty of other movies he
destroyed with his monstrous ego, but I've always been fond of his blue
collar cop that takes a licking but keeps on ticking.  The biggest
problem is the lack of any memorable bad guys.  William Sadler plays a
sneaky Oliver North buckaroo presiding over a team of faceless
assassins, and Franco Nero is the South American dictator they're gonna
extradite (or something.)  They lack the personality of Alan Rickman's
sinister and silky Hans Gruber, who did not so much speak his lines as
purrrrr them.  They also lack the balletic grace of Alexander Godunov as
Rickman's trusty, ferocious kickboxing psycho-killer right-hand-man.  
Come to think of it, they're lacking in almost every way.  Were they
even in the movie?</P>
<P>No matter.  A good action scene could make it all palatable.  Ha!  Too
much to ask.  A lot of people get shot and many punches are thrown, but
there are zero memorable setpieces.  OK, so we all remember the scene
where Willis takes flight in the exploding chair, but it wasn't a
particularly effective special effect.  It calls attention to itself too
much.  LOOK AT ME!  I much preferred Willis hanging from the skyscraper
hanging on to a fire hose for dear life -- now that was a scene.  (Not
in this movie, though!  Director Renny Harlin is nothing but a well paid
hack.)  I was so bored throughout Die Hard 2, I started evaluating the
squib shots: Yes, that one looked realistic.  Hmm, that one was
extra-bloody.  Wow -- the blood looks just like ketchup in this scene.</P>
<P>Many of the original Die Hard cast members are back for round two,
though none of them are particularly well used.  Bonnie Bedelia frets
and pouts as Mrs. McClane, William Atherton has entirely too much screen
time as obnoxious reporter Dick Thornburg, and Reginald VelJohnson is
given a pointless cameo as donut muchin' Detective Al Powell.  New faces
fare better, including NYPD Blue regular Dennis Franz as, what else, an
obnoxious cop, and John Amos as a soft-spoken major (sent in to help
John McClane) who may have an ace up his sleeve.</P>
<P>There is exactly one good scene in Die Hard 2. (OK, there's some
adequate stuff, but really only one bona fide good moment.)  Poor John
McClane is forced to climb through another ventilation system.  Poor
bastard.  At least he's in on the joke.  "Just once, I'd like a regular,
normal Christmas.  A little eggnog, a fuckin' Christmas tree, a little
turkey.  But, no!  I gotta crawl around in this motherfuckin' tin can!"</P>
