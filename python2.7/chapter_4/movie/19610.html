Capsule Review, July 27, 1999.</PRE>
<P>The original 1997 film, "Shiloh," was a small family movie that went 
undetected in theaters but became a hit on video and was praised by several 
notable critics. It remains unseen by me, and after viewing the 
well-intentioned, but painfully sappy sequel, "Shiloh 2: Shiloh Season," it 
probably will remain just that way: unseen. Practically a carbon-copy of most 
other "dog" movies, the film tells the story of 12-year-old Marty (Zachary 
Browne), who loves his faithful dog, Shiloh, just about as much as anyone 
could love a pet, but he finds their happiness put in jeopardy when the 
alcoholic, bitter Judd (Scott Wilson), Shiloh's abusive former owner, demands 
for him back. "Shiloh 2" may be acceptable for undiscriminating young 
viewers, and is certainly a few steps up from the awful "Inspector Gadget," 
but the movie has not an ounce of originality and mostly plays like a corny 
episode of the old television show, "Lassie." If only families were as 
perfect and happy as the one shown in this film, the world would be a better 
place, indeed.</P>
