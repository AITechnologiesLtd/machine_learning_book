DOOM GENERATION, THE (director/writer/editor: Gregg Araki;
cinematographer: Jim Fealy; cast: James Duval (Jordan White ), Rose
McGowan (Amy Blue), Johnathon Schaech (Xavier Red), Cress Williams
(Peanut), Parker Posey (Brandi), Heidi Fleiss (Herself), Margaret Cho
(Clerk's wife), 1995)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Gregg Araki (The Living End/Totally F***ed Up) professes in the opening
credits that this is a movie about heterosexuals, as opposed to his
other films about queers. But that is really a dubious distinction, as
the sex is mindless, violent, and bawdry. Many of the visuals displayed
homo-erotic actions, and the film is about as romantic as a stool
sample.</P>
<P>This is a road movie about three Los Angeles misfits: a teenage druggie
couple, the wiseacre Amy (Rose) and the dim-witted Jordan (Duval), who
take a violent drifter, Xavier (Schaech), along with them for a ride
into teenage hell. It is an offensive film, made to parody other
Hollywood teenager films, by taking digs at do-gooders, the moral
majority, the right-wing, the fundamentalist religions, and pop culture.
But the film is so vacuous and poorly thought out, that it comes off as
strictly an in-your-face stylized film, without coming up to breathe
fresh air or manage to say anything worthwhile. The parody seems so cold
and distant, and it comes from lowlifes who have peanuts for brains,
which makes their attempts at black comedy seem futile. It was difficult
to be amused by a film that was so childish, its dialogue so banal, and
its whole purpose tied to being shocking.</P>
<P>The enjoyment from the film, for those who get their jollies from
watching something that is this gross and sexually hideous, is the
flaunting of morality and the depravity in the violence. Xavier explains
his tattoo of Jesus on his dick, by telling Amy, he put it there, so
people could say, I've got Jesus inside me. The three form a menage a
trois, with Xavier
bringing new insights to sex, by having Amy stick her finger up his
shithole, which she then gleefully gets the drugged out Jordan to
experience.</P>
<P>The first heavy action scene opens inside a fast-food emporium, where
Amy and Jordan are facing the Korean proprietor's shotgun when they
don't have the $6.66 to pay their food tab. Xavier comes along, wrestles
with the gunman and blasts his head off in the tussle. Besides spewing
out green slime and still talking, the severed head rolls on the floor.
The owner's wife (Margaret Cho) in a suicidal ritual, disembowels her
children and commits suicide.</P>
<P>On-the-run, the three are wanted by the police, but are oblivious of any
sense of guilt or awareness of that they are doing. There is a running
gag about 666 and about religious or do-gooder slogans in every store;
one store has this slogan --Up with hope -- Down with dope.</P>
<P>The film has a running theme, that everytime the trio stops at a
fast-food place, someone recognizes Amy as someone who broke their heart
and swear to get even with her unless she comes with them. It ends up
that every stop they make, ends up in a homicide. I guess this is
supposed to mean that these three have bad karma.</P>
<P>After seeing all the mayhem, absorbing the teens in action, watching how
retarded and alienated they are, the film felt as healthy as a diet of
fast-food, crystal meth (speed), and shotguns. It failed to show the
L.A. underground kids it made as stars of the film, as anything but
cartoon characters. In some perverse way, I would recommend this as a
blind date movie in a drive-in, for those young guys who want to see how
their dates will react to all the grossness onscreen. For others, who
might be taken with teenager films, but in a healthier and more comical
way, stick with someone committed to making bad films about teens, such
as Ray Steckler. All his flicks are funnier than this one. His Wild
Guitar (62) is a classic in schlock art.</P>
