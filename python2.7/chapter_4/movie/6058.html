<P>     A number of words come to mind when considering Walter Hill's 
latest directorial effort, LAST MAN STANDING.  One is violent.  Another 
is excessive.  A third is unnecessary.  This exceptionally bloody film 
probably features more gunshots than all of Bruce Willis' DIE HARD 
movies put together.  The atmosphere is so thick and pointlessly "artsy" 
that it threatens to choke the viewer.  And, since this story has 
already been filmed twice before, in much better versions (Akira 
Kurosawa's 1961 YOJIMBO and Sergio Leone's 1964 A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS), 
the audience is left wondering why Hollywood felt the need to do it 
again.</P>
<P>     The basic idea of LAST MAN STANDING is to transfer the samurai 
sword epic YOJIMBO from Japan in the 1860s to a small United States town 
in the Old West.  However, since that's exactly what A FISTFUL OF 
DOLLARS did, the film makers felt compelled to add a prohibition-era 
flavor to the mix.  The result is a bizarre mixture of western and 
gangster genres that doesn't really work.  Tommy guns and tumbleweeds 
don't make for a perfect marriage, and the site of Bruce Willis, dressed 
in a crisp suit and fedora, striding through a dust storm towards the 
local saloon causes us to wonder if the costume and set designers didn't 
get their wires crossed.  </P>
<P>     Willis is "John Smith", The Man With No Name who has previously 
been essayed by Toshiro Mifune and Clint Eastwood.  And, whatever other 
problems LAST MAN STANDING may exhibit, the lead actor's performance 
isn't among them.  Laconic, tight-lipped (except during an irritatingly 
unnecessary dime-store novel voiceover), and grim-faced, Willis is right 
for the part.  Smith is a mercenary and a mystery, and Willis keeps us 
curious about his history and what he plans to do next. </P>
<P>     Smith arrives in Jericho, Texas (population: 57) on a hot, windy 
afternoon at the height of the prohibition era.  The town is controlled 
by two gangs with their roots in Chicago (the question of why Chicago 
gangs would war over run-down Jericho is never satisfactorily 
explained):  the Irish, led by Doyle (David Patrick Kelly), and the 
Italians, run by Strozzi (Ned Eisenberg).  Smith's car undergoes some 
heavy damage when he is caught looking the wrong way at Doyle's girl, 
Felina (Karina Lombard).  This pulls Smith into Jericho's unstable 
political situation.  He learns that the sheriff, Ed Galt (Bruce Dern), 
is a crook, and there's not much difference between Doyle and Strozzi, 
except that Doyle has a sadistic henchman named Hickey (Christopher 
Walken) who kills for the sheer joy of it.  Soon Smith, looking to make 
as much money as he can, is playing both ends against the middle, and is 
always one step away ahead of death.</P>
<P>     Hill goes way overboard with atmosphere, incorporating elements of 
everything from traditional western and gangster motifs to film noir 
cliches.  Almost every outdoor scene features a dust storm and every 
indoor sequence is heavily shadowed.  At times, the blowing dust bleeds 
out color, leaving us with shots that appear to be almost black-and-
white.  It's a clever conceit, but totally superfluous.  Atmosphere is 
supposed to be a background element, but Hill forces it into the 
foreground, as if attempting to overcompensate for structural and 
plausibility problems in his script.  Then there's Ry Cooder's hard rock 
score, which seems vastly out of place for this sort of period piece.</P>
<P>     Over-the-top, cartoonish violence is a big part of LAST MAN 
STANDING.  The body count is way up there, and there's one instance when 
it takes approximately forty bullets to kill one man.  Hill is not Sam 
Peckinpah, however, and, as a result, much of the bloodshed comes across 
as gratuitous rather than stylized.  Sure, there are a lot of people we 
want to see killed, but this sort of wholesale carnage is more 
repetitious than satisfying.</P>
<P>     Aside from Willis, the best acting job is turned in by Bruce Dern 
as the pragmatic, crooked sheriff of Jericho.  Christopher Walken is at 
his maniacal best as Hickey, although, at this point in his career, I'm 
beginning to wonder if he can play anything other than a psycho.  Most 
of the rest of the cast, including Karina Lombard (WIDE SARGASSO SEA), 
is unimpressive at best.  Worse, the secondary characters are a poorly-
developed lot, with motives that vary from incomprehensible to merely 
unexplained.  </P>
<P>     As a shallow tale of conscienceless bloodshed and revenge, LAST MAN 
STANDING is reasonably effective.  But as an updated version of the far 
better-realized YOJIMBO, it's an unqualified failure.  LAST MAN STANDING 
is a surface picture -- it looks good, sounds good, and moves quickly -- 
but there's no depth whatsoever.  In the past, Walter Hill has done some 
great work (SOUTHERN COMFORT, 48 HOURS) and some less-than-great work 
(GERONIMO).  LAST MAN STANDING falls closer to the latter category than 
the former.</P>
