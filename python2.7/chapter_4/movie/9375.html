<PRE>                    I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>     Julie James is home for the summer.  Looking pale and withdrawn,
her mother suspects the worst -- she's on drugs.  Actually, that isn't
even close to the worst.  The reality is much more horrific.</P>
<P>     It was the previous summer that her troubles begin.  Julie, played
by Jennifer Love Hewitt, spent the last Independence Day at the beach
on a double date.  Hers is the only performance in I KNOW WHAT YOU DID
LAST SUMMER with any depth.</P>
<P>     Around the campfire that ill-fated night with Julie were her
boyfriend and soon to be fisherman Ray Bronson (Freddie Prinze Jr.),
her girlfriend and just crowned beauty queen Helen Shivers (Sarah
Michelle Gellar), and Helen's boyfriend and cocky jock Barry Cox (Ryan
Philippe).  In a scene lifted straight out of SCREAM -- they share the
same screenwriter, Kevin Williamson -- the kids try to out-scare each
other with diabolical stories.  To their credit, their story telling
has more intensity that the movie itself.  It is in this sequence that
the four actors come most alive.  In the rest of the film their parts
are relegated to caricature.</P>
<P>     With Barry soused, Ray drives his car back that fatal night.  On
the road, they run over someone and then have the bad sense to push his
not quite dead body into the ocean.  Max (Johnny Galecki), whom they
had snubbed earlier, drives by soon after the accident and may or may
not have seen anything.</P>
<P>     The show then advances to the following summer, when someone
dressed in a fisherman's slicker begins sending the four teenagers "I
Know What You Did Last Summer" notes and begins injuring and killing
people.</P>
<P>     The story alternates between a traditional slasher film and a
whodunit.  The suspects include one of the teenagers themselves, their
friends, and Max as well as a creepy Anne Heche as the victim's sister.
Any of them, or someone out of the blue, could be the murderer.</P>
<P>     John Debney's heavy music overwhelms every scene with reminders to
be frightened.  The writer, seeming to lack confidence in his material,
prefaces every attack by the mysterious mad slicker with ample
notification of his arrival on the scene.  A few more surprises would
have been welcome in this putative horror show.</P>
<P>     The very last scene of the film, although the most predictable,
manages to be the scariest.  The only other frightening sequence in the
story involves a person tapping on a car window and thereby startling
the car's occupants and the audience.  Although a handsome film, thanks
to Denis Crossan's cinematography, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER is a
goose-bumps-free horror show with little fresh material and nothing to
recommend its viewing.</P>
<P>     I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER runs 1:40.  It is rated R for
profanity and gory violence including people being gutted with a hook.
The show would be fine for teenagers used to such horror pictures.  I
give this one thumbs down and * 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
