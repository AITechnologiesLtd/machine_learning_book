<PRE>                        Armadeddon (12) - UK Review</PRE>
<P>Following in the footsteps of Deep Impact, Armageddon is a high octane
action story about a huge asteroid on a collision course with earth.
A plan is devised to drill nuclear bombs into it's core and then
remotely detonate them to destroy it.  A team of the best oil drillers
is formed (led by Bruce Willis) and trained for spaceflight, all in
twelve days.  The team are essentially a bunch of society outcasts or
misfits but this doesn't deter NASA from sending them up.  This motley
crew, believe it or not are mankind's only hope.</P>
<P>Armageddon does not hang about in any way.  Dizzying and spectacular
action scenes bombard you right from the start.  The opening scene of
a meteor shower wrecking buildings and streets is something else.  In
true Bruckheimer fashion, this film is a pyromaniac's dream.</P>
<P>The acting all round is very good.  Bruce Willis gives his very usual
but very watchable performance and Steve Buscemi has all the best
lines and provides some top comic relief.</P>
<P>However, on the downside, Armageddon is let down by being completely
ludicrous.  Deep sea oil drillers/social misfits become astronauts?
Yeah, right.  As you may have gathered, switching off the brain before
you go into the theater will enhance your enjoyment a great deal as
there are many scenes that are just too daft for words.  Also it's
very, very cheesy and some of us brits may find the over the top,
patriotic ending hard to swallow.</P>
<P>Putting these criticisms aside, Armageddon still manages to be a
thrilling film.  The Bruckheimer formula of terrific action
accompanied by pulse racing music should certainly win you over. To
sum up, I felt Armageddon to be very similar to Independence Day.
Utter cobblers but very thrilling cobblers.</P>
