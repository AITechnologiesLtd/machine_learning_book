<P>Susan Granger's review of "CELEBRITY" (Miramax Films)</P>
<P>Woody Allen examines the phenomenon of "celebrity" in some of
its most ridiculous incarnations in this thoroughly entertaining,
black-and-white, contemporary comedy set in New York City. Kenneth
Branagh plays his alter ego, a free-lance writer whose neurotic
ambitions lead him to divorce his high-strung wife, a school teacher
(Judy Davis), and into the wobbly orbit of superstars like prancing
movie queen Melanie Griffith, imperious model Charlize Theron, and
teen idol Leonardo DiCaprio, who was cast even before he made such a
big hit in "Titanic."  "All you writers are so sensitive," DiCaprio
whines when Branagh hedges about joining him in some drug-laden
debauchery. Famke Janssen is a svelte book editor, and Winona Ryder
does a turn as an ambitious waitress/actress. While Branagh blathers
about the current "Age of Psychiatry," where people have become so
civilized that a new barbarity has developed from their
pseudo-sophistication, his ex-wife flees to a religious retreat where
a TV-star priest signs autographs, learns about oral sex from a
prostitute (Bebe Newirth), and visits a plastic surgeon (Michael
Lerner) known as "the Michaelangelo of Manhattan."  And she delivers
Allen's signature line for the film: "You can tell a lot about a
society by who it chooses to celebrate." Obviously, Woody Allen is
satirizing Andy Warhol's "15 minutes of fame" which is now accorded to
hostages, criminals, and the unlikely oddballs who catch our fancy,
revealing a society with no firm guideposts, either moral or
traditional. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Celebrity" is an
acerbic, cynical 7, ridiculing the "discreet charm" of the auteurs and
poseurs, the so-called cultural elite.</P>
