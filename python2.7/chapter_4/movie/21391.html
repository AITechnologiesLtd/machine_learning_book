<PRE>"The Thomas Crown Affair" Review
by Fontaine Lien
WARNING: CONTAINS PERTINENT PLOT INFO</PRE>
<P>Okay, I admit.  I had high expectations.  My friend Jody saw it twice
already, and she said she'd see it with me again, and not just because
of Pierce Brosnan's most excellent behind.  I was disappointed (geez,
that just seems to be my way of life lately after "Star Wars Episode
I: The Phantom Menace" and "Blair Witch Project"), but I'm happy to
say not overly so.  I was only bored for a few minutes, and I thought
Rene Russo's breasts showed up on screen just a *tad* too often.</P>
<P>Another problem I had was with Pierce Brosnan's Thomas Crown.  Sure,
he's rich, suave, handsome, intelligent, and whatnot (heck, I think
Mr.  Crown the finance geek secretly fantasizes about being James
Bond), but I'd like to see more of his motives.  Sure, there was
foreshadowing: he'd take on a bet of 100,000 dollars without so much
as a batting an eyelash; he'd ruin a boat just for thrills.  But when
I ask myself why on earth a millionaire like him would go to such
lengths to steal a painting only to return it, I can't come up with a
satisfactory answer.  Other than creative license.  I probably would
have enjoyed Crown's slick maneuvers a lot more if that one thought
hadn't kept bugging me.</P>
<P>I also how he could've fallen in love with a woman like Catherine
Banning (played by Rene "I'm forty but I've still got a nice body"
Russo) so quickly.  I mean it's not like it's a case of opposites
attract.  It didn't feel right.  Banning seemed just a little too
smug, just a little too self-assured.  I suppose Russo's nose had
something to do with that impression, but who am I to judge on
someone's appearance?  I didn't like it and I can't come up with a
legitimate reason why.  However I did like how Russo gradually showed
us the fragile feminine Banning under the tough act she puts up.  When
Crown "returns" the painting to the museum, we see some priceless
moments in the surveillance room as Banning tries to hide joy then
disappointment at Crown's escape.</P>
<P>"The Thomas Crown Affair" was like a sightseeing tour of the New York
area with our brilliant and attractive fourty-something stars.  The
scenery and cinematography were just breathtaking, and the score added
a lot of class.  It's tempting to label the film as all style and no
substance, because there *is* too much socializing and contrived
romance and too little action, but when one thinks about it: Well, the
word "affair" *does* have two meanings.  I'm just glad that our two
lovebirds stayed in love (proving that, hey, even rich spoiled bored
people can find true love) and we all found a tiny moral lesson (as
Dennis Leary's Michael did) along the way.</P>
