<P>   Our elementary school teachers tell us that we should
never lie.  They point to George Washington, who, admitting
that he chopped down the cherry tree, was not punished
because he told the truth.  What's more, criminals who
confess are let off with lighter sentences, as are those who
snitch on their associates.  We must never lie.</P>
<P>   Nonsense, of course.  Look at all the trouble Fletcher
Reede (Jim Carrey) got into in "Liar, Liar," in one case
securing a punch in the nose by an endowed woman in an
elevator for telling her the truth about her anatomy, and about
to lose every client he defends in court by being the only
honest lawyer in town!  Someone once said that if everyone
told the truth, there would not be two friends left in the whole
world.</P>
<P>   Which brings us to "The Chambermaid on the Titanic." 
This French-Italian-Spanish coproduction is not about to
compete with the blockbuster movie starring Leo DiCaprio,
nor is it primarily a bedroom farce, sentimental comedy, or
gritty, neo-realist view of the lives of working-class men in a
French foundry.  It is, more accurately, an ode to lying. 
Without the ability to lie at great length, we would have no
theater, no novels, no movies; in short, not a heck of a lot to
live for.  Or so believes Bigas Luna, who directed and co-
wrote this clever work which he divides skillfully into four
parts, using a different photographic look for each segment. 
Even in our own age of mass media and the all-
encompassing power of television, we still love to hear a
story, and sometimes we gather round a very good
prevaricator who will weave a tale of adventure or romance,
riveting us simply with the power of his voice and the energy
of his narrative.  </P>
<P>   Such a man is Horty (Olivier Martinez), a handsome,
popular, somewhat shy worker who wins an annual contest
sponsored by his company's president Simeon (Didier
Bezace).  By beating the competition in a race, he is given
just one ticket that will transport him by rail to Southampton
where he will stay in a luxury hotel and then watch the sailing
of the Titanic.  But he must leave his wife Zoe (Romane
Bohringer) behind--which is part of the boss's plan to seduce
her while her man is away.  In the posh hotel, he is visited
late at night by a beautiful woman, Marie (Aitana Sanchez
Gijon), who claims to be a chambermaid on the Titanic, but
one who is somehow left without a place to stay that night. 
Offering to share his own quarters with the lovely creature,
Horty sleeps with her--literally!--and, loyal to his wife back
home, gets to touch the fair roommate only in his dreams. 
When he returns, he is told that his wife had a brief affair with
the company president and, resentful and furious at the
thought, he weaves a long, almost totally false story of his
sexual escapades, riveting his friends in the local bar.  Hired
by the majordomo of a traveling theater, Zeppe (Aldo
Maccione), he eventually captivates increasingly large
audiences with variations on the theme, even affording his
wife a part in the daily drama.</P>
<P>   We learn in theater history class that at first there was the
story; then a single actor to relate the tale; then a second
actor to dialogue with the storyteller; eventually a third, an
increasingly elaborate set and costume design and
instrumental music.  "The Chambermaid on the Titanic" is a
well-realized microcosm of this three-thousand year chronicle,
told economically in just ninety-six minutes, putting the
principal performers to fine use.  Aitana Sanchez Gijon, whom
we all know from her role opposite Keanu Reeves in "A Walk
in the Clouds," is radiant as a woman who turns out to be
other than she represents; Olivier Martinez an engaging
storyteller who is so proficient at what he does that his final
episode fools everyone in the movie audience; and Romane
Bohringer a competent model of a typical wife of a hard-
working industrial laborer in the France of 1915.</P>
<P>   Walter Caprara and Bruno Cesari's production design looks
authentic down to the iron maiden used to transport Horty to
England, and France Squarciapino's costume design was
vigorous enough to win an award in that category.  In an
interview with the director, Bigas Luna expressed his fear that
the mass media are drowning the tradition of storytelling, and
acknowledges his use of the Titanic to symbolize the gradual
sinking of the ancient tradition.  Perhaps the great irony of the
story is that it took a well-designed movie to project this
anxiety and to rejuvenate the teller of lies on his appropriate
pedestal. Not Rated.  Running time: 96 minutes.  (C) Harvey
