<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Former Hal Hartley actress Adrienne Shelly directs her second feature, a
low budget indie about a blind date gone bad. It's a romantic comedy
which manages to show a lot of grief over the loss of a loved one.
There's no Bill Pullman in this film so Pullman clone, Reg Rogers, plays
the main role of the dumped husband.</P>
<P>Bill's (Rogers) sister Lucy (director Shelly) comes over to his
apartment, gives him a self-help book called "Get Up and Recover," dumps
on his ex-wife Rose (Harris), and forces him to go out on a blind date
with her college girlfriend from eight years ago, Bernice (Sheedy)...who
shows up at his door just as she finished telling him about the date.
This will turn out to be a shrill role for Sheedy, who never seems like
a real person.</P>
<P>Bernice talks a mile a minute and the disinterested sad sack Bill
finally gets a word in and nastily tells her "You're ordinary and
pathetic." He goes on to tell her that she's not a free person, but a
slave to fashion and materialism. She will be severely hurt by his
remarks and will later stalk him as he comes out of a pawn shop, having
purchased upon the owner's insistence a 1873 Pinkerton detective gun.
Bernice takes him in her vintage purple Mercury back to his place and
acts the part of an enraged psycho. She finds his new gun and threatens
him if he doesn't first take her to see her grandma, who lives in the
same part of the country where his ex-wife Rose now lives -- which is a
4-hour drive from NYC. On the way, she goes into a boutique and robs a
bunch of dresses, saying she wants to be dressed up when she sees her
dying granny (this was just a dumb scene, without any point to be made).</P>
<P>At the overbearing and crusty granny Stella's (Drummond) upstate house
they are greeted by her genial lover Max (North), someone Bernice didn't
know about. The old couple act as cheerleaders for the young depressed
ones. The foursome talk about romance, about the tuba, about roses
without thorns, and about how the song 'Bill Bailey, won't you please
come home' was written by a friend of Bailey's, who tried to cheer him
up after his wife left him for another. I found this scene to be
particularly dull and wondered why it was so scripted that Bernice had
to be told her granny had a lover by Max and wouldn't have already have
known about it, that is if she was such a caring grandchild as the film
wanted her to be portrayed as.</P>
<P>This supposedly unconventional tale (it really follows the old Hollywood
formulaic code of the lover coming to terms with his inner angst and
changing) comes to a head when Bill goes to grovel at Rose's feet and
her new boyfriend Ray (Pyper-Ferguson) interferes when Bill makes a
scene. Bill, in his real-estate agent job, sold this country house to
Ray.</P>
<P>The film's quirky resolution comes at the point of a gun or two. It
makes some point about getting to know the one you fall in love with.</P>
<P>Since I didn't find much comedy here (only a lot of silliness) and
wasn't taken in with the characters or their troubles, I merely went
along for the bumpy ride and tried not to wince too much at the forced
comedy situations. This film could have used Hartley's magical cinematic
touch big time and a tighter script if it was going to take me somewhere
I hadn't been before.</P>
