<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A routine serial killer flick, set in Chicago. Everything seen is what
has become a cliché for this genre. There is the sensitive lawman who is
traumatized by the killings and his inability to get the killer, and the
cat and mouse games that ensue between FBI Agent Joel Campbell (Spader)
and the elusive killer, who has the obligatory three names all serial
killers seem to have, David Allen Griffin (Reeves). He follows the agent
from L.A. to Chicago, where he phones to tell him, it hasn't been the
same since you left. I missed you. There is the psychic connection
between the killer and the investigating agent, which is depicted here
like yin and yang, with each needing the other to exist, and there is
the ego maniacal taunting of the killer, coming in the form of sending
photos of the next intended victim to Campbell, as he gives the police a
day before killing them. The film ends smoothly like those mystery shows
on TV do: with a car chase that seems to be obligatory filler for such
cop films, a rescue coming just in the nick of time, and the action
scenes being well choreographed to fit the pyrotechnical finale. The
attempt to bring any psychology into this thriller, never materializes,
except in the most banal manner. An inexperienced therapist, played with
restraint by Marisa Tomei, doles out inane cheerleading analysis to the
burnt-out cop, who has become her patient, concerned that the killer is
using him as his excuse to kill. In fact, the killer is more interested
in playing mind games with Spader than he is in killing his victims,
which convinced me that this film wasn't looking to go into new
territory with this 'let's make a profit for the producers' genre film.</P>
<P>This debut feature by the music video director Joe Charbanic is a
limited venture, smacking of formula questions and answers to the serial
killer's mental state, resulting in a picture that is decidedly painted
by-the-numbers.</P>
<P>The film opens under the dark skies of Chicago, where the noise heard is
from police sirens and helicopters from above the skyline of Lake
Michigan, swooping down on the crime scene. The murder of a young woman
takes place in the building where Joel Campbell lives, and he is drawn
into the case when he makes contact with the hard-boiled investigating
detective who is at the crime scene, Hollis (Ellis). Currently, the
agent is on a disability leave, seeing a therapist about his inability
to function anymore, taking heavy doses of sleeping pills,
self-injecting himself in the stomach with drugs for his migraines, and
having nightmares in his unkept apartment about being unable to catch
sicko David Allen Griffin during an L.A. foot chase; and, from failing
to save the killer's last target in L.A. -- Campbell's married lover --
from a death by fire. The agent gets back on the case when the sicko,
seen always dressed in black, sends him by Federal Express a photo of
his next victim. The killer's modus operandi is to watch the victim
while undetected, get their routine down pat, and then sneak into their
apartment, gag them and tie them up, dance with them, touch them without
having sex and then strangle them with a piano wire. He makes for an
uninteresting sicko, reading his banal lines with an undue need for
perfect enunciation, as if he were trying out for an amateur Shakespeare
production in some small Midwestern town. Rumor has it, that Reeves
expected this role to only be a cameo and when the role was expanded and
his pay wasn't, he became unhappy with the studio, as a result refusing
to do any publicity work for them on the film.</P>
<P>James Spader as the lead, most of his career a fine actor, has
difficulty doing anything with his uninteresting and predictable role,
except go with the props he's been handed. He needs reassurance from his
shrink that he can catch the killer, but gets further frustrated that he
is unsuccessful in saving the lives of two nondescript women, who can't
be warned in time of the danger they are in, despite their pictures
plastered all over the windy city and on the TV news.</P>
<P>The film covers up its banal story by some pretty slick shooting
devices, which include fast-paced editing and jump-cuts, and at times,
when taking on the killer's point of view, making the beautiful color go
grainy with a hand-held video camera, which is meant to signify that
there is some kind of mystery going on. What the sleek looking film
accomplishes, is that it makes this hollow film very watchable, looking
much like an MTV video.</P>
<P>The film ultimately fails because the story is never drawn out enough to
make it spellbinding or tense, the main characters are both too
hackneyed to bring something to the table except an exercise in playing
a role that goes against their film career typecasting. After about 80
minutes into the film, it breaks completely down in silliness and
incredibility, as the killer and the cop - yin and yang - meet
face-to-face for the first time in the cemetery where Spader's
girlfriend is buried and continue their cat-and-mouse relationship, this
time over the pretty therapist, who is held hostage in the same way his
former girlfriend was, which makes for a dicey ending to a dicey pic.</P>
