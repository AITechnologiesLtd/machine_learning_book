<P>Back in 1998, I had thought that maybe Matt Damon was getting to a point where
he was just repeating himself - the same path that early Tom Cruise went before
proving what a fine, charismatic actor he really was. "The Talented Mr. Ripley"
has proven to be a major exception. In "Rounders," Damon combines his "Good
Will Hunting's" lead genius character with a cross of the lawyer theatrics in
"The Rainmaker." In other words, you got it, Damon is playing a genius poker
player (not a mathematician but close) who happens to be a law student. Okay,
that's not a fair criticism to make. The question is: is the movie any good?
Yes, but Damon is too good to be true in his first lead role since "Good Will
Hunting." </P>
<P>"Rounders" stars Damon as Mike McDermott, a clean-cut, high-stakes poker
gambler, who calls it quits after losing $30,000 to a Russian gangster named
Teddy KGB (John Malkovich). Mike chooses to stick to his law books and cavort
with his live-in girlfriend, Jo (Gretchen Mol). No sooner can you predict that
he'll revert to his gambling instincts when his troubled best friend, Worm
(Edward Norton), is released from prison and goes back to gambling with
Russians and other card players. Unsurprisingly, Worm brings the juice back
into Mike's soul to gamble - Mike resists but can't help it and lies to Jo
about his habit. The trouble is that Worm owes money to Teddy KGB and Mike
vouches for Worm's activities - ouch! We're talking the noirish landscape of
"Mean Streets," without the grit. </P>
<P>Most of "Rounders" is conventionally told, but the difference is in the amount
of attention paid to the details of poker playing. Director John Dahl and
writers David Levien and Brian Koppelman render all the little secrets and
nuances that all poker players adhere to. Since the film is narrated by Mike,
we listen and watch how he studies players, and how he determines an opponent's
cards because of the "tell." In other words, the opponent is telling the player
what cards they are holding through gestures and specific tics. Teddy KGB's
tell is the way he fondles an Oreo cookie. If he splits the cookie in front of
his face, he's cheating. If he splits it by his ear, he's ahead and may be the
winner. </P>
<P>Several scenes are structured around such moments. For example, there's an
early scene where Mike enters a room where a judge and his cohorts are playing
poker, and he pinpoints each hand the player is holding. It's an absorbing
"movie" scene but unbelievable in context - how the hell can you tell what
cards the players are holding if you just walked in out of nowhere but, then
again, what do I know about poker? The movie's best, tense sequence is when
Mike and Worm are roughed up by some cops after trying to swindle them - the
scene has a noir element since it shows their desperation at trying to win
money so they can pay back the gangsters. </P>
<P>The problem with "Rounders" is that it is too soft around the edges. It wants
be a noirish Mamet-like parable about gambling and it has the right atmosphere
for it, but the wrong attitude. Matt Damon is too squeaky clean and youthful to
be a professional gambler - he's like the Superboy of poker. He wins at every
hand he plays, but the main thrust of the story should be how you can lose
everything, even your life, when the gambling becomes an addiction. The irony
of its conclusion is that it resorts to a "Rocky" climax, and then it tells you
that gambling is the only solution to life's problems. You can't escape who you
are or what you are. </P>
<P>"Rounders" does benefit from colorful supporting performances. I loved Martin
Landau's sad-eyed Judge Petrovsky whose sole advice to Mike is that destiny
chooses who we are - a platitude that is not applicable to Mike's situation.
John Turturro is quite restrained, for a change, as Joey Knish, a gambler who
doesn't take risks and plays just to make a living. John Malkovich is
especially good as the thick-Russian-accented Teddy KGB who loves to fondle
Oreo cookies. Also worth noting is the undernourished role of Jo, fetchingly
played by Gretchen Mol, and she is the only reasonable person in the entire
movie! </P>
<P>Accolades must go to Edward Norton playing the weasel-like loser, appropriately
named Worm, who takes far too many risks. It also seems as if he's not much of
a poker player since Mike comes to his aid and plays at very club and function
to win the money they owe. Norton brings an authenticity to the role - he
appears as a real-life character with flaws. </P>
<P>"Rounders" is generally well-acted, well-directed and well-shot. The movie is
full of whispers, jazz music, smoky corridors, and pious platitudes about
gambling and poker courtesy of Mike's voice-overs. Still, the movie takes the
easy way out, and lets Mike off the hook. Several poker-playing scenes and
Mike's grand exit at the end reminded me too much of "Good Will Hunting." It
would been a more winning hand if the film was only about Worm. </P>
