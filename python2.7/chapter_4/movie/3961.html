<PRE>                                    FUN
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     I find it amazing that *two* films about teenage girls slaughtering an
older woman would be released within a year of each other.  I find it even
more amazing that both turned out to be compelling, exceptional films.</P>
<P>     FUN, the more recent of the two films, is the story of two American
middle-class teens, one (Renee Humphrey's Hillary) is the victim of an
abusive father, the other (Alicia Witt's Bonnie) is an ultra-hyper
compulsive liar.  The two discover an instant bond and after one fun-filled
day of adventure, they decide to end the day's games with the brutal murder
of a local grandmother whose primary preoccupation is with BINGO.  For
"fun."</P>
<P>     HEAVENLY CREATURES, 1994's stunner (and Oscar nominee for Best Original
Screenplay), was a very similar tale of obsession among two friends which
ends in the murder of one of the girls' mother.  HEAVENLY CREATURES was a
true story made to seem almost unreal.  FUN is fiction, and it's almost too
believable.</P>
<P>     Half of the film was shot in mock-documentary fashion, on grainy, black
and white Super 16mm.  This half of the movie follows the girls after their
conviction for the murder.  The other half of the picture is in vivid color,
and traces the events of the fateful day.  The two halves are beautifully
intercut together with seamless editing by Monica Lightstone.</P>
<P>     Director Rafael Zelinsky does a remarkable job as well, balancing the
angelic looks of two girls, who only want to have fun, with the dark and
twisted desires that apparently lurk beneath their surfaces.  Credit has to
go to Witt and Humphrey as well (both won acting awards at Sundance), who
play their parts with sublime perfection.  Humphrey is a bit mature for her
15 year-old character, but Witt is an undeniable chameleon at taking on a
persona and making it her own.</P>
<P>     Although the film is a bit draggy during some of the prison scenes and
has a questionable performance by Leslie Hope as the girls' crusty
counselor, there's very little to complain about.  The power of FUN is in
watching these girls embrace their crime, even as they face an eternity in
prison in painful separation from each other.  They loved the murder; they
have no remorse.  It was "nuclear."  It was "fun."  The moral implications
weigh heavy on the viewer, and it stays with you for days afterward.
Ultimately, the film serves as a serious and disturbing reminder that "fun"
can be anything but.</P>
