<P>     What do you call a sequel that's not a sequel?  As director Wang
and writer Auster were making the wonderful SMOKE, they realized that
the members of their cast were "assuming a life independent of their
script."  So they had the notion of making a sort of (very much sort of)
follow-up that could be shot fast (it took six days), use available
actors from SMOKE (these are few), add many new, mostly volunteer
performers, do the whole thing as a series of improvisations as opposed
to the carefully scripted SMOKE.</P>
<P>     This time both Wang and Auster are listed as directors.  They also
"created situations" with the help of the cast.  The film was shot in
six days with part of the SMOKE crew and several replacements.  The
funding, provided by Miramax, must have been under a shoestring,
perhaps a few inches only.</P>
<P>     BLUE IN THE FACE takes it title from the actors being urged to
talk until they are just that.  It has little in common with "Smoke"
save that its epicenter is "The Brooklyn Cigar Company," the corner
store managed by Auggie (Harvey Keitel).  The film might better be
called "All You Wanted To Know About Brooklyn and Never Thought of
Asking."</P>
<P>     Sometimes it feels like  "More About Brooklyn Than You Wanted to
Know." At other times it does not.</P>
<P>     BLUE IN THE FACE is a celebration of Brooklyn, its many racial
groups that presumably live in harmony (in the movie they go further,
into friendship), the nostalgia for the Dodgers whose departure hurt so
much, the ghost of Jackie Robinson, the need for retaining TBCC which
is more than just about tobacco, etc.  The statistics include the
number of potholes in Brooklyn.  We also get some new and old
documentary footage.</P>
<P>     BLUE IN THE FACE opens splendidly.  Outside TBCC, Auggie's
girlfriend (Mel Gorham) is talking a blue streak.  A twelve-year old
boy snatches the purse of a woman, is chased and caught by Auggie.  The
bleeding-heart snatchee (Mira Sorvino pre-"Mighty Aphrodite"), though
urged on by experienced, world-wise Auggie, will not press charges.
Disgusted, Auggie gives the purse back to the thief saying "Take it!"
The boy runs off.  Mira is livid with rage.</P>
<P>     Little of the hour-and-a-half is up to those standards.  People
come and go, mostly desultory talk takes place, characters reappear or
don't.  There is a strong climate of good fellowship.  A few sketches
work well, the others do not.</P>
<P>     This is the kind of movie that expands the medium, that you want
to like.  In one sense, it is a very, very distant cousin of talkfest
pictures like the chic METROPOLITAN or the studentish SLACKER.  Even
more distantly, it is a street version of the sophisticated MY DINNER
WITH ANDRE or the films of Eric Rohmer.  In another sense it is close
to e-mail chat, but with a much higher ratio of interesting to dull.
Still, there are arid stretches.</P>
<P>     Nice things do occur however.  Lou Reed, behind the counter at the
start and intermittently, addresses us on a whole mess of ideas,
beginning with the fact he's been leaving Brooklyn for 36 years.</P>
<P>     The end credits are followed by more film then by credits and then
by a heartfelt tribute to the late Jerry Garcia.  So don't walk out of
the theater until the lights come on.  In-between the best improviser
is Jim Jarmusch who goes to the TBCC to smoke his last cigarette and
talk with Auggie.</P>
<P>     What a difference a smart director-writer can make! Here, Jarmusch
could be a character in one of his own movies.  In his several
appearances he discourses humorouly on smoking, tells of his first
cigarette, the result of a robbery by his young friends in Akron, Ohio,
when he was twelve.  He tells of a friend who had his alarm clock wake
him up every four hours, so that he might have a smoke and go back to
sleep.</P>
<P>     Ever the film buff, Jarmusch describes actor Richard Conte in a
war movie where he plays an obsessive smoker.  We see a scene of that
old film.  Jarmusch also tells of the schoolboy interpretation of Lucky
Strike's LSMFT: "Loose Stomach Means Full Toilet," then laughs at the
absurd slogan "It's Toasted."</P>
<P>     He then wonders why, when a movie character's gun is emptied, he
throws the revolver away!  All the while--as well as in in some
sketches with other people--Keitel listens, adds some words, always
makes you feel that he is real and cares about those around him.</P>
<P>     Jarmusch is immediately identifiable.  Others, like Lily Tomlin
as a man, are not.  I had a problem recognizing Roseanne whom I first
took for a sleazy hooker.  Her acting is atrocious.  When she turns out
to be the wife of the store's owner (Victor Argo) she does a dumb
shtick from her TV programs about wanting to go to Las Vegas.</P>
<P>     Madonna, too, as a singing telegram messenger in a sluttish outfit
may cause a double-take as she looks way older than her then 35 years.
She is not amusing.</P>
<P>     Mel Gorham, as a Latino pepperpot, has one of the funniest lines.
She tells Auggie " I um goinggg  to make looove to you, I am goinggg to
ride you like a Beeeg Boool."</P>
<P>     I forget who the dummy is that out of the blue provides us with
this aberrant wisdom: "First you like somebody, then you kiss them,
then you do the dirty, and if you fall in love with them, you marry
someone else."</P>
<P>     Other "situations" can be be dull, but the better ones
compensate.  The novelty and brio of the film are not without charm.</P>
<P>     Sometimes, leftovers can make dishes even better than the
original.  Sometimes they cannot, but they are still worth eating.
"Blue in the Face" is like that.</P>
<P>     NOTE: The last segment is obviously a (welcome) afterthought.  Was
it added after the film was originally shown, as a piece In Memoriam
Jerry Garcia (August 1, 1942 - August 9, 1995)? I am told that it was
screened as "Coffee and Cigarettes" at the Telluride Festival, and that
it was the last video Garcia made.</P>
<P>     Oddly, Jim Jarmusch made "Coffee and Cigarettes" (short,1986),
then "Coffee and Cigarettes Part Two" (short, 1988), then "Coffee and
Cigarettes (Somewhere In California)" (1993).  I have seen at least two
of them, but I don't remember any of those being anything like the item
in "Blue."</P>
