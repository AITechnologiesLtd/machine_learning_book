<PRE>                             ANASTASIA</PRE>
<P>There are a few small criticisms that come to mind as I watched
ANASTASIA.    Despite some wonderful animation, when Dimitri walks up
stairs, he seems to hop.   And when he goes down the steps, he seems
to stumble.    I could not understand that because the rest of the
animation, and in particular the ballroom scenes, were spectacularly
perfect.</P>
<P>The other thing one must wonder about is why this story of a Russian
Princess and the Russian Revolution is suitable for children, even
if it is in animation.   And is it something adults will want to
watch in as much as it is animated?   Why does the story imply that
the real Anastasia is returned to her grandmother when, in fact, no
one knows that, nor do we know if there is a real Anastasia who escaped
the execution of the royal family?  "And the greatest mystery of the
20th Century begins. . . "   To which I say, "THE greatest mystery?
Hardly."</P>
<P>Be that as it may, the animation is a delight to watch.   Rasputin
is suitably monstrous bringing to mind the devil in Fantasia's Night
on Bald mountain.   And, getting back to the animation, why is every
woman in animated films shown as wide-eyed beyond belief?  Such as
Jasmine in ALADDIN?  And Anastasia?</P>
<P>An all-star cast is used for the voices behind the characters:</P>
