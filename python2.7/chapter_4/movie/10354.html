<PRE>                              FLUBBER 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
                      2 :-( :-(  for flying rubber</PRE>

Walsh</P>
<P>In this Disney offering for Christmas, our children are presented with
the latest in technological goo – FLUBBER i.e. flying rubber. Like most
John Hughes movies he is out to entertain the juvenile masses with his
usual slapstick style of mayhem-come-hurt-em comicness. How many laughs
can be generated from flying bowling balls repeatedly rebounding off
somebody's head? Lot's - that's if you're underage for both TITANIC and
TOMMOROW NEVER DIES. The standard of comedy reaches the profound heights
of FLUBBER shooting through the digestive system of an individual,
before exploding out the poop shoot in a spectacular display of
fireworks. It's the kind of grade six humour where farts, burps and
bodily sounds sends kids into a state of uproar; and perhaps the sought
of humour which should be left in the privacy of a classroom.</P>
<P>Sadly, our children are taught nothing from this movie. They are
undeniably entertained but no lesson is learnt. Where are those
wonderful holiday children's movies like BABE, MATILDA, A LITTLE
PRINCESS where entertainment and learning are rolled into one. Instead
our children are introduced to abstract adult themes like Cybersex. I
found the topic particularly fascinating, having a particularly close
relationship with my own computer, but this is not your everyday topic
for show and tell.</P>
<P>In this movie two females, a college professor (Sara Jane Reynolds) and
a flying robot Weebo, vie for the love of an absent-minded scientist
(Robin Williams). The robot in question projects an image of a woman in
a nightie before entering the bedroom of her master to plant a kiss on
his lips. When the robot in question awaits death, she tells the
scientist of her secret love for him and also about the love child
carrying a bit of both of them inside it. When it comes to sex, children
always want to know how and why. So how does a parent explain to a young
child that computers and humans can't copulate? Just when you thought
you hit home run with your lessons on the birds and the bees, here comes
a puzzling scenario of a computer with claims to immaculate conception.
How to tie it in with the Christmas Story?</P>
<P>FLUBBER isn't a poorly made children's movie by any means, it's just not
a very good one. Robin Williams plays second fiddle to the flying
elastic compound and sadly loses every scene to the special effects
department. The super goo that has a life force of its own and makes
possible the impossible, is also every bit the fluffy material daydreams
are made off. It comes as a big let down when you finally wake up to
reality and realise that the chemistry experiment has just blown up in
your face - very disappointing overall.</P>
