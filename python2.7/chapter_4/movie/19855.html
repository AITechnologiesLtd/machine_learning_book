<PRE>Eyes Wide Shut  (1999)  159m</PRE>
<PRE>Q:  How do you review a Stanley Kubrick film?
A:  Wait ten years.</PRE>
<P>Yikes.  I'm not sure how many people are qualified to handle the critique of 
a new Kubrick film upon its release, but one thing is certain: time has 
proven many a detractor wrong.  Kubrick's films have always confounded 
expectations, which is why inevitably they become reappraised and treated 
more generously.  2001 was not the cowboys-in-space jingoism that sci-fi 
films of the time were built on; BARRY LYNDON was more like a walk through 
an art gallery than a lusty historical romance; FULL METAL JACKET avoided 
the path of all other Vietnam films and spent one half of its time at boot 
camp and the other half in burned-out rubble.  And even though I should know 
better, I've also fallen victim to my own preconceptions.  I was crushed 
after seeing the long-awaited premiere of THE SHINING - it just wasn't scary 
- but went back for a second viewing nonetheless, and then a third, and then 
a fourth.  It has become more insidious each time and has yielded a 
subterranean, primal quality that I find strangely engrossing.  I figure the 
same will happen with EYES WIDE SHUT.  The difference is that this time I 
was not disappointed.  That is, I didn't have any expectations.</P>
<P>I'm not prepared to tell anyone what EYES WIDE SHUT is 'about', either 
storywise or in terms of concept.  I think it's sufficient to say that 
Kubrick is at the top of his form - at the age of 70 he has retained the 
provocation and vivacity of his earlier works.  But I wonder how many 
critics will go into theaters with not only their mouths but their ears wide 
shut also.  Hypothetically: four people go to see EWS.  One person enthuses 
about it afterwards.  Another is bored senseless.  The other two are simply 
confused.  Guess which three of the above were silly enough to read 
tabloids, watch 60 MINUTES, look for gossip on the Internet, and end up with 
their own fixed vision of what EYES WIDE SHUT was 'supposed' to be.  No, 
there are no hot-and-heavy sex scenes between Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, 
and no full frontal nudity on their behalf either (it's with much 
satisfaction that I browsed through all these misguided rumors that I've 
been saving up only after actually seeing the film for myself).  But you 
have to wonder how prankish Kubrick himself is in this regard - the film's 
theatrical teaser, in which Cruise wordlessly fondles Kidman before a 
mirror, is undoubtedly going to plant preconceptions in every viewer's mind. 
  In fact Cruise and Kidman spend only a handful of scenes together: the 
storyline is concerned mainly with Cruise's own journey of discovery. His 
character alone appears to be responsible for the film's title, Kubrick's 
metaphor for those who walk through an uncertain world with eyes wide open 
but seeing nothing, or at least nothing they can comprehend.  Cruise meets a 
variety of characters who are not what they seem:  they wear masks, 
costumes, or wigs; they have foreign accents or ambivalent sexuality; they 
appear by chance and then are unavailable when he seeks them; even the city 
he lives in has a hybrid idenitity - for the first half of the film we could 
easily believe it was in Europe.  He has elliptical conversations with his 
wife and doesn't know when his friend (Sydney Pollack) is telling the truth. 
  Everyone in this film wears a mask, even when they're not wearing masks: 
Cruise's trademark grin is different this time, a nervous reaction that 
seems to be covering frustration or cold panic.  Cruise starts 
investigating, and Kubrick's Steadicam sinuously keeps pace with him.  
Throughout the film he is primarily an observer - he encounters many women 
in various states of undress but is permitted only to look and not touch 
(two models at a party, a prostitute (and her roommate), a drug overdose, a 
corpse, a debauchery.  This frustration is obviously piling up on him - the 
first hour of the film is shot in warm and seductive flesh tones - and even 
when he takes action he remains an observer rather than a participant.  But, 
like Cruise, we will never know what the 'truth' behind this tale really is, 
and no doubt film buffs will be picking over clues for some time to come.  
It's worth bearing in mind, however, that Kubrick would not have wanted any 
one truth to emerge in the first place.</P>
<P>It's perverse that Kubrick should spend two years shooting a film that takes 
place over two days, but the results appear to be worth it.  Cruise and 
Kidman have never appeared so intense.  Cruise, carrying the weight of the 
film, does well in the preferred Kubrick style: the deliberately paced 
dialogue (each character takes their turn to speak), the way exposition is 
dragged out by characters who are nervous or awkward, the way one person's 
dialogue is repeated as a question by another.  All of this makes EYES WIDE 
SHUT unique among other contemporary films that throw up their pop offerings 
on similar subjects.  It is by turns playful, sensuous, menacing, funny, 
otherwordly, and elegant. It is a film that will get under your skin.  It's 
mesmerizing just to watch these people acting (the well-publicized constant 
retakes eventually shape the mannered performances preferred in Kubrick's 
productions), including scene-stealing supporting roles such as the rental 
shop owner and the desk clerk.  The fact that the married couple of the film 
are played by a real married couple also help give the film a little extra 
edge - that, and the knowledge that this was the master film-maker's final 
opus.</P>
<P>It's appropriate that Kubrick should go out with a deliberation on 
obsession.  It's fitting too that the final credit crawl should be 
accompanied by a waltz, given that his most indelible cinematic image has 
been that of spacecraft gliding to the strains of Strauss.  And despite the 
tentative plans for at least one further film, Kubrick probably knew all 
along that this was going to be his swan song.  He died only days after 
screening his approved final cut.  The abrupt, final line of the film can be 
read as Kubrick's last joke: he literally went out with a bang.</P>
<P>And ten years from now, I'll start thinking on what EYES WIDE SHUT is 
actually 'about'.</P>
<P>This might sound like the worst of cliches, but I saw 2001 at the age of 14 
and it changed my life.  Thank you, Stanley.</P>
