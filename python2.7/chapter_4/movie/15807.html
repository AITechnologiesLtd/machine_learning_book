<P>In a crowded Christmas marketplace, it would be easy for a little movie 
like "Down in the Delta" to get lost in the shuffle. Hopefully, positive 
reviews and good word-of-mouth will help audiences discover that, despite 
some flaws, this is a film far more deserving of their attention than 
material like "You've Got Mail," "Stepmom" and "Patch Adams." Poet Maya 
Angelou's debut as a feature director is a solid, often moving story 
about family, love, reconciliation and self-determination. "Down in the 
Delta" resolutely avoids the clichés that most productions embrace, 
resulting in one of the only holiday offerings this year that is both 
heartwarming and genuine.</P>
<P>Loretta (Alfre Woodward) is an unemployed single mother in a Chicago 
ghetto who uses alcohol and drugs to mute her pain; neglecting her 
autistic daughter Tracy (Kulani Hassen) and driving her mother, Rosa Lynn 
(Mary Alice), and son, Thomas (Mpho Koaho) to distraction. Desperate to 
jolt her daughter out of self-medicated numbness, Rosa Lynn insists that 
Loretta and the children spend the summer with Uncle Earl (Al Freeman Jr.
) in the family's Mississippi Delta hometown. With great reluctance, 
Loretta boards the bus with the kids, bound for a three month stay in 
Hooterville Hell. </P>
<P>Initially, things look as bad as Loretta expected. The rural home is in a 
dry county. Earl's beloved wife, Annie (Esther Rolle) suffers from 
Alzheimer's disease and requires constant attention from her husband and 
Zenia (Loretta Devine), a caregiver who views Loretta with suspicion. To 
make matters worse, Loretta must drag herself out of bed early each 
morning to make chicken sausages in Earl's diner.</P>
<P>Things change, of course, but not in typical Hollywood fashion. Loretta 
doesn't find romance in the bucolic setting. There are no melodramatic 
outbursts or hokey speeches and, best of all, Myron Goble's script 
doesn't whip out a terminal illness to tidy things up. Instead, we're 
presented with well-rounded characters and reasonable plot developments 
leading to a conclusion that doesn't feel the least bit contrived. </P>
<P>Pure and simple, this is a rich story about the power of family, with a 
terrific ensemble cast. Mary Alice is forceful as stubborn matriarch Rosa 
Lynn, young Mpho Koaho gives a remarkably assured performance as Thomas, 
a child mature beyond his years, and the late Esther Rolle, in her final 
film appearance, is heart-breaking as a once-vibrant woman turned into a 
jittery child by Alzheimer's. Wesley Snipes, appearing midway through the 
film as Earl's son, Will, a successful Atlanta lawyer, does fine work, 
adding more texture to an already multi-layered story.</P>
<P>Even though Alfre Woodward is the central figure in the tale, Al Freeman 
Jr. walks away with the film as Earl, a seasoned, sturdy, inherently 
decent man who earns respect by living his values, rather than 
pontificating. Our world would operate much better if everyone had an 
Uncle Earl in their life.</P>
<P>Despite the wealth of vivid characters around her, Alfre Woodward's 
Loretta remains a bit too sketchy and her journey to self-actualization 
is overly abrupt. We see her change, but don't really feel it. The 
addition of a revelatory scene or two would have given her character more 
resonance.</P>
<P>I suspect the problem lies more with Maya Angelou than Woodward. "Down in 
the Delta" was originally intended to be a made-for-cable movie and it 
shows. While the film represents an impressive directorial debut, it is 
clearly a first-time effort. Too many scenes end with slow fades to white 
or black, and flashback sequences of a nightmarish family trauma during 
the Civil War are amateurishly staged and replayed excessively. </P>
<P>Problem areas aside, "Down in the Delta" is a powerful, rewarding 
experience. It is rare to see a film extol the values of devotion, hard 
work and dedication without becoming leaden or preachy. Hopefully, 
audiences will sift through the heavily-advertised holiday trifles and 
seek out the understated rewards of this small treasure.</P>
