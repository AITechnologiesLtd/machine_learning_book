BLOOD SIMPLE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>In 1984 the Coen Brothers (director/writer Joel and producer/writer
Ethan) brought out their first picture, BLOOD SIMPLE.  A stylish piece
of film noir, it has exasperatingly slow pacing but devilishly demented
characters and a wonderfully wicked, labyrinthine plot.  Characters die,
or do they?  And killers keep accidentally leaving clues behind.</P>
<P>The Coen brothers make interesting movies.  Most people know their most
famous picture, the Oscar winning FARGO, but even the brother's failures
(The HUDSUCKER PROXY for example) contain large flashes of brilliance.</P>
<P>In order, one supposes, to celebrate roughly their first 15 years, they
are releasing a director's cut of BLOOD SIMPLE to the theaters.  They
claim to have taken out some of the boring parts and added in a bit as
well.  But the running time is about the same and the movie seems little
changed with the exception of a hilarious introduction.  The print is
clean and the sound sharp.</P>
<P>As the movie opens, a supercilious film preservation expert in his
library pauses in his reading and pipe smoking to provide us a little
history about the film.  He explains that the movie was a tremendous
success and started the entire indie craze.  After this delicious bit of
satire, the director's cut segues nicely into the original story.</P>
<P>Abby (Frances McDormand) is married to Marty (Dan Hedaya), the owner of
a cheap bar in a seedy Texas town.  M. Emmet Walsh plays a slime-ball
private detective whom Marty hires to investigate Abby's affair with Ray
(John Getz), a bartender at Marty's bar.</P>
<P>Typical of the film's terse dialog is an interchange between another
bartender, Meurice (Samm-Art Williams), and Meurice's blonde girlfriend.
"Nice guy," she says of Marty.  "Not really," Meurice replies.</P>
<P>The intriguing script is much better than the directing, and one is left
with a strong wish that the Coen brothers had done a much more
meticulous job of excising the boring parts in this director's cut.
Still, it is a fascinating little tale and amply demonstrates the talent
of these filmmakers.  (For a little extra fun, listen carefully and see
if you can recognize the female voice on Marty's answering machine.
It's an uncredited role, and the actress does not appear in the movie.)</P>
<P>BLOOD SIMPLE runs a remarkably slow 1:37.  It is rated R for violence
and would be acceptable for most teenagers.  (There is only a single
scene that will have viewers squirming.)</P>
