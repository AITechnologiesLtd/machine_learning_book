<P>There's a point in Pearl Harbor when Cuba Gooding Jr. leaps into a
battleship's gun turret and starts shooting down Japanese planes while
hell rages around him.  It's a dramatic moment... until you realize that
it's that "Show me the money!" guy from Jerry Maguire, shooting CGI
bullets at a CGI plane... and you are reminded once again just how phony
everything you've seen in Pearl Harbor has been.</P>
<P>Ironically, this incident, where ship's cook Dorie Miller took charge
and shot back during America's worst hour on December 7, 1941, is just
about the only true event to be found in the entire, oppressive
three-hour film.  (And our producers are quick to remind us of just how
ripped-from-history this little vignette is.  Never mind that Gooding
has a pitiful excuse for a role with maybe five minutes of screen time.)</P>
<P>After more than a year of hype, Pearl Harbor finally hits theater
screens this Memorial Day weekend, anxious to repeat that Titanic
experience, by throwing us a love story set in the most inhospitable of
locations.  In Titanic, of course, it was a sinking ship.  Here, it's in
the middle of a military base while the bombs are dropping around the
smoochie lovebirds.</P>
<P>The trailers have been coy with the plot, and I'll do my best to keep
the various twists secret (except for that whole Japanese invasion
bit... sorry).  Pretty boy Rafe (Ben Affleck) and his scruffy best
friend Danny (Josh Hartnett) grow up on a farm, dreaming of taking to
the skies in the Air Force.  They get their wish when they enlist in
1940, and as Rafe prepares to ship out, he falls madly in love with
Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale), half nurse, half pin-up girl.</P>
<P>Rafe, "a slow reader" but damn if he doesn't look good in uniform,
volunteers to serve in the British air force, surprising Evelyn and
Danny, who head for the sunny, peaceful shores of Hawaii's Pearl Harbor
naval base to "sit out" the war in Europe.  While Rafe fights the Nazis,
our other pals soak up some rays.</P>
<P>After much gnashing of teeth, we're thigh-deep in a love triangle.  But
wouldn't you know it?  Just as the Titanic began to sink halfway through
the film, the first bomb is dropped on Pearl Harbor at 1 hour, 30
minutes into Pearl Harbor.  35 minutes later, the siege is over, and we
are left to contend with an iffy dénouement (which takes another 55
minutes to get resolved, as the U.S. plans its lame, first
counterstrike).</P>
<P>Plot excepted, Pearl Harbor is a good-looking film.  When the planes
whoosh by we can almost feel the wind.  When the bombs drop, we feel the
shudder.  And when lovable supporting characters get blown to bits, it's
hard to suppress the waterworks.</P>
<P>However, anyone expecting a think piece on the war in the Pacific is
going to be sorely disappointed.  Unlike, say, Tora! Tora! Tora!,
history gets short shrift in Pearl Harbor, as director Michael Bay's
WWII for Dummies gives us laughably simplistic details about why the war
with Japan was entered into.  Bizarrely, yet in a blatant attempt to
garner an international audience that is not offended in any way by the
movie, the film virtually absolves Japan of any wrongdoing, excusing the
sneak attack as their regrettable only option.</P>
<P>Thank God, at least, that we are mercifully spared the Saving Private
Ryan and Titanic flash-forwards to a melodramatic, length-padding
present.  With a lame and drippy score courtesy of Hans Zimmer, there's
plenty of sap already, thank you very much.  As well, the film's few
attempt at lightening things up garner few laughs, if ever.</P>
<P>Critics (myself included) are going to endlessly compare Pearl Harbor to
Titanic, and for good reason.  However, aside from the length and the
love story, these are radically different pictures.  Ultimately, Pearl
Harbor is not a film made by a man fascinated with history (a la James
Cameron), but rather a studio-manufactured tearjerker, with nothing left
to chance.</P>
<P>Titanic was so opulent and obsessed with period detail it almost made
you forget that Billy Zane can't act.  Pearl Harbor is clearly the work
of hundreds of computer experts dueling it out to see who can make the
biggest explosion.  Been there, done that, folks.</P>
<P>Titanic was a big risk that took guts to make.  Pearl Harbor is just
another step toward the Disneyfication of our collective memories,
trying unsuccessfully to prey upon a resurgence of patriotism.</P>
<P>Titanic was epic, and it made you forget about the passage of time. 
Pearl Harbor is soulless and desperate in its cheesy attempt to appeal
to women, running at three hours long mainly because it's all done in
slow motion.</P>
<P>Which is funny, because the actual invasion in 1941 only lasted for less
than two.</P>
