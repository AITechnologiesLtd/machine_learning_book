<PRE>In Brief -- by Zachary McGhee</PRE>
<P>RETURN TO ME [Hunt] -- I learned many, many of David Duchovny's weak
points in this film: (1) I cannot, under almost any circumstances, truly
picture him -- or believe him -- as an architect; (2) He looks horrible
in a tuxedo, but, somehow, manages realism in a bloodied one; (3) A dog
can cry better than he can; (4) At the onset of dancing, he appears
resolutely feminine; (5) None of it matters: He shares great chemistry
with the lovely Minnie Driver, and the premise is too contrived to be
accidental (movies like this, so long as they maintain their charm, are
allowed a free pass for their plot -- even Pleasantville relied on a
preposterous plot device in order to "leap into" its subject matter),
and Bonnie Hunt, though I suppose she could use a few more directing
lessons, maintains her title as Hollywood's best gal pal (her acting
ability is not in doubt, but I fear her in a lead) and seems a fairly
skilled screenwriter as well. If, however, the parallel introduction to
both characters had been reduced merely to Driver's entrance, the
film would've benefited as a whole, but instead I have mild
reservations. B-</P>
