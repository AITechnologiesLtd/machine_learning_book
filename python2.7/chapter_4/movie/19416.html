Empire of the Sun<HR>Review by Alex Ioshpe
Copyright by Alex Ioshpe</PRE>
<PRE>9/10 - Alternative rating: A -</PRE>
<P>By making "The Color Purple", Spielberg proved that he was not just giant
sharks and aliens, but a universal director capable of creating serious and
sensual films. With "Empire of the Sun" Spielberg, for the first time in his
life, ventured into the world of war.</P>
<P>The film is based on the novel by J. G. Ballard , describing his own
experiences under World War 2, when he lost his parents and had to survive
under terrible surcomstances in a Japanese camp.</P>
<P>Jim (Christian Bale ) is living a privileged life with his parents in
pre-Pearl Harbor Shanghai. When the war begins, Jim and his parents are
separated, and Jim survives for weeks on his own, living of the food left in
his and his neighbors' abandoned mansions. Most of the film is set in the
Lunghua prison camp, where Jim is forced to grow up under horrible
circumstances. The 10 year-old child is standing on the brink of insanity
and some of the films strongest moments are when Jim tries to explain to
himself the meaningless situation around him, and how the insanity of war
affects him.</P>
<P>The unique thing about "Empire of the Sun" is it's point of view. It shows
us war through eyes of an innocent child, whose life is forever changed and
ruined. This unique perspective allows us to see war differently.</P>
<P>Tom Stoppard's script is deep and emotional, displaying Jim's life through
his own thoughts and feelings. At the same time the historical parts are not
forgotten. There are a lot of philosophical questions and moral dilemmas
that question the essence of war.</P>
<P>"Empire of the Sun" has the largest British cast ever assebled for an
American movie. For Jim, Steven Spielberg deliberately chose an actor that
was totally unfamiliar to the audience - Christian Bale. Bale's performance
in the film brought me to tears. It is not often you see a little boy act
with such power, vulnerability and total understanding of his character.
Bale delivers without a doubt the strongest performance in the film. The
rest of the cast is solid and believable. Involving John Malcowich as Basie,
a survivor, an intelligent crock that pretends to be Jim's friend when he
can gain from it.  John Malcowich manages to create a believable character
that is a bit alike Danny Glover's character in "The Color Purple" - selfish
and unreliable, but never quite evil.</P>
<P>Joe Pentaliano is convincing as Basie's buddy and Nigel Havers is strong and
understanding as Dr.Rowlings, who becomes like a father figure for Jim.
But Spielberg has not forgot the Japaneese. A Japanese boy that becomes
Jim's distant friend on the other side of the fence, is extremely important
to the story. They save each other in several life threatening situations.
This relationship is suddenly ended when the boy is shot by one of Basie's
friends. When Jim cries out: "He was my friend..he gave me a mango", Basie
replays: "He was only a Jap". Spielberg does not show the Japanese as
cold-hearted bastards, but as human beings like Jim and the rest of the
prisoners.</P>
<P>Most of all,  "Empire of the Sun" is an tremendously emotional experience
about childhood lost in the horrors and insanity of war. Some scenes are
directed with such beauty and sadness, that it moved me like few films had
before.</P>
<P>Who will forget the panic in the streets of Shanghai at the beginning of
Japanese invasion. The frightening contrast between Englishmen driving in
their limousines to a party and thousands of Chinese desperately trying to
get out of Shanghai alive. Who will forget Spielberg's artistic and visually
stunning picturisation of the atom bomb. After the bomb goes off, the sky is
filled with blue and white waves, so you can't see where the sea ends and
the heaven begins. And while Jim's face is blinded with the white light, he
whispers: "..like God taking a photograph". In both of these scenes and many
more throughout the movie, Spielberg shows us that he is a master of
contrasts, combining mortal danger with visual beauty.</P>
<P>Combining a serious plot with incredible visuals, including wonderful
cinematography by Allen Daviau , wonderful art direction by Frederick Hole
and incredibly emotional musical score by John Williams, Spielberg has
created one of the most unique and heartbreaking war films.</P>
<P>The only problem with "Empire of the Sun" is that it begins to falter in
the middle, where Jim is in the camp. Where it seems Spielberg lost his
focus for a moment, not knowing what to show first or how to show it.
Although this mistake could have been overseen and forgotten, because of the
overall perfection of the film, "Empire of the Sun" has been underrated,
receiving unfairly criticism for being too pompous.</P>
<P>Finally, the war ends, and Jim is reunited with his parents under the
shadow of nascent Chinese communism. Much of what Jim experiences is
shocking, and Spielberg neither embellishes nor understates Jim's
experiences. Flies, death, and decomposition are everywhere, as are avarice
and (occasionally) kindness. The film has a strong grounding in World War II
and war history. I think that many  people lack such knowledge, and it is my
hope that films like "Empire of the Sun", "Schindler's List" and "Saving
Private Ryan" will make these people understand the meaning of war.</P>
