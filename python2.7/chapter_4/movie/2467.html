<PRE>                                    SIRENS
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Hugh Grant, Tara Fitzgerald, Sam Neill, Elle Macpherson,
           Portia de Rossi.
Screenplay/Director:  John Duigan.</P>
<P>     I'm no marketing whiz, but it would appear that someone made a
serious error in the advertising campaign for the new Australian import
SIRENS.  The posters prominently feature the bare back of
co-star/supermodel Elle Macpherson accompanied by the line, "Be
seduced."  One might be inclined to believe that the target audience is
men, and that SIRENS is simply some soft-core porn throwaway.  In fact,
SIRENS has more in common with ENCHANTED APRIL than it does with
EMMANUELLE.  Writer/director John Duigan, creator of the wonderful
coming-of-age films THE YEAR MY VOICE BROKE and FLIRTING, has fashioned
another tale of sexual awakening, this time focusing on an adult, and
it's a delightfully acted and beautifully filmed comedy-drama.</P>
<P>     SIRENS is a fictional story based on the true-life 1930s artist
Norman Lindsay (Sam Neill), a free-thinking Australian whose nude
studies, particularly "The Crucified Venus," created a stir in
conservative British circles.  When the Anglican church becomes
concerned about the "blasphemous" painting's inclusion in an
international exhibition of Lindsay's work, it sends clergyman Anthony
Campion (Hugh Grant) and his wife Estella (Tara Fitzgerald) to convince
Lindsay to withdraw it voluntarily.  The very proper British couple is
invited to stay at Lindsay's wild and lush compound, where they meet
his three principal models:  lusty Sheela (Elle Macpherson), socialist
Prue (Kate Fischer) and innocent Giddy (Portia de Rossi).  While
Anthony works to persuade Lindsay, Estella is left to discover the
untamed world of the Australian Blue Mountains.  Gradually, a change
comes over her, as the influence of the uninhibited models opens
Estella's eyes to desires she didn't know she had.</P>
<P>     SIRENS skillfully interweaves two themes without seeming
overstuffed.  The principal story, that of Estella's response to the
liberated and liberating world of the Lindsay estate, focuses on how
that world interacts with the restrictive female sexual mores of the
time.  Tara Fitzgerald does an impressive job of conveying Estella's
growing curiosity through her open face and subtle body language, and
our view of an Australia only just on the edge of "civilization" comes
through her eyes.  That world is populated by wombats, insects and even
flowers which take on a kind of personality.  However, most
significantly, there are snakes, and the Linday compound is established
as a kind of reverse-Eden where humans have the chance to return to a
state of nature through acknowledgement of sensuality.  The characters
native to this world are frequently shown eating apples, practically
wallowing in their connection to original sin.  Lindsay challenges the
Christian notion of sin as linked to female sexuality, and SIRENS is
largely the playing out of that challenge.</P>
<P>     At the same time, the issue of artistic censorship is very much
part of the subtext.  The dinner table debates between Anthony and
Lindsay frame the argument, and while it is clear where Duigan's
sentiments lie he doesn't turn Anthony into a dogma-spouting
stereotype.  He presents the Church's case with a respect for its
views, and Hugh Grant is a charming and surprisingly hip spokesman.
While the arguments are nothing special, and in fact tend towards the
cliche, Duigan treats the issue of art, its influence on the public and
the artist's responsibility as a legitimate subject of debate.</P>
<P>     If there is any fault to be found with Duigan's script, it's that
he does skimp on his characters in the interest of establishing his
analogy.  The relationship between Anthony and Estella is not as
well-established as it might be, and Lindsay himself is little more
than a catalyst for Estella's transformation.  Macpherson and Fischer
look good, but they're given too much to say and it's never all that
interesting when they do speak.  However, SIRENS does quite a lot with
its visuals, highlighting its glorious Australian settings, and it
maintains a frisky sense of humor about its sensual subject matter
without sniggering over it.  Those who might be looking for a leering
sex romp should look elsewhere; SIRENS is lyrical, lively and
thoughtful and always a feast for the senses.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 sirens:  8.</PRE>
