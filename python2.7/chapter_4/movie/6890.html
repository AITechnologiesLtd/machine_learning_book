                       A film review by David Wilcock
                        Copyright 1997 David Wilcock</PRE>
<PRE>STARRING MEL GIBSON, RENE RUSSO AND GARY SINESE
DIRECTED BY RON HOWARD
TOUCHSTONE PICTURES RELEASE</PRE>
<P>Ron Howard teams up with Mel Gibson in what should be a fun packed,
action thriller. However, there is one word that really describes what
this film is like. And that word is 'Average'</P>
<P>This has to be one of the most 'ok' films I have ever seen. The plot is
about Mel Gibson trying to get his son back after he is kidnapped by a
group headed by a policeman (Sinese). However, halfway through the
film, instead of Gibson paying the ransom, he decides to make it a
'reward' to the first person who brings the kidnapper to him, dead or
alive.</P>
<P>Rene Russos part, as Gibsons wife, is underwritten, and hardly does
anything in this movie at all. However, the best role in the movie has
to Sinese. He has a real evil quality about him, and makes a very good
bad guy</P>
<P>Another major problem with the film is that it is terribly overlong.
The film goes on for 1/2 hour longer than it should. You're glad when
it finally ends, which is a bad sign for a thriller.</P>
<P>Overall, I was disappointed with this film. It's like Ron Howard had
nothing better to do, and made this to make some quick money. With a
bit more development, this could of been one of the best thrillers of
the year. However, it turns out to be merely average.</P>
<PRE>RATING=**1/2 out of *****
