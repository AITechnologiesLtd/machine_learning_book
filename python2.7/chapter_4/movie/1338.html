<PRE>                              BASIC INSTINCT
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>130 min., R, Mystery, 1992
Director: Paul Verhoeven
Cast: Michael Douglas, Sharon Stone, Jeanne Tripplehorn,
      George Dzundza, Bruce A. Young, Stephen Tobolowsky</P>
<P>     A retired rockstar is found dead, stabbed multiple times with an
ice pick, after having sexual intercourse.  The only suspect that the
police can come up with is Sharon Stone, the rockstar's lover (not
girlfriend).  When the police bring her in for questioning her alibi is
that about six months before she had published a book that described the
killing exactly the way it happened.  Cop Michael Douglas feels that
Stone did the killing and is intent on proving it.  He finds out right
after he starts his investigation that Stone is writing another book,
about a cop that falls for the wrong woman.  As Douglas does his
investigation, Stone starts playing with him and messing with his head.</P>
<P>     For the most part BASIC INSTINCT is a very enjoyable film to watch.
Because of a few problems that I will describe later, I only suggest
that you go to see BASIC INSTINCT for matinee prices.  BASIC INSTINCT
keeps you guessing the entire time that you are watching the film.  It
introduces two characters that might have done the deed, and I found
myself switching my suspicion back and forth as the film went on.  On a
scale of zero to five, I give BASIC INSTINCT a four.  BASIC INSTINCT is
rated R for female nudity, graphic violence, explicit language, adult
situations, and adult humor.</P>
<P>     Recently, some people have been slamming this film, but I don't
think that it is really that bad.  Sure, it has its problems, but while
watching the film you don't realize most of them.  The film runs along
rather smoothly (except for the fact that the projectionist messed up
and I ended up with a ten-minute intermission in the middle of the film
while the mistake was being corrected) except for the very end.  There
the film almost falls apart and becomes muddled and confusing.  For this
reason that I suggest that you go to a matinee performance, and that way
you won't feel cheated after seeing the end.</P>
<P>     There are some plot problems as the film progresses, but for the
most part they are minor ones.  The problems really don't harm the
viewing of the film.  There are also a few things that I wish had been
explained more thoroughly that were hinted at during the film, but that
doesn't really hinder the film either.  For the most part, unless you
go to the theater expecting a cinematic marvel, you won't really end up
being too disappointed with the final product.</P>
<P>     A few of the characters introduced in the film don't really seem to
serve a purpose.  The character is introduced and then is mostly
discarded.  I feel that either these characters should have been left
out or they should have been added to so that they fit into the film
better.  Others are introduced briefly, and then used quickly, and then
discarded.  These characters should have also been better written so
that they fit into the film better.  It would have made a much cleaner
finished product.</P>
<P>     Another plot problem is a lot of the incidents that happen in the
film are too perfect.  Too many things happen at exactly the right time,
that in real life would have never happened that perfectly.  This really
should have been corrected to try to make the film more believable.  I
know that I have really been ragging on this film and it may sound like
I really didn't enjoy the film too much.  Actually, I did enjoy the film
a lot and am not upset that I went and saw it.  The acting in the film
is wonderful.  Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone don't have as much
charisma as they could, but they make do.  There are several unexpected
twists in the plot that catch you off guard and most of the questions I
came up with in the film were answered.  For the most part I feel that
Paul Verhoeven did a good job directing the film.  For most of the
scenes good camera angles were used to show you enough so that you know
what is happening, but don't show you enough to give away so much that
you can tell what is about to happen next.</P>
<P>     Joe Eszterhaz wrote the screenplay and he did a rather good job.
He could have left out a few of the liberal sex scenes that were
scattered through the film and tightened up the ending a bit so that it
made more sense.  For the slow parts in the film Joe seemed to feel that
a solution is a sex scene, which doesn't fix the problem.  It just
momentarily puts it off, but it comes back later.  I feel that if he had
smoothed out the screenplay so it wasn't quite as choppy, the film would
have been much better.  Maybe I am really being hard on the screenplay,
but I feel that it is one of the most important parts of a film, so I
feel that it should have half a decent effort put into it.</P>
<P>     The score by Jerry Goldsmith is very well done.  It really seemed
to capture me and pull me a bit into the film.  It isn't distracting and
overpowering so as to pull your attention away from the film, but rather
is used to focus you more intensely on some scenes and to prepare you
for something to happen.  The cinematography is well done in the film
and helps make the film more enjoyable.</P>
<P>     This is probably not a film that you will want to bring young
children to.  There is a considerable amount of gratuitous nudity
throughout the film, some rather graphic deaths, and some rather coarse
language.  There has been a lot of controversy over the depiction of
lesbians and bisexuals in this film, and I really don't see what all the
fuss is about.  They don't really put down lesbians or bisexuals.
Neither do they state that they all become murderers.  So I really don't
think that it is worth all the bother that has been given to it.  </P>
<P>     There is some Hollywood stereotyping done through the film, which
was a bit of a downfall for me.  The males seem, somehow, superior to
all the females in the film, and the females usually use their sex to
get what they wanted.  This was more of a problem for me than the
lesbian part.  In some parts of the film it almost totally puts down
women by making it look like they have to use their bodies to get what
they want.  I really don't think that this is fair to women, and some
women after seeing the film will be disgusted at the stereotyping.</P>
<P>     This is the part that I feel was the biggest put-down in the film.
Women have worked to get themselves above exploitation level and then
something like this comes along and just puts them down.  I really feel
that someone should have seen the stereotyping in the film before it was
released and had it written out for the most part.  The stereotyping, I
feel, is more of a degradation to women in general, not just lesbians or
bisexuals, but to the entire female population.</P>
<P>     So use your discretion on whether to go to a late night performance
and pay more.  I do think that the film is worth watching even though I
came down on the film so hard.  It is just that the film has flaws, like
any film.  And the flaws in this film are much more noticeable after
you have seen the film, than in some that I have seen.  Some of you
might wait until the film comes to video before seeing it.  There is
nothing that would really be lost on a small screen so there is nothing
wrong with this.  You should definitely go to see this film though.
Whether you see it on video or not is your choice, but it is definitely
a good movie and definitely worth seeing.</P>
