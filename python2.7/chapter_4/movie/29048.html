<P>So my grandson gives me passes to this new picture One Night at McCool's
because the free screening is the same night as that horrible show with
those poor prisoners trapped on the island who eat the bugs.  "Go," he says,
"it's just like Rush-o-Man."  Like I'm supposed to know what that means.
Honey, when you get to be my age, you don't want to rush anywhere (except
maybe the bathroom).</P>
<P>McCool's is a story about a very pretty girl who bewitches several men with
her good looks, but leaves each high and dry at the end.  The girl, who is
quite a simple actress, is played by the daughter of Arrowsmith guitar
player Joe Perry.  Jewel starts off by tricking a broke bartender named
Randy (played by Matt Damon) into thinking she was being raped in the alley
behind his bar.  But Jewel really just wants to lure him back to his house,
so she can call her boyfriend (Andrew Diceclay) in to rob the place.  At the
last second, Jewel decides she's in love with Randy and shoots her old
boyfriend in the head.</P>
<P>But there are other men in the story, too.  Most of McCool's is told with
flashback from three different men who each fall in love with Jewel.  In
addition to Randy, there's a lawyer named Carl, whose is played by Paul
Buchman.  He tells his story to a psychiatrist/country music star and we
learn that he likes to wear those pants where your rear end hangs out the
back.  Roseanne's husband plays the other man, a police officer who thinks
Jewel looks like his dead wife, godresthersole.  His flashbacks occur as he
tells them to a priest, who snacks on the body of Christ as he listens.</P>
<P>As if that wasn't enough excitement for one picture, Kirk Douglas plays a
bingo player that Randy hires to kill Jewel when she stops being nice to
him.  It's nice to see Kirk again, and he looked a lot younger than I
thought he would, and such a thick head of hair for a man his age.
Everything comes together at the end, which my grandson keeps reminding me
to tell you all is just a rip-off of True Romance.  There's a very funny
joke that involves a wooden Indian that's almost worth the price of
admission on its own.</P>
<P>I'll tell you what McCool's reminded me of - that time I went to Pearl's
house for dinner, and her goodfornothing son was watching that show The
X-Men Files, which I had never seen before.  But he wouldn't switch over to
Touched By An Angel, so I had no choice but to watch.  In the episode, the
two FBI people were on a mission in the deep south.  Agent Sculder was in
love with the local sheriff, but her partner thought he was a dumb rube (he
was played by Owen Wilson).  As viewers, we got to see the investigation
from the different viewpoints of both Agent Sculder and Agent Mully.  In
one, the sheriff was smart and charming, but in the other, he had rotten
teeth and was a moron.  It just goes to show you.</P>
<P>Back to McCool's now - I didn't care for all the sex and violence, but
thought the acting was pretty good.  Like I said, the main actress isn't
very talented, but all she had to do here was show off her boobs and bend
over a lot.  That's not too much to ask.  When the picture was over, it said
it was made in memory of Stan Seidel, who was the man who wrote the
screenplay.  One can only assume he died of embarrassment, because he wrote
one mean, sick story.  My grandson said the director person used to make
music video for the NTV, but it seemed like he had a hard time keeping
himself focused on things.  Maybe he was too busy staring at that girl's
boob, too.</P>
<P>1:32 - R for violence, sexuality and language</P>
