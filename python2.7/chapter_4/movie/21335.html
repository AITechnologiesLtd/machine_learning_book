<P>As "The Best Man" unraveled, it became apparent to me that the large majority 
of films made about African-American characters either (A) involve crime, 
drugs, and violence, or (B) are romantic comedy-dramas about family and/or 
friends who come together for a certain occasion. While the latter is 
certainly more appealing because it deals with that middle-upper-class 
section that is rarely dealt with on film, the results are usually botched by 
stereotypical, often juvenile, characterizations, or exaggerated plotting 
devices. Such is the case with "The Best Man," directed by Spike Lee's 
cousin, Malcolm D. Lee, which has so much going for it at the outset that you 
almost feel cheated when everything begins to revolve squarely around a 
wedding (this subject has been so overdone) and a scandalous, secretly 
autobiographical book that one of the character's has written and the others 
have gotten their hands on. Of course, this premise still easily might have 
worked had the screenplay, also by Lee, been written with more depth and 
intelligence, and not resorted to such frequent immature behavior. </P>
<P>Taye Diggs toplines the bright cast as Harper Stewart, a writer in his 
late-20's, whom has just left his loving girlfriend Robin (Sanaa Lathan) to 
return to his hometown and act as the best man for his college buddy's 
wedding. Robin will arrive a few days later to attend the wedding, but right 
now Harper is most interested in rekindling his friendships with all of his 
confidants from years gone by. The groom, Lance (Morris Chestnut), is a 
pro-football player who is madly in love with his bride-to-be, the angelic 
Mia (Monica Calhoun), and Harper's other best friends from the past include 
Murch (Harold Perrineau Jr.), a slightly nerdy type who is overrun by his 
domineering, ice queen girlfriend Shelby (Melissa De Sousa), and Quentin 
(Terrence Howard), a playful, wise-cracking musician. The plot is set into 
motion when Harper once again meets his old college flame Jordan (Nia Long), 
and sparks instantly fly. Jordan, a television executive, has gotten her 
hands on Harper's upcoming book, "Unfinished Business," and as it gets passed 
around among the rest of the old gang, they slowly discover that the 
fictional character names are only a cover-up of themselves, with all the 
sordid details intact. The pressure is on for Harper, who is propositioned by 
Jordan to spend the night with her (they never "got together" in school), and 
is suddenly under fire from everyone for writing about their most personal 
details, and even some unknown secrets, including a past rendezvous he had 
with the bride Mia.</P>
<P>With such a minor storyline and characters who are far from 
three-dimensionally written, "The Best Man," as has been noted before, plays 
like a distaff version of 1983's classic, "The Big Chill," but without the 
nostalgic memories, sharp dialogue (the phrase, "You DOG!," has to have been 
used at least a half-dozen times), and smooth narrative flow. While a movie 
about friends coming together is all well and good (and was marvelously done 
in 1996's "Beautiful Girls," in which a 10-year high school reunion was the 
catalyst that set the plot into motion), "The Best Man" ruins things by 
adding the insubstantial book subplot into the mix, and not even using it to 
its fullest capabilities.</P>
<P>While some characters remain stereotypes throughout, without any attempt at 
further development (Melissa De Sousa's Shelby quickly comes to mind), others 
are performed with a true-to-life edge that makes them creditable. Taye Diggs 
is adequate as Harper, the character which everything centers around, but he 
made a more lasting impression in his supporting role in last spring's flashy 
"Go." Who should be especially noted, however, are Nia Long, who is so very 
assured as an actress that I wish she'd break out of this type of role she 
plays over and over; Terrence Howard, who has loads of fun with the most 
comedic character of the piece; and Sanaa Lathan, whose neglected girlfriend 
role of Harper's is the one we most sympathize and identify with. Meanwhile, 
Regina Hall makes a more-than-memorable appearance as a bright-eyed stripper 
who Murch is bewitched by at Lance's bachelor party.</P>
<P>If director Malcolm D. Lee really wanted to make a more sophisticated film 
about a large portion of the population who often times go unnoticed in the 
world of films, why did he insist on making some of the characters act so 
childish? At one point, after a dark secret is uncovered by Lance about 
Harper, instead of having a conversation with him and talking the problem 
out, he resorts to knocking over the table, grabbing Harper by the collar, 
and threatening him. When this occurrence takes place in movies over such a 
petty thing, solely to add some interest and further conflict into the 
dwindling proceedings, I immediately lose all respect for the character. I 
know I wouldn't want to be friends with someone who would act like that.</P>
<P>As with 1997's melodramatic, corny "Soul Food," and last summer's "The Wood," 
which also starred Diggs in a story set around a wedding(!), "The Best Man" 
aspires to be something more than it actually is. Kudos to Lee for trying his 
hand at a more knowledgeable picture that all audiences (not just 
African-Americans) might enjoy, but he also gets more than his share of 
debits for its severely flawed treatment. At over two hours in length, "The 
Best Man" thankfully never overstays its welcome and goes by fairly fast, but 
by the time the Electric Slide was carried out by everyone at the wedding 
reception over the end credits, I realized that the actors deserved far 
better. As is, the conclusion plays like an excuse for each of the cast 
members to give themselves a pat on the back, when they really didn't earn 
that pat to begin with.</P>
