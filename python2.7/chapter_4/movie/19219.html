<P>The Happy Bastard's 30-Second Review</P>
<PRE>NOTTING HILL</PRE>
<P>   A cute romantic comedy from the writer of the hit comedy Four
Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill stars Julia Roberts as Anna Scott,
a very popular actress with a $15 million asking price for movies.  One
day she wanders into a travel book store owned by a simple London
resident (played by Hugh Grant), and sparks somehow begin to fly.</P>
<P>   Sure, there are points of turmoil, such as putting up with Grant's
slightly disgusting (but very hilarious) roommate Spike, Anna's pesky
ex-boyfriend (Alec Baldwin in a humorous cameo), and, on top of all
that, those damn press.  It's a fresh sort of complexity to see in a
romantic comedy, very different from, say, a stubborn father or "not the
right time" like as seen in usual flicks.</P>
<P>   Roberts is terrific as the astonishingly beautiful actress, and Grant
is surprisingly good as the straightforward guy still trying to get a
hold of what has actually happened with this girl.</P>
<P>   In short, a sweet romantic comedy that has a lot of good laughs,
particularly provided by Spike.  One tee-shirt really says it all about
him.  In an attempt to turn on a woman, he shows the front of the shirt,
which says: "You are the most beautiful woman in the world."  On the
back?  "Fancy a f**k?"</P>
<PRE>RATING: 8 (out of 10)</PRE>
