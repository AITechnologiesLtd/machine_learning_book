<PRE>INTO THE SUNSET</PRE>
<PRE>SPACE COWBOYS</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Clint Eastwood</PRE>
<P>Screenplay by Ken Kaufman, Howard Klausner</P>
<PRE>With Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones</PRE>
<PRE>UA North, De Vargas      PG-13     129 min.</PRE>
<P>     There are 261 years of charm and experience at the core of Clint 
Eastwood's immensely likeable geezer-pleaser -- to wit: James Garner, 
72; Eastwood, 70; Donald Sutherland, 66; and wandering in off the 
playground, Tommy Lee Jones clocking in at a mere 53.  Tommy Lee is a 
very appealing actor with a face that looks as though it had been left 
out in the rain and sun to weather, but as we keep observing about the 
love interests with whom these guys share their cinematic beds, couldn't 
they have found somebody of a more appropriate age? </P>
<P>     Together they compose Team Daedelus, a reunited crew that had the 
right stuff but the wrong timing back in 1958, when they should have 
been the first men in space.  Now there's a Russian "communications 
satellite" that's coming apart and threatening to fall to earth, and 
there's only one man who understands its antiquated guidance system 
enough to fix it.  That man is Eastwood, and he understands it because 
he designed it, before it was stolen and wound up in the Cold War hands 
of the Russkies. </P>
<P>     There's no time to train buff youngsters.  Clint will have to go up 
himself.  And the only way he'll do that is with his old Team Daedelus 
buddies.  When project director James Cromwell objects, Eastwood tells 
him to take it or leave it.  "The clock's ticking," he growls, "and I'm 
not getting any younger."</P>
<P>     What makes this movie so much fun is not just the Team Methuselah 
fantasy of four old guys showing they can still cut it with the young 
stallions.  It's the guys themselves.  In our disposable society, it is 
surpassingly great to see guys like Garner and Sutherland deliver the 
goods.  When a NASA scientist (Marcia Gay Harden, with a hairdo 
patterned on the Liberty Bell) asks what she should call them, 
Sutherland replies with a twinkling leer "You can call me.anytime."  
It's not a fresh line, but Sutherland serves it up like steak tartare. </P>
<P>     Eastwood opens with a black-and-white sequence as four young actors 
(voices dubbed by the older stars) take us back to the days of '58.  
Then, like Dorothy landing in Oz, we burst into color as the present-day 
Clint accepts his assignment and proceeds, in the time-honored Dirty 
Dozen/Magnificent Seven tradition, to round up his geriatric compadres 
from their current walks of life.  We follow them through NASA training, 
and finally blast off with them on the mission.  At this point the plot 
thickens, the technology quickens, and the movie takes on the feel of 
another space adventure - and an entertaining one at that.  But where it 
earns its stripes is on the ground as it revels in the sly, understated 
craft of its all-star team of old pros.</P>
