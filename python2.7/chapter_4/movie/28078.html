<P>Somebody told Pierce Brosnan to change his image.</P>
<P>In The Tailor of Panama -- based on John Le Carré's novel and directed
by John Boorman (Beyond Rangoon, Zardoz) -- Brosnan trades in the
sophistication of James Bond for the identity of crude, disgraced spy
Andy Osnard, an MI-6 operative that has to be shipped off to Panama on
account of his loathsome behavior.  Once he arrives in Panama City, the
bad behavior doesn't stop: Osnard immediately sets upon the task of
uncovering "what's going on" with the Panama Canal.  Rumors swirl that
it will be sold to another country now that Panama has it back from the
U.S.  Or perhaps there will be a coup from a populist underground?</P>
<P>Osnard's first task is to hook up with an informant, and he quickly
ferrets out that Harry Pendel (Geoffrey Rush -- Shine, Quills) is not
the mild-mannered expatriate tailor he pretends to be.  Not only does he
serve as the tailor for virtually everyone in Panamanian society
(including the President), he also has a past that includes a stint in
prison.</P>
<P>Stricken with financial troubles, Pendel uses Osnard as much as Osnard
uses him.  Andy pays the tailor for information gleaned from his
government clients.  Pendel, a peon in their eyes, simply makes stuff up
in order to get the payoffs.</P>
<P>Of course, this spirals out of control until a real crisis develops --
but who knows how far it will go, all based on the lies of a lowly
tailor?</P>
<P>To be honest, who cares?  The outrageous and wholly unbelievable plot
developments of The Tailor of Panama are hardly its selling points. 
Instead, it's fun to delight in the performance of Brosnan as a
borderline bad guy -- an unrepentant lech who spews invective and
innuendo at every turn.  Rush's character, playing opposite him in
virtually half the movie, blurts his responses out well enough so that
he just about keeps pace with Osnard.  Their interchanges are fun, and
the opposite actors work well onscreen together.</P>
<P>Less interesting but also worthy are the supporting players, including
Jamie Lee Curtis (somewhat miscast as Pendel's brazen wife), Catherine
McCormack, and Brendan Gleeson -- all pawns in the various plots going
on.  Boorman's direction is vintage Boorman -- which is to say, there
isn't much of it, but at least it doesn't get in the way.</P>
<P>The Tailor of Panama is hardly a great movie -- but maybe it's because
it's just too soon for Noriega-era nostalgia.  I mean, we're only on our
second President Bush.  But if it were 20 years later, or if the plot
were a little more straightforward or if they picked up the pace, would
it really have mattered?  I doubt it; ultimately, The Tailor of Panama
is no more unlikely a tale than your typical Bond movie -- it's just a
lot less fun.</P>
