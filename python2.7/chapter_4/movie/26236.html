<P>Press Conference Interview with Björk, David Morse and Catherine Deneuve</P>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Björk approaches our table bright-eyed, but somehow faintly timid; she
pauses before sitting as a diver pauses to mentally prepare herself on the
board. Suddenly, she shakes her head, smiles, and taps a little dance, "They
were playing jazz -- I was having none of it. I was dancing Charleston."</P>
<P>The Icelander having broken her own patch of ice, sets a silver-glittering
Kuala bear purse on the table and then comfortably takes a seat.</P>
<P>Press: We had heard you decided not to act again...</P>
<P>B: Being in that creative environment were the film was I made an exception,
because of the film I wanted to act. But I should do music ... that's where
I'm at my best.</P>
<PRE>Press: So maybe you'll act again?</PRE>
<P>B: It's not like I got it all planned out. Things keep happening that I
thank God, I couldn't even imagine. Right now I feel very strong on focusing
on music. I get really depressed when I go to Tower records, I don't think
there are a lot of good records there. [Even my own stuff] I'm still far
away, I get embarrassed listening to my last CD's and so I've got a lot of
work to do.</P>
<PRE>On Lars:
He'd always be saying, "Please don't act, I hate acting -- feel your way
through."</PRE>
<P>On Selma songs:
I'm very proud. I was really into it at that time ... giving my interior up
to someone else. For someone as obsessed with music as I am, I always hear a
song in the back of my head all the time, and that's usually my own tune,
I've done that all my life and then suddenly to have someone else's songs in
there is like ... "AHHHHH" a bit scary! Right? But at that time I was ready
for it. I was ready to get really craftmanshippy, because I did 10 years at
classical education as a child, so I was ready to go really anal into music.
The whole idea of writing the music and then going back and hooking up with
Lars and getting someone else's vision I was really into that. That's a
challenge. That's actually understated ... a harder job than sitting there
and thinking of something.</P>
<P>RA: What were the parameters that Lars had given you? Did he give you
specific ideas for the songs?</P>
<P>B: I read the script and my immediate reaction was very emotional. So I
would start writing the songs from a very emotional point of view. More like
a form of love for Selma rather than anything else. For me to react in an
intellectual way ... I couldn't even though I tried, it's not what I'm
about. But when it came to arranging the music -- that's kind of when I can
get maybe slightly clever. That's the part that Lars wasn't interested in at
all, that's why he contacted me. Me being one of the most idiosyncratic
people around. I did the music very much how I wanted to.</P>
<P>Press: What was the first song you wrote?</P>
<P>B: The song that happens on the train. My first question to Lars was, "Does
she have a boyfriend?" Once [I got that song down], I knew what she was like
as a woman and the rest kind of ...[fell into place]. The next was "New
World" the title tune, that sort of was her being hopeful and really
believing that music can save people's lives.</P>
<P>(Some people, while addressing a group, tend to look around at each person,
but Björk turns her head to the person asking the question and responds only
directly to them. Her attention seems very personal - and her bluish brown
eyes, oddly hypnotic.)</P>
<P>On taking on the project:
B: My instinct is 50 times more wise than my head for sure. From the start
my instinct was saying, "Go go go" and my head was going, "This is the most
ridiculous thing you could do in your life." I had to follow my instinct.</P>
<P>Press: The music was so haunting, I was thinking about it all weekend.</P>
<P>B: I guess my music is always an emotional thing. I could never sit down and
decide okay let's do it now. You can't control those things and if you want
to control them then you got a problem. You're just being arrogant. It's not
your choice. It's finding strength in being vulnerable. I think sometimes
discipline is very important [too], but you have to be very careful what
areas you put discipline into. And when I arrange songs I can go with my
academic education. Okay, here we have something that was just burning...
okay just make sure it's got what it deserves and then you can sit there
with like 500 hours of studio time. Some of this music I was 12 to 16 hours
in the studio everyday for a year. You're definitely not on a high, inspired
all the time, you just sort of sit there with big bags under your eyes and a
cup of coffee.</P>
<P>On understanding Selma's pain:
B: She experienced a lot more pain than I have ever experienced. I've had a
lucky life. Some of these songs come from a painful place ... but it's not
mine. This is not my pain. I never felt this pain. But it provokes empathy
for sure.</P>
<P>On her terms with Lars:
B: I want to mix my tunes in London with people I normally work with, I'm
going to do the album sleeve for my album, the record's going to be the way
I want it to be, I'm going to have a final mix. For example, after Cannes I
went back and mixed it again. Basically, what I was asking for was that I
could protect my music ... nothing to do with acting being too difficult. So
I was one day off work, so I came back the next day with a piece of paper
and for one day they said we can't sign that, it's impossible. And then in
the evening -- they did. I was working from August to May non-stop. All that
work I wouldn't be able to do that if they didn't sign the paper. It's
happened so much, just because they were editing something and then
suddenly, "Oh, no, now we gotta do this" and then they'd like chop a minute
out of the song, which I don't mind, I actually prefer my songs to be 4
minute songs ... it was Lars who asked them to be 8 minute long. But it
would have to be the minute chopped out of it that I had to agree with. I'm
ready to collaborate, let's talk about it. It's not like I hand my music
over and go home, I can't do that. After twenty years of doing music, I just
can't do that.</P>
<P>B: There were other things... The fact that they put that thing over the
overture. Because apparently people don't concentrate because there's
nothing for the eye, only for the ear, and I was like "Uhhggg." First the
ears please, because listening in the dark is incredible and the fact that
you need something for the eye, just kills it. But in a funny way it
supports Selma's argument that people don't trust their ears and they don't
trust their instincts and the subconscious and mysterious. They have to like
analyze everything ... the eye is very much an instrument of logic.</P>
<P>On seeing herself on screen:
B: I can't really relate to it. I'd be lying if I told you what it was like.
I just watched it like "blahh" I don't even have an opinion on it. I know I
gave everything I got and a lot more, I'm proud of the film. If I close my
eyes I know all my heart is in there. And that's all I can do. I sit and
watch it, if I don't like something - it's out of my hands. I'm not
controlling like that at all, my acting or image or visual stuff. I wish I
was more ambitious ... but I just don't care. I always knew that when it
came to visual vanity ... I don't really give a shit. And I was right
because [just look at the film] I'd like have a handicam up my nostrils
after I haven't slept for a month and I'd be like [ah so what]. But there'd
be one wrong note and I'd be like "AHHHH" and I'd be running to the studio.</P>
<P>Choreographer Vincent Paterson, speaks with a deep resonating voice, like a
choir teacher or Harrison Ford:</P>
<P>VP: I think that the whole film is really a fable, I think that the great
contradiction for people is that you're seeing a fable for the first time
through a very documentary real world sensibility of filmmaking. Lars is an
amazing director, so much of what Lars does is alters his grips and vision
to bring out as much of the actor's personality ... so almost as much as he
asks us to be improvisatory, he's actually as equally as improvisatory as
he's creating.</P>
<P>RA: Were there really 100 cameras in the dance scenes?</P>
<P>VP: Yes, we used 100 digital Sony video cameras</P>
<PRE>RA: Each rolling their own tape?</PRE>
<P>VP: Yes, and actually in some pieces we used over 100, like in the train
sequence, we would mount 100 on the train and 50 in the landscape, they were
all cabled together. It was fantastic for the actors ... they got to go
through the entire piece from the beginning to the end. [Actually] Lars'
original idea was to do it live, vocally live, but the logistics of that
were too difficult. Lars makes a lot of rules and then breaks those rules
immediately. Even with the dancing, not a Dogma, this is not a Dogma film,
but he created his own commandments for the pieces. Part of it was, there
was no front to the pieces ... that you could face anywhere. I tried to
explain to him that it works better on paper ... [Finally] he changed that
rule and said, "Okay, okay, make it the other way." But everything is like
that with Lars, I mean the script is written out, he told us don't memorize,
just be familiar and then we would walk into the space and he'd pick up the
camera and just say go.</P>
<P>David Morse stands well over six foot, perhaps 6'4," and though he's played
several bad guys recently, his face is peaceful and reassuring. He sits
comfortably, ready, but calm and relaxed. He fields questions with a moment
of careful thought shown only in his eyes. His answers are mindful and often
times sown with a subtle, dry, biting humor easily missed, unspoiled by his
poker face.</P>
<P>Press: When you first read the script, did you have a sense of the
potential?</P>
<P>DM: No. (pause) I thought it'd be potentially something awful.</P>
<P>Press: Is that how you're choosing roles these days?</P>
<P>DM: No. (pause) It was really Lars that convinced me. I did question my
choice, not that what they were doing wasn't good, it was just the character
... was a really hard one to do... because I did not sympathize with him. He
chooses to do something I don't get. So how do you find your way, believably
and truly living that through, if you don't get it. So it was a hard one. I
tried mightily. But this one was a hard one to really feel like I'd done my
job.</P>
<P>RA: Of the wealth of roles you've played in the past of which are you most
proud?</P>
<PRE>DM: Crossing Guard.</PRE>
<P>Press: Were you happy to "Get out" of singing and dancing?</P>
<P>DM: No. (pause) Actually I was really disappointed. I was looking forward to
it. It would be fun to be up on the tables.</P>
<P>On possible audience reaction to the film:
DM: It's not a whole lot different than anything you do for love, you'd like
it to be embraced. In a way there's a satisfaction in doing something so
challenging that people are going to come down on different ends of the
spectrum. We have, Lars has, succeeded in making the film that he wanted to
make.</P>
<P>On Björk:
DM: She is so alive (pause) and unusual, she has no preconceptions, she's
not protecting herself - she was living her life as this woman Selma. It
just brings out things that don't always happen on film.</P>
<P>David mentions that the gun sequence was a bit frustrating for him because
the use of a weapon was so foreign to Björk:</P>
<P>DM: She couldn't just do the scene, (pause) but she WAS doing the scene.</P>
<P>Acting Legend Catherine Deneuve sits donning tint-gradated glasses, she
pulls the table mic a bit closer, and waves to Björk at the other table.</P>
<PRE>Press: Was this acting job hard?</PRE>
<P>CD: I don't work hard anyway. That's not my type of living. It's difficult,
but it's not hard.</P>
<P>Press: How do you feel when reporters refer to you as legend or icon?</P>
<P>CD: I find it a little boring. Because it's a way of putting me away on a
pedestal and watch me and expect me to speak a few lines, but I try to
always break that strange idea.</P>
<P>On audience reaction:
CD: Yes of course, you always want people to like it. [But whenever] someone
special like Lars, takes a normal story and brings it into musicals, makes
you think differently and see things differently ... it's not reassuring.</P>
