<P>   Theater people are not like you and me.  Many live their
lives as though they are always "on," always performing, and
like the character Mima in the new anime movie "Perfect
Blue" and Dr. Bill Harford in "Eyes Wide Shut" may have
trouble distinguishing between illusion and reality.  Some
folks are born to be accountants while others are created to
be on the stage. The genetic difference between CPA's and
thespians could be staggering.  </P>
<P>   We're not talking about the big successes of the Broadway
and West End stages, who appreciate the commercial nature
of their job, but of those who in New York would likely be
seen in small, remote, off-off Broadway platforms and in
London somewhere out on the fringe.  These dedicated
performers are fulfilling a labor of love and are perhaps so
accustomed to taking on roles of idiosyncratic and archetypal
characters that they comport themselves like their fictional
doubles even when away from the glare of the bright lights
and the now worshipping, now condemning audience.</P>
<P>   John Turturro, a creative force on both stage and screen, is
one of the people best able lovingly to portray the often zany
lives of people who live for the joy of performing.  A director
as well as actor, he helmed the crowd-pleasing,
autobiographical "Mac" some seven years ago, a solid tale of
three Italian-American brothers in Queens, New York during
the mid-fifties.  The movie, which was dedicated to Turturro's
carpenter father whose life inspired the film, portrays a man
whose penny-pinching boss frustrates him and makes him
determined to realize the American Dream by starting his own
construction company.  If "Mac" is crammed with offbeat
humor, authentically recreating the lives of blue-collar
people,"Illuminata" is likewise packaged as a droll portrait of
the eccentric folks who work inside the auditoriums
constructed by those builders.</P>
<P>   Again casting his real-life wife, Katherine Borowitz, in a
major guise, Turturro unfolds a tale in which he plays a role
not unlike his capacity as a haunted playwright in "Barton
Fink."  In "Illuminata"--which takes its name from the
designation of the play that Tuccio (Turturro) has written for a
New York company at about the year 1900--the playwright
struggles to have a theater owner put on his latest unfinished
work.  Truly a labor of love, his drama is written specifically
as a gift for his beloved Rachel (Katherine Borowitz), the
company's acclaimed actress and enterprise manager, but
theater owners Astergourd (Beverly D'Angelo) and Pallenchio
(Donal McCann) feel that the work is not ready.  An
opportunity suddenly arises to stage the work, but the
renowned and effete drama critic Umberto Bevalaqua
(Christopher Walken) pans the production.  Insisting that with
the proper re-writes "Illuminata" can be reconceived and win
plaudits, the company seeks to win a reversal from the critic
by setting up reluctant cast member Marco (Bill Irwin) on a
"date" with Bevalaqua--which provides this movie with its
principal scene of pure farce.  While Tuccio continues to re-
write scenes, rehearsing the lines diligently with his
sweetheart, the company as a whole becomes enmeshed in
a roundelay of seductions that could have come from the quill
pen of a farceur like Feydeau.  Celemine (Susan Sarandon)
seeks to entice Tuccio, the lovely Simone (Georgina Cates)
has eyes for the handsome young Dominique (Rufus Sewell),
the rotund Martha (Aida Turturro) sets her clutches on
Pallenchio (Donal McCann).</P>
<P>   Turturro, who co-wrote the screenplay with Brandon Cole,
fills the two-hour comedy with bon mots that could bring a
smile to Oscar Wilde's face.  One member of the audience,
clueless about his own feeling toward an evening's
entertainment, insists, "Who knows what's good?  That's what
critics are for."  We in the audience, all know that we can turn
out better dramas than playwrights, hence the passing
remark by one such fellow to the writer after seeing the play,
"It would have been better if the wife killed herself."  </P>
<P>   Some of the liaisons seem highly improbable, but then
these are actors and Turturro is pushing the farce envelope. 
"Illuminata" is not overlong but suffers from too many
individual scenes, as couples pair off to carry out their trysts
only to have editor Michael Berenbaum cut to the next duo
just as we get to care about one pair.  The film therefore fails
to gel, to hold together, becoming more a series of Saturday-
Night-Live style sketches, however effective the vignettes.  </P>
<P>  Christopher Walken walks away with the story each time he
is on the screen--his hair twisted helter-skelter like the
distracted and lovelorn critic that he is, his machinations on
the handsome Marco providing much of the vitality of the
story. The most captivating scene arrives at the very end as
Simone and Dominique act out a tender love scene set
against a fanciful sylvan background under a full moon, a
woodland creature parting the screen at the moment Simone
ascends a stairwell to the clouds.  The hush that comes over
the audience at the drama is paralleled by the stillness of the
crowd in the movie theater as we perceive anew what live
theater at its best is all about.  "Illuminata" is backed up by
William Bolcom's potent operatic music (the audience at the
screening I attended remained throughout the final credits to
enjoy the strains) and Donna Zakowska's capricious
costumes.</P>
