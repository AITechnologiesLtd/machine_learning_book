<P>When Jack Frost (**) was in its development stages, it sounded like a
potentially great film.  The title role wasn't yet cast, but John
Travolta, George Clooney and Billy Bob Thornton were rumored to be the
top contenders for the coveted part.  Gloomy director Sam Raimi (Evil
Dead, A Simple Plan) was tentatively attached to direct the story of a
lousy father who, after dying, gets a second chance to be a good dad
when he comes back to life – as a snowman.</P>
<P>The finished product, however, is drastically different than the dark
and quirky film that I expected.  Michael Keaton won the lead and Troy
Miller replaced Raimi at the helm, so, on paper, it still didn't sound
too bad.  Keaton has done dark (Batman) and quirky (Beetlejuice) while
first-time director Miller has done both as a member of HBO's wickedly
fantastic Mr. Show comedy troupe.  But there are still problems with
Frost.</P>
<P>Problem #1 is that Frost has turned out to be a kid-flick.  Not that
kid-flicks are inherently bad (see current releases Babe: Pig in the
City and A Bug's Life for proof), but the ray of hope grew somewhat
dimmer.  I remained optimistic as the credited screenwriters were Mark
Steven Johnson (writer/director of the terrific Simon Birch) and Steven
Bloom (James & the Giant Peach).</P>
<P>Problem #2 is the snow.  They must have filmed this during the sunniest
part of August in southern California.  The snow is so fake-looking that
it's actually distracting.  At one point, the family dog trods through
the fluffy white stuff, which comes up to his belly, but doesn't leave
any kind of trail.  Granted, this is a pretty minor issue, but if you're
going to pay Jim Henson's Creatureshop to animate the snowman, why not
go the extra yard and have realistic snow?</P>
<P>Problem #3 is that Keaton's father, leader of the struggling bluesy Jack
Frost Band, isn't really that bad of a dad at all.  Being a traveling
musician, Jack isn't always there to see his kid Charlie (Joseph Cross)
play hockey or congratulate him for an exemplary report card.  He
doesn't beat his wife (Kelly Preston), nor does he snuff out his
cigarettes on Charlie's arms.  If anything, Charlie comes off as a bit
whiny.</P>
<P>The last straw for Charlie is when Jack's band gets their first big
break, but must play a show on Christmas to get signed to a major label
(perhaps Charlie thought his pop was selling out).  On the way to the
show, Jack decides to turn around and spend the holiday with his
family.  But he crashes the car and dies instead.  This setup takes
about forty minutes.</P>
<P>Flash forward one year to a bitter, fatherless Charlie struggling in
both school and social life.  One night, he wishes Jack back to life
with a magic harmonica, and when the snowman in the front yard channels
the spirit of his dead dad, the two are reunited at last.  Of course at
first, everyone in the sleepy Colorado town thinks that Charlie's grief
is causing him to crack up.  They see him arguing with the snowman.
They see him dragging the snowman through the center of town on a sled.
We had a kid like that in our neighborhood, but my mom always made me
come inside when he was loose.</P>
<P>Anyway, Frozen Pop teaches Charlie the `J' shot in hockey and helps him
get even with Rory Buck, the evil school bully (who appears to be the
grandson of A Christmas Story's yellow-eyed Scut Farcas), and -
blah-blah-blah - everyone goes home happy.</P>
<P>Despite dumbing the story down to the level of a second grader, the
movie is still enjoyable for adults for three reasons.  The first is the
fun of picking out Frank Zappa's three kids (Dweezil, Moon and Ahmet all
appear).  The second is spotting the cast members of TV's Mr. Show (I
counted three, plus one voice-over).  The third is trying to figure out
why Mark Addy (the fat guy from The Full Monty) was cast as a hardware
store employee and why screaming poet Henry Rollins played a suburban
hockey dad.</P>
<P>The kids will love the snowball fight, which is second in intensity this
year only to the storming of the beaches at Normandy in Saving Private
Ryan.  They'll also love the unexplainable snowboard/sled chase scene
down what must be the biggest hill on the planet.  This rivals The
French Connection in terms of elapsed time and sheer square mileage
covered.  In real life, the participants would have ended up somewhere
in Idaho.</P>
<P>While not an instant holiday classic, Frost is still the best Christmas
film of the year (sure, the only other one is Jonathan Taylor-Thomas'
awful I'll Be Home for Christmas, but who's counting).  Now, if I were
some big, high-falutin' film critic, they would cut that first sentence
up and use it for promotion by blaring `The Best…Film of the Year!' in
television and newspaper ads.  It ain't, but it ain't too bad, either.</P>
<P>Jack Frost (1:38) is rated PG for mild profanity, cartoonish violence,
some light sexual innuendo and talk of `frozen balls'</P>
